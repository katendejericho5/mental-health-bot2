    "transcript": "welcome guys so welcome to the healthy\ngamer GG stream my name is dr. Alec Cano\njeah I'm a psychiatrist practicing in\nBoston Massachusetts we have a very\nexciting stream today we're gonna have\nBobby scar Bobby scar I think Bobby scar\nNewman I'm confused\nbut oh and a hypetrain\nfantastic so we're gonna talk to Bobby I\nthink Bobby wants to talk a little bit\nabout Padma so in the past we've talked\nabout the Sun script word called Dharma\nwhich means duty or responsibility and\none of the big things that I advocate\nfor is for people to find their Dharma\nand I think that that becomes important\nbecause Dharma is that would just allow\nthat which allows us to tolerate\nnegative things are suffering with like\nactually just a lot of strength so it's\neasy to do hard things if they're\naligned with your Dharma and I think a\nlot of times people struggle because it\nthanks for the subs nifty a lot of times\npeople struggle because when you think\nabout like the hard things that you have\nto do in life you don't have like a good\nreason to do them right so if it's like\ngetting out of that or finding a job\nlike finding a job in and of itself is\nnot a good reason to\nI mean sure like it's a good idea to\nhave a job but like money is not\nactually like a motivator that's gonna\nhelp you overcome let's say video game\naddiction or depression or things like\nthat so you need like a really good like\nyou need a cause like you need a cause\nfor yourself so termas like a personal\ncause and I think Bobby wants to talk\nsome about that what's up man\nuh not a whole lot just better still\nrising Li not back to normal which you\nknow is taking way longer than I\nexpected but can we just do a quick\nsound sound check we can test one two\ndoes he sound okay I hear you okay the\npeople can hear me what is up with it\njust a lot of them well yeah okay great\nOh some someone saying they\na little louder that's what it sounds\nlike to you okay test one two all right\nso Bobby so tell me I'm so first of all\nI'm sorry I know we've been scheduled to\ntalk a couple of times I just got like\nlaid low for a really long time yeah and\nhave been kind of out for two weeks so\nsorry about that but hopefully I mean\nI'm here now and hopefully I can help so\nhelp me understand a little bit about I\nunderstand you've kind of reached out to\nus because you had some questions about\nDharma I just realized that you're like\nthe one person I've responded to on\nTwitter to by the way that's yeah I\ndidn't see you respond and I was like oh\nthat's weird\nwhy you would be healthy gamer GG but\nyou have your own Twitter yeah so and I\nbarely know how to use it so yeah that\nshould change I should probably get on\non Twitter and spend a little bit less\ntime on reddit yeah I'm for sure but so\ntell me a little bit about you know what\nyou wanted to talk about today and and\nhow we can be helpful so I mean I\nreached out to you originally first of\nall that's a great question I'm not sure\nthat I know and I'm interested in\nletting you drive okay you know you can\npoke around and play with some things\nwe've got some directions to kind of go\nin I reached out to you originally you\nmind if I do a quick introduction know\nwhere the hell means but yeah for those\nof you don't know me yeah I'm Bobby\nStarr I am if you do know me then you\nknow me from the melee community I'm an\nX Pro player I was really good in 2009\nstill good in 2012 trying to be good in\n2019 but I don't I don't have the time\nthat the kids do and I know right so I'm\nkind of like an elder you might call me\nat this time so I transitioned into\ncontent creation and I'm a streamer not\nfull-time or anything but I shoutcast\nbig tournaments and stuff like that and\nI make some YouTube content but along\nthe way I kind of realized you know I've\nas I got a job and kind of gained more\nresponsibility or whatever\nI've been tugged kind of in a direction\nin my whole life\nsorry and it was kind of I guess I\nrealized in retrospect you know I like\nplayed this game and I tried to get\nbetter at it pretty much obsessively\nfrom college\nand kind of as I looked back as I got\nolder I was like oh man\nyou know I learned how to create video\ncontent from the melee community I\nlearned how to kind of like think from\nthe melee community I kind of learned\nwho I was and what I cared about from\nthis community I got my first job\nthrough a connection in the community so\nI kind of like had an increasing sense\nthat the game kind of made me everything\nthat I am and taught me everything that\nI know and so kind of like looking back\nI realized I've been trying to build\ncommunity to kind of make sure that\nother people can have access to the\nthing that gave me kind of like\neverything that matters to me well yeah\nand so that took me to live streaming so\ni work at twitch I've been at twitch\nalmost seven years now so that's really\nlong in the you know if you talk about\nlike dog years it's like two lifetimes\nand in tech yeah and you know when we\nmet I think I told you you know I you've\nseen the matrix I see myself more as\nMorpheus in this case you're neo where\nI've been like scanning twitch for\nsomeone to arise that's gonna look a lot\nlike you and kind of do all the things\nthat you're doing and you know it\nhappened in the last I don't know six\nmonths or so and so like I've spent a\nlong time you know looking looking for\nyou so I people I wanted to help that's\nwhy I reached out originally okay well\nyeah so if you guys are just tuning in\nso bobbi and I have had a so we\nconnected a little bit when I had to\ncancel cuz I was sick and we were just\nkind of joking back and forth about\nwhich one of us is neo and which one of\nus is Morpheus\nI thought I was Morpheus than you or neo\nbut we can get into it the first thing I\nwant to just comment on first of all\nBobbi is that it sounds like you know so\nI know that there's a lot of flack\nagainst gaming right now and like gaming\ncommunities and gamers in 2019 the World\nHealth Organization sort of classified\nvideo game addiction as a disorder and\nrecently like president Trump made some\ncomments about school shooters being\nrelated to like violence related video\ngames and things like that I just want\nto just kind of just point out that I\nthink it's really amazing that it sounds\nlike your involvement in the melee\ncommunity has really given you a lot of\npause\nlike it's given you your first job\nopportunity it's taught you how to train\nit's not you how to think and and so\nlike gaming is not evil in fact it\nsounds like it's a huge way to kind of\nhelp you figure out who you are yeah\nyeah for as far as I can tell a game\nwhen people are connected around it kind\nof it becomes this external and kind of\nobjective way of communicating in a\nsense you know we all agree to the rules\nof the game and then once we agree then\nwe can really enter some dialogue about\nit and it helps kind of it also helps us\nkind of be more objective and like you\nbelieve what the game tells you in terms\nof like if I win then probably I know\nsomething that you don't even if I can't\nexpress it or communicate it personally\nso I don't know I found that I found\nthat in a weird way a game can kind of\nhelp people connect on a human level\nlike if you don't have any objective\nkind of thing that we're all looking at\nthen we could be talking about two\ndifferent things and kind of not realize\nit I think my life has been about two\nkey themes one is communication and two\nis about belonging like I've kind of\njust been obsessed with how hard it is\nto communicate with people and how it's\nreally interesting a lot of the times so\nI remember as a kid watching people in\nmy family talk and it was really clear\nthat there were two different\nconversations happening or you could\ntotally tell that person one thought\nthat it was the same conversation and\nperson two thought it was the same\nconversation and like neither of them\nwere correct it's just very interesting\nhow you know you can piece the puzzle of\nthe conversation together even if it's\nwrong really easily sure I think maybe\nwhat you're referring to is that\noftentimes when people have\nconversations they're sort of just\nwaiting for the other person to stop\ntalking so that they can share their own\nthoughts and it's not like two\nconcurrent monologues as opposed to an\nactual dialogue which yeah I see a lot\nis that kind of what you mean I in that\nI think more it happens I notice in\nconflict so say two people are not\ngetting what they need they're talking\nabout it I've been\ntaken aback by like how unclear\nconversation participants can be about\nwhat the real issue is you know what are\nyou really upset about is a question\nthat I think that I ask a lot and I'm\nnot sure how its received but I don't\nhear asked a lot and I think a lot of\nthe time you know two people could make\npeace but they never get to their real\nproblem and so so you said the other\nthing that you've been kind of curious\nabout is belonging so can you tell me\nyet about that yeah so you know growing\nup so I was born in the east coast to a\nCatholic family\nand it's it sorry I definitely have\nsomething stuck in my throat I've been\nthinking about all the ways that I felt\nthat I didn't fit in and all the you\nknow little factors they conspired to\nmake that you know really kind of\nobvious but you know I didn't really fit\nin my family I wasn't really into sports\nI D converted from Catholicism and I\nthink high school which is an experience\nthat I haven't really reflected on\nenough it's like a big deal to kind of\nwalk away from something like that\nwithout anything else to catch you I\ndidn't really fit in in grade school you\nknow I had a series of friends where\nlike kind of kind of I guess from my\nyoung perspective I was betrayed or\nwhatever but we would have falling outs\nI think in part because you know what my\nparents spoiled me and you know I had a\nbunch of stuff and so it's kind of a\nlittle bit weird to have a bunch of\nstuff and then your friends don't have\nas much and then it's like kind of I\ndidn't know why that was the case\netcetera\nbut anyway so having not belong for\nquite a long time but then finally melee\nand like having this real sense that I\ndo fit in was kind of nuts it's one of\nthose things where something was missing\nbut I didn't know what and then I had\nthis thing and it's like oh this is the\nthing that was missing like this is\nreally great and so what was it that you\nfound with melee well I think for\nfirst time you know I to be honest like\nI've reflected on this question a lot\nand I think that the the answer is that\nit's my it looses what me we is yeah\nyeah for the Gamecube by the way I\nthanks to profound soup for the gifted\nsubs thank you profound is that someone\nyeah thanks for your support you were\nsaying um Bobby yeah I think that it's\nkind of this this sense of purpose that\nis purposeless you had this pure sense\nof play I think that's what I found like\nI found this sense of inspiration that\ncame totally from within so it's like I\nwant to get good at this game for no\nother reason than I want to and then\nalso that it was kind of sustainable and\nI could go really really deep and there\nwere other people who were that deep and\nwho are interested in that I I don't\nknow about I don't know about you but\nI've I'm one of those people where say a\nfriend will say hey have you ever\nwatched this series like have you gotten\ninto the wire for example and I'll watch\nit but I'll watch it and get really\nreally deep into the lore and before I\nknow it I'm asking them if they know\nstuff and they don't so it's like I\nalways feel like I go a little bit\ndeeper in something that really\ninterests me and then I end up kind of\nlike alone you know deep inside the lore\nof something so sure that's not super\nsustainable like you may enjoy the\ncontent but you don't get the human\nconnection that comes with it which i\nthink is like but it sounds like with\nwith with smash brothers melee you found\npeople who would get just as deep as you\ndid yeah it's both we're right I I got\nto you know when I think about belonging\nversus fitting in it's like belonging is\nwhen you can be fully yourself and still\nlike accepted like I don't have to not\nbe myself in order to like fit in that\nmeans that's that's some way that you\nbelong so it's like I can be myself as\nmuch as I want and other people will\nstill be there and they'll be cool with\nme yeah I I think you're talking about\nsort of acceptance right so yes yourself\nand being accepted for being yourself\nyeah and and fitting in is when you sort\nof become someone that you're not for\nthe sake of acceptance exactly and\nfitting in super toxic for those of you\ndon't know yeah why do you say that\nwhy do I say that well I feel that\nacceptance is a thing that we're hungry\nfor and authenticity is also a thing\nthat we're hungry for and those two\nthings you know you end up on one side\nor the other with the realm of hungry\nghosts if you choose to be purely\nauthentic but you know everybody hates\nyou you know because you can't find a\nway to be authentic and took like exist\nwith people I don't know it's difficult\nto transcend the need for you know\nsocial interaction\nI'm sure or if you like go fully in the\ndirection of acceptance but you\nsacrifice who you are then you know you\nmay feel good for a little while but\nit'll come for you you know it'll have\nyou gone down that road which one\nprobably probably I've gone down both\nyeah\nyeah I'm going down both I know my way I\nknow my way around this space so Oh\nBobbi is there something in particular\nthat that you wanted to talk about today\nor that I can help you with yeah\nabsolutely but there's there's almost\ntoo many things but one thing that we\ntalked about was meeting people where\nthey are and there's a couple you I'm\ngonna just cover a couple things sure so\nI listened to your conversation with\nlooser fruit yesterday and the rightness\nanger hurt well there's my arrogance\nthing struck a really strong chord and I\nthink if there's something there for me\nthere it's a different yeah is that what\nyour senses yeah there's a different\nroute you know I think I felt that she\nhad a route that where you asked her a\nquestion and she gave an answer that I\nwouldn't have but like before that I was\npretty much my answers would have been\nexact Oh calm and I I think it bit yeah\nthere's something really important there\nokay what do you thing that's coming to\nmind is there's this I think it was\nBoris or something I don't know the\nDeuter you told to clean his room which\nI thought was really yeah Julius\nbulliest yeah you talked to him about\nlying and how if you lie you don't have\nto keep the thing you know that you're\ngonna lie about like in good order you\ncan just have it be in you know in other\nwords you can have your life messy and\nyou're just gonna lie so now no one\nknows\nI stopped lying a long time ago because\nI learned first hand that it sucks and\nit just yeah but I have noticed you know\nfrom that conversation that though okay\nso I have a lot of thoughts and I think\nabout the world in a particular way but\nI have never decided to share what I\nthink with other people and so in a\nsense it's not that I'm lying about it\nit's just that I'm hiding it and so I've\nnever gone in there and cleaned it up\nand made it presentable and I think that\nthere's something like important about\naccepting for myself the way that I\nthink that makes sense\nlike I don't quite I don't want woody\nyeah I have this sense that I don't want\nother people to know the way that I\nthink why not why do i why do I have\nsensor well yeah what is it that makes\nyou feel like other people there's a\npart of you that you don't want to show\nto other people yeah I've had that sense\nmy whole life okay so I'll talk a little\nbit about my history like or you know my\nkind of something more personal so in my\nfamily my dad's side there's a disease\ncalled CMT charcot-marie-tooth it's like\na degenerative kind of disease and I\nknow that both my dad and his dad like\nhave gone to extreme lengths to hide it\nfrom other people so like their whole\nlife is about not being seen as weak\nbecause like their their body is\ndegenerating right so they're always\nhiding something I'm pretty confident\nthat that same anxiety passed to me cuz\nI've had the sense my whole life that\nlike I've been hiding something and for\nme I think maybe I just replaced it with\nlike I don't belong or something like\nthat but I've been looking for what I've\nbeen hiding my whole life and I've never\nfound anything like what do I have to\nhide where if people found out the thing\nthen I would be outcast forever I have a\ndeep sense that there is something there\nbut I've never been able to find it so\nthat you're you want to hide something\nabout who you are and yeah there our\nhypothesis is that this was essentially\nsomething that you learned from your dad\nand your grandfather yeah and I don't\nhave the disease is it it is a\nwhat do you call it an inherited disease\nand I just didn't get the gene so it's\nlike if I had it then I would have\nfilled in the blank with the same thing\nand then everything would have been fine\ncuz my worldview would have made sense\nbut now I kind of it's been built on\nthis thing that doesn't you know I'm\ntrying to say there's like a whole yeah\nso it sounds like you have you feel like\nyou need to hide something but you can't\nunderstand what it is that you need to\nhide yeah and so you know I've filled\nthat in with a bunch of things along the\nline and you know it's like okay yeah so\nI've had working hypotheses about what\nit might be that I need to hide over\ntime and it's the answer has changed\nwell one thing that I still feel that I\ndo hide without any reason is the way I\nthink I feel like if people know that\nabout me and they won't accept me yeah\nso why do you think that that's\nunfounded though it's possible it is\nprobably founded it's probably well\nfounded only didn't didn't we talk I\nthink yeah go ahead\ndidn't we talk about how you have a lot\nof kind of interpersonal conflict\nbetween people when you share your\nthoughts because they're not able to\nmeet you where you are and you're not\nable to meet them where they are yes so\nit sounds like when you actually show\nwho you are to people that it isn't\nwell-received\nI think that's true I also have the\nsense that when I when I approach a\nconversation from the perspective that I\nhave something to hide it tends to go\nmuch more poorly than if I show up\nwithout having to hide anything yeah in\nother words like I'll hide some of my\nassumptions that help make the story\nmake sense like words that I'm saying\ndon't make sense to other people and I\nrealize after the fact that I didn't say\nthe like first part of the story so\nlet's just pause for second and just\nthink about this for a second so you say\nthat you have something that you feel\nlike you need to hide about yourself and\nlet's just understand what the different\nhypotheses are for why someone can think\nthat okay yeah so the first is that you\nknow so I tend to have like an mo which\ntends to be around some scars which is\nthat you do actually have something to\nhide and that's a very genuine feeling\nand that if we dig we'll find something\nthat will fit our hypothesis of there is\nsomething I need to hide I just don't\nknow what it\nhmm but we have to pause for a second\nbecause that hypothesis in a sense part\nof what I don't like about that kind of\nthinking is that it always presumes that\nthe answer is like one layer deeper and\nif we don't find anything it's that\nwe're not digging deep enough right so\nso it's kind of tricky because it's like\nif I believe that there's some like deep\njuicy psychological root to all of your\nproblems I can continue to believe that\nand if I don't find it I can just say\nthat oh it's deeper it's deeper it's\ndeeper so it's actually a it's not a\nvery scientific hypothesis because it's\nnot falsifiable agree second thing is\nhow much do you know about epigenetics\nour inherited trauma have you learned\nanything about this stuff studied this\nokay no I've only heard from you so I\nthink this is kind of an very\ninteresting kind of field of frankly\npseudoscience so the this is really in\nthe qualitative research realm so it\nhasn't really been that born out but as\nkind of a promising and kind of\nintriguing field so the first is that\nwhen we think about what we inherit from\npeople before us we tend to think about\ngenetics right so like if your dad has a\ncertain hair color or eye color your mom\nhas a certain hair color eye color\nyou're likely to have those hair colors\nor eye color sometimes you know\ndepending on whether it's recessive or\ndominant things can skip a generation so\nwe know that there's genetic inheritance\nfrom generations past there's a really\ninteresting book so this is more of a\nqualitative exploration about this\nconcept of inherited trauma which looked\nat Holocaust survivors and specifically\nthe children of Holocaust survivors and\nthat the children of Holocaust survivors\nexhibited some signs or symptoms of PTSD\nwhich really didn't map on to like any\nkind of trauma because they were never\ntraumatized right it was sort of like\nthey had some version of PTSD even\nthough there was never a Sentinel event\nso that they believed and acted in\ncertain ways like almost like you are\nright so where you're trying to hide\nsomething I mean that that can be\nactually passed on from generations\npreviously so there are kind of two\nscientific mechanisms through this one\nis through apogee attic changes so we\nhave the actual sequence\nof our genes and then we also have\nepigenetics which is like the activation\nor dis activation of particular genes\nand those can actually be passed on to\nso as you activate let's say like\ncertain genes that maybe make you more\nprone to anxiety even like you can pass\non some degree of that epigenetically\nit's still an emerging field the science\nis not really clear I guess\npseudoscience is a little bit unfair\nit's just an emerging field that we\ndon't really rice in right the other\nthing is that it may not be something\nthat's on the epigenetic level but is\nsomething more on the the social or\npsychological or like upbringing level\nright so it's not nature on the\nepigenetic it's nurture so yeah\nessentially like if your dad was anxious\nand and like taught you how to hide then\nyou can sort of mimic his behaviors yeah\nso children of abusive parents will\noftentimes be abusive there's some\nreally interesting research about if you\nhave a child with an anxiety disorder\nand you have a parent with an anxiety\ndisorder you can actually treat the\nparents anxiety disorder and the child's\nanxiety will get better I don't want any\ndirect treatment I totally believe that\nand so then so we have two scientific\nkind of causes for the first thing is\nthat either this has happened either you\nfeel like you need to hide things number\none because there's something deep down\nthat you need to hide the second is that\nthere could be some degree of an\nepigenetic phenomenon going on in terms\nof like you said that you know in that\nsomething that you've kind of pieced\ntogether right so that there's something\nlike a tradition of and that may have\nchanged actually the the way that your\ndad's genes were activated and that can\nbe passed along or that it was sort of\nthe way that you were raised and taught\nand you certain behaviors were modeled\nfor you mm-hmm\nand then we get to the really wild stuff\nwhich is frankly like this sort of garma\nreincarnation like that kind of thing\nwhich I mean I think is so first of all\nis a little bit more spiritual but I\nthink generally speaking you know I\nthink a lot of these like more spiritual\nor non scientific concepts are actually\nsupported by science the further that\nscience advances\nthink about God Irma in this idea that\nlike you you are born with certain\nthings that are from beyond this life\nthat's basically what karma says is that\nall causes have effects and that all\neffects have causes that's really all\ngod am i saying it's actually like\nNewtonian physics so every action has an\nequal and opposite reaction and so if\nyou look at your particular life that\nyour particular life has causes so the\neffects of your life the way that you\nare today is actually affected by things\nthat happened before your life even\nbegan yeah\nwhich SATs true again so the interesting\nmoment from the perspective of like my\nworldview anyway I think it that's true\nwhat do you mean by that\nlike the I really want to get this thing\nout of my throat man this is killing me\ndoes it ever get some water you know get\nsome water okay yeah just drink\nsomething is that gonna make it go away\nI guess it kind of does yeah you have\npost-nasal drip is there actually\nsomething in your throat or you feel\nlike clearing your throat there was but\nI think that I the water flush it out\nokay you're on top of it I said from the\nperspective of my worldview that makes\nsense so basically like I've gone to all\nsorts of lengths to figure out why I\nfeel like not good enough not good\nenough I know as a theme a lot of people\nfeel that way I have a very deep sense\nof it and I've like tried to fix it so I\ntry to understand it and so belonging\nand community is the number one thing\nthat's helped me feel like a good enough\nperson but I've noticed that if I'm in\nthe melee context you know I feel good\nits context you know it kind of goes out\nthe window and I found that to be very\ninteresting and so I've kind of noticed\nthat I had these different personalities\nin relation to different communities and\nI've thought pretty deeply about that\nlike I'm as a twitch staff and as an\nemployee I feel one way you know with my\nfamily I feel a different way with the\nmelee community I feel a different way\nwith like my wife's friends I feel a\ndifferent way and I played with that I\nactually like meditated for an hour a\nday for a hundred days to try to like\nget deeper into my mind I found that we\ncan talk about that a little bit later\nbut I felt very anxious when I met\nI don't think that I was in you know I\ndidn't have the right well anyway I\ndidn't kind of accept the thoughts as\nthey came I was trying to be enlightened\nI actually straight up was like all\nright I'm gonna hit I'm gonna achieve\nenlightenment and I know that my idea\nabout that was like not well-founded\nso Bobby I'm gonna jump in for a second\nso you say that you kind of have a sense\nthat you're not good enough yeah and\nthat you've tried a lot of different\nreasons a lot of ways to fix that\nbecause you're assuming that that's like\nsome kind of pathology or that's\nsomething wrong with you and you tried\nmeditation and different kinds of\nenvironments and circumstances to help\nyou feel good enough yeah okay so I have\na really crazy question for you if you I\ninserted the fact that maybe you're\nactually not good enough yes that's been\nhypothesis number one and how do you\nfeel about that I mean I believe it I\nbelieve that I believe that I'm not\ngonna know for sure so I feel great to\nthink that it makes everything make\nsense yeah so so it does that cause you\nsuffering\nah that's a good question what I'll say\nis that that idea does not cause me\nsuffering I feel totally fine with the\nidea that I'm not good enough what does\ncause me suffering is to have reflected\nback to me something that I don't\nbelieve is true so if someone else kind\nof you know you're when you were talking\nabout when you're talking with loser\nfruit you said something about cutting\nyourself some slack and that being\nsomething that she could try maybe it\nwas with the guy you had before Mitch\nMitch Jones okay but anyway my kind of\nresponse as you asked that question you\nknow the one that comes from me is that\nI don't cut myself any slack and I like\nthat and I want other people to know\nthat I don't cut myself any slack so\nthat when they asked me questions like\nin other words I wish that I had some\nway of saying like you don't believe\nthat I've done this due diligence but I\nhave so just stop asking questions along\nthis line unless you really want to get\ninto it cuz like I've already done this\nwork like I don't cut myself any slack\nso I don't need you to okay you know ask\nme a billion questions about a couple of\ndifferent things going on here okay\ncool the first is how you relate to\nother people which is oh [ __ ] so you\nget into that and I can help you with\nthat but the second thing is I want to\noffer another option so I so generally\nspeaking when people feel like they're\nnot good enough we almost assume that\nthat is like a sense of inadequacy right\nyeah do you feel inadequate no okay so\ngood so now I think you are one of the\nvery rare people where your sense of not\ngood enough so I don't usually say this\nto most people right like so for most\npeople that I talk to if they tell me\nthat they don't feel good enough we try\nto dig into how their insecurity is\nactually like comes from a root that is\nlike unfair and you're yes I actually\nthink you're not good enough okay\nbecause it's strange right because in\nyour sense\nyou're not good enough doesn't actually\ncause you a problem it doesn't cause you\nsuffering so I think your sense of not\nbeing good enough is actually the\ncalling of an incomplete karma oh I\ntotally agree with you yeah I'm not yeah\nI totally agree with you\nand and so in your case I think that\nthat force that that causes you to\nstrive to be a little bit better which I\ndon't think you need to be better I\nthink you do something that's a little\nbit unhealthy with that but you need to\nhelp yourself understand that you're\nfirst of all you're not you're not good\nenough and secondly that that's okay and\nthat over time you will become good\nenough in the way that you need to be\nand in the way that the world needs you\nto be hmm I'll try it's super hard to\nwhat to be the me that I think the world\nis asking me to be yeah so that's your\nproblem\nis because you're trying super hard and\nthe more you try the less authentic you\nbecome okay that I think that that is\ntrue mm-hmm so so you're right\nso what you need to do is just\nunderstand that you don't need to try to\nbe anyone else you just need to be you\noh people won't like me upon me so then\nwe get to the second part right which is\nthe [ __ ] which is the way that's why I\ndon't that's why I don't be Who I am if\nhe won't like me upon me I believe that\nyeah that that's because so I don't that\nthat's a problem I agree\nokay but that we're gonna have to gonna\ngo slower we're gonna go into how you\nrelate to other people but the first\nthing that I want you to understand is\nthat I don't think you're good enough\nand I think you're good enough Ness is\nnot like a deficiency or earning\ninadequacy and I'm glad that you\nactually don't feel inadequate because I\nthink this is rare you're good enough\n'no siz actually just a sense of\nincompleteness it's like a ball that's\nbeen thrown up in the air and hasn't\ncome down and so just have faith that\nthat and maybe this is where you know I\nwould encourage you to\nand yeah okay so we got to get to the\nother people because that's you're\nhesitant at the way that you relate to\nother people makes it hard for you to\naccept the person that you are because\nother people are not willing to accept\nthat person but I don't think that they\nactually see that person I think they\nsee some distorted version of that\nperson because I think you've got other\nkind of things that come out when you\nrelate to other people and when you talk\nto a guy but let's start with so I think\nit's okay for you to not be good enough\nI think you're not good enough I think\nyou have just an incomplete Dharma right\nso that sense of not being good enough\nis your Dharma so until that voice is\nquieted you should continue to strive to\nbe whatever the world needs you to be\nalso to be yourself because the world is\nnot going to ask you to be anything that\nyou cannot be mm-hmm oh I feel okay I\nthink that what you're under stand what\nyou're saying here's let me repeat back\nI don't necessarily get I'll tell you\nwhat I do understand I felt that people\nhave told me that I need to be a\ndifferent person and I found that as I\nlisten to them they don't feel that\nanything's gotten better and so I've\nlearned to kind of not trust when people\ntell me oh you need to talk in this way\nor you need to do this you need to do\nthat and they're rather they're pointing\nat a sense that they can't quite put\ntheir finger on what the real problem is\nokay\nand so when you say the world is telling\nyou like I kind of try to listen to\nlet's call it reality like people can\ntell me things but oftentimes the words\nthat content is not like really where\nthe meaning is or where the money is as\nyou put it so I feel like what you're\nsaying is that if I read between the\nlines the world is not and has not asked\nme to be not me\nit's just asked me to be me yes and also\nthe world has told me that I have a\nfeeling of not good enough and my not\ngood enough comes from a job not yet\ndone which is my feeling but that's not\ncoming from the world that's coming from\nyou\nwhich part the feeling of not being good\nenough okay so the world is asking you\nto be a different person or not the\nworld but individual people so I'll give\nyou an example or the world telling you\nthat you're good enough and that's melee\nyeah right so when you think about the\nmelee community you just showed up and\nyou were just you showed up I just\nshowed up yeah and that was sufficient\nthat was enough you felt like you\nbelonged so we actually have evidence\nthat when you show up in the right place\nat the right time and you be the person\nthat you're that you are that everything\nis is hunky-dory and kosher and\nwonderful and that's you fulfilling your\nDharma okay can I ask you a different\nquestion I pivot slightly here's the\nthing that happens in melee that lets me\nshow up as me and I I have a question\nall the time when I interact with people\nit's even happening right now of like\nwhy like why am I here why are we\ntalking why is anybody care like why\nlike guys there's a why question that\nwith melee the answer was melee and I\ndidn't have there was no question below\nit yep like me talking to you I'm\nexcited to talk to you so maybe that's a\ngood enough why like I'm here because I\nwant to be and I just want to I just\nwant to talk with you but I find that\nlike social anxiety and even you know\nI'm really working on parenting is I\nhave a three-year-old and I don't want\nto pass my insanity to him I have a why\nquestion of like I want to do a good job\nas a dad but it's like it's not a why\nit's like how do I do that or what does\nthat mean or what does it look like it\ngets complicated and then I'm in my head\nand I'm not right where I'm is that the\nright word yeah sure but listen so how\ndo I be me Who am I okay so how do you\nbe you\nso here's the problem with being you the\nproblem with being you is you're\nconcerned about the consequences of\nbeing you and the more you have become\nconcerned about the consequences of\nbeing you the less you become you right\nhell yeah I'm concerned about the\nconsequences I learned right that I\nshould be concerned about the\nconsequences there's a lot of saying\nthat's that's what you got to unlearn\nright so that's the pain that you got a\nprocess because let me explain something\nto you you can't screw up your kid like\nyou just can't right like like does that\nmake sense to you or no no hero so so\nyou know you have a three-year-old right\nso your three-year-old like comes up to\nyou sometimes and wants to do something\nand then like like what's the last thing\nyour three-year-old ask you to do be a\nmonster okay be a shark okay and so like\neat the corn and the tomatoes that the\nfarmers growing okay and did you do that\nI did okay so was that what was the\nconsequent that did you mess him up no\nbut I think if I said no I don't care\nabout your stupid shark that wouldn't\nbeen bad that would have been bad I\nagree\nbut what what did you feel like doing\nwhat was the authentic you telling you\nto do I really would have preferred to\nrest okay I chose to be a shark okay\nright so is that net net net net I\nprefer to be a shark okay so so in fact\nlike that's that's what being a parent\nis right like your kids sometimes shows\nup and like wants you to be a shark and\nyou want to rest and if you're just\ngonna do your dog amount to your child\nit's like being a shark for a little\nwhile because the other thing that you\nneed to understand if you tell your\nchild from time to time that Daddy\nreally doesn't want to be a shark right\nnow I'm super tired\nis that gonna mess him up no that would\nbe a nice way to say it\nbut I feel guilty sometimes I don't know\nI've been listening to how you talk\nabout you know how you are with your\nkids and I think it's really good and I\nwant to learn how to do that better\nhow'd it be less apologetically me I had\nthis kind of thing that's in my mind of\nlike being a little bit more we need to\ndo is stop\nto be better like this is the problem is\nthat you have a sense of incompleteness\nright but then ya think that the\nsolution to that incomplete list if\nyou're not good enough the solution is\nto get better that's where you're making\na mistake you don't need to be better\njust because you're not good enough\ndoesn't mean that you need to be better\ncuz that sense of completeness are\nbecoming better is gonna happen like you\ndidn't create smash smash happen to you\nwhatever is gonna happen to you is gonna\nhappen to you like you get that your kid\nhappened to you yeah like you didn't\nlike your kid is amazing yeah did you\nmake I didn't know so like like if you\ndidn't make that amazing using what me\nwhat makes you think you can [ __ ] up\nthat amazingness you're right you're\nright tunics it yeah you're right you're\nyeah you're right you're right right\nabout what where I saying it's like\ncompletely ridiculous it's it's a\ndelusion of control to believe that I\ncan that I'd like yeah that I\nsuper-duper influence my kid because i\ndo realize you know through meditation I\nbarely even control myself\nyou know yeah so so this is where to\nthink that I can both control myself\npredict the bounces of what I'm gonna do\nand how he's gonna hear it at that\nparticular moment so that I can craft\nhim into it as ridiculous exactly right\nso that's the thing you can't craft him\ninto anything you can't make him be good\nand you can't make him be bats also just\nshare something from the field of\nPsychiatry so sometimes when I'm working\nin the emergency room which is not\nsomething thankfully I do much anymore\nbut I actually kind of miss it so\nsometimes you get a kid who comes in\nwho's like completely all who has\nsomething that we call SLS [ __ ] life\nsyndrome like that's the diagnosis they\nhave like ADHD and PTSD and depression\nand this learning disability and this\nkind of thing they've been in juvie and\nthey've got this case worker so like\nthey're all these like diagnoses that we\nchecked but really what it is is there's\nthis wonderful nurse practitioner who\nworks in the emergency room who's like\nshe's just she's a veteran so she's been\ndoing it for a long time and she was\nlike a brilliant person taught me a lot\nabout psychiatry she's like this part of\nthis kid doesn't have any of this stuff\nthis kid has [ __ ] life syndrome and then\nso then something funny happens so like\nwhen you meet the kid and the kid is\nlike a complete [ __ ] or whatever and\nyou try to be compassionate\nempathic or whatever and you you make\nsome progress with the kid and then at\nsome point you meet the parents and then\none of two things happens when you meet\nthe parents you start to ask yourself\nhow can you still hear me\nare we frozen Oh hold on\ntwitch chat' my life frozen crash okay\nhold on Oh are we back can you hear me\nBobby I can hear you okay so I was where\ndid where did we lose you I thought it\nfroze for a second you're asking chat\nyou didn't never lose me but okay so you\nheard the story about yeah her soul then\nyou meet the parents okay if you meet\nthe parents one of two things happens\nyou either so at some point like you\nknow you meet a really like messed up\nkid and then you meet the parents and\nthen you say oh that's why they're that\nway like you how did this kid end up\nlike this and then you meet the parents\nthey're like oh that makes perfect sense\nthat's how but sometimes you meet the\nparents and they're like the nicest most\nwonderful people in the world they have\ntwo siblings who are also like wonderful\npeople and you're like how the [ __ ] did\nthat happen we have no idea that\nsometimes I mean is it I know it sounds\ninsensitive but like sometimes you just\nget like a bad kid and it's not the kids\nfault but it's also not the parents\nfault\nmm-hmm my point is that you know like\nyou're like your kid is amazing and you\ndidn't really make him that way he's\njust do it right it makes sense to me\nand so you can't craft him into\nsomething but you can certainly do right\nthings or you can do wrong things right\nthere are times where you can say like\nyou know I'm too tired and there are\nalso times where you can like be a shark\nso you can do your Dharma to him but you\ndon't control the Karma you control the\nDharma you control what you do you don't\ncontrol what happens to him yeah and who\nhe becomes you just do the best that you\ncan and at times it's important to tell\nhim that you're tired because he's got\nto understand that like other human\nbeings have like feelings and limits you\nknow and he can start to learn\ncompassion and things like that so I\nthink that you can you can you know\nlogic yourself and thought loop yourself\ninto thinking that you're doing a bad\njob no matter what you're doing\nand so to kind of sum up I mean I think\nyeah I think I think your problem is\nthat you try too hard to control the\nconsequences of your behavior sure for\nsure yeah I see that\nand.and so okay so let me just think is\nthat sufficient on that do we want to\ntalk about other people do you need a\nyou know an analogy about nature to\ndrive things home no I think I I think I\nunderstand what you're saying okay so\nhelp us understand what I'm saying I\nthink that I mean you talk about it all\nthe time man and and I know it from from\nplaying melee like if I'm trying to win\nthough the best thing to do if you're\ntrying to win is like don't try to win\nlike you just have to play like it's\nalways a paradox at the end of the day I\nthink that you're telling me that I'm\nnot seeing I'm seeing a paradoxes cause\nand effect where like I can just try to\nbe better and that's gonna do the thing\nbut if I want to be better I need to not\ntry to be better\nexactly right if I want to see Who I am\nthen I need to stop trying to trying is\ntrying is the devil I mean I'm trying to\nfigure out who I am so that I can be Who\nI am I'm trying to control being Who I\nam just kind of ridiculous trying I'm\ntrying trying like you can't you know\nascendance doesn't come out of your your\nmouth with without the word trying yeah\nit doesn't come out of my head either\neither my head exactly what citizen that\nthat's how we're seeing what's in your\nhead and that's the problem you need to\npull out a crime and this is where I\nthink it related to other people so I\nagree so I think I completely agree so I\nwill get into that but now I want to\njust go back for a second and just\nremind you that\nokay let me just think about this so\noddly enough I think your sense of not\nbeing good enough is actually could be\nyour solace here so for a lot of people\nfeeling not good enough is a sense of\ninadequacy which makes you want to try\nharder but if you can accept that you're\nand I think you're halfway there because\nyour sense of not being good enough\ndoesn't cause you suffering it's not a\nsense of inadequacy it's just the sense\nof something half done right and so if\nyou can take solace in the fact that the\nother half is gonna come when it's gonna\ncome that a flower is gonna bloom when\nit blooms like you can see the bulb and\nyou can say it hasn't bloomed yet and\nlike that doesn't have to be a problem\nand the flower can think like oh I need\nto bloom but like no you're gonna bloom\nit's just gonna happen when it happens\nand that's what smash taught you so\nyou're gonna is teaching you this\nalready that in order to create this\namazing child you didn't need to try to\ndo anything you just needed to be the\nperson that you could be be the best\nperson that you could every day for your\nson and as long as you do that he seems\nto be doing pretty good and you're\nafraid that you're going to curse him\nwith all of your negativity and stuff\nlike that don't worry about it man if\nit's in his garma to get cursed he's\ngonna get cursed and it's not something\nthat you can control you can just\ncontrol the most that you can do so take\nsolace in the fact that you actually\ndon't need to try and that your sense of\ncompleteness is gonna come mm-hmm it's\ngonna come the same way that Miele came\nthe same way that your son came into\nyour life the same way that like\nimportant things are happening into your\nlife the same way that you were here\nMorpheus looking for neo and then lo and\nbehold I knew you were gonna come I I\nknew it I predicted it I knew it was\ngonna happen yeah so maybe you are\nMorpheus right but so that's the thing\nso so take solace in that right that\nthat that life is gonna give you what\nyou need and you actually don't need to\ntry because the most amazing things that\nyou've done in life have been without\ntrying so it's not a winning strategy\nbuddy no it's a terrible strategy yeah\nso now we can it's difficult to learn\nthat strategy generally and I'm excited\nto get to the next part cuz I think that\nthat's in nowhere yeah I completely\nagree so so good so let's talk about\nwhat's the next part other people\nabsolutely good let's talk about other\npeople I've got two camps okay you're\none of my people or you're not hmm\nyou're one of my people I could be\nmyself if you're not I can not and I've\nnoticed that I have a you know there's a\nscore system you start out I don't even\nknow where you start out but I've\nnoticed that I have no mechanism to kind\nof increase my sense of trust only to\ndecrease and that once it's decreased\nit'll never go back up it's like totally\nmessed up okay how long died at that\ntime I think as long as I can remember\nto be honest what's your gently a little\nbit about your upbringing yeah so yeah I\nhave one little brother he was he was\nhe's two and a half years younger than\nme something like that I was I think\npretty much showered with attention like\nI think my parents my parents parenting\nstyle was basically like love you know\nlove my kid just purely expressed love\nlike get stuff for them and then I think\nmy dad had this strategy of if there's\nsomething that I don't like criticize it\nuntil they stop doing it so you know\nI've kind of wondered you know we talk a\nlot of it when you get into psychology\nyou kind of think about the story that\nkids tell themselves and I kind of have\nthis feeling that before my brother was\nborn or whatever or even you know before\nmy Deb got concerned that I was a brat\nuh the game that I was playing was\nbasically just show up and be me and\neverything's gonna be totally chill\nright people are gonna get stuff for me\neverybody's excited about me everybody\nwants to listen to what I have to say\nand then one day my dad starts saying\nyou know as I'm just doing my normal\nstuff that always is a winning strategy\nhe's like hey you know you're being a\nbrat like nobody likes a brat and like\nkind of making fun of me then if I cried\nabout it it's like you know you're being\na\nmy baby or whatever it's like well\nthat's [ __ ] you know what happened in\nthe old game where I just you know you\nnever did this I'm bringing all the\nsubjects because I feel like this is\nkind of how I've thought about how to\nexplain how I work because it is\ndifficult to explain\nsure so so yeah I'm sorry why you're 11\nI'm laughing because so the more that I\nget conclusions from other people the\nharder my job is mmm\nyou want you don't want conclusions you\nwant right so your conclusions that are\ngenerally so when I get conclusions from\npeople so it's it's clear that you've\nthought a lot about this and I've\nnoticed this in the couple of\nconversations we've had Bobby that\nsometimes it's hard because I have to\nlike unravel your conclusions to try to\nget the raw data so that I can grab the\nraw data yeah I think you're gonna give\nme whatever you gonna give me and it's\nfine I'm just laughing because it just\nmeans I have to you know it's just that\nmy process is gonna be different\nand I think for overall it's generally\ngood that people are thoughtful and\nreflective because the the upside of\nwhat you do is that we cover a lot more\nground because right you know I don't\nhave to stop and and digest everything\nbut let me ask you this did you ever get\nback to how did you ever kind of get\nback to where you were with your dad no\nnot yet\nnot not quite recently I think something\nhappened where my dad was worried that I\nwant it because I moved away and I\nchanged my last name you know there's a\ncouple things I think he interpreted as\nme like distancing myself but we had a\nconversation and came to a head and I\npretty much told him like hey man like I\nlove you and I'm your son and like I\nwant to you know I want to I want that\nto be the case and there's nothing else\ngoing on I think since then we've kind\nof connected a lot more like I noticed\nsomething changed but my dad was very\nmuch like more the dictator and the\nauthority you know he's very high-stress\nhe's a very anxious person I think he's\nlike a workaholic to kind of cope and my\nmom kind of keeps the peace and my mom\nwas kind of the one who like listened\nand stuff I never got along with my\nlittle brother we like fought a lot he\nkind of picked on me and my mom told me\nto like\nbecause I'm older this is maybe when I\nwas six or seven it's like my\nresponsibility to just like kind of take\nit and that I think was very formative\nlike I remember that I have very few\nmemories from my childhood but I\nremember that very clearly how do you\nthink that affected you well I think\nthat it makes me more patient you know\nI've noticed that I'm a very patient\nperson like I can listen to other people\nwhen they're feeling hurt for a very\nlong time so I can sit with feeling hurt\nI guess for a long time but on the other\nhand I don't really know how to take\nnegative or critical words from other\npeople I don't know how to deal with it\nokay so I from kind of letting it in and\nbelieving it\nthat's a conclusion but I guess I've\njust noticed that when my brother did\nthat it's like for me to not react like\nI had to find a way to not react and so\nthat's created a bunch of behaviors and\ncoping strategies and stuff like what I\ndefinitely think that kind of just\nwondering if they're right is a pretty\neffective strategy to not react to\nsomething like so my brother would be\nlike oh you know you've got a piece of\npizza face or whatever when I had acne\nand it's like I could be upset but if I\nstop and think about well maybe I do you\nknow and then I feel like some shame or\nwhatever then I don't really react\nwhat's wrong with reacting that was what\nmy mom is asking me to do in other words\nI interpreted it as like don't react to\nthe you know if he's making fun of you\nlike you you're the older brother so be\npatient and be patient in my mind was\ndon't react okay\nisn't that what that means sure what\nwould she ask me to do it yeah yeah um I\nthink um I just I have a lot to say\nactually but I'm just thinking about so\nlet me ask you this so I'm almost\ngetting the impression that you know in\nyour dad your relationship with your dad\nwas sort of you started out in a\nparticular place and then you kind of\ngot bumped down a notch because you were\nbeing obnoxious and then you got bumped\ndown another notch because you were\nbeing a crybaby\nand that in a sense it's been really\nhard to claw your way back up\nyeah for what it's worth I don't have\nany real memory of being in that\noriginal place but I'm sure that I was\nyou know from my cameos and stuff you\njust you just remember the back slide\nyeah I do remember this in gradually\nyeah so I remember like at a certain\npoint I kind of understood my dad as\nmore of a force of nature and less of a\nperson with feelings and motivations and\nkind of like control that's helped me\nmm-hmm and when you think about other\npeople and when they lose ground in your\neyes how do you think about them do you\nthink about them as people or do you\nthink about them as forces of nature mmm\nforces of nature for sure absolutely for\nsure no question one of the things that\nreally struck a chord was when you asked\nthe question of like okay so if someone\ndoes something to hurt I'm also very\nvery sensitive like I feel hurt all that\nyou know very easily like is it better\nif they have a good reason or a bad\nreason like a bad reason is kind of like\nunacceptable in my mind and I just kind\nof don't even consider that that's\npossible so there has to be a good\nreason and the best good reason I can\nthink of for like lots of people\nignoring me and stuff is that you know\nthey're kind of motivated by other\nthings and like I'm not really part of\nthe equation\nit helps numb the pain for me to think\nthat someone did something and it hurt\nme and but like they weren't really\nthinking about it\nBobby you experienced a lot of hurt man\nyeah yeah I think I had the empathic\nsponge thing dude well my wife will tell\nme stories about like you know her\ncoworkers or whatever and like you know\nthey did this thing and like it wasn't\nquite right and she's upset about it I\nfeel like I feel her hurt and judgement\nbut I feel the other person's like\nstruggle to be good enough and to be\nseen well in other people's eyes and\nthen it's like I feel I feel so much\nwhen she tells me that I feel like I\nfeel the whole world of hurt so you you\ncaught yourself you almost said I feel\nhurt all the time but you didn't quite\nsay that do you feel hurt all the time\nalmost all the time yeah what's yeah I\ndo it feels like the incompleteness that\nI have to be honest it feels like you\ngotta get that no I don't think it's for\nme I don't have an appointment it feels\nlike I deserve it\nit feels kind of sad but it feels\nmotivating at the same time hold on a\nsecond sorry yeah dr. K with the phone\ndude sounds like a dog barking\nweird hold on a second\nyep for sure still 11:04 my time I hope\nI do homies hadn't convinced when you\nsaid I'm here to see you sounded\nconvincing to me too\nI may have to step outside for a second\nand just figure something out but yeah\nso so Bobby I mean I I so did it's that\nfeeling of in it's that feeling of not\nbeing good enough uh no I feel like no\nit's different it feels like someone\nelse feels like someone else or lots of\nother people feel hurt and it's my job\nto do something about it like I feel\nlike I had to protect them from from\nkind of what I experienced the hurt that\nI experienced that's what it feels like\nwhen we talk about me feeling it hurt\nall the time that's what it feels like\nit really does if it feels like what I\nfeel like I'm hurt because I identify\nwith other people and how hurt they are\nand that I need to do something about it\nokay let me just think for a second let\nme figure out who's in my office - okay\nso I'm gonna just\nI'm gonna have to stop at about 10 or 15\nminutes is that okay mm-hmm we can pick\nthis up um but I just want to go back to\nso when you feel hurt you feel like you\nhave to protect other people from that\nhurt yeah yeah I feel a Papa Bear\ninstinct so if my wife is telling me\nabout a co-worker and how that person's\nlike not doing their job or whatever I\nremember when I couldn't do my job and\nlike no one taught me how to do my job\nand that's [ __ ] right and I know other\npeople looked at me in this way you know\nwhere it's like oh you suck but it's\nlike no one taught me that's not fair\nand I feel like it's time for me to step\nin and make it clear that like you can't\njust treat people like that it's okay\nfor people to not know what they're\nsupposed to do but then it is so but\nthere's so many different layers of that\nhappening all the time so what what UPS\nwhat kind of conflict do you have with\nother people can you give me a little\nmore to go yeah so like no one tiling a\nlittle bit go ahead go ahead so you were\nkind of talking about how like you know\nsometimes people say things to you and\nyou feel like like you you know you do\nyour due diligence and they'll question\nyou and then you'll feel like they don't\nrespect that you're doing your due\ndiligence right right right right um\nyeah I think that the conflict so here's\nthe conflict that I think that I have I\nshow up to work every day and I'd show\nup in most places every day feeling like\nI've got a job to do and it's like a big\njob\nI also am aware that this is more of a\nconclusion so I won't even add that part\nand so I'm coming to work and I'm having\na conversation and it's like I\nunderstand that the stakes for example\nlike community is very sensitive so I've\nreally deeply studied community in it\nthat you need to find a way for people\nlike lots of different kinds of people\nto find their way in and like be\naccepted really be accepted without\ncompromising the integrity of the thing\nthat people are coming together around\nit's very delicate and it's very\nsensitive and if you get it slightly\nwrong you can compromise the integrity\nof the community which is devastating to\neverybody or you can ostracize someone\nwho's trying to come in and that's also\nthat's devastating to me personally so\nthe stakes are very high and I'm trying\nto communicate this and I'm trying to do\nthis kind of like very advanced in my\nmind very technical very delicate dance\nand like other people aren't on that\nlevel you're not thinking about it the\nsame way and I can't get them to think\nabout it the same way and I know that\nthe you know the decision or whatever\nyou know other perspective is out there\ncould hurt a lot of people does that\nmake sense yeah so so that sounds\nincredibly frustrating yeah what upsets\nyou about the way they treat you I just\nfelt it the thing that gets me very very\nangry is like what I perceive is\nunearned confidence uh oh my god like I\nget so angry if someone's saying like no\nno no it's just this way like it's\nsimple and they don't even they they\ndon't have the full picture so like kind\nof a disrespect of the\nwhen you when you brought up arrogance\nit's like okay in my mind all human\nbeings were like naturally arrogant\nwhenever anybody says something they\nwant to believe that what they just said\nis correct\nright mmm so provided that that's gonna\nbe true and I don't want to say anything\nwrong I have a deep sense of not saying\nanything wrong\nI need to be aware of my own arrogance\nand so I need to check everything that I\nthink is right because it's probable it\nmight be wrong but because I think it's\nright that's like zero data it's like\nyou know and so I'm trying to hold that\nfor me and for other people like I find\nthat I do that in the melee community I\ntry to hold our arrogance in check and\nthey let me do it in the melee community\nin a lot of other places I don't know\none lets me do that\nand so I get very angry because it's\nlike no no no you're just literally\nbeing biased like any executive at any\ncompany you know Nintendo or could tell\nme oh I know this that and the other but\nit's like customer dawg\nI'm your customer and you don't know\nyour customer I know you don't know your\ncustomer because of everything you're\nsaying it shows me that you don't know\nwhat you're talking about\nso just like why do I even need to talk\nto you that's what that's kind of the\nanger that I feel and and so what do you\nthink it is that people so we were\ntalking earlier about how you know you\nnot being good enough is reinforced by\nthe way that other people treat you\nmm-hmm but this seems different right so\nI think what they're responding to is\nnot the authentic you yeah what are they\nresponding to\nso what you just said I don't know if I\nI hear it and it makes sense but I'm not\nsure that I believe it what don't you\nhave what your response what they're\nresponding to is not the authentic you I\nthink maybe I think it's the authentic\nme the me that's trying I think is the\nauthentic me no it's not exactly so that\nthat's not that connection has not been\nmade up here like when you said it I was\nthinking to myself like men are so very\ngood so the the authentic you doesn't\ntry if you're trying you're not the\nauthentic you oh right so the authentic\nyou is being it's not trying\nI think also what's going on is\nsomething that they're triggering\nsomething but what comes out is actually\nnot the authentic you what comes out is\nsome sense of now this is important so I\nthink there's also inadequacy like this\nsounds like inadequacy like there you're\nlike you guys are not giving me the\nrespect that I deserve\nabsolutely yeah it's all at you go I can\ntell\nI don't shrug any sauce so but that's\nnot the authentic you so then the\nquestion becomes so then I think like\nyour whole like like it's not your\npremises wrong you're doing this weird\nthing where you have a sense that you're\nnot good enough and that's your\nincomplete karma and that actually\ndoesn't cause you any suffering or lack\nof peace or anything like that that you\nactually have been complete and good\nenough several times in your life oh\nokay I guess I just have a flash of\nsomething I'm sorry to cut off go okay\nso I feel like what I'm trying to do my\nKarma or at my Dharma is like I'm trying\nto cast a OE belonging let's call it\nthat right you're doing AoE healing I'm\ntrying to catch Larkin and I kind of do\nit in the melee community and I'm trying\nto build the tools that I would need and\nthat my community would need to like\ngrow way faster that's my idea that's\nwhat I want to do I want to do it for us\nbut I also want to do it for other\npeople like me and other people like us\nwhich includes you I'm trying to control\nthat outcome yeah you're very welcome\nI'm trying to control that outcome and I\nfeel so close dr. K to being able to do\nit I feel like I'm so close if only\nright if only I had the respect people\nwould listen or only if only all like\nthese these things then it would be done\nand not only would I be complete but\nlike it would bring you know something\nreally important to the people of the\nworld which is what I have to do and I\nfeel like people are in my way that's\nwhat makes me crazy what do you think\nabout that\nI think at once it could be true but it\ncould be true that I'm right about some\nthings that are really important I also\nthink that\nyou know I think about other people\nunlike I'll get upset about it but also\nso poppy I'm gonna cut you off okay sir\nyes do it do it here's here's here's the\nproblem so I think that you have this\nburden on your shoulders and first of\nall you're trying to do it right so\nthat's mistake number yes and the harder\nyou try look more you try you're like I\nwant this like it's like it's almost\nlike I'm gonna use this weird analogy\nit's like you're trying to get someone\nto love you yeah like I want you to love\nme I want you to love me I want you to\nlove me and then in comes someone in the\nmiddle and gets in the way of you making\nsomeone love you and then you get mad at\nthat person because why are you in the\nway of this great work that I'm trying\nto do I'm trying to save humanity with\nAoE belonging and you are like getting\nin my way\nand then I think what they're responding\nto is not your authenticity but like\nthis whole complex like this is not you\nlike the way that you created belonging\nis not through trying it's through being\nit's a subtle difference subtle subtle\nsubtle subtle subtle and I think what\nthey're responding to is is your\nfrustration that they are not getting\ninto line and I don't think you can\nblame them for that because that's\n[ __ ] you know you're like you're\ntelling them that like you it's like\nyou're playing whack-a-mole and they're\nthere like the one nail that is like a\nlittle bit above popping out of the\nbench and you're trying to hammer them\ninto place and they don't like it when\nyou hammer them mm-hmm\nand and that too is like there's some\npart of you I think that sort of longs\nfor this kind of sense of you know the\ngreater good and that everyone needs to\nget in line and it's like a little bit\nlike you know like I mean there's a lot\nof you know the road to creating the\ngreater good is like tramples on all\nkinds of people right and and I think\nthat what you what you really need to do\nis like first of all take a step back\nfrom trying to create this thing so hard\nlike that so if you can start solve the\ntrying I think a lot of this stuff is\ngonna get better but then secondly like\nit's not that you're inadequate it's\njust that they're responding to you\nbeing an [ __ ] which is that believe\nis probably true\nwhich which I think sometimes you can\nbecome and and the reason that you\nbecome an [ __ ] is because you're\ntrying so hard and someone is getting in\nyour way I'm also trying really hard to\nnot be an [ __ ] but it turns out that\ntrying to not be an [ __ ] and trying\nit doesn't add up and to do that\nstuffing an [ __ ] I mean so I think\nthis is where like you know taking a\npage out of your mom's playbook I think\nwhat you need is patience right so the\nfirst thing is that you can't make this\nthing happen because it's like false\nlike if this one person gets in line\nlike what you're gonna get what you're\ntrying to create is like not gonna\nactually happen\nsecondly the things that you need to\naccomplish what you need what you want\nto in life to do your daughter mom\nthey're actually gonna pop up and help\nyou out like you're playing an RPG where\nlike you walk into a town and there's a\nguy there who's ready to join your party\nyou don't have to make him he's there\nand like you're that person and like so\nwhether you're Morpheus and I'm neo or\nthe other way around like you predicted\nmy rise within the world of twitch and\nHere I am to help you out and so you've\ngot to take a step back and do what you\nneed to do and if there are forces that\nare getting in your way you know don't\ntake it personally because it's not\npersonal they just don't understand they\nmay not be as deep of thinkers as you\nare but like you can't blame them for\nbeing what they are you can't be mad at\na cucumber for not being a flower right\nand and somewhere along the way like\nyour relentless pursuit of this great\nthing I think is letting you engage in\nall kinds of bad mental stuff in your\nhead I agree yeah I agree with you and\nand so can I ask ya a question sure my\nquestion is back to who am i but who am\ni if I'm not trying like I haven't been\nanyone who's I've been trying for a long\ntime yeah but you haven't right so like\nwhen you it's purpose without purpose\nthat's not trying it's the thing with\nnothing underneath you've been it Bobby\nyeah you've been it so like like I have\na meditation practice for you and then\nunfortunately I'm gonna have to stop\nyeah yeah yeah because I I did actually\nmake an appointment so not the guy's\nfault\nI just I just texted him incorrectly but\num so I want you to like just like what\ndo you like to do with your kid again\nI'm trying to figure it out I like\nplaying outside I'll hang outside do you\never watch your kids sleep yeah\nthat's pretty dope so like so I want you\nto just watch your kids sleep right and\nthen like like I can't leave my sleeping\nchildren alone so I have to like attack\nthem and kiss them and and rub their\nfeet and things like that and and just\nbother them to no end\nbut so I I want you to think about like\nyou know when when you're doing when\nyou're in that moment and they're being\nwho they are and you're being who you\nare where's the trying right so like sit\nand just do that and look for the trying\nand then the next time you're in\nconflict with someone look for the\ntrying\nokay right like like just just just take\na snapshot of watching your child sleep\nand take a snapshot of an interaction\nwith another person where they're not\nbeing the thing that you want them to be\nor whatever and just see how different\nthose two moments are and then you tell\nme so we're gonna have to do follow-up\nso I apologize for having to cut things\na little bit short but you tell me then\nwhich one is the real you all right for\nsure I'll do that I'm gonna look at the\ntrying yeah look for the trying right\nand look for the absence of trying look\nfor the triangle look for the being yeah\nand I think the more that you can\ngravitate towards your authentic self I\nthink like you've done it a couple of\ntimes already and you're gonna continue\nto do it\nand then we can get into like what's the\ndeal with this grand you know this grand\nwork that you have to do like I don't\ndoubt that it's grand work but when you\nstart thinking of it as grand work is\nlike when it gets them to a problem like\nI run into all kinds of problems when\nyou know I take seriously that people\nthink I'm here to like save them and\nstuff like that there's a real cult\nmentality that if we're not careful is\ngonna grow in healthy gamer yeah for\nsure\nand and so it's it's just I mean it's\njust about individual conversations\nright it's not about I mean AoE healing\nis cool and all but it's not about what\nthe viewercount is it's not about other\npeople it's a conversation between me\nand you yeah and and that's the Dharma\nthat we do in as long as we stick with\nthat term oh we're doing great and I\nthink you've got to learn how to just be\nyourself a little bit more yeah the\nother things like it might be right the\nlast thing is like I don't know where\nthis like deep well of hurt that seems\nto never end comes from I don't think it\ncomes from the outside I think it comes\nfrom within and we gotta understand you\nknow where did you learn to hurt so\neasily and like what's the what's the\ndeal with that that's bad because I\nthink most anger has its origins and\nhurt and you seem to me to be incredibly\nangry yeah for sure and and so that\nmeans that you got hurt somewhere right\nlike and like even when you respond to\nthose people in those moments like why\ndon't you guys take me seriously like\nthat's you that's like anger that's\ncoming from hurt like they're hurting\nyou with their words and then you\nrespond with anger so like I don't know\nwhat that that's completely separate\nfrom what we were talking about earlier\nlike yeah so that we can get into but\nyeah anyway cool good work today is your\nbreakfast or I got a run okay cool so\nsorry guys but I think in your case your\nmeditation practice is to catch look\ntrying and to watch your child sleep\nwill do okay and then if you've watched\nsomething maybe you can lead everyone\nelse but\nyou're gonna live you are you go to my\nstream I'm actually not live right now\nbecause I'm on a Mac and it's like who\nshould who should I raid"
