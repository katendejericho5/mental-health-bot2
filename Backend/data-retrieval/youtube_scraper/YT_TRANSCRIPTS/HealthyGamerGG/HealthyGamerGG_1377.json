    "transcript": "so you guys like the ultimate main quest\nin the ultimate Dharma is Frodo in the\nring Frodo in the ring you guys need to\ngo to Mordor and like drop the ring and\nit's like it's painful and it sucks and\nit's terrible and you're gonna be\nthirsty and you're willing to do it\nbecause it's the main quest because\nthat's your tournament\nso this is why I love doing this right\nbecause all of you guys are wrong and\nnone of that helps anyone I mean sorry\nall of you guys are right\nsorry and none of that helps anyone so\nlike we can talk about values and\ndesires and it doesn't help anyone like\nokay so you guys say like okay it's\ninternal I completely agree higher\npurpose completely agree desires her\nbiological drives okay fine desire is\none like all of that stuff is true and\nit doesn't help anyone so here's that\nhere's the answer okay so I I do think\nthat desires are external and and values\nare internal but values are what drive\nyou to action but both can drive you to\naction but values generally speaking\ndrive you towards action in spite of\nsuffering and desires rarely do but you\ncan desire something and enough enough\nand it can kind of drive you to action\nanyway despite negativity so what the\nyogi said is that desires have their\norigins in the invidious in the India's\nor the sense organs so if it originally\ncomes from a sense organ then it's a\ndesire so let's just think about that\nwhat does that mean so let's think about\nI want a hot dog\nis that a desire or a value right why\nlike you go can we all agree that it's a\ndesire right even if you don't accept so\nforget the answer that I gave you guys\njust think about it for a second if I'm\nwalking down the street and I want a hot\ndog like where what is that that's a\ndesire right like we don't think about\nlike when we think about like what are\nyour values like when you have a mission\nstatement from an NGO or a non-profit\neating hot dogs is not gonna be on there\nright like that's not the kind of thing\nthat goes into a mission stay because\nvalues go into mission statements not\neating hot dogs if I want a particular\ncar where does that come from value or\ndesire\nright okay so then we get into this\nissue of materialism so are all Matar\nall desires material and I'm talking\nabout hot dogs and cars and that is not\nnecessarily so does that mean that all\ndesires are material so let's say that\nI'm walking down the street and I see a\nguy my age and a girl roughly my age\nholding hands sitting on a park bench\nand then I say to myself I want that\nthat's not material right so it's that a\ndesire or a value ah ah see now we're\ngetting we're getting tricky right so\nthis is exactly why we're having this\nconversation\nso the yogi said if it comes from the\ninjurious it's actually a desire so not\nall desires have to be materialistic and\nso if we think about something like\nloneliness so like loneliness and a\nfeeling like a like if you're missing\ncompanionship that doesn't come from a\nparticular sense organ right that\nfeeling comes from within indriyas ind\nrry okay so the first thing to\nunderstand is that if you're thinking\nabout your goals in life and the the\ngoals that you set for yourself where do\nthey originate do they originate and\nthings that you saw did you walk down\nthe street and see your friend who used\nto weigh 400 pounds and now weighs 160\nand then you say to yourself man I want\nto lose weight\nthat doesn't sound materialistic it\ndoesn't sound bad it sounds like Noble\nit sounds like a good goal right like\nany doctor can get behind that\nand yet what happens when you try to\npursue that goal right like what happens\nyou fail right why because it's a desire\nso it's a good desire desires don't have\nto be evil even if you look at someone\neating a salad you're like man I should\neat more salad still a desire so the key\nis to find values because values drive\nyour internal like like that's where\nmotivation comes from its fulfillment of\nvalues and the problem is that most\npeople don't even understand what their\nvalues are so like if you're like I'm\njust gonna you know I'm gonna have a\nvery poor sense of what twitch chat is\nbut I'm just gonna think about the\nperson that I work with who like is the\nmost desperate so if you're 24\nunemployed living at home playing video\ngames all day that's the person that I\nstarted streaming for by the way that\nperson you think about the goals that\nyou set up they're all based on desires\nnone of them are based on values that's\nthe problem you think about financial\nindependence wonderful you think about\nmoving out of the house also wonderful\nyou think about you know wanting this\nand wanting that and not wanting this\nand not wanting that looking this way\nfeeling this way not being overweight\neating healthy like all wonderful goals\nall desires all desires because they're\nbased in the invidious so that's not\nwhat naturally motivates behavior like\nyou can you can motivate behavior\nthrough desires but if you really want\nto move forward you need a Dharma\nbecause the Dharma tells you that you\ncan't afford to fail because it's bigger\nthan you it's a duty it's a\nresponsibility and we see this because\nthe cool thing is when I talk to that 24\nyear old or 19 year old or 31 year old\nand we see how far they're willing to go\nfor a friend it's amazing they're not\nwilling to do anything for themselves\nbut if it comes to a friend like if your\nfriend is sick and they need like\nnutritious healthy food\nthen they'll do it because that's your\nDharma right helping a friend is a\nDharma that you can get behind that\ndoesn't have to do with a desire you\nguys see that like it doesn't come from\nthe sense organs helping your friend is\nnot like you're not walking down the\nstreet you're like man that guy in the\ncar next to me he's carrying a bag and\nthat looks like chicken noodle soup and\nhe's carrying it for a friend of his I\nshould really do that right that's not\nhow that works that comes from within\nthat's a value so the biggest problem is\nthat the things that you're the things\nthat drive you forward our desires and\ndesires are not going to stand up that\nonce again like this is coming full\ncircle when I was when we were talking\nabout progress or growth you're thinking\nabout a positive thing right so you're\nlike I'm gonna eat a salad every day and\nI'm gonna lose weight and I'm gonna be\nhealthy and that feels good like that's\nprogress that's growth that's what we\nwant but when you actually do it you're\nnot able to do it because it's actually\ndifficult to do and it hurts like every\nbite of romaine lettuce like hurts you\nright it hurts you deep within your\nmouth because like that's what it's like\nand it's not worth it that's the basic\nproblem desires are not worth the\nsuffering and that's why everyone isn't\na millionaire because everyone wants to\nbe a millionaire but people are wait\naren't willing to work for it they're\nnot willing to subject themselves to the\nthings that they need to do in order to\nbecome a millionaire and that too is\nbecause once again gamers would rather\nwaste time doing nothing than waste time\ndoing something that may not work so you\nwould rather play video games for an\nentire year then take a step forward to\nbecoming a millionaire because that may\nnot work out and that's because it's\nbased in a desire so if you want to get\naway from that you have to base it in a\nvalue facing it in a value is the same\nthing as finding a competing interest is\nthe same thing as finding your Dharma\nbecause if we think about you know like\nif I need a million dollars to like pay\nfor my kids cancer treatment like that's\na different thing you know which\nAmerican health care system aside so\nit changes the way that you you act and\nit changes the way that you think and it\nchanges the most important thing is it\nchanges daughter might changes your\ntolerance for pain it allows you to\nchoose things that are uncomfortable and\nsuck when I want call for 24 hours like\nthat sucks but I do it and I do it\nwillingly because like I realize that\nthere were like people here that I have\nto like take care of and if I don't take\ncare of them like no one's gonna take\ncare of them\nso it's gotta be me and so that's what\nthought amaz so the issue is that you\nguys need to find your autonomy because\nif you can find your Dharma then\neverything else becomes side quests like\nthe problem is that like like losing\nweight is not a main quest\nit's a side quest and the problem is\nthat you treat it like a main quest like\nall I'm doing in my life is losing\nweight no man that's a side quest making\nmoney side quest losing weight side\nquests getting healthy side quest the\nproblem is like no one has a main quest\nthat's what you need you need the main\nquest because in order to fulfill the\nmain quest you've got to lose weight you\ngot to make money like that's how it\nworks right like in a game you go and\nyou get this piece of gear the side\nquest to get the piece of gear doesn't\nactually that's not winning the game\nit's just you need to beat this boss and\nyou need a piece of gear so you need a\nmain quest and that's what anima is duty\nresponsibility that's like what a main\nquest is in an RPG right that's not\nthat's not like an analogy that's like\nthe Dharma of the protagonist is the\nmain quest that's how it works and like\nyou just think about like what they do\nright like they they withstand all kinds\nof pain and suffering because it's like\nso you guys have you like the ultimate\nmain quest and the ultimate Dharma is\nFrodo in the ring Frodo in the ring you\nguys need to go to Mordor and like drop\nthe ring and it's like it's painful and\nit sucks and it's terrible and you're\ngonna be thirsty and you're willing to\ndo it because it's the main quest\nbecause that's your tournament that's\nwhat like the Lord of the Rings is a\nstory about Dharma but the problem yeah\nwhere does your Sam was\nI don't think you guys realize this\nyou're looking at your Samwise\nI am you're Samwise that's what I'm\ndoing I'm samurais I'm not Gandalf I'm\nSam wise right I'm here to help you\nI'm helping you this is what I'm doing\nI'm carrying your pack you're sitting\nthere whining about how you're hungry\nand you want strawberries and stuff like\nthat and I'm keeping your spirits up and\ninside I'm raging at you and want to\nthrottle e because you're such a whiny\nlittle Hobbit but I mean yeah so I guess\nI'm not the actual hero so maybe I'm not\nthe same wise but yeah so like I'm I'm\none of the members of the fellowship so\nI'm helping you guys out but y'all have\nto carry the ring like you've got to\ncarry it to Mordor I can't carry it to\nMordor for you"
