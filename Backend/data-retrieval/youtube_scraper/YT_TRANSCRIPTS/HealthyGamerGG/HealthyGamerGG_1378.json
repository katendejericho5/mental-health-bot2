    "transcript": "so I have a choice as a psychiatrist I\ncan see four people and prescribe four\nmedications and make six hundred bucks\nan hour or I can talk to one person\nabout their feelings and make 200 bucks\nan hour right that's the world we live\nin and it's not good enough like we\ncan't use our standard solutions anymore\nwe have to think outside of the box and\nwe have to face the challenges that\nthere are which is like AoE healing\nthat's what this is about\nI want to say anonymous how to deal with\nclimate change in the possibility of\nsocietal and economic collapse in the\nmid far future I'm horribly depressed\nbecause of it and I in so much pain I\nfeel horrible for wanting to have\nchildren and possibly putting them into\nthis world okay so I you know oddly\nenough I I get this fair amount like in\nmy actual private practice like people\ncome to me and they're kind of say they\nfeel depressed because of like what the\nfuture holds so okay how can I say this\nso like if so either societal or\neconomic collapse is gonna happen so\nthere are three possibilities right one\nis that societal or economic collapse is\ngonna happen the second is that it's not\ngoing to happen and the third is that it\nmay happen so my response to this person\nis like which of those so if you feel\nlike it's inevitable first of all like\nwhere do you get that because I don't\nthink that's the case I mean people have\nbeen you know foreseeing economic\ncollapse apocalypse and stuff since like\nas long as people got together and\ntalked about this stuff right and so you\nknow I I don't know I think human beings\nare like really bad at predicting the\nfuture generally speaking like if we\njust look at it historically there have\nbeen people who have been concerned\nabout the collapse of humanity since\nhumanity became a thing so I think that\nthere's some you know evidence to kind\nof question your thoughts or beliefs\nthere the second thing is that if it is\ninevitable then I don't know exactly\nwhat that means I guess you have to sort\nof sort that out for yourself but my\nsense is that if you think that the\nworld is like destined for failure then\nI think that you know what are you gonna\ndo about it\nis my first question so I think this is\nlike this is a question about Dharma so\nif you think that societal and economic\ncollapse are like gonna happen like what\nare you gonna do about it so you can\nsort of say like oh the world is falling\napart woe is me and I'm gonna feel\ndepressed but I think that the world\nfalls apart or whether things like fall\napart or don't fall apart depends on\nlike your actions and like mine depends\non my actions and it depends on like\ntwitch\nthat's actions right like that's what\nwe're here for we're I mean like we're\nhere to sort of help ourselves we're\nhere to help you know we're here to like\nhelp the world and make it a better\nplace and so if you think that the world\nis like going to hell in a handbasket my\nfirst thought is like what are you gonna\ndo about it\nbecause in my experience if you have a\nproblem and listen to this carefully if\nyou have a problem and you start trying\nto do something about that problem and\nyou start making progress then you will\nbe amazed at how that affects your\ndepression there's actually good\nevidence that there's something called\nbehavioral activation which is an\nevidence-based treatment for depression\nand what behavioral activation is is\nit's like getting people to go out and\ndo things behavioral activation is about\nthe presumption that therapy and\nmedication is not the only way that you\ncan help people who are depressed but if\nyou can get them to like go and do stuff\nif you can activate their behavior then\ntheir depression will get better so if\nyou're depressed because you think the\nworld is gonna fall apart like try to do\nsomething about it and you'll be amazed\nat like what difference that makes for\nyour depression and maybe the world\nwon't collapse because of what you do\nright it's kind of like just go and do\nsomething so I'd say like go plant a\ntree like if you're worried about\nclimate change go plant a treat like if\nthings are screwed and we're all dead\nanyway at least there's one more tree\naround who knows and maybe that one tree\nis gonna be what tips the balance and\nprevents us from like cycling into a you\nknow horrible like carbon emissions\nspiral where like ice is melting and\nmore trapped co2 gets released and all\nthat crap and then it's sort of a\ndoomsday scenario I don't know but I'd\nsay do something this stream is because\nI feel like young people and that's what\nwhat is that a Boomer statement or what\nbut like I'm serious young people\nnowadays nowadays are feeling stuck in\ndirectionless and I don't think it's\ntheir fault to be very clear so I think\nthat like the reason that a lot of\npeople are disillusioned today is\nbecause we were told by the generation\nabove us that there is a particular road\nto success right they said go to college\nget a job\nyou with one income you can get a\nmortgage because this is what worked for\nus so this is the formula for success\nand all you guys need to do is like do\nthis thing and everything will be ok but\nthe circumstances that they lived in in\nthe circumstances that we live in are\ndifferent right like the percentage the\nhours that you needed to work after you\ngraduated from college to pay back your\nloans is like a fraction of what it is\ntoday\nthe prices of homes back then were like\nway cheaper than they are now relative\nto standard income and the other thing\nis like college degrees are not worth\nnearly as much as they used to be right\nso like now it's like you see an\nintro-level position for $30,000 a year\nthat requires 4 that's recommends 4\nyears of work experience it's like\nthat's an entry-level position you're\npaying 30k year and you want 4 years of\nwork experience like that's that's what\nwe face right so you know I mean with my\nparents so they sort of said my dad told\nus one of y'all is gonna be a doctor and\none day all is gonna be a lawyer and my\nbrother is older so he got to choose\nfirst and then after that we you know so\nI became a doctor and they sort of said\nlike oh the way to be happy is to like\njust become a doctor and so I said ok\nfine and so I majored in pre-med but\nlike I didn't care about it right like I\njust couldn't like it felt completely\nmeaningless to me to just go and like\nget some job and be a doctor and like go\nout and like sure is ego behind saving\nlives but that's what it was about it's\nlike I'm gonna be a doctor and then oh\nyeah I say lives oh that's how it is\nright I didn't really care about it and\nso I think the challenges that we face\nare different and I think that in the\ngeneration before us you could sort of\nlive your life and you know you could\nget a job and you had like a pension\nthat your company would like pay out 30\nyears from now like you could get a job\nat one company you could be an employee\nat that company for your entire life and\nthey would actually take care of you\nwhen you retired and you could just get\na job and you could have a family in a\nwhite picket fence and everything was\nhunky-dory\nbut like I think the world demands more\nof us today than it did in the past I\nthink these issues like climate change\nand societal and economic collapse\nrequire more of the average person in\nterms of a contribution than like the\npast like people needed to do in the\npast I think in order to create a better\nworld for all human beings today\nit requires all human beings to pitch in\nand that involves planting trees and\ninvolves like that's the birth of this\nstream was about like ok this is not\nworking right like mental health is not\nworking there are challenges that people\nface their wait list if you see\ntherapists there are people who feel\ndisillusioned there are people who go to\nsee therapists and they get diagnosed\nwith depression they get given a pill\nand sent home because currently the the\ncompensation structure of medicine is to\nprescribe as much medication as you can\nif you're a psychiatrist if you want to\nmake the most money insurance pays about\ntwo hundred dollars for me to sit with\nsomeone on average for one hour and talk\nto them about their feelings and try to\nhelp them understand themselves\ninsurance also pays me $150 to spend 15\nminutes with that same person and\nprescribed them a medication so I have a\nchoice as a psychiatrist I can see four\npeople and prescribe four medications\nand make 600 bucks an hour or I can talk\nto one person about their feelings and\nmake 200 bucks an hour right that's the\nworld we live in and it's not good\nenough like we can't use our standard\nsolutions anymore we have to think\noutside of the box and we have to face\nthe challenges that there are which is\nlike AoE healing that's what this is\nabout\nbecause the challenges that people face\nnowadays are different it's like back in\nmy day I used to get bullied but you\nknow the cool thing is about being\nbullied in school like when I was\ngrowing up in the 80s and early 90s is\nwhen you're done with school you get to\ngo home and the bully doesn't chase you\nnow with like social media like if\nyou're getting bullied at school like\nwhat do you think happens to your\nTwitter account and Instagram account\nlike people are trashing you on that too\nyou can't escape from the bullies now\nthe world is a different place and it\nneeds like different solutions and so I\nget that you feel horribly too\nand that's absolutely like it's a\nreasonable response and I'm not blaming\nyou for feeling that way but I think if\nwe if humanity has any chance of coming\nout of this mess it's gonna be because\nof people like you actually doing\nsomething because of people like me\nactually doing something and I have\nfaith that if we I have faith at the end\nof the day in despite you know what\nhappened last week on on when I tried to\nhop on discord and I put my faith in\nhumanity and I put my faith in twitch\nand and someone let me down but I still\nhave faith in you guys I still have\nfaith in y'all\n[Music]"
