    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about male\ntype anxiety and that may sound weird\nbecause isn't anxiety anxiety but it\nturns out that anxiety is a gendered\nconcept men experience anxiety very\ndifferently for from women and this is a\nbig problem because if we look at our\nresearch on anxiety what we find is\n2third of all people diagnosed with an\nanxiety disorder are women and so what's\nthe reason for that let's just think\nabout that for a second right does this\nmean that women are twice as likely to\nbe anxious as men actually no it means\nthat our definition of anxiety is a\ngendered construct and the way that\nwomen experience anxiety is what we\nthink of as traditional anxiety but the\nway that men experience anxiety is\nactually completely different so male\ntype anxiety is characterized by two\nthings low perceived control and\nphysical symptoms now this may sound\nkind of weird so let me explain what low\nperceived control is who have anxiety\ntheir experience of life is like this\nI'm surrounded by problems that are\nunfixable I sort of feel like I have no\ncontrol over my life I kind of look\naround and I see see situations that I\ncan't fix like my girlfriend is unhappy\nor my wife is unhappy or I keep on\nhaving conflict between my wife and my\nmom and I don't know how to fix this or\nI don't know what to do about my job my\ncareer prospects are crap the economy is\ncrap I can't buy buy a house I can't\ndate like everything is falling apart I\ncan't control my life and everything is\n so you may look at that and think\nbut isn't that everyone like doesn't\neveryone struggle with this isn't just\nthis the normal life and the answer is\nno it turns out that there's a good\nchance that anxiety is at the root but\neven weirder than that is that we have\nit kind of wrong so if we look at the\nworld right now what we see is that\nthere's a lot of problems that I can't\nfix and what we think goes on is that\nthe world is objectively bad I cannot\nfix these things this increases our\nstress and then gives us a perception\nthat we are out of control and we think\nthat's an accurate perception right the\nworld is therefore I can't fix it\nthat's not in my head the crazy thing is\nthat you're right it's not in your head\nit's way weirder than that the weirdest\nthing is we look at research on anxiety\nis not that this stuff is in your head\nbut actually you create the situations\nthat are\nunsolvable because you have this stealth\nanxiety now I know that sounds really\nweird so I'm going to say it again we\nthink okay the world is crap I'm out of\ncontrol right so the the circumstances\ncome first and then maybe Dr K is making\nsome point about oh this is like mindset\nor like cognitive reframing or it's all\nabout perceptions it's about how we see\nthe world and if I change the way I see\nthe world things will be better and it's\nall in my head no no no what's actually\ngoing on is if you have occult anxiety\nthis creates a perception of low\nperceived control and this per\nperception of low perceived control then\ncreates events in your life that are\nunsolvable now if that sounds crazy hear\nme out because we're going to get into\nthe science of it okay I'm going to show\nyouall a lot of different research which\nare going to be pieces of a puzzle the\ntricky thing about this puzzle is that\nit's not going to make sense when you\nsee one particular piece when we stitch\nit all together is when we will see holy\ncrap the way that I am understanding my\nlife and the way that I can get control\nof my life is actually very different\nfrom what I thought so bear with me when\npeople hear that we offer coaching at HG\ntheir first question is like what on\nEarth even is that so here's the basic\nproblem when you struggle with something\nin your life you don't see the problem\nfrom the outside you see it from the\ninside the value of a coach is that they\ncan look at your life from the outside\nthey can understand what's going on and\nthey can help guide you to improve\nthings like motivation accomplish\nshort-term goals and even increase a\nsense of purpose in life and over the\nlong term we also see improvements in\nfeelings of depression and anxiety and\nthe best part is we've had over 100,000\ncoaching sessions and we incorporate\nthat feedback to continually improve our\nprogram so if y'all are interested in\nactually making a change in your life\ncheck out the link in the description\nbelow so this is from a paper called\nmen's anxiety a systematic review so\nlet's take a look at what men's anxiety\nlooks like as such young men reporting\nincreased anxiety severity were more\nlikely to report physical symptoms\nheadaches loss of appetite body Tremors\nand sensations of losing control instead\nof social disruptions tearing and\ninterpersonal distress compared to age\nmatched women so let's understand what\nthis means okay the first thing we've\ngot to do is Define it right so this is\ncharacterized by low perceived control\nand this is characterized by physical\nsymptoms now why is this significant so\nif we look at anxiety diagnoses across\nthe board they are 2 to one in favor of\nwomen so for every two women that's\ndiagnosed with an anxiety disorder we\nhave one man that is diagnosed with an\nanxiety disorder and why is this it's\nbecause our clinical criteria for an\nanxiety disorder are characterized by\nthese other things that are more common\nin women so a lot of these\ncharacterizations are internal feelings\nlike being worried being anxious right\nthat's the word that we use these are\nanxiety disorders but it turns out that\nmen don't feel that anxiety in the same\nway that women do and there are a couple\nof really good reasons for this the\nfirst is that women have more estrogen\nand estrogen as a hormone makes us more\naware of our internal emotional state so\nwomen are able to feel their emotions\nmore easily but it isn't that simple so\nin behavioral observation studies of\nboys and girls boys were\ndisproportionately encouraged by parents\nto confront stressful and fearful\nstimulants whereas girls were more\ncommonly comforted by their parents when\ndisplaying a fearful or anxious response\nso sure estrogen is is at play but then\nthe way that we're socialized is also at\nplay and what boys are taught to do is\nconfront and fix our problems as opposed\nto doing some kind of emotional support\nor\nawareness okay so now we see these are\nlike two reasons why men don't\nexperience anxiety quote unquote\nnormally\nbecause we're actually socialized to not\nfocus on our feelings but to fix our\nproblems okay so this is a second reason\nso this is why men men's anxiety and\nwomen's anxiety is different it's\nbecause the way that we're raised is\nbecause of estrogen so what contributes\nto men's anxiety in contrast higher\nendorsement of masculine Norms including\nrestrictive emotionality restricted\naffectionate Behavior towards other men\nand over heterosexual presentation were\nall associated with increased levels of\nanxiety in young and adult men what on\nEarth restricted emotionality and\nheterosexual Norms hold on a second Dr K\nare you telling me that if I'm straight\nI'm more like likely to experience\nanxiety kind of right so many years ago\nI asked chat hey chat how should I deal\nwith my anxiety and they were like Sagan\nnuts bro and it turns out that they they\nwere right because now we have data that\nshows us that heterosexual Norms I.E\npreference for for a particular kind of\ngenitalia is associated with higher\nlevels of anxiety turns out that's not\nactually what the paper is saying so\nlet's understand this okay what we mean\nby heterosexual Norms is restrictive\nemotionality and sort of burying our\nemotions so the manly man is not very\nemotional right so I'm like a man I'm G\nto fix my problems there blah blah so we\ndon't talk about we fix them like if you\nwe\nfixing that's what we mean okay has\nnothing to do with what your genital\npreference is it's entirely about your\nrestrictive emotionality so this creates\nanother challenge because if we are\nmanly men right we just like good men\nlike as boys we're like be a good man\nwhat this means is we're not aware of\nour internal emotional state which in\nturn means that even though our anxiety\nis high we don't feel anxiety right\ninstead what we see is oh my God this\nsituation is out of control and I can't\nfix it now we get to the craziest part\nwhich is remember that I said that the\nreal tragedy of men's anxiety is that we\nbelieve our life is out of control and\nwe sort of think like oh Dr K is talking\nabout like oh we need to do something\ncognitive right to change my perception\nand then like once I like understand\nthis all in my head then\neverything will be better no no no no no\nthe crazy thing is our low perception of\nself-control doesn't just shape our\ninternal environment it actually creates\nthe problems that are unsolvable now if\nthis sounds insane that's because it is\nso here's another paper fantastic paper\nfrom hour who's at mlan at Harvard so FY\nry's an awesome person um the stress\ngeneration framework posits that\ncharacteristics behaviors or\ncircumstances within an individual's\nlife context contribute to the\noccurrence of dependent stressful events\nso this may sound crazy so what this\nsort of means is that more recently\narbach art and Abella found that low\nperceived control a belief that one may\nhave the limited ability to change views\nof the self world and future contributed\nto Greater dependent interpersonal\nstress the crazy thing about hour boox\nresearch is that it demonstrates that\nlow perceived control isn't just in your\nhead and it's not that you misinterpret\nthe world it is that when you have low\nperceived control which is related to\nmale type anxiety which you can't feel\nwhich we'll get to in a second when you\nhave low perceived control it shapes the\nway that you interact with the world and\ncreates unfixable situations so this a\nsimple example okay so let's say that I\nI'm worried that I can't make my wife\nhappy and so if I sort of believe that\nin some way that will affect my\nbehaviors right I will try a little bit\nless because what's the point in making\nher happy if I'm doomed to fail what's\nthe point in dating if I'm never going\nto find anyone anyway so as we start to\nhave some of these perceptions of low uh\nlow perceived control what the research\nactually shows is that this creates\nproblems in our life it's not that the\nproblem comes first and then I feel like\nI'm out of control it's actually the\nother way around perceived control as\npredictors of anxious symptoms and\nstress so the key thing about this paper\nis that this comes first it doesn't come\nnext this predicts the anxiety this\ncreates the anxiety this creates the\nstress it's not that the stress creates\nthe P perception of low control it's the\nother way around okay here's me and\nhere's the world and the world is\nand then what ends up happening is We\nbelieve We conclude I can't win right\nthis becomes a logical conclusion so\nwhat ends up actually happening what the\nresearch shows us is here is me here is\nmy perception of low control this\ncreates a situation that is unsolvable\nthis then generates stress now this gets\nkind of weirder right there are a couple\nof other things so this perception of\nlow low uh perceived control is anxiety\nthat we are blind to so we don't see it\nokay there's no seeing of the anxiety\nthat's an eyeball we don't see the\nanxiety now why is this important why do\nI believe that anxiety is at the root of\nthis so now we go back to the amygdala\nso see our amydala like men and women\nboth have amigdalas we both have this\n part of our brain like lizards\nhave it too that this is where anxiety\ncomes from the problem is that\nsubjectively we don't experience it as\nanxiety so when the amydala lights up in\na man because of our restricted\nemotionality because of our heterosexual\nNorms because of the way that we're\ntaught to fix our problems we don't feel\nthis anxiety but it's still active and\nlet's understand what the impact of this\nanxiety actually is so let's say I have\na problem that is of five difficulty and\nthen what ends up happening is I have\nfive units of anxiety and then what\nhappens is these combine to create my\nactual perception which is 10 units of\ndifficulty now I know this sounds kind\nof weird but I want youall to just think\nabout this for a second right so think\nabout the friends of yours who are\nanxious and they're worried about stuff\nright so when they're worried about\nstuff How likely is that thing to come\nto pass right so I'm paranoid that oh my\nGod my teacher is going to kick me out\nof class because I sent an email asking\nfor an extension so when anxiety when\nthe amydala is active in our brain this\nisn't that they're they're not dumb or\nanything like that this is literally\nwhat happens in the amydala what the\namydala does is\namplifies the perception of things going\nbad so what it does is it like if if the\nrisk is actually like 10% the amydala\nwill literally amplify it to 20% or 30%\nor 40% okay now this is where things get\nreally tricky so if we have amygdalar\nactivity that we are not aware of\nbecause of emotional restriction now\nwhat we have is we have 10 units of\ndifficulty and the actual difficulty is\nonly five but this is our perception\nover here so now this problem seems\nlarger than it is and this is where we\nget into really tricky things because\nonce it starts to get out of control\nright because we can't handle 10 units\n10 units is too\nmuch then get back to this so\nfurthermore when evaluating socialized\ngender roles and coping Behavior\nindividuals with higher levels of\nmasculinity were more likely to employ\nproblem-based coping regardless of\nbiological sex so what this statement is\ntalking about is that basically like the\nmore masculine you are the more you try\nto fix your problems right and then this\nsuggests a strong adherence to\ntraditional masculine Norms may impact\nexpectant coping behaviors in men\nprompting oriented problem solving\napproaches in in the face of elevated\nanxiety levels so this makes sense okay\nso I'm going to translate this for a\nsecond once again so this means is like\nif you're a dude and you've got a\nproblem in life what do you do about the\nproblem you fix it right that's\nall this is a fancy way of saying the\nmore manly you are the more you just fix\nyour problems because that's the like\nwhat else am I supposed to do with\nproblems right if you're listening to\nthis and you're like Dr K that's dumb\nwhat else are you supposed to do except\nfor fix a problem like what else can you\ndo here here's the problem in contrast\nthere may be a threshold at which the\ntendency to revert to problem-based\ncoping strategies exacerbates anxiety if\nSolutions cannot be reached by men\naccustomed to self- remedy okay previous\nresearch evaluating stress and coping\nsuggests that problem-based coping may\nonly be effective when stressors or\nsituations are controllable or can be\nadjusted what this means is that problem\nbased coping only works if you can fix\nthe problem so then what happens in men\nwhen we can't fix a problem so now what\nlet's go back to our diagram okay so\nthis is important because if we can't\nfix the problem what does it do so now\nwe get to see how everything ties\ntogether so here's what really happens\nhere's me I am faced with a problem and\nthen I have this occult which means\nhidden\nanxiety okay so this problem is five\nunits and this anxiety adds five units\nof difficulty it's like we're playing\nthe game on hard mode and this once we\nstart playing the game on hard mode now\nthis is 10 units of difficulty okay this\nmob is now too high for our level\nbecause we're level five but because of\nour occult anxiety we perceive this as\nlevel 10 as we perceive this as level 10\nthis creates\nstress why does it creates stress it\ncreates stress because if we are faced\nwith problems that we cannot fix what\nhappens we get stressed out right so\nlet's understand this so if I were to\nsay Hey you person who is watching this\nYouTube video I want you to wash your\nhands does this stress you out no I\ndon't need to be stressed out if I'm\nwashing my hands because I am capable of\ndoing it no biggie I can wash my hands\nstress is created when we Face problems\nthat we perceive as unsolvable so as we\nperceive this problem is unsolvable this\nincreases our stress increases our\ncortisol furthermore increases our\nanxiety even more and then also leads to\nphysical symptoms headaches tension\nmuscle aches all this kind of stuff\nnausea dudes have like the just these\nweird like aches and pains and like I'm\nnot sure I need to go to the gym but I\ncan't go to the gym like all this kind\nof stuff happens and then these two\nthings then lead to a perception of low\nperceived control right because now this\nproblem is too big to solve and then\nthis leads to\ndependent stressors these are the actual\nproblems that get created in your life\nthis is the actual sequence of things\nit's not this up here it is actually the\nopposite it is this over here here's you\nhere's a real problem plus anxiety this\nmakes it overwhelming but you don't\nreally see this remember this is we are\nnot able to see see that this creates a\nstress response this then creates\ndependent interpersonal stressors this\ncreates the problems in your life this\nis what the research shows and this is\nthe real tragedy of male type anxiety\nfirst of all why are we not diagnosed\nwith it because most people are not\naware of this picture you all have to\nunderstand this this is put together\nfrom two places I did a bunch of\nresearch but then I also work with a\nbunch of people who are blackpilled so\nwhen I work with people who are black K\nwhat do they say they say this is going\nwrong this is going wrong this is going\nwrong this is going wrong I can't fix my\nlife this is screwed this is screwed\nthis is screwed this is screwed and then\nAlong Comes Dr K now everyone thinks oh\nmy God Dr K is a miracle worker like\nmaybe Dr K can fix me but I can't fix\nall those problems I can't fix any of\nthose problems right I can't fix the\ndating crisis I can't fix this other\nkind of stuff I can't fix any of that so\nit turns out that when I work with\nsomeone who's blackpilled what I really\nTarget is there underlying occult\nanxiety so this whole sequence can be\nbroken apart if you understand how it\nworks and understand where to target\nthings where is the real Inception of\nthis the Inception of this is the unfelt\nanxiety that exacerbates your problems\nthe the real place to Target this is\nwhen your amydala amplifies the size of\na danger right and I want you all to\nthink back to when you were little kids\nand you were scared in your room at\nnight\nand when you were scared if your parents\ntried to tell you hey there's no real\ndanger this problem does not exist could\nyou understand no this problem does not\nexist of course not the child believes\nthat the shadow on the wall is a monster\nit takes this hypothetical fear and\nturns it into a reality and the crazy\nthing about people who are blackpilled\nand they will dispute this is they are\nliving in the same world that we are\nliving in right we're all living in the\nsame world things are hard for everyone\nbut they say oh no no but my chin is\nsmaller and I'm 5'2 everyone has some\nobjective disadvantages I'm not talking\nI'm not saying that but I'm saying\nfundamentally this part we need to\nreally focus on and this has been my\nexperience when we target the anxiety\nwhen we reduce the anxiety this whole\nCascade falls apart so then you are\nfaced with problems that are no longer\noverwhelming once you are faced with\nproblems that no longer feel\noverwhelming then your stress level goes\ndown as your stress level goes down your\nperception of control increases and this\nis the Beautiful Thing Once your\nperception of control increases you\nactually start fixing the problems in\nyour life you stop creating additional\nproblems because of your perception of\nlow self-control and we hear this advice\neverywhere right just get started just\nget started just get started just act\nand this is the tragedy of male type\nanxiety we probably have a bunch of men\nout there maybe as much as 5% of to the\npopulation so one out of 20 men who's\nexperiencing anxiety in some way but\nthey're not aware of it all they see is\nthat the world is black pilled I can't\ndo anything about this I can't do\nanything about this I can't do anything\nabout this I can't do anything about\nthis and the tragedy of that is it is\nthat belief that creates the objective\nsituations and just in your head this\nactually creates the problems in your\nlife so what do we do about it start by\nfirst of all does this picture fit you\nright do you look at the world and is\nyour primary experience of the world hey\nor not may maybe not primary but a big\npart of your experience that I feel out\nof control if you feel out of control\nyou may have this male type anxiety the\nicing on the cake is going to be if you\nalso have these like physical symptoms\nand stuff like that this is going to be\nreally another really important sign the\ncool thing is the way that we're going\nto fix this by all means go see a\ntherapist get a diagnosis start doing\nPsychotherapy all that stuff is really\nfantastic but the couple of things that\nwe need to change are first of all our\nemotional awareness to recognize is my\namydala in a hyperactive state right and\nyou won't feel worried or tearful or\nanxious you'll just be like stressed out\nright so the the the main thing that\nyou're going to feel is stress and\nphysical symptoms and and low perceiv\ncontrol then you have to do the hard\nwork of uncovering that anxiety\nuncovering these distortions uncovering\nthe source of your perception that your\ncontrol is not there in life and as you\ntarget those kinds of things so we have\na whole guide to anxiety we do all these\ndifferent exercises and community events\nand stuff like that basically focus on\nthat anxiety because it's not going to\nlook like anxiety but do all of those\nsame kinds of things so physical\nexercise is really great for men um Mind\nBody practices are really fantastic too\nbut really Target that anxiety and what\nyou will see is something that I've seen\nwith black pillars over and over and\nover again who I've worked with is that\nsomething changes once we start\ndecompressing that emotional energy\nliterally once we start calming down the\namydala suddenly this is a child in a\nbedroom who sees that this is not an\nactual monster this is just a shadow and\nit could be a monster monster could be a\nmonster let's be honest could be a\nmonster things could be bad things may\nnot work out but their their amydala is\nnot amplifying the danger and making it\nfeel more real as that goes away our\nsense of control increases and once we\nhave a perception that we can fix this\ngame of life then things actually start\nto get better we see those dependent\nstressful events start to improve and\nthen their life objectively gets better\nso if you're a dude out there in this\nfits please please please take it very\nseriously consider seeing a professional\nabout it consider working on your\nanxiety and if yall want more\ninformation check out our guide to\nanxiety and the last thing that you can\ndo remember those heterosexual Norms\nlead to an increased experience of\nanxiety that we don't even feel so I'll\nlet you figure out what that last thing\nyou can potentially do is take care\n[Music]\nn"
