    "transcript": "what sucks about it\nwhen I need them he's not here\nhow does that feel dad that's the crowd\nsuper probably that's probably why it\nsucks most\nyou\nalright so Jacob help me understand what\nwe're talking about today and how I can\nbe helpful yeah um I guess I'd say my\nrelationship with my dad isn't the\ngreatest it's definitely not toxic in\nany way I don't think it's okay no not\nabusive in any way but we just seem\nreally disconnected nowadays I don't\nI hardly ever talk to him we don't share\na lot of interests in common okay\nconversations I do have with him are\nlike hey can you go do this for me real\nquick and I'll be like yeah it's fine\nbasically then yeah it sounds like you\nguys have kind of drifted apart yeah um\nit definitely started back when well it\ngot worse I'd say when my mom passed\naway in September of 2018 okay and the\nway I yeah the way I described it to my\ndad they're like how I felt about it was\non I felt like my mom was like the kind\nof like the glue that held me my brother\nand my dad together and it was we were\ntrying to like figure out how to make\nthat work without her and I just I'm not\nreally sure at all okay okay yeah so\nfirst of all what do I how would you\nlike to be addressed\nJake is fine Jake okay because there's\nlike two A's in there so I was yeah\nthere's the two ways was a typo and I\njust left it brilliant man I know okay\nso it sounds like you've you've drifted\napart from your dad and that you're\nunhappy with that yeah um I just feel\nreally disconnected from him and I from\nlike maybe when I was a kid when I was\nin high school and stuff and I was\naround him more and my mom was involved\nand we did like stuff as a family but I\nhaven't I haven't done anything with\nspecifically with my dad in years\nokay and it sounds like I think you it\nsounds like you've made a very important\nobservation which is that your mom was\nkind of crucial to like keeping you guys\ntogether yeah I think I don't have a\nbrother - yeah yeah names Joe\nokay so Joe I I'm turnin Jake down yeah\nhey I just saw the messages he's loud\ncan you keep talking Jake UH one two\ntesting 110-meter am I still allowed\nnoises hey hey man I just saw them on\nmessages okay are we good\nsolos training yeah okay how's your\nIndian\nokay let's try now hello hello testing\none okay is that better Jake can you say\nsomething uh something something one two\ncan you hear me okay all right are we so\ngood okay we're good thank you guys very\nmuch I've told my I don't know if you\nguys have seen this thing this is a\nBoomer device it's called a phone um\nit's kind of like a it's sort of like a\nDM but like voice only so it's a little\nbit different I'm not very familiar but\nI think I've heard about it yeah it's\nkind of like a Twitter DM but it's like\nit's like voice and you have to like you\nhave to it's like a voice call so it's\nit's a weird it's a weird device so\nsometimes I ask my mods to use it\nbecause that's how they communicate with\nboomers like me and yeah it's like it's\nlike a mobile discord basically that's\nexactly what it is it's like it's a\nspecific device that's like a mobile\ndiscord okay but and so you were saying\nyou have a brother\nyeah older younger younger he's 16 I'm\n21 okay what's his relationship like\nwith your dad probably the same I would\nsay from what I noticed anyways um I\npresume he lives with your dad yeah do\nyou guys do yep okay so you guys all\nlive in the same house mm-hmm so what's\nit like at home um\nmy Joe and I do our own thing you he'll\nbe downstairs watching basketball or on\nhis phone or whatever and I'm usually in\nmy room playing a game or on the discord\nnowadays and and when you say your\nbrother and you do your own thing do you\nguys do things together or it's like you\nguys are basically roommates instead of\nfamily basically roommates instead of\nfamily okay and what are you guys room\neights instead of family when your mom\nwas around no I think my mom pushed for\nus to do a lot of things together we\ntook we took trips and like we had like\na movie night and everything okay I feel\nlike we did over yeah sorry go ahead\nno I feel like we just did a lot more\ntogether when she was her own so you use\nthe word pushed so there's a difference\nbetween her pushing to for y'all to do\nthings together and y'all just doing\nmore stuff when she was around true\nright what's the difference there I\nthink she would come up with things for\nus to do and we'd do it uh-huh so what's\nthe so was that an organic process a\nnatural process or was she pushing I\nthink it was more organic okay so it's\nnot like she had to like wrangle you\nguys to do it yeah no I don't know I\ndon't think that because what I'm kind\nof implying is that it's possible that\nyou know the dynamic one is sort of an\nactive process and one is a passive\nprocess like when she was around we just\nused to do more stuff together and the\nother is that you know she may have been\nsomeone who like recognized that you\nguys that an active influence needed to\nbe there for y'all to like all interact\nin the family manner and if she was able\nto see that family dynamic and fulfill\nthat role within the family which is\nusually how things work so we have\ndifferent roles that we kind of play\nwith in the family like there's usually\na patriarch or a matriarch like within\nyou know like a family\nso it may be like a grandfather or like\nyour uncle is sort of like the de facto\nhead of the family where if someone has\na problem like they turn to that person\nsometimes you know does that make sense\nto you yeah so your mom it sounds like\nfilled the role of none'll so the\nquestion is was she just glue or was she\nalso like actively recognizing that you\nguys are kind of individual people and\nthat you all need like effort to be\npulled together what do you think\nI think it's me I think maybe it was\nactive to her um I think she saw like\nthese guys won't do anything together\nunless someone bring something up her\nlike yeah I I think she probably\nrealized that yeah okay is that\nsomething that you had like thought\nabout before this conversation um no not\nspecifically and it wasn't it was\ndefinitely not something I thought about\nuntil she was gone yeah so I think so\nlet me ask you Jake\nso let's say I have a family situation\nwhere you have three people who are\nessentially like somewhat independent or\nor loners or call it whatever you want\nto no judgment and there's one person\nwho kind of ties people together so like\nnot even a family situation but I've\nbeen in friends circles where there's\nlike one person who's kind of the\norganizer right and so like they're the\nperson who's like okay what are we doing\nthis weekend okay we're gonna plan a\ntrip here and what happens in that\nsocial dynamic you're smiling I just\nthought that's me in my friend group\nokay\nso okay yeah right so there's the light\nbulb good job so tell me what are you\nthinking I'm thinking like I'm always\nthe one that hits up the group chat as\nlike hey let's go hang out at whoever's\nhouse let's go to get a bite to eat or\nwhatever that's usually me so when you\nare not around what happens\nto your friends what happens to your\ngroup they they don't hang out I guess\nnobody okay yeah and so well they hang\nout with other friend like not in our\ngroup but your group your nuclear it's\nnot that they be all become antisocial\nyeah and it doesn't sound like you your\nbrother and your dad become antisocial\nit's just y'all's group is not gonna\ncoalesce mm-hmm right that's what I'm\nhearing from you yeah and so what what\ndo you think about that like what does\nthat mean for your family\nwell I'm thinking like I've tried to get\nus all to do stuff I thought hey it'd be\nfun if we like went and saw a movie\nevery now and again like every month or\nsomething and that's one idea that\nsticks out to me and it's it's\nfrustrating cuz like dad is isn't here\nmost of the time he's just not in the\nhouse he's out with his friends he's out\nhe's working and it getting a hold of\nhim is sometimes difficult how does that\nmake you feel kind of sucks\nmaybe well there's like two sides of\nthat coin cuz like I like being\nindependent I like being able to do my\nown thing without having my dad button\nor whatever but I also like having him\naround so I can talk to him and try to\nplan something something to do and yeah\nwhat sucks about it\nyou\nyou\nwhen I need him he's not here how does\nthat feel dad that's the crowd survey\nprobably that's probably why it sucks\nmost yes yeah as you just when I need\nhim he's usually not around or he's\nabout to be busy do you feel guilty for\nneeding him sometimes I feel like a\nbother\nsometimes yeah and then if you feel like\nyou're bothering him what do you do and\nhow does that how do what filings does\nthat create for you\nwhat feelings as they create um what\ndoes it feel like to be a bother to\nsomeone it's just not good so now we're\ncoming upon something really important\nokay mm-hm so a lot of times we have\ndifficulty understanding ourselves and\nwe have difficulty understanding how to\nact and I get the sense Jake that when I\nsense within you more than anything else\nis blindness and I don't know if it's\njust cuz it's dark where you are but\nlike this the way that you are framing\nyour problem is like like you're blind\nlike you sleep you can feel something is\nthere you can feel that there's a\nproblem but you just can't see them\nlook I just that's not right but I don't\nknow in what way it's right like I know\nit's not right but I just can't see it\nand you say you feel that way about a\nlot of things in your life yeah yeah I\nthink so it's not until it's not until\nit comes to like a head or I've come\npast the problem that I realize like oh\nthat's what the issue was great right so\nnow earlier I don't know if you caught\nthe questions that I answered at the\nbeginning of scream did you catch those\nsome of them yeah I didn't catch the\nlast one okay so I was establishing a\ntheme or at least I thought I was let's\nsee if you were twitch at can remember\nwhat that theme was like what's the\nwhat's the theme turn on your monitor\nJake not flow state not intuition\nincorrect incorrect incorrect nope okay\nso I guess I was nothing he go big takes\nresponsibility toilet awareness I love\nto shed so much no no no boredom okay\nwhat did I say about boredom one person\ngot it what was I saying about bored you\ncatch that one yeah the reason\nwell I think like specifically was that\nthe reason you play games is because\nyou're just bored and and yeah so here's\nthe thing right so like remember I was\nI'll just lay it out too far of a\nconnection not not twitch a stats vault\nbecause I know you guys understand that\nyou guys understand a lot so it's it's\nmy fault for not asking not laying\nenough of a foundation so like what do\nwe see when we when when I talk to you\nJake you say like I just saw another\nlightbulb and you're like oh like\nblindness is actually I would feel about\na lot of things in my life right mm-hmm\nso what this tells me is that much like\nlike it's not that books are boring or\nyou know school is boring or things like\nthat it's that you yourself are boring\nknow your dopamine your dopamine\ncircuits are exhausted so you're just\nnot going to enjoy things right there's\nlike a personal component to the way\nthat you interact with the world and\nwhat I'm hearing from you is that\nthere's a personal component like the\nreason like you have a blindness debuff\nand so there are a lot of things in your\nlife which you can sense that something\nis wrong but like it's you who is unable\nto see that that's not a situation\nspecific does that make sense\nmm-hmm and and so and I think part of\nthat blindness is that you have very and\nit's not your fault this is completely\nnormal\nyou seem to be a little bit Alexa thymic\nand what I what alexithymia is is\ninability to determine what your\ninternal emotional status so when I ask\nyou what is it like you say use words\nlike it sucks\nthat's bad right there's no there's no\ncolor it's like you know the direction\nof the feeling is generally negative you\ndon't know if it's shame you don't know\nif it's anger you don't know if it's\nfear like those are wildly different\nemotions and it's really hard like if I\nwere to tell you Jake I'm gonna ask you\nto do something I'm gonna ask you to go\non stream and talk about your feelings\nin your relationships and I think that's\ngonna be scary for some people if I tell\nyou that fear is the emotion that you're\ndealing with what do you think that does\nwith your ability to deal with that\nemotion to deal with it yeah if I tell\nyou you're gonna do something I think\nit's gonna be scary for you what do you\nthink your chances of success are\nlow area probably why cuz I'm oh I'm\nsupposed to be scared and I'll be scared\nright okay so that's a good point right\nso it could engender it could and gender\nlike some amount of like a\nself-fulfilling prophecy is kind of what\nyou're saying that if you expect to be\nscared you're gonna be scared now if I\nsay Jake I'm gonna have you do this\nexperience and it's gonna be bad and\nit's gonna suck like your capacity to\ndeal with that how does that relate to\nif I say it's gonna be scary um I'm not\nsure I guess I'll just be waiting and\nexpecting it to be bad just waiting for\nit to get bad okay so I think that\nthat's a completely fair and reasonable\nanswer my hope is that if you know what\nyou're dealing with your capacity to\ndeal with it will potentially increase\nthat's my hope so you have a good point\nin terms of this there could be a\nself-fulfilling prophecy that if you\nexpect fear you're gonna have fear at\nthe same time I think your problem and I\nhave faith in gamers that generally\nspeaking your problem is like a lack of\ndiagnosis it's not a lack of solutions\nlike I think you're a smart enough guy\nto be able to figure out what to do if\nyou know what the problem is the problem\nis that you don't know what the problem\nis the problem is you're kind of saying\nlike okay there's the symptom which is\nlike my dad and I are not connecting and\nour house seems separate and I ask you\nhow does that feel feel you say it sucks\nright mm-hmm so like all kinds of\nemotions there so like you know there's\na lot about losing your mom I'm sure and\nthat you felt connected to her and she\nprobably was like available to you in a\nway let me know if I'm on the right\ntrack or off the right track but we're\njust gonna fast forward a little bit\nbecause I think I've got a sense of\nsomething she made you feel like when\nyou needed something you weren't a\nburden yeah right and so like you could\nfeel you didn't feel alone because you\nfelt this connection with her and you\nknow you're 21 you know you're not fully\ngrown and all that kind of stuff and\nlike she had an open door for you she\nnever made you feel like a bother\nwhen\nneeded something from her mm-hmm\nyeah and now that's missing from your\nlife and then you go to your dad and\nthen he makes you feel like a burden\nright like he makes you feel like you're\nlike bothering and he's got like better\nstuff to do and then like if a kid feels\nlike they're a burden what are they\ngonna do like stop stop bothering\nsomeone yeah exact which is right which\nis what I do yeah I just come in my room\nand I HAP's absolutely right mm-hmm and\nso are you how do we understand that is\nthat like like what's motivating you to\ngo to your room it's important I mean\ninstead of talking to your dad oh I\ndon't want to but like I just don't want\nto bother yeah you don't want to bother\nhim so is that is that like fear or\nshame that's keeping you in your room is\nshame probably okay now here's the other\nthing is there compassion or love\ndriving you to your room like I love him\nso I don't want to bother him absolutely\nwhat do you think is there a concern\nyeah yeah there absolutely is weird huh\nyeah really weird we don't think of love\nis an emotion that keeps us away from\nother people especially our family\nmembers but it's absolutely there and\nthat's why you can't it's such it's such\na bizarre concept you care about your\ndad you don't want to inconvenience him\nyou don't want to be a burden for him\nand it's because if I don't care about\nsomeone who the [ __ ] cares if I burn in\nthem true yeah right yeah it's like if I\ngo to Mickey D's and I get like some\nchicken nuggets like I don't care that\ny'all are busy I want my chicken nuggets\nI don't care how busy you are I'm here\nfor my chicken nuggets true yeah but\nwhen you need something from your dad\nwhen you're hungry for something you go\nto him and you actually like care about\nhim\nand the the the bizarre thing is that\nyour love for him actually like drives\nyou away yeah because you put him yeah\ngo ahead\nwell like a things I've told to other\npeople are like he's he's he's an adult\nor whatever he can do whatever he wants\nI'm not getting into getting it in his\nway like especially when he's like back\ndating and stuff people ask me how I\nfeel about it it's like he can do\nwhatever he wants he's okay grandpa\nthere's oh okay a lot of here\na lot here okay so the first thing is\nhow does it make you feel that he's\ndating other people he can do it he can\ndo that okay whatever so let's define\nthings he can do what he wants to Jake\nand I don't mean to sound condescending\nI just think this is I just can't help\nmyself\nand you see no you have this so fight\nyou can tell me to go I think is cool f\noff at any point okay if I asked you if\nI asked like if I could take a\nten-year-old kid and I asked them what\nare the different feelings a human can\nfeel I don't think one of the answers\nI'm gonna get is he can do whatever he\nwants\nthat is not feeling yeah so when I ask\nyou a question how does it make you feel\nand your responses he can do it or\nthat's not a feeling that's your\nblindness that's the blindness debuff\nwhat is the feeling respect no oh so\nthat's so okay that's a beautiful answer\nlet's so let's understand what Jake did\nJake did something very very special\nthere he reverse engineered the feeling\nbased on his words he said someone who\nsays you can do whatever you want to is\nsomeone who feels respect for another\nperson that's how you got to that\nfeeling it's not actually what you feel\ndoes that make sense\nsure because you were like that's me\nrespecting my dad\nright when you say that that's you\nrespecting your dad yeah I think so\nokay so respect and telling encouraging\nthe independence of another human being\nor those positive feelings or negative\nfeelings absolutely\nso I'm gonna ask you a question and I\nwant you to just give me a direction\nwhen I ask you Jake how do you feel\nabout your dad dating other people is\nthe emotion that you feel in here\npositive or negative its negative that's\nnot [ __ ] respect you know right\nmm-hmm\nso very good\ngood job it starts with directions it's\na good or is it that it's a bad feeling\nbecause that's a defensive statement I\nthink this you're gonna be able to\nunderstand because you're very good\nanalytically he can do whatever he wants\nto is a defensive statement from you\nit's something that you're saying to\nprotect yeah tell us yeah explain it\ntell us what you just figure that so I\ndon't have to reveal how I actually feel\nabout it I say that so people stop\nasking me about how I feel about it\nvery good yeah so how do you feel about\nit not good it scares me I think good\nsee that's an emotion I'm this is\nemotion what scares you about it one of\nI feel like well okay I have to describe\na scenario like he was dating a girl a\nwhile back and she was around the house\na lot more than his current girlfriend\nand every time I saw her in the house um\nI just got really aim like it would make\nme angry\nthat she wasn't here very long and like\none night I couldn't find my keys and\nshe was in my room helping me and I just\ncouldn't take it like I had wanted her\nout I'm out of the house like I kind of\nfreaked out yeah man I really made me\nangry yeah yeah [ __ ] [ __ ] that [ __ ]\nwe're trying to help you find your\nGloria oh my god how big all of her\ntrying to help you with a task how dare\nshe\nout of here [ __ ] we don't need that's\nhow you felt right so what I said yeah\noh wow yeah so Jake help me how buddy\nwhat the is that what's going on there\nman\nI think it might come from a place like\nshe's replacing my mom sure cuz I\nespecially I she would um she yeah she\ncooked us like dinner one time and for\nsome reason I just wasn't I was mad I\nwas just like don't I don't want you to\ncook me dinner I can cook for myself\nblah blah blah you cook at me did it\nyeah dare you how dare you do these nice\nthings how dare you show me kindness oh\n[Music]\noh oh all right sometimes I swear to God\ndiscord cannot handle what's going on in\nthe interview yeah I totally it's like\nthe servers are like this is too much\nthis is way too much too much okay so\nfirst of all Jake I want to I just want\nto say fantastic job dude you're doing a\nfantastic job I've seen more light bulbs\ngo off in your in your on your face in\nthe last 30 minutes then it's a good job\nso I think that the reason that that's\nactually really important is because\nit's hard to sometimes face the things\nthat parts of your mind are actually\nshutting down\nlike they're parts of your mind that are\nactually trying to like keep these\nthings hidden from you and protect you\nfrom them and the weird thing is like\nthere's some weird like flipping going\non with like positivity and negativity\nwe're like she's trying to do this nice\nstuff for me and you feel like anger and\nrage and then you know you say these\nrespectful nice things about your dad\nbecause you love him and you care about\nit but you feel on the inside is like\nnegative so like what's going on there\nokay do you have thoughts or questions\nat this point um yeah but can we like\ncome back around like a continue the\nconversation come back okay I just gotta\nthink about this totally relevant I'm\ntrying to figure out how to tie this\nstuff together to for you in a way that\nso I feel like we're halfway there right\nokay yeah does that make sense yeah you\ndon't quite know like we're not clearly\nnot done yet and you understand\nsomething but like you're still confused\nmm-hmm so I'd like to just figure out\nhow to not have you feel confused but I\ndon't know how to do that so I just need\na second okay well maybe maybe I can ask\nmy question yeah before something um so\nlast year I was I went early in the year\nI went to like therapy and stuff and I\ntalked about this sort of little\ntherapist and\nhe had said that it's possible my dad's\njust incapable of an emotional\nconnection and I don't I don't even know\nwhat that means to start like of course\nhe is like but I just don't know how to\nwrap my mind around that I guess yeah so\nlet's not try to wrap our mind about it\naround yeah so Jake how did it how did\nit make you feel to hear the therapist\nsay that your dad was incapable of\nemotional connection um I felt defensive\nI was like what do you mean like I\nactively argued with him about it I\nthink I was like what do you mean like\nhe loves my mom obviously they had a\nreally good relationship he's done a lot\nof things for us bobbling yeah\nso I think that was an appropriate thing\nbecause that sounds so I wasn't there\nthat therapist knows way more about your\nsituation so big caveats but I think\nthat's stupid and very probably could've\nbeen yeah and I think the reason you\nrebelled against it is because so here's\nwhat I found in therapy when I say\nsomething to someone this isn't therapy\nby the way but just general bit okay so\nlike because case in point you know I'm\nsaying things to you that actually makes\nsense\nand therapist apparently do the opposite\nokay so this is what I found when you\nsay something to someone like you're the\nexpert right like I'm actually not the\nexpert like this has to be very clearly\nunderstood it's my job to say things to\nyou and for you to tell me yes you're\nright or no you're wrong and like what\ndo like I can come up with some\ncomplicated like formulation and that's\nwhat therapy is about is like coming up\nwith these like really complicated\nindividualized formulations this is not\nthat this is just talking about a\nsnapshot of who you are what you\nexperienced in 30 minutes what can we\nunderstand about you it's not about\nfixing anything it's just about what can\nwe see within you\nand I think the reason you rebelled\nagainst it is first of all so the two\nreasons you could repel one is because\nyou can't live up to the concept you\ncan't accept the consequence of what\nthat means for you which is that you\nlost one parent and you're gonna lose\nanother one\nbasically emotionally so it's possible\nthat that's going on but my sense is\nthat you've probably recognized that\nhe's capable of emotion and that it's\njust wrong and like the thing that\ninfuriates me the most is like when when\nyou respond in a negative fashion\ntowards that statement the therapist is\nprobably thinking that's a defense\nmechanism on your part and that they're\nthey're gonna be more convinced that\nthey're right but like it infuriates me\nokay yeah like one of the things that I\ndislike the most about therapy and sorry\nI'm gonna get off on my soapbox for a\nsecond is that there's no such thing as\na falsifiable hypothesis a therapist can\nnever be wrong if they're if you\ndisagree with them that's just denial\nand they're right and if you agree with\nthem will they're right and then they\ncan always dig for what's underneath\nwhat's underneath what's underneath\nwhat's underneath like there's no bottom\nof the pit it's just an endless pit of\nhypotheses until they find something\nthat's right or you leave because\nthey're not helping you and then they're\nlike yeah he just couldn't handle it\nonce you do and just couldn't and\nthere's just no like it so that bothers\nme personally about therapy like that's\nwhy part of the reason I don't like\ndoing it because there's no way to know\nwhen you're wrong like you can't prove a\ntherapist wrong anyway so Brant is over\nso let's kind of come back to you okay\nI'm gonna have to think for a second\nagain okay\nokay so we can go in one of two\ndirections we've got about half an hour\nleft or maybe a little less so one is I\ncan try to tell you how to face your\nactual situation in the house and\nactually make a change in the way that\nyou interact with your dad and your\nbrother or we can talk about what's\ngoing on inside you I don't think it's\ngonna be easy to do both both of them\ninvolves both of it but like what do you\nwant at the end of the next thirty\nminutes do you want to understand\nyourself better or do you want something\nof a game plan to like go in to your\nfamily situation I want to understand\nmyself better okay okay what\npisses okay so let's talk about why you\nget pissed off when people that you're\nyour dad date try to okay so then this\nis our goal I'm gonna try to map as many\nemotions as we can in 25 minutes they\nare going to decide okay and the goal\nhere is once you see the emotions you\ndon't want them to hold power over you\nthe way that they do mm-hm and by power\nover you this is what happens she comes\ninto your room and and starts to help\nyou look for things and then something\nweird happens inside you\nsome like coiled serpent Rises and takes\ncontrol of your mind and then you tell\nher to get the hell out of your room and\nyou as a human being don't want to do\nthat right can we like do you want to do\nthat or you know yeah I I I think I\napologize to her later on it wasn't\npersonal against you yeah yeah so like\nlike you don't want that thing to\ncontrol your life we're not saying it's\nbad we're not saying it's evil we want\nyou to be in the driver's seat you're\npiloting a mech and you have a keyboard\nand a mouse and like you control the\ncharacter it doesn't control itself\nright that's what we want so and then\nyou came up with this beautiful once\nagain canned answer of oh I didn't want\nher to replace my mom I don't think\nthat's what it was\ndoes it feel like you were afraid of her\nreplacing your mom no okay good\nso let's start there right that's\n[ __ ] [ __ ] answer and it's the\nkind of thing that oh my god therapist\nloved it oh I was afraid of him\nreplacing his mother it's a deep\npsychological conflict they just eat\nthat they take a big-ass spoon and they\nstick it in that bowl of oatmeal and\ncereal or whatever pudding like and they\njust like scooping that it's [ __ ]\nyeah okay you want me to just lay it on\nhere you want me to walk you to it lay\nit on me\nyeah well see jealousy I think you're\njealous\ncuz they get to spend time with my dad\nand I don't there you go how does that\nfeel it feels correct right because\nyou're a you're a what when it comes to\nyour dad what are you when it comes to\nyour dad his son\nyeah and how does he how does he make\nyou feel when you want is time\noh well burden yeah and what is she not\napparently absolutely how do you here\nhow's that set it's frustrating I think\nyeah\ntart right mm-hmm and like you know what\nmakes it like so this is the other thing\nis jealousy is it the root but then like\nyou know what really pisses you off is\nthat you're jealous of someone who's\nactually a nice person that you have\nnegative feelings towards someone who\nactually doesn't deserve it yeah I think\nthat's wrapped up in there what do you\nthink yeah I agree\num like I when she was in my room\nlooking through my stuff I ate it was\njust very uncomfortable I didn't want\nher there I was really angry and oh it\nwas like keep people you just said I had\nit tight in my head but I can't so\nthere's the jealousy right because she\nyour dad makes time yeah yeah she was\nbeing a nice person and I was over here\nbeing angry at her for no reason\nin my head it felt like no reason I\nguess yeah yeah exactly right because\nit's not fair to her and you're a decent\nguy yeah that's the root of your\nproblems is that this isn't this isn't a\nstory of shame and fear this is a story\nof caring about your dad not wanting to\nburden him trying to make his life\neasier and blaming yourself for feeling\njealous of someone who was nice and you\nknew that that wasn't right and you beat\nyourself up for it and that's what\ncaused you to blow through the roof it's\nbecause you knew that what you felt\nwasn't right and that what you were\ndoing wasn't right and you're in\ncapability to control yourself is what\nreally like sends things over the\nover-the-top yeah how are we doing good\nit's like it's like the I see the\nblindness\nthing here especially what do you mean\nby that like I was just I felt that\nthose emotions were not fair to her\nI couldn't understand understand why I\nwas feeling that way yeah yeah I\ncouldn't see you know and so here's the\nthing so now we're gonna tie things back\nokay so there's there's the interaction\nwith her but the interaction with her is\ntied to the relationship with your dad\nthose are if the relationship with your\ndad was different this interaction with\nher would never happen does that make\nsense yeah so let's just like let's try\nto tie things back very cleanly okay so\nshe's helping you out she's a decent\nperson and at the beginning of this you\nfeel actually we're gonna start at the\nend so you feel frustrated with yourself\nfor being angry at someone who is\nclearly nice and the reason that you're\nso you there's frustration with yourself\nor anger towards yourself that's one\nemotion another emotion is anger with\nher now why are you angry with her we've\nalready talked about it I'm just right\nbecause she gets to spend time with my\ndad there you go see beautifully said\nright it's not even gentle it's she gets\nto spend time with my dad and I do not\ndo you guys see you guys see the\nsimplicity and truth of that statement\nthat's the core of it jealousy even that\nis like too much of a psychologically BS\nterm she gets to spend time with my dad\nmy dad wants to spend time with her he\ncarves out time in his day to spend time\nwith her and he does not do that for me\nyeah it doesn't seem like you wants to\nspend time with me yeah that's the next\nthing right it doesn't seem like he\nwants to spend time with me beautifully\nsaid simple clear and that makes you\nfeel like what\nangry again I don't know angry yeah yeah\nangry at who um my dad's girlfriend and\nwell I guess kind of my dad there right\nso we got to go deeper buddy mm-hmm so\nnow we're going back so you feel angry\nwith your dad yeah I feel like I\ndefinitely feel like I've made attempts\nto spend time with him and connect and\nhe just doesn't like see that I'm doing\nthat or he ignores it I don't know what\nhe's doing you know how does that make\nyou feel worse even more angry\nyeah yeah right so it's tough so your\nproblem is not one of isolation or\ndisconnection your problem is one of\nanger mm-hmm among guys thanks well we\ndid like like some personality test and\nI got a 17 in anger I was the highest of\nall the mods and stuff yeah\nso you're upset with your dad right yeah\nand now here's the really really crazy\nand devastating thing for you to feel a\ndifferent way how does that how we bring\nyou to peace what has to happen for you\nto be at peace Jake I just stopped being\nangry at my dad I\nI guess understand why he's not spending\ntime with me incorrect that is the sort\nof right answer but this is I'm gonna\njust say this very bluntly you have to\nunderstand that this is not all on you\nany answer to that question that begins\nwith the word I is incomplete\nthis must be clearly understood do you\nget that yeah you're nodding what do I\nmean because I feel like I'm being made\nwe have to understand why yes he must\ntake responsibility for your feelings he\nmust take responsibility for his role in\nyour relationship and the sad thing the\nsad bitter truth that I have to tell you\nJake is that personal growth is a shitty\nsecond hand answer to your situation and\nI know that I advocate for personal\ngrowth and you're doing a wonderful job\nbecause you're a member of our community\nand you've clearly paid attention and\nyou're growing and you're learning but\nthe first thing that you have to\nunderstand is that there is a share of\nthis that Falls Stan mmm-hmm and I would\nbe as far as to say so this is also\nsomething that therapists don't do they\ndon't assign blame I think he's doing a\nbad job now is it excusable possibly is\nhe grieving absolutely should we be\ncompassionate absolutely so you've heard\nme talk about Dharma yeah yeah so I\ndon't think he's doing his Dharma and\nthis is where like you have trouble\nblaming him and holding him accountable\nbecause you love him\nbecause you understand grief and because\nyou care about it mm-hmm you're doing a\ncouple of very devastating and subtle\nthings the first is giving people an\nexcuse for not treating you the right\nway and we do those two people that we\nlove there's a big difference between\nsaying you shouldn't have treated me\nthis way and I forgive you for it\nand it's okay to treat me this way\nbecause you are grieving too do you\nunderstand the difference between those\ntwo statements yeah yeah I think so yeah\nhelp me understand what the differences\num because in one scenario who keep\ncontinuing to treat me this way yes\nthere's a difference I'll say them again\njust be okay no you won't be okay with\nit right yeah but I'll let it happen so\none of them is there's a difference\nbetween admitting that someone treated\nyou wrong and forgiving them for it\nright for you to say to your dad\nI lost my parent and in that moment in\nin 2018 I felt like I lost both of you\nand because that's how you feel like you\nlost yeah that hurt a lot on your little\nbit yeah yeah\nbody blow okay yeah okay just take a\nminute no I'm good I can don't move away\nfrom the feelings don't gloss over we're\nnot gonna we're not gonna keep going\njust close your eyes I've already done\nI'm gonna hurt he done it yeah you did\nit so fast so try to go back there it\nwas a moment where you moved your hand\nin front of your face that was the\nmoment where that came out what was the\nfeeling there was both it's just sad I\nguess\nyeah really sad\nyeah man you think yeah so this is what\nI'm saying buddy whose fault is it that\nyou lost two parents in 2018 I don't\nknow well for one of them we don't I\nmean I don't know what happened to your\nmom but like you know your dad has a\nhand in that right we could blame cancer\nI guess I don't\nyeah so you could blame cancer for your\nmom who do you blame for losing your\nother parent my dad absolutely so this\nis what I mean so there's a difference\nbetween blaming someone and forgiving\nthem and making excuses for their\nbehavior and I'm not saying that the\nexcuses are not fair I think they're\nreasonable and justifiable I think his\nbehavior is understandable and expected\nand therefore he deserves your\nforgiveness but that I cannot stress\nthis enough if you want peace of mind\nyou must admit a wrong and then forgive\nnot excuse the behavior huge difference\nnight and day one will lead to the\nsituation that you're in now which is\nyou make excuses you cover for him you\nlove him you feel like a burden you care\nabout him and you are tortured inside\nyou're being eaten alive mm-hmm it'll\nkeep things smooth day to day the\nmotions that are positive because you\nlove him and so you just take all of\nthat anger and that hurt and you just\nstick it in there you just stick it way\ndown I take it out on my league\nteammates is where I put it\nokay take it on your league teammates\nthese [ __ ] who are cooking you food\nand helping you find things right mm-hmm\nso if you want peace with your father\nfirst of all he's got to step up\nright and you can ask him you can help\nhim to do that because he may be\nstruggling too so like I think you know\nhe has a Dharma in this situation\nbecause he's the parent you're the child\nso I think more of it falls in my mind\nthis is my black and white way of\nthinking and this is not you know in\ntherapy no one gets blamed for anything\nbut I think he's not doing his thurman\nwhich does he have it excuse for\nabsolution we'd be compassionate\nabsolutely but is he stepping up no he\nneeds to be twice as present he's got to\nmake up for two parents mm-hmm right\nthat's his Dharma that's his Karma is it\nfair to him absolutely not but his life\ndoes not and this is something that I\nwant everyone understand as well\nfairness has nothing to do with whether\nyou do or not is it fair to him\nabsolutely not he lost his wife he lost\nthe glue to the family he lost the way\nthat he connected to his sons so is\nthere compassionate AB absolutely should\nthere be forgiveness I certainly hope so\ndoes his does he deserve to suffer\nabsolutely not\ndoes it suck for him absolutely and he's\nstill not doing his Dharma and oddly\nenough I think your road forward\ninvolves blame right you've got it you\nyou're never gonna heal unless you\nassign what is yours and you assign what\nis it it's like if you need if you're\nfighting a boss and you have like a\nhealer and you're playing a tank and the\nhealer is an NPC and the healer never\nheals you like it's not your fault that\nyou died but you take everything on\nyourself yeah it's just it's just not\ngonna work right and so then the other\nthing that you've got to do is is just\nthink about you know how you approach\nhim and understand that part of the\nreason that you retreat so easily to\nyour room is because all this crap in in\nyou like that you love him that you care\nabout him that you don't want to blame\nhim but you do blame him you do blame\nhim and that blame is killing you it's\neating you alive\nbecause he lost his wife - mmhmm yeah I\nreally does hurt my god what hurts\nlike blaming him because because I do\ntry to like cover for him and I help\nhelp him and I wish him the best but\nlike I I guess I not until right now I\nhaven't admitted that he I am blaming\nhim Yeah right so now we see a pattern\nwithin you that you blame yourself for\nthe way that you feel go ahead you\nfinish it I'm angry with myself because\nI blame him for not doing his Dharma and\nand who else have you been angry with\nhis ex his ex-girlfriend absence because\nof your feelings towards them you blame\nyourself for your feelings so that's\ngotta suck right okay thoughts questions\num I'm just thinking about other aspects\nof my life where I blame myself for\nfeeling the way I did oh yeah you know\nwhen you said earlier so now that's the\nbeautiful statement so I think now we're\nweird a good closing point he said I'm\nblind in many areas of my life I would\nsuspect I would put money that that\nblindness is this thing that the thing\nthat you blind yourself most to is\njudging yourself for the way that you\nreact to situations yeah that you think\nare unfair and make you a bad person I\nthink that's true yeah there we go\nnice buff cleanse okay so let's talk you\nhave thoughts questions I'm not just\nthoughts I guess was really cool to do\nthis I really appreciate you taking the\ntime you're very welcome and I really\nappreciate you coming on cuz I think I\nthink twitch chat i think twitch chat\nfeels the same way right so these are\ncommon things right we're good people\nand life gives us negative feelings\nbecause sometimes the ones that we love\ndon't do things that are nice to us\nthat's just like like that's not that\nuncommon and because we love them it's\nbizarre like what's driving you so now\nyou understand so now let's talk about\nbehavioral change for a second how can\nyou change things the first is that when\nyou go into your room understand that\nsome of it is feeling like a burden and\nfeels bad man but some of the reason\nthat you're retreating is out of love\nbecause you care about him and you\nrecognize he's hurting too and if he\nneeds solace with like another woman and\nlike wants to move past your mom and\nstuff like that day you actually don't\nblame him for that and he can't do that\nit takes like he still owes you guys\nsomething right it's not fair for him to\ndo that at your expense hmm if he makes\nhimself unavailable because he's dating\nwomen like that's not right and if you\ndon't have control over that but you\nshould know what is right and what is\nnot in your mind to attain peace of mind\nbecause if you if you kind of point this\nout to him in I don't that's hard right\nokay so you don't just go to him and say\nthis is what's going on cuz he's not\ngonna understand so just show them the\nvolume yeah yeah I mean you could\nshowing you the vaad may not be a bad\nidea but but I think it starts with a\nconversation yeah you have any idea like\nI mean I can share a couple of thoughts\nbut you have any idea like how to start\nthat conversation I think I've tried to\nstart that conversation but at the time\nI just I wasn't sure what the issue\nreally was excellent I mean not next\nyeah do this thing you know what I mean\nright that I've realized that yes yes\nyeah yeah and it's excellent that you\nrealize that you couldn't have the\nconversation because you couldn't see\nyeah so so what do you think are the key\npoints of the first conversation I think\nI need to make it clear that we both\nhave a responsibility to each other\nand we both like to have two equally put\nin to this relationship if we have to I\nfeel like he's not putting in enough\nokay\nI would say that's actually the goal of\nthe conversation that's not where you\nstart I would start by saying I feel\nlike since mom passed away we haven't\nbeen a family and she was I've said that\nto him before and what does he said he\njust kind of like he like passively\nagrees and then I and then I like I try\nto articulate how I feel about the whole\nscenario and I just couldn't like okay\nand basically we just and the\nconversation I do it every year so I\nwould I would start with I would think\nabout the first emotion maybe sharing\nwith him is that you feel like a burden\nasking him for his time mm-hmm because\nif he passively agrees like you wanna\nyeah I think it's I think it's gonna be\ntough so ideally what you guys I think\nthis is a prime case for something like\nfamily counseling by the way so I think\nif you guys have access to something\nlike a family therapist this is exactly\nwhat you should do we uh did the back\nwhen my mom was around a long time ago\nokay so so you could just concretely ask\nyour dad you know you can talk to your\nbrother and your dad saying like hey I\nthink this is important would you be\nwilling to do it so if he's a passive\nagree er then what you have to do is\nmodify the way that you talked to him by\nmaking things concrete asks mm-hmm and\nyou can say like I don't want to burden\nyou but I do feel like this is important\nfor our relationship\nour health and I feel like we're\ndrifting apart and in the past you sort\nof agreed with that but I think we need\nto take some kind of concrete steps to\nstay together mm-hmm is this important\nto you\nyes very yeah you asked him that oh yeah\nyeah okay right and then you prepare\nyourself for the response mm-hmm\nand the response may not be if it's\nmaybe some kind of lukewarm yeah and\nlike then that [ __ ] sucks for you I\ndon't even know what that emotion is\nlike yeah but I mean probably some kind\nof really bad disappointment and stuff\nlike that and then you know at some\npoint you have to you can't make someone\ndo their time right but I would be\npretty concrete with him because it\nsounds like a lot of stuff is like\nunsaid and ambiguous like you would be\nsurprised like he may feel like you need\nspace and that he may have recognized\nthat you value your independence so he\nmay actually think that he's doing you a\nfavor by like not interfering with your\nlife and stuff like that\nyeah but I would kind of start with you\nknow having a conversation with sort of\nshape sharing that you feel like\nsometimes asking your first time is a\nburden and then you want to be spending\nmore time together and I think you have\nthe tiger moth I've gone I've asked him\nto spend like I've in conversations in\nthe past about spending more time\ntogether and he all ever every single\ntime the answer I get is like we just\ndon't have that much in common\nknow how to deal with that cuz like I\nmean I mean we we do I think that he\njust I think he thinks I just enjoy\nplaying video games and that's like it\nI'm like I so that's tough\nyeah so here's I don't have a okay no no\nno I think this is important because at\nthe end of the day you know we're about\nactually changing people's lives not\ndoing therapy so so if he says something\nlike that I think you've got to ask him\nhow important do you think it is for a\nfather and son to share interests in\norder to spend time together do you\nthink the important thing like when I\njust asked him that yeah because it's\nnot like I mean I shared very few\ninterests with my dad but we still hung\nout yeah I don't think it's very\nimportant\nyeah and so you can say like yeah I\nagree that we don't share interests and\nI still want to spend time with you\nbecause you're my father\nor you can say that you know agree to\nthe statement what do you think are you\ninterested and if you really want to go\nhard this is probably damaging but if\nyou feel like you want a little little\nof the [ __ ] out you can say do you\nthink having a son who doesn't share\nyour interests is worth spending time\nwith right because that's actually what\nhe's saying\n[Music]\nlike if you I mean you have a lot of\ndifferent golf clubs in your golf cart\nright hmm hard to put it I tend to pick\nthe driver and just send it home yes\ntime right so like you're a sawed-off\nshotgun kind of guy mm-hmm and and so\nlike sometimes like that's something\nlike it's like a sniper rifle like high\npenetration but like to the point it's\nnot you're not like it's not spraying\nprey so you know you know I think you've\ngot to decide like what feels right in\nthe moment or you can say like dad I\ndon't have to be blunt like I know we\ndon't share a lot of interests but I\nthink we share more of them than you\nthink\nand I think we've spent so little time\ntogether I don't think you know what my\ninterests are yeah MMN and see what he\nsays and then if he continues blocking\nand stuff I think unfortunately what\nthat means for you is that you know he\njust may not be ready yet and if he's\nnot ready yet that that sucks for you\nbut it sucks for you and you continue\nliving your life and you make sure that\nyou don't let that happen to your\nbrother because you haven't thought\nabout to him that if your dad doesn't\nstep up you have to sorry yeah right so\nyou can also have this conversation with\nyour brother or you and your brother can\nsit down with your dad or whatever but I\ndefinitely I think I spend more time\nwith my brother than he does yeah so\nthen you have you have the dharma of\nbeing what for your brother\nwhat roles do you film if your dad\ndoesn't step up the patriarch yeah so\nyou're an older brother and what else\nare you what roles does your dad have\nfor you um both parents absolutely if\nyour dad isn't around what roles do you\nhave for your brother the role both\nparents plus older brother plus older\nbrother\nOh sick you know three cool right\nand is that fair to you absolutely not\neveryone's asking about the Padma so now\nyou guys see it right this is what the\nautumn eyes it's not complicated it's\nnot grandiose it's not saving the world\nit's being more than you can possibly be\nfor one human being mm-hmm I think I'm\nthem fairly sure yeah good so maybe a\ngood place to stop for the day what do\nyou think yeah I agree you want to do\nsome meditation sure what does the\ndoctor recommend Shadow blind for four\nfor the best mods for supporting me and\nloaf and Moses and kami I can't forget\nkami and never you guys are the best I\nwant also wanted to say that Moses isn't\njust picking mods I signed up to do this\na long time ago yeah dude you're the\nfirst mod that's come on so I think\nwe're yeah they're about you're not\nhaving nepotism but let me just think\nshut up Caden - I'm trying to decide so\nI feel like um I feel like you need\nstrength okay because I think the task\nthat you have ahead of you is not easy\nI'm just trying to think about what\npractice I can teach you over the\ninternet that will give you strength and\nI can't chant today because I'm gonna\ncough but chanting would be a good one\nokay so I'm gonna ask you to sit up\nstraight okay\ncan you sit cross-legged yeah I was the\nwhole time yeah okay so sit cross legs\nbut with your back up straight mm-hmm so\nI want you to so just watch me so we're\ngonna start by keeping our keep your\nhands in front of you like this so make\nkind of like in the Mustang and what I\nwant you to do is you see how my elbow\nso oftentimes them a must a looks like\nthis with elbows in an angle but I want\nyour elbows to be parallel to the ground\nand relax your shoulders right so do you\nsee my posture so it's it's and then\nwhat do you feel in your hands or do you\nkind of feel the pressure from your\nelbows I don't know how else to put it\ndoes that make sense so like with this\nyour wrists are gonna be relaxed but\nwith this your your wrists are gonna\nfeel pressure so now what I want you to\ndo is close your eyes and then just very\nslightly so you can relax your elbow\nsung and then I want you to just\nseparate just a tiny tiny amount so\ncreate a tiny gap between your hands\nI just saw your eyebrows go up what did\nyou feel\nokay so close your eyes so just focus on\nyour hands tell me what you feel I feel\nthe air between them okay good is the\nair cool or warm cool okay now I want\nyou to focus on the inner surfaces of\nyour palms and see if you can feel heat\nyeah I definitely do okay now start to\nincrease the gap between your hands\nspread them apart a little bit and just\nthat too much in a little bit good so a\nlittle bit more open good right there\nright there right there and now I want\nyou to continue to feel that warmth\nbetween your hands you may feel a slight\ntension to pull them together a little\nbit more just notice that tension and\nthen pull apart just a little bit more\nand I want you to kind of envision for\nlack of a better term a warm space\nalmost like a box between your hands\ndoes that make sense yeah yes [ __ ] is so\nweird so expand a little bit and keep\nslowly expanding until you lose the box\nit's almost like there's like a conduit\nof warmth between your hands this may be\nanother way to put it does that make\nsense\nyeah okay I'm not trying to be\nsuggestible I'm just trying to describe\nthe weird-ass sensations pull apart\nuntil I like I feel the air again like\nthis yeah okay so just focus on that a\nlittle bit and now what I want you to do\nis try to remember what it feels like to\nfeel this heat and now I want you to put\nyour hands like this\nopen your eyes so this is a mudra and\nplace this mudra in front of you so like\nright above your hips like crotch\nbasically so rest it\nrelax your shoulders close your eyes let\nthe tips of your thumbs touch and then\nfeel the heat emanating out of your\nhands can you feel that conduit kind of\ncoming out mm-hmm\nfocus on that sensation and try to sit\nas still as possible and just focus on\nthat energy practice for about 60\nseconds now with your eyes closed so I'm\ngoing to say some stuff that doesn't\nmake any sense okay so I want you to\njust focus on that sensation and then\nfeel your body feel the vibrance of it\nfeel the vitality and feel the strength\nand understand that there is a great\nchallenge that lies ahead of you that\nthese emotions will exist within this\nbody and they will influence your mind\nand they will try to get you to do\nthings the emotions aren't right they're\nnot wrong all you need to be able to do\nis hold all of it together\nand that recognize that in this moment\nthis vessel is capable of holding all of\nthat and whatever may come that if your\ndad drifts away this person can handle\nit\nthat if you need to be your mom your dad\nand an older brother for your brother\nyou were capable of that feel that heat\nin that energy in the perfection within\nyou the purity of your vessel and that\nno matter what life throws as long as\nyou can find this place you can hold you\ncan handle whatever they throw at you\nbecause you can and now put your palms\ntogether in front of you rub them\ntogether feel the heat the friction cut\nthem over your eyes take a deep breath\nin and exhale slowly open your eyes then\nrelax your hands how do you feel good\nfeel good nope\nconfident good that's what it's for man\ndoes that doesn't make any sense\nsometimes like I don't understand how to\nexplain what I feel like the sensations\nlike yeah yeah yeah that made sense like\ndid you understand like that make any\nsense about like how you you have a\nshitstorm ahead of you but that you're\ngonna be able to hit like that thing\nthat you were like this person can't\nhandle it person I'm talking to can but\nthat thing that you were that can handle\nit if you don't like I'm paranoid that\npeople are just nodding their heads like\ndoes that actually make sense cuz it\ndoesn't make any sense to me when I hear\nthe words it yes it makes sense okay\ngreat\nso this is the challenge challenging\nthing about experiences in meditation is\nlike they're not convey Abul with words\nlike if you're feeling it you get it and\nif you don't understand like if you\ndon't feel it you're like what the is\nthis guy talking about like what right\nanyway I'm glad so I think you should do\nthis practice every day you must\ncultivate strength my friend you are not\nbeen and then do you do yoga I do not\nwhere do you live I live in Iowa I live\nin a town about a thousand people okay\nso see if you can somehow learn yoga\nstart doing yoga if you probably my best\nthat day yeah yeah I do sometimes\nokay so exercise more you need you need\nstrength buddy like your your body needs\nto be pure because like the emotions\nthat you're dealing with they're just\nyou can't handle it unless your body's\ngonna be optimized it's not gonna grow\nfor you and if you could see a family\ntherapist I think this is prime for\nfamily therapy okay I'll bring up thanks\na lot man yeah any last questions or\nthoughts before we wrap up for the day\nnot that I can think of okay awesome\nthank you very much I really do\nappreciate it thank you chat okay how do\nwe show our love to Jake okay they're\nshowing love give me strength buffs\nmaybe some strength potions yeah man\nawesome thank you very much Jake good\nluck Joe yep thank you very much thank\nyou"
