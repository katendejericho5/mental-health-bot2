    "transcript": "listen what would it feel like so you're\nscared of hate but I'm gonna ask you\nanother question what would it feel like\nif if you didn't manipulate someone and\nthey chose to love you instead if they\nactually said you know what despite all\nof your BS and with you just being you\nand without manipulating me I love you\nhow would that make you feel there would\nbe a comma afterwards I say I love you\nnow we're late for Quidditch is what I\nwould hear that's how crazy again it is\nto me like that's what I would hear like\nOh even though you didn't you know make\nme feel a certain way about you I love\nyou let's go win for Gryffindor like\nthat is how\noh man I did not sleep at all good lord\nsorry to hear that man I know no no no\nit's totally fine it's not it wasn't a\nbad thing it was just okay I didn't\nsleep so have you been I'm still alive I\nthink that's pretty much a blessing at\nthis point um I know that's what I was\ngoing to tell you so do you remember\nwhen like last time you told me all I\nsaid I was going to clean my room\nokay like at the end of it all I said\nthat well you'll be happy to know that I\nkind of took that in a different\ndirection I clean my room but I also\nfound a new place to live that is not\nwith a bunch of people that don't pay\nrent good for you yeah that is huge but\nbut yes that's what I've been doing\nthat's so let's talk about that for a\nsecond okay because I think that's more\nsignificant I mean it's a it sounds very\nsignificant to me because not just from\na financial perspective but let's think\nabout why were you living with people\nwho didn't pay rent like what drove you\nto do that well I think um like I've\nalways worked a lot of jobs and I don't\nspend a lot of money I'm just myself so\nwhen my first video on YouTube blew up\nand I saw the money that I was making I\njust was like oh man I could just live\nwith my best friends forever this is my\npath to being Drake like I thought I was\ngonna go so far that money whatever like\nwe could just live together that didn't\nhappen but at the time I thought that\nwas gonna happen so when things started\nslowing down and getting bad after four\nyears of doing it I didn't really know\nhow to live alone or live with less\npeople so I kind of just\nkept it going and added more people and\nnow I'm in crippling debt and I'm alone\nokay sorry well so okay so how does how\ndoes that feel to be in crippling debt\nand alone ah the question I mean it\nfeels honestly the debt feels right it\nfeels like an ample punishment because I\nalso think that like by paying for\neverything for everybody I I also\nbelieve I kind of ruined their lives a\nbit like I spoiled them and I didn't do\nanything with it I would tell people\nlike during my depression oh yeah we're\ngonna like videos are coming back we're\ngonna work like you know we got this\njust a we got this we got this and then\nI never worked and that was like an\nongoing cycle for the next three years\nso it's like I feel like with debt and\nguilt it's pretty good pretty good\npunishment it's pretty terrible okay so\nso our and how does it feel to be alone\nI think I will be okay is like I think\nthat I just need space to be like just\nme and so I'm looking forward to that\nlike it feels good because I'm moving\nlike I'm moving a lot of my stuff like\ntoday tomorrow the next day and it feels\ngood that I actually was brave enough to\njust end the cycle so it's been so hard\nso like I don't know how it's gonna be\nbut right now I'm very confident that if\nI'm only financially taking care of\nmyself and I'm only doing things that\nare like important for me instead of\nputting everyone else first I'm hoping\nthat that will that'll be the catalyst\nthat starts change to make me come back\nto yeah I was doing before\nso Skyy I think it's great because I\nthink there was something within you\nthat felt like like you know a sense of\nyour identity was in\nporting other people oh yeah and and so\nyou sort of let that part of you which i\nthink is is basically you know a part of\nyour ego and so like in order to be a\ngood person you had to like help other\npeople and pay their rent and like\nManono doubt that there was genuine\ncaring involved in terms of like you\nknow wanting your your friends and you\nknow to have an easy time and that your\nsuccess should you wanted to share your\nsuccess and all this other kind of good\nstuff but i think it's actually a huge\nstep forward if you've let those voices\nstop running the show and drive you into\ncrippling debt because that's what those\nvoices do yes a hundred iliyan present i\nwill say this though it kind of sucks\nbecause along the way like i had made\nfriends that didn't need money like i\nhad made friends like when i would like\nwhen i was be at home versus like going\nout to conventions like packs and and\nand whatnot like i would have friends\nthat are just there to chill i didn't\nhave to pay for anything i could just\nrelax and it sucks because like i just i\ndon't know i this this lifestyle kind of\nruined a lot of those relationships\nbecause i wasn't even sure how to be a\ngood friend like i I treated them like\nabsolute garbage because I thought that\nyou know I could just solve any problem\nlike paying them but then if I couldn't\nit's like Omar okay I don't have any\nproblem solving skills now yeah this is\n[ __ ]\nso what let's think about that for a\nsecond why do you think that you treated\nyour friends that didn't need your help\nlike garbage\nlike that's strange right one would\nexpect turns out to not be very strange\nbut one would expect that the you know\nthat those would be the relationships\nthat would have been the healthiest and\nthat you have cultivated the most but it\nseems like the opposite actually\nhappened I guess like I guess because my\nactions that I would normally do towards\npeople that lived with me I did them on\nothers that didn't live with me and and\nreally stuck their neck out for me which\nis like\nyou know one of them let me borrow like\nwhat like without any hesitation at all\ndropped\n$8,100 literally like the next day when\nI needed it right and two years down the\nroad\nI didn't even begin to talk about paying\nthem back I probably could have if I\nbudgeted correctly and there's a lot of\npeople out there that I owe money to a\nlot a lot like whatever you think is a\nlot triple it and that's half like so I\nwith this particular case though she\nended up she was so hurt that I didn't\nlike talk to her about it because in my\nworld I'm thinking oh if I suspect if\nsomeone gives me money after all these\nyears like people that live with me\nI pretty much deserve it at that point\nlike after I had given the hundreds of\nthousands of dollars for rent food all\nthe [ __ ] that we did it's like I don't\nI'm family not gonna pay you back but\nwith the people outside of the home I\ncouldn't I didn't have the null the\nbasic human decency to just like honor\nand agreement you know what I mean like\nI didn't even think about it and it\n[ __ ] me up really bad I mean it darned\nme up it darn do you oh yeah oh yeah\nthanks thanks for being sense on but\nyour language I appreciate that I'm\ngonna pause for a second because\nsomebody just gifted a bunch of subs so\nthanks nerd great luck to you I don't\nknow that is but thank you very much\nguys we appreciate it but kind of coming\nback to Skye subscribe what what do you\nwant to talk it up about today how can I\nhelp you I mean we could dig into that\nif you want to in your relationships and\nwhy you perceive your relationships like\nthat but hey you know is there something\nin do you feel like because last time\nyou you know you sent me that voicemail\nwhich was really fantastic actually wait\nwhich was you sent me like a voicemail\nthat that you recorded like you sent me\nlike this tech like this voice message\nthat was like you were in bed and trying\nto fall asleep and you had some thoughts\nand you said\nyeah so we can together you were talking\nabout like when you should start making\nchanges oh yeah\nso love our what do you want to talk\nabout you tell me like what would be\nhelpful okay um I think we already\ndiscussed like the feeling of it being\ntoo late to do things I got this because\nIII put notes I even yeah that's right I\nhad notes I'm so dumb I when I when I\nhad reached oh do you want me to just I\ndon't think there's I know yeah like if\nI start right this second will it prove\nthat like you know I won't procrastinate\nor is it better to start later after\nI've had preparation like it's jumping\ninto something cold turkey the way to go\nor is waiting and being prepared better\nor are they both rationalizations that's\nwhat I was confused about yeah so you\ntell me why don't we talk is there\nsomething particular on your mind do you\nwant to dig into that do you want to\ntalk about friendships tell me what do\nyou think would be pretty bad so I want\nto know can I read people can I play the\nvoicemail for people did yeah I think I\nstill have it a lot oh it's it's not I\ndon't think it's it's not like no I know\nI know oh you do if you look in our\ngroup shot oh it's in the group Cheyenne\nyeah you just scroll up there's a big\nblack okay\nsquare yeah here we go y'all ready chat\nwe're gonna it's like super\nunprofessional I'm sorry for doing it\nthis way but I'm about to sleep my voice\nis dead and then add this thought and\nI'm totally down don't like talk about\nthis another community he'll have me but\nI wanted to ask when it comes to life\nchanges like things that we talked about\nis that something that I should just do\n[ __ ] side\nokay this is like to like talk about\nthis another community will have me but\nI wanted to ask when it comes to life\nchanges like things that we talked about\nis that something that I should just do\nimmediately right now or is there merit\nof like setting a date to start like why\ndo you think like setting a date is\nrationalizing yeah like what would be\nthe wisest way to affect change in a\nhealthy manner it's like kind of my\nquestion again so sorry this is like\nsuper alright do you guys got that so\nlet's go back to this okay so what do\nyou think um I I can't tell when I'm\nmanipulating myself or people I don't\nknow how to tell and it's getting bad\nbecause even if I was like now when I\ntalk I could be telling the truth but\neveryone will think I'm manipulating but\nthen am I like that's like I don't even\nknow like that that's why I sent that\nbecause I was thinking about everything\nyou said about or that really helpful\nsession about you know going on Sage\ngiving it your all but then being\ncontent because that was the best you\ncould have done and I was like that is\ngenius but I don't know when to start\nand I can't tell what my brain if I\nbrain is tricking me or not so that's\nyeah so I think a great it's so first of\nall you've taken the first important\nstep which is realizing that your brain\nloves to trick you right is that normal\nit's completely normal\nit's very normal so so that that and\neven then you're kind of saying you were\nsaying that oh like sometimes like I'm\ntelling the truth and people think I'm\nbeing manipulative I think some of the\ntimes when you're the most manipulative\nsky is when you tell the truth and\nright no I mean the damn so just because\nyou're telling the truth doesn't mean it\nisn't manipulative I cannot understand\nthat you can honor like you don't I\ndon't get I don't how are you like like\nmanipulating the truth or no so so I\nthink I think manipulation so let's\ndefine manipulation right so what is\nmanipulation\nI guess changing or maybe not reforming\nwhat's the word I'm looking for it like\nbothering an object or an idea I'm so\nI'm trying to find the right it's it's\nit's a hard question harder than it\nseems uh I'm gonna say changing changing\nsomething by way of not something with\nmalicious intent okay I don't know yeah\nyeah yeah yeah changing something with\nmalicious intent it's great it's great\nright so so I I think it's sort of like\ncontrolling someone's behavior usually\nlike altering something for the purpose\nof controlling someone else's behavior\nand like with some degree of like\nmalicious intent or you're kind of\ntaking advantage of them you know it's\nlike a little bit immoral there's\nsomething in there I don't know that\nit's necessarily malicious attack but I\nbasically think about manipulating\nsomeone is sort of altering information\nor tailoring information to control\nsomeone else's behavior like that's what\nmanipulation is manipulation is about\ncontrolling other human beings right\nyeah and sometimes one of the best ways\nyou can control other human beings is by\ntelling the truth\nOh My Jesus Christ okay right so I I\nthink that you do some manipulative\nstuff you're kind of an open book but I\nthink you understand how being an open\nbook can be advantageous to you and I\nthink you calculate something about that\nhmmm I think I think that you're right\nfor the most part but I'm not lying when\nI say that I just don't know when the\nmanipulation switch is on I completely\nagree with you I do not blame you for\nmanipulating okay to be clear so I think\nmanipulation happens a lot of times when\nwe don't even want it to but it happens\nalmost so like why do you want to\ncontrol another person's behavior like\nwhat's like when you think about when\nyou manipulate when one human being\nmanipulates another human being what is\nthe main thing that drives them what\ndrives the manipulation to to make sure\nthat they don't do anything bad that has\nanything to do with you maybe yes so if\nyou have to say if you had to attach an\nemotion to that what is the emotion that\none feels when I don't want you to do\nsomething bad to me what is the emotion\nI'm feeling I don't want you to do\nsomething fear absolutely I think it's\nit's it's weird right so like I know\nthat this stuff seems really simple in\nin in a sense it is but we don't ever\nstop and like think about what actually\ndrives us and you can get to the answer\nit's just like let's just that's you're\ndoing great sky so the first thing\nyou're when you manipulate people out of\nfear like if you think about it like if\nI you know let's say I'm married and and\nyou know let's use a real example so you\nknow my wife doesn't want me to play as\nmany video games as I play and so then\nshe's like oh like how late like I have\ntrouble waking up on the weekends and\nthen she's like okay like how late were\nyou up and then then I like I want to\nmanipulate the information a little bit\nright I'm like oh I I did a little bit\nof work and I played some donut I sort\nof say like both of those things even\nthough the little bit of work may have\nbeen 60 seconds and then the donut may\nhave been two hours but like I sort of\npresent it like I did both of those\nthings like that's manipulation right\nit's manipulation yes so in that moment\nlike why am i manipulating like what is\nthe drive behind me manipulating can you\nguess I mean I would say in that case\nit's like\nthink it sounds like you kind of know\nyour body and I guess what's best for\nyou so maybe you did that because you\ndidn't want to elicit a reaction that\nwould be disastrous so you wanted to\nsave that exactly so I'm trying to\ncontrol another person's behavior right\nI didn't want to elicit a reaction that\nis not gonna like affect me well because\nyou think like listen me then like you\nknow right that causes marital problems\nfine\nso would you you were you conscious like\nin that example like are you saying that\nknowing fully well what you're doing a\nhundred percent me at this point usually\nbut that takes practice right so it\ntakes practice so the first thing so\nthen like a if the goal of manipulation\nis to control someone's behavior and\nthen if the reason you want to control\ntheir behaviors to prevent a particular\noutcome where's the root of the desire\nto manipulate coming from so that\nquestion may be a little bit yeah I have\nno clue so like what is the thing that's\ndriving the manipulation let me ask let\nme ask it that way we were kind of\ntalking about emotions earlier um like\nfor me I guess like I oh well actually\nGod I know I know so just like how you\nsaid right that 30 seconds or a minute\nof work in two hours of dota I did the\nsame thing for about five years when it\ncame to people I was living with like\nhow much money was actually needed to\nlike maintain this lifestyle and then\nlike I know that I would definitely like\nnot be honest about how much I was\npaying for rent or who was paying rent\nor how many people you know was I doing\nthis for but I would be telling the\ntruth in explaining that yes there are\npeople that don't pay things\nyes rent is high yes I pay everything\nbut I was never I was never like\nforthcoming with the information I was\nreally afraid to like\nI was really afraid that anyone would\njust call me an idiot because I was\nbeing one like so because it was so like\nyeah so good so what's the driving force\nthere you often you said it you said it\nbut yes I'm gonna suggest just to not\nhave someone think that I'm a complete\nidiot yeah so so in that - you said you\nwere afraid that someone was gonna call\nyou an idiot right and also everyone\nlike it's so obvious to everyone else\nlike and it's so stupid that I'm sitting\nhere and I'm like literally giving\nputting myself in a lifetime out of debt\nbut yet when I lament like when I tell\nmy problems to literally anyone even at\nthe peak of their honesty like everyone\nit was all the same like dude you gotta\nleave you gotta live by yourself like\nyeah you should do this man that's so\ndumb and it's hard because it's like I\ncan't do that like I don't know I don't\nknow why I couldn't do that and for\neveryone else it's like they they're all\ngods that they all could do it if they\nwere me they'd be doing it right now and\nit's like I couldn't do it I can't bring\nmyself to do okay so they're two layers\nof this sky I'm gonna try to keep track\nof both of them I'm gonna stick always\nstart with manipulation because this is\nvery important I think this could help a\nlot of people so fear is what drives\nyour manipulative tendencies right so\nfor you if you're saying I don't know\nwhen I'm manipulating and when I'm not\nmanipulating what can you look at within\nyourself to give you a clue whether\nthere's manipulation or there's not\nmanipulation what I'm scared of\nabsolutely right\nso you look hard here right you look for\nfear because you have learned like so\nremember manipulation is not it's not\nabout evil that's why I don't like the\nword malicious manipulation in your case\nI think is predominantly about\nprotection it's your mind trying to\nprotect you from everyone calling you an\nidiot because you have the curse of\nbeing smart and you know that what\nyou're doing is stupid and you know that\nif other people know what you're doing\nthey're gonna tell you things\nthat they're gonna say it's stupid\nthey're gonna think you're stupid and\nthey're gonna give you solutions that\nany idiot could do but you're not gonna\nbe able to do them and you know that\nbecause what keeps those people in your\nhouse is not IQ its feelings and like\nfeelings could give they don't care\nabout what the rationale is like the\nreason that you've been like keeping\npeople in your house and I don't know\nwhere this goes but we can explore it\nbut like you know somewhere along the\nway I mean we've talked some about your\npast is like you you want to support\npeople you want to help people like you\ndon't want to abandon them because\nyou've been [ __ ] abandoned and you\ndon't want you know you want people to\nbe like safe and comfortable and like\nthat didn't happen for you so I think\nthere's something there we can go there\nif you want to but let's table that for\na second if you're okay with it I'm just\nhighlighting a little bit because I\ndon't think it's idiocy that keeps these\npeople in your house right there's that\nis actually coming from some kind of\npositive emotion within you because if\nyou think about the stupider and action\nis the more powerful the thing has to be\nwithin you that gets it done so this is\nanother thing that I see a lot is people\njudge themselves for doing like\nastronomically idiotic stip and what I\nwant all of you guys to understand is\nthat if you're doing something that\neveryone else is causing Stute calling\nstupid\nthat just makes you feel more and more\nincompetent but that's incomplete that's\nnot right it's not that you're stupid\nit's that there is something within you\nthat is driving you so hard that it\novercomes how glaringly idiotic at us\ndoes that make sense\nyeah so we'll get to\nlet's go back to fear and manipulation\nbut I think you know when you say like\noh it's like all these people would call\nme stupid like you don't want them to\nthink that about you but what what's\nreally going on is like I don't think\nthey understand right like sky they\ndon't get it they don't understand why\nyou do what you do you may not even get\nit you may not understand why you do\nwhat you do all you know is that what\nthey think is simple you just you're not\ngoing to be able to do that you just\ncan't kick everyone out of your house\nand [ __ ] this I mean darn this okay this\nis a bombshell I think I don't know I\nwas like the whole time you were talking\nI was struggling to see if I should say\nthis but I will I mean in in in a good\namount of those cases if yeah they would\ncall me an idiot but I believe that they\nalso wouldn't give me money they\nwouldn't let me borrow anything if they\nknew that it was going to all these\npeople that are just pretty much free\nliving mm-hmm so it's easier to just say\nthat I'm the target and not let anyone\nknow that they're not doing what they\nneed to do because I don't want them to\nbe scrutinized but I certainly don't\nwant to be scrutinized it's like I\nwanted to I wanted to say that the\nlifestyle worked for me and I did\ngenuinely believe that while I was\ndepressed if I just kept this lifestyle\ngoing like my friends would eventually\nuplift me and I would be back on my feet\nin no time so whatever money I borrowed\nfrom someone it was always like oh man\nthat's a lot but I I can do it now like\nyou know I'm feeling better and then it\nnever got better and then having a bunch\nof people here then turned into the\nworst decision I've ever made\nlike that's that's my thing is that I\nthrew it all I've turned it all of my\nsocial relationships to maintain this\nlifestyle and now it's like even the\npeople living here I've never been this\nalone in my life easy like so alone like\nit's nuts\nI'm just annoying to everybody now I'm\non the internet and that just that's\nlike\nthat's all and it's quite a bit what are\nyou feeling right now\nterrible yeah that I can counter yeah\nyou know what yeah yeah I mean this is\nall like retribution though right like\neveryone that's been cancelled online as\nlike they're typically trying to do\nsomething and forget the past well then\nthey get canceled for something that was\nbrought up and I've always thought like\nI have a lot of actions that I've done\nin my home that definitely could raise a\ncancel like for sure but to me my\npunishment is again debt until I'm dead\nand being alone like I I feel like even\nI I feel like I'm I did all of this\ndamage to myself almost entirely no one\nelse's to blame and that's really hard\nfor me to live with like really really\nhard I can't do it sometimes did you how\nlong have you been living with that Oh\nlike ever since 2015\nlike I oh yeah a hundred percent around\nthen what my channel started going down\nwhen I was depressed I just felt like\ndamn\neven though depression you think\neverything that happens to you is your\nfault yes a hundred percent times ten\nthat happens to me good or bad is a\ndirect action of me 100%\nhow long have you paddles if I could be\nany other way\nwhat how long have you believed that my\nwhole life okay what does it mean if it\nif that isn't true to me that's like\nlike if that's not true then also in\nthat world where it's not true humans\ncan also fly like they could just soar\ninto the air because to me I think that\nwhatever action you took I just always\nthought well I did this action or like I\nwas a catalyst in this way so I\nshouldn't have done that kind of asked\nfor it stuff like that yeah so I'm gonna\nsay something to you okay so like\nsometimes when I work with people they\nsay things like oh yeah the fact that it\nwas my fault that he hit me because I\nshould have done a better job at like\ncleaning up it wasn't his fault it was\nmy fault what do you think about that\nfor that person maybe\noh man\nbe honest guy I don't think it's the\nperson the person that got hit on done\nit's not there\noh my brain is short-circuiting I know\nokay good sure that's what we're here\nfor\nyeah let's understand let's understand\nwhat's the short what's the short\ncircuit because it's pain because it's\nnot\noh [ __ ] okay it this is the hardest\nthing okay it's not the person that got\nhit it's not their fault but they were a\npart of the act no that's stupid\nit doesn't matter if they were part of\nit they got hit by a monster but they're\nthere they're in it I guess they're\ndoing so tell me what you're feeling\noh just ah that's that that sound is how\nI'm feeling\noh yeah so let me try to put words to\nthat sound okay yes thank you so first\nof all I think you're doing great sky\nsorry for bodying that's so hard like\nyeah I know I'm but do you want to do\nyou want to take a break\nearth no no no no no no no we should\ndive right in I'm good I'm just like\nyeah I'm good I'm ready okay so I think\nhere's what's going on with anything so\nyou know that that's not that person's\nfault right like when they get hit and\nthey say oh it's because I didn't do XYZ\nlike I should have been better you\nthere's a part of you that knows that\nit's it's ridiculous that we call that\nthe person who got hit is not the\nperpetrator they're the victim the\nproblem is like if I say if I make you\nsay that\nyou say like that's true for them but\nit's not true for me but like yeah how\ncan I say that it's not true for me\nbecause that's just [ __ ] - what it\nisn't\nOh God it does exactly oh yes if I have\nif I was left alone with that and that\nwouldn't end this guy okay right so so\nso that that can be so good good job\nright and the feeling is good I think\nyou actually did a very good job of\ndescribing how you felt right which is\nlike that it's like an existential grunt\nit's like just like a torturous like you\ncan't because it doesn't compute like\nyou know that you shouldn't feel this\nway about yourself but you do\nand it doesn't matter how true that\nscenario is for this fictional person it\ndoes not apply to you you are different\nand you have trouble computing that\ntogether and your thing is blurry by the\nway your mic there we go yeah okay yeah\num I was gonna say that first of all\nyou're great and second of all the\nreason why I would think that I'm\ndifferent is because I think that I was\nborn with a lot of advantages that makes\nit so those kinds of situations I\nbelieve they're very it's very hard for\nthat to happen to me like for example\nlike okay I'm like six five if I don't\nhunch my back so it's like I don't\nreally have to worry about walking into\nmy car\nI'm huge no one's gonna attack me and\nthey think that I'm gonna fight them I'm\na [ __ ] I will run but they don't think\nthat so like in that scenario if someone\nwere to jump me right sure that's not my\nfault but in my mind it's like that is\nprobably not going to happen because I\nhave a I have a set of skills and\nphysical attributes that make it\ndifficult for those things that happen\nto me yeah but I mean pardon me for\nbeing insensitive but no please you know\nso there so first of all this this is a\nbelief that is not doesn't it wasn't\nborn today right the belief that you are\neverything that happens to you is your\nfault\nwas not born today you felt this way\nas you say your whole life off ever\nsince that ever since the rape I felt\nthat light times 10 ya think\nright yeah so like this is if I wasn't\non AOL and and and so this is the thing\nback then you weren't six five right and\nyou weren't an adult you were a kid and\nyou\nand and this is unfortunately what\nhappens to people who have been abused\nis they think that it's their small a\nfault especially when they're kids\nand it's funny I just talked about this\nbut what are you feeling I mean I I I\nthink it was my fault hundred percent\nyeah hundred percent and then when I\nlook at even things that I do now my\nchannel my twitch my friendships my debt\nall of that all of it my fault entirely\na hundred percent the sky what is it\nbeautiful isn't your fault what does the\nworld look like it like I said people\nopened the window right now Harry Potter\nis about the draft me for Quidditch like\nthat's the same world so so yeah so\nlet's let's take into that because I\nthink this has to be this has to be\napproached okay so I think right now so\nlet's think about let's remember that\nour mind does things for a reason okay\nand our mind is really trying to help us\nout a lot of times it doesn't do as good\nof a job as we want it to but that's\njust because it doesn't know how to do\nany better so let's think about why your\nworldview is so difficult to abandon so\nright now the good thing about your\nworldview is that it makes sense right\nlike it makes sense that you live in a\nworld where you were an actor or like\nisn't you could take action not like\nyour fake but that you are like an actor\nin the world and you exert agency in the\nworld and the world responds to you so\nthe world makes sense because like you\nknow you're you're playing a video game\nand you control the character and if you\nhit the spacebar the character jumps and\nthat's just it makes sense every time\nyou get the space part of the character\njumps so this is a world that makes\nsense\nyou also have control over this world if\nyou are responsible for everything that\nhappens to you that also means you have\na hope right if you can learn how to be\na better person then you can create the\nlife that you want you can create a life\nwhere you're safe you can create a life\nwhere you're loved you can create a life\nwhere you're wealthy you can create a\nlife where you're comfortable all of\nthese things are within your power if\nonly you figure out how right oh I mean\nyeah yeah that sounded great I was I was\nlost\nlike damn sign me up for that yeah so\nthat's that's the the beautiful thing\nabout the world that you've constructed\nbecause you at the end of the day like\nall of these things are possible for you\nbut it's kind of you feeling something\nyeah I'm feeling just getting drink\nwater continue you're good\nI'm curious what you're feeling I'm just\nwaiting for Harry Potter behind them in\nhis world that Cummins drive neo but I\njust I want to hear more as though I\ndon't think Harry Potter's out there ok\nso so I think the challenge here though\nis that like that's not actually the way\nthe world works right because like the\nthe the hard thing about giving up your\nworldview is you give up control for\nyour future if other people are involved\nlike let's say there's two kinds of\nworld like there's like there's a\nsingle-player game and there's a\nmultiplayer game and if you're playing a\nsingle-player game then you can control\neverything in the game but if you're\nplaying multiplayer and I'm like I'm\nrunning around and like I get like PvP\nand ganked yes then like I don't want to\nlive in the multiplayer world because\nlike other people can interfere with me\nand so I defeat huh sorry the days out\nand I'm saying they feed like if I play\nwith someone yeah they're gonna be like\nnoobs yeah thank you yes and and so it\ncan actually be like a little bit\ndangerous to think about living in a\nmultiplayer world because like you're\nactually not in control and that thought\nis terrifying like yeah you yeah I don't\nlike that and an especially especially\nwhen we when we look at you know for\nexample victims of traumatic experiences\nso this is gonna be kind of a random\nthing but often times people or who are\npeople who are anorexic or have eating\ndisorders that's oftentimes linked to an\nabusive relationship in their early\nyears so they have especially like a\nparent or something who is like really\nmean to them or something\nor have a conditional affection or\nthings like that and if you talk to\nthese people like so eating disorders\nthe root issue if you talk to people is\nit's about control so someone like a 15\nyear old girl with\nanorexia like all of the ones that I've\nworked with when I talked to them it's\nall about control they can't control\ntheir parents they can't control their\ngrades but they can control what they\nput in their body and it's this really\nbizarre sense of control and the more\nyou try to control what they eat the\nmore they fight and the more they rebel\nthey just want to be able to commits all\nabout control control control it's not\nabout intelligence you could show them\nas much information that you want to\nabout them becoming getting osteoporosis\nat a young age or electrolyte balances\nor things like that oftentimes these\npeople when they're very severe they get\nhospitalized against their will because\nthey're not eating in their bodies like\nliterally dying in their heart is\ngetting arrhythmias at the age of 15\nwhich they should not have and they they\njust you cannot communicate with them on\nany kind of rational level because for\nthem it's all about control they cannot\nsurrender control because early on in\ntheir life they did not have it and the\nthought of not having again is\nabsolutely terrifying because you will\ntell yourself whatever you can to not be\n12 years old and on AOL again because in\nthat moment in your life you didn't have\ncontrol and and there's no [ __ ] way\nyou're willing to go back to that state\nand you're 65 when you stand up straight\nand you were in control and the world is\ngonna give you what you deserve and you\nwere gonna create what the world gives\nyou I was but like I it wasn't like it\nwasn't like I just like logged onto AOL\nand then a dude came to rape me like it\nwas way way more than that like I was\nliterally like in a gay chat room trying\nto get information about you know being\na semen demon and an app and a guy DM me\nand lied to me about who he was we\ntalked for a bit I think he darks the\nhell out of me\nwhich is why he when he asked I'm so mad\nwhen he asked if I lived out sterile I\ndid not even think why anybody would ask\nme that we're to this day I like if I\ncould just go back it's like I just feel\nlike you shouldn't have done that like\neverything else is fine tell him you\nlive upstairs in your parents room he'll\nbreak in and die but\nno I had to answer that yeah so why are\nyou telling me that what are you doing\nwhat are you using those statements for\nwhat's the function of your words in\nthis conversation because that action is\nnot just a one-way thing like there are\nthings that I could have done to prevent\nit and I just feel like it didn't I\ndidn't feel like I didn't have control\nof the situation and all really I felt\nthat oh [ __ ] oh my god no I sound like\nlaw and order I'd literally was about to\nsay it felt like I wanted it to happen\nand I don't know if that's true I know\nit wasn't I know that it definitely\nwasn't true when the cops came here but\nit's like like in the middle of it in\nthe middle of it of the rape the only\nthing I remember vividly is that my body\ntried to like convince my mind that this\nfelt good and it was okay because you're\ngay so it's like well you're gay so this\nis what's gonna happen anyway so like I\nI don't I guess I just tricked myself\nand I've always felt really guilty\nbecause like I tell people that you know\nI think the worst part about being raped\na conversation that I think should be\nopened a lot more is that because your\nbody is really good at protecting itself\nthere was about two seconds where it was\nenjoyable it felt good and a day and\nthen I have to live with that that it\nwas the most painful thing that happened\nto me but my body tried to convince\nmyself that it was fine for two seconds\nI think that's the whose fault was it\nmine I mean I died\nI I felt if my mind convinced me of that\nI I don't know if anybody else would\nthink that but think what\nlike my mind didn't my mind tried to\nmake it okay I guess so I gotta feel\nlike if my mind made it okay oh [ __ ]\nthis is hard ooh I kind of felt like if\nmy mind made this okay then somewhere\ndeep in the recesses of my psyche is\nguilt like maybe I did something to\nprovoke it or something and and my mind\nwas just following up it's like oh well\nI think this is kind of what you wanted\nmaybe not as violent but I've never been\nable to explain why I felt that way but\nI just have to live with that so after\nthat if I can make my brain feel like\nthat then I figured okay it doesn't get\nmuch worse than that like you can you\ncan you sky I can tell that you're\nworking through a lot of stuff I'm not\nable to quite keep up so can you help me\nunderstand what you mean by guilt so\nit's clear to me that you sort of\nfigured something out I'm just not able\nto follow you quite as quickly so what\ndo you feel guilty for\nin a gay chat room and like specifically\nnot really talking I didn't have anyone\nto talk to about being gay my house so\nit's like I feel guilty for taking that\nmethod when maybe it would have been\nbetter to do to me more healthy like\nreach out to someone that's not in my\nfamily or I don't know something like\nthat like that might at the action that\nI took was like why would I do that like\nit didn't it just doesn't make sense\nthis guy do you deserve forgiveness\nabsolutely not 0% no way cuz I mean I\ndid a lot I did too much damage to\npeople even now like like a lay in the\nwake of bring out your dead like there\nare so many lives that I've ruined and\nthen obviously like I mean I eat it\ndoesn't get any worse than lying to your\nfans like six times and going through\nthe exact same cycle to the point where\neven your most loyal banja like I we're\ndone and then I want I wanted\nforgiveness but I would always like mess\nit up so so at this point I deserve it\nyeah no I don't think so how would you\nfeel if people did forgive you well I\nwouldn't\nI'd have to get my Nimbus 2000 and hop\nright on that [ __ ] Quidditch team\nthat's the first thing that I would I\nwould if people forgave me I'm out there\nright now getting the seeker like for\nHogwarts for Gryffindor no I'm a\nHufflepuff but you know that's how I\nfeel okay getting that Nimbus can I just\nthink for a second sky absolutely I'm\ngonna just sit and look at my phone sky\ndo you are you a good person yeah no no\nokay\ndo you are you loved\nI don't know have you been loved before\nI don't know I can't tell cuz that's\nwhat I struggled with with my mom\nforever is after the rape my brother\ntold everyone and bullied me about it\nlike no one in the family seemed to\nthink that was heinous or terrible and\nis like oh alright you go to NICs baby\nshower he just put in 2000 and what 17\n18 just put all my angry texts out there\nand Facebook and my reddit and all my\nrape business out and ridiculed it again\nbut but yeah let's go to NICs baby\nshower like trash\nso if that's happening how could you\nlook how could you love someone and take\nthat action it makes no sense yeah\ntherefore I'm gonna just think for\nanother minute okay thank you for\nanswered your questions Yoko\nso sky um first of all do you have any\nquestions for me cuz I think I think we\nmay be coming to maybe a closing point\nsoon just I want to just see if there's\nanything I mean this this is this part\nof me is very dark and remember in the\nbeginning I said like I feel like I have\nunfixable problems uh-huh I think that\nwhat we're diving into now is like the\nfinal lock and key I agree it's a nice\nno question yeah basically so I don't\nmind I don't mind that being a stopping\npoint at all yeah so so I don't I don't\nthink we're done but I I just think that\nthere's something I need to spend some\ntime thinking about and there's some\nthoughts that I want to share with you\nand I'd love to get your your reaction\nto what I want to share with you but\nsomething tells me that your immediate\nreaction is not going to be as important\nis you thinking about this over the next\nfew days yeah and and I'm happy to do\nanother show whenever okay so Skye the\nfirst thing is that what I'm going to\ntell you I think is going to require\nimmense immense courage and also I don't\nblame you if you decide not to go down\nthis road but essentially your entire\nlife is built upon this very very simple\npremise that needs to be like that needs\nto be yanked out from under you and if\nit can be then I think you can be fixed\nbut in order for this premise to be\nyanked out you have to be willing to\nyank it out and I think it's going to be\nabsolutely terrifying because it's going\nto change the way that you see the world\nbut in order to do the things that I\nthink you need to do to live a happy\nlife you have to change your worldview\nso let me explain what I mean you live a\nlife where everything has comes down to\nyou everything is your under your\ncontrol everything is kind of your fault\nboth the good and the bad that other\npeople don't essentially have agency in\nthe world that other people acting or\njust based upon whether you can\nmanipulate them enough to do the things\nthat you want right like either you're\ngonna manipulate them and then they'll\ndo the right thing in which case you're\nresponsible or you're insufficient in\nterms of manipulating them which is like\nyour fault once again because you didn't\nlike handle the relationship the right\nway right it doesn't it doesn't presume\nthat there's any kind of agency or\ncontrol outside of you does that make\nsense also like I think somewhere along\nthe way you stopped you closed the doors\nto you being capable of being loved and\nI didn't ask you if you're able to love\nI think you are I think what what's\nchallenging here is that I don't know if\nyou're willing to take the risk to be\nloved again because I think that like\nthat huh what was that the the yank the\nblanket the part of it buddy that's part\nof it I think you have to risk a lot of\nthings one is the possibility of\nunderstanding that other human beings\nactually have agency and control in this\nworld which is a terrifying thought\nright oh yeah it's what it's like taking\ntaking a single player person and\nsticking them into a multiplayer game\nthey're like this is not what I signed\nup for\noh you learn how to clap back yeah so\nthat's exactly and and so you have but\nlike and I think that there's a part of\nyou so now I want you to look within\nyourself there's a part of you that\nrecognizes that like when some people\nare the vic-20 have a 12 year old that\ngets raped by an adult man who found\nwhere the kid lived\nyou know that that is not the 12 year\nolds fault like you know that but it\nfeels like it was your fault and this is\nwhat happens to people who were abused\nso people who are abused start to it's\nit's almost it's not like it's not\nyou're stupid in fact it's the opposite\nso in a very simple level it comes down\nto theory of mind and now I'm gonna get\na little bit academic so when you have a\nchild there understand huh well yeah\njust really quick I was I just turned 15\nat the time I don't know oh right yeah\nbut go on you're good so I think when\nyou know when kids are young less less\nso when they're 15 but when kids are\nyoung they don't understand that other\nhuman beings have thoughts and feelings\nand action like have behaviors like they\njust don't understand they don't have\nlike theory of mind so they don't have\nthe capacity to understand that like it\nlike you know I have a two-year-old and\nmy two-year-old doesn't understand that\nlike I have thoughts and feelings of my\nown they're just if they want daddy\ndon't like tell them the story at 3:00\nin the morning when they've woken up\nlike they don't understand that I'm\ntired like that doesn't compute the\nbrain has not developed the capacity to\nunderstand that other human beings like\nthink and act in a particular way and\nthat they have their own reasons for\ndoing things which is why abusing a\nchild is so devastating because if\nnothing else exists in the world so let\nme put it this way it's like a\nfive-year-old is basically playing a\nsingle-player game because their brain\ndoes not have the capacity to recognize\nthat other people are actually they\nthink everyone is an NPC when it's\nactually like another like it's like\nanother player that's zoned into your\nserver but they think everything is NPCs\nthat make sense and if something bad\nhappens to a five-year-old and you're in\na world full of NPCs whose fault is it\nyour fault absolutely right because\neveryone else is an NPC and it's a is\nyeah wow I never I I never actually it\nthat my do you think that's linked so I\nlike babies don't really have object\npermanence and then like when you just\nmake something disappear they think it's\ngone forever yes as they can't okay sort\nof so object permanence is a slightly\ndifferent thing why but they yeah it is\nlinked in the sense that that's one\nexample of\nfundamental capacity that a baby does\nnot have that adults do have and another\ncapacities is called theory of mind\nwhich is separate from object permanence\nbut which is your ability to like\nrecognize that other people have\npersistent thoughts and feelings and\nthere are their own agents so when it\ngod oh yeah I mean that what you just\nsaid like everyone have their own\nthoughts and feelings and agency I just\nto me I can't even imagine that being\ntrue\nyeah I know that sounds terrible though\nright wait so so so now we understand\nactually like the the the depth of or\nsort of the how can I say this how\ndeeply rooted this belief isn't in you\nand the first question is like whether\nyou're willing to try to live a life\nwhere you're not in control\nwhether you're try whether you're\nwilling to try to live a life where you\ncould let other people love you and like\nit doesn't it doesn't surprise me that\nyou don't feel loved because you know\nlike love genuinely comes from another\nperson it's not something that you can\ncontrol you can't manipulate someone to\nlove you like true authentic love I\ndon't think you can really manipulate\nout of someone and and so if you're the\nonly agent it doesn't surprise me that\nyou're not able to kind of feel love\nbecause it's like you don't really know\nwhat that is like are you just\nmanipulating them is that the way\nthey're treating you that way like and\nyou also have this sort of oh my god yes\nyeah but yes so in order for you to feel\nloved you have to give people the\nopportunity to like have control over\nthe way that they treat you so you're\nbigoted yeah huh and now I'm uh oh you\nsaid it so perfectly\ngoddamnit when you just said like you\nknow you if someone feels a certain way\nabout you\ndo they feel that way because you went\nthrough leaps and bounds to kind of\nmanipulate your image how are you like\nit's almost like you're almost like I'm\ntaking everyone in the world and then\nsaying you don't have to have a first\nimpression of me let me just go ahead\nand coat in what I want you to think\nabout me like so that you'll never get\nit wrong like that's but then it what is\nwhat if someone just hates you um this\nis terrible so sky this is so I started\nthis off with it requires courage on a\nlevel that you do have never experienced\nthis is terrible thought yes right you\nhave to you have to be willing to let\nthem hate you no no I I would rather\nthink about existing and death times 10\nthan this\nI know so it's is courage on an order of\nmagnitude that you have never well what\nif they what if they hate me but if I\njust was able to tell them a little\nabout lightning sky oh okay\nwhat would it feel like so you're scared\nof hate but I'm gonna ask you another\nquestion what would it feel like if if\nyou didn't manipulate someone and they\nchose to love you instead if they\nactually said you know what despite all\nof your BS and with you just being you\nand without manipulating me\nI love you how would that make you feel\nthere would be a comma afterwards I say\nI love you\nnow we're late for Quidditch is what I\nwould hear that's how crazy again it is\nto me\nlike that's what I would hear like Oh\neven though you didn't you know make me\nfeel a certain way about you I love you\nlet's go win for Gryffindor like and\nthat is how absolutely impossible but\nit's not like it's not like I'm a\nmonster or something it's that like I I\ndon't even really like I mean I hate\nmyself I mean many of us do we just\ndon't really want to say it so it's like\nif I hate Who I am oh well I'm not gonna\nlet up like other people see this mess\nas for what it is because then they'll\nhate me too that's crazy there's no way\nI have to show at least that I have the\ndesire and the will to change and be\nbetter otherwise what's the point why\neven beloved like if you're not gonna\nlove your soul this doesn't make sense\nto me damn I must sound like a psycho no\nI don't think you sound like a psycho I\nthink you sound like someone who was\nabused and it wasn't sufficiently loved\nwhen you were growing up that's what\nthat's what when people are abused and\ndon't have an appropriate home\nenvironment to get them through that\nabuse they end up sounding like you I\ndon't think you're psycho I think you're\nI think it's the only way that you've\nlearned how to survive this is this this\nall of these thoughts and constructions\nthat you have are about survival because\nthe thought that someone could see you\nfor who you are and accept you is\nmind-boggling and there's no [ __ ] way\nthat you're willing to risk it and\nbecause you never risk it you're never\ngetting data to the contrary of your\nopinion you've never given an\nopportunity for someone to love you so\nhow can you possibly be loved because at\nthis point you're just fake and and what\nI'm asking you to do requires a lot of\ncourage it requires you to let someone\nsee the real you and then let them make\ntheir own decision and then understand\nbecause it's devastating\nbecause I can even there's even a part\nof you that actually doubts that you're\nactually a piece of [ __ ] but you would\nrather sit in the comfort of the thought\nthat you're a piece of [ __ ] rather than\nrisk the the chance that it could be\nwrong and then like you really know for\na hundred percent because that's the\nsame thing as like my channel is like I\ncould put a hundred percent into my\nvideos I've never done that yeah I\nhaven't because you've got the slice of\nprotection right yeah right right and\nI've been actually a failure I just\ndidn't give it my all yeah and then now\nit's like so sky Icecrown sound it\nworked out - courage and courage courage\nI don't care about what looked out so\nyou just have to decide are you willing\nto live a life where you are willing to\nrisk are you willing to be loved are you\nwilling to be successful are you willing\nto fail are you willing to be rejected\nthis is the question you have to ask\nyourself do you want to try to live a\ndifferent way\nI don't know if I can and I don't know\nas I am right now I think of myself as\nhonestly like disgusting\nyeah like actually repulsive okay in in\nmind body everything so though it's like\nyep\ngive yourself some time okay so the\nfirst thing is I think it's good that\nyou're moving out and I think you're the\nmore that you prioritize yourself you're\ngonna build a little bit of confidence I\nthink it's actually a huge step forward\nthat you're moving out the second second\nthing is that I do think you can repair\nyour relationships and I think you could\npay off your debt and stuff like that\nnot to say that not not to say that that\nyou know that's a guaranteed or anything\nbut I have I have faith in you and\nthat's not just like because I'm just a\ngenerally good guy and I have faith in\npeople I think if you're able to make\nmoney at some point in life generally\nspeaking like you don't just randomly\nmake like oh sure winning the lottery is\nthe exception but even being like on UT\nYouTube personality or whatever a twitch\npersonality like there's some something\nthat resonated with your community\nthat's like still there it's like a\nskill that you have and as long as\nyou're able to kind of like pick it up\nand polish it off like I think you'll be\nable to start generating revenue again\nmaybe you won't maybe I have no idea\nwell I think it's possible for you and\nthat's like sort of an it like it's a\nscientific statement it's not like a you\nknow like oh I'm a nice dude oh yeah I\nmean I've clearly demonstrated yeah I\nhave the tools to do it yeah absolutely\nso so I think you can I think you can do\nthis I think the the last thing and I'm\ngonna try to help you with this of\ncourse but and we're gonna meditate I'm\nlistening and I'm also taking notes\nbecause what you just said to me III\nthink you have to just be willing to\nlike let yourself be wrong on all of\nthis stuff oh right because because like\nand I think what you're gonna get is\ngonna be just as amazing as Quidditch\nlike it's you're gonna be surprised like\nif you actually let yourself be loved by\nsomeone it's about as good as Quidditch\nyou know a flying broom I would take a\nflying broom over love free oh yeah okay\nwell I'm just saying like I see what you\nmean they're like I mean I'm sure isn't\namazing you know so I mean I'd say that\njust just for the sake of seeing what\nthat feels like\nI think you've got to try it so you can\nreport back and let us know how do i\nokay last question what is what do you\nfeel is the first step to trying that\ngood assuming I would we're gonna\nmeditate world that's gonna be number\none okay\nwhat is we're gonna meditate I'm gonna\nshow you how to do we're gonna do the\nfirst step right now\noh [ __ ] okay yeah sorry no procrastinate\non okay so this guy I want you to sit up\nstraight okay close your eyes\nand you guys can do this at home\nespecially if you resonate with sky cuz\nI'm gonna ask some weird questions so\nScott you're busted right like\nfundamentally agree well ways they\nbusted what do you mean like in a good\nway like you're like you're broken good\nyou're amazing no no no well you're like\na piece of crap\nah yes right that one incapable of being\nloved ah that is your fund about a\nbroken an unfixable so I want you to\ntell me I want you to try to find where\nthat comes from in your body so where\ndoes that feeling arise from like what\nis it that you can you find the like the\nfundamental brokenness within you the\npart of you that is unfixed does it live\nanywhere in in your being my weight okay\nyeah I would say my weight okay that's\nthe only thing I can see okay okay so\nare you saying that kind of\nintellectually or you're saying are you\nkind of like you're feeling the\nheaviness of your body and you're like\nyeah this is like kind of a busted thing\nit I mean I could even use this as an\nexample like just a minute ago you kind\nof readjusted yourself on a chair and\nyou sit up a bit and we could see your\nbody I never make a situation where\nthat's possible so it's like I'm already\nframe one manipulating the way that I\nlook just take selfie angles there's an\nentire show on catfishing like the the\nidea of being someone else or letting\npeople see with only what they need to\nsee okay is like close they stop talking\nfor a second and ah and where do you sew\nall the thoughts that you just had can\nyou find them somewhere in your body\neven if it's in your mind that's fine\nlike I know that sounds kind of weird\nbut like just just feel the person that\nyou are which is fundamentally someone\nwho is who is in control of the world\nand incapable of love that's the person\nthat you are agree or disagree is that\nthe person that you are right now\nyes that's Skye right and you were Skye\nstrongly agree okay now we're gonna try\nsome chanting which we did I think\nearlier in the week but for those of you\nwere here so we're gonna try to practice\nthis again so I'm gonna teach you how to\nchant ohm so this is gonna be kind of\nweird and hopefully we don't blow\neveryone's ears off\nso ohm is composed of three syllables\nah-hoo and mm okay so I'm gonna chant\nonce and you go through all three of\nthose sounds over the course of one\nbreath\nah\n[Laughter]\nOh\nokay so remember that Sapna chanting is\nabout not sound it's about vibration so\nI want you to feel the vibration in your\nbody as you chant those sounds okay so\nwe're gonna do it together and the sound\nis ie you ah ooh perfect\nyeah very good so let's do it together\nso deep breath in tight whoa hmm\nbigger breath let me hear it let me hear\nit again big deep breath okay yeah okay\nso I want you to spend longer on the ooh\nso big deep breath as big as you could\ntake and stretch it out as long as you\ncan one more time\ngood much better now I want you to\nincrease the vibration okay one more\ntime we'll do it together\n[Music]\nOh\ngood again\n[Music]\ny'all watching at home y'all should do\nthis - yeah actually paid okay let's say\nagain big breath in\n[Music]\nfour more breaths\nbig deep breath\ntwo more make them count\n[Music]\nlast one give it everything you've got\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nwhat the hell and I want you to just\nfeel the person that you are and try to\nget a sense of what what's wrong with\nthis person sort of feel the remnants of\nvibration just feel like how do you how\ndoes it feel right now like it feels\nlike I'm like my like I'm closing my\neyes obviously I feels like my mind is\nlike shaving off pieces on my mind it's\nweird like good keep shaving buddies\nlike yeah just yeah when you said is\nthis you said is this person terrible or\nsomething yeah I was always gonna answer\nno yeah it was weird\nyep but very weird right it's a new\nsensation to not be a terrible person\nall right\nI guess it is possible so it's not about\nwhether it's possible it's about trying\nokay so Skyy I want you to start by\ndoing this practice every day for three\nto five minutes nine breaths nine rounds\nthree to five minutes oh okay\nso nine breaths and just sit with the\nperson that you are before the practice\nit's a different sky from where you are\nafter the practice the feeling won't\nlast long but I want you to have an\nexperience of yourself where you aren't\na piece of [ __ ] and that starts for a\nfew moments after meditation just sit\nwith that person to hang out with that\nperson yeah\nokay okay okay all right\nquestions before we wrap up for the day\nyeah are you um god no like ah then\nthat's it that's all I had asked hey I\nappreciate know as usual know if I was\nif I was God then I couldn't actually\nhelp anyone but as it turns out Amin and\nso the cool thing about being human is\nthat the experiences that I have I can\nactually like the things that happen to\nme and my growth in life is actually\napplicable to other humans right so\nthat's kind of cool ah yeah\n[ __ ] well I I look forward to our next\nmeeting there's actually amazing I'm\nglad you feel that way yeah uh yeah okay\nso I'm gonna do that nine breaths every\nday yep because I think we're at the\nwhen it comes to me and my unfixable\nproblems the finish line is the what we\nbrought up earlier and I'm looking\nforward to at least trying what I can to\ndo it I'll do it I'll do whatever it\ntakes all right good I'm very happy to\nhear that so just give it your best and\ndon't beat yourself up when you\ninevitably screw up which is okay\nbecause screw ups are a normal part of\nlife and it doesn't mean that they can't\nbe fixed so if you miss a day on\nmeditation don't throw the baby out with\nthe bathwater just\npick it up the next day or in two days\nor in three days pick it up when you can\nwhen you're able to and I don't know\nwhere you live but if there's any kind\nof Meditation Center that you can go to\nthat could help a lot I'm gonna prove to\nbecause it helps to be in a community\nwith other people who meditate just to\nkeep you on on on track okay yeah all\nright thanks a lot sky good job thank\nyou thank you as usual thank you for\ntoday yeah man I'm gonna have a lot to\nthink about\nyeah I'm not willing to give up hope on\nyou yet and I'm glad that you're you're\nwilling to entertain the idea that maybe\nyou are fixable\nwell I'm gonna go shower and cry I'll\ntalk to you soon you know have a good\ncry my friend take care thank you all\nright\n[Music]"
