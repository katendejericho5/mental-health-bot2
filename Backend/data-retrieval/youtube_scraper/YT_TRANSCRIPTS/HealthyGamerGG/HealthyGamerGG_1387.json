    "transcript": "it was my idol right he's my father I'm\na young kid a boy and here he is like\nI'm like dad what happens when we die\nand he's like well you cease to exist in\nyour body brats\nwhat are you feeling now now we're\ngetting somewhere now you're feeling now\nthe armor is coming down what is that\nwhat are you feeling when you talk about\nyour dad when you tell that story you be\nI feel let down\nI feel abandoned right I feel vulnerable\nagain as I did more I see anger oh yeah\noh yeah fair\nof course one two three hi I'm Ethan\nEvans I'm happy to be here this is gonna\nbe fun my whole community is waiting too\nso we're all good to go\nis that better keep talking yeah sure\nlet's see what's reet auch about today\nyou were asking about the weather it's\ncold here we've had a ton of snow it's\nskiing time at the end of the day oh\nwhere are you located Seattle Washington\nactually I know you through Devin he and\nI were lucky enough to be in the same\ncity it's how we stream together\noh cool very cool oh okay he's too loud\nnow I'm too loud okay all right okay how\nabout okay I think we're good now\nso okay so so yeah so we're talking a\nlittle bit about sort of stress\nmanagement and burnout we're talking\nabout workplace stress yeah yeah not so\nmuch burnout but I'm an executive at\nAmazon and so I wanted I thought it'd be\na good topic for us to talk about about\nhow people could handle their stress at\nwork and of course people would love for\nyou to advise me how to be a less\nstressful boss for them okay like what\ncan executives do differently and then I\nhave my own stress issues I'm happy to\nshare okay and learn about cuz we have\nthis time and we have next Friday - yeah\nso I think the first thing is oddly\nenough what I do want which is not\nactually what my area of expertise is\nwhat my area of expertise is is what we\nare talking about yes so I know that in\nmy day job I I do some work at different\nkinds of corporations investment banks\nstartups hospitals in sort of stress\nmanagement programs and sort of helping\npeople optimize their performance manage\nstress things like that so this is I\nlove talking about this stuff because\nit's kind of right up my alley so what\nis - yeah go ahead\nall right that's that's that's that's\nwhat I thought would be good is this is\nlike your sweet spot and yet I have to\nthink because the stream I do on Twitch\nis like what Devin does a lot we're\ntrying to help people build their\ncareers and be successful at work so\nit's not classic gaming at all and\nstress and managing stress is a lot\nabout having a successful career\nabsolutely so\nhaving occur a successful career is also\nabout managing stress yes true yeah so I\ntend to work best when I use actual like\nscenarios as opposed to abstract\nexamples yep so can you just tell me a\nlittle bit about what you find stressful\nor what people in your workplace might\nmay find stressful yeah I thought a lot\nabout this so Amazon is famously known\nas a difficult workplace and we have a\nnumber of leadership principles one of\nwhich is called high standards and the\nleadership principle reads Amazon has\nrelentlessly high standards standards\nthat others may find unreasonable and so\nas a leader I'm supposed to hold people\nto this and also my managers also hold\nme to it\nso then being specific like a specific\nsituation would be performance of a\nprogram I'm working on I'll have to be a\nlittle circumspect about you know\nfinancial details and stuff but if a\nprogram isn't hitting financial goals or\nisn't hitting growth goals you have a\nton of stress because you know you're\ngoing to be asked about it you know\nyou're going to spend time writing long\nexplanations of why it is and culturally\nit is common for leaders to still\nexpress disappointment to say well okay\nyou've explained it all but it's still\nlike the fundamental problem is it's\nstill not good enough results do better\nand often their feedback is more you go\ndo better or not I can help you okay so\nso I think so this is your culture\nsounds a lot like the culture of you\nknow top tier academic medical centers\nyes so so you know I think any any time\nyou go to sort of the top of a field if\nyou're talking about like a place like\nGoldman Sachs or Mass General Hospital\nwhich are amazing institutions they have\na very sort of outcome oriented approach\nright and and results are what matters\nso like in the world of academic\nmedicine research funding can be very\ncutthroat and whether like whether you\nget you live or die by your grand\nand if you don't get a grant you don't\nhave a job yep and it can be very hard\nand so that's just sort of the culture\nbecause it's a culture of performance\nright yeah absolutely and that's our\nculture too yeah so the first question\nthat I have for you is does a culture of\nperformance lead to the best performance\nI don't know the thought would be of\ncourse it does right the performance is\nimportant then that you're setting the\nstandard and that you're talking about\nit and so a culture of performance\nshould create performance that would be\nthe idea that's generally what people\nthink right which is why they have\ncultures of performance because they\nbelieve that if we have a culture of\nperformance then people will live up to\nthe standard that we set and it's all\nabout meeting standards yeah so let's\njust talk about you for a second okay\nwhen have you done when do you do your\nbest work so huh I love how you put me\non the spot I actually do my best work\noutside of work like not in the office\nwhen I can get clear thinking time I do\nthe best work in my lounge chair sitting\nover here in my house okay so let's just\nthink about what that means yeah you say\nI do my best work when I get clear\nthinking time yep right so the question\nis what are the risk factors for clear\nthinking time and what are the risk\nfactors for unclear thinking time okay\nso what leads to unclear thinking\ndistractions sure and mental pressure or\nfeeling attacked or judged because then\nyou're spending your time on your\nemotions and on how you're gonna get\nyourself feeling better so that you can\nfocus on the actual work okay so when\nyou're thinking about how your boss is\ngoing to respond to your work product\nyeah what does that do to your thinking\nwell it adds stress it can add clarity\nin the sense that you can reason through\nlike okay what is my boss need if I\nthink he's going to respond this way can\ni address that so it can add clarity but\nparticularly if the feedback from a\nleader is negative it can also just get\nyou churning and cycling on absolutely\nI feel judged I feel inadequate so just\nto be clear like if we're talking about\nthose feelings do those put us in a\nclear thinking mindset earn unclear\nthinking unclear\nuncaps aloo right now so if we stop and\nwe actually think about you you do your\nbest work when you're thinking clearly\nwhich is sort of a no-brainer and the\ninteresting thing is that you you sort\nof talk about sitting particularly in a\nlounge chair so there's a space that's\nsort of like a stress-free space where\nyou're not actually concerned about how\nyour bosses are gonna respond to\nsomething so you can actually devote\nyourself to the thing that your bosses\nwant you to do yep right you can devote\nyourself to the work as opposed to\ndevoting yourself to performance yes\nwhat do you think about that is that I\nmean disagree let's think about caveats\nrestate the proposition ones so you do\nyour best work when you have a clear\nhead and when you have a clear head\nyou're not actually thinking about\nperformance in fact what I would say\nthat a clear head is for you is that\nyou're not worried about performance and\nyou're worried about the task at hand or\nthe actual work there's doing the work\nand then there's whether the work lives\nup to standards right you know it's like\ncreating a good product and whether my\nboss is gonna be happy with these are\nseparate things in your mind yep you\nshould be focused on doing the best work\nnot what people are gonna think of it if\nyou focus on work product you get the\nbest work\nwhat does Amazon's work culture well\nit's hard to generalize 600,000 people\nwhat\nAmazon's work culture has a lot of\nreview another principle we have is\ncalled dive deep and so leaders\nincluding myself were expected to audit\nothers okay expected to dig into what\nthey're doing and then my leaders above\nme or\nto dig into and audit what I'm doing\nabsolutely and so you can anticipate or\nexpect being audited yeah and and so\nthat puts the culture is one where you\nend up thinking about the standards not\njust about the work and how do you think\nthat impacts the work that's the\noperative question to the I think so I\nfeel like you're fishing in a sense and\nI want to give a dual answer fine\noverly stressing about it lowers the\nquality of work being aware of the\nstandards so that you know what the goal\nis has value but when that tips over\ninto fear or worry it becomes a\ndistraction yeah so I think I think\nyou're you're sort of right that I'm\nkind of fishing for something and in a\nsense I think that in my mind that's the\nright answer\nso I think one thing that we oftentimes\nforget about stress is that we use the\nword stress to actually mean distress so\nthere are two types of stress there's\nyou stress and distress but we've lost\nthat distinction yes you stress I've\nheard that term and know about it but\nyou're right I never hear it and so\nthat's just because we sort of forget\nthat like okay so when you have\ncapabilities and you have a task the\nrelationship between your capabilities\nand your task results in a number of\ndifferent things if the task outweighs\nyour capabilities your D you're in\ndistress because your handle it if the\ntask is too easy then what happens to\nyour performance you become bored and\nyou may do the task okay but your\nmotivation drops absent or so would you\nsay that that your effort towards the\ntask and your success at the task if the\neasier the task gets what happens to the\nquality of the work that you produce\ndoes it just get higher and higher no I\nthink it flatlines if the task is really\neasy you sort of take it to a limit and\nthen you move on and you look for\nsomething else\nABB's\nright so that's kind of weird because if\nwe're saying that the difficulty of the\ntask is like a like if we talk about a\nslope right now and if and this is our\ncapability and here's the difficulty of\nthe task know that as we go to high our\nperformance drops but interestingly\nenough if we go to low our performance\nactually drops yep makes sense that\nmiddle zone is what's called you stress\nso this is when the body and brain are\nliterally primed to wear so you have a\ncertain amount of stress hormones that\nare active so one example of this is\nlike adrenaline where adrenaline causes\nyou to literally lose your peripheral\nvision and focus on a narrow perspective\nlike literally if you look at the stunt\nthe physiology of the eye when you have\nadrenaline at a high level in your body\nnormally your peripheral vision is\nactually about 180 degrees which a lot\nof people don't realize right and then\nas adrenaline increases it narrows down\nto a field of view of 30 degrees yep and\nso i've experienced this yeah so at 180\nit's easy to become distracted because\nyou're seeing this over there and you're\nseeing this over there but if your\nadrenaline level is too too high then\nyou also get this sort of tunnel vision\nwhen it's easy to lose perspective and\nwhen you talk about an unclear mind I\nthink you're kind of hitting it right on\nthe head where you know you want to know\nthat people are gonna be checking your\nwork you want to know that your bosses\nare gonna be expecting a lot from you\nbut then you can easily collapse down in\na tunnel vision where you start worrying\nabout that and then we tip into the\ndistress we tip into non optimal\nperformance no and I think I've thought\nabout it right I've been at Amazon 15\nyears I've had a lot of time to think\nabout the culture I think a lot of the\nculture and I think this is common in\nworkplaces leaders lead through a\nscarcity mindset where they believe that\nif they say too much positive about your\nwork you'll get lazy in other words if\nthey're not constantly pushing you'll\nyou won't do it out of your own\nmotivation you're only doing it because\nyou're being challenged and the result\nis most of the\nin many cases I hear this Donnell ID not\nonly see it I hear it a lot most of the\nfeedback is okay that was great\nnow here's 12 more things that could be\nbetter right in other words when\nsomething gets evaluated it's one good\nthing about it and then ten possible\nimprovements yeah so I think the that's\nyou know I understand how that works\nbecause I think that's also how the\ncultures of like most top and companies\nor institutions in their field function\ntime and at the same time I don't\nbelieve in my experience I think there's\nanother way which is actually better\ntell me more so so this is sort of\nfinding that area of you stress where\nthe degree of stress that you have\nactually Prime's your mind enough and\ngets you to I think a good example of\nthis is the flow State so you stress\nfacilitates a flow State yes so you\ncan't be bored and get into a flow\nstraight I can't be panicked and get\ninto a flow State that there are good\nstudies that show that optimal work\nproduct comes from a flow State but I\nthink the culture that Amazon has and\nit's not my place to judge but you know\nwe're talking about I'm not saying it's\ngood I think it's common so MGH is the\nsame way Harvard Medical School is the\nsame way is that they have a very\nperformance oriented culture that often\ntimes tips people into distress and\nimpostor syndrome and these kinds of\nthings and that at the end of the day\nsomeone who is that that's not going to\nbe the best work product that I think\nthat like the best work product comes\nwhen you have an employee who's actually\ninspired to do the thing that they want\nto do and you do have a certain amount\nof kind of oversight that keeps people\nhonest because there's also studies that\nshow that if you really give people a\nfree rein that are gonna start slack off\nand they're gonna work just as hard as\nthey can to like not get fired now so\nboth - yep and I think it also depends\non on what level you're talking about\nwithin an organization because I think\nthat when people have demonstrated a\nhigh degree of internal motivation and\nvalue with like putting out like they\ndemonstrate personal pride and doing\ngood work I think you can be more\nencouraging\nbecause they're gonna have that natural\nfor lack of a better term like\nneuroticism so an in medical school for\nexample medical students are highly\nhighly neurotic which is how we get\nthere so we worry a lot on the inside\nwe're afraid that we didn't study enough\nwe're afraid that we're not gonna do\nwell enough on the test our neuroticism\nis already high enough in it and it\nstrives us to be successful in the world\nit's not a negative trait in terms of\nperformance but once you get to medical\nschool you would be amazed at how much\nyou can get a medical student to perform\nbecause their neuroticism is already\nhigh they don't need it from their boss\nin fact encouragement in like lets them\ndo better so like when you say hey like\nI can see that you learned a lot about\nlisinopril and ace inhibitors that's\nawesome I think this patient is really\ngoing to do better because you kind of\nknow this information it's really useful\ninformation and then I'm like what's\nthat like what's that what they're gonna\ndo is go home the next day and they're\ngonna be like since they're so starved\nfor positive reinforcement there that is\ngonna reinforce their behavior to be\nlike tomorrow when I go to work I want\nthem to say that again and I want them\nto say it again and I want them to say\nit again that's like an endorphin hit\nright positive feedback in a high and a\nhigh performance culture yeah and and I\nthink interestingly I don't think we do\na very good job of that in corporate\nAmerica in other words what you're\ndescribing in the medical school is\nactually more positive than what and of\ncourse I'm generalizing I'm speaking for\nmy own experience and not on behalf of\nthe company but I see some leaders do\nbetter than others but overall it's it's\na there's an opportunity for improvement\nthere and that's what I'm interested\nboth in sharing with our audiences and\nalso your advice on how we can like\nchange corporate America a little bit\nover time yeah so I think let's I'm\ngonna take a step back that's really\nuseful to know so first of all you know\nthe main question is does the culture of\nperformance actually lead to optimal\nperformance right and my aunt's I think\nthat while we see it widely amongst\ncorporate America and top-tier\ninstitutions so I think that the data\nsort of would imply that the answer is\nthe\nI think there's a lot of interesting\nwork work happen to get like HBS and\nother places where I do a little bit of\nwork here there right it that suggests\notherwise so like I know that when I go\nto actual like investment banks or\nprivate equity fund firms and I teach\nthem how to meditate and I teach them\nsort of a different way to look at\nthings they their performance actually\nimproves so like their metrics get\nbetter and what I mean by that is so I\nthink the real challenge here so Ethan\nlet me ask you a question so first of\nall a couple questions one is that I can\nlike kind of talk and if that's good and\nwhat you're interested in I can continue\nto do that so I was gonna explain like\none very important nuance that I think a\nlot of corporate America doesn't\nunderstand the other thing that I can do\nis ask you more personal questions about\nlike your specific stress and and\nbecause I think we're gonna we can get a\nlot of rich information there I don't\nknow what you're interested in or what\nyou signed up for so I'm I did sign up\nyou know I've watched a bunch of your\nshows because I co stream with Devin\nlike you did in the past\nso I'm perfectly happy to talk about\nmyself and reveal personal get out my\nown struggles since I'm an executive I'm\nnot sure that's always the most helpful\nto our audiences who aren't always there\nI don't know but I'm happy to do that\nso I'll let you be the judge of what's\nmost effective to help people because I\nknow that's your goal as well as mine\nyou can also just talk a little bit if\nyou want I don't have any problem having\na bit of a lecture so okay sure\nso I'm gonna explain one concept which I\nsuspect may lay the foundation for our\ndiscussion may or may not and as it\ncrops up and then I'll start asking you\nmore personal perfect let's do questions\nso I'm gonna just lay a little bit of a\nfoundation for with like a five minute\nsegment so what a clear mind does the\nbest work right yes totally one of the\nbiggest problems that\nclouds of mind is attachment to\nparticular things and so one of the\ngoals of meditative practice is to be\ndetached from the outcomes of your\nactions so this is a Sanskrit word\ncalled Vairagya and they see they\nbelieve that like peace comes from\nVairagya so just to give you an example\nyou know if I like a girl and I want to\nask her out\nI can torture myself all kinds of ways\nabout whether she's gonna say yes how to\nget her to say yes things like that\nwell some of that could be calculated\nlike I could do certain nice things I\ncan dress a certain way I can get her\nflowers whatever so there is some value\nto sort of that that kind of\nself-flagellation that I put myself\nthrough but at the end of the day the\nbest course of action is probably just\nto ask her out with confidence and then\nlet her decide right I don't try to\ncontrol whether she says yes or whether\nshe says no but that's not how we\nactually operate we try to control\nwhether she is going to say yes or say\nno and in the process of controlling how\nanother human being reacts we torture\nourselves so much up with me yeah it's\nthe it's the rain the rain acronym from\nmeditation right rain is uh recognize\nacknowledge introspect and then\nnon-attachment\nyeah perfect right so fight argue is\nthat last part yeah where are you\nultimately you kind of say and the funny\nthing is that if you think about like\nwhat kind of person is gonna say yes\nlike I realized this in my own life\nshockingly so you know I had a very\nunsuccessful dating life until I sort of\nand entered into a relationship and then\nreally stopped caring because I was in a\nrelationship right and then started\nhanging out with people and then\nsuddenly like women are treating me very\ndifferently and I was trying to think\nabout like why is that the most extreme\nof which was I don't even know if I\nshould share this because I don't have\nthis person but so one day I was on call\nat the hospital right and someone that I\nhad worked with showed up intoxicated at\n2:00 in the morning okay and was playing\nPokemon go and I was like woman what are\nyou doing here I\nand she was just and so then I was like\nlook I'm busy but it's great to see you\nhave fun catching your Pokemon and you\nknow as much as I don't I mean I have to\nthink that people don't just show up at\nthe hospital when you're working like\nthey know you're on call right oh it's\nthe middle of the night and so I have to\nthink about like how does that happen\nright did I suddenly magically become\nmore attractive I don't think so\nI think what happened is like I stopped\nI you know I started just behaving with\nconfidence and that actually like gets\nthe outcome that you sort of want but\nthe more that you worry about the\noutcome the harder the outcome is to\nattain totally yeah yeah that\noveranalyzing an analysis paralysis\nthose things [ __ ] people it happens a\nlot in public speaking absolutely right\nso so when when public speaking is\nanother great example of like the goal\nis to just go up there and talk about\nwhat you want to talk about don't worry\nabout the thousands of people so one bit\nof advice that I got about public\nspeaking is pretend you're talking to\none person don't talk to an audience\ntalk to one person works really well so\nthe the challenge though is a lot of\npeople say if I become detached from the\nconsequences of my actions doesn't that\nmean that I stopped caring and this is a\nbig challenge where people say like but\ncaring about the outcome is what has\ndriven me to succeed so far so like if I\nstopped caring about the outcome doesn't\nit mean that I'm not gonna be successful\nand the short answer is no because\nthere's a difference between apathy\nwhich is not caring and attachment which\nis detachment is giving it your all and\nnot worrying about the consequence not\nbeing paranoid about the consequence\nsuch reality to do absolutely it's a\nhard duality absolutely so I suspect\nthat when we come to you know this is\njust because I've done a lot of kind of\ncorporate consulting and stuff and\ngenerally this conundrum comes up where\npeople recognize that fear of\nconsequence and a particular consequence\nis what has allowed them to get to this\npoint but that like they can still\nperform but it causes them intense\npersonal suffering and it's my\nhypothesis that intense personal\nsuffering doesn't actually lead to\noptimal performance and\nwhen I talked to more and more people\nlike you and I asked you when do you do\nyour best work it's not when you're\nsuffering it's when you're devoted to\nthe action at hand and you're calm and\nyou're thinking clearly\nwell it's flow State it's magic set me\nhigh and and flow state for sure so\nlet's talk a little bit about your\npersonal any questions about that so far\nnot for me no I got it okay so let's\ntalk a little bit about your personal\nsituation and kind of what you find\nstressful within the bounds of what you\ncan yeah of course\nthe the thing that stresses me out the\nmost I guess is you every human well I\ndon't know I will talk about me I want\ncredit for good intentions now what that\nmeans is when I bust my ass on something\nand I attempt to do my best work and it\nfalls short I already know that and so I\nwant help fixing it not repeated\npointing out that it didn't meet the bar\nuntil my highest stress specifically\ncomes from feeling misjudged so here's\nan example I can talk about that's\noutside of work but very crystalline I\nhad a doctor's appointment and the\ndoctor had two offices small medical\nprocedure doesn't matter what I was\ngetting I was getting something removed\noff my skin but I went to the wrong\noffice because they had two offices and\nI confused the office so I was there on\ntime but at the wrong office and so as\nan example you can excavate that has\nnothing to do with the Amazon but shows\nthe problem is I just beat myself up\nlike oh my god this has to be\nrescheduled and he's a specialist and\nit's gonna take three months to get back\non his calendar and how could I be so\nDominus to go to the wrong office and I\njust got into a very because I'm a\nhigh-performance person I was down on\nmyself for having\ndone something so foolish or small as to\npick the wrong doctor's office and the\nsame thing happens at work where you\nhave total right intentions you do\neverything you set up the appointment or\nyou do the work you deliver the work and\nthen it falls slightly short or there's\na good intention but small mistake and\nbasically in our workplace added to my\nown maybe recriminations on myself would\nbe workplace negative feedback of likes\nlittle you know you've made an error and\nwe need to make sure that you know\nyou've made an error because we're busy\nsetting the standard the performance\nculture okay I see a little bit of a\nfork in the road in terms of we're\ntalking more about you because I think a\nlot of this so I think that so I mean do\nyou want to talk about the workplace and\nstress or do you want to talk about you\nlike I kind of I want to talk about I\nthought that would be a good I think\nit's a great yeah it's great\nwell I thought it would be good about\nhow to manage stress and I think because\nI think most of the stress comes from\ninside ourselves ABS right it's it's yes\nother people may add to it or attempt to\nadd to it but how we process that\ndetermines how much it impacts us\nbeautiful right so that's the that's the\nfork in the road that I see is I think a\nlot of this comes from you it has\nnothing to do with Amazon's work culture\nlike all those work culture probably\nlike is synergistic with it but this\ncomes from you okay let's talk about\nthat I wanted something so and how long\nhow long have you been beating yourself\nup for making silly mistakes\noh geez my whole life okay yeah I know\nmy family particularly my father did\nthat so going all the way back to like\nchildhood experience my father was very\ndown on himself for simple mistakes\n[Music]\nhe believed that there was no such thing\nas an accident\nthat that there was only carelessness\nand so I grew up in a culture and the\nclassic example we talk about my family\nof this is his coffee cup our family\ncoffee cups had saucers and if he\nspilled coffee bumped his cup so that\ncoffee went over the edge end of the\nsaucer he would say oh what an idiot\nwhat a complete fool and that was his\njudgment of himself for having spilled\ncoffee which you're like oh my god you'd\nyou know wipe it up throw it out like\nwho cares but I grew up in a family\nculture where there wasn't any such\nthing as a mistake there was only\ncarelessness so that's kind of\ninteresting because you're talking about\nyour dad modeling yes self-critical\nnests and sort of a lack of compassion\nor forgiveness or a lack of acceptance\nthat everything isn't perfect correct\nand that you know life sometimes has a\ncertain amount of randomness to it but\nin his mind there's no such thing as\nrandomness there was just a lack of\npreparation to account for randomness\nright right right so that's him what\nabout you\nuh I definitely internalize that but\ndon't you say that about stuff that you\ndid oh yeah for sure\nlike what\nso I grew up on a farm and we used to\nhave a lot of power tools and sharp\nthings and his advice to me all through\nmy life was it's not if it's when\nmeaning it's not if you cut yourself\nit's win and so eventually when I was 17\nI cut I was I was out cutting brush and\nI cut the end off my thumb like just a\nlittle chunk but I didn't know how much\nI'd cut off so I ran into the house like\nholding my thumb inside my hand and I\nsaid dad I need you to take me to the\nhospital I cut off part of my thumb and\nhe started a lecture like he started to\nsay I've told you and I told you this\nwas come\nand how could you be so stupid now I was\nI was older at that point I was 16 so I\nwas mature enough to say dad you can\nyell at me later we need to go and he\nwas able to cut it off at that point\nuntil it you know he had enough\nrationality like okay that's a good\npoint\nbut his initial instinct was lecture me\non carelessness can so I think that\ncarries forward how does it feel to tell\nthat story well knowing uh you know I\nhave my audience on your audience I how\ndoes it feel it feels embarrassing right\nthat that was the environment because\nwe're trained not to share I we I don't\nknow I am trained not to share internal\nfamily skeletons and so to talk poorly\nof your father or an experience you had\nit's embarrassing it's humiliating who's\nbeing humiliated I don't know I feel\nhumiliated like I feel that whether I\nshould or not I feel like oh I'm part of\na family that had flaws that was not\nthat had this weird behavior and so\nthat's embarrassing yeah so I think that\nfeeling makes a lot of sense how did you\nfeel when your dad started lecturing you\nat that moment I felt shocked I felt\nlike wow this is inappropriate and\nthat's in fact why I was able to\ninterrupt it uh-huh because what's led\nto a lot of my career success is I'm\nvery processed and outcome oriented and\nso I was able to prioritize and say so\nyeah sometimes I interrupt people when\nthey're talking right go ahead\nokay please so when when someone is\nlecturing you for a mistake that you\nknow you made how do you feel\nlecture for them is I feel bad I feel\ndoubly bad because I already know okay\nso what is bad so bad as an umbrella\nmotion what is the emotion underneath\nthe bat\nwhat a feeling the feeling I'm feeling\nis inadequate that if I had done better\nnot only would the results have been\nbetter but now I would not be getting\ntold that the result was not good I\nwouldn't be getting lectured okay so I\nthink there's in adequacy which is what\nyou put on yourself right I think\nthere's another shade of an emotion\nthere which has to do with the\ninteraction of reporting okay right so\nin once again I'm fishing right but\nthere's a second feeling right one is\nyou know you [ __ ] up that's the\ninadequacies at the carelessness that's\nwhat you guys do you want to know what\nthe other feeling is there's some\nanother feeling feeling when you walk\ninto the room and you have to report to\nyour superiors that the program that\nyou're running isn't up to par you felt\ninadequate the night before yes you\nrealized it wasn't there there's another\nfeeling when you go in there's a fear of\nbeing judged so there's fearfulness\nand/or shame because you're about to\nexpose your feeling of inadequacy to\nsomeone else\nuh-huh and so remind me again what were\nyou feeling as you told that story\nhumiliation and what were you afraid of\nexposing that exposing exposing the\nfamily weakness yeah yeah do you think\nthose are related\nof course particularly when you draw\nthem out that way\nyeah well because I and I think a lot of\npeople that I project I try to project\ncompetence\nI try to be competent and I wish to be\nviewed as competent and so when I have\nto admit to an error I do it but it puts\na hole in my shell or image of\ncompetence at least to myself even if\nnot to others\nabsolutely okay so\nso I know I mean I'm sorry cuz I go for\nit tricks to what I do but I think that\nwhen you were telling that story you\nwere not just experiencing emotions from\nthe present I think you were\nexperiencing the emotions of that moment\nbecause that's what happens when we\nremember things right you replay yep\nright so I think there's a certain\namount of humiliation that you feel\nbecause you're airing your dirty laundry\non stream right there's a certain amount\nof recalled humiliation because that's\nhow it feels when someone tell like just\nthink about this for a second when I cut\noff a piece of my thumb right and I go\nto someone and they say hey dumbass you\ncut off a piece of your thumb right like\nhumiliation is at the top of the list\nfor how you feel it's like yeah I know\nall right and you're telling me that\nlike your biggest problem is that like\nyou don't get credit for trying your\nbiggest problem is that like you know\nyou know you messed up you know it's not\ngood enough you don't actually have a\nbeef with that because you know given\ntime and support you will fix it because\nthat is what you [ __ ] do yes you will\nfix it yourself yeah it's just why can't\nother people see that correct you nailed\nit so then the question becomes where\ndoes that come from right so the only\nperson who is concerned about their\nimage the maintenance of their image is\nthe person who doesn't actually have\nconfidence in themselves okay\nand the weird thing is that you do have\nconfidence in yourself except for the\ntimes that you don't of course yes does\nthat make sense yes like because I know\nI can tell already that like I know that\nyou get the job done like I know that\nyou will double down and you will make\nsure that given time like you just have\nto account for certain variables market\nforces changes in X Y Z you will get it\ndone right and so I know that you're\nconfident in yourself but something\nhappens something awakens within you\nthat makes you feel the same way that\nyou did when you cut off your thumb and\nyour dad is lecturing yes and even in\nthat moment there's that feeling of\nhumiliation and then there's the there's\nlike the functional executive at Amazon\nEthan that was\nalready alive at the age of 16 and says\nhey dad you can lecture me later right\nnow this [ __ ] needs to get taken care of\nyep and even now when you feel that\nhumiliation when you walk into that\nboardroom there's a part of you that's\nlike your 16 year old self which says\nthis just needs to get addressed and\nit'll be okay if you guys just cut me\nsome slack and then there's the part of\nyou that feels humiliated right that's\nright let's jive yeah I've definitely\nhad that experience at work also they're\nlike oh yeah yeah yeah what is that that\nyou said so much there but I don't I\ndidn't understand it I don't know people\nunderstood\nwhat is that that's it what is that well\nit's for me that uh was I do it to\nmyself and at some level I'm choosing\nthe feel the way I feel I'm choosing I\nknow I can get the job done but the\nprocess of having other people give me\nfeedback or be skeptical of that fact\nfor a minute\nhurts yeah absolutely so let's dig into\nthat right because you said something\nabout I forget exactly your exact\nphrasing but you were saying something\nalong the lines of that you know when\nwhat you know you're gonna get it done\nbut they don't see that so you have to\ntry extra hard to like feel like but use\nthe word shell I think yeah right\nhe's right can you share that can you\njust say a little bit more about that I\nthink that's important so because of our\nperformance culture and because of the\npatterns you've observed you know and\ncan predict that when a mistake has been\nmade or something isn't going as planned\nor isn't achieving goals that that\nfeedback about that is coming and so\nthere is absolutely a psychological\nprocess of armoring yourself putting up\nyour shell whatever you want to call it\nand say okay I know we have a we have a\nleadership principle again or it's\ntalked about a lot in Amazon it's been\nwritten down before called vocally\nself-critical where we expect leaders in\nthe company to acknowledge their\nmistakes and and we call it vocally\nself-critical where we expect them to\nactually talk about I and my team's\nperformance was not good enough itemize\nhow because the concept is make sure\nthat we don't call things good when\nthey're not or that we don't have\ndefensiveness about performance in other\nwords the goal is whether it works or\nnot the mental goal is that we want\nleaders that can introspect and accept\nthe fact that it may not have worked or\nmay not be meeting goals and can then\ntake steps to address it but vocally\nself-critical has unfortunately built\ninto it a bit of a public abasement\nelement right like it and I don't know I\ndon't know how to disentangle those two\nyeah so I think that you know once again\nthat's kind of a cultural thing where I\nthink that you know being self-critical\nin and having like external audits and\nthings like that or a healthy part of\nbecoming better at your job\nso in psychiatry for example we have\nsomething called supervision so in\nsupervision what happens you can have\npeer supervision so a group of\npsychiatrists will get together right\nand like one of them will present a case\nthey'll say like okay I'm I'm working\nwith this case she has anxiety this this\nthis I've tried this I've tried this I\ndon't know what's going on it doesn't\nseem to be working so we also vocally\nshare our shortcomings in terms of work\nperformance yep and and we also are\ninviting people to actually audit so\nusually if you do a really formal\nsupervision like you'll write up between\nthree and five pages about a case from\nstart to finish and you'll hand it to\nsomeone and say like okay I started this\nmedication at this time I did this at\nthis time I did this at this time right\noh I I guess I'm sorry my I'm speaking\ntoo loudly it's okay you're excited I do\nthe same thing so and and so what\nhappens is there's also like an audit\nprocess yeah there's also a self\ncritical aspect to it but I think that\nsomething has happened in in y'all's\nculture where it does become shaming in\nsome way yes and that's that's both what\nI experienced myself personally and at\nwork yeah and I think it's true of parts\nof the culture and so I'm looking for\nhow to address that for myself and\nideally at least for my section of the\nculture so let's just take a step back\naway from culture because I think that's\na number of conversation let's focus on\nyou for me yep when did you start\nputting your armor on I definitely put\non armor very early in my childhood I'm\nthe youngest child my house was\ncombative verbal no didn't have physical\nabuse but verbal arguments amongst\nsiblings and parents was common and so\n[Music]\nso I developed a very thick armor the\nresult of which is as an example I can\ngenerally do things many people can't if\nyou and I were to meet and you were to\nyell at me like literally yell at me or\nget red in the face or shout or or I\ncould\nmostly turn that off and expert later\nbut I could experience it and not run\nfrom the room or be broken down or\nbecause I'm used to that environment\nyeah I mean it almost sounds like a\ndissociative capacity yes I don't know\nall the right words but that is correct\nI can I can just sort of leave the room\nmentally and be like okay this is going\non how does it feel to say that well\nI've talked about it with it's not new\nto me to discuss it because I I've\ndiscussed it with other professionals\nbut it's weird I will admit I have a\ncertain I value it and also don't want\nit because I know it's built up from\nadverse experiences but I also know its\nutility in a crisis mm-hmm very good\nright so there's a certain amount of\nalmost pride and comfort in it yes I got\nwhat I thought was just a hint of\nsadness sure yes there's a it's cut me\noff from people in other words I've been\ndescribed as cold and certain I spent my\nwhole life at some level adapting\nbecause when I left my household and\nwent to college I having grown up on a\nfarm you could even say I was poorly\nsocialized or a relatively few social\ninteractions compared to others I didn't\nunderstand that the whole world didn't\ninteract that way hmm so like I would\nresolve conflict by shouting or you know\nby getting animated and I had to quick\nand I'm a big guy you can't necessarily\ntell but I'm six-two\nI also used to be heavier and so I was I\nwas obese basically so I was I was about\n280 pounds and I was kind of a huge guy\nand so when that huge young man got\nfired up other people were like what the\nhell is this and so I had to learn to\ndial back like oh the rest of the world\ndoesn't actually interact by shouting at\nabuse newsflash\nthat's impressive that you were able to\nbecause a lot of people aren't able to\nrewire like that lifetime journey\nright you know I'm 50 now and you know\nthat's a 20 year old me that had to\nlearn those lessons Ethan can you tell\nme about your mom sure my mother so I'm\nthe youngest and so both my parents have\npassed away essentially of old age at\nthis point my mom died last summer she\nwas very critical and specifically at\nsome point I don't know my late 30s or\n40s I said mom you never actually say\nyou love me or you love your kids and\nshe said yeah I can't my mom never did\nit for me I can't say I physically\ncannot say I love you so that was an\ninteresting and for my mom nothing was\never good enough\nshe was the matron of the family the\nstronger personality and yeah so she\ndrove she drove people very hard I think\nthe best ensured it well I probably\ngiven you everything you need to know by\nsaying she felt she couldn't say you\nlove she loved you but I do you think\nwhat do you think I need well I mean\njust enough information about my mom a\npresident only about your mom uh it\ntells me she had her own issues right\nthat they she expressed that her mom had\nnever expressed love for her\nvery unusual for that generation my my\ngrandfather actually divorced my\ngrandmother which in the 1920s and 30s\nwas unusual and so in reconstructing it\nmy mom doesn't did not have a positive\nrelationship with any male in her life\nEthan what is what does all this say\nabout her son\nwhat can I understand about her son from\nunderstanding who she is\nuh that's a question I haven't thought\nabout yeah you thought\na lot about this haven't you oh yeah\nsure\nwell I'm so I should share I guess I'm\nan insight junkie like in other words\nwhat I specifically mean by that is I\nwas excited to talk to you not only\nbecause I think it's good twitch and\ngood for my community good for yours\nbut because I'm always interested to\nlearn more about myself\nyeah and so like my whole team yesterday\nis a different I'll come back to your\npoint took the disc test together\nyesterday my whole leadership team about\n30 of us in a room going through\npersonality profiles because I'm always\nlooking for more insight so I said it's\nbeen a lifetime journey to modify my\nbehavior that is true and so what you're\nseeing is yes 30 years of working to\nunderstand why do I behave like I do\nwhat part is valuable and innate and I\nshould keep an enhance and what part\nshould I control or filter the\nrelentless pursuit of positivity and\ngrowth yes and the relentless part is\nfairly strong they're like I'm over\nindex on it\nmmm-hmm yeah so well so the that you\nknow the the the unfortunate thing about\nthe relentlessness is that it's fueled\nby a sense of inadequacy I agree with\nthat yes I'm aware of that so that's a\nproblem right so then then like so now\nwe get to Vairagya and apathy because\nthe question is if we take away your\nsense of inadequacy what happens ah so\nI'd like to think I've matured to where\nI'll continue to work on be if I could\ntake away your inadequacy with a snap of\na finger would you want me to in this\nmoment yeah totally I am because I\nbelieve I I still do a lot of the things\nI do I have inadequacy\nis not my only motivation so I don't\nfear collapse into inaction but because\nmy only motivation is covering my\ninadequacy the inadequacy is deep and\nreal yeah but I've matured no I know\nthat but it's it's I've matured enough\nto where I want to be I want to\ncontribute positively to the world\nbecause I have skills and value I can\noffer and not because I must in order to\nvalidate myself good so that's the\nDharma for anyone who's curious you guys\njust heard it okay um and but let's kind\nof go back to so so we kind of so you\nhave a tendency to kind of abstract and\nexplain things to me yes like I analyze\nyeah very much so\nright and and I think the challenge here\nis gonna be that you have you don't\nactually give me data you give me\nconclusions okay so that that's sort of\na double-edged sword because when I ask\nyou a little bit about where does this\ncome from you already have the perfect\nstory you're like oh it's this story and\nyou also youselves a very interesting\nthing when you related the story about\nthe coffee cup this is the story that my\nfamily talks about yeah okay right so it\nsounds like this has been well discussed\nmauled over chewed yeah so the challenge\nhere is gonna be that we have to get to\nthe questions that you haven't asked\nyourself yet okay that go function once\nagain is this one which is what does\nthat say about her son so you were\ntalking about your mom as someone who's\nincapable of saying I love you who has\nnever had so so many like analytics\nabout me I feel unloved right I was\nalways seeking it's the same thing at\nwork I'm seeking positive feedback and I\nhave an endless desire an unmet desire\nfor it like I'm a I'm a black hole of\nwanting more positive feedback that's\nhow it says yes you're so good at\nsterilizing how you feel you're a black\nhole for wanting positive feedback like\nI didn't know black like what are you a\nblack hole for even feeling loved III\nwant oh yeah I'm glad you can say it you\nsee how your mind did that yeah I'm not\nexactly sure what you're driving at\nabout sterilizing but I get the point\nthat I I step away from\nthe person using the words of deep\npersonal emotions yes\nright which is back to your dissociative\ncapability okay right so like you step\naway and that's also the how you feeling\nyou feeling okay\nyeah I'm fine okay yeah I know I mean I\nfeel a little bit of anxiety but nothing\nthat's distressing me has that changed\nrecently in this talk yeah\nis that anxiety you felt at the\nbeginning or is it changing there's a\nlittle there's a little bit of anxiety\nabout addressing feeling deep personal\nemotions and talking about them yeah\nbecause it's vulnerability its\nvulnerability to talk to you and to\nanyone about deeply personal not to\nanyone I but is it that also I think is\na great intellectual analysis of\nyourself so close your eyes for a second\nokay tell me what you feel what is that\nanxiety what is Vault because it's not\nanxiety its vulnerability okay right\nthat's what you feel okay and tell you\nwhat about it what does it feel like\nphysically it's in the pit of my stomach\nthere's a tightness there's a there's a\nthere's a tightness in my stomach about\nthat comes from feeling exposed alright\neyes closed yeah and feeling exposed\ngood yeah right so you don't want to\nfeel exposed there's a part of you so\nthat tightness in your stomach is kind\nof fear yeah it's fear how long how\nfamiliar is that sensation in your\nstomach before yes do you remember the\nfirst time that or an early time that\nyou felt it I certainly remember the\nfirst time I can consciously remember\nfeeling afraid\nI don't know if I felt a pit in my\nstomach does those were fear of physical\nthings okay so do you remember feeling\nthis sensation in particular before yeah\nI think even early as time would be when\nI was five okay we're talking about this\nsensation right yeah tell me about when\nyou were five what happened um when I\nwas five it's a dramatic memory I've\nkept all this time I first got an\nunderstanding of the concept of death\nand I became afraid of what it meant for\nthe world to go on without me I had this\nI had this sense of like oh one day I\nwill end and the world will continue and\nthat was a fearful of realization for me\nso that's the first thing I can think of\nwhere I'm like Oh what did you do with\nthat feeling\ntalk to someone about it I went and\ntalked to my dad about it and What did\nhe say\nso I asked my dad what happens when we\ndie and he gave me a scientific answer\nhe said oh well first your heart stops\nthen your brain stops and I interrupted\nhim I said no no dad what happens to me\nand he said well some people believe\nthere's a heaven\nI believe you're just gone\ngruffly do you remember how you felt\nwhen he said that uh I don't remember\nclearly I remember you time after like I\ncan't tell you what I felt at that\ninstant sure of course what I what I\nfelt in gears that followed was wow\nthat's horrible that's not a feeling\nthat's a thought that's okay I continue\nto feel afraid right I'm I I continue to\nfeel afraid of non-existence of losing\nthat sense of myself and that drove yeah\nwell that's going into what happened\nafter but I felt worried about that\nconcern and in fact that was an origin\nof my disassociative ability because\nthat thought was scary enough for me\nthat I learned to put it aside and say\nokay I've thought about that enough for\nthe moment or I felt it enough it's\nbecoming uncomfortable I'm going to\npackage that aside and come back to it\nwhen I'm ready for more so I got very\ngood at turning that feeling off yeah\nright so and and you're doing it you're\ndoing a great job I'm tying everything\ntogether if I don't have to tie together\nanything for you you're doing it all by\nyourself\nall right so I think we have two\nchallenges Ethan one is that so you're\ntying I mean beautiful like I should\njust jot this down and fuss about it in\npeer supervision because it's all laid\nout right so yeah our experience when\nyou were five you felt I mean so I think\nthere's there's there's a staggering\namount of being left hanging by your dad\nyeah of being like alone in the wind it\nwasn't a supportive answer for sure yeah\nyeah did did nothing to make me feel\nbetter made me feel worse like cuz he\nwas my idol right he's my father I'm a\nyoung kid a boy and here he is like I'm\nlike dad what happens when we die and\nhe's like well you cease to exist in\nyour body brats\nwhat are you feeling now now we're\ngetting somewhere now you're feeling now\nthe armor is coming down what is that\nwhat are you feeling when you talk about\nyour dad when you tell that story you be\nI feel let down\nI feel abandoned right I feel vulnerable\nagain as I did war\nI see anger oh yeah oh yeah fair yeah\nyeah I know yes I agree with that I I\nlike I'm gonna over intellectualize bear\nwith me a second I feel like my parents\ndid the best they knew how and they gave\nme a financially secure home with a big\ndrive for education but emotionally they\ndid a fairly [ __ ] job how do you feel\nabout that uh I feel like it left me\nwith that lifetime of work to try and\nput it back together that I've discussed\nand so and I have kids myself so I feel\nmotivated not to inflict that on them\nright to be a different person\nEthan if someone treated your kids the\nway that your parents treated you how\nwould you Ronald that I'd throttle them\nI the rage with I guess I would enter\nthat would be like Papa Bear is coming\nto clear the room yeah and how do you\nfeel that no one did that for you yeah\none was there yeah your parents treated\nyou the way that they did and there was\nno papa bear that's right\nyeah I feel that brings on more sadness\nI feel more less anger than more just\nGod that sucks and so I don't want that\nfor anyone else so I think we've got to\ntwo challenges with you okay okay only\ntwo\nI'm doing well yeah so one is like what\nall these feelings are and I think you\ndo a very good job of divorcing yourself\nfrom some of your feelings right because\nlike I don't like I can point and I\nthink it's clear to me that you've done\na lot of reflection I think you've come\na very long way because just that what\nyou're saying is like your gift you're\nnot giving me a rough draft you're\ngiving me like something for something\nvery close to a final product there's a\nlot of the people that I talk to they're\ngiving me like really rough drafts and\nour goal is to get to where you are 15\nminutes into the interview okay so and\nI'll just say like an example of this is\nthat you're not able to notice the anger\nright away but if I point it out to you\nyou're like yeah it's there and we can\nget closer to it if I ask certain\nquestions that actually do the\ndepersonalization for you so if I ask\nyou how you feel what kind of answer do\nI get uh you get a feeling nope nope\ngood again okay when you ask me how I\nfeel you get a story and a picture of\nwhat I've learned sure yeah what you've\nlearned that's the operative thing right\nI get an intellectual answer yeah okay\nand then like they're there moments\nwhere you have your feelings and those\nmoments are actually when you step\noutside of yourself and you look at the\nsituation so when you imagine how your\ndad like it's almost like you're being\nPapa Bear for yourself when you talk\nabout like that anger that I get from\nyou that visceral anger is like when\nyou're recalling how your dad treated a\nfive-year-old that's what gets the Papa\nBear anger out okay and that Papa Bear\nanger is there yeah\nright but when you just view it from\nyourself you're it's like hard for you\nto embrace that Papa Bear anger I don't\nthink you are letting yourself feel that\nand then if I ask you about the kitten\nare you getting emotional now no no not\nat all I'm laughing I'm laugh\nmyself because you're right and I you\nknow yeah so so if I ask you about your\nkids then the Papa Bear anger is like\nthat's what you feel for yourself right\nand then you also make these kind of\ninteresting statements which I think\nyou've done a lot of processing on right\nlike you kind of say oh my parents\ndidn't do good enough right which is\nsort of an analytical statement but at\nthe same time like that's such a watered\ndown diet version whether your life was\nright like so yeah they didn't do good\nenough but like think about what it was\nactually like for you to grow up in that\nhousehold okay yeah you're right I'm I'm\nreticent to whine on stream I guess yeah\nmy my childhood I could tell again no\nphysical abuse really but I could tell\nbad household stories yeah yeah so I\ngrew up in a you know in a verbal II and\nintellectually abusive environment yes\nand hurt and I yeah good so and I think\nonce again like even that like the\nsubtle thing there is you say I don't\nwant to whine on stream where no one's\nwhining I lurve four thousand eight\nhundred and nineteen people watching on\nmy end I don't think a single one of\nthem thinks you're whining okay that\nwhining is your self judgment and your\ndistancing of the way that you feel okay\nthat's why you use the word one cuz\nyou're like [ __ ] Ethan like why are\nyou whining about this [ __ ] right okay\nthat's like what your dad or mom told\nyou the whole time like I don't care\nabout your feelings like why do you feel\nthat way like Ethan that's unproductive\nokay fair yes so there are two things\nhere one is like you know what the\nsource and you've done it just once\nagain masterful job like you know when\nwe talk about the void like the void of\nI forgot what how you black hole black\nhole of hunger in for positive reading\nor for love hunger for positive yeah\nthere's that kind of stuff right which\nis like generally speaking when we talk\nabout feelings like that's the Epiphany\nthat we want people to have right they\nsay oh I have a black hole in my heart\nfor a lot\nthat's what people tune in for from a\nvoyeuristic aspect I don't know I don't\nknow that that I mean I think that can\nbe significant for you but I think what\nis far more significant for you is not\nto try to do the things that other\npeople here do on soon because you're\nnot them like most of the people that I\ninterview in there earn their 20s right\nI haven't they just haven't gotten there\n/ played when it comes to life is just\nway smaller than yours right and you\nhave lived a life of reflection\nintrospection and dedication to\nself-improvement which is remarkable and\nso I think the thing that we need to\nteach you more than anything else is\nlike show you how you step away from\njust huge parts of yourself okay\nthe goal here for you is no long is not\nlike revelation it's integration because\nI think you already know you just choose\nnot to like let that be a part of you\nokay I have you know I would think that\nsomeone in your shoes would feel angry\nwith their parents like you have every\nright to be angry with your parents I\nguess I but you're not angry with your\nparents because what you do you're so\n[ __ ] understanding that you when I\nasked you about your parents you say she\ndidn't grow up in a household of love so\nyou give them excuses for their behavior\njust help is helpful it allows you to\nforgive but also should not be done to\nthe exclusion of your feelings okay both\nof those have to be there right you have\nto understand ago I disassociated I'm\nlike well yeah I got it I give them a\npass and so then being angry with them\nhas no point because being angry with\nsomeone who didn't I make excuses for\nthem I got absolutely yeah right so\nyou're doing fantastic so now it comes\nto back to your job and our stress yeah\nand when you walk into that boardroom\nyeah and I think the reason that those\nfeelings because it's kind of weird\nright you're able to handle so many\ndifferent things you're able to grow in\nspite of so many different challenges\nyou're able to achieve so why is it that\nyou know armor wearing shell owning\ndissociative Ethan has trouble when he\nwalks into that room\nbecause you're the one who says if\nsomeone's yelling in your face you can\nhandle that why is it so hard for you to\ndo this thing and put on your armor at\nthat point because there's a part of me\nthat says well maybe it goes a little\nbit well what is hard I'm afraid maybe\nthey're right\nI'm afraid maybe the attack is right\nmaybe oh boy if you go all the way back\nto it I guess you and there's a part of\nme that feels like well maybe I earned\nor or maybe my parents didn't do wrong I\nI was the problem right so there's a\nthere's a confidence problem or a\nself-value again those are intellectual\nwords the fear that the root fear is\nmaybe they're right maybe I'm not worthy\nmaybe it's it's all of that and so it's\nfear that you're not good enough that I\nam not good enough\nand and where did you learn that home\nabsolutely right so now we understand\nthat like I think so part of the problem\nhere is that you dissociate parts of\nyourself\nbut those dissociated parts don't go\naway they just lie dormant right and\nthere are some situations that cause the\nvolcano to erupt because all that\nmagnets down there yes and so the\nsolution to you no longer feeling that\nway is to like you know like drain the\nabscess do you know what an abscess is\nyeah I do and I can hear my wife\nlaughing downstairs cuz we talked about\nthe volcano inside me and she just she\njust the stream just caught up to those\nwords and and she was busted out okay\ncuz it's real yeah so so yeah I can have\na dramatic rage outbursts yeah they're\nthey're very rare and tightly controlled\nbut that's like the button-up armor\nand if that gets out you know I'm a\nbooth the gaming term I go berserk I'm a\nbeserker and I like when I tip over it's\nall that's what happens right like with\nthe dissociation with the armor there\nall of the feelings that you understand\nand are okay with and then there's all\nthe stuff that doesn't help you\nthat cannot be intellectualized the\nstuff that's a little bit irrational and\nall that stuff goes beneath the surface\nand that stuff sometimes gets a vocht\nwhen you walk into a particular room at\nwork it hits too close to home so\nthere's some there are some avenues\nthere are some tunnels to like the magma\nat the center of the earth that evoke\nthat more often and if you're wanting to\nstop feeling that way like sure you can\ngo to thing I mean you can go to therapy\nand maybe you should I mean I don't know\nif you've seen people in the past or\nyeah you can talk about the absence of\nlove in your life in the black hole of\nlove and that's such beautiful juicy\nlike some juicy therapy imagery it's\nlike oh my god it just gets therap is so\nexcited when we yeah this is what we got\ninto it for but I think oddly enough\nethan i think your path is actually more\nnot so much the path of therapy although\nthat can be helpful but it's the path of\nmeditation is that a path of yoga is the\npath of understanding how your mind\nfunctions and then once you understand\nhow your mind functions changing a\ncouple of levers so it stops doing the\nthings that it's doing right now and the\nsimplest of that is to stop dissociating\nand start integrating to understand that\njust because you're a level-headed guy\ndoesn't mean like it's weird because\nyou're a level-headed guy in you're a\nberserker like you got a that's got a\nmeet somewhere in the middle for you to\nbe integrated like that's the goal yeah\nyes there was a period earlier in my\nlife where I sought perfection and\nabsolutely said your point about\ndisassociation people would say to me\nyou're only well you're only human and\nI'd say yeah that's a flaw\nyeah but then then yeah there's a lot\nother stuff too like these patterns that\nyou have about yourself and where you\nlearned that right well I was trying to\nbe unemotional\nin other words because done you've done\na very good job because knowing that the\nemotion is volcanic and uncontrolled the\nfirst path is well just don't be that\nyeah because because there's no scuzz\nit's careless to be emotional yeah it's\nthe definition of carelessness\nuncontrolled no coffee on the saucer\nEthan not allowed no no coffee on the\nsaucer so but I am very interested I\nwould like to be more integrated right I\nstrive to be a whole person I want that\nand not to just intellectualize I not\nonly strive to be it I actually want it\nI want to be at peace with myself yacht\nin two pieces\nyeah so beautifully set beautifully set\nright and and that's that I don't know\nif you read that something like you know\nthat's somewhere no that's like that's\nthat's great nice that's like you know\nLama level don't be in be with what do\nyou I don't even remember what you said\nbut we can we can clip that that was\nprofound you said something you said\nsomething by saying I strive to be\nintegrated I want to be a whole person\nnot live in two pieces yeah yeah yeah it\nwas great right and I think it's yeah so\nwe're gonna start do you meditate I have\na little bit not regularly okay I really\nI read what is it Dan Harris and 10%\nhappier you must know this book yeah\nyeah so we're gonna teach you one form\nof meditation today okay I don't mm I\nthink you should just start here\nalthough I don't think this is the right\nend game practice for you this is like\nthe preparatory practice okay the other\nthing just in general that I think you\nneed to be doing is feeling more what\nemotion do you think you need to feel\nmore of what do you think what right so\nemotions are mad sad glad etc what\nemotion do I need to feel more of\nwhat do you need to let yourself feel\nwhat's the anger absolutely good I'm\nglad you got him right now my wife's not\ngonna laugh so so it doesn't mean be\nangry it means feel feel it okay because\nhere's the thing when you walk into the\nboardroom and you're your performance is\nnot as good is it supposed to be we've\nbeen talking about humiliation is how I\nfeel right but there's another thing\nthere when you walk in there and your\nboss is saying hey Ethan you didn't do X\nwhy is he like what's the other thing\nthat you feel pissed off that they're\nobserving the obvious and not helping\nyes right there's anger there there's\ntotal anger anger it's bizarre because\nfor most people anger covers up the\nshame anger is a protective mechanism\nyou're so spiritually advanced that it's\ngotten like reverse where do you feel\nthe inadequacy you see yourself and then\nlike you just don't let yourself feel\nanger because I'm because the behavior\nthat follows really feeling angry is\nconfrontational so that's where you have\nto learn that's your barrier of growth\nright so just like like shame does not\nlead to tears does it even know you can\ncontrol that yeah so the separation\nbetween behaviors and feelings is there\nfor you in all emotions except for one\nanger that's completely true and that's\nwhy that's the one you need to feel okay\nthat's the great barrier of your growth\nright so to feel angry to let yourself\nfeel angry because it's not it's not\nabout a lack of love it's not about any\nof that juicy juicy Freudian\npsychological goodness not being loved\nby your mother and not being loved by\nyour father\nit's about anger okay it's about being\npissed at the injustice of the world and\nthat's what you're angry at is the\ninjustice of it yeah okay that it's not\nwith their that your parents treated you\nthe way that they did and they shouldn't\nhave and it's not [ __ ] fair and you\nunderstand that very well as soon as I\nput your kids into their shoes no but\nyou don't let yourself feel that way\nabout\nyourself yeah it seems disrespectful I\nguess sure there are all kinds of good\nreasons to not feel it up right there\nthere are good reasons why an\nintellectual introspective reflective\nand experienced person like yourself has\nconcluded to not feel those feelings and\nyou've got to feel okay okay so just\nnotice it throughout the week and then\nfrom a very sort of like psycho physics\nkind of perspective in my experience the\nmore that you experience those emotions\nthroughout the week and acknowledge them\nwhen you have the opportunity to the\nlast blow ups you're gonna have okay\nthat's good and also the less cuz the\nproblem here is that right now the\nreason that anger is so tied to behavior\nis because the only time that anger you\nlike it rise lay there's a dam and\nangers like rising on the other side and\nthen it floods over right and so no\nwonder it's in controllable because it's\nlike the only time you see you get wet\nis when it's flooded yes so that's got\nto change right so you've got to start\nirrigating a little bit letting it out a\nlittle bit acknowledging a little bit on\na day-to-day basis I'm imagining\nyou're you're like colorblind for anger\nin your day-to-day life people probably\ncall you for the most part a pretty\nlevel-headed calm collected guy right\nyeah usually yes yes with exceptions if\nthey've ever seen the damn bridge yeah\nexactly so the way to get the dam from\nbreaking is to actually let the water\nout from time to time that you have to\nprocess your emotions as they arise that\nacknowledge that you're feeling them\nokay and so look for what the feeling of\nanger is in your body and so notice like\nyour physical sensations kind of like we\ndid with the pit in the stomach that's\nnot anger that's something else yeah and\nand just notice your anger and I'd say\nthat's the first step forward for you\nokay and then I can teach you meditation\ndo you have any questions for me no I'm\nsuper I mean I have a ton about how to\nintegrate the personality but I\nI want to know more I don't think I\nunderstand how to form a good question\nother than to say yes I'm eager to learn\nabout that and to be able because I\ndon't like having the the disassociated\nshell right I don't like and I try like\nI try to share honestly who I am but\nsome parts of me are hard to let out\nabsolutely because that too is that's\nadaptive like I think use fantastic work\nso that was necessary for you to survive\nand and now it's starting to you know\nlike most adaptations they're they're\nadaptive in one area and then like\nmaladaptive maladaptive yeah that makes\nperfect sense yeah so I think at this\nstage in your life you know you've\nmanaged a lot of different emotions\nyou've dealt with inadequacy and shame\nand things like that but oddly enough I\nthink the you know the way for it is to\nfeel a little bit more anger and I'm\ngonna teach you this I'll teach you a\nvery simple meditation practice that if\nyou do on a day-to-day basis will I\nthink help you a little bit with\nmanaging your emotions as well\nokay so sit up straight sit up straight\ngot it and then I can you do this and I\ndo yep good so with your right hand I\nwant you to block your right right\nnostril and breathe in through your left\njust breathe in and then switch and then\nbreathe out breathe in through the same\nnostril switch breathe out in through\nthe same switch breathe out in switch\nout in\nswitch out go ahead and close your eyes\ncontinue at your own pace remember that\nyou inhale with the same nostril that\nyou exhale and that you switch on a full\nbreath\neverybody's watching at home should do\nthis too\ngo ahead and do two more breaths and let\nyour eyes remain closed let your hands\nrelax\nyou\nnotice the natural slowing of your\nbreath and just sit with the person that\nyou are\nnow put your palms together in front of\nyou touching rub them together feel the\nheat the friction and then cut them over\nyour eyes slowly open your eyes as you\nexhale let your hands come down okay\nfeeling that's good that's very relaxing\nyou look different\nwell I think I bet that's true how do\nyou do - for the record yeah yeah works\non me - thoughts questions before we\nwrap out for the day\nuh no I'm eager to follow up in a week\nlike okay to try it some and and the\nintegration questions to have questions\ndon't even don't judge yourself for not\nhaving questions just now I was just\nchecking I was checking with myself like\ndo I have a well formed question or some\nheaven okay I know I wasn't I was I\njudge myself plenty maybe but I was not\nin that case good sorry for jumping to\nconclusions no no it's actually when you\nasked me to sit with myself I generally\nlike myself like that was not unpleasant\nsitting with the person I am\nwas not a big running list of ways I\nneed to be different it was okay I'm I'm\nfine how I am maybe I can also be better\nbut I'm fine how I am yes right yes so\nthat is you cultivate that sensation\nmore and more in meditation walking into\nthat room when your your product isn't\nperforming is gonna get easier and\neasier okay that makes good that makes\ncomplete sense because you're what\nyou've said in other words is you're no\nlonger attached to the result right\nyou're not attached to what's going on\nin the room from a self valuation view\nprocess you are just what you are right\nthat is the way that you actually exist\nin this world and keep going on this\npath and you'll even discover what\nhappens to you after death oh really all\nright that's what they say\nthat's what it well eventually I'll\ndiscover one way or the other one way or\nthe other\nokay take care of it all right thank you\nso much have a nice day bye well next\nweek same time yeah next week same time\nI'll see you there bye okay so okay\nwe're gonna go to so regarding beating\nyourself up for carelessness can you\nexplain what a healthy and productive\nversion of scolding yourself would look\nlike I will temporarily beat myself up\nfor stupid mistakes but move on quickly\nso there's a difference between\nreflecting and understanding that you\nmade a mistake and beating yourself up\nthose are like completely different\nthings right so you can do nothing wrong\nand beat yourself up you can do a lot\nwrong and not beat yourself up you can\ndo something wrong and beat yourself up\nor you can do something wrong and not\nbeat yourself up right there's a\ntwo-by-two table and just think about\nthis for a second completely independent\nfunctions of the mind so if I like you\nknow\nwell let's say that I was I mean I use\nsome examples over and over again but\nwell I think infidelity is a good one so\nif I'm unfaithful there are lots of ways\nthat I can do mental gymnastics and\nconvince myself that even though I did\nsomething wrong objectively I won't beat\nmyself up for it I'll justify it I'll\ngive myself excuses right so you can do\nsomething wrong and not beat yourself up\nthen there's like people who are highly\nneurotic because like they don't\nactually do something wrong like though\nthough walk down the street and they I\nopened a door and I walked through the\ndoor and I let go of the door and I\ndidn't realize someone was behind me and\nthat person put their hand on the door\nkind of at the last second and opened it\nand then walked out and I didn't hold\nthe door open for them and I'm like\nbeating myself up because oh my god that\nperson must think I'm a complete [ __ ]\nand and things like that so even though\nobjectively you may not have really done\nmuch like you just walked through the\ndoor you're not responsible necessarily\nfor holding it like sure it's nice if\nyou hold it but you can still beat\nyourself up over it right that's kind of\nlike social anxiety or you know\nstealing's of inadequacy so you can have\na cognitive bias where even though\nyou're not doing anything wrong that\nthat you're you know you're still sort\nof beating yourself up and then you can\ndo something wrong and you can beat\nyourself up over it or you can do\nsomething wrong and then you cannot beat\nyourself up over it so case in point of\nthe last one at the beginning of the\nstream if you guys were around you saw\nthe train wreck of the century in terms\nof or not I mean onthe century but\nprobably the stupidest thing that I've\never done on stream and I completely\nacknowledge it was a terrible thing to\ndo and boy was that a mistake\nlike there is no question that what I\ndid was a terrible idea\nand it's like did I beat myself up for\nit no I'm not gonna do it again I'm\ngonna learn from it I'm gonna learn\nabout how to do things better but I'm\nnot gonna beat myself up over it because\nI acknowledge that I'm a boomer and as\nwe've talked about before boomer is my\narmor right boomer is my excuse I'm a\nboomer and I don't know how these I\ndon't know how the internet works uh\ndiscord uh right and and then you know\nlike that's just I'm like there's this\ngonna be like growing pains right\nthere's gonna be growing pains like I'm\ngonna make mistakes on stream like this\nis new to me like you know trying to\nsave the internet through AoE healing is\ngonna like have a learning curve folks\nso that's gonna happen from time to time\nso question is how do you so yeah I\nthink what is like reflective and one is\nlike a sense of beating yourself up\nwhich has to do with like ego and sense\nof self like do you just acknowledge so\nyou have to acknowledge that there's a\ndifference between incompetence and\ninexperience this is where I think a lot\nof people get tripped up so the question\nis like are you incompetent which is how\na lot of times how you feel about\nyourself like you feel like oh I'm dumb\nor like I'm socially bad right I'm\nsocially incompetent whereas if you\nreally stop and look at it like if you\nspend ten hours a day playing video\ngames your social function isn't gonna\nbe good but that's not because you're\nlike socially like defunct in some way\nit's because you're inexperienced\nbecause you spend most of your time\nbehind a computer screen it's like you\nwouldn't blame like a first year medical\nstudent for not doing a good job in\nsurgery because they're just new to this\nand if you spend most of your time\nbehind a computer screen like why would\nyou think that you're good with people\nright so try to be a little bit\ncompassionate towards yourself try to\nunderstand that there's a difference\nbetween like you socking it life and you\nbeing inexperienced at life and if you\nguys saw like this interview is\ndifferent from any of the others and why\nis that it's because Ethan has like more\nXP he's like higher level he's\ndoing this a while his slash played is\nlike way higher than your slash blade so\nthe way that he manages his emotions in\nthe way that he understands himself is\ngonna be different right yeah so just so\nsomeone's saying we're news yes so let's\nremember somewhere along the way newb\nchanged its meaning\nremember noob has its origins I know\nthis because I'm a boomer and I was\nthere in the days when new book was born\nI remember right so noob is a newbie\nsomeone who's new someone who's\ninexperienced but now what noob means no\nnoob no longer means inexperienced new\nmeans new means you suck like not\ninexperienced you suck so what you guys\nhave to do is remember there's a\ndifference between incompetent\ninexperienced and are you allowed to\nmake mistakes given the situation and\nchances are the answer is almost always\nyes that like even in social situations\neven in marriage and relationships like\nyou can have fights with your\nsignificant other and you can have\nchallenges in your marriage and that\ndoesn't mean that like even though you\nget better at marriage you continue\nhaving challenges like that's how it\nworks\nlife continues throwing new things at\nyou which is how life is so you're gonna\ncontinually make mistakes so don't worry\nabout it man relax a little bit have\nsome fun laugh at it okay can shaming\never be productive and healthy for\nself-improvement okay so this is a great\nquestion okay can shaming ever be\nproductive and healthy for\nself-improvement okay so the the tricky\nthing here is the statement itself okay\nso I'm gonna do this again or hopefully\nthis works okay I don't know if you guys\nactually like this or not but I think\nthis is too good to pass up\nokay alright let's look at the sentence\ncan Oh God\ncan shaming ever be productive and\nhealthy for self-improvement so now\nwe're gonna do something I have faith in\nyou chat so you guys tell me what do you\nthink the answer to this is okay so ah I\nsee some people are getting it okay so\nwhat do you guys think about this right\ncan shaming ever be productive for\nself-improvement and then what do you\nguys think about this\n[Music]\nright there you have it well done twitch\nchat beautiful answer the question so\nnow we get to like a couple of things so\na lot of times when we are asking\nourselves questions and we have\nconceptions of the world we tie things\ntogether like I this is gonna sound kind\nof weird and abstract but a lot of your\ngrowth is gonna come when you take the\nthings that your mind automatically\nspits out so this is important to\nunderstand this person just spat out\nthat sentence right so something in\ntheir mind they think that like okay\nproductive because they acknowledge that\nshaming can be productive but they know\nthat it's you're not supposed to do that\nso they're like confused about like how\ndo you move forward right so like\nseparate out what is going in on in your\nmind and like actually look at it\nactually look at your thoughts and\nyou'll be amazed at what you can\ndiscover when you apply your analytical\npower which is what gamers are really\ngood at so I could give you like this is\na person this is a question that someone\nasked me because I'm an expert right I'm\nsuper smart Harvard and II hear yoga and\nE meditation and E seven years in India\nso you become a monk and E all of the\nAndes and you can come to the answer\njust that easily you can do it you could\ndo it all you have to do is analyze it\ny'all are brilliant you just have to\nknow how to analyze it you just have to\ngive yourself the chance to reflect upon\nyour thoughts right you have to like\nthis is important it's hard to study\neverything in your mind so put it out on\nsomething and then leverage your full\nanalytical capability on it you will be\namazed at what you're able to accomplish\nwhat you will understand about yourself\nso can shaming ever be productive and\nhealthy for self-improvement\nboth of those things I don't think so\nI think shame can definitely drive\nproductivity for self-improvement for\nsure right that absolutely is it gonna\nbe healthy for self-improvement I don't\nthink so so shame can be like sort of\nhealthy in the sense that shame is a\nregular part of life and we should\nexperience it but if you're using shame\nto fuel self-improvement I don't think\nthat's usually healthy right maybe but\ngenerally speaking no so I think the rub\nis that how can you find\nself-improvement\nhow can you motivate yourself towards\nself-improvement without a negative\nemotion driving it which kind of goes\nback to the thing about anger okay\nregarding a sense of inadequacy fueling\npersonal growth what does a relentless\npursuit of personal growth look like\nwhen it's fueled in a healthy way\ninstead of fueled by an adequacy okay\nokay this is good fun all right we're\ngonna do this again okay you guys ready\nthis one's harder okay so you guys have\nto give yourself some slack you can't do\nit but okay okay\nregarding sense of inadequacy fueling\npersonal growth what does relentless\npursuit for purse rope look like when\nit's fueled in a healthy way\nokay so twitch chat now this is gonna be\nhard okay maybe cuz it's gonna be a\nlittle bit read my mind I'm gonna tell\nyou guys that for\nhealthy personal growth there is one\nword in this question which is wrong\nthat's just leet speak there we go okay\nso fueled is misspelled but twitch at\nfigured it out look at that that's it\nbeautiful beautiful you guys see that\nlike you see how [ __ ] there we go like\nlike this person you can see this\nperson's psychology in terms of this you\ndid it you did it you did it you fix it\nthat's healthy ready\nunhealthy healthy unhealthy healthy\nunhealthy healthy good job good job dude\ngood job Twitter chat I wish I could\ndonate to twitch at I'd like sub and sub\nthe twitch chat was streaming I would\nsub right there well done team but you\nguys see that\nso inadequacy is about like the the\nrelentless pursuit like why do you need\nto be relentless if you're adequate but\nyou don't need to be relentless if\nyou're adequate like you're fine you\ndon't need to do anything just chill man\nand like grow and improve when you feel\nlike it and when life demands it of you\nand like that's it\nso it's the relentlessness that's the\nproblem because relentless oh serious up\nthanks for gifting\num relentlessness is like that's that's\nfrom inadequacy right because you're\nnever good enough so you have to be\nrelentless the relentless pursuit so\nanytime people are like relentlessly\npursuing self growth like I'm like dude\nwhy do you need to grow like what's\nwrong with you that you need to grow why\ncan't you just be good enough the way\nyou are that's healthy and then you can\ngrow like when you know there are times\nthat I mean I generally have a pretty\ngood opinion of myself and there are\ntimes that like I need to learn and grow\nlike hey dr. K don't just chop a hop-on\ndiscord when you're live on stream and\nlet the internet just say whatever it\nwants to because that's just it's just\ntoo good to pass up for some of those\npeople out there it's just too good\nyou just can't they just can't pass it\nup right and come on can we really like\nis that my mistake or is that their\nmistake like let's be honest that's\nprobably on me because you know it's\njust too good to pass up okay what do I\nthink about Ethan's level of\nself-consciousness so in I think Ethan I\ndon't know what you mean by\nself-consciousness but I mean I think\nEthan is highly self-aware of all of the\nparts that he's self-aware of and that\nhe's unaware of something relatively\nlarge in his psychology which is usually\nhow it works so Carl Jung talked about\nsomething called the shadow which is\nlike the part of our mind that we sort\nof don't acknowledge and he also said\nthat most of the growth comes from\nexploring our shadows which sort of\nmakes sense because if you were aware of\nit you would have like worked on it and\nreflected and fixed it anyway so the\nrole of like an analyst a psychoanalyst\nis to like help people explore their\nshadows because that's the part that\nthey don't understand and I think that\nsort of makes sense but it's not like\nany sort of drastic you know deep\npsychological concept or the shadow it's\njust like if your house you know if you\nhave a leaky faucet you're not gonna fix\nit unless you know it's leaking so the\nthings that you're unaware of\nor where your kind of barrier of growth\nis or where your opportunity of growth\nis I think overall he's like quite\nreflective and you guys could see that\nlike most of the correlations that I\ndraw for people on stream he was saying\non his own right and sometimes he had to\nbe pushed and prodded like he said I\nhave a black hole of relentless\nsomething he's some lack of positive\nreinforcement or something he said\nsomething weird some weird you know\ncorporate speak about love and he's like\nI'm like what is that and he's like oh\nit's love so he's like pretty good at at\npushing the envelope but then there are\nsome areas where he has trouble right\nbecause we have to kind of get to him in\ndifferent ways we can't ask him about\nhimself because if we ask him hey Ethan\nwhat's going on in your head he's gonna\ngive us an answer that's gonna be like\nall correct and like no flavor it's\ngonna be like intellectually brilliant\nand no I don't know if you guys saw but\nlike what there was a couple of times\nduring the interview where like he could\nbecame animated and that's what we're\nlooking for that's what he's missing\nokay when it comes to the Harma and some\nscar is there a day when something just\nclicks or is it something you notice\nover time slowly and only realize it's\ngetting better after reflecting on it\nokay we want to try discord again your\nmods have have set up a veteran system\nyeah okay so we're gonna answer both of\nthose questions at the same time but I'm\ngonna get to this last question real\nquick okay and then we're gonna move to\ndisco we're gonna try this again so\n[Music]\nhow do I get rid of my sense of\ninadequacy you have to figure out where\nit comes from right so where did you\nlearn that you were inadequate the\nsecond thing that you can do is meditate\nbecause when you meditate I don't know\nif you guys saw this but you know when\nyou meditate you don't feel inadequate\nanymore right like you just feel like\nyourself feel like you're just you\nthere's no inadequacy there's no\ninadequacy you're just you you're just\nlike neutral adequacy and inadequacy\ndon't really apply like that's just not\na thing and so that's what happens when\nyou meditate a lot so like even though I\nmade a catastrophic mistake at the\nbeginning of stream like what buffers me\nagainst that is just like that\nmeditative sense they're just like oh\nthat's just something that happens in\nlife sometimes you get on stream and you\nyou know shoot yourself in the foot and\nother times you get on stream and\nthey're like 15,000 people watching just\nwhat it is like you just sit there and\nyou just be yourself and let the rest of\nthe world like revolve around you\nhowever the [ __ ] it wants to that's fine\nno big deal okay okay we're gonna try\ndiscord again okay okay"
