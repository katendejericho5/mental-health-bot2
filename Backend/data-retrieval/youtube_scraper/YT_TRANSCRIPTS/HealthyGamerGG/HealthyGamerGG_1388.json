    "transcript": "so what do i what do I call you buddy um\nthe full name is mismo spooling it\nderives from cause and racing and stuff\nlike that okay a lot of people call me\nnezzie mismo Nez or you can call me my\nreal name which is Neil what do you what\ndo you want me to call you um when is\nthis alright miss okay this is so nice\nthank you very much for coming on stream\ntoday man very welcome and yeah our\npleasure so can can you help me and\ntwitch at understand a little bit about\nwhy you're coming on today how we can be\nhelpful and what we're talking about\nyeah absolutely\nwell originally I decided to reach out\nto you because I was having a lot of\ntrouble with motivation okay and I'd\nactually recently overcome that pretty\ngood on my own and I've been kind of\nmoving forward and awesome in doing my\nthing with that and it comes and goes\nlike yeah I know there's a there's a big\nproblem with depression and anxiety in\nin a lot of not just gamers Internet\nusers in general right yeah and I've\nnever really subscribed to the notion\nthat I think that I have you know any\nkind of clinical depression or anxiety\nor anything like that I see myself as a\npretty happy guy okay I'm happy I'm a\nhappy dude I'm not really anxious about\nmany things but you know we all get sad\nwe all have bad days bad things happen\nit's natural to be sad about stuff but\nso\nwalking on my own motivation and things\nlike that recently I've shifted to\nsomething that I consider to be more\nimportant to me and something that I've\nbeen trying to figure out for most of my\nlife which is\nI've always been able to pick things up\nand be quite good at them off the rip\nand then I don't know what causes this I\ndon't know if I get comfortable at a\ncertain spot but I don't ever get much\nbetter than what I originally start with\nyep so I can always be good but I've\nnever been able to be what I would\nconsider great or someone that you know\nexceeds expectations I guess I don't\nknow yeah but you either wear that\ncorrectly okay so what I want to do here\nfor a second okay so I'm just gonna take\na couple of notes about talking points\nokay so and can you tell us so I think\nthat's a that's a great a couple of\nreally great things to talk about it you\nknow a lot of people are surprised to\ndiscover this but I think I fall in the\nsame camp as you in terms of I tend to\nhit my peak performance relatively\neasily and then top out pretty quickly\nand so I think that there's actually\nthere's in our perceptions of success\ntend to be skewed towards a certain kind\nof person and we think about success is\nsomething that's like built day after\nday after day in terms of like you put a\nbreak and then you put the next brick\nand you put the next brick whereas I\nthink that for some people the structure\nand model of success should be viewed as\na little bit different so we can talk\nabout that but I think based on your bio\nI thought you had a really interesting\nstory and stuff that you were sharing\ncan you tell us a little bit about what\nyou've been up to and kind of how you\ngot to where you are yeah gaming in\ngeneral because like I set up and I've\ndone a lot of things I've been you know\nI've always I've I have ADHD uh-huh\nand I never was medicated for it I tried\nI tried therapy and all these other\ndifferent things for it and and nothing\never seemed to work but\num I I jumped from thing to thing to\nthing pretty rapidly and it's actually\nnot until the last year or so that I\nstarted medication for it because I'm\nterrified of medicines or I'm terrified\nof what are they called knock-knock\nsimulants yes yeah I'm terrified yeah\nyou and me both man but yes so I've\nlived most of my life jumping from\nsubject to subject to subject and and\ndoing stuff and excelling at it and\nthey're just like shooting off to the\nnext thing and with gaming I'm\noriginally British by the way I grew up\nin England and and then I moved up here\nand when I moved over here I got almost\nimmediately into counter-strike 1.6 okay\nand I played it just about every single\nday and I you know I got what i would\nconsider quite good at it and i joined a\nlocal team that was that we did quite\ngood at it any there was there were very\nfew people in\npublic games or public servers or people\nthat live like around me or people I\nwent to school with that were better\nthan me like I didn't have a problem\nstomping people out though one casuals\nthere you go people that were casuals\nyeah so I got quite good at that and I\nrecognized that I was quite good at that\nso I decided that you know I kind of\nwanted to do more I wanted to challenge\nmyself a little bit more so I started to\nlook more towards doing like lands and\ncompetitive stuff and there was a land\ncenter that opened up in my town\nconveniently right around that time and\nI started to go there very often and\nthey started the team for 1.6 and I\nstarted playing for that team and it\nkind of like took off from there\nand 1.6 went really well for me and then\nI went to and then source came out and I\ndecided to want to keep playing through\nCounter Strike sauce but when\ncounter-strike source came out there was\na big upset in\nprofessional I'm gonna use air quotes\nprofessional counter-strike at the time\nbecause sauce wasn't widely accepted by\nall of the players and all the\nprofessional players and I wouldn't like\nthe only reason I would say that I\nconsider myself a professional is\nbecause twitch accepted it and they gave\nme a pot in a badge don't know why the\nheck they did that but you know let's\nnot question I don't want to take it\naway and I got winnings for playing for\na team oh cool we're looking at jerseys\nokay I was particularly intrigued with\nthe underwear oh yeah that was my sub\nmail a couple of months back it was a\nweird stuff oh yeah Chad Booma absolute\nboomer\ndude I'm more Boomer than dr. K over\nhere trust nice so anyway when when\nsource came out it wasn't widely\naccepted by the counter-strike community\nand or at least the pro counter-strike\ncommunity and a lot of players decided\nnot to just not to play it and not like\ncompetitively so and I was still a\nteenager so the you know there wasn't\nmuch money in it for me as it was to\nbegin with and I never saw it as a job\nI never sort of like I saw it as like um\nlike if you're on like a little league\nteam when you're a kid and you just you\njust playing you're having fun and\nyou're and you're competing at except\nfor I was getting like a couple hundred\nbucks if I did really well and that was\nlike my pocket money like I bought my\nfirst car off of counter-strike winnings\nWow\noh no it's a piece of crap so so yeah\nthat that that happens sauce came out\neverybody kind of just dissipated and as\ndid I so I went to trade school to\nbecome a welder I did welding for a\nlittle bit I was a mechanic for eight\nyears figs and whole bunch of cars\nand then a friend of mine that is a\nstreamer is a one-percent streamer had\nwhich that we main said 1% streamer a 1%\nstreamer Chad help me out I won't be\nsaid streamer would be someone like\nMoomin I'm trying not to name drop but\nwhat does that mean what a 1% over no no\nwhat is what 1% what does that mean a 1%\nstreamer would be the the top earnings\nor top viewers streamers on the platform\nproduct which yes okay so I was\ncontacted by this person and they said\nhey you know if you're still if you\nstill into video games and stuff like\nthat and you're still wanting to you\nknow play you should start up a stream\nand see see where it takes you okay and\nI was like okay so that I did that and\nit went really well at the beginning\nokay I'm very well at the beginning\nbecause I had this friend and we were\nworking together and we were working\ntogether relatively close and then\nthings kind of fell off and and you know\nthe fever ship fell off and all that\nother stuff so I kind of went down from\nlike a 200 viewer Andy all the way down\nto like a 20 50 viewer Andy okay\nso around in around that time I was like\nokay well maybe it's all falling off\nbecause I'm not as good as I was because\nI'm getting older and the shelf life of\na player is relatively short like it's\nnot like a traditional sport where most\npeople hit like their peak in their 30s\nmm-hmm so I decided maybe I just don't\npractice enough you know cuz I'd spend\nall this time doing you know traditional\njobs and stuff like that so maybe I just\nI just don't practice enough so I\nstarted practicing and practicing and\npracticing and trying to change things\nhere and there and do all these\ndifferent things and I I never got any\nbetter in fact I would argue that I\nstarted to get worse\nin some aspects what I was doing like I\nstarted to like regress a little bit\nokay and that dad worked me a little bit\nit kind of made me mad and it made me\nmore competitive and I've always been a\nreally competitive person mm-hmm\n[Music]\nso yeah when I started to go to go\nbackwards a little bit I thought about\nyou know well maybe I need to exercise\nmore maybe I need to eat better maybe I\nneed to do this maybe you need to do\nthat and I went through almost every\nsingle thing that I could think of to\nget rid of this skill ceiling like to\nshatter this ceiling and and get better\nand I just haven't been able to do it\nand it's this the ceilings been there\nfor almost everything like playing\nguitar driving cars like all sorts of\ndifferent things it's it so it's always\nbeen there\nyeah and I've never known how to destroy\nit don't get past it okay thank you so\nmuch for sharing I think you know and I\nthink maybe that this is kind of like\nthe place that I would go to look for\nthe the answer yeah so what kind of\nanswer are you looking for\nlet's say Ramona\n[Music]\nare we good\nChad if we're good say bacon say okay I\ndon't know what exactly happened but\nokay okay so I'm sorry about that so I\nthink I think they left off with I'm not\nsure you're gonna get exactly what you\nwant so this is what I was saying chat\nso I I think that this is one of the\nrare cases where I can actually so we\ncan talk about and we probably should\nmissus like feelings around various\nthings like where he's kind of coming\nfrom you know I see something about this\nconception that you have about a ceiling\nand that you're kind of relentlessly\nmoving forward in one direction but I\nthink oddly enough you know so so if I\nyou know you were kind of saying that\nyou sort of missed the boat on some\neSports opportunities you're like a\nlittle bit too old to like sort of\nreally catch that boom and then you kind\nof fell out of it for a while and you\nsort of made a second chance but I think\npart of your problem is that you're\nviewing success very narrowly so you're\nlike someone who sort of says like no\nmatter how hard I try I can't jump jump\nabove three feet whereas like it like\nlet's say there's like an apple that\nyou're trying to reach above you and\nyou're just jumping and you can't reach\nthe Apple you can't reach the Apple you\ncan't reach the Apple and you're kind of\nsaying like okay I tried to exercise I\ntried to like get on medication for ADHD\nand no matter even though I'm doing all\nof these things right no matter how hard\nI jump I'm not able to reach the Apple\nand so you're coming here and you're\nsaying like okay maybe if we talk things\nthrough I'll be able to jump high enough\nto reach the Apple whereas what I'm\ngonna tell you is go find a ladder right\nI I think you can get to where you want\nto go I think you just have a very\nnarrow focus in terms of how you're\ntrying to achieve your goal mm-hmm the\nother thing that I think is going on is\nthat I think some of that narrow focuses\nby like not really understanding not\nhaving realistic expectations about\ncertain things so I think that you need\nto start making decisions based on data\nas opposed to like thoughts and feelings\nand sort of what you see around you and\nthis is why I'm kind of asking some of\nthese questions so the question that I\nwas asking is so it is is that I mean\nmake sense that just like jet narrow\nexpectation of success yeah yeah I mean\nit's my fence okay so like I'm just\ngonna give you guys an example so I'm\nactually hopefully gonna publish a paper\nabout this because there's no research\non this so I've started to do actual\nlike research on this stuff and I'd like\nto publish this data cuz I don't think\nanyone knows this stuff so news was\nsaying you know he used this phrase like\ntop 1% in terms of like twitch streamers\nso I was asking is how many people\nstream on Twitch is about 2.5 million\nokay last I sorry yeah fine\nso how much do you think the top 500\nstreamers what do they make on average\nper year on to about a million about a\nmillion eeeh okay top 300 so I think I\nthink like that's one times ten to the\nminus fifth so I think one three are\nwhat what is this let's do some ten to\nthe fifth or ten to the six so if you\nhave 2.2 million people\nfive hundred is gonna be like you know\nis gonna be like you know one in 10,000\nmm-hmm right so like this like okay so\nthat so the top one in 10,000 is gonna\nbe a top 500 streamer roughly mm-hmm\nso and you think that the top 500\nstreamers on Twitch make about 1 1\nmillion or so how much do you think the\ntop 300 streamers make on Twitch\nprobably about 1.5 million maybe maybe\ntouching 2 million okay how much do you\nthink the top 100 streamers make on\ntwitch uh 3 million and up okay and what\nabout the top 10 streamers in the 10\nbest scores on switch yeah so over time\nAlania easily okay\nand how confident are you in your\nanswers\nI would say pretty confident Martin 80%\na person okay so let's ask chat so\ntwitch at how much do you think the top\n500 streamers make on twitch so chat\nseems to think that 10 million is keep\nin mind Chad Devin Nash just did a video\non this like two or three days ago and\nwhat did he say 10 million is is a\npretty reasonable expectation for the\ntop the very tippity tip-top okay so of\ntour streamers I'd be curious about\nwhere he's getting his data so I don't\nknow where to get good data about this\nbut my analysis has been different you\nknow so top 500 like what are people\nsaying like people are saying like 50k\nor so right 50k for a person\nyeah okay so what do you guys think\nabout top 300 streamers\nway more than 50\ntop 300 is one mil to 500k okay so maybe\nI was up yeah\nand that tots alright so like I don't\nknow where to get good data about this\ncuz I'm new to twitch but based on the\ndata that I've what I did is look at\ntwitch aggregators and looked at the\ntotal amount of subs then twitch people\nhave and then looked at a few articles\nand compared so there are some articles\nthat are in depth about topstreamers and\nsort of say that this is how much they\nmake from subs I don't know how accurate\nthe state is this is how much they make\nfrom donations this is how they make\nfrom sponsorships this is how much they\nmake from like like advertising yeah and\nsort of I took the top ten streamers I'm\nnot talking about YouTube I'm just\ntalking about twitch income are you\ntalking about total income are you\ntalking about income from twitch I was\nactually just talking about substance\nsubscribers alone okay so I'd be really\ncurious and I could be wrong about this\nstuff but based on some of the twitch\naggregators which so this is publicly\navailable data in terms of subscribers\nright subscribers is publicly available\nand then what I did is I took the top\nten streamers and found articles about\nthem and compared how much they make\nfrom subs to how much they make from\neverything else and based on my analysis\nthe top 300 streamers make at least 10\ngrand a year the top 300 yes so my data\ncould be wrong this is the data source\nthat I'm using so I'm really curious\nabout you know where other people are\ngetting their data the top 300 people on\ntwitch make a hundred grand a year and\nthe top ten make over a million no I'm\nthinking more more chat how many how\nmany streamers do you think on this\nplatform have over 20,000 subscribers\nyes so so 10k subs so yeah let's so I\nmean I'm curious about this right so\ntwitch\nscriber aggregator right so let's find\nyou guys are saying who so 10,000 subs\nyes so like I'm looking at this twitch\ntracker calm I don't know how good this\ndata is support according to this the\ntop 30 streamers on Twitch have about\n10,000 subs that's top 30 out of 2.5\nmillion right so like I think there's a\nbig drop off between 30 and 100 and yeah\nso like according to Devin Nash so that\nI'd be curious about where Devin Nash is\ngetting his data because I'm just\ntalking about twitch some so I don't\nknow about other things but like this\nwebsite I don't know how good this\nwebsite is but it seems to aggregate\ntwitch data and they have api's and\nstuff so if you use this sub sir monthly\nright yeah yes so I get more of a split\nat certain yep amount some subscribers\nyeah you can renegotiate your split with\nwith twitch at certain points go to so\nuh let's just do some back of the napkin\nmath right now I don't know if this kind\nof stuff is like what y'all are looking\nfor but so 3,500 times it's five bucks\nper sub right and you get thirty percent\nof that so that's three point five yeah\nso is so you get three point five\ndollars per sub once you're a partner\nright no no you get you start out with\nthe initial 5050 and put for just tier\nones to two and three work differently\non the split but we'll go into that and\nthen yes you have 500 for a certain\namount of time then you can renegotiate\nto 275 and then three and then yeah so\nI'm assuming that your\n70% rate so let's just do this back of a\nnapkin math twitch so I'm looking at the\ntop one so the 100 the 100th person on\ntwitch has 3500 subs right according to\nthis website so I don't know maybe this\nwebsite is wrong if you have 3500 subs\nand you're making three point five\ndollars per sub that's $12,000 a month\nso from subs this making this guy is\ngonna make about a hundred and fifty\ngrand a year wait and that's the average\nPatna that's what that's the one hunt\nnumber 100 the what number 100 on the\nsubscriber count so this guy has is at\nthe bottom he's number 100 in terms of\nnumber of subs\n[Music]\nhmm yeah so yes he is 3500 subs so if\nyou guys have better data I'm open to\nlisten to it I don't I don't really talk\nmuch about about money on twitch so I'm\nI'm yeah so but I know it here is that\nlike I think I don't know so I think\nwhat's going on so I tried to look for\ndata on this stuff and I think that the\nnumbers are way inflated based on what I\ncan find\nso there may be a lot of income that I'm\nnot considering like YouTube and like\npatreon and like all these other income\nstreams like I'm not sure but based on\nthe actual data that I can find I think\nthis is a huge problem because I think\nlike when you say top 1% the top 1% of\nstreamers I think makes [ __ ] because\nthere are two point five million\nstreamers so the top 1% of streamers on\ntwitch is the top 25,000 streamers on\ntwitch okay yeah you're much better at\nmath than I am right so so I think the\nfirst thing is like I and like I said\nI'm gonna publish a paper about this and\nI'm glad you guys told me about Devin\nand things like that because I think\nthat you know I'll talk to Devon about\nit personally and I'll watch this this\ndisguised toast video and I think that\nYouTube in a lot of ways is more\nlucrative than twitch but I don't know\nlike these guys are the experts in this\nstuff I'm not an expert I'm\nto scientists and I found whatever data\nI could get my hands on and I analyzed\nit but the first thing is that when\nyou're kind of thinking about your\nsuccess\nyou should understand like what you're\nactually comparing it to because if\nyou're comparing it to you know like if\nyou're expecting to make like you said\nyou bought a car and you said like\nthat's not that big of a deal based on\nmy analysis that probably makes you\nquite successful on twitch like you're\nprobably in the top 1% you're in the top\n25,000 if you're making well it was hard\nit wasn't from streaming that that that\nincome was from from tournament winnings\nand stuff like that it wasn't it wasn't\nfrom streaming I didn't stop streaming\nlike regularly until about 2016 but I've\nI've it's really hard to explain but\nI've been on Twitch since it was just in\nTV yeah but I didn't start like taking\nstreaming seriously until about 2016\nyeah so so so it sounds like that was\nfrom your tournament winnings but the\nfirst thing I think is that we've got to\ndo is take a step back and think about\nwhat your what your goals are and what\nyour expectations are for success so the\nfirst paper that I'm going to publish is\ngoing to be about percentage of eSports\nplayers like I'm curious if you guys\nwant to know this like what percentage\nof people become professionals in a\nparticular eSport what percentage of\nprofessionals earn what percentage of\nprize pools so this is the first paper\nthat I'm gonna publish it's gonna look\nat five or six eSports and tell you what\npercentage of people go pro what\npercentage of people who go pro earn a\nsignificant amount of money what\npercentage of the player base do you\nneed to be in to make a hundred grand a\nyear and the numbers I think are gonna\nshock a lot of people because I have\nthis this impression that there's a huge\nbias going on in the minds of like\nstreamers and youtubers which is that we\nsee we have a huge bias towards seeing\nthe most successful people so we somehow\nthink that that's common whereas like as\npeople are noticing 2.5 million people\nare streaming on Twitch like most of\nthem get like less than 5 views per\nstream\nfor the lifetime of their stream so\nthere's like this huge community of like\nand that's where we need to think about\nourselves so so my sense just the short\nconclusion to my paper is gonna be that\nyour likelihood of becoming earning a\nsalary where you make at least a hundred\nor not even the salary a total lifetime\nwinnings in an esport of a hundred grand\nis the same percentage chance as you\nplaying basketball in high school and\nending up in the NBA\nthen so you were long if you were on the\nhigh school basketball team your chances\nof entering the NBA are the same as if\nyou play an eSport making a hundred\ngrand of lifetime earnings and I think\nsorry yeah go for a job there's a lot of\nprofessional counter-strike players now\nwho's after their entire career spanning\nfrom like spanning from one point six to\ncsgo and they're on massive\norganizations that their total winnings\nis for their entire careers like a\nhundred and fifty thousand some of them\nyeah not all of them but some of them so\nI think like the first thing is that if\nyou're interested in making it in this\nbusiness I think you've got to be really\nrealistic and don't set yourself up for\na false standard I don't think it's my I\ndon't think my problem here is or my my\nask here is like like monetary success\nor stream success or or anything like\nthat I think I'm too competitive\nI'm way too competitive and I don't know\nhow to dial it back and I've never been\nable to frickin dial it back what do you\nmean by waiting oh sorry go ahead\noh it's ruining my content because when\nI play a game that I don't care about or\nwhen I play a game strictly for fun my\nstreams are way more fun to watch I'm\nI'm more laid-back I'm more funny I do\nalso like I do like you know more sub\ngames and stuff like that but if if it\nbites me and I get competitive about it\nthen everything makes me upset when\nthings don't go the way I like the way I\nexpect them to or if I'm you know if I\nget outplayed or something like that\nwhich happens often now because I'm 30\nI'm an old man so I get outplayed all\nall the damn time but the but it it\nmakes me mad and it makes me more mad\nthan it should because I know that that\npart of my life is over\nI'm not a professional player I'm not a\nprofessional player in even this era of\neSports like I just want to make content\nand I just want to be happy making that\ncontent and I just want to make the\npeople that enjoy that content happy\nokay that we can definitely so now we're\ngonna switch gears okay so thank you for\nsharing that is because I think that\nthis is going in a direction that I\ndon't know if that's going to help you\nbut I think what I'm hearing from you is\nthat you make your best content when\nyou're free from expectations and when\nyour expectations get dashed that's when\nyou sort of get into a funk and the funk\nin turn negatively impacts your content\nyes so I think that so the reason I sort\nof mentioned all the the the twitch data\nis because I think it starts with\nexpectation\nright so you're saying that the crocs is\nwhen your expectations are dashed that's\nwhen you start to tilt and when you\nstart to tilt the content that you\nproduce in the way that you play the\ngame gets negatively impacted when when\nI take the game too seriously as soon as\nthe game goes from being fun to being\nlike whatever whatever switch pops in my\nbrain and it says oh now you got to be\nthe best that's when it gets ruined and\nthat's when I completely agree so let's\nlet's understand that switch right so\nwhat is that switch\nyou\nprobably my ego getting dashed from\nsomebody bet being better than me okay\neven though I tried to tell myself you\ndon't care about this game you don't\ncare about being good at this game like\nit doesn't matter don't worry about it\nit still happens so so what what what\nhurts once when someone is better than\nyou like you tell yourself that it\ndoesn't matter but it clearly does right\nyes it does what you tell yourself is\nthat it shouldn't matter but if you want\nit to not matter telling yourself it\nshouldn't matter is not the way that you\ndo it if you want it to not matter\nanymore you have to understand why it\nmatters okay so I want you to think\nabout it this way like if a dog is\nbarking and I tell the dog hey there's\nnothing going on there's no reason to\nbark is that dog gonna stop barking no\nso why is the dog barking to begin with\nit feels like that there's something\nexactly right so so how do we get the\ndog to stop barking\nlet it outside to see for itself sure I\nthink that's a great answer right we\nhave to address we have to address the\nunderlying source of the dogs anxiety\nand letting it go look outside and see\noh there's nothing there we'll do it or\nwe can somehow calm it down so then the\nquestion becomes it's not that it\nshouldn't matter because it clearly does\nbut what does it feel to you like like\nwhat does it feel like when these people\nlike beat you in a game you're playing\nyou're having fun someone out plays you\nand then how do you feel I don't know I\njust I just don't feel like\nI feel like I'm kind of like riding on\nthis on this on this boat or this wave\nthat I'm still good and then it's just\nthe realization that I mean I may still\nbe good I don't know but the generation\nthat's coming up now are just better\nthey're faster they're more in tune they\npractice harder like they're just\nthey're just brought up better than when\nI grew up but you're playing these games\nI'm just there it's trying harder the\nTrain how does that make you feel it\nmakes me feel like I haven't done enough\nto stay relevant to stay good in these\ngames like I haven't I haven't put the\ntime in\nlike I'm older than these people I've\nbeen playing these games for so much\nlonger you know you would think X amount\nmore hours into these games than these\nother people I should be you know at\nthis level but I'm just not so there's\nsomething that I'm not like that I'm not\ndoing that they're doing and it just\ngets into my head and it makes me think\nlike what are these people doing what\nwell so I think this is this is the\nproblem this because you think that\nthere's something that you can do that\nwill make you that good yes I believe\nthat anybody that any one human can do\nwhat any other human can do I truly\nbelieve that that if you have able-body\nenabled minds that you can be just as\ngreat as anybody else and I don't think\nthat it age means anything I don't think\nif you if you could put your mind to\nsomething you can do it that's how I\nfeel okay where did you get that belief\nthing that was something that my\ngrandfather told me when I was when I\nwas probably about 10 or 11 okay and\nthat sounds very encouraging yeah yeah\nyeah how does that belief make you feel\nI guess it depends on when I think about\nit okay so so if I think about it first\nthing when I wake up I feel like yeah I\ncould be just as good as anybody else I\ncan be just as as as good as the next\nguy\nor just as good as the person I see you\nknow slaying out and doing really good I\ncould be that guy but if it's if it's\nright after I just got you know rail by\nsomebody and I think about that that I'm\njust like if that's if that's the case\nwhy am i you know what am I doing wrong\nwhy am I still not you know doing better\nso I see that is sort of inspirational\non the one hand and it's also the way\nthat you beat yourself up on the other\nhmm what do you think about that I mean\nthere's no arguing it I mean it sounds\nreasonable it sounds logical yeah but I\nmean is that what you do do you beat\nyourself up with that belief like\nsometimes it inspires you and other\ntimes you use that to blame yourself for\nyour failures and you say that if you\nhad if you had worked harder you could\nhave accomplished more so you [ __ ]\nneed to work harder and why can't you\nwork harder yeah I suppose I do beat\nmyself up but with it sometimes I don't\ngo out my way to do it but it I guess no\nI don't think you go out of your way I\nthink it's reflexive I think it's habit\nright like every time you get outplayed\nnot maybe not every time but when you\nget outplayed it's really easy to think\nlike man like I should be able to do\nthis like I should be able to do this\nmm-hmm does that make sense yes yes and\nit's exactly what goes through my mind\nyeah and I don't even think I think the\nthe problem here is that when I say beat\nyourself up it's hard for you too\nthink about it like that because it's\nbecome so automatic like you they just\nthink that that's true it's just does\nthat sort of make sense like you say\nyeah I do this all the time but you\ndon't consider it beating yourself up um\nI think I think if I could put a little\nI could put a little context to this\nsure because my coach like when I was 17\nor 18 years old told me that there is\nabsolutely no excuse for failure and\nit's like I don't think that he was a\nvery good coach I don't think that I\nthink he he he led me and and and taught\nme through anger so and looking back on\nit now that's that's almost exactly what\nhe did so like if I if if I lost and I\nsat there and I thought oh man I just\ngot out play but you know he was so much\nbetter than me he would come up and be\nlike you shouldn't be this comfortable\nbeing being bested like that you\nshouldn't feel comfortable getting beat\nlike that it should it should inspire\nyou it should make you you know it\nshould make you want to be better than\nthat person there's you know you\nshouldn't be happy in losing you\nshouldn't be content in losing and\nthat's what he would drill into my mind\nall the time do you think that got\ndrilled in yes absolutely do you think\nthat your mind operates that way now yes\nand what do you think about that belief\nI know logically that it's it's crap and\nit's not sports been like and it's not\nrealistic it's I mean it's sad you\nshould be able to appreciate somebody's\nskill when they beat you always yeah so\nat the beginning of this you remember\nwhen I told you that I'm I'm sorry to\nsay this news but I don't think I'm\ngonna give you the answer that you're\ngonna look that you're looking for\nbecause I think your your app\nyou're the answer that you're looking\nfor is something that'll let you break\nthrough that skill ceiling whereas I\nthink the basic problem here is that\nlike your premise about the ceiling is\nwrong right that you're you're telling\nme that he led you through anger and you\nstarted to believe that there's like you\nshould you should want to be able to\nbeat them and you should find you should\nstart with the belief that it is\npossible to beat them because if you\ndon't start with the belief that it's\npossible to beat them then there's like\nthat's what fuels you to go forward and\nI think this is the pattern that you've\nkind of count like you've reinforced\ntime and time and time again and I think\nthe reason that you give up is because\nin a weird way like you lose heart\nbecause you don't live up to your own\nexpectations so then you quit but you\nset such a high standard for yourself\nthat the only option is failure so like\nlet me ask you this is I know that\nsounds weird but we'll get there so like\nwhen when you switched from one when you\nwere playing 1.6 how did you feel about\nyourself\ngreat\nI felt worried about that there was a\nnumber of things I did at that age that\nI would that you know I was competitive\nin I used to race motocross and I did\ncombat sports and stuff like that but\nthey were always like things that felt\nlike hobbies like the racing motocross\nwas my dad's idea and it was kind of\nlike what he wanted me to pursue so I\ndid that to make him happy\nthe the the combat sports felt like just\nkind of something to do after school so\nand but the the gaming was something\nthat I like I was passionate about and\nthat I drove myself to get better at so\nlet's pause for a second what was the\ngoal that were you were driving yourself\ntowards when you were playing 1.6 to\nhave fun okay cuz back then there was I\nmean eSports was cyber athletics League\nit was basically a forum okay so so what\nI'm hearing you saying is that your goal\nwas to have fun and get better yeah so\nlet's talk about the transition to\nsource how did you feel when when source\ncame out when sauce came out I've been\ncompeting for a little bit and I'd kind\nof like knew there was something there\nbut I didn't see the future in it\nbecause the the game was like so\nhorribly accepted that I was like okay\nwell that's it then that no one's gonna\nplay this game professionally there's no\nlike there's no point in me staying here\nlike I'm just gonna go to school so\nthat's why I would you trade school and\nI went to university and that happens\nlike a lot in eSports like games will go\nup and and you'll you'll work your butt\noff to get really good at that game and\nthen that game will kind of like fall\noff and then a new game will pop up and\nthen you've got a you know you've got a\ncan constantly be chasing different\ngames all the time if you constantly be\nchasing different games for what though\nwhy are you chasing that game\nif you're making a career out of it then\nyou know so then so then why are you\nokay so you say they go to make a living\nout of it so so would you say that the\nreason that you were tried to get good\nat source and ultimately the reason that\nyou left source was because you felt\nlike you couldn't make a career out of\nit or that winning was insufficient to\nmake a career yeah I mean I saw the\ncommunity breaking up and I saw people\nlike just not interested in it and I I\ntoo thought you know and I I need to I\nneed a real job I need a real job I need\nreal education like this doesn't make\nany money so I'm not hearing anything\nabout this sort of drive to succeed\ndrive to be better than everyone else\ndrive to win drive that if you put in\nenough enough time that you will be\nsuccessful I'm not hearing any of that\nwhen it comes to source\nwell source falling apart didn't have\nanything to do with my personal Drive\nlike I could still be good at the game\nbut if the game doesn't have the the\ncompetitive following like that there's\nthere's nothing I can do about that\nyeah of course so I saw I put that\npassion into school okay yeah but that's\nall I'm saying right is is that I'm not\nsaying that it wasn't warranted for you\nto think what you did I'm just noting a\ndistinct difference between your\nattitude between one-point-six and\nsource no like it in one it was about\nhaving fun it was about getting better\nand in the other it was about a career\nand there's no career so let's forget it\nso let's talk about becoming a welder\nhow did you feel about that\nI felt really really proud of myself\nlike unbelievably proud of myself okay I\nliked working with my hands I liked like\nyeah I liked building things I liked\nfeeling like you know what's the word\nI'm looking for uh the phrase or word\nI'm looking for here like I felt pretty\naccomplished but I I had made that\nsomehow I had made that competitive as\nwell like I've always wanted my welds to\nbe better I always wanted you know else\nto be better than what other welders\nthat like I worked at a shipyard for a\nwhile as a bulkhead welder and there was\nother bulkhead welders and you know we'd\nget done with a day's work and you know\nweld inspection would come around and I\nwould always want from mine to be as\nflawless as a weld could be you know\njust so Isis feels oh hold on a second\nthis is important there's a difference\nbetween your welds being better than\nother people's welds and your welds\nbeing as flawless as they can be\nwhat's the distinction though exactly\nexactly\nokay so let's say that I enter a chili\ncook-off okay and getting the first\nprize in the chili cook-off\nis different from making really good\nchili\nso I can make really really good chili\nhmm and I can be from Texas or I can be\nin New England and win a chili cook-off\nand it's still gonna be shitty chili so\nit Madison the total that you're up\nagainst absolutely\nso comparison so let me just have you\nlisten to the language okay you think\nit's competition but I don't think it's\ncompetition against others so this is\njust the language that you used when you\nwere playing 1.6 you are happier when\nyou were playing source I think you are\nless happy when you were welding you\nwere more happy so let's see and right\nnow you're not happy you're discontent\nand what I'm noticing is there's a\nsubtle thread there's a subtle theme in\nthe times that you're happy and the\ntimes that you're unhappy when when\nyou're happy it's about having fun and\ngetting better when you're happy it's\nabout making the most flawless weld that\nyou can hmm when you're unhappy it's not\nabout playing a good game it's not about\nhaving fun it's not even about playing\nthe perfect game it's playing a game\nthat isn't as good as someone else's\nplaying one is about you and one is\nabout other people\none is about a comparison of your worth\nrelated to other people and one is about\njust your work and the work that you put\nout\nwhen you stream and you create good\ncontent you're not thinking about other\npeople you're thinking about having fun\nand playing the game and when you create\nbad content you're thinking about other\npeople mm-hmm that's all coming full\ncircle now yeah I mean that I am the\nhappiest what I'm just enjoying\nstreaming and I'm enjoying like being\nsunny and having fun absolutely and I\nthink that you you do you are\ncompetitive and that competitiveness can\nmanifest towards yourself or towards\nother people and what I mean by that is\nyou can weld one day and you can say\nthis weld was not perfect tomorrow I'm\ngonna do better that's what I think what\nyou mean by by being competitive and I\ndo think that you get enjoyment out of\nhaving your welds be better than other\npeople's but something tells me that if\nyou were surrounded by shitty welders I\nwould hope that you continued to try to\nimprove your welding yes that there's a\ndifference between creating like a good\nproduct and creating the best product\nlike there's a difference between being\nthe best and being better than other\npeople\noh my dog that's okay does that well\nhe's doing exactly what you were talking\nabout a minute ago yeah\n[Music]\nso I have I have a question what is\nforsen CD what does that mean I see\npeople posting about fours in CD a lot\nso he's gonna hang out with me now\nthat's what the chat and dr. K means\nzerah\nhe likes to buy said nothing he likes to\nwhat barking okay okay so so tell me\nabout so does that make sense\nNate um yes yes it does it makes an\noverwhelming amount of sense and tell me\nwhat you understand what I understand is\nwhat I understand is that I'm I'm\nfocusing too much on on being better\nthan somebody else and not focusing\nenough on being better than myself\nabsolutely so now we're gonna go to one\nlast example okay how did you feel when\nthis 1% streamer reached out to you and\nsaid hey let's start working together um\nwell I didn't know how popular he was at\nthe time I just felt like an old friend\nwas reaching out to me and I felt like\ngood and how did you feel then misuk\nlike like good you know like how you\nfeel when any old friend reaches out to\nyou absolutely what 10 years generally\npositive and how did your feelings\nchange when you started to discover how\npopular they were\nI mean I didn't I didn't resent him I\ndidn't feel like jealous of him like not\ngenuinely happy that he was that he was\ndoing well I genuinely believed that how\ndid you feel about yourself I felt\nexcited that there was something for me\nto like try and something for me to try\nto excel at okay and then what happened\nand then I got back into shooter games\nand I mean it's it's so weird because at\nthe beginning I didn't do it to be the\nbest I just did it to be to be funny and\nhave fun and then you know it got out of\nhand but did when it got out of hand I\nswitched games almost immediately hold\non hold on so what is out of hand this\nis important out of control what is that\nin what way what got out of hand\nI got too competitive by okay okay much\non trying to get to the top of\nleaderboards and and prove to everybody\nwho was who was essentially nobody that\nI was so dang good like yeah so what do\nyou think like who are you thinking\nabout at that point yourself or other\npeople I was thinking about the other\npeople that were on the leaderboard that\nI'm sighs yeah right so at that point\nit's no longer about like welding for\nthe sake of welding it's about like\ncomparison to other people and I want\nyou to watch the shift and really think\nabout it because you use the word\nregression when you were describing this\nscenario mm-hmm that everything started\nout great but then you regressed and I\nthink we see it right here we see that\nwhen he reached out to you you didn't\nknow when you weren't thinking about\nother people it's just a friend reaching\nout and saying hey man let's do\nsomething fun and you were like [ __ ] it\nyeah let's do something fun mm-hmm and\nthen you started out and you had good\nviewership and everything was fantastic\nand you were having fun and they were\nhaving fun you didn't realize how big of\na deal they were and I don't I didn't\nmean to imply that I thought you were\njealous of them or anything like that\nbecause I don't think that's what it is\nI think all it is is you start to\ncompare your\nself it's not that you're jealous of\nthem it's just that you look at their\nsuccess and you look at your success and\nyou look at other people's success and\nthe more you start to compare it no\nlonger becomes about am i proud of what\nI created it becomes how does what I\ncreate compared to what other people\ncreate and the more that you move in\nthat direction the more you feel like a\nfailure and then you have this [ __ ]\nbelief which i think is adaptive and\ntoxic that if you put your mind to\nsomething you can accomplish whatever\nyou want you I do not believe that at\nall because I don't believe that you\ncontrol what happens in this world I\nthink all you control is what you do I\ndo not believe that I can become\nPresident of the United States and that\nanyone who puts their mind to it can\nbecome President of the United States I\ndon't believe that I think it's [ __ ]\nridiculous I don't think anyone can\nbecome a doctor I don't think anyone can\nbecome a TI winner or anyone become can\nbecome a professional eSports player I\ndon't think anyone can become anything\nthat they put their mind to I don't\nthink that anyone can cause someone else\nto fall in love with them I think all\nyou control in this life is what you do\nyou don't control what you get hmm I can\nwake up and I can I can do research and\nI can practice and I can create a Chile\nthat involves beans and three kinds of\nbacon and six kinds of peppers and I can\nmake the best chili that I can make but\nI have no control over whether I win the\ncontest\nI don't know if I necessarily like full\nand it might just be because I've sat\nhere and believed it for so long\nabsolutely I don't I don't undo make\nmore beliefs about life in a day yeah\nit's gonna take me some time to like get\nover it but in the back of my head all\nI'm hearing myself like all I'm hearing\nmyself my subconscious say is but we're\nall human so why is that saying that\nlimits\nI agreed I don't know it's like it's on\nloop yeah but so you're damn it on loop\non my life you're damn right we're all\nhuman and that's that's what you that's\nactually what you have trouble accepting\nbecause you believe you're superhuman\nyou believe that you're not just human\nthat if you work hard enough and you\nkeep working that you will achieve that\nyou can achieve anything that you put\nyour mind you that's not human\nso I think the really tricky thing about\nyour your belief system is that it like\nyou're preserving some kind of control\nover your life that I don't think you\nreally have like I think that in a weird\nway like you always consider yourself to\nbe responsible for everything that\nhappens to you and I'd be really curious\nlike where you got that idea because\nyou're kind of thinking like it's almost\nlike you're thinking about like the\nworld is a vacuum where your effort\ncreates a result and that nothing else\ninfluences that I don't believe that any\nperson who puts their mind to it will\nyou know can win a particular sporting\nevent I just don't think that's possible\nlike I think they're gonna hold it in\nthe time to practice and learn and and\nand and develop the skill set you you\ncan be the person that overcomes and\nwins you know a sporting event you a\nhand win but I don't think you're\nguaranteed to win so I had this problem\nso I did some consulting for a Korean\neSports organization and this is\nsomething that though like the head of\nthe organization just did not understand\nhe was like no if we practice and we\npractice harder then we can win and I\nwas like yeah you can win but you're not\nguaranteed to win yeah because that\nmakes sense you know you're not\nguaranteed anything but that's not the\nway you think right you say that if I if\nI had worked harder if I had if I had\ngrinded more then I would be able to be\nbetter than that guy\nyes I yes I believe that I believe that\nif I'd put in the same amount of time\nand the same amount of effort and tried\nto change the things about or changed\nthe bad habits that I'd built years\nbefore and and build in a different way\nthat I could possibly yes yes partner oh\nhold on hold on hold on hold on there's\na difference between possibly and\nguaranteed because I think in your mind\nit's not actually possibly I think in\nyour mind you believe that if you had\nlived a different life you were\nguaranteed to win a particular event or\na particular match a lot like me in my\nhead I don't think that I'm not talking\nabout logic I'm talking about this that\nwhen you lose there's a part of you that\nsays if I had done this better this\nwould not have happened I believe that\nwhat's in here is not possible it's\ndefinitive hmm that's what I hear you\nsaying\nI'm talking about the way that you feel\nthat when you look at your life and you\nsay I can't break out of the ceiling and\nthen what happens is the reason you\ncan't break out of the ceiling is\nbecause you [ __ ] up at some point or\nyou didn't do enough at some point hmm\nand I think that whole thing like needs\nto be dismantled I don't know exactly\nhow we're gonna do it but that that - so\nI mean I think this is where like you\nknow you're setting a particular goal\nfor yourself and you're beating yourself\nup because you don't achieve that goal\nwhereas I don't think you can achieve\nthat goal I don't think it's yours to\nachieve I think it's it as a human being\nyou can practice and you can dedicate\nyourself and you can work really hard\nand that oddly enough success is more\nlikely then but it's not guaranteed and\nwhen I look at the story of your life\nthe times in which you didn't shoot for\nsomething particular or the times where\nyou've been the most successful and the\ntime that the times that you've been\nmost content because when you were\nplaying 1.6 you weren't necessarily\ntrying to reach the Apple you're like\nI'm gonna play this [ __ ] game I'm\ngonna get as good as I can I'm gonna see\nhow many noobs I can own hmm and when\nyou weld it you were like I'm gonna put\nthis [ __ ] together I'm gonna weld and\nI'm gonna make it is damn close to a\nperfect weld as I can mm-hmm you didn't\nsay I'm going to make the perfect weld\nyou said I'm gonna make as close to a\nflawless weld as I can your words no\nguarantee effort Direction hope but\nhumility a lack of control\nI'm gonna make as close to a flawless\nweld as I can it wasn't I'm gonna make a\nfall as well\nand I think you're you're absolutely\nright that you have this belief that\nanything you can put your mind to you\ncan accomplish and that that belief can\nbe inspirational at some times but when\nyour ego gets activated and you have the\ncomparative mindset then it becomes\ntoxic and then you compare yourself to\nother people and then you say why am I\nnot good enough why the [ __ ] like I\nshould be able to do this because that's\nwhat you're really telling yourself it's\nnot I can put anything I can put do\nanything that I put my mind to the real\nthought so this is a it becomes a\ndifferent thought sounds like the same\nthing and at the beginning of the\nmorning I can do anything that I put my\nmind to when you're feeling bad the\nthought changes subtly but it changes\ntoo I should be able to do this hmm\nthat's the thought right do you\nunderstand that like that those are\ndifferent yes it's it's like it went\nfrom being hopeful to being feeling like\nI'm owed something yes yeah\nentitlement yes the other thing the\nother thing is that you beat yourself up\nfor it\nI think so entitlement is a little bit\ndifferent but you think you're owed\nsomething in life and you're not owed\n[ __ ] in life man sorry to tell you that\nlike this is this is the problem right\nso like earlier I was talking about\nputting the 140 like rejections up on my\nwall from medical schools like I'm not\nold like it took me a long time to get\nit through my [ __ ] head that I'm not\nowed [ __ ] from any of them like I can\nwork really hard and I can have a really\ngood score and I can have a really good\nGPA but at the end of the day I do not\nget to control whether someone accepts\nme in a medical school you do not get to\ncontrol like you can play really hard\nand you can work really hard and you\nwere saying this yourself that you\nshould be able to appreciate that like\nsomeone is better than you you should be\nable to like walk on to a field and play\na game and say I gave it my all but damn\nthey just played better and sometimes I\nhear when I work with eSports athletes\nwho are very successful most of them\nhave actually bad attitude\nthe ones that are the most successful\nare the ones that say that like and you\ncan watch like eSports interviews and\nsome people will say like they just\nplayed better that day it's not I'm not\ngood enough it's not that I didn't play\nwell enough it's just they played the\nbetter game that day that's what happens\nwhen you work with professional athletes\nthat's how it is and the ones who\nrecognize that or I think the ones that\nlike they focus on playing the best game\nthat they can and I want to genuinely\nfeel that every single time and I would\nbe lying if I said that I felt that way\nevery single time good 100% honesty I\nget I get that toxic feeling where I'm\njust I just feel like I messed up\nsomewhere yeah man so so I'm glad I'm\nglad you are honest with yourself about\nthat and I don't want you to start\ndeluding yourself into believing what\nyou should believe instead of what you\ndo believe what I want you to do is\nnotice it right as that toxicity comes\nup ask yourself Who am I thinking about\nnow am I thinking about me or am I\nthinking about them did I play\nthe best game that I could have played\nor was I distracted or did I not\nexercise or whatever and I think that\nlike that's really where you need to\npivot like you need to catch yourself as\nyou start to tilt and you start to think\nabout other people try to bring the\nfocus back to yourself and you can do\nthat through have you have you watched\nany of our meditation stuff I have\nliterally watched every single YouTube\nvideo that you've put out and okay\nsingle stream I've double watched\neverything okay so I think we're gonna\ndo a little bit of meditation right now\nand then we're gonna do questions if\nthat's okay should I go get a dog no\nthat's okay I think the dog being a\ndistraction is actually a good thing\nokay so so first of all this do you have\nquestions I do but I like ADHD brain\nthey've escaped me and I'll have to find\nhim again let me ask you kind of just\none last question\nso through healthy game or we've had\nsome obscene we've had some downs so\nwe've done some stuff that's worked\nreally well on some stuff that hasn't\nworked really well this is what I'll\ntell you just about my own experience\nthere are some times that sometimes we\nthink about how to make successful\ncontent and how do you think that works\nout could you repeat that just yeah the\nend of it so we sometimes try to make\nsuccessful content we think about like\nhow are we gonna make something that's\ngonna be successful how are we gonna get\na lot of views on YouTube and twitch\nokay and and what do you think happens\nwhen we think about that um you probably\noveranalyze it maybe and you and you\noverthink it and it doesn't perform the\nway you think it should because it's\nactually way simpler than then it seems\nso how do we what's what's that\nsimplicity how do we make successful\ncontent make it digestible make it make\nit something that's so simple everybody\nwhen it in yeah anybody from any mindset\nfrom any education level can see it and\ndesire to click on and watch okay that\nis exactly the kind of thinking that\nleads us to failure oh so here's what we\ndo do you think when I when I started\ninterviewing you and when I interview\npeople do I do you think I think about\nmaking it digestible for everyone no no\nI don't think you do what do I think\nabout in the actual videos itself the in\nthe actual content I think you're\nthinking about the situation I had the\nperson that you're talking to you\nabsolutely yeah so I have no idea if\nthis is gonna get up votes or down votes\nand frankly I don't [ __ ] care mmm\nwe make our best content when we stay\ntrue to our mission which is building\nthe best piece of like welding equipment\nwe can which is to get on an interview\nwith you and all I care about is you\nthat's what happens that's all I care\nabout is like serving you and helping\nyou and I think that's what resonates\nwith people it's like if you make chili\nif you just you don't try to win the\nchili contest that's exactly what you're\ntalking about earlier which is all this\nmarketing stuff which I know that a lot\nof people are way more successful than I\nam understand which is like how to make\ndigestible stuff you know we have people\nediting or YouTube so I know that that's\nan important part but at its core it's\nto play the best game that I can it's\nnot to play the game better than anyone\nelse I don't want to beat anyone on\nYouTube\nanytime I think about that I get [ __ ]\ngets in my head and then like I'm not\nthinking about you and then I can't help\nyou it's to do the task at hand and do\nthat task as best as you can\nI feel like there should be and I always\nhave trouble coming up with the right\nwords I know what I want to say up here\nit's there I just say a shitty version\nof it I feel like there should be\nmilestones as to how I can get myself to\nchange that thought pattern I feel like\nthere should be yes like things that I\ncan practice and things that I can\ntangibly see and do to stop myself from\nthinking like that because I don't want\nto think like that yeah what I'm see I'm\nlike I said at the beginning I am a\ngenuinely happy person I do have like\nlike I'm a happy guy and and I do\ngenuinely scream for chat in fact i\nwatch most streams for chat like I get\nmy entire entertainment out of twitch.tv\nfrom chat because chats reactions are\nhilarious to just about everything and\nit's just like yeah but just think about\nthat for a second right so when you\nwatch chat there are two ways to watch\nchat one way to watch chat is for your\nenjoyment and to create like a good\ninteraction for yourself and for chat\nthe other way to watch chat is to see if\nchat likes what you're doing or doesn't\nlike what you're doing right like do you\nsee the difference there one is about\nlike you being there in the moment and\njust creating a fun experience for\nyourself and for them and the other is\nlike oh let me try to do whatever chat\nlikes mm-hm\npogchamp five head fours and CD while\nall-all-all\ncat cafe hands like if I kick out of it\neven if they hate me exactly exactly\nbut so but see that's the just think\nabout that for a second right because\nwhat you're thinking about is their\nopinions of you and your comparison\ndoesn't matter it's about you focusing\non yourself and you're absolutely right\nthat there are milestones and there's a\npath to move from this way of thinking\nto a better way of thinking and I think\nthat path starts with meditation the\nother thing it starts with is for you to\nnotice within yourself and try to see\nlike what are you zooming in on are you\nzooming on in on the act are you zooming\nin on the outcome are you trying to\nfulfill an expectation or you just are\nyou trying to just play the best game\nthat you can right like every time I\nload up a game I can play to win\nor I can play the best game that I know\nhow to play those are two very different\nthings I want to stop being competitive\nlike that\nI want to instead of think about how can\nI play the best game that I can play I\nwant to think how can I be the most\nentertaining person that I can be\ninstead of worrying about the game at\nall because yeah this is some of the\nbest most entertaining streamers that\nI've ever seen could care less how\nthey're doing in the game in fact most\nof the time they're intentionally\nplaying bad because it's funnier that\nway yeah so I want that so I think this\nis where you start so we'll do\nmeditation in a second but what I want\nyou to see what I want you to see is is\njust notice so it starts with noticing\nso this is like a big thing that I\nbelieve that many people like don't\nbelieve I believe that noticing and\nunderstanding is actually enough to\nchange behavior mm-hmm this is different\nfrom having information but noticing I\nthink once you have true noticing or\nawareness of something it's gonna change\nso that like if you get burned by\nsomething you're not you're gonna\ncontinue like if I get burned by a hot\nstove in my hand is numb I'm gonna\ncontinue getting burned by the hot stove\nbut if I know if I notice that this is\nthis is the source of my pain if I\nnotice and become aware of my thoughts\nthen I get control over them I think the\nproblem is that you don't know how you\nshift from one mindset to another so the\nfirst thing you've got to do is just\nnotice the shift then you'll get control\nover as crazy as that sounds I believe\nso this is the other big thing as people\nthink that like I made some magical\ntransformation that I was like a\ncaterpillar and I became a butterfly\nlike I was failing out of college and\nnow I'm super successful they don't\nunderstand I'm the same [ __ ] that I\nused to be I'm just as lazy I\nprocrastinate just as much and they're\nlike how does that happen it's just I\njust noticed stuff about myself it's not\nthat I've changed it's just I just see\nthat [ __ ] I understand a little bit\nbetter about why I procrastinate and\nsometimes that's enough so start with\nthe noticing so when you have a good day\nlike take a step back and like ask\nyourself why am I having fun when you\nstart\nnot have fun noticed that to say oh [ __ ]\nI'm not feeling good about myself and\nthen ask yourself what am I thinking\nabout am I thinking about other people\nor am I thinking about myself how do I\nget the game back on me like how do I\nfocus on myself again how do I stop\nlooking out the window and start looking\nin a mirror\nyou know like that's what you need to do\njust start with that and then meditate\nso we're gonna do the we're gonna do the\nalternate nostril breathing you remember\nthis one yeah yep so I was buying this\nright before we uh right before the\ncofán tastic yeah so what we'll do it a\nlittle bit more okay\nso this is the practice for those of\ny'all who haven't seen it so take your\nwe're gonna do alternate nostril\nbreathing so take your thumb and block\nyour right nostril and breathe in\nthrough your left and then switch to the\nother side and then breathe out breathe\nin through the same side don't switch\nswitch it breathe out breathe in switch\nbreathe out\nbreathe in switch breathe out breathe in\nswitch\nbreathe out and now continue at your own\npace we'll practice for about two\nminutes\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\ngo ahead and finish the round that\nyou're on let your eyes remain closed\n[Music]\nyou\nyou\nyou\n[Music]\nalright go ahead and come on back so\nI want you to take a snapshot of how you\nfeel right now\nyou\nhow do you feel\ndetermined\nhungry to do what\n- to do\nto\nyou better\n[Music]\nto think more without the restraints of\ncompetitiveness because that's what I\nfeel that's what that's how it feels it\nfeel it feels like I'm being tied to a\nradiator in a basement yeah that's how\ncompetitiveness feels to me now yeah so\nyou used to feel good so now it feels\nlike a gross those thoughts I think are\nactually another radiator so I'm chained\nto two radiators on it\nyeah I don't mean to and I think that's\nokay you're on one step but eventually\nyou need to let go of that too\nso as you breathe as you focus on\nyourself your goal is to actually be\ncompletely content with where you are\nhmm but I think we'll settle so you're\nright that there are milestones involved\nthe first milestone is to step away from\ncomparing yourself to other people and\nthen eventually this milestone needs to\nbe shed as well but this is a great\nplace to start and I think that you're\nvery competitive and goal-oriented by\nnature so I think that that's fine but\neventually we want to take that away too\nbut we'll we'll work on that my goals\nyes so I think your your way to goal\nfocused and I think the challenge here\nso I'll leave one last thing with you I\nthink the reason that you shift too much\nis because you get highly highly\ndetermined and it's that determination\nthat you rely on to move forward and\nthen one day when you wake up and the\ndetermination is gone it's very\ndifficult to move forward so oddly\nenough what you need to do is learn how\nto move forward without determination\nwhich is like tricky yeah but that I\nmean at this point in time makes a\nlittle sense to me but but you but you\nunderstand the pattern right like you\nwake up and you're like gung-ho today's\nthe day like we're gonna do it and\nyou're motivated and you're optimistic\nand you drive forward and then what\nhappens when you wake up and you don't\nhave that because that feeling goes away\nright\nI feel mad at myself yeah Amen I'm\nmissing an important part of myself one\npoint-six source welder mechanic back to\ntwitch because that determination wanes\nand then you blame yourself for not\nbeing determined\nwhereas what you really need to do is\nlearn how to operate without\ndetermination that your motivation\nmotivation is going to fade over time\nlike you just have to understand that\nthis is maybe a conversation for a\ndifferent day let's start well it's the\nwhole yeah so I think like like how to\nhow to act without that internal sense\nof determination I think some people in\ntwitch at understood I'm very impressed\nwith twitch chat by the way because I\nthink they're picking up a lot I love\nyou good said I love you never change\nnews I think it's it's awesome that you\ncame on um I know that I'm sorry I\nwasn't able to quite give you what you\nwant to but I really do believe that\nyour this is gonna help you move forward\nso start feel like I've actually got a\nlook III feel like I got a lot from this\nand I think actually the really cool\nthing is that you did such a good job of\nmoving to a new place that we are\nopening up an entire new can of worms\nbut you can't open up you've actually\nhit a milestone and what I'm telling you\nis I see a whole other plateau that you\nneed to climb and move down but that's\nfor another day okay\nabsolutely strong work man thank you for\ncoming on it was an absolute pleasure\nthank you so much for having me thank\nyou and hopefully we'll be able to check\nit with you again in a few weeks or a\nfew months or something okay right on\nokay we're gonna have a great day"
