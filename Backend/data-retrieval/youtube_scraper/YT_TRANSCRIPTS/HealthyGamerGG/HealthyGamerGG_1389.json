    "transcript": "it's crazy like what on earth why do\npeople expend so much energy in hating\nyou so the first thing to understand is\nthat that has nothing to do with you\nlike Lily I know I was talking about how\nyou were amazing and inspirational and\nyou can transform lives and all that\ngood stuff I don't think you have it\nwithin you to inspire someone to mail\nsomething that comes from them it\ndoesn't come from you\nyeah are you feeling okay I'm getting\nover a cold\nthat's unfortunate yeah\nwhat do you what do you do to take care\nof yourself when you get a cold um I try\nto take my quote equal a lot of cough\ndrops try to drink a lot of water um try\nto sleep\ndoes that when you say try to sleep is\nit do you not get enough sleep um yeah\nwait lately\ntrouble sleeping I'm sorry to hear that\nis that because you're sick um no just\nin general I don't know just recently to\nlook at me hmm I'm not supposed to\ndispense medical advice over the\ninternet so this is not medical advice\nyeah so recent studies have shown that\nhoney lemon tea is actually equally\neffective to over-the-counter cough\nremedies\nI mean cold remedies when it comes to\nactually treating symptoms okay so it's\nit's kind of bizarre but apparently like\nhoney lemon tea works just as well and I\ndon't have a reference at my fingertips\nfor that right now but I think it's\nactually they were looking at kids so\nthis is a pediatric journal so if you\nI'm honey lemon tea I you know works\nwell I I drink it a lot when I'm sick\nand it has vitamin C and other\nanti-inflammatory properties that can be\ngood for you okay I've been drinking tea\ntoo good just doing everything I can to\nget very good so and what am i what am i\ncalling you\ni I really Lily okay so hi I'm Alec or\nnice to meet you so can you help me\nunderstand a little bit about what we're\ntalking about today\nsure um I don't understand myself\nI thought we were talking about feelings\nor something okay\nyou don't understand yourself that's\nthat's a great topic you do not\nunderstand your feelings is also a great\ntopic ooh\nsometimes people have a particular thing\nthat they like to talk about or focus on\nso I was just curious if that's the case\nwith you I'm not sure okay\nthat's that's so can you tell me a\nlittle bit\nabout hmm do you I'm just curious about\nif I should just ask you about sleep and\nwe can kind of get through things get to\nthinking that well so how long have you\nhad trouble sleeping like two months\nwhat's been going on over the last\ncouple of months um I broke up with my\nboyfriend hold on one sec oh okay sorry\n[ __ ] hello hi okay she's kind of loud\nokay thank you all right fine\nso my mods try to sometimes get my\nattention when I'm talking to people but\nI'm so absorbed in the person that I'm\ntalking to that that I've given them\npermission to call my cell phone and\nthey were saying that you're too loud is\nshe better now\nhello testing okay okay okay okay all\nright so you were saying two months ago\nyou broke up with your boyfriend yeah\nyeah then you haven't been able to sleep\nsince then I'm not well cuz I guess\nwe're just kidding he he cheated on me\nso [ __ ]\nyeah it was super super hard I'm sorry\never since then uh yes Lee thing's\nreally hard what happens when you try to\nsleep\num so usually sorry Hilda\nso um let's pause for a second what are\nyou feeling\nhey what are you apologizing for I can't\ncontrol in that where do you get the\npresumption that you have to control\nbeing sad where does that come from okay\num okay yeah just nothing is a bad habit\nI'm trying to break that okay so I want\nto point something out so if you're\napologizing for nothing is a bad habit\nand you're trying to break that are you\njudging yourself for apologizing too\nmuch yeah yeah right so so that's\nsomething that we're gonna keep an eye\non because I think that something about\nwe're just gonna put a pin in that we'll\ncome back to that I'm sure how does it\ndo you do you feel like you're not\nallowed to be sad well I stream feeling\nangry um so uh I don't like like I don't\nwant to seem like I'm throwing like a\npity party I guess cuz um like I don't\nwant to appear like I'm not strong but I\ndon't think you know yeah so the topic\nfigure yeah so do you think that okay so\nthis is great\nI'm glad we're talking about this what\ndo you think so if you are sad on stream\nwhat is that how do you understand the\nimpact of that is that like a good thing\nor is it a bad thing are you\ndisappointing people I think sometimes I\nrely too much on like sadness or\ndepression or stuff like that I joke\nabout it a lot because that's I think a\nlot of my I do a lot of stuff defecating\ncamera and stuff like that I'm trying to\nnot because I don't want to be seen it's\nlike I don't want that to just be me\nright does that make sense\nyeah so let's understand something very\nsubtle that you said I don't want to be\nseen as and I don't want that to be me\nyeah those are two very different things\nokay does that make sense or no yeah\nyeah so I I I agree so I think this is\nwhat I've already noticed with streamers\nis that the person it gets confusing\nlike who you are because you don't want\nto be seen a certain way and you don't\nwant to be a certain way but the way\nthat you're perceived in the person that\nyou are are like fundamentally different\nthings but I think a lot of times people\nget into trouble because they start can\nlike those two things become blended\nokay so that makes sense so what are you\ncan it comes to being sad why do you\napologize for feeling sad let's not\njudge it let's not say it's bad because\nI don't necessarily think it's bad let's\ntry to understand why you're doing that\nand where that's coming from I guess I\nfeel bad that I fall back on like\ndepression humor and joking about it\nlike too much like every time I turn on\nmy stream and I talk about my feelings\nor whatever it always comes back to like\ndepression or sadness or something like\nthat and I don't like that I guess what\ndon't you like about that I feel like I\nshould be more positive what I don't\nlike people watch me to feel sadder\nokay so let's great so let's explore\nthat for a second if you talk about\nsadness how do you think other people\nfeel who are watching um sometimes they\nsay like it's cool that I talk about\nsadness because they can relate but\nother times I get the feeling that all\nLily's talking about depression again\nyou know you get that feeling hmm\nright so let's let's title down into\nwhat you said again because I think this\nis important sometimes people say that\nit resonates with them and it helps them\nrule\nand other times you get the feeling that\nOh Lilly's talking about sadness again\nyeah do people say Oh Lilly's talking\nabout sadness again um very rarely yeah\nso how do you understand that I guess I\ntake it too seriously it's not I don't\nthink I think that's like a very\nminority yeah most people find it\nrelatable but yeah I yeah I guess I\nworry that I talk about it too much\nanyway I don't know if that's good or\nnot yeah so let's take a step back from\nwhat's good and what's not good because\nin my experience judgment doesn't help\nus so much I think let's start with\nunderstanding and then we can sort of\ndecide from a clearer mindset like what\nwe want to do and what we don't want to\ndo like what we want to cultivate and\nwhat we don't but I'm already noticing\nthat if you're concerned about something\nhow do you think that shapes your\nperception of whether that thing is\nhappening or not if I'm worried about\nsomething I feel like it becomes a\nreality even if it's not real absolutely\nabsolutely that's exactly what it does\nright so if I'm concerned that my hair\nis look silly\nand then I'm walking down the street and\nsomeone looks in my direction I just\nautomatically assumed that they're\nlooking at my hair because it's silly\neven though it's a street and they're\njust gonna be people looking in my\ndirection right so you're absolutely\ncorrect that sometimes if we are\nconcerned about something we feel like\nwe get information to reinforce it yeah\nlet it get to my head too much yeah\nso that - but that's normal right so I\nI'm noticing subtle amounts of judgement\nwhen you say I let it get to my head too\nmuch that implies that you should do you\nshould there's another side to that\nstatement which is that you should let\nit get to your head less do you see that\nyeah and so these statements the self\nself-critical statements are like\nthey're very reflexive for you yeah they\nare they've always done this and I wish\nI didn't but it's it just slips out I\nyeah yeah yeah so so that that's a\npattern of the mind and it's unfortunate\nthat you do that in the sense that it\ncauses you suffering but I do think that\nwe can try to understand like where you\nlearned how to do that and hopefully\nteach you a different way to like think\nabout yourself um but let me just kind\nof go back to this the streaming thing\nbecause I think so I'm gonna just think\nfor a second is that okay oh I'm just\nI'm just trying to make a mental list of\nlike stuff to think about and not lose\ntrack of\nokay so I'm gonna go back to the\nstatement that you made that you're you\nsometimes you feel like you talk about\nit too much\nhmm so in the context of what we're\ntalking about now this is kind of a\nweird abstract read my mind question but\nwhat do you think about that what do you\nthink you actually talk about depression\ntoo much I genuinely think sometimes I\ndo fall back on it too much because well\nwhen you stream like every day for\nexemplary there's only so many things\nyou can talk about yourself like stream\nknows a lot of things about me already\nright and I guess I kind of habit I just\ntalk about depression because I was such\na big part of my life and and if you if\nyou talk about it too much like what is\nthat how do you know what's too much I\nguess it's just my own personal way of\nquantifying it like oh I talked about\nthis last team and the last dream I\nshouldn't talk about this dream I like\nmade a joke about it again\noops yeah so why do you think people\ncome back to your stream like do you\nthink people are looking for like it in\ngeneral when you're watching something\non Twitch how do you decide who to watch\nI don't know why people watch it do you\nhave do you have a yeah but do you watch\npeople on Twitch I'm making assumption\nthat's me\nI watch my friends a lot okay so and\nlet's talk about restaurants actually so\nwhen you're going to a restaurant why do\npeople like do you go to like you have\nsome favorite restaurants in the area\nyes okay so like what are some of your\nfavorite restaurants there's this really\nnice Thai place and has really nice\ntasty and it's walking distance oh wait\nyou mean that you go to the Thai\nrestaurant again and again for Thai iced\ntea yeah you don't go for something\ndifferent every time um sometimes I do\nsometimes I feel like I'll explore the\nmenu a little but mostly because it's\nwalking distance and it's good and it's\ncheap and yeah yeah sort of consistently\nyou go there for consistency right yes\nso in general like when I watch things\nlike I know I tend to watch things like\nso when I I I mean I I like dota okay\nand I know you sometimes play League of\nLegends right\ndo you like League of Legends less so\nbut I know that that's gonna catch if\nyou play League of Legends I don't play\nLeague of Legends oh you don't think of\nLegends yeah I'm sorry No um but you\nknow I I probably should because most of\nthe people that I know play League of\nLegends so I may install so but when I\nwhen I went for example like when I\nwatch like when I go to like the dota\nstreamers like I'm not going to the dota\nstreamers to watch football hmm or\ncooking I'm going to them to watch dota\nand why do you think I mean you sort of\ntalk about so you're you talk about\ndepression a fair amount on stream\nmm-hmm you think you talk about it too\nmuch but what I'm guessing is that based\non what you've told me like it sounds\nlike that resonates with people and\nmaybe part of what they like about\nstream is that you can play League of\nLegends and you probably have some fun\nother content that you do and sometimes\nyou talk about depression hmm and that\nthe people who probably feel a little\nbit sad and lonely and are somehow\ninspired by some of the work that you do\nlike to see that you're like a complex\nhuman being who has a full range of\nfeelings because it sort of allows them\nto have a full range of feelings what do\nyou think about that painting a\nwholesome like when you see it like that\nso when when you say paints it in a very\nwholesome life I'm wondering I'm\nwondering is that is there a part of you\nthat's sort of like yeah that sounds\ngreat but that's not really how it is\nit's like I want to believe that good\nright but you don't 60 percent believe\nit yeah yeah so that's what I'm saying\nis that is that there's a there's a\nthere's an undercurrent of a but which\nis perfectly fine so let's just notice\nthat right which is that I'm painting it\nin a rosy light but that there's like\nsomething else that's like there's a\nthat's kind of like [ __ ] yeah okay\nso good yeah what a sight you said\nalways cyanea yeah that's good I I live\non yeah so our goal here is to\nunderstand the different voices in your\nhead right so there's a part of you that\nsort of thinks that in theory what I'm\nsaying is fine but that just doesn't\nfeel real to you yeah okay I have days\nwhere I'm like yeah people are watching\nme because they like watching me I'm\ncool like I'm awesome\ndays are I'm like dude you don't deserve\nthese here's how daddies there are days\nand and what kind of person doesn't\ndeserve those viewers can we talk about\nthe person that you are on those days\nsure um okay well I think I got into\nshaming by like complete look really\nlike if you start streaming now I know\nlike the market is like super saturated\nright super hard to get into I was lucky\nto start years ago when it wasn't that\nsaturated I'm lucky enough to have like\nI live in a streamer house that helped\nme a lot um when I got cheated on my\nboyfriend like two months ago that that\ntold drama I gave me like a huge influx\nof viewers so that was like very sudden\nright like I got thousands of views for\nsome reason um\nso sometimes on those days it's like am\ni doing enough to deserve this success\nand I I think that makes a\nsensed have you I'm gonna think for a\nsecond is that okay yeah thanks for\nthere somebody just gifted a bunch of\nsubs\nBongiorno thanks for the gifted subs oh\nand thanks for the rate the other day I\ndidn't realize but thank you\noh yeah you're welcome\nokay so you sometimes have self-critical\nthoughts about about yourself right like\nyou sort of say that I don't deserve so\nlet me ask actually ask you this is it\nthat you don't know what you've done to\ndeserve this\nand you're pleasantly surprised or is\nthere a part of you that feels like\nactually you don't deserve this I'm like\npleasantly surprised like okay I feel so\nlucky sometimes that's just really hard\nto take in like wow what did I do to\ndeserve you\nyeah so okay very good so why is it hard\nto take in\n[Music]\nemotional what are you calling when I\nask that question what are you feeling\nyou\nyou\nyou\n[Music]\nyou\nyou\nyou\nI feel anything bad yeah just take a\nminute let's just feel what you're\nfeeling close your eyes for a second\ntell me what you're feeling physically\nin your body thank you\nwhat does that mean\nI feel frustrated I try to talk and\ncan't tell you if I cry I'm trying not\nto cry it's very frustrating\nyeah so let's let's try not to talk\nbecause let's just talk about this for a\nsecond okay you're coming on here with\nthe expectation that you're supposed to\ntalk yeah yeah that's not what you're\nhere for\nbecause you talking is for who I don't\nthink so because because if I mean I\nthink I think you talking is probably\nmore for the viewers right oh yes yeah\nso let's not worry about them because I\ntry my best I mean I I mean no offense\nto anyone who's watching but like I\nthink that the this is really just about\nme in here this is a conversation\nbetween two people that thousands of\npeople people happen to be watching but\nlet's not try to do something for them\nlet's just try to do something for you\nand if that means periods of awkward\nsilence then periods of awkward silence\nokay because I think what is actually\ngoing to benefit them the most is if you\ninstead of trying to push down your\nfeelings and talk to give a performance\nyou just give yourself the time and\nspace to feel what you feel you\nunderstand what you feel and then I\nthink that's what helps people so you\nknow and we'll get back to the sadness\nbecause I can see it's going away a\nlittle bit yeah yeah it is going away\nyeah sorry sometimes yeah good good okay\nokay how what's that about\ncrying yeah like what do you mean I cry\na lot\nI just feel like therapeutic sometimes\njust crying letting it out like I just\nwant to let it out yeah do you feel\nbetter afterward I do I think yeah did\nyou cry on stream oh I try not to okay\nokay so I think the most recent batch of\ncrying happened when I asked you why\nit's hard for you to that feeling lucky\nis like like it's hard for you right so\nfeeling like people actually care about\nyou and that you're lucky and that you\nknow you're successful like it seems to\nbe that it feels kind of it's hard for\nyou why do you think that is how do you\nunderstand that\num can I think it ties into the whole\nlike uh because I got the influx of you\nis right from the drama thing whatever\nthat and I just wonder what I'm doing\nreally like yeah I turn on my stream I\ndo my thing you know like I talked my\nfeelings or you draw or like play music\nor whatever right but sometimes I do it\nand I'm just like it's just like\nentertaining like is this fun to watch\nit I why and I don't I don't think I'm\nlike special yeah okay so I think what\nI'm hearing from you is you don't\ndeserve what the world is giving you and\nthen some things people say like oh you\nonly have yours cuz you're a girl or\nlike you have a cute voice are you\nfaking your voice or whatever that help\ndo you say about me um or like it's just\nbecause if your roommate story more\npopular than you or and how does that\nsit with you ah doesn't make me feel\ngood because I'd want people to watch me\nbecause uh just because of Mary yeah but\nyeah I'd awful things like there's like\na bunch of people out there who are you\nknow talent\nwhat more talented more pretty prettier\nfor entertaining so sometimes a and I'm\nso worried about like relevancy to in\nwhich she me is super important you\ncould be a nobody in a month right and\nthis is my job okay so I'm hearing a lot\nof different things I'm gonna try to try\nto go through these like one at a time\nso the first is that there's a part of\nme that feels like you don't feel like\nyou deserve success that's why you use\nthe word luck right like like if we\nthink about why people invoke luck it's\nbecause like luck is on one end of the\nspectrum in like something that you\ndeserve or worked for or earned like\nearned and locker on two opposite ends\nof the spectrum right and there may be\nluck involved I don't know but but the\nfirst thing that I understand when you\nsay that you kind of feel lucky so\nthere's a there's a difference between\nfeeling privileged and grateful that\npeople are interested in you and\nsupporting you and things like that and\nI get the sense that you definitely feel\nthat way and there's also like another\nfeeling that can happen which is like\nwhat's sort of wrong with these people\nand why are they interested in you\nbecause there are people who are as you\nput it prettier and what my talented\nyeah they're better than you right so\nthat implies to me that somewhere along\nthe way you feel like you don't you got\nthe idea or there's a part of you that\nbelieves that you don't deserve to be\nsuccessful\nand so my question for you and then\nthere's the haters which we'll get to in\na second but my question to you is like\nhow long have you felt like you don't\ndeserve to be happy or successful um I\nfeel like it's like since I started\nalmost because I got into this job by\nluck you know when you first start off I\nthink a lot of things are kind of I love\nhina you kind of stumble upon it oh all\nof a sudden it's my my job I can do this\nand I used to be super inconsistent even\nmore so than now I used to literally\njust not get out of bed and maybe stream\nlike once a month if my fans are lucky\num I use a super low effort super super\nand like for some reason they still\ndance who would still watch me right so\nluckily I got into this streamer house\nthat helped motivate me to work more and\nbecome more consistent stream yeah I\nguess and also that again I keep\nbringing this up it was a huge thing\nwhere I got my good pooped on my furious\nright all of a sudden almost overnight\nand then I mean you think like oh what\ncan I do - like deserve these views how\ncan I make them stay how can I me how\ncan I feel like I'm like be happiest\nthis type of streamer I guess okay can\nyou help me understand what what\nhappened I mean you you because you you\ndo keep coming back to this so you got\nan influx of viewers because you got\ncheated on by your boyfriend yeah in a\nvery public manner\nit was super public even my parents\nheard about it it was like there are\narticles it was just [ __ ] ton sorry I'm\na little crazy yeah I think so like just\nokay tons of videos about it\num threads people messaging me like it\nwas overwhelming me so I'm new to twitch\nso can you help me understand why your\nboyfriend on cheating on you\nwe were a very public couple so you guys\nare like you're like a celebrity right I\nmean I don't like the word either but\nfrom the Boomer world where I come from\nyeah yeah okay fine like pseudos live\nit's not right so like I've never heard\nI mean so I have you know I know people\nin my life who sometimes deal with\ninfidelity and I've never heard about\nanyone writing articles about it okay\nyeah okay so yeah there were some\narticles there yeah it's because they\nwere a very public couple I involved him\nin a lot of my content actually like\neverything good\nI dream we did music together we\ncollapse together like I'm a super\nserious about because when I when it\ncomes to relationships I'm very like if\nI choose someone I'm hard committing I\nsee you myself with you for the rest of\nmy life so yeah we were together for two\nyears or so and I found out when I was\nin Japan and another country um with him\nwith all of my friends I mean I didn't\nwant it to blow up but\nsorry they'll feel bad about that\nlike if there's one thing I could change\nit would be I would try to make it more\nprivate break nicely instead like\neveryone knows about it and I felt bad\nbecause he also got like a lot of hate\nanyone scissors\neven if\never since then that's where the trouble\nsleeping comes from I think from then I\nhaven't been able to really sleep I've\nbeen trained to distract myself um let\ndistract yourself from what and how do\nyou feel sad what does that mean sad I'm\nsad because I wish it didn't happen I\nwish the entire Internet I wish things\ncould just go back to normal\nhow do I know it's never gonna be like\nthat again um I've been trying to ya\ndistract myself just try them on you\nknow I feel sometimes feel like just\nkind of weak I guess I feel like I\nshould be over it I know okay Lily\nI don't think sad is the best word to\ndescribe what you're going through I\nthink what you need to do to move on so\nfirst of all you know I know that you\nblame yourself for not being good enough\nand that's a thing so I'd like to talk\nyou know at some point maybe we can talk\nabout that maybe not today actually\nbecause I'm getting the sense that maybe\nunderstand\nis actually even a little bit premature\njust just with where you are and I think\nthe first thing that I'd like to share\nwith you is that I think what you need\nto do is grieve I don't know if you've\never thought about it like this\nI tried craving um I know it's bad but I\ndrank a lot just crying letting it all\nout I and I think like there are days\nwhere I'm like okay I'm good um I can do\nthis but then I get these where it's\nlate\n[ __ ] it this hurts\nyeah so I don't think drinking is\ngriefing oh it's not like open district\nI know it's bad yeah I know yeah so so\nlet's just think about grief so like\nwhat are the things that you do when you\ngrieve for someone if you have you like\nis someone that you care about passed\naway you have to be a person so so if we\nthink about like when someone can we is\nit okay if we talk about that for a\nsecond okay because because what I'm\nhearing from you is that you'd like to\nmove on from this right and in in a\nsense I think you're doing a good job\nbecause there are days that you're able\nto like kind of fully function it sounds\nlike you're able to find joy and\nhappiness and pleasure in life and then\nthere are days where this thing kind of\nlike rears its ugly head yeah and\nunfortunately that's how grief works so\ngrief doesn't it's not like you beat a\nlevel it's like it's like you know once\nyou beat a level like you randomly go\nback to that level when grief decides\nthat we're gonna go back to that place\nbut I wonder if there's also some ways\nin which we can help you move on I mean\nI even want to say like faster sounds\nlike the wrong sentiment but for us to\nunderstand what you're going through and\nif there's some way that like if we can\nunderstand what you're going through\nmaybe we can make the process easier or\nless bumpy for you and my first thought\nis like when you think about someone\nthat you lost do you think that you've\ngrieved for that person or animal\nappropriately like you feel like you've\nyou're you're in a good place with that\noh all I do is just cry is that good\nyeah sure but I mean do you still feel\ndo you still cry about the person that\nyou lost I do I do\ndoes it feel like does it feel bad when\nyou try again cathartic yeah so that's\nthat's important right so like II there\nare two kinds of crying there's the\ncrying that sort of feels good at the\nend of it and then there's the crying\nthat sort of can also sort of feel good\ntemporarily but isn't quite cathartic\nand doesn't lead to less\nthere are two kinds of crime there's the\ncathartic crying which over time leads\nto less crying and processing of\nfeelings and then there's the crying\nthat sort of just is experiencing\nawfulness that doesn't necessarily\ndecrease the amount of awfulness down\nthe road you with me yes and what what\nare we calling your boyfriend what\nshould I you can it should I just say\nyour boyfriend or do you want to use a\nname okay so when it comes to Albert you\nknow when you cry about that which way\ndoes it feel that I lost it I want it\nback but I can't like just a loss I\nguess yeah so and this is gonna be kind\nof weird but do you feel confident that\nyou can find being a good committed\nhealthy relationship again I don't know\nif I want to commit and that idea is\nlike it's really scary no I guess cuz\nyeah I put everything into this and he\ndid that so what's to say that's not\ngonna happen again or it just feels very\nscary like the idea of committing\nyourself to one person no yeah\nabsolutely I think it I mean I imagine\nif I were in your shoes I would be\nterrified of it not only that because\nlike I hope where I'm just just really\nbeing open with my viewers as well I\ntell them a lot of things so if I were\nin a relationship right I'd want to\nshare it I want them to be part of my\nlife but last time that Boston Public\nit was so yeah probably became self I\ncan be so messy and like I totally like\ndeal with that every can you know scary\nyeah so I'm noticing attention within\nyou and sort of like even if you had\nanother relationship do you sort of stay\ntrue to kind of the unspoken promise\nyour fans which is that they get to see\nthe inside of your life and thereby open\nyourself up to you know the pain of a\nvery public and you know commented on\nbreak up where apparently he also got a\nlot of hate or do you change the the way\nthat you interact with your fans which\nsounds like it's probably compromising\nor sacrificing something I don't know\nyeah because it feels bad hiding such a\nbig part of my life\nI like having if I had a significant\nother I'd want them to be you know part\nof what I do like I went to club with\nthem I want to spend time with them I\nwant to work with that I wanna I want to\ndo things with them solely its we like\nyour relationship with its Albert with\nAlbert was pretty perfect it seemed like\nI thought I thought I'd marry I thought\nit was like you know he was great I\nreally really loved him like he yeah we\nlost somewhere in trees we we played\nmusic together we we got along really\nwell I had no idea that he was an apple\nsee um how do you know he wasn't happy\ncuz he we talked after words he he told\nme the reasons why cuz I'm gonna to know\nand yeah and I felt bad cuz he bottled a\nlot of things into um I wish he total\nbut he didn't and that just manifested\nin this really ugly manner and just felt\nbad there's really bad what does that\nmean bad that he couldn't tell me they\ncouldn't communicate with me like I\nwould have done anything to fix whatever\nit really\nbut he told someone else like I know\nyou're not supposed to compare yourself\nbut hey I'm like what did they have that\nI didn't mmm and I thought I was a good\ngirlfriend but I just yeah Lily there's\nsomething very subtle in in honestly\ndangerous that you're doing I think\nyou're accepting a lot of responsibility\nfor things that are not your\nresponsibility so like I'll just put it\nto you bluntly like there's something\nthat really makes me angry at the\nthought that someone feels like this\nthat if a relationship didn't work out\nand I hear you say that I mean I have no\nidea what kind of girlfriend you are or\nwhat kind of boyfriend Albert is or so I\ncan't judge this but I hear this thread\nconsistently in what you're saying that\nyou kind of say I like you weren't good\nenough of a girlfriend whereas like I\ndon't know if that's true right like I'm\nhearing this theme of like I wasn't like\nif if he had told me I could have done\nsomething about it\nand you feel like that sort of a\ndeficiency on your part that he wasn't\nwith me meals too clingy I don't know\nmaybe yeah right so so so just notice\nwhat you're doing there is like you're\naccepting responsibility for like\neverything that happens around you right\nthat if you had been better he would\nhave been able to be more open if you\nhad been a more better girlfriend and\nless clingy like he would have stayed if\nyou had been more entertaining or more\ntalented or more attractive you would\nhave gotten these viewers without drama\nyeah do you see that thread so like I\nthink we've got it and I'm struggling\nI'm really struggling here because\nthere's a part of me that says that\nyou're hurting right now and there is\nsomething that is really at the top of\nmind for you which is this relationship\nand how you're kind of thinking about\nyourself but there's another part of me\nthat says that all of this stuff comes\nfrom like one common place because it's\nlike the same thing which is that like\nLily sometimes isn't good enough and I'd\nlike to understand I mean I I'm torn so\nmaybe you can help me out like what do\nyou think we should talk about should we\naren't try to understand where that\ncomes from\nor should we talk about Albert and sleep\nand how you feel in the process of\ngrieving I don't know okay well that\nmakes two of us maybe the first one done\nokay so I can you I'm gonna quaint us\nokay what are your choice like II just\num I mean so so that the choices are\nlike do you want to talk about the last\ntwo months and sleeping and grieving and\nrelationships how do you want to talk\nabout where you got the idea that you're\nnot good enough maybe not good enough\nfun okay that seems more yeah what\nhappened to your indecisiveness make a\ndecision I feel bad stalling okay I\ncould live with that so he asked you how\nlong have you so you know when you feel\nlike you don't deserve success let's say\nand I know that you don't always feel\nthat way right so this is something that\nno it's almost exactly so so like let's\njust\nfirst appreciate that it's almost like\nsomething there's like a dormant Lily\nthere's like the Lily who doesn't think\nthat she's like good enough can we like\nconceptualize her that way okay and then\nsometimes like is there some way that\nyou can think of that we can kind of put\na name to her Lily - Lily - okay and so\nis there some way that\nsohow and Lily - like sometimes wakes up\nin your mind right there are days that\nyou something is happening like some\ndays you get out of bed and it's like\nLily - who's running the show and you're\nself-critical in your self judgmental\nand there are other days where it's like\nregular Lily is running the show and\nhere you can feel grateful what yeah I\nlike that yeah feeling like that I wish\nI could feel like that every day we're\ngonna get there okay I mean maybe not at\nthe end of the hour but we're gonna get\nthere so and then there's a certain I\nthere's certain things that like even if\nLily one is regular lily is waking up\nand is living your day something can\nhappen at 3:00 p.m. where the lily -\nsort of takes over rightly some kind of\ninteraction yeah or someone says\nsomething to you yes right so Lily - is\nlike a part of you that wakes up or goes\nto sleep yeah yeah and and so the\nsolution that we have is oddly enough\nnot executing Lily - and dumping her in\nthe river\nwhat steel Apple I know you would but\nthat's not how it works and that's what\nhappens every time you know you drink to\nexcess or whatever like that's what\ndistraction and coping is its pushing\nLily to away what we actually need to do\nis like like let's act let's just think\nfor a second how does Lily to feel to\nfeel yeah dread okay\ndread about what every\nyeah so dread I think of his fear so\nLily too is afraid of certain things\nhappening what is she afraid of\neverything like aa career yep and what\nis the fear about her career streaming\nis seems volatile yep scary yep I want\nto do other things\nI have other dreams then I don't know if\nI can fulfill them trying my best\nthis doesn't sound like Lily - to me\nsorry this is only 1 or 2 it 3 you know\nwe're talking about Lily - so-so\nand that's okay so let me just try to\navenge or something right so I would be\nI would imagine that if Lily 2 is waking\nup which is sort of like the sad\ndepressed Lily - isn't good enough it's\nthat she won't be able to cut it\nstreaming that one day she's gonna wake\nup and what she's afraid of is that\npeople are gonna realize that she\ndoesn't deserve the success that she's\ngetting and that they're gonna kind of\nsee you for who you are and they're\ngonna move on to someone else\nyeah is that a fear of Lily - is that\naccurate that's the fear okay okay so\nwhat do you think that person needs if\nyour friend was like let's say like you\nsay you live in a house full of\nstreamers right so if one of your\nfriends says like voices those fears to\nyou uh-huh\nwhat do you do for her or him I tell her\nreassure them that they are good enough\nbut they they're they are good they're\ngreat they got here for a reason\nyeah like you to support them okay and\nhow does that work for your friend um\nthey would appreciate it yeah and so\nwhat do you say - Lily - is that what\nyou say - - Lily - I try sometimes good\nthat's impressive\nthat that's really good how does that\nwork um sometimes it works you know like\nI tell myself like yeah you're good\nenough you can do this like people like\nyou you're you're great you know you're\ngood and that's great and the diesel\nworks it's great and on the days that it\ndoesn't it doesn't work it's just like\nah [ __ ] everything I'm going back to bed\nyeah so so like I just wanted to point\nthat out to you for a second because\nwhat you're doing - Lily - when you say\nactually you are good enough and and you\nhave worked hard and from what I hear\nfrom you I think you are I mean who\ndeserves success is sort of a separate\nissue but I hear a lot about what you've\nworked hard to do and I mean I think\nyou're deserving of your success for the\nsimple reason that you were telling me\nthat you used to be consistent and then\nit sounds like you made a lot of large\nscale changes to your life and you put\nforth a lot of effort into like actually\nyou know doing a good job and that in\nspite of actually a lot of internal\ndemons that you struggle with you still\nmanaged stream somewhat consistently and\nthings like that which i think is really\namazing and also that doesn't so there's\nsome days where that wins but but there\nare other days where it loses and I just\nwant to point out that that's not\nactually like shooting Lily - and\ndumping her in the river right $0.07\nlike there's a part of you that wants to\ndump her in the river and I suspect that\nthat's part of the reason why this is so\nhard for you to shake because I actually\nthink that you know there's there's like\na fight between like Lily one and Lily -\nbut what you described is not a fight\nbetween Lily one and Lily - its Lily one\ndoing what for Lily -\ngetting rid of her know what no right so\nwhen you tell yourself what do you tell\nyourself when sometimes you're feeling\ndown oh um yeah you're good enough is\nthat getting rid of her\nno it's not um try to\nsupporter yeah absolutely that's the\nvery opposite of getting rid of her yeah\nsorry yeah yeah so so I think it's it's\nit's a normal it's something that's very\nconfusing and Lily I think you're\nactually one step ahead of the game\nbecause most people when they when they\nhave a part of themselves that feels\nlike they're\nyou know very self-critical self\njudgmental where you feel like you're\nnot good enough you want to get rid of\nthem right like when I asked you like\nyou want to dump them in the river you\nlike hell yes I want to be happy for the\nrest of my life what what what I think\nyou actually need to do which I'm really\nhappy to hear that you're able to do\nthis for yourself is actually like like\nactually I'm not gonna say that I'm\ngonna ask you a few more questions right\nso let's let's think about where the\nlily 2 comes from so how long have you\nlike when like do you remember feeling\nthat way like in the past yeah but how\nlong has Lily 2 and let's just be clear\nso who is Lily - the past one the [ __ ]\nJohn yep and and more specifically what\ndo we mean by depressed and sad scared\nok scared I think\ndo you so I would say that what I'm\nhearing from you is that like Lily -\nisn't good enough\noh yeah that that that - so it sounds\nlike there's more to it no I mean if\nthere is that's fine so let's just try\nto understand so like when you're\nfeeling sad and depressed when it comes\nto thinking about Albert is there a part\nof you that feels like you know there's\na part of you that's sad because you had\nsomething beautiful and now it's gone\nand there's also this part of you that\ncreates these thoughts like oh if I had\ndone this then he would have stayed if I\nhad been better at listening if I had\nbeen less clingy then that could have\nworked out sometimes right it's\nyou\nokay so when you say sometimes are there\nhow can I put this I think there's a\nhealthy sadness and there's an unhealthy\nsadness within you and that I think the\nhealthy sadness is just you know kind of\nthe normal sadness and sometimes that\ncan be cathartic as you put it but then\nthere's an unhealthy sadness where you\nthink certain thoughts about yourself\nand how the relationship made you feel\nthat's not quite the same as like\nfearing relationships in the future and\nstuff because that's kind of a different\nthing but I do think there's like\nactually more than just two lilies\nthere's like lilies three and there's\nLily four but right there are a lot of\nlilies and and what I'd like to focus on\nis the one who leads you to thoughts\nlike you were too clingy or if you had\nbeen better he would have talked to you\nor things like that\ndoes that make sense we're gonna focus\non her so how long have you felt like\nyou're kind of undeserving of success or\nthat you're kind of not good enough okay\nI don't know if I can pinpoint it but it\nokay feels like it's been like just\nthere all my life right okay do you have\nany memories of like things that\nhappened when you were young that sort\nof made you feel that way yeah so I\nremember when I was younger my parents\nvery very traditional Korean they\nwouldn't mean a coda like good college\nand stuff right um I got depression in\nhigh school and that made me feel like\nnot good enough and I ended up almost\nfailing and went to Community College\nand then I had no idea what to do with\nmy life I have nothing to offer really\nso I stumble upon YouTube and streaming\njust by chance I started like you know\ncute little videos but voice acting and\nlike art and stuff like that people ate\nit so I started doing that\num but even throughout all that I wasn't\nconsistent I thought everything I made\nwas like whatever but it gave me\nsomething to do so I continued what do\nyou mean by got depressed in high school\noh I used to fight a lot with my parents\nI was very suicidal very very depressed\num it took my mom some time to realize\nhow serious it was she didn't believe me\nat first uh and then I just felt like\nreally a failure I guess in high school\nbecause I would not go I would not get\nout of bed I would refuse to go to\nschool I almost missed the minimal\nattendance think so I almost failed and\nI remember I was talking with the\ncounselor and she was like yeah your GPA\nis like 2 point 1 point z naught I don't\ngive a [ __ ] I just did not care I guess\nI don't know but I mean it sounds like\nthe the fighting with your parents is a\nconsequence of your depression not the\norigin of your depression mmm I guess I\ndon't know how the depression started I\nreally okay\ndon't can you tell me about what middle\nschool was like for you middle school\nwas okay actually like up until well\nelementary school\nokay so element is what it was a period\nof time where I had no friends but two\nthree years that was hard and then I got\ninto middle school I moved and I've made\nfriends and I'm like okay I'm happy I\nthought it was generally like a happy\ntime I was doing well in school I had\nfriends I was socializing it was fun I\nwent to high school the first year was\nfine I remember I was like I had a lot\nof hopes I want to go to college I want\nto succeed I want to do a lot of things\nand then like 10th grade started\nfighting with my parents a lot I\nretreated into the internet forums and\nstuff what would you fight with your\nparents about just remember it's like\nthey would be really angry at me for\n[Music]\nlike just not going to school not\ngetting the dates or\njust being really useless in general\nlike I literally did not do anything I\njust stayed in bed all day and I was\nplaying a lot of video games at the time\nthey hated that they hated me going on\nthe computer so much that they hid\nbehind I used to hide the mouse in the\nkeyboard in the basement and when they\nwent to work I would bring it up I used\nto put a lot of like MMORPGs a lot of\nthem I thought was like my escape\nMMORPGs which ones yeah I used to play\nback knock online a lot mmm I connect\nonline that was maplestory just every\nlike mo more appreciate around that time\nlike I just I played them all I tried\nthem all it was really fun and they got\ninto like I'd meet friends on the\ninternet so I'm like no I don't need\nfriends really yeah how did it feel when\nyour parents were angry with you I felt\nreally bad like I was disappointing them\nand they would like we wanted these\nfights were really really bad like there\nwere parts where she would she would\nthreaten to call like a psychiatric ward\nand like take me in and stuff and like\nshe told me once I remember I can't\nforget this like I was 15 years old she\nwas dropping me off at high school I\nthink I'm yeah high school of course and\nand we had a fight in the car and she\nshe told me like she wished I was never\nborn\nso that stuck with me for going my\nrelationship with my parents are great\nby the way right now\nit's like wonderful but back then it was\njust so bad oh and then she won't feel\nlike um compare me to other treaties so\neasy I know and I'm like and I'm just\nlike yeah whatever mom and I'll go back\nto my MMORPG yeah yeah very even mm-hmm\nthey feel so many comments about my\nweight too so I always felt like that\neven though I wasn't that and then yeah\nso how do you how would they how\nthat make you feel and we're not trying\nto bash your parents here okay so I\nthink they just you know I have Asian\nparents too I mean Indian parents but my\ndad when we were young said so I have an\nolder brother and this is the story that\nI would tell during med school\ninterviews so they would ask me why do\nyou want to be a doctor and then I well\nmy dad when we were growing up said one\nof you is gonna be a doctor and one of\nyou is gonna be a lawyer\nand my brother is older than I am so he\ngot to choose first and he got he went\nto law school so here is that's funny\nyeah so you know I I think I think Asian\nand South Asian parents are very similar\nin terms of you know you have a there's\na there's a very specific sense of what\nsuccesses in life and in a sense I come\nto realize it's not their fault it's\njust because that's the formula for them\nright like that's how they got to this\ncountry is by like working hard and and\nnot playing mmo's they did um come\naround eventually obviously right yeah\nand I think they realized how much they\n[ __ ] up with me so like my brother and\nI like to joke he's my younger brother\nI'm like the beta product and he's like\nthe final product my brother had no\nissues like he went to like an\nengineering college he's he's great he's\nfine he's super healthy and how are you\noh yeah Lee in the same way that you're\ntalking about your brother oh I I guess\nI found success you know sorry um yeah\nby chance miraculously my mom says it's\na miracle I somehow got here to where I\nam and yeah still very like Wow to me so\nyeah I didn't know what its gonna do\nfirst of all sure\ndo you I'm still okay I'm gonna need a\nsecond I'm just trying to understand so\nI'm gonna say something and maybe this\nis not gonna be fair but I'm just\ncurious whether twitch chat is as\nconfused as I am oh right like are you\nguys confused or does this make sense to\nyou they say something wrong no no you\ndidn't say anything wrong it's just it\nblows my mind that and it's hard because\nI I think I think that I'm just gonna\nthink for a second\nokay so I was about to say it blows my\nmind that you're not able to see that\nyou have value I'm gonna steer clear\nthis word success but that that you have\nimmense value and that just because you\ndidn't find you didn't follow the road\nthat was scripted doesn't mean that you\ndidn't find your own way and that you\nwere you're deserving of respect because\neven more so than like just going to an\nengineering school like you struggled\nand you found your own path you forged a\nroad like you you built a path that did\nnot exist before that despite all of\nyour difficulties and all of the\nchallenges that you faced including\ndepression including parents who are not\nsupportive back then in spite of all of\nthose things you managed to get to where\nyou are and it blows my mind that you\ncan't see it that way but of course you\ncan't see it that way\nand the question is like well why not\nand then it kind of comes back to I'm\ngonna just keep going normally I would\nstop because you're crying but I'm just\ngonna plow forward is that okay Lily\nokay um maybe I should ask you how you\nfeel but I'm just gonna keep going okay\nso I think this is a cathartic cry\nthat's what I'm gonna guess yeah okay so\nI'm gonna keep going\nso so then the question like for a\nsecond there I was about to say blows my\nmind why you can't see that but then of\ncourse like you've actually already\nanswered that and it comes back to\nsomething that we talked about at the\nbeginning of the interview is when you\nbelieve something about yourself like if\nI believe that my hair is messed up and\nsomeone is walking down the street like\nI'm going to perceive that that person\nis looking at my hair even though that\nis like completely insane and this is\nLilly - Lilly - is the person who keeps\nyou from seeing that you were absolutely\namazing and deserving of love and\nrespect and that you've like forged a\npath for yourself where despite being\nand this is going to be bizarre\nless talented and less attractive\nthousands of people watch you every time\nyou stream\nso rather than being undeserving if\nwe're really being if we're really being\nscientific we have to conclude that you\nhave something else right like if you\nthink about your favorite restaurants\nand the ones that have no no tablecloths\nin crappy service and look like [ __ ]\nand if people keep coming back over and\nover and over why is that Lily\nconsistency of what the service sucks it\nlooks bad they like something about it\nwhat do they like about the restaurant\ncould be anything\nwhat are you okay so like maybe this is\na harder question than I'm thinking in a\nspec so when I think about a restaurant\nI think about like you know food service\nambiance wait times cleanliness and at\nthe end of the day I sometimes go to\nrestaurants that have bad service bad\nambiance and are dirty like a food truck\nbut they're like go for the cute waiter\nyou know even if everything else is they\ncould but why do they go back to that\nrestaurant the food thing absolutely is\nat the end of the day what you put in\nyour mouth and what you're looking for\nyou get right like I said the end of the\nday if people are coming back to a\nrestaurant it's for the [ __ ] food\nokay and that you can make a good\nargument I'm sure you can convince\nyourself of this because your mom taught\nyou from a very young age just like my\nparents did that you can compare\nyourself to other people and then then\nnow I I kind of joke about it that you\nknow I'm every Indian parents dream and\nevery Indian kids worst nightmare\nbecause I'm a harvard-trained physician\nright so you can yeah and you can\nconvince yourself and compare yourself\nbut at the end of the day there's no\ndoubt in my mind that the people are\ncoming to watch you because of you and\nit's not about Talent it's not about\nappearance that you have the secret\nsauce there's something just authentic\nand amazing about the person that you\nare that keeps people coming back\nbecause like I work with a lot of people\nwho are sociopathic I work with a lot of\nexecutives and you can't keep up and act\nthat long there's got to be something\nlegit you just can't do it like you can\nfool the world for like a day a month\neven a year but you've been doing this\nfor years and people keep coming back\nand you're not able to see that because\nyou're not primed to see it and you're\nnot primed to see it because of Lily too\nand when I hear about what your mom did\nlike it sort of makes sense right\nbecause what did your mom what was sort\nof like the TLDR of your the way you\nknow your parents treated you in high\nschool\nwhat did you learn from them\ndisappointment absolutely right\ndisappointment why because what there we\ngo\nright that and we see that that's where\nthe lily 2 is from and I don't I mean I\nI feel like we're get bashing your\nparents I really don't they just did the\nbest that they could and you know I had\nI almost failed out too so with you from\nplaying too many video games not so much\nmmo's more RTS and Diablo but you know\nand III think I I just don't know I mean\nit it it makes me sad to see that you\nknow you've just you've started to think\nabout yourself in a particular way in\nterms of and it's actually like there's\na part of you that side but there's a\npart of me that's kind of happy and this\nis part of what's been confusing for me\nis I think you've actually made a lot of\nprogress because I see Lily too but I\nthink it's amazing that you are able to\nactually see that you do demonstrate\nvalue and that like you aren't\ndisappointed like your fear is that like\nwhen when I asked earlier like what is\nLily to feel you said dread and then I\nasked dread of what and like you didn't\nreally give me an answer but I'd put\nmoney that it's dread of disappointment\nprobably\nso what was it like hearing me say that\nclarity\nbut more clarity cathartic cry yeah well\nlet's go to your Chi that was inside so\nlet me and if you have questions and\nstuff we can we can get to that but\nso let me just start by saying this the\nfirst thing is that\nthe other thing that I think is actually\nreally kind of cool and unfortunate is\nthat I think sometimes you know we\nsuffer and I think that I talk a lot\nabout Dharma which means duty or\nresponsibility and I think you are under\nvaluing your contribution to the world\nbecause you kind of you've been\nprogrammed to think about a contribution\nin a particular way and you sort of say\nlike I talk too much about depression\nmaybe I should talk less about\ndepression but I think what people are\nresonating with is that like a lot of\npeople who are watching on twitch feel\ndisappointed in themselves and feel like\nthe world is disappointed in them right\nmm-hmm like there's a part of me that\nsays that every gamer is a little bit\nbroken like that sometimes right and and\nI think that like that's something that\nwhen you show that part of yourself and\nwhat you've been through like they\nresonate with that and I think that's\nincredibly important for them because\nlike here's the thing you know when you\nwere 15 we haven't talked about this but\nI imagine you felt incredibly incredibly\nalone that you didn't understand what\nwas going on in your life and like the\npeople like no one understood you and\nyou didn't understand why like you tried\nto be a different person you tried so\nhard to be a different person and you\njust could not figure out how to do it\nand you were just busted old you and\nlike there's something really powerful\nabout people who are feeling that way\nbeing able to watch you struggle and say\nlike oh wow like she's busted lily and\nI'm busted me and she manages to do it\nso I shouldn't give up and I think if\nwe're talking about like contributions\nto the world like that's [ __ ] amazing\nman so don't stop what you're doing and\nthey deserve like you deserve every\nounce of it not only do you deserve it\nbut they need you Lily it's not even\nabout you it's about like what you're\ndoing for that you make it sound very\ncool\nand there it is again right there's the\npart of you that hesitates to believe I\nuse like 60% police Hey yeah so that's\nprogress that's that's what makes my\nlife hard because I think you've\nactually done a lot of I know you've\ndone a lot of good work in terms of\nunderstanding your 60% there and for\nthat last 40% this is kind of what I'll\nleave you with is that you know that\nperson needs your compassion so that's\nlike 15 year old Lily who just got\nyelled at and told that you know by her\nmom that I wish you were never born and\nshe needs you she needs the strong\nversion of you she needs the person that\nyou've actually become the person who's\nsuccessful who can look back on her life\nand say like because this is something\nthat I think you can do and I imagine\nyou do you know that like even if you're\nlost and you feel hopeless like and you\nwent to Community College like you can\nfind you can find a life where you can\nbe you know you can have joy and\nhappiness and travel the world and like\nthere's a road for you like life isn't\nover and so 15 year old Lily needs how\nold are you now 20 needs 28 year old\nlike you need to be your own older\nsister and there's there forty percent\nof you still skeptical that's fine I\nmean 600 sure okay thoughts questions no\nlike my brain is just blank I'm sorry\nyeah that's okay that's what we're\nshooting for so\nyou don't need to jumpstart it I would\njust I would just sit sit with where you\nare for a minute mm-hmm close your eyes\njust feel no looking no peeking okay\nokay good so do you do you have any\nquestions I mean like thinking of a\nbunch of things right now on Trent\nokay think of what to say I also wanted\nto mention um like my parents are\ndefinitely a big part of why I fear\ndisappointment I also can we talk about\nhate for a second sure yeah I got a lot\nof hate thirty years a lot there are so\nmany moments I wanted to quit because of\nthat because people who don't know me\nmake assumptions about me or talks me or\nsend me letters to my hope mhm\ncall me uh non-stop hate and I think\nit's gotten better dealing with it\nbecause you have to get better dealing\nwith it\nwhen you do this kind of stuff right\nwhen you have like yeah but there's\nstill some days where I read like one\nthing and it's like a spiral\nyeah yes it's hard and that's also I\nthink why I fear giving myself value\nbecause sometimes I'm scared\nif I see myself in a better light or\nlike a valuable light that just means\nlike it gives them more ammo I guess how\ndoes it give them more ammo hmm I've\nbeen told that if they can't [ __ ] on me\nif I [ __ ] on me you know what I mean\nlike you can't insult me if they insult\nmyself yeah so that's very powerful and\npotent you think yeah\ndeprecation yes I do that a lot\nyou\nhow long do you want to talk about this\nLily what do you want to really dive\ninto it or do you wanna do you have\nsomewhere to go you have to go somewhere\nI mean um I need to go for my car in\nabout 25 minutes so I'm just trying to\nunderstand so like if you want to have a\nconversation which i think is very\nproductive I first of all just need to\ntake a little bit of a break because\nthis wears me out a little bit and\nbefore you dive into it no no that's\nit's fine it's just I'm I'm just trying\nto think a little bit about you know if\nyou want a simple answer I can give you\nthat in five to ten minutes but if you\nreally want to dive into hate I think\nthat's fine I'm just gonna like drink\nsome water and and maybe use the\nbathroom and then we can come back\nrefreshed and dive in how does like you\ntell me what do you what you need to do\num yeah okay dive okay so I just need a\nminute\nyes so I'll be back in like five minutes\nokay\nokay okay so you guys talk to Lily okay\noh god okay\n[Music]\nall right thank you um okay so hatred\nlet's dive in or what so tell me so\nyou're saying that people send you hate\nstuff yeah oh wait I need fix naming oh\nyeah\nand you were saying something this is\nbrilliant so you're saying that if you\nyou know if you don't build yourself up\nthey can't tear you down yes right so\nI'm noticing an instinct to try to\nprotect you from some things but okay so\nwell well we'll get to that are you are\nyou up for a little bit more emotion or\nyou feel like you're spent know I love\nemotions curling okay so we'll see what\nhappens but okay so all right so tell me\nyou know how does it so tell me about\nwhy you know why bring this up with me\nnow like what's what's the motive I felt\nlike um the reason why I don't value\nmyself not only comes from you know my\nupbringing my parents but also this too\nand I felt like it wasn't you know\ngenuine if I didn't bring it up as well\nlike it felt like I should I guess I\nshould have so the first thing is that\nthis may not actually come from your\nparents so I think your it coming from\nyour parents is an easy thing but the\nnumber of streamers who I've talked not\njust streamers but people who I talked\nto who sort of say like you know I see\nhow what you said sort of relates but I\ndidn't mention this thing because I\ndidn't feel comfortable talking about it\non streem and oftentimes it comes from\nsomewhere else I just didn't want to\nyeah yeah no no I'm just saying that a\nlot of people will sort of I think it's\nactually great that you're you're\nchoosing to bring it up because a lot of\npeople will like message me privately\nafterwards and say like oh so I think\nit's actually great that you did so how\ndo you think so it's it what I'm getting\nfrom you is that instinctually hatred\nseems to be a part of this equation like\nthat this discussion is not complete\nwithout talking about sort of hatred and\nhow people are venomous towards a lot\nyeah and can you tell me like so what\nare we talking about are we talking\nabout like post streaming career or like\nprior to streaming\num post okay\nduring I guess during yeah um so tell me\na little bit about what what you mean by\nhatred and what happens and what you\nexpect like what you receive and how you\nfeel um okay so first my voice that I\nwant to hate for that Yad no people\nreally did not like it like just a lot\nof hate over it yeah but it died down\nfor sure but it was really bad pardon me\nbecause I'm just she only just be\ncompletely ignorant but what on earth\ndoes your voice have to do with it like\nI don't even understand oh oh they\nthought I was like freaking it I see\nlike they they think I'm faking it they\nthought it well they still think I don't\nknow okay yeah but that's the crux of it\nreally like they think I'm thinking why\ndoes why do they hate that like why\nwould anyone think you're hating your\nvoice I'm just so confused oh okay so\nthey think I'm faking my voice so they\nthink I'm faking it for attention and\nthen that gives way to like oh she's\njust doing everything for it tension\nshe's fake or whatever oh I see okay got\nit yeah yeah so what do you think about\nthat well nowadays I really don't care\nanymore good like there's there's only\nso many years you can get that in like\nyou know [ __ ] it and this is my voice\nlike I'm just gonna tuck in whatever is\ncomfortable for me like I'm just that's\nit right what else can I do\nyeah um so how does it make you how did\nit make you feel when they when they\nwould you know hate on you and how does\nsomeone hate on you for their voice what\ndo they actually say they say you're\nfaking your voice for attention is that\nwhat in how that I don't know what the\nhate mail this looks like okay\nhey you're not talking in your real\nvoice but I'm not talking in my real\nvoice too\nbut that's that's okay you don't have to\ndo it like that you can do with it\nwhatever kind of voice you want to do\nthis we can do a little bit the German\naccent we can do all kinds of the\ndifferent accents so all all kinds of\nvoices that are all fake everything is\nfalse in the south meaning when you\norder like that yeah it makes no sense\nhuh\nbut that's just one part of it is yeah\ngo ahead oh no no oh okay other part of\nit is I think I don't know why they\nthere are people who just really didn't\nlike me like they would send me messages\nwhere they were channeling psychoanalyze\nme like this is why you do this like you\nonly do it for attention your fake\nnothing about your you don't deserve\nsuccess like [ __ ] like that they do say\nmessage me stuff like that okay and\nthat's like okay um that used to bother\nme a lot back then especially when I was\nthem oh is it I was dating them before\nAlfred a a public figure as well and\npeople would messaged me saying how oh\nyou're just dating them for attention\nyou're gold digger stuff like that and\nthat really bothered me because I don't\nlike being misunderstood\nI guess cuz I'm not like that but they\nbelieve that so I don't know sucked you\nRisa\nokay sure feel like I'm breaking him is\nhe okay is he's fine right he's okay I\njust I feel bad oh and there was one\ntime yes someone sent me like a letter\nto my house when I live with my parents\nI don't know how they caught me I just\nwell probably pull up the docks and hey\nyeah it was creepy do you send me a\nseven-page letter saying how like\ndisparaging like everyone thought I was\nhanging out with and that I wasn't good\nfor them it was just weird\noh okay\nno seven-page I wish I kept it now it's\npart of history but I threw it away I\nBritish I burned it or something oh and\nthen there are people who message me\nlike after the whole Albert thing\nhappened like ah how I deserved to be\ncheated on and like stuff like that and\nI know this sounds like a stupid\nquestion even me but like how does that\nmake you feel people those already like\nin my own head but do you believe that\nwhen they say it um in my lowest of\ntimes maybe like at my little point\nright good for you so so I see this is\ninteresting so I think this is different\nbecause you would think because they're\nsaying the very things that you actually\nlike Lily to actually believes but you\ntell me that at your lowest of low maybe\nso I think that something something\nwithin you rebels against that and\nactually doesn't believe that I don't\nwant to believe in that of course you\ndon't want to believe it I'm not asking\nwhat you want I'm asking what you do do\nyou actually believe them when they say\nthese things about you I can just that\nby little points yeah yeah I I think\nit's good that you don't believe them\nthat doesn't mean that it isn't hurtful\nbut I don't think that this is the same\nis you feeling like do they make you\nfeel inadequate I think it's more like\nthey're triggers for like more thoughts\nlike they'll mention like oh you did\nthis so he cheated on you then I'm like\nI know I didn't but then Lily I would\nthink like I did do a up I wasn't like a\nlittle clingy I guess I guess I was like\nthat like I guess okay so they they kind\nof caused you to doubt some but it's not\nlike you you feel like these people are\nor you hit the nail on the head no no no\nI don't think so okay\nokay\nokay there there are three or four\nthings I want to say one of them I think\ncould be hard for you to hear and the\nother three I think are gonna be fine so\nthe first is we can talk a little bit\nabout understanding like why people hate\nright so this is not even about you it's\njust like what on earth would possess\nsomeone to go through all of the effort\nof finding out your address and then\nwriting you a seven-page late letter and\nlike mailing it like so first of all it\nboggles my mind that someone would like\nI can't even it takes every ounce of my\nwillpower to like put us like find a\nstamp buy an envelope print something\nout and mail it even if it's like\nimportant like my mortgage but they did\nit in a different color\nlike paper and pen color I remember so\nit was it it's crazy like what on earth\nwhy do people expend so much energy in\nhating you so the first thing to\nunderstand is that that has nothing to\ndo with you like Lily I know I was\ntalking about how you were amazing and\ninspirational and you can transform\nlives and all that good stuff I don't\nthink you have it within you to inspire\nsomeone to mail something that comes\nfrom them it doesn't come from you does\nthat make sense yeah that make sense so\nthat's the first thing to understand is\nthat this actually has nothing to do\nwith you and there's a decent chance\nthat you know we have to be a little bit\ncareful about like being narcissistic\nand saying like oh my haters like it's\njust all on them and has nothing to do\nwith me so I think you should you know\nreflect like if someone if you have a\ncriticism like if someone criticizes you\nso some people criticize me and I think\nthat's fair you know to take their\ncriticism seriously and that sort of\ndepends on the way in manner in which\nthey do it right so if someone sends me\na letter that's seven pages long I don't\nlike magazine type of different colors\nlike I don't I mean I'm just less likely\nto take that seriously because that's\njust [ __ ] weird right where I\nsometimes people say like oh what you're\ndoing is irresponsible and stuff like\nthat no those are like legitimate\ncriticisms and\nand who knows but I so there's a chance\nthere's ego deflecting this and saying\noh it's all in them but I really think\nit's all on them I don't think it's ego\nI think it's just understanding that\nhatred comes from them like first of all\nthey don't even know you they're like\nseeing something and something grates\nwith them about the person that you have\nbecome they have to tear you down\nbecause if you exist that is something\nthat they cannot like tolerate within\ntheir own psyche and I've dealt with\npeople like this in in my own life where\nlike you know like this is kind of like\nimportant like that like in a way\nthey've constructed a shell for\nthemselves and the shell involves like\ncertain things being true like for\nexample so I think part of the reason\nthat you may get a lot of hate is\nbecause you talk about depression and\nand when someone says like I'm just\ngonna you know I have no idea who these\npeople are and and some people were\nsaying I should talk to them I'm happy\nto talk to them actually but I'm just\ngonna toss something out there okay this\nis so like you talk about depression and\nyou struggle with depression and there\nare other people out there who struggle\nwith depression and there are people who\nstruggle so much with depression that\nthey become disabled and they're not\nable to do anything with their lives\nand they blame their depression but\nthere's also a bizarre amount of\nsecurity in that depression because it\nabsolves you of responsibility and here\ncomes [ __ ] Lillee Picchu who also\nstruggles and got told by her mom like\nGod like you know really emotionally\nabused by her mom and told her that she\nwouldn't rather be born and and that's\nwhat my parents told me and here she is\nbeing successful and that terrifies them\nbecause if you can be successful then\nit's not the depressions fault it's\ntheir fault\nso nothing inspires hate as much as\nseeing the person that you could be that\ninspires the deepest hate that I've ever\nseen because they look at you and they\nsay like oh I could be like that but I'm\nnot so I have to tear her down because\nif you're fake then they're fine does\nthat make sense a lot of so that's where\nI think a lot of this hate comes from it\ncomes from them and it comes from their\nown issues and they have to tear you\ndown in order to make themselves feel\nbetter about like their own situation in\nlife Oh like heaven forbid Lily actually\nis talented and brings value she must\nhave some trick right it must be like\nshe must be faking her voice because and\nlike I can't make that voice and that's\nwhy I'm not successful like there's no\nway that they can like their mind their\nego it comes down to ego their ego can\ntolerate like you being the person that\nyou are because it assaults their\nworldview in some way questions about\nthat um so you know I don't know that\nthis necessarily helps but I think you\nknow going forward I would just try to\nremember that right so like you when\nyou're gonna read those words in in your\nthis is gonna come to point number two\nwhich is that you are just full of love\nand we'll get to that in a second but\nyou know like you're gonna you're gonna\nthose words are gonna have an impact on\nyou but remember that like a lot of hate\nin this world doesn't I mean most hatred\nis not actually like I mean sometimes\nit's it's really deserving of the person\nwho did it but most of the time like\nhatred is like coming from them in like\ntheir own sense of like hurt or anger or\nfear or I mean that's you know when I\nget hatred like when I get a patient\nwho's like you know I get a lot of hate\nlike I work in a lot of situations where\nyou know sometimes I'll involuntarily\nhospitalized people and things like that\nor I'm working with people who were\nhospitalized against their will\nand and sometimes I work with people who\nare like psychotic like not in a\ncolloquial sense but in like a clinical\nsense and and so that you know you can\nmy overwhelming sense is that hate\nrarely has to do with you and it mostly\nhas to do with them the other thing to\nremember is if we think about hate hate\nis like really kind of a manifestation\nof anger right it's anger taken to\nextreme agree understand with me okay\nand so if we think about it what makes\nus angry like where does angry come\nwhere does anger come from\nso like Lily over the last two months\nsorry you know if I say something that's\ninsensitive because now I'm sort of\ntreating you in a different way but in\nthe last two months have you been angry\nyeah where does that anger come from\nhate\nabsolutely so this is the other thing to\nunderstand is that the birthplace of\nanger is hurt 99% of the time I don't\nknow maybe 90% is out maybe 50% of time\nfor the intensive purposes of this\ndiscussion\nit comes from hurt and that's been my\nexperience that hurt is what leads to\nanger and I remember like reading like a\nschool shooters manifesto and just\nthinking like the origin of this is\nheart right and and it's like I'm not\nyou know I don't know exactly where I'm\ngoing with this but this is important to\nunderstand and so it's kind of sad but\nthat like those people like even though\nthey're hating you and you suffer for\nthat and that's not cool and we'll get\nto that but at the end of the day like\nthis this is all born of like their hurt\nand like because like if you think about\nit you know if you're successful and\nyou're a reject and you went to\nCommunity College and you have\ndepression they don't have a [ __ ]\nexcuse because those are their excuses\nthose that's what they live behind right\nlike that's that's the armor of their\nlife it's like they can look at me and\nit's like way harder to hate me because\nthey look at me and they say oh dr. K is\ndifferent he's smarter he works hard he\nhas willpower went to Harvard they don't\nsee us as being the same\nbut the people who hate me are the ones\nthat see themselves within me like they\nlook at me and they see a part of\nthemselves and that can be terrifying to\ndeal with and that thought hurts so damn\nmuch because if you have excuses for\nlife then it's okay but like the thought\nthat you actually are in control that if\nyou had worked harder or hadn't given up\nor expended more effort your life could\nbe somewhere where it isn't that is\nimmensely hurtful most devastating thing\nand then it leads to anger and it leads\nto hatred and since they are depressed\nand disabled and may not may have failed\nout of Community College they have a\nbunch of time on their hands and this is\nI feel protective of you so I'm being an\n[ __ ] to them which is not really good\nbut I have nothing better to do than to\nwrite seven-page letters and mail them\nto you right so I think the main thing\nthat we need to understand is like\nmembers of this community who receive\nhurt is that I mean I think we as best\nas we're able I'm not saying you should\ndo this but as best as we're able to try\nto remember that this actually is coming\nfrom hurt that most anger comes from\nhurt and that if someone is like hates\nyou that if there's some way in which\nyou can help that person I think you\nshould I think that's more my ballpark\nthan your ballpark so I'm not trying to\nsuggest that you should do that but\nthat's a big part of why I street so I\ndon't want to project that on you but\nquestions about that okay so second\nthing about hatred is that Lily you're\nincredibly empathic like right like I\nthink you and your just your heart is\njust full of love and it's an amazing\nbeautiful thing and also sometimes sucks\nfor you because I think all right like\nscreaming being a public figure and\ncaring so much about everything is so\nhard yeah and I wish I didn't carry so\nmuch yep I wish you but so you're an\nempathic sponge and your heart is just\nfull of love and caring and you have to\nbe careful\nso I think part of the reason that like\nthe hatred bothers you is not because\nand this is why I was like early on I\nstarted asking like do you believe that\nabout yourself I don't think this I\ndon't think the hatred actually has\nanything to do with your lack of worth\nlike your lack of sense of self-worth I\nthink it's something completely\ndifferent and the reason that you suffer\nfor it is because you are just so your\nheart is just so full of love and you\nare so empathic that somehow\nsubconsciously psycho socially\nspiritually I don't even know what this\nis we're getting into territory that I\nreally do not understand and I'm just\nobserving you are able to connect with\nthat person and you feel not only their\nhatred but the hurt underneath and I\nthink it's hard on you and I think\nthat's because you love and because you\ncare and because your heart is open that\nlike things affect you in a in like a\nbigger way so like you know it's not\nyour fault it's not I mean generally\nspeaking I kind of think of it as good\nbut even then it's not good or bad it's\njust you need to understand that you're\nbeing whether it's your you know whether\nyou believe in souls or whatnot that's\nfine\nwhether it's personality or neuroscience\nlike your empathic circuitry your EQ\nsomething about the way that like your\nbrain is wired you feel the feelings of\nothers in a very deep and intense way\nand also the intensity of your own\nfeelings is like greater so I would\nguess that you test very very low on\nlike the sociopathy scale because your\nempathy is actually very high so like\nyou're not you know I think it would be\nhard for you to take advantage of other\npeople and things like that because yeah\nand and so that's just the way you are\nso you need to be careful about the way\nin which you care for yourself because\nyou need to understand that like other\npeople like you can't judge what you\nshould do to take care of yourself based\non what you see other people do and yeah\nso especially so I do I say this you're\ndoing nonsense\nso I was confused about like what what\noffline TV is because my quads were like\nyou should raid this person they're part\nof the offline TV crew and like I didn't\nunderstand literally what those words\nmeant like I don't understand what part\nof the offline TV crew is like do you\nguys understand how that sentence\ndoesn't like I don't even I just don't\nlike my head does not know how to\ncompute that so I was really confused\nand I try not to prepare for interviews\nwhich I think is good but then I googled\noffline TV and I saw what offline TV was\nuh and then I I watched some offline TVs\nand so I'm gonna be very explicit with\nyou I I think you've got to be careful\nbecause you're different from some of\nyour colleagues some of your colleagues\nare different in terms of their degree\nof empathy and also their degree of\nsociopathy so like their ability to\nwithstand things and also to put\nthemselves like to separate out the\ntheir feelings from their actions is\nlike very different from yours and you\nneed to take care of yourself in a\ndifferent kind of way like you need so\nyou need to think about yourself as a\nsponge and you absorb negativity very\neasily you hold on to negativity very\neasily you also absorb positivity very\neasily and you also let go of positivity\nvery easily so you need to have a life\nwhere like your you know how to wring\nout the sponge if it's negative and then\nstick it into something that you like\nbut you gotta wring it out and the\nreason you can't sleep is because you're\nnot wringing it out you got to wring it\nout and then put yourself into something\ngood this isn't distractions just like\nthis is just how your being works so I'm\ndifferent I test very highly on the\nsociopathy scale my sense of inherent\nempathy is very like was low and and so\nlike I'm different from you so the\nthings that work for me are not gonna\nwork for you I don't know exactly what\nthat means and I think we're gonna maybe\nhave a more concrete conversation about\nhow you can take care of yourself better\nbecause I think you do need to take care\nof yourself batter in\nby better I mean probably differently\nbecause you're trying to take care of\nyourself in the way that normal people\ntake care of themselves but you're not a\nnormal person you're just way too full\nof love and so you've got to take care\nof like I don't know what the ringing\nout is gonna be but it may be a\nparticular meditation exercise I have\none in mind\nwhich also is for insomnia but it's also\njust acknowledging that like you need to\nthink about yourself as like a white\ncloth and a white cloth stains way\nfaster but a white cloth you can also\nbleach so you're gonna have to be a\nlittle bit more rigorous about\nunderstanding what are the things that\nmake you feel how do you let go of\nnegative emotions and then how do you\nsoak up positive emotions and the more\nthat you're able to think about yourself\nin that way and like actively do that\ninstead of just hope it happens the\nbetter off you're gonna feel on a\nday-to-day basis you're like a real-life\nlike healer you're like a healer from an\nMMO yeah okay fine maybe maybe better\nquestions about being an empathic sponge\nyeah so it and that's not that's not a\nbad thing right so we don't want you to\nchange we just want you to at least in\nmy mind I don't think you should change\nI don't think that's right I think what\nyou should do is learn how to be\nyourself and learn how you work so that\nyou can be like happy day-to-day and\nlike understand what your body what your\nphysical emotional and spiritual needs\nare and that those may be different from\nother people's okay I mean everyone's\nare different from other people's\nbecause we're all unique so we can think\na little bit about that I think that's a\npotentially a longer conversation okay\nso the last thing is like you know it\nrelated to this is that you're just\ngonna have to sort of deal with that\nhate because when they send you the hate\nlike you absorb it and and it doesn't\nfeed your negative cognitive biases\nabout yourself and that you're worthless\nit's just I think you just absorb it\nyou're like you know and and that's\ntough so once again it comes to figuring\nout like how do you wring out that\nsponge\nhow can you sort of sit with those\nfeelings\ndon't try to push them away don't try to\ncope with them I mean cope with them but\nlike you know if you need to but but\ndon't try to distract yourself just feel\nthose feelings and then kind of think\nthrough okay like just recognize that\nwow this person like has a lot of anger\nand hatred and they're directing it\ntowards me so I'm gonna feel it but then\nas best as you can let it wash through\nyou okay and figure out what are the\nthings that help emotions wash through\nyou yeah\nis figuring that I was the hardest part\nyeah um that's what I'm saying I think\nI'm doing you in a sense of disservice\nbecause I'm I'm telling you to do\nsomething that I don't think that most\npeople are trained to learn how to do so\nI'm giving you a goal I'm sort of saying\nlike oh like you know come up with a\ngrand unified theory of physics and\nyou're like I don't know how to do that\nI'm like yeah I get that it's you know\nso that's why I say yeah so III think so\nI mean we could talk very concretely in\na few minutes about like what the first\nphase of that is yeah so just just to\nremember that that paint is gonna come\non to you but that you can let that go\nlike that's possible you just need to\nprocess it and and also you know try as\nbest as you can try to remember and like\nhopefully this will help that like the\nhates not coming I mean it's not really\nabout you it's about them like what the\n[ __ ] like why why do they go through all\nthis effort to try to hurt you in some\nway and now we come to the thing\nquestions thoughts yeah can I go the\nbathroom yes sorry\nnope go for it\nyou\nshould I be talking right now I'm\nconfused maybe I should talk I was\nI shall interact with scream for a few\nmoments\noh yes so psychiatrists test intend to\ntest highly on the sociopathy scale it's\npart of what makes us govern our job\nwhat are you drink I'm drinking water\ntell people who I am\noh oh right so there are a lot of new\npeople here I feel I sometimes okay so\nmy name is all okay noise I'm a\npsychiatrist\nthank you chat I need you guys I really\nneed you guys okay so my name is all\nO'Connor I'm a psychiatrist I'm\npracticing in Boston Massachusetts in my\nday job I'm an addiction psychiatrist I\nguess very briefly just about my\nbackstory so I played a ton of video\ngames was addicted to video games in in\ngrowing up high school almost failed out\nof college had less than a 2.0 GPA was\non academic probation ended up going to\nIndia to find myself etc loved it\nbecause I sort of discovered the Olga\nand meditation and I Reza decided to\nbecome a monk sort of trained in yoga\nand meditation I was still like coming\nback and forth between the US and India\nwith the goal of becoming a monk so did\nthat training for about seven years and\nthen ended up becoming going to medical\nschool and became a psychiatrist and a\nneuroscience research for a while and so\nnow I tried to help people understand\nthemselves a couple years ago I'm doing\na quick intro Lily because people were\nsuppose myself and so a couple years ago\nstarted like asking some of my like\nprofessors and stuff about video game\naddiction and realize like no one really\nknows anything about video game\naddiction because the leaders in the\nfield of Psychiatry are in their 50s 60s\nor 70s just true of most of medicine\nlike if you think about an expert in the\nfield like if you think about you know\npeople who get named to like fend chair\nand and things like that people who are\nCEOs and and things like people are\nolder and so they've never played video\ngames they don't understand what gaming\nis like so I started working with gamers\nabout five years ago and then recently\nstarted streaming on Twitch because like\nyou know gamers are not gonna wind up in\nmy office so if I want to talk to people\nabout\ntheir mind and mental health and how to\nunderstand it that twitch is the right\nthing to do and that seems to have\nworked out so far because people seem to\nenjoy this kind of thing so I enjoy it\ntoo and so that's who I am yeah so last\nthing yeah okay so this self deprecation\nthis is important to understand\nokay I'm gonna I'm kind of spent so I'm\ngonna just do this quickly and maybe you\nneed no no I I'm just I'm just I guess I\ndon't mean to make you feel bad I just\ncan't walk you to this in the way that I\nnormally do okay and so sometimes I also\nfind I'm afraid that this could sound\nhurtful or callous because usually I\npreface things pretty well okay so I\nthink it's very good Lily that you\nunderstand that the self you sort of\nself deprecated your I mean I think\nsometimes you know self deprecation is\nreally not has nothing to do with the\nway you feel about yourself it's just\nlike the way that you're funny like it's\nyour mode of humor but I think there is\nsomething very true that you said about\nyou know if you unless if you put\nyourself down then others can't hurt you\nyeah right so you can you can protect\nyourself from hurt as long as you're the\none who's like making fun of yourself\nlike as then you're in control and and\nthat sort of works it's a survival\nmechanism I'd be really curious if you\nwould like bullied growing up because\nthat's something that people learn how\nto do to protect themselves bullies and\nit's dangerous because you are willing\nto treat yourself badly because there's\ncertainty and security in that like\nthat's something you can deal with its\nterritory that you know you're willing\nto beat up on yourself or not let\nyourself feel hopeful or successful\nbecause if you aren't successful Lily\nyou can't be disappointing to anyone\nkyoool right so your fear when we talk\nto Lily to remember what is Lily to feel\nwhat's a primary feeling was the word\nused disappointment Oh dread of\ndisappointment right so you have you\nhave like this perfect armor against\neverything that Lily to dreads and that\nperfect armor is that you don't become\nsuccessful because if you're never\nsuccessful you can't be disappointed and\nif you can't be disappointed\nthen Lily too has nothing to worry about\nbecause her fears will never come to\npass and that is very protective and it\nis I think a bad way to live life and\nnow we're gonna come to Albert because\nyou've engaged in a relationship where\nyou loved and you gave your entire heart\nand you got devastated and now you're\nhesitant to love again and it's the same\nthing because unless you let yourself\nbecome successful you can't be\ndisappointed and there's a lot of\nsecurity security and comfort in not\nletting yourself love again yeah and I\nthink it's the wrong move it doesn't\nmean you have to do it now mm-hmm\nbut that's just that's a value judgment\nthat I'm placing I'm not saying that you\nshould do that it's just I have a bias\nand I have a belief that living a life\nof security and comfort is not how you\nlive a fulfilling life that a life of\nfulfillment comes out of facing\nuncertainty and embracing uncertainty\nand taking a chance and part of what\ndevastates all of these people about you\nlily is that like you are doing the\nthing that they did not do which is that\nyou took a chance and you faced up to\nlike all of your demons and you started\nstreaming and you did it inconsistently\nand you self-deprecating soft but you\nyou walked the very uncertain road which\nis why I think you're amazing because\nyou walk that road and you did it and it\nterrifies them because they look at you\nand they see the person that they could\nbe\nand so at some point I hope you're\nwilling to walk that road of uncertainty\nagain when it comes to engaging in a\nrelationship you know because I think\nthat there is a lot of joy and\nfulfillment in that but it's dangerous\nin the prospect yes very scary and so\nnot saying it has to be anytime soon\nmm-hmm but when I kind of think about\nsomeone who is as full of empathy and\nlove as you are and who clearly\nresonates with people and helps them in\na profound way and I think about you\nsort of living like at the age of 60 if\nyou're kind of alone and I've never you\nknow being in the same vocation that's\nkind of sad like that thought makes me\nsad and I think you deserve more\nand I'm not saying that you know\nAlbert's a good guy or bad guy or\nanything I'm just saying like you as a\nhuman being I think people deserve to be\nloved and cherished and appreciated I\nhope for that maybe one thing\ncommitments might scare you that yeah\nthat's why I think that's healthy\nreasonably yeah okay other thoughts\nquestions this was a really nice\nconversation I enjoyed it a lot too\nI really liked it thank you you're very\nwelcome\ndo people have questions for you are we\ndoing questions I don't know hold on do\nyou want to or you spent okay let me\njust um because we have some questions\nfor you okay oh and also we need to t I\nneed it we need to do meditation\nokay let's do meditation first and if\npeople have questions for Lily then\ny'all can ask them so I'm gonna teach\nyou a really simple meditation technique\nwhich I think will hopefully will help\nunclear but it's a meditation technique\nthat I usually teach for people who have\ntrouble sleeping do you meditate by the\nway\nno okay okay that's great we'll start\nfixing that problem today so so what I\nwant you to it we were talking about you\nkind of being an emotional sponge so\nwhen you wake up in the morning Lily\nwhen you're not in a period of\ndepression how do you usually feel I\nwake up I wouldn't bet eyebrows write it\nfor like three hours\nnot big eyes and does eyebrows write it\num just think what I would have to do\ntoday [ __ ] have to do that well god damn\nit I didn't do that yesterday uh-huh how\ndo you that when you first wake up\nreally lazy okay okay yeah that may be\nbecause you're not getting enough sleep\nbut okay so um you know I I don't know\nif this is actually true but but\ngenerally speaking I think about the\nmind is being relatively fresh in the\nmorning and then if we think about\ninsomnia what happens is like over the\ncourse of the day like it's easy to go\nto bed in the morning right uh-huh it's\neasy to fall asleep in the morning but\nit's hard to fall asleep at night so\nsomething changes between morning and\nnight and we have to understand what\nthat is that prevents you from sleeping\nat night because it's definitely not\nthere in the morning so I think a lot of\npeople don't appreciate that as they go\nthrough the day is you have thoughts\nlike you're having that creates a little\nbit of anxiety a little bit of tension\nlike oh I didn't do that it creates\nregret and those negative emotions the\nmore that you think like oh I didn't do\nthis and I did do this like even though\nyou may feel like going back to sleep\nhow\ndoes that affect your ability to sleep\num not comfortable absolutely yes so\nwhen you try to go to bed at night what\nis it that keeps you awake I don't know\nI need you have thoughts I do I think a\nlot yep I just think a lot about what\nwell first I need to get off reddit that\ncould take like hours there's so many\nseparate us out there it's crazy\num and then I just think like a lot of\nwhat-ifs a lot okay a lot okay yeah okay\nso that's I'm thinking that maybe we\nneed to teach you something else but I'm\ngonna continue teaching when I was\nplaying teacher but that's just changed\nmy sense of what what could be helpful\nto you but my sense is that you know\nwhen when we wake up in the morning it's\nrelatively easy to go to sleep and as we\ngo through the day we start to have\nthoughts and those thoughts have like\nlittle emotional impacts so we take like\na little bit of emotional damage and\nusually that damage is there because the\nthought is not incomplete I mean if the\nthought is incomplete it's not like\nresolved so we think about something and\nit's like something that's left\nunresolved and it's kind of this little\nemotional weight that needs to be\nsettled so if you're thinking oh I\ndidn't do this yesterday then that's\nlike a little bit of regret and a little\nbit of guilt and you're not quite at\npeace with that does that make sense\nin fact the thoughts of like guilt and\nregret are a sign of lack of peace you\nwith me like you're not at peace about\nit which is why you regret it\nthose are like tide so basically what\nhappens is throughout the day we have\nlittle instances either thoughts or\nencounters with people we're like oh I\nsay this and like let's say like at the\nend of tonight if I'm laying in bed and\nI say oh I should have said this to Lily\nI forgot to say this I was less\ncompassionate than I could have been or\nthis or that and so there are all things\nthat happen throughout the day that sort\nof give us this like it's like we're\nabsorbing a little bit of that stuff in\nour emotional sponge and then as we\naccumulate all that crap through\nthe day then we go to bed and we just\nhave this flood of like random thoughts\nabout all kinds of stuff half of which\nis not good yeah right so that's like\nI'm like just in complete mental energy\nthat we've accumulated through the day\nbecause our experiences are not complete\nor processed they're all like half done\nlike I walked in the grocery store and\nthere was this chick and she was\nchecking me out\nI was like oh yeah like like there's\nthat thought or I was walking down the\nstreet and there was this chick and she\nwas looking at my hair because it was\nridiculous oh my god\nI'm mortified that's oh there are all\nthese incomplete little things that\nhappen right so yeah I'm going to do\nmeditations they trying to complete all\nof this sort of this meditation is is\nway easier than completing them because\ncompleting them is a lot of work it's\nactually unwinding so I want you to\nthink about your mind in the morning is\nunwound and as you go through the day\nyou kind of wind it up like it gets\nround right like you get like tense and\nyou get energy and then at night you\nhave like insomnia so this technique is\nrelatively simple it's just you start at\nthe end of your day so you start in the\nmoment so you're laying in bed and then\nyou go through your day in reverse order\nso you start with the most recent thing\nand then you go to the thing before and\nthen you go to the thing before and you\ngo to the thing before and you just\nthink through the emotional impact or\nyou acknowledge the emotional impact you\ndon't have to process anything you just\nthink like you just acknowledge the\nemotions that you felt and how you felt\nthe moment before in the moment before\nand the moment before and the goal is to\nleft leave yourself being unwound at the\nbeginning of the morning when you were\ntired and sleepy and then if you get\ngood at the technique so this is\nimportant to remember is that like\nmeditation is a skill so you have to\npractice this technique for a period of\nabout eight weeks five times a week for\nit to really have a significant change\non your sleeping pattern that's what you\nshould expect and so I'll give you just\nkind of an example right so like I was\nbefore I got into bed I brushed my teeth\nbefore I brush my teeth I changed my\nclothes and\nand I saw and as I was changing my\nclothes my wife yelled at me because\ninstead of putting clothes in the hamper\nI put them on the floor actually clothes\non the floor and I felt irritated with\nher and before that I was reading my\nkids a bedtime story and that felt\nactually really amazing because they're\nvery cuddly but then one of them was\nlike moving around too much and she\nwasn't sitting still so I felt\nfrustrated with her I also felt like\nannoyed that my other kid couldn't hear\na story because I was dealing with the\nwiggly one and before that I was eating\ndinner and I felt kind of frustrated\nbecause like I wanted to eat chicken\nwings but instead say comfy I'm sorry\nyeah so so I mean welcome didn't feel\nthat way to me but I mean I recognize\nthere parts of it better wholesome but\nbut so to basically go through your day\nin reverse order and so like acknowledge\nthe things that you felt so let's\npractice now and as you feel comfortable\nlet's so close your eyes and and start\nin reverse order so what tell me about\nwhat you did today today yeah so we're\ngonna start now what you did and how it\nmade you feel was wrong with this moment\nI talked to you felt cathartic actually\nhelped me a lot um then I was looking\nfor my glasses for about an hour it made\nme very frustrated cuz I think I still\nhaven't found my glasses I'm wearing\nsomeone else's glasses or you know\nactually okay so good this is a mistake\nI'm just going off on a tangent\nyes very good so this is a problem so\ndon't indulge in new lines of thought\njust acknowledge I felt frustrated that\nI could not find my glasses and then\nmove to the thing before good hey\nfrustrated could not find my glasses uh\nI drank a lot of water cuz I was sick\nfelt better I had a cough drop because I\nwas sick also felt better um I put some\nmakeup on cuz ya felt better\num wash my face changed woke up I guess\nthat's my day okay\nso I want you to how long ago did you\nwake up around how many hours sorry I\ncompletely forgot one more thing um\nbefore that eyebrows right if for like\nan hour to me people okay I woke up at\nlike 9:00 so now what we need to do is\nincrease the resolution of like zoom in\nmore right so like there are a lot of\nthings so did you feel something before\nyou came on stream I did I felt very\nanxious actually threatens oh so this\ntechnique doesn't work unless you catch\nthat right because like the the feelings\nthat you acknowledge are the things that\nyou unwound but unless you acknowledge\nthe anxiety that anxiety is gonna sit\nwith you okay yeah so so in the span of\nlike you know 30 to 60 seconds you went\nthrough your entire day we need to spend\nfive minutes like so you want to go\nthrough each thing that happened okay\nokay so so yeah that's okay that's the\npoint of the technique is this it's not\nsupposed to be easy the point of the\ntechnique is so that it it trains you to\nacknowledge the various things that\nhappen throughout the day so that you\ncan unwind them a little bit and then\nthey're weighing on you less okay so I\nthink let's try this one more time and\nwhy don't you start with last night so\npretend that you're in bed last night\nand try to go I'll stop you after like\ntwo or three minutes okay but like put\nyourself in the frame of mind of like\nwhat did you do like you were in bed\nlast night and start there\nokay was in bed then I washed up then\nhow did you feel when you washed up\nrelieved oh yeah\nrelieved I felt relieved when I washed\nup because I had a long day um uh then\nsome people dropped me off home before\nthat we watched a movie and the movie\nwas entertaining it's funny I enjoyed it\nhow was the car ride home uneventful it\nwas just the car ID okay before that I\nwas with my friend Michael we went to a\npremier event was exciting we streamed\nfor hours and hours um most fun then\nbefore that car ride to the event\nuneventful again and before that got\nmakeup hair stylist done but just also\nexciting machine gun as well um before\nthat uh ordered food eight wasn't very\nhungry but it's late and then before\nthat\nwell browsed right it probably washed up\na little browser edit I guess okay so\ngreat so I think you're doing a far\nbetter job at sort of incorporating\ndifferent things throughout your day but\nsomething tells me that the majority of\nyour emotion yesterday maybe this isn't\nright but that the did you have trouble\nsleeping last night I have trouble\nsleeping every night okay\nso I'm curious about the little the\nlittle anxieties fears dreads that you\nmay have had throughout the day I did\nmiss a lot actually I had a big problem\nwith the streaming backpack it was super\nstressful I don't know I didn't see it\nWow um yeah I was so stressed about that\ncuz I didn't know if we could stream or\ndistressed mean um I was like anxious I\nget nervous and I was feeling like\noverwhelmed about the topic okay\num at the event too I was really tired\nsuper physically exhausted super tired\num okay good so lily I think this is\nthis is good so you need to practice the\ntechnique sort I would say is that you\nknow as as you now that you're kind of\nyou can even do sort of the flipside of\nthe technique which is as you're going\nthrough your day just take note of how\nyou feel so that you can do the\ntechnique at night the other thing that\nyou're not allowed to do so it's great\nthat you acknowledge these things now if\nyou're really doing the technique like a\nhard-ass you start over at the beginning\nand you include those with everything\nelse okay don't do that yeah let's try\nit one more time okay so yesterday yes\nfrom the moment I woke up on the moment\nyou went to sleep\nbackwards is really hard yes it's harder\nthan yeah okay so washed up felt good\ncuz I had a long day um I was closed\nokay um eat some food did not feel like\nit I wasn't hungry but I made myself II\nbecause I didn't eat much that day car\nride home was uneventful relieved to go\nthe event itself was fun but tiring um\njust really tiring but I kind of wanted\nto go home to uh then the car ride to\nthe event was kind of stressful because\nwe were trying to work out the stream\nthere was some problem with the screen I\nremember it was super cool I was very\ncool and then bring a jacket I was a\nmistake and before that the hair makeup\nwas fine but I was also still stressed\nbecause I wasn't sure if the screen was\ngonna be good that day and I didn't know\nif the backpack was gonna work on before\nI start to stream before the makeup we\nwere trying to fix the backpack for a\nlong time I was stressed because I\ndidn't know what to do and I felt bad\ncuz I was relying on my goal to fix it\nand I couldn't help then ordered food\nDallas oak\nI wasn't that hungry but just ate cuz I\nwas nervous about that day oh I had an\neyelash appointment that morning I\nforgot that was kind of okay I fell\nasleep during the most of it because you\njust lay there for two hours then I woke\nup oh I auditioned for something that\nmorning too\nI was very tired so I was kind of\nnervous because I wasn't sure if my\nvoice sounded good in the morning and I\nwas sick too and then I woke up at 8:00\nso what do you notice about the first\nrun in the second run I forgot so many\npings Wow so that's all crap that is\nswimming around in your unconscious it's\njust like I can't believe I forgot all\nof that yeah right so living a life like\nwhere you're where you're mindful of\nlike moments and things like it's very\nhard it takes practice I think you're\ndoing a fantastic job I'm amazed by how\nmuch progress you've made between like\none run and so keep practicing yeah yeah\nclosing your eyes this huh very good\nokay so let's see I think I think that's\nlet me see if people have questions for\nyou okay so\nSheena's how do I get healing like this\nif I cannot afford the expense of a\ntherapist or psychiatrist so that's why\nwe're training coaches so I'm like\ntraining a dozen coaches who are gonna\nbe working hopefully with people and our\nbeta program is gonna be free at some\npoint though we're gonna probably have\nto charge something because you know\nthey can't continue to volunteer their\ntime but and it's gonna be it's not it's\nnot like it's not treatment so it's\ngonna be like cheap so maybe like 40\nbucks an hour or something like that\nso okay\nokay so someone says you had mentioned\nwith Kevin to not live in a world with\nhypotheticals I know Kevin is but after\ngetting cheated on the first time I\nstarted living in a world of what if my\nnext girlfriend cheats on me\nin my case my next girlfriend did how do\nyou let go of the hypothetical if it was\ncorrect once what do you think Willie um\nhow do you I don't even know I don't I\nwish I knew that now - yeah\nI still think what if my next boyfriend\ncheats on me or I'm scared of that still\nyeah so I think it's a great question\nright so I think that's the challenge is\nthat each time you get hurt you can fear\nengaging in the relationship again and\nso that sort of makes sense like it can\nbe hard every time every time that you\nknow you get hurt it can be hard to\nshake that thing again and again and and\nI've talked about something called a\nsome scar which is sort of like a ball\nof undigested emotion or trauma before\nand I think when I talk about Lilly -\nfor example I'm talking about in\nSanskrit Lilly - is something called a\nsome scars so it's like this this sort\nof dormant set of emotions that rise up\nand change Lilly's thought patterns and\nbehaviors and then they go dormant again\nand she's back to being normal Lilly so\neach time you get emotionally hurt and\nyou don't process it the strength of the\nsome scar grows so if we look at Lilly\nwe see that Lilly has this persistent\nsense of self judgment in disappointment\nand falling short because that she\ndidn't get told that she was\ndisappointing once she got told she was\ndisappointing again and again and again\nand again and each time she gets told\nshe's disappointing that thing grows and\nwhat we see is like what we see today\nright which is this persistent negative\nself-critical kind of like it's like\nsubtitles like you're living your normal\nlife and these subtitle thoughts are\njust like popping up and you\nstruggle because you're trying to like\nstop the subtitles and it's kind of okay\nbecause you're actually still living\nlife but the subtitles are there it's\nreally [ __ ] annoying so with the with\nthe girlfriend I think you've got to\nunderstand that each time it happens\nit's gonna create some emotional weight\nand that you have to sort of learn how\nto like face uncertainty again and step\nout of your security and comfort zone\nwhich is a little bit of an unsatisfying\nanswer the other thing that you've\nreally got to be careful about is that a\nlot of times people get into similar\nrelationship patterns and from\npsychiatry this is something we call the\nrepetition compulsion that people tend\nto essentially like try to repeat the\nsame they end up repeating the same\nthing over and over again because\nthey're trying to like fix something and\na good example of this is people who are\nin abusive relationships often times\nwe'll get into abusive relationships\nagain and they'll get into abusive\nrelationship after abusive relationship\nafter abusive relationship so the other\nthing that you can do and I know this is\ngonna sound kind of weird but you can\nlook at like how you select the people\nthat you end up dating because there's a\nchance that you you gravitate towards a\ncertain kind of person who is more\nlikely to be unfaithful and I know that\nsounds crazy and it sounds kind of like\nyou know I'm not I'm not trying to blame\nyou but at the same time we actually had\nan interesting early on when we started\nstreaming we had a great conversation\nwith someone who found that like Heath\nhe gets into the same relationship\npatterns over and over again and a lot\nof people do experience that they get\ninto the same relationship patterns like\nover and over again like why do I always\ndate [ __ ] like Oh like there may be\na reason for that you know so so I think\none thing that you can do is just learn\nhow to sort of emotionally process that\nhurt and then hopefully it'll be eat I\nmean it's gonna be harder but each time\nit happens it's understandably a harder\nto like have faith in another person and\nthat's normal the second thing that you\ncan do is really look at the ways in\nwhich your your kind of selecting people\nand is something going on in terms of\nthe kind of person that you gravitate\ntowards or things like that do you\nignore signs that the relationship isn't\ngoing well there are a lot of other\nthings that you can practice\nwe do which I feel like it's kind of a\nmean answer but I mean it's true right\nlike you you were right once and you\nwere right again and that's bad that\nsucks\nokay can you do a day in the life video\nI guess that's for me or you I don't\nknow what that's for you - what is that\nday in the life is like a video where\nyou just show you view the day in the\nlife of me I wake up I do this I do that\nyou know make it interesting maybe draw\nit out you know anything maybe it's for\nme I don't know but yeah okay okay so\nlet's people have questions about a\npsychiatrist psychosis is the experience\nfor people with very high IQs similar as\nin are they mostly depressed and lonely\nno so one thing that is similar is that\nthe the US Department of Defense did a\nstudy on their soldiers and found that\nsoldiers who play video games have an IQ\nthat's 10 to 20 percent higher than\nsoldiers who don't play video games so I\ndo actually genuinely believe that\ngamers are like general that being very\nintelligent is actually a risk factor\nfor video game addiction and there's a\nvery simple reason for that it's not\nlike super complicated so I'll tell you\nguys so I was early on and when I\nstarted working with gamers I was\ntalking to a very particular gamer and I\nasked him you know when did you like\nreally like video games and like how did\nyou get into them and the story they\ntold me like blew my mind and has stuck\nwith me ever since and they said that so\nI was in the second grade and I went to\nschool and my teacher gave me a math\nworksheet and I knew how to do the math\nso I did the worksheet and then 10\nminutes later I went and I handed in the\nworksheet and then I said can I have the\nnext one and Lily what do you think the\nteacher said what happens when you turn\nin your worksheet in class what do you\nthink\nno yeah that's exactly says she says\nthis is the worksheet for the day we're\ngonna do another one tomorrow right\nthat's how school works like you have a\nlesson plan for the day and if you're a\nsmart kid and you finish it early then\nyou get to sit and wait and read quietly\nby yourself and then he would go home\nand he would play a video game and Lily\nhe would beat level one of the video\ngame and then what happened next what\nhappens after you beat level one\nabsolutely\nabsolutely right so like a video game is\nsomething that paces its challenge to\nyour capabilities and and and school\nmoves at the rate of the slowest kid and\nso I think that like very early on like\npeople like smart kids gravitate towards\nvideo games because they actually get\nchallenged in a game the way they can't\nin real life so I you know when I work\nlike I was recently working with a kid\nand my solution to his video game\naddiction cuz he's a he's a big-time\nanyway he's he's a successful player in\na particular game is to like hook him up\nwith an internship at MIT so I called a\nbuddy of mine who is has a start-up at\nMIT and was like hey can you like take\nthis kid he's 15 they're like we have\n600 applicants for interns and I was\nlike yeah but this gets different he's\nspecial and the kid goes to to do the\ninternship and now he's not playing many\ngames anymore because he realizes oh\nthere's actually like really cool\nchallenging stuff in the world that I\ncan engage in and and like when you do\nthat it you know that's how you kind of\nget free from your addiction but I do\nthink that that generally speaking I see\na lot of correlation between\nintelligence and video game addiction\nalthough I don't necessarily think that\nintelligence leads to being depressed\nand lonely because you know I would say\nthat for example so I guess I didn't\nmention this in my bio but I'm faculty\nat Harvard Medical School and I trained\nthere and a lot of people they're smart\nbut I don't think that their average\nexperiences to be depressed and lonely\nI think gamers who are very intelligent\noftentimes are depressed and lonely\nbut that's because like games give them\nwhat real life can't and as they move\naway from real life and gravitate more\ntowards games then they become depressed\nsimilarly sorry I don't think it's just\nthe IQ it's like a combination of like\nthe way that gaming influences your life\njust trying to see ok\ndid you talk to her about Dharma I don't\nthink so\nsort of so Padma is something I talked a\nlot about in stream and it's the Sun\nscript word for duty or responsibility I\nsort of talked to her about it because I\ntold her so but I didn't talk about it\nexplicitly because I didn't think it was\nkind of just random I didn't think it\nwas relevant\nI mentioned yeah so so what I did talk\nabout Lilly is like why do you stream\nbecause I like it and it's a good job\nyeah so you like it and it's a good job\nyeah and what is it what do you like\nabout streaming um I think it's a very\nunique job but um I take the word lucky\nnow but I'm lucky to have and I don't\nwant to waste it I don't wanna waste the\nopportunity yeah but what do you like\nabout it\nI like talking with my chat like talking\nabout feeling I like drawing blinking\nyeah\ndo you think that your is there some\npart of you that feels like streaming is\nyou're making the world a slightly\nbetter place\nOh 60% me me it's hard it's hard it's\nhard you think that it is right so I\ndon't think you're ready to accept that\nbut I think earlier on you were there\nyeah and and so now her mental patterns\nhave returned so like now she's back to\nsit but it's good that you can recognize\nthat 60 playing no that's but that's the\nDharma right so I think we talked about\nit but we just didn't call it what it\nwas I mean I think you're genuinely\nconnecting with a lot of people yeah\nthey come back\n[Music]\nokay so I think those are all the\nquestions that sort of relate to you I\nmean they're all kinds of questions\nabout porn addiction and stuff but I\ndon't think but yeah anyway thanks a lot\nLilly no thank you this is really great\nI'm really happy I got to talk to you\nyeah I I really enjoyed talking to you\nand and you know if if you want to talk\nmore practically if you ever want to\ntalk again just you know let us know and\nthen the second thing is Makai a little\nbit more in terms of guidance in terms\nof helping you understand how to wring\nout your sponge and how to absorb good\nstuff and like actually like you know\ngive you something concrete that you can\ndo but let's start with the meditation\ntype of technique and let me know how\nthat works for you and there's a decent\nchance that's gonna be very hard to do\nlike cuz you just won't remember so I\ncan problem solve around that too okay\nhey all right take care thank you thank\nyou\nactually let me ask you real so do you\nguys think you guys like wait but did\nyou all understand you guys can do that\nmeditation technique - do you guys want\na different one or are we good that's\nmeditation what we told her - you should\njust do that\nokay Lily can I teach you one more\nmeditation technique oh yeah sure sure\nyeah okay\nso sorry for almost hanging up okay but\nwe're not done with you yet so I want\nyou to we're gonna do mm-hmm let me\nthink\ndo you guys want to do something easier\nanxiety-provoking Lily if you have to go\nI can just

couple of hours no\nanxiety spiking holy crap yeah right so\nthis is the goal of the technique is\nthat when all of you guys do it like the\nthought of doing it does what for you it\nmakes me embarrassed and like I don't\nwant to do it on stage\nyes exactly that's the point right so if\nwe're gonna teach you how to deal to to\nmake your anxiety melt away we have to\nmake you anxious first right so it's\ngonna work well trust me trust me 2:46\np.m. iike do you need to go no I'm just\nmaking a joke okay okay so it's okay so\nyeah but chanting is and you guys should\ndo this at home too okay chanting is not\nabout sound\nit's about vibration so close your eyes\ndeep breath in\nokay are you feeling vibration yeah I'm\nso nervous right now good that's fine\nthat's that's completely fine don't\nworry about it\nso we're gonna do it again okay so deep\nbreath in I'm gonna hit listen to you do\nit on your own kay so deep breath in\neyes closed\nno more opening your eyes for the rest\nof the practice okay okay\ndeep breath in begin ah sorry that's\nokay\nlaughs embarrassment\ngood good okay deep breath in good keep\ngoing one breath yeah full breath go\nyou\nyou\nokay good
