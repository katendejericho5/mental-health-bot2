your back should be\nstraight okay good okay\nthen I want y'all to close your eyes so\nwe're gonna ring the bell to start to\nsignal the start of the practice and end\nof the practice okay\nso close your eyes I'll teach you guys\nwhat the practice is go and blow your\nnose if you need to and then start by\nnoticing the temperature of your breath\nyou can lie down on your back notice the\ntemperature of your breath how is the\ntemperature from inhalation different\nfrom exhalation\nyou\nand now where do you feel that coldness\nyou\nwe're in your nose do you feel it the\ntip of your nose in the middle of your\nnose towards the top of your nose in the\nback of your throat\ncheck each area put your full attention\non the tip of your nose\nand then the middle of your nose and\nthen the top of your nose the bridge of\nyour nose with three separate breaths so\nat the first breath tip of the nose\nyou\nsecond breath middle of a nose\nyou\nthird breath top of the nose\nyou\nyou\nand now focus on the back of your throat\nyou\ncan you feel the coolness there\nyou\nfocus on the bottom of your throat\nyou\nyour chest\nyou\nyour belly\nyou\nyou\nand now focus on your eyebrow Center\ntry to feel the cool air as it enters\nyour nose and travels up to your\neyebrows Center\nyour forehead\npush that air up into that area\nor pull it towards the eyebrow Center\nand put your attention there with each\nbreath feel the coolness travel up with\neach exhalation feel the warmth leave\nyou\ntry the eyebrow Center for five breaths\nyou\nyou\nyou\nif you guys are having trouble with that\npart no problem just all of the breath\nwhere it goes\nyou\nnow we'll practice for about one minute\nfollow the coolness of the Bradfield\nmmm night it out see how far the breath\nwill go\nif it goes to the eyebrow Center\nfantastic if it doesn't no problem it\ngoes to your throat your chest perfectly\nfine\nyou\nyou\nlet's go ahead and come back\nthank you for the sobs fluid soul and\nthank you for the donations guys\nokay\nyou\nyou\nyou\nokay\nso we're gonna talk about porn addiction\nat some point okay good\nI just sorry I just hot question so I'm\njust watching chat and I'm seeing so it\nsounds like some of y'all are doing\nsomething productive so that's great\nsorry my mind is a little bit blank so\nI'm having trouble keeping up with\nwhat's happening okay okay let me just\ntry to recap okay so let's talk about\nmeditation for a second sorry about the\nporn addiction comment someone was like\nI've been getting a lot of questions\nrecently about porn addiction so let's\ntalk about this so number one just feel\nwhat you're feeling crap I can't I'm\nwatching some of my students the\ndreadful last time you good thinking you\nthink okay yeah so derpy det David was\nsaying that he's been watching the\nstream and reckful and it's close to\nhome it's been helpful fantastic that's\nwhat we're here for\nwe're here to help let's talk about\nmeditation for a second\nblurry stopping blur okay so remember\nthe goal of when you meditate don't I\noffer certain directions that you can go\nin but you don't have to necessarily go\nin those directions so for some people\nI'm trying to like accelerate things by\nsuggesting things and if you feel\nsomething great if you don't feel\nsomething that's okay too\nwe're gonna find a technique for you at\nsome point we're gonna find techniques\nfor everyone that's the goal the next\nthing is I have homework for y'all so if\nyou guys like this technique which is\nessentially noticing where within your\nbody that the temperature of the breath\ngoes that's the summation of the\ntechnique feel the temperature feel\nwhere it goes I know it's out of focus I\ndon't know what to do about this thing\nthere we go\nit's that better okay nope it's like\nit's only in focus over here for some\nreason all right so now what I want you\nguys to do in terms of homework is do\nthis practice and see where within your\nbody do this practice for a week see\nwhere within your body that you can feel\nthe temperature change okay and then I'm\ngonna ask you guys some questions about\nit\nbecause some of its could be weird do it\nevery day every day for one week do it\nfor like five minutes see where the\ntemperature goes so the way that you do\nthat is you pick a spot like you may\nhave felt it initially just at the tip\nof your nose so you feel where do you\nfeel it and then you move a little bit\nfurther and move a little bit further\nmove a little bit lower move a little\nbit lower move a little bit lower move a\nlittle bit lower and then you sense\nright so you you put the attention of\nyour mind on a particular spot and you\nsee what you can feel there and then\ndon't let your mind get in the way if\nAlice is watching Alice should really do\nthis technique and not let his mind get\nin the way because we're gonna teach LS\nhow to step outside of his mind and if\nhis mind gets in the way he'll fail if\nhe doesn't his if he doesn't let his\nmind get in the way he will succeed and\nif he succeeds we will know based on his\nanswer if he fails we will see based on\nhis answer oh my I was feeling the\ncoldness near my eyebrow but I stopped\nand wanted to do it and my focus way\nback crap I can't read all that okay all\nright back and forth during the middle\nof it and the coldness went down the\nback to the middle of my nose instead\nyeah so that's great whatever happened\nis fine just keep doing it okay just\nkeep doing it yeah and so also you guys\nI don't know you all should check out\nAlice a stream\napparently he's really good at soloqueue\nand coaches people and yeah so closing\nthoughts questions let me just check our\nquestion log real quick and see if\nthere's anything that\nokay so here's a question is it possible\nto grow up without a Dharma the answer\nis absolutely yes most people grow up\nwithout a Parma so you have a Dharma\ngrowing up to like usually be a student\nor be a child or something like that so\nI think the first stage of your life the\nfirst 25 years of your life should be\nspent primarily on learning that doesn't\nmean that you're like a formal student\ndoesn't mean that you don't have a job\nit means that you should be learning\nabout yourself so I think in a weird way\nif you are coming and watching the\nstream that is actually fulfilling your\nautonomy because you're learning about\nyourself that's why it feels good a lot\nof you guys think about this for a\nsecond people stay up till like 5:00\na.m. to watch the stream why is that\nthat sucks it's because you're doing it\nfor your Dharma right so like you're\ndoing it to better yourself you're doing\nit to become the person that you need to\nbe which is like great because that's\nyour tournament right now\nso that's awesome okay where do you\nstart if you're depressed but you have\nno reason for it nothing went wrong in\nyour life how do you address that\nbeautiful that's internal mine okay so\nfrom a clinical perspective sometimes\npeople have a biological depression\nwhich means what I mean by that is that\nthey don't have any triggering event\nthey just have some neuro chemistry\nthing where they're like their life is\nfantastic and they start to get\ndepressed for no reason whatsoever so\nthat happens that's true major\ndepressive disorder has to do with the\nchemical imbalance maybe has to do with\nlow thyroid hormone as someone mentioned\nyou should go see a doctor if that\nhappened to you\nbut there is a difference between\nclinical depression and unhappiness and\nif everything is going well in your life\nand you still feel sad and it's not\nepisodic and you're just unhappy because\nyou feel even though you're checking all\nthe boxes you feel empty on the inside\nthat is a lack of Dharma\ndoesn't mean that you can't be diagnosed\nwith depression doesn't mean that you\nshouldn't you should probably just get\nevaluated for depression by a clinician\nbut it also means that there's a\ndifference between depression and\nunhappiness and if you're unhappy if\nyou're feeling unfulfilled finding your\ntarma is gonna do it for you\nso it doesn't always mean that\ndepression comes from something\ntraumatic or something like that that's\nnot always the case okay\nah this is great I feel like my Dharma\nis to create something but I don't know\nwhat it is yet what do I do to start\nlooking for something specific beautiful\ngreat question so you guys are know like\nin like heroes stories and like RPGs and\nstuff like people train really hard and\nthen the final boss like then the cat\ncatastrophe sort of happens like like\nyou can think about Harry Potter or\nsomething right there like learning how\nto be Wizards and then\nlike that Voldemort shows up there's the\ntraining arc yeah so what you guys need\nto understand is somebody all maybe in\nyour training arc and that's what you\nshould do so I'll give you guys a very\nlike simple example from my own life so\none day when I decided I was going to\nbecome a psychiatrist\nthe first thing that actually happened\nwas panic because I realized that like\nhis medical school was ending like I\nwouldn't get trained anymore in like\nreal medicine I was gonna be like\ntalking to people about their feelings I\nwasn't gonna know how to fix heart\nattacks like I was like you know you\nknow you deal with heart attacks and\nstuff strokes pneumonias things like\nthat like rashes like how do you know if\nsomething is skin cancer or just rash\nlike all this kind of stuff so I started\nto get really really scared because\nafter six months of intern year like I\nwasn't gonna be dealing with anything\nphysical anymore that was it like I was\ngonna get six months of training in\ninternal medicine in dealing with\ndiabetes and more em eyes and all that\nkind of stuff and then I was done like\nthat was it and then I had this thought\nand this actually happened to me and I\ntold the story that you know one day I'm\ngonna be on an airplane and they're\ngonna they're gonna like the the air\nhostess or whatever is gonna say is\nthere a doctor on board we have a\nmedical emergency and then in that\nmoment\nI was gonna have to decide like am I\ngonna hit the call button and like be\nthe doctor and then I got scared because\nI was like what if like a decade from\nnow I haven't like the last time I saw\nsomeone who was physically ill was like\na decade ago and they're like is there a\ndoctor on the plane like do I even count\nlike does that do I hit the call button\nor do I not hit the call button so then\nI realized that I have six months to\nlearn as much as I he manely can about\nphysical medicine because after that\nit's like 40 years of like not knowing\n[ __ ] about anything physical so I\nstudied my ass off and I spent a lot of\ntime at the hospital and I tried to like\nreally learn as much as I could because\nthat's my training arc and then the\nfinal boss is gonna show up and then\nit's like game time so if you don't know\nwhat your dharma is and if you feel like\nyou should create something I work with\na lot of people individually who have\nthat exact same feeling these are people\nwho are in private equity firms are like\nworking in companies or like investment\nbankers or physicians who feel like\nthey're supposed to do something greater\nthan like what they're doing day to day\nand so what I tell you is that that day\nwill come that should not comfort you\nthat should terrify you and the question\nis are you gonna be ready you're gonna\nget your opportunity because if that's\nyour Karma it's gonna happen and then\nyou're either gonna be able to do it or\nyou're not going to be able to do it\nso I'll give you guys another very\nsimple example I show up on stream here\nthree times a week I've never met the\nperson don't know who this person is\ndon't know what's going on with them\nright and like I'm supposed to help that\nperson like what on earth can I possibly\nknow that is gonna help some random\nperson from the internet like I have no\nidea\nright there are 3,000 people watching\nright now and like I have to do\nsomething that satisfies or helps 3000\npeople plus the person that I'm talking\nto I have no idea like what that's gonna\nlook like I don't know what I'm getting\nmyself into I have no idea like I have\nno idea there's a little part of me\nthat's terrified every time I come on\nstream because how am I gonna help this\nperson I don't know but it works because\nbefore that I realized at some points in\nmy life someone is gonna show up and I'm\ngonna have to help them so whenever I\nread a book whenever I meditate myself\nwhenever I like study things whenever I\nread things like today I read like a\npsychoanalyst doing an AMA on reddit and\nlike paid attention to what he was\nsaying and thought about it so like as\nyou go through life you recognize that\nyou're preparing yourself for that thing\nwhen it's going to come you don't know\nwhat it is it could be you may have to\npull someone out of a car that has been\nlike crashed and you may have you may\nneed the physical strength to like open\na piece of metal that has been wedged\nand whether you do it or not depends on\nyour physical like ability which means\nyou have to get in shape because\notherwise that person could die it may\nbe like creating a product or saving the\nworld through like climate change or\ninventing a new solar panel and maybe\nhelping an individual person it may be\ncreating a video game that keeps someone\nfrom killing themselves because they're\ndepressed and at least there's some game\nthat gives people a sense of community\nlike I have no idea what it is\nbut you guys should be terrified\nyou should be terrified and if you don't\nknow what your Dharma is prepare prepare\nin every way possible it doesn't matter\nwhat your term is you're gonna need to\nbe in good physical shape because\nultimately your capacity to your Dharma\ndepends on your physical capability so\ntreat your body well and treat your mind\nwell because whether you rise to the\nchallenge it depends on like what you\nare right study study what you can about\nyourself if you have a general direction\nlike if you feel like you want to write\na book then like learn about writing if\nyou feel like you want to create an app\nand that's what interests you then like\ntake courses online like check out Khan\nAcademy or like do Google certifications\non analytics like I don't care what it\nis just study and learn and prepare for\nthat day that you are going to need to\ndo the thing if you think you missed\nyour chance you're wrong you missed a\nchance that's part of your karma the\nmissed chance is the thing that teaches\nyou hey man this is legit so you better\nget your ass ready for the next one\nthere is no such thing as a missed\nchance a missed chance doesn't mean that\nyou're not gonna have more chances in\nthe future like I want you guys to\nunderstand this very clearly if you\nthink that you've missed the boat you\ndidn't miss the boat like if I'm working\nin the emergency room and someone comes\nin and I don't recognize they have a\nheart attack and they die that doesn't\nmean that someone else isn't gonna come\nin an hour from now missing the boat is\nnot like a one time thing\ndonger McCall's again and again and\nagain and again and again\nand you can fail again and again and\nagain and again and again so time to get\nyour ass into gear prepare prepare\nprepare miss the fortnight bus hey guys\nI don't know if you guys realize this\nbut like fortnight is not gonna be the\nbiggest game for the history of humanity\neven in your lifetimes like maybe even\nin a year or two there's gonna be\nanother game that's gonna be bigger than\nfortnight huh did that you missed the\nfortnight bus oh my god that's the last\ngame eSports is over now you missed your\nchance to be a stream or it's done like\nit's almost like you guys are saying\nlike okay I miss my chance to be like a\nfortnight's streamer like imagine a\nworld where on Twitch people became\nsuccessful streamers doing things\nbesides playing video games like talking\nto people about their feelings so\nprepare yourself you have no idea what\nthe world will demand of you you have no\nidea prepare"
