    "transcript": "which is really what you should\nacknowledge is that sometimes just bad\n[ __ ] happens and you don't deserve it\nbut your inability to like experience\nthat means that you've got this weird\nlike you're like a septic tank that's\njust full and like never drains because\nlike bad [ __ ] happens to you and happens\nto you and happens to you and no one and\nyou just blame yourself and so like no\nlike the blame just sits within you\nyou're like just just the cesspool of\nyou know stuff\nso welcome and what am I welcome LS is\nthat what we're calling you yeah okay\nyeah I guess okay and everyone is trying\nto confuse me what is trying to tell me\nI don't know what that means is that\nshort for something so it meant last\nshadow up until 2012 but the reason that\neveryone means it is\nI don't know they've changed the Ellen\nthe s2 whatever is needed to fit I mean\ngot it nice so it's a very dynamic yeah\nyeah so if I dr k is dr k or dr.\nkangaroo or the democratic republic of\nkorea yeah exactly exactly\nokay okay so tell me um tell me a little\nbit about what we're talking about today\nand how so yeah so initially I didn't\nwant to come on the stream but then more\nand more requests and I just figured\nI've talked about my life story a few\ntimes on stream in the past and so I\nfigured it would be no different than\njust talking about it with you and so I\nguess we'll just talk about that um I\nwent through III I had tweeted out jump\nin for a second yeah God so why can you\nhelp me understand the feelings of not\nwanting to come on stream because those\nare like very reasonable feelings I'm\nsure so okay so every single time I've\ntalked about the life short story I've\nalways downloaded the bottom then\ndeleted it and the the reason being is\nbecause I didn't want anyone to twist\nanything but I would say and then if\nanyone ever attempted to I had the bog\ndownloaded in case someone tried saying\nthat I said something I didn't but also\nit was always something that I just did\nto try to help people relate or try to\nhelp people understand that depression\nis a really weird thing and that anxiety\nis a demon as well and that there's ways\nto\nget through it alright see I don't know\nhow to like word this basically III\nstruggle every single day ever every\nsingle day is a complete nightmare and\nyet I'm here and I've been dealing with\nthis now for the last 17 years of my\nlife though yeah pretty pretty much that\nI don't want to have this stuff that I\ntalk about used against me and it has\nbeen in this industry specifically\nseveral times even even within the last\ncouple of years I've had my diagnosis\nactually brought up in reference to my\nstability or my ability to do certain\nthings and that always has just struck\nme as odd because it's clearly never\nimpeded me up to this point and then I\nnever intend to let it do as such so\nthat's impressive that you know you've\ndone such a good job with these\ndiagnoses and also really sucks that\npeople have used that against you like\nvery just like discreetly like\nexplicitly used it against you yeah but\nI think it's I think it's standard I I\nthink mental illness is just taboo and\nthen especially out here in Korea mental\nillness is really really taboo I can\nimagine so it's that compact yeah that\ncompounded with a lot of things is\ndefinitely interesting you know\ninteresting thing about mental illness\nin Korea and taboo apparently what's not\ntaboo there is video game addiction or\nat least not as taboo as it is here in\nthe sense that I've heard that they're\nactually like brick and mortar buildings\nthat treat video game addiction like\nthey're they have like video game\naddiction clinics in South Korea\nright okay I don't I don't know about\nthat I don't have video game Academy is\nthe best school the best research about\nso okay we got a level 4 hype train ok I\ndon't know what that means I still don't\nunderstand the stuff but so so the best\nresearch on video game addiction\nactually comes out of Korea and that's\nbecause they treat it the most seriously\nand they've been treating him for a\nwhile but okay so I'm sorry that people\nhave used it against you I really hope\nthat that doesn't happen here and I'm\nreally grateful that you're coming on\nand actually the mission that you've\nbeen adopting which is sort of like\nshowing people that you can struggle\nwith depression or anxiety or whatnot\nand still have you know hopefully a\nhealthy I'm clear to me if you're happy\nbut I wouldn't call it a fake no yeah so\nthat is unfortunate let's see if we can\ndo something about that\nokay I I to think that you know mental\nillness is stigmatized and a lot of what\nI do here is is to D stigmatize it and I\nguess it's good that a lot of people who\nafter watching the stream or giving\ntherapy a shot which i think is\nfantastic just any clear though you know\nthis is not therapy and you understand\nthat right yeah okay so tell me a little\nbit about what what you mean by\ndepression or anxiety\nI guess my depression is nothing nothing\nreally matters to me it's it's like a\nit's like a form of summit syndrome what\ndoes that mean I remember summit\nsyndrome being that every single time\nyou hit what you set as the highest goal\nit's not enough there's just an\nemptiness there's a void there's nothing\nthat satisfactory I remember because I\nwas actually homeless twice even in\nKorea and I remember one time in 2013 I\nwas I was living in Busan with my\nboyfriend at the time and I only had a\ncouple hundred dollars to my name and I\nremember thinking that I was supposed to\npotentially get a job casting\npotentially for StarCraft actually and\nif I got that I had envisioned like you\nknow I would be making more money and I\nthought that that money would be like\nvery glorious or very enjoyable and\nabout a year and a half later in\nentirely different circumstances I ended\nup having that amount of income and more\nand I just felt empty and it wasn't\nenough and then I look back on it and\nI'm like but I I'm somewhere now where I\ndreamed of being before and then I had\nanother milestone and it didn't do\nanything and then I had another\nmilestone and it did nothing and nothing\nwould really I mean still nothing really\nbrings me happiness it brings me to\nneutrality and the neutrality is a\ncalmness it's like someone's sitting on\nyou and when they eventually get up it\njust feels like a lot of relief\nI have glimpses of that very rarely\nnowadays but I would I would probably\nsay that's what my happiness is because\nit feels like there's no wait there's no\npressure\nthere's no\nnoise III refer to as noise when all the\nimages just keep raising peaceful\nno not peaceful okay just feels like I\ncan breathe or it feels like I can I can\nhear my own thoughts without the images\nracing in my mind's and I can\nI don't feel the tension all across my\nbody\nI don't feel the sensation of like did\nyou drop your wallet in your back pocket\nyou know and did you just forget it on a\ntrain or something you just have someone\nsteal something from you I feel that\nnever ending all the time and some\nmornings it's really hard to obviously\nget out of bed and other mornings or\nnights or something I just don't want to\ndo anything sometimes in front of the\nstream I'll sit there with the stream\nlabs open for 30 minutes 45 minutes and\nI just can't hit play and people don't\nrealize it but anytime there's a\nnecessity to do something fear always\nmotivates me and so I would say that\nfear is my number one motivator in my\nentire life fear of ever going back to\nwhat I was at before and obviously the\npoverty the homelessness\nTravie lack of security the pre Korea so\nI don't think look so do you think fear\nin your life is a good thing or a bad\nthing\nI guess kept me alive\nso III III would it's weird to say that\nobviously it's it's not good that this\nis what's necessary to keep me walking\nor something but there's nothing else\nyes I'll ask you again is is fear in\nyour life a good thing or a bad thing I\nrealize I'm oversimplifying the question\nbut I'm doing it no I know I identify\nthat inherently it's bad but as it\nstands right now it's good it's very\ngood so it's important for you to\nunderstand that right so I wouldn't even\nsay inherently it's bad I'd say\ntheoretically it's bad is that a better\nway to throat it yeah right so like\nwe've heard that fear is bad and to live\na life based on fear as your primary\nemotion sounds like it sucks but for you\nit's actually very very important yeah\nand so the dangerous thing here is that\nyou're living a life where there's\nprobably a very large part of you that\ndoesn't want the fear to leave\nyeah but III don't chase it though I\ndon't put myself in circumstances where\nI would feel more fair than I would have\nto yeah I don't seek it I I never want\nto induce more fear yes but I do notice\nthat if I if I tend to get lazy or if I\ntend to get complacent for too long yet\nit enhances a lot and then I go into\noverdrive and then the cycle begins so I\nthink this is yeah go ahead sorry keep\ngoing oh sorry\noh my monitors just went out because no\nmouse activity sorry okay go ahead no\nyou were saying something\nno it tends to operate and in cycles and\nI have identified that it's in cycles\nand I've in recent years tried to become\nmore cognizant of the cycles and habits\nand patterns that exist and I've tried\nto manage them time them identify\ntriggers all this other stuff and\nobviously compounding off all the stuff\nthat I've learned from all the years of\ntherapy all the clinicians all the\npsychologists psychiatrists everything\nI've ever read and it's all just about\nmanaging it and trying to identify it\nbut it honestly it feels really [ __ ]\nhopeless and again there's no purpose\nbut\nuh I don't know how I would phrase this\nI must do what I'm doing now\nin case there is eventually a purpose\nyeah absolutely that's that I don't have\na choice yeah I mean what are you\nfeeling right now\nI just don't have a choice everything I\ndo I don't have a choice how does I mean\nI have I have a choice in regards to do\nI want to string today do I not want to\nstring today I have a choice of do I\nwant to sign this contract do I not want\nto sign this contract but the fear\nultimately decides through whatever type\nof rationale used what is most optimal\nor what is what is most logical in order\nto further separate me from what is\ncausing the fear and so then I always\njust keep what is it like\nI don't know but I'm thankful that I\ndidn't have a choice because I think if\nI had choices I wouldn't have ended up\nhere or maybe it maybe I would have\nbecause of the the thing I mentioned to\nyou prior to coming on the stream in\nregards to one of my last psychiatrists\ngave me the choice to go on disability\ninsurance and I didn't want to what do\nyou mean by that if you had a choice you\nwouldn't be here what does that mean if\nI could if there was alternative ways\nfor me to have just functioned without\nbeing thrown by the wayside because I\nwas facing homelessness in the United\nStates and I didn't have really any way\nto return to so what was the option end\nup on the streets or end up doing\ngod-knows-what I I don't really know can\nyou hold on a second yeah yeah just\nproblem I'm gonna just think for a\nsecond mm-hmm sorry I didn't mean to\ndisrupt your flow but no that's okay\nthere's a lot that you're saying that I\nthink is very important the thing is\nit's coming out at such a pace that I'm\nfeeling hard it's it's hard for me to\nkeep track of some of the things you're\nsaying sorry I looked at Twitter shot\nthey're very funny\nI won't I'll keep chat yeah a PM is way\ntoo high it's like a manner pause when\nI'm getting xored rushed yeah five pull\nLSS five pulled me oh five blast birdboy\nyeah man\nold school that is that's boomer\ntechnology that is five full I pledge no\ncool yeah there you go\nokay can you tell me what your\nexperience was like with with treaters\ntreaters like clinicians inside I\nremember the first one I was ever that I\never went to my mom told me that I had\nto go see someone\nand I didn't know why was and when mom\nsaid you had to go see someone\nso I I had a lot of doctors growing up\nbecause I was always really sick I had\nthree nebulizer treatments a day I had\nan allergen allergen an asthma doctor\nthat I would see a couple of times a\nweek I was on benadryl twice a day or as\nneeded albuterol as needed I was always\nreally sick and so I had my usual\nstalkers and then my mom told me that I\nhad to go see another doctor and I\ndidn't know why and I arrived at this\ndoctor's office and I started talking to\nhim and he just told me that there was a\nlot of weird stuff with me like socially\nand apparently it's because I didn't get\nalong with my little league teammates or\nsomething because my mom had signed me\nup for baseball and I didn't get along\nwith them and I didn't socialize with\nthem I wouldn't talk to them and\nwhatever and she found the behavior very\navoidin or very antisocial and she\nthought that it was very alarming\nbecause my mom is in psychiatry as well\nand so then she had sent me to a doctor\nfor you know she's identifying the signs\nor patterns or whatever so that that's\nwhat uh that's what was going on there I\ngot to him and he was telling me that\nthere was concerning behaviors and I I\ndidn't know what the hell he was talking\nabout the reality in my eyes what it was\nis\nmy uncle's had started me on everything\nway earlier than my peers and so what I\nmean by that is like age four or five\nthey were teaching me like math or stuff\nabout like riddles or puzzles and stuff\nway before you know first grade second\ngrade third graders is supposed to know\nabout this stuff but also anything that\nI did with sports my uncle's would drill\nme on quite literally so Wells you\nquestion II would be yeah I got do you\nget to be who you are uh no well it\ndepends what you mean everyone that ever\nmeets me offline says I'm I'm always\ndifferent than what they believe me to\nbe from my stream persona or that\nthere's a lot of different modes of me\nand I would agree well I wouldn't agree\nI I would agree that there's different\nmodes depending on what people around me\nare doing and what that means in terms\nof yeah believe so\ncan you tell me about that person um I\nknow I know I'm very bitter and I know\nI'm very angry at time lost and I\ndisplaced blame a lot on other things\nthat I felt like was outside of my\ncontrol or that was unjust and I've\ntried to find ways to forgive it\nor let it go if that makes sense\nbut then wait I care about you displace\nblame on things that are outside of your\ncontrol\nyeah like I was between placing blame on\nthings that are outside of your control\nin displacing things that are outside of\nyour control like that there's there's\ndual purpose in the sense that maybe\nthere was alternatives so there was\ndifferent options that I could have\ntaken that maybe I wasn't aware of at\nthe time and so maybe my belief that was\noutside of my control isn't totally just\nso you blame ourselves for things that\nare outside of your control I ponder if\nif it if I should blame myself\nI I perceive it to be outside of my\ncontrol\nbut then when I go through and I do the\nrodeo with myself from my younger years\nor even current years I try to think was\nit my fault so let me tell you what I'm\nhearing okay yeah so I think you're a\nsmart guy and I think sometimes that\nmakes life hard because you're able to\nthink through things and understand\nthings but there's this is a subtle\nsubtle point and maybe I'm making a\nmountain out of a molehill\nyou said you displace things you\ndisplace blame on things that are\noutside of your control so when I think\nabout displaced blame I think about\nsomeone who's like not attributing blame\nto where it belongs\nright so if you displace blame onto me\nfor something that is your fault that is\nlike it's not really my fault it's\nactually your fault and that you\ndisplace that blame onto external things\nthat are outside of your control that\nimplies to me that you actually blame\nyourself for things that outside of your\ncontrol yes because I I think that there\nI know that sounds really weird but I\nbecause of the rodeo that I've been\nthrough I sort of do blame myself for\nthese things yes yeah\nyeah okay but we're gonna put a pin in\nthat we're gonna come back to it okay\nokay tell me about your uncle's my\nuncle's got me into gaming really early\non started with Zelda Link to the Past\nand Final Fantasy 3 when I was like two\nand three years old and then three\nshadow it's actually what my ID is from\nflash shadow and so did you save an\nabsolutely yeah you know and it gotta\nget gogo and amaru and all of them so\nyou know III love Final Fantasy 3 it's\nbest FF yeah okay all right so then\nTekken killer instincts\nSaturday night slam masters combats my\nuncles were really competitive at games\nyeah their sister your sisters brothers\nmy mother yes sir others brothers yeah\nmy mother is 15 years nine months older\nthan me my uncle\none of my uncle's is 14 years older than\nme and my other uncle is seven years\nnine months older than me and so they\nwere sort of just like big brothers and\nso they got me into gaming really early\non they got me into a lot of stuff\nreally early on they got me thinking\ncritically because my you know they\nwould do different stuff they used to\nplay like Mortal Kombat they would take\nit really serious they travel or on to\narcades and stuff they would they would\nwrite down combos they would write down\nHP percentages you know were you it was\nfun it was exciting I remember because\nthey used well sometimes they'd have\ntheir high school friends come over and\nthey would have them play against me\nlike for fun and their friends would\nthink it's a joke or something and then\nthey would lose to a four-year-old yeah\nso I I used to think it was so fun put\nthose noobs in their place exactly\nso I'm gonna do man listen yeah if you\nguys take nothing else away from the\nstream you got to understand that your\nmission of life is to put noobs in their\nplace you got to do no one else is gonna\ndo it unless you rise to the challenge\nso that's that's how it started and then\nthere was a time attack mode and\npunch-out and super punch-out on Super\nNintendo and then sometimes they do like\nhow fast they could complete Mario\nlevels and so I was always thinking like\nabout stuff like puzzles and speed okay\nand then I had a very early headstart on\nlike math English everything I mean how\ndid you do you remember how you felt\nduring that time um I felt really good\nto be included or not I felt really cool\nto be hanging out with my uncles and I\nfelt really cool that I was getting to\nlearn stuff that my friends didn't but\nthen it also made me feel detached from\nmy friends okay did you like being\nyourself I liked learning and I was\ncourse I was actually bullied for it uh\nwell I was I was bullied a lot all my\nlife up until high school mostly because\nI was a kid laughs again I was the sick\nkid so I always went to the nurse's\noffice I had super super pale skin my\nhair was like bleach blond white and so\nI looked kind of like gross and my\nclothes weren't like the best and stuff\nso the fact that I was like very nerdy\nand into games and like math and\nlearning stuff and reading books and it\nwasn't very good and in kindergarten\nelementary school junior high I'm gonna\nask questions that are just all over the\nplace so hey allergies so you said that\nyou had some problems with like\nallergies and asthma and stuff like that\nand you were taking AB you Lizer\ntreatments\nare you still in treatment for like a\ntopic stuff like asthma or\nso I actually have my ad bear behind me\nI've had to use it more this year than I\nhave in the last ten which i think is\njust sort of coincidence but I've\nactually had to ask my attacks this year\nwhich is pretty scary it's pretty weird\nbecause I haven't I haven't struggled\nwith my asthma since I was a teenager\nonce puberty hit my asthma sort of just\nwent away but my my allergies was\nbecause I had a dog growing up her name\nwas Sasha and after she passed for some\nreason I was allergic to every cat and\nevery dog like really really really\nabout allergies I was allergic to dust\npollen grass everything um yeah I was\nalso tested I had to go to Mass General\nbecause they tested me for cystic\nfibrosis because my husband was so bad\nyep makes sense\nyeah give me a second I'm gonna think\nyou\nyou\nyou\nI'm gonna need another minute okay\nyou\nokay okay so I'm gonna ask you like a\ncouple of one-off questions and then I'm\ngonna ask you stuff that's a little bit\nmore like well like you know you can\ntalk more\nare you are you angry with yourself\nAlice I mean yes I'm with myself and at\nmyself\nhow long have you is a with myself is\nobviously an internal and then out\nmyself as external yeah how long have\nyou been feeling that way since I can\nremember okay\nI know kind of a random question right\nno it makes sense why does it make sense\nidentifying internal self-worth as well\nas external perception of oneself I mean\nI have audio how I then how I view\nmyself from an external standpoint as\nwell as how do I feel internally about\nmaybe how I perceive myself so it's sort\nof both ways like you can feel that your\noutward appearance or how your\nperception of you is or you can\nacknowledge it as such and then\ninternally feel something totally\ndifferent but you I'm okay I still don't\nunderstand it both yeah what is that\nangry at both what are you angry at\num I'm angry my inability to obviously\nsolve this problem right oh that has\nplagued me the entire time\nand I'm angry at a lot of it who's a\nproblem well I I think that that's a\nreally loaded question right I I don't\nknow how to answer that\nI I mean if it why is it a load of\ndefecation\n[Music]\nwell it's no one's problem right but my\nI mean it's it's no one thing or person\nin particular it would be a it would be\na culmination of things potentially\nright environment or whatever else or it\ncould be chemical imbalance I have no\nidea it's so many things yeah\nso it's hard for me pinpoint okay yeah\nyou're absolutely correct it could be a\nlot of different things um okay so but\nyou're angry with yourself for not being\nable to fix this thing yeah and despite\na lot of efforts despite a lot of\nefforts right so what is that so it\nultimately feels like failure because\none of the things I strive to do and\nanything that I do analytically or\ncreatively is try to identify problems\nunderstand how they work how they\noperate their foundation why they are\nthe way that they are and then try to\nbreak them down like that but yeah\nobviously with myself can't\nso is it it when you say you can't\nyou're saying that you've tried and it\nhasn't worked trying trying trying and\nfailing yeah okay\nyou are incredibly resilient yeah yeah I\nguess yeah do you but it's sort of like\nwhat I yeah I I'm cognizant of that but\nagain it goes back to the original thing\nthat we talked about earlier it's do in\ncase there is in the sense of there's no\npurpose yet but in the event there is\none I must do now okay there's no time\nfor breaks can you can you tell me a\nlittle bit about your experiences with\nclinicians what's that what's that been\nlike there was only three of them that\nwere really good and the three of them\nthat were really good they were they\nwere all female if that matters because\nmaybe there's something about that\nalthough I don't tend to have a\npreference anymore I guess a male to\nfemale but I remember when I was younger\nfemale was my preference for people to\ntalk to and who I felt comfortable with\nmm-hmm\none of them I had three different times\nbecause of the health insurance program\nallowed me to have them and because I\nwas double covered I could basically\nhave them for one block on one health\ninsurance card and then another block\nand another health insurance card and\nthen I had them one more time per week\nyou need no no block I think a block was\nsix months okay these were like programs\nand all three of these women crossed\nlines and what I mean by cross lines is\nI felt like they they went to bat for me\nin ways that other therapists or\npsychologists didn't and I know that\nthey definitely did things that I think\ncould have lost them their job and in\nregards to things that they said to my\nparents\nin defense of me or even even my school\nboard one of them outright basically\nmade the direct statement that the the\nthe environment in my household was to\nblame for everything that was going on\nand that the constant deflection and\nlooking to constantly pull me and put me\nin new doctors or clinicians in order to\nget one that agreed with what they\nthought was part of the problem and that\nthat was the toxicity in itself sounds I\nremember the various I remember the the\nlast night the last psychiatrist that I\ndidn't go to I had an evaluation with\none of my parents just walked out on the\nsession a due to something that was said\nwhich I don't want to go into I'm sure I\ndream but it was definitely it was it\nwas a holy [ __ ] that just happened\nmoment for me because I never up there\nto me something I felt like\n[ __ ] cheering or something like I\nfelt like crying because this guy just I\ndon't know like snapped his fingers\nwithin an hour and just said I know\nwhat's going on here and said it\npoint-blank I had to walk home that day\nit was it was a six mile walk home so I\ngot like to hug his office um I was I\nwas alone when I got home I was alone a\nlot from 13 to 17 I was alone a lot\nthe other two therapists that you said\nwere really good were not this\npsychiatrist these are other women who\nwent nowhere yeah\nthey were in the same program as whereas\nthat sounds so basically once the\nprogram would cut one of the clinicians\nI would move on to another one\nmm-hm and so there were just cycles and\ncover yeah what so what did they do that\nfrom the appointments the appointments\nwere only supposed to be like one hour\nbut they would go over by a lot just to\ntalk about random stuff I know that the\nexpenses were only supposed to cover\nlike $10 per visit because we would we\nwould drive somewhere like a coffee shop\nor a cafe but they would pay\nout-of-pocket so we could go nicer\nplaces and to my knowledge\nIII don't know if they did this with\nother clients or something but it felt\nnice but we talked about like a lot of\nyeah it sort of felt like a mom I know\nthat sound and it sounds really weird\nbut that's how it it's it really I\nlooked forward to the the therapy\nappointments because they were common it\nfelt like I could talk to someone that\nwasn't judging me about anything and\nthat actually cared about what I was\nsaying to them okay\nso we've got a couple of options LS yeah\nthe first is there are some things that\nI can just I can just start talking and\nsort of share what I think with you at\nthis point the chances that I'm wrong or\nway higher them the chances that I'm\nright because I'm gonna make a lot of\nreally bold claims I don't know I think\na piece of that is gonna be almost like\nego gratifying because I feel like I\nunderstand you and I understand a lot of\nyour problems I don't know that that\nactually helps you though because that's\nI think that's really more for my\nbenefit and showmanship than actually\ntrying to help you so\nor but but I also sort of do recognize\nthat sometimes when people talk to me\nand you know they're they're not looking\nto necessarily be asked a thousand\nquestions they're really looking more\nfor answers so I'll kind of leave it up\nto you what would you rather have me do\nbecause I still have a lot of questions\nthat I want to ask and I can try to walk\nyou to things in a little bit probably\nmore productive way although it'll be\nslower or we can kind of jump to the\npunch line of the joke but chances are\nthat it's not going to be as funny\nbecause I haven't said the whole joke\nlike the punchline is only funny if you\nlike hear the whole joke right yeah so\nwhat what do you want to do should I ask\nyou more questions or should I share\nsome thoughts you can ask more if you\nwant because I mean we're barely\ntouching on age 13 it gets really bad\nthe next few years that's when that's\nwhen the therapy kicked up to 25 30\nhours that's the hospitalizations that's\nthe the suicide stuff that's the yeah\nthat'sthat's the dark period that's the\nnot going to school the truancy the\ncourts the wayward petitions the judges\njuvenile detention center yeah that's\nall of that stuff I know this is gonna\nsound strange but I'm not so interested\nin that okay I know it's weird but I\nknow I think I think that's sort of the\nI don't know how to put this beyond I\nthink that the setup for all that stuff\nhas already happened okay\nbut if you'd like me to ask you more\nquestions I have questions kind of not\nso much about the details because I mean\nkind of I know you've watched dreams\nbefore so sometimes people will talk\nlike you know they'll start talking\nabout for example bipolar disorder\nanxiety\nwe don't necessarily go into that stuff\nI think a lot of that stuff is\nclinically very relevant but I I don't\nknow that what I'm doing I mean what I'm\ndoing here is not clinical so in a sense\na lot of those very important details\nlike don't get me wrong incredibly\nimportant I have no doubt that that's\nactually vitally important stuff but\nwhat I'm sensing from you is like like\nsomething that's a little bit more\nfundamental in terms of the way that you\nlook at yourself the way that you formed\nin an opinion about yourself the way\nthat you were treated and what has\nworked in therapy so like\nso what what I mean we can talk more\nabout your history if you'd like but\nthat's not the direction of questions\nthat I have although we may get there\nI'm not so interested in details I'm\ninterested in sort of your sense of how\nyou experience certain things and how\nyou view certain model so more questions\nas you think best to proceed I've gone\ndown so many different lines if that's\nwhat you want to call them with\ndifferent therapy sessions all right you\nknow what I mean let's ask let's ask\ntwitch chat then twitch chat what should\nwe do should we do questions or share\nour thoughts\nquestions okay ask more okay so tinny\ntell me a little bit about you said your\nmom was a is in psychiatry she works on\nthe psychiatric unit okay and is it okay\nif I ask in what capacity\nmmm I don't want to give away too much\nokay sure\nI'm not run yeah no I mean there's a\nreason why I asked is it okay if I ask\nyeah yeah I'm curious cuz um okay and\nyou haven't mentioned anything about\nyour dad um my dad uh so he was autumn I\nhe was in my life until like four or\nfive and then he disappeared until I was\nlike nine or ten and then he was in and\nout my stepmother\nhowever is active she's actively still\nin my life along with my grandmother\nI've talked to my mother I've seen my\nmother once in the last decade and I've\ntalked to her less than a handful of\ntimes but I haven't talked to her now in\nfour years he life father it's by my\nchoice I tried to make I tried to make\nstuff hat or work or something the last\ntime I was there or in Rhode Island that\nwas worlds 2016 and it didn't seem like\nthere was anything I could say or do\nthat would allow us to not be stuck in\n2008 or 2009 or anything like that are\nyou guys stuck in 2008 and 2004 we get\nthere let me ask you something yeah in\nyour professional career yeah when\npeople talk about depression and it\nimpacts you negatively does it feel like\npeople are using a part of you against\nyou\nit feels like a cop-out because anyone\nwho's willing to use something like that\nagainst me doesn't possess enough\nknowledge of it in the first off to even\ntalk about it second off to make that\nassertion and then third off it I think\nit shows on a pretty surface level that\nthey're they're ignorant and they're not\nwilling to go deeper because there's so\nmany questions that can branch out from\nmmm-hmm depression that's so far more\nrational and collected answer than I was\nexpecting\nit's a far more forgiving answer than I\nwas expecting\nokay how are you with forgiveness I tend\nnot to hold grudges and with other\nplayed yeah with other people and I can\nI can feel a lot of vindictive feelings\nin in very brief moments but if I know\nthem to be wrong or unjust or something\nelse it doesn't really matter to me all\nthat much so you're I've had like a\nvindictiveness or anger towards others\ndon't matter they don't matter because I\nI realized that it doesn't do anything\nlike I don't I don't know how to explain\nthis but like nothing good comes of it I\nI've had I've had a lot of money stolen\nfrom me for instance in recent years by\npeople that were close to me or people\nthat had access to my like PayPal Gmail\netc right people that I had trusted or\nconfided him and at the end of the day\num it wasn't enough to make me lose\nsleep and there was reasons that they\nwere in that spot that they felt like\nthey had to do that and so I tried to\nyou know recover or get back as much as\nI possibly could and for what I couldn't\nit's my fault\nand even if they made a bad choice in a\nbad action I could have done more\npreventive measures which I do now but I\ndon't [ __ ] here because it's not\nsomething that caused me harm I think\nthe only things that I would ever hold\nsevere grudges over is maybe something\nthat attempted to seriously harm me but\nI haven't encountered something like\nthat I'm lying I'm sorry I'm not like\nI'm not intentionally lying there's one\nthing but I won't talk about it under\nstream that happened two and a half ago\nlet me just let me see if I understand\nyou when someone steals money from you\nwhose fault is it ultimately it's mine\nbecause I I gave the person the ability\nto do that\nokay and there's ways that I could have\nprevented it which I know now so even\nthough they made the choice I made\nmyself vulnerable so there's definitely\na way where we can say that it's not my\nfault but because I know now what I\ndidn't know then it just wouldn't happen\nnow compared to before how long is your\nfault\nI think most things are I think most bad\nthings that end up happening to me I end\nup looking back at it and being like\nyeah I could have made a different play\nor I took the I took how long have\nthings been your fault anything bad\nsince I can remember of course okay now\nI'm gonna share some thoughts hmm hold\non a second\ndo you blame your mom for y'all's\nrelationship I try to understand her\npoint of view which I was I I think now\nyou try to hide your point of view both\nI try to empathize with her\ndo you like if I had yes I try to do\nboth and then I get stuck in this this\nweird limbo where I don't know what to\nthink like I try to imagine if I had an\n11 year old right now holy [ __ ] I don't\n[ __ ] know what I would do but also\nwhat would that have done to me at 17 18\n19 20 21 I can't how do you empathize\nwith yourself what what that was that\nwas very helpful by the way when you\nsort of said like if I had an 11 year\nold right now I don't know what I would\ndo so you try to put yourself in her\nshoes you try to be understanding even\nwhen it sounds like people are like\nsteal money from you you sort of try to\nunderstand that they were in a desperate\nof desperation a lot a lot of people see\npeople with problems and they don't care\nabout\nwell what made them that way there's\nalways a story doesn't just happen\nunless we're talking about psychopathy\nor something but that's a different\ndemon you don't look at people who are\nactively stealing or they're doing\nthings and think that's just who they\nare\nno that's who they became as a byproduct\nof so Alice how did you become the way\nthat you are what is a story\nwhat made you into the person that you\nare so I think the way that I perceive\nthings I think is obviously a byproduct\nof the way that my uncle's race or\nraised me in terms of like how I think\nlike structured or puzzles and whatnot\nbut I think that the lack of Russian\naffection okay sorry yeah the the lack\nof affection and emotional stuff stems\nfrom I think no one ever really\nunderstood me from my family\ndue to an accelerated childhood leading\nto me feeling detached from my peers\naround me to to feeling intellectually\naccelerated than them thus creating a\ndisconnect okay okay stop cetera et\ncetera well I mean this that was my yeah\nall right okay LS so there's one thing\nright so one is that no one asks the\nquestion of why they became why they're\ndoing the things that they're doing and\nhow they got to be that way right and\nthen I asked you the question which is\nactually the first question how did you\nbecome the way that you are but I think\nthe real question is who didn't ask why\nyou are the way you are who didn't give\nyou the benefit of the doubt that you\ngive everyone who hurts you that that's\nthat's that's the very question for\ntherapists that meant the most to me\nasked the school board the same way that\nyou just phrased it almost\nand I remember I remember the room that\nday I just remember the look on\neveryone's face\nbecause obviously it no one does ask\nthat\ncan you hear me yeah okay what was the\nquestion that they added that she asked\nthe school board she asked the school\nboard all of you got all of you were\ntalking about the things that he's doing\nor why he's behaving this way but none\nof you are asking why or what's causing\nhim to act like this and the look on\neveryone's face including my mother's\nwas just they were stupefied\nas if they obviously don't have an\nexplanation because they're ignoring\nmrs. so it that felt really good\nbecause I knew obviously there's reasons\nI'm doing the things that I'm doing and\nit just felt like no one cared about\nwhat I felt or how I was feeling because\nI I felt so out of place growing up\nconstantly\nyeah I mean I've always thought alone\nI still feel alone which maybe is I mean\nwe can get into this maybe later on but\nlike there's lots of people around me\nand I I try to allow my house to be open\nto like pros that want to come out here\nin bootcamp or I try to help boot\ncampers get set up and stuff cuz it's\nstuff that I would have been Droid when\nI was younger or that I needed when I\nwas younger but also I realized that\nmaybe there's like a there's a there's a\ncompound there where I'm extremely\nlonely and so it's a way of feeling like\nthere's family okay yeah I'm gonna share\nsome thoughts and I think we had we were\nskirting on the surface of some stuff\nthat I thought was pretty significant\nbut I I'm not quite sure why so first\nthing Ellis is I think I think you can\nget better and I think you can feel\nbetter let me put it that way I don't\nthink you have to continue feeling the\nway that you are and I don't think that\nit is your fault that you feel the way\nthat you do and I think that the\nchallenge here is that\nno one showed you how to cut yourself a\nbreak for your behavior\nand you don't cut yourself a break you\nwrite you you sort of ask the question\nyou come up with a beautiful intelligent\nhighly accurate theory about why you are\nthe way that you are but you don't\nyou don't let that take the bite out of\nyour self-hatred\nthe goal of saying that there like this\nkid is not so like the goal of asking\nwhy is this kid acting out is to explain\nto everyone and for everyone to be on\nthe same page that it's not this kids\nfault that he's not succeeding\nand so I think that you you're able to\nconstruct a theory of like why you're\nthe way that you are but I don't think\nyou let that theory absolve you of\nresponsibility\nthat make sense yeah no my sons and our\nthat's a fancy ass way of saying\nforgiveness which is something that I\nthink is very alien to you when it comes\nto you so you blame yourself for all\nkinds of things even when it's not your\nfault and this starts with the\ndisplacing blame and then ends up with\nthis frankly really [ __ ] weirdly\ncognitively distorted thing about when\npeople steal from you it's their fault\nand like I get that if your Buddha or\nJesus fine but you're not and neither am\ni so there's something weird going on\nthere and so then we get to all kinds of\njudge this is just weird I mean this is\n[ __ ] weird so first of all very very\nsevere asthma allergy benadryl three\nnebulizers a day that resolves around\nteenagers so asthma gets better and\nteenagers people tend to grow out of it\nbut we're talking about a very very\nsevere illness that basically disappears\nand then is gone for a decade what\nhappens people grow out of it absolutely\nhappens allergies that get to cats and\ndogs that get worse after a cat dies dog\ndog yeah it's kind of weird\nthousands of hours of therapy shunting\nyou off to treat er after treat her\nafter treat her because you're sick and\nyou're broken\nwho thought you were sick and broken my\nentire mother's side of the family my\ndad didn't know what to think and my\nstepmother thought that I was fine okay\nso this sounds like some I mean I'm\ngonna toss out a word that is that is\nsort of a diagnostic thing which I I'm\nnot trying to be irresponsible because I\nhave no way of diagnosing this I don't\nknow I don't have one percent of the\ninformation that I should have before\nusing these words this is some\nMunchausen's by proxy level [ __ ] man do\nyou know what that is\nyeah that's so\nyeah Munchausen is when the the the\nparent over medicates the child and\nactually makes them sick\nI know all about it it was looked into\nduring my adolescence and stuff it was a\nvery big argument during custody so so\nlike I don't know that this actually is\nwhat happened but like I'm getting the\nsense because I've seen this before\nwhere like it's like someone has the\nperception that the child is just sick\nand needs to be fixed and needs to be\nfixed and needs to be fixed and since\nit's get sense to treat her and treat\nher and treat her and treat her and\ntreat her and I have no doubt that you\nknow you actually had symptoms and stuff\nlike that because a lot of these have\nlike objective tests and it's not that\nit's all psychological I mean so like\nyour your physical health seems very\npsychosomatic to me which means that\nthere's an influence of mind and body\nwhich is sort of like what I am\ninterested in and so it sort of makes\nsense like you know I'd be wondering if\nyou if you've had two asthma attacks\nover the last year like what's been\ngoing on so there's like good evidence\nthat stress makes atopic disease worse\nso you have atopic disease asthma\nallergies things like that eczema is\nanother thing that you may have so like\nthese are all atopic diseases that are\nreduced to stress chronic inflammatory\ndiseases that relate to stress this is\nweird the other thing is that there is\none reason there's one common factor\nthat I've seen time and time and time\nagain as to why everyone blames\nthemselves\nand it's actually like the most\ndevastating lesson I learned in\npsychiatry so and it comes down to\ntheory of mind so when you're a young\nchild and before you have conceptions of\nother people's theory like like other\npeople's existence so like like if I do\nsomething to you that lasts like let's\nsay I smack you across the face whose\nfault is that\nI assume you're an [ __ ] yes that is\nthe correct answer I was shaking my head\nfor a second because I think of all the\npeople that are gonna bend over\nbackwards and say that it's it's not my\nfault in that it's your fault you're\ngonna say that because that's what you\nsay about most things which would kind\nof prove my point and that gets to the\npunchline but anyway so it's my fault\nright if I punch you across the face\nit's my fault now if you do not have a\nconception that other human beings exist\nand you get hurt\nwhose fault is that\nmine absolutely because you're the only\nthing that exists right yeah if you're\nlike if you're sitting in a room by\nyourself and like no one is there and\nyou like feel pain like whose fault is\nthat\nthen yeah it's mine so this is what's so\ndevastating about abuse of very very\nyoung children so when children are\nsuper super young they don't have theory\nof mind and so when they get abused and\nthey get hurt they don't understand that\nlike it's an adult that's hurting them\nthey think it's their fault and they\ndevelop this sense that like when people\nhurt me it's my fault because that's\nwhat they were\nin the one thread that I hear from you\ntime and time and time again is first of\nall you get blamed for being who you are\npeople don't cut you slack you don't get\nto be yourself whether it's pushing you\nto do riddles or being judged for being\ndepressed and professional impacts I\ndon't even know we talked a little bit\nabout wayward and stuff like that you\nknow before you came on stream but like\nI can imagine that that you know your\nmom didn't treat you like a son like she\ntreated you like a problem like she\ndidn't let you be you and you know your\nwords not mine in terms of the three\ntherapists that helped you like how did\nthey help you they didn't help you\nthrough therapy they helped you through\ncaring because like you can have\nthousands of hours of therapy and if you\ndon't have like a clinical problem like\nif it's not like like no wonder nothing\nis working because it's not like and\nthis I shared with you before stream as\nwell like I I once had a very wise\npsychiatrist tell me and blew my mind\nbecause I've been testing this ever\nsince he told me this if you ever see a\npatient who has three diagnoses they're\nall wrong because that's just not I mean\nI don't know that that's absolutely true\nbut I think a lot of times people get\nlabeled with diagnoses and they get put\ninto treatment and like everyone is\nmissing the point because they're trying\nto treat like this thing over here but\nthat's not the problem so in your case I\nthink first of all somewhere along the\nway you and my hype I'm telling you like\nI mean I've I don't know if I've talked\nabout this before publicly but I talked\nabout this a fair amount it's just it\nwhen you have young children who were\nabused this is the this is the way they\nthink and trauma is the thing that\nmasquerades is every other like\npsychiatric diagnosis\nand what what I'm seeing in you is just\nlike that that you know somewhere along\nthe way I don't know why but it's like\nyour mom just didn't let you be you and\nshe she took the person that you were\nand she in her mind or in your own\ntaught you that that is wrong that like\nwhat you are is pathological and that\nyou're just like fundamentally like\nyou're busted in some way and I I think\nthat you have a lot of these feelings\nand I think some of the stuff that\nyou're doing I mean not say that this is\nyour fault but you know you talk about\nthese brief feelings of vindictiveness\nand anger and other people like and then\nyou say to yourself\nthose are unproductive so you dismiss\nthem but those are the feelings that you\nneed to feel to move out this because\nthose are the feelings that you actually\ndeserve to feel like that's you know the\nprocess of grieving like involves anger\nright like getting pissed at someone\nlike you don't actually forgive them\nbecause you you can't forgive anyone\nunless they hurt you but you don't think\nthat people hurt you you blame yourself\nso you're incapable of forgiving anyone\nelse like forgiveness requires someone\nhurt you and somewhere in there I don't\nknow if you know how to forgive yourself\nbut I think I think that's something you\nshould learn too and we can talk about\nmore and I mean just as this thread of\nlike not being allowed to be yourself\nright being bullied being given riddles\nbeing pathologized at a young age your\nmom trying to get rid of you and you're\napparently teenage years something like\nthat I mean I don't know if I fully\nunderstand that but you know and and\nthen there are people who actually like\ntreat you like what are the therapists\nthat have helped it's like the people\nwho have treated you like a person they\nlet you be like who you are and have\nintroduced you to a diagnosis have\nintroduced you to a behavior have\nintroduced you to a particular thing and\nthey've said like hey this is a full and\ncomplete person and it's not his fault\nand none of you all have the wherewithal\nall you guys are doing is you're blaming\nLS you're blaming LS you're blaming\nAlice and no one is bothering to ask a\nlie and then poor thing LS that's what\nwas modeled for you so that's what you\nlearned how to do blame yourself blame\nyourself blame yourself and there's a\npart of you that struggles\nintellectually you understand that there\nare reasons you are this way and so you\ncome up with these theories that I think\nare really good but that's all up here\nit's not in here\nthat's got to change\nyou\nyeah\n[Music]\nthat's questions\nI know that it has to change\nit's\nthe inability because it's aware of\nitself and I know it sounds really weird\nto talk about it like that but it is\ngood no it's my one of my therapists\nused to call it I remember I got memed\nabout this or not me and it got joked\nabout the the therapist called it\nsomething like a I don't remember the\nexact phrasing like a chronic chaos\nsyndrome or something the the need to\ncause chaos or chronic or problems in\norder to feel normal because it's all\nthat i-i've known and that it was very\npresent in my household and so I'm aware\nof that what you're saying is accurate\nI'm wearing that I'm aware that it's\nnecessary my brain the way that I think\nthe way that I construct things the way\nthat I compartmentalize things won't\nallow it to happen\nwhat I said to my my last two shrinks\nwas I told them both I've done this\nrodeo hundreds of hours I'm aware of\nthis but I think the only way that it's\ngonna happen is if somehow it happens\nthrough like trickery okay what I mean\nis that in excellent it's happening\nwithout my conscious awareness\nabsolutely because my conscious will\nfight you or not you but no whoever the\ndoctor or the clinician is right right\nso it there's two entities\nthere's the illness which we'll just\nrefer to as a monster right I don't want\nto use demon case anyone with religious\nbackgrounds think that's like really\n[ __ ] weird\nthe monster is aware of what's trying to\nhappen likes to live it likes to thrive\nyeah and so when it becomes aware that\nit's getting attacked or that there's a\nneed to remove it it will start doing\nthings to not allow that to happen\nwhether through thought processes\ncreating problems etc\nand obviously my conscious mind will\nresist and so I've theorized and what I\nsaid to the last two doctors the only\nway to break this is to bypass the\nconscious mind somehow with some\nepiphanies or something great I am\nI haven't [ __ ] found a way good so so\nyeah you know yeah so you remember\nearlier when I said I think you can get\nbetter I don't think so I thought I\nnever do I think so yeah I guess so\nI often times do what you're saying\nthat's that's a lot of how I work so I'm\nall about bypassing the conscious mind\nand that's why often times you want to\nsay things to me and that I just could\nyou know I just don't care right like\nyou'll be talking about like something\nthat seems like super important because\nit's all coming from up here and I could\ngive two shits about that that's not\nwhere the money is and I think if I'd\nlet you talk and I had asked you lots of\nquestions about your very rich history\nwe would be nowhere but I think we're\nsomewhere so all we got to do is bypass\nyour conscious mind that can be done do\nyou know how to meditate\nI've tried meditation in the past one of\nthe clinicians used to do meditation but\nthat gives me a ton of hope do you know\nwhy why because if you had said yes I\nknow how to meditate and I've meditated\nfor a long time and I've spent a lot of\ntime studying meditation and learning\nhow to meditate then I would be Sol\nbecause the basic thing that I think is\ngonna help you is gonna be meditation\nbut if you don't know how to do it and\nyou've only dabbled in you haven't\nreally done it then there's a good\nchance there's still hope for you the\nother thing that I think we need to\nteach you how to do is feel your\nemotions so depression is anger turned\nagainst the self this is what one of the\npsychoanalyst it's believed that\nessentially like what we call depression\nis just anger that's directed inwardly\nas opposed to outwardly and I think that\nmakes sense for you so I think you just\nhave a lot of anger your problem is not\nI mean so once again oversimplifying etc\nso I'm glad you're actually seeing real\nyou know treat treaters and stuff\nbecause\nthey're gonna know better than I do\nbecause they've spent the time to learn\nall about you whereas I have not at the\nsame time I think it starts by letting\nyourself feel anger right it starts by\nyou saying and this is a hard thing to\nsay that this happened to me and it\nreally shouldn't have in it's shitty and\nthere's no explaining it and it sucks\nand I did not deserve it but it happened\nanyway because your mind is so good at\ncreating meaning and so good at creating\nlogic and so good at creating\nexplanations that just random acts of\nviolence and awfulness just have no\nplace in your head which is really what\nyou should acknowledge is that sometimes\njust bad [ __ ] happens and you don't\ndeserve it but your inability to like\nexperience that means that you've got\nthis weird like you're like a septic\ntank that's just full and like never\ndrains because like bad [ __ ] happens to\nyou and happens to you and happens to\nyou and no one and you just blame\nyourself and so like no like the blame\njust sits within you you're like just\njust a cesspool of you know stuff and so\nI think it's actually oddly enough I\nmean the first thing that I try to do is\nfeel anger just start there and just\nfeel it and learn how to meditate and\nthen we can talk further but I mean I\nthink I think there's hope for you\nbecause I think if you're generally\nspeaking I tend to be hopeful when I\nunderstand people because I think if I\nunderstand them that means that there's\nsome sort of like logic or rhythm to it\nand there's like a system and if you\nunderstand the system then you can\nimprove the system now I'm not saying\nit's easy I'm not saying it's gonna\nhappen anytime soon but at the end of\nthe day LSU just have some I mean I\nthink some really like low-hanging fruit\nin terms of the way that you look at\nyourself the lack of things that you do\nyour tendency to over intellectualize\nand like push away your feelings because\nthey don't matter to you I think it's\nalso very hopeful to me because you\nunderstand this so like I don't know if\nyou remembered let me just see\ncan I hold on is it okay if I show\npeople the last few DMS starting\nstarting starting like this can I share\nthat with people yeah sure so like this\nis what we're talking about chat so\nthese last DMS that I sent you because\nI'm glad you recognized it as an is its\nown thing yeah so like it's its own\nvoice I've referred to it as another me\nyes oh good I know it sounds really\nweird to say it's no but the easiest\nanalogy is to compare it to like a\nreligious possession right it's an at\nits another entity it's another person\nthat is aware of itself and that will\nstop it no means to defend itself yes\nand this comes back as my original\nquestion which is do you want to let go\nof fear no the answer is no no right so\nthis thing that I call the badness like\nthere's a thing inside you that we\nabsolutely have to bypass because this\nthing is a protective mechanism it's a\nsurvival mechanism and it's not going to\nabandon you because it's afraid that if\nit abandons you then you've got nothing\nit's fear it's blame it's agency its\npower because if everything is your\nfault then you have a road forward so\nit's subtle and it's it's dangerous and\nthis is the really important thing to\nunderstand about it it's not bad or evil\nit's something that you needed for a\nlong time to keep you alive in this\nsituation and now it's time to move past\nwhich is not destroy it which is not\nmake it go away which is actually to\nlike help it calm down because it's\ntrying to protect you so the way it's\nkind of like getting a guard dog that's\nlike super agitated like how do you get\nit to calm down you got to get it to\ncalm down yeah and it's gonna be with\nyou for the rest of your life but it\ndoesn't have to control you thoughts\nquestions yeah well I mean I I agree\nwith everything you're saying I just\ndon't know how I have never yeah I've\nnever I've never found it in fact one of\nthe really sad things a few shrinks past\nmy case along sure which is that that\nthat's some of the work that that's one\nof the worst feelings yeah but that's I\nmean that's something you must be very\ncoastal with because people um\npassing it made me it eventually made me\nget to a point where I just thought it\nalmost made me feel special in a weird\nway like my case was so [ __ ] up\nbecause I didn't have violent tendencies\ndidn't have drug abuse\nI was always straightedge I've never\neven dabbled and stuff etc I was just\nthis depressed anxious kid and for some\nreason shrinks and therapists were\ngiving up and so it made me think there\nwas just no end game because we always\ntried to hit it with so many different\nthings\nCBT different medication different\nstyles different approaches and nothing\never worked so it always just comes full\ncircle to doesn't matter how I'm feeling\nI'm gonna get up every day because I\nmust yeah because you know so that's\nthat's the thing right so like that's\nwhat we need to change is that like it\ndoes matter what you're feeling that's\nwhat's got to change because like right\nnow you have all of this just emotion\npent up within you and it has nowhere to\ngo\nso it starts to cannibalize like that's\nwhat the psychoanalysts I think I mean\nI'm not an expert in this mean by like\ndepression is anger turned against the\nself and you're not willing to give your\nanger to others so it's just got like in\nyou know it's like it just doesn't\ndisappear like that's not how emotions\nwork and so there may be a lot of stuff\naround gaming and things in terms of\nlike coping mechanisms and things like\nthat um but yeah I mean I'm hopeful for\nyou in the sense that or let me put it\nthis way I'm not willing to give up hope\non you yet because I think that you have\na very good understanding of what is\ngoing on inside you I think it's good\nthat you understand that this thing has\na vested interest in staying alive and\nstaying strong and that you do have to\nbypass it completely agree you're not\nthere are there ways to do that I mean\nliterally meditation is the process of\nshutting off your mind and you if you\nshut off your mind this thing will turn\noff too so anyway I think there are a\nlot of things that we're gonna I'm gonna\ntalk about a little bit later in terms\nof Karma which is like how to find\npurpose and meaning in life cuz I think\nyou've got a lot of other stuff too like\nsort of the the what would you call like\nthe reaching the plateau and it feeling\nempty summit syndrome yes the actual\nterm for it yeah we're gonna actually\ntalk about I mean that that's so so I\nprepared something like a lecture which\nI think is the first step to solving\nthat problem there are other things that\nthat you know I'm hopeful for you I mean\nI I've worked with some people who\nreally are treatment refractory and\nsometimes I'm not able to help them but\nI've also had a fair number of people\nwhose other psychiatrists turn away and\nand like have seen person after person\nafter person after person and end up\ntrying some of these things and then\nthey get better\nand so I'm foolishly optimistic no okay\nwhat are you feeling\nso bite my initial thought right is what\ntype of people were the ones that you\ncouldn't help now it's my initial\nthought\nand then what kind of demographic would\nthat be and based on the language that\nyou've used with me in the short time\nthat we've interacted with each other\nthings that you've talked about and the\nquestions what type of personality would\nnot be receptive to such stuff and then\nI try to match it to mine and I look for\nthe mirrors and the Cascades and try to\nthink what that could mean for yesterday\nand puzzle yeah so you know what we're\ngonna do okay well not answer your\nquestion okay\nnice right so what where is that\nquestion operating no I'm just I'm\nrelaying it to you that that's my\ninitial thought X that's all so now I'm\ngonna ask you where is that question\noperating what part of you does it\noperate them\nit's kind of a weird question um the be\nhope part yes so even simply it operates\nwithin your MO so basically right but\nthe light and will refer to it as the\nlight in the darkness\nright so the light wants to ask\nsomething and the darkness drives it out\nnot only that but sometimes the light\ngets answers in the darkness co-op's the\nanswers and reinforces its beliefs about\nyou correct yes yes that's why I'm not\ngonna answer I'm not gonna play that\n[ __ ] game because no matter what I\nsay right right the darkness is gonna\nwin you're right if I play the game the\ndarkness is gonna win because it it\ntakes all of the beautiful questions\nthat the light asks and then warps them\nand turns it into this weird zombie\nsalami\nright so right now I feel like that's\nlike it's like it's it's it's a one\nbattle right but then it's perceiving\nthe it it's a war right yeah so I know\nthat's really [ __ ] up today or maybe\nit maybe it's just not to say that I\nknow I'm okay\njust you could think whatever like\nyou're conceptualizing abstracting\nunderstanding understanding and we're\njust not gonna indulge and it looks like\nokay I should say something because\nwe've had a couple people Sears up his\ngifted us like a thousand subs so thank\nyou sir so what I can't actually count\nhow many there are\nbut I probably should have I don't know\npeople have been sometimes people are\nlike gifting and donating a lot and then\njust get lost in here yeah so people\nthank you all for the subs I I mean I\ndon't know there's just too many on the\nscreen so maybe it's less people are\nsaying it's 40 or to 50 40 I don't know\nI can't count I'm a psychiatrist because\nI can't do math if I could do math I\nwould have been engineer mathematician\neconomist finance okay last questions LS\nfor you huh any questions you have no no\nyeah okay let me see there are a couple\nof questions\nokay so here's a question question anger\nturned against yourself any backstory or\na book whatever to indulge into it\nbecause it seems crucial I don't know\nwhat that means but anger turned against\nyourself yes so I mean I don't know how\nelse to explain it but I don't know if\nyou guys are getting this but ls has a\nreally pathologic absence of anger\nright unless like you should be angry at\nall comics well this is interesting\nI never felt anger until this year I\nwhat I mean by anger is I never fell\nurges to lash out or anything okay but\nI've had instances of it this year but\nit was I attributed it to certain\ntriggers which I've identified and then\nmanaged okay so it yeah everyone is\ntalking about you playing league and how\nthat's clearly BS so let me just okay so\nwhat they're referring to there's a rate\nthere's rage compilation clips and\nbasically what's happening is when you\nstream for ten twelve hours a day\nand you have people tell you things that\naren't true or ask you things repeatedly\nover and over there's breaking points\nwhen you have so much other noise going\non and so I lash out because it feels\nlike any answers I give or say is\nirrelevant anyway and I already don't\nwant to be doing what I'm doing but I'm\ndoing it out of fear and they can't see\nit as such and so I lash out that I\ncan't actually convey to them what is\ntruly happening and so I don't I\nwouldn't call that anger in the way that\nsomeone else would call it anger I don't\nknow what you just said but once again\nthat's a very beautiful intellectual you\nknow like analytical I mean I don't know\nI thought I thought that much is clear\nto my mind you don't blame them I'm not\ntrying to I'm not trying to like say\nthat what you're saying I'm not trying\nto dismiss what you're saying I really\ndo think I'm not being sarcastic I think\nit's like very well thought out and very\nwell analyzed I'm just saying that like\nthat's not that's not what's gonna get\nyou better I also think that like rage\nrage in gaming is it so it's it's whole\nseparate thing right like that's yeah\nit's just manifests itself through\ngaming you start getting angry not at\nthe game it's you're thinking about what\nsomeone else is doing to you you start\ntaking it personal or you start thinking\ntheir life problems and struggles that\nyou're being made aware of duty\nthings that are happening like maybe you\ncommitted 20 20 minutes or 30 minutes to\na game the game didn't go your way\nbecause the game didn't go your way you\nonly had one hour free time that day you\nthink about all the time that was wasted\nyou really got to learn how to just shut\nthat off man I can't it's always going I\nknow times the that's why I'm saying you\ngot to learn how to shut it off just\nJesus okay I'm gonna give you another\nquestion we're gonna ask him other\nquestion okay no the only time it shuts\noff is when I'm eating if that's\ninteresting for you okay so I actually\nget very mad talk to me when I'm eating\nit's peaceful okay so you're analyzing\nagain I'm always analyzing yes I know so\njust just stop first I'm trying to catch\non okay yes I wanted twitch chat' saying\neat more feelings okay how do you know\nwhen you should cut ties in a toxic\nrelationship or invest in trying to make\nit better okay so that's kind of an\ninteresting question any thoughts about\nthat\ntell us how how to I'm sorry how do you\nknow when to invest and cut ties in a\ntoxic relationship or invest in making\nit better when both or what I guess when\none party is heading in another\ndirection than the other would be a\npretty good indicator of when ties need\nto be cut because normally relationships\nare founded upon mutual interests or\nmutual direction right I think that's\nactually how humans can originally\nbecome attracted right is when they\nrealize that there's some sort of\ndirection that they can go with one\nanother sometimes there's really [ __ ]\nup versions where people look for broken\npeople because they realized the\ndirection they want to go in is by\ndragging someone and that's obviously a\ndark path but toxic if there's ever a\nseparation of paths in either one party\nI would imagine that would be best to\ncut ties okay yeah I mean I think that\nmakes sense I think the challenge is\nthat a lot of people have trouble seeing\nthat and they have trouble seeing that\nyou guys let people aren't on the same\npage so my answer to that question would\nbe a little bit different so I think\nwhen it comes to a relationship this is\nI guess we're\nto the talk that we're gonna have which\na lot of these questions do so that\ntells me it's a good talk so you should\ndo your daughter mine the relationship\nand you shouldn't do more than what\nyou're autonomous so I think the what I\nmean by that is your Dharma means your\nduty or responsibility so you should do\nwhat your part of the relationship is\nand you should not do more so for\nexample I think a lot of when you talk\nabout invest in making it better a lot\nof people invest in relationships trying\nto fix them but you can't fix a\nrelationship it takes two people to fix\na relationship so how do you it's and\nit's not about cutting ties or investing\nit's about doing what you should do\ndoing your daughter more to the\nrelationship and then not doing any more\nso another brilliant psychiatrist once\ntold me something that I think is just\namazing the doctor who goes at the extra\nmile for the patient goes a mile too far\nokay and so I think you should do what\nyou're supposed to do in a relationship\nand then like that's it don't do more\nbecause you can't do the other person's\nportion right like you can take 50% of\nthe relationship on your shoulders but\nif you cross over into 51% or 60% or 70%\nyou can't take that away from them it's\njust not going to work it's not gonna be\na healthy relationship which doesn't\nmean that all relationships are like\n5050 like sometimes you know doing your\npart of the relationship is temporarily\nor even sustainably doing more than then\nthey are so it's not about 50/50 it's\nlike what's your tournament so you know\nI I don't mean to say I think you should\nbe your part and sometimes your part is\n50/50 if you've got like a younger\nbrother who's like disabled or\nhandicapped like your Dharma in that\nrelationship is gonna be greater than\nhis in terms of like bringing the\ngroceries in from the car so it's to do\nyour entire mind to do no more so I\nthink you should invest what you're\nsupposed to and then don't I and if they\ndon't reciprocate or they don't do what\nthey're supposed to do then then that\nrelationship is over not even then like\ncut ties implies that you never\nengage in that relationship again but I\nthink that that too so you may have like\nlet's say your your LS is estranged with\nhis mom so I think his Dharma is to do\nyou know it depends on the specifics of\nthe situation but generally speaking to\ntry to be a good son and if at some\npoint you know I I'm not saying that you\nI'm not placing a judgment on you but in\nmy mind I think that if at some point\nshe comes around and and starts to\nbehave like normally and recognizes that\nthings have changed and she's really\ntrying to turn over a new leaf I think\nyeah it is a dharma of a psychotic yeah\nto like meeting the right way yeah yeah\nbut but that LS can't can't go 90\npercent of the way like that's just not\ngonna be healthy it's not gonna work so\nthat's that's okay so has anything with\nyour parents relationship affected you\nin any way that would contribute to the\nway your mental state works\nnot be intruding or anything but\nwondering if it could be a route to such\na problem which it may not but in the\nodd case if it is please please try to\nreflect on this so do you think anything\nwith your parents relationship affected\nyou in any way that would contribute to\nyour the way your mental state works\neverything yeah right my hand literally\neverything hearing hearing my own name\nis really weird like even right now\nright we keep using LS hearing Nick is\nor well hearing Nicholas is really weird\nbecause that that's only what my mother\nwould call me sometimes but usually I\nonly heard Nick from like my uncle's my\ncousins etc right and so if I didn't see\nthem that often where obviously there's\nother ways to refer to someone in person\nwhich is just to address them in a\ngeneric sense like hey or just starts\ntalking in the direction and whatnot but\nhearing derogatory words used to refer\nto me it was very common growing up so\nyou know hearing bastard or\nson-of-a-bitch\nor [ __ ] you know anything uh different\ndifferent people like not all like yet\npeople that were yeah yeah family\nmembers that I had eight people growing\nup my Gretel my grandparents my uncle's\nmy sister\nand aunts on yeah I don't know my stance\non yeah\nso and then my mother ended up getting\nher own house when I think I turned 12\nshe ended up getting her own house but I\ndidn't move in with her until after my\ngrandfather passed okay and then I lived\nwith my father and stepmother briefly\nand then I went back to living with my\nfather and stepmother and then I ended\nup living with my stepmother because my\nstepmother and my father got a divorce\nand my stepmother kept me unbeknownst to\nmy mother but refused to let my father\ntake me\nhmm my stepmoms one of the closest\npeople in my life\nstill it's basically her and my\ngrandmother now yeah it sounds like\nshe's more like a real mom yeah I would\nI would call her mom I don't but I mean\nI I could for all intents and purposes I\nhave known her since I was two or\nsomething\nyeah so another question for you so for\nLS does he realize that he has viewers\nthat care about him and respect him does\nthat affect him I've thought about this\na lot I get really mad when people\ncredit me with things that I don't\nactually deserve or that I didn't do I\nget really mad in general with false\ncredit or I get really angry when people\ndon't properly evaluate people in this\nindustry or just in general so sometimes\nwhen I talk to people that are like fans\nof me or acquaintances or something if\nthey falsely attributed me with me with\nstuff due to like nepotism or something\nelse I actually get pretty angry not\nangry in the way that we're talking\nabout anger I just get very very\nfrustrated and I want them to do better\nor I want them to not credit me falsely\nhurt or something like that and return\nin regards to like people that care\nthat's\nit's a really weird thing to say because\npeople always say that they they care\nbut only\nif it benefits them in some way is how I\nperceive that\nbecause people always say they care no\nthey don't they care when it benefits\nthem in some way because altruism truism\nam I saying this right [ __ ] genuine\ncare or one-sided I've never seen\ninstances of it there's always something\nthat is benefiting it sometimes maybe\nsomeone will drop groceries you'll go\nover a girl or a little smile is falling\napart\nyeah it's clipping out the hole up all\nthe way freaking it\nOh hold on let me reconnect okay but we\ndon't need\nso I think what we managed to do is when\nwe asked LS how do you feel about your\nviewers caring about you we managed to\nactually answer the previous question\nwhich is where the was the way that you\nraised by your parents does that affect\nyour mental state and here we see the\nanswer right this is the answer we're\nseeing it so now you guys see\nHey can you hear me yep as your dream\nlive again okay yep my stream has been\nlive so the the grocery thing is\ninteresting\nso I there's there's there's two points\nof it one is observed by public and one\nis not observed so Wendy I'm confused so\nokay so if if someone is carrying\ngroceries and they drop their groceries\nand someone goes over and if someone\ngoes over and picks up the groceries and\ngives it to the how to keep the person\nsays thank you and smiles and there's\npeople that can perceive that as they\ncare for the other person but what they\ncare about in my eyes or most likely is\nseeing the smile in the thank you so\nthat they can feel self gratitude or\nsomething else it's not a hundred\npercent nice or a hundred percent caring\nthere is something in it for them\nand then the non observed one is the one\nthat I have to think more about when\nthere's no one else around to see the\ngroceries\nwhat are they really doing that for but\nthen maybe it's because of a memory of\nanother relative or something else and\nthey imagine that that person would like\nif someone did it for them and so\nthey're doing it to live vicariously\nthrough a memory or something I don't\n[ __ ] know anyways um I don't even\nthink most of the people living in my\nhouse actually care about me\nwhich is fine I think that they're aware\nof Who I am in this industry and what it\nmeans to potentially be around me and\nthat's fine I care about like setting\nthem up and making sure that they have\nstuff that I didn't have in my early\nyears in Korea and as it's it's a really\nweird feeling what do you get out of\nthat\nuh well I the the loneliness thing sort\nof covered right I've thought about that\nangle that we talked about earlier\nthere's people around I obviously get\nthe yeah I do still feel lonely but\nthere's a difference between feeling\nlonely and having my own thoughts echo\noff itself versus there's other people\naround it's something weird I don't know\nmaybe it has to do with something with\nyeah I don't think you understand what\ncaring looks like I made okay to be\nblunt\nit sucks yeah I mean I think people\ngenuinely care about you and I don't\nthink you know getting back to your\nwonderful question which is why are you\nthis way and I think it's because you\ndidn't have a whole lot of people\nExpress caring about you and goes back\nto all the stuff about you know not\nbeing able to be the person that you are\nnot being accepted for who you are being\nshaped in one way being blamed at one\nway there we go again there it is\nfairness\nso notice yeah notice it notice of\ncourse I can notice it okay so so close\nyour eyes close your eyes okay close\nyour eyes\nokay sure okay now nope keep it closed\nokay close close your eyes okay okay\nnotice that thing within you that wants\nto speak right what does it feel like I\nfeel like context I feel like every\npiece of a puzzle matters and that it\ncan't truly be understood without every\npiece okay so so and is it important to\nunderstand a puzzle\nI feel like we're making we're trying to\nsolve the wheel of fortune puzzle\nwithout just having every letter when Z\nyou knock with more lines what do you\nfeel I feel like I want you to know\nevery letter what does that feel like\nin your body it feels like a it feels\nlike an absence of a hundred percent\nokay what does that feel like good now\nwe're getting somewhere\nyeah it just doesn't feel complete it's\nempty yes\nninety-nine percent is the same thing as\nzero beautiful what does that feel like\ndescribe the physical sensations yes\ngood frustration yeah frustration with\nwho uh everything now you're just people\nhuh frustrated with you yeah yeah myself\nfrustrated with me no not well yeah kind\nof\nthere we go good job good job\nyeah but everything yeah good yeah\nwhat's your mind doing right now\ncompartmentalizing the conversation okay\nright but for a moment it wasn't now\nyou're back we so we took that thing\nwhether we call the badness or the demon\nor whatever and we knocked it off base\nfor a few seconds few seconds yeah yeah\nand now it's back it righted itself\nright it's an operating it yeah and the\ngoal is to keep trying to get small\nvictories there it is there it is you\nsee it it's back good so open your eyes\nyeah good you've taken your first step\nforward how does that feel I've done\nthis a few times good its yeah it's okay\nin the moments\nit feels relieving and then it sucks\nright back in yes and okay let's\nunderstand this okay cuz we should okay\nwe got to stop this interview soon but\nlet's understand this because I can't\nlet these go\nokay yeah why do you get sucked back in\nyou feel relief right and you felt\nrelief because you were anger at who who\nwho were you angry at um I think that\nyou're respecting me to say me here\nyou're expecting me to say me but now\nI'm starting to think about childhood\npeople right now [ __ ] no you're you're\nangry at me right like you were like why\ndoesn't this [ __ ] guy let me talk I\njust want to talk like no no I just\nactually started giving angry childhood\npeople\noh okay weird all right so baby this is\ngonna be way easier than I thought I\nthought that we would have this time\nwhere like me you get angry at me and\nthat would be displaced anger and it\nwould take you a while to be angry at\npeople in my childhood I played out all\nthe lines and I have Rove or I I arrived\nat the end of the lines it must original\nit must deduce down to that's not what\nI'm talking about I'm not talking about\nthe end of the line so we're gonna have\nto do this again so we're gonna train\nyour mind to meditate and notice what is\nin the moment because I do I would be\nvery surprised if you were actually\nangry at people in your childhood my\nsense not genuinely I actually I'm\nthinking about three in particular I\nknow that sounds weird but are you\nnormally angry with people in your\nchildhood or is this new for you\nno this is this is this is kind of new\nI'm thinking about it a lot right now\nokay so then you keep going so I'm gonna\njust leave you where you are and you\njust sort that out I'm actually gonna\nsay normally rationalize it no yes you\njust okay so let's go back to why do you\nstop feeling relief do you understand\nthis\nother thoughts start making more noise\nand then exactly so your mind\nreactivates and you start deducing again\nand when you are deducing you don't feel\ngood because your deductions are full of\nlike cognitive biases so the machine\nstarts that's why it's temporary because\nyou can't restrain the machine the\nmachine of the mind is just going going\ngoing and it's deducing deducing\ndeducing understanding understanding\nunderstanding which is brilliant\nbrilliant brilliant and also away from\nyour feelings away from your feelings\naway from your feelings yeah so we just\nthe less your machine is active the more\nyou can restrain yourself and the more\nyou can just be in the moment the more\nyou will start to feel better and like\nunderstand things like people in your\nchildhood deserve hatred like that's\nwhat you need right is to like if\nsomeone did something shitty to you\ninstead of blaming yourself blame them\nand it sounds like you just took a step\nforward so yippee thanks good okay I\ngotta take a break for a little bit okay\nand then I'm gonna talk about in karma\nyou're welcome to tune in I think if you\nwant to reflect on this because it's\nlike you know sweet sweet high-grade\nopium for a heroin addict for your mind\n- like reflect on something new then by\nall means do so but notice like you\nnotice how you feel now and notice how\nyou're gonna feel at the end of that\nreflection I don't know exactly what to\npredict there but good job today and\nthen after you finish cuz I don't want\nyou to I don't want to pull away I\nalready pulled your mind away from\nthings already so at the end and like\nmaybe 45 minutes or so I'm gonna teach\nmeditation if it's not if it's not super\nlate for you you can watch it later but\nI think you should learn how to meditate\nbecause I think it's gonna help you'll\nlove it okay Ellis you will love it once\nyou get good at it because it's gonna\nhelp you understand things outside of\nintellectualization which is amazing I\nthink you're gonna learn huh okay so\nclosing thoughts\num I I had too many thoughts there we go\nclose I'm not beautiful so Ellis that's\ngreat so you see what you did\nyou saw instead of just launching into\nthe autopilot of your mind you're like\noh like there goes my mind again you\njust gained like a little bit like you\ngot one out you just mind like a mineral\nlike you can't do anything with a\nmineral it's not even 8 minerals it's\njust a mineral you mind a mineral and if\nyou keep on mining those minerals\neventually you will be able to build you\nplay Zerg my plate Terran Terran yeah of\ncourse you'll get you'll get her but\nthat's good that's good you're learning\nfast you're learning faster okay so um\nokay good so good yeah that's great you\nsee you noticed like the Machine of your\nmind is going going going going going\nthat's good okay so I'm gonna take a\nbreak for like two or five minutes\nbecause I'm gonna drink something in pee\nand then we're gonna go back I'm gonna\ndo a quick lecture on the harm oh we'll\ndo more questions and we'll do\nmeditation okay am i same here for this\nor I'm gonna hang up with you but you're\nwelcome to watch the stream yeah what's\nthe stream okay I haven't promised\npeople that I would like talk about a\nconcept from start to finish okay all\nright thanks a lot man\nstrong work really amazing good job\ntonight\nThanks bye okay so we're gonna okay\nwe're gonna we're gonna help him like\ndespite his best efforts to resist [ __ ]\nthat we're gonna we're gonna help him\neven if he doesn't want it"
