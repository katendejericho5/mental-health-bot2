    "transcript": "so I was envisioning that I was gonna be\nlike super like clear-headed and stuff\nwhen I explained this next part so I'll\nask y'all's forgiveness in terms of if\nit's not clearer seems a little bit\ndiscombobulated so sorry about that so\nhopefully this will make sense to people\nif it doesn't I'll do the Dharma talk\nagain and like be in a better frame of\nmind because I sort of sketch out rough\nnotes but I don't have like a prepared\nthing that I read so it involves a lot\nof ad-lib kind of stuff the second thing\nis that twitch chat is actually like\nreally good at this now so I've been\nwatching and I'm amazed by how well you\nguys understand the things that I think\nin my head and so like what I want y'all\nto do so first of all you know when you\nrun across a cognitive bias and you see\nit in someone it's like so easy to see\nright and that's because I mean I've\nnoticed that some of you guys like\nsometimes I'll ask people questions into\na chat about like you know what they\nthink is going on and predominantly like\npeople are correct in terms of\nrecognizing ego recognizing stuff like\nrecognizing like cognitive biases and so\nyou guys are actually really good at\nthis so that is awesome\nand y'all should continue to pay\nattention and ultimately apply the stuff\nto yourself so try to like see the\nthings that you see in LS and like look\nfor it in your own life so not\nnecessarily his specifics but I'll give\nyou guys a couple of examples so one is\nlike we talked about fear and in his\ncase you know we think that living a\nlife based on fear is a bad thing but in\nhis case we can see how it's adaptive in\nan important survival mechanism and so\nthere going to be some things that you\ndo that are going to be like bad for you\nbut that you learn how to do because\nthat was the only way you could deal\nwith it at a particular time so what is\nthe behavior or the thought process that\nyou have about yourself that used to\nwork and is now not or\nso well there are other things that we\ncould you know think about in terms of\nlike what are the emotions that you feel\nlike whenever you have an impulse to do\nsomething here's another like general\ngood one when you have an impulse to do\nsomething or especially an impulse to\nlike say something and you restrain that\nimpulse what do you feel because that's\ngonna tell you like a lot about your\nnatural inclination inclinations and\nwhat you're drawn towards and you can\ngrow a lot by restraining your natural\nimpulse like it was torturous like he\ncouldn't even close his eyes like it's\nso hard for him to restrain that like\nwhatever that the strength of his mind\nis and it's amazing that he was able to\ndo it because it's like so hard to close\nyour eyes like you'd think that that\nwould be easy but he's able to do it and\nthat's where the progress is so find the\ninclination within yourself and then see\nwhat happens when you restrain it or you\ndon't restrain it and like you can learn\na lot about yourself that way okay okay\nso let's do time' okay so this actually\nrelates to some of the stuff that ls\nsaid about what was it a plateau\nsyndrome I keep on forgetting what he\ncalled it pretty cool but summit\nsyndrome there we go so and the reason\nit relates to this is because you were\ntalking about something that we're\ntalking about feeling empty in spite of\naccomplishment so Dharma is like a great\nway to do to no longer feel empty in\nlife there are a couple of other\nquestions like that people have asked\nabout you know depression and stuff like\nthat so I think Dharma is important so\nlet me just start from the top\nso Parma is the Sanskrit word for duty\nor responsibility and sort of in in in\nthe East it's not so much about right or\nwrong in terms of like an absolute\nmorality the idea is that you should do\nHonma or you know a sin quote-unquote is\nto like not do your Dharma but what does\nthat mean like what does it mean to do\nyour autonomous so the first thing that\nI want to point out is that a lot of\npeople want to make changes in their\nlife and it's difficult to make changes\nand there are all kinds of reasons that\npeople come up with they like they start\nreally intellectualizing and coming up\nwith like oh I'm lazy or the super\ncomplicated thing happened and that\nprevents me from progressing or like\nthis happened and that's why this didn't\nhappen or I blame myself or I blame\nother people your mind comes up with all\nkinds of reasons why progress growth are\nmoving forward is hard and the first\nthing to understand is that people\nconceive of progress growth and moving\nforward as good things so in our mind we\nall want progress growth or\naccomplishment right like we think about\nmoving forward and putting together our\nlives and we think about that as a\npositive thing and I know it sounds kind\nof bizarre because clearly it's a\npositive thing like don't we all want to\nprogress and grow but what I want you\nguys to understand is that actually\nmoving forward or growing doesn't feel\nlike a good thing so like in your brain\nand your experience of progress and\ngrowth is actually like bad difficult or\npainful it doesn't feel good like\ngrowing and progressing in life is like\nhard and crappy and usually like\nuncomfortable or shitty in some way so\njust think about you know if you're\nunemployed and you want a career that's\nnot gonna be fun like you want a career\nand like if you have a career is like\nyou know like let's say you are at\ndeveloper or something and at some point\nyou're making like you know hundreds of\nthousands of dollars like that's cool\nlike that's progress or growth and so we\nkind of associate that with positive\nfeelings but the first thing that you\nguys have to understand is that like the\nprocess of growing is gonna be\nfundamentally difficult or painful if\nit's not I mean doesn't always have to\nbe it can be wonderful in a lot of ways\ntoo\nbut in your mind you associate most\npeople associate progress or growth with\ngood things but in reality it is a\ndifficult thing to do\nso the way to think about this speaking\nof kind of summit syndrome is we think\nabout summiting the mountain\nand that summiting is like a good thing\nbut climbing the mountain is effort in\npain with minimal reward so summiting is\nwhere you get your award but your\nprocess is difficult and painful and so\nmost of the time if we think about what\nthe mind is actually doing there if you\nfocus on progress or NGO growth you're\nnot thinking about the process you're\nthinking about the end your focus is on\nthe reward not the climbing and so your\nexpectation of growth or progress\nbecomes associated with positivity\nprimarily because we think of rewards as\ngood and then your experience is\nactually very different from your\nexpectations so I think about how\nawesome it is to reach the top\nthen like if I start to climb and I'm\nthinking about the awesomeness at the\ntop like it's gonna be different from\nsort of what I'm envisioning so a lot of\ntimes what happens when when especially\ngamers try to move forward in life is it\nturns out to be not nearly as sexy as\nthey imagined and then they this leads\nto a loss of will to move forward\nbecause you're shooting for something\ngood you're hoping for independence\nyou're hoping for you know to put\ntogether your life and you're hoping for\neverything to be like fixed but the\nactual experience looks nothing like\nthat and you don't even know if this\nexperience is gonna lead you to the end\nresult like if you see the top of the\nmountain I say there's a thousand stairs\nthat you can climb and you'll get to the\ntop of the mountain if you can see point\na and you can see point Z I mean you go\nfrom point A to point Z you can\nsometimes tolerate the discomfort of\nclimbing for the purpose of reaching the\ntop but when it comes to a satisfying\ncareer and if you're unemployed you have\nno idea whether working at the call\ncentre is actually gonna lead you to the\ngoal that you want so you this leads to\na loss of will to move forward because\nall you see is the suffering and you're\nnot even sure if that that is ever gonna\nread lead to progress and so if you're\nchoosing to put your life together for\nlike good reasons but experience bad\nthings then you're gonna stop putting\nyour life together\nbecause it's not what you are looking\nfor does that make sense\nyou guys following me\nokay good because I wasn't sure if that\nmade any sense when I sat down and wrote\nit down okay so the goal is to be able\nto choose to discover a way where you\ncan choose the pain and the suffering\nand you can accept it for what it is\nwithout another reason that you can just\nlike step in front of and embrace the\ncrappiness of life because this is\nimportant to understand what holds you\nback in life is because life is crappy\nand you don't want to play that game you\nwant to play the game that's fun you\ndon't want to play it pay the game\nthat's crappy that's just how we operate\nit's how all human beings often operate\nso what that means is that if you have a\nnebulous goal and you have a short term\nthat sucks you're just not going to do\nit so if there's a way that you can\nchoose the crappy road that you can face\nit embrace it and move through it to not\nexpect a positive thing but to actually\nembrace the negativity of life then\nyou're you're in complete control of\nyour life because then the crappiness\ndoesn't have to hold you back and you\ndon't need a guarantee of a particular\nfuture to keep you moving forward like\nthis is a terrible way to live life if\nyou're living life based on guarantees\nin the future which is what a lot of\npeople do then they're willing to\nwithstand punishment today or they just\navoid punishment entirely then you're\nonly gonna live a life of like gaming\nlike that's what happens right you just\nbecause you don't want to work at a call\ncenter you don't want to like bag\ngroceries you don't want to do you don't\nwant to make a resume because that's\nboring and it you don't even know if\nit's gonna accomplish anything and\ngamers would rather sways their time on\nnothing then waste their time on\nsomething that may not work which is\nanother like really bizarre cognitive\nbias but just think about that for a\nsecond you would rather not do a resume\nat all rather than like spend time on a\nresume if it may not get you the job\nthat you want\nbut like that's really bizarre it's like\nbizarre thinking but that's how it works\nso that's fine\nso let's accept it let's first\nunderstand what we are and accept where\nwe are and don't blame ourselves for\nbeing this way and let's see if there's\nsome way that we can move forward\nbecause there is okay so I got you guys\nI got you okay so this is what\nautonomous\nDharma is the ability to choose tolerate\nand even welcome both the good and the\nbad Dharma is the way the thing that\nallows us to face adversity to accept\nadversity to choose adversity so here's\nthe traditional example that I use about\nDharma so let's say someone points a gun\nat me so the gun means all kinds of\nthings right so like memes and and you\nknow terrible jokes about school\nshootings and stuff aside like the gun\nis like just let's just in this isolated\nworld the gun just means pain suffering\ndeath right this is like a bad thing\nlike being like someone pointing a gun\nat you is a bad thing I have no doubt\nthat if someone actually did this I\nwould be devastated and frightened and\nall that kind of good stuff\nso our instinctive reaction is to turn\naway from the gun or retreat from the\ngun or whatever if you want to be a hero\nand you're Superman or whatever you can\nfight against the gun but generally\nspeaking like my point is that when\nsomeone\nengages you with like a bad situation\nyour tendency is to retreat from it and\nit's completely reasonable so then let's\nuse an alternate example let's say\nsomeone points a gun at my kid then what\ndo I do\nright so the gun doesn't mean anything\nless the situation hasn't changed I mean\nthe situation has changed drastically\nbut like the meaning of gun is if\nanything more severe than it was before\nit still means pain it still means death\nit even means death or danger to\nsomething that I care about more than\nmyself so how do I respond to the gun\nsuddenly instead of stepping away from\nit I'm moving into its path between me\nand my kid so let's just think about\nthat for a second okay so what this\nmeans is that like this thing which is\nnegative and painful and that I want to\navoid at all costs I choose to step in\nfront of that is Dharma and why doesn't\nis not confusing right like everyone\nunderstands why I'm doing it because my\nkid is involved and because my I have a\nDharma to my child to protect them so I\nstep into the path of the gun but if we\ntunnel down into this what we see is\nthat Varma is the thing that allows you\nto face the negativity in life face the\nadversity in life face pain in life and\nactually even choose pain or adversity\nin life so I'll give you guys a kind of\na quick story okay so you guys like\nstories oh wow there's another type\ntrain going on and people are yeah thank\nyou to everyone who's subscribing so\nokay so okay so\na couple thousand years ago I'm gonna\ntell story from the maja part then and\nthe Pug glad to keep that for those of\ny'all who don't know okay so a couple\nthousand years ago there was there was a\ncivil war going on in India between two\ngroups of people the bond ava's and the\ngoat of us so I'm gonna give you guys\nsome backstory okay let me just think\nabout where to start okay so there's two\nsets of there's just so many stories\nthat are all like inter woman okay so\nlet's start a couple generations back\nokay so there is a king who's married\nand is having trouble having children\nand he's got two wives so what they do\nis they call the sage like they call\nlike a yogi and they say hey can you\ncome help us have children because we're\nunable to have children\nand so the the sage comes over and he\nsays yeah I'm happy to help you have\nchildren so this is where things get a\nlittle bit weird so there's some kind of\nritual or whatever and then literally\nthe way the story is is that the sage is\nlike in a room and he calls one of the\nKings wives in and then he like bestows\nupon her divine he bestows upon her his\nlike divine radiance right so unclear\nwhat that means and you know it's just a\nweird story so I don't I don't really\nknow what that means but and then she's\nso like taken aback by it it's so\noverwhelming for her that she closes her\neyes and then like leaves the room and\nthen the second wife comes in and the\nsage bestows upon her his divine\nradiance and then she becomes physically\nill and leaves the room and then later a\nmaid enters the room and she's able to\nwithstand like the full force of His\ndivine radiance and so she doesn't look\naway and she doesn't get sick and then\nshe leaves the room and so lo and behold\nall three women get pregnant okay\nso unclear we're not gonna comment on\nwhat divine radiance is code for because\nI don't just it's not important for the\nstory\nbut what is important for the story is\nwhen the first wife gives birth since\nshe looked away her son is blind the\nsecond wife when she gives birth she was\nsickly so her son is sickly and then the\nthird person who's the the maid actually\nsince she sort of accepted the sages\ngift is actually like completely fine so\ndelivers like a healthy boy okay\nso I know you guys are just gonna walk\nokay so but let's just stop and think\nabout this so then the King has a has a\nchoice right so he has his eldest son\nwho's blind he has a second son who's\nsickly and he has his third not really\nhis son but The Maids kid who's sort of\nlike hale and hearty so two of the sons\nare of noble birth but the eldest is\nblind second was sickly third one is\nlike born of like common stock so who\ninherits the throne what do you guys\nthink okay so we're getting a lot of\nsuffer blind third kid or blind kid okay\nso great so turns out it's the second\nson so if the King says is that I King\ncan really can't be blind because the\nKing has to lead his troops in combat\nand etc so like I can't actually like\nhave my my eldest son in here at the\nthrone who should inherit the throne\nbecause it was sort of like eldest son\nkind of you know rules and then he also\ndecides that you know while the second\nson is sickly like he he's not like\ncommon stock so he's gonna go and herd\nthe throne okay so yeah that's a great\nguiles theme goes with everything we\nhave to watch that later but yeah so\nit's kind of like I get that I'm not\ngiving you guys like a very decent\npromise to answer these questions it's\njust I it's just weird\nright so most of the questions that I'm\ngonna ask I have answers that make no\nsense so sorry about that yeah so bond\ndues right so the eldest son his name is\nDrew\nokay so we've got a hype train going\nyeah\nso the eldest son is the rash he's the\nblind he's the blind son the second son\nhis name is Pandu and the third son's\nname is Vidor so the rest gets passed\nover for the throne Pandu inherits the\nthrone and then over time both through\nthrashed and Pandu get married and they\nhave children and so Ponder's kids are\ncalled the pandavas and drew thrashed\nkids are called the Kauravas\nokay yeah so just remember that there's\na blind king who's the eldest son who\ngot passed over and he has kids and then\nthe second son inherits and he has kids\nso who inherits the throne next after\nPandu\nto many names\nokay so the eldest son of the second\nking I mean the the the sick King King\nright\nso the Pandavas are gonna inherit the\nthrone but then what happens is the\nKauravas are jealous because the eldest\nof the Kauravas is this guy named er er\ndone and he says well my can't my father\nshould have been king but he got passed\nover so I should have been king and so\nit's not fair that I'm not king\nyeah too many names okay so I'll file\nthat away for future okay so so then\nhe's kind of jealous and then what he\ndoes so that the the I don't know how to\ndo this without names okay so there's\nI'm gonna have to do like oh I know what\nI can do here here here I have an idea\nokay let's do this way all right so\nlet's do this okay here we go okay let's\ndo this you see this fancy thing okay so\nthere is okay that's way too small okay\nbon dieu okay okay and then he so then\nthen what happens is borio ton is\njealous and says I deserve the epic loot\nof and walls need so fondues son is a\nguy named you dish there and he is the\nrightful inheritor so he actually gets\nto role need and the guild leader makes\nDuryodhana choose great\ngot it does that make sense we doing\nokay now okay and so then what happens\nDuryodhana is pissed\nwe good okay the guild leader is Bhishma\ndo you guys remember we talked about\nBheeshma\nthe boat King story\nokay send Duryodhana then invites\nyuddhistir to gamble okay so this guy\nsays hey let's gamble invites this theer\nto gamble so he says let's roll for it\nbuddy and so they they gamble and then\nyudhisthira loses a lot of stuff and\nthen eventually the REO then says well\nwhy don't you bet the kingdom man\nand then Duryodhan Yudhisthira says well\nI shouldn't bet the kingdom but okay cuz\nhe doesn't know how to say no because\nhe's addicted and then there's this guy\nnamed Krishna and Krishna has sort of\nbelieved to be divine question God\nquestions super shady dude okay and then\nKrishna says instead of betting the\nkingdom why don't you do this these are\nthe conditions of the bet if you lose\nDuryodhana gets to run the kingdom for\n13 years and the bond of Oz ie fondues\nkids called okay so okay so you dish\nthere is the head of the bond of us okay\nthis is his guilt so the bond of us have\nto go into hiding for 13 years and\nDuryodhana gets to run the rule the\nkingdom if at any point over those 13\nyears Duryodhana finds the Pandavas as\nin he gets vision of them the counter\nresets but if the bond of us can hide\nfor 13 years I know sorry a smaller text\nokay let's do this\nokay so will will have to all have to\nredo this later but okay so he says that\nyou have to you have to hide for 13\nyears and if you're unable to if you\ndon't get found then the bond of was\nreturned and then the rear then handle\nhands over the kingdom okay so then next\nso 13 years go by Duryodhana tries to\nfind the Pandavas and he fails\nokay and then what happens is the pond\nof us come back and the pond of us say\ncan I has my kingdom back please\nand what do you guys think theory that\nsays\nthe rear then says [ __ ] off and then\nyudishtir says okay that's fair\nyou guys deserve to be kings to your\ndaddy was eldest but was blind monk s\ntech w so how about we do have these so\nyou guys take half the kingdom and we'll\ntake half the kingdom because we're both\ncousins and your dad is a king and my\ndad is a king so how about we do have\nthese diría then says what\nwhat is the reason say\nthere you're done says [ __ ] off\nyou new loot is mine new tech w okay and\nthen you this sure says okay fine even\nif you want the kingdom\nwe are Nobles to and it is our Dharma to\nrule so give us five villages one for\neach brother that we can rule over one\nvillage each and like at least we don't\nhave to be like peasants like that's all\nwe want is like five villages one for\neach of us and then three or then says\n[ __ ] off new tech w GTFO copter okay so\nhe was basically like the first mobile\nplayer where he's just completely\nunreasonable and and then you there's\nlike kind of bummed out and then krishna\ngoes to the pond of us and says okay now\nyou guys have to fight you can't accept\nthis because it's fine to share your\nkingdom it's fine to even give up most\nof the kingdom but not ruling is not\ndoing your autonomous so you have to\nfight and so then a couple sometime\nlater yes so you guys I'm gonna be\ndropping other boomer bombs on y'all\nover time like roflcopter so then on the\neve of battle there's a guy named our\nJune so there are five brothers okay so\nyou dish there's the oldest you guys\nready for names beam is the second\norigin is the next one and then not cool\nand Sahadev these are the five brothers\nand this guy is the best warrior he's\nthe best\nand then Krishna who remember is\nquestioned God questioned divine whatevs\nkind of shady is actually Arjuna's\ncharioteer so there's this this story\nabout so on the eve of battle\nArjuna's gonna go fight and Krishna says\ncharioteer and Arjun says actually I\ndon't want to fight I don't think it's\nworth it I don't think it's worth it\nlike I don't want to kill people for the\nsake of like property like I just don't\nwant to fight because on the other side\nso there's a civil war going on so there\nare people that he grew up with and\npeople that he cares about including his\nteacher whom he loves a great deal who\ndecides that they want to and he just\nsays I don't wanna fight and so Argent's\nI mean Krishna says you have to fight\nand here's why and their conversation is\npsychotherapy 1.0 also known as the hug\nhe thought okay so that's like the first\ninstance of psychotherapy and what he\nbasically tells them is that you you've\ngot a fight because it's your Dharma and\nthat even if you suffer or you get hurt\nor you hurt people that you love that's\nworth it because you have to do your\nDharma so that's what karma is kind of\nlike a weird story I know this is not\nthe most exciting story but it's gonna\nset a background because you guys have\nto understand this stuff to get to the\nreal stories okay so basically what he\ntells Arjuna is that like even if you\ndon't want to fight you've got a fight\nbecause your cause is just and when your\ncause is just and it's your turn about\nyou have to do it you can't say no like\nyou can't you can't bow out you can't\nuncute you can't log off\nyou can't DC you've got to do it and so\nwhat we're gonna be talking about today\nis Dharma because if you can discover\nyour Dharma then you're able to do all\nof the negative things okay so this is\nwhere\nyeah so this is how you do that and\nthat's something called Dharma so then\nthe question becomes so Dharma means\nduty or responsibility okay I'm gonna\njust actually check with chat any\nquestions so far about this I know that\nlike it wasn't the best story okay a lot\nof questions okay okay good so we're\ngonna keep going so I want you guys so\nnow we're gonna talk about science real\nquick because if you guys want to change\nyour behavior Dharma is the way to do it\nand in the world of addiction there have\nbeen studies done that show that people\nwho are like people who succeed at\novercoming their addictions or ones that\nessentially find something actually I'm\nnot gonna talk about that yet I'm gonna\nask you guys so back when I was in\nmedical school I had a patient who\nsmoked and I would ask the patient I\nwould say hey like you should stop\nsmoking because you know it's bad for\nyou and he says yeah hi doc I really\nwant to I really want to stop smoking\nand then so I being you know the the\nclever little medical student first of\nall pointed out that I was not actually\na full doctor yet and then I said well\nyeah I think you should stop smoking\nbecause you know if you don't smoke\nyou're gonna get lung cancer and it's\ngonna be really bad and you can get\nemphysema and COPD and I told them all\nthe reasons that it's it's not a good\nidea to smoke because all that is bad\nright and we don't want bad stuff right\ntwitch at we don't want bad things so\nwhat do you think happened did he quit\ndidn't quit so comes back a few weeks\nlater and I asked him yes s [ __ ] off I\nasked him so how's how's the has the not\nquitting smoking going and he says well\nit's it's tough doc I I haven't been\nable to stop you know and so then I said\nokay so no big deal so there are\nmedications that we can give you and you\ncan use nicorette gum and chantix and\nthings like that that tell them like\nit's really important that you quit\nsmoking because you know if you don't\nget some if you don't quit not only is\nthere emphysema and stuff like that\nthere's also other worse things like\nheart disease and strokes you can have a\nheart attack you can have a stroke and\nhere's some medications and then go and\nthen quit and he says yeah doc I'm thank\nyou so much I'm really gonna quit and\nthen\ndid it work what do you guys think did\nhe quit smoking\nnope so here's the question chat what do\nI have to talk to the guy about or what\ndo I tell him to get him to quit smoking\nhow do we create a change\nokay yes then I say okay dude he comes\nin the next time gonna say you got to\nquit because it's your Dharma and then\nhe says what and then I tell him that\nstory and he gets lost in all the Indian\nnames and doesn't understand and then\ndoesn't quit smoking so\nyou\nokay right so now we're getting\nsomewhere right so a lot of twitch chat\nis okay amongst all the CAC w's and\nmemes and so then so people are saying\nfamily right so the guys older he has he\nhas a kid and then I start asking him\nquestions okay do you ever want to see\nyour daughter go to college do you ever\nwant to see her get married do you want\nto ever meet your grandkids\nand then\nright so then he goes full feelsbadman\nand then he actually quits so like how\ndoes that work\nright so I gave him lots of information\nlike he wants to quit it's bad it's bad\nhe doesn't like it he doesn't want to be\nand so here's the question here's the\nreal question that I asked him you guys\nready for it\nthis is where I learned so you guys know\nthat sometimes I say things that are\nkind of like me and dickish on twitch\nit's not because I'm trying to be mean\nor dick alright this is the question you\nguys ready for it when you walk your\ndaughter down the aisle do you want to\nbe wheeling an oxygen tank behind you\nthat's the question\nright that's when and then and so that\nwas like before I you know knew how to\nbe a psychiatrist so I was still\nlearning how to do those things but and\nhe gave me such a look of abject horror\nher but then we started talking more but\nthat's it right so so what is that like\nwhat is that that's thermal but what\ndoes that mean so in science we call it\na competing interest so information so\nif you look at studies on addiction we\nsee that people who are able to quit\naddictions and let's just think about\nwhat an addiction so an addiction is\nlike something that makes you feel\nreally good and in the case of something\nlike nicotine or alcohol actually has\ncircuits in your brain that are telling\nyou like hey smoke this cigarette you\ndumbass\nsmoke it now smoke it again and like\nsame thing with alcohol like you can\nliterally die if you're if you're\naddicted to alcohol and you stop\ndrinking cold turkey there's a chance\nthat you will have like seizures and can\nhave like life-threatening like you\ncould die from alcohol withdrawal it's a\npotentially lethal condition it's\ndangerous and so that as your body goes\ninto withdrawal there are powerful\npowerful things telling you to drink so\nit's not just psychological it's not\njust like the weak level stuff that\nwe're talking about when we talk about\nvideo game addiction and building your\nlife and finding purpose like that's\nlike low level stuff that's like news\nit's like it's like the noob tutorial\nisland before you go to the real place\nand then you deal with like\nquote-unquote real addiction switch\nwhich is like the physiologic addictions\nwhich have much more powerful drivers\nand so how do you overcome those and you\nhave to have something called a\ncompeting interest you have to have\nsomething that lets that makes you\nchoose embrace the difficulty of the\nroad that you're gonna walk it has to be\nlike you have to do it for the right\nreason you have to have purpose value\nokay it can't be it can't just be like\nan arbitrary goal like no one wants lung\ncancer it has to be something that you\ncare about so now\nso that's like basically Sciences like\nversion of autonomous so it from\nspirituality we call it Dharma and from\nscience we call it a competing interest\nso competing interest is crucial to\naccept pain because the problem is that\nlike you need to pick a path that has\npain that's the goal is to pick a path\nof pain and how do you do that you say\nit five times fast pick a path pain pick\na path pain pick a path it so how do you\npick that you find a competing interests\nor Dharma so then the next natural\nquestion becomes well how do you find\nyour Dharma so this is where we're gonna\nget to sort of the crux of what we're\ntalking about today so the first is that\nif you can find your Dharma and you can\nlive in service to your Dharma then you\ncan accomplish all kinds of stuff so\nlike for example when I talk to people\nwho are unemployed and put their lives\nback together sometimes it's because\nthey like meet someone or they get\nsomeone pregnant and they're like oh\n[ __ ] I have to grow up and if they grow\nup like they don't they can't just like\nkeep screwing around and they find that\nthat's like their Dharma and then\nthey're able to put their lives together\nso the question is you have multiple\nautonomous so the question is how do you\ngo about finding your Dharma and this is\nwhere we kind of get to the crux of\nwhat's applicable and that is that most\npeople try to base their goals on\ndesires not on values and Dharma is\nabout living a life of values not\ndesires so the question is what is the\ndifference between a value and a desire\nwhat do you guys think\nyou\n[Music]\nyou\nokay\nyou\nokay this is great so someone said wants\nand needs external and internal value is\npermanent and internal so this is why I\nlove doing this right because all of you\nguys are wrong and none of that helps\nanyone I mean sorry all of you guys are\nright sorry and none of that helps\nanyone so like we can talk about values\nand desires and it doesn't help anyone\nlike okay so you guys say like okay it's\ninternal I completely agree higher\npurpose completely agree desires are\nbiological drives okay fine desires want\nlike all of that stuff is true and it\ndoesn't help anyone so here's here's the\nanswer okay so I I do think that desires\nare external and values are internal but\nvalues are what drive you to action but\nboth can drive you to action but values\ngenerally speaking drive you towards\naction in spite of suffering and desires\nrarely do but you can desire something\nand not enough and it can kind of drive\nyou to action anyway despite negativity\nso what the yogi said is that desires\nhave their origins in the invidious in\nthe india's or the sense organs so if it\noriginally comes from a sense organ then\nit's a desire so let's just think about\nthat what does that mean so let's think\nabout I want a hot dog\nis that a desire or a value right why\nlike you can we all agree that it's a\ndesire right even if you don't accept it\nso forget the answer that I gave you\nguys just think about it for a second if\nI'm walking down the street and I want a\nhot dog like where what is that that's a\ndesire right like we don't think about\nlike when we think about like what are\nyour values like when you have a mission\nstatement from an NGO or a non-profit\neating a hot dogs is not gonna be on\nthere right like that's not the kind of\nthing that goes into a mission stay\nbecause values go into mission\nstatements not eating hot dogs if I want\na particular car where does that come\nfrom\nvalue or desire right okay so then we\nget into this issue of materialism so\nour Alma are all desires material and\nI'm talking about hot dogs and cars and\nthat is not necessarily so does that\nmean that all desires are material so\nlet's say that I'm walking down the\nstreet and I see a guy my age and a girl\nroughly my age holding hands sitting on\na park bench and then I say to myself I\nwant that\nthat's not material right so is that a\ndesire or a value ah ah see now we're\ngetting we're getting tricky right so\nthis is exactly why we're having this\nconversation\nso the yogi said if it comes from the in\nvarious it's actually a desire so not\nall desires have to be materialistic and\nso if we think about something like\nloneliness so like loneliness and a\nfeeling like a like if you're missing\ncompanionship that doesn't come from a\nparticular sense organ right that\nfeeling comes from within India is ind\nrry okay so the first thing to\nunderstand is that if you're thinking\nabout your goals in life and the the\ngoals that you set for yourself where do\nthey originate do they originate and\nthings that you saw did you walk down\nthe street and see your friend who used\nto weigh 400 pounds and now weighs 160\nand then you say to yourself man I want\nto lose weight\nthat doesn't sound materialistic it\ndoesn't sound bad it sounds like Noble\nit sounds like a good goal right like\nany doctor can get behind that\nand yet what happens when you try to\npursue that goal right like what happens\nyou fail right why because it's a desire\nso it's a good desire desires don't have\nto be evil even if you look at someone\neating a salad you're like man I should\neat more salad still a desire so the key\nis to find values because values drive\nyour internal like like that's where\nmotivation comes from its fulfillment of\nvalues and the problem is that most\npeople don't even understand what their\nvalues are so like if you're like I'm\njust gonna you know I'm gonna have a\nvery poor sense of what twitch at is but\nI'm just gonna think about the person\nthat I work with who like is the most\ndesperate so if you're 24 unemployed\nliving at home playing video games all\nday that's the person that I started\nstreaming for by the way that person you\nthink about the goals that you set up\nthey're all based on desires\nnone of them are based on values that's\nthe problem you think about financial\nindependence wonderful you think about\nmoving out of the house also wonderful\nyou think about you know wanting this\nand wanting that and not wanting this\nand not wanting that looking this way\nfeeling this way not being overweight\neating healthy like all wonderful goals\nall desires all desires because they're\nbased in the invidious so that's not\nwhat naturally motivates behavior like\nyou can you can motivate behavior\nthrough desires but if you really want\nto move forward you need a Tarma because\nthe Dharma tells you that you can't\nafford to fail because it's bigger than\nyou it's a duty it's a responsibility\nand we see this because the cool thing\nis when I talked to that 24 year old or\n19 year old or 31 year old and we see\nhow far they're willing to go for a\nfriend it's amazing they're not willing\nto do anything for themselves but if it\ncomes to a friend like if your friend is\nsick and they need like nutritious\nhealthy food\nthen they'll do it because that's your\nDharma right helping a friend isn't the\nharm that you can get behind that\ndoesn't have to do with a desire you\nguys see that like it doesn't come from\nthe sense organs helping your friend is\nnot like you're not walking down the\nstreet and you're like man that guy in\nthe car next to me he's carrying a bag\nand that looks like chicken noodle soup\nand he's carrying it for a friend of his\nI should really do that right that's not\nhow that works that comes from within\nthat's a value so the biggest problem is\nthat the things that you're the things\nthat drive you forward our desires and\ndesires are not going to stand up that\nonce again like this is coming full\ncircle when I was when we were talking\nabout progress or growth you're thinking\nabout a positive thing right so you're\nlike I'm gonna eat a salad every day and\nI'm gonna lose weight and I'm gonna be\nhealthy and that feels good like that's\nprogress that's growth that's what we\nwant but when you actually do it you're\nnot able to do it because it's actually\ndifficult to do and it hurts like every\nbite of romaine lettuce like hurts you\nright it hurts you deep within your\nmouth because like that's what it's like\nand it's not worth it\nthat's the basic problem desires are not\nworth the suffering and that's why\neveryone isn't a millionaire because\neveryone wants to be a millionaire but\npeople are wait aren't willing to work\nfor it they're not willing to subject\nthemselves to the things that they need\nto do in order to become a millionaire\nand that too is because once again\ngamers would rather waste time doing\nnothing than waste time doing something\nthat may not work so you would rather\nplay video games for an entire year then\ntake a step forward to becoming a\nmillionaire because that may not work\nout\nand that's because it's based in a\ndesire so if you want to get away from\nthat you have to base it in a value\nbasing it in a value is the same thing\nas finding a competing interest is the\nsame thing as finding your Dharma\nbecause if we think about you know like\nif I need a million dollars to like pay\nfor my kids cancer treatment like that's\na different thing you know which\nAmerican health care system aside so it\nchanges the way that you you act and it\nchanges the way that you think and it\nchanges the most important thing is it\nchanges daughter might changes your\ntolerance for pain it allows you to\nchoose things that are uncomfortable and\nsuck when I want call for 24 hours like\nthat sucks but I do it and I do it\nwillingly because like I realize that\nthere were like people here that I have\nto like take care of and if I don't take\ncare of them like no one's gonna take\ncare of them so it's gotta be me\nand so that's what thought of us so the\nissue is that you guys need to find your\nDharma because if you can find your\nDharma then everything else becomes side\nquests like the problem is that like\nlike losing weight is not a main quest\nit's a side quest and the problem is\nthat you treat it like a main quest like\nall I'm doing in my life is losing\nweight no man that's a side quest making\nmoney side quest losing weight side\nquest getting healthy side quest the\nproblem is like no one has a main quest\nthat's what you need you need the main\nquest because in order to fulfill the\nmain quest you've got to lose weight you\ngot to make money like that's how it\nworks right like in a game you go and\nyou get this piece of gear the side\nquest to get the piece of gear doesn't\nactually that's not winning the game\nit's just you need to beat this boss and\nyou need a piece of gear\nso you need a main quest and that's what\nanima is duty responsibility that's like\nwhat a main quest is in an RPG right\nthat's not that's not like an analogy\nthat's like the Dharma of the\nprotagonist is the main quest that's how\nit works and like you just think about\nlike what they do right like they they\nwithstand all kinds of pain and\nsuffering because it's like so you guys\nhave you like the ultimate main quest in\nthe ultimate Dharma is Frodo in the ring\nFrodo in the ring you guys need to go to\nMordor and like drop the ring and it's\nlike it's painful and it sucks and it's\nterrible and you're gonna be thirsty and\nyou're willing to do it because it's the\nmain quest because that's your\ntournament that's like the Lord of the\nRings is a story about Dharma but the\nproblem yeah where does your Sam was\nI don't think you guys realize this\nyou're looking at your Samwise\nI am you're Samwise that's what I'm\ndoing I am samurais\nI'm not Gandalf I'm Sam Weiss right\nI'm here to help you\nI'm helping you this is what I'm doing\nI'm carrying your pack you're sitting\nthere whining about how you're hungry\nand you want strawberries and stuff like\nthat and I'm keeping your spirits up and\ninside I'm raging at you and want to\nthrottle e because you're such a whiny\nlittle Hobbit but I mean yeah so I guess\nI'm not the actual hero so maybe I'm not\nthe same wise but yeah so like I'm I'm\none of the members of the fellowship so\nI'm helping you guys out but y'all have\nto carry the ring like you've got to\ncarry it to Mordor I can't carry it to\nMordor for you so questions thoughts\nI call ya I'm Gollum badly today\nmy precious hurts us okay\n[Music]\nokay let me just think for a second okay\nso how to find her beautiful\nokay so so this is a question that's\nthat's so now we get to the real\nquestion right how do you find your\nDharma so the first thing is you knock\nout things that are rooted in the in\nthere is so you like think about what\nyour goals are and you just knock out\nlike I feel like we should do this on\ndiscord because this works better when I\ncan actually like interact with live\nhuman beings and help you guys find your\nDharma\nokay so like think about what your goals\nare and think about whether they're\nrooted in the India's so if they're\nrooted in the India's they're not gonna\nbe your Dharma so the other way that I\nthink about it is like make a list of\nthings that you want and things that you\ncare about\nand you'll be amazed right so that's\nwhere I think it starts so the first\nthing you have to do in terms of like\nwe're gonna have to stop in a few\nminutes because we have to meditate so I\ndon't mean to leave you guys hanging\nit's just the LS interview took way\nlonger so the first thing is to\nunderstand what is not values and to\nunderstand what is desires and knock\nthose off the plate that's actually half\nthe battle\nand just ask yourself like what do you\nactually care about what are the things\nthat you are would do for the sake like\nwhat what are the things that you can do\nand endure pain for those are going to\nbe your values\nah so now people are asking I don't care\nabout anything though\nbeautiful therein lies the problem\ntherein lies the problem right so you\nare the person who is walking into my\noffice and saying I want to quit smoking\nand then I ask you do you want to walk\nyour daughter down the aisle carrying an\noxygen tank and you say I don't have\nkids and then I say okay do you wanna\nand then I ask question after question\nafter question and you're like yeah\nright so therein lies your problem if\nyou don't have a competing interest no\nwonder you're not changing your life\nso the question is how do you develop a\ncompeting interest if you have nothing\nthat's worthwhile in life what do you do\nabout that how do you handle that\ndon't just get yourself a kid that's a\nterrible idea so that's a longer\nexploration but I think it comes from a\ncouple of places so it comes from\nexperience and it comes from study and\nit comes from reflection so the first\nthing that I would say is go out and do\nsomething so a Daruma\nis not just like the product of a\nlogical mind saga by is a product of\nexperience so you need to stop living in\nyour head and start living in the world\nso go out and do something anything I\ndon't care what it is right ah so\nsomeone says what if I'm socially\nanxious exactly exactly you go and you\ndo things despite your social anxiety\nthis is exactly my point is that like\nyou have to do something it doesn't you\nhave to be with people just go out and\ndo something go do something if you're\nan introvert go do something alone you\ndoesn't have to be with people what that\nthing is I'm not sure that's what you've\ngot to figure out go out and take a walk\nI don't know where you live like a lot\nof people from Scandinavia apparently\nit's cold in Boston too so taking a walk\nis hard right it can even be like like\nif there's someone that you know that's\nlike been having a rough time like text\nthem be like hey how are things going\nlike it can be anything do something for\nyourself treat yourself like you would\ntreat your friend\nso like cook yourself a healthy meal\nlike learn how to cook something so\nright now your daughter Maya isn't\ntaking care of you if you have no other\ntime' and you're going nowhere in life\nyour Dharma is that you should take care\nof yourself don't do it don't do it from\nthe I perspective do it from a\nthird-person perspective so understand\nthat you're a human being who deserves\nto be like helped out and you should\ngive yourself a helping hand\nyeah today was beautiful in\nMassachusetts go and do something and\nlike take care of yourself and so\nwhatever that thing is is it cleaning\nyour room a little bit which we've\ntalked about room cleaning stream is it\nI don't know go help an animal go\nvolunteer if you want to just do\nsomething learn how to cook something\nand make yourself something delicious\nand healthy like make yourself something\ndelicious and healthy or meditate okay\nso that's where we're gonna stop for\ntoday I'm gonna go ahead and meditate I\nknow that in a sense like I haven't\ngiven you guys any answers because I'm\njust like sort of sad like this is how\nto do it it's time and then you guys are\nall asking okay well then how do we find\ntottemo but I want you all to understand\nthat like learning what not to do and\nlearning how you work even if you don't\nhave all the answers yet is perfectly\nfine so going forward now that you\nunderstand the difference between\nIndia's sense organs desires and values\nand you understand the relationship of\nDharma now when you struggle to do\nsomething and you don't meet your goals\nat least you understand why so my whole\napproach is that you understand how you\nwork don't come to me for answers don't\ncome to me to improve your life I can't\nimprove your life I can't do that I\ncan't improve anyone's life all I can\nhelp you do is understand how your life\nworks I can help you understand how you\nwork I can be an owner's manual for you\nthat I can do what you guys do with that\nthat's up to you I'm solid myself of all\nresponsibility I can't help you I can\nteach you how you work that's all I can\ndo and I can tell you understand what\nwhat that you you know if you're living\na life of desires that's why you can't\nmove forward because the desires aren't\nenough it's not enough so cut yourself a\nbreak\nand then look for Dharma this is the\nother thing karma is something that is\nsought so now you should start looking\nfor it you'll be amazed\nyou'll be able to find it if you look\nyou'll be able to find it you go out you\nexperience you'll be able to find it\nreally believe that and then we can go\nit more into values desires in Parma\npart 2 so there's like many parts to\nDharma so this is just the first lecture"
