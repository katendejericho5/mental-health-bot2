    "transcript": "and if there is one thing that I think\nis responsible for the most change in\nmeditation that I've seen it is the\ndevelopment of a one pointed mind and so\nthe practice of meditation is about\ndeveloping one pointed mind so let's\njust think a little bit about this so\nhere's an analogy for you guys okay\nso let's say I have a light bulb so if I\nhave a light bulb then the light is like\nshines out in all directions right so\nthat's just kind of what light does is\nlike you're sending rays in all these\ndifferent directions and that's pretty\ncool but like a light bulb doesn't do\nmuch besides provide sight right it\nprovides light and that's what a light\nbulb is for if you get really close to a\nlight bulb you can start to feel heat\nbut it doesn't actually affect any\nchange in the world that just offers\nsome illumination so a light bulb is a\ncase of a source of light that is\ndissipated in all directions\ncompare that to a laser beam so a laser\nbeam is a source of light or multiple\nsources of light that are concentrated\nthrough a focus and like just think\nabout what a laser beam can do a laser\nbeam can like literally cut through\nthings and if you think about sort of\nthe energy from a light bulb in the\nenergy from the laser beam those are\nrelatively I mean in theory they can be\nsomewhat similar but the difference\nbetween a light bulb 'ln and laser beam\nis that one has like a focused kind of\nlike a concentration of energy in focus\nand the other one is dissipated so when\nI teach people to meditate one of the\nmain goals that I have is to is to help\nthem create a concentrated mind and then\nonce you concentrate all of your mental\nenergy and you train yourself to keep it\nin one area and focus it a lot of\nwonderful things start to happen so the\nfeatures of a concentrated mind are\ntheir three that we're gonna talk about\none is that it focuses so this is kind\nof the ability to follow through which\nwe'll talk a lot about it and and this\nis I think the main reason that I wanted\nto talk about this today the second is\nthat it creates a relaxed mind in the\nthird is that it creates an it like an\ninsatiable so a concentrated mind leads\nto kind of follow through leads to\nrelaxation and leads to enjoyment so\nwe're gonna talk about the first one\nwhich is focus\nso a strong mind is one that is focused\nand a weak mind is one that is\ndissipated so it's it's spreading his\nenergy in lots of different areas and if\nI had to kind of go through what I think\nthe central problem of a lot of people\nthat I work with today it's that they\nhave a weak mind and what I mean by a\nweak mind is that their mind has\ndissipated it's going in this direction\nit's going in that direction it's going\nover here it's going over there and that\nif you think about people who tend to be\naccomplished in life their mind is\nstrong and what we think about is strong\nwhat the way I'm defining why they're a\nstrong mind is one that is capable of\nfocus so this is also like the point\nthat I need to kind of make a segue with\nwhich is that a lot of people think that\nthey're lazy and I get where you're\ncoming from like you think you're lazy\nbut if we really tunnel down and this is\na lot of what we're gonna do today is\nwe're gonna tunnel down and define in\nour mind what these broad terms me so if\nyou think about someone who is lazy\nthere's someone who thinks about doing\nsomething but doesn't actually do it\nbecause then they start thinking about\nother things like I need to clean my\nroom but then you're like I don't feel\nlike cleaning my room let me watch TV\nyou turn on the TV and then you're\noccupied by the TV that is laziness\nright but like that's laziness is like a\nbehavior but if we think about what's\ngoing on in the mind it is literally a\nmind that is fluctuate a mind that is\ndissipated a mind that is going in\ndifferent places so laziness is a weak\nmind and a weak mind it is a dissipated\nmind and a strong mind is one that is\nfocused that once you focus your mind\nand you point it in a particular\ndirection that's the direction that it\ngoes through to and this is the problem\nof follow-through right so a lot of\npeople have difficulty with\nfollow-through it's like one of the most\nbasic problems and so if we think about\nfundamentally how do we how do we fix\nfollow-through it is to develop a\nconcentrated mind a mind that is capable\nof thinking about the same thing for a\nlong period of time and this is what I\nthink is awesome about meditation\nbecause meditation is teaching youth\nHana which is literally practicing the\nconcentration of your mind on a single\npoint without wavering and if you can\nattain that skill then you will no\nlonger be lazy\nand when I say no longer be lazy what I\nmean is be lazy in the way that I'm lazy\nso I'm still a lazy [ __ ] you guys saw\nlike the dough Don on my screen and\nstuff like that so like like I still am\nlazy I don't like to work I don't enjoy\nworking but the difference between me\nand a lot of other people they think\nthat oh I'm like super hard-working I\nhave a lot of willpower I'm super smart\nI'm way smarter than I am but once again\nI've maintained from the very beginning\nI'm really not that much smarter than\nanyone or may not be smarter than the\naverage person who's watching the stream\nthe difference between me and all of you\nguys and I'm making assumptions there is\nthat I have trained my mind to\nconcentrate on one point\nthat's it it's not an issue of laziness\nit's not an issue of intelligence it is\nan issue of I have spent the time and\ntrained my mind to concentrate on one\nthing that's it so let's go back to\nfollow-through so follow-through is due\nto scattering of mind okay so like let's\njust think about this one day I resolved\nto do something right so I say like okay\ntomorrow I'm gonna stop playing video\ngames or tomorrow I'm gonna like wake up\nand I'm gonna work out every day and if\nyou think about it like if you study\nyour mind in that moment the resolve of\nyour mind is actually like through the\nroof the power of your mind is actually\nreally high it's not that you're like\nhalf-assing your desire or your your\nyour desire to commit to something\nyou're committed in that moment your\ncommitment is real it's authentic and\nyou're like you're really hardcore\nyou're not deluding yourself you're not\nfaking it you're not pretending the\npower of your mind in that moment is\nactually really strong so why don't\npeople follow through so you're like\nyeah tomorrow tomorrow I'm gonna do it\nI'm gonna go to the gym and you resolve\nto yourself if you think about it the\npower of the mind in that moment is\nactually strong the next day we say that\nyour resolve wavers so what does that\ntruly mean what goes on in the mind does\nit mean that the strength of your mind\nis different so you may think so you may\nthink like oh I had all that passion and\nthat that energy then and today I don't\nbut if I would argue that the strength\nof your mind is still the same the\nanalytical capability of mind is still\nthe same\nit's actually the focus that has been\nlost that a resolution of mind is a high\ndegree of focus on one area and then you\nwere focused and I was looking over\nthere okay Jim Jim Jim Jim Jim and then\nthe next day video games\nNetflix going to the grocery store\nhanging out with my friends going to the\ndog Oh Jim I feel like hanging out with\nmy dog I got to take my dog for the walk\nI got a shower I got a clean I gotta do\nthis I gotta do that I got to play some\ndota I got to watch some Netflix so it's\nnot actually strength of the mind it's\nnot analytical capability it's not\nintelligence it's not laziness it is\nconcentration is it it is a fluctuation\nand your ability to focus so your mind\nresolves in one direction and then it\nresolves in the complete opposite like\noh yeah I'm gonna go to the gym tomorrow\nyou wake up the next day I'm gonna play\nsome dota like just think about how\nresolved your mind is you think about\nthat as a loss of resolution it isn't a\nloss of resolution you are super\nresolved to going to the gym yesterday\nand you are equally resolved to do\nanything but go to the gym today this is\nwhat procrastination is right you are\nyou are resolved to do anything but the\nwork that needs to be done so your mind\nis still has the same degree of\nresolution it just it's focus is lacking\nthe resolution fluctuates what you put\nyour mind to fluctuates over time so the\nfundamental problem with follow 3 and\nprocrastination or all this [ __ ] is a\nlack of concentration on one point in\nthe mind so your mind thinks in one way\nand then thinks in the other way so it's\nnot about strength it's not about lake\nlaziness it's about focus so the goal of\nmeditation is to develop a practice\nwhere you train your mind to focus on\none point and once it learns how to\nfocus on one point it's sort of like\nteaching a dog like a trick right like\nonce you train a dog like once you train\nit how to be potty trained then like it\nknows like where do we use the bathroom\nand at the beginning it's tough but once\nit knows where to use the bathroom it\nalways goes there and it does the\nbathroom where it's supposed to\nand so the difference between me and a\nlot of the people who think that I'm Way\nsmarter or way over Harvard and a\nfivehead nd whatever is it's not that\nI'm smarter it's not that I have greater\nwillpower\nI'm still lazy it's just that I have\nlike levelled up my concentration skill\nand by leveling up my concentration\nskill what I'm able to do is I tell my\nmind to do something and then it\nactually like runs with that for a while\nit doesn't run with it forever but it\nruns with it longer than many other\npeople and I'd say that's the difference\nbetween like where I was let's say at\nthe age of 21 and where I am today which\nis like 15 16 years later which is that\nice I learned how to like concentrate my\nmind and then I started like\nconcentrating it and I'd say like okay\nI'm gonna do some research so I like sat\ndown and like I did research for a while\nstill played a lot of video games still\ndid a lot of procrastination but I\nlearned enough of the skill of\nconcentration to where my mind was\nfocused on one thing so the next quality\nof the mind is that a mind is is relaxed\nand is also like enjoyable so if we\nthink about people who describe a flow\nstate so there I get a lot of questions\nabout a flow state so a flow state is is\na state of mind where your mind is kind\nof like concentrated on one thing and\npeople find the experience of a flow\nstate to be Pleasant right it's like fun\nto be in a flow State it's fun to sort\nof be lost in like a certain kind of\nwork like if I'm sitting down and I'm\npainting I don't paint but I've talked\nto people who have painted and they sort\nof enter this meditative state where\nthey really enjoy it they're absorbed in\nthe painting they're doing exactly what\nthey want to do it's kind of fun it's\nrelaxing and it's concentrated so those\nthree things go together right focus of\nthe mind relaxation and to find\nsomething enjoyable and so now let's\nthink about this for a second so like -\nlike what does that mean if you say that\na concentrated mind is enjoyable but\naren't like external things enjoyable\nlike when we think about enjoyment we\ndon't think about a state of mind right\nwe think about an external thing so I\nsay like okay I enjoy a movie or I enjoy\na particular food or I enjoy spending\ntime with someone so like we think about\nenjoyment is coming from external things\nwe don't try to understand enjoyment in\nterms of ourself so let's do that for a\nsecond let's try to see if we can\nunderstand the nature of enjoyment and\nhow enjoyment relates to\nmy mind so it is my belief or my\nexperience that enjoyment has to do with\nconcentration of the mind and if we\nthink about enjoyable experiences if we\nactually study our mind while we are\nenjoying something we will see that our\nmind is concentrated so if I go to the\nmovies and like the movie is engaging\nthen my mind is fully focused on the\nmovie I mean then my mind is fully\nfocused on the movie right and that\nmeans I'm enjoying the movie the\ndefinition of a movie that's enjoyable\nis one that fully concentrates your mind\nand so let's think about what can cause\na movie to not be enjoyable let's say\nsomeone rings of their cell phone rings\nand they start talking in the theater\nwhat does that do to your enjoyment it\nshatters your enjoyment what does that\ndo to the concentration of your mind the\nreason that that makes your your mind\nnot have fun is because your\nconcentration moves from the movie to\nthe the person who's talking on the cell\nphone so we can see that as the\nconcentration of your mind wavers our\nenjoyment drops and if we think about\nsomething like a boring movie so what is\na movie that we call boring it's a movie\nthat doesn't capture our attention and\nconcentrate our mind on the movie our\nmind starts to wander that's what\nhappens when you're bored your mind\nstarts to wander and boredom is the\nopposite of enjoyment therefore we can\nsee that like enjoyment involves\nconcentration of the mind and boredom\ninvolves a wandering mind and therefore\nis like a wandering mind is going to be\nan unenjoyable mind right it's kind of\nlike simple if you just stop and you\nlook at the nature of enjoyment you'll\nsee that enjoyment involves\nconcentration of the mind and if you can\nshatter or change the concentration of\nthe mind that experiences is going to be\nless enjoyable okay I'm talking in\nsweeping generalizations and I'm sort of\ndoing that for educational purposes or\ninstructive purposes so you can also\nthink about other things like let's say\nyou get a massage so like when you get a\nmassage if the massage is like really\ngood your mind is concentrating on the\nmassage you're like feeling let's say\nthey're like they're massaging your neck\nor your shoulders or something like that\nand then like you're fully focused on\nthat and you're like man that feels\namazing or if you're eating food like if\nyou really really enjoy food if you eat\nsomething that's delicious like take a\nbite of something and it's just like so\ndelicious you're my\nis concentrated on that point right like\nthat's kind of how it works\nand then like imagine you're at a\nmassage like you're getting a massage\nand then your cell phone rings and then\nit sort of like breaks your immersion\nand if it breaks your emotion the\nconcentration of your mind begins to\nwaver and is the concentration of your\nmind begins to waver then you you start\nto experience less enjoyment so along\nwith enjoyment I'm sort of tossing in\nrelaxed we're gonna kind of gloss over\nthat for now but the next point that I\nkind of want to talk about is that a\nconcentrated mind is capable of greater\nunderstanding it's not just analysis but\nit's kind of like this issue of like a\nlight bulb or a laser beam where if I\nconcentrate my mind\nthe amount of understanding I'm able to\ngain from a particular set of like\ninformation is gonna be way greater so\nI've talked about this a little bit on\nstream before but if you think about the\nprocess of studying right like if I\nstudy like let's say I have a textbook\nin the first page of the textbook I'm\nreading it and I read it and I like\ndon't understand it so I read it again\nand I read it again and I read it again\nand the fifth time I read it I\nunderstand everything on the page so\nlet's just think about how that works\nfrom sort of like a like a science or\nmathematics of the mind does that mean\nthat with each time I read the paper I\ngain 20 percent of the information no\nbecause there are other times where I\ncan read the page once and I understand\neverything that the page says so why do\nI sometimes have to read the page five\ntimes and other times I have to read the\npage once it's because of the nature of\nthe concentration of my mind if I'm\nstudying and someone is distracting me\nthen I have to read the page multiple\ntimes the greater the distraction the\nmore I have to to read the page if I'm\nfully focused then I have to read the\npage fewer times so if we think about\nthings like let's say adderall or other\nmedications that artificially improve\nyour focus like caffeine these are\nthings that increase the concentration\nof the mind increase our ability to\nfocus and improve the quality of\nstudying but at the end of the day the\nkey thing is it's not the adderall makes\nyou a better study err it's that anytime\nyour\nis focused on one thing you're able to\nunderstand more so this has nothing to\ndo with logic or analysis it just means\nthat we're sort of focusing our mind on\none thing and the more that you focus\nyour mind the the easier it is to\nunderstand and that applies to more than\njust studying as well so just another\nway to think about it is like if I go to\nthe library and I'm studying but I'm\nstressed out about something let's say\nthat I'm worried that you know like my\nmy one of my parents is sick and if we\nthink about how does worry affect our\nability to study so when we worry our\nconcentration from the piece of paper\nwaivers to other things right the\nconcentration of the mind dissipates the\nmind becomes weaker and we're unable to\nfocus as we're unable to focus it\nbecomes more difficult to study so we\ncan see that at the end of the day it is\nall about concentration of the mind so\nI'll give you guys a couple of other\nexamples so when I work with people like\nsome cool stuff sometimes happens so I\nteach people how to meditate and I think\none of the biggest things that's\nresponsible for their the changes in\ntheir life is is meditating and people\nare kind of like well why should I\nmeditate what does it do for me and so\nit's hard for me to kind of describe\nuntil now because I sort of sat down and\nconcentrated on this and then figured it\nout and that's why we started stream\nlate but it all comes down to focusing\nthe mind so I had a patient who I had\ntaught to meditate and they wanted to\nquit smoking and so they would come to\nmy office every week and we do this\ntechnique called motivational\ninterviewing which is sort of an\nevidence-based psychotherapy or\nintervention that you can do that helps\npeople stop using substances that they\ndon't want to use and we did\nmotivational interviewing for awhile I'm\na pretty good therapist they were pretty\ncommitted and they still sort of like\nthey would stop smoking for a while and\nthey would continue smoking after they\nwould like relapse and they'd start\nsmoking again they'd stop start stop\nstart so this is all a wavering mind\nright so they as they continued to\nmeditate they ended up going hiking and\nthey were doing some mountain climbing\nand one day their mind just sort of\nfocused on one point so they were like\nlike climbing a mountain and they\nstarted like\nhuffing and puffing and they were like\noh wow\nsmoking is my breath and the more I\nsmoke the harder it is for me to breathe\nand my breath is more important to me\nthan smoking is and they quit and\nthey've quit smoking it's just it just\nhappened like they had this moment of\nrealization where you know\nintellectually let that makes perfect\nsense logically that makes perfect sense\nlike it's not any like rocket science\nthat smoking and breath are related like\neveryone knows that but it's not\ninformation or logic that actually\ncauses people to change their behavior\nit's understanding and in that moment I\nthink this is because she was meditating\namong lots of other things so you can\nargue about what happened there with her\nbut in my experience this is what I see\nwhen I teach people to meditate is that\nthey have a degree of like focus and\nconcentration in their mind where they\nsort of have this revelation and then\nthey have some kind of understanding and\nonce they have that understanding then\ntheir behavior changes it's kind of like\nreally hard to describe but but that's\nwhat I see time and time and time again\nand this is what we call kind of the\nlight bulb going off in someone's mind\nright they're like something clicks and\nthen they change and it's my belief that\nclicking is facilitated through the\nconcentration of mind and that that\nconcentration of mind leads to greater\nunderstanding because like your mind is\nfully focused you're kind of fully zoned\ninto that and then you're able to\nunderstand things in kind of a different\nway and the cool thing about this is\nthat when I teach people to meditate\nit's not just like one part of their\nlife gets better so when I work with\npeople usually what happens is like a\nlot of different dimensions of their\nlife gets better they get happier in\ntheir job sometimes they change jobs\nthey get their like their marriages\nimprove they start to feel like better\nabout themselves their confidence\nimproves they start to take better\nphysical care of themselves it's kind of\nbizarre like they're like every\ndimension of their life starts to change\nand I don't think it's because I'm a\nmiracle worker I mean I think in general\nthere's this saying in psychiatry that\nall boats rise together so there's a\nwater level and like if you have you\nknow arthritis and depression if your\narthritis gets better than your\ndepression gets better if your\ndepression gets better there's your\ntry to skits - there's a lot of evidence\nthat suggests that this is just common\nwithin humans but in my experience I've\nseen the application of meditation work\nin each of their dimension of their life\nbecause once you concentrate your mind\nand you understand the thinking of your\nmind better you understand that things\naround you better you understand work\ndynamics better you work understand\nrelationship dynamics better you\nunderstand yourself better so\nconcentration of the mind sort of helps\nyour mind be fully focused on analyzing\nall these problems and so it sort of\nmakes sense that all of them are going\nto improve because if you improve if you\nlevel up the instrument through which\nyou're like acting in all of these\ndimensions in your life and then all of\nthose dimensions are going to get better\nright it's not anything magical it's\nsort of like if I'm playing an RPG and I\nhave a sword and like I get a better\nsword like my DPS against all kinds of\nmonsters is going to go up that's just\nhow the mind works so meditation is\nabout developing concentration of the\nmind and the first way to develop\nconcentration of the mind is the Hana\npattern means a focusing practice and\nwe're gonna get to that okay I'm gonna\ntake a break for a second because I got\na drink with some water and then also I\nwant to just check in because I can't\nsee chat okay okay I'm gonna just check\nin with you guys so like how is this for\ny'all is this good like is that you guys\nwith me okay it's like this is like a\nsummary from like start to finish to\nunderstand these different things okay\nso I'm gonna talk for a few more minutes\nand we're gonna get to questions okay\nall right so now we're gonna talk about\ngaming okay so let's just think about\nlike what effect does gaming okay I'm\ngonna interact a little bit with chat on\nthis one okay what an effect isn't\ngaming have on the mind what is gaming\ndo to your mind\nokay so I'm seeing a lot of different\nstuff right great so some people are\nsaying focus some people are saying\ndistraction so when you are playing a\ngame is your mind thinking about a lot\nof things or thinking about one thing\nthat is focused right so we're not\ntalking about and good someone said this\ndepends that is focused that's what I'm\nnot talking about like so like\ndistraction and psychology\nand dopamine and neuroscience we're not\ntalking about any of that right now\nwe're just talking about understanding\nliterally what is happening in your mind\nin a moment is it focused or is it\nwavering and people are saying it\ndepends right people are saying escape\nso let's just think about that the\nreason it is an escape is because your\nmind doesn't want to think about this\nand when I play a game I get lost in the\ngame I get focused in the game so this\nis important video games create an\nartificial set or non or artificial mr.\nthey they concentrate your mind on the\ngame and this and remember what is a\nconcentrated mind do it makes a\nconcentrated mind is enjoyable and\nrelaxed right so your mind really really\nenjoys gaming because gaming is an\nartificial sort of induction of like\nAdana it's almost like a tyrant like it\nfocuses your mind and then you can\nforget about everything else and that\nfeels really good because it feels good\nto have a concentrated mind now let's\nthink through a couple of examples in\ngaming where your mind wavers in its\nconcentration and let's see what impact\nit has on like the enjoyment so let's\nsay that I'm playing the game like let's\nsay I'm playing a game of overwatch and\nI'm just focusing on like I'm playing\nreinhardt and like I'm focusing on like\nlike like you know just blocking\npeople's like I'm focusing on you know\nshielding whatever thing is moving\nactually let's forget about it watch\nbecause again my mind is not able to\ncome up with the analogy as well enough\nokay so let's let's talk about data so\nif I'm playing a game of dota let's say\nyeah cuz I just can't I can't compute\nthe analogies so if I'm playing a game\nof dota like I'm focused on winning my\nlane right and I'm like super super\nfocused on winning in my lane I'm having\nfun and then someone like tee pees down\nto my lane and feeds and then what does\nmy mind do right so like if I start\nthinking if I stop thinking about the\ngame and start thinking about what\nsomeone else is doing in the game then I\nstart to rage or tilt right that's true\nof all games so forget about which one\nbut let's just think about at that point\nwhat is my mind actually thinking about\nit's not thinking about the game it's\nthinking about this other person and the\nmore that I think about my teammates\nwhat does that do to my enjoyment of the\ngame it drops like a [ __ ] lodestone\nthe more that I just played the game if\nI'm playing the game I'm like let's see\nwhat we can do like like if I'm focused\non the game I'm just playing the game\nbut if I start thinking about my\nteammates then my enjoyment of the game\nstopped goes down right and I can kind\nof like fluctuate like my mind is like\noh this guy's are [ __ ] this guy's an\nidiot like this guy's doing this this\nguy's doing that and then my enjoyment\nof the game goes down and then when I\nstart thinking about like if I just play\nthe game like so I know you guys have\ndone this because everyone has done this\nright where you play the game and then\nyou have someone on your team who's bad\nbut you don't really think about that\nyou're like okay this guy's gonna show\nup and he's gonna die\nbut like I'm gonna still like I'm just\ngonna play the game and we can still win\nand the more that you focus on the game\nand like they're people that die and\nwhether you're playing overwatch or dota\nthey're their noobs that are dying like\nall the time\nin any game they're gonna be noobs that\nare dying so why is it that one game you\nrage in one game you don't it's because\nin one game your concentration or your\nfocus remains on the game and on the\nother one your your concentration\ndissipates and it starts to think about\nother people so as long as you focus\nyour attention on one thing and just\nplay the game then your performance\nimproves your enjoyment improves\nand it's just an overall better\nexperience and people know that right so\nlike when you mute your allies what is\nthat doing for your mind\nit is literally helping your mind retain\nfocus on the game and if you mute your\nallies you are gonna have a better game\nand like so this is what I'm trying to\ntell you guys is that the mind works in\nthis way like if I'm let's say like I'm\nhaving a great meal that I really enjoy\nlike let's say I go to a sports bar and\nI'm having some wings and I'm watching\nlike UT football and then like someone\ncomes in and starts playing the bagpipes\nlike that's not gonna be a fun\nexperience for if I can mute the bad\nbagpipes I'm gonna like go back to like\nenjoying the game but the more that your\nmind is focused not only do you perform\nbetter you understand things better it's\nmore enjoyable it's more relaxed right\nlike that's how the mind works\nso gaming creates an artificial sense of\nfocus it's not artificial I mean it\ncreates a focus mind that's why it's fun\nwhat I mean by artificial is it doesn't\nit doesn't it's not because our training\nour mind to do that it automatically\ndoes that for us and generally speaking\nwhen we talk about things being\nenjoyable those are things that\nartificially cause our mind to focus on\nsomething so even delicious food versus\nlike less delicious food the delicious\nfood is gonna cause our mind to be\nfocused on it's like wow like that\nflavor oh my god there's like Meyer\nlemon in there and a hint of pepper and\nyou can really taste that that rendered\nbacon fat like it's crisp it's delicious\nit's fresh it's got a hint of heat like\nyou know that's enjoyment it's\nunderstanding enjoyment relaxation they\nall come together thank you guys for the\nsub subs okay so let\njust that's that's my schpeel okay so\nI'm gonna summarize so at the end of the\nday the first thing that we're gonna\nlearn is Dharma pattern a is the\nSanskrit word for focus it spelled eh-eh\nare a na da Derna okay\nwhat is dodged I don't know what that\nmeans"
