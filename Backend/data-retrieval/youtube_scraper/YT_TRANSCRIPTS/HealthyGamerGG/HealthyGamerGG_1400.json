    "transcript": "and you're gonna understand that you\nwere put on this earth for a reason and\nit wasn't a play [ __ ] World of\nWarcraft\nthat's just a shame\nokay so can you tell me what should I\ncall you for small I'm surprised that\nyou actually pronounce my username\ncorrectly the first time because a lot\nof people struggle with it\nbut you can call me John or Charo\nwhichever I prefer Joro I feel like I\nknow a lot of John's but I don't know a\nwhole lot of gyros and you seem like a\nJoro to me oh yeah\nso tell me a little bit Joro so tell me\na little bit about what we're gonna be\ntalking about today and how we can be\nhelpful to you oh I had nose\n[Music]\nI guess\nyou\ntrying to turn from\n[Music]\nthe\nmaybe to like more useful like turn\ngaming an aimless browsing to something\nelse because all my interests are\nbasically on the computer anyway ok\nand because I have other things\navailable I have my exercise bike right\nthere and like all kinds of things are\nlike\nwithin 100 meter radius so like what's\nin a hundred meter radius\nwe got a really really nice like\noutdoors running like track that goes\nthrough like two kilometer radius in the\nwoods\nokay oh we got like us would be called\nlike not an outdoor swimming pool but\nlike a indoor one okay\nwho's we there's light\nwell\nmy family okay like where I live so you\nlive with family who lives with you at\nhome\nmy parents okay\nand okay so you have a lot of stuff\navailable to you but you don't seem to\ntake advantage of it yes and what I'm\nhearing from you is that you'd like to\nunderstand why that is and maybe start\nchanging that yeah okay let's go with\nthat okay you say let's go with that is\nthat what you were actually looking for\nor is there something else\nyes yes to the first part okay\nanything else\nmmm\nthat's a-ok\nso tell me what-what would you like to\ndo\nlike how like concretely or like current\nmoment or like what do I want to be in\nthe future let's do all three oh boy\nwell I always wanted to be good at\nsomething absolutely I also want to feel\nfulfilled which I haven't had in a long\ntime\nokay or fell flat in a long time I've\nwanted to get into better shape okay\nthat's why I got the exercise bike\nand\nI want the career in something related\nto electronics less computers but okay\nthat's that's it I guess that's it\nthat's funny man\nuh-uh that's it that's it's like it's a\nsmall thing yeah yeah so so what's\ngetting in the way of you are\naccomplishing all of those things\nme how that's a very zen answer what\ndoes that mean\nI mean\nyou\nme as in\nmy thoughts okay I guess what does that\nmean your thoughts\nwell for example today I\nit's a curtain that we needed to get\ngroceries\nI acknowledged this and I mean like that\nyes I could go well not I thought that I\ncould go that going there would be easy\nokay that I could do it\nit's in my possibilities in my\ncapabilities to do it\nbut I proceeded to just stay and just\nlike still on in\nI mean while I'm thinking like yeah it's\njust you on it and eventually like it\njust go away because I kind of gave up\non it okay so give me one moment so I'm\ngonna pull twitch chat real quick and\nI'm gonna ask you to draw up what I want\nto know is do you want to talk about do\nyou want to approach this from a\nneuroscience perspective a psychology\nperspective or a spiritual perspective\nbecause we can do all three and let's\nsee what twitch chat wants to\nyou\nwhat do you think Jorah what do you want\n[Music]\nthat had to pick Nero and psychology but\nokay I'm I'm fine with all okay so\nwhen was the last time you had a good\nday\nyou\nyou\na good day\nactually there was a\nthere's one day it was two weeks ago\nit was\nit's like everything I lined up like\nI didn't have to do like I was alone at\nhome my mom was a Dean of the town my\ndad was at work and\njust flowed and like okay there's like\nno there was no like\nstops in what I was going to do that day\nokay\nvery very important observation right so\nwhat you're saying is that you went from\nthe first productive thing to the second\nproductive thing to the third productive\nthing to the fourth yes if this okay yes\nI'm the same way so the question becomes\nwhich one of those things is the most\nimportant\nyou\nmmm\nyou\nwhat do you think do you understand my\nquestion I think\nI might have forgot what I said okay\nI think the\nkourin part would be just\nlike that there's no interruptions in it\nokay like excellent right\nso when is the most critical\ninterruption\nI know it's kind of a weird quite\nhardened huh pardon so like it sort of\nit read my mind question so I think like\nthe first thing that I want you to think\nof is when you wake up in the morning\nthat's the most important interruption\nright so you're kind of like the first\nthing that you do in the day is going to\nset the tone for the remainder of your\nday\nright so you're saying that like like\nonce you did one flick if you've done\nnothing and you try to do something\nthat's really hard yeah if you've done\nsomething is it easier or harder to do\nsomething else\neasier absolutely right so like if\nyou've done two things is it easy or\nhard to do the third thing\neasier most of their privacy at the time\nright so if we think about the fourth\nthing like at some point we're gonna hit\nsome kind of limit and we'll understand\nwhat that is we're like the ten thing\nmay be hard\nthe eleven thing may be really hard the\ntwelfth thing may be really hard but the\nsecond thing is easier than the first\none the third one is maybe about as easy\nas the second one does that make sense\nyes so let me get you what is the\ncritical thing\nthe first absolutely so I don't want you\nto think about your inability to do so\nwhen you look at your life you think\nabout okay like I am unable to do ten\nthings today I can't exercise on the\nbike I don't use the walking path we\ndidn't talk some about career things\nlike that that's you and so what happens\nat the end of the day like you feel bad\nabout yourself because you [ __ ] up ten\nthings there were a thousand things you\ndidn't do\nfirst thing you need to understand is\nthat you have one battle to win every\nday\nthat battle is the first one\nso like if we look at strategically the\ndays that you've done a good job like\nwhat was it it's just somehow you\nmagically so we're gonna forget about\ntwo three four five six seven eight nine\nand two something magical happened that\nallowed you to do the first thing and\nthe cool thing is like once you do the\nfirst thing it becomes easier to do\nnumber two three and four so what we're\ngonna try to figure out is how can we\nstructure your life so that like doing\nstuff is easy for you instead of doing\nstuff as hard for you\ndoes that make sense yeah what I want to\nstart to get into now is like what is\nthe difference we're gonna define a\ncouple of terms okay okay what is\nmotivation\n[Music]\n[Music]\nhow are we going to define motivation\nand twitchchat can help I mean for me it\nkind of blends in together with\nwillpower some wife okay let's talk\nabout that so blends together so define\nmotivation for me\nokay so feral cat is saying what keeps\nyou doing tasks even if you don't want\nto but need to\nI'd say like the mmm like the source of\nenergy that you used to push through\nthings okay so let me ask you something\nif I need to use the restroom and I go\nand use the restroom would you say that\nthat is motivation\nwould you say I'm motivated to use the\nrest yes yes okay if I need to use the\nrestroom and I don't use the restroom\nwhat would you call that\nhe do you see okay that's good but in\nterms of language like so the first\nthing that I want people to understand\nis like motivation is what we're\nnaturally inclined to do right like\nthat's that's what it means\nmotivation is an internal drive that is\npushing us in a particular direction\nlike like if I want to if I'm hungry and\nI have a choice between a hamburger and\na salad like what am i motivated towards\neating\nlike what do you think\nI guess the hamburger probably right so\nI want you guys to understand that like\nmotivation is like when you did numbers\ntwo three four and five\nyou felt motivated to do them that day\nright\nyou didn't actually have to try very\nhard to do numbers two three four and\nfive you felt like doing it yeah so\nmotivation comes from within and\nwillpower is actually the exact opposite\nwhat is willpower\nyou\nyou\nconscious effort conscious effort yes to\ndo what\nthey do the thing you weren't motivated\nto do absolutely\nright\nso now we've been a couple of different\noptions we can increase your willpower\nor we can cultivate your motivation\nthose are two different things do you\nunderstand that jor oh yeah oh yeah\nwhat are you thinking you look like\nyou're thinking a lot\nyeah\nI'm thinking which one is more\nbeneficial yeah so we'll get to that\nright which one do you think is more\nbeneficial\nI mean we\nwith the motivation part if I have if I\nget that first step then in that case it\nwould be\nbetter but with willpower it would be\neasier to get to the first step\nsometimes yeah absolutely so we're gonna\ntalk about both of those now we're gonna\ntalk about a couple of other things\nwhat is discipline\nso cruel yes okay so that's very good\nself-rule implies that there is a part\nof you that so self rule implies that\nyou are not one thing right your mind is\nactually a couple of different things\nthat are fighting against each other so\nthe way that we're gonna try to help you\nout is by understanding what those\ndifferent things are and what are the\nways that you can like end up creating\naction so one way is motivation one ways\nwillpower\nso a lot of gamers feel like they're not\nmotivated do you feel like you're not\nmotivated\nyou\nwhen the first thing that came to mind\nis yes God\nwhat's the second thing that came to\nmind my friend\nyou\nkind of\nso it's like first first thing I thought\nwas yes but then it started to like okay\nam i so let's think about this for a\nsecond when you when you had this\nthought that like you need to get\ngroceries from the grocery store you\ncall that a lack of motivation right\nwhat do you do instead\nthey at home yeah and do what be\nspecific\nthey under computer yeah and do what on\nthe computer play a video game watch\nYouTube what is it\ncut\noh okay so the first thing I want you\nunderstand is that like what is that\nwhat is it that keeps you at the\ncomputer\nkeeps me yeah is it motivation is it\ndiscipline is it willpower\nis it laziness\nI think it's laziness what is yeah so\nwe're gonna redefine laziness right\nbecause all gamers think they're lazy\nyou're not lazy you're motivated to stay\nat the computer that's what I want you\nto understand you have a natural\ninternal Drive that is keeping you in\nyour computer chair right that's why we\nhave to start by defining things you\nhave a desire to sit in the computer\nchair you have a you're motivated to\nactually sit in the computer chair so\nthe first thing that people need to\nunderstand is that you don't lack\nmotivation your motivation is just in a\ndirection that you don't want it to go\ndoes that make sense and if we really\nthink about how stuck you are cuz you\nsound stuck to me like if I had to\ndiagnose you with its stuckness very\nmuch so if we think about like stuckness\nis actually hard to attain because\nthere's a certain like stubbornness it\nrequires a lot of energy to move you\naway from this place\nwhich tells me that there's a lot of\ngravity pulling you towards this place\ndoes that make sense let you have to\nthink about like the mind sort of\nmathematically and if I like so for\nexample I love my wife I'm motivated\ntowards being in the marriage so it's\ngonna take a lot for me to like think\nabout divorcing her does that make sense\nyes like the harder it is to pull you\naway from something the more motivated\nyou are towards it so the first thing\nwe've got to understand is that like\nit's not that you're lazy it's actually\nthat some part of you is highly\nmotivated to stay where you are right\nnow and until we like understand and\nrealize what that is and how it works\nit's gonna be really hard to move\nforward you can use willpower and by the\nway I would define discipline is a\nconsistent use of willpower over time\ndoes that make sense yeah okay\nwhat's a habit\nyou\nuse of discipline nope actually the\nexact opposite so when something becomes\na habit\nmotivation discipline and willpower are\nall separate from habit so habit is\nsomething that you do automatically\nwithout being motivated without being\ndisciplined without using willpower it's\na habit right so like just as an example\nlike when I use the restroom I wipe\nmyself right that's like it's habitual\nwhen I brush my teeth I have a\nparticular pattern when I wake up in the\nmorning I brush my teeth before I go to\nbed I brush my teeth it's a habit it\ndoesn't require willpower for me to do\nor not much does that make sense\nso once we get to the place of habit\nthings are gonna become relatively easy\nbecause it's sort of like autopilot ok\nso now I'm gonna ask you what do you\nthink it is where do you think\nmotivation comes from\nwhere does motivation come from\num\nthrough the need of something okay\nthat's part of it so let me ask you this\nwhat do you need to have a job in\ncomputers right now\na job yeah but none necessarily why do\nyou need a job\nrather have a job and get-get disposable\nincome okay\neventually move up but okay so so hold\non let's let's let me understand you'd\nrather have a job but is does that mean\nyou need a job\nwell No\nokay yes hold on let's think about this\nfor a second do you need a job\nyou\nyes why\nyou\nwhat's going to change tomorrow if you\nhave a job\nyou\ndepending on the job I'm I\nhave a type of shirt routine so what's\nthe consequence tomorrow if you don't\nhave a job\na job yeah okay so that's like so we're\ngonna replace the word job with the word\nyacht you know what a yacht is yes okay\nI need a yacht do you agree or disagree\nyes\nI agree you I need a yacht I need a\nyacht the way that you need a job which\nmeans that I'd rather have a yacht than\nnot having yacht the consequence for me\nnot having a yacht tomorrow's that I\ndon't have a yacht\nright do you have a place to sleep\ntonight tomorrow if you don't have a job\nyeah do you have food to eat tomorrow if\nyou don't have a job\nyeah you have something to occupy your\ntime that you find mentally engaging if\nyou don't have a job\nyeah why do you need a job I'm confused\nto get a sense of fulfillment okay\nyeah so like is that something that's\ngonna happen tomorrow\nno okay necessarily when does\nfulfillment happen\nyou\nsometimes when I do things ok right so I\nwant you to understand what's going on\nin your brain Joro\nyour brain is way smarter than you are\nyour brain recognizes what you need\nright your brain says hey money we need\nsome food right now our blood sugar is\nlow why don't you go eat something hey\nbuddy we need a toilet right now we have\na bladder full of urine let's go take a\npiss your your brain is telling you hey\nbuddy we don't need a job because we\nhave everything that we need right here\nwhat do we need nothing you don't need a\njob and then what happens is like\nthere's a part of your brain that weighs\nhow important things are like so like\nyour brain is always like trying to\nweigh different things against it it's\nlike different options right like do I\nwanna so for example like this bottle of\nwater like I can be thirsty and the\nthirstier I get the more that I want to\ndrink the bottle of water if the bottle\nof water is outside of my room I'm gonna\nhave to be thirstier for me to walk\noutside and get my bottle does that make\nsense like a little balloon exactly\navailability right so like when we think\nabout behavior in motivation the\navailability of things the internal\ndrive towards things and the expected\nreward all factor into whether I do\nsomething or I don't do something yeah\nlike if I\nif if the if I walked outside and I\ndidn't know where to find water like I'm\nnot gonna go down the street and start\nknocking on random people's houses and\nask them for a glass of water why not\nbecause the expected reward is really\nlow right like it's stupid like there is\nno way there's no reason why I would\nwalk down the street and ask random\npeople for glasses of water because the\nexpected reward is like so hard to\nfathom does that make sense\nyeah yeah so what do you think the\nexpected reward of finding fulfillment\nis like how do you think your brain\ncomputes that\nyou\nnot sure absolutely either is your\n[ __ ] brain your brain doesn't know\nwhat the [ __ ] that means\nlike what is full like you don't even\nknow\nso how you're here you are yours kind of\ntelling yourself hey brain we need\nfulfillment in your brains like your\nbrain like figures a lot of stuff out\nfor you\nand your brain is like I don't know and\nthen so then you wake up and then this\nis the part of your mind that says hey\nbrain we need to do something today and\nthen your brain says why do we need to\ndo something well we need a job for\nindependence but he's like you don't\nneed independence like you've got\nindependence right here you can sleep\nwhen you want to you can eat when you\nwant to you can play games when you want\nto this is actually the perfect\nlifestyle and then you say no brain but\nwe need fulfillment and your brain says\nwhat is that and then you say I don't\nknow and the brain says well if you\ndon't know what it is then like why do\nwe need it like why would you want\nfulfillment when we can like play like\nwhat do you play\nrecently Wow okay so like why do you\nneed fulfillment when you can like do\nraids on Wow\nlike what like the brain understands in\nthe brain understands who allow is there\nlike this is Wow like this is fun we can\ndo this or we can go knocking on random\ndoors to find fulfillment because how do\nyou find fulfillment right so it's like\nit's like it's like where can I dig for\ngold and find gold like that's why brain\nis gonna be like that's a [ __ ] waste\nof our time finding fulfillment is a\n[ __ ] waste of our time\nokay mm-hmm so the first thing that I\nwant you to understand Joro is that the\nreason that you're not doing any of\nthese things is because you don't need\nto\nwhy do you want to be healthy what does\nthat mean\nto\n[Music]\nfeel better do you feel bad better about\nmyself I mean not all the time\nYeah right your brain is like you start\nfeeling bad and then you tell your brain\nyou're like hey brain we need to go\nexercise so that we can feel good about\nourselves our brain says you know what's\nbetter than walking back to like I'm at\nmy office right now and my brain says\nyou know what's better than walking -\nyou're off walking back to your house\nwhich is three miles away for a glass of\nwater is walking right outside or\ngrabbing this bottle because you can\nwalk three miles away for a glass of\nwater or you can drink the water in\nfront of you\nso you tell your brain I want to\nexercise and the brain says why should\nyou do all that effort to feel better\nwhen I can make you feel better you\nplaying Wow\nlike why do you want like you can just\nplay wow and like if you get that robe\ndagger that you want you're gonna feel\ngreat your brain is like that's true why\nI don't understand why you're trying to\nmake my life hard that's what your brain\nis saying\nright yeah what do you need\nwhat are you motivated towards what do\nyou need Jorah roll all right Matt all\nright right now I don't know yeah I'll\ntell you the answer is [ __ ] nothing\nyou don't need anything\nwhat do you need tonight\nI'm like kind of already age yeah so I\nsound like you're in Europe or something\nScandinavia I don't know where are you\nFinland okay so you already ate so like\nwhat are you going to do tomorrow\nyou\nwake up ma'am\nwake up eat\nto the dishes and income here yeah okay\nwhy do you do the dishes\nso try to okay now we're getting\nsomewhere right because for a moment I\ngot excited because I thought maybe if\nyou didn't do the dishes no one would\nand that's why we see why you do the\ndishes\nbut it sounds like someone does the\ndishes if you don't do them that's\nthat's correct right and that's why you\ntry to do the dishes you try because you\ntell your broom you're like hey brain\nlet's do these dishes and then your\nbrain says why the [ __ ] do you should we\ndo these dishes we don't do them someone\nelse is going to do them why are you\nmaking me walk five miles for a glass of\nwater when we don't have to we don't\nhave to do the dishes and the dishes\nwill do themselves\nyour brain is an incredibly efficient\norgan incredibly efficient you're trying\nto just it's like you're just like hey\nbrain like let's just let's do all of\nthese really difficult things that are\ncompletely useless and your brain is\nlike why the what are you talking about\nman\nI don't have to do dishes all I have to\ndo is go and play Wow like I don't\nunderstand why you're trying to like\nruin this lifestyle that I've built for\nyou you enjoy whitening we hang out so\nnow we're gonna come to earlier I asked\nyou like what what do you want right and\nyou said I want a career you want to\nexercise you want to move out one day\nthose are desires\nyou understand that so we're gonna talk\nfor a second about desires and I know\nyou guys were asking for psychology so\nwe'll get to that and I mean I'm sorry\nI'm doing spirituality in neuroscience\nbecause that's what I feel like doing\ntoday yeah but what is it desire where\ndoes it come from\nyou\nso like what's an example of a desire\none thing something absolutely so what's\nsomething that you want it's like I want\na young money right we're talking about\nyachts and twitch at once yachts - where\ndoes the desire of wanting a yacht come\nfrom where does that originate\nyou\nyou\nit's a thing of value yes it is a thing\nof value where does the desire for a\nyacht originate when did I first desire\nto have a yacht\nit's kind of a weird question yeah it's\nreally basic but it's really hard\nokay so we've got we've got an answer\nfrom lucky death which is this when I\nsaw someone have one so I'll give you\nguys the answer right so let's think\nabout it this way have you guys ever\nbeen walking down the street and you\nsmell something like the smell of like\nsomeone frying something or like the\nsmell of grilled meat and you're like\nman I want to eat that\nthat ever happened to you where you\nsmell something cooking and you're like\nthat's up yes sounds delicious I want to\neat that\nso where does that desire come from yeah\nlike cookies if you're baking cookies\nright where does that desire come from\nwhere does it originate ah driving past\nrestaurants okay so so like when you're\ndriving past a restaurant or you smell\nsomething where is that desire\noriginating from this is really\nimportant to understand\nhunger is incorrect\ndoesn't originate from hunger\nyou\nokay what do you think Jorah well if\nin hunger they need this in the form of\nme so yeah so hunger comes from within\nso we're gonna talk about hunger in a\nsecond right but a desire to satisfy\nyour hunger in a particular way is\nseparate from the feeling of hunger you\nwith me\nokay so where does where does my desire\noriginate from\nokay\nare you are you looking at to a chat\nlook have you open on my other\nokay look at it look at it scroll\nthrough it and then let me know what you\nthink sounds sounds good we're going to\nmake this a group session today\nyou\nright just the experience of having it\nokay that's one that's one place have I\never owned a yacht though\nNo ah right so it can't just be the\nexperience of having it so like this is\nthe thing like to twitch at you Joro I\nthink the biggest problem that people\nhave is they don't understand how this\n[ __ ] stuff works like what is the\ndifference between motivation desire\nwillpower discipline habit\nwhere do desires come from why do I want\nto do something one day and I don't want\nto do something the other way like you\nguys have to understand how this stuff\nworks and it works it's like it's like\nmath its scientific so you're absolutely\ncorrect that sometimes a desire comes\nfrom a memory that's one of the origins\nof desire right because if I've eaten a\nchocolate-chip cookie once I can\nremember what that tasted like and I can\nwant one again but in the case of a\nyacht I've never had a yacht but I still\nwant one when\nlet me put it this way you know there\nare there are people in like Papua New\nGuinea who are like tribes that have not\nlike interacted with civilization dead\nright like these Aboriginal people do\nthey want yachts\nmaybe no they don't because they don't\nknow what a [ __ ] yacht is\nokay okay so like\nwhen do they when can one day the\naboriginal person like what has to\nhappen for the aborigine to want to yah\nto know it exists and how does that\nhappen\nSusy absolutely right so now I'm gonna\ngo through twitch chat and I'm gonna\nshow you guys something okay so digital\ndude says when I saw other people had a\nyacht\nyes cookies how do we want cookies\nright\none person says outside sense of smell\nwanting something that you know you\ndon't have past memories\nokay you see it with your eyes\nso where do desires come from\nyou\nwhen was the first time that someone\nwanted a chocolate-chip cookie like I\nimagine like there's a five-year-old kid\nwhat has to happen for them to want a\nchocolate-chip cookie\nsure absolutely right or smell it\nor taste it like I have a two-year-old\nand she doesn't want things until I put\nthem in her mouth so like if I give her\na bite of chocolate of cookie she's like\noh that's delicious can I have more but\nshe doesn't want it until she has a\nsensory experience of it\nso the first didn't understand is that\ndesires come from the census the yogi\nsaid that the India's which are the\nsense organs are the origin of desire so\nyou cannot have a desire without a\nsensory experience or a memory of a\nsensory experience but the root of\ndesire comes from your senses so I think\nyou are and do desires so the other\nthing about desires is that they're not\npowerful motivators because desires like\navailability is like very very important\nfor desires to affect our motivation\nlike the simplest way to put it is like\nI will eat a freshly baked chocolate\nchip cookie every day\nwhy don't I eat freshly baked chocolate\nchip cookies every day Joro\ncuz you don't have them everyday right\nand there there are a lot of work to\nmake I will put a freshly baked\nchocolate chip cookie made from scratch\nin front of me every day I will probably\neat it but even though I want to eat the\nchocolate chip cookie it doesn't affect\nmy motivation enough to like bake them\nevery day\ndoes that make sense sir yeah so then\nthe question becomes if our desires are\nnot like a good source of motivation\nwhat is a good source of motivation like\nif I can't even motivate myself to do\nsomething enjoyable like eat like I'm\nnot even willing like even though a\nchocolate-chip cookie is good why do I\neven though it brings me pleasure why do\nI not like get up off my ass and do it\nlike it's a positive reward right you\nwith me but it's hard to do so let me\ngive you another example like what is\nwhat is the one of the most like give me\nsome examples of some of the most\nunpleasant stuff that you've done\nI've done or experienced that you've\ndone\nyou\nI mean does pain count like\nphysical like actual like something that\ngoing through or so so is there any pain\nthat you've undergone that you would do\nagain\nlike have you ever experienced yeah it\npain in your life that if you had to go\nback in time and you could choose to do\nit or not do it you would choose to do\nit again\nyes give me an example\nyou\nyou\nyou\nit's like on second thought maybe not\nokay\nis anything ever unpleasant happened to\nyou that if you could go back in time\nyou would choose to do that again\nyeah like what\nI got a spinal fluid like taken out look\nlike with a needle of course unpleasant\nyeah why would you do it again\nas it helped me get a\nokay why is that important\nbecause otherwise I wouldn't have known\nwhy is it important to know\nbecause it's not nice to know\nokay nice to not know yeah so I get that\nin in theory okay so let me put a let me\nput it to you this way so a couple weeks\nago my kid was sick and she threw up on\nme do you think that I like being thrown\nup on\ndo you think I regret her throwing up on\nme\nit's kind of a weird question right\nmaybe yeah so like I didn't want it to\nhappen but if I had to do it again I\nwould absolutely let let her throw up on\nme again right like I was holding her I\nwas rocking her to sleep and she threw\nup on me so if I had to go back in time\nI would choose it again\nwhy\nyou\nI mean what would be the other option\nyeah so so okay yeah so touch 20:21 part\nit looks like I lost you guys so like\nsometimes in life we do unpleasant\nthings right we do things that like so\nif we think about a cookie the reward\nfrom that cookie is like a positive\nthing like it's a pleasant thing yeah\nand even though the outcome is positive\nwe still can't find the motivation to do\nit what I'm trying to suggest is that\nsometimes we do things that are actually\nlike negative rewards and we're able to\nfind the energy or motivation to do it\ndo you have siblings Europe yes - how\nold are they uh two and four years older\nthan me okay so let me ask you this if I\npointed a gun at you Jorah what would\nyou do run absolutely if I pointed a gun\nat your sibling what would you do\nproblem\nlike try to help them out of this\nsituation\nwhy what's different a gun is a gun why\ndon't you run away\nbecause an important\nthing is on the line absolutely\nabsolutely right\nso now we get to the crux of it which is\nwhat matters to you Jorah\nyou\nyou\nmy life\nokay\nI think that makes sense what else\nmatters to you\nclose relationships okay are any of\nthose in jeopardy\nyou\nno so Joro you're a pretty thoughtful\nguy so I think you think a lot before\nyou answer which is fantastic at the\nsame time I think the basic problem that\nyou have is that everything that met\nlike there's nothing that matters to you\nthat coincides with what you want like\nso you want to move out of the house you\nwant to get a good job but you don't you\nknow it doesn't matter to you like\nyou're not willing to put yourself in\nthe path of a gun\nfor any of those things\ndoes that make sense good\nso like the problem here is that like\nyou're willing to it's hard enough to to\nbake cookies just to eat a cookie even\nthough that's a positive reward but real\nstrength comes not from desires but from\nvalues desires come from our indriyas or\nour sense organs they come from the\noutside values like if we think about\nlike why you would try to help out your\nsiblings if a gun was pointed at them\nthat has nothing to do with the census\nin your relationship with your your\nsiblings is not like it's not like one\nday you saw them like you see them and\nthen you kind of like know who they are\nbut your your relationship with them is\nnot like based on an isolated sensory\nexperience in fact like if you think\nabout love love is not like it doesn't\ncome from the inner ears it doesn't come\nfrom the sense organs\nwhere d where does love come from\nyou\nlike mathematically\nyou\nwhere do you feel love\nyou\nyou\nmy brain okay yeah that's a scientific\nanswer the answer I'm looking for is\nlike within right there's some feeling\nright yeah yeah it's like like so if we\nthink about the indriyas the indriyas or\nthe way in which the outside world\nenters us and those are not a good\nthat's where desires come from they come\nfrom the outside world but values come\nfrom within and values are what can\novercome all of the negative stuff like\nI would walk and knock on every door in\nmy neighborhood if my daughter was\nthirsty and I had no water\nI would do that in a heartbeat\nright if I if I ran out of water and she\nlike hadn't had anything to drink for 24\nhours then I would go and do that so I\nthink your basic problem Joro is that\nyou don't have anything to care about\nyou don't care about it you want stuff\nbut you don't care\nit doesn't mean anything to you\nbecause your needs are met\nwhat are you feeling right now\nyou\na chair\nI can't tell because of your glasses but\nare you tearing up\nmaybe\nslightly\nso what are you feeling tell me what you\nfeel in your body it started when I said\nyou don't care about anything\nyou\nI don't know if it's\n[Music]\nit's guilt or shame yeah\nwhat are you ashamed of\nyou\nlook at me Jorah\nwhat are you shamed up\nyou\nkind of myself yeah\nyou know what what if I had to guess\nwhat was in your mind right now the best\nword I can think of is everything\neverything\nhow did you get to be this way\nyou\nwhen did this happen to you\nyou\nhow long have you felt this way\nyou\nbecause for a while yeah\nit's been so long since like I would\neven guess that you don't even really\nremember what it feels like to not feel\nlike this it's been so long and you've\nbeen stuck for a really long time and\nyou don't know how to get out\nyou\nwe're gonna help you twitch ad and I are\ngonna help you do you believe you can be\nhelped\nreally\nso some time ago you said it's been a\nlong time since I felt like I had\npurpose in my life\nwhen was the last time you remember\nhaving purpose in your life\nyou\nkantham remember okay\nso you have a lot of work\nto do Jorah\nright\nyeah and it's got to start with\nreflection it's got to start with\nunderstanding yourself it's got to\nunderstand with what the [ __ ] do you\nwant to do with your life\nright the basic problem here is that you\nhave no reason to get on the exercise\nbike\nyou have no reason to go out and walk\nyou have no reason to go get groceries\nso you really need to spend some time\nthinking about like what do you want\nlike what what do you want to be like\nwhy why get a job\nyou\nso jor-el I think your most basic\nproblem is I asked you what do you care\nwhat matters to you in life do you\nremember what your answer was\nit was I guess myself and that's the\nproblem\nright so this is the one thing that I\njust love about gamers is you [ __ ]\nguys will do anything for anyone else\nif someone asks you for help like I am\nlike 99% sure Giroud that if I was in\nFinland and I was stranded and I sent\nyou a text message and I said hey jor-el\ncan you come help me out you would drop\nwhatever you were doing and come and\nhelp me\nthere is no doubt in my mind that you\nwould do that I can tell I can tell just\nby looking at you\nand I think the basic problem here is\nthat like you feel shame and guilt for\nyourself and you feel like you don't\nhave you're not worth a whole lot\nbecause you haven't done a whole lot so\nyou're not worth helping\nbut somehow we have to connect to that\npart of you that is like good and like\nhelps people like you know get their\ngear and Wow\nright\nbecause like I think you're a good\nperson and Wow like\nlet's you be a good person and the\nproblem that I see is that like I don't\nsee an opportunity in your life for you\nto be a good person\nso it's got to start there\nyou've got to stop living for yourself\nand start living for something else for\nsomeone that you love or people who need\nyour help\nyou\nright so I ate a [ __ ] salad for lunch\nI don't like salads\nbut I'm getting old and I have kids and\nI have to be around like I want to watch\nthem graduate like I'm not gonna eat a\nsalad I'm gonna eat a [ __ ] quesadilla\nbut Mike because of my kids I'm gonna\neat a salad so you're talking about\nmotivation we're talking about willpower\ntalking about discipline we're talking\nabout desire what we're not talking\nabout is Dharma Dharma is the son script\nword for duty or responsibility and you\ncan we can spend as much time as we want\nto helping you psychologically by\ntalking about your shame and stuff like\nthat and we can do that if you guys want\nbut I think the basic problem here is\nthat you don't have a reason to get on\nthe exercise bike\nso this is what I want you to imagine I\ndon't know if this is gonna work or not\nbecause I don't know you that well but\njor-el I want you to understand that\nlike you're an individual and that in\nyour life they're going to be people\nthat you meet and that someday like the\npeople that you meet are gonna need your\nhelp you don't know who it's gonna be\nyou don't know when it's gonna be\nthat there are people out there that in\nthe grand scheme of time are completely\nirrelevant but that one day you're gonna\nbe walking down the street and someone\nis about to step in front of a car and\nyou're gonna like pull them back onto\nthe sidewalk so they don't get hit this\nkind of random [ __ ] is gonna happen\nsomeone's gonna be hungry someone's\ngonna lose their car keys someone's\ngonna need to use your phone that the\nworld exists in is full of humans and\nyou need to help them because if you\ndon't pull that person off off the\nstreet they're gonna get hit by a car\nand the problem is that like you need to\nprepare yourself for those moments\nyou don't know what kind of help you\nneed to provide you don't know when it's\ngonna be or who it's gonna be but you\nhave to prepare yourself as I do believe\nthat there are some people in this world\nonly you can help\nso that make sense so how are you gonna\nprepare\nyou\nI'll tell you\nso you're going to wake up tomorrow\nmorning\nyou're gonna go for a walk\nthat's how it starts\nthe first thing you do take a piss brush\nyour teeth before you eat anything go\nfor a walk\nif you eat first thing in the morning\ngrab something and then take it with you\neat outside how cold is it is it really\ncold\nokay okay I like cold you're gonna start\nby doing that\nyou going to do that tomorrow\nokay the other thing that I want you to\ndo is message me on discord\nafter you do it tell me before you leave\nand when you get back I may be offline\nbut message me anyway and what I'm gonna\ndo on Sunday I'm gonna stream again on\nSunday and I'm either going to praise or\nshame you in front of the Internet\nI'm gonna say Joro I got a message from\nJoro he went for his [ __ ] walk\nand then you're gonna do the next thing\nand you're gonna understand that you\nwere put on this earth for a reason and\nit wasn't a play [ __ ] World of\nWarcraft that's just a shame\nthe problem here is that you don't\nrealize like the biggest problem here\nJoro is that you think you're worthless\nlike there's no point in doing anything\nif you're worthless but if you actually\nhave the capacity to help people and\nmake a difference like you've got to\nyou know like you can't stop a gun if\nyou're made of paper like there's no\npoint but you have flesh and blood and\nbone which means that you can step in\nfront of a gun and you can like save\nyour your siblings you can do that if\nyou're made of paper it doesn't [ __ ]\nmatter right now the problem is you\nthink you're made of paper you don't\nthink you can make a difference that's\nyour problem\nsecond problem is you don't know what\nyou want we talked about desires but\nlike you don't know what you care about\nlike what do you care about\nright so this is like we have this\nexercise in discord which i think is\nbrilliant I don't know if you guys have\nread this stuff but like can I just read\nthis for a second I want to read some of\nthe stuff to you guys this stuff is\ngreat\noh you posted beautiful\nJerome Oni this is you yeah okay now\nwe're talking okay you ready\njor oh yeah okay we're gonna talk about\nthis oh ma what is wrong with the world\nso good job Joro dude this is [ __ ]\nfantastic there's an increased amount of\nmisinformation in the modern world which\ncauses people to make misinformed\ndecisions and have long lasting effects\non themselves and sometimes many others\nrelated to this misinformation as\npeople's lack of purpose being drawn\ninto bubbles of comfort and believing in\nconspiracy theories without thinking\nabout them sound like anyone you know\nJoro bubbles of comfort and lacking\npurpose\nthat sound familiar buddy yeah people\nfight over each other's political views\nand religious beliefs which is in my\nopinion not a fight worth having society\nis not caught up with the technology of\nor social climate copyright Roz's\nscrewing companies and artists over the\nsecurity and the privacy of civilians\nhas worsened in the online age even\nthough there are very simple fixes to\nmany of the problems only to be declined\nby incompetence or greed\nthe way media portrays so many things\nviolence sexuality body economy\ntechnology incorrectly is harmful to\nyounger adults and even children\ncompanies use every way they can to get\ninto a consumers pocket oftentimes even\ntaking immoral or illegal means as well\npublic health care is a joke in many\ncountries with long queue times and\ninsane costs causing even more people to\navoid professional health care entirely\nmental health isn't taking serious isn't\ntaken seriously do you take your mental\nhealth seriously\nyeah I've been in therapy for six years\nokay not sleeping is seen as bragging\nrights\nI stayed up all night playing Wow\nhumanity is not taking enough action to\nprevent or slow down climate change in\nglobal warming in some even deciding to\ndeny it and not believe the overwhelming\nevidence that is presented to them comes\nback to misinformation right the ocean\nis filled with plastic not literally so\nmany species have already gone extinct\nthanks to pollution and bad recycling\nthere's still Wars being fought people\nare still forced to leave their home\ncountries due to conflict or corrupt\ngovernments threatening their well-being\nlives and often leaving many people to\ntheir own devices and a possible\neventual death okay Joro so now comes\nthe last question what are you gonna do\nabout it\nthis when I read this that when I read\nthis I think that the world there's so\nmany problems that are so big that it\ncan't be fixed and you know why these\nproblems seem so big\nbecause people like you are [ __ ]\nsitting at home playing wow it's not a\njoke\nI mean I meant it to be funny and also\nharsh right now so I think that there's\nsomething my sense is that this is this\nis like there's something here that you\ncan actually do I don't know if you can\nbring extinct species back to life I\ndon't know if you can fix healthcare\nthat sounds like a very different\ntrajectory but I do think there's\nsomething about misinformation and\nmisinformed decisions that you can over\nthe course of the next year actually do\nwhat do you think\nyou\nyeah yeah right and if you don't do it\nwho's going to do it\nyou\nyou leave it up to [ __ ] twitch at the\nchat is gonna do it can we count on baby\nmaybe I mean it's either either somebody\nelse or most likely nobody yeah\nright so Mahatma Gandhi said be the\nchange that you want to see in the world\nlike people quote that [ __ ] all the time\nbut I think like that's like a very\npositive way of saying if you don't do\nit no one will\nlike I got into this because I saw that\nthere are a lot of mental health there\ngamers are struggling with their mental\nhealth people don't know what what to do\nright so like I woke up one day and I\nsaid I'm gonna start talking to gamers\nover the Internet and my lawyer said you\ncould get sued\nbecause someone is gonna think that this\nis therapy and you don't have a\ndoctor-patient relationship and one day\nsomeone is going to kill themselves and\ntheir family's going to see you because\nyou were pretending to be a doctor they\nsaid that this would be easier if you\nactually weren't a medical professional\nbecause you have a license and you have\nobligations but if I don't do it who is\nyou\nright\nlike it's Friday on November 15th 423 in\nin Eastern Time\nand like you're stuck\nif I don't talk to you right now Joro\nwho's going to talk to you\nlike it's me that's it right when I said\none day you're gonna walk down the\nstreet and someone is about to step in\nfront of a car and if you're not there\nto save them no one else will be you're\nthat person for me I'm walking down the\nstreet and I see you and I see you\nstepping in front of a car and if I\ndon't help you no one else will and it's\nFriday at 4 p.m. I'm not working I'm not\nwith my kids right now they're getting\nhome from school I want to be with them\nI want to play with them for a couple of\nhours you know why I want to play with\nthem for a couple of hours so that four\nhours from now when I want to play dota\nI can do so with a clean conscience so\nthat I can say to myself I spent time\nwith my kids I'm a good father so now I\ndeserve to relax because the thing that\ntears me up more than anything is when I\nwant to play dota more than I want to\nhang out with them and it would have\nbeen easy cuz I could have played dota\nif I was like you know if I was with\nthem does that make sense\nbut instead I'm talking to you\nand that's worth it because if I don't\ndo it who will and this is the thing\nlike Jorah like the world is not gonna\nfix itself just like you said it's a\nbleak [ __ ] place man\nand there's misinformation and like but\nthat's that's like a so buddy of mine\nthis is kind of random but you know\nthere's like a lot of like if anyone's\nin the u.s. I don't know if you guys\nlike have been to the dentist but like\ndentists make a lot of money and there's\nlike no price transparency in dentistry\nthis is gonna be kind of completely\nrandom and so he decided that what he\nwas gonna do is like try to compare\ndental prices so that people could like\nunderstand what they're getting billed\nfor and understand what a dentist costs\ndo he ended up getting sued and shut\ndown because dentists didn't like that\nthey didn't like it that someone was\npublishing how much they charge but he\nwas saying that people are just getting\n[ __ ] ripped off\nand he just started a website because\nyou can do that now you can do that yeah\nand so Jorah what I want you to really\ndo so I want you to start tomorrow by\ntaking a walk and then I want you to\nthink about like concretely like there's\na problem of misinformation and try to\nbreak it down to the smallest thing you\ncan like what is this\nlike what what about misinformation\nwe're gonna talk about it now for five\nminutes like what can you do about\nmisinformation like what's the tiny\nthing what's what's the misinformation\nthat bothers you the most\nyou\nyou\nclimate he\nclimate climate misinformation\nyeah okay\nso what are you gonna okay so like\nare there websites out there like so\nwhat do you how do you think we address\nthat\nthat's a tough one\ninforming okay okay this is what I want\nyou to do Jorah I think the other\nproblem here is that part of your\nmotivation is because you don't have\nyour environment or environment isn't\ngood I don't know who you spend your\ntime with so this is what I'd like you\nto do after you go for a walk I want you\nto look up organizations that are that\nare fighting or advocating for climate\nchange like do a Google search and then\ntry to find like a dozen organizations\nand see if any of them have do you have\nany like programming skills or web\ndeveloping skills\noh yeah okay so what I want you to do is\nis look at those organizations and reach\nout like find which ones you like okay\nand let me know if what I'm asking you\nis getting too difficult because I'm\ngonna ask you for more and more okay so\nlike let me know when I hit the limit do\nand I want you to reach out to them and\nsay hey I have this concrete skill set\ndo you guys have any needs in this area\ndo you have a resume\nuh yeah okay so update your resume make\nit look good and then reach out to these\norganizations and say hey do you guys\nhave any needs in in these skill set you\ncan contact HR or things like that\nand then if you're lucky they'll pay you\nbut even if they don't make the world a\nbetter place don't tell them you'll work\nfor free by the way\nyeah see if they have any needed onward\nyeah what do you think about that\nsounds like a plan okay and what's\ngetting what's gonna [ __ ] over your plan\nit's a very simple thing\ninterruptions and hope yeah\nwhich interruption is the most important\nto start

mind\nbecause I always tried to take actions\nin the future and one day I woke up and\nI realized you can't take actions in the\nfuture it's impossible the only time\naction can be taken is in the
