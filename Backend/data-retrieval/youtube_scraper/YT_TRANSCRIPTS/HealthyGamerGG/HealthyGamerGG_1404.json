    "transcript": "hi I was wondering your thoughts on\nquitting gaming cold turkey and how to\nmaintain that and if you agree with it\nokay so this is a great question\nso I think that so the first thing is\nwhen people think about video game\naddiction we pull a lot of stuff about\nhow to deal with video game addiction\nfrom other addictions so most of our the\ncommon wisdom on addictions comes from\nthis thing called substance use\ndisorders so this is like alcohol and\nheroin and like cocaine and things like\nthat and we think about those as\naddictions and we think about the way to\novercome an addiction that playbook was\nwritten for substance use disorders it\nwas written for like alcoholism and so\nnow we have a whole new swath of like\nnew addictions social media addiction\nNetflix addiction video game addiction\nsocial media addiction right like and as\nwe have these new addictions we want to\napply like the old pattern to the new\npattern and in my opinion substance use\ndisorders and behavioral addictions are\nfundamentally different with the way\nthat they affect the brain doesn't mean\nthat the solutions for substance use\ndisorders can't help it's just like a\nnew disease and so a new disease in my\nopinion requires a new solution so I\nthink that quitting cold turkey on games\ncan be helpful for some people that\nworks really well I think it's very a\nvery good idea to go on a gaming cleanse\nwe just sort of stay away from games for\na couple of weeks so that your dopamine\ncircuitry can like recalibrate and\nnormalize so that you can start to enjoy\nother things but I don't think that\nthat's the only way which is something\nthat I see a lot like I know that there\nare a lot of like people out there and\nlike treatment programs and stuff that\nbelieve that abstinence is the only way\nbecause that's how it works for like\nalcohol but I don't think so I mean in\nmy case I definitely had a gaming\naddiction I still play video games now\nand I'm like not an addict I think the\nnumber of people who have overcome video\ngames game addictions and can healthily\nplay video games far outweighs the\nnumber of people who are addicted to\nalcohol and can continue to drink in a\nhealthy way\nso I don't think you have to quit\nforever\nand the last question all answer is like\nthey say at lask how do you maintain it\nso I think this is kind of what I was\ntelling Skye is that you know you can't\nmaintain it all you can do is what like\nnot play games on that day so when I'm\ntalking to my patients who have\naddictions you know they say like I have\na goal to be sober for one year it is\nimpossible to be sober for one year\nimpossible you can achieve one year of\nsobriety but you can't be sober for a\nyear and what happens is people wake up\nand they say like this time I'm\ndedicated I'm gonna be sober for a year\nthey feel passionate they feel committed\nthey make a commitment to themself I'm\ngonna do it for one year that's my\ncommitment I'm gonna lose 20 pounds I'm\ngonna lose 50 pounds I'm I'm I'm\ncommitted this time this time is\ndifferent\nI've made up my mind I didn't make up my\nmind before but I made up my mind\nthis time I'm gonna maintain it I'm\ngonna stick with it this is what's gonna\nhappen not how it works you can't\nmaintain it you can't be sober for a\nyear all you can do is be sober for a\nday and if you do that for 365 days in a\nrow you will be sober for a year but to\nunderstand that you can't maintain\nabstinence from video games you can just\nnot play them on that day so practically\nwhat I think works way better and what I\ndo in my clinical practice rather than\nattaining abstinence because there's\nsomething you guys have to understand\nvideo games do something for us\nokay they do something very important\nfor us and you can't just take that away\nso I was working with a kid who was\nautistic and gets bullied at school and\nthen his parents are like yeah he plays\nlike way too many video games we want to\ntake it away and then like they didn't\nrealize that like the kids like his only\nfriends are on the Internet so you can't\njust like stop playing it like if you\nstop playing it he's gonna feel [ __ ]\nalone in suicidal so you have to think\nabout what is the game doing for me like\nwhat do I get out of the game and if you\nwanna if you want to be free from video\ngames if you want to just play them and\nnot be\naddicted to them if you want to be able\nto play them have fun and not be\naddicted you have to get the stuff that\nthe video game gives you in other parts\nof your life like people talk about like\nthis person is like I want to quit\ngaming and I want to stay away from\ngaming you don't have to quit gaming you\njust need to build a life that pulls you\naway from the game that's the solution\nthat I believe in\nthat's what healthy gamer is all about\nit's not like conquering video game\naddiction it's like becoming a healthy\ngamer you don't like start to have a job\nthat challenges you intellectually start\nto like have people that you want to see\nlike get into shape so that you're not\nembarrassed about like leaving your room\nthe only place that you get confidence\nis because you're like a top tier like\nraid leader and Wow or you're like\ndivine bracket or like diamond and wall\nor whatever that's where you get your\nconfidence from that's the problem you\ncan't just take that away you're just\ngonna be left with a bunch of no\nconfidence like you've taken the one\nthing that supports your ego and gives\nyou community you just taking it away\nwhat I want you to do is be free from\ngames be free from them don't need them\nanymore\nbuild a life that's worth living like if\nRL doesn't suck you don't have to like\nhave you guys seen outside RPG this is\ngreat so there's like this subreddit\ncalled like slash are outside it's it's\nbeautiful they treat the real world like\nit's an RPG and and like what I want you\nguys to recognize is like you can build\nyour life to be worth living that's what\nyou should focus on and if you have\nfriends and if you feel engaged and if\nyou feel challenged and if you feel\nconfident in yourself and if you have\npeople who love you and respect you for\nwho you are in the real world you don't\nneed a video game you can still enjoy it\nI still like playing video games but to\nbuild a fulfilling life that's the goal\nand if you do that then then then gaming\nlike conquering gaming addiction is not\na struggle like that's what you guys\nreally have to understand is that what\nthis person is saying is that thoughts\non quitting gaming cold turkey and how\nto maintain it right that means that\nthat is a daily struggle that that\nperson is fighting\nusing willpower day after day after day\nafter day and at one point they're gonna\nhave a bad day and they're gonna crack\nthat's the problem the people who are\ntruly sober from alcohol give it up they\ndon't have to struggle every day they're\nlike you know what my life is actually\nbetter without it if I choose a life of\nsobriety or I choose a life like I'm\njust tired of being hungover every day\nthat [ __ ] sucks\nwhen they say things like that then they\ndon't want to go to the alcohol that's\nwhat I'm that's what I think you should\ndo"
