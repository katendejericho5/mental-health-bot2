    "transcript": "the instinctual solution would be what\nyou have to do is find meaning in life\nright like that's the standard answer\nlike if you're unhappy and your life has\nno meaning\ngo and find meaning like we have this\ndiscord thing that you can join to where\npeople talk about what's wrong with the\nworld\nI think that's useful but what I want\neveryone to understand is that in in\nKevin's case it's not just finding\nmeaning it's finding when meaning went\naway because when you are nine or 10\nlike life hopefully has meaning like\nit's just it's simple meaning but its\nmeaning\non you buddy yeah we're gonna do\nmeditation don't worry promise you guys\nmeditation we're going to do it but I\nfeel like we have to do this real quick\nhey cannabis yeah can you yeah I don't\nhave a webcam and I'm from Denmark so\nhope the that's the accent is all right\ncool no problem\ncan you guys hear lupus\nokay so lupus use you made a statement\nearlier about you feel like you're\nsuffering is because you have a lot of\nexpectations I would think so like yes\nwhat do you mean by that I think every\ntime I want to make a change or when I\nview my life it's it's really hot\nah it's hard to formulate that's what I\ntake your time\nso when I think of for example what what\nreally ignited how I feel right now is\nthe break-up I had with my girlfriend\nand I came to a realization that I had\nbuild up everything in my life around\nbeing with her and nothing about being\nwith me so the attachment to to every\nfar I had in the future was based really\naround being with her and not being with\nmy like with myself laughing yeah yeah\nso I think that's that's so I think this\nis gonna be a short call you're welcome\nto come back on later but I think that's\nthe crux of it right so here's the\nreason that you don't have a life worth\nliving is because you constructed this\ncastle of a life with her in your mind\nand so that was the life that was worth\nliving\nand it involved her like you built this\ncastle with her in mind and she was a\npart of every brick each of those bricks\nthat you placed with her in mind is one\nattachment this is where you were gonna\nlive this is what Monday's would be like\nthis is what Tuesday's would be like\nthis is when you would or wouldn't have\nkids or you guys were gonna talk about\nhaving kids\nyou're gonna visit family not visit\nfamily everything in life involves her\nthat's what I'm hearing from you yeah\nand the way that that I've thought about\nit is like how I feel now on my\neducation and on my everyday life is\nthat I I have no desire to complete my\nfinal education because if\nbe it the desire was to like go to work\nand then come home to her it wasn't to\ncontend with work yeah so do you guys\nsee this do you see how like the reason\nthat so this isn't necessarily\ndepression right this is an attachment\nto a fantasy and fulfillment of that\nfantasy was the driving force and lupus\nis life\nlike it was all to create this life and\nnow that the girlfriend is out of the\npicture the life comes crumbling down\nand all of your reasons for living and\nsuffering and trying suffering isn't the\nright word for like you know doing\nthings that are not fun we're based on\nthis ideal so now lupus how old are you\nwhat do I call you by the way okay you\ncan call me Kevin if it's better sure\nbut how I feel is that even without her\nI'm still sad like I don't know how it's\nreally hard to formulate yeah yeah so I\nthink you have so I think the tricky\nthing here is that you have sadness how\nlong ago did y'all break up it was a\none-way you go yeah we go okay\nbut the like the feeling of non\nfulfillment or the the feeling of of\nsadness and and that whole charade has\nhas been going on for years surroundings\na couple of traumatic events and I think\nthe I was I think that I was sad before\nI met her but she made the like the\nreasons to live better like I didn't\nreally have any reasons to do anything\nbefore meeting her and then when I met\nher like everything was based around\nthis whole fact and we've been together\nfor five years so so the state of being\nunhappy has been really long but she has\nshe the whole like so not suffering you\nyou distinguish Beth but but being sad\nworth it because I could go home to hers\nexactly so I want you guys I want\neveryone to and you to understand this\nKevin the sadness in hurt your\nrelationship with her are independent\nthings that's what I've been saying all\nalong and the problem is that your lack\nof fulfillment could be numbed because\nof the positivity of your relationship\nwith her\nyeah I hate them yeah so like us only\nnow it's only now that I realize this\nyes and so this is the big problem is\nthat everyone is gonna think that you're\nfeeling unfulfilled because you broke up\nwith her she broke up with you or\nwhatever but you have to understand that\nyour search for meaning predated her\nyeah and that the only way to fix that\nproblem is to find meaning like you can\nforget it\nyou can distract yourself with\ngirlfriends video games parties booze\nyou can distract yourself as much as you\nwant to but this is my whole point this\nis what would they realize is that\nsuffering is independent from all that\nother crap your search so you have kind\nof different things going on right so\nthere's sadness because you broke up\nwith someone that you've been with for\nfive years that's like absolutely like a\npsychosomatic thing there are just parts\nof your physiology that are gonna make\nyou feel sad yeah unfortunately you're\njust gonna have to feel that way for\nsome time there are a lot of things that\nyou can do that you know people kind of\nlike common wisdom will say like so\nspending time with nature is great it\nsounds like you're from Europe so it's\nprobably cold where you are yeah it's\nfreezing in Denmark yeah so if you're in\nDenmark so I don't know exactly what\nwhat people do there but you know I'd\nsay like you know listen to sad music\nspend time with nature spend time with\nanimals spend time with people that care\nabout you all those things are important\nand there are two other things to think\nabout\none is that some of your suffering is\ngoing to be because of the shattered\nexpectations from this relationship and\none of those shattered expectations this\nis a really important one is that as\nlong as she was in your life you didn't\nhave to figure out that other source of\ndeeper sadness that she was going to\ncure you of that other deeper sadness\nthat's the most dangerous expectation\nbut now you realize that she hasn't\ncured you of and that it's still there\nyeah it's all it's also a realization\nthat that that I've had myself thinking\nabout the whole breakup and stuff\nbecause I'm as you saying sad that we\nbroke up but now I have this other\nfeeling that have been gone for five\nyears and then predates all of this and\npredates all into my teens and and stuff\nlike that and and I think I had I can\nreally distinguish between those two\nelements and I know that I have to work\non the under ladder\nexactly right so that's so I think it's\nawesome that you recognized that these\nare two fundamentally different things\nand this is what like that hopefully\nI've Illustrated it enough and for all\nof you all of that are listening\nunderstand that like happiness and\nunhappiness and depression or like two\ndifferent things\nand this is the conversation that I have\nwith people is that we could treat your\ndepression we've sort of dealt with your\ndepression now you're unhappy there's a\ndifferent road for that but I have a\nquestion than the box\nmy sadness relating to my girlfriend I\nknow a sadness and and suffering to it\nto a certain degree but\ncan i still be depressed because yes\nalright because my whole life I have had\nthis numbness to to a desire to do\nanything in my life to complete anything\nmeaningful even even things that really\ninterests me and then I want to pour\nthings into and it I can agree I know\nthe trauma that that really did that set\nthis off I don't know if you want to go\ninto like specifics or anything well my\ndad got sick when I was around 12 years\nold and I've known from that certain\nplace in my life to now that that I have\nhad that feeling so before it's it's\nkind of candid I don't know if that's\njust childhood memories and nostalgia\nstuff but but I know that was the\ntrigger and then certain traumas after\nthat so okay\nkeep going so so can this like\nI have never went to a psychiatrist or\npsychologist or anything about this\nsadness I only went last year and I\ndidn't follow up on it because I was too\nscared to talk about my feelings right\nbut now chat right yeah you don't you\ncan't see my face but but now I've\nreached out to a doctor and and I get\nlike I feel I haven't reached out\nbecause my girlfriend broke up with me\nbut I've I've reached out because now I\ncan really feel the suffering of not\nliving like I know I have I I just wink\nI distinguish my thoughts between my\nfeelings and and logic and I know it's\nfor example I know it's not good to kill\nyourself I know it's it's hurting it\nwould hurt everyone around you and stuff\nlike that but my feelings say that that\nI don't want to live I don't have a\ndesire to live yeah and this I have\ncertainly that you have to discover\nright so this is where like most people\nthink and this could be true I don't\nknow that a desire to live is something\nthat people just stumble upon\nthere's this huge assumption that like\nthe default state is to have a desire to\nlive and have like goals and passions\nand motivations and my experience it\ndoesn't [ __ ] work like that a desire\nto live a reason to live is is something\nthat is gained through effort and sweat\nand hard work exploration pain and\nreflection\nyeah so how old are you Kevin\ntwit 26 okay so at your age I was doing\nabsolutely nothing\nlike not a damn thing I did from from\ncollege with a shitty GPA didn't have a\njob actually I did have a job maybe\nactually 26 maybe I was doing something\nI took that back\nmaybe but I mean I think you know you\nhave to do some soul-searching\nanyways yeah but that I mean your life\nlacks meaning which is the problem but\nalso that like meaning is not something\nthat you stumble upon and in your case I\nthink part of what's going on is like\nthis trauma that you said I think is\nvery significant now this is the other\nproblem as people confuse like trauma\nwith depression because both of them\nmake you feel like not doing anything\nbut I think the origins of these two\nthings are very different\nso if your root problem is that you\nstarted to feel like life was\nmeaningless because your dad got sick\nwhen you were 12 that's where the the\nwork needs to be done yeah and and I\nthink unresolved traumas can you call\nthat a trauma like sharable dying and\nyeah okay because there are several of\nthose that that I can like clear that\nadjusting how did you when you what do\nyou remember about when your dad got\nsick and you're 12 how did you feel oh\nthat that it's really rough and I laugh\nwhen I'm when I'm like nervous so yep\nyeah\nI I actually began when he was in the\nhospital I am I'm I was being kind of a\nstand-up comedian because\nI wanted everybody to laugh and I yeah I\nfelt really sad I don't know even know\nif that's the word because he worked so\nmuch before that I didn't even knew him\nand then he was home all the time and\nand and the I think the the change in\nour life that that he had had to be home\nand and change he had to do mentally\nlike he became another person a\nchronically ill person that\nI know I was specifically talking about\nmy feelings towards that the trauma or\nI'm getting confused sir yeah I think\nyou're doing great how did it feel to\nsee him transform\nthere was really devastating I think\nwould be the right word and then what\ndid it even remote in you it broke\nsomething\nyeah it broke like reality that did the\nthought that your parents are model and\nI certainly had to take on a much larger\nresponsibility at all I think the\nchallenge here Kevin I'm gonna just take\na shot in the dark because we're gonna\nhave to transition soon all right so I'm\nsorry no no no I mean I invited you on\nand I'm really glad you came on I'm\ngonna apologize to you because I think\nthe challenge here is that the feeling\nget created in you is not something that\na 12 year old knows how to put words to\nyeah and I still can't put worse\n- I'm gonna I'm gonna try I think that\nI'm feeling it created for 12 year old\nyou as what's the [ __ ] point if he\ncan work so hard and this can happen to\nhim and you can build so much in life\nand then you get to turn into this like\nwhat's the [ __ ] point\nyeah\nyeah like I've really struggled with\nlike what's it called and when you don't\ncare about the outcomes of things it's\nit's like a philosophy yeah yeah that\neverything is meaningless it's not a\nstoic stoic yeah nihilism I have really\nstruggled with that because one other\ntime when I was feeling really down I I\nreally had the thought that everything\nwas just meaning this yes so this is\nsomething you've gotta really understand\nKevin is like for you for other people\nit's a philosophy for you it's a reality\nbecause you saw it happened to you you\nsaw it happen to your dad you saw the\nfutility of life get shown to you in the\nway that your dad's life crumbled apart\nright so for other people it's something\nthat they read about in a philosophy\nclass for you you saw that when you were\n12 and it left its [ __ ] mark and now\nwhen you say like I have no reason to\nlive yeah because you don't understand\nwhat the point is because you are like\nwhat's the [ __ ] point if you can just\nget destroyed and if this is like if you\ncan work so hard you can build a life\nyou can have children you can have\nfamily you can have a career\nsounds like you worked a lot and then\nyou can get sick and it all just goes to\n[ __ ] like why bother like I don't think\nyou're suicidal which I know you've said\nyou aren't which I'm grateful for I I\nthink your problem is like what's the\npoint\nyeah and so that feeling was a has its\norigins in a lesson that you learned by\nwatching your father get sick\nand until you unlearn that lesson\nyou're going to continue to feel this\nway\ngood news is that it can be unlocked\nand that you can find me it's just 12\nyear old you didn't understand what was\ngoing on and the problem is that when\nwe're young the stuff that forms in our\nmind stays there but doesn't like grow\nwith us\nand someone was asking is this a some\nscar absolutely this is the definition\nof a some scar\nokay can you briefly say what that is no\nokay so I think I talked about some\nscars on a prior stream hopefully\nthere's a there's a so I'll explain it\nvery briefly so a some scar is a ball of\nundigested emotion that sort of\ncontinues to exert an influence on your\nmind all right all right that makes\nsense yeah so uh the the example that I\nuse is like if I'm walking down the\nstreet let's say that uh you you ever\nhang out with kids Kevin yeah I need uh\nnieces are never anything yeah I had a\nnice and when I was with my yeah so so\nwhen you how old is your niece nine okay\nso you did you hang out with your niece\nwhen she was like six yeah okay I got to\nknow whether fooled five years okay\ngreat so when you went imagine that your\nyour niece is six years old and you're\nwalking down the street and she sees a\ndog and she gets excited because she\nlikes dogs and she pets the dog and the\ndog bites her what happens in her mind\nwhat does she feel uh she would feel\nscared of the dark absolutely right\nshe's terrified so thankfully let's say\nthat the dog didn't really hurt her or\nanything like that she doesn't need\nmedical attention and then yeah she's\nyour niece so you have presumably\nbrothers or sisters who are her parents\nyeah it was among my girls girl friend\nsites oh yeah okay curses yeah okay so\num you know let's say that you're\nbabysitting the niece and then the the\nniece is crying and so you're kind of\nthinking like okay how am I gonna calm\nthis child down and then you walk into a\ntoy store and then you get her like ten\nminutes later she's got a toy in her\nhands and what do you think she's\nfeeling then\njoy absolutely right yeah yeah what\nhappened what happened to the scared\nwhat happened to the fear where'd it go\nis it gone mm-hmm no it's still there\nbut but now she has something else to be\njoyous about okay and what so let's say\nso how does the how does the fear come\nback in her what can bring it back up\nlike the when she sees a dog absolutely\nyeah right yeah and every time she sees\na dog that fear is gonna return yeah\nnow let's say you're walking down the\nstreet\nand you see a dog and you reach out to\npet it and it bites you what's the first\nthing that happens in your mind\nI wouldn't get scared but yes you would\nyes yes scared of more pain yeah in the\nfirst instant you would have the same\nreaction is your five-year-old niece\nyeah right yeah then what happens in\nyour mind\nyeah I would be able to distinguish and\nget over there I think I know what\nyou're getting at what am I getting at\nthat the like my niece that emotion\nwould stay with her for a long time but\nas an adult you would be able to\ndistinguish between having to be scared\nof a dark because one beat you and then\napproaching another one without being\nscared yes in the big difference is that\nyour mind does some processing of that\nemotion live processing it just doesn't\nget buried by distraction you actually\nthink through how you feel and you\nprocess it does that make sense it makes\na lot of sense like so my childhood self\nwas like bit by this trauma absolutely\nand and like now if it happened in in my\nlater years I would be able to process\nit process it in the whole other way so\nthat it wouldn't affect my everyday life\nis that actually Absa right so if if you\nhad found meaning in your life and your\ndad passed away and got sick now you\nwould still be sad you would still be\ngrief grieved you would still be\ndevastated but you would be able to\nprocess it and some people don't and\nsome people do right because some people\nlike you know in their 20s something bad\nhappens to them and they're not able to\nrecover so now that the big the big\nproblem the big difference between you\nand your niece is that you have the\ncapacity to process now the 12 year old\nyear old you did not yeah and so the\ngood news is you can go back in time and\nyou can sort of talk to your 12 year old\nself\nright with the help of a therapist or\nsomeone like that because that makes it\nway it easier and with the help of\nannotation you can go back and explore\nthose feelings and you can digest them\nyeah because now they right at this\nmoment they feel numb like I have a hard\ntime yes\nmatching bag and feeding anything yeah\ndo you play RPGs\nyeah which RPGs\nI've played World of Warcraft okay so\nmajority don't have an inventory right\nyeah problem here is that you picked up\na lot of crap like level five like\nswords and [ __ ] yeah you were 12 and\nit's sitting in your inventory and it's\nclogging up your inventory you never get\nrid of it you got to get rid of it it's\njust sitting back there and it's like\nburied so far in your inventory that you\ncan't even access it and it like every\ntime you open your inventory it's there\nand it's just [ __ ] taking up space\nand like you can't let but like so it's\nlike it's interfering with things but\nyou don't it's just there it's just like\nyou know and so you've got it you've got\nto process it you've got to go back and\nand so this is the tricky thing is like\nthe instinctual solution would be what\nyou have to do is find meaning in life\nright like that's the standard answer\nlike if you're unhappy and your life has\nno meaning\ngo and find meaning like we have this\ndiscord thing that you can join to where\npeople talk about what's wrong with the\nworld\nI think that's useful but what I want\neveryone to understand is that in in\nKevin's case it's not just finding\nmeaning it's finding when meaning went\naway\nbecause when you were nine or ten like\nlife hopefully has meaning like it's\njust it's simple meaning but its meaning\nI can read I can just I can like yeah\nclearly remember which person I was\nbefore this incident and and which\nperson I became after the incident yeah\nthere you go\nso you gotta go back and find that\nperson right yeah there's a guy in chat\nsaying vendor in your trauma\nabso-fucking-lutely that's what you need\nto do yeah right you got a vendor you\ncan't just like it's just hanging out\nit's been hanging out there and then the\nproblem is you you you've had that [ __ ]\nin your backpack for 14 years so you\nthink that your backpack\nis like has like thirty less spaces\navailable like you don't even realize\nit's become so normal for you that you\ndon't even realize that that's just like\nyou don't realize that you've got 30\nbackpack slots that are just taking out\nmy crap because you've had it since the\nbeginning like as long as you can\nremember that makes really a lot of\nsense yeah it really does I really feel\nlike like after the incident like\neverything from being able to do well in\nschool and and like everything yeah the\nmotivation and the desire to do anything\nlike it really felt like I only have\nlike a third of the motivation the third\nof everything else the third of the\ndesire to get up in the morning and yeah\nyeah so it looks like two-thirds of your\nbackpack is full and that [ __ ] is just\nswimming around in your unconscious mind\nand your\nI literally like like so this is\nsomething that I want everyone to\nunderstand about the mind one of the\nSwami's I was studying with once told me\nthat any task that's unfinished like\noccupies a bit of RAM in your processor\nand trauma to in your case I think the\nproblem is that two-thirds of your RAM\nis being occupied by whatever this is\nby what sorry but I like this trauma or\nwhatever like two-thirds of your\noperating power is just like clogged up\nyeah and and so the cool thing is that\nlike like we can talk about finding\nmeaning and finding Dharma and all that\ngood stuff you can watch some of the\nprevious streams about that or what\ncheck out our youtube if you don't know\nwhat I'm talking about yeah but at the\nend of the day in your case I think it's\nabout cleaning house right I think it's\nabout understanding that at some point\nin life you lost your sense of meaning\nand life became fundamentally like life\nbecame so this is what happened to you\nwhen you were 12 years old life became a\ngame not worth playing yeah it's just\nnot worth it to play anymore and so now\nyou find yourself at 26 and you're like\nwhy can't I play this game I think this\ngame is [ __ ] stupid and I'm saying\nyeah you do because you learned that\nwhen you were 12 it became a stupid game\nnow but you got to go back\nYeah right and you've got to find out\nlike what happened like why did I stink\nthis game Oh the reason the game [ __ ]\nsucks is because my controller got\nunplugged\nand so I just respawn and I get like\ncamped by these [ __ ] and I can't\nshoot and I can't move\nor I can use Waze to like move around\nbut I can't use my mouse select point\nanything now we're playing an FPS by the\nway yeah and then it's sure you can you\ncan in theory you can play FPS with just\na keyboard in theory but boy is that\ngonna be a shitty game to play you feel\nreally crippled yeah and how do you feel\nKevin crippled yeah absolutely yeah so\nPlus Mouse back in a name\nyeah\nokay we're gonna do some meditation like\nwith me or should I jump I mean you can\nhang out on discord if you want to I'm\ngonna transition alright alright sure\nthank you for your time thank you for\neverything you said reach out to Moses\nif you want to come back on and we can\ntalk more yeah sure I'll be here for the\nevening and then I go home and sleep and\nspend time with my children\noh yeah sure but where you can you can\ncome on and we can spend like an hour\ntogether okay that would be awesome yeah\nI'll uh I'll I'll write Moses okay yeah\nsure thank you so much sure how do we do\na round of applause for Kevin okay\nthanks a lot Kevin thank you yeah bye\nokay\nso\nyeah so I think I think you know Kevin\nwas struggling for the words I think\ncrippled is a good word alright so let's\ndo let's do meditation now the question\nis what kind of meditation are we going\nto do to\ngiven the situation today about trauma\nmeaning"
