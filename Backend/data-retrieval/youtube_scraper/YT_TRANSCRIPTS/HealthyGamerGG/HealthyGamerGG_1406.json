    "transcript": "we're gonna start with boole's so for\nthose of you guys don't know bulliest we\nhad bully asan stream some time ago and\nfrankly i don't even remember what we\ntalked about I just remember I told him\nto clean clean his [ __ ] room in his\nplaying maplestory come on man let's get\nstarted\nJulius\nlisten listen maplestory's close the\nexecutables Brooke okay I don't know\nwhat that means okay can you guys hear\nbully Asst\nuh yeah he's the slow rolling deprived\nyou guys from Albert that's right\nyeah you got it that's me okay\ncan you guys hear okay nice okay that or\nwhat are we calling you bully assert did\nI ask you your real name before\nI mean it's Matt so what did you prefer\nbut whatever\nI don't know I believe I guess because\nI'm used to but ok so bully Asst oh\nthere you go\nwhat's the origin of the word booyah s'\nblack desert and I was like I don't know\nwhat to name this pet the stupid little\nbird thing so I was like I don't know\nBulli astounds kind of cool something\nwith that and then I was like alright\nyou know what this is my new username I\nlike it okay so bulliest helped me\nunderstand a little bit about because\nit's been a while and I have a short\nmemory and so I do remember that we\ntalked about Dark Souls I remember that\nwe talked about you being a slow-rolling\ndeprived and that you know that's no way\nto go through life I don't know what the\n[ __ ] that means anymore\nso you do you why don't you why don't\nyou fill us in about what we talked\nabout and yes so like tell me like like\nwhat was your recollection of the last\ntime we talked and my memory isn't the\nbest either\nmaybe but whenever you ask me that it\ncomes up blank so okay so tell us a\nlittle bit about why you came on stream\nin the first place um I feel like I have\na lot of like personal issues that\npeople can probably relate to or that\ncan be solved by somebody who knows what\nthey're doing such as yourself so yeah\nso what do you think your your personal\nissues are um I've been thinking about\nit recently for this dream and I think\nto me things are like me being very\navoidant okay what happened no I'm sorry\nbut I was saying you were thinking about\nit before stream which is why I said oh\nokay yeah being very avoidant and also\nlike\nwas the other thing I can't remember\nokay so I think avoidance is good enough\nso let's talk about avoidance so why do\nyou think you're avoiding um because I\ndo things that are very avoidant like\nI'll put things off or like\nprocrastinate or like just if out of\nfear of conflict I won't like do certain\nthings\nokay so procrastination fear of conflict\navoidance so why do you think so fear of\nconflict sounds awfully psychological so\nhelp me understand what you mean by like\ngive me an example of how you're a boy\nde\nlike\nlike for example like cleaning my room\nor like doing okay your room is a\n[ __ ] mess I thought we talked about\nthat last time yeah I know I it's been\nit's it's a reflection of my soul I\nguess it absolutely is\nyou jest about that can I tell you a\nstory sure okay so I don't think I tell\nstories often on on on Twitch on Twitch\nbut I do it a lot in my private practice\nso when I was at the monastery of this\nplace called an ashram there was this\nplace called the quiet zone where there\nwas like a monk or like a Swami who\nlived there and then after a couple like\nso it's kind of this part of the ashram\nthat you're not allowed to go but after\nbeing there for a couple of months I was\nkind of invited to join a class like\nthey said like oh you can go and like\nlearn from the stood who's like you know\nhe's like the real deal and so I would\ngo out in the morning and and go to his\nplay his little Hut and then I noticed\nthat like outside of his Hut like next\nto his door there was like a plate a\nbowl a cup in a spoon that was leaning\nagainst the wall and just like drying in\nthe Sun and so every time I went out\nthere there was just this like plate\noutside his Hut and I was really\nconfused by that and so finally one day\nI you know stopped being avoidant and I\nasked him I was like so I have a\nquestion it may be out of line why is\nthere a plate a bowl a cup in a spoon\nsitting outside your door and so that he\nsaid that yeah you know despite all of\nmy training unless I do my own dishes I\ncan't do anything that day I have to\nclean my dishes and he gets like people\nwho bring brings him food from the\nkitchen and stuff like that so he gets\nall his meals prepared and delivered and\nI guess he like writes and reads and\nmeditates all day long so he's kind of\nlike he's got like servants and stuff\nbut at the end of the day he just can't\ndo [ __ ] unless he like does the dishes\nand I think boolie it's like if you if\nyou want to really get your [ __ ]\ntogether you've got it cleans so at the\nend of our conversation we're gonna do\ncleaning stream you're gonna stream\nyou're self cleaning okay okay we're\ngonna do stream cleaning stream\nsounds good okay and everyone at home is\ngonna do cleaning stream too and it's\ngonna be the highest value content on\nTwitch can I can we do that so that's\ngood okay and there's a very simple\nprinciple and in yogic thinking that\nlike cleaning stuff cleans your mind and\nthats something about like the intention\nout like how focused you have to be to\nclean is like you have to think but you\ncan't fully think like you're not fully\nabsorbed in it but it requires enough\nmental attention to where you your\nthought your mind can't spiral into\nnegativity when you're cleaning you just\ncan't do it right I feel like yeah\nthat's what happened last time yeah so\nwhat happened last time tell us like I\nfelt really kind of peaceful yeah I was\nlike thinking it was definitely just\nthose making music while I was cleaning\nyeah so we're gonna actually you know so\nat the end when we do our meditation\nwe're gonna do two rounds of meditation\nthe first round of meditation is gonna\nbe five to seven minutes of cleaning and\nI'm gonna do that too so I have a okay\nso we're gonna do this so I want to show\nyou guys something so this is my\nbookshelf and you see this you see that\npile of [ __ ] that's my [ __ ] pile I have\none two so I'm gonna clean two at the\nend of stream and I'm gonna clean my\n[ __ ] pile so we're all gonna do it\ntogether okay now my camera's tilted I\nshould really stop doing that okay but\ntell us about being avoidant what do you\nmean by this is really embarrassing\nbut I'm gonna I'm gonna give you an\nexample so like recently basically I\nI was kind of being avoidant in finding\na job and also because I couldn't pay my\nrent and I was kind of avoiding my\nlandlord yeah and also asking for help\nfrom my parents because it's\nembarrassing and like I feel pretty\ncrappy about it yeah I was like just\nhappened just yesterday and it's like I\nfeel like I can't control myself to a\npoint where I can stop being avoidant\nand like not let things blow up in my\nface and then do something about it yeah\nso first of all that does sound\nembarrassing I could imagine that you\nknow you feel ashamed about your\nsituation and so thank you for sharing\nand we're gonna try to help you through\nthat okay so let's start with so you\nsaid you're avoiding your landlord I got\nit I got it paid now but yeah I was at\nthe time okay and and why were you\navoiding your landlord cuz I didn't have\nthe money to pay for rent and I was\nafraid of like him being mad and also\nlike if I told my parents about the\nsituation they could probably help me\nbut they would get mad right so so that\nyour parents would get mad yeah or like\njust like kind of be they give me like a\nreaction that I wouldn't be happy with\nokay and what kind of reaction would\nthey give you like oh you need to get\nyour [ __ ] together you need to do this\nyou need to do that blah blah blah but\nlike I don't know that they she with\nlike how they seem to react is it's not\nlike it's always negative it doesn't\nreally doesn't feel constructive it's\nlike it's just telling me stuff that I\nalready know very good bullies now\nyou're you're starting to become\nunencumbered so this is this is how we\ngot to slow rolling deprived so I want\nall of you guys to understand that like\nwhen you carry this emotional weight\nyou kind of carry it but like it\nactually doesn't help you do anything\nright like knowing your conflict\navoidant having conversations with\npeople when you carry that weight it\nactually like weighs you down and like\nparalyzes you further does that make\nsense so we're gonna talk and try to\nunderstand that a little bit okay\nso when your parents when you have a\nconversation with your parents they say\nstuff like oh you need to get your [ __ ]\ntogether right how does it make you feel\njust bad it doesn't make me it doesn't\nmotivate me to do anything it just makes\nme feel bad why do you think that is\nbecause I know it's true and because\nlike it doesn't really doesn't feel\nhelpful yeah what what does it feel like\njust like I'm being insulted all in a\nway yeah and how I don't know how to say\nthis what would you like them to say\nlet's start there my mom wasn't too bad\nabout it yesterday but my cept I was\nworse than she was just kind of more\nunderstanding and what did she saying\nwell like I'm saying it was sorry and\nshe told me to stop saying I was sorry\nand like I don't remember exactly what\nshe said but she wasn't really as like\nmean about it\nand what about your stepdad she was\npretty much just like just get like get\nyour [ __ ] together like saying he's like\nangry with me and stuff he said he was\nangry with you or he sounded angry with\nyou\npolice sounded he said he was like\nfrustrated or something I don't remember\nthe exact words okay and did he say what\nwas frustrating for him no I don't think\nso how did you feel about yourself\nlike ashamed and unhappy what about\nfrustrated yeah yeah I'd say very\nfrustrated with myself too well what's\nfrustrating about your life right now\nlike I feel like I have no control and\nthat I'm generally pretty unhappy and\nit's hard to like be able to do a lot of\nthings yeah I can imagine that maybe\nyou're frustrated with yourself because\nyou're not helping yourself out and you\ndon't know how to help yourself out of\nit yeah right that's what's really hard\nis like you kind of know what you should\ndo and it doesn't really help to hear\nwhat you already know what you need to\nhear from them is what you don't know\nyou don't need them to tell you that\nyou're not you know it's it's kind of\nlike unfortunate that you're not able to\npay rent like you know that you know you\nneed to get a job you just don't know\nhow to do it so it's kind of like\nimagine if I went to the hospital and I\nsaid I've been throwing up for five days\nand then the doctor said well you're\nthrowing up for five days and then I'm\nlike yeah I know that already\nand they're like well you got to stop\nthrowing up you're like well like I\ncan't that's why I'm here because I\ncan't stop throwing up they're like well\nyou got to stop like other people aren't\nthrowing up why why are you throwing up\nlike you look around like the people\nlike like you know so-and-so's kid he's\nnot throwing up you're like yeah I know\nthat they're like I don't understand why\nyou don't stop throwing up like that's\nnot that's [ __ ] not productive so I\nthink it's very important to understand\nfirst of all bully is that\nso you think conflict avoidance is a bad\nthing\nor like you think avoidance is a bad\nthing right generally I'd say yeah I\nmean sometimes it probably has like its\nits merits but what are its merits I\nmean like if some dudes like at a bar\nand he's trying to like get in a fight\nwith you and you're probably gonna like\ntry and shank you or something it's\nreally good together absolutely so what\nis your avoidance do for you\nwho's the guy who's the guy with the\nshank what a beautiful analogy bulliest\nwho's shaking you right now me I guess\nno I don't think so\nwhat does it feel like when you talk to\nyour stepdad not good yeah it feels like\nyou're getting [ __ ] right I mean isn't\nthat what it feels like I think that's\nactually a great you're getting\nbackstabbed yeah\nwith a guy who's using a dagger in Dark\nSouls like it's like it's got good\nbackstab damage you shaken you and this\nis a thing like you don't want to get\nshaped like it [ __ ] sucks\nso I think this is really important to\nunderstand like you say you're avoidant\nand you make that sound like it's a\nproblem right like do you think being\navoidant is a problem not always but I\nthink for me yeah why is it a problem\nfor you because it causes me to avoid\nthings that I probably shouldn't be\navoiding okay so that makes sense but\nwhat does avoidance to do for you so if\nthere's something that you should do I\nwant everybody to understand this that\nthe reason that our mind does things is\nnot because it's shitty for us like\nthat's not why that's not how our mind\nworks our mind does stupid things\nbecause it actually helps us\nselect having this conversation with\nyour stepdad how does that help you\nit doesn't absolutely\nso that's important to understand right\nlike we have this we don't actually stop\nand think about what we're avoiding and\nwhy we're avoiding it like you were you\nkind of you're avoidant you need to have\na conversation with your parents and I\nguess presumably like the main reason is\nbecause you need to come up with money\nfor rent yeah and but at the end of the\nday like the reason that you're avoidant\nis because when you have conversations\nthey actually don't really help you they\nlike they're painful so it's like you\nknow if I'm if I'm cooking and I put\nlike my hand on my cast-iron skillet and\nI get burned and then I don't do that\nagain like we don't call that avoidant\nwe just call that smart right and so\nwhen you're like avoiding conversation\nwith your stepdad because he [ __ ]\nshanks you when you talk to him like\nsure that's a voice but it's also\nprotective so this is this is the other\nword that I want us to start thinking a\nlittle bit about is that avoidances is\nbeing protective like there's a part of\nyou that's actually trying to protect\nyourself from like getting shanked so\nthen the question becomes like bully us\nhow do we like if we want to stop being\navoidant what that means is that I just\nrun with me okay this is gonna be kind\nof weird cuz I'm gonna like do a hop\nskip and a jump what that means is that\nI want to stop being protective\nokay okay does that make sense you with\nme so far so how do you think it is and\nthis is super abstract and weird how do\nyou think it is that you stop being\nprotective\nyou make yourself more vulnerable yeah\nwell okay so I'm gonna use another\nanalogy okay so when you're in Dark\nSouls when do you have your shield up\nwhen I mean I usually don't use the\nshield but okay so your your when\nsomebody's shooting an arrow at you then\nyeah right so like when you're in a\ndangerous place so like the key to\nbecoming like to letting letting your\nprotections down is like actually not\nbeing in danger like you don't need to\nbe protective if there's no danger\nright and so then the question becomes\nlike why do you like where does the\ndanger come from because if we can\nunderstand why you feel the danger and\nwe can help you feel safe then you don't\nneed to be protective anymore\nright it's kind of like you know like\nlike when you're out in the world and\nyou're like armed and stuff but like\nwhen you enter town like you put your\nsword away and you put your shield away\nand you're like talking to people and\nbuying and selling stuff and it's like\nit's not a dangerous place right there's\nlike town and there's the real world and\nso if we can understand what it is that\nmakes you feel unsafe and we can\nactually quiet that part of you if we\ncan quiet you're avoiding the experience\nof some kind of negative emotion right\nbut if we can address that negative\nemotion then you no longer need to be\navoided so I don't think that the\nsolution to avoidance and this is what a\nlot of people think is like you just try\nto willpower your way through it\nyou're like oh [ __ ] like I have to have\nthis conversation why don't I just\n[ __ ] have this conversation has to\nhappen sometime why don't I just do it\nnow work it doesn't work\nabsolutely\nright\nsome things we have to we have to take\naway the thing which makes you be\navoidant and then you won't be avoided\novercoming avoidance is a completely\ndifferent thing which we can talk about\nlike in terms of brute force different\npart of your brain what I'm talking\nabout is sort of like emotionally\nprocessing the reason that you're being\navoided in the first place so why are\nyou of being avoided in the first place\nlike of my parents yeah cuz I feel like\nthey're they can be pretty negative in\nlike ways or like hurt me through like\nwords they're just making me feel like\ngarbage yeah and why do you feel like\ngarbage like because the things they say\nto me yeah and what do they say\nlike they just criticize me a lot okay I\ndon't know like specific examples okay\ncan you help me understand what kind of\ncriticisms like I need to like grow up\nor I guess that's one or that start to\nthink of like what exactly they say I\nthink I tried not to take like mental\nnote of it yeah try to block it out\nright so you're holding your shield up\nand then you can't see it's protective\nit's like you're going into like turtle\nmode and why do you think what they say\nis so hurtful like what hurts about what\nthey say like cuz they're like my family\nokay and like I care about what they\nthink\nbecause I'm assuming like there's some\ntruth to it I think do you think there's\ntruth to it somewhat I mean I'm not\nreally sure but I think possibly what do\nyou think is I don't go ahead sorry like\nI don't think I'm super happy with like\nmyself and like I don't think I'm\nperfect all the time so I think there's\nlike gasps some truth to it yeah do you\nthink that what do you think hurts more\nthe stuff that they're they're right\nabout that or the stuff that they're\nwrong about I'd say for me probably the\nstuff that they're wrong about so I feel\nlike they don't understand me what don't\nthey understand about you like I feel\nlike their perception of me is that I\njust don't care about like all my issues\nor anything and I'm not trying to do\nanything to make it any better but like\nI am like everyday so it's just it\nbothers me that they like think I just I\njust don't care when I do when they do a\nlot it sounds like you're you're\nactually working really hard to change\nyour situation and that they're not even\nI don't know if I really am like I don't\nknow if I can give myself enough credit\nto say that I am but I write ooh hmm\nwhat do you think you deserve credit for\nat least trying are you trying I'd say\nso I mean I don't want to feel like crap\nevery day yeah so what are you doing\nwhat is trying to look like\nlike going to therapy and like I got a\njob the other day and stuff so I guess\nthat's like some progress yeah I've been\ngetting a job to me sounds like a lot of\nprogress yeah how do you feel about the\njob well I feel pretty good I was pretty\nhappy about it when I got it so how do\nyou feel now I feel okay I mean I'm kind\nof anxious about the job because I\nhaven't started yet so I'm like I don't\nknow how it's gonna go but yeah it'll be\nit'll be good so I'll try it out\nso I bully us I think it can be really\nhard when you turn to someone for help\nand they don't how can I say this they\nkind of just address you like a symptom\nright so they kind of look at you and\nthey say like oh you got to grow up\nbecause you don't you're not doing X Y &\nZ and they don't really understand like\nthe root of it yeah you know um does\nthat make sense to you yeah what did you\nunderstand from what I said like there's\nmore to like they see just the problem\nthey don't see like the cause of the\nproblem yeah and then when they start\ntalking so I think the challenge here is\nthat like when someone just sees the\nproblem and not the cause of the problem\nthe way in which they talk to you\ndoesn't connect right because they're\njust talking they're not really like\ntalking about like what your experience\nis like they're not talking about the\nwhole picture they're just talking about\none piece right and and so they're\nthey're sort of like turning you into\njust like one version like they're\nturning you into a caricature of who you\nare\nright yeah so what do you think your\nwhat do you think it is that they're not\nseeing like that that I that I'm trying\nor that like it's it's really hard for\nme like I feel like their their\nmentality towards it it's like so just\nwholly different from mine and what are\nthey doing sir stand like you can't it's\nit's it's it's like a lot more too\ncomplicated than like just grow up 4head\nlike all that it's it's more complicated\nthan they make it seem yeah\nso what are the complications that\nthey're missing like it's hard for me to\ndo like the things that I need to do\nregardless of like all of that yeah what\nmakes it hard do the things that you\nneed to do like how I feel about myself\nfor like my um like just there's a lot I\nmean yeah if it feels like a lot so ah\nvery important hold on a second so so I\nasked you what makes it hard and what\ndidn't you say it feels like a lot it's\noverwhelming yeah so you said first how\nyou feel about yourself right that's the\nfirst thing you said and then you were\nlike trying to come up with other things\nand then you said it feels like a lot so\nI think we have to be very clear to\nunderstand that there's a difference\nbetween a lot of things getting in the\nway and one really big thing getting in\nthe way because I think that gives us a\nway forward so sometimes bulliest\ndespite your best efforts your mind\nactually tells you what's going on\nand what it's telling me is that the the\nroot of this is is the way that you feel\nabout yourself and that like when it's\nconversations that there there are\nthings that you fear about who you are\nand when you go to your landlord and you\nsay I don't have rent for the month the\nthings that you fear about yourself to\nbecome true when you talk to your mom\nand you keep apologizing you're\napologizing because there's a part of\nyou that is becoming true the part of\nyou that you're terrified of and the\nreason you hate talking to your stepdad\nis because he takes that part of you\nthat you're that you don't like about\nyourself and he sticks your nose in it\nand that feels like a shank\nand as long as that thing is there\nyou're gonna need your shield up\nyou're gonna need to be avoided because\nthat [ __ ] hurts\nso tell me what's that part of yourself\nwhat is that you're who is it that you\ndon't want to be\nlike\nI want to be able to be true to my word\nand like be responsible okay you want to\nbe true to your word and you want to be\nresponsible yeah okay\nwhat is being responsible mean\nlike doing the right thing despite it\nbeing hard\nokay I know and okay Tribeca that that's\na that's a way better answer than I\ncould I could didn't understand what the\n[ __ ] that meant I couldn't define it but\nI think that's a brilliant answer doing\nthe right thing when it's hard that's\nfrom the mouth of a slow-rolling\ndeprived you know I always assumed that\ndeprives couldn't speak for some reason\nlike if it's in my mind like they don't\nknow they're not capable of speech but\nanyway so I think truth we can get\nbehind so I think that you know bully us\nwe have a lot of ideas around like\npsychology and we kind of have this idea\nthat if you're avoidant you have some\nkind of emotion like my ideas I mean I\npromote this kind of stuff that like you\nknow if you solve that emotion or you\nprocess that emotion like life is gonna\nbe easier for you but I want to talk\nabout a different vein right now I want\nto talk about truth so in ancient India\nthe path to enlightenment began with to\ntwo steps the first was personal\nobservances in the second was societal\nobservances so societal observances are\nthings like cleanliness\nand personal observances or things like\nsatya or truth and i think that there is\nwhat they believed that there is power\nin truth and that's not something that I\nlike really understood like I don't know\neven know what that means kind of like\ndo you know what that means like do you\nthink there's power and truth I think so\nwhat is that even since you're good with\nwords what is it what the [ __ ] does that\neven mean\nyou\nI think there's like power in being\ngenuine and like being yourself and it\nmakes you feel a lot better and like\nalso it kind of\nvalidates you in a way okay and I feel\nlike if you're a lot more honest about\nthings and people can't really like I\ndon't think there's anybody in the world\nthat has like really terrible intentions\nreally and if you're honest about things\nin it kind of validates you in a way\nokay so weird per spec it is it so then\nhelp me understand if that's true why is\nit hard to have a conversation with your\nlandlord\nbecause it makes me admit things that I\ndon't like or that I embarrass it okay\nso but how does that weigh against this\npower of truth that you're talking about\n[Music]\nI guess I don't want to experience like\nnegative emotion but what is truth have\nto do with that\nnot sure fantastic nor should you be\nright because I think this is a concept\nthat's become lost so we have this\ninstinctive idea and I think you're\nright that truth truthfulness has power\nthe problem is that like we don't\nunderstand how to fit this idea of the\nthe power of truthfulness in with our\ndaily lives like we don't know like what\nthat really means like everyone sort of\ninstinctively is like yeah that sounds\nlike a [ __ ] you know it sounds like\nif you're a paladin like you can do some\ncool [ __ ] and that depends on truth so\nlike yeah there's something there but we\ndon't really know like we don't know\nright because we don't talk about this\nstuff anymore we teach mathematics we\nteach economics we don't teach about\ntruth and lying and what those do to us\nlike we we just talk about psychology\nand emotions so I want you to think\nabout something beliefs what do you\nthink would happen like so let's say\nthat like I cursed you and you were\nunable to lie do you think what do you\nthink would happen to your life probably\nimprove why because I I lied a lot\ngrowing up in it kind of just\nand made things worse a lot of the time\nlike making them better\nbecause like you kind of lose your sense\nof self and you're like flies become\ntruth in a weird way and also like\nit just it feels a lot better to tell\nthe truth okay now I'm a little bit\nconfused because earlier you were saying\nthat like it hurts to tell people the\ntruth you're avoiding it and you were\nalso saying that when you lie you become\nyou said something about like that's\nlike you become like the lie becomes the\ntruth\nyeah like it it's hard to explain you're\ndoing a good job but I agree so I'm\ngonna toss something out there I think\nthe part of yourself that you're afraid\nof grows every time you lie and it\nbecomes more and more true every time\nyou give in to that avoidance\nright that there's a part of yourself\nthat you think is shitty\nyou're afraid that you're shitty but\nthat every time you lie and every time\nyou're avoidant you make that more true\nwhat do you think about that suits\naccurate I'd say that's accurate yeah\nso what do we do bullies\nokay we'll see if twitch chat has any\nideas but I I think it starts with\ntruthfulness so I think you can get an\nimmense amount of power over Sofia and\nso I have an exercise for you bully us\nand everyone at home I want you to see\nhow long you can go without telling a\nlie okay how long do you think you can\ngo at least a day okay I don't know\nbecause there's like subtle subtle lies\nlike half-truths I don't know they can\nbe very complicated absolutely\ngood good so this exercise is gonna be\nvery important for you bullies because\nwhat you're already recognizing is that\nthere there's a certain machinery to\nyour actions and words that I don't\nthink you're aware of but if you start\nlooking at the lens of lying and truth\nyou'll begin to see these little things\nthey're like little beetles like\ncrawling around and shaping what you say\nin what you do and you're not even aware\nof what they're doing they're they're\nsubtle eyes they're half-truths there's\nlike not just lying to your landlord but\nlike leaving the house when you're not\ngonna see them there's pretending to not\nbe at home and all these other like\nlittle things\nnow pretend that all of that was off the\ntable what would happen in your life I\nthink I'd probably be less stressed\nabout like like worried about stuff like\nthat how the [ __ ] does that work like I\nthought the whole point of lying is to\nprotect you right yeah so this is the\nother important thing to understand\nlying is about control why do you lie\nlike what do you control like the other\nperson's perception absolutely\nthis needs to be understood very very\ndeeply when you lie it is to control\nanother human being right yeah how does\nthat work I mean how well does that work\nlet me put it that way\nit depends mm-hmm good answer has it\nworked out for you so far absolutely\nright so we think and in some cases\nlying does work really well but for the\nmost part it [ __ ] us like you have to\nunderstand that like lying is your\nattempt to control another human being\nthat's exactly what it is nothing more\nnothing less\nand so your problem Bulli is is that you\nare living trying to control your\nenvironment you're like trying to\ncontrol when the Sun rises and when the\nmoon rises instead of controlling like\nwhat you do your life is based on what\nis avoidance avoidance is all about the\nother person it's all about preventing\nsomeone from like saying or doing\nsomething to you the reason you're stuck\nis because your locus of control like\nwhat you're trying to do is like you're\nyou're hitting like the what was on your\nkeyboard and you're trying to control an\nNPC you're like when I hit spacebar why\ndoesn't the fire keeper roll like this\nis something that really needs to be\nunderstood so much of your effort is\nspent on controlling and external human\nbeing and it's [ __ ] inefficient it's\njust inefficient it feels good sure\nthere are emotions but you just got to\nunderstand you're expending so much\neffort the reason your stock is because\nyour brain you're a smart guy I can tell\nyou're a smart guy I think like\nsometimes when the stars align you can\ndo amazing things I already know that\nand the difference is with this when the\nstars align you stop focusing on others\nand you start focusing on yourself\nlike cleaning your room is not about\nother people who's it about me\nabsolutely and when you start doing\nthings for yourself then like your life\nis gonna start changing in Sathya is\nabout this Sathya is about the real\npower of sathya comes when I stop lying\nI stop trying to control other people's\nactions so when I stop trying to control\nother people's actions do I surrender or\ndo I gain freedom\nbleus what do you think freedom how do I\nnot surrender I mean you surrender like\nyour control I guess yes and that gives\nyou freedom we think about freedom and\nsurrender is opposite ends of the\nspectrum they're actually the same thing\nthat when you surrender your ability to\ncontrol another human being you gain\nfreedom give you guys a classic example\nI like a girl I want to ask girl out\nI'm afraid girl doesn't like me let me\ndo things to control the way that she\nthinks about me let me lie about my\nincome let me lie about my past and let\nme lie about my job and if I do these\nthings\ngirl will say yes when I ask her out and\nevery time you say one of those lies\nlike do you think that person how do you\nthink that person feels when they\nconstruct this story to impress said\ngirl like Jenny\nyeah they feel trapped\nthat's what lies do to you they trap you\nlike when you're avoiding your your\nparents and you're avoiding your\nlandlord you're [ __ ] trapped you feel\npowerless and that's a prison that you\nmake yourself with your words mm-hmm\nso it starts there's an immense amount\nof power if you want to transform your\nlife speak truthfulness\nbecause a funny thing happens if you\ncommit to being true your actions must\nchange right so if you take lying off\nthe table like what happens to your\nactions become like in the open yeah and\nlike how do you think they change like\nyou probably care more or it's like you\nprobably if you're honest about it then\nit probably is like more like prevalent\nyou're like okay this is probably\nchanged absolutely right so what's an\nexample of that this needs to change cuz\nI can't lie about it anymore\nlike what's an example of that like what\ndid you have for lunch a salad or a\nhamburger it's that simple if I can't\nlie if I commit to not lying about what\nI had for lunch I'm gonna start eating\nhealthy is all those times that you're\nembarrassed about what you ate you\n[ __ ] lie about it like why do you lie\nabout it because you don't want other\npeople to think that you're a [ __ ]\nfatty right and if you stop lying about\nit then you just start eating healthy I\nknow it sounds absolutely insane it\nsounds absolutely insane is is fixing\nyour diet as simple as not lying and so\nI challenge you to try it see how long\nyou can go see how long you can go and\nthen what happens bulliest is when you\nsee how long you can go you see how your\nlife changes you see like so like you\nwant to go a day without lying okay fine\nlet's see it can you go two days like\nwhy can't you go two days I'm just I'm\nnot sure I know you're not sure but what\nwhy do why are you gonna lie what do you\nneed a lie about well I don't know what\nI'm good right so when you say you need\nto lie what do you what is it what are\nthe kinds of things that you're going to\nneed to lie about why would you lie\nwell I don't know I don't know it I\ndon't think I would live it it's just\nyeah you're gonna lie and you're gonna\nlie when you need someone to think\nsomething about you right right that's\nwhen you're gonna lie and when you need\nsomeone to think something about you\nthat's when you that's when the [ __ ]\nstarts that's when you're screwed\nbecause then you are letting that\nperson's perceptions of you control the\nperson that you are in the way that you\nfeel about yourself\nso Satya is where it begins truthfulness\nwhen we talk about psychology continue\nseeing your therapist fantastic go get\nsome real mental health treatment and in\nthe meantime like try truthfulness\nokay questions thoughts\n[Music]\nOh me yeah I don't have any virgin\nthings okay what do you think about what\nwe're talking about how do you feel\nabout it pretty good about it\nso always been trying to be more genuine\nso it's like\nmakes sense seems like actually a reason\n- yes a reason to be genuine yeah so\nthis is like this is the hard thing\nbeliefs to be honest like this is tricky\nbecause you know we have all these\nplatitudes of like yeah you should be\ntruthful but no like you should\nunderstand understand the benefits of\ntruthfulness and understand the benefits\nof line\nand then you pick you try them both out\nin your life like you take a you take a\nbite of vanilla and you take a bite of\nchocolate like when you're trying out\nyour ice cream what you taste both and\nthen you decide for yourself which one\nyou want I think right now the biggest\nproblem is that you're operating on\nreflex and I think you've you've said a\nlot of really important and profound\nthings today\nIII think you've you've said that you\nknow the one of the best things that I\nlike about what you said which I'm gonna\nyou know steal and use on stream is\ngonna be this whole thing about when you\nlie to other people if there's like a\npart of that lie that becomes the truth\nthat I think is really powerful and\nevery time you lie you like propagate\nthis idea of like who you are mm-hmm and\nand I think this avoidance and stuff\njust start telling the truth and then if\nyou really commit to that and you see\nhow long you can go and I'm not saying\nyou can't ever lie again\nlike a commitment really doesn't work\nbut you just see how long you can go and\nthen for the if you can lie if you can\nstop lying for one day that's gonna be a\ngood day\nquestions yeah thoughts feelings\n[Music]\nI'm like I'm like thinking a weird like\nis joking like lying in a way good what\ndo you think kind of yes and no\nso weird half-baked thought no it's not\na half-baked dot I think what you're\ntrying to do is figure out what kind of\nLies you're allowed to tell because I\nthink you're a very good liar\nunfortunately yeah\nright so so even now you see what's\nhappening in your mind is you're trying\nto figure out how you can protect\nyourself and still fulfill the criteria\nof the thing that's what's happened well\nit's more like I don't I don't want to\nmess it up so I don't want to like do\nthe wrong thing\nyes so the wrong thing is to lie right\nyeah yeah and so you know what that is\nit's not that complicated you know what\nI mean and you're looking for a\nworkaround because that's how addicted\nyou are to like lying and hiding and\nbeing avoided like what I'm doing is I'm\ntaking your I'm D equipping your armor\nand your shield and then you're like\nwell can I wear a loincloth like can I\nat least get a little bit of armor like\nnope no alone clock not allowed to wear\nanything that's what you're doing like\nOh what about a joke what about like an\nemotion what about a half-truth I mean\nsure you can can call whatever we want\nyou want to but if you find a good way a\nclever way to lie without lying and I\nthink we can talk about that one day cuz\nI think that actually has its its\npurpose you guys want to do story time\nI'll tell you guys a story about that um\nbut I think I mean that I think you know\nright and like you don't hear this story\nhuh I want to hear this story though\nokay so my mom once told me something\nvery profound which is so there are two\nincarnations of this guy named Vishnu so\nVishnu is one of the Hindu gods and\nVishnu is sort of like the God that\nhelps out humanity and so when evil is\nlike very powerful in the world he\nincarnate s' and then tries to deal with\nthe evil and so in one of his are\nincarnations is this guy named Krishna\nand Krishna is kind of a shady [ __ ] so\nI'll give you guys just an example of a\nstory that that Krishna did so there's a\ncivil war going on in India between two\nsets of cousins and the story of the\nCivil War is something called the\nMahabharata but one set of cousins is\ncalled the Pandavas they're the good\nguys another set of cousins is called\nthe goat OVAs and they're the bad guys\nso Krishna one day they're there let me\njust think about which story to tell you\nso one day they're Christian who knows\nthat there's going to be an eclipse and\nthere's a code of war that people follow\nso they fight from dawn till dusk and\nlike between dusk and dawn they're not\nallowed to fight so what Krishna does is\nhe goes to his the bond of Oz which are\nsupposedly the good guys of the story\nand he says that okay like around 3 or 4\np.m. like you guys aren't gonna they\ndidn't have watches and stuff back then\nbut it's gonna look like the Sun is\ngoing down and dusk is gonna happen\nsooner than you think it is so what I\nwant you guys to do is stop fighting for\nlike 5 or 10 minutes\nand then like the Kauravas your enemies\nwill stop fighting - because everyone is\ngonna think it's dusk and then once they\nput their weapons away and the ones that\nare retreating off the field of battle I\nwant you guys to pull out your weapons\nand attack\nand so the the bond of us are like but\nisn't i'm confused like aren't we\nsupposed to like stop attacking after\ndusk and the Christian is like no no man\nand like it's okay trust me like you're\nnot gonna be breaking any rules it's\ngonna seem like you're breaking rules\nbut you're not gonna break any rules so\nthe bond of us say okay so they go onto\nthe field of battle and sure enough the\nEclipse happens and so like everyone\nthinks it's getting dark and so people\nput their weapons away and they stop\nfighting and then the Kauravas kind of\nturned around and they start to leave\nthe field of battle and what do you\nthink the bond of Oz do they do the same\nthing leave the field of battle I hope\nso yeah they do the opposite they listen\nto Krishna\nthey pull out their weapons and they\nMassacre people who are leaving the\nfield of battle and unarmed mm sounds\nimmoral right like is that a lie is that\ntruth what do you think yeah right feels\nimmoral so I'm gonna tell you another\nstory so a couple thousand years and\nmaybe a thousand years before Krishna\nvishnu decided to incarnated like before\nthat and he came down as a guy named ROM\nand ROM is sort of like this kind of\nlike ideal human and so ROM story is\nkind of interesting so he gets married\nto this this princess named Sita and\nthere's an evil king who is like lustful\ntowards even he like really wants her\nand is disappointed that she chooses to\nmarry rom and so what what this evil\nking his name is Robin you've fallen me\nso far yeah okay so what Robin does is\nhe abducts her he kidnaps her and he\ntakes her to his his palace which is on\nan island called Lanka if you guys know\nwhere Sri Lanka is it's like a little\nisland south of India so he abduct Sita\nand he takes her down there and then ROM\nsays okay I'm gonna you know I'm gonna\nhave to get her back so he raises an\narmy and over the course of a year or\ntwo he fights against Robin kills Robin\nrescue Sita brings her back to his\nbrings her back to his court and is kind\nof frustrated because like his court\nsort of doesn't accept her anymore\nthey're like yeah\nlike yeah I know she was kidnapped but\nshe was like in his house for like over\na year and like how do you know she was\nfaithful and like we don't she's kind of\ntainted they're sort of very puritanical\nback then and so what do you think ROM\ndoes I don't know okay let's see if it's\ntwitch at things what do you guys think\nhe does\nokay so kills the cork pops okay so ROM\nactually decides to divorce her and he\nsays that my first duty is to the\nkingdom and if the court won't accept\nher as like a queen and like they think\nthat she's tainted then my first duty is\nnot to my own happiness but is to the\nkingdom and and so he divorces her and\nhe's upset and and you know people sort\nof say that that's like kind of the\nideal wonderful thing to do but my mom\nonce told me something very very wise\nand she said that if you want to live\nlike what do you think about that\nlet's start there I mean it's kind of\nstupid yeah so my mom once told me\nsomething very profound which she\ndoesn't remember to this day which is\nthat if you want to live a good life\nlive like ROM if you want to live a\nhappy life live like Krishna I don't\nknow if I agree with that okay say\nsomething tell me what don't you agree\nwith what wouldn't like the guilt weigh\nyou down if you look like Chris\nI don't know man how are you gonna find\nout I mean I kind of have already so I'm\nlike I don't know if that's a good idea\nyeah so what are you saying about your\nlife bullies what is it so earlier you\nasked me you said yeah it feels like a\nlot it feels heavy it's overwhelming\nwhat's overwhelming what's heavy my\nfeelings towards myself yeah and what\nare some of those feelings wouldn't the\nguilt weigh you down right gilben yeah\nis that how you feel yeah I think I can\nbe I can be guilty over things I've done\nyeah right guilt for not doing more\nguilt for becoming the person that you\nare guilt for creating the life that\nyou've created so I'll accept it you\ndon't think that so people say my mom\nsays that you should be cunning and cold\nand that the ends justifies the mean and\nthat's that's Krishna's path and if you\ndon't agree with that that's fine so\nlive the other way and then get back to\nme okay\nright but that means stopping to live\nthe way that you are and what does that\nstart with bullying yes truthfulness\nsathya so you're gonna go a day at least\ntoday at least a day pay attention okay\nokay so we're gonna see I guess let me\njust see if people do other people have\nquestions I think our featured chat\nthing is not working it looks like right\n[Music]\nlet me just see real quick for something\nso I want to know like yeah so so oh it\nis working so why don't I see anything\nin it could I explain Christian how do i\noh here we go okay okay okay okay okay\nokay okay a lot of people are asking\ntechnical questions about lying it's the\nfirst thing that I want to know is\ntwitch at how long are you guys gonna\nnot lie for like what do you guys want\nto do what do you think okay so I'm\nseeing everything from like a few\nminutes to like never again so I really\nwant you guys to try this at home and I\nwant y'all to do exactly what bulliest\nis doing I want you to see when you\nstart when you stop lying what happens\nto your life like does it get harder\ndoes it get easier does it get harder\nfor a time and then easier one week okay\nI think that's a great idea\nso let's just start again this being\nunder this 18 hours yeah so so I mean so\nthis is the thing like I don't care\nabout hypotheticals right we can talk\nabout hypotheticals but ultimately\nchange happens through experience when\nyou actually start doing things\ndifferently like that's when you're\ngonna learn so Bulli is's been living a\nlife like krishna he's been living a\nlife of like sneakiness and subterfuge\nand you don't like the way it makes you\nfeel fine so start living a different\nway so I'm gonna start answering\nquestions but I'm gonna encourage\nbulliest to start cleaning or actually\nhold on do we want to clean is like a\nmeditation together and check-in about\nhow people feel or do we want\nlet's do QA and then we'll do cleaning\nstream how does that sound\nsure okay let's do questions okay so one\nquestion is how do you avoid being\nemotionally burned out from your\ninteractions with your clients because\nso this is what I want you guys to\nunderstand like why do you guys think\nbully is's life wiliest why do you think\nliving your life is so [ __ ]\nexhausting like why aren't you like do\nyou feel burned out emotionally\nyeah yeah right so why\nI feel like I'm doing it wrong okay and\nyou know why you're doing it wrong\nbecause you're being inauthentic\nright so burnout comes from like living\na life that's fake like living a life of\nLies is mentally and emotionally\nexhausting I don't get burned out from\nmy clients because I'm I'm like this so\nlike I want to be me like I'm a bad\ntherapist for some people because I like\nto talk and I ask people like difficult\nquestions and in the sense I don't spare\ntheir feelings like if I have to sit\nback and restrain myself if I don't get\nto tell random ass stories then I get\nbored and it's hard for me but I find\nclients or I think the people that I'm\nable to help are the ones that are like\nopen like if someone is like pissing\naround and like not answering questions\nand stuff that I find tiring but\ngenerally speaking I don't get tired\nas long as I'm being authentic and I\nthink like one of the most exhausting\nit's just so hard I mean like I don't\nknow how else to put this but you know\nwhen you're living an inauthentic life\nit's like you're you're like a mage\nwho's like running around with a\ntwo-hander like it's just gonna be\nshitty it's just it's just you're gonna\nsuck at it and it doesn't it's just\nexhausting whereas if you live a life\nthat is kind of like honest and\nauthentic then it's actually you get a\nlot of energy and you just do better so\nit's not that exhausting okay so next\nquestion is bully us about chores like\ncleaning etc I think once you start\ndoing them more often you'll get into\nthe habit of doing it automatically when\nthere's less chores left it'll feel less\noverwhelming what do you think about\nthat\nI mean the hardest part is starting\nand also I don't know part part of it\nfor me is it's like it feels like it's\nnever-ending\nbecause there's always many more to do\nso I think those are really important\npoints right so hard I agree that's\nstarting is the hardest and what's wrong\nwith it being never-ending\nI mean it just it's\ntaxing I guess cuz you're like I don't\nwanna have to do this but I have to keep\nhaving to do it yeah so I think I think\nthis is this is gonna be important\nbooyah so one day we're gonna have a\nconversation about how completion is not\nthe goal\nright right so your focus is on getting\nthings completed you want to just get\nthat rent paid and you want to have that\nconversation be over and as long as you\nwant that conversation with your stepdad\nto be over it's gonna be really hard to\ndo but oddly enough if you can free\nyourself from wanting to be done the\ndoing becomes really easy\nthat's hard though does that make sense\nyeah okay next question\nwhat about lies that you yourself\nbelieve what are the effects of them\nthat's an interesting question I don't\nknow how do you know what you believe is\nhow can you tell the difference between\nwhat you believe being true or a lie\nlook I'm kind of curious about that\nprobably feeling what do you mean like\nyou can kind of sense it I think if it's\na lie\nhow can you sense it\nlike when you say something that's a lie\nyou can kind of feel that it's like\nincorrect and what are you in a way what\ndo you think the effects are of the lies\nthat you tell yourself\nI think they're more than negative than\nanything generally I mean so I think\nthat the main thing to understand once\nagain is that lying is about control\nright so if you're lying about yourself\nlike if you let yourself believe a lie\nlike you have to understand that that\nlie is serving a purpose for you and you\nhave to understand like what is the\npurpose of lying to yourself what is it\nabout myself that I'm unwilling to face\nor accept about who I am or what I've\ndone\nand ultimately I think if you want to\nmove forward you have to accept who you\nare case in point and we just talked\nabout you know being a mage and wielding\na two-hander and sure you can you can be\nGandalf no but Gandalf is the exception\nnot the rule\nright like most of us are not running\naround as Gandalf and also Gandalf\nreally didn't use magic so he's\nbasically a fighter let's remember that\ntoo\nbut you know I think when it comes to\nlying to yourself just understand that\nlike lying to yourself is is gonna be\nhard because you're you're making\nyourself become something that you're\nnot and when you start playing a\ncharacter that you actually aren't like\nwhen you start you know like not being\nyourself\nlife is just gonna get way harder so I\nthink it can be hard because a lot of\ntimes we do lie to ourselves and that\nline to our self is a protective\nmechanism and what we're trying to\ncontrol is like we're trying to control\nourselves right we're trying to we're\ntrying to control the like sort of the\nway that we view ourselves and I\ngenerally think that that isn't hat that\nisn't healthy but it can be hard to\novercome right okay\nnext question is let's talk about being\ntoo honest I don't see what question\nthat is okay so let's talk about being\ntoo honest fine so I don't want you guys\nto take so this happens sometimes where\nsomeone is like I am like a fan of\nradical honesty and they say that like\nI'm committed to truth and I'm going to\nspeak the truth wherever I go so I don't\nthink that that's a good idea like so I\nthink sometimes people confuse satya\nwith a license to be an [ __ ] that's\nnot what's up yes\nSathya doesn't mean like you you go to\nlunch with your friends and you call\nlike your buddy's girlfriend out for\nlike gaining 15 pounds because that's\nyour truth you're gonna speak your truth\ndon't let set there become an [ __ ]\nlike so being honest so this is the\nother thing like being honest is not\nreally about this is gonna sound weird\nit's not about like what you portray to\nother people right ultimately honesty is\nabout like you being honest with\nyourself\nand you know you should be honest with\nothers when it's relevant but it's not\nlike you're gonna be like radical\nhonesty and like I'm gonna say tell\neverything like I'm gonna tell people\nwhat I think about them I'm gonna tell\nthem that I think they're an [ __ ] and\nlike I think there's value to honesty\nbut don't confuse being honest in sathya\nwith being an [ __ ] which sometimes\npeople do and it's a really easy mistake\nto make and and so you should be honest\nbut you know don't be too like don't let\nme put it this way just because you're\nhonest doesn't mean you have to open\nyour [ __ ] mouth so when it's\nimportant and when it's relevant to the\nconversation you open your mouth and you\ndon't lie but it doesn't give you a\nlicense to just share your your stupid\nopinion with everyone about everything\nthat you think that's not what honesty\nis about what about lying to save others\nfrom harm what do you think what do you\nguys think is it okay to lie to save\nothers from harm so everyone's saying it\ndepends on the harm what do you think\nbilious you're on the hot seat\nis it okay to lie to protect others from\nfrom harm I mean I think the safe answer\nis it depends but I think the genuine\nanswer is not really okay so I'd start\nby by not accepting the premise of the\nquestion which is that I don't know that\nlying necessarily protects people from\nharm I don't I don't start with that\npremise so I have been shocked by how\nmuch I think about lying protecting\npeople from harm and I'll give you guys\njust an example\nso I was working with someone I was\nworking for a while on the cancer\npsychiatry like consultation service so\nfor like a month or two months or\nsomething like that I was basically a\npsychiatrist that worked with people\nwith cancer and one of the simplest\nthings that people do is they lie to\ntheir kids especially if they're young\nkids about people having cancer and\nthat's a very that's kind of like a safe\nbet like you think like if you're lying\nto someone like let me lie to my\nnine-year-old about like me having\ncancer so the parents will get together\nand they'll lie to their nine-year-old\nand they'll say like oh yeah\nlike dad is gonna be fine he's sick and\nhe's in the hospital now right like\nthat's a pretty safe lie like you're\ntrying to protect your kid what do you\nthink how do you think about what do you\nthink about that beliefs I don't think\nit's a safe lie cause it's gonna blow up\nin your face regardless and it's\nprobably gonna make it worse because in\nthere they feel like they were lied to\nso that's I think an example of one of\nthe most compassionate lies irrespective\nof whether it's right or wrong or stupid\nI think that is the most that is the\ncase that I can think of that is the\nmost compassionate and well intentioned\nlie I've ever encountered which is that\nI don't want my child to realize that\nlike they're gonna lose their parent and\nI want to protect them from that I don't\nknow protect them from that but you you\ncan't right so I don't know that lying\nreally saves other people from harm like\nI just don't accept that premise I mean\nI'm not saying it isn't theoretically\npossible but in my experience many of\nthe cases that people think that lying\nis gonna protect someone from harm and\nboy the kind of [ __ ] that people keep\ncome up with yeah you know like I'm not\ngonna let my spouse know that I had an\naffair because it's over now and the\nonly thing it would do would hurt her\nfeelings right true on some level maybe\nI don't know but\nanyway I think the thing about like that\nspecific lie is that like what if the\nparents not fine then what happens which\nwhich parent like let's say like that oh\nI don't have just gonna be in the\nhospital be fine and then they like they\npass away or something then like what's\nthe kids supposed to think yeah I\ncompletely agree so someone is someone\nin chat is asking I'm just gonna ask a\nfollow-up question let's say you saw\nsomeone in danger the only way to say\nsave him is lying would you not lie so\nmy question is what is a scenario in\nwhich the only way to save that person\nis lying right so like what I'm saying\nis that generally speaking like in my\nexperience people come up with these\nhypothetical scenarios but we're not\ntalking about hypothetical scenario\nwe're talking about\noh yeah Jews in the Attic I think you\nshould absolutely lie about Jesus in the\nAttic absolutely oh that's a good one\nthat's different yeah no I mean I'm like\nI said I'm not saying it's a hundred\npercent true I think you should lie\nabout Jews in the attic sure that's a\ngood one right yeah so I'm glad for\nsomeone mentioning that because I think\nthat's I hadn't really thought about\nthat I've never been faced in a\nsituation where I've Jews in the Attic\nso yeah but that's why I love chat I\nmean like let me be the first to say\nthat you know I don't have all the\nanswers and if you guys come up with a\ngood examples that's good in my life and\nclinical experience the number of times\nwe're lying actually protects people\nfrom harm is is I haven't encountered\nthat really and the number of times that\nI've told people to be truthful and\ncounseled them to be truthful has been\nlike really really important like it's\nbeen overwhelming ly+ okay does not\ngiving an answer to something constitute\na lie if you know the answer but choose\nnot to provide one is that a lie what do\nyou think so you cut out a second so\nsomeone's asking if you if you don't if\nyou don't provide an answer is that the\nsame as line\nno no not really because it's like you\ncan choose not to answer something it's\nnot I mean it can kind of depend but\nlike if you said I don't know to\nsomething you can kind of consider that\nas like a lie like if you knew what\nhappened but it's like yeah so I mean I\nthink this is exactly why we do this\nexercise right because I think we can\ntalk about hypotheticals as much as we\nwant to but I've known very few people\nI'm tempted to say none but I mean it's\ngot to have happened whose life has been\nchanged by a hypothetical so like these\nquestions quickly become philosophical\nthey quickly become hypothetical and\nthey quickly become academic you guys\nsee what's happening like people are\nasking but like what about this like\nwhat about the OJ Simpson and what about\nbeing a defense attorney like we're not\n[ __ ] talking about that like sure\nlike someone said like Jews in the Attic\nI will concede that when it comes to\nSofia I think the right thing to do is\nto lie about Jews in the Attic so that\nthey don't get like killed I agree right\nyou know I'll be the first to say that I\ndon't think that that's a relevant\nexample for your life and if it is\nplease do the right thing but at the end\nof the day like you guys have to be\ncareful because watch what's happening\nas you come up with a hypothetical\nquestion and you answer it in a\nhypothetical way you feel like you\nlearned something this is really\nimportant to understand you guys feel\nlike you figure it out and the more you\nfeel like you figure it out the less\nlikely you are to do the exercise\nand this is why people [ __ ] stay\nstuck is because they live a life of\nlike a philosopher where they just think\nabout things and then think about\nhypotheticals and they wake up the next\nday and like all of the energy of Satya\nis gone because you sorted it out like\njust see how addictive this\nphilosophical thinking is because now\nit's like oh but we like came up with\nsomething what about this dr. K what\nabout this and yeah okay fine you guys\nfigured out you guys figure it out like\nwhere's Satya falls apart fantastic good\njob now what are you gonna wake up the\nnext day and and try to not tell the\ntruth like this is this is so dangerous\nbecause gamers especially are like they\nget so ensconced in like analytical\nreasoning and hypotheticals and\nphilosophy like you guys are all\nbrilliant [ __ ] philosophers the\nchallenge is that being a philosopher is\nnot gonna change your life\nin theory we think about philosophers as\npeople who have transformed lives and I\ndo think that you know like Marcus\nAurelius and stoicism I think are like\nbrilliant philosophies and if you\nimplement it that's one thing but\nphilosophically talking about Marcus\nAurelius is not gonna do [ __ ] you\nactually have to go out and answer this\nquestion for yourself does not giving an\nanswer constitute a lie we can say\nwhatever we want to and you can be\nlogically right or logically incorrect\nmy question to you is when you wake up\nthe next morning and someone asks you\ndid you take out the trash like what are\nyou gonna say are you gonna say would\nyou like some orange juice this morning\nlike are you gonna do that and how do\nyou feel like what is that like that's\nthe question right like you got to start\nliving it and then you come up with the\nanswer this is the other thing is\nsomewhere along the way you guys got the\nimpression that I have answers somewhere\nalong the way you guys got the\nimpression that I know what I'm talking\nabout\nI want everyone to understand this very\nclearly I don't have a [ __ ] clue I\nknow about my life but I don't know [ __ ]\nabout yours everything that I say should\nbe put through the crucible of your own\nexperience I'm not giving you guys a\nroad map I'm giving you guys like\na protocol to run an experiment that's\nwhat the stream is about is fine you\nguys think I'm saying what I'm saying is\ncorrect try it prove me wrong\nfigure it out for yourself that's the\nmost important thing okay what\ntechniques can someone do to distinguish\nbetween the lies and truths you tell\nyourself okay this is a fantastic\nquestion how do you tell if you're lying\nand how do you tell if you're you're\nbeing truthful\nboolie is how do you feel when you tell\na lie\nyou feel like you're being dishonest how\ndoes that feel like wrong like it feels\nwrong okay feels not good so how does it\nfeel like so there's some dark and nasty\n[ __ ] going on in your life and they're\ndark and nasty corners of your\npsychology and self right yeah and when\nyou lie about yourself like how do you\nfeel not good okay when you come on\nstream and there are I can't see I'm a\nBoomer 1.5 K when there are a thousand\n15 of 500 people listening to you\ntalking about the shittiest parts of\nyour psychology how do you feel fine\nthere it is how the [ __ ] does that work\nthis is the stuff that you strive to\nhide\nthis is the stuff that you keep tucked\naway this is what's behind the shield\nand armor right this is like what's\ninside the turtle shell like how the\n[ __ ] does that work you work so hard to\nhide it and when you successfully hide\nit how do you feel how do you feel\npolice when you hide him not the\ngreatest and then when you air it out\nlike your dirty ass laundry like your\nsexual proclivities how do you feel\nright\ngenerally pretty good since sometimes\npeople will like showing you yeah so\nwhen you're lying to yourself I think\nthe biggest thing to check into is what\nis like what is your emotional response\nright when someone walks down the street\nif I'm walking down the street and\nsomeone calls me a [ __ ] and then I'm\nlike okay man what are you if you say so\nand then if someone calls me [ __ ] I'm\nlike no you're the [ __ ] [ __ ]\nlike that emotional response tells me\nwhat how I feel about myself if I'm\ntruly confident like you suck at life\nman you're like a [ __ ] poser I'm\ngonna be like okay you think I'm a poser\nfine it's your emotional response\nthat is\nthe important thing right if someone\nsays calls you something nasty\nand I apologize if apparent I mean I\nknow return can be offensive so I'm\nsorry for using that word but like I\nthink like if someone is calling you\nsomething nasty\nthe way that you respond to it tells you\nhow you feel about yourself and when\nyou're telling yourself truth or lying\nlike if you're telling yourself\nsomething that's true like you're gonna\nfeel okay with it it can hurt but it can\nstill feel like liberating it can feel\nfree and lying feels protective it like\nprotects you from that negative emotion\nbut you feel like [ __ ] so I think that\nlike that's a really important thing so\nlike how do you feel when you speak\nsomething right does it feel like you're\nyou're getting through something and you\nfeel like lighter at the end of it or do\nyou feel heavier at the end of it and\nthat's I think the biggest way you can\ntell okay so madam Faye is asking oh god\nthere's so many questions okay we're\ngonna do like a few more questions now\nwe're gonna do meditation\nokay so Matt twitch user says what would\nyou say if you're lying to someone in a\nposition of power over over you who has\nsomething against you so this is in\ngeneral like I'm not I guess I'm about\nto promote Hinduism but it's not I don't\nreally I don't think it's promoting\nHinduism one of the reasons I like\nHinduism like the reason I've gained a\nlot of value out of it does not even in\nHinduism really but one of the reasons I\nlike stories like the Mahabharata is\nbecause there is this dichotomy between\nRama and Krishna that at the end of the\nday like Christian is a shady\n[ __ ] and sometimes I think the\nlesson that I learned from my mom and\nsort of reading some of these things\nfrom Hinduism these are in all religions\nand also had like secular stuff right\nlike there's wisdom all over the place\nis that there isn't like one system of\nmorality so what I like about Eastern\nreligions is that they don't sort of\nstart with this idea that there's an\nobjective right and there's an objective\nwrong in the east there's karma\nthere's just cause and effect and so if\nI throw something up in the air it's\ngonna come down and we're the ones who\nplace a value judgement about what we\nlike and what we don't like\nbut I think what I like about like this\nROM versus Christian a dichotomy and I\ntalk about this a lot with my patients\nlike who are in investment banking and\nexecutives and they're like power\nstruggles and things like that is that I\ndon't think that there is like a stock\nanswer to things and I think that there\nare like the whole point behind like\nKrishna also being called God is that he\ndid things that are super shady and I\nthink that like what the lesson that I\ntake away from that is that sometimes\nyou have to do things that are shady if\nyou want to move forward in life if you\nwant to be happy in life sometimes you\nhave to do things that are shady and\nthat if you're you're kind of like an\nopen-ended like honest like naive kind\nof guy you're gonna get screwed that's I\nthink one of the lessons that I learned\nfrom the Mahabharat okay our Hindu tales\nnot hypothetical though they're\nabsolutely hypothetical that's the whole\npoint right I mean maybe they're\nhistorically accurate I don't know\nthere's some people sort of claim that\nthis stuff is real or not real I mean I\nthink the main question is not whether\nthey're real or hypothetical the main\nquestion is what you know what do we\ntake away from them like what can you\nlearn from like reading stories and\nlistening to stories and things like\nthat how can you apply some of these\nprinciples and test them in their own in\nyour own life okay okay so too many\nquestions alright so Bulli as' well I'm\ngonna ask you guys we're gonna we're\ngonna sort of stop questions here for a\nsecond so I'm gonna ask you guys do you\nguys want to do do y'all want to do do\ny'all want to do cleaning meditation\nfirst or regular meditation first okay\nso this is so we're gonna do cleaning\nmeditation first okay so this is what I\nwant you guys to do I want you to close\nyour eyes sit up straight

it works okay support it\nactive\nyou\ngood\nokay so now we're going to yes there's a\nlong way to go so bully us or you can\nclean your room today am I gonna what\nare you gonna clean your room today sure\nwhy not\nokay good is that a lie no no sir\nsucking my through also don't die have a\nvery sensitive reflex okay okay so now\nwe're going to do another meditation\nokay bullies you can pass on this so\nwe're gonna do some ignite chakra\nmeditation because we did the third eye\nmeditation don't eat no eating\nyeah no you can't do this while you're\neating okay all right so\nthis is gonna be weird so I use my\nmiddle finger and I normally just have\nit out but I'm gonna have the thumb too\nbecause normally I don't have the thumb\nout but then I can get banned on twitch\nso what I want you guys stop eating you\ncan't do you want to okay you can't you\nhave to finish your food and then you\ncan meditate you shouldn't eat while you\nmeditate okay okay so do this alright so\nI want you to take about one centimeter\naway from the point where your where I\nbrowse me sit up straight and then I\nwant you to just hover your finger close\nyour eyes and hover your finger over the\npoint where your eyebrows me\njust focus on that part of your forehead\ndon't touch just hover it right above\nthat part\nkeep it there eyes closed\nyou\nyou\nhold the finger there no contact with\nthe skin\njust focus on the sensation\nyou\nnow relax your hand\nlet it come down continue to concentrate\non that point of your forehead\ntowards it\nand now take a deep breath in and exhale\nslowly deep breath in exhale for five\nseconds breathe in exhale for seven last\nbreath in exhale for nine now take your\npalms put your palms together in front\nof you rub your palms together feel the\nfriction the heat and cup them over your\neyes slowly open your eyes let your\npalms come down\nhow do you feel feel all right I kind of\nswitched to the ADHD one where you focus\non other noises and stuff because I was\njust like that's a good focused on I\nreally don't understand dog giving me\nplease okay sorry huh\nmy buddy kept damning me and I'm like\nstop damning you about just sending\nthing dumb stuff to me anyways what were\nyou saying yeah I'm just trying to keep\nup with twitch at I'm so some people\nyeah so this is important right so miss\ngifs gummy dealer says I feel like a\nhorn is gonna burst out of my forehead\nso this is what I want you guys to\nunderstand okay meditation is not about\nlike inner peace like sure you feel I\nknow that you guys like feel calmer and\nstuff and like that's important but the\nreason I like to meditate is because I\nreally enjoy spiritual experiences I\nlike I enjoy experiencing strange\nsensations I enjoy understanding and\nhaving experiences of like the self that\nare beyond like what happens in my mind\nand if you guys can't concentrate that's\nokay we're gonna teach you a lot of\ndifferent meditation techniques but what\nI want y'all to understand is that like\nif you feel like strange sensations and\nmeditation as long as you're not scary\nor painful or things like that continue\ndoing that practice because those\nfeelings are a sign that the meditation\nis working properly if you don't feel\nthat that's okay too this meditation\nisn't for everyone\nso bulliest defaulted to something else\nwhich is fine so we're gonna teach a lot\nof different meditation techniques the\ngoal of teaching meditation on the\nstream so you guys need to understand\nthis minds are different not everyone's\nmind is the same and the reason that\nthere are dozens or 112 different kinds\nof meditation techniques is that for\ndifferent minds a different technique is\ngoing to attain\nhelp you attain like that peaceful state\nof mind or give you give you a sense of\nyour true self for all kinds of other\nlike random you know Lululemon yoga\nhippy kind of stuff and so try the\ndifferent techniques see what works for\nyou see what doesn't and you'll know\nwhen it works you'll start to have\nyou'll start to have different\nexperiences as you do different\ntechniques and do what works and a\nbulliest yes so this is important right\nI want you guys to see what did bully us\njust do what did you do Bert\nnope before that I don't know it's like\nfocused on the tree noises outside yeah\nhe opened his window right he pulled his\nshades back why'd you do that cuz I was\ngetting warm and cuz I kind of liked the\nnoise yeah good like your room looks but\nbetter like like like your face looks\nbetter how do you feel like a little\nbetter yeah so I think when you first\ncame on you were smiling too but it was\nan embarrassed kind of smile it was like\nkind of a shot like see you just did it\nagain that was an embarrass my you're\nthere it is so that's the embarrassed\nsmile right self-conscious yeah yeah so\nbut but that's not how you felt before\nright so can you go back to that is it\nworking or hard\nwell if I'm thinking about it it's hard\ngood trying so stop thinking about it\nand do right so listen to the noises\nclose your eyes feel the wind\nfeel that feeling of embarrassment and\nthen return to the wind return to the\nsounds that you hear the sound of my\nvoice to other sounds that you hear and\nnotice that that embarrassment is\nholding on just a tiny bit which is okay\nlet it be there let the feeling be there\nright and with it parallel to it also\nwithin you notice that peacefulness\nunderstand that that embarrassment is\ngonna be there that's okay how do you\nfeel about being embarrassed like fun\nyeah that's the [ __ ] point right so\nyour embarrassment in your emotions keep\nyou from doing the things that you need\nto do so what you need to learn is how\nto be fine with it\nembarrassment restricts who you are it\nrestricts what you're able to do in life\nand when you meditate you can learn to\nsit with that feeling and be fine with\nit that's what we want right it's not to\nstop feeling it's to let your life not\nbe controlled by what you feel and now\nthat's not the smile of embarrassment\nthis is different this is a different\nsmile can you guys see that it's a\ndifferent one the embarrassment smile is\ngone and there it is it's coming back\nagain now it's back you see this is what\nwe do we turn it on and we turn it off\nthis is how you learn you learn how to\ncontrol your ability to step in and out\nof emotion and now bully a step out of\nit do you can you do it or do you need\nmy help\na little bit I mean\ngood keep your eyes closed game yeah\nyou're doing it right you feel the\nembarrassment is still there we're not\nmaking it go away this is really\nimportant because people think that you\nwant to make the emotion go away so it\ndoesn't control you anymore that's what\nI'm like bulliest thinks that as long as\nthe shame is there his behavior is going\nto be controlled he wants the shame to\ngo away no no no that's not the goal the\ngoal is to air it out let it be there\nand now the genuine smile starts to\nreturn again can you guys see like can\ny'all tell or is this like am i\nhallucinating or can twitch @ tell can\nyou guys tell the difference like can\nyou guys see the two smiles that he has\nthe smile and in the embarrassment\ncan you get embarrassed again there it\nis there it is right and now with the\ncoolest thing bulliest says you're\nstarting to be like okay with it right\nlike you could play with it are you\nplaying with it Yeah right and that's\nwhat I want you guys to do is to\nunderstand that your emotions deserve a\nseat at the table but they don't get to\nrun the show that you can be fun and\nplayful with the things that hold you\nback right like and like even shave like\nyou can sit with that you can learn to\nlike be at the table with your shame and\nnot let it control you not let it\ndominate\nand that's how you do it good job today\nBelize clean your [ __ ] room any\nquestions from you before we wrap up not\nat the moment no okay or you see you\ntold me you're gonna clean your room so\nyou're not allowed to lie okay no all\nright so I'm gonna hang up on in a\nsecond all right bro take care good luck\nokay"
