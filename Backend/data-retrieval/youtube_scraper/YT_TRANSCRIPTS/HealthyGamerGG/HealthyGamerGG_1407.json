    "transcript": "well think about when you have the flu\nwhen you have the flu what do you feel\nlike doing absolutely nothing and do you\nthink that is psychological no obviously\nit's not so why do you assume that when\nyou wake up in the morning and you don't\nfeel like doing anything why do you\nassume that is completely a\npsychological it's an incorrect\nassumption\nhow can I help a friend who went through\ntherapy and medication and find it isn't\nhelpful so okay so like you guys have to\nunderstand that you know as a friend you\nguys are not responsible like for\nsomeone else's mental health right so\nlike you shouldn't be there buckets like\nin terms of what therapy and medication\nare supposed to be helping you should\nnot like put yourself in that same\nbucket so the support that you can\nprovide a friend is the support that a\nfriend provides and shouldn't be a\nsubstitute for therapy or medication\npractically what you can try to do is\nmaybe help them find like a different\ntherapist or psychiatrist or\npsychologist so you can help them in\nterms of like you know like helping them\nfind help and being supportive and\nbaking them cookies and calling them\nwhen they're when they're feeling down\nand talking to them and hanging out with\nthem getting them out of the house\nvisiting their twitch stream and telling\nthem to meditate when they get upset\nthese are all of the things that you can\ndo which means a lot like a lot of times\nyou know when we think about when I deal\nwith people who are suicidal it's not\nlike the most common reason why someone\nwho wants to kill themselves and doesn't\nkill themselves is because of the other\npeople in their life it's because there\nare people that matter to them they\nthemselves are willing to kill\nthemselves for their own sake it's just\nthe other people in their life that are\nimportant to them that they don't want\nto hurt that keeps them struggling and\nwanting to live so that's your job right\nyour job is to be their friend your job\nis to tell them that you care them care\nabout them you tell them that you love\nthem like that's not something that\ntheir psychiatrist or therapist is gonna\ntell them I mean they can sometimes\nsometimes I say that to my patients but\nand and so like you like they're not\ntherapy and medication isn't gonna give\nyou a sense of love I mean depends on\nyeah it's not but you can so you can you\ncan be their friend you can hang out\nwith them you can like get them out of\nthe house like you guys can go workout\ntogether y'all can go meditate together\nall of those things and that's your job\nso you can't help but just don't don't\nthink that you should be a substitute\nfor therapy or medication because you're\nnot okay\nwhy does my depression get worse when I\nfind out someone who I don't know dies\nsuch as juice world today who I'm not a\nhuge fan of and a girl from my hometown\nI mean the short answer is that I don't\nknow but what I would say is that like\nmuch like Gork so if we think about\ngorks problem is like he has a certain\nbelief that's internal and when the rest\nof the world\nhops on to that belief like he's totally\nfine with it\nright like so he when when when his\ntwitch chat gets angry at him he like\nthat affects him so like it's kind of\nlike you have certain vulnerabilities\nthat the rest of the world is gonna kind\nof tap into and so I would say that in\nyour case you know you have some\nvulnerability about the world being like\nfull of you know like it's like a\nhopeless place it's not just about you\nbut that there's like sadness in the\nworld or something like that and any\ntime the world kind of corroborates that\nmessage the feelings within you return\nso I want you guys to think about\ndepression a little bit like PTSD in the\nsense that you know there's certain\nthings that trigger PTSD and there are\ncertain things that can trigger\ndepression in triggering isn't just a\npart of deep PTSD it's just a part of\nthe way that the mind works like when I\nwalk into a bathroom so I don't know if\nyou guys have ever had this happen to\nyou but when you really need to use the\nbathroom and you walk into the bathroom\nlike if you're in a public place and all\nthe stalls are occupied your need to go\nto the bathroom gets way way worse it's\nlike you could hold it in but it's the\nsecond you get into the bathroom you\nneed to like really really really go\nright so it's like your body and your\nmind are responding to the external\nworld and they're triggering you to need\nto pee so in this person's case this\nquestion is why does my depression get\nworse when I find out someone who I\ndon't know dies it's because there's\nsomething about the way that you view\nthe world or that you view other people\nthat's getting triggered by like these\nrandom deaths\nand then you get depressed so like that\nthat has more to do with the way that\nyour mind it's like a bias it's like a\nway that you look at the world so I\ndon't know where that comes from but the\nquestion is like why does it matter to\nyou you know let me think about this\nhow do I ask this yeah like what are\nyour general thoughts about the world\nhow do you find mental problems are\ncaused by physical illnesses like\ndiabetes and blood pressure okay that's\na great question\nso mental problems are not caused by\nphysical problems like diabetes and\nblood pressure well sometimes they can't\nbe but you guys have to understand that\nthe mind is connected to our body so\nthere are lots of studies that show that\nfor example when your depression gets\nworse\nthat your arthritis gets worse that when\npeople feel anxious their GI system gets\nmessed up and there are some there's a\nlot of fascinating research for example\non the gut brain access our bodies and\nour minds are connected and there are a\nlot of mechanisms through which these\nare connected so I think my favorite\nexploration of this is the field of\npsychoneuroimmunology which is the\neffect of our mind or the connection\nbetween our mind psychology our brain\nneuroscience and immune system\nimmunology psychoneuroimmunology there\nare studies that show that if you're\ndepressed for example your body's\nresponse to a vaccine is blunted\ncompared to like when you're not\ndepressed so your immune system and your\nyour mental like system are actually\nlike your mind are very closely linked\nthere are also studies that show that\npeople who are grieving are more\nsusceptible to viral illnesses so when\nyou lose a loved one your immune system\nisn't functioning the way that it used\nto so the body and mind are\nintrinsically connected I think for you\nguys the most important thing to think\nabout is circadian rhythm and cortisol\nso when your circadian rhythm is off\nyour immune system tends to get off you\ntend to get into like a pro-inflammatory\nkind of state and when you're in a\npro-inflammatory state you kind of feel\nshitty it was just like not a good word\nfor it you just feel [ __ ]\nlike your capacity to do things that you\nknow you should do just feels worse\nright and like you're like oh man like I\nshould work out but I just don't feel\nlike it\nI just don't feel like it is actually a\nvery complex physiological neuro\nscientific and psychological response\nthere are lots of things that result in\nyou feeling like doing stuff so you kind\nof say like oh I just don't feel like it\ntoday\nwell think about when you have the flu\nwhen you have the flu what do you feel\nlike doing absolutely nothing and do you\nthink that is psychological no obviously\nit's not so why do you assume that when\nyou wake up in the morning and you don't\nfeel like doing anything why do you\nassume that is completely a\npsychological it's an incorrect\nassumption if the flu can make you not\nfeel like doing stuff what other\nphysical things can make you not feel\nlike doing stuff so you should\nunderstand that if you're in a generally\npro-inflammatory state you're not gonna\nfeel like doing stuff so what can you do\nto get out of a pro-inflammatory state\nyou can do things like yoga or exercise\nyoga superior to exercise in this by the\nway but let's remember that the problem\nhere is that you can't do anything so\nyou're probably not gonna be able to do\nyoga so what you should do is eat\nanti-inflammatory foods so like\nanti-inflammatory foods are the top of\nlist berries leafy greens not iceberg\nlettuce but stuff like arugula spinach\ncruciferous vegetables broccoli\ncauliflower cruciform the vegetables\nthat look like they like bud out so all\nof those things will help sort of reduce\nyour inflammatory burden and have\nlimited evidence to improve like\ninflammatory conditions so someone is\njoking about downing a [ __ ] ton of advil\nthere's actually a study so you guys\nreally ready for research Andy so you\njest\nthis is not the paper that I'm looking\nfor I have a better one I just can't\nfind it but that's a meta-analysis it's\njust old there's a recent study I don't\nknow when there was a very good study\nthat came out within the last year\nshowing pretty good effects of using\nanti-inflammatories to treat depression\nright but absolutely so I don't think\nyou should take Advil if you're\ndepressed but it's ibuprofen um did\nstream died for a second I don't know\nokay so in your case eat cruciferous\nvegetables think a little bit about you\nknow physically what you can do if you\ndon't feel like you're like doing stuff\nand the mind and the body are\nfundamentally connected so physical\nproblems are gonna make your mental\nstate worse and mental problems are\ngonna make your physical state worse and\nthe cool thing is that since both of\nthem are connected you can do meditation\nto improve your rheumatoid arthritis you\ncan do meditation to improve your blood\npressure and you can do physical stuff\nto improve your depression you can eat\ndifferent things so that's like that's\ncool right like you don't have to\nactually just you don't have to like\ncombat you don't have to fight the\ndepression in the mental realm alone you\ncan actually just do physical stuff in\nyour depression will improve your\nanxiety will improve okay what's the\ndifference between a psychiatrist versus\npsychologists versus therapists so\npsychiatrist is a medical doctor so I\nwent to medical school and you learn\nabout the physical body so like as part\nof becoming a psychiatrist I worked in\nthe ICU of a hospital so I deal with\npeople who are like you know have septic\ninfections and have heart attacks\nstrokes you learn how to treat diabetes\nyou learn how to treat high blood\npressure you learn how to treat physical\nstuff so you're a medical doctor you\neven spent time in an operating room by\ndoing surgeries so that's a medical\ndoctor so a medical doctor who\nspecializes in the organ of the mind so\nremember that medical doctors specialize\nor many of them do right so you have\nlike pediatricians who specialize in\nkids you have obvious\nTrish ins or Gynaecologists who\nspecialized in pregnancy and female\nhealth you have surgeons who specialize\nin surgery and then you have\npsychiatrists who are doctors who\nspecialize in the mind a psychologist is\nsomeone who studies the mind exclusively\nand the training for psychologists\noftentimes have a lot more research\ninvolved so they learn a lot more about\nscience and research methodology\nmethodologies at least in the u.s.\nbecause it's a it's a Doctor of\nPhilosophy usually so it's a PhD and\nthat's like a research degree\nfundamentally you can get a PhD in\npsychology or you can get a PhD in like\nelectrical engineering or computer\nscience so it's an academic degree that\nwith a particular focus in the mind so a\ntherapist can be at least in the United\nStates can be many things so a\npsychiatrist can be if they're their\nepistle does therapy or presumably\npsychotherapy because you also have\nphysical therapists right so a therapist\nis someone who does something called\nlike psychotherapy usually they're like\na counselor or a therapist and they can\nhave a variety of physical training\nbackground so a social worker in the\nUnited States can be a therapist a\npsychologist can be a therapist and a\npsychiatrist can be a therapist the\ndifference is that their training is\ndifferent so as a psychiatrist I trained\nI went to four years of medical school\nand then four years of psychiatry\ntraining a psychologist usually trains\nfor between five and seven years with\nlike a one-year postdoc it depends on\nhow much research that they do and a\nsocial worker trains for like two years\nin the United States so their training\nlevels are gonna be different their\nbackgrounds are gonna be different you\nknow I like I attest can prescribe\nmedications most of the time\npsychologists cannot because medications\nare like a physical substance that you\nput in your body and may interfere with\nother medications so that's the\ndifference\nokay so what exactly I see a couple\nquestions about procrastination quick\nquestion how often do you plan to do\nretreats and will you do retreats\noutside the US how often do I plan to do\nretreats I don't know we've had one\nretreat that sort of happened like last\nminute I was just like hey we should\nhave a retreat and our community was\npretty small then it was like maybe a\nhundred people or 150 and about a dozen\npeople showed up and it was great\nlike we had a about 12 to 15 people who\nregularly showed up on our discourse for\nlike like group like we would work\nthrough stuff together and so like half\nof them came to the retreat and so our\nreally our active community was like 15\npeople when are we gonna do another\nretreat as soon as possible and what we\ndo retreats outside the US I certainly\nhope so so all that stuff takes like\nmoney and funding in time so I can pay\nfor you know one retreat a year like out\nof my own pocket but as we make money on\nstream and as you guys like sob and all\nthat kind of stuff like that that's all\ngonna go to the retreat fund and we're\nprobably gonna do another retreat in the\nUS but it sounds like we need to do a\nretreat somewhere and like Northern\nEurope or Scandinavia because half the\npeople on stream are from like the\nNetherlands or like Denmark or whatever\nlike Finland like so yes send us your\nAmazon Prime subs so we yeah we want to\ndo more retreats for sure so I just\nalready I'm thinking if we do want to\ninternationally it's probably gonna be\nsomewhere in Europe okay so there's\nsomething about expectations\nprocrastination commitment long term so\nthis is a question that I get all the\ntime on stream what are your thoughts on\nusing hallucinogenic drugs to treat\nmental illnesses so I think that there's\npreliminary evidence that is promising\nthat some substances when used in a\ncontrolled fashion can be therapeutic\nbut don't take like I don't think people\nshould just start doing LSD or MDMA like\njust because some studies show some\npromising stuff like these are very\nsmall studies like 20 people 50 people\nand I think it's like you know if the\nevidence supports that I'm open to it\nbut I think that it's too preliminary to\nreally tell what's what's good or what's\nsafe or what's reliable okay oh this is\na cool question I like this question\nokay with ADHD you committing long term\nokay what do I think about gene site\nthat's a very specific question so let\nme just ask this one then we're gonna\nswitch to meditation okay so last mental\nhealth question let me just scan real\nquick actually there's a quick question\ncan you make the stream more EU friendly\nit's pretty late and I don't want to\nmiss it yeah so like I think we stream\nfrom 3 to 5 Eastern which i think is\nlike 9 to 11 in some parts of Europe and\nI will do my best to make the stream as\nEU friendly as possible but I have a job\nand have two kids and things like that\nso like there's some you know restraints\non my time yeah I know 3 a.m. like where\nyou guys are in in Europe right now but\nwe have a stream that normally starts\nfive hours before now so 2 a.m. means\nthat it'll be like 9 p.m. your time\nright so and I'll try to scream earlier\nin the day like I'll keep that in mind"
