    "transcript": "do you think that narcissists believe\nthat and I'm I don't I don't know if\nyou're a narcissist or not so this isn't\nsome kind of veiled attack I'm genuinely\ncurious because I have a follow-up\nquestion do you think that narcissists\nbelieve that they are that they have\nthat they're objectively better in some\nways than other people\nhey man how are you can you can you hear\nme yeah thank you for being so patient\nI'm sorry about the guys it's fine if\nyou can have people I don't mind yeah\nalso what I want to say do you hear echo\nwhen you're talking I I don't hear echo\nokay that's good that's good that's good\nawesome okay and and just volume wise\nwhat we're doing okay yeah yeah I'm\nhearing you clear clear okay let me just\num all right so I think can you tell me\na little bit about what so I'm not quite\nsure exactly how this got set up but\nthere were people in in my chat who\nwanted me to talk to you yeah cuz I have\nquite a controversial reputation on the\ninternet and people love to see drama\nso they'd love to see you know like I\ntalk a lot about you know being\nresponsible and stuff on the live stream\nand I've you even run my own place and\nsuch and I can say things that sometimes\nare very confrontational and I got\nmyself a little bit of a cult guru\nreputation and that's why they they like\nthe idea of you know me talking to you\nbecause some for for the drama sake some\nto see if there's something interest\ninteresting that comes out of it\neverybody has their a little bit their\nown motivation what are you like to get\nout of it like for me the the reason why\nI think it's a I didn't mind having a\nchat because I can potentially learn\nfrom you and you can potentially learn\nfrom me and if our intent is to help out\nother people this conversation could\nprove to be very fruitful that's one one\naspect of it the other aspect is also\nthat even if that is not what it leads\nto people will get a better idea new\nabout you know how I think and how I see\nthings and how you think and how you see\nthings and either way uh I I do think\nthat the outcome will be positive either\nway so sure my goal\nwith this talk is not to to country\ncreate controversy or drama I I checked\na bit a few of your streams and well\nlike I just skipped through it and I I\nchecked I saw your Dharma approach like\nthe the Dharma AoE and I looked a bit\ninto it and like being responsible and\nquite action-oriented I I really like\nthat sure it's it's the it's the you\nknow it's the direction I steer people\ninto as well so you're like why are you\ndoing all of this why am i why do i\nstream why do you you know yeah why do\nyou stream why do you because I also\nknow you have a website healthy gamers\nyeah like what what is the yeah what is\nit for you what is your intent what is\nyour true motivation for what you're\ndoing so my motivation is Dharma so I\nbelieve that doing this is my duty or\nresponsibility and what I mean by that\nin a much more so that sounds like kind\nof fancy but I think in a simple sense\nI've had a very unique a couple of very\nunique opportunities in my life so I was\naddicted to video games slash almost\nfailed out of college from playing too\nmany video games and then studied for\nseveral years to become a monk and then\nended up becoming a psychiatrist and in\nin the process of training to become a\npsychiatrist I started asking a lot of\nmy professors and supervisors about\nvideo game addiction and then really no\none knew anything because it's a\nrelatively new phenomenon I think\ntechnology and social media and the way\nthat they affect minds and brains is\nlike people just don't understand that\nit's a really no one knew much about it\nso about five years ago I just started\nasking gamers like you know why do you\nplay video games do you want to play\nfewer video games and why can't you stop\nand the more that I've worked with\ngamers so I you know sort of started\nstreaming actually only three months ago\nand having worked with people for about\nfive years now I realized that like\na lot of people have the same problems\nso that I was essentially having the\nsame conversations with like dozens or\nhundreds of people and realized that\nbasically we need to AoE this stuff\nright so instead of having and that I\ncould I couldn't get to everyone so\nabout one year ago a little over a year\nago I posted an an AMA threat on Reddit\nand just said I'm a psychiatrist who's\ninterested in video game addiction and\ngot thousands of messages people were\nlike paging me at the hospital and stuff\nlike that\nI got calls from all over the world\nactually for parents and people who were\nstruggling it didn't didn't know how to\nget help and so I realized that like I\ncan't you know I can be a psychiatrist\nand work in my office and see 40\npatients a week and I will never it'll\nnever be enough and so I need to change\nso if I get it right you you actually\nwant to help people in in the most\neffective manner you can what do you\nmean by elective like to give a\ncomparison rather than having 40\npatients\nyou'd rather like reach thousands if\nyeah because because no one else is\nright so if someone else is doing it\nthen that's fine but right now like the\noverwhelming message that I get is that\ngamers who go and see a psychiatrist get\ndiagnosed with depression get started on\nmedication and then six months later\ntheir life is exactly the same and and\nwhy why why do you what why is it\nsomething that you know because I'm just\ntrying to to understand the motive and\nthe drive and such right like why do you\nwant to reach many instead of just 40\nbecause many reach out to me is it\nbecause of the reach out to something so\nlike so that's good so the reason I\nasked about effectiveness is because I\nsee a big difference between public\nhealth and clinical medicine so there\nare some interventions that we do that\neffect of population but don't affect\nthe population as profoundly as an\nindividual so what I enjoy doing the\nmost is working with individuals I\nactually think that's the most effective\nthat in order for me to help someone if\nI get one hour a week with them for like\nsix months that person is like different\nat the end of that and one of the\nstruggles that I have with doing this is\nthat I meet with people once and we sort\nof really try to make things like super\ncross-sectional and I are trying to help\nthem out a little bit but I don't know\nif this is actually helping people what\nyou're doing right now yeah by talking\nto all these people on the UM on line I\nmean people say it's helping right so\nthe last interview the last survey see\nwho is helping this part of the equation\nyou you really want to help people yeah\nand you want you want to be able to help\nas much as you can yeah why because I\ncan so let me put it to you this way so\nI think Dharma is so Dharma is related\nto karma so karma is sort of like the\nidea of like circumstance right so like\nthis so I think that I've been given a\nrelatively unique background and so that\ncomes with a certain obligation so let\nme put it to you this way\nlet's say that the two of us are sitting\nat a park bench and I have two\nsandwiches and you have none and both of\nus are hungry I believe that I should\ngive you a sandwich just because I have\ntwo and you have none that there's just\nsort of a karmic setup there that like\nif I'm able to do something like who\nelse is gonna do it because the really\nscary\nyeah can I give it can I give another\nexample sure because I like the\napartment let's say you're on the park\nbench and you have two sandwiches right\nand the person next to you didn't eat\nall day right and the person on the\nother side of the the park hasn't eaten\nfor a week\nor a month would you give the sandwich\nto\nI don't understand how that analogy\nrelates to our situation here well like\nfor me because when the when the core is\nhelping people you try to help people\nwhere the needs is the biggest and I'm\njust trying to use your support I think\nI should be doing instead\nwell I just want to understand the true\nintent and motivation of why you're\nhelping people because that would give\nthe answer to whether it even what what\nwhether it's even relevant if something\nelse would be better because what would\nhave what I've realized and and\nexperienced myself in my life is a lot\nof the time when people are doing good\nit's within their comfort and when it\nwhen it requires them to go outside\ntheir comfort they start rationalizing\nwhy they shouldn't be doing this so they\nshouldn't be doing that and and then\neven mentioning what they could be doing\nbetter just causes conflict and has very\nlittle purpose like for me my goal is\nnot to pinpoint the inconsistencies my\nwhat I just try to understand is what\nthe intent is because if the intent is\nreally pure and and really like yeah I\nwant to help people where the need is\nthe biggest and and I am very you know\nalmost about it towards myself and I\nwould even go out of my comfort zone\nbecause like for example the two\nsandwiches if you're really hungry you\ncould eat them both you go out of your\ncomfort zone giving a sandwich to the\nperson next to you but how far would you\ngo would you would you give it to two\nstarving people next to you and not eat\nthe sandwich help me understand why it\nis it is help me understand why you want\nto understand my motivations and\nspecifically it sounds like you're\ntrying to figure out do I fall into the\ncamp of helping people within my comfort\nzone or helping people outside of my\ncomfort zone that seems to be what\nyou're asking about or to which extent\nwould you go out of your comfort zone in\norder to to basically follow the the\nDharma ideology yeah so yeah why do you\nthink you're so you're curious about\nthat right you're curious about me\nand to what degree I will step outside\nof my comfort zone to help people well\nyeah like it would be it's it's very\ninteresting to know yet to know these\nthings because what I yeah yeah so\npeople people are curious about all\nkinds of things right like some people\nare curious about what kind of product I\nput in my hair\nsome people are curious about yeah but I\nmean I'm curious about this is because\nit's very functional\nit's like if you can find common what I\nmean like what what I mean with that is\nif you can find a common shared\nfoundation then you can potentially get\na lot more of the relationship than just\nthis talk for example like if you share\nyou're looking for commonality between\nme and you\nbecause now I can play now thank you I\ncompletely agree with because I think\nthat's what you're looking for too\nso I that's a new line more than\ncommonality with you and me I would say\ncommonality with are you comparing us\nno like that's that's exactly what I'm\ntrying to get to for me it's not about\ncomparing to what I do because that's\nthat's not so relevant to me it's about\nunderstanding your connection to giving\nback to the world basically and how\nstrong that is and so is it how you\nisn't that like the central part of I\nmean just based on what you've said so\nfar I guess that that is a very central\npart of who you are\nis that you are someone who gives back\nto the world and I mean I don't really\nknow much but that I would guess that\nyou step outside of comfort zones that\nmany other people would not well the\nthing is like for me rather than saying\nthis is how I am or whatever like I\ndon't really have an identity about it I\njust got to do what I got to do it's\nlike water that flows down a mountain\nwhy does it flow down a mountain it's\njust because it follows the path of what\nit is and and I think if you come to a\ncertain awareness of us what is so let\nme ask you what is the how does the\nwater flow down the mountain in terms of\nthis example of like me sitting with a\nguy next to me and then a guy across the\npark who hasn't eaten for a week where\nhas water flow there well the the thing\nis like if you if you grow up right and\ndepending on how you've been conditioned\nand such you are you are very wired to\nfollow how you feel yeah\nrather and do what feels right rather\nthan what is right Dan so but but and\nthen your water will flow differently\nthen if you go about it in a more\nanalytical manner where you just see the\nimpact for what it is and base your\nactions on that even if it doesn't\nalways feel as as as as good and that's\nthe thing that's how you achieve very\nbig impact by by by playing the number\nbecame more so than playing the the\nempathy game and that's why okay so help\nme understand something a theme so you\nwere saying earlier that you don't\nreally think about this stuff as your\nidentity you don't really think about\nwhether you step out of your comfort\nzone that you are essentially like like\nyou have water that flows downhill and\nso you have some sort of intrinsic\narrived to do something and you kind of\ndon't question it you just do it it's\nnot you it's just a natural process well\nlet me let me bounce back the question\ndo I have a drive to breed\nyes\nokay so like there is an actual active\nprocess in my brain going on where I say\nand mind myself to breathe\nyes maybe we're maybe we're\nmiscommunicating well no so yeah you\nabsolutely have parts of your brain that\nmeasure your co2 levels and Oh two\nlevels you know that's not it's not part\nof my awareness it's it's not part of my\nactive awareness it's not like but let\nme give another example do do do I have\nthe drive for my blood cells to - you\nknow heimeau go hemoglobin to absorb\noxygen from the air and distribute it to\nmy organs do I have a drive to do that\nno no well just by drive you buy drive\nyou're defining that is like an\nawareness or a motivation to consciously\ndo that\nwhy do you drive so yeah that that's\nwhat what I'm trying to get to is trying\nto figure out a common ground because to\nmake sure we understand the same\nlanguage so for me like it's more a\nstate of being rather than a drive it's\nlike I just wake up and I do what I\ngotta do and and that's as simple as it\nis there is you know so that's on one\nend of the spectrum and being analytical\nis on the other end of the spectrum well\nbut the thing is though like being\nanalytical is part of just doing what I\ngot to do because it's like you know a\ncomputer that that processes you know a\nlot of data it's also just doing what it\nhas to do and it's analyzing numbers\nlike crazy as well like like I just want\nto make sure that you understand what\nwhat I mean like it's just a state ID\nyeah I don't understand what what you\nmean I think but that's what I'm trying\nto explain it\nthat's why I explain it like I think it\nwould be helpful so generally speaking\nin my experience so you let me know if\nyour experience is different yeah when\nI'm communicating with someone who\ndoesn't understand what I mean and they\nask a question I find that instead of\ngiving them an explanation or asking\nthem a completely separate question I\nfind that like if someone asks me a\nquestion if I'm if my goal is\nunderstanding I just answer it right if\nsomeone asks me like oh look what are\nyou put in your hair instead of talking\nabout hemoglobin or red blood cells or\nusing an analogy I just answer the\nquestion that they ask so like in\ncommunication what is what is crucial is\nfor the other person to understand what\nyou mean because else you're just\nexplaining something based on your own\nexperience and how you grew up and maybe\nthe person won't even understand what\nyou're trying to explain so that's why\nfor me it's very important to define\ncertain concepts in a way that you\nunderstand them the way I'm trying to\nexplain them because maybe I'm using\nwords in a different way than you are or\nhave a different meaning in a result we\nwish are so so I I completely agree that\nsometimes there's confusion about\nterminology and that it's important to\nlike iron out those details but what\nI'm really curious about us sometimes I\nask you a question and instead of just\nanswering the question and then us going\nfrom there because maybe I understand\nwhat you mean maybe I don't so usually\nwhen someone answers a question what I\ntry to do is repeat back what I\nunderstood and then give them a chance\nto clarify but what I'm noticing that\nyou're doing is when I ask a question\nyou sort of ask me a question or talk\nabout some sort of analogy like do you\nsee how that's the pattern of our\ncommunication it's because I I go within\nthe concepts you use if you talk about\ndrive I dive deeper into the word and\nwhat it actually means to me which gives\nit a much a much more accurate answer\nthan one where I would just answer more\nsuperficially in a way that you know\nthat that's so accurate for who jaime\naccra so when you give additional\ninformation well it gives it who does\nthat who does that make things more\naccurate for yourself or for me well it\nwould give you a better understanding in\nwhat I mean with Drive and how it\nrelates to but I think why don't you\nrely on me to ask the questions about\nthe things that I don't understand\ninstead of presuming what I do or don't\nunderstand and that's like telling me\nrandom stuff huh because you might jump\nto conclusions based on the answers I\ngive absolutely man absolutely I\ncompletely agree with you so when I jump\nto a conclusion I think it would be\nawesome if you point that out to me yes\nand that's what I'm and what I think\nwould also be awesome is if I ask you a\nquestion if instead of like talking\nabout some sort of foundational analogy\nyou answer the question and then you see\nif I jump to a conclusion like if I ask\nyou is 2+2 4 and then your answer is\nlike well let's start talking about\nmathematics and then you start talking\nabout mathematics to make sure we're all\non the same page but if I ask you is 2+2\n4 and then you say yes and then I'm like\nok great we all agree that 2+2 is 4 we\ndon't\nhave to go into the background but even\nthere when you say is 2+2 4 even though\nthat is you know accurate in within\nuncertain framework\nyou could argue in certain frameworks\n2+2 is not equal for sure you could\nargue anything with anyone I know which\nis what we're doing apparently that is\nbut that is why what I always try to do\nis to avoid ok so I think are you\nwilling to answer questions in a way\nthat may I may find helpful or do you\nwant to answer questions in the way that\nyou think will best help me understand\nlike are we going to rely on my judgment\nto help me like like if I ask you a\nquestion about your preferences or your\nbeliefs do you think it like it's really\nimportant for you to lay that foundation\nor is it possible for you to just answer\na question and then correct me if I'm\nwrong that that's the thing if you if\nyou get to understand like how I see\nthings\nthen a lot of these questions become\nirrelevant like for example believes if\nyou ask me what do you believe in like\nit's it's very irrelevant to me because\nto me I just look at reality and that's\nit and things are the way they are and I\naccept them my beliefs and even my\nfeelings are merely tools for life to to\nto to thrive and to align with reality\nnothing more nothing less\nso I don't have an attachment to it if\nif I believe a certain thing it's merely\na tool to to to to be more aligned but\nif tomorrow I get confronted otherwise I\nchange that belief\nit's very moldable it's adaptable and\nthat's the thing like when when when\nwhen certain value is being given on\ncertain concepts I bring up people and\nmaybe also perhaps you might get the\nwrong idea\nand that's why I'm trying to explain\nlike yeah I just I just do what I got to\ndo and here's what I'm here's what I'm\nhearing from you a theme you're very\nconcerned about people getting the wrong\nidea and it's very important for you\nthat they appropriately understand you\nyou know I don't find it important like\nbut that is acceptances stop stop for a\nsecond this whole conversation is about\nme asking you a question and then you\ntaking a painstaking\nand deliberate approach to making sure\nthat I don't jump to conclusions correct\nlike that's exactly what you've been\nsaying more so easy for you to\nunderstand what I ABS so then I just\nasked you a question it seems very\nimportant that you are not misunderstood\nthat other people understand what you're\ntrying to say and don't misrepresent\nyour beliefs that is what I'm asking if\nI value if you if you value\nunderstanding Mead and I deem to show\nthe respect to explain things the way I\nwould explain it to myself so if if I\nwas use not a yes I'm confused\nso it's my impression that you were it's\nvery important to you that I understand\nthings and I don't jump to conclusions\nand that you want to explain things to\nme in a way where like I understand your\nfoundation I understand your logic I\nunderstand where you start from I\nunderstand your foundational beliefs so\nthat I can understand what you're saying\nthat's what you're trying to do right\nlike I ask you a question instead of\nanswering the question you make sure you\nlay the foundation so there's no\nmisunderstanding between us that's what\nwe're doing here right if that is the\nthe is if that is what you value within\nthe conversation to understand me then\nthen yes I want to make sure that I\nexplain but I'm not I'm asking you what\nyou value in a conversation because I'm\nasking you a question and based on your\nresponse okay it's not like that what I\nvalue what I value in a conversation is\nfor the conversation to lead to positive\nresults\nokay so what I'm getting from you so I\nunderstand that that sounds like sort of\nan abstract answer but based on the way\nin which you're answering my questions I\nthink you are very concerned about being\nlet me finish I think about being\nmisunderstood and I also think that you\nare not comfortable with the idea that\nyou're concerned about that that if I\ntell you that you're concerned about\nthat that you're going to respond with\nsomething telling me how you're not\nconcerned about that because you're like\nwater that flows down hills and water\ndoesn't concern about anything you know\nI'm not saying I'm not saying that I\ndon't have emotions I have emotions but\nI don't I just don't value them like I\ncould without that I completely\nunderstand that so so like I just said\nlike you're not gonna be you're not\ngonna you're not gonna believe or value\nthe fact that you are concerned about\nbeing misunderstood but the thing is\nthough like I I don't really I don't\nreally mind whether I'm being\nmisunderstood or not like for me I just\nwant to understand that once we are on\nthe same page that's all yeah right so\nso like that's exactly what I just said\nright like you are not going to accept\nor agree to the fact that you are\nconcerned about being misunderstood and\nyou just said that well whereas I don't\nthink I don't experience any concern of\nbeing misunderstood like I believe that\nI understand I don't think you\nexperience the concern what I'm saying\nis that if you analyze our conversation\nyou have a very very important goal in\nthe conversation to not be misunderstood\nand since you devalue emotions I'm sure\nyou experience them wait wait wait or\nwhat our value is that we have proper\ncommunication\nyeah so that when you ask me a question\nthat I give you a nice you know a nice\noverview so you have a good good good\nview in what I mean and absent and what\nI'm trying absolutely like that that's\nwhat I can I try to rephrase that to you\nso what you value in a conversation is\nto be understood that's what you just\nsaid right well what I value in a\nconversation is that it has positive\nresults being understood or not is just\na tool in order to get positive results\nfor me if I know we're on the same page\nthen understanding each other is by far\nthe most effective approach in order to\nhave the best positive results but if\nwe're not on the same page then\ncommunication is merely a tool for both\nof us to achieve the goal while we have\nthe conversation to begin with are\neither this understood I think say what\nare you misunderstood when in general\nnow in general well people call me a\ncult leader and stuff like I don't even\nlike it yeah yeah people yeah I would\nsay lack of understanding yes a lot of\nis a very bit of lack of understanding\nbut by by bigger than that like on the\nInternet\nI mean like what's that like for you\nwell I focus on the people that I can\nwork with to to have an impact in the\nworld because I mean I try and I'm not\nbusy with with like like if if there's a\nlot of misery in the world right to put\nit I like to use analogies because it's\nit makes things very simple to\nunderstand like if they're also missing\nin the world yeah that for me you know\nthe other thing that analogies do a\ntheme is they separate us from the\nequation right they become abstract and\nit no longer becomes personal when you\nuse an analogy\nand it allows you to to have a better\nyou know analytical view on the on the\nproblem and make better decisions\nabsolutely so I think well III think it\nallows you to have a more analytical\nview because when you use an analogy you\nremove yourself from the equation right\nyou're not talking about you anymore\nyou're talking about a third party well\nso it sort of makes sense my\nconversation where yeah in a\nconversation where you talk to thousands\nof people it's very effective to do so\nbecause if I talk more about about my\nown personal experience it might be a\nlittle bit you know it might be\nalienating for some people while if I\nuse certain analogies where people can\nhave an easier time to relate with I can\nresonate with more people I think you\nknow what I think would be awesome like\nI would love it if you could do me a\nfavor I want you to just tell like don't\ntalk about analogies like what I am\ncurious about what I would like to\nunderstand is not analogies but is you\nand if you're concerned about alienating\nme like as I know you're not concerned\nabout being misunderstood because you've\nmade that very very clear that you're\nnot concerned about being misunderstood\nbut that sometimes there's a chance that\nyou alienate people when you answer\nquestions about yourself I'm okay with\nthat\nlike I would love it if you could put\nfaith in me and understand that like\neven if you talk about yourself that\nlike I'm not gonna be alienated or if I\ndo feel alienated I'll let you know and\nthen you can set me straight so you're\ntelling me I can trust you I'm asking\nyou to trust me I'm asking you to not\nworry about alienating me and tell me\nabout yourself because that's what I'm\ncurious so like why are you curious\nabout myself\nbecause you're here like I'd like to\nunderstand you that's that's what I'm\nthat's what I that's what I scream for\nto talk to and uhm\ndo you truly want to understand me I\nthink so\nwell that that question implies that\nthere may be some up part of the\nunderstand like so that's just a weird\nquestion do I truly want to understand\nyou that it's not working because\nbecause if how would I know the\ndifference between wanting to understand\nyou and truly wanting to understand you\nI think I I think that if your true\nintent is to understand me rather than\nunderstanding wanting to understand me\nfor another you know separate goal the\nthe intent for which you are trying to\nunderstand me will highly define the way\nyou go about it like seeking first to\nunderstand and putting yourself in other\npeople's shoes to truly see the world\nthrough their eyes and try to understand\nit has always you know has a reason\nbehind it yeah me because you want to\nachieve something yourself and depending\non what your own goal is your own motive\nis you will this process of trying to\nunderstand me will be different like it\nmight it might suit can I jump in I know\nyou're on a roll but so like I\ncompletely agree with you so like I just\nwant to point out what I think just\nhappened there so you asked me do you\ntruly want to understand me I expressed\nconfusion about something your question\nand then you provided an explanation and\nnow I understand what you mean and my\nconfusion is gone and I do truly want to\nunderstand you okay and then let me tell\nyou my true motivation from that\nconversation is to see or to understand\nif\nwe both are on the same page in terms of\ntruly wanting to help people because if\nyou want to help people and I want to\nhelp people and we are truly you know\nlike like like going about it in the\nmost effective manner and wanted to do\nit\nreally because it's just the right thing\nto do and we are responsible to do so\nthen then then then just a conversation\nis not the only you know we can do a lot\nmore than just having a conversation we\ncan literally you know collaborate and\nand work together not saying that that's\ngoing to happen I'm just saying like\nwhat I realize is when it comes down to\nlike-minded people that truly want to\ngive back to the world organizing\nyourself and working together allows you\nto elevate your impact drastically so\nthat is you know why for me like\ninitially that's what I'm trying to\nunderstand your intent you're like like\ndo you go about it in a scientific way\nhelping people is everybody equal do you\nsee people you know like in you know\nthat are starving as equal as gamers\nlike do you see every human as equal so\nwhere do you put your resources where do\nyou put your energy go do you go about\nit very scientifically and go like okay\nif I can help so many people there that\nis more important than you know this or\nthat like that is what I want to try\nunderstand and if that is not the case\nwhich which I'm fine with\nthen it's about then then the\nconversation becomes more about like ah\nwhat is your true intent and how do you\nyou know how do you how do you find a\nrelationship with yourself when you know\nthat truly helping people is not part of\nthe equation but rather it's a mean\nwithin your comfort that is that is the\nyou know that is basically the sequence\nof my my true intent of this\nconversation so if you truly want to\nunderstand me that is what I would like\nto know so and and if you have questions\nin that context great but I would also\nlike to know your side of these things\nsure where you so first of all Athena I\nwant to start by expressing gratitude\nso I am so grateful that you instead of\nusing analogies instead of asking me\nquestions that you just shared a\nperspective about yourself right like\nyou just talked about why you're coming\non stream and why we're having this\nconversation what your motivations are\nthat I I'm really grateful for because\nthat helps me instead of like asking\nlike talking about abstract concepts it\nsounds like you're here because you're\nyou're wondering like where I'm coming\nfrom whether are our goals are aligned\nand whether there's an opportunity for\ncollaboration and if I our vision is not\naligned if I have not met some standard\nthat you're that you have for yourself\nor that some that's get simplified like\nthat sure yes yeah I'm just it's fuzzy\nthen then you maybe you're curious about\nif I'm not like you then like what am I\nlike and why am I like that way yes yes\nyeah exactly\nthat yeah that is really yes I I think\nthis this works way better when we stop\nusing analogies and we actually just\nlike start talking to each other and\nmaking sure if we're on the same page\nright yes okay so thank you for doing\nthat that that style of communication\nhelps me way more so I mean so can I\ntell you why I why I'm here to have this\nconversation yeah okay I would love to\nyeah so um I'm just here to talk to\npeople because you know you kind of talk\nabout like whether I'm in it to help\npeople and and whether I sort of know\nwhether I'm analytical and and do I want\nto distribute resources in a fair way\nand things like that I mean I think the\nshort answer is yes but I'm not very\nconfident so I think that I am a human\nbeing and I'm prone to bias and although\nI'm a smart guy and I'm an analytical\nguy and I've trained for years and\nformal systems to understand things like\nbias and emotions and the origins of\ndesires and things like that as well as\nstudying neuroscience and psychology and\npsychiatry then at the end of the day\nI'm like sort of a flawed instrument\nbecause that's what humans are that\nhumans are not really logical creatures\nthat like we have a lot of other things\nthat drive our behavior so I'm here to\ndo the best that I can but I'm guessing\nthat your commitment is way higher than\nmine so I also\ntend to be like somewhat of a really\nlike balanced guy in life in terms of\nlike I and I I don't nothin nothing\nabout your so I apologize if this is\nbeing judgmental but I enjoy playing\nvideo games I understand you do too so\nmaybe we're not that different but that\nyou know I I mean I basically wake up\nand I try to help who I can in the way\nthat I can until I'm done helping people\nand I need some time to recuperate or\nregenerate and then I sort of like will\ngo home and I'll do like you know simple\nthings and be a regular human and then I\ncome back three times a week to hop on\nstream and I try to help whoever the\nuniverse puts in front of me and by the\nuniverse I mean dank Moses who sets up\nwho comes on here so so and so I don't\nlike that is does that fit it that's it\nthat's what I'm about it's it's it's a\nit's an answer that gives me an answer\nto the question like yeah because like\nthe way I go about it I I take it I take\nthat my commitment a lot further and it\nmight be connected with confidence\nbecause you you initiate it your\nresponse by saying you're not that\nconfident because you have your own\nflaws and I do know we all have our own\nflaws but the beauty about humans is the\nability to learn from our flaws and and\nimprove it and and not to settle with\nour flaws and it's right try to do\nbetter and better I can bring the\nimpression that I'm not confident it's\nwhat you said you started your answer by\nsaying like yeah so I'm asking you so\nyour impression of me would you say that\nI come across as lacking and I think I\nthink my impression of you is is\nactually irrelevant if I trust what you\nsay because if you say you're not\nconfident because of the human flaws\nthen I just accept that because you come\nacross a confidence but it's not about\nhow you come across\nwhat you are is defined by what you are\nand my my impression of you does not\nhave to align with with the facts of\nwhat you actually are therefore I always\nquestion my impression like and I just I\ngive you the benefit of the doubt and\nwhat you say I just assumed to be true\nunless there's an inconsistency yeah so\nI wouldn't say that I'm not confident\nand in fact I feel pretty confident I\nwould say that I just acknowledged that\nI have flaws and that I'm not perfect\nand that there's a big difference I\nwould actually say that my confidence\nstems from understanding that I have\nlimitations so I used to have way less\nconfidence when I thought I was the best\nthing since sliced bread as I've gained\nexperience and studied a lot of\ndifferent disciplines and worked a lot\nwith different people I I've developed a\nlot of confidence out of understanding\nthat I'm limited and that I make\nmistakes and do you do you see these\nmistakes and do these limitations as a\nstrength to do better or as a weakness\nof a human being\nah both probably more of the four more\nas a strength so I think that I tend to\nlearn from my mistakes and that you\nshould learn from your mistakes and I\nthink that no matter how many mistakes I\nlearn from I'm gonna continue making\nmistakes buddy but the beauty is that as\nyou keep learning from your mistakes\neven though you still make mistakes they\nwill be you know they will be from a\ndifferent type and won't be always the\nsame as the previous once you've made so\nfor example if yes so so we're talking\nabstractly again right what you see that\nis abstractly because this is really\nabout you yeah but you're about to say\nfor example and then you were about to\nuse an analogy so I just jumped in there\noh I wanted to give you as an example\nfor example you playing video games and\nbeing addicted to it and learning from\nit okay apologies for interrupting you\nno it's fine has put you in a position\nwhere where you were you now helping\nother gamers with similar issues so that\nyeah that that in a sense that mistake\nhas has made you come out stronger and\nabsolutely you and and what I would I\nwould go even a step further and say\nthat any type of you know like anywhere\nwhere you can improve even in in\nin the more comfortable comfortable area\nof your life even there you can you can\npush further further and and do even\nmore good that's that's all I'm trying\nto to point because for me I truly see\nmyself as the same as you as the same as\neveryone we're all equal like I I do I\ndo think we're all equal in our\nenvironment and how we grow up for a big\npart shapes us we're where we where we\nend up and and how we see things but\nfundamentally our essence is is the same\nand we we all just want to align with\nreality in and we're all just life and\nthat's it and and basically like our\nability to you know understand these\nmechanics and understand how it works\nallows us to just you know be a better\nversion of ourselves and there is no\nreason to act it at a certain point when\nyou feel comfortable say are here is the\nline and this is where I stop and that\nis why I just you know when you wear\nearlier saying like oh yeah maybe have a\ndifferent way of going about life and\nstuff or maybe it's it's it's it's\nhigher or well it didn't use the word\nhigher but it was in that direction I\ndon't see myself as I live my life at a\nhigher moral level or whatever I just\nsee I just try to be consistent and\ntruthful to myself and I and I and I and\nI you know I put the bar where reality\nis and and and when I see how people are\nstarving and stuff it really you know it\nputs the bar quite high because I'm\nliving a very very comfortable life\ncompared to that and even if people feel\nlike I'm sacrificing a lot or even if\nthey feel like whoa you really go out of\nyour comfort zone because even when it\ncomes down to games I only play games as\nfunction to reach people and and if it\ndoesn't suit the purpose to have an\nimpact I just don't do it because it's a\nwaste of my time like for example right\nand and and I'm very functional I and\nI've raised more I think they just jump\nin for a second\nare you sure so you've just but you've\nbeen like talking for a little while and\nI just want to pause for a second\njust process what you've said can I ask\nyou a couple of questions yes of course\nokay um I just I just found my my\nattention waning a little bit and I was\nhaving trouble following you so it helps\nme to sort of just pause and make sure i\nSPECT that because that is try to\nactually listen which yeah III because\nyou said a couple of things that I was\nreally curious about and I think I'd\nlike to understand those better before\nyou keep going so that if we do have\nsort of a common foundation so you said\nthat you set the bar where reality is\nyes do you think that that is different\nfrom what other people do that's a good\nquestion because I would say other\npeople always set the bar where the\nreality is and that's just how it is but\nthe thing is people's reality can be you\nknow can be very narrow can be very\nsmall can we just do you know they're\nfamily and that's it while the reality\nthat I live in is is is the planet like\nI really see and look at the issues all\naround the world and and these issues\nwhen they're not in people's awareness\nbecause they're not busy with it then\nit's not part of their reality and even\ntheir actual reality it doesn't exist\nit's only you know it's only when they\nsee it on the news or whatever that they\nget confronted by it same with like for\nexample I'll give you another example\nlike the meat industry like people when\nthey just buy it buy meat they just you\nknow there is the reality what are you\ndoing again theme okay I like I'll give\nthe I'll make the I'll make the example\npersonal like if you know\nbut you just I I don't I don't feel like\nI need an example can I actually can we\ngo the other route where I just asked\nyou and and make sure you're on the same\npage yeah thank good okay so you're\nsaying that you set your standard to\nreality in that everyone sets their\nstandard to reality and that some\npeople's and the realities are narrow\nand some people's realities are planet\nwide well like depending on your\nawareness it's it's bigger or smaller\nand that basically where is your\nawareness in relation to like other\npeople\nI see everybody as equal well that's\nkind of interesting because because it\nthat you know you you make these you\nmake these kind of like abstract\nphilosophical statements but when I\nactually listen to what you say it\nimplies something else so maybe you can\nhelp me understand this because you want\nto say like so I asked you you know do\nother people have objective realities\nand then you said yes and then you\nproceeded to make an actual comparison\nso you said that they're their realities\nare narrow whereas my reality is planet\nwide so you may think it's Harrison\nthere I can't I can give you a really\ngood example I'm sure you can but but\nplease don't get me an example I just\nwant to make sure yeah I know I know you\nreally want to give me an example and it\nseems like you just really he'll give\nyou a very concrete one about just you\ncan't you can't I know you just really\nwant to right you want to give me an\nexample like do you know do you see that\nwithin yourself that you really want to\njust give me that example like you got\nit like you got to make me understand\nyou really need to tell me like do you\nsee that within yourself that there's\nsomething within you that's like a\nvolcano that wants to explode and just\ngive me that example\nNo if you don't if you aren't eager to\nhear it and there's no reason to bring\nit up I am NOT eager to hear I would\nlike to ask a question and it's not that\nI don't want to hear what you want to\nsay it's just that I find that I hopes\nand you way better without examples okay\nso you made a comparison so you say that\nall people are equal I'm with you you\nmade a comparison where you said that\nother people have narrow realities and\nyour reality is planet wide yes okay so\nis there an intrinsic value judgment\nthere like is one better than the other\none benefits humanity more than the\nother so so you're saying that one is\nbetter that the planet-wide version of\nreality is better that white version of\nreality definitely leads to more\nconstructive actions towards society and\ntowards humanity and life in general yes\nthank you very much for explaining that\nthat helps me immensely to understand\nhow was it what was it like when I when\nI sort of was a little bit of an [ __ ]\nfor which I apologize and and and sort\nof jumped in when you were about to\nprovide an analogy and ask you a\nquestion that you answered is that okay\nfor you is it okay if I continue to do\nthat mine okay I don't mind if this\nhelps you and if it serves that purpose\nthen you you can even yell at me I don't\nmind okay thank you so much man I\nappreciate it it really helps me\nunderstand okay\nso um and if I cross the line please let\nme know because it's not my intention\nit's just I I kind of get the sense from\nyou that there's just this really like\ninstinctive responsive reflexive desire\nto like help me understand through\nanalogies whereas I just I just want to\nask questions and if you answer them\nplainly I think we'll get there I just\nhave to I have to I have to be better at\nresponding in a way that resonates\nbetter with you and I can do I\nappreciate that\nyeah that's exactly what I'm asking you\nto do so I'm really you know I'm\nadapting a bit yeah thank you I am too\nyeah so so so it sounds like there is\nsort of an inherent value judgement\nabout kind of the nature of reality and\nhow much that your version of reality\nbenefits humanity would you call a\njudgement or would you call it\nobservation\nyou\nyou\nhi yeah yeah I'm just thinking oh oh\nsorry sorry sorry it's a good question\nwhat I call it a judgment or what I call\nit an observation I'm not sure I mean if\nsomeone is hot that was I was gonna give\nif I'm busy with you know the\nenvironment right and I see where I put\nmy trash to make sure that it doesn't\nyou know that it doesn't pollute the\nplanet and someone else just goes like\nwhatever and throws the trash out and\nlitters I mean like there's the is just\na simple example it is it's a personal\none or if if I choose to not smoke\nbecause its effect will my health in the\nlong term what is he so simple related\nto you know the the smoking example is\nalso related to a more earth kind of\nawareness where I don't even deem my own\nlife as as crazy as it is sound as\nmyself my own\nit's like cells in my body they are\nthere they just do what they gotta do\nfor my life for me to live just as much\nas I'm here part of the collective to to\nto give back life is not about me and if\nyou have a if you make life very small\nthen you can believe it's about you even\nthough it's not and that's why so many\npeople experience a void in their life\nokay um is it okay if I switch gears and\njust ask you questions in sort of a\ndifferent vein sure let's go can you\ntell me a little bit about where you\ngrew up and what your upbringing was\nlike I in Belgium my family was very\npoor\nmy father's mother came from a very poor\nrural place\nmy mother is Belgium my mother was my\nmother was raised Christian and my\nfather was raised Muslim\nI wasn't like we were financially more\nstrong around 1415 years old\nhmm so yeah my youth was pretty poor but\nI didn't experience it as much my father\nwas quite\na very strong figure of authority while\nmy mother was very caring and loving and\nI've had have since I was really young I\nI was very much in contact with my\nbrother and his friends which were a lot\nolder talking about philosophy and stuff\nso very young I was already thinking\nabout stuff when I was already seven\neight I was already thinking about you\nknow like signs and stuff and was very\nbusy with it\nso what else yeah I guess that's that's\na I've been always I've never I got a\nlittle bit you know like when I was\nyoung you know some fights in school but\nI was never like experiencing low\nself-esteem and I was very unethical\nsince I was very young a very very\nobserver a very observant if I didn't\nreally develop identity when I was 13\nlike puberty didn't hit me so hard and I\njust wanted to give back my entire life\nbecause I've Irie you know saw the wrong\nin the world and when I saw people that\nwere struggling and me not there is just\nno difference between me and them it's\njust like why this is just unfair and if\nI can do something about it I got to do\nsomething about it because else yeah\nwhat if I'm that kid I mean if the roles\nwere different and this is just not okay\nand you said your dad was an authority\nfigure what do you mean by that\nhe was a very uh yeah like very what is\nthe word he became very fundamental\nIslamic rule alder and was very just a\nvery dominant person that at times were\nquite it was quite I tried to avoid him\nwhen I was younger because it was quite\nwhat do you call it\nyeah just yeah well it's not pleasant to\nbe around him but when it comes down to\ntrauma or something I I never got\ntraumatized by him or anything I don't\nknow for my other siblings if it was the\nsame I think I was like I was always\ndoing really well in school and such so\nI didn't get the the heat I was not the\nfront line of the one that was taking\nthe blame or frustrations of my father\nwhen he was angry so I was always like\nin my own little corner playing with\nLego or whatever when I was a kid so I\nwent through childhood pretty\nunscratched unless no I'm not\nsuppressing anything there's nothing I\nforgot about so there's a few things\nthat happen in my past that that had\nquite a hard impact on me emotionally\nbut even later on in life I managed to\nprocess them by reflecting on it like\nfor example like you have in culture of\nIslam they kill a sheep like that kind\nof stuff but I was already you know I\nwas it was already vegetarian before\nthat because of my brother but seeing\nthese kind of things made me also\nrealise what are we doing I mean it\ndoesn't make any sense but like it\nsometimes was hard for me to understand\nwhy grown-ups can be so inconsistent but\nI very quickly came to the realization\nthat people are not perfect and that\nthat even pointing out flaws or whatever\nleads to more harm than good so yeah\nokay I became very pragmatic in the way\nI certainly see that you seemed very\npragmatic you seemed very analytical\nyou seem very philosophical you seem to\nlive by truths right that you've you've\ndiscovered through reflection can I ask\nyou a couple of questions just about\nsome of the stuff that you said sure so\nyou said that you didn't sort of fail\nyou never face the brunt of your\nfather's anger\nthat you were kind of off in the corner\nplaying Legos and like someone else was\nfacing the blunt with the brunt yes like\nmy father in the past could be very it\ncould be very aggressive verbally and\nvery what is it the meaning is that the\nword like really putting people down\nyeah but I was never the target because\nbecause I was really I was basically the\nhow do you say it the exemplar kid to\nput it that way I always had good grades\nand so my brother and sisters how many\nsisters do you have to and also in in\nIslam culture like definitely\ntraditional woman are not always treated\nthe best so like that's that's like\nthat's also a big source of them being\nthe target and my older brother yeah he\nhe had to deal with a lot of [ __ ] as\nwell in that regards I'm sorry that\nsounds like sort of a rough situation\nwell I think every family has its own\nhas its own obstacles but he was there\nfor us his entire life and he provided\nyeah and yeah you've made mistakes he\ndefinitely made mistakes but sure\nin retrospect he you know it could have\nbeen a lot worse and he was actually I\nwould say definitely above average when\nit comes down to giving an aim a score\nokay good more than five has a father\nokay so it sounds like he wasn't perfect\nno one really is and at the same time\nyou're grateful for on average most of\nwhat he did for you yeah yeah yeah\ndefinitely like all doing retrospect if\nI could go back in time I would have I\nwould have been more capable of steering\nthings into a more constructive\ndirection because there is also there\nwas a divorce and stuff\nI could have done things better but I\ndidn't had the the knowledge I have now\nwhen I was younger\nwho knows it sounds like you don't feel\nguilty about that no I don't feel guilty\nabout it I mean this is what it is I\njust always try to do my best\ndear do you remember so you sort of like\nrare but you painted a sort of a vivid\nimage of like you playing Legos in the\ncorner while your dad was maybe yelling\nat your brother do you remember how you\nfelt when that was going on when you\nwere a kid yeah I was like when these\nthings happened I was just like I was it\nwas getting tuned out like I didn't even\nI was just like he had there too because\nmy brother and my sister were much older\nthan me they were already you know like\nwhat was it sixteen seventeen when I was\neight I was just like yeah it's it's\ngrown-ups you know like yelling at each\nother whatever like it's just almost\nlike another day you know like there was\nno it didn't make me feel like crawling\ninto a into a corner out of fear I was\njust there and I was tuning it out\nbecause yeah because it was it was just\nme any sense\nnormal even though you're it's respect\nit's not that normal yeah it's kind of\nweird right like what what you started\nto believe was normal that sort of\nwasn't normal\nit's also a kid as a kid it just is like\nthat I do it's it's almost it's almost\nlike you're like earlier when you said\nlike oh yeah it's not like anything\ntraumatic happened but we're sort of\ndescribing is like sort of traumatic but\nit was so normal that you sort of don't\neven see it that way yeah but like\nalthough we when I think about traumas\nand I hear what's two people have to go\nthrough I see myself as you know\nprivileged like some people got really\nsexually abused physically abused and\nreally like you know like emotionally\nabused that makes sense right like\nyou're kind of saying that other people\nin the world and I'm sort of seeing you\nknow pardon me because this is just kind\nof how my mind works but something of a\ntheme like it's almost like when you\ngrew up\nyou know that things were sort of it\nalmost sounds like a little bit unfair\nin terms of of you know your dad sort of\nnever picked on you because you were a\ngood kid and and that maybe he was doing\nother things like not he wasn't like\nsexually abusive or anything like that\nand you've said very clear I'm not\ntrying to paint your dad out to be a bad\nguy because you've you know stated very\nclearly that uh you know on average he\nwas better than most and you're grateful\nfor what he provided I'm not disputing\nthat or trying to trap you or anything\nat the same time you know I I do think\nit's kind of interesting because I'm\njust trying to put myself and I'm gonna\ntalk about me or I'm gonna use an\nanalogy or use an abstract version I'm\ntrying to kind of put myself in the\nshoes of you know someone who grows up\nin a household where their dad is\ndemeaning and verbally abusive and how\nit would be strange for someone to kind\nof grow up in that sort of household if\nthey're never the target and oddly\nenough I could sort of see how that\ncould lead to this kind of fundamental\nrealization especially if that kid was\nsuper analytical that the world is\nfundamentally at like an unfair place\nand even though I have it better than\nother people it's really unfortunate\nthat other people have it worse and that\nI wish things weren't like that and I\nthink that things should be more equal\nwell yeah basically what you're trying\nto get that is where does my motivation\ncome from from doing good in the world\nyeah I mean I'm saying that that the\ncircumstance you're you're offering I\nwould seems to fit with the motivation\nthat you have but I wouldn't say that\nsuch a fundamental motivation comes from\nsuch a simplistic place yes indeed like\nthat's exactly what I wanted to answer\nlike yeah the the biggest source of the\nbiggest source of of doing what I'm\ndoing is just the hard reality like and\nthe different experience of going\nthrough it I have not even done that I\nmean III didn't get out I didn't grow up\nin a war zone\nI never starved and and I've never liked\nwhat I also this is actually something\nthat's gonna sound a bit weird but it's\nit's a thought experiment I've done so\nmuch when I was younger\nand it's gonna sound a bit weird but\nit's it's gonna give you a better better\nID that's why I'm bringing bringing it\nup like for me the time and the place\nyou were born is all just random like I\ncould have born in during World War two\nI could have been born I could have been\nborn a Jew and I could have been you\nknow brought to the you know to the\nconcentration camps and if that would\nhave happened and that did happen to\nmany people and if it would have\nhappened to me and I would see my entire\nfamily you know basically getting killed\nand and me then being forced to do you\nknow hard labor with a gun pointed at my\nhead if I'm capable in that scenario\nright to do more good in the world then\nif I am doing right now then in a sense\nI'd be a better person in that situation\nand I cannot accept that I cannot accept\nthat that fact and that's a big reason\nwhy my bar is quite you know when I said\nearlier in my bar is hard my bar is\nquite high because I know if I was in\nthat reality that's what I would be\ndoing I mean like I would literally be\nworking 16 hours a day as a slave while\nI lost my family and not even being able\nto properly you know like give say\ngoodbye or anything which is much more\ncruel and if I could change at that\nmoment if I if I would given be given\nthe choice to live my life like I'm\nliving now rather than that life I would\ndo it in a heartbeat and I want to be\nable to do better than that version and\nas crazy as it sounds because I give\nthis example a lot on the stream it is a\nfact like if I was born in and not even\nthat if tomorrow there is you know\nwhatever there's some it sounds to me\nlike you're just sort of like really\nit's such such a strange thing that\nyou're kind of saying because what I'm\npicking up from you I I wouldn't be\nsurprised if you don't sort of get that\nyou're not trying to convey this but\nit's sort of weird I mean you're talking\nabout almost like that what you're doing\nin this world is insignificant and that\nyou could be doing so much more know\nwhat I'm doing right now is is very\nsignificant because I'm putting the\neffort to do so okay like what I've what\nI've achieved so far is really a lot\nlike to give you a few examples just to\ngive you an idea I raised more than 25\nmillion for children in need making me\none of the biggest philanthropists on\nthe Internet in a very effective manner\neffective programs that I've even\nvisited I visited ebola-hit country to\nraise awareness and I've also started\nthe place and that's why they call me a\ncult where people can apply and work\ntogether that have the same mindset of\nwanting to help the world and you know\nbasically find like-minded people to do\ngood in the world and and I'm going to\ntry to even do more like trying to\nimplement universal basic income in in\nvery poor places and stuff I'm very\nproactive and I also do real talk every\nday where I talk about you know people\nreflecting on these things and such and\nthat's why also some people said to talk\nto you because you do similar things so\nI I don't put myself down or anything I\nalways try to do better though so it's\nnot like I'm just you know also trying\nto brag or anything for me I just I just\ntry to do what is best at any given\nmoment and yeah so I think you know it's\nkind of interesting because I like you\nhave this very interesting\nconversational sort of pattern and I'm\nnot quite sure what to make of it where\nyou'll say or do something and then you\nkind of deny it immediately afterward\nand like what like so for example like\nyeah you just talked about all of your\naccomplishments and then like\nimmediately afterward like is the first\ntime you said I don't brag like earlier\nwhen you were talking about your\nupbringing you were like there was\nnothing traumatic but my dad was kind of\nyelling and stuff like that you just\nhave this interesting and sometimes when\nI like repeat back to you what you say\nit seems like there's a disc\nbetween the way I'm perceiving your\nwords and what your intention is which\nsort of makes sense because it you know\nit seems like you're very careful about\nbeing understood properly the reason why\nI'm making this clarification because\nI've been streaming for a very long time\nand whenever I bring up the amount of\nmoney I raise people immediately go into\nchat charity shield charity shield he's\nbragging he's bragging so I want to make\nsure that I'm just trying to state the\nfacts but yet maybe if if I wasn't\nhaving a conversation just with you I\nwould not even mention this it's because\nI'm aware that that more people watch\nand this is really like the charity\nstuff at the moment I talk about charity\nstuff everybody goes like oh hey there\nhe goes again because they think that I\nuse the good work that I did as\njustification to be aesthetically feel\nwhen they say that\nyou\nhonestly\nnow like\nI don't feel anything because I've\nalready processed it in the past it was\nit was I had a hard time understanding\nwhy but I've come to acceptance I've\ndone I've come to understand why it\nhappens is because it is because people\nproject very easily themselves and just\nsee me as something that I'm not\nthey think I'm a cult leader they think\nI'm a brain washer they think I'm\nscamming even though all these things\nare not real they're not true they\nbelieve that because they feel like it\nand that's it like it doesn't matter\nwhat is true or not\nwhen they feel like it it must be true\nand and for me as someone that is much\nmore analytical it's very hard to relate\nto it because if the truth tells me\ndifferently it's really very hard for me\nto to deny it but I've come to realize\nalso it you know the entire post truth\nworld we live in and such that is\nbecoming more and more strengthened with\nsocial media and the echo chambers\ncreated and stuff where people get you\nknow their life strengthened that is\njust you know a normal day for them and\nand that's the thing like I've come to\naccept that because in the past my\nfrustration came from a lack of\nunderstanding I was like why I'm doing\nall this good then I made videos even\nwith you know like we'd save the\nchildren cuz I raised a lot for save\nchildren\nI showed video I showed proof people\nkept saying I'm scammers even big\nstreamer saying I was a scammer I think\nI'm concerned that you have a you have a\nvery subtle but powerful ego can I share\nsome thoughts with you sure sure so like\nlet's just take this example ok so you\nwere kind of saying that you know you\nyou were you were you used to be like\nsort of not really happy or struggling\nto understand because you still don't\nreally talk about emotions at all you\nwere saying that you didn't understand\nwhy these people thought this way about\nyou but that essentially that they're\nprojecting and even though they're\nincorrect they just believe this and so\nlike you know that that it's just like a\nmisunderstanding on your part what I\nthink the really dangerous thing there\nis is like you know how do you know that\nyou are not the one that doesn't\nunderstand because you're kind of saying\nlike oh I'm objectively right and\neveryone else is projecting whereas how\ndo you know\nyou're not the one who's projecting and\nthey're not the ones who are objectively\nright because like for example if I if I\nif I walked out it like that I\nunderstand that but like with this\nspecific example it's very hard to do\nthat because I'm talking about the fact\nI mean it's like if I say the money goes\nall to charity and it actually goes all\nto charity there is no misunderstanding\non my part because I know all the money\ngoes to charity I mean there's evidence\neverything it's very transparent as well\nso if people then come to me and call me\na scammer then I know it's a\nmisunderstanding on their part it's not\nsure what about being a cult leader say\nwell what about being a cult leader well\nI'm open I'm open to - I'm open to the\nidea that I might be I don't think it is\nbased on the evidence that I see the\nproperties of a cult leader I don't\nthink I am but there is a chance that I\nam and that I'm just bullshitting myself\nand that's that's the that's you know\nthat's where I find it as a strength\nwhere I I always assume that what I\nbelieve might be wrong I don't think I'm\na cult leader based on the data points I\nhave but there is a chance that I have a\ncult leader and I'm just not aware of it\nbut so far no but nobody has shown I\nmean I'm happy to hear you sort of say\nthat I'm not saying that you are you\naren't but I think this is this kind of\nlike for you to kind of admit that maybe\nyou are bullshitting this entire thing\nmaybe you are a cult leader that that\nmaybe you're wrong I think is like a\nvery important perspective to take right\nan idea that I can I share with you what\nI think sort of is is what I'm seeing\nthis is just what one man's opinion okay\nso I'm not claiming this is genius I'm\nnot it's reality I'm just gonna share\nwith you what I see I think that your\nmission is very very real so I think\nyour your devotion to the cause is very\nvery real I think that you really do\nlong to make the world a better place\nand there are just a lot of like bizarre\nthings that I think the way that you\nrelate to your emotions the way that you\nconceptualize yourself you\nkind of like view your beliefs as truth\nlike and I recognize that when I say\nthat statement to you you're going to\nrespond by saying oh no all people are\nequal in my truth is no greater than\nother people's truth like I get that you\nsay that but if you actually listen to\nthe way that you talk for example when I\npoint out this issue of like a lot of\npeople say that you're a cult leader you\nkind of default to them being the ones\nthat are projecting and you're the one\nwho's factually correct and I think part\nof the reason that maybe this goes on is\nbecause I do think that you're not you\nhave it sounds like you've become\naccustomed to maybe numbing out emotions\nI'm not really sure about this this is\nlike where I will be the first to admit\nthat I don't really know but generally\nspeaking if you look at data a lot of\ntimes when people grow up in households\nwhere there is some form of abuse even\nif they're not members victims of the\nverbal demeaning or whatever that they\ncan develop like an interesting\nrelationship with their emotions so\ntheir emotions sort of affect them less\nthey learn to suppress things and you\nsort of described a scenario that kind\nof fits with that right like you if it\nbecame normal to you there's sort of\nlike toxicity there's like objective\ntoxicity in your household and you've\nbecome normalized to it it's become kind\nof like normal to you and anytime we\nsort of talk about things you sort of\nsay you experience emotions but at the\nsame time like when I ask you about them\nyour mind sort of goes to this and this\nis another pattern that I've observed in\nsome people unclear if it if it applies\nto you but that generally the process of\nabstraction and pulling yourself out of\nthe equation and being non personal with\nthe way that you view the world being\nobjective instead of subjective\nseparates you from some of those\nsubjective influences and in my\nexperience a lot of times when people\nare not aware of their subjective\ninfluences are the ones where they sort\nof lead to a logical conclusion that\nthey think objectively is true even\nthough they're completely and but they\nthink it's logically true because\nthey're not aware of how their mind is\nshaping their impressions I can I can\nunderstand that you can make this kind\nof you know\nconnections I do have to say though that\nwhen it comes down to emotions and\nemotional intelligence I would say that\nI have that I tried even more in that\nregards than when it's about cognitive\nintelligence it is because I understand\nmy emotions so well and I've had an\nalways a very you know honest\nconversation about how I feel towards\nmyself in trying to understand them that\nI managed to get to a point where I am\nnow because if it was suppressing\nsuppressing mechanics that I would be\nusing in order to achieve what I have\nachieved I would have already had a\nnervous breakdown\nI would I would like I wouldn't have\ngotten where I am\nI'm very stable and very fulfilled and\nsatisfied as a person and when certain\nstrong emotional events happens like for\nexample my father passing away like I\nprocessed them and and and I and I cry\nand I feel the emotions and I try to\nunderstand and make sense of it and and\nI and I go through the grieving process\njust like anyone else but because I have\nsuch an honest relationship with myself\nit goes very fast like it goes much\nfaster than with my siblings for example\neven though it's you know it's it's of\ncourse unfortunate and what I'm just\ntrying to explain is like this sense of\nseparation that you're talking about\nlike that even it's a very big trait of\nnarcissism as well do you think your\nnarcissistic no I don't think so okay I\ndon't think so at all I wouldn't deem\neverybody equally if I was arson I would\nfor myself being better than others I\nwouldn't work so hard as well to help\nother people if I would be narcissists\nbecause why I'm better than them like\nyes so that's kind of interesting\nbecause I think this is once again like\nsomething that I'm having trouble\nunderstanding and I think I'm gonna have\nto wrap up in a few minutes I'll give\nyou kind of I'm just kind of letting you\nknow but so I'll just give you an\nexample right so like you make these\nthese abstract philosophical statements\nlike I believe all people are equal but\nif we actually pay attention to what you\nsay\nyou frequently compare yourself for\nexample you just talked about how you\nprocess emotions more fully and more\nrapidly than your siblings after your\ndad passes away and that's a pattern\nthroughout this conversation you say all\npeople are equal but by the way in this\nparticular example I'm objectively\nbetter at processing emotions than other\npeople like you use those kinds of\nexamples all the time that sort of say\noh others have an error in reality and I\nhave a planet-wide reality the thing is\nthough equality does not mean that you\ncan have certain traits that are you\nknow factually more nearer advanced and\nothers I mean like do you do you think\nthat personality is on a fundamental\nlevel we are all equal as human beings\nthat equality automatically brings about\nthat certain people that can contribute\nmore than others for example that that\nthat aspect also has to be part of the\nequation and that's the practical\nreality of equality the practical\nreality I have one last question sorry I\nkeep interrupting you I apologize I\nreally do you think that narcissists\nbelieve that and I'm I don't I don't\nknow if you're narcissists or not so\nthis isn't some kind of veiled attack\nI'm genuinely curious because I have a\nfollow-up question do you think that\nnarcissists believe that they are that\nthey have that they're objectively\nbetter in some ways than other people I\nthink narcissus is glorified himself\nyeah so I think you have a very\ninteresting kind of ego so I think you\nhave the ego of having no ego so when I\nwas studying in India one of my teachers\nonce told me that there are two kinds of\nego and one is very subtle and it's\nsomething that you see in people who are\nhighly spiritual one is the standard ego\nwhich is kind of like narcissism and one\nis the ego of having no ego it's saying\noh look at how everyone else glorifies\nthemselves but look at how I don't\nglorify myself at all\nlike other people glorify themselves but\nI don't\nso there's sort of like a subtle ego of\nlook at how egotistical everyone else is\nlook at how everyone else projects but I\ndon't I don't project\nI'm not egotistical I'm objective I'm\nhumble I'm devoted to the cause I'm pure\nI can't I know that you're almost have\nto go and that's why I want to respond\nto this release in a very I do think\nthat a lot of the conversation that\nwe've had like comes from you trying to\nsee yourself in me and a lot of it is\nprojection where you go through life in\na more self-centered manner and you try\nto find that framework in me while so\nfor example for the ego and these things\nwhere parts in your life where you\nstruggled with it a lot while for me all\nthese things are very irrelevant like I\njust go through life I wake up I do what\nI gotta do when I go to bed it's very\nsimple yeah and all these concepts and\nand this you know this like all my\nexperience or my pastor stuff is\nirrelevant to me it's like and it truly\nis like if you get to know me or you see\nme you would really be be a little bit\nconfused like a why doesn't he care\nabout these things and because I was\nconfused up until this moment but yeah\ngo ahead a lot of a lot of what a lot of\nyour analyzes is filling the gaps with\nyour own experience which then\nautomatically portrayed something where\nyou try to see you know you try to\nconceptualize and and and see me as a\nyou know from yeah from that angle while\nI just live my life and accept things\nfor what they are and and and when I\nexperience discomfort I just take it and\nI just you know go about my day and\nthat's it like there is no there is no\nfocus on the self development or any of\nthat because at the end of the day we\nare what we are and all these things are\nnot that you know are not that relevant\nwhen you when you want to eat you gotta\neat and when you you know when you gotta\nget water you get water things are\nactually very same\nwhen you strip away all the all this all\nthis noise and that's the way I live my\nlife and and and and there is very\nlittle to it like it's it's it's\nactually quite simple I'm just saying\nlike I think a lot of the analyzing that\nyou're doing is coming from your\nperspective and trying to understand me\nthrough your world which is yeah which\nis which is which is not which is not as\neasy when when when when I go about life\nin a way where a lot of this identity\nstructure and construct just doesn't\nreally exist because I know it's not\nreal sure so I thank you for explaining\nthat positive way and this is not a\ncriticism I I didn't think it was a\ncriticism at all are you getting the\nsense that I'm Crick I'm very glad so I\nI've been very transparent with you\nabout what I think could be going on so\nfor example I said like I think you have\nthis other kind of ego called the ego of\nhaving no eager I think that could be\ngoing on because I can't really know you\nafter talking about an hour and a half\nright so I I think I think the way I'm\napproaching this conversation is by\ntrying transparently sharing my\nimpressions so that you can explain to\nme your perspective on it yes right and\nso you've just explained to me that you\nthink that when I toss something like\nthat out at you that it is a projection\nfrom my end and in my experience yes\nmany parts in the conversation but yes\nyeah yeah yeah I I agree I'm simplifying\nthings I'm losing some nuance so just\none last thing that I would kind of\nleave with you is that often times and\nyou're when you're kind of talking about\nme coming from my experience I\ncompletely agree I'm absolutely coming\nfrom my experience now I don't know when\nyou say my experience do you mean my\npersonal psyche or my do you mean my\nexperience in life\nyour your experience in life okay so\nI'll show you with you just one last\nthing so generally speaking when I I'm a\npsychiatrist and when I deal with people\nwho have narcissism when their\nnarcissism is challenged they will\nfrequently go to things like projection\nof the person who is challenging their\nnarcissism right so like if I tell you\nhey I think maybe you have this kind of\nego the simplest way for your that kind\nof ego to hide is to debunk or deep\ndiffuse or challenge or pull the legs\nout of what I'm trying to say so you say\nlike oh like it's not really a problem\non my end you're just projecting which I\ncould be projecting I'm just sharing\nwith you I'm not saying your\nnarcissistic or that you aren't I'm just\na question yeah so let's say I would\ntell you you're a narcissist right yeah\nand you would start giving arguments\nwhile you're not right no ah no no I\nwould ask you why do you think I'm a\nnarcissist I wouldn't start arguing with\nyou immediately I would ask you where\nyour perspective comes from and help me\nunderstand why you think I'm a\nnarcissist but that so let's say that's\nI not what you do right you start\narguing immediately and explaining to me\nwhy I'm wrong and how I'm all go a step\nfurther because like sure I'm not just\nasking you whether you're a narcissist I\nsay you are a narcissist because of this\nand this and that\nright and you respond to this and this\nand that and you say like yet this does\nnot apply to me and then I tell you\nthat's what every narcissist would say\nyes what's your question say what you\nsaid let me ask you a question but I\nhaven't heard a question well that's the\nquestion if but that's it's not a\nquestion well like what what what is\nyour what is your response to to to this\nbecause it's like a basically a catch-22\nat that point it's like no it's not\nbecause because there's a problem with\nthe assumption right so you said if I if\nI call you a narcissist and then you\nsaid and then I say I give you evidence\nand then you respond to that evidence if\nyou counter that evidence and then I say\nbut you're projecting I wouldn't do that\nI wouldn't I wouldn't do that middle\nstep between me and you is different so\nwhen you say if you call me narcissus\nI'm not going to respond to your\nevidence with evidence of my own I'm\ngonna stop and ask you why you believe\nthat and help me and I'm going to\nunderstand where you're coming from and\nwhy you believe that about me so that's\nthe difference so if you if you if you\ndon't let me I would if I would present\nyou with three cases you either have you\nknow the ego of not having an ego or you\nhave you know a strong ego or you have a\nweak ego right if that is the three\npoints that I you know that I present\nand I say this is this is in this\nframework you're either one of the three\nright and I'm saying like oh no that is\nthat is that is based on your experience\nthat you have these three you know these\nthree properties and you don't see it\nwider then I am the one giving a organ\nbecause it's very directly connected to\nthe reason why you said I wasn't\npotentially a narcissist or or have ego\nlike and I'm telling you the reason why\nyou only have these three options in\nyour explanation is because you're\nprojecting your experience because if\nyou would have a wider experience you\nwould have more versions than just these\nyou're making you're making a couple of\nbig assumptions so I do have other\noptions in my tool belt I just simply\ndon't think that they apply to you right\nso I'm not talking to you about things\nthat I don't think apply to you then I\nmisunderstood that I thought yeah\nyou you would I'm glad these these I'm\nsure I'm sharing when I say here's what\nI think could apply to you Athene I'm\ntalking about the things that apply to\nyou not all of the possibilities you\nwere talking about your experience in\nIndia where you were talking to your\nteacher and he was mentioning these\nthree yeah so it was not in direct\ncorrelation with me it was based on your\nown experience that's why I brought it\nup yeah so like I would assume if you\nwould tell me about your experience\nwhich is not directly connected to me\nthat it would have all options and if it\nwould just be in in in context to\ntalking to me you wouldn't even have to\nmention all three you would just mention\none so then it's not so far-fetched for\nme to assume that you were giving a full\nscope of what you are trying to explain\nbased on your experience which then made\nme mention hey this is based on your\nexperience that's what you call\nprojection basically I'm just saying\nlike it's not like I'm trying to be you\nknow deflective on what you say I'm GRU\nwas just trying to pinpoint to the\nargument you were giving me why you know\nwhat why these things could be the case\nthat's all like yeah I'm not yeah that\nmakes sense\ndo you have I offended you in some way\nno not at all\nokay like honestly they're like I I know\nyou're just trying to do what is best\nbased on your own you know you're your\nown reference frame and I try to have\nthe best as well so to me I'm not\njudging or blaming or whatever I just\nyou know I just thought it was\ninteresting to have a chat with you and\na call and because people in my in my\nview were basically in your view base\nwere really you know very very\ninterested in listening to conversations\nso I thought it would be interesting and\nI completely agree man so can I offer\njust a couple of other thoughts and then\nask maybe one or two last questions so\nfirst of all I think I I you know just\nfor the sake of\nI want to just repeat what I said\nearlier I do think that your cause is\nVenu very genuine and that your approach\nis just and that you really believe in\nwhat you're doing\nin my experience so once again talking\nabout my reference frame which is really\nthe only reference frame I can come from\nthat can coexist with the ego of having\nno ego and in fact the people who are\nthe people who develop an ego of having\nno ego are the ones who are actually\ndoing the kind of work that you do so\nit's very common amongst people like\nmonks and it's a very very subtle ego\nthat's very difficult to detect so\nwhether that's going on with you or not\nI at the end of the day can't really say\nbut I'm noticing some signs that could\npoint to that now whether that's the\ncase or not I'm not sure and I've sort\nof laid those out before and you can\nkind of watch when I sort of talk about\nhow you end up making comparisons but\nyou make overarching statements about\ntruth of equality but when you actually\nlisten to what you say you make lots of\ncomparisons with other people and that\nwhen you make those comparisons you sort\nof treat them as a reality is a is\nopposed to an opinion whether it's real\nor not like I don't know some of that\nstuff actually sure like you can sort of\nfactually say that you know stuff went\nto charity or didn't go to charity but\nwhen it comes to like who emotionally\nprocesses your dad's death the fastest I\ndon't know how you would know that\nbecause I don't think there are any\nexternal signs that sort of course if\npractically if I'm talking to my\nsiblings like regularly I can see them\ncarrying it a much more heavily than I\ndo for sure like some of my siblings in\nmore than a year later are still\nstruggling with it like yeah so for me\nso yeah I mean that is that it's not in\nmy I mean it's just not in my head it's\nunless I can reason I can I'm\nsuppressing it there you go there you go\nI don't think so but it is possible but\nI I completely I completely agree that\nyou could be suppressing it\nyou may not be suppressing it and that\nit would be very hard for you to know\nbecause that's the nature of suppression\nright suppression is when our mind\nburies something so that we're not aware\nof it that's the very definition of it\nso I'm really using so many emotions\nwhen you passed away hi\nthese are even have experienced the\nemotions the emotional process because\nlike initially initially when it\nhappened I was the person to accept it\nthe quickest like some people didn't\nlike some of my siblings didn't even\naccept that he passed away like it took\nin them days before they even realized\nthat I think I really do not know enough\nabout that situation so you know you\nwere there you know what you experienced\nyou know what you saw you're gonna be\nthe one who's who's best able to judge\nwhat actually happened there's no way I\ncan say all I'm saying is that I think\nexactly what you said which is that\nthere's a possibility possible yes that\nyou suppress some kind of emotion\nbecause I think the evidence suggests\nthat you grew up in a household where a\nlot of children learn to suppress\nemotions ie playing with LEGOs while\nyour brother is getting yelled at and\nsometimes that leads to emotional\nsuppression I'm not saying it it did in\nyour case or that it happens now I just\nI don't know do you feel it I actually\ndo not know I I don't know when it comes\nto you I really don't know I'm just\nsharing with a bit I'm just in general\nwhen you suppress emotions do you feel\nit in any shape or form yeah almost you\ndo feel it yeah because I don't feel it\nI'm just saying like what does I mean\nyou can feel it feel it like emotionally\nor physically or what in any shape or\nform is that anything yeah so good\nabsolutely so I think the biggest sign\nthat you have suppressed or inactive\nemotions is actually your ego so in my\nexperience the ego arises is a\nprotective mechanism for emotions and\nallows us to not feel the emotions so\nI'll just give you an example like if\nI'm attracted to a woman and I asked her\nout and she says no then my ego becomes\nactive and I start coming up with all\nkinds of justifications for why I asked\nher out and why she said no instead of\njust feeling the rejection so I'll start\nto tell myself oh like objectively she's\nnot that attractive logically I just\nasked her out for these reasons and then\nwhat the ego does is it goes to your\nintellect and hijacks the Intel\nbecause I'm sure you've observed that\nwhen people become narcissistic you\ncan't logically convince them of\neverything because they are logically\nconvinced that they are absolutely\ncorrect that their intellect is not\nfunctioning properly and is sort of like\nfunctioning due to these things like\nprojection and narcissism can they see\nthemselves change I don't know it's an\nabstract question I'm not sure I'm just\nsort of well because you were talking\nabout nice it depends on the person so\ngenerally speaking when I point this out\nto them I think a lot of value comes\nfrom it right so well this is this is\nwhat I see that makes me think that you\ncould have ego one is that you know it\nsounds like you live a life where\nthere's where people attack you in some\nways and generally speaking when I think\nabout that I imagine that at times in\nthe past that sounds like that hurt\nyou're kind of okay with it now or that\npeople say like slandering things about\nyou you tend to be hyper focused on\nrationality logic and abstraction and\nwhen we actually oh one second I'm sorry\nthat it takes so long sorry I gotta get\ngoing yeah but that that I sort of see\nyou fitting this pattern whether it\napplies to you or not I'm not sure but\nthat generally speaking a hyper\nrationality with abstraction and a lot\nof comparative statements without\nbelieving you're making comparative\nstatements or that your comparisons are\nobjectively correct whereas other\npeople's opinions or just opinions or\nprojections speaks to me of the presence\nof ego whether that's true or not I\ndon't know I mean I think the reason I'm\nsharing this with you is because I\nrespect you and I think you should\nreflect on it which is exactly what I\nthink you're doing in what you will do\nand I think that's awesome that you're\ndoing that and I have one last question\nfor you so do you want to collaborate\nthat was the goal of this conversation\nfor you right so let me ask you well the\nanswer the answer to that question lies\nin you and the answer is do you like how\nfar do you want to go to truly help\npeople basically like and and the\nconversation has shown me that you want\nto live a normal life and you want to\nhelp people on the side and combine them\nboth and basically in a sense settle\nwith that and my question would be like\nyeah do you want to settle with that or\ndo you want to take it further because\nyou can maybe help even more\nbecause like for me that is that is the\nextent to which we can collaborate\nbecause of course we can collaborate in\nless or bigger extent but like the\nextent to which you want out of you know\nyour comfort zone and really do good in\nthe world for a big part defines how\nstrong we can work together because of\ncourse we can have you know these talks\nbecause people seem to really love it I\nmean like look at the amount of people\nthat are watching it's crazy like they\nlike they like this conversation you\nlike to see you know stalking because\nit's very interesting so in that regards\nthat on itself could be interesting\nbecause I like to talk to you it's not\nlike talking with destiny where it's\nreally very very very sensational and\nyelling and all that stuff this is much\nmore chill and people seem to like that\nand and it's hard to even find an\ninterest for these type of conversations\nso in that regards I think we can\ndefinitely collaborate when it comes\ndown to practical action and do you know\nlike like charity work and stuff it's\nsomething you know we we could we could\nexplore in the future so I would say I\nwouldn't I wouldn't drop a no and and I\nwouldn't throw up a yes I think we can\nyou know we can definitely have a\nfollow-up conversation if that's\nsomething you feel like doing and I will\ndefinitely reflect on things you said\nand you can also do so if you think\nthere was anything worthwhile I think\nthere was a time that was worthwhile\nyeah so yeah like and your viewers if\nthey find it worthwhile because I also\nunderstand if you know it's not\nsomething for them that I'm not going to\nyou know be this yeah this this guest\nthat they just go like okay again this\nsome of this and yeah maybe we can also\nyou know like in the future spice it up\nbecause I've been very I have been very\nyeah like like we've been very what do\nyou call it surface it was a very\nsurface conversation and I do think if\nwe go deeper things will become even\nmore interesting because it helps people\nto understand intent and such and and\nand help you thinking philosophically\nSagan you be deeper philosophically no I\nmean deeper psychologically really to\nthe foundation of what drives us to do\nwhat we do and why we do it and and and\nanalyzing it in a way that people can\nvery easily relate to because comfort\nfor example is a word everybody can\nrelate to it's very easy to wrap your\nhead around like oh yeah sure I'm trying\nto you know settle and find comfort in\nwhat I'm doing\nit's easy to to get like people that\nprocrastinate people you know that don't\nprocrastinate it's very common ground\nyeah and and and and basically being\nable to simplify everything we talk\nabout that sometimes kins can look\ncomplex on the surface like I mean this\nconversation it sometimes was really all\nlike a little bit all over the place at\nthe time the theme dude I really gotta\ngo cuz I literally have a car that's\nwaiting outside with my kids it's been\nhere like if you're interested we can\ndefinitely have another call and yeah\nlike for me it was interesting I like to\nhave this chat do you get want to\ncollaborate more in the future I have no\nidea what that means because you speak\nin such philosophical and broad terms\nthat I like it would be if it would be\nhaving more of these kind of\nconversations for example on the stream\nyeah okay hold on one second I really\ngot to go um I'm gonna say the same\nthing you said which is maybe not a yes\nand not a no okay I just have\nthink about whether this is aligned with\nthe kind of work that I'm trying to do\nlike I think it's done\nhey what's up yes I understand\nunderstood okay okay I'm coming love you\nyeah let's do a theme okay I had to hang\nup on the dude cuz I I really got to run\nmy kids are going insane it's cold\noutside okay so let me just stop real\nquick okay well talk about um I gotta go\nbut I hope that wasn't rude to a theme I\nwill apologize to him later anyway guys\nI thought I mean I thought that was\ninteresting you know we'll see I don't\nknow if you guys are you know that was I\ndon't know how much of that was\nvoyeuristic for you all but it really\nwasn't lawyer to stick for me I mean I'm\nnot trying to upset him or anything but\nyeah so thank you guys for coming we're\ngonna stream on Sunday from 6 to 8 and\nwe're gonna do like more Q&A and stuff\nbut I really just like literally have to\nrun out of the room but love you guys\nthank you for everyone who showed up and\nyeah have a nice evening"
