    "transcript": "you could talk about digging deep in\npsychology like you find your inner self\nman like you got it you gotta want it no\nyou don't know you you walk you put one\nfoot in front of the other that's how\nyou do it\nyou\nso sky have you been man you know this\nalive feel like um left a few grenades\nin my head been keeping them from\nblowing up this is good not a bad thing\nbut you know yeah sorry about that\nwe have attended no it's fine I think\nit's good so yeah what were you\nmentioned I left a couple of grenades\nsorry for doing that and what do you\nmean by that\nwell I am I think the biggest one was\nthat things can be fixed and changed\nthat was just weird to me like IA did it\ndid not sit well with me at all like I\nwas thinking I pretty much had to then\ngo and think about everything in my life\nthat I thought couldn't be changed it\nwas hopeless and then I just was like\nwow maybe these things can change that\nwas probably the biggest one yeah so\nlike my relationship with like people\nthat I you know fell out with or even my\nbrother right like anything can happen\nit's not impossible to make those\ndifferences I guess so sky this is gonna\nsound kind of weird but I want you to\nunderstand that the place that you're in\nnow is actually way harder than the\nplace that you were in before we talked\nso like think about this for a second if\nnothing can change and things are\nirreversible then your responsibility in\nlife like what happens to your\nresponsibilities in life well then it\nbecomes easier because that's just like\nthat's like the quip of religion right\nwhere you have all the answers free like\nanswered for you not saying it's bad\njust saying that like no I think I think\nyou're right so there's a lot of solace\nand protection in the idea that like\nthings are screwed forever yes and I\nthink that's what was that wasn't the\nhardest thing was is because even though\nI was able to analyze it more out there\nour first talk the amount of\noverwhelming support that people have\nhad in me in their faith in me to do\nthings I've never really been able to\nto blind eye to my like to what I can do\nor what can be accomplished but no\nyou're right now that you kind of like\nhello can you see me yeah yeah okay my\nmonitors being dumb I was being I mean\nin in a way it's kind of cowardly to\njust think that nothing is that\neverything is useless but I've never had\nthat door completely closed I've always\nknown that there's a small percent\nchance that I can win but you show me\nthat there it's more than a small\npercent chance which and you blew the\ndoor open so it's like blew the door\nopen and now like I can just see like my\nmessy room in my head and like my dirty\nbathroom and just everything I'm exposed\nin a way that's why it feels yea good\nterrible yeah so that's weird so let's\nlet's talk about that what do you mean\nby terrible and what do you mean by good\nterrible um I think that's great\nlanguage by the way oh thank you\nwell if you live your life kind of like\nnever really trying SuperDuper hard you\nnever really like as long as the door\nthat I had in my mind was barely cracked\nopen for the remainder of my life I\ncould have just said well if I would\nhave really put my heart into it I would\nhave been fine look at what I've done\nbefore but now it's like now the door is\nopen so it's like oh well\nguess now I really have to do it I\nreally have to actually go out there and\nand and and be whatever it and it's a\nterrible feeling because every single\nthing that I've done in my life I've\nnever been world-class like I've been\npretty good at a lot of things I was but\nI've never been like really truly\ngodlike and I can in games that I play\nor even on YouTube and I feel like you\ntouched on why I feel like I just\nprotected myself by not really exposing\neverything I have an M yes so this is\nimportant sky you your ego has always\nhad a little bit of an out because you\nnever gave it your all right yeah that\nlike is it bad that I want to close the\ndoor though no it's not bad that you\nwant to close the door that's because\nthat's what happens coz so here's the\nthings guy you've never really failed in\nlife because you've never really tried\nnow you're you're exposed to failing in\na completely different way it sucks\nit's terrifying so most of the time we\nhalf-ass things so that we leave\nourselves a little out right we say like\nokay like if I had really not\nprocrastinated then I could have gotten\nan a on this oh yes that yes prease I\nfeel that all the time and and so but\nnow it's dangerous territory because now\nyou're leaving yourself nowhere to hide\nbecause now if the door is open and you\ntry your best and you fall up short what\ndoes that mean about you me that I'm not\ngood it's like I'm like wow guys see I\ntold you I'm terrible\nyes so that means that like now you're\nexposing yourself to the your worst\nfears about yourself being true I've got\nnowhere to left to hide and it's it's\nterrifying the other thing though you\nsay it's good terrible so I'm going to\nuse another word liber8\nokay liberating what do you think about\nthat yeah I mean that makes sense I mean\nit's it's you're you're you're right\nit's it's it sucks and it feels bad but\nit's just the overwhelming sensation\nthat that there is a possibility that\nI'm the bet it's true that if I do put\neverything in I am gonna end up being\nmediocre and the only thing that I could\nsay to that is like well damn it like\nlike there's nothing else that could be\ndone then if every time I put everything\nin and something something good no no so\nSkyy here's the really really crazy\nthing so you're you're you've taken the\nfirst step of maybe a two step journey\nso you're halfway there so the second\nthing which is gonna be really so you\nknow opening the door has is not exactly\nwhat you anticipated right like it's\ngood in some ways and it's bad in some\nways and it's just different and weird\nso here's the cool thing when you give\nit your all you're gonna fall short and\nwhen you fall short it's gonna feel\namazing\nyou\nOh\nwords yeah what the vibe is what I want\nto say but I had a nod my head and be\nlike oh yeah\nno no say what it's talkin confusing No\nokay the yes I I can see the benefit of\nfalling short in fact I would argue that\nright now that my audience you know is\ndiminished it feels good knowing that I\ncan really go out and now do things that\nI kind of have always wanted to do but\nmaybe I couldn't because I was too\nnervous about a larger audience seeing\nit now I feel like I can actually grind\nthe issue though is that there are so\nmany people that have invested in me in\nways that I couldn't even fathom to say\nand it's like going out on stage and\nfalling\nI'll know man this doesn't seem like\nthere's good from that yep exactly\nexactly and so get your tweet by the way\nabout this I just didn't do it yet what\njust letting you know I'm gonna retweet\nyour tweet about this conversation I\ndidn't do it yet that's why I want my\nphone that's why yeah so sky-eye and\nthis is the thing I I don't I don't\nthink that I'm gonna I can try to\nexplain it to you I don't think it's\ngonna make sense though until you\nactually do it yeah I'm gonna try to\nyeah and and so we can talk a little bit\nabout that but I just want to explain\nkind of what I mean so now sky is gonna\ngive it as all and he's gonna go out on\nstage and inevitably he's gonna fall\nright because it's gonna happen at some\npoint\nbut the problem here is that the reason\nthat you need ego is because you lack\nconfidence you don't have faith that you\ncan do something and since you don't\nhave faith you can do something you hold\nback a little bit right you don't give\nit a hundred percent you give it like 98\npercent because you're you're just a\nterrified that giving it a hundred\npercent will be not enough yeah but\nhere's the crazy thing when you fall\nface-first on stage and then you get\nback up and everyone cheers and then you\nstart singing or doing whatever it is\nthat you're gonna do and then you go off\nstage and you're mortified and you're\nlike okay next time I go out on stage no\none is gonna be there because I fell and\nthen you're gonna go out on stage and\nthere's still people gonna be there and\nyou're gonna be like what the [ __ ] but I\nfell and then you're gonna be so nervous\nabout it that you're gonna fall again\nand real confidence doesn't come from\nsuccess like this is your problem sky is\nthat you the more successful you've\nbecome the more your ego has like been\nafraid that you're not worth it the more\nyou feel like kind of an impostor the\nmore that you feel like you're like\nriding this wave that is eventually\ngonna master yes oh my god that is the\nperfect word that is yeah like oh man\nI'm afraid of like doing something big\nand then being like what we waited for\nthat and then just like you know I just\nbeen it's like yeah that's not the guy\nthat we supported let's leave everyone\nlike yep so so here's where confidence\ncomes from right when you hit that\nsituation\neveryone should walk out the door in\nyour deepest deepest fears they're\nwalking out the door and they're\nabandoning you and you show up the next\nday and they're still there yeah I hate\nthat I don't know why they here\nI tell them on stream I'm like guys\nyou're subscribing to me you know I'm\njust gonna leave for four months or\nwhatever like what are you doing like\nwood let's be real you know give the\nmoney to your mom like do something else\nwith it yeah I'm gonna finish this\nbecause I'm a voter and I want to just\ntweet this I I said that you\nrestructured in my mind you are Attica\nyou're the best what\nokay he's unreal I'm here we go got it\nnow I'm ready okay thanks for tweeting\nso skies there's something in particular\nI me do you have questions or anything\nor do something that you want to\nquestions you want to ask her I mean I\nget delete if you want but no no um\nthere's just another grenade yeah sorry\nI'm trying to like I'm trying to\nremember everything that you said I will\nreview this the moment it's posted but I\nalso this might sound like a scapegoat\nbut I think that my weight has a really\nbig like role in all of this like no pun\nintended but it I think that it has a a\nmassive role cuz I've only been skinny\nonce and that was when my youtube\nchannel was like at its peak oh my god\nthose are the days and then obviously\nyou know depression hit and then now I'm\nback to looking like grimace or mr.\nPotato Head but the big version of it so\nit's really hard for me to execute all\nthe ideas that I want because I\ndefinitely care about what everybody\nthinks times a million mm-hmm but then I\nalso feel like I use it as an excuse oh\nman it's a big mess yeah so I guess my\nquestion is like what do you go ahead\nsorry no no you're fine what\n[Music]\nwhat to like like what what happens now\nI I'm just not sure what to do yeah\ngreat so beautiful so you've done the\nfirst right thing right which is that\nyou've noticed noticing is where\neverything begins okay you've noticed\nthat your weight somehow influences the\nway that you perceive yourself and how\nthose perceptions influence what you're\nable to do and what kind of behaviors\nyou engage in\nright that your weight sometimes keeps\nyou from doing things that you want to\ndo or should do all the time yeah and so\nbut the thing is it's all tangled up and\nyou're not quite sure how to go about\nuntangling it\nright well yeah because member that's\nthat's also another thing it's like okay\nwell if I get skinny no more excuses\nlike yeah so what is that what is that\nto spell it out for a sky beautiful\nconnection\nI mean it just means that the the door\nis actually it feels like the door is my\nweight yes like the new tangible\nrepresentation of the door is my body he\n[ __ ] Sigmund Freud would love you man\n[Laughter]\nthat's the kind of thing that gets like\npsychiatrists turned on like oh my god\nlike his weight is a psychosomatic\nrepresentation of the barriers in his\nlife that wouldn't feel good weighing\nhim down literally and there's puns\nthere it actually works on so many\nlevels yeah but that's that's what I\nfeel and I think as long as I can\nremember I've definitely liked like I've\ndefinitely tried a lot and again it\nworked once yeah but unfortunately the\nsad truth is the one time that it did\nwork was because I actually suffered a\nvery embarrassing leg injury and at the\ntime when I was dieting and that\nhappened I was like confined to my room\nand I couldn't go anywhere or do\nanything at all except play Final\nFantasy 14 so at that time I just ate my\ndiet food and stayed in my room and then\nwhen my leg was feeling better I come\ndown and pants that was like three sizes\nsmaller and after that everybody was\nlike oh my god like I mean the picture\nis pretty staggering so it's like even\nthen I can't really credit my weight\nloss to some like breakthrough I was\nforced in my bed by at like a leg injury\nso it's like I didn't really do it yeah\nyeah I mean I I so I see what you're\nsaying but I think you're actually\nselling yourself a little bit short\nbecause like if you're if you're\nsedentary and playing ff14\nall day long and you're not leaving your\nhouse you could be eating like frozen\ntaquitos every day - oh my god yes right\nI mean I mean yes it could be and so I\nthink I think you're actually doing your\nyourself a little bit to service because\neven in that moment like you could have\nmade unhealthy food choice\nand you made healthy choices fair okay\nyeah okay that none of that's true so be\ncareful about that right so be careful\nabout that part of your mind that\ndisavows your successes so like you have\nto be careful because like your mind is\ndoing this very like interesting thing\nwhere if you [ __ ] up whose fault is it\nmine and if you succeed whose fault is\nit who gets the credit\nis it me not in this case right yeah\nanything that is not me absolutely\nbeautiful\nyeah so when our YouTube channel was at\nits height ooh why was that sky cuz I\ngot um I got frustrated so I made a vlog\nevery single day in one month and it\nexploded my channel is blew up and so at\nthat point it was like really hard to\ndeny that people didn't want to see me\nand so it exploded there but then I\nstill left for a while but that was the\nmost content I've ever put out so so but\njust listen listen to that the uses toss\nout a really interesting sentence it was\nreally hard to deny that people didn't\nwant to see you but just think about\nthat the presumption is that you're\ntrying to deny that people want to see\nyou like that's where you start from is\nthat I'm not worth seeing and then the\nevidence became so overwhelming that you\nare worth seeing that you couldn't deny\nit to yourself anymore but at the core\nthere's no sense of value to what you\nbring to the table the evidence has to\nbe overwhelming that you're doing\nsomething important that people enjoy\nfor you to like overcome it yes but this\nis also something that I think one of my\nbiggest I don't know if this is a flaw\nbut I have a very very poor view of like\nthe world in terms of people like in\nterms of people that are looking at me\nmy field of vision is really really\nlimited to like\nTwitter and sometimes reddit so it's\nlike I look at my relationships with a\nlot of big content creators for a long\ntime now to support this lifestyle I\npretty much asked to everybody for money\nduring my depression where I felt like I\ncouldn't work so a lot of my\nrelationships have been tarnished in\ngossip channels here and there behind\nthe scenes of course now I'm kind of\nknown notoriously as a [ __ ] that just\nkeeps asking a friend that just keeps\nasking everybody for money and in my\nfield of vision it makes me feel that\nthat is what every single person on\nearth feels cuz you know in in in some\nways maybe in a conversation at PAX that\nI wasn't - because I haven't been to\nlike an event in four years\nmaybe was on a stream maybe wasn't\npassing maybe wasn't secret these things\nget around it's a very malicious\nbusiness YouTube yeah so yeah but it's\nhard for me to to see that so I think\nsky the solution there is for you to not\nbe that thing cuz you they say it about\nyou and you believe to a certain degree\nlike there's a part of you that believes\nthat there's a part of you that doesn't\nI'm not that like I'm not that person at\nheart like any money that I've asked for\nhas not really ever been for me it's to\nsupport this abusive lifestyle that I\nhad so part of me knows that I'm okay\nlike Skye Williams will live if I'm by\nmyself I will live but I do know that\nI've asked a lot of people for money I\ndo know that I borrowed money I do know\nI have to pay them back that is what I\nam I don't want to be that and now at\nthis late stage in the game you're\ngiving me the tools that I need to\nhopefully get myself out of this\nsituation but that's exactly what makes\nit feel so hopeless because the hole is\npretty deep and even though again you're\ngiving me great tools it's really hard\nfor me to see the light I guess yeah so\nI think that that's okay so like Mount\nEverest was not climbed in a day\nright yeah no no way so how do you climb\nMount Everest prayer and some tools sure\nand so let's say I'm at the base of\nMount Everest and I have a rosary and I\nhave some crampons and some boots and\ncarabiners what do I do that right\nah\nyou gotta just dig deep somewhere so I\ndon't really want to climb that mountain\nlike sure I want to climb that med well\nwhat do I do I'm sitting at the base of\nMount Everest what do you what I you you\nwalk absolutely right so it's like it's\nsuch a simple answer that it's like hard\nto see but like it's like you could talk\nabout digging deep in psychology like\nyou find your inner self man like you\ngot it you gotta want it no you don't\nknow you you walk you put one foot in\nfront of the other that's how you do it\nit's not some like journey of like\ncoming of age and rediscovering yourself\nyou [ __ ] walk no so that's the\nproblem right is we think that progress\nand life is a [ __ ] fairy tale we\nthink that it's a hero's journey and we\nthink that it's epic and you have to dig\ndeep within yourself you have to do some\nreal Samwise Gamgee level [ __ ] right\nit's like Frodo and Mount Doom and like\noh my god it's like how did Frodo get to\nMount Doom Sam\nwe seen Lord of the Rings yes he just\none foot in front of the oven I'm\nabsolutely one foot in front of other no\nmatter what he guy he got messed up so\nbad\n- yeah and what is the one thing that he\ndidn't stop doing go to that mall yeah\nwhat is what you're right that's it\npeople talk about the orcs they talk\nabout the ring they talk about Sam they\ntalk about Gandalf and like this is a\nstory of putting one foot in front of\nthe other yep no matter what no matter\nwhat that's true so right sky when it\ncomes to getting out of your hole what\nis the most important step you can take\nthe first one incorrect Danna love is\n[ __ ] cuz everyone thinks they have the\nright answers that was such a good one\nthough was a good one\nwhat's the what's the most important\nstep what was the most important step in\nFrodo's journey\nnodding his head like all right let's go\nokay yes and so getting a coalition of\npeople to help him nope those are the\ntools those are the carabiners what's\nthe most important step that Frodo takes\nI don't know I'm so he takes one step\nright so he leaves somewhere is it like\num\nRivendell what's that place yeah yeah so\nhe he puts it he puts he takes one step\nand he steps outside of Rivendell and\nthen would have one that's that's the\nfirst step is that the most important\none\nI'm making it sound like it's not\nbecause I don't think it is you don't\nthink it is okay it feels like it is\nbecause I think that I think when you\ntake a step to anywhere it's\nso it's right it's really hard it's\nreally hard to go back on like a journey\nor a promise you know what I mean like\nif you think so that let's let's make it\nless abstract so you you owe people\nright yeah\nhave you taken one step towards helping\nthem or repaying them uh in some cases\nyes I've been trying that is that them\nthat\nis that so okay so you've taken the\nfirst step towards repairing something\nright some of it yeah not all of it\nobviously and and why isn't that\nrelationship repaired\nbecause over the past four years it's\nbeen like oh yeah give me this and this\nwill happen oh it will great and then\ndoesn't happen yeah I get that so you\nyou need to repair your relationships so\nyou take the first step to repairing\nyour relationships and the relationship\ndoesn't get repaired right so when when\nFrodo steps out of Rivendell is the ring\ndestroyed no okay so what has to happen\nfor him to destroy the Ring what is the\nmost important thing that happens after\nhe steps outside of Rivendell\nhelp no I know I'm asking you okay what\ndoes he have to do after the first step\nsaid again what does he have to do after\nthe first step I mean I'm trying to even\nremember the movie this is a little\nHobbit don't make it complicated okay I\ncan do this okay so but you can do this\nand we're gonna we're not gonna help you\nwe're gonna leave you stranded Oh\nso if if you want to take a piss ah get\nthe let down your zipper so no literally\nyou have to take a piss so you have to\nyou have to go to the bathroom right\nokay and so you the first and you're\nsaying the most important step is the\nfirst step that you take which is you\ngot out of chair and you take one step\nforward then what do you have to do you\nhave to keep walking to the bathroom\nexactly oh okay yes right so what is the\nmost important step after the first one\nsecond step and then what's the the most\nimportant step after the second one the\nthird one until you get to the bathroom\nso the most important step you can take\nis the next step\nyou\ngod damn that is okay I'm here I'm with\nyou now the next step so here's your\nproblem is that you're focused on the\nfirst step and there are times where you\ntake the first step and that that\ndoesn't fix the relationship in there\nare times where the first step is the\nhard steps and there are times where you\ncan take the first step but the first\nstep is the next step\nwhen you're it's when you're at it place\nzero the next step is the first step and\nwe all get caught up in this first step\nbecause of all these like you know epic\njourneys and like it's such simple stuff\nbut it's actually you've been programmed\nto not care about the next step this is\nvery important to understand our mind\nfocuses on the top of the mountain it\ndoesn't focus on the step you have to\ntake your mind focuses on salvation your\nmind focuses on fulfilling everyone's\nexpectations your mind focuses on\ngetting out of jail your mind focuses on\nthe end of the journey and then it\nfocuses on the beginning of the journey\nso we focus on the end of the journey\nand society tells us okay we should you\nshould focus on the beginning of the\njourney not the end and it's actually\nall the [ __ ] in between that is the\nimportant part\nall right so like you've got it just so\nlet's talk about thoughts questions I\nmean just setting the third grenade next\nto the other two it's alright I'm good\nI'm gonna ask you about your weight if\nthat's okay that's totally fine so tell\nme tell me about your weight\nwell I'm huge\nI must\nfive and\n[Music]\npretty much way much as a house think\nright now I think right now I must be\nlike 360 like a circle\nwhich isn't the heaviest I've been\nbut it's like average I guess and um\nyeah go on and so how do you feel about\nthat\nwell I want to be anyone that's not me\nit's like because it's\ncuz I'm not funny fat so it makes it\nhard like I have like I have like a\nmassive ass and thighs and breasts and\nsure that's funny to think about but TV\nglorifies those with like beer bellies\nyou know like big burly men that with\nthe beer in the sports\nthat's funny fat you can get away with\nthat with with me I if I don't have a\nmustache I look like a lesbian I am NOT\nthat isn't you know even a bit like I've\nbeen mistaken for a female so many times\nif I don't have facial hair it is not\nisn't it\nit's crazy so it's like that's more\nfunny to laugh at not with sure and I'm\nactually fine with being the butt of\njokes but not about the door that keeps\nme from success like that you know that\nbe like that's the only thing where I'm\nlike okay well I don't like this either\nyes so Skyy what I'm hearing from you is\nthat like I I do agree I think you've\ngotten very comfortable with becoming\nthe butt of jokes that's like that's\nactually become some of your armor right\nlike and there are a lot of people who\nfor them motivation to get into shape\ncomes from being the butt of jokes\nunfortunately you're not so lucky\nyeah and that you you're you've learned\nhow to wear other people's ridicule like\narmor I just fire back at them to depend\nyeah like if it's my friend yeah we just\ngo toe to toe and and so I I do think\nthat there's something going on so you\nwere kind of saying something about you\nknow this beautiful like super\nsubconscious level stuff about like the\ndoor and and your weight and how the\ndoor is holding you back and like what\nwas that like help me understand that\nit sounded brilliant I just gonna keep\nlike when I think about all the like all\nof my ideas and I daydream about videos\nthat I want to do they're all in a body\nthat's not this and it's because like\nbelieve it or not right I was actually\nas a child extremely athletic so\nwhenever I daydream about things that\nI've been daydreaming about my entire\nlife my body has always looked a certain\nway but then I have to like shelf those\nidea\nso it's like I think about what I want\nto do when I act and oh oh but also um I\nstrangely have a deep amount of pride\nfor the way that I look in public I have\nvery good ass-crack awareness I don't\nlike to wear shirts that show that at\nall I will always when I when I shower I\nhave a whole cycle takes me a long time\nI have been told that I smell good when\nI go to people's houses that have wooden\nfurniture I make sure to sit on the\nfloor\nthis is phat etiquette and so it's like\nI I make all of these adjustments and\nchanges because of how much I don't want\nto be in the body than I am now and I\nfix 8 on every other YouTube channel\nevery other creator because I just feel\nlike I don't know ok that's where I get\nlost\nso Skyy I think you've stumbled upon\nsomething that's very very important ok\nso when you think about when you think\nabout doing all this content you were\nnot in the body that you need to be to\ndo that content right yes so like what\nthat means is that like your life you\nhave an excuse to put your life on hold\nright in the truth right and this is\nreally important like like everyone\nwho's listening like I do this [ __ ] too\nso so we all have these ideas we have\nthese fantasies about what our life is\ngoing to be like but all of the\nfantasies don't start with where we are\nthey start at some point in the future\nand we say that everything begins once I\nget to that once I graduate from college\nor once I get off of academic probation\nor once I lose weight or once this\nhappens then I can start living I am\ngetting absolutely bodied oh yes that oh\nman\nlife begins tomorrow not today\nso you're damn right I think I mean it's\nbeautiful you're the one who put this\ntogether man you were the one who's\nsaying that that your weight is the door\nnow you give me you gave me the sword\nand shield I just okay\noh my god yeah okay Jesus okay III\nthought that was so not common I just\ndidn't think that anyone would be able\nto say it because it whenever I look at\nlike people doing their own thing it's\nlike they're going through this grind\nand I've never really liked oh sorry I\nwas gonna say that I never grinded but\nthat's not true when I wasn't when I\nwasn't on YouTube I've been working jobs\never since I was 14 and by the time I\nwas 17 I was working three restaurant\njobs like throughout my life until about\n22 when this whole thing happened now\nI'm almost 30 so it's like I don't know\nokay you're right about my life being\nput on hold until tomorrow unfortunately\nright what sucks most about weight loss\nis that it really there are some changes\nthat someone can make like let's say I\nwas an alcoholic I could just it's not\nthis easy right but in theory I could\nstop drinking today and then I can\ndeclare myself like okay well I'm off\nalcohol and the changes can happen over\ntime there won't be too many massive\nphysical ones compared to weight loss\nbut with weight it's like well even if I\ntook a stand today and started eating\nhealthy I'm still gonna be in this body\nfor a good amount of time and it is so\nhard to like think that in that time\npeople will still be here waiting or if\nthey should you know I mean\nyeah that's a hard one I think so we're\ngonna talk a little bit about\nspirituality if that's okay let's go\nyeah take me so what do you understand\nwhat the word karma means sky karma no\ncars no Karma\nyeah yes Karma sorry yeah no no that's\nfine I just yeah the comment card\nyou're half brown right yes I'm half\nIndian half black yeah that's why I\nheard it I was like I my understanding\nof it it's not just what goes around\ncomes around like good is that just it\nno no no but I know there's more to it\nokay\nlet's start with what goes around comes\naround so I want you guys to think about\nkarma like planting a seed and growing\nas a tree that bears fruit so we think\nabout creation we think about like\ncreating change right and you're saying\nlike okay like the problem here is that\nwhen I start to do the right thing even\nthough I'm like creating that change\nthat change is delayed so like it's hard\nbecause you're thinking about it like\ncreating a change and you're doing all\nthe right stuff but you're not like\nreaping the rewards yet and it's hard to\ncontinue to be motivated when you're\ndoing stuff and you're not getting\nreinforced positively it's kind of like\nbeing prudent about your 401k like if\nyou just are really like I guess\ndisciplined and things that you do now\nyou get a better future\na matte really yes sort of like that so\nlet's just think about that for a second\nso I think the challenge here is that\nfor a lot of people were motivated by\nstuff going our way like we want out of\nboys we want positive reinforcement\nthat's like a normal part of human\npsychology right so if you're in a job\nin your job your boss says hey you did a\nreally good job today\nlike that's gonna motivate you to work\nhard tomorrow and what I'm hearing from\nyou is that even if you do all the right\nthings as you put it you still have to\nbe in this body for a while even if\nyou're doing the right stuff and that's\nhard so what I want to explain is so I\nthink we need to think about your your\nchange in weight is not something that\nyou do but something that you cultivate\nit's not something you can't create the\nbody that you want to you can cultivate\nthe body that you want to what's the\ndifference between creation and\ncultivation cultivation I guess would\nstem from something lesser in and and\nand and and and kind of nursing it to\nsomething greater whereas creation is\ntaking something from nothing\nyeah absolutely so what do you have more\ncontrol over creation or cultivation\ncultivate\nyeah okay cultivation cuz you can't your\nI can't create a body I can't create\nlife like ah I have to interest I mean\nthat's an interesting take I was\nactually thinking the opposite but I\nthink yours makes sense too yeah so let\nme put it to you this way\nso like if I want to build but I think I\nI think we're actually thinking about\nthe same thing oddly enough probably um\nbut so like if I want to make a plant\ngrow\nlike if I wanted tomato plant and I have\na seed like can I make that plant grow\nin time you can do it whatever whatever\nyou need to do to make it grow can I so\nlet's say I plant it and what do I need\nto do to make it so I take a seat and I\nstick it in the earth and then what do I\nneed to do to make it grow\nwater ok so I water it then does the\nplant grow no I mean it gets water but\nthen it doesn't grow immediately at all\nokay am i gay is it going to grow\neventually\ngod I hope so yeah that's the right\nanswer\nI hope so right because it may not grow\noh yeah know that oh yeah I never\nthought about it not growing\nseed water so that's the that's exactly\nso this is the point sky because we\nthink that if we create a formula for\nsuccess that the success will happen oh\nwe assume that the success will happen\nbut the success actually doesn't happen\nit's not ours to control right so this\nis your whole problem is that your\nperception that you can control your\nweight you can't control your weight all\nyou can control you can't control\nwhether whether the plant grows or not\nall you can control is whether you want\nand this is the hard thing because\nyou're expecting a result you eat\nhealthy one day and you're like where's\nmy [ __ ] tomato plant probably the\nnext day and you're like where's my\n[ __ ] tomato plant\nthe reason I'm eating healthy is because\nI wanted to me like the reason I'm\nwatering this is so that I get the\ntomatoes like where are my tomatoes yeah\nand every day that goes by you do the\nright thing over and over and over again\nfor a week but you have to live in that\nbody for a while right\nyou just can't like this is the thing\nlike so this is the problem with like a\nmindset that's built on positive\nreinforcement which is what our society\nlargely conditions us to do we talk\nabout like you know giving everyone a\ntrophy and all that kind of [ __ ]\nnowadays talk about positive\nreinforcement we don't punish people we\ndon't spank people etc and I'm not\nsaying that that's bad it's just I just\nhave to understand what effects this has\non our psychology so the problem is that\nyou're doing all the right things and\nyou're not seeing the result and\ntherefore you are losing motivation\nbecause your goal is the result which\nmakes sense it's like duh right your\ngoal is to lose weight that needs to\nchange\nyou need to start focusing on the\nactions you can't lose the weight don't\nfocus on the result don't focus on the\nplant because you can't control whether\nthe plant grows like you can't control\nwhether two months from now you get\ndepressed and all of your hard work goes\nto the wind right you can't control that\nwhat can you control\noh [ __ ] something oh darn sorry uh my\nmind is just finding room for the rest\nof the grenades okay that's okay take it\ntake your time\nso I I can control\nwhat I eat absolutely exactly right so\nlike I want you to think about this what\nyou eat which step is that\nstep one sort of yeah sure\nright so it's it's the next step like is\nwhat you eat oh hi Meg said right so you\nsure it's step one because like every\nevery meal is one step and so you can't\ncontrol whether you get to mortar you\ndon't know if you're gonna make it there\nyou don't know what's gonna happen you\ndon't know if you're gonna get abducted\nby orcs you don't know if there's gonna\nbe an earthquake but you can control the\nnext meal\nand if your goal is to lose weight like\nthat's not the right way to do it you\ncould just gotta focus on the next step\nthat's what now Phoenix I product you're\ntaking the right steps exactly this is\nexactly right beautiful word by-product\ngoals and success or byproducts they're\nnot created this is one of the biggest\nthings that's misunderstood in life\nsuccess is a byproduct it's not a goal\nweight loss is not literally so tell me\nI want you to tell me Skyy pretend that\nthat I'm that\ntrying to think about this pretend I'm a\nrobot and that my I want to lose weight\nhow do I lose weight like robots not the\nright word I would say okay like howdy\nhow do you lose weight what do you do\ngive me verbs\nyou eat the right foods yeah and not a\nlot of them okay you drink water yep\nmaybe exercise yeah right so that's not\nlosing weight I want you to understand\nthis very clearly losing weight is not\nsomething you can do\nlosing weight is not a verb\nlosing weight\nis a byproduct of actions\noh my god okay\nthen that means that\nthat means that my II shouldn't\nfocus on getting like a million subs or\nhaving a million views all I can do is\njust make good stuff and the byproduct\nwould be success exactly now you\nunderstand because you're not even\n[ __ ] talking about weight loss\nanymore\nright you're talking about what you can\nactually control and your problem is\nyou're so [ __ ] obsessed with the subs\nthat's not where you're this being\nobsessed with subs does nothing to get\nyou subs focus on the content sure so\nlike it and this is the funny thing is\nif you if you look at your life you've\ndone that before when did you do that\nwhat's the example of when you focus on\nthe content and you gave - you gave no\nshits about your subs in your following\nbase you told me about it earlier today\nthat was that was when I put out a video\nevery day absolutely success is the\nbyproduct it's not the goal\nthis is what Dharma means Dharma means\nduty or responsibility devote yourself\nto the action like when I work in the\nemergency room and I mean I don't do\nthis now but like if someone comes in\nwho's got a heart attack and I think to\nmyself oh [ __ ] this guy's gonna die oh\n[ __ ] this is this guy is gonna die how\ndoes that help me as his doctor what\nmatters is chest compressions right like\nwhether the guy dies or doesn't die like\nI have no control over that what I have\ncontrol over is bop-bop bop-bop bop-bop\nbop-bop stay in life step out real yeah\nthat's that other rhythm that you do it\nto when you're doing chest compressions\nit's good later on I'm definitely in the\npractice so you're saying that when the\ndude comes in with a heart attack you're\nnot thinking about saving his life so\nmuch as you're thinking about doing the\nsteps that have been proven to save\nlives\nthe byproduct that you yeah it's not\neven do it it's doing the next thing\nright does the guy have a [ __ ] pulse\nif he has if he doesn't have a pulse\nwe're gonna do chest compressions if\nhe's got a pulse then we're gonna move\non to the next thing we're gonna check\nhis blood pressure we're gonna check\nthis or check that check his breathing\nbut the most important thing is the next\nthing\nand like I think you fail you tell me if\nif the guy dies and you did everything\nright or you did everything to the best\nof your ability I guess I guess that's\njust life and I guess that just sucks\nhow do you think you feel though\nhonestly I think about this a lot and I\ndon't know how if I actually gave a\nhundred percent to something and then I\nfailed I don't know if I would be upset\nabout it because it's like that's all I\ncould have given like I guess everything\nthat I could\nso Skyy I want you to go back and watch\nthis vaad in earlier we talked about\ngiving it all going on stage and what\nhappening and I fell and what did I say\nthat how are you gonna feel when you do\nthat that I'm not gonna feel too good\nabout it\nbut then what are they saying now and\nnow I'm saying that if I went on stage\nand I gave 100% that I wouldn't feel bad\nabout it absolutely what does that mean\nno that means you understand now what\nyou didn't understand before in an hour\nright go back because I told you\nsomething that you were skeptical about\nI said if you give it your all it\nactually feels fine and you think so\nyou're like I don't think so I think I\nwould feel devastated because I gave and\nnow you know right cuz you did\neverything that you could\nand sometimes you water the tomato plant\nday after day after day and the [ __ ]\ndoesn't grow or well I I haven't done\neverything that I could but I know what\nyou're trying to say absolutely and\nthat's why you deserve regret\noh wow\ndeserve regret yes that is the that's\nthat's my new rap name that is the I\nI've never heard those two words next to\neach other ever so that's the third\nregret that is fascinating to serving it\nbecause you didn't give it your all\nright so like when that guy comes in\nwhen that guy comes into the emergency\nroom and his heart isn't beating there\nis a scenario in which I deserve regret\nand what is that scenario if you didn't\ntry your best\nabsolutely oh my god\ngrenades Nevada nuke Oh Oh God okay this\nis crazy\nI don't even know what does everything\ngood just think that you're doing great\nsky I hope because this is god I was so\narrogant like I was thinking like like\nnow you see your ego excellent yeah but\nokay how do I get rid of that you're\ndoing you're doing it the first thing is\nto recognize it right the first thing is\nto recognize so you didn't even realize\nthat that was ego you thought that that\nwas you you thought it was logical you\nthought it was correct thought it was\nnormal\nyeah like yeah and now you see that\nthere's a different way perfect and\npractically I think you need to instill\nsome confidence in yourself by I was\nabout to say losing weight but not\nlosing weight so you taught me Skyy what\nare what are you gonna do losing weight\nis not something you can do what are you\ngonna do be better that's like way too\n[ __ ] abstract for me I'm going to\nah I mean I guess the first the first\nthing I'll do is like it's so funny that\nif you just looked like right around me\nout of frame is just a desolate\nwasteland of soda and pizza and and just\n[ __ ] so the first thing I'm gonna do is\nprobably clean up all this garbage and\nreplace the food that I have probably\ngoing Quito again that's what I did last\ntime it worked out there is very well it\nworks really well for me or for\neverybody works for me\n[ __ ] and then I'm just gonna do things\none step at a time I'm gonna edit a\nvideo today and what the next step is\njust to make another video I guess if I\njust think of it as just releasing\nvideos instead of having the goal of\ngetting views or subs\nthat's gonna yield a better result yep\nit's probably big so now we get to the\nZen stuff where they're like if you want\nthe best result let go of the result\nwrite this all those like Zen Cohen like\nyou know them to say like you know\nwhat's the sound of one hand clapping\nand it's like weird and paradoxical but\nyeah so you're gonna crumble up it was\nthe one hand clapping thing what it is\nas they ask a question what's the sound\nof one hand clapping that's a pretty\nfamous one I've never heard that best\ntype that's it's called a Cohen so\nCohens are tools that are used to help\nus break out of like the logic of our\nmind because truth is not logical like\nunderstanding is like not logical so\nearlier you had a logical conclusion\nthat giving it your all and falling flat\nwould be devastating\nand that's a logical conclusion because\nwhen you give 50% and you fall flat\nyou hurt 50% and you're protected 50%\nand so when you give 75% and you hold\nback 25% it hurts more than when you\ngive 50% so it's logical to assume that\nif you give a hundred percent you'll be\ncompletely devastated\nbut oddly enough that's not how it works\nso I'm thrilled to hear that you're\ngonna clean your room in edit videos I\nthink somewhere in there you should make\na trip to a grocery store is that doable\nyes okay that logical thing you just\nsaid - yeah I'm just like it's just all\nlike okay sorry it's just crazy fine it\njust it's crazy to think that it felt\nlike this wasn't in my capacity of\nunderstanding and I was just trapped and\nthen I would have just what like how'd I\nnot talk to you just died just just\nthinking these things were true\nthat's terrifying No so don't be\nterrified I mean I understand that it's\nterrifying so you're missing a piece on\nequation right is that like like I'm\nhere though\nand and I'm supposed to be here and this\nis karma this is karma that I owe you\nsomething\nand this is me repaying a debt you owe\nyou owe me something yes\nhmm right so it's my job in life you\nchose this birth and this is like you\nguys don't have to believe this stuff\nit's just a perspective that I find\nuseful that you're your soul are a part\nof yourself set up a life in which there\ngonna be some people who help you out\nand I'm one of those people and this is\nbecause in a previous life when I was\nlike you know had a I don't know what\nthe equivalent of like ancient YouTube\nis but I asked you to sub and you subbed\nand then I didn't make content and so I\nowe you in this that's dead I am\nfamiliar with this yeah well and don't\nworry sky because Frodo\nit was Frodo's job to get to Mount Doom\nright\nFrodo what would have happened if froat\nlike if no one came along\nFrodo what is this good body\nyeah but absolutely but the truth is\nthat like a lot of people came along\nright yes with freed up yes and the good\nnews is that like you're not living life\nalone and that I'm here your community\nis there hopefully some family members\nor people that you love are there and\nthat people will continue to appear in\nyour life to help you out when you need\nit\nhave faith in that that is all things\nthat I believe I am only my last\nremaining obstacle I know that I don't\nknow if we're probably like at a time\nbut I I just want to say\nI hear all of that and and and and now I\nwill say that even in this conversation\nthere have been many mean after this\ncall of course I'm just going to go sit\nin my room and stare at the wall for a\nbit which is good they're all good stuff\num I guess I just need I hope I hope\nthat someone bets on me one more time\nright now of course you know I'm I'm at\nthe end as I've told you before of this\ncycle\nI've downsized the people that I have\nlived with I've I've cut my rent in the\nfourth\nI used to panic just like an incredible\namount now I'm able to save money but\nI'm still out of it so all I'm hoping\nright now is that with the tools that\nyou've given me I know that I can I know\nthat I can be better I mean really I do\nJesus Christ but I'm about to watch the\n[ __ ] again so sky this is very important\nto understand don't let your mind get\ninto this last refuge which is that you\ncan use all of the tools that I'm giving\nyou and is your life going to be\ntransformed\nI mean it is not guaranteed absolutely\nI'm glad you understand that yeah oh\nyeah I mean like there's still a\npossibility that after this like I just\nfail but\nI I guess like I have I personally feel\nlike I have to be fine with it if that\nhappens because the ice like I set\nmyself into this life I made my bed hard\nI gotta lay in it good my dad but I am\ngoing to use your tools and hopefully my\nby-product become success from it so\nabsolutely beautiful so I think that\nlike one last thought that I'll leave\nyou so sometimes I use this analogy with\npeople who are especially recovering\nfrom substances that there's a lag time\nbetween sowing positive karma and\nreaping negative karma that a lot of\ntimes in life like if you've been using\nsubstances for a long time then you have\nlike you've sown all this shitty-ass\nlike fruit that's toxic and it bears it\ngrows into trees and it bears fruit and\nyou're harvesting that nasty-ass fruit\nand you're sowing good seeds you're\nsowing like fresh healthy fruit but\nthere's a lag time where you're doing\nall the right stuff and you're just\ngetting bodied day after day after day\nafter day\nand you just have to like persevere and\nkeep on putting one foot forward and\nthen acknowledge that if you don't\ncontinue sewing bad karma that crop of\nfruit will run out and then you'll be\nlike in in in the good zone\nbut that you buy yourself some amount of\n[ __ ] based on this the Karma that you've\nsown in the past so you buy yourself\nbeing 360 pounds you buy yourself\nexorbitant rent but already you've\nstarted to so good karma you've cut back\non your rent you're thinking about like\ngoing back on keto you're coming on\nstream and you're actually like talking\nabout this [ __ ] which is hard to talk\nabout right so these are positive\nKarma's and like the habits and and sort\nof what consequences of your past\nbehavior still linger and so just be\nprepared for those and you're gonna get\nbodied some but that people will show up\nand people will help you and if you\ncontinue to do the right thing every day\nthat your life will be different\nthat's what I believe\nthoughts questions\nyes but I don't want to I could just\ntalk forever so I don't I just uh I just\ngot to sit with it I guess\nokay so oh go on\nyou want to sit with it I mean I'm just\nsaying I can talk about it I'm lonely\nI'm not clear about how much time we\nhave I I know that it's really not good\nto put like you know I'm not even\npressing anything it's just you know you\nalready know I could just talk for the\nrest of my life so like I don't want to\nwaste your time or you know I'm not\nworried about you wasting my time I do\nthink though that sky that in my\nexperience talking for about an hour if\nwe continue talking you're gonna lose\nthe earlier stuff select the the brain\nhas sort of a bandwidth of like one hour\nof like education at a time or like\ndiscovery so I want you to sit with\nthose my only question is do you want to\nmeditate right now or do you want to\njust have these thoughts in your head\nand process them I am comfortable\ntalking about what I think or whatever\nor discussing it now definitely like I'm\nnever not ready for that it's just this\nis like I mean this is just big okay so\nthen I think just just think give\nyourself time to think and and then\nlet's let's check in yet yeah let's\ncheck in whenever okay yeah you let me\nknow just you know it can be on an off\nstream just let me know cuz this is\nbecause I mean I'll be honest like I\nguess closing thoughts for me then sure\nI would like to believe that people that\nare my fans or followers family friends\nI'd like to believe that that I\ndefinitely actually convinced myself in\nevery way shape and form long before\ntoday something that they may have never\nseen like maybe they don't maybe when I\ngo out on stage they don't see me as\nthey never saw me as falling I never\nfell I thought that I did and I put that\ninto my head and probably made bad\ncontent afterwards because of that but\nit was clouded with the idea that I\nwasn't like that I was an impostor that\nlooked like the person that when I first\nstarted youtube I opposed the video and\nI'm looking I'm responding to no joke\n9,000 comments I'm I'm literally\nresponding to everybody and now I don't\ndo that I can't even look at my channel\nso it's like this is how this just has a\nlot and and I I look forward to the\nfollow-up I promise you nothing of what\nwas said in the US and I'm going to\nwatch this bod so much that I might\nmemorize it like okay so Skyy I'm gonna\nleave you with one last burden okay oh\nso oh sweet yeah I know so I'm at least\nI'm being transparent about it so\nunderstand that people are watching\nright and I I think that what's gonna\nhappen with people are watching is like\nsome of them are getting voyeuristic\npleasure out of it some of our getting\nsome of them are getting intellectual\npleasure out of it some of them are\nwondering like there's stuff that you're\nsaying that resonates with them there's\nthings that are coming out of your mouth\nare there things about your life that\nthey feel are true of their lives and\nthey're wondering whether change is\nactually possible they're wondering\nwhether change is like that they're\nwondering like is this irreversible or\nis there hope who do you think bears the\nresponsibility for showing them that\nthere's hope the answer me yes me is\nright there the person who's getting\nwheeled into the emergency room after a\nheart attack and you're the guy who's\ngonna do\ncompressions that's your Dharma that's\nwhat you owe them I owe them a lot\nyeah biblical amount so don't let him\ndown and grow I get one yep yep it's\nwrong work man\nthanks for coming on thank you what you\nwant to just tell people about your\nchannel real quick sure everyone hi my\nlast four years have been me crying but\nI make fun videos I do gameplay videos\nwith friends and I do vlogs and\nhopefully my channel
