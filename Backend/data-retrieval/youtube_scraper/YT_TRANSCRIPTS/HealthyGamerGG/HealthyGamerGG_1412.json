    "transcript": "so it's almost like your life is like\nyou've gotten to the age of 30 and\nyou're in reckful z-- life but you like\nyou're at the airport of your life but\nyou left your bag at home\nhow are you so the day after we talked\nlast time yeah I felt a lot better I\nthink I might message you about it yeah\nI woke up I felt more whole yeah great\num then I remember having a moment\nthough okay this is gonna sound really\ngovernment I was sad the day after that\nand I remember being like oh I'm not\nfixed obviously I'm not it's not\npermanent\nthere's no permanent fix to sound is\ngonna be up and down right it's just a\ndumb thought but I remember having that\nthought and being like ah you know even\nthough it just it's just an automatic\nthing to think yeah but why do you think\nthat that's a dumb thought it's a dumb\nthought because human emotion is always\ngonna be up and down right I'm not gonna\nbe happy forever\nyeah but I mean I is crazy as it sounds\nI don't I don't think that's a dumb\nthought I think it's actually the\nopposite I think it's an important\nrealization right so sometimes sometimes\nwhen when you have you know a powerful\nmoment and life you feel transformed and\nthen the next day rolls around and\nyou're like oh [ __ ] we're back to square\none and that's actually like I'm glad\nyou feel that way because I think part\nof so you know this this is not about\ncuring people this is about teaching you\nhow to go in and out of the water so\nlike you had you felt really good for a\nday and then you went you notice that\nlike there were things about you that\nare still the same and so like the whole\nprocess of I think growth and healing is\nactually like is like having good days\nand then bad days and good days and then\nbad days and each time you learn how to\nmove from one to the other and then over\ntime you get better at like moving back\nand forth and then you get to control\nwhether your days are good or your days\nare bad\nthis makes sense yeah yeah I've been\nwaking up every day every day for the\nlast week I've been waking up and I\nstart out in a I'd call it a sad state I\nstarted out in a sad state and I always\nhave like this faint memory of some\ndream that was really annoying like I\nwas in an airport and lost my luggage\nlike these kind of just so I think that\nkind of affects the feeling when you\nwake out maybe a little bit then uh then\nI'm waking up and I'm like I'm like I'm\nit's probably most people probably wake\nup a little sad cuz you have a little\nenergy a little maybe I don't know sure\nthen uh house I'm getting from my day\nand starting to do some things I find\nfulfilling like talk to Tyler who's my\nfriend who works on everything um then\nI'm feeling better and then uh after we\nstopped working for the day then I go\ninto slump for a bit and then I try to\nreach out to friends to hang out and if\nthey hang out with me then I'd go back\nin a happy time and then I get a little\nlonely and then I go to bed and that's\nmy day yeah so yeah you're I'm gonna\nhave to apologize because some of the\ninterviews are starting to blur together\nbut didn't we talk a little bit about\nhow you had periods of time where you\ndistract yourself from your base state\nand then you kind of get tired of doing\nso I mean I think this is this is so\nreckful this is all fantastic actually I\nmean I realize I say this way too much\non screen but people will tell me\nsomething really [ __ ] depressing\nabout their life don't be like that is\nfantastic what I think is fantastic is\nthat you're noticing the patterns of\nyour life okay right yeah they're\nnoticing what's going on and the\ntheories that we developed last time\nwhich is that you have this basic state\nof like unhappiness where you do like\nfulfilling stuff or distracting stuff\nand that kind of distracts you from that\nbut then you kind of like come back to\nlike your you're like neutral which is\nsad which we're gonna get into but I\nthink it's really important to recognize\nthat like you you're gonna have just to\nunderstand what's going on in you that\nyou can do like dharmic\nyou can do work that you find fulfilling\nand that makes you feel good and you can\nalso hang out with friends and that\nmakes you feel good but when you're\nalone and by yourself it sounds like you\nfeel sad yes and I actually view that as\nokay I think about it like from I guess\nan evolutionary standpoint that humans\nneeded other humans around them to\nsurvive and pass on their genes so if\nyou didn't have other humans around you\nyou'd be unhappy maybe it's like why do\nyou do that driver because I mean so\nlike yeah sure so I mean I'm a scientist\nbut I mean I say sort of [ __ ] that\nbecause the whole goal here is for you\nto be peaceful and happy when you were\nalone right is your basic state to be\npeaceful and happy like that's the goal\nthat would be awesome but yeah that\nwould be awesome but then I I do like\nthis feeling that I can if I feel\nterrible I'm like oh it makes sense I\ncan step back and be like oh it makes\nsense I'm alone human beings were meant\nto be in tribes not alone so that's huge\nbut I think the key thing there is not\nthe rationale but your capacity to step\nback and accept the way that you feel to\nnot judge yourself for the way that you\nfeel hmm\nso the reason you do it is fine I mean\nwhether it's evolutionary or whatever\nlike I you know that's great but I think\nthe important thing is that when you're\nfeeling sad this I think is a little bit\ndifferent is that I think you're you\nexcept that you feel sad and you kind of\nare okay with that\nin a sense yeah I'm somewhat okay with\nit so tell me about that tell me what\nyou mean by somewhat okay with it I can\nimagine okay well I definitely didn't oh\nman when I was in high school or 20 or\nsomething I didn't see I didn't imagine\nthat when I'm 30 I'll be a person who's\nalone this often I didn't think that\nwould happen and\nI think that kind of thought in itself\nmakes me a little more sad mm-hmm and I\nshould just take things day by day more\num III think streaming I have a lot of\njustifications for it I mean in my in my\nhead I'm like okay well streaming as a\njob is very isolating you end up you do\ntalk to people on the internet but you\nend up sitting in your room 10 hours a\nday many years in a row sometimes seven\ndays a week I did before\nand there's not not gonna make a look\nnot gonna make a lot of funds like that\nyou know and then if you want to talk to\nother people who are streamers who are\nin the same field usually people meet\npeople at their career but the other\nstreamers are just as busy streaming all\nthe time also so then I can't really\nexpect them to give me their time\nyou're gonna sit me yeah reckful I have\na couple of just simple questions for\nyou\nwhere what part of the world do you live\nin in the u.s. I'm in Texas right now I\nused to be in California how much\nexposure to sunlight do you get I get a\nlot so I walk every day I step I just\nactually look at my screen for a walk\nlike a week ago but I walk outside for\nlike five miles actually a day okay okay\nso you get point because I mean you\ncould just be like vitamin D deficient\nyou know my dad always thought that -\nyeah but I mean my God every time he\nvisits me or I visit him he just hands\nme this vitamin D pills from Costco I\nmean if you're getting if you're walking\nfive miles a day that's that's what like\nan hour and a half of walking yeah yeah\nI just brainstorm while doing it yeah\nwhat's your what's your ethnicity I'm\nIsraeli okay so so people who have\ndarker skin so people who are Israeli or\nMiddle Eastern or Indian or African or\nAfrican American we have lower our\nvitamin D apparatuses are not as\nefficient as people who are Caucasian\nand that's just because we were\nbombarded by sunlight like all the time\nwhich is why it makes me longer to get\nvitamin D yes okay so so like but still\nshouldn't be a problem in taxes but in\nthe Northeast for example like I'm\nIndian so I'm almost certainly vitamin D\ndeficient because my vitamin D like\napparatus is not is efficient to someone\nwho's Scandinavian by origin yeah okay\nso let me just kind of recap a little\nbit about what I heard so it sounds like\nthings are moving in a positive\ndirection that you're able to accept and\nunderstand that sometimes you still feel\nsad you're also able to this is really\nimportant sort of see how your life has\ninfluenced as you make the careers of\nthe career that you committed to it has\ncreated the situation that your life\nisn't now which is like somewhat lonely\nyeah that's I mean so what I'm hearing\nfrom you is that you say sad but what\nI'm hearing is is lonely\nI equate that I relate those two are\nvery related to me okay the feeling of\nloneliness it makes me sad yeah but I\nmean a lot of things make someone sad\nbut what I'm hearing from you is like\nthe the meaning of sad or the origin of\nsad is really loneliness like when you\nwake up in the morning and you feel sad\nokay knowingness because I just\nremembered when you said that I\nremembered I was at twitchcon at a party\nand I tweeted I'm in a room full of\npeople but I've never felt so alone\nsomething like that and uh I guess I\nequated to not relating to people near\nme maybe yeah so so I think let's\nremember that being alone and being\nlonely are like two different things\nokay yeah yeah\nso what's the difference um well you can\nfeel lonely you can feel lonely if what\nI just said though if you feel lonely\nfor not relating to people around you\nright or you don't feel a close\nconnection with them yeah even if you're\naround people and when you wake up in\nthe morning like what what do you mean\nby feeling sad can you help me or us\nunderstand that yeah I want to try to\nokay I want to try to word it better so\nlet's say I'm not trying we put really\nput myself in a situation just woke up I\nwake up and I'm like already nervous\nabout something or anxious is the word\nmaybe sure and I don't know what it is\nand then I think that maybe it's the\ndreams but I don't remember then I I\nlike to not look at my phone too quickly\nwhen I wake up because I realized that\nalready kind of puts me in a bad state\nof mind so I just sit there and like\nbreathe and think for a little bit\nand then when I finally do look at my\nphone I like go through some message I\nmight have gotten I don't really get\nthat many but you know that I respond as\npeople and then sometimes uh-hmm I'm\nwalking myself through it but I'm not\nreally getting anything okay um I'm just\ncurious about dreams do you have dreams\nthat are kind of like negative you sort\nof always negative things bad things\nhappen to you in your dreams\nyeah dreams of flying or falling falling\nyeah falling okay not flying and like if\nI remember them it's it's some weird\nthings like I was falling and I woke up\nyeah\nwhat about dreams of I don't know how to\nsay this but not so like persecution\nisn't the right word but like dreams of\nlike disappointing people or like being\nlike I don't know how to describe this\nbut like dreams of like showing up to\nclass and forgetting that like\nforgetting your homework at home does\nthose are my most common type okay\nshowing up there's always something I\nforgot somewhere I am I don't have\nsomething I'm not yeah exactly that's\nthe feeling well I mean maybe a lot of\npeople do I thought when I just was at\nthe airport and I like lost my bag or\nsomething it's hard to remember exactly\nwhat it was or just something was lost\nwhile I was there and I just kept he was\nan it was so long I just kept looking\nfor it forever and I just couldn't ever\nfind it and I was just stuck in this\nloop for so yeah okay yeah so let's just\nput a pin on that for a second so and\nwhen you feel sad like let's say let's\ntalk about going to bed then when you go\nwhen you go to bed how do you feel\ndepends on the day I guess if I feel if\nthe specific day I felt like I'm made\nsome progress toward my game finishing\nor back before when I see a stream a lot\nif I stream that day and I liked the\nstream I'm going to yeah or if I hung\nout with some people who were I felt a\nconnection with like a friends or\nwhatever um then I'll go to bed it like\nmore fulfilled and calm and a lot of\ntimes I'll just go to bed though uh go\nto bed a little bit lonely I mean ya\nknow how else to describe it I think\nthat's a good word so I think I'm gonna\ntry to offer something else\nI think there's loneliness there and I\nthink there's also life not turning out\nthe way you thought it would like this\nis not the life that you expected to be\nliving yeah I feel like it could be a\nlot better and it doesn't seem like it\nwould be that difficult to get there I\ncould have more friends around somehow\nI've tried to force it to happen\nsometimes like really try to get people\nto move to be near me and things like\nthat like friends to do that yeah but\nit's led to bad situations when I did it\nyeah\ngive me just a second okay yeah yeah so\nit's almost like your life is like\nyou've gotten to the age of 30 and\nyou're in reckful z-- life but you like\nyou're at the airport of your life but\nyou left your bag at home like this is\nnot how things were supposed to wind up\nyou know it's like this this is not it's\nnot that anything is like wrong per se\nlike everything else is right but\nthere's just like one thing that's just\nmissing like this is just not how things\nwere supposed to be and not enough\nfriends around and I think the challenge\nhere reckful is that you know we can in\na bizarre way I'm gonna actually ask you\nto kind of move past a lot of what we\ntalked about last time so I think living\na life of Dharma and like building\nEverland and stuff like that is actually\nreally important I think it's good that\nyou're doing it and I want you to just\nnotice that I think to a certain degree\nlike that's your that's your medicine\nand the problem here is that like as\nlong as your life is the way it is\nyou're always gonna need medicine to\nmake it feel better\nthe goal is yet okay but we the goal is\nthe goal is I feel good without medicine\nexactly right so like it I don't I\nreally don't see that ever happening and\nI know that's part of the problem no\nit's not it's not part of the problem no\nno no so don't do that to yourself don't\nyou don't judge yourself no I think it's\nit's a completely reasonable logical and\nintelligent conclusion because you have\n30 years that have told you it's not\ngonna happen so why the [ __ ] would you\nlike so this is this is where like I\ndon't like this power of positive\nthinking and like you know hope and I\nmean like hope is good but like let's\nunderstand what where hope comes from\nwhat so I think this is yeah no I don't\nthink that's part of the problem that's\nfantastic that's where we start so let\nme so what I'm getting from you reckful\nis that there is just a seed of like\ndiscontent that is actually like pretty\ndeep yeah that no matter like what you\ndo you can start to feel better but\nthere's just this one thing that you\ncan't shake yes so and and you know\nthere's a there's someone else who kind\nof and you're pretty successful like\nwould you describe yourself that way\num I go in and out of thinking I'm\nsuccessful not let me put it this way do\nyou think that other people would be\nhappy to be in your shoes without my\nmental state yes\nokay the circumstance they have their\nmental state yeah yeah yeah and I do\nhave some questions for you about like\nyour relationships and things like that\nbut I'm just gonna save those for a\nlittle bit later so like you know who\nelse kind of felt like you did really\nfamous person there's a religion that's\nsort of based off of teachings there's a\nreligion based as long as teachings of\nConfucius no would that oh okay we're\ngonna talk a little bit about Buddha for\na second so what do you know about very\nlittle\nalthough wait um okay wait I read the\nbook\nSiddhartha or something okay when I was\ndo you know what what like what was\nblood this job do you remember I feel\nlike he was like a prince or something\nand then he left us that no bill yeah he\nwas a nobility and then he left\nand Truckee wasn't happy there and then\nthey just wandered around so let's stop\nright there that's that's fantastic\nreckful so why did it why was he unhappy\ndo you remember what do you think felt\nunfulfilled I did imagine ya just\nsitting there he was born into wealth he\ndidn't have to do anything uh he wants\nto somehow feel like he's helping the\nworld and some way maybe yeah but he\nwasn't something like that yeah so I\nthink this is so you're in a very I\nthink you know you kind of say you're in\na hopeless position but I think that\nyou're in a in a difficult but wonderful\nposition which is that you're in you're\nin the position that Gotham would this\nstarted off with which is he woke up one\nday and we have we all have this idea\nthat a certain thing is gonna give us\nhappiness like and this is easy if\nyou're one of the have-nots right like\nif I wake up and I'm poor and I'm broke\nand I have like credit card debt and I'm\nwe're gonna get evicted at the end of\nthe month and no one loves me then like\nit's easy to think if someone loves me\nor ideal like if the credit card debt\ngoes away or if I have stable housing or\nthings like that then I'll be happy with\nme so then then you always have yeah you\nalways have a progression path when you\nhave a progression want yeah what was\nwhat this progression path he when he\nwas a nobility doesn't know what it's\nlike would this like he's he's\nnobility's a prince he's respected he's\nloved he has power he has wealth he's\nmarried to a beautiful woman with others\ndown the line should he want them yeah\nand so\nhe wakes up and he's unhappy and he is\nway more [ __ ] than the broke person\nwhy\nwell this is really funny you asked me\nbecause I had a one time I got clipped\nsaying being poor seems fun and it was\nreally bad did the people like it that\nwere really mad at me yeah but I just\nwasn't context there sure those thing\nthere's a progression path for you yep\nyou have something to do which is\nexactly we're talking about so yeah so\nwait why is what the more screwed than\nthe person who's broke because he has he\ndoesn't know what to do to seek\nfulfillment exactly in fact he has done\neverything to see like all of the goals\nthat people strive for that give them\nmeaning and progression in life but that\nis just [ __ ] because he's gotten all\nof those things and it's like well now\nwhat it's like imagine playing a game\nthat you beat and the game doesn't end\nlike that is the most [ __ ] boring\ngame in the world depends on the game\nbut yeah sometimes right well no I mean\nlike imagine there's like nothing like\nyour post the last boss and you're like\nin the chamber where you've like slain\nthe last boss and you're just hanging\nout okay yeah okay there's nothing to do\nin the game yeah you'd have to be able\nto go back to previous levels yeah but\nlike that's not that you know that's not\nlike I mean so would that could in\ntheory I guess he could go and and well\nthat's what he did right is he he gave\nup his welfare you gave up what about\nthe previous levels yeah he didn't do\ngame plus right yeah and and so I think\nthis is a subtle but important point\nbecause I think that and so there's a\ngreat text called Patanjali Yoga Sutras\nand so sutras are translated as like\nthreads or lines there so like the old\nlike Hindu and Buddhist texts or Sutra\nso they're not like texts they're like\nthey're like poems or they're like\nhundreds of lines long so they're each\nlike kind of like an equation so there's\nnot like any filler there's no\nexplanation there's no it's like all\nlike equals a MC squared y equals MX\nplus B like it's just a bunch of\nequations and the idea and the reason is\nbecause they were passed down through\noral tradition\nthey had to be memorized so like if you\nif you can memorize 50 equations like\nyou can understand algebra and you can\nteach algebra and things like that does\nthat make sense I was trying to follow\nwell while I was trying to follow I\nrealized I had to pee and then I was\nlike why am I getting distracted by this\nand then also your mic cut out one time\nand I got a strike okay so go pee go pee\nbut just kind of going back to sutras\nso like sutras are there they're like\nlines so they're very short and there's\na weird thing in Patanjali yoga sutras\nwhich is that the first word of his\nsutras is now and it's kind of a weird\nthing like if you have a if you have\njust like a list of it like math\nequations like the word now doesn't\nbelong there does that make sense like\nif you ever read a book that starts with\nthe word now I remember what word most\nbooks start with like like there's no\ntextbook that's like now we're gonna\ntalk about algebra like that's something\nthat you say if you're making a\ntransition but like no written thing\nstarts with the word now okay\nthis reminds me of the power of No yeah\nwell that's that cart toll right yeah\nbut so the interesting thing about it\nand so a lot of times people were\nwondering like for Patanjali who's his\nhis sutras are like really really dense\nso for example one of his sutras or one\nof the lines of his sutras is great is\nsays that Yoga is something that's yoga\nchitta vritti nirodh aha' which means\nYoga is the practice of cessation of\nfluctuations of the mind it's a practice\nof cessation of fluctuations of the mind\nyes that's the point of Yoga is to stop\nthe fluctuations of the mind so it's\nlike really like dense kind of like\nmeaningful sort of things and so it's\nweird that he starts with the word now\nbecause and people were like why on\nearth is he saying now like isn't it\nobvious when you pick up a book that\nyou're reading the book to make it more\npresent do you think about the present\nmoment maybe so on the contrary so like\nwhat what people sort of hypothesized is\nthat actually he says that Yoga starts\nwith desperation\nthat like now so is his first line is\nnow the science of yoga and reckful I\nthink now you are ready for yoga because\nyou have reached a point where like\nnothing else is giving you happiness and\nthat is when the path of yoga begins\nit starts out of desperation your it\nstarts with wood the wood though like\nwhat wheat what most of us think of as\nthe endgame is like beating the game is\nwhere Buddha started and Buddha's\njourney of yoga oh yeah like Buddha's\npath for enlightenment began at the end\nof most people's games right he achieved\neverything or was given everything that\nmost people strive for and so like the\nsearch for spirituality starts like\nactually when your material desires are\nfulfilled and you wake up one day and\nyou're unhappy so then you're like oh\n[ __ ] now like I'm just [ __ ] I don't\nthink that this is ever gonna get better\nthat's the conclusion you come to\nbecause all of the things that you think\nare gonna make it better or things that\nmaybe on some level you already have\nright so I think like the other thing\nhere is like I'm not I'm curious about\nyour relationships cuz that's not\nsomething that I know anything about but\nI wonder about your sense of loneliness\nand better relationships yeah but\ngenerally speaking I think this is\nactually a great place to start because\nyou're sort of desperate because nothing\nis gonna fix your problem and that's\nwhen you really go looking so that was\nanother long time yes and Buddha was too\nand then but they decided I don't think\nyou need to do this but but they decided\nthat he was like I'm gonna I'm gonna\ngive this up and go look for an answer\nbecause I've heard out there that there\nare ways people who supposedly claim\nthat they can lead to like peace and\ncontentment and I'm gonna go look for\nthat and all this stuff is not bringing\nme happiness I didn't do it to the same\nextent Saul riding around I didn't do it\nto the same extent but I just like stop\nstreaming go travel do things that\npeople say make some happy things like\nyeah\nand so you've explored just like would\nthe did and now you need to start the\npath of yoga which is like sadhana\nsaadon that means like dedicated\nspiritual practice so this is like\nlearning how to and you know we can talk\nabout how you can do that but like so\nthe path that I follow is something\ncalled Raja yoga and Raja Yoga is the\nkings path or the Eightfold Path and it\nbelieves that the way\nto get to enlightenment is like a\nstepwise sequential thing you level up\nbasically it starts with personal\nobservances and societal observances\ngoes to yoga postures breathing\ntechniques sensory deprivation or\nsensory withdrawal techniques which is\ntechniques that allow you to withdraw\nthe attention from your senses too and\nredirect it inward so generally speaking\nour attention like is engaged in the\nsenses all the time so to redirect that\ninward to focus to meditate and then to\ngain a state of temporary enlightenment\nI when you said breathing I realized the\nway I breathe\nany time I find myself and start\nmanually breathing I feel instantly\nhappier yes I think the way I breathe my\nautomatic breathing can I train my\nautomatic breathing to be in a better\nway\nor is it too late yes because it's\nalways like short breaths you know yep\nbut when I really think about it and\nbreathe deep I feel calmer yeah so\nthat's exactly why the fourth step of\nthis process is Brown I am Brown I am is\nbreathing techniques and the reason is\nbecause the way to control the mind is\nthrough the breath so but Anjali figured\nout that each mood that we have and I've\ndone this before on screen but we can do\nit again because by the way our stream\nis blown up gigantically since our time\ntogether so thank you for that but we\ncan do this again so like let's just\ntalk about breath for a second let's\nhelp you understand breathing and what\neffect it has on your mind and what the\nrelationship between mind and breath is\nso first of all reckful what do you\nthink is the relationship between your\nmind and your breath\nhmm well I guess the breaths are the\nfood of the mind right what does that\nmean it means the oxygen surely to the\nair so I'm gonna offer a couple of very\ndifficult ground rules no philosophy no\nTheory no science just experience okay\nokay that's better I like the better\nokay so let me write what is the\nrelationship between your breath and\nyour mind well like I was saying if I am\nmy automatic breathing he always feels a\nlittle hurried and if I take a moment\nand breathe deeper then I feel calm\nso I guess my state of mind depends on\nhow I'm breathing to some extent I I\nwouldn't say that the outside influences\ndon't matter at all because some people\nwill go to that extent but for me that\nisn't true sure but uh so breath\ninfluences mind yes it does influence it\nfor sure does mind influence breath yes\nokay so so are there certain patterns of\nso let me ask you this I want you to I'm\njust gonna breathe and I want you to\ntell me what I'm feeling nervous or I\nguess people call it anxious or you're\nscared maybe even okay now this one what\nis that\ndo it again I think that's just tired\njust you've worked out or something okay\nthat's not it it's not what I was going\nfor but that's okay okay that's fine\nso let's do this one it\nright so let's just think about this for\na second okay let me try to see if I can\ndo another one okay I'm gonna do a\ncouple of difference you're a little\nworried about something absolutely right\nlittle worried about some then there's\nthis you're starting to be afraid yeah\nright so worried and fear so just let's\njust think about what you're doing right\nnow how are you able to determine what\nis going on in my mind what are you\nobserving the breath well maybe a little\nbit of facial expression too but it's\nthe breath right I could do it with the\neyes closed I think yeah yeah actually\nyou were doing it better with eyes\nclosed like there was a time I don't\nknow if you noticed but what do you\nclosed your eyes and you listened and\nthat's when you could tell right so it's\nkind of weird and then so the first\nthing to understand is that like there\nare patterns of breath that are\nassociated with certain moves so now the\nquestion is is it a two-way street if I\nadopt a pattern of breath that is\nanxious or fearful will I become anxious\nor fearful I think you will become a\nlittle more anxious and fearful yes\nabsolutely right so now let's think\nabout that what does that mean for the\nmoods that you experience reckful well\nit means I can start a pattern of\nbreathing that will make me more calm\nand maybe I could achieve the serenity I\nwant absolutely\nthat yeah so you I mean this all started\nbecause you discovered this on your own\nyou said oh [ __ ] sometimes like when I'm\nfeeling bad I noticed that my breaths\nare shallow and if I change the way that\nI breathe I feel better instantly and as\na whole humanity understands this\nbecause what do we tell people who are\nfreaking out take a deep breath\nabsolutely right and look why the [ __ ]\ndoes that like why do we say that is\nthat just like societal or is there some\nphysiology from dollars we learned over\nthousands of years we keep back\nabsolutely it's [ __ ] it's not rocket\nscience right it's just like hey man\nlike slow the [ __ ] down take a few deep\nbreaths tell me what's going on right\nthat's what we tell people and then the\nmind-blowing thing is that that that\nthis [ __ ] works that it actually works\nand so if you can control your breath\nwhich is what the practice of brown I am\nis then you can control your mind so\nthere are a couple of things that we're\ngonna tunnel down a little bit further\nokay so what are the different qualities\nof breath so like how do i how do I like\nthe different patterns of breathing that\nI was giving you what are the different\nthings that how are those things\ndifferent how are those patterns of\nbreath different like what are the\nqualities of them like what are the\nstats or attributes of different\nbreathing patterns mean excellent\nperfect that's it\ngot it beautifully enough okay so let's\njust think about this if I am breathing\nrapidly and shallowly\nwhat emotion do you think that is\nworried absolutely right\nso if I'm breathing shallowly and slow\nwhat emotion do you think that is\nshallowly and slow shelley and [ __ ] a\nrare one it's net weight shallow and\nslow pay attention to yourself because I\nbreathe you breathe that way a lot I\nthink you breathe that way in the\nmorning in at night oh man really okay\nwell I know my feeling but that's not\neveryone else's fact my feeling is like\ncares about everyone else's feeling okay\nso my feeling that I'm having when I'm\nbreathing this way is I need to be ready\nat any moment I need to be ready at any\nmoment to answer someone with something\nthey'd like can we just call it being at\nthe airport without your bag not sure\nokay what's that anxiety maybe it's\nanxiety but uh what I'm feeling okay\nlike a lot of times I'm hanging out with\npeople and I put this pressure on myself\nto be the person who keeps the\nconversation going so I'm having these\nkind of breaths that I'm kind of ready\nto fill the shallows empty space okay so\nI think there's something I don't know\nif you want to turn to chat at some\npoint we can also remove chat to help us\nout or we are talking what do you think\nwe should do charts interesting let's\nsee what they're saying so chat what do\nyou guys think that shallow and slow is\nwhich is weird because generally we\nthink about shallow and and it's like if\nwe're breathing slowly we associate that\nwith long a lot of people said sad or\nanxiety but I feel like I breathe like\nthat all the time yeah so I think that's\non the sadness spectrum and that anxiety\nis more like rapid and shallow right\nwhen I think about someone who's anxious\noh man and then just like kind of slow\nbreaths that are more shallow I think of\nas more of sad someone with spending\ninsecurity which is not false not false\nso there I mean I'm simplifying the\nbreath but they're there all kinds of\nnuances to the breath which we can dig\ninto further and further and further\nthere's a whole branch of yoga called\nsoiree yoga which is all about the\ndifferent mechanisms of breath and they\neven get so not only like which nostril\nis more open than the other because that\ncorrelates with mood like right now\neveryone thinks that both of their\nnostrils are open all the time but one\nof your nostrils is open at a time usual\nand like which one are your nostrils is\nmore open can you tell the right one\nokay\nso we'll check and if you want you if\nyou want to switch it you let me know\nI'll show you how to switch it so\nthey're there more so we're gonna sort\nof start with some people I don't know\nright now how do you switch it okay I\nmean it's it's gonna interrupt the flow\nof the stream though because it takes\nsome time but we can do it yeah I mean\nwe could do it if y'all want to so this\nis this will be our formal meditation\ntechnique at the end of the art tak talk\ntoday okay someone it's that's it left\ngame later okay there sing later yeah so\nthen then let's let's go through a\ncouple of other emotions so what is\nrapid and deep breaths what emotion is\nthat what would you guys say that is\nthere's think panic or anger all right\nso I'll show you one more time reckful\nwhat is yeah I is this the one that I\nsaid you just worked out and I messed up\nor no just what do you think it is\nforget about what you said earlier you\njust you just got past something hard\nokay I mean that's what I would but\nthat's just me specifically yeah so I\nthink this is important so I'm talking\nlike I have answers but it's important\nto remember that everyone's perspective\nis gonna be different and so you guys\nshould explore this for yourself so in\nmy mind that's anger so when I what I do\nwhen I create that pattern of breathing\nis I think about something that no I\ndon't hang out with a lot of angry\npeople I don't think that's okay yeah so\nthe other thing is one person some\npeople in my chat said sex and I think\nsex is a spectrum so if you breathe\ndeeply and a little bit more slowly than\nanger then I think it's arousal right\nthat's how you get the sex it's just a\nlittle all I have to do is breathe a\nlittle deeper than lust lust so this is\nthis is lust right so okay\noh the eyebrow is involuntary because\nit's like yeah so so that's that's like\nthat's arousal so arousal is also kind\nof an emotional state so we can look at\nother things right and then there's\ncalmness which is sort of like then\nthere's chilled out and then there's\nlike calm which are two different things\nlike there are so many gradations of the\nstate of our mind so chill this is kind\nof like you know we're gonna we're gonna\nsmoke weed and we're gonna chill out and\nwe're gonna like you know like just\nthat's like the as I killed out and then\nthere's like true like sort of peaceful\nkind of like meditative breathing right\nand if you do this you're gonna have\nlike a respiratory rate of like four per\nminute there's one time in my life I\nremember I was in Amsterdam and I had\njust done a very big mushroom dose but\nit was after it ended and I was sitting\nin a Chinese restaurant with a cup of\ntea and it was the most peaceful I ever\nfelt I've never experienced this feeling\nagain I want to be there yes so that's\nwhat needs to change right so I think\nthat like we could talk about the hunt\nof all all you want to we can talk about\ngetting you know we can talk about like\ntreatment of depression and sadness but\nI think at the end of the day reckful\nwhat needs to change for you to truly be\nnot lonely anymore\nit needs to like you need to cultivate\nthat part of yourself you need to give\nyourself that experience time and time\nand time again and just like your breath\nthrough which you can train like\nvoluntarily first and eventually it\nbecomes involuntary kind of like driving\nright like when we learn a skill I\nreally want to be involuntary I would\nlove that but I yes how much training do\nyou think huh I mean I want to do it no\nmatter what but how much time will it\ntake for my breath to involuntarily be\ndeeper and slower so science says\nsomewhere around eight weeks I'd say it\nsomewhere around a year yeah a year okay\nlike so talk about what I'm talking\nabout is not even science that's beyond\nscience but science all of the clinical\ntrials that look at meditation for\ntreatment of depression and anxiety and\nthings like that show a clinically\nsignificant all of the effect sizes and\naverage all of the duration of trials\nthere are 12-week trials there are four\nweek trials there are six week trials or\neight-week trials basically like my\nconclusion is that if you average all\nthat [ __ ] together the average person\nneeds eight weeks have dedicated\nmeditative practice to create a\nclinically significant improvement in\ndepression or anxiety so my answer to\nyou is very long eight weeks but I think\nthat that's for depression or anxiety I\nthink to get to what we're talking about\nwhich is looking at your cup of tea is\ngonna take way longer you may have\nmoments but you want to be able to like\nhave that sense of peace within you and\nI think that's really what you're what\nis missing so I think like you don't you\ndon't there's something like missing in\nyou like something fundamental and this\nI don't think it's necessarily like go\nahead I was gonna say what are you\nfeeling\nyou hit me that's it\nokay so just notice yourself\nnotice your breathing\nso as you change the breath the mind\nchanges yeah you don't have to change\nthe mind you decide whether you want to\nfeel what you're feeling and let the\nbreath be natural or you want to control\nthe breathing I'm fine okay good job\nso what so let's just think about what\njust happened right so like something\nyou felt something something resonated\nand then the emotions came up your mind\nstarted to think and experience certain\nthings are not quite sure what and using\nthe breath you restrained or calm to\nthose feelings and you know I think last\ntime I guess the track we got on was to\nexplore those feelings this time I want\nto teach you something else so it's not\nnecessarily about exploring those\nfeelings right now unless you want to\nbut I think\nleave that there's that whatever in me\nthat's missing that I can fill it so\nthis is the other really important thing\nto understand that thing within that is\nmissing within you is also a calling\nI think I have the calling though now I\nfeel like I have four career feeling I\nfeel like I have it what I want yes so\ncalling is about more than a career\nright so this is something within you\nthat is not allowing you to be content\nthis is something within you that is\nstripe that is pushing you to explore\nand learn and grow because this is not\nit's not read it's not satisfied so\nthat's the same thing that would the\nhead like he just like felt like\nsomething was missing and so so and you\nsay like nothing is ever gonna change\nthat because for 30 years nothing has\never been able to change it I just want\nto wake up and be around a lot of\nfriends and have a lot of people\nlaughing and about random things yeah\nmaybe sit on a couch and take turns\nplaying some games casually\nokay that's and then I wanna that that's\nthe other thing I always feel like it\nwas missing that I want yes but the\nthing is with the career um I always\nfelt like that was missing but now that\nI'm working on my game I feel like that\npart I I do what I want okay doing what\nI always wanted to do maybe I'm not\nthere yet and like my game will come out\nand then when I'm actually seeing people\nplay it and I'm patching it you know and\ntaking their feedback and things like\nthat and making it better then maybe\nit'll feel it's more in the state of\nwhere I want to be okay you know\nso reckful I think we've got one of two\nchoices so one is that so my hypothesis\nis that you should strive to create a\nlife filled with people who enjoy your\ncompany and who you feel relaxed and\nlike fulfilled by and I suspect once you\nget that one day you're gonna wake up\nand you're gonna be like oh [ __ ] this\nfeeling isn't gone yeah that's scary cuz\nat least right now I have a goal because\nI don't have a goal that I want some\nfriends around if I have a bunch of\nfriends around and then I still feel\nempty inside I\nI don't know yeah so so let's talk about\nfriends for a second so tell me a little\nbit about are you tell me a little bit\nabout your situation like um you know it\nseems like you're really hunger in for\nrelationships and companionship\nyou\nokay well the first thing I came in mind\nis just being in school\num I I don't know why for some reason\nwhen I was in school no one liked me\nnow people like me on the Internet but\nuh\nI didn't have any friends um very\nisolating going to school every day\nhaving no friends\nyou see but also good friends for years\nyou don't have any um but I feel like I\ncould get over that what is it really\nhow did you feel when you were in school\nI mean I felt terrible what does that\nmean\nI don't know it's hard to put myself\nback\nit's unrelated I mean people will\nunderstand what it is I don't have to\nactually like put myself in the emotion\nand experience it again\nsure people like the feeling of not\nbeing included in things or\n[Music]\nI don't I don't really know how to\ndescribe it exactly yeah I think not\nbeing included is a great way to start\nbecause what I'm hearing from you is\ninclusion is what you're looking for\nright like what would this this picture\nthat you painted of like people just\nbeing around yeah yeah reckful like you\nwant to grab some food like yeah man\nlike you want to play some Smash\nBrothers like it yeah man yeah like okay\nso right before we did our talk I went\nlive on Instagram I got text like five\npeople no one want to get food that day\nand I went live on Instagram and asked\nif anyone wanted to get food with me and\nthen I met up with a viewer to get\ndinner like that's how much I'm seeking\nlike someone to talk to you yeah yeah\nwe talked about some scars last time a\nlot of the terminology the harm I\nremember that one but a lot of the\nterminology I don't remember so I think\nI'm just thinking about timing\nI'm just trying to think about how to\nsay this stuff in a way that doesn't\nmake it seem obvious or informational\nbut can it be a little bit more\nimpactful or transformative I'm\nwondering if I should tell you some more\nstories or something for my do you like\nto listen to people's childhood and\nthings like that it's very open yeah\nyeah I'm I'm also just thinking a little\nbit about time because I don't want to\nlose track of the earlier stuff that we\nwere talking about and I'm just trying\nto decide a little bit about the\ncost-benefit of like really hammering\nsomething down like would you be better\nserved by just hammering down the breath\nand implementing that change or by like\nreally opening up this topic in like a\nnew way because I feel like if we talk I\nwant to open it up in a new way yeah\nokay\nso then then okay so then tell me a\nlittle I mean um although the breath\nthing yes things more direct and it\nhelped me right away yes so I I'm\nactually gonna do something that I think\na lot of people including yourself are\ngonna find unsatisfying sorry about for\na while sorry I was gonna say I'm\nactually thinking about doing something\nthat you and probably twitch chat will\nfind unsatisfying because I think we're\non the cusp of something important for\nyou but at the same time I think it is\nimportant to recognize that change is\nnot necessarily following change doesn't\ncome about by following the thing that\nwe feel like doing change comes about by\ndoing the thing that we really need to\ndo and I think we're actually at that\njuncture right now where the last time\nwe talked there was something kind of\nemotionally transformative about our\ntime together and now we have another\nopportunity to basically do like episode\n2 of last time but what I'm really\nwondering is are you gonna be better\nserved by doing episode 2 of last time\nor by you actually like settling down\nand like Nate or like nailing in nailing\ndown I guess this with the work that I'm\nphrase I'm looking for this issue of the\nbreath and starting to implement that\nchange like a year from now which one is\nyeah so I'm just trying to think a\nlittle bit about timing and like which\none I feel like we should do the breath\nthing first even though I imagine that\nthat will feel unsatisfying to you it's\nnot super incessant like I could do it\nokay okay so I'm gonna try to yeah so I\nthink this is what we have to do and we\ncan talk about emotions and childhood\nand Loan we got to dig into that but I\nthink that's gonna be like a whole\nnother hour at a minimum so I think this\nis what I want you to do I'm gonna try\nto give you a sense of the teacup that\nyou had on shrooms which is hard because\nyou weren't shrooms but we're gonna try\nto get you there a little bit okay so\nwhich of your nostrils is open now right\nokay the right one so the right one\nyou're sure about that\nyeah okay so I want everyone to check\nright so you can do it this way and one\nof them is gonna be more open reckful\nnow what I want you to do so this is\ngreat because your bread is in the\npicture I want you too late because your\nbed is in the picture sure I want you to\nlay down on your bed oh wait not yet not\nyet still hear you with the speakers\nokay so so but don't do it yet because I\nwant you to so this is what I want you\nto do when you lay down in your bed I\nwant you to with each breath and you\nguys should do this at home too with\neach breath notice which of your\nnostrils is open so just focus on the\nnostril that's open and then when you\nfeel the shift I want you to sit and\nfeel that shift as closely as you can\ntry to feel that shift from right to\nleft it with as much attention as you\ncan okay and then we're gonna talk about\nwhat that experience is like and the\npractice ends when your other nostril\nswitches and is like securely there for\nlike ten breaths okay I lie down yes and\nPayet H breath which are focusing on\nclose your eyes with each breath focus\non the which of your nostrils is open\nand then you're gonna feel a transition\nand try to sit fully within that\ntransition and then the transition we're\ngonna get it from the right nostril to\nthe left you're not trying to get it\nit's gonna happen on its own and you're\njust gonna watch it and as it so this is\nwhat I want you to do imagine that\nyou're the wave is coming in and out\nfrom the ocean and sometimes you just\nstand and you just feel the water right\nyou're not doing anything to the water\nyou're not bringing the water the waters\nare doing it on its own you're just\nsitting in the water so I want you to\njust sit in the transition and just feel\nit lay down on your right and just put\nfull attention to which of your nostrils\nis open on your right so right side down\nyapper it oh so put put put put your arm\nput put your right arm under you right\narm under like this yeah under under\nunder your body yeah yeah so just lay\ndown on your right side I know you don't\nI know you don't I know you don't but do\nit this time and try to be yeah don't\ncurl no no no curling just lay down yeah\nso just scoot down a little bit so this\nis [ __ ] weird I know\nfold the pillow in half and tuck it\nunder your head yes perfect close your\neyes and watch you guys do it - lay down\non whichever side the nostril is open\nand then close your eyes and watch watch\nyour breath it's gonna take a couple\nminutes so be patient both of them are\nrarely are gonna be fully open so check\nwith your nose you may notice a subtle\ndifference between the two if you think\nthey're both open no it's not enough to\nput the head on the side as nothing to\ndo the head has to do with the armpit\n[Music]\nI'm trying to respect being quiet for\nreckful but we can answer all these\nquestions okay so some people are saying\nthis and say okay so both of your\nnostrils really shouldn't be equally\nopen all the time that's the perception\nthat people have but if you check with\nyour your finger you'll notice that one\nof them is more clogged so if it changes\nI want you guys to sit in that\ntransition and just notice that\ntransition is it happens the [ __ ]\nsomeone just gifted a bunch of subs\nwhat the hell thank you\nhow we doin reckful right nostril still\nopen okay just sit with it okay so you\ncan you can curl up put you I mean not\nlike super uncomfortable but you can put\nyour hand under your head if you want\nyour right hand under your head yeah\nyeah yeah but then you're tipping\nforward which isn't good but that's okay\nyou\ndid he miss it okay come back okay I'm\nleft okay your left gang all right so\nlet's just see like who procedure eyes\nup huh yeah I'm left gang okay so this\nis what you've got to do reckful so if\nyou want to feel if you want to get back\nto the teacup you can't miss it because\nyou missed it yeah I didn't notice what\nhappened\nso like for what I watch all to do is\nlike when you guys do this practice you\ncan just lay down on the on the side\nthat your nostril is open and watch as\nits gonna shift it's just hard to\ndescribe you're gonna feel it and so pay\nattention so right now what we need to\ndo is get you to be able to pay\nattention to that damn leg how do you\nfeels a little different is left going\nthan right gang I was thinking just now\nit is it is different so the the not the\nnerves in your left nostril connect to\nin Turner ons that innervate your your\nparasympathetic nervous system what and\nthe nerves in your right nostril connect\nto in Turner ons that innervate your\nsympathetic chain ganglia which is your\nso this is essentially like Sun and Moon\nor yin and yang so your sympathetic\nnervous system is more active when you\nwhen your right nostril is open and your\nparasympathetic nervous system is more\nactive when your left nostril is open so\nif I want to be better at what do I want\nthe left nostril open and if I want to\nbe better at what do I want the right\none if you want to be physically active\nor like passionate mental activity then\nright nostril is better if you want to\nbe calm if you want to have sort of\nclarity of mind without passion then\nleft nostril is better if you want to\nrest left nostril is better if you want\nto yeah left nostril is better\nalthough we're having this conversation\nand I want to go deep left nostrils\nbetter but didn't you say left nostril\nwas for being really calm and then if I\nwant to where do you say can you stick\nin the right nostril yeah so right\nnostril is your sympathetic nervous\nsystem so it's fight or flight if I'll\nhave you know yeah like any sort of\nphysical activity or be like have a\npassionate mind then right now someone's\ngonna have a passionate mind right now\nit depends do you want to experience\nmore emotion or do you want to\nunderstand yourself better oh I want to\nunderstand it then laughs nostril\nokay so if so this is what and I\nencourage you guys to explore this right\nso in my experience and according to the\nyoga Shastras left nostril is gonna make\nyou feel a little bit more chill and\nright nostril is gonna make you feel a\nlittle bit more active and the other tip\nI'll give you guys just one really\nsimple thing is after you eat a meal you\nshould lay down on your left side for\nabout five to ten minutes and just see\nhow you feel afterward after a meal we\nwant to be lay down on the left side so\nwe get the right nostril activated yes\nokay so yeah this is some crazy [ __ ] so\nthere's some science behind it but the\nscience behind it is not very good\nthere's not what it's not very good so I\nthink what the the best thing that I\nrecommend about this stuff cuz this is\nnot really something that has been\nalthough I'm sorry I don't know I it's\ntransmitting over here water so I'll try\nto find you guys references for what\nscience supports with this stuff but\nthis is not this specificity of breath\nand meditation has not really been like\nscientifically studied like this is\ngenerally speaking in plant trials and\nit didn't not not to this degree of\nspecificity right so remember that like\ninhaling is that if there were trials\nwith a couple hundred people it would be\ntrue but you haven't been yeah because\nno one is like that's just it's just way\ntoo specific and there isn't a\nfoundation so generally speaking let's\nremember how like research works we\nresearch something very generally and\nthen we start researching\nthings like the next study is gonna be a\nlittle bit more specific is gonna be a\nlittle bit more specific is gonna be a\nlittle bit more specific so right now\nthere are just general studies being\ndone on mindfulness or meditation in\ngeneral there are very few studies that\nlook at different kinds of meditation or\nexplore like physiologic effects of like\ndifferent techniques very few we're just\nsort of starting that we're still trying\nto figure out whether this stuff has any\nmerit or not right can meditation help\nwith arthritis can meditation help with\ndepression there are some preliminary\nstudies that suggest different kinds of\nmeditation have different effects on\nyour brainwave patterns so that's the\nresolution that we're at is do are two\nkinds of meditation even different and\nis there any evidence of that and the\nanswer to that is yes there are\nconvincing studies of that that I can\nlook you but we have nowhere nowhere no\none has explored this degree of\nspecificity and research because we're\njust not there yet right it's sort of\nlike we have to remember that you know\nlet's say penicillin was discovered I\nthink sometime between the 20s and 50s\nand so that was like like our\nunderstanding of microbial\nmicroorganisms and antibiotics is like a\nhundred years old and so over a hundred\nyears we've had a lot of time to study\nnow we know a lot about different kinds\nof microorganisms and antibiotics we've\nbeen studying meditation for like twenty\nto thirty years and so we really have an\nanecdote yeah so for me haha if I had\nstarted doing magic mushrooms five years\nago for depression people would have\ncalled me a lot crazier than they would\nnow that it's getting fda-approved for\nas a breakthrough therapy Yeah right\n[Music]\nbut it would have helped me just as much\nfive years ago we didn't know yeah so\nyou have to remember that science so\nlike this is the difference because two\nyears ago even in I mean there's been\nknowledge or exploration of meditation\nfor like the better part of five\nthousand years and they learned a lot\nand science is like by comparison\nscience started studying this [ __ ] like\n30 years ago so there's a there are the\nyou know what what the Yogi's understood\nabout meditation which I do believe I\nmean not to say that everything that\nthey say is right but I think they're\nthey're brilliant because a lot of the\nwork that I do is based on their stuff\nand I think like people say your\ncredentials a bit because people in the\nchat might not know they do tune in and\nrandom times in and out oh no sure\nso by the way someone gifted like a\nhundred subs so thank you to that person\nso so might be but Gumpy I'll do my I'll\ndo my Andy thing so intro Andy so my\nname is all okay noise I'm a\npsychiatrist\nI studied meditation for an yoga for\nabout an Eastern medicine Ayurveda\nspecifically mostly a little bit of\nChinese medicine for about seven years\noriginally with the goal of becoming a\nmonk and then ended up going doing\nneuroscience research for a couple of\nyears and then went to medical school\nand trained to become a psychiatrist and\nnow I do integrative or holistic\npsychiatry like incorporating\ncomplementary alternative medicine\nmeditation yoga and things like that\ninto treatment for depression anxiety\nPTSD stuff like that and then I'm are\ntrained in a faculty at Harvard Medical\nSchool\nyeah I'm a Harvard Andy so I did\nneuroscience research they're trained to\nbecome a psychiatrist there and I'm on\nfaculty there so where did I learn\nmeditation so I learned meditation from\nlike dozens of people so I traveled to\nIndia every year for a period of about\nseven years and spent about four months\na year in India and studied with\ndifferent teachers different ashrams\ndifferent lineages learned a lot of\ndifferent kinds of meditation techniques\nfrom a lot of different people and then\nnow I sort of use different kinds of\ntechniques to help different kinds of\npeople but a lot of this like\nfundamental stuff about how to\nunderstand the breath like in and this\nis the thing like I don't think you can\nfind speaking of science I don't know if\nthere's actually a study that tells us\nwhat the pattern of breathing for\ndifferent emotions is I've never seen a\nstudy like that maybe that's out there\nbut like that's the kind of simple\nformative stuff that sometimes science\nlike misses right but we can sort of\ntest that ourselves just and it's kind\nof like common sense so I think science\nis really fantastic and you should make\nevidence-based decisions when you're\ndoing treatment but I also think that as\nI've learned time again and again as a\nclinician it doesn't matter what sign\nsays if the patient if it doesn't work\nfor the patient so even if you know the\noverwhelming evidence suggests that a\ngood treatment for depression is an SSRI\nor antidepressant like prozac if it\ndoesn't work for you it doesn't [ __ ]\nwork for you so what side says kind of\ndoesn't matter right so you like a lot\nof what I advocate for is individual\nexploration Rosic yeah when my brother\nkilled himself he had just started\ntaking Prozac yeah how old was he 21 so\nI don't know if people are aware of this\nbut there's a black box warning placed\nby the FDA that soon after taking SSRIs\nit actually increases the risk of\nsuicidality which is but completely\nbizarre\nsome people hypothesize that when you're\nsuper depressed you don't feel like\ndoing anything so even though you're\nsuicidal\nyour lack of motivation prevents you\nfrom killing yourself and I mean no none\nof this no one really knows this but\nwhen I asked people when I asked my\nprofessors like you know why is it that\nSSRIs actually increase the risk of\nsuicidality like what the [ __ ] is up\nwith that one person told me well I\nthink actually as crazy as this sounds\nwhat happens is that it fixes motivation\nproblems before it fixes suicidality so\nthere's a brief window of time where\npeople still feel suicidal but the\nprozac is giving them like enough pep in\ntheir step to actually go and try to\nhurt themselves so it's kind of like a\nreally bizarre sort of instance but this\nis like there's literally a black box\nwarning which means when you get a\nmedication there's like a black box on\nit from the fda that says that taking\nthis medication increases suicidality\nyeah the warning happened because a lot\nof people like your brother killed\nthemselves and the warning is really\napplies to adolescents and teenagers but\nI think it also fits for young adults it\nseems to not have that effect nearly as\nmuch in older people or it seems to be\nabsent so we're not sure why that\nhappens yeah so if they had known back\nthen that mushrooms were good for\ndepression and instead of Prozac then he\nmight have been alive I shouldn't think\nthat way you know yeah what do you what\ndoes that thought what do you what are\nyou thinking what are you feeling can't\nblame anybody they're trying I mean I\nguess they're trying to discover what's\ngood for depression right that's not\nwhat you're doing\nwhat are you doing reckful regret yeah\nyeah also blame also wanting yeah\nalso at its core you want things to be\ndifferent you want things to not be this\nway yeah that's that's the crux of it is\nthat you're not ready to accept the way\nthings are yeah and unless what are you\ngonna hold so when you don't accept what\nhappened to your brother and you don't\naccept your own depression what does\nthat mean for you like what does that\nmean for your life what is that lack of\nacceptance feeling what does the lack of\nacceptance feel like unfulfilled I don't\nknow I don't know what answers like\nthere's some something [ __ ] missing\nyeah that's unfulfilled right yeah and\nso when you wake up in the morning and\nyou feel like something is unfulfilled\nwhen you feel like something is missing\nlike that's where that [ __ ] comes from\nand as long as you hold on to that I'm\nnot saying that you should it's easy to\nlet go or that you're ready to let go\nyet because I don't think you are that\nthat sense that fundamental sense\nsomething I've let go of it like [ __ ] a\nhundred [ __ ] times in my life you\nknow it just comes up sometimes\nyeah so that's because you haven't let\ngo because you don't want to let go\nyou're not ready to let go you're not\nready because lucky you don't you still\nblame things for what happened\nyou blame science and you blame yourself\nand you blame your brother and you don't\nblame your brother you learn to forgive\nhim but there's still a part of you that\nis just not it just it shouldn't be this\nway it shouldn't have been this way this\nshouldn't have happened it shouldn't\nhave happened to him and it shouldn't\nhave happened to you yeah I was just\nthinking something interesting um when I\nwas kid remember they died my grandma my\ndad\nshe was really old already she's like 85\n86 no 87 she's 87 and my dad didn't want\nto tell her that he died so she would\nask where's guy how come he hasn't\nvisited in a while you just say oh he's\nreally busy that he was getting his\npilot wings for a while but then he got\nhis pala wings a little bit for um and\nwe never told her and I was in on it\nto never tell her I was kid she died\nnever knowing that he died she was like\nin the hospital and she like fallen in\nthe shower and broken her hip and she\nwas in the hospital and she was\nwondering where he was but it was better\nnot to tell her that he was not that\nround we never told her yeah why do you\nbring that up now it just came in my\nmind yeah why I'm not sure what is that\nstory about some closure feeling I guess\nyeah\nby closure feeling it that stories about\nthe impossibility of acceptance that\nstory is about like not knowing that\nstory is about a version of reality that\nyou in a bizarre way longed for in a\nbizarre way I'm looking for a version of\nreality that your grandmother had like a\nversion of reality where my parents are\nlooking for it a little more I'm sure I\nyeah\nyeah have you ever talked I mean I'm\nsure you guys have talked but have you\ntalked to your parents about your\nbrother passing away not for this yeah\nlike what are this conversations go like\nthey don't go well okay good yeah what\ndoes that mean I don't want to thought\nthey were probably listening right okay\nsure yeah so I mean I I think you know\nspeaking of community and loneliness I\nyou know reckful them it's better if I\ntalk to them directly right yeah sure so\nI mean I I think the challenge here is\nthat we're talking about you letting go\nbut like I don't think I I don't think\nit's just you that needs to let go right\nyou told me about how your relationship\nwith your other brother kind of changed\nand like this is you could [ __ ] my halo\nso I was I was just saying I don't think\nthis is just about you letting go this\nis yes is about like you because it's\ngonna be very hard to let go when other\npeople are holding on in some way and\nyou guys are like connected and that my\ndad my dad told me about a year ago that\nhe finally feels okay here's what he\nsaid but I remember when I was really\nyoung I overheard him talking to his\nfriend I don't know I was like 12 that\nhe told his friend that he wanted to\nkill himself I was weird to hear my dad\nsay that yeah reckful do you have a\ntherapist I've gone to therapy a few\ntimes but not I've never saw it as\nuseful enough to keep going this time I\ndo well okay this is not therapy but I\n[Music]\nyeah it was so okay so look look man so\nthis is what we got to do so either so I\nthink this is way more longitudinal like\nthere's something this is way more\nlongitudinal right so I think we have to\ndo a we got to figure something out so\neither you need to talk to someone about\nthis because you understand things that\nyou didn't understand before or\nlike I can't do one offs like we can do\none offs about meditation and random\n[ __ ] but if you really want to get into\nthis if you want to get into loan this\nwe got to do it like in sequent like we\ngot to do it sequentially like we got to\ndo fine with that we got to do it you\nknow get started yeah so let's let me\njust think about that it doesn't have to\nbe online but you know if you want to do\nit online that's fine but then I think\nwe have to do it consistently and how\ncould you have done I mean I would say\nprobably every week for like four to\neight weeks that's not that long I mean\nit's not that long but I mean it's I'm\nwilling to do that if okay well yeah I\nmean I'm willing to do it because I I\nmean I think you just have to think\nabout whether you really want to do that\nhuh and yeah I think you just gotta\nthink like you gotta just I\nmy thing is transmitting though I don't\nknow I think it's I think it's disorder\nit's gotta be disclose sorry discord uh\nI don't know like I think I don't think\nI'm yeah it's discord my people are -\ncuz I'm sitting here [ __ ] pulling out\nmy hair cuz I'm thinking that if I like\nmove back it stops I think it's discord\nbut it might because that time I was\nwatching it sensitivity you tried\nchanging it oh well I mean I think it\nshould be the same as anyway so going\nback to going back to what we're talking\nabout so I think let me just think about\nit let's figure out how to do this you\njust sleep on it and then you let me\nknow like tomorrow or like whenever you\nwant to let me know and then we can\nstart we got to talk about it for like\nfour to six weeks okay so so do you want\nto start having I want I want in the\nmorning I want you to do a practice of\n433 rounds of thirty forceful\nexhalations like this whoa are you\ntapping your foot no what does that\nsound I don't know\njust me exhaling so really breathe out\nwith your with your like contract your\nstomach okay all right so kind of like\nthis yeah pull your stomach in eyes\nclosed\nokay with each exhalation contract the\nstomach like like a bellows good that's\nright stop\ngood now close your eyes feel close
