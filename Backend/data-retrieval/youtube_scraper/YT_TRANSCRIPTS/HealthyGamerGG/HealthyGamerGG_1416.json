    "transcript": "okay oh okay okay okay okay so how do i\ninternalize beliefs that my subconscious\ndisagrees with okay so you have some\ncore beliefs about the world right like\nyou have some beliefs about how stuff\nworks like psychologically you know what\ngets us therapists all hot and bothered\nis like oh like I don't love myself it's\nlike oh yeah that's like that's the kind\nof like core belief that people have\nright and so someone's asking like\nlogically sure you can this is the way I\nunderstand that question logically you\ncan understand that you should love\nyourself but you can't change the fact\nthat you don't love yourself so how do\nyou change this idea that like you know\nyou should love yourself you know you\nshould be your best friend you know you\nshould treat yourself with respect but\nyou're unable to so how do you change\nthat and so I think the the best way to\nactually change this is a practice\ncalled yoga nidra which is on our\nYouTube which you guys can go back and\nwatch but this is what I want y'all to\nthink about for a second so how do we\nlike learn how does something change\nwithin our mind how do we learn things\nso I want you guys to think about if I'm\nstudying a textbook and I read\neverything on the page I don't\nnecessarily understand I don't\nunderstand the information right like I\ncan read the information but I don't get\nit so just think about this for a second\nand then what happens is I read the page\nagain and I read the page again and the\nfourth time I read the page I get it\ndoes everybody understand what I'm\nsaying so there's a difference between\nlike reading the information and getting\nit so let's just think about that\nbecause like sometimes you read the page\nonce and you get it so like let just\nstop cuz this blows my mind so one day I\nwas thinking about this as a holy [ __ ]\nif I could figure out why sometimes I\ncan read the page once and get it\nand sometimes I read the page ten times\nand I don't get it like how the [ __ ]\ndoes that work and if I can figure out\nhow that works can I create a situation\nwhere I'm reading the page once every\nsingle time and I'm getting it and how\nOpie would that be how Opie would it be\nto read something and to understand it\nevery single time\nand I actually investigated it and I\nfigured it out and then thankfully I\nwent to med school and I studied two\nhours a day in med school\nno more sometimes I studied more before\na test or over the weekend two hours a\nday all of my friends sending five hours\na day seven hours a day eight hours a\nday\nstaying up super late tons of caffeine I\nstudied two [ __ ] hours a day that's\nit and then people say oh you aren't you\nso smart man like oh my god you must be\na [ __ ] genius no I'm not a [ __ ]\ngenius\nthis is important because you guys have\ndone it too right you've read a page\nyou've read a page sometimes and it\nsinks in and other times it doesn't sink\nin the only difference is I figured out\nwhat the difference between the two is I\nfigured out why I'm able to have it sink\nin and why other times it isn't so now\nI'm gonna ask you no no I you guys want\nthe [ __ ] answer too bad I'm not gonna\nI'm not gonna tell you you're gonna\nfigure it out so I'm gonna ask you guys\nwhat do you think so in what scenario\ncould I read something ten times and not\nunderstand it you tell me okay so let's\nsay that I'm in a library and the\nlibrary is burning down right so people\nare saying distracted okay okay okay\nchat calm down\ndistracted right so like the more like\nlet's say that I'm studying and I just\ngot broken up with my like my girlfriend\njust dumped me how many times am I gonna\nhave to read the page to understand it\nabsolutely so just think about that so\nthen let's say that so this is what I\ndid in med school I would wake up at\n4:00 4:00 between 4:00 and 4:30 every\nday and I would study between like 4:30\nand 6:30 or 5:00 and 7:00 did it first\nthing in the morning when my mind was\ncompletely clear and I found that that\nwas when my mind was the most focused\nand I would meditate and do yoga in the\nmorning super focused mind sit down and\nstudy and I found that like 4 a.m.\nabsolutely 4 a.m. then I would study\nwhatever I whatever the class was gonna\ncover that day I'd go through it before\nclass and then class became review and\nif you guys want to know what's Opie in\nschool it's having every day's class be\nreview instead of having a review\nsession like you guys know how good a\nreview session is before a test right\nimagine every day of class was a review\nsession becomes easy and then the review\nsession is like you know when like you\nknow when you study for a test and\nyou're like man I wish I could have gone\nto like to review sessions like wouldn't\nit be cool like imagine how well you\nwould do on a test if instead of just\nhaving one review session before the\ntest you had like two review sessions a\nweek apart like how easy would would\nschool be be like way easier right so\nclass became the review session and then\nthe review session became the second\nreview session so I did pretty well I\ndidn't get straight A's in med school I\nwasn't at the top of my class but I did\nI did good enough right there were some\npeople who like did amazing like I\nwasn't at the top of my class didn't get\nlike a stellar stop score I mean I got a\ngood pretty good stuff score but it\nwasn't like anything crazy you know if I\nwanted to become like an orthopedic\nsurgeon like it would have been you know\nI would have been in the running but it\nwouldn't have been like a lock I mean I\nhad some friends who were just [ __ ]\ngeniuses so it's all about the state of\nmind if you want something to sink into\nyour mind and plant there and understand\nit it's about the state of mind so this\nis important so I want you guys to\nimagine your mind like a pool of water\nthat has dirt in it and if you want to\nsee to the bottom which is what we kind\nof think of is the subconscious the more\nthat the water is moving the more dirt\nis going to be started so you need a\nstill mind so when I get dumped by my\ngirlfriend or the library's on fire what\nis happening in my mind if there's a lot\nof activity lot of activity so anything\nI try to put in there is not going to\nsink in because there's just all this\n[ __ ] in the way\nso calm the mind and then you can plant\nsomething then you could plant a deep\nright sometimes you have a conversation\nwith someone and you are so tuned in to\nthat conversation that that experience\n[ __ ] sinks in like I remember for me\nthis is an assembly I remember for me\nlike an experience that sunk in and I\nwas like this transformed like the way\nthat I looked in the world is an F F 2\nor F F or Japanese there's this guy\nnamed Cecil and he's a Dark Knight and\nhe becomes a [ __ ] paladin and that\nwas like just the coolest thing in the\nworld in my mind was focused and that\nthought that seemed that experience got\nplanted so deep into my mind it can\nnever be forgotten\nand along with that was like all of this\nweird stuff about like salvation and\nlike you can make it and you can recover\nyour life and all that [ __ ] started with\na Cecil ff4 Dark Knight right and so\nyou've got to be focused a focus mind\nwill lead to change and we can see that\nwith with um if you guys watch the\ninterview today like you could tell\nafter he meditated like it didn't sink\nin because he's just got all his\nthoughts his thoughts are in the way so\nhow do you internalize how do you take\nthe things that you should believe and\nget them to a place from where your core\nbeliefs are so core beliefs are deep\nwithin your mind and so there's a\npractice called yoga nidra which calms\nthe mind on the surface level and then\nthis is a part of yoga neither that I\nhaven't taught then you have something\ncalled a Sun cult and like when you do\nyoga nidra and you do it well you're\nlike writing you're like rewriting the\ncode of your subconscious so this is the\nother thing to understand you guys\nunderstand like you have a mind right\nand like it sends thoughts up to you\nit's just like sends you [ __ ] from time\nto time and depending on who you are\nthose thoughts are different like when\nI'm walking down the street I have a\nparticular desire for something that not\nsomething that someone else won't have\nbecause of what my mind is it's like oh\nwow like I smell rosemary that smells\ndelicious there's some\nin my subconscious mind that likes\nrosemary other people don't like the\nsmell of rosemary other people like\nlavender other people like patchouli\nother people like rose you know there's\nthere's all kinds of stuff so your mind\nsends you all kinds of thoughts like all\nthe time I know it sounds like super\nbasic but just stop and think about this\nfor a second when you're somewhere your\nmind is going to be sending you thoughts\nthat other people aren't gonna have that\nmeans that they're coming from somewhere\nit's not like Universal your mind is\nspecific and it sends you thoughts this\nis why people have different complexes\nright this is why I like some people get\nanxious\nsome people get depressed some people\nget anxious about something some people\nget anxious about another thing that's\nbecause it's all coming from somewhere\nin your mind so in order to get to that\npart of the mind we need it to sink in\nso if you calm your mind and then you\ntell yourself something it's gonna sink\nin and then something cool starts to\nhappen in the same way that these\nnegative thoughts about yourself bubble\nup to the surface and you have to fight\nthem good thoughts start to bubble up\nwhen you start to meditate regularly and\nuse a song called a Sun gulp is kind of\nlike a it's like a statement that you\nmake about yourself and you plant it\ndown there so like just think about this\nyou have a core belief that makes you\nthink you're lazy right and so it\nbubbles up from the surface from time to\ntime it's like oh yeah like man I'm lazy\n[ __ ] I'm lazy [ __ ] I'm lazy and if we\nthink about the interview today he has\nthis thought that I'm in control of\nmyself I can control my destiny and\nthere's times that that thought bubbles\nup in a positive way and it's actually a\ndifferent thought but at times it\nbubbles up in a negative way he thinks\nthat's the same thoughts actually to\nstop the thoughts that like oh like I\ncontrolled my destiny therefore I [ __ ]\nit up therefore I suck at life or I\ncontrol my destiny I can do anything\nthat I put my mind to life is full of\nlava not and greatness right so you do\nyoga out there and you plan to suck up\nif you if you flatten your mind and you\ndo a month or a month or is another\nexample right so you do mantra and then\nyou plant it deep within your\nsubconscious and then something really\nmagical happens I'm a lazy piece of [ __ ]\nI'm actually pretty\nwhat I put my mind to becomes automatic\nand then change habits it's not about\ncontrol\nit's not about willpower because right\nnow you guys are fighting to overcome\nthat negative thought every time it\ncomes up you try to push it down every\ntime it comes up you try to push it down\nevery time it comes up you try to push\nit down instead plant something else\ndown there plant something inspirational\nand you do that with a calm mind because\nonce the combined is calm just like\nyou're reading something you can read\nsomething and it sinks in it goes in you\nlearn that 2+2 ISM is 4 and then when\nyour mind sees oh 2+2 it bubbled the\nanswer bubbles up this is important you\ndon't think about it being for the\nanswer comes from within it's automatic\nit doesn't require effort once you\nunderstand its it's just effort it's\neffortless it's not control\nso learn how to plant things within\nyourself calm your mind and then you can\ndo a month or you can do a Sun cult and\nI think Yoga Nidra is one of the most\npotent techniques to get people to a\nsuper calm mind relatively easily and\nthen you do a Sun cult so after you\nenter the state of like neutralness at\nthe end of the yoga nidra practice you\nmake a Sun cult for yourself and then\nyou tell yourself that right so it's\nlike I deserve to cut myself a break\nlike that's a good example of a Sun cult\nlike you have to figure out what the\nright Sun cult this for you and then\neach time you do that practice that\nthought lands into your subconscious and\nit grows more and more and more and then\neventually it starts bubbling up and now\nwe come back to the how why meditate and\nhow does that make people holy it's\nbecause when you meditate and you\ncombine it with some of these practice\nall you don't have to when you meditate\nlike you change that subsurface level of\nself it's underneath the mind right\nbecause remember meditation is about\nshutting off the mind then you can start\nwriting like you're accessing the source\ncode right it's like if you hit f11 when\nyou're looking at a website and you see\nall the HTML code and you start editing\n[ __ ] over there\nmeditation lets you edit that [ __ ] on\nthe side\nthat's what it does\nand so if you want to start changing\nyour subconscious beliefs\nit starts with calming the mind and then\nreflecting and then planting and then as\nyou plant it'll start to bubble up and\nthen your life is different so people\nlook at me and they're like oh man like\nyou guys think I'm happy like I'm happy\nmost days right look day to day like\ntoday I'm actually having a rough day\nthis is me on a rough day and I have\nrough days too but the difference is\nthat I've planted [ __ ] in my\nsubconscious that bubbles up it's like\nautopilot it's like it's like a\npermanent buff\nit's like you have debuffs in your buffs\nright so I've had the privilege in the\nluck to plant some good things in myself\nit's like it's like a food buff but it's\npermanent you know like sometimes when\nyou play an RPG and like I like these\ngames that do this that you get like\nsome kind of permanent buff because you\nmake a choice in the story right and\nit's like plus five doll stats because\nyou consume someone's soul it's like\nthat's the kind of [ __ ] that I'm talking\nabout a permanent buff it's not quite\nleveling up but it's like a\ntransformative experience that changes\nthe person that you are and gives you\nlike a +5 on liquor it gives you like\n10% lifesteal or like +5 on all your\nstats or something like that that's what\nmeditation does so a son gulp is a\nparticular kind of buff that you get to\nchoose so like sometimes like you know\nwhen you're when you're playing an RPG\nand you like get a boon and they're like\nwhat do you want do you want a +5 to nth\nstrength kaan Dex magic item like you\nget it you get a prize right and so the\nson gulp is like the kind of thing that\nyou want do you want to practice self\nforgiveness do you want to practice\nmotivation do you want to practice\nwhatever so people are now asking how do\nyou choose the Sun Cup I think it\nrequires reflection so you've got to\nthink about something that it shouldn't\nchange rapidly so you want to do a Sun\ncup like for a year and it should be\nsomething that like you should want to\nreinforce so it shouldn't be like\ntemporary so one example of a Sun cult\nthat I used with a patient who had\nsuffered from a lot of trauma is I\ndeserve to be whole so I think that\nworked really well for her you can't\nplant good luck for\nI haven't figured out how to do that yet\nmaybe you can that's not the way that I\nwork I tend to focus on the self so I'm\nall about like character creation and\nbuffing the character good luck is like\nis like a server wide thing right good\nluck is not something you control\nit's not about you so there are people\nwho do that kind of spirituality it's\njust not mine because I don't believe I\ndon't know I don't trust the server I\ntrust myself\nI trust my stats and I try to buff\nmyself that's what this is about like\nthat's like server wide changes like\ngood luck is like going and editing the\nserver to like you know make cheap drop\nrates or something like that like that's\nnot I don't know how to do that there is\na way to do that it's not usually how I\nwork though I do a little bit of that\nfrom time to time that's called Tantra\nTantra is about server changing some\nthings server-side Yoga is about\nchanging the character Thunder is about\nchanging certain things server-side\nTantra could you raise your GPA by a\ngood song called absolutely I mean I\nbelieve so so and let's just think about\nthis like that's kind of from a\nspiritual perspective but from a\nneuroscience perspective we have good\nevidence of that right so forget about\nall the spiritual stuff because who\nknows what the [ __ ] this guy like what\ndoes he know like this is some weird\nhokey stuff there's overwhelming\nscientific evidence that meditating on a\nregular basis which is basically what\nI'm telling you to do improves attention\nconcentration and memory so even if you\ndon't believe any of the spiritual stuff\nif you don't count on any of the\nspiritual stuff and when I started I\ndidn't believe any of this crap either\nliterally what happened the first year\nthat I studied yoga and meditation as I\nsat down I looked through a bunch of\nscience and out of all of the practices\nthat I learned I picked the ones that\nhad the most scientific evidence to\nsupport them and I said I can meditate\nten different ways I'm gonna pick the\none and like some of them may work some\nof them may not work but I'm gonna\nchoose the ones that have the most\nscientific support that's the way that I\ndid\nso I think your GPA is gonna go up if\nyou meditate on a regular basis but\nthat's not like some weird like Sun gulp\nand subconscious like I'm weird hokey\nstuff man like I don't know what this\nguy's talking about rely on the science\nyeah"
