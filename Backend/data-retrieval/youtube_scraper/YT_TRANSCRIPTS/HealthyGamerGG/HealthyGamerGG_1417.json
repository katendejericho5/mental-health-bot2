    "transcript": "so for all of you guys who were\nwondering like how does change happen\njust watch that interview and you'll see\nit at the end you can see it in his face\nhis degree of animation his posture like\nthere's something very subtle and small\nchanging inside him\nokay so um what why don't you just start\nby telling it what would you like me to\ncall you on stream i think Gork is fine\nokay it's the easy so Gord can you tell\nus a little bit about what's bringing\nyou on today and how we can be helpful I\nknow we just talked about um yeah so\nwhat's bringing me I guess is well I've\nbeen friends for with reckful for the\npast couple months years or so we talked\na bit about let's say that the pressures\nof streaming is stuff like that yeah and\nI saw the stream you had with you and I\nmean that really made me wake up and\nrealize maybe I should also talk to a\ntherapist in general and deal with my\n[ __ ]\nyeah I guess so what is said [ __ ]\nsaid [ __ ] what do you mean what what is\nthought your [ __ ] what is it that you\nneed to deal with well I mean I have an\nentire list of mental issues I guess\nthat I need to address one by one but\nthey're all I guess rooted in the fact\nthat I'm not so happy I guess always\nunhappy with myself okay and tell me a\nlittle bit more about that so my main\nissue I guess is that no matter how well\nI do in a stream or how how well I do\nduring the stream how good my numbers\nare there's always something I could do\nbetter and I'm always unhappy with it\nand when I couldn't understand it enough\nthat this is very like deep deep and\nhappiness that I haven't felt before in\nmy life because I feel an immense amount\nof pressure because I care a lot about\nmy stream and what I'm doing okay what\nis it that you help me understand why\nyou care so much uh well I don't know I\nreally I I just care about it a lot\nbecause it feels like I accomplished\nsomething nice and I guess I have a fear\nof losing it all the time as well so I\nneed to keep it up I feel like I don't\nknow what if maybe through it and I've\nthought about this myself before maybe\nzero didn't money but I don't think so\nmaybe it's rooted in some kind of\nvalidation from other people I'm not\nactually sure yeah sure so let's maybe\nlet's see if we can understand that a\nlittle bit better so I just want to try\nto summarize because because Gork and I\ntalked a little bit before we came on\nand this was kind of last minute so Gork\nwas kind of telling me that\nhe has this sense of inadequacy or not\ninadequacy but that you know it's almost\nlike your success is like temporary and\nlike you wanna know and that you can do\nreally really well and then you still\nsort of feel like you didn't do a great\njob or you could have done better and\nthat many times things start to go south\nfor you like if you're if you're losing\na game or something like that and what\ndo you play by the way I play dota 2\nokay I mean that when you're losing a\ngame like you start to feel what\nwell I start to feel inadequate like you\nsaid and the snowballs out of control\nwhere mine adequacy leads to me playing\nworse and being less funny in my opinion\nat least and being more whiny or\nwhatever which also gets into my head\neven further and then that cycles\nthroughout the entire stream and even\ninto the next days which makes me just\nfeel awful\nokay almost all the time why does your\nstream have to be successful uh I don't\nknow I feel like I guess more than\nanything was important to me it's sort\nof forward momentum and also I guess I\nfeel some kind of validation of me being\nmore successful than other streamers\njust make yeah I don't know if that\nmakes any sense but when I look at other\nstreamers and I see that I'm more\nsuccessful than them it makes me feel\ngood but I don't know why okay because\nthe reason I say that is because when I\nsee let's say an undersea man competing\nwith do really well then I feel unhappy\nfor some reason even though maybe I\nshouldn't okay so I\nGork the first thing that I want to do\nis actually give you a pat on the back\nbecause I think you're doing a fantastic\njob of facing some feelings that I think\nother people would shy away from mm-hmm\nso the number of people that I know that\nyou know feel that like people delude\nthemselves into thinking that they\nactually don't feel satisfaction when\nthey do better than someone else yeah\nlike if you're you know if you get an a\non a test and someone else gets a B like\nthere are a lot of people who like lie\nto themselves and say yeah like yeah the\nonly reason that I I'm happy is because\nI got an A I don't care what I knew and\nI'll Scott but it's a very simple truth\nthat sometimes\nthe way that we feel about ourselves and\nother people has to do with like us\nbeing better than them no I really don't\nwant to feel that way but I feel like if\nI had to be honest with you and with\nmyself then that is at least mature yeah\nand I just want to commend you for that\nbecause you know one of the simplest\nproblems that people run across is that\nlike they don't believe they don't\naccept things about themselves that they\ndon't want to be true and so I think\nyou've taken the first and most\nimportant step in recognizing that the\nperson that you are depends a little bit\non the way that you relate to other\npeople yeah so now let's try to\nunderstand a little bit about where that\ncomes from so how long have you felt\nthat way I don't know I mean I guess if\nI'm feeling that way for as long as I\ncan remember with streaming and me\ncomparing myself to others I mean back\nin school wave and the only reason I\nfelt like I even tried to get good\ngrades at all was just because I wanted\nto be better than my than the other guys\nin my class it was nothing about and I\ndon't really know what else motivated me\nreally okay and and when you were saying\nthat you wanted to be better than other\npeople in your class like how old what\nare we talking about I don't know I feel\nlike I was always like a goofball up\nuntil like eighth grade because that's\nwhen in Sweden they add like grades and\nwhen they added grades for some reason I\nstraighten up my act completely I would\nsay I still did the very bare minimum to\nget an A but I always made sure I try to\nget an A in the class before that I\ndidn't care about school at all but as\nsoon as they come some kind of grading\nsystem came I start caring but I still\nplayed a lot of video games obviously\nand stuff but I at least I did the bare\nminimum to be better than others that's\nwhat I felt like and when you were\nbetter than others how did you feel uh I\ndon't know a sense of satisfaction I\nguess I'm not sure okay so we have to\nunderstand that right so what do you\nremember about my cat sling on my\nkeyboard yes sorry what do you remember\nabout how you felt in high school when\nyou got is I don't know really I've\nalways I mean I guess something that\nalso drove me except for feeling better\nthan others was\nthe fact that if I had good grades or if\nI did well I had a sort of a secure or a\ncushy future or whatever so now it just\nmade me feel secure I guess that I'm not\nbad I'm not sure I've never really\nthought about it I'm just gonna think\nfor a second because I'm trying to\nfigure out how to phrase this yeah I\nthink oddly enough\nGork I I don't think the issue is about\nfeeling better than others I'm really\ncurious about\nI think it's that's the that's the side\nof the coin that's one side of the coin\nis when you feel adequate you feel\nsuperior and you feel better\nmm-hmm what I'm really curious about is\nlike how do you feel when you get a beat\nyeah I don't know I feel like I feel\nlike a disappointment to myself more\nthan anything okay in in what way are\nyou disappointing yourself\nI just I mean I don't know ever since I\nwas like a small kid everybody just said\nI'm the smart kid or whatever and then I\nfeel like I'm just betraying that image\nof myself which made me feel so good I'm\nsuch a smart kid or whatever and then\nall of a sudden it all comes crumbling\ndown as soon as I don't perform and the\nsame with streaming you know when people\nput pressure on you that oh you're the\nbiggest dota 2 streamer right now\nwherever as soon as I feel like I'm not\nthe biggest or I'm not growing fast\nenough I feel like my entire entire\nself-image just crumbles yes okay so I\nthink that's where the money is\nokay so we're gonna talk about that so\nwhat we're talking about here is\nhold on\nis living up to expectations yeah\nthat's what this does that make sense\nlike what I'm hearing from you is that\nlike you have expectations that you need\nto live up to and if you don't live up\nto those expectations then you're kind\nof letting everyone down and you feel\nbad about yourself\nno and the scary thing yeah so I yeah so\nwe can get into it more later but it's\nnot like I just feel bad I literally\nfeel like I don't want to live anymore\nit like it gets to that point where I\nshut out everybody out of my life and\nlike I totally isolate myself in-between\nmy streams\nI just feel what other people out what\nit what is it that you don't want them\nto see\nI don't know I just feel like I feel\nlike even an even angrier version of\nmyself as soon as I start sharing with\nother people it's kind of hard for me to\nshare with other people because all that\nbuilds up to me is this like self\nconflicting thing where I I'm not really\nwho I present myself to be so I just\nfeel shamed I guess yeah in the way I am\nor acted or I'm not succeeding yeah so\nyou feel ashamed for not living up to\nexpectations yeah mostly the ones I put\non myself with you I don't think anybody\nelse but what's really hi expecting them\nnot my parents or anything okay and so\nif there are expectations that you put\non yourself why do you have to shut\npeople out what is it that makes you\nshut people out when you're not living\nup to them no no it just feels like I\ndon't know whenever I talk about it like\nnow talking about it with you it's not\nso bad but I never talk about other\npeople it just brings back those\nfeelings of inadequacy and those make me\nso angry that even feel like that in the\nfirst place so it just cycles my anger\nyes okay so fantastic I mean ah so I do\nthis thing on stream where I say\npositive things but it's not that yeah\nit's no no it's just I think it's a\nreally important point okay because\nyou're noticing there are two things\ngoing on there is the original thing\nthat happens in your mind and then there\nis the way that you judge yourself for\nhaving that thing mm-hmm\nthere's the initial thing and then\nthere's the reaction to the thing\nthere's the feeling ashamed and then\ngetting angry at yourself for feeling\nthe way that you do mm-hmm those are two\nseparate things each of them have their\nown origin let's start with let me just\nthink for a second\nwhen did you start beating yourself up\nI don't know I've never really beaten\nmyself as much as when I started\nstreaming I guess that's when all this\npressure came okay and tell me about\nbeating yourself up when since you\nstarted streaming\nI don't know I guess I feel like it all\ngoes back to the an image I build up\nabout myself that I don't feel like I\nlive up to so like I build up an image\nof you know like whatever up-and-coming\nor big streamer or whatever kind of\nlabel I want to put on it when as soon\nas I don't feel like I live up to it\neven living up to something like as I'm\nfunny or good at the game anything\nreally as soon as I don't feel like I'm\nlike I'm doing it I just get so angry at\nmyself and I really hate it okay why is\nit important for you to be a big person\nI don't know actually\nI don't have a clue it's just something\nthat drives me okay do you feel like a\nsmall person\nokay can you tell me about can you tell\nme about your upbringing a little bit\nhmmm I don't know what's what's much to\nsay like I was mostly raised by my mom\npretty relaxed parents I could play\nhowever late into the night I wanted to\nI was kind of free to set my own goals\nand expectations about school and I did\nthat I never had really any pressure to\ndo anything maybe sometimes I got like\nforeign parents they're like why don't\nyou become a doctor I mean like maybe I\nmean that's that's as far as it went\nthere's nothing like super pressure\nabout it mmm I don't know I I had a\npretty normal childhood I guess I wasn't\nI was kind of a class clown in my first\nyears and then I became like more of a\ngamer / odden type of person mm-hmm in\nmy high school years I was never them\nnever the most popular kid but I was\nnever bullied either or anything like\nthat okay so what I'm hearing from you\nis that there's like there's no like\nsometimes when people come on stream you\nknow there's something really bad that\nhappened to them or someone that treated\nthem very badly or something like that\nand I'm not hearing any of that from you\nknow I wouldn't say so okay no can you\ntell me a little bit about you have\nsiblings by the way I have one older\nbrother but he's like nine or 10 years\nolder me so we're not super close what\ndo you remember about him growing up\nwell I remember he didn't let me pray\nand play on the computer a lot which\nannoyed me other than that I mean we\nweren't we're there was such a big age\ndifference between us that he was like\nliving his own life and I was living\nmine he was almost like a father figure\nto me in some ways because my dad wasn't\naround um I don't know what there's to\nsay it was like I met him every other\nweekend\nhe was an alright dad he was okay and I\ndon't really know what to say about it\nme he wasn't he he liked me / he loved\nme a lot but he wasn't very nice to my\nmother he wasn't a very nice to my\nfamily in overall so my mother alienated\nfrom me me from him\nthe first 10 or 12 years of my life I\nguess but yeah we got closer in in the\nend he got sick and he died when I was\nabout 15 by then we had gotten pretty\nclose to each other at least yeah so but\nI wouldn't say he was a big part of my\nlife before\nlast part of his I guess if that makes\nsense yeah it makes a lot of sense it\nsounds like he wasn't really a big part\nof your life and then just when you guys\nwere getting closer he sort of\nunfortunately ended up passing away no\nhow do you feel about that uh well I\nfeel like some in some ways I feel like\nI got robbed a bit kind of a dad cuz you\nknow he wasn't really there when in my\nteenage years so I feel like I need him\na lot I feel like my late teen years are\npretty rough\nI think my dad could have helped a lot\nbut I don't know the thing I think about\nmy dad was the most guilty like the most\nguilty thing I've ever feel about my\nlife was when my dad was dying he was\nlike sick in the hospital I didn't go\nvisit him because I felt I think I\njustify it I felt like it was too hard\nto sit there with him as he was dying it\nwas but instead I just sat formalist\nplayed video games and I every time I\nthink about him I just think about I\nshould have [ __ ] been there you know\nthat's what I think about when I think\nabout my dad I'd only think about much\nelse cuz that's when we were the closest\nyeah so let me ask you something Gork\nwhat were you in that moment when you\ndidn't go see your dad what kind of\nperson were you I was just I don't know\nI wasn't a person I feel like I was just\nfloating in the clouds playing video\ngames if I had to say what kind of\nperson I was it wasn't really a person\nit was just you know is the boy playing\nvideo games didn't care about anything\nin the world\nyeah let me try word inadequate\ninadequate by not going to see him I\nlike guilting myself about stuff that's\none other thing the most simple form of\ninadequacy right\nthe most simple the most devastating how\ncan I say this you know in order to be a\ngood person in order to be a good son in\norder to you know do the right thing no\njust had to do one thing and that was go\nstood us up to be there yeah and you\ndidn't do that no so what kind of person\ndoesn't do that well I don't know I feel\nlike now to think about it if I was\nolder I would feel really bad about it\nbut I don't know I feel like then I was\njust a kid and I was a stupid but I\nstill feel guilty about it because I was\nnot that young I was like 14 15 yeah so\nwe're gonna get to that and how that\npart of your mind works but let me ask\nyou this when you're losing a game\nmm-hmm and people are trolling you yeah\ndoes that feel at all like how when they\nattack you is that how you feel is that\nwhat you tell yourself when you feel\nguilty does that make sense uh when they\nattack me what do I do you attack\nyourself in the same way like when you\nget angry with yourself yeah I mean I'm\nalready very angry with myself I like\nmost of my anger doesn't like come from\nother people putting pressure on me I\nfeel like it just affirms it yeah in a\nway that's exactly right so I think the\nproblem here the reason that you're so\nsensitive to other people attacking you\nis because\nthose guys are actually like like when\npeople attack you on stream those are\nthe people that you're queueing with\nokay those are the people in your party\nthat make sense now guess who's the\ncaptain I'm the captain\nabsolutely mm-hmm right and what's the\ngoal to win and what does winning mean\nwith those guys and use the captain\nbeating the opponent yeah in the\nopponent this time is like proving to\nyourself that you're kind of like a\npiece of [ __ ] it's attacking you right\nnow they're like you're attacking you\nthey're attacking you mm-hmm\nand that's like because you just like\nthere's a part of you that feels like\nyou deserve it you know for sure and\nlet's just think about this for a second\nwhy do you deserve it because I'm not\ngood enough for myself yes and when did\nyou start becoming not good enough uh I\ndon't know whenever I put these\nstandards on myself I guess I started\nstreaming and people built up an image\nabout me that I needed to uphold I think\nit goes deeper than that right cuz I\nthink at that point you were already you\nwere already the party leader okay and\nthe stream just started to grow things\nit was like accelerant or fertilizer for\nwhat was already there so I absolutely\nbelieve because that's what streaming\ndoes like streaming this is something\nthat everyone needs to understand social\nmedia just amplifies the feelings that\nyou already have right like when you\nwatch like when you think about\nsomething like FOMO like fear of missing\nout right like you already feel like\nyou're missing out in some things in\nlife and when social media like shows\nall the things that you're missing out\nit amplifies like all of your weaknesses\nand vulnerabilities it amplifies your\ninadequacies I don't think it creates\nthem I think it just takes what's there\nand like messes with our brain because\nsuddenly like when it comes to your\nsense of self-worth\nGork\nthat's kind of like a nebulous thing\nlike you can't quantify your sense of\nself-worth until you start streaming and\nthen you can modify it right like you\ncan look and you can see like okay like\nI'm half as good as I used to be\nyesterday and there's a lot of\nprotection in not being able to quantify\nstuff you're like ah that's just a\nfeeling but now you have proof about how\nyou're becoming a worse person no and\nthat can be very damaging so I do\nbelieve that the stream sort of made a\nlot of this stuff worse but it sounds to\nme like you had some of these feelings\nof inadequacy like way before that yeah\nI guess I've always had them they're\njust gone a lot worse the past couple\nyears that I believe in I'm sorry about\nthat and I hope today we'll be able to\nhelp you some and we can also talk a\nlittle bit more afterward about thinking\nabout how how to better manage this\nstuff okay so a couple of other things\ncork I I know I just wanted you know you\nwere a little bit concerned about coming\non because there are some people who\ntroll you and you were worried about\ngiving them ammo which i think is yeah\nyeah I mean I don't know I feel like\nit's I already exposed myself a lot on\nmy stream and I feel like I don't know\neven exposing myself even more sounds\nlike a dangerous thing talking about why\nI feel the way I feel and stuff yeah so\nmany people are gonna press on it more\nbut when I'm feeling down yeah so I\nappreciate you coming on because I think\nyou're actually doing something really\nimportant for everyone who's watching\nand this doesn't work unless people are\nwilling to come on and be authentic and\nthat's like I think the thing from\nreckful stream that people are kind of\nrunning with his AoE healing okay and\nand it doesn't like it requires people\nlike you so I want to thank you for\ncoming on even at risk to yourself the\nother thing that I want to tell you is\nthat if does if [ __ ] does go south for\nyou please let me know and I'm happy to\ntry to help you work through that like\nonline or offline like if it's there\nattacking you then we should probably do\nit offline all right thanks but you know\nI I don't want to yeah I don't want\nanything that we do here to actually\nhurt you in any way so I'm here for you\nthanks I want to get back to this thing\nthough because I think to me like it's\nkind of interesting that\nyou know you're angry at yourself for\nbeing we use the word inadequate but I\nwonder if it actually even runs deeper\nlike it's almost like the world realizes\nsometimes that you're a shitty person\nyeah that maybe I feel like I mean\ndefinitely something I've thought about\na lot whenever I'm feeling bad am i\nmyself I feel like oh [ __ ] people are\ngonna find out I'm a fraud or something\nlike that that's a shitty feeling to\nhave yeah so so this is important right\nbecause like why do you think that\nyou're a fraud to begin with like where\ndoes that sense of being a fraud because\nI think this is what happens like when\nyou succeed it doesn't actually build\nyour confidence all it does is increase\nyour terror yeah oh yeah for sure right\nwhich is weird like you'd think that\nlike people think that confidence comes\nfrom success like they think like oh\nlike Gork is a sucessful streamer like\nhe does such a good job like why isn't\nhe confident but the funny thing is that\nthe higher you rise the more unstable\nyou become yeah why what goes on in the\nlonger the fall and this is the other\nthing this is important to understand\nGork you feel like it's inevitable that\nyou're gonna fall it feels like it I\nmean I don't know my success was very\nrapid I guess mm-hmm in a sense so why\nwouldn't the downfall be as well I think\nit's goes deeper than that that's just\nlogic\nthis isn't logic okay so the let me I'm\ngonna I would ask you but I think it's\nlike a little bit too much of read my\nmind so I'm gonna start just kind of\noffering some ideas right so the person\nwho\nknows that the fall is coming eventually\nis the person who like it doesn't have\nfaith in who they are so like if I\ncalibrate to be I'm gonna use dota\nterminology because I know it cork tape\nplays dota and I play DotA so for people\nwho don't play dota apologies funny\nvideo so so like like if I calibrate to\nAnge so actually this happened to me so\nI played my first calibration game for\nfor court and I was in a group of like I\nwas in an ancient game so it was like a\nbunch of ancient slurs like oh [ __ ] and\nthen like actually a turtle I played a\nElsi offlane game and I ended up winning\nand I've actually played really well and\nso then like but I was I was actually\nterrified because I was like oh [ __ ]\nthat means like my next calibration game\nis gonna be like higher than a [ __ ]\nright or it's like instead of being like\nancient once and ain't you - so it's\ngonna be like high ancient and then then\nI ended up losing that second game but\nlike even though like I didn't gain\nconfidence from the game\nI gained fear I became more afraid\nbecause I knew in my heart that I wasn't\nan ancient okay I know that I'm like\nsomewhere between Archon and legend like\nthat's like in my heart of hearts that's\nwhat I believe about myself and I'm not\nactually nature that's like a self\ndamaging belief yeah but I believe it\nright okay like I mean I know that about\nmyself\nmmm-hmm and so what do I think is gonna\nhappen like let's say I play another\nancient game and if I believe that I'm\nan Archon player and I play like ancient\nand I win again like what happens to\nthat belief I mean it kind of depends\nbut I guess it stays there or maybe\ndisappear and I'm like oh it's only a\nmatter of time before I start [ __ ] up\nand my MMR begins to fall only a matter\nof time\nyeah that's how you feel about yourself\nright for sure absolutely\nso now we get to the point Gork why do I\nbelieve I'm an Archon why do I have your\nwords that self damaging belief where\ndoes that come from\nI don't know something you made up\nyourself comes from somewhere right like\nsomewhere along the way like I had some\nidea that like I'm an Archon so in your\ncase\nwhat do you believe about yourself I\ndon't know I mean it varies from day to\nday when I have a good day I feel good\nabout myself I feel like I'm the man no\nno no no I know you feel like you're man\nyou're the man so that's a good yeah so\non those good days when things get quiet\nand you have a moment that you stop\nthinking that you're the man what's the\nscary thought that's floating around in\nthe back of your mind you know should I\ncan't wait to have a bad day it's coming\nsoon yes right that's an Archon inside\nyou so then the question becomes like\nlike what do you think about yourself in\nthat moment\ngive me color give me flavor well I\nthink about myself on the bed I don't\nknow it's mostly just fear all the time\nI feel like I fear sometimes after had a\ngood serum I don't even want to scream\nthe next day because I fear having a sad\nstream I've been in a bad mood yes what\nare you afraid of what does that mean if\nyou have a bad stream I will feel\nterrible in myself I'll beat myself up\nabout it so then I don't want to feel\nthat way and why are you beating\nyourself up because I am not good enough\nand where did you learn that you're not\ngood enough I don't know I'm not sure\nand in your life so if we think about\nsomeone who isn't good enough it means\nthat they don't do a good job right yeah\nand you have a really powerful belief\nthat you're not good enough agreed you\nhave a really deep seat deep-seated\nbelief that you're like Guardian like\nnot even calm but gardener like I\nbelieve I'm an Archon but you believe\ndeep down that you're a guardian or\nwhatever there's nothing below Guardian\nis so like that belief is potent and\nthat you're not good enough mm-hmm and\nif we think about it like for you to not\nbe good enough you had to do you had to\nreally [ __ ] up something like really\nsimple\nlike us just play a really shitty game\nof dota and that got like burned in your\nmind what what did you [ __ ] up that was\njust so incredibly simple that the only\nperson who would [ __ ] it up would be the\nperson that like is just completely\nincompetent right that belief about\nyourself comes from somewhere no I don't\nI can't really I don't I can't really\nthink back that far I pop into my mind\nright away how did you feel like in the\npost my mind is I guess I felt like I\nfelt like [ __ ]\nactually that's not even the truth I\ndidn't even feel like [ __ ]\nthe first Wow itself sounds really bad\nno way I really felt like I think I got\nolder and more mature I was like holy\n[ __ ] I was so stupid back then that no\nwhen I got a little bit older that's\nwhen I felt like it's is really so\nsimple and if I was in his seat how\nwould I feel by my kid not coming I\ndon't know like you hear that it's so\nsimple no right that's the Guardian\nlevel language it's so simple all you\nhad to do hold on one second\nso all you had to do was show up and\nit's so simple like you see what I mean\nlike that's Guardian level like all you\nhave to do is [ __ ] like you know just\nright-click the enemy hero that's all\nyou've got to do mmm\nyou couldn't even do that and then as\nyou grew older how did you start to feel\nabout yourself\nI've always felt worse and worse every\nyear\nI feel like worse and worse right and\nworse in what way I mean it kind of\ndepends I feel worse in a lot of ways I\nthink there are too many ways there are\ntwo things I mean how did 18 year old\nfeel how did 18 year old you feel about\n14 year old you thought I was an idiot\njust that was plain and simple wasn't\nlike I had the wrong priorities back\nthen or so I'm not really sure yeah so\nI'm getting a lot of so Gorka I'm asking\nyou a lot of sort of repetitive\nquestions does it feel like that do ya\nno no no okay so I think part of what\nwe're going through is something called\nalexithymia so I think that that I can I\ncan like you understand when I explain\nanalogies right like you understand that\nlike what I mean by Guardian love will\nbelief and that you have like a really\ndeep seat set believe that you're in\nyour lack like in who you are like you\nthink that you're just a fundamentally\nlike a failure\nyeah and so despite all of your\nsuccesses you can't shake that feeling\nand that's because that feeling doesn't\ncome from done' it comes from somewhere\nelse so it's kind of like saying like oh\nlike you know you keep on losing the\ngame because you're not my mid isn't\nrotating enough and but that's not the\nreason you're losing the reason you're\nlosing is because you always [ __ ]\npick alchemist and you build you by 14\ntangos at the beginning yeah and so it's\na misdiagnosis which is why it's not\nfixing the problem mm-hmm\nand so I think that the challenge here\nis that like you understand this stuff\non an intellectual level but whenever I\nask you about how you felt it's hard for\nyou to come up with words yeah\nbecause I really genuinely feel like I\ndidn't feel anything like them yes and\nand this is because of gaming so it's\npartially because you're male partially\nbecause of your biology and partially\nbecause you're gaming so when we play\nvideo games so you kind of said like\nwhat were you doing when your dad was\ndying I was playing World of Warcraft\nand so what what do you think that does\nto the way that you feel numb absolutely\nso the problem here is that when I'm\nasking you about how you felt you don't\nremember because you didn't feel it and\nthe reason you didn't feel it is because\nyou were playing World of Warcraft and\nWorld of Warcraft has a wonderful effect\non your brain there's a part of your\nbrain called the amygdala and there's a\ncar part of your brain called the limbic\nsystem the amygdala is sort of our fear\nand survival center our limbic system is\nour emotional center of the brain if I\ndo a study and I take a bunch of people\nwho are playing World of Warcraft what\ndo you think I'll see in their amygdala\na limbic system what does it do to that\npart of the brain\nwell as Olga we flat land right there\ngood absolutely exactly correct shuts it\noff so when we play video games weeks\nthe the experience of negative emotion\ngoes away yeah right\nso like I'm hearing a couple of really\ninteresting things which suggests to me\nthat the money is somewhere around early\nhigh school so here's what I forgot so\nfar I used to be a class clown what\nhappened in high school my dad thought\nyeah right and then you became isolated\nyou started playing video games I think\nit's unfair to say I was playing a lot\nof video games before that as well sure\nbut yeah so and that but but the\nisolation started around then right yeah\nokay so the other thing that you were\nmentioning is that when did you start\ncomparing yourself to other people and\ncaring about grades that was in eighth\ngrade okay that's when you're on of\nthirteen or something for yeah I'm not\nsure and what when did your dad get sick\naround 13 or 14 I guess okay\nit was around there is one half year of\ncancer Yeah right so like I think some\nthings like there's just too many things\nand when I asked you like before we\nstarted talking to streaming I'd asked\nyou like you know when did the feelings\nof inadequacy begin like when did you\nstart compare actually not of to\nfeelings of inadequacy this is different\nwhen did you start getting satisfaction\nby being better than other people and\nwhat did you say\ndo you remember I don't remember but I\nguess it was around eighth grade then\nright with the grades yeah so there are\na lot of logical reasons why you know\nlike you didn't have grades before\neighth grade yeah you know actually you\nhad been gaming before but like to me it\nseems like bizarre that in a span of 45\nminutes we come to like this one time\nzone over and over and over again yeah\nand so I think something really powerful\nhappened to you during that time and I\nthink you don't even know what happened\nto you because there were parts of your\nbrain like you were blocking it out so\nheavily that like you didn't even\nunderstand what was happening yeah but I\ndon't you don't keep on talking about\nwhen you were eight you don't keep on\ntalking about when you were 18 you don't\nkeep on talking about when you were 21\nmm-hmm I don't remember those days so\nwell I feel like I'm well I'm also not\nsomething to mention I don't think I've\ncried since then neither since I was 13\nyeah I have definitely not cried at all\nI've been through breakups and many\ndeaths and families of I've never really\nfelt like a visceral emotional response\nto it even though I'm not I don't think\nI'm a psychopath or anything but I just\ncan't express myself that yeah so this\nis also so the alexithymia means\ninability to determine your internal\nemotional environment so you don't know\nwhat you feel yeah like your brain has\nbecome so that limbic system that\namygdala has become so shut off that you\ndon't it's almost like you don't have\nthe capacity to cry no like when when\npeople think like Oh someone hasn't\ncried like they must be really strong\nlike it's not that you're strong\nalthough you are it's just that you\nliterally don't know how to yeah and so\nI think that that like to me it sounds\nto me like you've really done one thing\nthat I can think of that justifies the\nway that you feel about yourself which\nis that you're inadequate and that\nyou're kind of like fundamentally a\nfailure and that people are gonna see\nlike even though you pretend to be\nsomething big and wonderful and glorious\npeople are gonna see one day that you're\na complete piece of [ __ ] and what do you\nthink I think that thing is well I think\nthat's related to me not visiting my dad\nabsolutely because that is the most\nbasic thing no what do you think\nI think you're it's kind of hard for me\nto like agree with you because I know it\nlike you said I feel like my emotions\nhave flatlined so I can't really fully\nagree with you because I don't know\nreally if that's the case or not yep\nso now now this is kind of an\ninteresting place right so sometimes\npeople come on stream and they like have\nthese like big emotional like oh like\nyou know like reckful was like really\nemotional and like Scotty was really\nemotional and people get really\nemotional and I think like there's I'm\nalmost concerned that there's like an\nexpectation that that's what's gonna\nhappen it's not and I can't put on the\nwaterworks I'm sorry yeah and I I don't\nthink you should alright so like even\nthat like I feel the pressure of like\nmaking you cry but I don't you're going\nin for the kill okay I mean I think\nwe're there I think it's just you're\njust so emotionally flatlined that\nthat's not gonna happen so what we have\nto do is like like you know we have to\nexplore those emotions you got to like\nlearn how to experience and remember and\nI think that the way that this is gonna\nhappen is through like actually your\nanger because you can experience anger\nOh anger can experience a lot yes let\nlet's talk about this for a second like\nI'm gonna just explain something to you\nGork so and feel free to jump in if you\nhave questions or thoughts or agree or\ndisagree so anger I want everyone to\nunderstand this anger is a protective\nemotion right so like anger is the\nemotion that we feel to bury all of our\nother emotions yeah so when I when I get\nlike when I get dumped by my girlfriend\ncan you guys imagine like sure sometimes\nI'll feel sad but other times like I\nwon't feel sad at all be I'll just be\n[ __ ] pissed I'll be angrier mmm-hmm\nI'll be like [ __ ] her like she doesn't\nknow what she's missing she doesn't she\nshe's not gonna end up with anyone good\nlike she's a piece of [ __ ] how could she\ndo this to me like [ __ ] her does that\nmake sense to you that someone could\nfeel that way\nof course right so what there are other\nemotions too like there are other\nthoughts and feelings that they could be\nhaving like what else do you think they\ncould be feeling\ninstead of anger yeah or underneath the\nanger well I guess a bunch of emotions\nlike jealousy and a hatred I guess it's\nkind of like anger sadness of course\nyeah right so there are other thoughts\nthat they could be having but they don't\nrealize they're having these thoughts\nwhich is that if she dumped me\nis everyone else going to as well like\nthat thought almost always is there but\npeople don't they don't realize that but\nthere are other like deeper thoughts\nlike am i fundamentally unlovable is\nsomething wrong with me yeah all that\nstuff is there but we just don't feel it\nso in your case Gork I think that this\nmay feel a little bit unsatisfying but I\nthink in your case you've got to learn\nhow to do a couple of things one is\nrecognize that there's something inside\nyou which I think you've already done\nwhich sort of fundamentally like you\nstart with this idea that like you're\nlike a guardian level player okay you\nhave to think about like that comes from\nsomewhere right and and out of\neverything that we've put to you I think\nlogically I think I can win you over\nalthough I fully understand that it\ndoesn't feel right that it has to do\nwith your dad but I think that's because\nyou're so separated from your feelings\nthat it's not gonna feel like anything\nif you were if you were in touch with\nbecause this is comes from a feeling\nit's not logic right and then and since\nyou're so since you're not capable of\nfeeling things besides anger right now\nyou're not gonna be able to find the\nsource of it because you're blind it's\nlike you're playing dota with your\nmonitor off and then like you know it's\nnot going to be able to tell what's\ngoing on like it's just impossible so we\nhave to teach you how to feel your\nemotions and I think the first thing\nthat we're gonna do is through anger\nlike anger is gonna be your clue the\nother thing at some point that I think\nyou should do is learn how to forgive\nyourself mm-hmm\nwhat do you think that's hard yeah\nthat's my main issue I can't do that\nit's impossible why not\nwell we said a couple words before the\nsodastream but it was it's basically\nbecause I feel like me not forgiving\nmyself is feeling like me giving up on\nimproving\nlike I think a reason I even had success\nin the first place of because I always\nno matter what like started my stream\nevery day no matter how bad I felt I\njust I just started and even though I\nhate like how I performed I started\nevery day I'm like vigilant and if I\nforgive myself and started taking it\neasy on myself I feel like I'm gonna\nstop improving that's the fear I have\nall the time so let me ask you this what\nis forgiving what what is what what do\nyou think forgiving yourself means I\ndon't know giving yourself a break from\nfailures\nokay\nand\nyou're not willing to do that it's hard\nI know it's probably better to do it but\nI I just can't there's like the block\nfor me not yeah I've thought about it\nit's destructive behavior like hating\nmyself and it only leads to me being\nworse person and being more unhappy but\nI just can't stop doing it's like the\nmain issue I have yeah so we did talk a\nlittle bit before it and and this is the\nthing that I explained to Gork which\nI'll explain to everyone else I did I\nthink in gorks case this is dangerous\nbecause the way that he treats him the\nway you treat yourself court is\nresponsible for a lot of your success\nmm-hmm right that being unable to\nforgive yourself is a lot of what keeps\nyou as successful because that's where\nyour drive comes from that's where your\nwork ethic comes from you don't know if\nyou don't deserve to rest you don't\ndeserve forgiveness you just need to do\nbetter and better and better and better\nand then like it's like you're whipping\nyourself right like you're whipping\nyourself like you're like like whipping\nlike a horse or cattle or something to\nrun you're like harder Gork harder more\nand more it's not good enough it's not\ngood enough keep going\nI don't care if it hurts you keep going\nand then what happens to social media\nand twitch come along and they say hey\nlook when you do this to yourself\nyou become what door angry\nangry sure but I was going for\nsuccessful okay right so then the world\ntells you hey this is a winning strategy\nthis works for you look at all the\nviewers you're getting so beat yourself\nup more man yeah and there's pie little\nit they just what they help help beating\nme as well a little bit right and that's\nyou guys are like that's why you you\nknow like here's the thing gorg do you\nthink you would stream do you think that\nit would help or hurt your motivation if\neveryone in stream loved you constantly\nsorry if you cut out there for a second\nsorry do you think it would help or hurt\nyour motivation if everyone on stream\nloved you constantly no I will just feel\nlike it would something would be wrong\nthen like okay good\nwhat would be wrong I mean I've had this\nbefore where I feel mad about myself and\nstuff but people feel sympathy for me\nand I mean there are generally some very\nnice people out there that feel sympathy\nfor me but then I feel like I don't\ndeserve it\nand then it just gets worse like I just\ngive you an anger because forehand\nthere's so many people out there you\nknow they're gonna be supported and\nstuff and it's like it's just but I it's\nnot right you know I didn't do well\nenough to deserve it\nyeah so when did you deserve when did\nyou how did you learn that you don't\ndeserve other people's kindness what\nkind of person doesn't deserve people's\nkindness\nGork\nI don't know nobody I guess but so what\nkind of person like why don't you\ndeserve other people's kindness like\neveryone does except you okay yeah right\nyeah but I don't know why like what is\nbecause I'm not good enough that's it\npretty much it yeah I just didn't\nperform well enough from you you're not\ngood enough yeah\ndid you feel that way when you were like\ngrowing up\nyeah a lot of the time I always had my\nolder brother to compare with and he was\nalways better is older stronger bigger\nmm-hmm never quite as good as him okay\n[Music]\nI'm smiling because I think I'm I'm a\nI have one more thing that I'd like to\nask you about so tell me about you said\nthat when you were growing up your\nparents were divorced yeah since I was\nfour okay and what were what were things\nlike you said something about your your\ndad didn't treat your mom well well my\nearliest childhood memories was my dad\nlike yelling a lot of my mom and my mom\ncomplaining a lot about my dad basically\nand I was kind of in between all that\nstuff and it sucks as a kid\nokay what sucked about it\nsucked I don't know\nsuck just the knowing that my dad is so\n[ __ ] according to my mom and that they\nhate each other so much and I didn't\nunderstand why when I was a kid I didn't\nknow what my dad had done wrong only\nthat I was taught to hate him too for\nthe first like 10 years of my life\nmm-hmm and then after that I realized\nmaybe that wasn't the full truth but\nyeah how did tell me about that how were\nyou taught to hate your dad well\nbasically it was a piece of [ __ ] because\nwell one reason I do think justifiably I\nshould maybe not like my dad my dad was\npretty well-off not super well-off but\nhe was well-off my mom didn't have like\na job and she was struggling a lot she\nwas like I remember her even crying in\nthe kitchen one day because you didn't\nhave a job and I knew my dad had money\nand could help us out but he'd like bail\non us and that made me start hate my dad\nas well a lot and also made me really\nfearful of also running out of money one\nday though that would suck a lot being\nlike my mom crying on the table like in\nfront of my kids that it's very shitty\nshe like drained my brother's bank\naccount just to be able to pay month's\nrent and stuff and that's really\nsomething that [ __ ] with me and in\nwhat way well ever since ever since that\nmoment I remember that moment very\nclearly ever since that moment I've\nnever liked I never liked spending money\nlike whatever money I make right now I\nsave everything because I'm really\nfearful of running out of it and I hate\nspending on anything that's excessive\nfor myself mm-hmm because I'm afraid of\nlosing all my money and yeah well like I\nsaid my dad could have helped us out but\nhe didn't and my mom was stuck in a\nshitty situation and do you remember I\nmean so it sounds like you remember a\nspecific instance where your mom was\ncrying yeah I remember that very clearly\nhow did it do you remember what it felt\nlike to watch her cry\nI don't know I just remember I felt I\nfelt like angry and I felt sad because I\nthink that that's as I mean genuinely\nwhen I thought about is that I think\nthat's what a lot of things that drives\nme is the fact that I don't want to be\npoor like that and you know I don't want\nmy mom to be out of money again she's\nbetter now but what were you sad about I\ndon't know I was sad about her being sad\nI'm not sure I was too young to\nunderstand really yeah hmm and what\nchanged for you around the age of 10\nwell like I said I just got a lot more\nmoney conscious at a very young age I\ndidn't spend my allowance I didn't do\nanything like that I just gave it all\nback to my mom hmm that's rare\nI felt very different from other kids in\nthat regard but I just didn't feel right\nhow are you different from other kids\nthat I didn't like spending money I\ndidn't like buying toys and [ __ ] like\nthat okay hmm I'm gonna think for a\nsecond is that okay no of course I'm\ndebating between asking you what you\nwant help with and trying to figure out\nwhat you need help with sorry you cut\noff for last aren't there I was I'm\ndebating in my mind between asking you\nwhat you want help with like how can I\nhelp you and trying to figure out for\nmyself what I think you need yeah the\nthing is I feel like I have so many\naspects that I could need help with I\nguess I mean not many but a couple of\naspects like I mentioned feeling\ninadequate and always having a fear of\nrunning out of money and stuff but yeah\nI guess if you ask me what I need help\nwith I guess it's dealing with my ego in\na way and breaking out of this cycle of\nconstant self-hatred about everything\nbasically\nokay so breaking out of that cycle of\nconstant cycle of self-hatred involves\ntwo approaches one is that we have to\nget to the root of where the self-hatred\nexists okay and we have to fix that we\nhave to heal it know the other thing\nthat we can do is stop the process of\nthe cycle not get the root but just like\ncancel it in the middle so I'm gonna do\nboth we're gonna do both okay now the\nfirst thing is that as I mentioned to\nyou before so let me just think for a\nsecond so I think this actually segues\nwell into what we normally do on Sunday\nso I'm gonna try to explain to you gore\nhow your mind works and like like a\nfunction of it okay so you have this\nunshakable belief that you're inadequate\nand not good enough and that the rest of\nthe world it's only a matter of time\nbefore everyone knows you know that's\none part of your mind and whether that\ncomes from whether it's too simplistic\nfor me to sort of believe that that\ncomes from your dad and like watching\nyour dad die I think it's actually more\ncomplicated than that I don't think you\nare quite as emotionally dead as you\nsometimes come across I think actually\nwe're missing it by a little bit and I'm\nactually getting I'm overvaluing your\ndad's passing I think there's something\nactually before your dad's passing that\nis actually where the money is and it's\ngonna take more time to explore and\nfigure that out\nmmm-hmm there's something weird about\njudgement and self-worth and like\nthere's one question that I've been\nwanting to ask you and I just haven't\nfigured out\nhow to frame this and it's like did you\nthink that if you had done a better job\nyour dad would have been nicer to you\nguys or would have been around more no I\ndon't think I blame myself for that okay\nI couldn't find kind of in a real like\nusually I ask one question related to\nanother question I couldn't find\nanything relating to that but I just\nhave to wonder something about you know\nit just sounded strange that he was kind\nof demonized and around the age of ten\nyou started to like think like maybe\nthis is different\nyeah because we started having more\ncontact with each other basically we\nstarted meeting up on every weekend took\nme out doing stuff I guess yeah and you\nsay that your dad loved you a lot\nyeah I think so yeah and and so I mean I\nI think you blame yourself a lot for not\ngoing to see him before you died before\nhe died sorry yeah I did I do and and I\nthink when you blame yourself for that\nlike you start to think that your aim it\nwas such a simple thing and such like a\ncore thing for a son to do for their\nfather mm-hmm that like that that crime\nin your mind I think is unforgivable\nyeah I don't like to think about it a\nlot because it feels so I guess it feels\npointless cuz he's already dead because\nI can't really do anything about it\nanymore so when I said that first second\nyou bit your lip what did you feel in\nyour body I don't know okay I don't know\nhow to put it into words okay close your\neyes okay tell me what you feel in your\nbody right now\nI don't know I feel so emotionally numb\nbut I don't really feel anything\nI'm not asking about emotions I'm\ntalking about physical sensations okay\nwell I was very aware that my breathing\nwas very shitty now so now is our\nbreathing better okay well I feel like\nmy breathing was extremely shallow okay\nI'm just in the stomach yeah for okay\nand and what were you feeling in your\nstomach or your chest or your throat\nwell I was feeling really uncomfortable\nbecause my palms are really sweaty and I\nguess in my chest I was feeling a little\nbit of trembling for some reason I don't\nknow why yeah\nmight be related to the breathing okay\nwhat are you are you still feeling the\ntrembling maybe a little bit I'm feeling\nsome discomfort in the chest there eyes\nclosed okay sorry so I want you to put\nyourself in the shoes of 18 year old\nGork I'm thinking about 14 year old cork\nyeah what do you what do you what do you\nfeel in your body when you like remember\nthe way that you used to think about\nyourself for not going to see your dad\ndoesn't feel some guilt but it's not\noverbearing because I feel like it 18 I\nwas still in the clouds playing my video\ngames so when did it start when did the\nguilt start to get bad the guilt started\nto get worse the older again so I feel\nlike this is the worst right now\nI'm 26 because when you think about your\n13 year old self how do you feel about\nthat 14 year old cork my 13 year old\nfeels about my 14 year old and oh sorry\nhow does how does the current gorg feel\nabout your 14 year old cork my 13 year\nold self what happened back then what do\nyou mean my so today when you when you\nthink about the way that you used to be\nlike just today yes when you think about\nwhen you were in high school and your\ndad was sick how do you feel about\nyourself I just feel stupid but I feel\nlike I wouldn't have done anything\ndifferent today because I have not\nmatured since then really I'm just the\nsame idiot playing games and only\nthinking about myself\nwhat do you feel right now in your body\nas you say that I feel like comfortable\nas they're filling with my hands I don't\nknow I felt like I started pressing a\nbit on myself because I mean maybe it\nwas a way to self punish I'm not sure\nokay uh yeah you guys felt stupid I\nguess\nyeah what is what a stupid feel like in\nyour body like flushing hot sensation I\nguess where my neck throat face okay is\nthe flushing still there a little bit I\nguess\nokay so Corky I want you to sit up\nstraight okay okay and I want you to lay\nyour palms face up on your knees I can I\nlook okay yeah and I want you to breathe\nin slowly and out slowly and then again\nand I want you to notice continue\nbreathing and notice the temperature of\nyour breath and everybody at home should\nbe doing this to tell me what you notice\nabout your temperature the temperature\nof your breath now notice it's hot and\nmoist because it my mustache is\nabsorbing it okay so you're you're\nnoticing the breath on your mustache\nthat's what you're paying attention to I\nwant you to go into the nose what do you\nnotice about the breath in your nose\nwell I noticed it's kinda hot because my\nroom is too [ __ ] hot right now\nhot going in or coming out going in okay\nso I want you to follow it if you follow\nthat sensation of heat as it enters your\nnose and where does it go well first it\ngoes in my chest and then I start\nfilling up my stomach okay what happens\nto it is it goes into your chest and\nstomach you feel warmth there yeah\nwarmth a little bit of tingling okay and\nthen follow it as you exhale as well so\nit goes down into your stomach and as\nyou exhale can you follow it back out\nyeah does it change it all on the way\nout yeah\nfeels like it's smoother going out okay\nnow I want you to pay attention to your\nshoulders below your stomach does your\nbreath to go there well it does now but\nif maybe then before okay follow that\nsensation we talking about shoulders or\nbelow the stomach goes through the\nstomach mostly no okay so pay attention\nsee if it goes even a little bit beyond\nthe stomach into the hips into the legs\nwhat do you feel feel a nice warming\ncalming sensation of my body is okay is\nthat something that you feel often not\nreally what is your production\nwhat does your body usually feel\nuncomfortable I guess a little bit\nsundar shallow breath okay now I think I\nknow how to help you mm-hmm first of all\nwhat did you think of that practice I\nthink it was nice\nI've tried meditation before but I\ndidn't feel like it helped me a lot but\nI feel like it helped a lot when you\ntold me what to do\nso we're not gonna get so you're not\ngonna be able to forgive yourself unless\nyou first master anger you cut off there\nso I said you're not gonna be able to\nforgive yourself until you first master\nyour anger everything is being buried by\nyour anger anger is the only thing you\ncan detect even in terms of so what's\nhappening is like for men especially who\nare Alexa thymic the way that I help\nthem understand their emotions because\nmany much like yourself like you guys\njust can't it's like you're colorblind\nand it just doesn't matter how hard I\ntry to tell you to see the blue or the\npurple you just can't see color and\nyou're not gonna be able to see color\nyou see just one color which is anger no\nright\nso it's my belief that the anger in this\nwe've talked through before that you\nhave some deeper sense of inadequacy or\nshame or your piece of [ __ ] or you don't\ndeserve like everyone else deserves\nforgiveness right but who doesn't\ndeserve forgiveness court me absolutely\nso just like think about that for a\nsecond that is not logical at all that\nabsolutely comes from an emotion that\ncomes from a sense of self that comes\nfrom a sense of self that is just you\nhave committed crimes so bad that you\nare unforgivable yeah so somewhere in\nthere you committed something you did\nsomething where you got this belief that\nyou are just not worth you're not worth\nanything and even though we can\nlogically kind of get to it I don't\nthink you can get to it emotionally\nwhich is exactly what you need to know\nbut in order to get to it the problem is\nthat your anger protects you from it\nbecause when you get angry at yourself\nand winch it and when those five percent\nof twitch chat starts hating you you\njust jump right on board because you're\nlike this is a game I know how to play\nyeah like I understand how to do this\nlike this make actually in a weird way\nthat makes you feel good it does it\nmakes you feel like it makes it it's\njust right it makes you feel righteous\nlike this is what I deserve\nlike they see me for the person that I\nam which is like a real piece of [ __ ]\nyou're like I can get on board with that\nyou guys want to beat the [ __ ] out of me\nlike let me show you how you can get on\nboard with that and as long as that\nfeeling is there you're not gonna be\nable to get underneath mm-hmm so you\nhave to dismantle the anger how through\nthem by breathing right so the next time\nyou you start to tilt on stream so\nyou've got a couple of options one is\nthat if I can catch you while you're\nlive I would love it like not live isn't\nstreaming but it's so hard to evoke\nemotion and you that like I want to talk\nto you while you feel these things while\nthey're in your face and while all of\nyour adaptive mechanisms to protect\nyourself are too weak\nyeah uh-huh I just found it completely\nhilarious thinking that you've been same\ndiscord as me while I'm streaming and\nyelling and you telling me to calm down\nI'm not gonna tell you to calm down oh\nno no buddy I'm not gonna tell you to\ncalm down not at all [ __ ] no all right\nI'm gonna tell you to feel all right\nbecause you have you have these earmuffs\non right so you can't detect emotion\nbecause you're blocking it out so what\nwe need to do is like when the volume is\nway turned up and you feel a lot of\nemotion that's what we need to talk\nbecause then if I start asking you\nquestions you're gonna be able to feel\nthings yeah yeah I think you have a\npoint there yeah yeah I also saw\nsomething in your eyes that I haven't\nsnow at all whoa let's give let's give\nto a chat a chance what are you guys\nseeing in gorks face right now they got\nit are you watching twitch chat I wasn't\nI avoid it what did they say they said\nhope okay is that what you feel yeah\nfeels nice talking about it it's very\nrare to do something like I guess\nhelpful for myself yeah that is not self\nhatred related then you know like so\nit's always nice yeah right so like just\nthink about that for a second why don't\nyou do things for yourself Gord\nwhy aren't you kind to yourself because\nI don't deserve it\nthere you go you don't [ __ ] deserve\nwrite crimes against humanity so it\nstarts with anger mm-hmm\nso we have to get you to decompress your\nanger and we have to see what's\nunderneath because anger is that\nprotective mechanism it's like you know\nanger is like it's like justice it's\nrighteous it's like you know like you\nknow there's just so much like we have\nto get underneath that and see what's\nunderneath\nwhen you start to tilt when you start to\nget pissed when you start to feel these\nthings about yourself and I suspect that\nthere's a part of you that actually\ndoesn't want to feel those things when\nyou're talking to me like I don't even\nthink you want to solve this problem\nlike there's a part of you that's like\nthis is my life and like this guy's\ngonna take it away from me and so you're\nactually existing like you don't like\nyou want to be helped like there's a\npart of you that wants to be helped but\nthere's a part of you that's like if\nthis guy does it then I'm gonna be I'm\ngonna be [ __ ] out of luck because this\nmust be myself I move exactly so just\nthink about that for a second you think\nthis is who you are you think you're\nunforgivable you think that you're\ninadequate you think that you don't\ndeserve forgiveness it's it and your\nwords are then I'm not going to be\nmyself anymore this is who you are\nit's not even think this is who you are\nyou believe you are this is what you\nknow you are mm-hmm and so at some point\nit's gonna require hope and it's gonna\nrequire facing your fear it's gonna\nrequire courage it's gonna require\nyou've gotten so comfortable with the\nidea that you're you're a piece of [ __ ]\nthat you're terrified to even check the\nthought that you may not be is so scary\nyeah what would it mean if you weren't a\npiece of [ __ ] well I don't know\neverything I've built so far I feels\nlike I've built on being a piece of [ __ ]\nso what does mean not being one so like\nyour world comes crumbling down around\nyou right and I think it's got to it's\ngot to doesn't mean that you're gonna\nfail but your world absolutely needs to\ncome crumbling down because the world\nthat you built is like toxic dude yeah\nit's so toxic it's got to come down all\nof it\nthat requires courage because once it\ncomes down you don't know what you're\ngonna see\nGork this is crazy okay but yeah you are\nin an abusive relationship with yourself\nyeah I can see that right and like\npeople get confused because why don't\nlike people from the outside get\nconfused they're like why don't people\njust like leave their abusive\nrelationship why don't people move on\nwhat do you think because it's familiar\nabsolutely yeah right because at least\nyou know what you're dealing with so the\nmind prefers the familiar to the good\nvery important thing for everyone to\nunderstand the mind prefers the familiar\nto the good\nprefers comfortable or known to the\nunknown\nand this is a life that you can continue\nliving like you can do this you could\nbeat yourself up you can suffer am I not\ngonna die when I'm like 40 out of some\nkind of stress or related disease then\nlet's go feels like where I'm heading\nthrough right now yeah good I mean not\ngood that you're yeah I mean good that\nyou're noticing that this is not a way\nto live your life good that you came on\ntoday how do you feel about coming on\ntoday I feel glad that I came on I'm\nglad you're very understanding and I\nfelt like I needed to do something for\nmyself that was productive I had for\ninstance at I like had like a very I had\na couple bad streams in a row today\ntoday I decided to cut it short because\nI didn't want to enter that emotional\nstate of anger and sadness so I cut it\nshort but I promise to do something at\nleast to help out that night I'm glad I\ndid something at least I'm glad you did\ntoo\nyou know why I'm glad you came on stream\nor because you did something for\nyourself you were nice to yourself\nhow did you treat yourself by coming on\nstream\n[Music]\nI treated myself nicely worked on all\nstream yep you also face your fear you\nfaced your uncertainty you were afraid\nto come on weren't you yeah for sure\nso this is like this is awesome because\nyou were afraid of something that\nabsolutely could happen which is that\nyou're trolls could attack you which is\nthe risk that anyone takes by coming on\nstream is that they'll get attacked yeah\nI wouldn't say that was yeah that was a\nmaybe there was a big fear but I I then\nagain I realized most people are\nactually pretty nice online yeah it's\njust a few people that are rotten apples\nI guess but so I want you to just think\nabout this for a second Gork because\nlike you realized right but like you\nrealize like you knew that before but\nyou didn't realize it until like\nrecently mm-hmm that's what needs to\nchange because that fear of that 5% used\nto keep you back it used to control your\nbehavior and already now by this\nrealisation this is important there's a\ndifference between knowing or like\ninformation and realization realization\nis how you break the cycle\nthat you knew this before but before you\nwere letting that knowledge control you\nwhereas now you realize that it's really\nonly 5% yeah\ndoes that make sense yeah but that's\nlike my biggest issue I feel like I have\nthe knowledge about a lot of things I\nneed to do right but I don't know what\nhow I realize it you know how do I make\nit a reality\nso you do it the same how did you do it\ntoday\nby talking to you yeah that helped I\nhelped them stepping outside of my\ncomfort zone or didn't mean anything no\nso I think all of the above is the short\nanswer right so I would say the\nfundamental source so this is important\nfor everyone to understand so I think\nthere's actually great for Sunday stream\nbecause this is all about meditation so\nhow do we change the person that we are\nhow do you change it's not information\nyou feel like you already know what you\nneed to do you're unable to do it so how\ndoes one change how did you become this\nway was it through information\naction action and more importantly\nexperience it was experiences that maybe\nway this way no and so what you've done\ntoday absolutely is correct you acted\nright and you acted to have an\nexperience outside of your normal realm\nof experience and if you want to break\nthe cycle you can't keep on putting in\nthe same things like if I'm baking a\ncake and I put the same [ __ ] in it every\ntime if I put like flour and sugar and\negg and milk and then I take a dump and\nmix it all together and bake it it's\ngonna taste like [ __ ] if you keep on\nputting the same inputs you're gonna get\nthe same output so if you want to break\nthe cycle you can't think your way out\nof it you have to experience your way\nand so what did you do today like you\ntalked to me you came on stream and by\ndoing so you actually face your fears\nright the whole reason you wanted to\ntalk in private was because you had very\nlegitimate concerns your concerns are no\nless true they just hold less power over\nyou and right now the reason that your\nlife is so stuck is because there are\nthings that hold there are things within\nyou that hold power over you\nso that you're cut off so so the the\nreason that you're stuck is because\nthere are things within you that hold\npower over you\nthe only book they hold power over you\noh yes yeah right you don't get to\ncontrol them they control you your anger\ntowards yourself your sense of\ninadequacy those are the things that\ndictate your life your inability to\nrelax what else is gonna dick and like\nthis maybe I don't know if you wanted to\ncut it off here but sure and go if if\nyou release anger and release whatever\ndictates yours you you to this point\nwhile will drive you forward after that\nthat's the thing right so let me ask you\nlike what's behind that question it's\nfear so fear is gonna drive me know no\nfear isn't gonna drive you I think the\nreason you're asking me that question is\nbecause you're afraid yeah right the\nreason you're out asking me because like\nthis is the only thing I've known what\nhappens like am I is my life gonna end\nif I give up these things if I give up\nmy anger and I give up my shame and I\ngive up like the bad person that I am\nlike how can I move forward and they're\nyou absolutely can but I don't think\nthat I'm gonna answer your question but\njust understand that this answer is not\ngonna change you okay you have to\nrealize it I'm giving you information\nmm-hmm right so in my case it's the\nDharma so Dharma means duty or\nresponsibility mm-hmm so the things that\ndrive me are not ego are not being\nbetter than other people but for me it's\nservice in your case I think it can be\nDharma but I think you have a Dharma\nalso like so you have a duty or\nresponsibility to yourself to be the\nbest person that you can be\nand being the best person you can be\nstill means you stream everyday that's\nfine it's just the reason you're\nstreaming is different it's to be the\nbest dota player you can it's not to be\nbetter than anyone else it's to be the\nbest there's a subtle but very important\ndistinction between those two because\nyou owe it to yourself to live the best\nlife that you can you owe it to yourself\nto make lots of money and also spend a\nfair amount of money you owe it to\nyourself to build yourself financial\nsecurity but not to be a miser out of\nfear because you saw what not having\nmoney did to your mom you owe it to\nyourself to be like free and have fun\nand to meet people and to fall in love\nyou owe it to yourself to do all these\nthings to take care of yourself\nphysically to increase the ventilation\nin your room to not die at the age of 40\nyeah you owe all of these things to\nyourself\nby the way do i all these things myself\nI mean why why do I have to feel it you\nknow I don't have to feel it you owe it\nto yourself yeah okay but I don't think\nthat you're gonna understand why until\nyou have it mm-hmm but what I would tell\nyou is because generally speaking all we\nowe to ourselves is to be what we are\nright like what is a rock oh to itself\njust to be itself what is the rain oh to\nitself just to be itself that's all we\nroad is to be what we are but I I don't\nthink that you nor do I believe that\nhuman beings their true essence is\nself-hatred in feelings of inadequacy\nyeah right and you understand that about\nother people you understand that the\nrest of the human race is entitled to\nself forgiveness like that's obvious to\nyou mm-hmm but not you\nso you have to live and it starts with\nthis is a very concrete thing is to it's\na good question by the way is is to the\nnext time you get angry is if you feel\nyourself start to tilt or even before\nyou stream like do this practice right\nas you begin to stream like before you\nstream before you even like start like\nstream labs or whatever used to stream\nlike you're gonna you're gonna have\nthese feelings arise like am I gonna do\na good enough job today like what if I\ndo a good enough job like and we're\ngonna let people down like what's gonna\nhappen so notice all that dialogue\nhappen in your mind and then close your\neyes and feel what you feel in your body\nthose thoughts are gonna come with some\nsensations warmth heat tension sweaty\npalms and your body and your mind are\nconnected so even if your mind doesn't\nknow what the emotion is your body is\ngonna feel it and so for men the biggest\nway to overcome alexithymia the door to\nunderstanding your emotions is your body\nso your body will tell you the thing is\nlike when you say like like just think\nabout this for a second I was like what\nare you what are you feeling Gork and\nyou're like I don't know I'm like\nphysically really hard yeah yeah so like\nphysically like you're like my palms are\nsweaty like what emotion is associated\nwith sweaty palms fear yeah I guess\nright fear maybe man because hundreds\nunreal my room is super hot I'm an open\nwindow now because yeah everything could\nbe clouded by the fact I open my window\nair there we go yeah so so and this is\nthe thing is like you know sweaty palms\ncould be anything could be excitement it\ncould be lust yeah maybe you were\nfeeling horny like did you have an\nerection like so like yeah but the point\nis like as you as you experience this\nyou're gonna find something you're gonna\nfind something that you feel in your\nbody right yeah and and then and then\nyou I want you to breathe through it and\nso you'll like dissolve that emotion a\nlittle bit you'll start to understand\nyour emotions a little bit more you'll\nstart to be able to figure things out\nabout yourself\nand then you'll start to be able to see\nwhat's underneath the anger because once\nyou take the anger away the rest of that\nstuff is gonna be there\nyeah thoughts questions from chapter\nfrom me you first then he first okay\nwell I agree with everything you said\nthe one thing I have a big problem with\nI guess is finding the motivation to get\ninto action after having like a bad\ncycle in my head you know yeah I had a\nbat I've had a bad stream and it goes\ninto the next day and instead of doing\nanything like I know I've done this\nbefore like I've taken walks before\nscream and I know my stream is gonna be\nbetter but the only reason I don't take\na walk is because I'm like [ __ ] I don't\ndeserve oh I don't deserve a good stream\nnow or I hate myself so I'm gonna press\nI'm gonna wake up and I sit down I'm\ngonna press the shark swim button and do\nthe same thing all over again\nso how do i how do I actually like it\nsounds so simple but how do I push\nmyself to not do that and just do what's\nactually good for me so the answer is\nactually gonna be a little bit\nparadoxical you need to stop pushing\nyourself and you need to let yourself\nbecause just think about this we push\nourselves when we don't like pushing\nyourself is the same as like not it's\nlike whipping you're whipping yourself\nthe whole reason you're stuck is because\nyou've gotten everywhere through\nwhipping you need to learn a different\nway besides whipping okay so like just\ncut yourself a break\nright say like hey like I really do not\nfeel like screaming today let me see if\nI can find some way to do it so you go\nfor a walk you close your eyes you do\nthis practice feel what you feel in your\nbody and then notice that even as you do\nthe practice that part of your mind is\ngonna start taking over that's gonna be\nlike oh you're [ __ ] doing it wrong\nlike why the [ __ ] do you even like why\nare you even doing this it's stupid\nyou're stupid you're just sitting there\nlike you can sit there and breathe like\nit's not gonna do anything just stop\ndon't do it notice that too because\nthose thoughts are gonna create a\nsensation in your body and look really\nhard look really deep find where that\nbreath go\nin your body and that with each breath\nsomething within you that's tight is\ngonna be loosened up and then is going\nto relax it's like you're stretching out\na rubber band like over and over and\nover again and that rubber band is like\ntight and it's like angry and it's like\nI'm gonna be like stiff and you're\nstretching it and then relaxing it\nstretching it and then relaxing it and\nthen after a while it's gonna be like -\nlike loose and then it like won't won't\nhold its tensile strength anymore\nsanshiro you know let me see if we can\nfind a question let me see if these are\nabout me or you in cells gene site hook\nall right okay so someone was asking you\nhow do we cope with alexithymia so I\nthink this is the main thing like so\nthis is what I was explaining to Gork is\nthat the way to get through alexithymia\nis by working through your body right so\nlike when you're in a situation that you\ndon't feel good and you don't understand\nwhat you feel focus on your body and\nthat as you do things as you understand\nyour body you can do this breathing\npractice where you follow the breath to\nthe parts of the body where you feel\nlike some kind of negativity and then\nlike let that breath out because like\nGork was kind of saying that the breath\nwas hot coming in and it was hot going\nout but it was like a better hot going\nout than it was a hot going in right no\nit's kind of like weird to say - like\nwhen I said just if you guys just walk\nif you clip this it doesn't make any\n[ __ ] sense but if you did the\npractice you know what I'm talking about\nso that's like experience right like\ninformation I can tell you okay so you\nshould do this practice of Gork and it's\ngonna be hot going in it's gonna be hot\ngoing out but when it's hot and going\nout it's gonna feel better and you're\nnot gonna understand what the [ __ ] that\nmeans like I could tell you that but\nit's not gonna change anything about\nyour life it's the experience that\nchanges things\nso start with your body and then second\nthing is breathe into it and follow the\nbreath where it goes and over time we'll\nwill explore a little bit more about\nwhat that means but work let me ask you\nsomething\nwhere does your breath go in your body\nlike physically do you know well\nI consciously try to get it into my\nstomach at least I know breathing into\nthe chest is not so great\nyeah so and when you feel something like\ndoes the breath go into your stomach\nthis oxygen go into your stomach I hope\nso\ndoesn't yes right so oxygen goes into\nyour lungs oh yes yes of course yeah\nwhere where do the lungs end do you know\nuh well somewhere on the stomach I guess\nyeah like the top of the abdomen right\nso they end it like somewhere around\nhere in the front and in the back they\ndon't go down pretty far so then what do\nyou do do you have any oxygen in your\nshoulders no you have a nice zoom in\nyour stomach no so then what are you\nfeeling when you breathe in I mean you\nfeel something there I you know I guess\nme expanding my stomach for no reason\nunless you can follow the breath there\nright like you feel the warmth of the\nbreath go into your nose and into your\nthroat down your chest and into your\nstomach you feel the warmth in your\nstomach yeah it's kind of weird so the\nYogi's called that branagh or Chi yeah\nso they said that there's this life\nforce that that flows throughout our\nbody and at the simplest way that I can\ngive people a perception of Chi is\nthrough this practice because you don't\nhave any breath in your shoulders like\ndoesn't make any sense but chi or prana\nis not not like physically correlated\nit's like not a real thing but it's a\nsensation it's something that you can\nfeel can you feel the blood oxygen\ncoming into the blood do you think or is\nit related no okay\nI mean not that I know of I haven't\nheard anything I mean you do have\nreceptors that detect the oxygenation of\nyour blood but I don't think that\nthey're certainly not in your shoulders\nand I don't think that there's any\ndirect perception of that like\nwhat we feel from that is like a sense\nthat we need to breathe more or breathe\nless know but they sure as hell there's\nno there's no oxygen in our shoulders or\nour stomach so I don't know what you\nfeel I don't know from a nerves\nstandpoint like what we're detecting but\nanyway so\nGork last thoughts or questions before\nwe wrap up for the day no no no thanks\nfor taking the time to talk with me and\nall thanks for coming on yeah just one\nor two things so good luck to you let me\nknow if I can be helpful yeah you know\nif you want to talk it doesn't have to\nbe on stream or anything but if you find\nyourself in a rut like just DME okay we\ncan talk through things for a few\nminutes and then you know if you want to\ncome on stream that's fine too\nthough and the last thing Gore is so for\neveryone so Gork is I think you're\nactually like aren't you the most\npopular dota2 streamer I mean I'm I'm up\nthere at least but I'm not sure if I'm\nthe most vocal I mean like when I watch\nwhen I logo struggles with that every\nday but like when I when I just look at\ndota 2 yeah\nlike you're the one who's at the top of\nthe list it's me and Bulldog I guess on\nthe English side it kind of depends on\nthe day okay well Bulldogs gotten some\ninteresting flack recently I also had\nsome interesting as well it's all day\nwe're all taking some heat not quite as\nbad well yeah okay well listen so you\nguys should check out gore extreme\nunless do you want them to come and\nwatch you or no I mean if they want to\ncome and watch sure see how I'm dealing\nwith mangers\nyeah so actually can we ask twitch at\nfor a favor Gork what are we gonna ask\nthem so I want them to come and help you\non stream help me yeah can we can we\ntell them no they're band they're just\ngonna say no smiley face there do you\nknow what does that even mean whose band\nno they're saying no smiley face what\ndoes that mean I don't want to come help\nno they need to why not because it's\nfunny\nis that like okay so it's some of you\n[ __ ] need to go and you need to help\nGork so you need to notice when he's\ntilting and remind him oh boy that's not\ngonna help\nno people already remind me all the time\nI don't worry about it\nno no but they need to remind you in a\ngood way is that a bad idea if it's a\nbad idea I'll tell them not to do it a\nman if they just come come in and type\nof pogchamp that's alright you know okay\nreminder tape or do their breathing\npractice would that tilt you more\nmaybe it might X should tilt me more but\nit's helpful to have a reminder yeah\nyeah so notice that - right so like in\nthat moment is they is they're saying\nsomething the part of you that feels\ninadequate and angry is gonna try to\ntake their messages of love and support\nand make you feel more inadequate\nbecause these [ __ ] in twitch at have\nto tell you to do it you can't even\n[ __ ] do it yourself yeah exactly\nthat's what that's what happens in your\nmind right and notice that be aware that\nthat's gonna happen and that's not what\nthey intend I can tell you right now\nexactly what's gonna happen in your mind\nyou can be like [ __ ] I can't even do\nthis [ __ ] on my own I'm gonna just turn\noff stream and I'm [ __ ] shitty no just\njust just breathe take a second sit up\nstraight\nback needs to be straight feel that\nfeeling and then breathe into it\nyeah okay right yeah the the the thing\nis I I think it's great it's just so\nhard when you're in this state and the\nonly thing I do is cue next game and I'm\nlike reiterating what went wrong the\nlast game but it would be great - I\nthink if I could find the mental\nstrength in between games like sit down\nand breathe for like a minute yeah\ntwitch app do we need your help with\nthis right because I can't I can't be\nthere or I can try but twitch chat can\nbe there so catch Gork between games and\nGork you got to tell me if this is not\nworking and then I'll tell them to stop\nI just find it very hilarious but like\njust try and then like twitch chat also\nneeds to let you know that like it's\ngonna be hard for you\nyeah and then they need to forgive you\nif you're not able to do it that's\nalright okay now we have yes smiley face\nand maybe smiley face okay sir smiley\nface and maybe smiley face that's great\nthat's all you can really ask for yeah\nso like like seriously help him because\nthis is important we talk about tarama\nwe talk about helping people I can't\nhelp everyone I can't be watching gore\nXtreme 24/7 because I'm talking to you\nguys so when would Gork is streaming and\nhe's tilting like like ask him to notice\nit right and be with them and you guys\nshould do it too because it'll help you\ntoo\nthe more you meditate the better you're\ngonna feel No\nokay I just tell him to breathe and he\nknows ok can we can we can you do that\nfor twitch at Gork I can do that so so\neven if you don't deserve kindness I\nwant you to think for a second about\nthem so these are people who are\nwatching this stream and actually give a\n[ __ ] enough to come to your stream sit\nthere wait for you to tilt and then\nthey're like waiting around because I'm\nactually trying they're trying to help\nyou yes how does that make you feel\nhilarious I'm sorry it doesn't it feel\nnice that there are nice people out\nthere so don't let them down\nGork of course not you can bring\nyourself down as much as you want to but\ndon't let them down of course ok good\nluck man you thank you man thanks for a\nmeal\ntake care bye thanks for coming on OK\nyeah man that's that's a serious\nalexithymia right there like if you guys\never wondered what alexithymia is that's\nit right like I think you guys I'm\nactually I love that twitch at like you\nguys saw the hope in his face see he\ndoesn't even understand that he has hope\nlike if I had asked him like what do you\nthink is gonna happen like that complex\nand his mind is gonna say like it's not\ngoing to help it's just and and but it's\nthere right so that's how change happens\nso for all of you guys who are wondering\nlike how does change happen just watch\nthat interview and you'll see it at the\nend you can see it in his face his\ndegree of animation his posture like\nthere's something very subtle and small\nchanging inside him"
