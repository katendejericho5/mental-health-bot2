    "transcript": "if you look at all of the studies on\nmeditation basically the ones that show\na clinically significant change do a\npractice for three at least three days a\nweek 20 minutes a day for eight weeks so\nwhen I'm treating someone with\ndepression or anxiety I tell them if you\nwant to see a substantial benefit to\nyour depression let's say what you would\nget from an antidepressant or\nanti-anxiety medication it's gonna take\neight weeks of practice for three days a\nweek at a minimum for 20 minutes so I'd\nsay that you should practice for you\nknow I'd say give it two months where\nyou're practicing three to five days a\nweek that being said I've found a lot of\nvalue like some people feel great after\nlike three minutes of meditation so I\nthink a lot of the confusion around\nmeditation when they say how long does\nit take to be effective it depends on\nwhat you're doing right there are\ndifferent kinds of meditation and if\nyou're not doing the right kind of\nmeditation technique it's not gonna feel\neffective so the problem isn't that\nyou're not doing it long enough it's\nthat you're doing the wrong thing and so\nit's kind of like asking someone like\nhow long does it take to get good at\nfalling asleep well it sort of depends\non how you're falling asleep fact are\nyou drinking caffeine before you fall\nasleep because for some people that\ndoesn't matter and for some people it\nmatters a lot\nare you sleeping a room with no noise or\na lot of noise because some people like\nsleeping with the TV on some people have\nto sleep in absolute quiet\nare you sleeping under the covers or do\nyou like to have like a cold room and\nunder under blankets that's what I like\nI like sleeping in a cold room with a\nbunch of blankets other people like\nsleeping in a warm room with a thin\nsheet people have different ways to\nsleep and so different meditation\ntechniques are important because like\nyou have to do one that fits your\ncognitive in your neuroscience\nfingerprint the reason there are\ndifferent kinds of meditation techniques\nis because our minds are different our\nbrains are different and to calm the\nmind requires a different technique for\na different kind of mind\nand so yeah so someone's saying I get\nreally frustrated angry with meditation\nis that normal sure so my guess is that\nthe reason that you're getting\nfrustrated and angry with meditation is\nbecause it's not doing what you expect\nit to do which in turn is the problem\nbecause as long as you hold on to an\nexpectation met you're not going to\nenter a meditative state so like it's\nabsolutely frustrating right like yeah\nbecause you're holding on to an\nexpectation the expectation prevents you\nfrom attaining the state of\nconsciousness that meditation is which\nin turn frustrates you and it's because\nyou're expecting so the way for bigger\nb-12 meditate is for someone to teach\nhim a practice and then tell him it's\nnot don't tell him it's meditation it'll\nwork he just has to know that he's not\nhe's know for him to meditate\nsuccessfully he just has to know like\nget tricked into meditating so I'd say\nthat a good a good technique for bigger\nbe one is so I I'll show you guys one\ntechnique for people who were frustrated\nwith meditation okay then we'll do\nsomething to help with depression and\nanxiety and help gizmo out calm down\nyour sympathetic nervous system so this\nis what I want you guys to do close your\neyes and listen to the sound of your\nbreath\nlisten to the sound of your breath so\nyour breath has noise it has a sound you\nshould be able to hear something if you\nwant to you can put your ear fingers in\nyour ears and then listen\nyou\nthen what I want you guys to do is try\nto spell the sound of your breath\nso understand that like all sounds can\nbe spelled phonetically like it's not\ngoing to be a perfect to process\napproximation but what are the sounds\nhow would you spell the sound of the\nbreath\nyou\nso we would for example like the the\nnoise that a cat makes we spell Meo w\nthe sound that dog makes we spell wo Oh\nF\nand so how would you spell the sound of\nthe breath\nokay so now everyone's just typing out\nrandom that's a great place to\nstart so then the question becomes I\nwant you guys to refine it further and\ngo deeper\nhe's the sound of inhalation different\nfrom the sound of exhalation\nyou\nright so then what are those two sounds\nyou\nyou\nyou\nso now what I want you guys to realize\nis that chances are this is gonna be\nhard to understand but the more you\nlisten to it the more you're gonna be\nable to refine the sound you guys are\ntossing out an answer because that's\nyour first impression but the closer\nthat you listen like just look at what\neveryone's typing they're like a lot of\ndifferent dimensions that people are\ncovering some people are using Ages some\npeople are using s some people are using\nmultiple vowels some people are using\none vowel\nthere there there Em's there's so like\njust listen and try to see if anything\nthat I don't want is typed in twitch\nchat\ncan you hear their sound\nyou\nyou\nokay so now what I want you guys to do\nis stop typing in twitch chat\nclose your eyes and just listen\nyou\nyou\nokay now I'm gonna teach you guys have\nwe done Darth Vader breath yet haha\nwhat's the right answer you guys do it\nfor a month and then get back to me\nright so do it for a month and see like\ndo it every day for one month and see if\nyou understand\nso like understanding the sound of the\nbreath is is like expanding your palate\nright like the more you train your\npalate the more you'll be able to detect\nand so the more you listen the more\nyou'll get like it's like you know what\nif you have an unsophisticated palate\nand someone feeds you something you eat\nand you're like yeah that was delicious\nthat's true guys are doing you're like\nthis is delicious this is the sound so\nunderstand it deeper listen to it really\nlisten to it and then once you feel like\nafter you do one week of this practice\nthe second step is to see or listen\nwhere do you hear the sound of the\nbreath in the external world the sound\nof the breath is present in other places\ncan you find out where where do you hear\nit it's not just the sound of the breath\nit exists and other things is to go\nlooking for it but in order to find the\nsound of the breath you really have to\nunderstand what it looks like Oh what\nit's what it sounds like you really have\nto be able to detect it and understand\nit well within yourself before you are\nable to find it in other places yes\nocarina okay so now I'm gonna teach you\nguys Darth Vader breathing technique\nokay and it's hard to describe like how\nto do this technique except to breathe\nlike Darth Vader so this this technique\nis called ujjayi pranayama and what it\nis it involves contraction I would say\ndo it for three to five minutes at a\ntime so it involves contraction of the\nthroat in a way that produces this sound\nand if you guys want to know how to\nunderstand that with the throat with the\nthroat so if you want to know how to\nmake that sound you have to breathe like\nDarth Vader right so you go like this so\nwhen you do when you when you make the\nDarth Vader sound you're gonna when you\ntell you when your mind tells you to\nbreathe like Darth Vader it's gonna\nautomatically contract something in your\nthroat that's what you want to contract\nso take a snapshot of how Darth Vader\nbreathing what it does to your throat\nand then do that to your throat and then\nbreathe normally with that contraction\nokay and then close your eyes close your\neyes and practice we're going to\npractice for three minutes\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\ngo ahead and finish the breath that\nyou're on\nlet your eyes remain closed\nyes\nsit with the person\nyou\nyou\nokay\ngo ahead and let yourself come back\nokay\nso thank you all for coming thank you\nfor listening and participating\nand\ngo ahead and wrap up for the day if\nanyone has a suggestion for who to raid\nwe'll do that so I think just to kind of\nrecap you know the today's stream was\nabout a little bit about lupus a little\nbit about anxiety a little bit about how\nto change our diet and to sort of\noptimize our health what's what what\nhelps with inflammation but also how do\nan act simple behavioral changes how is\nit like sure we should eat certain\nthings but how do we go about eating\nthose things a little bit about the\norigins of anxiety and a little bit\nabout meditation"
