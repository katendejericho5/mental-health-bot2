    "transcript": "who hurt you so bad that there is no way\nto apologize for what they did there's\nno way to fix that hurt where did you\nlearn in the core of your being that\nthere are some wounds that will never be\nhealed\nso sky tell me a little bit about first\nof all thank you for coming on and so\ntell me a little bit about what we're\ntalking about today and how twitch at\nand I can help you if anything what are\nyou talking about today\nwell I honestly don't even really know\nbecause I you know I I guess depression\nsucks right like everybody kind of feels\nthat and anxiety is terrible sure um\nthere isn't anything really like\nspecific I guess I wouldn't really even\nknow what to target okay fine\num is it okay so we exchanged a couple\nof DMS with you and and is it okay if I\nshare some of those because I think that\nmay give us a direction yeah okay yes\nyou kind of said like hey like I have\nmaybe some depression or anxiety but but\nI even feel like the problems are like\nunfixable there's something about this\nthat like that's impossible to be fixed\nright and I think a lot of people feel\nthat way so if it's okay with you can we\njust start there sure what do you think\nis unfixable yeah go for it sorry oh\nyeah also like yeah I'm a completely\nopen book so I won't struggle to talk\nabout any topic okay thank you for that\nman just like you know\n[Music]\nI guess like I just feel that at this\npoint in my life that I've corrupted so\nmany people in my like close friend\ngroup or my friend group in general that\nthe habits that I've picked up to\nsurvive are so toxic that I don't know\nif they could be like edged out of my\nmind and it makes me feel like I just I\nguess I'm just gonna be trashed now like\nyou know yeah you made it hard yes so if\nit's okay with you that's what we're\ngonna talk about okay because that\nsounds that sounds you know way more\nreal than depression and anxiety right\nso somewhere along the way like you've\nrealized that you have some kind of\ntoxic patterns and that they're so\ningrained they're so they're X so deeply\nwithin you that you're [ __ ] you're Sol\nyeah I am so I I actually think that I\nthink I might be one of the most toxic\npeople on earth I'm not even kidding\nokay it's bad why why do you think that\ncan we talk about that is that okay sure\nyeah yeah um well I I don't I don't\nnaturally like have empathy I'm not\nreally good at that sure and what does\nthat mean not being good at empathy like\nI just don't like I whenever whenever I\nneed something from anyone no matter\nwhat it is it's like my mind goes into\nthis mode where it's just like let me\nget something from someone and then like\nwill save them later will help later but\nI don't even know if I even believe that\nand then I get what I need and then I'm\nfine but then the aftermath is me just\nfeeling shitty about it later but I\ndon't know it's weird\nwell um why do you feel shitty about it\nwell normally I don't feel guilt for\nmany things not too many things like I\nyou know obviously I'm a person that\ndoesn't really live with regrets if I do\nsomething bad it's like in that moment\nthat I did that being bad\nit is what I wanted to do so it's hard\nfor me to regret it because it was like\nwell that was my choice that I made\nthere but I feel bad about it because\nlike all these people that they just\nwant to help me and then I take their\nhelp and I just I just I just piss it\naway and then I'm back in the same\nproblems over and over and over again\nand that's why I feel like I'm\ncorrupting people like these people are\ngiving me their hearts and their minds\nand sometimes their wallets and they\njust there's there's no return they're\njust trusting something happens and then\nnothing happens how do you know that\nnothing okay how do you know that\nnothing happens I look at my youtube\nchannel and I I see like like devoid of\ncontent and what's worse is that when I\ndo make content it's either half-ass or\nit's me crying about something or it's\nlike a like a sponsored video and I'm\nnot really creating the thing that put\nme on the platform in the first place\nand then you know I'm in the same\nsituations because I'm not actually\nmaking the proper changes in my life I'm\njust taking what they give me just to\nfeel comfortable for even another week\nit's not good okay sky I think um okay\nI'm just gonna think for a second okay\nthat's fine yeah okay so let me\nask you this so you say that you're you\ndon't you're not empathic right so a lot\nof things you just tossed out a lot and\nI thank you for being an open book\nbecause there are some things to me that\nI can't put the puzzle pieces together\nand I'd like your help with that\nso you say that you're not empathic but\nat the same time it seems very clear to\nme that you feel like you're corrupting\npeople and you wouldn't feel that way\nand like you feel like you're kind of\nletting people down\nYeah right I mean big-time really like\nyeah but but if you were truly not\nempathic then you wouldn't have the\nfeeling of like disappointing people\nthat's that's true however I'm confused\nin in myself because I don't know if I\nactually care about that or rather I\nknow that I'm can get cancelled no I\nthink you care about that America\nbecause it's so so here here's the\nconflict okay so one is you take from\nothers and you don't live up to\nexpectations they invest in you and you\nlet them down right and then you have\nsome feeling because you talked about\nfeeling guilty but then like 30 or 60\nseconds later you said I don't regret my\ndecisions because I acknowledge that\nthat's what I want in the moment and\nthat's what I needed I made the choice\nthat I made I'm gonna own up to my\nchoice and I don't regret it and I think\nwhen when I put my head in the mindset\nof someone like that I can imagine that\nyou feel like that is a lack of empathy\nyes right I I would think so yeah so I\nthink that is actually something that\nyou do to protect yourself from the vast\namount of empathy that you have\ndamn yeah I mean I'm listening right so\nlet's just let's just let's go through\nthe daisy chain okay like we're gonna\nconnect the dots so dot number one is\nthat people are investing many people\ncare about me people do things for me I\nask them for things and they give me\nthings right that's not number one dot\nnumber two is I feel like I'm letting\nthem down I feel guilty I feel like\nthey're giving me all this stuff and I'm\nquote-unquote pissing it away okay\nyou\nwhat are you feeling I'm about to get\nbodied what does that mean it means\nyou're good and I'm pretty sure that I'm\nalready thinking about things a little\ndifferent so I just know that\ni-i playfully think of everything in my\nlife as a contest it's really harmless\nlike if I get full from a burger I'll be\nlike damn that burger just bodied me or\nI just got you know I got beat by the\nburger right so it's like it seems in\nthis discussion you're gonna open me up\nto a lot of things that I believe are\nhealthy and good which are things that I\nhaven't considered so in my head\nplayfully I'm just like I'm about to get\nabsolutely like my mind bout to get [ __ ]\non which is good it's a good thing I\nreally need to be taken down a lot of\nnotches and I don't think that's your\ngoal the same that I think that hearing\nknow accepting another no no you don't\nneed to be taken down a lot of notches\nyou need to be pumped up a lot of\nnotches ah that's okay we're gonna get\nto this okay we're gonna get to it okay\nokay so you take from other people you\nfeel guilty for taking because you piss\naway what they give you and then that\nhurts\nright yes yeah does it\nyeah yeah does I mean especially with\nlike some of the people being really\nimportant to me if they'd like yeah yeah\nyeah so if it hurts that means you're\nempathic actually all right yeah so so\nthen comes the protection so this is\nwhere you get the idea that you're not\nempathic because then your mind tries to\nprotect you it steps in and says you\nknow what this hurts so I don't regret\nmy decisions because if I don't regret\nmy decisions that I don't have to feel\nhurt\nlike they're a bunch of suckers like\nthey know I don't deliver\nand they give anyway and so like that's\non them like I make my choices I live by\nit I'm transparent with them they know\nwhat they're getting themselves into is\nthat what you tell yourself I don't I\ndon't think that they're I don't think\nthat they're suckers I think in the\nmoment that I take their help I really\ndo believe that I can make a change and\nmake a difference but then the feeling\nfades like before I go to bed and then\nit's just the same cycle of okay it's\nnot channeling so so apologies if I over\nspoke there maybe not that the doctors\nwell but that you know there's a certain\namount of like if you tell yourself that\nyou don't regret your decisions then\nlike if you if you do away with regret\nlike guilt goes with it\ndoes that make sense yes so like when\nyou tell yourself that then it's like ah\nI don't have to feel guilty because like\nthis is just who I am and then and then\nlike that I mean I I think you're\nactually deeply empathic and I think\nyou're very worried about what you're\ndoing to people because you use the word\ncorrupt\nlike you feel like you're like that's\nnot a sociopath doesn't think that\nthey're corrupting anyone they just\ndon't give a [ __ ] right\nlike you're concerned of you're\nconcerned about what you're doing to\npeople\nyes\n[Music]\nI am definitely concerned\n[Music]\nyeah I mean I guess that just I just I'm\nthinking about this a lot so take your\ntime never really I think the only the\nonly reason why I keep I was like\ndiagnosed with antisocial disorder when\nI was 15 and so ever since then I've\nkind of had this ideas like okay well\nI'm defective so and many of the things\nI think about are just like not normal\nI can definitely level with you on the\nempathy thing and I do care but I don't\nknow my mind is just kind of okay that's\nokay we're here sky so we're gonna work\nthrough that okay you need a minute no\nno I'm good okay so so I think that I\ncan understand why someone would have\ndiagnosed you they wouldn't have\ndiagnosed you with antisocial\npersonality disorder would've been\nconduct disorder if you're 15 but I\nthink that there's a part of you that\nfeels like you take advantage of people\nand that you manipulate people oh I mean\nI know it yeah so so I think that's\nthat's what people think of that makes\nyou kind of antisocial or like\nsociopathic because you take advantage\nof other people and then you have the\nbest of intentions and you wake up the\nnext day and you don't honor your thing\nso that's kind of like where the\nantisocial kind of stuff comes okay yeah\nI have the best of intentions for what\nI'm preserving like what that's that it\nmeans that like like I've been the\nlifestyle I live is what requires all\nthis help which is a lifestyle of using\nwhat now little money I have to support\nall of my best friends living with me\nand so it's like I've done that ever\nsince the beginning of YouTube even a\nlittle before I worked like three jobs\nbecause I don't actually spend a lot of\nmoney on myself so I figured that you\nknow when YouTube first started for me\nand I was making a decent amount of\nmoney besides giving it to my mom I was\nlike oh let's get a place like you guys\nare my friends and I don't want to live\nwith strangers and this is fun\num but then of course like when you just\nbaby them and you give them a bunch of\nstuff and you pay for all their bills\nthey don't learn to grow and then\neventually if I get depressed they can't\nhelp me so other people that I've met\nthrough my field would reach out and\nhelp but I would never really be honest\nabout what they were helping which was\nagain this terrible idea of giving my\nfriends everything and bringing them\nwith me everywhere yeah so now so let so\nsky that actually makes a lot of sense\nand we're gonna get into that in a\nsecond but the first thing is I'm gonna\nask you when so when you think about\nsomeone who works three jobs and\nsupports all of their best friends do\nyou think that that person is lacks\nempathy and takes advantage of people um\nI only feel that way because of what I\nget out of it it's like I'm not doing I\ndon't think that I'm doing it for their\nhealth because if I was doing it for\ntheir health I feel like I would have\nmotivated them to be better and do more\nthings okay rather like more like okay I\ndon't really want to be in a house by\nmyself because I don't know how that\nwould be so let me just fill it with\npeople that I'm familiar with\nso what are you looking for there I mean\nat this point I don't even know I think\nI think right now it's like I have no\nidea what I'm looking so sky let me ask\nyou something\nwhen did you learn that you are you\ndisappoint other people god damn I'm\nokay\ngeez probably when I was nine\nyeah that's when I knew I was a semen\ndemon as soon as I knew I was gay I was\nlike that's it like I'm my family how my\nman is Indian like Guyanese and my dad\nis black and he'd be like if you're gay\nyou can not lay with another man here\nbefore he knew that any of us was gay so\nit was like well there's step 1 and then\nI don't know what I'd be a dog you know\nso yes you know I want to be a comedian\nthat I would go to school just look like\nthat yeah so I think this is important\nbecause the common thread and like I\nwish I could like rewind on twitch and\nshow you this but the common thread and\nI started like framing questions like\nthis is it's all about not living up to\nexpectations so you take from others and\nyou assume it's like axiomatic for you\nlike you accept it as true that you're\ngonna let them down like what actually\ntears you up inside is that you're\nletting people down that like people are\ndonating to your YouTube channel but\nyou're just creating this shitty\nsponsored content that like aren't even\nthough you stream every day and you're\nactually still making content and they\nkeep on supporting you you just get\nconfused because you're just letting\nthem down over and over and over again\nand you're taking advantage of them and\nyou're corrupting them because why are\nthey investing in you and you're just\nletting them down and they're just gonna\nget let down and like why don't they\nstop and run away from you from your\nlike corrupting influence because all\nyou are is a disappointment\nyes oh my god yeah that write that on my\ngravestone so that feeling comes from\nbefore all of this like this is very\nimportant to understand Skype that truth\nit feels a truth to you that you're just\nyou're just disappointment you're\ndisappointment walking around right like\nthat truth is colors everything all of\nthis evidence that is being thrown your\nway where people are saying sky we like\nyou we love you like so I rated you the\nother day and I was watching your stream\nthis [ __ ] phenomenal man no it was it\nwas great like people loved you you're a\nlikable guy and and like you just can't\nsit with that that thought\nit and you want these people to come and\nyou like you open your home to them\nbecause like you you want them to like\nnot be disappointed by you yes I I see\nmy patterns of what I do and it's like I\nnow now unfortunately right because the\npattern keeps going no matter how good\nyou are there's going to be diminishing\nreturns if you keep trying to come back\nto content and then leave so like\nobviously I'm sure that you've heard\nthis a lot but when it comes to\nviewership be it on stream or on YouTube\nwhatever you do it is so hard to like\nfight off the feeling that you're just a\ndying artist and a lot of people that\nthey if they fall off or their career\ngoes sour I believe that many people\nmight not understand what happened but\nthe worst thing for me is that I know\nwhat happened I know why it happened I I\nknow why it happened to right so here's\nwhy it happened because you disappointed\npeople because you didn't live up to\nexpectations you weren't good and I\ndidn't yeah true by not coming back and\njust always saying I'm gonna come back\nand then I don't like but but so the\nthat's the things guys so I want you to\nlike really like stop and think about\nthis for a second okay\nbecause you have this presumption at the\nbeginning you have this cheat sheet\nwhich says the answer is that sky is\ngoing to disappoint\nyou've jumped to the ant-like you know\nlike you've watched the climax of the\nmovie like you've watched the end the\nbig reveal is that Skyy disappoints\nand and so I think the biggest problem\nyou say you need to get knocked down a\ncouple of notches no man like I think\nyou need to understand that you have\nvalue in that you don't like sure at\ntimes all human beings disappoint other\nhuman beings but twitch is actually very\ngood at sniffing out [ __ ] and if if\nwhat they see in you is not the act that\nyou make because I know like I I think\nthat your authentic\nI don't really have a persona yeah and\nso but somewhere along the way like you\nrecognize that you're not your authentic\non stream and at the same time like you\ndon't think you're good enough when\neveryone is telling you that you are\nwell because there's there's definitely\nlike there's I guess it's not it's not\ntangible there's ways that we can\ndetermine whether someone is a powerful\ncontent creator or not by way of their\nnumbers and what they're pulling and who\nthey're entertaining like yeah I'm that\ncould be really good but if I'm used to\nget you know like 7 9 K streams on\naverage and now I'm down to like 1.3 and\nit's like Scott but yeah okay so like\nthat's fine so the the the assault on\nyour ego from not being as big as you\nonce were is actually is completely\nthere but I think that that is a\nseparate issue from the basic idea that\nyou do not feel like you can live up to\nexpectations well yeah I mean people\nhave given me so much [ __ ] that it's\nlike well that'd be Donald Glover or\nelse what do you mean by give get have\ngiven you so much [ __ ] I mean I've been\ngifted and granted so much to just\nsurvive that you know if all these\npeople are going out of their way to\nhelp me in the ways that they have they\nmust believe in me in a way that I don't\nin myself so it's like [ __ ] like that's\nthe problem because when they look at\nyou they believe when I look at you I\nbelieve I believe I don't get right and\nyou just don't get that but this is cool\nbecause just think about this first\nthe second sky your problem is not that\nyou don't create good content or that\nother people don't believe in you\nbecause like how can they believe in you\nthey can only believe in you because\nthey see something like they don't just\nwalk down the street and they're like oh\nthere's some random guy let's choose\nlike I choose to believe in here no they\nsee something and their judges right\nlike twitch twitch is like very\njudgmental and they know what they like\nand they know what they don't like and\nsometimes people try to minute\nlike twitch and twitch doesn't respond\nwell to that and they see something of\nvalue they see something of real value\nwhich is why they keep coming back the\nproblem here is that like your success\nor failure has nothing to do with I mean\non a very objective sense of course that\nhas something to do with your viewership\nand all that stuff but like I don't the\ncore of your problem is that somewhere\nalong the way you decided or you learned\nthat you can't live up to expectations\nin that your core you're a [ __ ]\ndisappointment and until that goes away\nthe cool thing is if that can change all\nof your corruption all of your negative\npatterns they all stem from that\nso\ncorruption is only that I feel that I'll\ndisappoint the people that believe in\nwhat I can do sort of so I think the\ncorruption is that like people are\ninvesting in you and they're gonna be\nhurt by it that there's no way that you\ncan you can give them what they deserve\nyeah and so their lives and their left\ntainted because they made the mistake to\ninvest in something that is not worth\ninvesting it in something that's always\ngoing to come up short\nand so they're hurt by association right\nI mean and and and you know I don't even\nknow if they think that it'll ever be a\nmistake\nyes so good because it's not about them\nsky it's about you they don't know they\ndon't even know that they're getting\ncorrupted right they don't even know\nthat they're like like you know they're\ngetting corrupted they may not they have\nno clue and that's what makes you guilty\nthat's where the guilt comes from\nbecause you're hurting them and they\ndon't realize it and they keep coming\nback\nand they keep supporting you and you're\nhurting them and they keep coming back\nlike a dog that's been kicked they\n[ __ ] keep coming back and you keep\nkicking away\ndamn you gotta bring up the kick dog\nexcept the ones that don't come back\nsure so I mean there there's a whole\nvery real angle of like twitch streamers\nand like you know sighs and subscribers\nbut at the end of the day I think this\nall comes down to this like basic idea\nthat you have in your head that you're\ninevitably going to disappoint\nyeah um to give you a specific example I\nguess something that I notice about my\nyoutube channel is that I have a very I\nhad a very very unique rise I guess in\nthat my channel it never blew up like\nthe most subs I've ever gotten in one\nmonth was 40,000 right and of course to\npeople like oh yeah blow up great but it\nnever went over that but I made videos\nevery Friday and you know for three\nyears I was consistent and I got to 900k\nand everything was whatever however\nalong the way there have been channels\nthat actually blew up the people that\nare getting 200k subs a day right and\nthere and they're straight to a million\nand there are superstars which at first\nI was jealous but that at the same time\nI was happy with what I had but it is\nhard to believe that you're destined for\nsomething great when you just see people\nblow up in the ways that they do and\nit's like oh well my blog wasn't like\nthat in fact my blow-up was rather slow\ndoes this mean that I'm just slowly\napproaching you know above mediocrity\nlike I don't know it was it was really\nreally hard to understand why I wasn't\nwhy I didn't get that treatment ever I\nguess\nokay so sky great point so I want to\npoint something out to you so it's my\nbelief that there is the development of\nthis belief about yourself right which\napparently happened when you were 9 and\nthen there are all of the consequences\nof that belief and the way that you deal\nwith those right so for example like\nthere's the feeling guilty because\nyou're not empathic and you're letting\npeople down and then there's the\nprotective mechanism or the response in\nyour mind which is that you tell\nyourself that you don't regret your\ndecisions do you see how like there's\nlike a cause and there's an effect\nthere's like a start and there's an end\nand so I think all the stuff about\nYouTube is all like responses to the\ncomplex with which you view the world\nyou have a lens and then all the stuff\non YouTube because I think that's all\nlegitimate like you can feel you know\ninsufficient when you compare yourself\nto meteoric Rises of other youtubers and\nthings\nI think though all those feelings are\nreally legitimate but I think if you\nwant it you're saying that there's\nsomething fundamental about you that's\nunfixable I don't think that that thing\nI don't think the root of that thing is\nthat you're not as successful of a\nyoutuber is like other youtubers I think\nthe root of that thing is wherever you\ngot this idea that like you can't live\nup to expectations in it and so that if\nyou want your patterns to change you've\ngot to get to the bottom of that so tell\nme about gogo I don't know where to\nstart with that oh yeah no yes you do\nbecause we already know where to start\nwith that tell me about being nine oh\nGod being nine oh my god there's a kid\nnamed Travis Barrios they got he choked\nout a guy named Joey Dimas and everybody\nwas freaking out and I just wanted to\nbang him like I have no idea what I was\nthinking but it was crazy like that nine\nto me that was that that was the truth\nlike I it was a of course you know I'm\ntelling myself I'm not gay but then\nagain you know I'm just walking around a\ncockney is and I I did pretty well in\nschool at that time once I realized I\nwas gay I was like well I'm not gonna\nget anywhere unless straight A's and I\nnever I have to leave that as soon as\npossible\n[Music]\nand I had a lot of like friends normal\nfriends everything was fine the only\nthing that was difficult was you know\nhome life with my family like moving\nback and forth and their divorce and\ntheir drama but if there's one thing my\ndad and mom kind of agreed on\nindividually is like being gay well that\nmight not be okay like that was hard to\nkind of maneuver and then and then when\nI was around I think 11 my brother\nliterally read my sister's diary found\nout she was a lesbian and then outed her\nso now yeah so now I'm like god damn NIC\nlike that made a lot a lot of things\nharder for me because of course she's\ngetting chewed out and I'm just like how\ncould you Alex like how could you even\nbe that but of course I'm not telling\nher this I'm just thinking in my mind\nalex is your sister your brother yes my\nsister my brother's name is Nick he's\nthe worst person so yes okay yes\noh go on so I mean I'm just you know I\nthink Skyy you do a you're a fantastic\nstoryteller and I think you know you you\ntalk about things in a very kind of\nlarger-than-life sort of way and it\nsounds funny like you make it sound\nfunny and I found myself like enjoying\nthat story like right thank you yeah but\nthat's not an enjoyable story that story\nis [ __ ] awful it's pretty bad yeah it\ngets it I mean it's actually it's\nactually really really really bad but\nwhy do you think it's why are you able\nto talk about it in a way that's funny\nlike does it hurt talk about it\nnow at this point now like okay it's\nit's annoying like I mean I it's\nannoying and it is actually genuinely\n[ __ ] up beyond belief I'm not even\nkidding but yeah have you said this\nbefore by the way um\nyeah when I was 15 okay this is Lady I\nwe just kept playing this stick game and\nyou have to like put the sticks on your\nhand and then you drop him and you can\nonly pick out a certain colour the [ __ ]\nis that I don't know I mean she she was\nnice she would use that to ask me about\nhome life while I was trying to pick up\na green stick I thought she was cheating\nbut and then she would talk about like\nmy stepdad and all those problems and\n[ __ ] like but that you know that only\nlasted like maybe a year and a half then\nI thought there I start therapy again or\nmy mom made me do it when I was like 19\nand then now I'm 29 and you're here just\nto be clear this is not therapy sure\nright we're just chatting this is just\nchatting on Twitch\nthis is just chatting that's not fair\nso but I just want to so in a lot of\nways sky it seems like you've grown and\nyou've moved past this and you've become\ncaught become confident in the person\nthat you are like that's that's what I'm\ngetting from you now that's a great\nthing to hear I would say that I've I've\nmoved past it but the damage that's been\ndone is just irreversible and so it's\nlike yeah so I agree that you've moved\npast it I agree that the damage has not\nbeen repaired\nI don't think it's irreversible I think\nit's completely logical for you to think\nit's irreversible right because you\nmoved past it without fixing it did you\nwatch the last interview a little bit of\nit okay so I don't think it's\nirreversible I just don't think you've\ntried to fix it in the right way because\nwhat you've done is you've moved past it\ninstead of fixing it you moved on with\nyour life with ever actually addressing\nthe underlying issue and unless you've\ntried to do that huh sorry it's really\nbad though okay do you want it I mean I\ncan I can tell you I'm only warning like\neven your viewers I actually don't even\nI should really get your page open you\nknow what actually I think that I didn't\nopen your Twitter page because I was\nabsolutely terrified of chat but I\nhorrified actually I just I can't even -\nI was gonna be fragile but anyway I I\nusually give a trigger warning because\nit's that bad so I was like I don't mind\ntalking about it I'm asking you though\nlike I can tell you but it's bad so so\nlet me okay let me so thank you for\nbeing cautionary I really appreciate\nthat I actually don't know how to\nnavigate this kind of situation but let\nme actually first ask you this or you\nsaid you were afraid of being fragile\n[ __ ] yes\ndamnit what do you mean by pharrell\nbegin\nah cuz like you know everybody's like\nsaying [ __ ] like oh you know um man up\ntoughen up like don't let them like get\nthicker skin like you don't you don't\nhave to care people think I care about\nwhat everyone thinks I don't care who\nyou are you could be an infant if you\ndon't like me it hurts so it was like I\nand I'm not gonna lie to people like on\nTwitter I'll be like ya know I care\npeople that hate me I'll tweet at them\nwould be like hey let's talk even if it\nhurts I want to learn something that's\nmy genuine approach so in twitch chat is\nlike twitch that the culture I'm sure\nyou're aware to me I love Twitter yet\nyou're older because they make me laugh\nbut damn they could be vicious if you\nare not on your [ __ ] if they don't like\nyou they will let you know and they will\ndig in your soul and I figured that like\njust for now I'm gonna just pretend that\nI'm talking to you privately yeah so\nSkyy what what are you afraid of them\nseeing with you being fragile Oh [ __ ]\nanything mister mr. Potatohead people\ncall me that what is that like a line\nwith me a lot of words they they could\nsay anything like literally anything\neven if it's like neutral and I'll feel\nodd are you sensitive are you being\nfragile I think so yeah yeah I mean how\ndoes it feel shitty in what ways I'm\nalso six five like I'm a big ass [ __ ]\nlike I'm huge so it's weird for me to be\nlike especially like an in person oh I'm\nlooked at as someone like oh walk me to\nmy car you know protect me from the\nmuggers and the rapist and I'm like I'm\nI'm walking and I'm like well I hope we\ndon't get mugged or a plate I'm just as\nscared if not more so and I will throw\nyou to the assailant I'll run away so\nbeing that fragile like is not good for\npeople to know which is why I'm saying\nin here on your stream run of all of\nthese people yeah but I mean so so I\ndon't think you come across as fragile\nwhat a good good form even I I\ndefinitely am so what so what is someone\nwho's fragile feel like look like let's\nstart there me yeah do you think they\nsmiled I think that they they will use\nmechanisms that are paper-thin that what\nyou're doing I don't know ma'am I I feel\nlike maybe but I also oh I don't think\nthey're paper-thin oh but I think you\nare using mechanisms right so I think\nyou laugh a lot and you come across as\nconfident yeah that's fine laughing I\nthink you laugh when you become\nuncomfortable about things and it sounds\nlike that's actually a winning strategy\nbecause you've sort of figured out that\nevery time you're on stream you're\n[ __ ] terrified and you're anxious it\nsounds like and that brings out after\nwhich twitchchat loves i actually don't\nthink that i'm i'm never uncomfortable\nlike i always feel really good about\neverything like everything i do when it\ncomes to especially with people like\ni've never been shy currently in this\ndiscussion right here like I'm not\nparticularly uncomfortable I wouldn't\nsay incredible it's more like I'm I'm\ncurious to see like where it goes and\nI'm anxious for the result but I mean I\nfeel personally totally fine of course\nnow that is in contrast for let's say\nthe twitch chat was just lighten my ass\nup and I'm looking at the chat if it was\nhere then that would bring the\nuncomfortability cuz it's like damn but\ncurrently I'm completely fine and yes I\ndo smile and laugh a lot about it you're\nright about literally everything good or\nbad in my group of my best friends we\nall have a you know it's like three\nthree people that I live with her or my\ngenuine best friends great people that I\nfeel nothing negative about and we have\na lot of bad things that happened to us\nbut we joke about it like it was nothing\nand we love it we don't feel any pain or\nanything that's the way that I conduct\nmyself doesn't work for other people but\nyeah so I mean I think sky\nfortunately our unfortunately you know I\nthink for you to be\nto be fixed I think you've gotta move a\nlittle bit past the humor oh right so I\nI think that like it sounds like stuff\nreally bad happened growing up oh yes\nand and since it and there's just it's\nweird like I don't know how else to\ndescribe this but you have you know you\nhave this persona where like you give us\nall these disclaimers and stuff and\ntrigger warnings and so like to me that\nactually feels like misdirection like I\ndon't doubt that there's legitimacy to\nit but like the the phrase that I latch\non to that gets you to pause and\nactually makes you feel a little bit\nuncomfortable is like\nmentioning that you could be fragile\nit's not talking about all the bad [ __ ]\nthat happened to you because there's\nsomething like you've learned how to\nview that in a particular way your view\nof your past has become like you've\nadapted to it you're resilient you've\nkind of learned how to move past it\nyou're kind of okay with it now but I\nthink that that's like kind of like it's\na shell that you put over it but that's\nthat yeah that's why I said that it's\nunfixable okay so in sometimes when you\nget an infection your body forms\nsomething called an abscess okay and an\nabscess is like where you have that\ninfected part your body kind of like\nwalls off the microbes and forms like\nthis like sphere which has like all this\nlike scar tissue and [ __ ] like that and\nthe infection is like stuck inside and\nthat's a survival mechanism that your\nbody does to prevent the infection from\nspreading the problem is that when you\nhave an abscess the infection is stuck\ninside and so it's like running rampant\nin there like nothing gets in and\nnothing gets out so in order for an\nabscess in order for the the infection\nto truly be healed do you have any idea\nwhat people do to an abscess right it\nabsolutely\nright and so unless we open up the\nabscess you can have an abscess well not\nfor years but you know you can have [ __ ]\nwalled off and your body's like there's\nno way that's getting fixed because\nwe've walled it all off\nand I think that's that's what you've\ndone because here here's what I'm\nhearing from you okay that you have you\nknow this diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality disorder at the age of 15\nthat you have some patterns in your life\nthat are so intractable so unsolvable so\nunfixable and that you corrupt\neverything you touch\nthat's like a really bleak way right and\nso if we think about what kind of human\ncan survive that it's you\nit's the larger in life it's the\nsurrounded by friends\nit's the laughing at the good and the\nbad that's the only way that's the only\nway you survive that [ __ ] only wait\nthat's your abscess and you're torn\nyou're torn because you feel guilty and\nyou don't know how to deal with those\nfeelings of guilt so you choose not to\nregret your decisions that you tell\npeople you live every day without regret\nyeah and you regret every day okay yeah\nright right I just feel like it's kind\nof I feel like I feel like sometimes\napologies are so hollow like yes I\nbecause you can't make it right you\ncan't make it right because you\ndisappoint so you can't make yeah right\nthere's men I feel like I'm maybe this\nis a dollar and it could be a dumb thing\nto say but it's like I feel like if I do\nsomething bad to someone it is so hard\nfor me to apologize because I feel\nhonestly that I've taken away if I do\nthat even though something I can't fix\nif I apologize it makes me feel like I'm\ntaking away their bad guy and I know\nthat I feel about that um it might sound\nweird but it's like I do feel a type of\nway and I don't like the sky it but I\nyeah well who who hurt you so bad that\nthere is no way to apologize for what\nthey did\noh Jesus follow the question who hurt\nyou so bad\nthat there is no way to apologize for\nwhat they did there's no way to fix that\nhurt where did you learn in the core of\nyour being that there are some wounds\nthat will never be healed\noh I have a minute yes okay okay\nI'm just going to fill this with water\none second okay Jesus you were you're\ngood this is terrifying\ntake your time you also don't have to\nanswer no I'm gonna answer okay remember\nI talked about anything I've never been\nasked that question ever um okay let's\nsee who my my brother my mom my\nstepfather and my dad and not my sister\nif I were to put this in a tier list it\nwould be my brother up here in S Plus\ntier by himself and then a critical\nspace and then a - tier would be my mom\nand then my dad probably next to her and\nthen my stepdad I mean he's just he's\nliteral trash so whatever you can just\nput him somewhere else this guy this is\nimportant right so like I think that\nso good job first of all I'm glad you\ntook a minute I'm glad you thought\nthrough things yeah so I want you to\nunderstand that like the way that you\nview the world is not wrong it was\ntaught but like you have some\nfundamental things that you think since\nthese things are true for you your\nsituation is unfixable and those things\nare first of all that you disappoint and\nsecondly that you can hurt someone in a\nway that can never be healed yeah in\nthat second in if that's the case so now\nnow we come back to the original\nquestion right so when I asked you the\noriginal thing what are we talking about\nwhat is it that is unfixed what is it\nthat is unfixable why do you feel like\nthings are hopeless and now we get to it\nright this is the reason because someone\nnot just one person but this is a lesson\nthat was taught to you by one person\nthat you love and then another person\nthat you love and that another person\nthat you love oh god yeah right so they\njust rammed that into you like over and\nover again that you just [ __ ] that\nthat there is hurt in this world that\nnothing can fix and so that became truth\nthat became truth that became what it is\nand then the world is now a place where\nyou are hurting people and then there's\nno way to fix that you are uncurable\nit's unfixable you just are gonna let\npeople down they're gonna invest in you\nand they're gonna get corrupted like\ncorruption gangrene what happening oh\nsorry go on\nin order for that to change you've got\nto start with this right you've got to\ngo to the root where did you how did you\nlearn and I mean I think it's beyond the\nscope of what we can accomplish today\nby oh yeah but I think this is where it\ncomes down to right because if you can\nheal what they did to you then your\nentire worldview comes tumbling down\nthen everything that you view about the\nworld is like can be rewritten\nbut the okay so you're you're everything\nyou're saying is I'm gonna assume\naccurate because [ __ ] but even if I\nbelieve that things could be fixable I\nreally I don't you don't believe you\ndon't believe that that are fixable fine\nright I mean so let's just call that so\nI'm gonna tell you what you actually\nthink which is that like in theory in\ntheory in theory dr. K I agree with you\nbut there's just no [ __ ] way you\ndon't know what they did to me it's not\nactually fixable yeah like yeah like it\nsounds but at the end of the day it's\njust it's just not actually gonna happen\nyeah I I feel like now it's kind of like\nwell just gotta try to figure out a way\nto win you know while having this kind\nof like baggage and I felt like it's\npossible because it worked for a bit but\nno I mean yes so that's the problem\nright because I think if you want to win\nyou gotta like offload that baggage\nright you gotta learn that you can be\nhealed and if you can be healed then you\ndon't have to be a corrupting influence\nfor others\noh I'm willing to talk about it how much\ntime do we have\nI have a patient in about 10 minutes I\nI'm happy to talk about it too it's just\nin my experience sky I'm good at what I\ndo but this is the kind of thing that\nrequires more than 10 minutes or even\nmore than one session because it sounds\nlike you've had repeated insults and\nit's not that I'm not willing to try or\nnot wanting to talk about it I just want\nto set realistic expectations for like\nwhat's gonna be accomplished okay does\nthat make sense yeah\nlike the only only thing that sucks is\nthat I mean and of course this is diet\nit's like you have blown open my\nworldview and now it's like it's like oh\nwell another patient got to go for it\nwhich is fine get your own work to do\nbut now it's like I'm just gonna be\nstaring out of my overcast window like\ngoddamn much got bodied and I don't\nnever leave know what's fair enough fair\nenough\nso so so let me try to let me try to\nlet's not end here I'm not saying we\nshould end hmm\nand and I get the sense you need to move\nforward because like you said like I've\nopened things up and I can't just leave\nyou I know you I know you can but I hear\nwhat you're saying so so let's let's get\nstarted right let's talk about I feel\nlike a whiny brat baby we got his way\nlike no you're you're I don't think\nyou're a whiny brat that that that got\nyour way I think you raised a very\nlegitimate concern which is that we\nwe're like halfway done and so we should\nfinish I've just never heard those words\nout of someone's mouth like I cannot\nbelieve you asked that god it's actually\nlike nuts to me like\nyou're really good that's yeah don't\ndon't mind my rambling I mind your your\nrambling is Goldman and we're blurry oh\nyeah yeah so tell me about your mother\nso he's the s+ right so let's dive in\nyou want to go let's go yep tell me\nabout your mother\nthe worst human being alive one of them\num Nick\nwell not he wasn't always that way Nick\nand I are like both extremely extremely\nmanipulative and we're very good at it\nmy brother is the more attractive one\nand I'm funnier than him so like when we\nwere kids we just got we really ran my\naunts pockets like they was Aaron's like\nwe didn't care like we're trying to get\nlike a game we didn't steal from them\nbut of course like we'd just be like oh\nman we would have a lot more brother\nbonding time if we had that new Pokemon\nLeague we're awful and we played a lot\nof Wilder yes he's a 15 months older\nokay\n[Music]\nhad to memorize the English words he's\nwe're 15 months apart so that's why I\nnow say it\nwe I know Nick just sucks I can dive\ninto what he did is that okay\nthis is the trigger warning part yeah\nokay reiteration of the trigger warning\neveryone okay so when I was 15 a dude\ncame in our house and I got raped and\n[Music]\nit was very odd because I knew that I\nwas gay I was talking to this person on\nAOL I knew that I was gay um he said\nthat he was like 17 he was actually like\n40 he talks to my house and went and I\nshould have like thought about it more\nwhen he asked if it was like a 2-story\nhome like he it was like this thing like\nlike trying to bait me to say like where\nI live in the house but of course it was\nthe downstairs houses are the only room\ndownstairs\nso when it was happening it was like my\nmind was basically thinking okay well\nI'm gay so I'm gonna have to like it\nit was the most painful thing I've ever\non our life we know is even more [ __ ]\nup though is that your body my body made\nfor like two seconds I enjoyed it for\ntwo solid seconds my body put me in a\nplace to where this is what I wanted\nthat will live with me I [ __ ] hate\nthinking about that but what was worse\nwasn't when my brother came home when it\nwas done my logic was if I just don't\nsay or do anything and I make no noise\nthen he will leave and I will be able to\njust keep this right so he's getting up\nto leave and my brother comes home he\ngoes back to my room and he tries to\nopen the door he sees that I'm naked and\nhe sees those another he sends another\nperson in there I closed the door and I\nlock it I try to distract him\nthe dude leave my brother goes I've been\ntelling my mom mom calls the cops my\nbrother tells the cops that I invited\nsomeone over to get [ __ ] and that's\nwhat happened and it's my fault the cop\npulls me aside asked me if I want to go\nto a foster home my mom didn't know who\nto believe\noh yeah Deanna the next day I go and get\nblood test blood work my mom took the\nday off work obviously who went to go do\nmuch tests okay\n[Music]\nthen the neck but I think it was maybe a\nday after maybe two days after I went to\nschool cuz after the weekend and I go to\nschool and every single person at our\nhigh school knows what happened oh but\nthey don't know the actual story they\nthink that I wanted it and that that\nthat was like like I was just a [ __ ] who\njust you know went out and did all\nwhatever which isn't unorthodox to think\nbecause I have in like I have in the\npast out of curiosity looked at gay porn\nit had been on Craigslist to try to look\nfor something like sure try to look for\nsomeone but at the time I had no luck\nobviously because I'm an infant but but\nNick like he knew that it wasn't he knew\nthat it wasn't\nnew but he didn't he wanted a scoop so\nhe\neveryone in my school\nI find out when I enter my class and\npeople are just like giggling like I'm\nnot even kidding like it was a [ __ ]\nmovie um I didn't think much of it I\njust had to get through the day after I\nwas done I cannot believe this\nI go to gamestop I go in to buy a game\nand our mutual friend Alex Scott is\nworking and he's like oh I heard you had\na special friend last night I literally\ndropped my food and my backpack and\neverything cuz when he said that the\nmanager even looked over like they\nthought it was funny and I took my mom's\nI was like driving my mom's expedition\nat the time cuz I you know I could drive\nbut my mom of course should not be in\nany legal trouble even though she let me\ndrive alone just go ahead and just put\nthat out there but yeah I know then I\nfreaked out don't you cut now serve a\nchange can you guys can you guys still\nhear me no hello hey yo God intervened\nthe power went out now I'm on my phone\nit's okay though okay oh my god Oh Nik\nis listening what a demon let me turn on\nmy camera I got it oddly coincidental\nyou see me yep okay okay yep go okay\nyeah so I drove home as fast as I could\nbut honestly I was running red lights I\nwas I didn't care I called my mom my mom\nleft work she was hysterical I drove I\ndid not stop for anyone I was really\nhoping to hit something but I didn't\nand I mean I just went home and locked\nmyself in my room and that was that I\ndon't know if my brother got punished\nfor it but I know that whatever happened\nwasn't enough because in 2000 and now\nthis is so [ __ ] in 2016 um my brother\nI guess is having a wedding and he knows\nwe're not on good terms he goes on my\nsubreddit and he makes a thing that says\nOh will you go to my wedding now all of\nmy fans think that I'm okay with my\nbrother so they're thinking it's a sweet\ngesture but Nick knows that I'm not on\ngood terms with it but he's just I find\nout that he's working at Chili's and\nhe's like using like oh you look like\nSkye and he's like getting some of my\nfans his friends on Facebook and then\nwhen I didn't answer his wedding\nproposal he put my text messages that I\nsent to him during like during like\naround the time where I got away like\nall of my message all my business out on\nhis personal Facebook okay and then he\nhas the audacity to begin posting [ __ ]\non my reddit which I had to take down\nthis [ __ ] is really out here ridiculing\nme for getting raped and then that's\nwhere a lot of things went downhill in\nmy life for sure my mom you know yeah go\non do it\nso Skyy so let me ask you something um\nis I mean have you talked here like so\nyou say that you and your brother aren't\non good terms is there a particular way\nthat when you guys like when y'all\naren't on good terms\nlook what does what does that like have\nyou talked to him about what happened\nand how you feel yep\nand they don't care he get it he really\ndoesn't care at all I'm just running off\nmy fan okay\nhe does not care at all and and I he\nhasn't apologized he doesn't he\ndefinitely doesn't seem he I mean he's\nagain he's never changed his stance he's\nblaming me for it I'm the one that got a\nrape it was me it was actually not rape\nbecause it was consensual so it's like\nhe hasn't even left that at all and he\nwould like try to get a hold of me by he\ntook my one of my videos and had my dad\nand mom like mime it one second Scott\n[Music]\nthis it really is in my head he's I'm\nthe fan okay so sky I think that uh I I\nthink that the challenge here is that so\nI I mean I think that this has this has\nto be and you you sort of have made your\npeace with the situation to the extent\nthat you can right yeah I mean it we\njust went out just cut out hello oh I\ncan't hear you\nhello friend yep there we go you hear me\nyeah so I I mean this guy I think\nunfortunately I can't know I mean I\nthink it's just gonna be challenging\nbecause I think this is just I mean I\nrecognize what you're going through and\nI feel confident that you can get better\nand I think this is where it starts but\nlike there's just no way that you know\nthe first thing that I can offer you is\nthat I do think you can get better and\nif you've never seen your life in this\nway let you have these patterns that\nthose patterns come from a place right\nand they come from something terrible\nthat happened to you and if you can\nunderstand where a pattern comes from\nyou can gain\ncontrol over it okay and and so this is\nsomething that that's very important to\nunderstand so the Yogi's in ancient\nIndia said that awareness precedes\ncontrol and that like when I work with\npeople who have addictions or trauma or\nthings like that like there was a you\nknow kind of a I guess a you know far\nless severe stream than what we're\ntalking about but it was someone on a\ncouple of weeks ago or a couple months\nago who's talking about why they date\nthe same kind of women like over and\nover and over again and they don't\nunderstand like why they keep on getting\nand women getting with women that they\nultimately get bored of and then like\nthey want to break up with and so unless\nyou understand like what's going on\ninside you like you have no ability to\ncontrol it right so this is what I what\nI can offer you now which is gonna be\nunsatisfying for which I apologize the\nfirst is to understand that you are the\nway that you are because you learned\nsome very important and crucial lessons\nin life and as long as you're operating\nunder the assumption that those lessons\nare true that you're going to those\nlessons are gonna kind of like default\nyour plays are gonna set your default\nmode network your default programming\nwhen I go to the toilet and I like pull\nthe handle down it flushes like that's\njust an assumption\nso you're operating in life with certain\nkey assumptions that you can hurt people\nand disappoint people in a way that's\nnever\nrepairable and in at the beginning what\nI would say is just notice when that\nthought or that feeling arises and\ninfluences your behavior\nbecause I think it happens not when you\naccept someone's help but the next day\nwhen your desire or your genuine\nintention to pay them back or do right\nby them or something like that when that\nwhen that starts to fade I think\nsomething of this feeling is going to\narise right there and is going to\nactually become a self-fulfilling\nprophecy and something about that\nfeeling in that hopelessness causes you\nto abandon your promise\nand the cool thing is if you can notice\nthat thing in that moment and say oh\nthis is the part of me like this is like\nthis is everything that happened when I\nwas 15\nrearing its ugly head and telling me\nthat it doesn't [ __ ] matter and then\nyou can in that moment if you see it\nright this is like so you play League of\nLegends yeah yeah so there's like\nthere's like stealth units and League of\nLegends right\nyeah oh yeah yeah so so like like you\nneed like some kind of like vision like\nyou need some like detection to be able\nto see the stealth thing otherwise you\ncan't do anything about it and so you've\nbeen living your whole life without\ndetection and there's been something\nthat's just just running around in your\nsubconscious just [ __ ] everything up\nyeah and so it starts with detection you\ngot to detect it first whether you can\ntackle it whether you can kill it\nwhether you can stun it whatever that\ncomes later but the first thing is\ndetection\num if if I promise to be brief yeah I\nonly have one more thing to say you\nshould say it okay I just I this is this\nis gonna be something that I know that\nlike it's not like trigger warning or\nanything it is something that many\npeople are wondering about but there is\nsomething that I want to share with you\nbecause I think that I think ever since\nyou were talking about the\ndisappointment thing this is the first\nthing that was in my mind I said it\nsooner basically um Allah while ago I\nwasn't very good friends with a content\ncreator of dunkey we had a falling out\nwith me and Leah had a falling out it's\nterrible\nthat's by the way the example of someone\nthat I said someone that I lost that\npretty much was the worst thing like I\nwould do anything for your friend again\nand I don't think it's repairable so\nthat's like Oh like that that\nencompasses it but what I wanted to\ntouch on is I never knew that being\nfriends with someone that's so much more\npopular than you I can't tell you how\nmany times I would get offers from\ncompanies and jobs that you know would\ngive me deals that I believe would be\namazing but then they would end by\nsaying Oh would you mind like passing on\nthis to dunkey see if he wants to do it\nand either I I mean obviously I'm not\ngonna [ __ ] do that he has an email\nand yeah I don't want to I don't want\nthat I don't want that relationship but\nof course if he says no or even if I\nsend it and there's no response or I\ndon't you know whatever it is nine times\nout of ten the deal stops that's fine\nenough to happen so so I mean that\nthat's fine in the sense that so I'm\nglad you shared that sky and I think\nthere's actually like another way\nforward right so the main thing here for\nyou to change the way that you view the\nworld is to to dismantle this belief\nthat things are irreparable so whether\nit's with your family or it's with\ndunkey okay for you to like process that\nand repair doesn't necessarily mean make\neverything like like like like not like\nthat you guys have to be BFFs again or\nthat you and your brother are gonna like\nretire together and like live in the\nsame house like that's not what repair\nmeans right repair means that\nlike you're gonna engage with them\nprocess grieve and then let go okay that\nif you did donkey wrong or something bad\nhappened between the two of you guys\nthat that yeah yes so like that's so\nthat's that that's the thing is like\nlike that\nthat needs to be addressed right not\nmoved past not laughed past not kind of\nlike you know like even from an\negotistical sense because this is a\ndistraction to because when you compare\nyourself to other people and you're like\noh they're better than I am or I'm worse\nthat's a pattern that your mind uses in\nthe same way that it uses laughter to\nget away from the real
