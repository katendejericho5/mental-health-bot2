may this person be\nfree and may this person be at peace\n[Music]\nm\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\nso what we want to do is cultivate the\ncompa\ncultivate a\ncapacity for\nkindness\nSo Close Your\nEyes take a few moments to breathe in\nand breathe out\n[Music]\n[Music]\nh\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nw\n[Music]\nbut I would say on a on a deeper level\nit's more like when when we say work on\nyourself that involves all kinds of like\nthings about moving your life forward\nand they struggle with motivation in\nthese things\nit's because when I don't think I'm\nworth\nit I'm not worth fixing\n[Music]\n[Music]\nI\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\nwhen you develop empathy and compassion\nfor other\npeople there's going to be room for\nsomeone else in the\nrelationship and then this in turn is\ngoing to reduce the feeling of being an\nobject now two people can\nconnect and now it's not about getting\nyour needs met in Starvation\nit's about two human beings forming a\nrelationship\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\nalrighty chat let's get started sorry\nfor being a little bit late\ntoday um we are doing a deep dive into\ncptsd\nand uh I found some really interesting\nresearch over the last 24 hours that\ntook me a little bit of time to\nincorporate um so it took a little bit\nlonger and I was just prepping\neverything so that once we get started I\nwon't be stumbling around trying to find\nstuff so\ntoday we\nare speaking of stumbling\naround today we are stumbling around no\num so today we are going to be doing a\ndeep dive into\ncptsd um just to remind that although\nI'm a psychiatrist nothing we discussed\non stream today is intended to be taken\nas medical advice everything is for\neducational and entertainment purposes\nonly um if yall have a concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional this is especially\nimportant as we're talking about today\nbecause oh my God quiet you um this is\nvery important today because today we\nare going to be talking about clinical\nstuff right so this is not a substitute\nfor clinical treatment the goal of what\nwe try to do here on stream is to\neducate people\nand if yall resonate with some of the\nstuff that we're talking about I highly\nrecommend that you go see a clinical\nprofessional um we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about evidence-based\ntreatment for cptsd at the end of the\nDeep\ndive and yeah\nso uh today we're doing a deep dive into\ncptsd and then the other thing that\nwe're going to do today actually just as\nan\nFYI so we're going to start with this so\nI know that often times people will want\nus to do things at HG so I want to show\nyouall\nsomething\nso uh\noh hold\non\nfail there works okay so you'll notice\nthat someone made a post about a year\nago when is Dr K going to make a\ncomprehensive or even short video on\ncptsd or does he have one that I already\nmissed so and then can Dr K make a video\non cptsd these are both from one year\nago these are just the two posts that we\nfound that were about a year old but\npeople have been asking this for a while\nso the first thing that I want to say is\nthat when y'all ask for stuff like this\nwe pay attention it just takes a while\nto do right so like between someone\nposting this and actually like building\nit um sometimes we have faster\nturnaround times but many times like it\ntakes a while so we're paying attention\nto everyone's requests I saw a post a\ncouple days ago that I responded to uh\nfrom someone sort of saying like hey HG\nfeels like a boy club is it and yeah we\nget that it feels that way sometimes but\nwe have a lot of great content coming\nout for women there's certain challenges\nto that so I know sometimes like on the\ninternet we're getting used to instant\ngratification in some kind of response\nbut we do pay attention to the stuff and\nwe add this stuff to the list which is\nvery large and then we get around to it\nwhen we can so since this thing got\nposted in addition to this deep dive\nwhich we're going to do today we also\nbuilt a whole trauma module so this uh\nis about it basically takes about as\nlong to build a module as it does to\nwrite a book um the scripting for the\nmodule is about 50 to 80,000 words a\nnon-fiction book so the book that I\nwrote is somewhere around 80,000\nwords so like we built a a guide um I'll\nshow you all just real quick so like the\nother cool thing is that guides are\ngetting more complicated so like the\ncool thing about a guide is that we can\nadd a lot of other stuff right so we're\ntrying to build like graphics and stuff\nlike that um that help emphasize like\nthe understanding of the principles that\nplay right so we teach a lot of science\nand sometimes a picture is worth a\nthousand words and thankfully we have a\nwhole team here at HG that helps us make\npictures um so this these are the trauma\nguide Graphics that we're building uh so\nI know this sounds like really this\nseems like kind of overwhelming but I\nguarantee you that when I talk about the\nneuroscience and explain the\nNeuroscience like this is going to help\npeople actually understand right so we\nteach a lot of in-depth Neuroscience in\nthe guide um\nso this these are this is the temporo\nparietal Junction so we're going to talk\nabout this like just so you all know\nsomething cool if you electrically\nstimulate the temporo parial junction\nyou can trigger an out-of- Body\nExperience super\ncool um don't go trying that at home\nkids so uh you know just as we're we're\nteaching some of these like so here's\nthe challenge is like Neuroscience can\nhelp us a lot right so in the same way\nthat we can understand things like how\nmuscles build and like taking creatine\nand and exercising and we want to do\nsome number of reps like there's a bunch\nof exercise physiology which has been\ndemystified and made available to human\nbeings the challenge is that we have a\nton of Neuroscience that has not been\ndemystified and made available instead\nwhat we try to do is like translate\nthings into layman's terms and then try\nto make it somewhat accessible through\nlike Publications like hbr and stuff\nlike that right where we'll have some\npop Neuroscience where they'll say like\nhey this one trick will transform your\nlife like we do that stuff too so\nespecially in the guide we try to really\nlike teach all this stuff because I\nthink that when I when I work with my\npatients I actually teach them all of\nthese things or not I mean not\neverything but as much as I can about\nhow their physiology works because\nthat'll help you a lot especially with\ntrauma um so there's a bunch of\ndifferent stuff that we've got going on\nyou know we're building things for y'all\nuh and super excited about it the guide\nI think comes out soon and so what we're\ngoing to do today is actually watch one\nvideo of the guide after the Deep dive\nso we're going to do a deep dive into\ncptsd then we're going to show you all a\nvideo from the guide just to illustrate\nsomething because it's explained in\nthere and I think it's a it's a cool\nvideo um and then we're going to get to\nQ&A okay let's see if anyone has\nquestions before we begin I'm going to\njust check in with chat\num okay will will you ever talk yeah\nwe've talked about schizophrenia before\num but we'll we'll talk about it again\nfor\nsure uh I had a we're actually working\non something where we may\num\nget into schizophrenia soon\nactually\nokay um yeah so as as mods are telling\ny'all the guide video that we're going\nto showing be showing y'all today is not\nthe Final Cut um it's still in like post\nso we're just going to be sharing it\nwith y'all today this will be by the way\nthis stream is going to be available\nokay so it you know like I think it just\nstays on our our various channels um\nokay okay so we're all\ntraumatized so that's a great way to\nstart so today we're going to be talking\nabout complex PTS D and the reason that\nI think this is really important to talk\nabout is because it's my belief that\nfeatures of PTSD are present in large\npercentages of the population without\nbeing a full-blown diagnosis now let me\nexplain what the hell that\nmeans so if we look at the\nepidemiology the rates the the\nprevalence of PTSD is about 1.5% so 1.5%\nof human beings on the planet have\npost-traumatic stress disorder\nabout half a percent or about a third of\nthose people have something called\ncomplex PTSD and we'll get to what that\nis so the interesting thing is if you\nlook at what separates PTSD and\ncptsd if you remove the PTSD component\nwhat is left over I think is actually\nquite common in our society today that's\nwhy despite the fact that only one out\nof 20000 people has a diagnosis of cptsd\nit is my firm belief that understanding\nthat component will be very helpful to a\nlot of the people in our community and\nin the world so for me for example when\nI work with people who have other\ndiagnoses like major depressive disorder\nor addictions especially what I found is\nthat the more that I learned about cptsd\nthe more effective of a clinician I\nbecame at treating these people so\nthat's why we're kind of diving it into\nit today and as I think a a large\nportion of our community and people\ntoday resonate with some of the features\nof P\ncptsd so let's start with a little bit\nof History so the first thing is like\nwhat are these diagnoses and where do\nthey come from so a couple maybe about\n80 years\nago soldiers came back from War and what\ndoctors noticed was that these soldiers\nlike weren't all there so they seem to\nhave like this brain fog they have\ndifficulty concentrating they're like\nhaving like emotional problems they\ndrink more they can't incorporate back\ninto society so the first round of\ndoctors said oh this is something called\nshell shock and so what they thought\nhappened is that even though this person\ndoesn't have an actual physical injury\nthe concussive blast of an explosion\nmust have hit their brain in some way\nand caused\ndamage so okay the original form of PTSD\nwas born and we called it shell shocked\nit's because a bomb went off off like\nvery close close to you you didn't\nactually get hurt and then but there was\nsome kind of vibration or concussive\nblast that affected your brain that's\nthe injury it's not like shrapnel or\nanything like that so no bleeding but an\ninternal injury so then what happened is\nas we started to like work with veterans\nmore and more and more we started to\nrealize that this is happening to a lot\nof people that like weren't in the\nconcussive blast zone so they like saw\none of their friends die or something\nlike that they were only on the field of\nbattle for like a day and they just like\nretreated but still they saw someone die\nand then these people had the symptoms\nof shell shock so shell shock started\nwith like concussive blast and then we\nnoticed that people have these symptoms\nbut haven't experienced concussive\nblasts this is where PTSD was born so\nPTSD is\nusually an adaptation or a maladaptation\nof the body to an acute specific\ntraumatic event in in its original form\nPTSD was primarily found in soldiers so\nseeing a friend die or something like\nthat results in\nPTSD then what happened is once we had\nthis construct once we had these like\ndiagnostic criteria and stuff clinicians\nmade a really interesting observation we\nsee this kind of PTSD or shell shock\nwhatever phenomenon in people who have\nnever been in combat and they're like\nwhat on Earth they have all the same\nsymptoms but they've never been in\ncombat then we expanded PTSD to being\nnon combat related things things like\nsexual trauma or physical abuse or even\nthings like bullying and stuff like that\nso the the the web of PT or the scope of\npts group PTSD group we'll talk about\nwhat it is in a\nsecond then what happened is a group of\nresearchers noticed that some people\nwith\nPTSD have more a different flavor to it\nand have different kinds of symptoms and\nthey noticed something really important\nthat if the trauma is chronic if it is\nconsistent over time that results in a\ndifferent clinical picture and this is\nwhere complex PTSD was born so if we\nlook at regular PTSD here's the way that\nI understand it okay so first of all it\nhas three core features so one is\nreexperiencing the second is avoidance\nand the third is I'm blanking I can't\nbelieve I'm blanking on this\num so there's lots of diagnostic\ncriteria but they get lumped into three\nthings reexperiencing avoidance\nhypervigilance maybe hold on I will\nfigure this out give me a second\nchat the joys of AATA\nmemory okay oh hyper yeah so hyper hyper\nvigilance hyperarousal is the word that\nthey use okay so basically PTSD has\nthree core clusters of of symptoms\nhypervigilance or hyperarousal um\nreexperiencing in avoidance so let's\nunderstand what PTSD is so we start off\noff with a human being who is relatively\nwell formed and\nhealthy and then some kind of traumatic\nevent happens to them and then their\nphysiology their brain their being\nadapts to try to survive that thing the\nproblem is the way that we adapt to\nsurvive that one instance creates\nmaladaptations or problems going forward\nso let's use a very simple\nexample so let's say that I end up in a\ncar crash right so I'm a relatively\nhealthy person I'm in my mid 20s and I\nget into a car accident so once I get\ninto a car accident there is a\nhyperactivation of my nervous system my\nautonomic nervous system so I have\nadrenaline pumping through my body I\nhave cortisol getting flushed into my\nbody and then my brain is being\nhyperactive I'm hyperventilating I get\ntaken to the hospital and then I end up\nI end up being okay now the problem is\nthat our\nbrain has evolved to adapt so a human\nbeing can adapt to circumstances and\nwhat the brain does is says hey we\nalmost died there let's be extra extra\nextra careful and make sure that never\nhappens again so this is where what we\nsee in PTSD is first of all people will\nhave then other things happen we'll get\ninto this in more detail but other\nthings happen that will kind of numb out\nour brain and so then what happens is\nall of these experiences get dissociated\nthey live dorm they're dormant in our\nsubconscious and then they will arise\nagain so people will have flashbacks\nthey will have nightmares this is these\nare both diagnostic features but this is\nwhat we call reexperiencing even though\nthe event is over people a part of their\nmind gets stuck in that moment and that\npart the part of that part of their mind\nwill arise and fall over time so the\nsecond thing that happens is people have\navoidance right so now our brain our\nbrain remember our bra brain is designed\nto help us and Keep Us Alive so for\nexample if I almost drown in a lake I\nwill anytime I see a body of water I\nwill get scared and my brain will tell\nme Don't Go Near The Water Don't Go Near\nThe Water Don't Go Near The Water right\nand you'll understand this if you've\nplayed video games especially\nmultiplayer video games where you play a\nvideo game once and then you have a\nreally bad game because your teammates\nare feeding and then your brain is like\nnever again never again never again and\nthe thought of playing the game makes\nyou hyperventilate in in nauseous which\nis why most people play multiplayer\ngames for about 5 to 10 hours over the\ncourse of their lifetime because they\nget so traumatized that they never come\nback right same thing you all should be\nfamiliar with that\nphenomenon so it'd be interesting I\nwonder if we could\nexplore the mechanism through which\npeople keep going back to video games\nthat are consistently traumatic as a way\nto desensitize people with PTSD and\nactually get them to re-engage in life\nthat's really interesting I never\nthought about that for but I actually\nwonder why we don't why are video games\nso traumatic but we keep going back\nthat's really\ninteresting anyway conversation for a\ndifferent day so in PTSD you have a solo\nevent you have reexperiencing of it you\nhave avoidance of whatever it is so\npeople will avoid getting into a car\nagain and the third thing that you have\nis\nhyperarousal so what happens in our\nbrain in our in our phys physiology is\nthat we wire differently so I don't know\nif this kind of makes sense but like you\nknow if I get attacked by something my\nbrain will be more sensitive to\ndetecting it in the\nfuture and I will be more\num I will be like my response to that\nstimulus will be a lot more robust so\nlet's say I get attacked by a dog on the\nstreet the next time I see a dog first\nof all my brain will be able to pick out\ndogs out of a field of people if I'm\nwalking down the street and there's like\na 100 people in the park across the\nstreet my brain will notice if there's a\nsingle dog and it'll raise that to my\nawareness and then the moment that I see\na dog my my physiology will activate it\nwill go back to like being attacked so\nI'll see a rush of adrenaline and\ncortisol so these are the features of\nPTSD basically I I'm a normal person I\nhave a traumatic event and then these\nthree things\nactivate now then what happened is\npeople noticed that like okay so this is\na fundamentally different picture from\nwhen we have complex PTSD which is\nconsistent trauma over\ntime so what happens when you have let's\nsay a teenager living at home who has an\nemotionally and physically abusive\nparent so this is the kind of thing\nwhere\nlike you know it's not a single event\nthis is the kind of thing where it's not\nlike uh you know our our body and and\nbrain are are just adapting over the\ncourse of one day this is a chronic form\nof abuse or trauma that results in a far\nlarger scale change to our sense of self\neven so what we\nsee is um in in complex PTSD we have a\ncluster of three symptoms which are\nreferred to as a disorganized self okay\nso this involves first of all emotional\ndisre ation a loss of your sense of\nidentity and a difficulty with\nrelationships now you can see features\nof these things in regular\nPTSD let's actually start\ndrawing so now we we'll talk about itery\ndisturbances in\nself-organization okay so let's take a\nlook\nchat all right so here is a\nperson okay and if they have one\ntraumatic event but they are relatively\nwell\nformed so what this means is they have\nrelatively normal life this results or\ncan result in PTS SD and this has\nreexperiencing\num avoid\noh\navoidance and hyperarousal and we'll\nwe'll get into all these okay now let's\nsay that the C trauma is\nchronic so then what happens is that\nthis person is not usually well formed\nso it changes their sense of\nself and this is what we call\ndisturbances in self\norganization so if you kind of look at\nthis this so those the way I understand\nit if you have PTSD PTSD is happening to\nyou this is an adaptation but you are\nsort of separate from the traumatic\nevent when the trauma is is more\nconstant and when it happens earlier so\nwe'll get to this in a second in a\nlittle bit more detail it changes who\nyou are it changes so it's not something\nthat happens to you the trauma becomes a\npart of you so this is what disturbances\nand self-organization mean so what this\nmeans is that there's emotional\ndisregulation there\nis uh disturbances in a the sense of\nidentity and there are difficulties in\nrelationships okay so let's take a quick\nlook at uh something else so I\nthink\nthis so predictors of complex PTSD the\nrole of trauma characteristics dissoc\ndissociation and comorbid\npsychopathology so findings largely\nconfirm earlier research suggesting\nthat cptsd is a associated with\ntraumatic events that start earlier in\nlife and are perpetrated by\nacquaintances okay so if we look at\ncptsd how is this different what this\nmeans is that remember we're well formed\nin PTSD so we have like you know like a\nrandom like if I get mugged by a random\nperson I can get PTSD but I have no\nrelationship with that person what leads\nto\ncptsd is first of all it happens earlier\nso our sense of self is not well-crafted\nand furthermore it often times relates\nto having someone that is close to us in\nlife so our sense of self really gets\nmessed up when our parents are abusive\nand that results in this symptom cluster\nokay now let's take a second to look at\nthe original paper on cptsd and by the\nway if you guys want to read about\ntrauma the two references I would\nrecommend is this one so uh Judith\nHerman um was the one who coined the\nterm and this is an an excellent paper\nexcellent excellent excellent paper\nOkay so uh we're going to just talk\nabout we're just quickly look at this\nthe current diagnostic formulation of\nPTSD derives primarily from observations\nof survivors of relatively circumscribed\ntraumatic events right so she's saying\nbasically PTSD is talking about it\nrelates to people have single events or\nlike you know circumscribed so they're\nthey're you can draw a circle around\nthis formulation fails to capture the\nprotein seil of prolonged repeated\ntrauma so now Dr Herman is saying this\nis a different thing if the trauma\nhappens all the time in contrast to a\nsingle traumatic event prolonged\nrepeated trauma can occur only where the\nvictim is in a state of captivity under\nthe control of the perpetrator the\npsychological impact of subordination to\ncoercive control has many common\nfeatures uh whether it occurs within the\npublic sphere of politics or within the\nprivate sphere of sexual and domestic\nrelations so what what Dr Herman\nbasically\nnoticed is that we have a group of\npeople who are put in situations where\nthey no longer have control over their\nlife and this has a different kind of of\neffect on the psyche right so like if I\nget into a car accident that doesn't\nfundamentally change like what I'm\ncapable of doing tomorrow so Dr Herman\nwas looking a lot at at people like uh\nprisoners of War where these people had\nwas not this isn't just a single you\nknow military conflict on a single day\nthis is someone who day after day is\nabused abused abused abused abused and\nit changes the way that they function So\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthat since then things have evolved a\nlot by the way the other reference on\ntrauma that I would highly recommend\nwe're just going to flash to real quick\num is this so the body keeps the score\nis a great book on trauma but I think\nyou all can get a lot of this summarized\nin bestl Vander KK's awesome paper from\ndialogues and clinical Neuroscience so\nthis talks a lot about\nstuff this talks a lot about stuff Dr K\n2024 okay so now what we're going to do\nis dig into what happens in trauma so\nwhen we built this trauma guide what we\nbasically have so we did a trauma work\nWorkshop a couple months ago maybe about\na year ago now and the trauma Workshop\nwas like incredibly successful so like\nbasically there were 200 spots it sold\nout in 24 hours and then we increased it\nto 250 spots and so a lot of people were\nsuper confused like hey like are you\ngoing to do this again why aren't you\ndoing again we realized that the demand\nwas so high and there's no way that we\ncan get to everyone that we actually\ndecided to just build a guide instead\nsaid so we took the trauma Workshop\nwhich was about 8 or 9 hours and we\nexpanded it to like 15 16 hours of stuff\nI think maybe that's last I don't know\nwhat the actual video size is but we\nbuilt this guide and the guide also has\nmeditations and exercises and stuff like\nthat so today what we're going to go\nthrough is some of the core features\nthat we explained in the guide obviously\nthere're in more detail there and we're\ngoing to focus on the features of\ncomplex PTSD so let's try to understand\nwhat happens in\ntrauma okay\nnow so we're going to start with the\nbody so the first thing that happens\nwhen we get traumatized is we get\nhyperarousal okay so our nervous system\nchanges our nervous system changes to be\njittery so what does this mean this\nmeans I'm walking along and I see a oh\nGod I can't draw a\ndog okay I see a dog and normally like\nwhen I see a dog I don't have a robust\nphysiologic response but once I have\nPTSD what starts to happen is even\nbenign stimuli will trigger a very\nstrong sympathetic nervous system\nresponse so we have this part of our\nnervous system called the autonomic\nnervous system or ANS and the autonomic\nnervous system is divided into the\nsympathetic nervous system and the\nparasympathetic nervous system\nokay so the sympathetic nervous system\ngoverns fight or\nflight the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem governs rest and digest and the\nsimplest way to understand that is when\nI was in college I used to talk to my\nfriends we used to have this phrase\ncalled being\nowned and it's like I just ate this\ngigantic sandwich I am now owned I can't\ndo anything I am gg gg and there are\nother times before you eat a gigantic\nsandwich where you feel active you feel\nenergetic you feel you know you feel\nlike optimistic about the future\nwhatever so our body has periods of\nactivity and then it has periods of rest\nand digest so I I don't know if you guys\nlike H you know after you have a meal\nwhat happens is our parasympathetic\nnervous system\nactivates so when the parasympathetic\nnervous system activates and it's\ntriggered by things like food in your\nstomach and then our body sends so our\nstomach sends signals to our brain\nthat's like hey we've got a bunch of\nfood coming in\nwe we need to divert blood flow from our\nskeletal muscles like our arms and our\nlegs and our brain to our digestive\nsystem our liver needs blood our GI\nsystem needs blood our stomach needs\nblood intestines need blood um you know\nour gallbladder needs blood this is\nwhere we need all of our blood flow so\nwe'll feel sleepy we'll feel like\nsitting around we'll digest things and\nthen there are other times where like\nwhen I'm walking down the street and I\nget attacked by a you know like a a\nThief so if someone's trying to mug me\nthen my Paras my sympathetic nervous\nsystem will activate I'll get a surge of\nadrenaline and cortisol and then I will\nfight or I will run away now if we look\nat diseases like anxiety disorders or\npanic attacks what we see is that in\nthese disorders we have a\nhyperactivation of the sympathetic\nnervous system in our society\ntoday we have a very high stress State\nand the reason for that\nis that generally speaking the\nsympathetic nervous system was something\nthat was supposed to turn on and off\nright so this evolved in like deer so if\nyou think about a deer like a deer\ndoesn't worry about paying mortgage at\nthe end of the month they don't worry\nabout GPA they don't worry about being\nalone for the rest of their life the\ndeer has like is basically chilling and\nthen responds to its environment if it\nsees like a wolf it runs away and then\nit kind of Cs down so in most animals if\nwe look at a 30-day period they may have\nan activation of sympathetic nervous\nsystem system here or here oh I see a\ndeer that I'm sexually attracted to so I\nget a spike of it what happens in human\nbeings is we get prolonged activation\nbecause if I have a test in two weeks I\ndon't stress about that in two weeks I\nstart stressing today and I stay\nstressed so hyperarousal is basically\nthe same thing it is a a elevated\ntriggering of our sympathetic nervous\nsystem so it's not chronic it just means\nthat so here here's the way that I would\nput it so here's a normal human being\nand let's say that I need a danger\nsignal that is this high so if my danger\nsignal hits this\npoint actually let's do this way so\nlet's say here's our stress\nresponse I'm going to redo this chat\nbecause this is done wrongly and here's\nour danger so let's say danger level one\ndanger level 10 danger level 10 is like\nthere's a tornado flying towards me\nlevel one\nis I don't know there's like\na someone rings the doorbell let's say\nso normally what happens is we need like\na danger level of seven so as we go over\nhere as we get a danger level of seven\nthen we see an increase in the stress\nresponse so this is like for a normal\nhuman being when you have PTSD what we\ntend to find is that a danger level of\nfour is sufficient to trigger a stress\nresponse so our threshold to trigger the\nsympathetic nervous system goes way down\nit is easy for us to get\ntriggered right and we use this term so\nmuch in in common language nowadays like\nthis triggers me this triggers me this\ntriggers me right it's it's and the\nthings that we say trigger us I mean all\nkinds of stuff can trigger us but\nusually what people are referring to is\nthat a very small dose of\nexposure will lead to a robust or\ndisproportionate\nresponse so this is the first feature\nthis by the way is very physiologic so\nhas nothing to do do with your mind or\nyour feelings or stuff I that's not true\nbut it has a lot to do with that but\nthis is like at the level of biology\nokay so the second thing that we see um\nin let me think about\nhow think about\nthis so this is hyperarousal\nokay now hyperarousal will result in\nthings like avoidance we'll kind of get\nto those in a little bit but now what\nwe're going to talk about is the second\nlevel that we're going to focus on is\nemotions so the other thing that we see\nin in PTSD is that in complex PTSD is\nthat people have a tendency to\ndissociate so we've explained this\nconcept before but it's really important\nto understand\nso our brain has two hemispheres the\nright Hemisphere and the left hemisphere\nthe right hemisphere governs a lot of\nour emotions and the left hemisphere\ngoverns a lot of our analytical\ncapability now this is an\noversimplification because we also know\nthat the dorsal dorso parietal area in\nthe amydala in the limic system there we\nhave emotional structures on both sides\nof our brain so like there's like other\nways that this is not really that\naccurate but it sort of\nis so what Vander kulk he's a he's a\ngreat trauma researcher I think this was\nvander's research what he noticed is\nthat he basically dug into how people\ndissociate so what happens in trauma is\nthat a very low\nthreshold of exposure is necessary for a\nhyperactive physiologic response so if\nwe kind of go back to our\ndiagram I wonder if this is a good way\nto explain it\nso like I don't know if this makes sense\nbut like so we can go from here to here\nand then we can kind of top out\nbut if we look at trauma what happens in\ndissociation is we can't we can't keep\ngoing up right this is like this is the\nmax this is the top you can't get any\nmore stress than that this is\nmaximal\nactivation of the sympathetic nerve\nsystem you can't just keep going up so\nwhat Vander Kul basically noticed is\nthat somewhere around here I'm just sort\nsort of approximating okay this triggers\ndissociation so the stress level is so\nhigh that are are are it's kind of\nlike you know I can I can put wattage\nthrough a light bulb I can increase the\nnumber of the amount of of Watts that go\nthrough a light bulb and the light bulb\nwill get brighter and brighter and\nbrighter until it burns out so this is\nwhat happens in dissociation\ndissociation is usually triggered by a\nhyperactivation of the sympathetic\nnervous system it's like you go all the\nway around the world you're heading east\nand then suddenly you head up end up\nlike west of where you started which is\nlike really weird so this is what\nhappens in\ndissociation is that the the signals are\nso overwhelming the emotions are\noverwhelming the physiology is\noverwhelming that it triggers this\nprocess of dis dissociation now what\nhappens in dissociation a couple of\ndifferent things happen but the key\nthing that we're going to focus on is\ndecreased activity across the Corpus\ncolossum so our right hemisphere is\nwhere we experience emotions our left\nhemisphere is where we experience\nanalysis so as you all know when I get\nemotional my analysis starts getting\nmessed up and so our brain is like I\ncan't handle these emotions I can't\nhandle this is too much activity too\nmuch activity too much activity and\nthere's even um some studies let me see\nif I can find this I don't think I have\nthis prepped but let me see if I can\nfind\nit\nyes okay so what happens this is super\ncool dude so cool but\nweird okay the mechanism underlying this\nprocess is understood as being analogous\nto kindling which involves the emergence\nof generalized seizures in in response\nto repeated Sub sub threshold\nelectrophysiological\nstimulation in PTSD similar to the\nkindling of seizures the progressive\naugmentation and amplification of\nsymptoms occurs over time possibly as\nthe result of neural circuitry\nassociated with emotional memory\nresponse becoming increasingly reactive\nand also expanding into neighboring\nneural circuits so I know that that\nprobably doesn't make a whole lot of\nsense to youall but let's explain what's\ngoing on so basically what happens in\nPTSD is we almost get something like\nseizures right it's not really a seizure\nbut what happens is that there's an\nactivity so if you think about what a\nseizure is a seizure is when you have\nnormally we have controlled electrical\nactivity so neuron turns on second\nneuron turns on first neuron turns off\nsecond neuron turns off this is how it\nworks right so it's like I'm sending a\nsignal and it's goes from here to there\nand then we're done so in a seizure what\nhappens is we have unreg ated electrical\nactivity across the brain so everyone is\njust activating each other and\nactivating each other and activating\neach other so what people have noticed\nin PTSD is there is a similar thing\ngoing on where we have this feeding and\nunregulated upswing of whatever Badness\nis going on so we have panic attacks we\nhave reexperiencing we have flashbacks\nwe feel overwhelmed we feel triggered\nand then much like a seizure so after\nyou after you have a seizure people have\nthis thing called a postal state where\nthey're not quite comos they're like\nsort of semiconscious because their\nbrain just shuts\noff and so the same thing happens in in\nPTSD okay or in trauma is that you have\nthis overactivation and then the brain\nis like enough is enough and then we\ndissociate we just completely unplug now\nwhat happens in dissociation is that we\nhave decreased activity across the\nCorpus colossum so the emotional center\nof our brain which is going absolutely\nHaywire the emotional hemisphere which\nis going absolutely Haywire the left\nside of our brain is like enough is\nenough we can't handle this cut off all\ncontact with the right side of the brain\nthen we dissociate so what this what\nthis feels like is you can watch\nterrible things happening\ndispassionately to yourself the logical\npart of your brain is like this is\nhappening now I'm getting now this\nperson is hurting me now they're hurting\nme more now they're hurting me more this\nis painful period there's no emotional\nconnection to this experience\nokay so once we dissociate once this\nthis process happens and and this is\nwhere I think Vander Co coined this term\nand apologies to the researchers who\ncoined it if I'm misattributing this we\ncall this process hemispheric\nlateralization now this creates all\nkinds of problems because once we\ndisconnect from our emotions we have all\nkinds of challenges okay so if we look\nat what what is the role of\nemotion so emotions do a couple of\nthings emotions give us\ninformation they give us\nmotivation right so let me give you yall\nan example of how they give us\ninformation so if I walk into a room and\neveryone is laughing and then they\nsuddenly go quiet and look at me I feel\nweird right I feel uncomfortable so like\nwhat really happened like my logical\nbrain doesn't know but my emotional\nbrain is like giving me\ninformation when someone calls and\ncancels on you for the third time and\nyou feel angry your brain is telling you\nsomething okay second thing is emotions\ngive us\nmotivation so what we find is that when\nwhen people struggle with trauma and\nthis is the video that we're going to\nshow you all today um let me go back to\nthis so right so like the paralysis of\ninitiative of chronic trauma combines\nwith the apathy and helplessness of\ndepression so what Dr Herman\nnoticed was that when when people have\nbeen traumatized they become like\nlistless like these veterans come back\nfrom their P camps and they don't feel\nlike doing anything they just kind of\nsit around they kind of exist they have\nno Drive they have no passion and if we\nlook at like where does drive and\npassion come from it comes from our\nemotions right well like I'm not going\nto stand for this anymore I want to go\nachieve something I want to be the best\nI want to do better I want to be free I\nwant to relax these are all emotional\nthings the whole problem that a lot of\npeople see in our generation we're\ntalking like Millennials gen Z gen Alpha\nis that we're told that we should do a\ncertain thing so our logical brain is\nlike should study for this test instead\nof playing a video game but my emotional\nbrain is not motivated to do it I'm\nmotivated to do something else so\nemotions are a big part of motivation\nand when we disconnect from our em\nemotions we lose information and then we\nalso lose\nmotivation but there's more at\nplay it turns out that when we lose our\nemotions\nokay we also lose our sense of identity\nnow the question is why so let's\nunderstand what your identity\nis so identity is formed through\nstringing together emotional\nevents so if I ask someone who thinks\nthat they are a loser and I say what\nmakes you a loser let's say there's\nsomeone who's been who's 25 years old so\nthey've been on this Earth for like\n8,000 days okay\nyeah so like way more than 10,000 days\nso let's say someone has been on this\nEarth for 10,000 days and if I ask them\nwhat makes you a loser they are not\ngoing to look at their average\nexperience on a day-to-day basis that's\nnot what makes them a loser 8,000 out of\nthe 10,000 Days my day was relatively\nnormal and like nothing good happened\nnothing bad happened I was just straight\nchilling what makes them a loser is the\nemotional moments in their life that\nmoment that I asked this girl out to a\ndance and she laughed in my face and\nthen told the whole school about it and\nthen everyone made fun of me for the\nweek before school ended and so seven\ndays out of 10,000 becomes this person's\nidentity the flip of it is also true in\nterms of positive things right so when\nsomeone says when I ask someone hey like\nhow do you think about yourself then\nsomeone says I'm I'm a really strong\nperson who's just trying to make do good\nin the world and then I asked them like\nhow did you develop that identity like\nwhat makes you say that tell me about\nyour life and they will tell you\nemotional moments in their life once\nagain it's not about the 10,000 days\nthat they've been alive it's not like\nthat they ate PB and J every single day\nlike that's not a part of their identity\nwhat makes your identity is a string of\nemotional experiences this is why people\nwho like survive cancer like they they\nit becomes a part of their identity like\nI am a cancer survivor because it's an\nemotionally grueling experience right\njoining the military\nvery um you know in my case right so\nlike I failed out and like those were\nvery uh powerful emotional experiences\ngetting into med school like I remember\nthe day that I I still remember the day\nbefore Thanksgiving I got a call from\nthe dean of the medical school after\nthree years of applying saying that hey\nI've been accepted and I wanted to call\nI've been accepted to med school and I\nwanted to call so that you you know\nweren't worried and you had like a Happy\nThanksgiving and then I called my dad\nand I called my grandmother and it was\nlike very joyous and ful and things like\nthat and my you know anyway it was a\nvery powerful moment for me um we can go\ninto more detail if youall want but my\npoint is that if we look at what makes\nour sense of identity it is like strings\nof emotional experiences this breakup\nthis marriage the birth of this child\nLanding this job you know surviving a\nshark attack like like these are the\nmoments getting this award it's\nemotional experiences that create our\nsense of identity so the moment that you\nstart dissociating you lose your sense\nof identity then you're simply existing\nyou're not\nliving so what we see in complex PTSD is\ndisturbances of self-organization and it\nstarts with emotional disregulation so\nwhen your emotions are disregulated when\nyou can't control them you can't really\nmake sense of the world right so like\nthere are times where your emotions get\nout of control and then you end up\ntriggering dis iation so now it's like\nhyperactive emotion followed by\ndissociation there's no way to make\nsense of that it's just like you get\nit's like someone is like it's there's a\ndifference between like painting a\npainting and taking a bucket of paint\nthrowing it on a canvas and then burning\nthe canvas this is the best analogy that\nI can come up with in this moment of the\ndifference between emotional\ndisregulation and disorganization\nthere's no order to it it's just\nemotions out of whack followed by\nunplugging the whole experience\nso when we have this process then we\nlose our sense of identity and this is\nwhat we see in in cptsd so there's if we\nlook at uh diseases like or diagnoses\nlike borderline personality disorder or\nnarcissistic personality\ndisorder what we find in this these\ndiagnoses is a disturbed sense of self\nso in someone with BPD they do not have\na stable sense of self so what does this\nmean so what this means is\nthat if someone if I'm walking down the\nstreet and someone insults me and says\nhey Dr K you're bad at\ngames they opinion of me whatever it is\nor I'm great at games they're saying I'm\nthe best human being on the planet and\nI'm so good at video games whatever\ntheir opinion of me is their opinion\nexists out here and my opinion of me\nexists in here and as they say one thing\nand I say another thing these two things\nconflict so in if enough people say this\nto me then my sense of self will change\nso if you have like this entitled little\nprick of a\nkid how do they become entitled because\ntoo many times their parents or the\npeople around them are telling them over\nand over they're getting signals from\nthe outside world you can do whatever\nyou want you can do whatever you want\nyou can do whatever you want so you\ninternalize\nthis and on the flip side if you get\ntold the opposite if you have someone\nwho has low self-esteem because they're\ntold you're a piece of you're a\npiece of you're a piece of\nthen that becomes internalized so you\nhave a stable sense of self and then you\nhave the outside world's opinion of you\nso what happens in in borderline\npersonality disorder is that their\nstable sense of self disappears it's not\nstably high or stably low so remember\nthat people like who have let's say a\nmood disorder like major depressive\ndisorder they may have a stably low\nsense of self but in BPD the sense of\nself is absent so what that sort of mean\nNot absent but it's it's not well formed\nso what that sort of means is if people\nare treating me well I feel great I am a\ngood person if people are treating me\nwell and if they're treating me poorly\nthen I'm a shitty\nperson this is an unstable sense of self\nand now if you sort of think a little\nbit about complex PTSD PTSD and\nBPD so this is kind of\nwhere you know we're going to I'm going\nto try to explain this a little bit more\nclearly so we know that if you have BPD\nyou have a\nunstable sense of self which by the way\nif youall haven't seen our video on on\nBPD apparently it's really good so like\nI was just like someone told me recently\nthat has a ton of views and we've gotten\nreally positive feedback about it so so\nwatch it we've got PTSD over here with\nour\narousal\nvigilance and\navoidance and then we have\ncptsd which is these Plus plus this DSO\nwhich is Disturbed\nself-organization so emotional\ndisregulation left out an S there but GG\nGet Wrecked to noobs um emotional\ndisregulation identity\nissues and relationship issues and we'll\nget to relationships in a bit so what we\nkind of see is that like BPD has these\ntwo\nbut BPD doesn't have these so BPD so now\nlike this is really important to\nunderstand C cptsd is this plus this BPD\nis just this without this and then maybe\nsome additional stuff does that make\nsense so we know that\ntrauma can cause this if it's one time\nif it's chronic causes this and if it's\nchronic causes\nthis but it depending on the nature of\nthe trauma and the fre fre quency and\nyour genetics and and stuff like that\nlike it it kind of changes the\nmanifestation so the reason I think this\nlecture is super important is because I\nam seeing this as its own independent\nset of cluster the cluster of symptoms\ngrow in the population more and more\nproblem are more and more people are\nhaving problems with this without\nnecessarily this or\nthis okay so what happens in in cpts is\nwe have a disordered sense of\nidentity which then results in all kinds\nof problems okay so the first thing is\nin BPD you know what the way that people\nfeel about me determines the way that I\nfeel about myself so there's no\npersistent sense of self to fight\nagainst other people's opinions right if\nI'm confident in here people can bully\nme and I can fight back but in BPD they\ncan't do that and in cptsd they can't do\nthat because this is not well formed the\nreason it's not well formed is because\nwe don't we're so emotionally\ndisregulated that we do not lay down a\nfoundation of of who we are this all\nalso creates all kinds of other problems\nso in cptsd and in\nBPD we see that there's a lot of\nimpulsivity so why is there impulsivity\nso on the one hand there's paralysis of\ninitiation so people have difficulty\ngetting things started that's the video\nthat we're going to watch at the end of\nthe Deep dive today by the way okay so\nwe're going to teach all this because so\nthis is like half of our community\nstruggles with this I have trouble\ngetting started and it's so cool that\nthe research on trauma helps us\nunderstand why your brain has difficulty\ngetting\nstarted so we have difficulty getting\nstarted and then we also have\nimpulsivity very common in complex PTSD\nand the question is why\nso impulsive\nis the desire to do something for a\nlittle\nwhile right so it's like I'm impulsive\nso impulsive is not in action it is\ntemporary action it is sudden\naction and so what what we see a lot is\npeople have difficulty with follow\nthrough right I can't stay\nconsistent why so if you look at where\nconsistency comes from consistency comes\nfrom two places the environment outside\nyou if you have an environment that is\nstructured then you will be consistent\nright so like let's say you're in\nprison and like I used to have patients\nwho would tell me oh yeah I had such big\nproblems with insomnia and I was like\nwhat worked for you and he was like\ngoing to prison I don't have insomnia\nanymore and I was like why not and he's\nlike well I have no choice I have no\ncell phone I have to go to sleep at the\nsame time I've been here for 3 years for\n365 days for 3 years in a row I've gone\nto sleep at the same time and I wake up\nat the same time like I have no\nchoice but if we do not have a horribly\nstructured life then our consistency\ncomes from our sense of\nidentity right why do you go to the gym\nevery day because I want to be in shape\nI want to be healthy I enjoy it why do\nyou play games every day I enjoy them\nwhy do you play games every day I don't\nknow I hate them so your sense of self\nis what gives you a Drive in a direction\nover time so I worked with a I've worked\nwith a couple but I'm thinking about one\nOlympic Athlete many years ago and so\nlike when I talked to this person you\nknow like how did you I was s curious I\nwas like this the first person I worked\nwith who was an Olympic Athlete I was\nlike how did you become an Olympic\nAthlete like tell me about that like\nwhat's that like and it's like a very\nstrong sense of self that drives you\nforward so that when there are setbacks\nwhen RNG happens that strong sense of\nself keeps you focused on the task at\nhand\nso what is impulsivity so impulsivity is\na combination of emotional\ndisregulation and a lack of sense of\nself so when my emotions arise over here\nand I don't have a grounding from in\nhere I'll I'll jump over there and as\nthe emotion disappears I stop doing it\nbecause I have no driving force from it\nhere so another very common feature of\ncptsd is impulsivity and paradoxically\nparalysis of initiation\nso why how can those two things go\ntogether well like because remember it's\nnot the problem with paralysis of\ninitiation is that you want to start\nsomething but you can't bring yourself\nto start it so if if you're someone who\nreally struggles to get things started\nwhat you will find is that there's a\ncorrelation between getting things\nstarted and being\nimpulsive because in both cases you're\nnot in control in both cases in one case\nyou can't drive over your emotions and\nin the other case your emotions are\ntaking advantage of you and they're\nmaking you impulsive and now you do this\nand now you do that so these are common\nfeatures in cptsd and they have to do\nwith a combination of lack of identity\nand emotional\ndisregulation now we get to the third\nthing which\nis\nrelationships so people who have cptsd\nhave difficulty in their relationships\nnow this is where we get to some really\ncool neuroscience\nso\num I think it's\nhere okay let's actually take a look at\nsome science to kind of support these\npoints\nokay\nso um what we find in people who have\ncptsd is that they have poor emotional\nawareness so they're not aware when\nthey're feeling emotions right this is a\nresult of like this dissociative pathway\nor hemispheric\nlateralization so an as emotional\nawareness enables increased\nself-reflection and regulation of\naffective states it is often considered\na Cornerstone of emotion regulation so\nlet's understand this for a\nmoment see you can't regulate an emotion\nunless you're aware of an\nemotion and as we dissociate and we're\nnot we we numb ourselves to our emotions\nthen we can't regulate them now this is\nvery important to understand when you\nnumb yourself to an emotion it doesn't\nmean that the emotion is inactive it\njust means that you're not aware of its\nactivity so what happens when someone\ndissociates is that they're they don't\nfeel any emotion but that part of their\nbrain doesn't completely shut off it is\nstill active we're just not aware of it\nso people who struggle with\ncptsd will be less emotionally aware at\nsome times and also paradoxically hyper\nemotionally aware at other times okay so\nwe're not going to go into the\nneurobiology of emotional selfawareness\nI think that's a bit too detailed but\nlet's talk about this okay the\nneurocircuitry underlying emotional\nnumbing in\nPTSD so increased emotional numbing\nsymptoms predicted decreased brain\nactivation within the dorsomedial\nprefrontal cortex during imagery of both\npositive and negative social scripts\nconsistent with the role of dorsomedial\nprefrontal Cortex in higher order\nreflective and metacognitive aspects of\nof emotional functioning\num so we'll explain what that means in a\nsecond I just want to read this too so\nuh the developmental the development of\nneural circuitry\nfacilitating May therefore be disturbed\nin PC PTSD leading to the difficulties\nthese individuals often have in\nreflecting on interpreting and acting in\naccordance with emotion a patient\nsuffering from PTSD related to prolonged\nchildhood abuse summarized feelings of\nemotional numbing in the following\nstatement it's like a blank I think\nabout my kids and I feel nothing for\nthem I'll be sitting there feeling\nconfused and numb and I wonder what I'm\nsupposed to be feeling it's like dead\nspace and when that happens I have\ntrouble using words finding my words and\nI can't\ntalk so let's understand how you can\nhave\nnumbness and feel emotionally\ndisregulated this is what we mean by\ndisregulated disregulation doesn't just\nmean hyper action it also hyperactivity\nit also means low levels of activity and\nhigh levels of activity at the same time\nand this is where the Neuroscience\nbecomes\nimportant so as we look at the\nNeuroscience of cptsd versus PTSD we\nfind that there's actually different\nplaces that emotions come from in the\nbrain\nand it turns out that the\ncptsd affects different regions okay so\nnow we're going to get into the\nNeuroscience so we have our amydala and\nthen we have this\ndorsomedial prefrontal\ncortex now remember was we looked at\nthis paper we saw that decreased\nactivation within the dorsal medial\nprefrontal cortex okay so this is like a\ndifferent region so most of the time\nwhen we talk about\nemotions what most people especially pop\nneuroscientists like\nmyself will talk about is the amydala\nthis is the fear Center the survival\ncenter the anxiety center of the brain\nfear\nanxiety\nsurvival and what we find in people with\nwith PTSD is that this is hyperactive so\nlike think about how this is okay\nI want you to think about this\nthis is so pardon my\nlanguage so here we\nhave presumably a man or woman I'm not\nsure who is emotionally disregulated so\nhas like panic attacks and stuff like\nthat has hyperarousal and then when they\nlook at their kids they feel confused\nand numb so like this is like this is\nnot fair so we feel confused and numb to\nour positive emotions but we have a\nhyperactivity of our negative emotions\nlike how is that fair panic and anxiety\nand fear we can feel normally or even at\nhyperactive levels because remember in\nPTSD we're we're\naroused but love and things like that I\ncan't feel so this is something very\nimportant to understand the amydala is\nwhere we feel feel fear and anxiety in\nsurvival stuff but a lot of our positive\nemotions a lot of our other emotions\ncome from other parts of the brain like\nthe dorsal medial prefrontal\ncortex and so what we see in complex\nPTSD is specifically a\ndeactivation of those parts of the brain\nwe see a deactivation of the positive\nemotional circuits of the brain which\nare actually is actually the dorsal\nmedial prefrontal\ncortex while we see a hyperactivation of\nthe amydala which is our fear center now\nthe reason I think this is important is\nI see this in a lot of people who do not\nhave\ncptsd I see a hyperactivation of our\nfear for the future the world is going\nto hell I'm screwed I'm going to be\nalone today is Friday so we have a bunch\nof posts on our subreddit about how\neveryone is\nhopeless and yet they have a\nhyperactivation of their negative\nemotions but a hypoactivation of their\npositive emotions how is this Fair it's\nnot now we understand the\nneuroscientific\nmechanism right it's because not all\nemotions come from the same\nplace and what we see in P cptsd is\nhypoactivation of the dorsomedial part\nof the brain so this is where look\npositive emotion dorsal medial\nprefrontal\ncortex negative emotion was also kind of\nin the same place anyway it's kind of\nweird the amydala I think is usually\nover\nhere but yeah it's also weird because\nthis person's backwards anyway so we may\nexperience negative emotion there it's\ncomplicated so now what we're going to\ndo is talk a little bit uh okay so\nthat's that's emotional\ndisregulation\nokay um let now let's talk a little bit\nabout self-awareness and identity okay\nso specifically during traumatic memory\nrecall increasing severity of trait\nAlexia we talk a lot about Alexia which\nis emotional color blindness was\nassociated with reduced activity within\nthe vent medial prefrontal cortex and\ninterior\ninsula okay we talked about\nkinling\num so I think we already covered\nthis okay now let's talk about identity\nright so remember we said that this\ndisturbs our sense of identity\nindividuals with PTSD often exhibit\ndisturbances in self-referential\nprocessing uh Johnson at Al proposed\nthat the ability to reflect upon on ones\nself requires a robust sense of self\nwhich has been described as a collection\nof schemata regarding one's abilities\ntraits and attitudes that guides our\nbehaviors choices and social\ninteractions so we kind of already\nexplained this but does this make sense\nlike the sense of self is a collection\nof ideas they use schemata because it's\nnot quite an idea about your abilities\nyour traits and your attitudes I like\ntacos I don't like hot dogs I'm good at\nthis game I'm bad at studying I'm a I'm\na dog person I'm a cat person I'm a I'm\na night owl I'm a morning Lark like we\nhave like this kind of stuff and then\nalso when we have these kinds of beliefs\nabout oursel they affect our behaviors\nchoices and social\ninteractions right so if I'm if I am a\ngamer if I identify as a gamer I'm more\nlikely to play more video\ngames\nso now let's understand the mechanism\nthrough which people with CP TSD have\ndifficulty doing\nthis neuroimaging studies suggest that\nself-referential processing is partly\nmediated by via cortical midline\nstructures we're going to focus on the\nanterior singulate okay and the temporal\npulse temporal prial Junction and\ntemporal\npulse see if that\nno all\nright so this is\nwhere basically what happens is the\nparts of our brain that that give us our\nsense of self which is the anterior\nsingulate the default mode Network and\nour parietal temporo parietal regions of\nthe brain these parts are impaired in\ncptsd so our sense of self does not\nfunction quite the same way now if you\nall remember at the very beginning I\nsaid if you electrically stimulate the\ntemporoparietal junction this is the not\nthe junction but those regions of the\nbrain are impaired in cptsd if I\nelectrically stimulate the Pro parietal\nJunction I will trigger an outof Body\nExperience so what is an outof body\nexperience that an outof body experience\nis an experience of my\nConsciousness existing outside of my\nbody right so this is the part of the\nbrain that governs like my experience of\nself and if it is impaired in some way\nmy sense of identity will not form well\nif my sense of identity does not form\nwell that'll result in problems in terms\nof behaviors the choices that I make\nEtc the last Dimension that we're going\nto talk\nabout is\nrelationships so in order to have a\nrelationship we must have a sense of\nidentity because a relationship is\nsomething between me and you there's a\nchunk of you in there and there's a\nchunk of me in there but if my sense of\nidentity is Disturbed my capacity to\nhave a relationship with another human\nbeing is impaired\npractically what this looks like is\nsomething very similar to BPD where when\nyou have cptsd and you try to have a\nrelationship with someone else like you\ndon't add a whole lot to the equation\nI'm not saying that you don't factually\nadd value to the relationship what I'm\nsaying is that your personality does not\nenter and shape the relationship in the\nsame way that someone who's well formed\nhas a well formed sense of identity does\nyou know you sometimes what this means\nis that you become a doormat you become\na people pleaser you don't really have a\nwhole lot of strong opinions you become\na chameleon these are all three\ndifferent variants of how cptsd shapes\nour\nrelationships in BPD like sometimes like\nso I I've worked with some women who\nhave BPD\nand the people that they date feel like\nthey found the perfect partner for the\nfirst couple of weeks because whatever\ntheir partner is into they're into and\nlike I've had friends male friends who\nhave who've probably dated women with\nBPD and I I've heard what the way that\nthey describe them they'll say like oh\nmy God this person is amazing she's into\nlike anime and she's into this and she\nlikes she hates wine and she loves beer\nshe likes she loves matcha but she hates\ncoffee she's like perfect she's like a\nfemale version of me and she's\nhot and so they'll say things like this\nand the gender roles can be reversed too\nabsolutely but what happens is when when\nwe don't have a sense sense of self it\nbecomes hard to have a relationship\nbecause we absorb the other person's\nthings so in BPD it's more about\nabsorption of the other person in cptsd\nit doesn't have to be that way we can\nsee doormat we can see people pleaser\nbecause I don't have a sense of\nidentity and once we have these doormat\nand people pleaser Tendencies we also\nopen ourselves up for more toxicity in\nrelationships because I don't advocate\nfor\nmyself right because I you're better\nthan I am I don't have a sense when you\ntreat me like crap I do not have\nsomething in here that instinctively\nRebels so if you have a well-formed\nsense of\nidentity and someone treats you like\ncrap you recognize that you deserve\nbetter and that idea that you deserve\nbetter where do that idea comes from it\ncomes from a sense of self it when you\njust think about the mechanics of this\nokay think about the language that I'm\nusing when I say I deserve better there\nis a stable\nconception of what I this quantity of I\ndeserves I don't deserve $10 million I\ndon't deserve zero doar I deserve\n$100 that is based on your\nidentity now in the case of narcissism\nthat identity is too\nhigh so what that means is if anyone\nremember this root of narcissism is\nactually insecurity so if anyone gives\nyou even 1% less than you deserve you\nbecome prickly like a\nporcupine you're like I deserve better\nand it's like bro like you got what you\ndeserve this is crazy like I did\neverything that I could for\nyou and the opposite is also true where\nwhen you don't deserve any like when you\ndeserve when you don't have a sense of\nself then how can you deserve if you\nhave no eye no stable sense of self and\nwhat you\ndeserve so this creates all kinds of\nproblems in relationships and we see\nthat in in cptsd right so the dis\ndisturbances of self-organization result\nin emotional\ndisregulation hyperactivity using\nsomething like a kindling mechanism\nespecially in the negative emotional\nregions of the brain where you have this\nsub threshold electrical activity that\nthen activates it's like you're just\ngoing about your day and then suddenly\nyou feel intensely sad and you're like\nwhat the right you don't actually\nthink that way because it's normal for\nyou but people outside of you look at\nyou and they're like I don't understand\nwhy this person just gets so upset so\nrandomly and they do what they can to\nhelp and if you know people in your life\nwho do this right they just go into\nfunks for like very intensely for a day\nand you're like what's wrong and they're\nlike I don't know or nothing and then we\nif you're if you're like a normal person\nright I don't mean that in a in a\njudgmental way I mean that if you have a\nbrain that is not developed like this\nyou look at this and you say tell me\nwhat's wrong and they say nothing's\nwrong and they're crying their\neyes out and you're like what the\nbecause and and the thing is in their\ncase it they're right nothing is wrong\nthis is what's wild about trauma see\nwhen you look at someone like that and\nyou think there must be something wrong\nwhy because in order for you to cry that\nhard you need something that is so\npowerful that it overcomes your sense of\nself and makes you cry really hard in\ntheir case they have a seizure\nlike activity in their amydala that just\ndisregulated\na different way the rules that the brain\nis playing by are different that's\nwhat's wrong with you there's nothing\nwrong with your personhood the way that\nyour neurons are activating are closer\nto a seizure which is why you have the\ndisrupted emotional regulation and you\njust feel things so intensely and it\ncomes out of nowhere and it's so\nconfusing and it's so\ndebilitating\nokay and then there's also dorso medial\nnumbness which results in like not being\nable to like do things like feel\nspontaneous love for your kids and all\nthat kind of stuff it's all super sad\nand super debilitating cptsd is a really\nbad\ndiagnosis good news is that it can get\nvery you can get way better right so\nthis is not it's\nnot\num it's not your\ndestiny so the cool thing and I guess\nwe'll get into this now is that we\nactually know we have a sequence of\nthings that you can do that will\nsustainably get you better now there are\na couple of good things about\ntreatment the first thing to understand\nis that trauma is an\nadaptation which means that you weren't\nborn this way this is your brain\nadapting to circumstances which means\nthat if your brain adapted once it can\nadapt again right this is very different\nfrom something like having a genetic you\nknow a two recessive that result in a\ngenetic deficiency in the blueprint of\nwhat your body is capable of making\nthere is a problem so until we get to\nGene replacement therapy like there's\nnothing that can be done about that\nright like the fundamental Machinery\nlike there's no it's like we're building\na computer but there's like no place for\nthe\nCPU right and then like there's no way\nto get that computer to work the good\nnews about trauma is even though it is\nso debilitating even though it it feels\nlike it it screws over every dimension\nof your\nlife the majority of it can get better\nbecause these are all adaptations\nthey're not the core thing they're the\nstuff that you've layered on top so you\ncan systematically go about changing\nthat okay so how do we change this the\nfirst thing that we have to do is rewire\nour physiology okay so we go through\nthis in a more step-by-step process in\nthe guide so a lot of people with trauma\nand Vander kulk is a big advocate of\nthis so he runs this place called the\ncenter of trauma and they do a lot of\nyoga so what we tend to find is there\nare a couple of key principles the first\nis you have to be comfortable in your\nown body and mind body practices are\nvery good at doing this so we what we\nspecifically want to do to be\ncomfortable within our own body our body\nhas these the sense of we actually have\nsix senses okay the six sense the six\nsense is\nnot being able to see dead people the\nsense is something called\nproprioception so proprioception is our\nsense of our body in space so if I like\nclose my eyes and I lift my arm I can\ntell where my arm is that's technically\nnot the same as touching something right\nthis is like a sense of where my body is\nand proprioception seems to be really\ngood at helping us rewire our physiology\nso a lot of studies show that things\nlike yoga and taii are very effective\nfor condition that have hyperactivity of\nthe central nervous system or sorry not\nCentral autonomic nervous system panic\nattacks high blood pressure anxiety\ndisorders postural orthostatic tartic\nsyndrome Mind Body practices are really\ngood at this we know that mindbody\npractices recruit things like the vagus\nnerve which is our our primary\nparasympathetic nerve in the body so\nwhen we meditate our vagus nerve turns\non it slows down our heart rate it slows\ndown it decreases our blood pressure it\nactivates our GI system it does all\nkinds of good\nstuff so practically what I describe is\nwhat we really want to do is something\ncalled autonomic\nstretch so the best way to so this is\nimportant to understand so remember that\nour nervous system our autonomic nervous\nsystem has sympathetic and\nparasympathetic okay actually go back to\nthis\nthis work okay great so I'm going to\nshow you all this okay so let's take a\nlook okay so our nervous system our\nautonomic nervous system has sympathetic\nnervous system and parasympathetic\nnervous system\nokay so normally what happens is this\none is active about 50% of the time and\nthis one is active about 50% of the time\nand anywhere between 45 minutes and 2\nhours\nis the oscillation between the\ntwo so the problem with stress is not\nthe stress it's that it's chronic so\nwhen we have chronic strength stress we\nhave 90% activation over here and we\nhave 10% activation over here so it\nbecomes difficult then what happens is\nour body gets stuck in this\nmode so anytime the body gets stuck it\nloses flexibility I know it's kind of\nlike a silly statement but so in in\nPhysical Medicine right so Physical\nMedicine and Rehab sometimes we'll have\nsomething called a muscle\ncontracture so muscle contracture is\nwhen you hold your your body in a\ncertain way okay and when you wow that\nvein looks\nhuge sorry distracted by\n it's a real pity I don't shoot\nheroin cuz that's one hell of a\npain okay um\nso this is why I love streaming like you\nknow when I'm when I'm like teaching at\nlike medical schools like you can't do\nthat all right this is why I love\nteaching here all right so if I hold my\nbody in a particular posture I will\ndevelop something called a contracture\nso a muscle can get locked into\ntightness okay so if I'm like sitting at\nmy computer all day the trapezius will\nget very tight your scaling muscles will\nget very tight your anterior scalings\nwill get super tight if you want to feel\nhow tight your anterior scalings are by\nthe way this is super cool exercise you\ncan do what I want you to do is tuck\nyour chin back and turn and what you'll\nfeel if you just tuck your chin back and\nthen turn you'll feel like this super\ntight muscle over here so when our when\nour muscles are in a sustained\ncontraction they lose flexibility\nso this happens in our nervous system as\nwell they get locked into a sympath a\nhyperactivation of the sympathetic\nnervous system so what we want to do is\nincrease our autonomic stretch and the\nbeautiful thing about this is that when\nwhen you look at stress okay this is\nfascinating you can meditate to decrease\nstress or you can exercise to decre\ndecrease stress that's weird because\nwhen you exercise you're not relaxing\nyou're actually doing the opposite you\nare activating the par the sympathetic\nnervous system so the cool thing about\nautonomic stretch is anytime we\nhyperactivate the sympathetic nervous\nsystem we automatically send a signal to\nour body that we are going to rest when\nwe are done so if I'm at a chronic state\nof\nstress\nokay so let's say that this\nis let's say this is the midpoint\nand let's say this is sympathetic\nnervous system this is parasympathetic\nnervous system so most of us live over\nhere but if you are in a chronic stress\nstate you live over here so how do we\nget things back over here one thing we\ncan do is\nmeditate meditate brings us\nhere and then after we're done\nmeditating maybe we'll go to there the\nother thing that we can actually do is\nexercise so exercising will actually\nbring us up here but when we get up here\nright so when you exercise a lot what do\nyou feel like doing you feel like\nresting so if I run really really hard\nand my CO2 level\nspikes and my O2 level starts to drop as\nI'm increasing muscular respiration I\nmean muscular respiration my body is\nlike oh crap we've run out of oxygen now\nsit the down and rest so we feel\nexhausted after exercise we don't feel\nenergetic which means that once we hit\nthis point this triggers a signal in our\nbody to go back down\nhere and then when we end up we'll end\nup here now the cool thing is when you\ndo both exercise and meditate you will\nget here\nfaster and if you do this kind of thing\nit will actually improve\nyour it'll improve your autonomic\narousal so it'll help with things like\ntrauma it'll help with things like\ngeneralized anxiet disorder it'll help\nwith things like panic attacks you can\ndo both the key thing is actually\noscillating see if I want to stretch a\nmuscle stretching a muscle isn't just\ndoing this stretching a muscle is doing\nthis and then doing this and then doing\nthis and then doing this this is what\nreally increases\nflexibility okay it's not just going\nlike this and keeping it there this in\nturn will lock the muscle into this\nconfiguration so we want to alternate\nbetween the\ntwo so as we rewire that physiology our\nhyperarousal will come down second thing\nwe need to do is reconnect with our\nemotions now this is where the cool\nthing is that we actually don't have to\nreconnect with our emotions to reconnect\nwith our emotions okay give me a\nsecond\num let me see if I can find\nthis um\num let's see if I can find I think it's\nover here hold on you guys can look with\nme ah\n there we go\nokay thank God I remember the word that\nthey used okay um\n[Music]\nand okay so conceptual emotional\nawareness refers to the the ability to\nreflect on interpret and make a decision\nabout an embodied sensation or emotion\nokay um so there are a couple of\ndifferent things that we can do to\nincrease our\nself-awareness\nuh where is\nthis yeah okay during this phase of\ntreatment patients have to develop an\nawareness and language that helps them\nidentify bodily Sensations and how\ndifferent bodily Sensations relate to\ndifferent emotional experiences for\nexample for one person tension in the\njaw in combination with a feeling of\ntightness in the throat May correlate\nwith sadness while in another individual\nsadness May correlate with tightness in\nthe stomach and a feeling of heaviness\nin the chest by developing emotional\nawareness patients can learn to identify\nprecursors blah blah blah blah blah blah\nblah okay so there's basically two or\nthree things that we're going to do to\nreconnect with our emotions the first is\njust be aware of your bodily Sensations\nso remember and this is what's cool\nabout the\nNeuroscience okay I'm going to try to\nexplain this because this is huge but I\ndon't know if I can explain\nit so if we look at this\npaper okay what this paper tells\nus where's table one is that different\nparts of our brain are messed up by\nPTSD come on table one where are you at\ntable one there we go okay so if we look\nat table one here are all the things\nthat are affected so medial prefrontal\ncortex self\nreferential you know um let's look at\nthe anterior singulate integrates\ncognitive and emotional aspects of\nexperience right we have all these\ndifferent parts of the\nbrain now the thing is these parts of\nthe brain have these broad functions\nright so the the thing to understand\nabout the brain is we used to think that\nlike a particular part of the brain does\na particular\nthing but what I want youall to\nunderstand is that regions of the brain\nare like letters of the\nalphabet the way that they connect and\ncombine with each other is actually what\ncreates a particular phenomenon in our\nlife so curiosity or love there isn't a\nlove Center to the brain a love Center\nthe love Cent the the way we experience\nlove in the brain can just hypothesize\nbased on this is some medial prefrontal\ncortex some anterior singulate\ncortex some\namygdala and some insula see when we\ncombine\nself-referential this is me I am in love\nand there's an emotion emotional aspect\nthere's emotional salience what that\nmeans is feeling this means this thing\nwhat is the significance of the emotion\nI have a sense of me I have this emotion\nI attach a significance to the emotion\nand then I also have some degree of fear\nbecause what if this person doesn't love\nme\nback and then I also have bodily\nself-awareness because when they're\naround I start to feel changes in my\nbody my body changes I ache for you I\nneed your\nbody that's what love is there isn't a\npart of the brain it is a concert of\ndifferent parts of the brain interacting\nwith each\nother okay literally like so like if you\nguys have been in love you know what I\nmean like your body aches for someone\nelse like think about that from a\nneuroscientific perspective you can't\nache for someone else unless the part of\nyour body that senses your\nSensations is aware of what you feel in\nhere is active in some\nway okay so now we have a problem which\nis that these parts of the brain are\nshut off in\ntrauma\nsimplification so the cool thing is that\nin order to reverse this process we do\nnot have to fix it we just have to\nawaken the part of the\nbrain see if we increase the activity of\nthe brain if we like reawaken our dorsal\nmedial cortex prefrontal cortex right\nthis where positive emotions come from\nall we have to do is activate that in\nsome way and once it's on it will start\nto feel other things we see this in\nclinical trials and I see it in my\nclinical practice I'm somewhat\nextrapolating here so in clinical trials\non yoga for trauma just think about this\nfor a second what the is the\nmechanism it's not just autonomic\nnervous system what's happening is we\nare activating this part of the brain\nthrough this yogic practice I can't find\nthe sentence in in this paper but even\nthe paper sort of talks about all we\nhave to do is just activate the part of\nthe brain even just increasing your\nawareness of emotions and even awareness\nof your body you don't have to increase\nawareness of emotions you just increase\nawareness of the body and you will have\nan increased awareness of emotion why\nbecause some part of an emotion is\nphysical butter flies in the stomach\ntightness in the\nthroat so you can kind of backend\nemotional awareness through bodily\nawareness then what you can do is by the\nway I don't know if yall noticed this\nbut we've been teaching you all this\ncrap for years and that wasn't because I\nread this paper it's because I sort of\nfound this in my clinical experience\nthat especially for men accessing their\nemotions through their body is very\ngood okay so\nincreased autonomic flexibility number\none increased awareness of the body\nnumber two third thing is articulate\nyour emotions physically if you don't if\nyou don't have awareness of them fourth\nthing we want to\ndo what's the fourth thing oh yeah\narticulate our emotions\nactually attach language to them this we\ngo into in a lot more detail we can't go\ninto everything in all detail in in the\nguide but the cool thing is remember we\nhave this problem of hemispheric\nlateralization which means negative\nemotions are over here or emotions are\nover here and languages over here when\nwe have decreased awareness I me\ndecreased communication through\ndecreased activity across the Corpus\ncolossum right and left hemispheres\naren't talking what do you feel I don't\nknow frustrated stressed those aren't\nemotion I mean frustration isn't emotion\nthere's no emotional Nuance so in order\nto literally articulate your emotion you\nhave to increase the connectivity so as\nyou as I ask you what do you feel what\ndo you feel what do you feel as you\nstruggle to answer what's going on is\nyour neurons from this side are reaching\nover and connecting with your neurons\nover here what do I feel it's like hard\nit's like you're reaching reaching\ntrying to grab it trying to grab it\ntrying to grab it and even if you fail\nto say the right thing even if you don't\nknow what you you experience you don't\nknow what you feel those neurons are\nreaching that's where the money\nis so I've seen this a lot where people\nfeel like the therapy isn't\nworking because they don't see progress\nin 3 weeks and if you're looking for the\nability to articulate in 3 weeks it's\nnot going to happen but the therapy is\nworking because your neurons are\nReaching Across the Corpus kosum\nbridging that Chasm and eventually the\nthey'll figure it out and if they figure\nit out then once they figure it out it's\nfigured out you will level up your EQ\nyou will level up your emotional\nawareness and that will be a neuronal\nconnection that is\nformed this is why I have hope for\npeople with\ntrauma see everyone thinks it's all\nabout these temporary States like I'm\nemotional no what we're doing is we're\nlaying neuronal\nhighways and once the highway when the\nhighway is 90% built there's no traffic\nbut the moment it gets built you can get\na ton of traffic across so what I tend\nto see when I work with people is that\ntheir progress is nothing nothing\nnothing boom nothing nothing nothing\nnothing boom nothing nothing nothing\nnothing\nnothing so this is what we want to do we\nwant to utilize language so as we Pro\ndiscover our emotions then that allows\nus to do a couple of different things\nokay so we're going to go back to this\nperson who's\nnumb oh God\nuh where is that\nquote looking for the one oh yeah okay\nhere it\nis\nso remember this where we say it's a\nblank I think about my kids and I feel\nnothing for them I'll be sitting there\nfeeling confused and numb and I wonder\nwhat's supposed to it's like a dead\nspace right so this is dorsal medial\nprefrontal cortex is not active\nnow when this person lives this life\nand they go to their child's birthday\nparty and they feel\nnothing there's nothing they don't have\na s like their identity is lost does\nthis make sense because like if you\nthink about what does it mean to be a\nparent like I went to this birthday\nparty for my kid I planned it I saw the\nJoy on their face I saw all their\nfriends be super super happy they've\nbeen struggling to make friends at\nschool but everyone had such a good time\nthat now their social like status\namongst their friends is now improved so\nthat makes me happy now I feel like a\ngood parent but I can't feel like a good\nparent unless I can connect with the joy\nin my\nchild so not only does this person feel\nemotionally enough their sense of\nidentity is going to be\ncompromised so that's where once we\nstart feeling things we're going to do\ntwo things to rebuild our sense of\nidentity the first is there's a lot of\ndormant negative emotion which our mind\nhas dissociated from which still lingers\nthere and the reason we dissociate from\nit is because it's overwhelming if we\nlet it overwhelm us our sense of\nidentity will get swept away so as we\nstart connecting the two parts of our\nbrain and articulating stuff all of that\nemotional Energy starts getting vented\nand essentially the negative emotions\nthat we store start\nleaving if you do this process in\nPsychotherapy even better because it'll\ngo\nfaster as these things start to\nleave then your negative sense of\nidentity will disappear with it the\nsecond thing that will happen is you\nwill start to be able to engage in\npositive experiences which will then\nrecreate your\nidentity so now when you climb to the\ntop of the mountain you'll feel\nsomething and then you'll be like I did\nit right so in both cases you did it but\nin one case you don't feel that you did\nit and in the other case you feel that\nyou did it you need dorsal medial\nprefrontal activation to feel like you\ndid\nit\nokay then what happens is once we awaken\ndifferent parts of the\nbrain where's\n[Music]\nscan I'm going to show you\nall a different paper hold on\nI can't find it what the\n okay I'll just explain it to yall\nwithout showing you all the paper okay\nI'll try to find it later\noh okay so\nnext thing\nis\num what did I want to say so the next\nthing is that if we look\nat the Neuroscience of\nemotions what we now know is that not\nall emotions are like the same\nNeuroscience so we have something called\naffective\nNeuroscience which is the emotions that\nrelate to like the way that we feel\nabout the way we feel about our not\nabout ourselves the way that we feel let\nme start over so we now know that\nemotions can be divided into two\ncamps affective Neuroscience are the\nemotions that are independent of society\nso for example if I'm hiking down a\nmountain and a bear shows\nup like I can feel fear or Joy or\nwhatever right like I can feel that like\nI don't need a human being but if we\nlook at human emotions there's a pile of\nhuman emotions that require a social\nconnection\nshame guilt Pride you cannot be proud\nwithout someone observing your pride you\ncannot be shamed without being observed\nyou can't feel guilty without doing\nsomething bad for someone else so what\nwe've actually discovered is that there\na couple of different emotional centers\nin the brain and these primitive\nemotions that reptiles reptiles can feel\nfear they can feel anger right but I\ndon't know that reptiles can feel proud\nlike I don't know if like a crocodile\nlike has the social connection with\nother crocodiles to feel Pride when we\nget to primates and stuff they\nabsolutely can so there is a social\nconnection pile of emotions those\nemotions exist in a different part of\nthe brain they get activated under\ndifferent circumstances so once we start\ndeveloping our identity these emotions\nwill arise as well they will start\ngetting fixed once these emotions get\nfixed so it's not just the sense of\nidentity so now I built a sense of\nidentity and my social cognitive\nemotions have become active so once\nthese two things get fixed now I can fix\nrelationships because when the shame\nWithin Me is haywire and not functioning\ncorrectly it becomes very hard to engage\nin a relationship my partner tells me I\nlove you I think you're beautiful and I\nfeel ashamed of myself so I say no I'm\nnot so that becomes hard until that part\nof my brain gets kind of cleaned out and\nnormalized then I can do things like\naccept\ncompliments okay so then the last thing\nto get fixed is\nrelationships now in our community why\nis this\nimportant see in our community there's a\nlot of people especially because today's\na Friday and Friday is relationships day\nwho are saying I'm struggling to get\ninto a relationship and outside of our\ncommunity not just our commun everyone's\nstruggling to get into a relationship\nright some people are you know having\nsex and stuff some people are friends\nwith benefits very few people are happy\nwith their relationships and people say\nhow do I fix my relationship how do I\nfix my relationship and what everyone\nsays is work on yourself first and then\npeople get frustrated by this\nanswer now I hope yall understand the\nmechanism\nsee this is where like when I see people\nlike tweeting stuff I can't say all of\nthis but if you want to understand how\nto fix your relationship or if anyone\nyou know wants to understand how to fix\nthem Rel their relationship they need to\nwatch this\nvideo because we have to understand that\nthe\nrelationship is at the height of what a\nhuman being can fix it is at the top of\nthe pyramid you can't fix a relationship\nif you don't feel emotions you can't fix\na relationship if your emotions are\ndisregulated you can't fix a\nrelationship if your dorsal medial\nprefrontal cortex cannot feel Joy and\naccomplishment you can't fix a\nrelationship if your sense of identity\nturns you into either a chameleon or a\ndoormat the relation the best way to\nmake a healthy relationship is to be a\nhealthy human\nbeing now this gets even further\ncomplicated because part of being a\nhealthy human being can come through\nrelationships absolutely\nbut this is what we're talking about\nright so this is where people say like\nhow do I like get this person to do this\nget this person to do this get this\nperson to do this and here I am I'm\ntalking about how to fix your\nrelationships and I've not given you one\nioda of advice about what to do if\nsomeone doesn't text you back and I\ndon't need to and you don't need\nit if the brain that has evolved for\nmillions of years to allow you to engage\nin\nrelationships I hate to break it to\nyouall a thousand years ago 2,000 years\nago there weren't all these guides from\nDr K about how to get laate or how to go\non a date or how to set boundaries none\nof that that crap existed and people got\nalong what has changed this has changed\nthe activity of this the function of\nthis so if you fix this if you fix your\nsense of identity fix your emotional\nawareness because why do we end up in\nbad relationships because we're not\naware of our emotions when someone\ndoesn't text me back in 5 minutes I get\nangry like I can't regulate that anger\nthere's emotional\ndisregulation there are perception\nproblems we haven't touched on\nperception yet but we talk about it in\nthe guide there's all kinds of problems\nand then we'll have a whole video on sex\nand relationship I mean sex and trauma\ntoo because that's really\nimportant okay\nso complex\nPTSD oh let me show youall one last\nthing I lost it chat\noh\nboy hold\non there's something I got I got to show\nyouall okay this is like very\nimportant uh\nokay I I I can okay here here it\nis so let's talk about treatment okay so\num we talked a little bit teaching uh\nPTSD patients with impair impairments\nand emotional awareness to identify\ntheir affective feelings early on in\ntreatment and make exposure Bas\ntreatments more effective so we need to\nunderstand our emotions um yoga has also\nbeen suggested to be effective in\ntreating PTSD partially by increasing\none's interoceptive ability here's what\nI want to show\nyouall okay\nokay further evidence for the latter\nstems from investigation by hagars who\nreported a differential outcome for PTSD\npatients with high versus low\ndissociative\nsymptomatology okay so remember\ndissociation is hemispheric\nlateralization and remember that\nexposure therapy is often times what we\ndo so let's take a step back and I got\nto explain this I realized talk about\nthis so one of the treatments for PTSD\nis exposure therapy so the reason that\nwe do exposure therapy is if let's say\nthat I'm a war veteran and when I hear a\ndoor slam my brain because I'm\nhyperaroused triggers like we're getting\nbombed exe that's the basic problem in\nPTSD is that we go to war and we hear a\nloud bang and then our brain is like I'm\ngoing to code we're getting bomb. exe\nany time you hear a loud noise\ndive under the\ntable so now as I return back to life I\nwill hear loud noises all the time car\nmuffers going\noff door slamming and now I'm triggering\nwe're getting bomb. exe so we get this\nhyperarousal so one of the ways to fix\nthat is to expose\npeople two things that induce their\ntraumatic hyperarousal response until\nthey climatize to it so as I slam doors\nover and over and over again eventually\nlike my brain will realize oh like we're\ngetting bomb. exe is not appropriate\nhere we don't need to pull this up and\nso exposure therapy is effective okay\nbut this is what's\ncool so whereas only 10% of PTSD\npatients with low dissociative criteria\nsymptoms still met uh PTSD criteria\nafter a trial of exposure therapy\n69% of PTSD patients with high levels of\ndissociation continued to meet PTSD\ncriteria at followup so I'll translate\nthat for you all if y'all didn't catch\nthat if I take someone with PTSD who\ndoes not dissociate and I give\nthem exposure\ntherapy only 10% of them still have\nPTSD so let's presume that 90% of them\nget better if I take someone with a high\namount of dissociation and a diagnosis\nof PTSD and I just give them exposure\ntherapy 69% of them will still have PTS\nso we can conclude not entirely fair\nright CU this is science and you can't\nmake conclusions like that that simple\nexposure therapy doesn't work for people\nwho have high dissociative symptoms if\nyou have complex PTSD you're going to be\nfurther in that direction so let's see\nwhat they\ndiscovered therefore it is crucial\nbefore commencing exposure-based\ntreatments to assess the level of\nemotional over modulation and provide\ninterventions to reduce such symptomatic\nresponses in trauma related stimuli okay\nso basically what this this talks about\nstare which is a trauma treatment\nprogram but basically what I'm trying to\ntell y'all is that see in Western\nmedicine we think that there is a\ndiagnosis and diagnosis has treatment if\nyou've got bipolar disorder take this\nmedication if you've got ADHD take this\nmedication it'll fix it if you've got\nPTSD do exposure therapy it'll fix it\nand we're not wrong to think\nthat because we do trials right and like\nonly 10% of people who had PTSD still\nhave symptoms of it after exposure\ntherapy if they're low on\ndissociation but what I found with\ncomplex PTSD\nespecially is that the more\ncomplex your presentation of difficulty\nis we can call it a diagnosis or we can\ncall it an illness the more that we have\nall of these building blocks\nand the key thing is to build one block\non top of the other and then you can get\nback to 100% most of y'all I've seen it\ntime and time and time again the reason\nthat treatments don't work is because we\ndon't we're not comprehensive\nenough real trauma treatment see trauma\ndoesn't just affect there's not one part\nof the brain that's Mis\nactive your autonomic nervous system\nyour brain different parts of your brain\nsome parts are hyperactive some parts\nare hypo Pro active your sense of self\nyour relationships your motivation your\nability to your impulsivity your ability\nto control your impulses everything is\naffected by trauma this is why trauma is\nthe great\nchameleon so many people I've worked\nwith have a diagnosis of\nADHD but they really have trauma so many\npeople I work with have a diagnosis of\nbipolar disorder but they have trauma\nso trauma can look like just about\nanything\nokay all right so what we're going to do\nnow so don't give up first of all like\nthings can get better and the only\nreason that we don't think they can get\nbetter so put yourself in the shoes of\nsomeone who did exposure therapy they go\nto a psychiatrist the psychiatrist is\nvery well trained and very intelligent\nsays oh you have a diagnosis of PTSD go\nto exposure therapy at the end of\nexposure therapy they're still have PTSD\n69% because this onedimensional\ntreatment is not\neffective in a certain class of people\nit's very effective and this is the way\nthat yall need to approach trauma if\nyou're struggling with\nit it's not just one thing it is not\nfixing a problem it is rebuilding\nyourself from the ground up and you say\nDr K that sounds like too much work it's\nnot see what the only reason it feels\nlike too much work is if you've done a\nlot of work and it has yielded no\nresults then it feels like effort is\nuseless anything feels like too much\nwork if you're doing it wrong is it a\nlot of work absolutely is it hard to do\nabsolutely but my overwhelming\nexperience as a clinician is that people\nare into it once you start making\nprogress once you're able to go to your\nchild's birthday party and be like wow\nI'm so glad they had such a good time\nand I feel like a good parent it's like\nyou guys want that vein like\nthat's like heroin in your veins right\nthere you begin to live the life the way\nthat your evolution is designed you\nfor this is the way we are supposed to\nlive and it's like drinking water after\nrunning five miles it just feels so good\nit's just water people say oh my God I\ndon't like the taste of water or they\ndrink soda all day\nand then they but this is the key thing\nto understand water is whether water\ntastes good to you or not depends on\nwhat your body is\ndoing whether treatment is hard or easy\ndepends on what you're doing what you're\ngetting out of\nit this is the biggest mistake that we\nmake so don't give up hope absolutely go\nsee someone if this stuff resonates with\nyou if you guys want to better\nunderstand these principles check out\nthe guide we're going to watch a video\nin a second right this is not a place\nwhere I would recommend coaching this is\nnot where coaching is that helpful I\nmean it can be for some of these things\nlike paralysis of initiation and\nmotivation and stuff like that but like\nthis is where you all should see a\ntherapist right a trauma informed\nspecialist is ideal because they will\nunderstand more of these\nprinciples\nokay now\nlet's\nsee\num okay so we're g to get to questions\nin a\nsecond I love Leaf flow right so do I\n hey so do I all right\num so like y'all don't seriously don't\ngive up hope like it is crazy how much\nwe know about trauma we've gotten so\nmuch better at this the last thing that\nI want to say is this Disturbed uh sense\nof\nself-organization outside of trauma see\nif you have DSO without the symptoms of\nPTSD you can't get a diagnosis of cptsd\ncptsd is hyperarousal hyper vigilance\nall the regular trauma Stuff Plus the\nDisturbed sense of of self-organization\ndisturbance of self organization so what\nI'm noticing in the world today is that\nthis Disturbed self-organization appears\nto be independent of traumatic\nevents I'm seeing a a society that is\nincreasingly emotionally\ndisregulated increasingly unable to tap\ninto Joy\nincreasingly easy to trigger a seizure\nof negative\nemotion increasingly confused about\ntheir identity in\nlife and increasingly increased\ndifficulty in\nrelationships so now the question that\nI've really wondered is that if you see\nthis DSO\npicture can you do these trauma based\ninterventions you don't need exposure\ntherapy but can we do all of this other\nstuff calm down your nervous\nsystem increase your emotional awareness\narticulate\nemotions improve your sense of identity\nreconnect with your positive self deal\nwith negative emotional\ndisregulation deal with that amigdalar\npseudo\nseizur if we fix all of these things can\nwe improve those DSO symptoms even if\nyou don't have cptsd and that's really\nwhat I\nbelieve right that's the running\nhypothesis cuz I got I got it's too it's\ntoo similar the clinical picture\nare so the overlap is so strong I I\ncan't believe that the same regions of\nthe brain are not active and if the same\nregions of the brain are active we can\ndo the same stuff and if it works for\nsomeone who has such a severe diagnosis\nof cptsd it should work for you and what\nare we talking about here we're talking\nabout yoga we're talking about\nmeditation we're talking about getting\nin touch with your emotions we're\ntalking about articulating your emotions\nwe're talking about developing a sense\nof self we're talking about forming\nnarrative about your\nlife and that's what we see in this\ncommunity because we've been working on\nthis crap for yall this is why I'm so\nthis is why I care so much about the\ntrauma guide because the trauma guide is\nthe guide for our\ncommunity and hopefully it makes sense\nto youall now like where I'm coming from\nyou don't need cptsd the right answer\nfor cptsd is medical\ntreatment but for all of us who have\nfeatures of this\nwho don't have a diagnosis we can still\nunderstand the basic neuroscience and\naddress those\nthings right so the guide is not a\nsubstitute for clinical treatment it is\neverything\nelse and that's what we're going to show\nyou all today so if you\nstruggle\nwith\ninitiation we're going to help\ny'all okay one\nsecond all right so I can't watch this\nI'm going to like literally step out of\nthe room because I\ncannot I cannot handle myself chat this\nis just too much so I'm going to turn\nthis\non um I'm going to turn this\non so we're going to watch an early cut\nand then we're going to do Q&A when I\nget back\nokay next up we're going to talk about\nthe paralysis of initiation and a lot of\npeople that I've worked with have\nstruggled with this this almost seems to\nbe a societal phenomenon where people\nhave trouble getting started we know\ntheoretically that there are other\npeople out there who have goals and they\ncan wake up and they can sort of just do\nit and then they also tell us right like\nif you want to go to the gym what you\nneed to do is just do it you just got to\nput yourself out there and just get\nstarted CU getting started is the hard\npart but there's a large subset of\npeople who struggle with just getting\nstarted and as I explored this concept\nto try to help the patients that I was\nworking with I stumbled into the trauma\nliterature the original paper on complex\nPTSD uses this term paralysis of\ninitiation now complex PTSD is a little\nbit different from traditional PTSD and\nwe're going to dive into that for just a\nsecond so in post-traumatic stress\ndisorder you usually have one or a short\nterm series of traumatic events that\nthen traumatizes us and then we develop\na disorder a psychiatric problem as a\nresult of the intensity of that singular\ntrauma on the other hand there's a group\nof researchers who discovered something\ncalled complex PTSD which is when the\ntraumatic influence is persistent over\ntime so it's not a one-time thing it's\nan environment that you grow up in or\nonce again going back to the prisoners\nof War these are prisoners who are in\nthese camps for years and years and\nyears and what these researchers\ndiscovered is that when a trauma is\nrepeated that it messes up our ability\nto start our own actions it seems to\ntamper with our very autonomy and what\nthey discovered in the prisoners was\nthat these people became incredibly\nlistless because if you kind of think\nabout it there's nothing there's no\npoint in getting anything started in a\nprison camp there's nowhere to go\nthere's there are no goals to accomplish\nit's all about survival and what these\nresearchers discovered is when these\npeople got released from the prison camp\nthey still struggled to initiate things\nin their own lives so we're going to\ndive into that Concept in more detail\nbecause we've learned a lot about it\nsince then the first cause of paralysis\nof initiation is a loss of autonomy and\na lack of reinforcement so let's start\nwith kind of a traditional household\nlet's say a healthy household so in this\nhousehold you have children that kind of\ngrow up and they want to do things they\nhave desires so they go to their parents\nand they say hey I want to go to the zoo\ntoday and so the parents says okay fine\nlike I'll take you to the zoo If the\nchild has an Impulse to start something\nor do something that impulse gets\nreinforced another good example of this\nis let's say I'm like painting a picture\nI made something at school and I come\nhome and I show my parents I say hey\nlook at this picture I painted of the\nfamily and my parents are very very\nimpressed and surprised with it and what\nthey do is they put it up on my fridge\nor they put up put it up on my wall at\nsome point though if you look at a\nhealthy normal household as a child\nstarts to initiate things that\ninitiation is supported and\nreinforced if we look at something like\na controlling household or an abusive\nhousehold the picture is very different\nbecause in a controlling household what\nI want to do is completely irrelevant it\nis what my parents want me to do that\nbecomes important so when I enter the\nfifth grade and I have a choice between\nlearning this instrument or that\ninstrument which instrument I want to\nlearn is not as important as which\ninstrument my parents want me to learn\nand so what we tend to see is that the\nthe behavioral impulses anytime I try to\nstart and do something those aren't\nnecessarily reinforced and instead of\nautonomy I'm sort of taught compliance\nthe same is true but in a slightly\ndifferent way when it comes to\nneglectful households so in the same\nsituation if I come home with a a\npicture that I painted of my family and\nmy parents are absent or there's a\nbabysitter there or for whatever 100\nreasons that could possibly be going on\nsomething about my desires don't get\nreinforced in a neglectful household\nbecause as a child growing up who is it\nthat refor reinforces and supports your\ndesires it's your parents and so even in\nthe case of absent parents we see a\nCommon Thread of when I want to do\nsomething the world around me doesn't\nnecessarily help me do it and in the\nworst case scenarios what we actually\nsee is that if I develop some sense of\nautonomy I actually get punished for it\nif I start to demonstrate initiative\nwhich is one of the other things that we\nsort of see in in the trauma literature\nis that when we take initiative some\npeople will get punished for it so I\ndecided that I wanted to plan a birthday\nparty this weekend with my friends and I\ntell my parents about it on Thursday but\nthen they get really angry with me for\nnot discussing it with them not getting\ntheir permission they're incredibly\ncontrolling so all of my initiative kind\nof goes down the drain it's all about\nwhat other people want so this is the\nfirst cause of the paralysis of\ninitiation is if we look at the normal\nchild development or normal human\ndevelopment at some point our desires\nget reinforced our autonomy gets\nrewarded but if you grew up in an\nenvironment where your autonomy was not\nrewarded where your desires were not\nreinforced that is a lesson that your\nbrain will carry forward the second\naspect of paralysis of initiation has to\ndo with the loss of the future\nDimension I know it sounds kind of weird\nand abstract but it's actually pretty\nsimple so once again as a child let's\nlook at the normal situation so at some\npoint I start thinking about the future\nright if I have present and loving\nparents they'll ask me oh what do you\nwant for Christmas this year let's write\nSanta letter we are going to do\nsomething today that be will be rewarded\nnot just tomorrow but a week from now\ntwo weeks from now three weeks from now\nsimilarly supportive parents will take a\nlook at your schedule for the week and\nsort of even if you're in the second\ngrade or third GR they will sort of\nremind you or help you understand that\nokay this week you have these two\nassignments to complete so we need to\nstart thinking about tomorrow or even\nthe end of the week today so with\nhealthy parenting it's kind of bizarre\nbut we have this part of our brain that\nlooks into the future and plans and\nexecutes tasks this is the frontal lobe\nof our brain that kind of plans things\nout and makes sure they get done in a\nnormal household this is a part of our\nbrain that gets supported by our parents\nbut once again once we move to a\ncontrolling or a neglectful household\nthat all goes out the window so the\nfirst thing is planning for my future\nwhen I have controlling parents is a\nwaste of time because my parents have\ndecided what my future will be in the\nworst case scenarios like so for example\nin my culture there are some traditional\nIndian parents that will plan everything\nfor their kids you're going to be a\ndoctor you're going to be a lawyer I had\nthat conversation with my own dad when I\nwas 9 years old he said we took me and\nmy brother aside I was nine my brother\nwas 12 and he said said one of y'all is\ngoing to be a doctor and one of y'all is\ngoing to be a lawyer and then I ended up\napplying to med school and people asked\nme like why do you want to be a doctor\nand I said well this is the conversation\nmy dad had with me and my brother was\nolder so he got to choose first and he\nwent to law school so here I am and we\nall had a good laugh about it but I\nnever really answered the question the\npoint though is that with controlling\nparents who sort of determine your\nfuture for you they tell you what you\nneed to accomplish they tell you when\nyou need to accomplish it you're going\nto learn the cello you're going to learn\nthe vi you're going to do a sport you're\ngoing to do this you're going to do that\nor you're going to carry on in your\nFather's Footsteps and you're going to\nplay football whatever the situation is\nyour sense of the future gets negatively\nimpacted you don't get to think about\nthe future and plan for the future on\nyour own and the same is true in\nneglectful households although once\nagain slightly differently because in\nthis case if you're a seven-year-old kid\nand your parents are absent there's no\npoint in planning for a slumber party in\nthe future and remember that as kids we\ndon't really know how to plan for the\nfuture ourselves we actually need adults\nto teach us how to really use our\nfrontal loes they sort of train us to do\nall of these things in addition to like\nwalking and talking and doing laundry\nand all of these tasks that parents\nteach us are also affected in a\nneglectful household so this is the\nsecond thing that happens is that when\nwe sort of think about the future\ndimension in a healthy household\nthinking about the future Dimension is\nrewarded if if I make a Christmas list\nfor Santa I actually get those presents\nif I plan for a slumber party this\nweekend the slumber party actually\nhappens but in the case of controlling\nabusive or neglectful households this\nplanning for the future does not get\nreinforced sometimes it just becomes\nneglected so I don't get rewarded for\nthinking about the future but in the\nharshest cases I actually get punished\nso since I have all these plans of I\nwant this for Christmas or I want my\nfriends to come over this weekend but on\nwhen Friday rolls around my parent is\nhas been drinking and they don't feel\nlike having kids in the house so they\ntell me to call all my friends and\ncancel at the last minute and then I'm\nleft with disappointing all of my\nfriends and so in the most drastic cases\nwe actually get punished for thinking\nabout the future and this is the problem\nin each of these scenarios is that over\ntime in in the simplest case these parts\nof our brain are not reinforced we don't\nhave behavioral reinforcement of Desire\nwe don't have positive reinforcement for\nplanning of the future and in the worst\ncases we actually get punished for doing\nthese things because if you kind of\nthink about it let's say I have a desire\nand then since my parents are neglectful\nI make this Christmas list but then no\npresents show up on Christmas Day what\nis the lesson I learn as a child over\ntime the lesson I'll learn is it's\nbetter not to have desires in the first\nplace because then I won't be\ndisappointed so it's it's better to just\nnot want anything at all it's better to\nnot try to do anything it's better to\nput forth no effort whatsoever because\nat the end of the day I'm living my life\nreactively I have no sense of autonomy\nor control and if I try to exert control\nif I am stupid enough to want things\nthen that will actually hurt and lead to\ndisappointment and then you learn a very\ndangerous lesson which is wanting things\nand thinking about the future is painful\nand harmful and once you learn this\nlesson this leads to the paralysis of\niniti ation later in life now there's\nanother challenge that we kind of run\ninto that keeps people who grow up in\nthese kinds of environments from really\ninitiating things and that is a Reliance\non perfectionism so there's a group of\npeople that I've worked with and this\ngroup by the way is becoming\nincreasingly common because once again a\nlot of people grow up in scenarios like\nthis where they can't get started until\nit's perfect so I'm not going to apply\nto college unless I know I can get into\nHarvard I'm not going to take this\ncourse unless I know I can get an A I'm\nnot going to even learn any skill until\nI practice ahead of time even before I\njoin the course so if I'm learning how\nto dance I'm going to spend three months\npracticing at home so I don't embarrass\nmyself when I join the class that is\neven for novices so there are a lot of\npeople out there that are very hesitant\nto get started until things are perfect\nand let's explore a little bit about why\nthis happens so this too can be tracked\nback to trauma so if we sort of think\nabout controlling abusive or neglectful\nhouseholds these households create\nsituations that are very stressful and\ndangerous for the child so in order to\nunderstand why some people become very\nperfectionistic and why some people can\nafford to take risks we have to\nunderstand a very important Divergence\nthat happens very early in life so let's\nstart with the case of a healthy\nhousehold so if you sort of think about\nit the world is objectively a dangerous\nplace for kids so if I'm like let's say\nan 18-month-old kid one-year-old kid\n2-year-old kid the world is a dangerous\nplace I I can barely walk I tend to\nstumble a lot things like stairs can be\nincredibly dangerous but it's not just\nthat it's also things like when I get\nserved food does the food burn me or not\nand this is where parents come in\nbecause parents who are very attentive\nwill protect the child from the\ndangerous world and this is like kind of\nwhat we know if you're a parent you'll\nunderstand this that your children will\ntry all kinds of things to hurt\nthemselves because they don't really\nknow that the world is a dangerous place\nand the better you take care of them the\nmore Reckless they become because there\nare never negative consequences for\nthings a parent who's always caught when\nthey jump off the bed will not learn the\ndanger of gravity so these children\nbecome very secure in the world around\nthem because it's a safe place because\nmom or dad is there to protect me from\ndanger so these children become more\nconfident they're able to embrace more\nrisks they can try new things and they\nalso enjoy exploring the world they're\nvery very confident that someone is out\nthere protecting them they're not really\naware that there's a person out there\nprotecting them they just know that as\nthey stumble around someone's always\ncatching them and they don't get hurt on\nthe flip side let's look at something\nlike a neglectful household so in this\ncase now the world becomes a dangerous\nplace because there isn't a parent\npaying attention if I slip and fall no\nis even watching as I start climbing up\nthe stairs and on my seventh stair since\nI'm like a 13-month-old kid I Stumble\nand fall and then I roll down the stairs\nand start crying in the worst case\nscenarios even when I start crying\neither the parent doesn't pay attention\ndoesn't care or even will get mad at me\nfor crying and will tell me to be quiet\nso if we see households that are\nincredibly controlling which also can be\nsort of scary for a child because in a\ncontrolling household with very\ndemanding parents we want our children\nto be perfect right don't spill don't\nplay with this you made a mess this\nhappened this happened this happened so\nvery controlling parents will be very\nangry with their children for not being\nperfect abusive households also lead to\na Reliance on perfectionism because\nusually what the child learns when it\ncomes to abuse is there is a magical\nformula to avoid the abuse If the child\ncan be kind enough if the child can be\nsweet enough if the child can be cute\nenough or pretty enough Demir enough\ninvisible enough sometimes these\nchildren can sort of figure out almost\nfrom a survival mechanism that if I have\nan abusive parent there are some days\nthat the parent is not abusive and so\nthen the child naturally tries to figure\nout what is the difference between the\nabusive day and the non-abusive day and\nthis is when they start to develop this\nidea that if I'm a perfect child then I\nwill be safe and so perfectionism and\nsafety go hand in hand so if you try to\ndo something in the outside world and\nyou not perfect remember that this stuff\ngets baked in to your upbringing in the\nsame way that you were understanding how\nstrong gravity is or what the sun feels\nlike or how many fingers you have this\nstuff gets really baked in and\nperfectionism and safety become one and\nthe same so this is another reason why\npeople struggle with initiating tasks\nthey can be very very afraid of doing\nsomething wrong they can't afford to\nmake mistakes and they need to be\nperfect before they get started and why\nis this it's because the world that they\nsee does not allow them to make mistakes\nthat if they make some kind of slip up\nand if they screw up in some kind of way\nthe world is a fundamentally dangerous\nscary and punishing place and if we are\nwired in any one of these three ways if\nour desires and our autonomy has not\nbeen reinforced if our capacity to plan\nfor the future has actually been\nsquashed or neglected or we grew up in\nan environment Enon where we had to be\nperfect before we get started all three\nof these can result in the paralysis of\ninitiation all\nrighty\nso all right hold on a\nsecond\num yeah so that's that's a\nuh that's one of the videos from the\ntrauma guide and like I said like we\nwe've been working on this for a while\nand and when I was making the trauma\nguide\ny'all can hear me right am I muted okay\nno y'all can hear me\num you know I I was thinking about like\nus and like what are the things that we\nstruggle with and it's not and there's\nAbsolut like clinically significant\nstuff and I was also thinking about like\nyou know if I could take all of my\npatients who have diagnoses of some kind\nof trauma or a history of\ntrauma and I could like give them a\nworkshop\nfor not stuff that we do in the office\nlike nothing about I mean there's stuff\nabout medication and treatment and stuff\nlike that too but like not that stuff\nbut like all the other dimensions of\ntheir life like how do you find a\nrelationship when you have a history of\ntrauma um how do you reconnect with\nyourself and these are the kinds of\nthings that like you know are not\nspecific to a person this is the common\nstuff that I would teach to my\npatients um which isn't technically like\na part of their diagn I mean it's part\nof their diagnosis I guess but it's it's\nlike I don't know how to describe it\nit's\nnot you know it's not about this\nrelationship that this person has it's\nabout the\nprinciple of why is it hard for this\ngroup of people to form\nrelationships um\nokay yeah so let's do some Q&A so we've\ngot time for we wanted to save some time\nfor Q&A so we've got I know we've like\nrun long and we're at like 2:30 and we\nstarted late but let's do Q&A for about\n15 minutes uh can you answer super chat\nquestions I I I don't know I don't know\nhow to do that\num okay so there's one question\nhere uh since trauma is the great\nchameleon what is your opinion on when\nyou disagree with your therapist about\nyour presentation belief in oneself is\nimportant for Recovery yet they are a\nprofessional um\nokay I'm going to ask if we have mods if\ny'all saw good questions if anyone was\nkeeping trap can y'all let me know\nvia uh you know some method of\ncommunication just let me\nknow\num okay so what if you disagree with\nyour therapist this is a great\nquestion so how do you go\nabout how do you if your therapist\ndisagrees or if you disagree with your\ntherapist about your diagnosis or the\nformulation like what do you do about\nthat right they're the one with the\ndegree but you're the one who's living\nthe\nlife so this is where I'd\nsay disagreement in therapy is like not\nsomething to be avoided the whole point\nof therapy is that we don't know what\nthe right answer is when we get started\nand finding the right answer is a series\nof like re-calibrating after\novershooting or moving in the wrong\ndirection like that's what therapy is so\nyour therapist doesn't magically know\nwhat's going on with you we have the\nfirst layer of information and then we\nmake some conclusions and then we have\nthe second layer of information we we\nWhittle away some of the conclusions and\nthen over time we want to kind of like\npingpong our way like to what the right\nanswer is that's been my experience as a\npsychiatrist\nso if you disagree with your therapist I\nthink first of all that's totally fine\nsecondly I would ask I would ask the\ntherapists to explain why they believe\nwhat they believe so walk me through\nyour\nreasoning and then what you want to\noffer\nis your own reasoning so let me\nunderstand why you have your opinion let\nme now explain to you why I think that's\ngood or not good or what my perspective\nis and chances are neither of you is\ngoing to be 100% right and then the\nquestion is what can your therapist take\naway from your explanation that moves\nyou closer to the right answer and what\ncan you take away from your therapist's\nanswer that moves you closer to the\nright\nanswer now a lot of therapists myself\nincluded find\nthat having a patient understand what's\ntruly going on is not going to happen\nfast so I often times find that when I\nexplain things to patients or when I\noffer a formulation at the very\nbeginning they will sometimes very\nstrongly disagree with something that\nI'm very confident in and usually over\ntime we get there right because you have\nto remember that as a\npatient you have more information about\nyour life but you're not as\nobjective so that's where it's like and\nyou know medical doctors therapists\npsychiatrists we get diagnoses like\nwrong all the\ntime so I you know I there's all kinds\nof stuff that we get wrong so I I I\nthink it's more about the process than\nit is about like being right or wrong so\nthere's try to really understand where\nthey're coming from and I I try to take\nthat to heart right really try to be\nopen-minded and try to see if you can\nunderstand okay how even though I\ninstinctively react to this being\nincorrect\nthere's a possibility that if I change\nmy thinking in some ways this could be\ncorrect so let me try to do that right\nso the last thing I'd kind of say is\nSteelman instead of straw man their\nargument I mean it shouldn't be an\nargument but do your best to alter your\nassumptions to see if you can understand\nwhere they're coming\nfrom good question\nokay um now let's go to\nthere we\ngo okay questions\num trauma guide I think comes out at the\nend of the\nmonth\nuh okay a cptsd and ADHD there seems to\nbe a lot of overlap how do you tell the\ndifference between the two if you have\nboth I think you mentioned in another\nvideo something about how all kids with\nADHD end up with some trauma if that's\ntrue how do we know comes from ADHD\nversus what comes from cptsd it's a\ngreat\nquestion so if you've got ADHD and\nTrauma how do you know what's\nwhat so there are a couple of different\nthings to keep in mind the first thing\nthat we have to remember is that\npsychiatric diagnoses are not real\nthings they are abstractions or human\nConcepts to try to understand reality\nso like when I say someone has major\ndepressive disorder there's absolutely\nsome kind of biological mechanism but\nhuman beings made up the idea of major\ndepressive disorder what psychiatric\ndiagnosis really is is a bunch of human\nbeings observe real things in other\nhuman beings and then we try to come up\nwith a language that\nunifies what we see in individuals and\nthat's really what a psychiatric\ndiagnosis is\nso how can you tell the difference\nbetween what's ADHD and what's PTSD or\ncptsd so both of these can result in\nimpairment in concentration or attention\nboth of them can result in impulsivity\nboth of them can result in emotional\ndisregulation how can we tell the\ndifference so a lot of what we know\nabout ADHD is from a neurodiverse\nperspective we know that their brains\ndevelop in a slightly different way so\nwe know that people with ADHD have\nless their frontal loes have less\ncontrol over their impulses in their\nemotions so people with ADHD are more\nlikely to get emotionally disregulated\nand we can track that back to the\nconnections in their brain so our\nfrontal loes are the brakes and they can\ncontrol and re in other parts of our\nbrain but people with ADHD have breakes\nthat seem to be weaker and there's some\nkind of genetic component to this some\nkind of the way that your brain is\nwired now things get complicated because\ngrowing up in a neurotypical society as\nsomeone who is neurodiverse results in\nusually some level of trauma so if you\nlook at comorbid ADHD and major\ndepressive disorder what you find is 3%\nof people who have major depressive\ndisorder will grow up to have\nADHD but 70 % of people who have ADHD\nwill grow up to have major depressive\ndisorder this is in within a comorbid\npopulation so there is absolutely a\npositive impact of ADHD on depression\nand the reason for that is because when\nyou're\nneurodiverse and people just tell you to\ntry harder but your brain can't do that\nyou start to believe something is wrong\nwith you you don't have as much\nself-esteem people don't since you cut\nin line you don't get invited to\nbirthday Pary you have fewer friends\nbecause you can't wait your turn and all\nof these there's consequences of\nuntreated ADHD that will end up\ntraumatizing so at that point we've kind\nof got both now this also gets confusing\nbecause there are a lot of features of\nPTSD like emotional disregulation\ndifficulty cont\nconcentrating so how can you tell the\ndifference so there are a couple of\ndifferent things to keep in mind the\nfirst is that it's not so important to\nreally tease it out\nbecause many of the things that we will\ndo to fix one we would do to fix the\nother anyway so simple example is\nmeditation right so meditation is a\nuseful treatment for PTSD cptsd\nborderline personality disorder and ADHD\nthere are some specifics about the kind\nof meditation which you kind of need to\nunderstand but generally speaking the\ntreatment is going to be the same\ndealing with shame whether it comes from\nADHD or PTSD is going to be the not the\nsame but there's it's in the same\nballpark let's put it that way so the\ntreatments for the two will overlap\nquite a bit the third thing is emotional\ndisregulation that needs to be improved\nin both right so this is where the first\nthing to keep in mind is it is not\nnecessary to perfectly tease these two\napart before we\nintervene and this is something that we\nlearn in clinical medicine right so when\nyou become a psychiatrist you learn this\nif you're not sure what the diagnosis is\nlean into a treatment that treats both\noptions so ssris does this person have a\nanxious depression or do they have an\nanxiety disorder with an adjustment\ndisorder laid on top who knows in either\ncase ssris will treat both so if we're\ngoing to start with something let's\nstart with an SSRI so the treatments can\noverlap now there are a couple of places\nwhere the treatments don't overlap so\nfor example things like stimulant\nmedication and that's where it is\nimportant so we can do things like\nneuropsychological testing right we can\noffer formal testing to detect the\ndeficits of\nADHD um we can also offer like you know\ndiagnostic scales of trauma and things\nlike that and so like we can we can\ntease things apart in some way but I I'd\nsay that practically you know I've\ntreated a lot of people where we're not\nsure like what is causing what and\nthat's where like as a clinician what we\ndo is okay like so if I think your\ndiagnoses are ADHD and PTSD we can start\nsomewh on stimulant\nmedication and then we see right what\npart of this does this fix so if more of\nit is trauma oriented we would not\nexpect ADHD medication to be that\neffective at improving things so over\ntime it's like it's like a process right\nand that's why we we really emphasize\nthat you should work with a clinician\nthe advantage of working with a\nclinician is that they will collect more\ninformation over time and you will\nrefine your diagnosis and you absolutely\ncould both great\nquestion okay\nnext\num okay I'm going to see a therapist for\nthe first time soon do you have any\nadvice it's hard for me to open up and\ntalk about myself or how I feel\nemotionally so here's my advice if\nyou're going to a therapist for the\nfirst\ntime so remember that the therapist has\na job\nand their job is to do their job so you\ndon't need to be great at opening up you\ndon't have to talk about yourself\nemotionally it is their job to make you\nfeel comfortable enough to where you\nopen up whether you kind of want to or\nnot second thing to keep in mind is that\nsuccess in therapy is a skill so the\nfirst time that you go ice skating I\nwouldn't expect you to know how to ice\nskate in the same way going to therapy\nis something that you will get better at\novertime so there are some patients that\nI've worked with where like I like one\nof the things that I'll put in their\nformulation and something that I'll let\nthem know is that I think you utilize\ntherapy very well right so people will\nget better at it so my advice would be\nthe most important part is showing\nup and then follow their lead and let\nthem know what you're looking for let\nthem know what works for you and what\ndoesn't work for you it's totally fine\nto even tell them hey I I have\ndifficulty opening up and talking about\nmy emotions that's totally fair game\nright so that's their job to help you\nget better at\nthat\nokay\num what tactic would you take to heal\ncptsd mixed with moral injury from a\nspecific event I'm confused about what\nmoral injury from a specific event\nis um what's the relationship between\ncptsd addiction and sense of\nworthlessness so let's talk about\nthat so the first thing to understand\nabout trauma and addiction is that tra\naddiction is not a problem it is a\nsolution so human beings get addicted to\nthings for a couple of reasons so you\ncan absolutely make a genetic argument\nwhere there's a very strong you know\nvulnerability and once you get a taste\nlike the first drop of alcohol and\nyou're hooked I've absolutely seen that\nbut for a lot of people addictions are\nsolutions before they become problems so\naddictions give pleasure and take away\npain and the problem with cptsd is that\nremember we have emotional\ndisregulation we have difficulty so\nthere's two parts there's two ways that\npeople with with trauma have difficulty\nwith their emotions the first is that\ntheir negative emotions in the more\nprimitive parts of their brain this is\nplaces like the the\nthese are the part parts of our brain\nthat experience fear anxiety things like\nthat those are very itchy they've got\nitchy trigger fingers so they can\ntrigger very easily and very\nintensely F that's the first emotional\ndeficit second emotional problem that\npeople with trauma have is that their\nsense of self often times carries with\nit a lot of Shame and guilt and stuff\nlike that so this isn't like fear of the\noutside world this is a persistent\nemotional negative state that I carry\nwith me that's actually a different part\nof the brain it relates more to the\ndefault mode\nNetwork these are emotions that are\ncalled social cognitive emotions so we\nhave two types of emotions we have our\nprimitive emotions like anger and fear\nthat even reptiles experience and then\nwe have a different part of our brain\nthat has our social cognitive emotions\nPride guilt shame you can't have those\nemotions without a social component I\nfeel proud when people look at me I feel\nashamed when people look at me it\nrequires\nsocialization so the people with PTSD\nhave difficulty with that as well the\nthird thing that people with PTSD\nstruggle with is feeling positive\nemotions these come from a completely\ndifferent region of the brain the dorsal\nmedial prefrontal cortex so this is\nstuff like excitement love curiosity\npeople with trauma feel kind of like\nnumbed out right so it's kind of like\nthe real tragedy is you feel numbed out\nin terms of\npositivity but you're you've got a very\nitchy brain and it's easy to activate\nsome of these negative emotions so where\ndoes Addiction come in addiction fixes\nall three right so if we look at things\nlike benzo aines these are treatments\nfor anxiety and we developed benzo\ndiazines by recognizing that\nalcohol alleviates people's anxiety so\nwe developed a pill that basically\nactivates the same receptor as alcohol\nkind of chills you out right so we know\nwe can treat anxiety with certain\npsychoactive\nsubstances next thing that uh\npsychoactive substances do is they will\nnumb us right so this is also through\nthe Gaba receptor like alcohol but there\nare other ways that they will sort of\nmake us forget ourselves that critical\nself dialogue that is always running in\nour head goes away when we get high for\nexample so they alleviate our negative\nemotions the Third thing that they help\nus do is feel positive emotions so it's\neasier to feel like we're having a good\ntime we're vibing we're relaxing we're\nchilling we're partying things like MDMA\nor ecstasy can help us feel connected to\nother people right so if we really look\nat it the reason that trauma and drugs\noverlap so heavily is because drugs and\naddictions fix the problems of trauma\nbut only temporarily so we also see this\nwith with things like people who have a\nhistory of trauma and have diagnoses of\nborderline personality disorder will\nengage with things like Pro promiscuous\nBehavior intense unstable relationships\nto help feel loved right because when\nI'm head over heels in love with someone\nI can feel better about myself so we see\nthat if we look at the Neuroscience of\nemotional challenges with PTSD we see\nthat addictions actually like fix all\nthree of those so there's a very high\noverlap the problem is that the fix from\nan addiction is temporary and over time\nwill get objectively\nworse great\nquestion\num\nokay how would you heal Trauma from\nhaving been in an incubator for a long\ntime as a b baby I have no clue I mean\nthat's really interesting there's a lot\nof like interesting data about you know\nper\nnatal and and post birth like stuff and\ncorrelations with things like learning\ndisabilities and stuff like that I've\nnever I don't think I've ever seen a\nclinical case where like we thought that\nthe trauma originated at the level of an\nincubator but it's a very interesting\nquestion I'm not saying it can't have an\nimpact um really interesting question I\ndon't have an answer to that one\nuh\nokay is there a significant difference\nbetween someone who developed cptsd\nbecause of one of those three household\nStyles versus someone who developed\ncptsd from a\ncombination um especially if all three\nsituations are yeah so I think the\nanswer is basically yes\nso here's the here's the thing to\nunderstand about trauma so we know about\ntrauma is that trauma shapes you and we\nknow that the way that it shapes you\ncauses problems later in life that's how\nwe Define trauma so negative events\nshape us all the time but if it doesn't\ncause a negative impact we don't\ndiagnose someone with like PTSD so\nthere's research on things like\npost-traumatic growth where you can go\nthrough something traumatic and you can\nend up\npositive now this is where like this is\nwhy I think the treatment of trauma is\nfun right so like I find it clinically\nenjoyable I know it's kind of weird to\nsay but like I find it intellectually\nengaging I find I have a lot of\ncompassion I find a lot of like growth\nand it gives me like positivity to see\npeople overcome their trauma so I find\nthe experience to be very like enjoyable\ngratifying um and what we know is that\nthe way in which you're busted will\nshape the way you're busted right so\nlike if you have a combination of\ndifferent traumatic things that can\nresult in like something new or\nsomething different or a combination of\nthe above now I don't know that one is\nnecessarily worse than the other but we\nabsolutely see like nuances of each of\nthese manifestations and that's very\ncommon um and so then it's just an issue\nof like seeing which manifestation is\ncommon when\nso like learning to think about the\nfuture again like we want to do that and\nwe want to learn how to like reward our\nautonomy like we can do all of the above\nit's not either\nor so what if I don't have the safety to\nwant to calm down I wouldn't be as safe\nanymore if I were calm so that's a very\ncommon experience of people who have\nbeen traumatized so if you look at uh\nresearch on\ntrauma what we find is that the most\nimportant thing for healing trauma is\nsafety so we don't talk about this much\nas clinicians when we lecture about\ntrauma but basically we know that like\nphysical safety and even to a certain\ndegree emotional safety is very very\nimportant so the first step to treating\nany trauma is not emotions or anything\nlike that is actually physical safety\nthat's number one and the reason for\nthat is very simple if you're not\nphysically safe your hypothalamus will\nbe pumping out something called CR CR is\ncorticotropin releasing\nhormone the CR will go to your your\npituitary glands and will release act so\nyour pituitary will pump out act which\nwill cause your adrenal cortices to pump\nout cortisol as long as your you have\ncortisol and other kinds of sympathetic\nnervous system or stress hormones\nfloating through your system you cannot\nrewire and you cannot heal like\nphysiologically it is very difficult to\ndo so if we look at the role of these\nstress hormones stress hormones aren't\nabout picking up the pieces they're\nabout surviving and getting through the\nday so what you find in people who have\nan experience of trauma who don't feel\nsafe and aren't safe is that is very\nhard to work on the trauma because their\nbrain is is not in a neuroplastic state\nso let's understand this\nokay so our brain develops or becomes\nincreasingly neuroplastic when we sleep\nso if we look at like memory\nconsolidation we have short-term memory\nand we have long-term memory our\nshort-term memory which is kind of like\nour Ram gets Rewritten into our\nlong-term memory which is kind of like\nour hard drive when we sleep so we do\nthis process of memory consolidation\nthis involves a lot of neuroplasticity\nbecause we're forming new\nmemories now if we look at\nsleep stress hormones impede sleep so\nsleep is when we build a lot of tissues\nand grow a lot of neuron I mean we don't\ngrow too many neurons but bdnf increases\nbrain derived neurotrophic factor I\nthink increases in sleep as well so our\nbrain rewires when we\nsleep when we're stressed out we it runs\nagainst the sleeping signals so we have\nthese Pro sleep states where we our\nbrain does things like rewire heal and\nlearn and then we have these anti-sleep\nstates which is like survive stay awake\nand\nsurvive and so we absolutely need safety\nas part of the healing process so I\nthink the first step to Healing trauma\nis creating\nsafety now that becomes a little bit\ntricky because sometimes because of our\nthe nature of our hyperarousal and the\nway our nervous system is wired the lack\nof safety is not quite as external as we\nthink it is I'm not saying it isn't I\nmean there people who are in abusive\nhouseholds where it's unsafe objectively\nbut the the tricky thing about trauma is\nthat we carry that lack of safety within\nus so there's a balance between creating\nexternal safety and even when you create\nexternal safety it's not like internally\nyou'll feel safe right away so there's a\nprocess of of letting yourself rewire to\nfeeling safe as well great question\nwe're going to take one\nmore\num when I was born I was left crying for\ntwo hours in an incubator before someone\nheld me and took me to my mother I blame\nmy constant anxiety for\nthis so that level of specificity I\ndon't really like have much comment on I\nwould feel feel very very surprised to\nlearn\nthat that singular event is responsible\nfor a persistent adult\ncondition would be very\nsurprised so the the other thing that we\nknow is that isolated events in\nchildhood kids are quite\nresilient so like the the cool thing\nabout kids is that even if they go\nthrough a traumatic experience it is\nvery common for them to bounce back and\nthat's because like kids are their brain\nis very neuroplastic even their body is\nquite changeable right so like kids have\ntheir neurons can still grow in ways\nthat adults can't they can create new\nneurons most of what happens is pruning\nbut you know so like the their healing\ncapacity is way bigger because they're\nlike not in read only mode they're still\nin right mode so that like a lot of them\ncan children can heal very easily um so\nI'd be surprised I'm not saying it's not\npossible that's something to work\nthrough with a\nclinician um interesting thank you for\nsharing\num do we know if EMDR is effective for\ncptsd I personally think it is but\nthere's a lot of controversy around\nEMDR and we don't have many studies on\nwhat's effective for cptsd\nuh so my problem has been so good at\nmasking my cptsd that they don't find\nthe issue any tips as to opening up yeah\nI'd start with the body right that's why\nwe kind of talked about that like so I\ndon't know if this kind of makes sense\nbut the way that we've outlined our\napproach to trauma and especially in the\nguide the reason it's built that\nway is because we have gotten these\nquestions over and over and over and I\nhave this problem I have this problem I\nhave this problem I have this problem\nwhat about this what about this what\nabout this what about this what about\nthis what about this what about this so\nwhat we did is took all those questions\nand say okay if we take all of these\nquestions how can we understand trauma\nthat accounts for all of these so why do\nwe have a video about paralysis of\ninitiation and impulsivity because we\nrecognize that there's an overlap\nbetween the symptomatology of ADHD and\nTrauma we recognize that people with\ntrauma have difficulties that feel like\nADHD so that's in there we recognize\nthat people have difficulty opening up\nwe recognize that people have difficulty\nfeeling their emotions that's why we\nstart with the\nbody right and that's why relationships\nis at the very\nend so start with the\nbody\nokay um\nhow do I bring up cptsd up to my\ntherapist I resonated with this topic a\nlot but I feel like it's not my place to\ninitiate the conversation there it is\nright so\nlike I can\nsay it's absolutely your place to\ninitiate the conversation that's your\njob that's why you're going right you're\ngoing for your benefit not the therapist\nbenefit if it helps you by all means\nbring it up that doesn't work though\nright so one of the manifestations of\ncptsd is you feel like it's not your\nplace you feel like deferring to the\nother person you feel like following\nsomeone else's\nlead see when we don't have a\nwell-formed sense of identity we don't\nfeel like we deserve very much it's not\nmy\nplace when it's absolutely your place\nlike that's the definition of your place\nthe the reason the therapy is the one\nplace where you get to go for you and\nfor no one else so whatever you want is\nfair game\nright I within reason it's like the the\ntherapist can say\nno but it's very common so notice that\nnotice that your desire to not even\nbring it up or your feeling that that's\nnot my place to bring it up could be a\nmanifestation of the very problem itself\nand just notice that and then try your\nbest to bring it\nup right you can even share so one last\ntechnique that I'll give you all is if\nyou're having so this is like Pro\ntechnique and therapy okay\nso sometimes we feel embarrassed\nbringing something up because there's a\nlot of emotional energy here there's\nshame there's guilt there's like oh my\nGod this kind of kinky thing kind of\nturns me on and like oh my God I have\nthese kind of\nthoughts and so we have difficulty like\ntackling that emotion and being\nvulnerable so instead what I want youall\nto do is go one layer above\nit so what you can say to your therapist\nis there's something that I feel ashamed\nof that I don't feel comfortable\nbringing up with you so you go meta\nright so you're not bringing up the\nthing you're saying this thing is hard\nfor\nme and then even if that's too hard you\ncan go one level above I want to bring\nsomething up with you I want to bring up\nthat I'm scared to talk about something\nbut even that's hard to talk about so\nwhat we want to do is move away from the\nemotion and put that out there right say\nlike even one step removed you don't\nhave to talk about the shameful thing\nthere's something that I'm ashamed of\nthat I don't want to talk about you can\njust say\nthat and then it's the therapist job to\ntake over like that's what we're good at\nright that's what we're trained for\nwe're trained to help you do\nthat and even when we're like so is a\nthere's a good technique in therapy\ncalled going mattera right so and and\nthat's when when there's something like\nso if someone says like hey I'm like I'm\nhere for therapy I want to focus on this\nbut I don't want to talk about this and\nso what do we do in therapy we don't say\nokay okay screw you we're going to talk\nabout that anyway because you don't want\nto talk about it no what we do is help\nme understand why you don't want to talk\nabout it totally fine we don't have to\ntalk about it just can you give me a\nlittle bit of\ncontext\ncool and then you can bring it up later\nso then it's your therapist job to get\nthere if you want to talk about it you\ncan say hey I want to talk about this\nthing but I'm too embarrassed and I'm\ngoing to shut\ndown okay\num how do I explain my cptsd to a family\nmember that has expressed that she wants\nto help but doesn't really understand\nthe gravity of my\nissues honestly like I'd send them this\nvideo right so one thing that's starting\nto\nhappen is that people are starting to\nshare some of our content like not for\nthemselves but like they're like you\nknow we we had video about autism and\ngender identity we had a video about\nrelationships with BPD with people with\nborderline personality disorder we've\nhad and so we're seeing a lot of like\nsharing going on so you know a lot of\npeople struggle to convey what we convey\ndon't convey it just share and like I I\ndon't know if yall get this I cannot\nremember the last time I know that like\nall content creators are like hey if you\nlike the video like subscribe and share\nshare I can't remember the last time I\ncan't remember I mean I've done it\nbefore right so maybe on like like why\nmen the male suicide or why therapy\nsucks for men there are a couple of\nvideos that we've done lectures we've\ndone streams that we've done where I've\nasked yall to share things I don't ask\nyall to share things\nlike you know sure it helps us but like\nthat's not we're not here for us we're\nhere for you and that's why I don't ask\nyall to like subscribe or share\nthe only time I ask youall to do it is\nwhen I think it benefits you or someone\nelse who may need help so this is one of\nthe rare times where I would say the\nwhole reason we do this and we store\nthese is so that y'all can share it with\nother people so like if you don't know\nlike if like let's say you watch a video\nabout BPD and you realize holy crap I\ncould have BPD this is what it's like to\nbe in my shoes I think you should\nabsolutely share that with someone who\nyou're in a relationship with and be\nlike H this person kind of explains what\nmy experience is like in a way that I\ncan't quite explain\nit right or something about addiction or\nwhatever like if you're if you're a\ngifted kid and your parents tell you\nthat you have all the potential in the\nworld and if you just tried harder send\nthem more gifted kids a special needs\nvideo right so we're here as a resource\nfor your benefit that does not just mean\nyou you're you're the only one that can\nhas to watch us so if we explain a\nconcept in a way that it would be useful\nfor someone in your life to understand\nthen you should share our videos but\nonce again that's not so that we can\nincrease our views by 0.001% that is\nbecause it benefits you that's why you\nshould share or if it benefits someone\nelse make sense\nwould you consider Spanish subtitles I\nthink we're working on\nit\num oh what a beautiful question so we're\nat time for the day but I'm going to\nleave yall with one last question that I\nlove uh there's two questions man these\nare so so best meditation for trauma\nwe're past time so I don't have time or\nenergy to do meditation today for which\nI apologize but in the trauma guide\nwe've got hold on a second let me tell\ny'all we have a whole new stock of\nmeditations oh here oh damn it I just\nrealized that people are telling\nme\num these are so\ngood okay we're going to answer one\nquick one one question then we're going\nto try to speed run a couple more so\nfirst thing is um what was I talking\nabout I don't even remember brain death\nis setting in um oh meditations so we\nhave we have a bunch of meditations let\nme\ncount uh so we have at I think about 10\nmeditations okay no one is an overview\none two one two 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 there's\n11 meditations in the trauma guide\num so definitely check those out I think\nthey're great they'll build on the\nexisting meditations that we've taught\nyou all and I just ran into Will trauma\never go away quick answer to that\none possibly actually so we know that we\nknow that like a lot of people will heal\nfrom trauma without any overt\nintervention so the cool thing is like\nif you look at the body like the body\nand brain like heal that's what we're\ndesigned to do so the short answer is\nit's very possible that you don't need\nto do a damn thing and you'll just just\nit'll fix itself or your relationships\nwill organically fix\nit I wouldn't adopt that strategy\nthough\num there's another question of how do we\naddress the sources of trauma out in the\nworld and who is responsible for doing\nso that's a lovely question I love it\nlove it love it love it love it it's Way\nBeyond the scope of what we have time\nfor today so I think this is a oh\nactually that's in the guide what am I\nsaying so I was going to say so we can\nabsolutely talk about it but I think\nKarma talking about karma is a very good\nexploration of this topic so over on the\nmembership side we had a couple of great\nKarma lectures we talk about Karma and\nthe trauma guide because there is this\nwhole idea of like you know everything\nwe're talking about is fixing you but\nwhat about the outside world so I think\nthat's a very important discussion but I\nI don't think it's a short answer I\nthink it's like a if we're going to talk\nabout it let's talk about\nit um\nokay so can you recommend specific\nmeditation techniques there's 10 about\n10 of them in the guide um which by the\nway is why we built a guide right\nbecause like I don't know if this makes\nsense but there's no way we can get to\neven 1% of the questions that y'all ask\nor even share with y'all 1% of like the\nmeditations that y'all can try and\nthings like that that's why we build\nthese stock resources that are way more\nin depth I I don't know if this kind of\nmakes sense but\nyou know filming of the trauma guide is\nlike the\nfilming is a week of me showing up at a\nstudio at like 8:00 and leaving at 5:\nand cameras are rolling for like 9 hours\na day for like 5 to seven\ndays and so it's it's like you know like\nin order to duplicate that I would have\nto stream for like 50 hours in a week so\nI just can't do that like my voice\ncannot handle it so that's why we build\nthese resources because there's just no\nway we can get to everything but it's\nvery like and the reason we edit and\neverything is so that like it's very\nhigh\nyield\num so how do you start to build your own\nsense of self I think it's first of all\ncleaning out negative emotions and then\nstarting to bring together emotional\nexperiences into a new narrative there's\na whole video about narrative and\nidentity and constructing a positive\nnarrative is something that can be\ntaught it is a skill and it is something\nthat has been shown to improve uh\noutcomes and Trauma so like narrative is\nan important part absolutely so there's\njust a way to do it um how to not be one\nof the 69% to resist trauma treatment\ngreat question so remember that those\npeople are not resistant to trauma\ntreatment they are resistant to a\nparticular intervention for a particular\ndiagnosis and we know the cause for that\nresistance is a high level of\ndissociation we have other things that\nimprove\ndissociation so there's a certain model\nof of trauma treatment called stare and\nthe whole model is based on first you do\nthis then you do this then you do this\nthen you do this and when you do it that\nway that's like a comprehensive approach\nthat checks most of the boxes and deals\nwith this concept of resistant to trauma\ntreatment is cptsd curable or do you\nhave to deal with it for the rest of\nyour life I personally believe that for\nI would say most people it is basically\ncurable I know it's a bold statement I\nmay be\ndumb I may be wrong but I personally\nbelieve that trauma for most people can\nbe cured I do not believe that for\nschizophrenia so I think we know that\nsome of our psychiatric\ndiagnoses are\nlike Progressive and more biologically\ndriven so schizophrenia is a really good\nexample of that\none where but like trauma is different\nI've seen people basically be in\ncomplete remission or cure from cptsd\nbefore\num I'm 50 and never felt happy how long\ninto treatment for PTSD will I be before\nI can start to feel the short answer is\nI don't know\nso the other thing about trauma\ntreatment is that your mileage may vary\nso if we look at most\ntreatments they tend to be effective\nsomewhere around the 8we mark and you'll\nhave some gains up until about the 16 we\nMark and then beyond that you can\nabsolutely have gains but generally\nspeaking it takes two to four months for\ntreatments to start to be\neffective that being said feeling\nhappy let me actually pull up a\npaper feeling happy\nis not necessarily one of the things\nthat we look\nat in in trauma treatment right so we'll\nlike measure some things but we don't\nnecessarily look at happiness so like\nthis is the kind of thing where\nyou know the short answer is your\nmileage may vary the slightly longer\nanswer which is super\ncool is complex post-traumatic stress\ndisorder is an independent diagnosis\ndifferences in hedonic and UD dionic\nwell-being between p cptsd and PTSD I\nimagine that the answer to your question\nis somewhere in this paper so what this\npaper talks about is that there are two\nkinds of Happiness there is dopaminergic\nhappiness and there is serotonergic\nhappiness\ndopam energic happiness is what we call\nhedonic hon Hedonism hedonic well-being\nso this is like my ability to experience\npleasure UD dionic happiness is a sense\nof contentment peace or internal\nhappiness that is not tied to a\nparticular thing so if I\nlike go on a roller coaster that will\nincrease my hedonic happiness playing a\nvideo game will will increase my hedonic\nhappiness watching pornography will\nincrease my hedonic happiness because it\ngives me\npleasure but especially with things like\nvideo games and pornography it can\ndecrease my UD dionic\nhappiness so this is my sense of like\npeace and joy in\nlife unfortunately cptsd is associated\nwith impairments in both and less of\nboth so what we do know is that if you\nget treated for this stuff those both of\nthose indices will improve and what we\nalso know is that in\ncptsd UD dionic unhappiness is more\nprofound than hedonic unhappiness so if\nyou have a history of trauma your\nability to engage in pleasure is\nmodulated or impaired but your ability\nto feel at peace and feel Joy in life is\neven more\nimpaired so the pleasure circuitry is\nsomewhat intact the sense of Peace\ncircuitry is more screwed\nup so let's just kind of take a quick\nlook at I think I remember that\ncorrectly\num see these findings indicate that core\nsymptoms of\ncptsd Might hinder individuals from\nliving fulfilling lives that's what UD\ndionic happiness is\nokay it's\nbizarre so if you guys are\nwondering so like putting together this\ndeep dive first thing is for every hour\nthat I spend telling y'all about\nsomething there's four hours of stuff\nthat I leave\nout and this is like this is why I like\ndoing such a deep dive because it's like\ncool because if youall ask a question it\nturns out there's literally at least one\npaper that talks about happiness and\nTrauma\nright so the there's good news and bad\nnews here the short answer is how long\nwill it take you to feel happy I would\nsay give it at least 6\nmonths but there are also other caveats\nthere right because whether you feel\nhappy or not can be somewhat independent\nof your treatment so I had a patient who\nonce came in and I treated them for\nmajor depressive\ndisorder and after about two years they\nsaid I don't feel like I've gotten any\nbetter and I was like well what do you\nmean by that because your life is\nimproved we've talked about all the\nthings that have improved and he's like\nI still don't I still feel depressed\nevery day and after tunneling down into\nit that's when we realized this isn't\ndepression this is\nunhappiness and the presence of\ndepression is different from the\npresence the absence of unhappiness the\nthese are two separate things the\ntreatment of depression moves us towards\nneutral learning to be happy is its own\nseparate path this is often times more\nalong the spiritual line as opposed to\nthe clinical\nline and in trauma that can be true as\nwell and so if someone hasn't felt happy\nwe absolutely know that things like the\ndorsal medial prefrontal cortex are\nimpaired in cptsd which prevents people\nor makes it difficult for them to feel\npositive emotions instead they feel\nnumbness when they go to a birthday\nparty for them when they go to their\nbirthday party everyone is happy and\ncelebrating and you're just like I don't\nfeel anything like it's not bad but I\ndon't feel\nJoy and that's where there is the so\ntreating cptsd will help with you dionic\nwellbeing\nabsolutely but part of that treatment is\na little bit more spiritual and you can\ndo that on your own right so you can do\nyou can learn to appreciate you can\nstart practicing gratitude there are\nother ways to engage to increase your\nhappiness that don't have to do so much\nwith cptsd now I suspect some of these\ntechniques will be difficult for people\nwith\ncptsd because the parts of their brain\nthat normally these techniques would\nactivate May somehow be\nimpaired so I I recently did a lecture\non the Neuroscience of\nEnlightenment and that may be showing up\non on one of our channels soon maybe\nmaybe not I'm not\nsure but the short answer is your\nmileage may vary it is a very good\nquestion there's a lot at play between\ntrauma and happiness and fulfillment\ntreatment will\nhelp but even if it doesn't help don't\ngive up I guess that's what I mean to\nsay that the treatment of an illness is\nnot the same as creating happiness in\nyour life and sometimes that is an\nindependent\nprocess and on that note we're at time\nfor the day way past time so it's been\nan absolute pleasure to be here today\nwith y'all um let me think\nabout I just want to show y'all a couple\nof things before we close out so for\nthose of y'all that are joining us late\nwe do have a trauma guide that is going\nto be coming out soon that is available\nfor\npre-order um I know we discussed a lot\nof dense Neuroscience today so we're\nalso improving things in that\nDimension so here we have\nsome of the trauma guide\nGraphics right so some of these\ncomplicated Neuroscience things that we\nteach y'all we absolutely want to teach\ny'all like we try to make it accessible\nbut we're not dumbing it down and I\nthink that the more that yall understand\nthe difference between dorsal medial\nprefrontal cortex emotions and amygdalar\nemotions the more in control of your\nlife you'll be and in order to\nfacilitate that understanding we have a\nlot of cool stuff coming down the\npipeline the trauma guide is made with a\nlot of love so definitely check it\nout thank youall very much for coming\nhere today um and then you know take\ncare of yourselves like don't give up\nit's not\nover like the reason it's it's\nreasonable to want to give up because\nyou can try really hard and things don't\nimprove makes a lot of sense I hear that\nbut it doesn't mean just because things\nhave not improved does not mean that\nthings are impossible so take car all\nhappy weekend"
