    "transcript": "if you could make season eight of Game\nof Thrones an enjoyable experience like\nthat's what would the figured out\nthat's what enlightenment is is living\nyour life and being able to enjoy season\neight of Game of Thrones\nthat's enlightenment modern-day\ndefinition of enlightenment\nokay let's do let's do this question\nabout suicide my question I don't have\nthoughts of suicide but my desire to\nlive life to live is really low I don't\nwant to die and my morals and ethics are\nreally against suicide but how does how\ndo one distinguish between thoughts of\nnot wanting to live and wanting to die\ndon't worry I'm not in danger of doing\nanything I just don't want my\nperspective I just don't want my\nperspective to change over time ah I'm\nassuming that by your perspective to\nchange over time you mean you want to\nnot start thinking about suicide as\nopposed to not wanting to live I hope\nyour perspective changes over time but I\nhope what changes is your desire to live\ngets higher so let me read this again I\ndon't have thoughts of suicide but my\ndesire to live is really low I don't\nwant to die and my morals and ethics are\nreally against suicide but how does one\ndistinguish between thoughts of not\nwanting to live and wanting to die\nfantastic question\nso I think it's important to okay so\nlet's just talk about this is a great\nquestion I love it so I'm a psychiatrist\nI treat depression right so depression\nis like when people feel like their mood\nis really low and they feel unhappy and\nsometimes they can be suicidal they\ndon't feel like doing anything they feel\na motivated and sometimes what I'm\ntreating someone with depression there\ncomes a day where they come into my\noffice and then I kind of assess them\nfor depression so I use some kinds of\ntools\nlike I'll use like something called the\nBeck Depression Inventory or the\nHamilton depression scale and\nI'll have a conversation with them which\nis a very strange conversation they say\nI'm unhappy and like I feel like the\ndepression has it gone away and based on\nthe scales and I'll ask them like are\nyou able to get out of bed every day\nthey say yes can you go to work every\nday they say yes do you have difficulty\nconcentrating no so why do you feel like\nyou're depressed and they say like well\nI just don't I don't feel like doing\nanything I feel like my life like\ndoesn't have any meaning and then I say\nokay so this is as far is your\ndepression this is as far as treatment\nfor depression can take you there's a\ndifference between depression and\nunhappiness we've treated your\ndepression the problem now is that\nyou're unhappy and these are two\ndifferent things and one of the biggest\nmistakes that's been made in like modern\nmental health thinking is that we've\nstarted conflating unhappiness with\ndepression people who are unhappy say\nthat they are depressed and that sort of\nmakes sense because like that word works\nbut there's a difference between a\nclinical depression and being unhappy\nright there's a difference between being\nill\nand like having a life that has no\nmeaning those are two entirely different\nthings\nand so I think that the issue with lupus\nis the way I'd put it is there's a\nthere's a huge difference there's a\ncavernous difference between not wanting\nto live or not caring to live and\nwanting to die\nand no no no so you guys are this is\ncompletely wrong\ndepression equals over a longer time no\nwhat I'm saying is that the color and\nflavor these are two entirely different\nthings\nit's like one is something you see and\none is something you hear completely\ndifferent spectrums not related at all\nbut unhappiness leat leads to depression\nalso untrue also untrue\nso I'm defining things in a particular\nway oftentimes people who are depressed\nare also happy unhappy but sometimes\npeople who are depressed are content so\nyou guys have to understand that the\naxis of your mind is different from like\nthe axis of your othman or your true\nself that there's a difference between\npain and suffering does that make sense\nlike suffering and pain or two different\nthings and so I think what lupus is\ndealing with is that they don't have a\ngood reason to live because their life\nprobably lacks meaning which is\nabsolutely a problem but the solution to\nthat problem is different from treating\ndepression now in this case I would\nrecommend that someone gets an\nevaluation for depression right because\nlike you should just get checked out for\ndepression but like so now the question\nbecomes so a lot of people are thinking\na little bit about you know what's the\ndifference between these two can't they\nrelate to each other sure they can\nrelate because we everything can relate\nwe're a human being and the different\nparts of ourselves interact but I'll\ngive you guys an example so this is the\nexample that I always use when I talk\nabout pain and suffering so the first\nquestion is what's the difference\nbetween pain and suffering so\nlike when I get a massage sometimes\ntechnically I'm in pain but it feels\nreally good I'm not suffering at all it\njust feels really good when I'm on call\nlike that's painful like it's painful to\nnot sleep for 24 hours but I feel\nfulfilled like I feel like I'm doing\ngood work and I don't suffer\nright even if we think about like\nphysical pain like I got a flu shot the\nother day like that was painful but it\ndidn't cause me suffering so Sanskrit is\nthe best word to understand the best\nlanguage to understand this would that\ntalked about something called look look\nmeans suffering and what he said is that\nLucas outside of the the mind actually\nthat within the mind we experience\nemotions right like sadness and then\nLuke is suffering so I'll give you guys\nanother example from my life so my dad\npassed away several years ago\nand I was sad and I was grieved but like\nI was kind of also you know like I\nthought it was his time and I understood\nthat he had lived a full life and am I\nam I still sad that he's not alive today\nyeah but I'm not like I don't suffer\nbecause of it\nright it would be different if I lost my\nwife or lost my kids like then my\nsuffering would be intense like there's\na difference between sadness and\nsuffering like there's there's a certain\namount of peace that you can get like\nsure like of course I want my dad to be\nalive but at the same time you know like\nhe lived a life and like he was an\nawesome dad and I'm grateful for the\nperson that he was and it was his time\nto go and I can be okay with that right\nlike if you think about a relationship\nwhere your long-distance with someone\nand you guys try things for 18 months\nand then the relationship you guys just\nsaw really decided that it's like it's\ntoo hard we're just like it's too much\nwork and this relationship is not going\nin the right direction\nand we should break up and both of you\nguys can be sad but you don't have to\nsuffer because of it right you can both\nunderstand you can have some degree of\npeace or contentment and understand that\nthis is the right thing even though it\nhurts like a flu vaccine\nso someone is asking can paint as\nphysical suffering as mental no right so\nyou can have mental pain too so the\nsource of suffering is attachment it's\nnot just an emotion it's attachment\nright so if we think about what what\nabout my dad's situation would have left\nleft me with more suffering is if I had\nlike still wanted him to be alive if I\nhad felt like he hadn't lived a complete\nlife if I hadn't gotten from him\neverything that I really needed to if I\nwas still attached to him being a lion\nlike the way that I am with you know my\nfamily and my kids like I'm attached to\nthem I don't want them to go anywhere\nlike I'm not at peace with that\nso attachment is the root of suffering\nlike for example I'll give you guys just\nanother example about dating and\nfriendship right so if I want to like\ndate someone I can be attracted to them\nand I can ask them out and I can say hey\ndo you want to go out on a date can I\nbuy you dinner sometime and they can say\nno I'm seeing someone but thank you very\nmuch I'm flattered\nand then I can be disappointed but I\ndon't have to be bent out of shape right\nlike I don't have to go home and like\ncry into my pillow\nlike I don't have to do that now if I\nwas attached to her I would if I had\nlike built up this like this castle and\nin my mind of like what our relationship\nwas gonna be like this fantasy and that\nwe were gonna go out and then she was\ngonna be my waifu and then we would get\nmarried and then you know she would like\nlike we would spend Christmas like this\nand she would make me like breakfast\nevery morning and then I would make her\ndinner every night\nand if I like built up all these\nattachments around the relationship then\nI'm going to suffer but if I don't have\nattachments if I understand that did I\nwant to go out with her absolutely\ndid I\ndid I am I disappointed sure\nbut I don't have to suffer well he's not\nintensely so suffering is related to\nattachment and pain and emotions are in\nthe mind in attachment actually is\nrooted in the mind but like the\nsuffering happens kind of outside of the\nmind\nso huh yeah so a couple of a couple of\npoints okay so depression and\nunhappiness can be related but I think\nthe main question here how do you know\nif if you're so many good question okay\nwell I'm gonna stick with lupus is\nquestions okay how do you end suffering\nor change it to pain if it makes sense\nit does make sense the first thing to\nunderstand is that like you can't avoid\npain in life right there's gonna be\ndisappointment there's gonna be sadness\nthere's gonna be grief you can however\ndo something about suffering so\nsuffering is is about attachment and so\nthe way to end your suffering is to\ncultivate something called Vairagya\nwhich means detachment so to be detached\nfrom the outcomes of your actions and\nthe most important thing the most\nimportant source of attachment for most\npeople that I work with is specifically\nwith the outcomes of their actions so\nthere's a big difference between wanting\nto ask a girl out and wanting her to say\nyes and being having an expectation or\nhope or fantasy that's based on that\nlike an if you guys I used this because\nI mean I use the relationship example\nbecause I just I think it's like a raw\nexample that a lot of people can relate\nto because it really captures this idea\nthere are other examples let's talk\nabout a promotion right\nI can want a promotion but I can also\nget like really caught up in it\nI can get really invested in the\npromotion the promotion means the world\nto me and if I don't get it my life is\nshattered\nso I'm attaching myself to the outcome\nit's like I want to go to Harvard or\nStanford or Yale and so I like like it's\nand everyone can want to go there anyone\ncan want to go there but it's the people\nwho get attached to that idea who are\ndevastated when they don't get it and\nthen if you're not attached to it like\nyou could still want something like I\ndidn't want my dad to die but I\nunderstood it was his time right because\nthere are some things that I've wanted a\nlife that I didn't get which I'm bummed\nout about but I don't like suffer so I\nthink what lupus needs to do is to\nunderstand first of all that you're\nyou're you're probably lacking so your\nquestion a couple of questions one is\nhow do you how do you move from\nsuffering to pain and the answer is to\ncultivate detachment how do you\ncultivate detachment it's to focus on\nyour actions instead of the outcomes of\nyour actions it's the difference between\nI really want an a on this test and I'm\ngonna study four hours a day for the\nnext week until I take the test\nthose are two very very different things\nthey may both look the same but what you\ntell yourself in your mind both of them\nmay result in you studying four hours a\nday but it's what happens in here are\nyou focusing on what you do are you\nfocusing on what happens are you saying\nI'm gonna ask that girl out or I really\nreally want her to say yes there's a\ndifference between I like that girl I'd\nlove to go on a date with her and I\nreally really really want her to be my\ngirlfriend\nshe's the one she's the one right that's\nattachment you can see the difference\nbetween that\nlike her she's cool I'd love to go out\nout with her and she's the one she's the\none I know she's the one\nlike she's the one that's attachment\nso if you're suffering in life chances\nare the source of your suffering is\nsomething related to attachment\nanother good question wouldn't being\ndetach make someone feel numb all the\ntime\nno in fact the exact opposite if you\nlive a detached life you feel more\nfulfilled right because think about this\nfor a second if you're if I really want\nto go out with her\nand let's just play this this tape\nthrough to the end yeah I know lupus so\nI'm tempted to say if you like we got\nwe're gonna switch to meditation but you\nshould come on stream or if you want to\nhop on discord we can talk now\nbut so\nyeah so we're gonna do we're gonna okay\nso let's just take a step back okay\nso first thing is suffering comes from\nattachment peace come peace or\ncontentment comes from detachment now\nmost people think that apathy and\nattachments are the same thing they\nthink that detachment means not caring\nno just listen to what I'm saying okay I\nlike a girl\nI think she's attractive I want to go on\na date with her does that mean that I\ndon't care no it doesn't mean that I\ndon't care I have once I have desires\nbut it just means that I'm not like bent\nout of shape about her right and so then\nwhat happens is if I asked her out and\nshe says yes\nthen the question becomes like what is\nwhat is that what how do you think that\nthat person feels\nhmmm how does that person feel\ngood right I'll tell you what it feels\nlike it feels like christmas came early\nthis year\nthat's that's what it feels like to them\nright it's like yeah she said yes right\nand that's different from with the\nattached person\nif she says yes and the person is\nobsessed with her he actually doesn't\neven feel great\nhe feels like like I mean he's gonna get\nso obsessed right he's like oh my god\nlike this is gonna be like this is the\nfirst step to everything else like this\nis gonna be amazing\nlike oh my god this is gonna be so\nawesome she's gonna be she's perfect I\nknew she was perfect I knew it they get\nobsessed whereas the person who she says\nyes it's like yeah man like we're let's\ndo this like let's have fun no what I\nlove is completely different okay so the\ninteresting thing is that attachment and\nexpectation are related okay when you\nhave attachments you have expectations\nI'm asking her out and I expect her to\nsay yes I'm putting my eggs in the yes\nbasket and so then the question becomes\nso if attachment has to do with\nexpectation\ndetachment has to do with a lack of\nexpectation so detachment lack of\nexpectation how do you feel when you\ndon't expect something and you get\nyou\nyou\nabsolutely right so like buying the\nbuying a lottery ticket and winning the\nlottery you would feel amazing no\nquestion not buying a lottery ticket and\nfinding a winning lottery ticket in your\npocket would feel even better right like\nit's crazy\nso this is where I've okay so we're\ngonna talk about meditation and so like\nI want you guys to do something for me\nso what I want you to do and we'll get\nto lupus in a second okay so what I want\nyou guys to do is pay attention to which\nmoments of the week between now and next\nweek so let's let's do another discord\nset of like write a paragraph to a page\nabout which moments were you the most\nhappy like try to find a moment to pure\nhappiness like it doesn't have to be a\nbig happiness but just like the purest\nlike the most untainted moment of\nhappiness so when I say most happy it\nimplies like you know something big has\ntime I'm not talking about the size of\nthe happiness I'm talking about the\npurity of the happiness so when is like\na moment that you just like when is like\nwhen are the purest moments of happiness\nin your week and where are the purest\nmoments of suffering in your week and\nreally describe them describe the\nscenario and then see if there's any\nrelationship between an X the existence\nof an expectation and that happiness or\ndisappointment\nyou have to catch yourself right you\nhave to pay attention because it's gonna\nbe tiny tiny things\ntiny tiny times so I'll tell you guys\nwhat it is for me which is like I\nsolicit hugs and kisses from my two\ndaughters all the time\nI still listed them I asked for them and\nthen if I don't get them I'm bummed out\nif I do get them I'm happy but there are\nsome times sometimes where I'm just\nsitting there I'm not doing anything I'm\nlike cooking or something like that and\none of my kids walks around and is like\ndaddy I want to give you a hug and then\nthey give me like this really really\ngreat pot and on in that moment I feel\nin pure bliss\nright that's pure bliss that's pure\nhappiness\nI mean don't get me wrong it feels great\nwhen when like I need a hug and they\ngive me a hug\nright yeah oxytocin\nright and so like you guys are talking\nabout game\nso like I'm gonna I'm gonna just drive\nthis home okay so Game of Thrones if you\nguys want to re-watch Season eight\ndo you think if you watch it the second\ntime around you're going to enjoy it\nless or more\nyou\nah why\nYeah right because you had this\nexpectation for it to be like a\nsatisfying conclusion\nand it wasn't it was disappointing and\nso if you go and Yuri watch it you know\nit's gonna be a [ __ ] show you have no\nexpectations you know it's gonna suck\nand then you can enjoy\nyou can just like look for all the\nglaring potholes and you can laugh at\neach one and so just think about this if\nyou can make season eight of Game of\nThrones an enjoyable experience like\nthat's what would the figure it out\nthat's what enlightenment is is living\nyour life and being able to enjoy season\neight of Game of Thrones\nthat's enlightenment modern-day\ndefinition of enlightenment"
