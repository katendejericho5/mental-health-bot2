    "transcript": "when it comes to social interaction it's\nnot a problem as long as we're talking\nabout how to stop people you guys I\nasked a question about how to make\nfriends and no one has a [ __ ] clue\nbut we talked about how to stop people\nand invade their privacy and make them\nfeel uncomfortable and everyone's got a\n[ __ ] answer and they're all so\ndiverse right what's your social\nsecurity number can you open the blinds\nwhen you sleep like oh my god do you\ncome to this train often or your parents\nhome right so like okay here's the thing\nif you want to make friends you take the\npart of you that is funny\nbecause all of you guys are clearly\nhilarious and then you just make it not\ncringe-worthy right you just make it\nabout like like pretend like use that\nsame funny part but then make it about\nsomething that is not invasion of\nsomeone's personal space and privacy\nso what are you guys feeling you guys\nfeel like talking about like meditation\nquestions about meditation finding\nfriends in real life habit practical\ntips for Vata someone's talking about\nbecoming a pro gamer ok finding friends\nlet's do it okay so here's the question\nokay let's do friends okay so here's the\nfirst one\nhello firstly I had a question about\nfinding friends in real life it seems\nthat most regular people meet other\npeople through the people they already\nknow what do you do after moving to\nanother city state or country what would\nyou do if you've been gaming for years\nand realize you have no real-life\nrelationships fantastic question the\nfirst thing is I think you know when we\nthink about friendship we think about it\njust like a random topic like we think\nabout it like food or philosophy like no\none really stops ok the mic Peaks let me\nsee if I can I think that gain is\nalready down I don't it's all the way\ndown crackles a bit when I get loud ok\nwell we will have to fix that later I'll\njust try to keep my voice somewhat\nmonotone whisper whisper ok I can keep\nit a little bit further away so let's\nsee if that helps\nso does this sound ok\nokay so let's um let's first understand\nlike how friendship works okay so I want\nyou guys to understand that just about\nanything about your psychology or\nanything about your choices or habit or\nwhere you are in life or where you want\nto go in life or if you're struggling\nwith something you can apply sort of\nlike mathematics engineering and science\nto it to try to figure out how it works\nit's the first question that I have for\ny'all is how does friendship work like\nwhat is the mathematical equation for\nyou and someone else to become a friend\nwhat do you guys think the variables are\nwhat do y'all think we're gonna try this\nbe alive common interest personality\ntraits proximity okay so what we're\ngonna do okay I'm gonna use word common\ninterests all day so do you guys have\nfriends do you guys have friends that\nyou don't share interests with you don't\nknow because you don't have friends pepé\nhands so common interests is not one of\nthe most important things for a\nfriendship so think about the friends\nthat you guys have made so far what how\nhave you made your friends if you guys\nlike you guys had friends when you were\nin grade school Sunday class school and\nwork okay\nso we have so what does that tell you\nright so we make friends from school we\nmake friends for work so what does that\ntell us about like what's important to\nmake a friend oh the book is still being\nmade we're gonna add to it\nenvironment but what does that mean\nenvironment like what about the\nenvironment like if you say like so\nremember the goal of this stream is to\npractically help people understand stuff\nbe around people right so okay let's\njust let's debunk these okay let's think\nthrough these okay because we spend a\nlot of time there and share struggles\nokay that's the that's we're gonna get\ninto that so first thing is like be\naround people so like if I go hang out\nat a train station am I gonna make\nfriends no right so it's not just\nproximity of people so the first thing\nthat you guys need for friendship is a\nregular amount of unplanned interaction\nokay so if we think about like why do\nyou make friends at school and work it's\nbecause you get regular exposure that is\nunplanned so there's no pressure on\nanyone regular exposure that is\nunplanned with a group of people that's\nthe first thing that you need for\nfriendship and that's the first thing so\nthe second thing is common cause and I\nthink Farrell was talking about this\nright so if you think about the people\nthat you make friends with like you make\nfriends with them because you guys share\nlike a goal or you all struggle together\nyou're in know you're in you're in kind\nof like a group together I mean actually\ntransition back to live Plus chat so\nthat I can look over here so a regular\namount of unplanned interaction and\ncommon cause I think are the two most\nimportant things for friendship\nso is it school or work a planned\ninteraction not between you and the\nperson you show up to class they show up\nto class classes plan but it's not like\nyou're trying to like get them they're\nnot coming to class for you and you're\nnot coming to class for them\na planned interaction is like let's say\nthat I I call up my buddies I say hey\nlet's go to the movies\nthat's a planned interaction\nand so the first thing to understand\nabout friendship is like you guys need\nto have regular unplanned interactions\nwith people and y'all need to have\ncommon cause common interests is helpful\npersonality like personality stuff is\nhelpful it doesn't mean that you're\ngoing to become friends with everyone\nthat you interact with on an unplanned\nbasis but the most important things for\nfriendship or unplanned interaction and\ncommon cause so if you guys want to make\nfriends if we think about that like if\nwe realize that those are the two most\nimportant variables and then like the\nthird variable is common interests then\nwe have to structure a life in which\nwhich we're being regularly exposed to\npeople without any pressure so this is\nwhy people say like go and volunteer or\nlike take a class or something like that\nyou need to go to a place where like you\ncan see other people on a regular basis\nso you don't feel pressured it's not\nlike you're hanging out at a train\nstation and be like hey man sitting next\nto me on the train do you want to grab\nbrunch next Sunday and hang out for a\nfew hours like that's really weird right\nbut if you see someone in class like\nevery every day or three times a week\nthen like after a while like you can be\nlike hey men like you introduce yourself\none day and then then like common cause\nhelps a lot so common causes like\nstudying together for a test so you and\nthe other person have shared goals\nthere's something that you guys like\nlike y'all are y'all are naturally\naligned toward something like if you\nguys are at work and like your boss is\nan [ __ ] you guys have common cause in\nsort of like combining together to like\ndeal with your boss right so if you guys\nwant to make friends the first thing is\nthat so it can be hard when you move to\na new setting country whatever but the\nfirst thing that I do is I'd structure\nsome activities that you can you're not\nlike there to like pressure people into\nbeing your friend you're just gonna go\nthere and do the thing and hopefully you\nwant to pick activities that other\npeople are going to show up with like on\na regular basis so the nice thing about\ntaking your class\nis that like presumably there are other\npeople in the class who are gonna show\nup every week and so like that's a good\nway to make friends like people make\nfriends like in a a groups right\nAlcoholics Anonymous it's like I mean a\nlot of people make like become friends\nthere because you guys are there and you\nshow up on a regular basis and then like\nyou guys are both trying to not drink\nand so y'all are looking for people to\nhang out with who don't drink and so\nlike a is like there are a lot of people\nthat I work with who've made friends\nthrough a that's really important\nbecause if you're in it with a with a\nfriend group that does it you know\nyou're trying to change that friend\ngroup then you have to try to you know\nget out of that and so finding like\npeople that share common cause that you\nguys have common goals that you guys\nhave shared struggles that's what common\ncause means it's common goals and shared\nstruggles someone is asking A's\nAlcoholics Anonymous so then the next\npart of the question is what do you do\nif you've been gaming for years and\nrealize you have no real life\nrelationship so then like so first it's\nimportant to recognize that right and\nunderstand that that's gonna come with\nsome feelings of like shame and\ndiscomfort and like feeling like you're\nyou suck at life so I understand that\nthose feelings are there and that those\nare those are not inappropriate feelings\nbecause you kind of you've started to\nkind of fall fall behind in life and\nthen what happens is you start to like\nacknowledge those feelings and then you\nmove forward right and like think about\nthink about this guys like so right now\nin chat everyone is talking about being\nfriends why do you guys like what like\nhow is it that you guys are gonna become\nfriends with each other it's because you\nguys have regular unplanned interactions\nlike you know when would Reno and\ndigital dudes show up and chat like\nthey're not showing up with the express\npurpose of hanging out with each other\nthey're showing up to like listen to the\nstream and participate in the stream\nand then like over time they kind of\nknow each other because they like both\ntalk when they're here right and so this\nis a prime example and then you guys\nhave common cause because y'all are\ntrying to learn something about your\nlife or improve your life or get better\nat life and so like twitch chat is\nactually a fantastic example of you know\nthe the recipe for friendship which is\nthat you need regular unplanned\ninteractions and then you need common\ncause and so people are talking about\nyou know is it re friends the same thing\nas regular friends like they're not the\nsame but I think that they scratch a\nsimilar each so I think that the\nfriendship that you form with people\nonline is authentic I think it's real\nfriendship and you can get a lot of\nsupport and validation and and pride and\njoy out of friends and at the same time\nlike no one over the Internet can give\nyou a hug and some of the value of\nfriendship are things that you can't get\nover the internet so like we have this\ncircuit of our brain that I sort of\ncalled the social sonar so a lot of\ntimes gamers have difficulty with social\ninteractions because since so much of\ntheir social interaction is over the\ninternet there are a lot of parts of our\nbrain that aren't active over social\ninteraction over the internet and so\nthose parts of our brain become like\nrusted and they don't work well so one\ngood example is like reading body\nlanguage so when I talk to gamers about\nbeing socially anxious around like\ngroups of people part of the reason that\nthey're socially anxious is because they\nare not their brain is not able to\ninterpret body language of people around\nthem and why isn't their brain able to\ninterpret the body language because you\ndon't interpret body language when\nyou're hanging out over discord so your\nbrain much like a language that you\ndon't speak says like oh like I don't\nneed to understand body language because\nit doesn't affect my social interactions\nat all let me turn off that circuit and\nso then when you go into the real world\nyou feel super anxious and you feel like\neveryone is judging you because normally\ntheir body language should reassure you\nbut since your body language the body\nlanguage interpreting part of your brain\nhas been shut off because you spent so\nmuch time on discord\ncan't reassure you and then you you like\nget super-anxious and you think that\neveryone's like paying attention to you\nand things like that it's because your\nsocial sonar has been disabled it's not\nwords it's not it's like all the other\nstuff it's like sonar you just sort of\ndetect things so I do think that the\nfriendships that you form online are\nimportant in real and they're also\nmissing some important parts so there's\na there's a hormone I mean there's a\nneurotransmitter in hormone called\noxytocin F what does that mean anyway\nthere's there's a oh is it lagging so I\nwas talking about oxytocin so we're just\ngonna talk for a second about oxytocin\nthen we'll we'll move on so you have a\nneurotransmitter or hormone called\noxytocin which forms like emotional\nbonds so oxytocin is the hormone that\ncauses mothers to release breast milk so\nyou have some hormones that cause the\nbreast milk production but then there's\nanother function called breast milk\nletdown so if you think about like like\na postpartum mother like their their\nmilk has I mean their breast has milk in\nit and the milk just stays there right\nlike it doesn't usually leak it just\nkind of hangs out there and then what\nhappens is when you you get a suckling\nsensation on the breast from a newborn\ninfant then that suckling sensation\ncauses the release of oxytocin oxytocin\ncauses the stored milk to be like opened\nso it's kind of like opening the faucet\nfor a breast milk for for a newborn I\nmean uh postpartum mothers with newborns\nthe other interesting thing about\noxytocin is it causes breast milk\nletdown but it also Foster's emotional\nbonding so a lot of infant mother\nbonding is through oxytocin a lot of\nsocial interactions are mediated through\nlike like oxytocin enhances social\nbonding so when people have are sexually\nactive and they cuddle afterward or\ncuddling in general causes oxytocin\nrelease any time you hug someone you get\na little spurt of oxytocin\nand with that spurt of oxytocin causes\nyou to form a bond with someone else and\nlike gives you positive feelings about\nthem they have positive feelings about\nyou it sort of helps you feel good it\nhelps you feel connected to other people\nthe problem is that online interactions\ndon't really foster oxytocin release so\neven though the friendship is real\nyou're gonna be like your brain is\nliterally in your physiology is gonna be\nmissing something from human contact and\nyou just can't really substitute that\nthere was some there was some there were\nsome interesting trials actually in\nschizophrenia where people tried to like\ngive people oxytocin so that like social\ninteractions with people with\nschizophrenia would get better but those\nsort of really good in theory but didn't\nreally work well yeah can men produce\nmilk yes so there are some cases of like\ntumors and stuff like that where you can\nget milk production but not in any any\nsignificant quantity can work\ninteraction substitute for oxytocin or\ncuddling if you're physically no I don't\nthink you interacting with yourself do\nyou cuddle with yourself after you jerk\noff that's the question right so\ngenerally speaking I don't think you can\ncreate oxytocin by like interacting with\nyourself I think you just uh yeah that's\nthat's what's missing can my pillow\nsubstitute I don't know I don't think so\nI mean so I think that like maybe\nsomewhat but I think that I don't know\nexactly what it is about cuddling like I\ndon't know where the precise line is for\nlike you know cuddling or touching or\nwarmth I don't know if it's temperature\nor like what\nit could be just the pillow I don't know\nI I don't think that there are any\nclinical trials that measure oxytocin\nrelease after cuddling with a pillow\nversus a human being and now we're\ntalking about body pillows fantastic\nokay okay no questions fantastic okay\nit's can someone ask a test question in\nthe stream because it does I just wanna\nmake sure it's working weighted blankets\nare very good for insomnia and if you\nhave anxiety before bed okay\nthanks Brendan okay yep it's working\nperfect so let's do another question\nokay so on the on the thread okay these\nare all great questions thank you guys\nwhat do you think about board games is\nan alternative hobby to video games I\nattend a weekly meetup at a game shop to\nplay games for a few hours with some\nother people\nI feel like board games scratch a\nsimilar intellectual itch while being in\na social environment so that's perfect\nright because we're talking about how to\nmake friends and I think this is a prime\nexample so if you are a nerd and you're\nnew to a city find a board game store\nbecause I think that they do offer a lot\nof the same things as video games and\nour social and are also time-limited\nlike if I'm gonna play like Agricola or\nsecret Hitler or codenames or resistance\nwith friends of mine like that can be a\nlot of fun you're interacting with other\nhuman beings you guys are hanging out\nand also like you can't play that for 12\nhours a day for like six days a week\nso I think that board game shops are a\nfantastic alternative I think board\ngames are a fantastic alternative to\nvideo games I think that once again I\ndon't think video games are evil and I\nthink you guys should have fun right\nlike you want to be having fun like\nthat's the whole point\nit's go have fun and go socialize at the\nsame time and I think it's a great way\nto make new friends when you move to new\ncity what man my hair really needs to I\nneed to get a haircut\nokay second part of the question would\nbe let's talk about okay this is related\nto friends okay second part of the\nquestion be how do you find people who\naren't boring as [ __ ] I love online\ninteraction because it allows you to\nskip all the social posturing lack of\ntaboos and so on but at the same time\nI've experienced what it's like to be\nghosted by people I've known for years\nwithout knowing anything about them so\nhow do you find people who aren't boring\nas [ __ ] okay\nso the first thing is like very few\npeople are actually boring right like if\nsomeone is like if you think someone is\nboring as [ __ ] like what what are you\nlooking for and what are they showing\nyou like what is that what is like\nboring as [ __ ] mean does that mean\nbecause it allows you to skip all the\nsocial posturing lack of taboos and so\non so I mean my guess is that this\nperson has like maybe like doesn't like\nlike to play by the rules of social\nnorms and he finds he or she finds\npeople that respect social norms like\nintroducing yourself and not dropping\ndropping f-bombs when you meet someone\nto be like cumbersome and boring and so\nthey think small talk and things like\nthat are boring but these are the ways\nthat human beings send a warm up to each\nother it's also like the way that\nregular human beings figure out if\nyou're a [ __ ] weirdo right because\nlike if you can't do that it's sort of\nlike like you could you can you can\nblame or criticize as much as you want\nto about a social norm and I'm not\nsaying that those aren't like those\naren't fair criticisms like you can say\nthat for example people ask the question\nhow are you and that question no one\nactually wants to know how you are it's\njust like a social formality right you\ncan say that that's a waste of time and\nspace but and that's true but they're\nalso like some conventions that have\nvalue just because everyone else follows\nthem and this is something that's like\nreally hard for people to understand\nthat like when people criticize social\nnorms they're like oh yeah that's stupid\nwe should just all be authentic but like\nremember that driving on let's say so I\nlive in the United States so driving on\nthe right side of the road is not like\nmorally better than driving on the left\nside of the road there's no inherent\nadvantage to driving on the right side\nof the road\nthe only advantage of driving on the\nright side of the road is because\neveryone else [ __ ] drives on that\nsame side of the road and if I decide\nthat I want to be like edgy and I want\nto be like authentic and I want to be\nfresh and not a boring [ __ ] I'm gonna\nstart driving on the left side of the\nroad because like why am I gonna be like\na [ __ ] nor me like [ __ ] normies\nlike I'm not gonna be like that I'm\ngonna just drive the way that I want to\nand I don't know why these like normies\nare always driving on the right and and\nlike yeah there's no inherent value to\ndriving on the right side of the road\nbut there's value in the there's value\nin the fact that everyone does it so the\nfirst thing is like why are social\ninteractions like basic social\ninteractions so like laborious for this\nperson right like why can't you just\nlike make small talk with people like\nwhat bothers you so much about making\nsmall talk with another human being\nsmall talk isn't I mean it's not really\nfantastic it's not amazing it's not like\na freshly baked chocolate chip cookie\nbut it also isn't like you know\nsix-day-old back and cheese that's been\nreheated three times it's just small\ntalk and I think if you want to get past\nsmall talk you can ask questions to\npeople that are like interesting and get\nyou to know someone without being\ninvasive so you don't ask someone\nyou know what's your deepest darkest\nfear I would say yeah what are your\npassions like that's a weird question\nask someone right\nyou like meet someone at the train\nstation and they turn to you and they\nsay what are your passions tell me what\nis it that you are passionate about you\nknow it's like that's kind of weird but\nI would ask them hey like what are you\nexcited about for the next year\nlike 2019 is coming to a close and is\nthere anything that that you're really\nproud of right that's kind of like you\nknow so you can ask questions to people\nlike oh if you have you have you\ntraveled anywhere interesting recently\nlike I think travel is a great way to\nget people talking about stuff you can\nask about travel and I think that\nthere's a difference between making\nsmall talk and not saying anything and\nalso like completely violating social\nnorms and you know you can learn a lot\nabout someone and then once they respond\nso right so if I ask someone what's\nwhat's tell me about 2019 they say I'm\none year closer to death and then you\nkind of laugh and then you say like yeah\nso how does it I mean it's one you're\ncloser to that the good thing or a bad\nthing and then you kind of play ball and\nif someone says okay so like let's play\nthis game okay dr. Kanodia is gonna take\nyour [ __ ] answers and respond to\nthem in a fun and easy manner so where\nhave you traveled recently yeah I left\nthe house this morning to get food and\nit's like wow like who is leaving the\nhouse to get food like a good thing or a\nbad thing did you eat something\ndelicious like if you had to if you had\nto go through all the trouble of leaving\nyour house did you at least get\nsomething tasty WIC was it worth it\nthat's the question you ask right like\nwas it worth it to leave your house to\nget what food you got yeah see like and\ndeagle I is giving me smiley face emotes\nright so like let's get another question\nlike what okay so this one what traits\nare you excited about that's the great\nquestion so I encourage you guys to go\nto a party or go Thanksgiving or go to\nyour holidays and and and like like ask\nthem about what trains they're excited\nabout and then watch their confusion and\nbe like are you excited about any train\nsir no I'm confused\ndon't you love trains they're gonna\nthink either you're autistic and\nobsessed with trains or you can segue\ninto like Thomas the Tank Engine memes\nright what kind of computer do you have\ndo you come to this train often is not a\ngood question to ask people asking\npeople about the regularity of their\ntravel habits and where they're going to\nbe at certain times when you first meet\nthem is not an acceptable question yeah\nso yeah asking people if they're here\nalone can I have your number no but like\nokay so do you guys want to talk about\nlike how do you ask someone out do you\nguys know how to do this your parents go\nthat's how you ask someone out or your\nparents home [ __ ] dachshund creepy\nass [ __ ] into a chat see when it\ncomes to social interaction it's not a\nproblem as long as we're talking about\nhow to stop people you guys I asked a\nquestion about how to make friends and\nno one has a [ __ ] clue but we talked\nabout how to stop people and invade\ntheir privacy and make them feel\nuncomfortable and everyone's got a\n[ __ ] answer and they're all so\ndiverse right what's your social\nsecurity number can you open the blinds\nwhen you sleep like oh my god do you\ncome to this train often are your\nparents home\nright so like okay here's the thing if\nyou want to make friends you take the\npart of you that is funny because all of\nyou guys are clearly hilarious and then\nyou just make it not cringe-worthy right\nyou just make it about like like pretend\nlike use that same funny part but then\nmake it about something that is not\ninvasion of someone's personal space or\nprivacy yeah that's actually a good\nquestion do you pour milk or cereal\nfirst right like that's that's a good\nquestion\nthere's a difference between our humor\nin Norma humor yeah just don't make it\nabout stalking people yeah so so instead\nof asking okay so this goes downhill so\nfast right we start we start with cereal\nand milk and then and then we go to this\nis the divergence of twitch at okay\nwhat's your favorite cereal too is that\na wig do you wipe sitting or standing\nand showering with socks fun so that's a\ngood one I would ask someone hey if you\never shower with your socks on\nI heard the wildest thing which is\napparently it's supposed to be amazing\ndo you wipe front to back it's always\nfront to back\nboys and girls yeah you could ask people\nthat shower with their socks on they'll\nthink you're [ __ ] weird but they\nwon't think you're stopping them\nwho the hell stands to wipe yeah good\npoint federal so remember it's front to\nback otherwise you'll end up with a UTI\nokay let's do another question so okay\nso trillion is right we didn't answer\nthe original question\nthe second part of the question would be\nhow do you find people who aren't boring\nas [ __ ] I'd say like honestly try to\nengage them in conversation right so I\nthink like if you find people boring as\n[ __ ] you're probably not like actually\nbothering to understand who they are or\nwhat's interesting about them so that's\nyour problem like people aren't boring\nas [ __ ] like it's kind of like saying\nyou know how do you how do you find\nfresh food in the trash can it's like\nyou don't look in the trash can you go\nto a grocery store to find fresh food so\nif you're interacting with people and\nyou think they're boring as [ __ ] like\nyou should just think a little bit about\nlike what is it about them that like you\nthink is boring and why why is it that\nyou're thinking about why do you find\nthem boring like try to engage them in a\nreal conversation and start by a couple\nof softball questions like you know do\nyou take this train often do you do you\nclose the blinds when you sleep like you\ncan start with like easy ones to put\nthem at ease and then you can ask them\nthe real like heavy hitters that get get\nyou like really knowing them as a person\nwhich is do you wipes thing or sanding\nand and then then you know then you're\ndone no but I think really just try to\nunderstand that most people have like\nrelatively interesting lives or relevant\nrelatively interesting internal\nexperiences of life and try to engage\nthem on that level try to find out what\nthey're interested about so if you want\nto be interested in someone get them\ntalking about what they're interested\nabout they could be really fascinating\nlike if someone's passionate about like\nfishing like I don't care about fishing\nbut I have a friend who's really likes\nto fish and it's really cool to hear him\ntalk about fishing like you learned\nsomething you know if there are people\nwho are interested in something get them\nget them talking about what they're\ninterested in you'll probably learn\nsomething you'll probably more be more\ninteresting I'd love to go deep-sea\nfishing in the Caribbean it's just not\nsomething that you know I don't I didn't\ngrow up fishing is it true that someone\nwill like you more if you let them talk\nabout themselves versus you do the\ntalking I think generally speaking yes\nlike I don't think that so I think you\nhave to be careful about the phrasing of\nthat question is it true someone will\nlike you more if you\nthem talk about themselves versus you do\nthe talking so I think you have to be\ncareful because you can't really make\nsomeone like you so you should step away\nfrom the idea that if you do X Y or Z\nthat a particular person will like you\nat the same time I think that a lot of\npeople in conversation tend to be pretty\nnarcissistic case in point I'm just\ntalking to myself for two hours and I\nlove it right this is fun for me so I\nthink the big problem is that a lot of\npeople are very narcissistic like a lot\nof extroverts are very narcissistic and\nas a result the general advice that\npeople tend to give about how to be\nsuccessful is targeted at a minority of\nthe population which are extroverts and\nnarcissistic so a lot of times people\nyou know if you get people let people\ntalk about themselves I think that's\nreally the better thing it's not so much\nyeah like you said let them talk about\nthemselves so if they want to talk about\nthemselves let them talk about\nthemselves but it's not making them talk\nabout themselves sometimes people go too\nfar and they're like drilling people\nwith questions because they get this\nidea okay people need to talk about\nthemselves and then they'll like me so\nif I want to be like liked in a social\ninteraction I need to drill people with\nquestions so let is yeah you use the\nword lab so I think use the right word\nand so I think let is the prime word\nright so you engage someone in a\nconversation that allows them to talk\nabout themselves and if they feel so\ninclined you let them but if they're\nintroverted and prefer to hear other\npeople talk then you pay attention to\nthat and you notice it and then you\nstart talking the other thing that you\ncan do you know we were talking about\nthis in recovery coach training is you\ncan just call attention to what is and\nso for example you know if you're at a\nparty and you don't know anyone you can\nwalk up to people and say hey my name is\nall oak I'm a friend of so-and-so's but\nI just realized like I thought that he\nwas gonna invite different people but I\nrealized I don't know anyone at this\nparty nice to meet you\nperiod how do you think that goes across\nright that's great\nso if you're both introverted what you\nshould do is you should walk up to\nsomeone and you could tell them hey is\nit okay if I stand here and not talk to\nyou for a little bit can we just hang\ntogether and listen to music try that or\nyou could you could go to a party and\nyou can say yeah so how three nine seven\nnine it says I really dislike how the\nworld is centered around extroverts even\nthe workplace are there ways to make it\nmore advantageous for introverts yeah so\nyou should you should understand that\nlike the world only thinks it's designed\nfor extroverts and if you're an\nintrovert you just have to play to your\nstrengths so you don't have to try to be\nan extrovert you just need to understand\nthat your strengths are different and\nthen you can engage people just as well\nlike you can get promoted so I'll give\nyou guys kind of a couple of examples\nfrom my clinical practice so I was\nworking with a guy who was concerned\nthat he wasn't gonna get promoted\nbecause he doesn't as he puts it fill\nthe room when he when he's like in it so\nlike he works with other colleagues and\nlike one of his colleagues does a really\ngood job at like what he calls filling\nthe room so their presence is like known\nanytime they're in the room they are\nthey're like they're loud they're\nboisterous they come across as confident\nthey make jokes they're likable and so\nthis person was concerned because\nthere's they're up for promotion so it's\nit's the introvert versus this guy and\nhe's concerned that the other dudes\ngonna win because he's just like like\nthis my patient was kind of my patient\nwas kind of like intimidated and was\nconcerned that he was going to get\npassed over for promotion so the more\nthat we were talking about it it's not\nthat my patient had a problem\nconnecting with other people they just\ndidn't want to be like loud in front of\na room and so what my patient is really\ngood at has good relationships around\nthe office as long as they're one-on-one\nbecause they're really good at like\ngoing and grabbing coffee with a\nco-worker or grabbing lunch like as long\nas it's small intimate situations and so\nI think if you're an introvert just\nunderstand that like you can still get\nmost of the things that extroverts get\nnot by necessarily becoming an extrovert\nbut just by playing To Your Strengths so\nif you're like lobbying to get promoted\nwhich you need to do is have small\ninteractions with individual people and\nand like have there gonna be like way\nmore meaningful and when it comes time\nto like reviews or like when your boss\nstarts asking your coworkers like\nthey're gonna speak very highly of you\nand then people are saying that you can\nhave a big presence if you're an\nintrovert absolutely so I have a big\npresence and I'm an introvert right so\nit's a skill that you can learn so I\nlove like I mean I love being at home\nfor a week and doing absolutely nothing\nI don't have to see another human being\nI'd be fine on a desert island for a\nweek by myself and if you if you're an\nintrovert just understand that your\nstrength isn't in the one-on-one right\nit's kind of like you know there's like\nsolo queue and there's part EQ it's not\nlike one is better than the other if you\nlike to solo queue solo queue you can\nstill play the game if you so look you\nlike it's not Q the way you want to and\nthat's just how it is"
