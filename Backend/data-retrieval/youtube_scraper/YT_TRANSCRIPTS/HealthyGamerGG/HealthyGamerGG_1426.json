    "transcript": "so so I mean my experience has been that\noftentimes attractiveness especially for\nwomen\ngets them a bad shake\nokay so do people know what sparked you\ncoming on do people know this well I\nthink maybe some people in chat do but I\nthink some people might have the wrong\nimpression okay so why don't you tell us\nwhat happened and what we're doing today\nokay so I'm how do I put this in am\nwithout misconstruing again so I made a\ntweet that people didn't agree with and\nthat's totally fine\nthey're not no one asks agree with\nanything I say that's how it is\nbut people took it in the wrong light\nbasically called me sexist and I guess\nthe main issue here is that it got put\ninto a bigger streamers discord that\nbasically is like known for like a\nnegative community and also on the\nsubreddit that can be somewhat negative\nas well so it turned into me getting\nlike death threats basically like in my\nDMS and stuff and then people making\nTwitter accounts solely like literally\naccount was just to hate on me like\nthat's what the whole account was made\nfor which is so strange to me and like\nokay like you know I've dealt with it in\nsmall doses but never in like big groups\nof people so okay yeah so I think that's\nthe biggest she was just for me I don't\ntake it too personally because I don't\nknow me personally I do a pretty good\njob of not letting it affect me because\nI don't check the links to like the\nforums or anything so the only way I\nknew that that even happen is just\nbecause people told me and because I\nstarted receiving like lots of nasty\nmessages it's out of the blue because\nlike I don't even stream anymore so it\nwould happen whenever I would stream\nevery once in a while and it's like okay\nwhatever but I was like where's this\ncoming from\nand so um yeah whenever that happened\nit's just I think what bothers me more\nis I try too hard to figure out what's\ngoing on in their mind and so that's\nlike what sticks with me it's not what\nthey're saying about me it's not like\nit's not that you know it's bothering me\nlike oh my gosh like what do people\nthink about me it's more like what is\ncompelling them to do this like yeah so\nso let's just can I just ask you to be a\nlittle bit more specific so like what\nwhat happened what did you say and what\ndo you why do you think what you said\nrubbed people so far as to yeah so what\nI said was um and I'm gonna emphasize\npart of it because I think this is a\npart that people did not read I just\nsaid so if like a girl is dating a guy\nand her he's not doing anything like\nthat's the part not doing anything like\nnot putting any effort or anything like\nthat and she's just completely like\ntaking care of him\nlike that's his mom okay I decided a\njoke\nand then people got super mad at that\nand called me sexist which I'm not quite\nsure which way they were calling me that\nanyways because to me it was more like I\nhope that girls would date someone who\nis putting an equal effort is them you\nknow if that's something they like find\na priority which personally I do I think\nmaybe that's where my standards come\ninto play versus other people's and\neveryone's allowed to have their own\nstandards agree on doing so\nyeah and then on the other hand like I\nwould hope like I would always hope to\nhelp someone figure out what they want\nto do and I think a lot of people my\npersonal life I know that as well\nthat if someone's like not motivated for\nsomething like even if I can't help them\ncuz I mean you can't help someone who\ndoesn't want to have help so um I would\nstill want to be like Oh like you know\nmaybe you'd be interested in this or\nlike here's some options for this and so\nI hope either side like no one would\njust be sitting there doing nothing\nbecause I think that makes you unhappy\nin general so I think that might have\nbeen the part though a lot of people\nrelated to and think maybe I was kind of\n talking that um well I'm sorry what\nare they relating to I think maybe they\nare relating to not having something\nthat brings in motivation or happiness\nin their life because I feel like that\ncould be a population that it got the\nreason I think that's the population it\ngot advertised to is just because I knew\nthat it did get put in a streamers\ndiscord that was you know who else would\ncome and attack people for the reason\nlike not happy people not people who are\ndoing something in their life that um\nyou know they wouldn't have time to do\nthat they wouldn't care enough to do it\nand I think generally whatever if\nsomebody just disagrees with someone\nthey just kind of move on because I know\na thing I see things that I disagree\ntime and I'm just like okay like that's\nfine so it sounds like like there are a\ncouple of different things going on one\nis that like so you're allowed to\ndisagree with anyone on the internet and\nyou're gonna disagree with anyone on the\ninternet but something about what you\nsaid rubbed people the wrong way to the\nextent of evoking some sort of like\nresponse or action right right yeah\nwhat what do you think you evoked in\nthem I think um trying to find the right\nword for it but maybe a feeling that\nthey're not good enough in some part of\ntheir life okay and it could have to do\nyou know I don't know but it could have\nto do with having a girlfriend or it\ncould have to do with they didn't feel\nthey were being successful in some part\nof their life yeah I think there's some\nvoid there which like I think we all\nexperience that I mean I know I have to\nso it's not like it's like I'm looking\ndown on anyone it's just I think that's\nprobably what pisses people off okay so\nyou know it's it seemed like so I from\nwhat I'm just trying to find that the\nTwitter exchange because I don't\nremember exactly what it said but you\nknow so my recollection was that you\nmade a statement that you know about\nwomen dating men who were basically not\ndoing anything in life and then you're\nyou're their mom and then someone\nessentially reversed the genders right\noh yeah yeah and then and then they sort\nof said that if a guy is dating a girl\nwho isn't putting anything in then\nthey're you're their dad and then right\nyou disagreed with that yeah that has to\ndo with just my mmm personal a mix of\npersonal standards and because they kind\nof irritated me by just like trying to\nyour date so okay\nfirstly it got to me and I was just like\noh like that's annoying and just like\nreplied kind of like you know I don't\nknow I was just trying I mean we ha\npeople are where do they get in that but\num yeah so I think people took that the\nwrong way too but how do you think they\ntook it I'm not\nhonestly I'm not quite sure that's kind\nof where it's been getting to me where\nI'm like I don't know why that made\npeople so angry so actually going on in\ntheir head absolutely completely unfair\nso so you know we were talking about how\nwhen something strikes a chord with you\nit evokes people to like argue or\ndisagree yeah yeah so what about what\nthat person said struck a chord with you\nso that you tweeted back right exactly I\nthink the same thing happened there and\nlike I guess before I answer that it's\nlike that's I know where to stop myself\nI guess because like I could be you know\nif I see or whatever but I always try to\nkeep it in check and I know like you\nneed to be respectful of other people so\num\nI think what struck a chord with me\nthere is that of course like a\ndisagreement but um\nmore so I had also started receiving DMS\nfrom like the person who tweeted that\nand also other people and they were like\nstarting to come at me with like the\ndeath threats and stuff already and so I\nwas like that that just made me mad you\nknow I was like okay well I'm not going\nto not stand up for myself in a way so\nyeah I think there's always a fine line\nof like juice let people walk all over\nyou and not respond and not give them\nsatisfaction that way or do you stand up\nfor yourself a little bit and you never\nknow where that's gonna go okay yeah do\nyou think that the people who are\nmessaging you are in their minds\nstanding up for themselves in some way\noh I think they could be actually yeah\nso not that they're doing I don't think\nand okay - and then yeah and then I'm\ngonna apply for like a master's program\nbefore okay back yeah before post back\nno I'm in the apply for a post back\nbefore med school okay what I mean if\nyou've done okay so it looks like we're\nback okay so I think some people were\nconfused about what you were saying so\nis it I'm gonna just show people the\ntweets is that okay\nyeah that's fine okay just so because I\nthink people are confused because we're\nreferencing weird stops oh so I'm gonna\njust do this real quick so these are the\ntweets chat this Bud Light ad what is\nthere an ad okay so these are the tweets\nright so Farrell says some girls are\nreally out here dating boys with no job\nnot in school having to pay his rent and\nfood and then call that a relationship\ngirl you're his mom I think that that's\nfunny some dudes be dating girls with no\njob not in school having to pay her rent\nand food and call that a relationship\nboy you're her dad and then you\nresponded what doesn't work that way -\nI'll try again well okay so hopefully\npeople saw that and now you guys\nunderstand what we're talking about so I\nthink fair like here's you know so I\nthink you what you said makes a lot of\nsense in terms of like you're striking a\nchord with people yeah and and you know\nthere's a certain amount of you can also\nuse the language of like you know how\nmuch do you fight against the Internet\nhow much do you sort of take things like\nlet things slide how much do you stick\nup for yourself and I don't think that\nyou know we can talk a little bit about\ninternet trolls but you know so I wonder\nlike do you so when I when I read\nsomething like this in general like when\nI read statements where one gender has\nbeen so if you take a statement and then\nyou just change out the gender of\npeople's reaction towards it differs\ndepending on which gender you're talking\nabout sometimes that appears to people\nto be like a double standard what do you\nthink yeah I can see it I can see that\nfor sure and that's again where I think\nit got kind of misconstrued because I I\nwasn't meeting it that way but I can\nlike what a hundred percent see how it\nwas taken that way how does how did you\nmean your disagreement yeah so I kind of\nsaid earlier I don't know if it was\nBuffy then but um I meant it as in like\nI think both sides should put in the\neffort you know I mean I said think you\nknow it doesn't just apply like guy to\ngirl relationship you know really real\nguy whatever so I think both sides\nshould put in effort equally on how they\nagreed as well you know like some for\nsome people they may want like one\nperson to be the provider\nto not be or both or whatever I think\njust as long as no one's feeling like\nminimize in the relationship I think\nthat makes a good relationship so as\nlong as you can agree and openly\ncommunicate and I think that's um more\nthan I meant is whenever I was saying it\nit was more being like maybe that wasn't\nsomething that was agreed on beforehand\nand you know the guy I mean isn't\nmotivated to do anything with his life\nand to me like if that was my situation\nI would just feel at a disadvantage like\nI was doing everything and then\npotentially you know having to raise\nkids at the same time and like that's\nnot having someone who wouldn't want to\ncontribute in any way I just think yeah\nso that would just be a personal issue\nfor me and like you know no one has to\nhear that either so so so yeah I mean it\nsounds like what you're kind of saying\nis that you know your treat so this is I\nthink the big problem with Twitter is\nthat like you know people aren't allowed\nto have nuanced and deep views on\nTwitter right everything is like that's\nthe sentence I said that's exactly what\nI meant that's it yeah and that's just\nkind of how Twitter is and I think\nthat's why it's funny like I don't know\nif you guys ever read stuff on like\nTwitter but I love to it longer\nyeah actually to explain yourself yeah\nthere was a there was a really great I\ndon't know if you guys are following any\nof this like Hong Kong Blizzard\ncontroversy like it was big a couple of\nweeks ago but there was a hearthstone\nplayer who posted something on to it\nlonger which I thought was really good\nand he was kind of talking about\ndifferent sides of the issue but so so\nlike feral so you're not streaming\nanymore I'm not have you read the\ncomments on the reddit thread\nI have not okay that's why I keep my\nsanity yes so the comments on the reddit\nthread are not very nice and yeah I was\njust but it sounds like people are\nmessaging you a lot of this stuff how do\nyou handle that in turn like how does\nthat make you like I've never gotten a\ndeath threat DM before so I don't know\nhow that feels how does that feel well I\ngot one the first day I ever stream so I\nwas prepared for it a little bit um why\ndo you think you got one the first day\nyou streamed I'm not quite sure I just\nwouldn't told\nI wouldn't play a game with them and all\nof a sudden that was the end of the\nworld for them so um not quite sure on\nthat one\nbut um I didn't I didn't do anything\ncontroversial there um but yes I think\nin small doses like I don't I don't take\nthem seriously other than just be like\nwell you know I mean I take my safety\nseriously but at the same time I'm not\ngonna take it to heart because I feel\nlike that's just unhealthy for me in the\nlong run mmm of course it gets to me a\nlittle bit like how cabin you sit there\nin Rita and it not get to you yeah I\nhave no idea yeah pretty good job of it\nyeah I mean it sounds like you're\nhandling it pretty well I think I've\njust seen it happen to other people so\nmany times it's really unfortunate um\nlike that mob mentality sort of thing\nyou know if they can hop on that and\njust like have that group of people\nthat's attacking one person and just\nmake like a villain out of them they\nfeel good about themselves which I mean\nI'm not sure why on that to you that's\nthat's what gets to me I'm like I don't\nknow why that makes you feel good so\nthat gets to me\nnot the exact like messages I'm\nreceiving I'm just like it's annoying\nbecause I have to put everything on\nprivate and like I got II will interact\nwith the people I normally interact with\nnormal sure yeah and I'm sure\ncircumstance but so so would you say\nthat it almost sounds like like by by\nundermining is so attacking the how can\nI say this attacking\none else makes you feel better about\nyour insecurities that's what I assume\nthe reason is but I'm like there has to\nbe something else like I'm sure for each\nperson it's a different specific\nresearcher so it's like I can't figure\nit out for everyone so what sucks like I\nwant to yeah I don't know why I want to\nbut I do I'm kind of curious about this\nwhole like brigade egg thing because I\nthink that then you know the internet\nreally loves their pitchforks they like\nman do they love their pitchforks and\nI'm kind of curious I mentioned this on\nstream one or two times before but you\nknow I'm I would love to talk to someone\nwho is actually like a pitchfork\nwielding internet troll yeah yeah\nleigh-anne\nand I I'd love to understand you know\nwhen you wield your pitchfork on the\nInternet and then you go and you you\nburn a witch like what does that do for\nyou yeah and I just don't understand I I\nthink that the interesting thing is that\nyou know when you this is kind of like a\nrandom thought but like when you when we\ncall people trolls on the Internet I\nwonder if in you know in a weird way\nthat actually is attacking them and does\nthat make us feel good about ourselves\nright um I thought I had a different\nview on this when I was streaming\nbecause they're like oh it's just trolls\nbut I feel like it's almost actually a\nneutral term for them because if you\njust say it's just trolls you're just\ndismissing it like I guess for them it's\nlike oh you're not important but at the\nsame time I think that just doesn't do\nit justice like I could sit there and\nhave people whenever I did stream in my\nchat saying like awful things like I\nwould just ignore it it's just trolls\nlike you aren't supposed to feel\nanything about it because they don't\nmatter\nmm-hmm well first of all like any person\nmatters so the person on their side that\ndoes matter and secondly my feelings\nalso matter so it's just this weird like\ndisconnect between the person and the\ntroll yeah it sounds like look what\nhappens is that people are sort of\ngetting acclimatized to trolls behaviors\nso they just sort of like let it slide\nand I kind of factor it in into like the\nnorm yeah I almost think that with\npeople like not\nseriously that they would even take it\nfarther for people to take them\nseriously so yeah all right yeah why do\nyou think that is well I think their\nmain thing like whatever their\nindividual reasons are is just to be\nheard because maybe they don't feel like\nthat in their everyday life and so\nwhenever people you know they think\nthey're I mean there's no way a good way\nto go to pass it but they think they're\ndoing the right thing by not responding\nto someone but in the long-term is that\nthe best thing you know like because\nthey're just gonna keep doing it and\nthey're gonna do it for the response and\nuntil they get a response so something\nhas to change\nI don't know what it is good something\nhas to change where I mean I no longer\nfeel the need to do that so so I mean I\nI think you know I wonder a little bit\nabout people and stream are talking\nabout stuff like attention and and\nthings like that I mean right so I think\nlike trolling on the Internet is a big\nproblem and I'm wondering like feral\nwhat do you think we can do about it oh\nman I thought about this a lot actually\nyeah especially when I was straining\nbecause it was more of a I always want a\npositive atmosphere like whenever I was\nstreaming or like even though I'm like\nsocial media now or whatever I'm active\nin like I always want to keep it to\nwhere people feel comfortable enough to\nbe themselves and they don't feel judged\nand they feel like you know just a happy\nplace like I don't want to be that space\nwhere the like quote-unquote trolls like\nbuild up and go attack someone\nso um I the way I did one little thing\nto try to help with that is made like oh\nI mean I guess pretty much like your\ndiscord is completely but cut like a\nsafe space channel a my discord or\nanyone could just talk about their\nproblems and not feel judged because\nit's really hard to do on stream if\nyou're not doing what you do like I\ncan't even give them good advice because\nI'm not a psychiatrist so it's like I\nwould try my best to help everyone but\nthe best way for me to do that is allow\nthem a space to like just maybe let it\nout to a positive for people like I can\ntell what you're saying this is to\ncreate a space where a troll feels safe\nso like a case\nyes I need a little K for them yeah so\nlet's let's make it let's make a troll\ncave honor our disco yeah but I need\nhonestly like I don't know any other\nlike way that's better than just\nliterally the stream that would come bat\nit because I don't think people listen\ncan I can I ask you for a bizarre favor\nokay so feral if you get a DM again like\nso I don't I want you to think about\nthis before you agree to it cuz I don't\nknow if this is any good or bad so\ngenerally speaking when you get a death\nthreat you you just ignore them right\nbecause any chaos wants them yeah so any\nkind of response that you give them is\ngoing to probably evoke more behavior\nyeah and and at the same time like I\nwish there was some way that I could\nrespond to them and I don't know or\nactually maybe maybe this maybe if\nthey've sent you a DM instead of you\nresponding directly just tell them that\nthat I want to talk to tell me who they\nare and then all message them personally\nokay and that I'd like to talk to them\nbecause I think I think if they're\napproaching you then like I would love\nit if you could just send them my way\nbecause I would love to hear their side\nof the story like why why do they feel\nso angry about what you said do they\nfeel like it's a double standard like\nsome people in twitch chat feel like\nit's a double standard yeah I can see\nthat\nand yeah I mean so like I you know I\njust I send them my way okay I can do\nthat now but at the same time like I\ndon't you know I don't want you to\nengage with them and open yourself up to\nlike further kinds of stuff so if you\nfeel like it's safe or if you want to\npost something on like whatever you feel\ncomfortable with you can even just email\nme their like their names on discord\nlike they were DM everyone discord or\nTwitter oh no so I I can't answer on\nInstagram because once you open a\nmessage you pretty much have to keep it\nopen well I guess unless I block them\nbut um you can do it on Twitter or I\nclosed off pretty much everything so\nI've kind of gotten anything in a while\nbut um I'm sure I have a few lying\naround so that I didn't get to block yes\nI can just\noh so you said that all this stuff came\nfrom a discord right there's a streamer\nwho yes but I can't say who or else you\nmight get banned so\nokay yeah I don't want you to say who\nbecause I might get banned but help me\nunderstand how that works\nwhy would I get banned for you saying\nsomeone's so well maybe not but it's\nreally out chance but I just want our\nyeah yeah I think it's against TOS to\nkind of like talk negatively about other\ntwitch partners so I see yeah that's why\nhuzzah but then why don't they get\nbanned fur that's a good question I\ndon't think they didn't so I don't think\nI can get banned on their community\nunless they themselves are doing\nsomething so if the street didn't send\npeople after me because like he probably\nthe name check is discord so big yeah\nbut um yeah then what can I do you know\nand they are subscribing to these people\nso okay so so I'm just trying to figure\nout like how does yes so how do how does\nthe troll contact me that's the question\nso it looks like they can they can\nmessage us on Twitter\nyou guys can sign up on the about Me\nsection of our twitch but I mean I I\ngenuinely do want to understand like\nother people's perspectives yeah yeah\nand I I think that you know I thank you\nfor coming on and sort of sharing your\nthoughts I I know that was there\nsomething in particular like did you I\nknow we'd sort of floated the idea of\ntalking about relationships in general\nbut I feel like you kind of explained\nyour perspective on that some yeah I\nthink something that everyone can agree\non if they want to healthy relationship\nwas just open communication having\neffort both ways what in whatever form\nthat may be yeah I I think that's a\nnon-controversial way to be a\nrelationship right like that's pretty\nnormal\nI would agree so I'm gonna ask twitch\nchat if they have questions for you okay\nor us but did you have anything else\nthat you wanted to share I mean I I feel\nlike you explained things pretty well\nyeah not not too much okay\nyes so you stopped streaming mm-hmm\nwhat's that about is that a question for\nme yeah yeah yeah I'm just waiting I'm\nbuying time we're still alive yeah so\nokay\nso I stopped streaming partially because\nI wasn't enjoying it okay the reason I\nwasn't enjoying it is because I wasn't\nable to find a way to actually help\npeople with my stream like yeah maybe I\nwas providing entertainment value or\nwhatever but for me I always want to be\nable to like actually impact someone's\nlife in a way well in it with anything I\ndo so I was avoiding med school because\nthat's why I came by the first stream\npartially I don't think I'm good enough\nto go or whatever\nso um yes I disabuse you of that notion\nright yes no I I don't care how long it\ntakes me to get there so that's why I\nstopped streaming as well because it\njust good for you for about what was\nbeneficial to me and it wasn't it so\nyeah yeah you know if you're just\noffline you get you're welcome to\ncontact me because there's a fair number\nof people in our community who are\ntrying to sort of get a handle on their\nlife and right and we've been able to I\nthink support them a little bit in\ngetting to their career goals on some of\nthose include med schools so we have our\nfingers crossed for people that are\napplying to cycle and unfortunately that\nmeans that they'll probably stop helping\nus out because they'll be busy but if\nthere's any way that I can personally\nhelp you figure things out or you know\neven if you want like some people I've\nhad like sort of help out with healthy\ngamer and that if they'll do some\nresearch or something like that and then\nI can write them a letter right right\nand things like that so if you and I are\nkind of involved in our recovery coach\nprogram so I think that is a great in\nand you could put that on your\napplication but it sounds like you're\nstill over a year away from applying\nright right right yeah so so as things\nget down the road and if there's some\nway we can help let us know awesome\nthanks because I I think it's awesome\nthe mission that you kind of adopted for\nyourself to help the world yeah and we'd\nlove to support you and I think a lot of\npeople on punch in chatter sending\npositive vibes your way thank you\nI need it and then I guess someone was\nasking have you stopped using social\nmedia because of everything that\nhappened um that's a that's an\ninteresting answer so I took a step away\nfrom it only just because it was like\ntoo much spamming for me and I'm in the\nmiddle of midterms so it's like a bit\ndistracting for me to deal with anything\nextra than what I normally do and I\ndidn't because in my mind I was like\nwell the trolls would win if they did so\nI'm not yeah yeah you don't want the\ntrolls to win yeah so yes and no more\nfrom my own sake for just exams right\nnow so that someone asks why did feral\ndisagree with the tweet if she agrees\nthat both sides should put an effort\ncare to elaborate yeah so um well I\ndon't know if you heard what I said\nearlier but I was a little bit irritated\nbut somebody like tweeting that back to\nme and just like that's when all this\nstuff started so partially out an\nirritation secondly I guess if they were\nlike just referring to financially or\nwhatever like that's personally someone\nsomething I wouldn't be against like for\nmyself so that's why but yeah someone\nelse wanted that I don't care I mean I'm\ngonna jump in and sort of qualify that\nbecause I think you didn't mention this\nearlier feral so I think my sense is\nthat something that they said and I you\nknow we've talked about a lot of people\nhave challenges in terms of their\nconfidence and their worth and something\nlike that and I know that it sounds like\nyou're making great strides and sort of\nfiguring out who you are and you know\nyou're kind of saying well oh yeah come\nhell or high water you know you're gonna\nend up going to medical school and I\nthink that's the wonderful attitude to\nhave and at the same time if I heard you\ncorrectly I think something that they\nsaid may have struck a personal chord\nwith you yeah yeah and and so what you\nwere really responding to is that like\nwhat they said like felt like a little\nbit of a personal attack which it may\nnot have been an intended that way but\nat the same time you know sometimes I\nthink that happens where people make a\ngeneralization we feel like they're\ntalking about us or like strikes a chord\nyeah I mean that's why what they thought\ntoo so yes right is the best way like\nlittle battle there yes so I and that's\nthe interesting theme of this as it\nsounds like you know\nof what you were imagining they\nexperienced maybe you understand because\nyou were experiencing it too I think it\nsounds like you're you're you sort of\nchannel a lot of those impulses and\nfeelings in a slightly more productive\nway I don't you know we don't really\nknow that asked yeah are you DMing\npeople death threats okay well not bad\nbut you know just playing to my sleeve\nlegends sure talk about toxicity okay so\nsomeone else asks do you think that the\nfact that she is attractive fueled the\nhate to spread even more and if yes why\ndo you think that is what do you think\nFarrell oh um well thank you first of\nall um also yes I think so just because\nhmm I think this happens a lot I just\nwith streamers in general they're like\noh it's a pretty girl playing games you\nknow people just come up with all their\nassumptions already so hmm I'm not quite\nsure how that might have fueled it I\nthink you did so so I mean my experience\nhas been that oftentimes attractiveness\nespecially for women gets them a bad\nshake yeah because I think in real life\npeople don't take me seriously you know\nfor things like oh well you know you're\njust blonde or like this is this and\nit's like I have to prove myself like\ntwo times more than other people just to\nbe taken seriously or for people to\nthink that you know I'm smart or like\nwhatever so yeah it's bizarre III think\nI've heard so I'm a psychiatrist so I\ntalked to people about you know what's\nstressful in their life and the number\nof times that I've heard from men in\nworkplaces about how attractive women\nare primarily mistreated by other women\nin the workplace is staggering like the\nmost common and this is just anecdotal\nso I don't know I mean maybe there's\nstudies about this I'm not familiar with\nthem but it seems that like most of the\nmistreatment that I hear people complain\nabout of women in the workplace it's\nmore commonly from other women than it\nis for men which doesn't mean that women\ndon't mistreat men in the workplace or\nvice versa right but the most bizarre\nthing that I've you know when people\njust talk to me about the dynamics of\ntheir workplace it seems like especially\nthe women for example\nmy female patients feel far more\nattacked by their female colleagues and\nfemale superiors than the other way then\nthen by matin braces which is really\nstrange I don't really get that yeah\nwell it's interesting because it was\nonly men who are mad at my tweet not\nwomen so that's why I went over I was\nlike called sexist I was like I was\nconfused with direction they thought I\nwas because I got a lot of diems for\nother women who are like I totally agree\nwith you and that made me feel like\nsuper horrible a lot myselfs like just\ndate he's the one who wasn't putting in\nany effort in their life at all so I was\nlike yes so just say hear from so I know\nthat there are a couple of women in our\nchat who seem to be agreeing that women\nare pretty horrible to each other and a\nlot of women I work with tend to snitch\non each other even though they're all\nfriends outside of work so I'm not quite\nsure what's going on there so I think we\nhave one or two more questions is that\nokay for you Farrell oh yes you have\nstudying that you need to be doing\ninstead\nI knew but it's okay so what would what\nwould the trolls call themselves who\nwere hating on feral cat what's the\nproper term they would call themselves\nlike what do you how do you think\ncontrol sees season themselves yeah I\nmean I have some fun but I mean I assume\nthere I mean I feel like everyone feels\nabout themselves just to what degree\nthey act on it you know lacking in some\narea and I guess due to that tweet maybe\nthey were just lacking in an area that I\nmay have sparked so so let me ask you\nthis Farrell how did you feel when you\ntweeted your response to that other\ntreat to me do you remember how you felt\nI think I just rolled my eyes honestly\nand kind of moving on but um I I thought\nhe was more of a I felt like I had to\nstand up for myself sort of thing so I'm\nnot sure if that's what they're feeling\nbut it might be so my guess is that they\nwould feel righteous yeah any sense I\nthink I can describe both sides for sure\nyeah I mean I I think that like when\npeople you know they feel like they're\nso the sense that I get is there was\nlike there's a sense of like correcting\na wrong there's like\nfixing an investor's yeah and then\nsomeone was asking me specifically what\ndo I think about the gender reversal\ntweet I mean I think Farrell's\nexplanation makes sense but at the same\ntime I think taken on face value it I\nmean it looks like a double standard\nright mm-hmm\nthere's just yeah it's not like I just\nsat back and was like like I'm right\ny'all are stupid you know it's like of\ncourse like with any criticism yeah I\nthink there's a line where you have to\nsay is am I gonna take this as\nconstructive criticism is that what it\nis or is it just straight hatred you\nknow yeah so I don't know I like like\nright now I'm putting myself in a pretty\nuncomfortable position being here so I\nlike to do that to myself just to keep\nmyself in check and like keep growing I\nguess like yeah I think it's you know\nI'm grateful you came on and I can\nimagine that you're risking the wrath of\nthe Internet so it's actually you know\nkind of ballsy move on your part but I'm\nglad you're talking about things openly\nand and also demonstrating some degree\nof like curiosity about yourself and\nyeah and I think that a lot of people do\nsort of get brigaded by the internet and\nit can be for all kinds of random\nyeah you never know what people are\ngonna see and what's kind of pull up and\nwhat you know what's gonna bring you\nattention so yes so so I think the last\nquestion we're gonna do today someone\nwas asking me how how do I respond\npersonally the role reversal tweet and I\nthink so I will say that I think that\nthere's a lot of discrimination that\ndoes go on against men I think men and\nwomen are treated differently in our\nsociety and sometimes that's to the\nbenefit of men and sometimes it's to the\nbenefit of women i I'm not trying to say\nthat either one is correct but I do\nthink that so I think a very common\nmistake that a lot of people make is\nthat discrimination is like a seesaw and\nso that if you discriminate towards a\nparticular group it means that the other\ngroup is not discriminated against and I\ndo believe that things like privilege\nand stuff like that are statistically\nreal so for example like you know if you\njust look at data on like race and jail\ntimes and things like that like I\nremember one of the most shocking things\nthat I didn't even realize so\nI was working in a jail and on the third\nweek of working in the jail I was like\nsomething was weird about something was\ndifferent about today and I was trying\nto figure out like what is it that's\ndifferent\nwhat is it different that's different\nabout today and finally it hit me on the\nthird Thursday so I'd been working in\nthe jail now for 14 days was the first\ntime I saw a white person isn't inmate\nand so like there's that just it blew my\nmind like it was like I couldn't\nunderstand like it took me a little\nwhile to realize like what what was what\nwas different about that oh use white\nand that's when it was just shocking\nbecause everyone else was like Hispanic\nor Latino X or black and so I do think\nthat there is you know racism and\ndiscrimination I think the the flip side\nof it is that I do think sometimes\nprivileged classes or genders oftentimes\nget sort of a bad rap so for example\nlike eight out of every ten suicides in\nthis country or men so more men have\nkilled themselves in the last year than\nin the last decade of armed conflict in\nthe United States so you take every\ncasualty of war that the US has suffered\nfrom in the last decade and more men\nchose to kill themselves in the last\nyear so that to me is like shocking and\nthen the other thing is I mean I work\nwith some people who are executives at\nmajor companies and they actually have\npolicies that that they sort of have\nsanding policies to preferentially\npromote women and minorities and so it's\nkind of odd I mean they're not never\ngonna say it openly because that'll get\nthat'll get them sued but that's you\nknow discrimination against men does\nhappen yeah for sure\nand I I don't think that and there are a\nlot of other statistics like I'm not I'm\nnot like a red pill kind of guy or\nanything like that but I think if you\nlook at data you can understand that\nit's possible for like multiple classes\nso I'm in some ways I'm in a minority in\nsome ways I'm I'm a privileged class so\nI'm like an Indian doctor of which there\nare no shortages and at the same time\nyou know statistically I was\ndiscriminated against when I applied to\nmedical school because on average if\nyou're indian or asian you have to score\ntwo points higher than the average MCAT\nscore I don't know what the scores are\nnow but back when I was like so Indians\nhave to score two points higher in order\nto get in and depending on your race you\nactually have to have a different MCAT\nscore I'm not saying that that's fair or\nunfair I think if we just look at it a\nlot of people make arguments about you\nknow that sort of I think these\narguments are valid that like that sort\nof ends up working out because like\neducation was highly emphasized and in\nmy household and I had a lot of\nadvantages that sort of enabled me to\nscore higher at the same time you know\nit is it is kind of a differential\nquantitative was the way that my scores\nare looked at or influenced based on my\ngender which I think implies that my\ngender isn't is people I'm being\ndiscriminated against is that okay I\ndon't know so that that's kind of my\nlong-ass question\n[Music]\nI'm sorry long-ass answer but any\nclosing thoughts Farrell hmm I don't\nthink so by the way you may be\ndiscriminated against when you apply to\nmedical school because at this point\nmore than 50% of women are more than 50%\nof medical students or women so before\nlong men may actually have an advantage\nof thing if trends continue going the\nway they are yeah so apply fast\nyeah I'm trying well thanks a lot\nFarrell for coming on and you know thank\nyou for facing the courage of the\ninternet and if you do happen to engage\nwith any trolls feel free to send them\nmy way and I will welcome them with open\narms\noh don't respond to them if you feel\nlike that's gonna inflame them further\nall right don't lastly if anyone knows\ntrolls that we could kind of get in in\ntouch with you know let us know message\nyour local trolls yeah message your\nlocal trolls and tell them that we want\nto create a cave for them yeah yes so if\nyou used to be a troll like you should\nthink about coming on and let's talk\nabout the way that you used to be and\nalso for your friends who are still\ntrolls like have them come on too\nbecause I want to talk to trolls I think\ntrolls are I think there is this federal\npointed I think\nof them or suffering mm-hmm great\nthere's still trolls in here okay well\nthanks a lot Farrell and good luck with\nschool and stuff and you know if you\ndecide to go to medical school in the\nend or if you end up and get getting in\nyou should seriously consider not being\na psychiatrist alright take care all\nright"
