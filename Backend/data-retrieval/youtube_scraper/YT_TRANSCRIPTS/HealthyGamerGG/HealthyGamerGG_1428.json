    "transcript": "it's kind of strange because of the\nsituation that you're describing is is\nnot a great one and yet your mind always\nturns to things that are positive and\ninspiring like everything you're saying\nleads me to believe that you know making\na decision like when I think about\npeople who are struggling with decisions\nI think I don't think about someone who\nis learning lessons and has great role\nmodels and is filled with like love and\nappreciation for their family\nokay great soju BRE tell me what's going\non tell me a little bit about who you\nare what's going on in your life and how\nI and twitch cat can reform you all\nright let me turn on the light seems\nlike I think it's better okay so first\nof all hi everyone nice to meet y'all oh\nyou you can call me JJ or debris\nmy real name is very hard to pronounce I\nguess maybe you can pronounce it um but\nit's my real name is job what job are ya\njob but job what I say about my daddy\ncalled and swatters my full name okay\nbut I'm from I'm from the kingdom of\nbehind and from the Middle East I was\nborn there raised I'm only in the US for\ncollege a little about myself let me see\nI speak three languages I speak Arabic\nFarsi in English although the former - I\ndidn't have a choice\nmy mom's Persian my dad's Arabic so okay\nthey taught me the language languages\nand I taught myself English for the most\npart from a young age actually it's kind\nof not I think of it it's kind of a\nweird trait my family and I share we're\nlike foot like polyglots like my my mom\nspeaks Hindi Persian Arabic English so\ndoes my dad yeah how's your main\nquestion job our job our job of job but\nit's at the end there's a it's like it's\na Kessler in Arabic yeah yes yeah that's\nfine we'll see I made I may try it on\nyeah but how's your head bobble do you\nguys head bobble in Baja like like this\nyeah actually when my when my mom speaks\nover my dad but my parents on they speak\nto like Indians and Hindi they yeah it's\nkind of interesting because it's it it\nyou change it depending on what language\nyou speak you don't had bobble when I\nspeak English\nhmm but when I speak one of the Indian\nlanguages that I speak then I had bobble\nyeah\nthat's a pretty cool thing yeah so yeah\nyeah my brother also speaks languages I\nspeak and none nobody my family speaks\nEnglish as well as I do just because I\ntook it upon myself to you know imitate\nthe American accent and all that and\nwatch Hollywood movies etc Arabic\nactions I can do it Arabic accent in\nEnglish hello my friends how are you how\nare you doing I'm afraid the people in\nthe chat would be very confused so no\nthey will they will just think they are\nwhat not watching an American dream tell\nme Java yes yeah yeah yeah yeah so what\nhow can we help\nso to be honest I actually doing the\nwhole interview in accents no I think I\nsooo be too hard for me yeah yeah oh yes\nup to you I think it's gonna be it's\ngonna be throw me out hard for you\nthat's what she said yeah yeah that's\nwhat should I like you already dr. kay\nbut so I I think there's a plethora of\nthings that I want to talk about but\nsince we're limited in time obviously\nsure I think I think the angle now do\nyou want to talk about eventually is\nlike life just like decision making\nright now being a 22 year old is gonna\ngraduate next month and figure out what\nI want to do in life and career-wise but\nI think it might be better for you to\nget to know me and get to know kind of\nmy history to know exactly what type of\nperson I am and we'll applies to me I\ndon't know it's up to you I'm not the\nguy who would be best suited to but if\nthat's what you that's what you think we\nshould do I can do that and then we can\nget to I think the crux of the matter or\nin solo mob war okay so tell me a little\nbit about who you are okay so so yeah um\nI'm a Muslim I was born obviously like I\nsaid in behind and mushiya most someone\nthe minority of Muslims was like 10% I\nthink so yeah sorry I've tried to be\norganic this is not not planned or\nanything I don't have anything in mind I\njust want to like go with the flow we\nknow what I mean so it's harder to be\nmore organized mentally and I don't want\nto use a lot of filler words there's one\nthing that I'm practicing right now is\nnot to use AHS and likes and it's hard\nbut I pick up I I blame my American\npeers for that thing but well I was just\ngonna say yeah go ahead and go for it no\ngo for it I was gonna say like there's a\nlot of things that affected me in the\npast and and my growth personally okay\nlike I guess when you so we'll get right\ninto it I guess\nokay so I've been mentally and\nphysically abused by my father okay for\nI would say 15 to 16 years of my life\nand so 15 to 16 years because it stopped\nwhen you left for college or no he said\nwhen you were like six I guess I mean\nstarted as far as I can remember maybe\nlike when I was three and so I would say\nif he subtract that I'll be like 13 to\n12 years\nso stop them out when I was 15 or 16 and\nit's not because I went to college it's\nbecause he stopped abusing me and my\nbrother so I have three siblings I have\nan older brother who's two years older\nthan me he's 24 I'm 22 and sister who's\n17 and a younger brother who's five or\nsix I forget but yeah so yeah my dad was\nvery abusive and I I think it affected\nmy growth it has a way of doing that\nunfortunately yeah and so this one I\nthink it's one of the reasons I want to\nleave the country sure but like when I\nsay abuse so usually you know in at\nleast I don't know how similar Indian\nculture is to Middle Eastern like it's\nat least Arabic it's because it's a very\nhonor shame culture kind of\nso so in that sense I think you can\ncompare but you know fathers they want\nto raise men you know men can be\nemotional they can you know cry said all\nthat stuff and so yeah I've never seen\nmy dad cry ever in my life and if I did\nsee him cry I would cover his eyes even\na funeral or something mm-hmm so I've\nnever seen that side of my dad never\nseemed like the vulnerable side of my\ndad and yeah so what a lot of kids like\nmy friends they got hit by their fathers\nyou know just a discipline thing it's\nlike common in the Middle East but the\nthing is I didn't know that I was being\nabused so I thought it was normal\nbecause I'm a child I've never\nexperienced a life other than the life\nI'm experiencing right now so as a child\nthere's nothing else I experience to\ncompare it to so when I asked my friend\nzio does your dad beats you like yeah he\ndoes be like okay so I'm not the only\none but the thing is he's not beating\nthem with a shovel in the face that's\nthe difference yeah and so or throw a\nrock in my eye yeah or throw a rock at\nfull speed in my on my freakin skull\nright I'm surprised I'm not at least to\nmy knowledge I'm not damaged my brain so\ndoesn't seem like it hopefully not but\nyeah so the abuse got really bad\nhe never hit my mom so I think he knows\nhis limits right like he doesn't hit a\nwoman because like that's like it's a\nprop\nhe's a very proud man or whatever I I\ndon't hit women etc etc but he's very\nabusive to her in other ways like\nvocally so the only source of affection\nI've ever gone was from my grandma\nbecause even or somewhat my mom but both\nof them were working for the most part\nand so me my brother were left home with\nthe housemaids that would take care of\nus\nand then you know when my dad comes back\nhome it's a gamble whether he's gonna\nbeat us or not if you had a bad day or\nnot so and I would try my best to go to\nmy friends house or whatever to not take\nthe chance you know what I mean if he\nhas a better day\nand sometimes like the most common way\nthat would cause him to beat us as if\njust if he's taking a nap and me and my\nbrother like having fun playing a game\nor something and then we wake him up and\neat and that's it we wrapped a Wiccan\ncurse right we're [ __ ]\nyeah yeah curse away my body um so yeah\nlike it got really bad like like when I\nsay abuse it's not like slapping it in\nthe wrist or whatever it's like like\npunched in the face full force by a\ngoing grown man so and my brother got it\nworse whatever I got my brother got\ntwice twice as so why is that because he\ncould take it I guess he's so so he's at\nleast when we were younger so since the\ntwo years mattered when it comes to our\ngrowth when I was like four he was six\nhe was like way taller right now I'm the\ntallest in the family I'm the I'm the\nlargest I'm even taller than my dad but\nI think growing up I think that's why\nbecause my brother was taller he was\nmore my brother was a more of a brat I\nwas a very nice child I was very quiet\nvery chill I didn't speak a lot and\ndisobey a lot if my dad tell me to do\nsomething I'd be like yes sir and I'd do\nit my brother would be he would make his\nsighs sounding like like what you say\nyou know what I mean mm-hmm so sorry I'm\ngetting shaky talking about this I don't\nusually talk about this but what are you\nfeeling sorry shaky like nervous um I\ndon't know like fear is I'm thinking of\nthe past and like the emotions that I\nused to feel that I dropped away for a\nlong time is that what you're feeling\nyeah yeah I think motions that I that I\ntrapped that I tried to escape\nI guess I'm leaving I'm revisiting and\nso JJ you know it's kind of weird it\nseems like you were able to tell most of\nthe story about yourself without me it\nseems like the most emotion that you\nfelt is when you started talking about\nyour brother really yeah I do love my\nbrother I mean do you think things have\nare you feeling more over the last like\nlet's say 60 seconds or 90 seconds as a\nas opposed to the first part\nyeah I'm not sure if it's because of my\nbrother because I'm getting more more\nmore deeper into the into the\nconversation mm-hmm yeah I'm not\nshutting it could be\nI do love my brother I think actually\nnow that you bring it up I always had a\nsoft spot like even if I do something\nwrong or if my brother does something\nwrong let's say like he beats me or\nsomething I would feel bad cuz I would\nknow if my dad finds out he's gonna kick\nhis ass and so I would try to say like\nno I just fell or something that's how I\ngot the bruising oh because I didn't\nwant my I don't want my brother to take\nthe fall and getting a beat up for it\nfor it and so a lot of times like even\nlike two of my stitches I got I've been\nstitched six times not even not on this\nfront from my dad but two of them went\nfor my brother and not because he beat\nme but because he did an accident like\nmistake so we're playing hide and seek\nand I was going up the closet and I want\nto hide with him in the closet and as\nout as I was climbing up he was tickling\nmy armpit and then oh yeah I was telling\nyou stop like he I was laughing so hard\nhe wouldn't know I was serious like I'm\nlosing my grip and I'm like stop stop\nbut he wouldn't\nI was laughing and he thought was funny\nI end up slipping I felt like full force\non my back and then inertia or the\nmomentum like judge over my head back\nand hit the corner of a wall and then I\ngot stitches in the top of my head\nthat's one that's one way he got me\nstill she's another way he threw like a\nsharp object but landed in my head that\ndidn't priests my brain thank goodness\ngot stitches because of that but both\ntimes my debt to this day does not know\nthe heat caused yes I didn't tell\nso-and-so yes yeah God sorry I if you\nlet me I will talk forever that's the\nthing yeah you can stop me yeah I mean\ndo you talk about this stuff often I've\nonly speaking I've only spoken about it\nonce with my therapist okay how long\nthey're pissed\nof for a year how's that going well this\nis going pretty well but she she\ndiagnosed me with PTSD which I don't\nreally think I have just because so just\nfast forwarding like after so going back\nlike my dad\nhe stopped abusing us when he made a\nfriend made a friend but I started\ntalking more to one of his closer\nfriends who's a very religious Muslim\nand he's known him ever since he was a\nkid and he was like teaching him to be a\nbetter Muslim and like he have two teeth\ndo you have to like treat your family\nwell etc etc and so after that my dad\nstopped being us um and you know there's\ntwo there's two ways one could I guess\nrespond to this one way would be like I\ndon't forgive you dad for what you've\ndone and the other ways like the other\nones like I forgive you and I just want\nto move on and you know have a better\nrelationship with you going on cuz now\nhe's a good father\nlike I don't complain about him he's a\ngood dad\nso a good dad even when we use abusing\nyou yeah I would say he like good dad\nnot in a sense that he was emotionally\navailable or but he did take care of his\nfamily at the end of the day so like he\nhe he the only reason so so like the two\nresponses I said like forgiving him and\nmoving on and not forgiving him that's\nkind of scrubbing me and my brother I\nforgave my dad even though my dad never\nasked for forgiveness\nI know deep down inside he regrets the\nthings he's done but my brother to this\nday is not forgiven my dad\nand so I forgive him because I know my\ndad has went through the same [ __ ] as we\ndid he has you know what I think we're\ntalking about today what are we talking\nabout I think we're talking about your\nbrother really yeah\nhow do you feel about that um I actually\ndon't know how I feel about that let me\nask you something do you do you feel\nlike your brother protected you from\nyour dad yes I can see that yeah yeah my\nbrother's always been there for me like\nhe's he's been a person that I can\ndepend on at all times\nso he's the type of guy that would drop\neverything to to help help his family\nout especially me my mother he's like\nhe's like the second in charge basically\nso it sounds like you in a lot of ways\nyour your brother is what a dad is\nsupposed to be yeah true yeah\nyeah he was like I'm so I'm very close\nto my brother actually before I came to\nhis call was talking to him asking like\nwhat's up back home you know how how are\nyou doing cuz he just he just finished\nhis master's degree he got his degree\nyesterday so it's congratulating him and\nall that so how's he doing he's doing\nwell so far there's a lot of things\ngoing on back home they are not good and\nso he has to take care of that mm-hmm\nI've been stressed well this is gonna\nswitch gears real fast but my mom's\nrecently found out that my dad's been\ncheating on her for the past 10 years so\nshe wants to get a divorce and and she's\nbeen emotionally like broken\nand my brother has to be there for her\netcetera\nshe's like doing very she thought very\nnegative she like she had negative\nthoughts like maple most suicidal etc\nand my brother I'm like yo like you\ngotta like be there for her etcetera\netcetera so it he has more things to\nworry about because he wants to get a\njob because my family's financially\nstruggling because of all this and I'm\nnot getting any college I'm not getting\nany scholarships whatever to attend here\nlike my mom's taking out loans to to\nsupport me coming here yeah so my\nbrother is very stressed but you know I\nknow he can handle it and yeah that's\nhow he did that's he's he's fine\nI'm just he's just worried more about my\nwe were both worried more about my\nmother than ourselves really haha\nbecause like our mom is like very very\nvery important for us to us yeah I'm\ngonna just think for a second is that\nokay JJ yeah of course so I mean I I'm\ngonna just start tossing stuff out so I\nI think you know you you mentioned that\nyou're looking for guidance about what\nto do after you finish college mm-hmm\nI think we're talking about your brother\nI think we're talking about his\ncapability that you know he's capable I\nthink we're talking a little bit about\nyou shirking your responsibilities by\nletting him handle things I think we're\ntalking about whether you should go back\nor whether you should stay whether you\nshould prioritize your own career we're\ntalking about whether you should put\nyour life ahead of your families and\nwe're talking about your guilt in terms\nof letting your brother handle what\nmaybe you're a big man enough to handle\nnow are we talking about mm-hmm exactly\nabout that yeah so right now my dad is\npressuring me to find a job in the US\nand initially so\nI'm taking an extra semester so this is\nI was supposed to graduate in May mm-hmm\nbut I took an extra semester to minor in\nbusiness because I didn't know what I\nwant to do and it seemed like everything\nwas moving too too quickly and I didn't\nhave a chance to make it choice whether\nif I want to go back home or stay here\nand so since I had a student visa and\nit's hard to obtain um I was like I'll\ntake advantage of it and and take an\nextra semester mm-hmm so I don't know\nwhat I want to do because everybody's\nadvising me even my mom my brother boy\nsomething like stay there get a career\njobs are harder to get or good jobs are\nhard to get in the Middle East\nit's full of nepotism and all that stuff\nand so I'm like stuck I'm like in a rut\nyep so I can I like\nthere's a lot of there's also selfish\nreasons for me to go back home like I'll\nadmit like it's gonna be more\ncomfortable for me because I'm my\ncountry a small country I know\neverything about it I'm getting more\ncomfortable in it my friends are there\nour girlfriends there you know and so\nit's easier for me just to go back home\nand get a degree in like hey you know\ntell tell people or employers I studied\nin the u.s. I'm an asset to your company\nasset etc another option B is for me to\nstay here like everybody telling me to\nbecause there's a better opportunities\nfor me and even if I'd like my dad says\neven or my brother both of them are\nsaying even if I don't end up living in\nthe u.s. at least working for a year or\ntwo is gonna help my resume immensely\ngoing back they'll have the\ninternational experience basically you\nknow so\nthat's that's where I'm stuck I'm\nlooking for jobs I've been applying I\nshould got response today from one of\nthe careers and so like my major is\ncomputer information systems so it's\nlike a lot of coding and stuff with some\nbusiness on the side but the thing is\nI'm not passionate about programming I'm\ngood at it but I just don't like doing\nokay and you know so that's something\nI'm struggling with as well so JJ I mean\nI I think like I mean we can talk about\ncomputer information systems in your\ncareer and all that stuff as much as you\nwant to I don't think that's why you're\ncoming here today mm-hmm I think I think\nwhat we're talking about today is\nselfishness versus sacrifice mmm-hmm and\nI think we're talking about your\nstruggle about whether you should go or\nwhether you should stay and and who gets\nhelped and who gets left behind\nyeah so fill that in like I'm just\ntossing out words right I'm tossing out\nlike themes but I don't know I think\nyou're way forward and I don't know if\ntwitch chat is gonna understand like\nwhat what I mean by that\nit's clear to me that you understand\nwhat we mean by that I just don't know\nif we've laid things out and Twitch's\nfollowing along or if it's just like too\nvague mm-hmm okay so so yeah tell us\nabout that fill in the gaps for us so if\nI go back home I'll be able to this\nsummer I worked part time I went back\nhome the past summer I worked back home\nas a videographer that's my passion I\nlike doing video stuff video editing and\nall that and so I worked part time and\nmy boss offered me a full time so if I\ngo back home now I will get a job that's\nnot an issue and I can like my mom will\nfeel like some weight off her shoulders\nbecause she knows she doesn't have to\nfinancially support me being away and my\nsister who was studying in the Emirates\nshe wants to be a dentist she's also\nlike my mom is telling her her jewelry\nand all that just so she can support my\nsister right now and so if I leave if I\ngraduate and go back home that's one\nless person she\nfinancial support and that's gonna help\npearl a ton and I can get money and I\ncan work and I can pay off her help her\npay off her loans and debts right that's\nthat's one thing I can do for my family\nif I stay here that means I will still\nneed more financial support even if I\ngraduate it doesn't I'm not gonna get it\nimmediately once I start working I might\neven just get an internship and unpaid\ninternship by still thinking you know\nSUNY [ __ ] all that I'm sorry we just\ncut out there for a second keep going\nyeah so what was it was last thing you\nheard economic so so you you were saying\nsomething about even if you stay here\nyou're gonna need some degree of\nfinancial support and then I didn't\ncatch the details around that yeah so\nI'm still gonna need financial support\nbecause I might get an unpaid internship\nposition so I will still need support\nfrom from my family to get an apartment\nand all that for the duration of the\ninternship okay and then like you can't\nget a paying job because getting a visa\nthat's what yeah gotcha\nnever mind okay yes but go ahead yeah\nand so if I getting an unpaid internship\nand the longer means I'll get a visa\nfrom the company and followed up by a\nfull-time position that's a less risky\nroute for me even if I have to get some\nfinancial support early for the for the\nduration of the internship which is\nprobably three months but it's also a\nrisk in a sense because I don't know how\nguaranteed a full-time position will\nfollow up after yet but it's still gonna\nbe good for my resume I think it's a\nwin-win situation if I get the\ninternship I get the work visa I still\nhave I can make connections I can have\nit in my resume and I can go back home\nwith with with a powerful resume so\nthat's that's sacrifice if I stay here\nit means I'm sacrificing the the like\nhelping my family out by being there for\nthem\nI can I can drive\nback home that means I can help my mom\nand get her stuff she doesn't have to go\ndrive around everywhere I can do a lot\nof things by being there physically and\ngetting a job there but it's not gonna\nbe the best career choice for me\npersonally okay that's better trade off\nso you mentioned your mom is financially\nsupporting you does your dad work\nmy dad had retired might have had a\nsuccessful career and he retired very\nearly he retired when he was 40 he's 50\nsomething he thought I was 43 even\nthough he had more opportunities to make\na lot of money but continued to work and\nhe chose not to because he values he\nsays he values his life and he wants to\ndo the things he wants to do which is\nwhich it seems to be fishing every\nweekend and going fishing and every\nweekend but what he's been doing\nrecently he built a an apartment\nbuilding so he's at Landlord now but he\ntook a lot of loans for that from his\nfriends and from the bank and now and\nnow he has some tenants and he's\ncurrently working on paying loans back\nI'm just a little bit confused about you\nyou talk about your mom and dad as if\nthey're separate financial units they\nare yeah that's the issue\nmy mom always support my mom works at a\nbank she works in HSBC and she always\nshe was like the the backbone of our\nhouse she would support the house by\nbringing food every week I'm in\ngroceries and all that she supported us\nin school because my dad didn't want us\nto go to private school he want us to go\nto public school my mom was like no I\nthink private will be better and he's\nlike okay if you wanna do that he could\nhave to pay for for the private school\nshe's like fine and she did it and so it\nseems yeah so my mom is a hell of a\nwoman she's amazing so she she has been\nsupporting abandoning was her must be\nhard yes that's very hard and she's she\nI feel bad because I'm helpless\nin case of helping her financially I\nwant to be successful nor to help to get\nher like the car she wants or whatever\nshe wants you know because she's been in\nher entire life if I mean we don't have\ntime for talking about her life but her\nentire life has been a sacrifice like\nshe's been sacrificing the sake of her\nown family her parents financially and\nthen now for her kids she never had time\nfor her own how do you feel about that I\nfeel sad yeah every time like I I pray\nlike my Muslim prayers I like pray for\nher all the time\nso she's she deserves a lot and you know\nwhat bothers me what it really annoys me\nlike when we talk about religion she's\nlike I don't know if I'm if I'm gonna go\nto heaven like I might go to hell who\nknows I'm like mom if you're gonna go to\nhell there's no way I'm gonna go to\nheaven so give me a chance you know tell\nme you're gonna go to heaven just so I\ncan think I can get a chance to go there\nbecause there's no I get to go to heaven\nand you get to go to hell God has done\nsomething wrong I mean we have to switch\nplaces you know what I mean like so yeah\nshe's an angel\nso she's supporting i yeah she's\nsupporting me financially she works at a\nbank she's still the only working person\nin the family and she's very stressed\nlike she's a good boss and she's she's a\ngood and she works well she doesn't\nshe's good at her job but it's taxing on\nher cuz I see her working every night\nfrom home\nshe's like a workaholic and like she has\nthe things are on her eyes to black and\nI don't know blackness on her eyes\nshowing it she never gets sleep she\nsleeps like three four hours a day she's\nalways tired so she yeah so she\nfinancially supports me and she and my\ndad's also has been taking money from\nher as well okay I gave me this money\nfor I need it for the building and I'll\npay you back and sometimes he doesn't\npay back and it gets annoying with my\nmom my dad lucky I'm doing it for the\nfamily cetera cetera so\nwith the whole I feel really angry\nbecause I feel like my dad can be very\nhypocritical so like I don't understand\nhow when you changed to be a better\nfather you couldn't change to be a\nbetter husband and you still maintain to\ncheat on my mom after you changed right\nI don't understand that\num so dad sounds like quite the [ __ ]\nyeah but he's very wise like he's a good\nlike my dad is a wise he's very wise he\nlike he some of the life lessons I like\nI remember him teaching me things that I\nstill remember to this day like what for\ninstance\nwe were in the car one day and my dad\nasked me it's like I was like eight or\nnine and he asked me like do you want to\nbe what do you wanna be in life and I\nsaid I want to be a millionaire you know\nI want to have a lot of money and he's\nlike how do you want to do that and I\nsaid I don't know I'm gonna make the\nbest video game ever\nor something like that I forgot the\nanswer and he says look at the building\nlike we're driving he's very he loves\nteaching by examples and metaphors and\nhe likes he likes asking questions\nrather than teaching me something like\nthis is how you do something he'd like\nto ask me a question making and he makes\nme ponder like wow I see what you mean\nso he's like you see this building like\nyeah it's like how do you get to the\nroof do you just fly up to the roof and\nhe's like and I was like no what do you\ndo is like you take the stairs or you\ntake the elevator you go step by step\nit's like exactly so don't think about\nlife the way your thing like oh I'm just\ngonna make a video game and I'm gonna be\nrich that's not how life works you got\nto take the stairs it's gonna be tiring\nespecially if it's a like a tall\nbuilding like the one you were asking\nwhat millionaire is not an easy task and\nso that's one of the things I remember\nanother thing do you think he'd mind the\nstairs yes he my dad has a had a\nterrible life I would say and this is\none of the things what one of the\nchoices\nremember I said I chose to forgive\nforgive my dad even though he didn't ask\nfor forgiveness the only reason I was\nable to forgive my dad it's because my\nmom told me about his upbringing\nand his upbringing was very bad so like\nhis dad married three women not at the\nsame time\nfirst one passed away very early and so\nhe married another woman shortly after\nshe had a lot of kids and she died as\nwell giving birth to her last child and\nthen he made my my direct grandma and\nthey had a lot of kids so my his father\nwas about his 60s when my when my dad\nwas born hmm and he was very sick and so\nmy dad didn't have a father figure all\nright\nhe never had a father figure and he had\nolder brothers so when he was born he\nhad brothers that were like in their 20s\nand so those are the ones who are taking\ncare of him and they would beat the crap\nout of him so this like as bad as he\nwould beat us so they would hang him on\na ceiling fan like a pinata and smack\nhim that's how that's how bad he got\nsome fact as a kid and so he he's a he's\na my dad is a very handy man like that\nhis his family was dirt poor he would go\nto the bike repair shop and look at the\ngarbage in the bike repair shop and get\nlike pieces like spare parts for the\nbike and make his own bike on his own he\nwould learn on his own hmm see so he can\nanything he can throw at him he can fix\ncar engine boat engine air conditioning\nwhatever so he was his survival he was a\nsurvivalist and that's why he became\nsuccessful because he was the only one\nwho finished school from his you have a\nlot of positive things to say about\neveryone in your family yeah how do you\nfeel about yourself uh\ncan't catch a break Oh like the abuse\nwhen I was a kid and then I was also\nvery obese as a child I was very fat I\nlost most of my weight back in I was 250\n50 pounds yeah\nhaiji I got to 20 2015 I used to walk\nevery day for half an hour or two an\nhour and just eat better so mixing sound\noffice this is my sound okay hello I can\nhear you fine okay yeah I'm not sure so\nwe'll see but so so you feel you say you\ncan't catch a break like in what way\nlike I don't feel like like all my life\nI've been stressed I don't feel like an\ni I've ever felt like relaxed or content\nwith where I with where I was like I'm\ngoing through a hair loss right now my\ndad is bald so I'm guessing his genetic\nbut he lost his hair he started losing\nhis hair in his 30s I started losing my\nhair when I was 18 when I'm when I came\nhere for college okay and so and I'm\nsure you know the concept of halal food\nright like kosher halal I don't have any\nhalal food here to enter the chat if\nthey're confused halal food is basically\npermissible food for Muslims and so\nthere's not any halal meat here in\ncollege so I became like a vegetarian\nalmost I just eat salads every day I was\nvery malnourished when it comes to\nproteins and stuff and so my hair loss\nis accelerating and that that really\nlike hurt my self-image because I\nstopped the care and I still like be\nproud to take care of my hair and all\nthat and I'm losing it\nbut at this point I really don't care\nlike about my hair like you know I sew\nso I'm okay hold on let me just I'm\nsorry if I'm all over the place I don't\nknow it's not sure it's not your fault\nso I think um so first let me tell you\nwhat I'm seeing\nokay so like you painted me a picture\nthat is over\nonly positive and loving right so like\nyou're talking about the sort of\ndesperate situation but when I hear you\ntalk you're smiling a lot you're talking\nabout how inspiring and sacrificing your\nmom is how inspiring and and wise your\ndad is you're talking about how awesome\nyour brother is you know it's kind of\nstrange because of the situation that\nyou're describing is is not a great one\nand yet your mind always turns to things\nthat are positive and inspiring like\neverything you're saying leads me to\nbelieve that you know making a decision\nlike when I think about people who are\nstruggling with decisions I think I\ndon't think about someone who is\nlearning lessons and has great role\nmodels and is filled with like love and\nappreciation for their family that\nusually leads to sort of some sense of\nsecurity or direction in life and yet\nyou're talking about positivity like\neven I mean you're kind of saying you\nkind of say like oh I'm angry with my\ndad and then when I kind of reflect that\nback to you I kind of say like he kind\nof sounds like an [ __ ] like your mom\nis working double shifts and supporting\nyou and he's out fishing and taking\nloans from everyone including your mom\nand then when I call him an [ __ ]\nwhat's your response\ndo you remember honey I try to empathize\nyou say he's a really wise man and and\non the surface I think it sounds like\nreally saintly for you to forgive your\ndad right it sounds like the kind of\nthing that your mom would do and and I'm\njust not getting like any negativity\nfrom you but your life should be full of\nnegativity I feel like the negative\nthing right now or there's two things if\nI there's another gonna take a turn but\nthere's two things right if I didn't\nthink the abuse I was getting was normal\nbecause I thought it was normal because\nsometimes half my face will be purple\nbecause of the smacking you'll get right\nif I did the thing I was normal now as I\nwas getting abused I would probably not\nbe alive today\nlike that's just being serious I thought\nwas normal I didn't know it was\nI was being abused I don't know I\nthought I was going through this so I'll\njust be a [ __ ] if I you know thought\nabout suicide whatever right and so that\nlets just me being real and that's how\nit was as a kid not mean looking back\nwhen I went to therapy yeah\nso I'm gonna jump in right there mm-hmm\nso like I'm mentioning to you that you\nseem to be like very inspiring and\npositive despite this very difficult\nsituation and you say that it's\ndifficult but I'm not hearing you use\nthe language of difficulty everything is\nlike about growth and learning and\nwisdom and sacrifice and then when I ask\nyou that the for some reason your mind\ngoes to if I didn't know I was in such a\nbad situation\nor if I knew I was in such a bad\nsituation then I may have become\nsuicidal but I thought it was normal so\nlike that's kind of a weird thing to say\nin response to what I'm pointing out to\nyou so why do you think you said that I\nI think that was a precursor to what -\nto what - yeah so like the second part I\nwas gonna say like right now I feel very\nlike me thinking about the past and the\nthings that I went through it's kind of\naffecting me right now because I feel\nlike I blocked that part up like of my\nlife off and then now it's coming it's\nrushing to me like a flood yeah\nsometimes I would cry like when I would\nsleep or I dream about my dad beating me\nthings like that which I some things I\ndidn't experience ever I have insomnia\nso I can't sleep without the TV being on\nyes something like I struggle with\nI'm very lethargic now especially my\nlast my last semester I feel like very\nlazy and I just want to get a job and\njust I don't want to study anymore it's\nlike yeah yeah so like this is kind of\nweird so like I don't know how to\nexplain this to you but you know\njay-j like you should have rage in your\nheart you should have like frustration\nand anger in disappointment I think you\nhave guilt\nI think guilt is the only thing you've\ngot that's the only thing I'm really\npicking up from you but there should be\na lot of other stuff mm-hmm like your\nunderstand that your dad so I think it's\na very mature outlook to have to\nrecognize with him and also like do you\nforgive him for what he did for it to\nyour mom you know how do you feel about\nthat I'm very mad about that and he\ndoesn't know that I know see my dad my\ndad really loves his kids and he cares\nabout what we think about him yeah he's\na very proud man yep he I cannot be\nnever like even when I argue with him or\ndebate with him about the religious\ntopic or whatever political topic Lusaka\nchol he doesn't like losing and he\ndoesn't admit when he loses and he tries\nto I don't say he loses often I keep I\nthink I think he loves you guys but I it\nsounds to me like he's quite\nnarcissistic yes yes very much so and so\nmy my he doesn't want he doesn't want\nand he has a special place in his heart\nfor me out of all of his kids my mom\ntold me this because he feels like out\never since I was a child I was obedient\none like I mentioned earlier I was a\nbeating I would say yes sir\nand so he doesn't want me to know that\nside of him he doesn't want to know the\ncheating side of him like he would he\nwould Gary I'm gonna jump in okay let me\nask you something what what do you what\ndo you think is the right thing to do\nfor my mom know divorce him what is what\nis the right thing for you to do in your\nlife take care of my mom okay\nin what way I want her to does that mean\nstaying or going she\nwants me to stay that's not what I asked\nI don't know how I can help let me ask\nyou this so everyone is telling you that\nstaying is the right thing to do right\nwhat would your dad do in your situation\nwho would stay that's why it's hard for\nyou that's why it's hard for you because\nyour mom is telling you don't come back\nestablish yourself and then you can help\nme\nyour brother is saying I can handle [ __ ]\nand you feel filled with guilt because\nyou're leaving him to pick up the pieces\nbecause he's the one who takes the blows\nright he's the one who takes the blows\nfor you so he's saying I can help out\nmom you see he's stressed you she sees\nshe's stressed and he's doing the thing\nthat he's always done for you which is\nlike tank\nhe's the tank your mom is saying you\nshould stay and you want to go and the\nthing that I think it makes it really\nhard you're telling me that objectively\nthe right move is to stay for your\ncareer I think the reason that you can't\nbring yourself to stay is because that's\nwhat your [ __ ] dad would do that's\nthe problem and so like if you stay you\nbecome him and you can say as much as\nyou want to about him being wise but\nlike I don't think you want to be him he\nis the last person on this world that\nyou want to be like you know you once\ntold me that like you know you earlier\nsaid that like your mom is worried about\ngoing to hell and you were kind of\nsaying if you go to hell then I don't\nknow I have no chance of getting into\nheaven and I think that there's like a\nthere's like a flipside of that which is\nlike you don't think your dad should go\nto heaven no I think my dad should go to\nheaven okay\nI I don't wish hell on anybody and this\nis gonna sound like this is gonna sound\nlike very controversial but I don't even\nwish hell on Hitler even though like cuz\nno I I think that makes sense yeah hell\nis eternal punishment yeah III think on\nbalance you can it's completely\nreasonable and I think you can be a\nperson that really doesn't want to wish\nill on anyone\nand at the same time I think there's a\npart of you that wishes that there's a\nlot of negativity towards your dad\nmm-hmm and I I think that this this\nreally comes down to like you don't want\nto be if he ends up in heaven you want\nto be in hell like it's like the flip of\nyour mom and I I sense that current and\nyou and I think the problem here is that\nit's it's like buried beneath so much\nlike positivity and it's it's buried but\nbeneath a lot of compassion and it's\nburied beneath a lot of maturity but I\nthink it's there like I find it hard to\nbelieve that that it's not there I think\ngive me a second let me let me like it\ndig into my because I I'm bad at at like\nrealizing my emotions I think that I\nreally do love my dad I think you do too\nand part of my brain is saying you\nshouldn't because of the things he's\ndone to you and it is doing to your mom\nright but I don't feel it yeah so here's\nthe problem\nit's not that you shouldn't it's that\nyou should feel other things as well so\nI think the problem is that your\nfeelings are one dimensional like the\nquestion that I have for you JJ is do\nyou hate your dad no can you love and\nhate someone yes so then the question\nbecomes why don't you hate your dad I\nthink it's because I've only seen one\nside of him like like two sides of him\nright one side is him being very abusive\nand that's the side that I blocked for\nmost of my life after that in a sec and\nthe second side of is him being a very\nvery good father to me this is the side\nthat I want you to think about for a\nsecond the side that act that side that\ntells your mom if you want our kids to\ngo to private school you [ __ ] pay for\nit and then the side that tells your mom\nhey I need some money for the business\nthis is for the family and then he\ndoesn't give it back\nhow do\nfeel about that guy I feel very angry\nabout that guy do you hate that guy\nyeah it doesn't like it doesn't it\ndoesn't go with the guy I see and that's\nthe problem right I hear stories about\nhim I hate their stories about him I\ndon't I don't see him doing the axe\nbecause I can only have one type of\nrelationship with my father and that's\nfathered a son I don't have a wife to\nhusband relationship with my father\nobviously because I'm nice wife but you\nknow I can't yeah just his son so the\nway he talks to me is different than we\ntalks to my mom and so I only hear from\nmy mom and I feel angry and I empathize\nwith her but then when I went on goes on\nI go I'm back to squirm which is I love\nmy dad yeah so I think that you have to\nunderstand the negativity like the thing\nthat's buried here and the thing that's\nhard for you I think is the absence of\nnegativity you feel some degree of guilt\nbut like I think at the end of the day\nyou know you've got to first of all\nunderstand that like the reason that you\ndon't want to stay is because that's\nwhat your dad would do because that\nfeels like the wrong thing but like\nyou've got to come to terms with that\nand that it may not be just because it's\nwhat your dad do doesn't mean that it's\nthe wrong thing but I think the reason\nit feels like the wrong thing is because\nit's what your dad would do like you\nhave to understand that staying doesn't\nmean becoming your dad mm-hmm yeah I I\ndo I do not want to be like my dad so\nand I told my mom this like when she had\nmy baby brother I was this was yeah I\nwas like 16 17 just right when the abuse\nstopped and like I told I told my mom I\nnever if I ever had kids I never want to\nhit them ever because I know how how\nthat feels right now said I don't think\nI said emotion I'll ever forget and so\nmy brother was born I made a vow to\nmyself to never hit him I'm the only one\nin the household who's never hit him\neven my mom like I said I don't mean\nlike he's been like if you used like\nhe's like smack in the hand or the\nmaximum that I've done is yell at him\nand so there was a very hard\nworming moment for me which made me cry\nand I asked my brother and this is like\nI got like I mean this is like a PTSD\nthing there's no way I and I understand\nwhy my Sheriff this brings up PTSD but\nwhen I asked my brother like why do you\nlove me right I said I said you love me\nsaid yeah I love you so why do you love\nme said cuz either you never beaten me\nand like Wow\nlike imagine loving someone because they\nhave not beaten you they don't love you\nbecause I mean me I'm sure he loves\nbecause I'm nice to him and all that\nlike I by him like but the first thought\nhe things like initially as a kid right\nkids are very harness you saved a lot of\nwise stuff but I think your your mind is\ncircling around the problem everything\nyou're saying like what do you just tell\nme like what is that story me not\nwanting to be like my father\nyeah and it's also inspiring and\npositive mm-hmm so I mean I think you're\nyou're just you're swimming in\npositivity which i think is like very\nlike it's bizarre it's like sort of a\nit's a very mature thing to do but I\nthink it's actually holding you back and\nthat's causing you a problem because\nyou're saying like I don't want to be\nlike my father I don't want to be like\nmy father but what you've got to start\ndoing is like stop living in comparison\nto him right you have to make a decision\nabout whether whether you go or you stay\nbased on your life in your family and\nwhat you want to do and and you have to\nreally sit down with your mom and your\nbrother and like understand that like\nyou're leaving like that the problem\nwith like you staying here is that\nyou're leaving them so can you make that\ncan you make that sacrifice is it okay\nto like leave them to manage their own\n[ __ ] because you're filled with guilt\nand it's guilt that's causing you to go\nback and generally speaking you know I I\nthink it's it's good to put your your\nfamily first like I think that's an\nimportant thing and it's an important\npart of your entire Amma I just wonder\nfor free if you go back today how much\ncan you support your mom if you go back\ntwo years from now how much you can you\nsupport your mom how much can you\nsupport your brother\nand that's why I that's the conflict\nright because if I go back now I can\nshort-term help them but long term I can\ndo way more by staying here and helping\nhelping yeah so I mean I think that's\nthe conflict but I think if you want to\nresolve this conflict you've got to\nunderstand the negativity because you\nunderstand the positive part of it very\nwell there is another issue to it though\nso like when it comes to my degree and\nmy passion that's another struggle I\nhave a conflict I have because like I\nsaid you know I'm graduating with a\ncomputer information systems degree but\nI'm not passionate I'm good at coding\nbut I don't think I like it as a I would\nlike it as a career I'm more of a\nproblem solver critical thinker etc I\nreally love philosophy so like I like\nyou know reading my Immanuel Kant or\nNietzsche or whatever but so so and I do\nlike video doing video um you know\nthat's one of the things I am passionate\nbut I've been doing it since I was 12\nI used to edit called DD montages my\ncrappy laptop and put him on YouTube and\nI used to teach as a 12 year old\nactually this is funny this is one of\nvideos I made on YouTube is still up\nthere it has like eighty thousand views\nand I was like twelve teaching somebody\nhad to convert an mp4 file so I can so\nyou can use it in Windows Movie Maker so\nI have a passion for video but it\ndoesn't pay well and it's hard to get a\njob for a video but I have a degree in\nsomething that pays well but I want\nsomething in between\nI wanted something in business that's\nwhy I'm minor in your business like\nmanagement or something because I feel\nlike I can lead people okay so Jay Jay\nlisten yes I don't think you're gonna\nget the kind of satisfaction that maybe\nyou were hoping for because I I think\nyou're skirting around the issue like I\nkeep on saying the same thing to you and\nyou keep on changing the subject what am\nI saying to you\nthat I should stay here no I'm saying\nthat you've got a grapple with your\nnegativity but I can't it's hard I don't\nknow that's why that's that's exactly\nwhy you keep on talking about other [ __ ]\nso like I want everyone to understand\nthis when there is a hard decision you\nface your mind will run to anything it\ncan to complicate the situation you'll\nadd as many variables as you can to the\nequation you're gonna make any time\nyou're faced with a difficult decision\nthat you don't want to make your mind is\ngonna try to add as much complicating\n[ __ ] as you can because then you can\nlike you start talking about oh but I\nwant to like do videography and it's my\npassion and like but this pays better\nlike what should I do because like I'm\ntelling you like like JJ your problem is\nthat you have to decide whether you want\nto be an [ __ ] to your family that's\nyour decision mm-hmm because that's what\nit's gonna feel like and you have to\ndecide like do I want guilt in the\nfeeling of not being an [ __ ] to like\ncontrol what I do or can I come to a\nplace where I can say like okay I'm\ngonna stay and acknowledge that I'm\ngonna leave my my brother and my mom\nbehind but I'm really doing it for them\nand like it's gonna feel bad for a while\nand I'm not like my dad that I'm really\ndoing this for them and not just for\nmyself I think I've come to accept that\nthe rest of it I think is details I mean\nI think you can you can come up to\nwhatever kinds of other things you want\nto talk about like oh like should you\nfollow your passion or should you do\nwhat pays I mean I think in your\nposition I would do what pays and then\nlike do my passion on the side like\nthat's what I do I don't think like you\ncan I mean I like I have a job and then\nI do this because this is my passion I\ndon't think the two are mutually\nexclusive and I think if you get if you\nget good at your job like if you're\ngonna work it like see is like I imagine\nthat involves some amount of coding and\nyou're gonna probably be paid like\nhourly or based on stuff and I think if\nyou're as good as you say you are you\ncould probably get paid for 40 hours a\nweek and work 20 and on 20 you do\nvideography on the side like that's the\nwhole point behind getting a salary job\nis you get\nreally really good at it and then you do\nyour own [ __ ] on their dime that's how\nyou game the system so I don't think\nthis is like an either/or I think you're\n22 yeah\nyou're 22 you've got 40 years of work\nahead of you and you can develop your\npassion start making like I don't know\nif you know this but like people get\npaid a lot for video editing nowadays\nyou know you can make a lot of money\nlike through videography you can be like\na contract videographer on the side and\nhave a day job that pays your bills\nbecause that's your Dharma that's what a\nman does right your mom needs your help\nso [ __ ] helper mm-hmm and I don't\nknow what's go yeah so I mean I think\nyou're you're gonna figure that out like\nso I think I get what you're saying in\nterms of uncertainty so the other thing\nis you're religious so like is Allah in\nyour corner is he helping you out yeah\nokay so have some faith in that right\nlike you can decide whatever you want to\nbut what makes you think you have it\nlike why do you think you have control\nthe thing is I don't feel like I have\ncontrol yeah so you just choose you make\na choice and you deal with the emotional\nfallout I feel like time is running out\nthough like yes no of course in November\n20th and yeah I gradually December see\nyou make a decision what's the problem\nwith making a decision JJ commitment\nyeah I mean commitment I think the\nbigger problem is you're afraid of\nmaking the wrong decision yes that's the\nbig one that's the big problem so like\nyou can't make the wrong decision though\nwhy can't you make the wrong decision um\nbecause they're only two good things\nmaybe because you don't [ __ ] know\nlike how can you blame yourself for\nmaking the wrong decision if you don't\n[ __ ] know yeah I'm also I was going\nto say I'm also a very pragmatic person\nand so I try to a part of me says there\nare every human being has a limited\nnumber of routes they can take in their\nlives right you\nyou could have been a barber and not a\npsychiatrist right\nsure you could that's a route that's a\npossibility once your mind doing right\nnow JJ that's taking me away from the\nissue absolutely but it is a struggle\nbill right of course it's a struggle\nbecause I I think I have so many\npossibilities I want to say here's\nhere's the problem JJ you're trying to\nfigure this out so that there's a right\nanswer\nthe reason you're paralyzed is because\nyou will do whatever kind of pragmatic\ncalculating statistical philosophical\npsychological you will just chew this\nstuff up until you come out with the\nright answer the basic problem is that\nyou're uncomfortable with uncertainty\nyes\nI don't like not having the answer so\nthat's what you've got it grapple with\nlike you've got to just understand that\nlike this is not gonna get fixed you can\ntry to like read a manual Conte all you\nwant to you could talk to some [ __ ]\npsychiatrist on the internet and like\nyou were like you're coming here and\nyou're hoping that someone is gonna give\nyou an answer so that you can make the\nwrong right decision if you're if you're\nthis is for you and everyone at home the\nway to move forward in life is not to\nfind the right decision that's like the\nlike risk-averse strategies are not how\nyou become successful you become\nsuccessful by doing and then like\nlearning damage control it's not\nprevention it's damage control if you\nwant to be successful in life just get\nreally good at damage control can you\nexpand on that what do you mean by\ndamage control that when you [ __ ] up you\nknow how to fix it mm-hmm like I I don't\nthink that there's an objectively right\nanswer here even there's there's not\neven a psychologically correct answer\nlike because if you stay sure your\nearning potential is greater but like\nthe whole h-1b visa situation is like\nthat's up in the air man like that's not\na reliable bet like you could stay for a\nyear everything could get [ __ ] up it's\nthere's really no way of knowing and so\nthe thing that you've really got to do\nJJ is understand that uncertainty is a\npart of the equation that sometimes in\nlife you just have to like make a choice\nand just see what happens and thankful\nwe you're religious so somewhere along\nthe way you've lost faith like I don't\nknow when that happened but it's clear\nto me that you don't you've lost faith\nlike Allah is looking out for you so\njust do what you're gonna do and\nunderstand that you could make the wrong\ndecision and understand that whether you\ngo so sometimes like for example you're\ngonna find your way as long as you try\nand as long as you keep at it and as\nlong as I think you face your negativity\nbut you're just you're looking for like\na safe safe solution like this is like\nyou remember when you were a quiet and\ngood kid that's what you're being right\nnow you're just being like quiet and\ngood like how can I figure out like\nwhat's gonna make everyone happy like\nhow can I figure out how to not rock the\nboat like that's what you're trying to\ndo in your life but your boat is in it's\nin like stormy seas it's gonna rock your\nfear of that is actually like the\nbiggest problem like you've just got to\nface uncertainty fine so I'm gonna say\nsomething that's that's probably the\nmost ridiculous thing and then\nunfortunately we're gonna have to stop\nsoon but but that's I don't think it\nmatters what choice you make because I\ndon't think you get to control what\nhappens like I just don't think you do\nlike I don't from the situation that\nyou've laid out I think it's a really\nchallenging conundrum you're in I just I\ngenuinely do not think there is a right\nanswer because on the one hand you have\na high degree of uncertainty if you stay\nthe h-1b visa stuff is really up in the\nair so like there's no one's gonna tell\nyou that that's a corner quote the right\nanswer and then there's gonna be like a\nhigh degree of uncertainty if you go\nlike your career options are gonna get\nnarrowed quite a bit you could become a\nmillionaire through like cutting YouTube\nvideos by like you could do that but you\ncould do that either way right I think\nthe thing that you've got to start doing\nis having faith in yourself that there\nis first of all acknowledging that there\nisn't a right answer and there isn't a\nwrong answer and this is a big problem\nthat I see with all kinds of gamers it's\nlike they're not willing to apply to\ncollege until they know they're gonna\nget into the one that they want they're\nlike oh yeah like I'm not gonna apply to\ncollege cuz like it's gonna be I'm gonna\nbe ashamed if I don't get into like a\ngood university mm-hm so they want they\nwant everything to line up to be per\nbefore they take action it's not gonna\nwork there's some amount of\npsychological stuff we can talk about\nright like you don't want to stay\nbecause you're abandoning your family\nand that's what your dad does and you're\nnot gonna be like him fine you could\ntalk about that through that with your\ntherapist it's a wonderful revelation\neye opening and your situation doesn't\nchange that's when I realize you\nactually don't have a psychological\nproblem you have a problem of\nuncertainty and fear you also have this\narrogance that like you think that you\ncan figure things out because you've\nbeen good at that so far right you\nfigured out like how to act so that your\ndad minimized the amount of time that he\nhit you you didn't just take chances\nlike you don't take chances so that's\nwhat you've got to learn like you're\nyour barrier is one of like dealing with\nuncertainty and understanding that\nsometimes in life you have to roll the\ndice mm-hmm I know it's wholly\nunsatisfying for you but that's the\n[ __ ] point because if you're looking\nfor satisfaction like that's not gonna\nhappen the whole point is that you need\nto learn how to make decisions without\nsatisfaction you're coming on here and\nyou're saying like Oh like but I don't\nknow what to do now yeah and you're not\ngoing to ever but you can't let that\nstop you from acting do you have like\nany advice on how to stay in the moment\nbecause I'm always a future-oriented\nperson I can never watch the meditation\nstreams right yeah so meditation is the\npractice that brings your mind to the\npresent moment and and we'll do some\nmeditation today but I think like the\nchallenge here is that you've got a you\nknow you've got a I mean it's tough but\nyou have to practice it it's a skill and\nI know that your mind is very\nfuture-oriented because you just love\nyour mind can think about possibilities\nand equations and how if you do this and\nthen this can happen and then this can\nhappen and then this can happen what if\nI do it this way this can happen and\nthis can happen can this can happen if I\ndo it this way this can happen this can\nhappen this can happen your mind is\nspending all of this energy going\nthrough hypotheticals and building\nfantasies in your mind and it prevents\nyou from actually acting at the end of\nthe day you're spent and you're actually\nnot this is important to understand\nyou're not\nany closer to the actual solution even\nthough it feels like all of those\nthoughts are bringing you to solution\nit's just like today we're like I'm\npushing you to the solution and then\nyour mind is like oh but I forgot to\nmention this and like even at the\nbeginning you were like okay I have to\nstart off with a bunch of [ __ ]\ncontext and you should watch my facial\nexpression go back and watch it I was\nlike what the [ __ ] I saw I saw that is\nthere it's like that's no the context\ndoesn't [ __ ] matter but your mind can\nchew on that context it's like it's like\nthe meal that never ends\nfor your mind and you just think and you\nthink and you think and you think and\nyou think and you think and you think\ninteresting it's exhausting and it\ndoesn't get you anywhere so just do make\na decision understand that it could be\nthe wrong decision and there's no way of\nknowing and have some faith okay that's\nwhat I got well thank you very much I\nmean I came here for guidance and I got\nsome guidance on what on being content\nthat I can't choose or or solidify any\noption that I have to just go with go\nwith the flow you know yeah just I'm\naccepting that and if it's wrong you\nadjust if it's wrong you adjust that's\nthe skill that you need that's the\nconfidence you need to have in yourself\nif it's wrong you adjust an and let you\nknow in a few months whoa let me know\nyou can you can come back on stream and\nwe'll see depending on the quality of\nyours what what continent hey who knows\nI'm a good India my grandpa loves India\nokay well if you go there than the your\ninternet connection will be just as\nit'll be unclear it could be as good as\nthe US could be as bad as Bahrain I have\nno idea what far aids Internet is like\nbut but listen this I will tell you JJ\nso first of all I think you're an\nawesome guy and I can't you know it's\nit's hard to go through what you've gone\nthrough and I think it's really\nremarkable it's kind of telling cuz next\non we're gonna have feral and we're\ngonna talk to fair all about and\ntrolls in the internet and holding on to\nhatred and I think you've done an\namazing job of not being able when you\nhave every right to be and that's really\ncommendable think and I don't think like\nyou're like your dad so I want you to\ntake some comfort in the fact that I\nreally don't think you can abandon your\nfamily even if you try it's just not you\njust are not that person\nyeah and and that basically what you and\nyour family are doing is they're they're\nrolling the dice right they're making a\ngamble and all of you guys need to get\non the same page about like which way do\nyou want like where do you want to place\nyour bet on going your home or on\nstaying and either one you can be\nsuccessful either way and I think it\njust takes a couple of years to figure\nthat out I don't think you're locking\nyourself into a career for the rest of\nyour life you can do video and I'm\nserious like any kind of programming job\nyou can do your programming and then do\n[ __ ] on the side mm-hmm so I don't I\nthink their problem is that you're\nthinking about an either/or it's not an\neither/or it's just about how to do both\nso I don't accept your premise that you\nhave to choose between the two like you\nhave to choose between the two like\nright now sure but six months from now\nyou can be doing both you can find\ncontracting jobs for CIS you can do\nContracting jobs for videography and you\ncan make that transition um last thing\nthe only reason I feel like I have to\nmake a choice and I agree with you like\nI can do either it's just easier to make\na choice now because of I let's say I\nend up going back home it's harder for\nme to come back to the u.s. and it's\njust logistics base it's not like\nfinding it hard psychologically or hard\nto make a decision is just logistically\nif I go back home getting a visa and\nconvincing an employer hey get me back\nto the US h-1b visa over somebody else\nit'll be harder so being here in the\nu.s. having connections and in Korea\nphrase and all you could tell me all the\nstrategic reasons to make one better the\nother I think that's fine I don't think\nyou're gonna find an answer yeah no I\nagree yeah yeah\nso don't feed that part of your mind\nokay okay just keep us keep us posted\njust know that the Jay Jay I have faith\nin you I think you're gonna be okay and\nI think that you're a good human being\nand it sounds\npretty smart it sounds like you just had\na minor amount of brain damage so you\nonly speak and you know so but that too\nis like that's you know I talk about\nkarma a lot you could talk about the\nwill of Allah you could talk about Karma\nI think it's all the same Tamiya that's\njust how it is and I'm sorry that you\nknow there isn't an easy answer for you\nbut that's what that's what Allah wants\nfor you he wants you to be a put your\nbig-boy pants on and make a decision\nruin yourself true okay thank thank you\nman keep us posted really I want to know\nwhat happens yeah yeah I'll be in chat\nright now as well so ok here all right\ntake care of bye"
