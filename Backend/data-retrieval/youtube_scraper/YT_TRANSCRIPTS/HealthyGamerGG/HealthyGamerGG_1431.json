    "transcript": "there is no such thing as a first step\nthere is only a step there's only the\nstep that you can take that's not a\nphilosophy that is an actual reality\nyeah but don't try it next week don't\nknow much you're like try tomorrow\nlike you guys need to start today yeah I\nI can't believe I'm about to say this\nbut the subs giving it away it's like\nthrowing me off because of the sound but\nI understand that I'm supposed to\nencourage this behavior I mean so so I\nthink you guys should do right but like\nunderstand that\nso try is the problem don't try do or\nfail I'll take either of those either of\nthose are fine like failing is fine the\nproblem is trying trying is the problem\nyou do you don't have to succeed like\nfailing is great failing is fantastic\njust do or [ __ ] up like fail or succeed\nbut do one of those two things try is\nlike in the middle try is like tries\nlike it's like the [ __ ] future killer\ntry is a thing that prevents you from\nactually doing anything it don't try\njust do it and [ __ ] up like failure so\nthis is a very common problem where like\npeople think that the way that you get\nconfident is through success but you\ndon't get confident through success you\nget confident through failure right\nthink about that for a second like when\nyou screw up and you survive and you\ncome out on the other side and you're\nstill alive like that's when you get\nconfidence it's like oh wow like I fell\ndown oh look I can get back up again\nthen you don't have to be afraid of\nwalking right just just do something let\njust try and then if you don't mean I\nsay try do it and then fail and then\nlike look at it understand it what\nhappened what happened why did I fail\nlike what actually happened was it\nmotivation was a discipline was it\nwillpower is it because and think about\nthis - because gamers think that they\nwant all this stuff like you guys want\nstuff yeah like I want a [ __ ] yacht\nlike I said I want a jet plane you know\nI want like like this mic setup to work\nproperly I want\nall that stuff but like what isn't gonna\nget you anywhere Lane north shouldn't\nbecause I also work with people that\nwant a lot of things and they are not as\nlazy and they don't they're not happy\nlike this is the other big thing is that\neven if you accomplish your wants you're\nnot gonna be happy and people here are\nsaying the hardest part is taking that\nfirst step like this is what y'all also\nhave to understand every step is the\nfirst step there's only one step to be\ntaken it's not the first step\nthat's like future-oriented thinking\nwhich is wrong it's like where does\nclimate change gonna be fixed in the\nfuture wrong it's gonna be fixed now\nlike you go outside you plant a [ __ ]\ntree that's how it gets done future is\nan illusion of the mind understand this\nvery deeply like I know it sounds crazy\nbut I want you guys to really like sink\ninto this right so PI to Africa said the\nhardest part is taking that first step\nthere is no such thing as a first step\nthere is only a step there's only the\nstep that you can take that's not a\nphilosophy that is an actual reality so\nI want you guys to understand this right\nnow we are in the present and where are\nwe now in the present where are we now\nin the present where are we now in the\npresent this is the only thing that\nthere is and gamer's you guys your mind\nplays all kinds of tricks with you once\nyou incorporate the future because once\nthe future is a possibility you're\n[ __ ]\nright like once the future is a\npossibility then you could do something\nin the future like we didn't really get\ntoo much into this but I want you guys\nto understand that for Joro\nthe future is the problem he can move\nout one day he's gonna do it one day\nhe's gonna exercise one day one day one\nday one day one day one day no he can't\nexercise one day the only time he can\nexercise is now literally you cannot\nexercise except for right now so like\nunderstand that you guys have to be in\nthe collective present is the only place\nthat exists and the more that you try to\nsolve problems in the future like no\nwonder they're not getting solved\nbecause you're [ __ ] solving them in\nthe play\nthat doesn't exist so people are asking\ncan't future thinking be helpful\nabsolutely\nlike you don't accomplish much without\nthinking about the future right so like\nI couldn't stream if I just randomly\ndecided when to stream like I have to\nschedule so it's absolutely apart like\nso the future thinking mind is one\nfunction of the mind that needs to be\nunder your control right you should\ndecide when the future thinking mind\ngets to run the show and when it doesn't\nthe problem is that for a lot of people\nthe future thinking mind runs the show\nit says what we're gonna do it later\nlike that's what procrastination is\nprocrastination is an overblown future\nthinking mind consequences in the future\nbeing overblown does what we call\nanxiety all of the problems of the mind\nare normal functions of the mind that\nhave taken control from you"
