    "transcript": "like I [ __ ] you guys not like I'm really\nnot trying to toot my own horn but there\nare people that are in my practice that\nhave been on treatment for like have\nbeen in therapy and medication for\nanxiety for like 15 years\nand within six months we're taping in\nthe off of medication they feel\nfantastic why is it because I'm a\nbrilliant clinician no this is what I'm\nsaying I'm not actually any better it's\njust I use tools that none of my\ncolleagues use I use higher data\nso I rather so Eyre by this traditional\nIndian medicine and differs from Western\nmedicine and a couple of very important\nways the first thing to understand about\nWestern medicine is that it's about\ndividing in zooming in so Western\nmedicine is about classification zooming\nin sub classification further\nclassification so for example we have\ndifferent kinds of doctors right I'm a\npsychiatrist which means in the grand\nfield of medicine I've zoomed in on the\nmind and I've specialized in that and\nthen even further I'm an addiction\npsychiatrist so I zoom in on addictions\nand I specialize in that and even more\nthan that I'm sort of like now becoming\nmore and more of a technology addiction\npsychiatrist so I'm like zooming in\nfurther and like learning more about\ntechnology addiction so that's how\nWestern medicine works we sort of divide\nthings into groups like cardiology\nnephrology hepatology infectious disease\npsychiatry endocrinology pediatrics OB\nOB gain right so we divide things into\nlots and lots of categories and then we\ncome super specialize in one category\nAyurvedic ompletely different Ayurvedic\nis not about zooming in it's about\ngenerating patterns from multiple data\npoints so it's kind of looking at\ndifferent dimensions of a person in\ntrying to figure out how can we make\ncorrelations based on their physical\nbody about what's going on in their mind\nis there some way that we can understand\nsomeone's bowel movements and how that\nwill affect their mind is there a\nrelationship between how prominent the\nveins on the back of their hand are like\nI don't know if you guys can see this\nbut like my veins are kind of visible\nand what that says about their mind is\nthere a correlation between how cold\ntheir hands and fingers and feet get and\ntheir valve movements is there a\ncorrelation between their mind and their\nskin so Ayurvedic sat like lots of\ndifferent dimensions of a person and\ntries to develop an overarching pattern\nthat describes that individual so that's\nlike fundamentally different from\nWestern medicine because what we do in\nWestern medicine is we try to break\npatterns apart and zoom in and\nunderstand individual elements it's like\nhow does the heart work in this person\nwhat\nthe principles of the heart you know so\nit's just it's like the exact opposite\none is zooming in and one is building up\nthe other big difference between\nAyurvedic in Western medicine is like if\nwe think about the gold standard of\nknowledge in each system of Medicine so\nin in Western medicine or allopathic\nmedicine the the standard that we use\nthe gold standard of our medicine is\nsomething called a randomized controlled\ntrial this is abbreviated as an RCT so\nan example of a randomized controlled\ntrial is I take 10,000 people and let's\nsay I'm trying to figure out depression\nthen what I do is I split them into two\ngroups a control group in an\nintervention group and they give 5,000\npeople an antidepressant and I give\n5,000 people a sugar pill then what I do\nthe reason we called it controlled is\nbecause we try to make the two groups\nthe same we try to have them have the\nsame socioeconomic status the same\naverage age the same gender breakdown so\nwe try to remove a lot of the\nindividuality so we can isolate the\neffect of the disease and the treatment\nso we're trying to get treat depression\nnot individuals and we're trying to use\nrandomization and controlling for\nvariables to remove any individuality\nfrom the equation so I'm trying to just\nlook at a disease in isolation and a\ntreatment in isolation and see what the\nimpact of the the treatment is on the\ndisease so what this means practically\nis that Western medicine is not about\ntreating people it's about treating\ndiseases and so that sort of like you\nknow if you've sort of trained in\nWestern medicine you may think that\nthat's the best way but as you learn\nclinical medicine you begin to realize\nthat like people are fundamentally\ndifferent right like even if I prescribe\nI'm a psychiatrist I prescribe\nantidepressants from time to time try to\navoid it whenever possible but one of\nthe things you quickly learn if you\nprescribe medication is that medication\neven though like antidepressants will\nhave a moderate improvement in clinical\ntrials for people an individual may get\nbetter or may not get better at all if\nyou give them an antidepressant there's\na lot of like individuality that enters\nmedicine the funny thing is that our\nsystem of medicine doesn't sort of\nfactor that in\nwe don't really factor in individuality\nin terms of our clinical trials and the\ngold standard of our information so I\nread is fundamentally different because\nI rather like treats a person it\npresumes that all human beings are\ndifferent and that in order to like help\nsomeone you have to understand like\nindividually how they function so I'll\ngive you guys kind of an example\nso I rubella divides all people into\nlike these three you have this thing\ncalled a Doric balance and door shows\nare sort of the three three major\npatterns that kind of govern what people\nare like\nso our Vedas says unlike Western so I\nread that says that individuals have\nlike a cognitive fingerprint that is\nlike different and that different\npeoples have different different people\nhave different kinds of cognitive\nfingerprints what do I mean by a\ncognitive fingerprint when we think\nabout Western psychology we tend to\nthink that all human beings sort of have\nlike the same psychology right if you\nstudy psychology you don't study like an\nindividual you a study like the\ndifferent like patterns of psychology so\nyou study like motivation you study\nthings like habit and you study things\nlike you know let's say like hedonics\nyou study like cognitive behavioral\ntherapy you study like these general\nprinciples about the mind and like\ncognitive behavioral therapy applies to\nlike everyone right you study kind of\nlike one thing and it sort of assumes\nthat it works for everyone because\neveryone's mind has cognitions has\nemotions and has behaviors and that\nthose three things are related ayurvedic\nthat everyone's mind is unique and that\nin order to help people we have to\nunderstand what kind of mind they have\nbecause the kind of treatment or\nintervention that we want to use depends\non the kind of mind that they have so I\nstarted using this phrase cognitive\nfingerprint and I use this idea of\ncognitive fingerprint which is like your\nunique cognitive makeup and once we\nunderstand your unique cognitive\nfingerprint we can structure your life\nor your diet or your environment to fit\nwith your cognitive fingerprint and one\nof the biggest problems that I think a\nlot of gamers\n- is that they assume that they're lazy\nare they're not functional or they do a\nbad job because they're using sort of a\nstandard gold stent they're using gold\nstandard of what it means to be\nsuccessful like a standard cognitive\nfingerprint so I'll give you an example\nlike they think that you should be\ndisciplined they think that you should\nbe focused they think that you should\nwake up at the same time every day they\nthink that you know these are the things\nthat lead to success\nwhereas ayurveda says actually that's\nnot that's just one route to success and\nif your cognitive fingerprint is\ndifferent that the way that you can like\nbe successful is to kind of play to your\nstrengths so I think this is gonna be\nway easier to understand once I actually\nexplain it starts explaining specifics\nso the first thing is that they're three\ndoshas Vata Pitta and kapha so Vata is\nkind of like the wind it does kind of\nlike fire and Gotha is kind of like\nearth okay so this should work great for\ngamers because these are like the\nelements of your Pokemon right so like\nif you have a bot the mind you're like\nan air Pokemon if there's an Interpol\ncome on or like grass or some [ __ ] right\nif you're a pit the Pokemon you're like\na fire pokemon if you're a Pokemon\nyou're like an earth or water pokemon so\nI'll give you guys an example so vatos\nare like the wind so I'm super Vata so\nvodkas have memories and mindsets that\nare like the wind so I get really really\npassionate very easily like I blow I'm\nlike a gust of wind so I get super\nexcited and I say that I'm gonna teach\nabout Ayurveda today and I get super\nhyped up about it and I blow really hard\nabout Ayurveda and then like a week\nlater just like the wind I just randomly\ndie down so my mind gets super excited\nabout stuff and then like randomly dies\ndown so I get really I get excited about\nstuff but follow-through is very\ndifficult for my mind\nother examples of vadas include like\ninterests that change very quickly so\nyou know like a month ago I was reading\na bunch about Carl Jung and now I'm like\nokay I'm done with you I'm ready to move\non to something else and so that's a\nanother example so interests like the\nwind the other thing about vadas is that\ntheir their mind learns very quickly so\nas much like the wind can blow really\nhard in one direction so if you drop me\nin a random like job within two or three\ndays I'll be really good at it\nso when I was like in medical school I\ndid a really great job because like it I\nlearned super fast\nthe downside to Vata is that you forget\nsuper fast too so Vaught the memory kind\nof like is easy to learn and easy to\nforget so when I meet people people\nthink I'm super smart like you guys\nthink I'm super smart and then like the\nproblem is that like if you know me for\na while I'm not gonna seem nearly as\nsmart as I come across like at the very\nbeginning because vatos are super\ndynamic and their memory like we just\nlearn things very quickly but we forget\nthings very quickly\nother examples of Vata so remember that\nira that says that like your mind has\ncorrelations with your your body so\nvadas are also what we call people with\nfast metabolisms so if we look at if we\nlook at like people's physical bodies we\nknow that there are three groups of\npeople like you could sort of just look\nat people and everyone knows this the\nfirst is that there are people with fast\nmetabolisms so I can basically eat\nwhatever I want to and I'm not gonna\ngain a whole lot of weight then there\nare people who have medium builds and\nthen there are people who are what we\ncall big-boned so medium builds are fit\ndoes and big-boned people are guffaws\nand so cover people who are like big\nboned\nthey can eat salads every day and\nthey're still gonna be chunky that's\njust there that's what their Ayurvedic\ndough short of dictates and Vata people\nare gonna always kind of be thin the\nother thing about Vata body types\nis that like they have angular features\nso if you look at my face like my nose\nis like very like angular right it's\nlike sharp the features of my like my\nface is sort of angular and if you if\nyou guys saw like for example on the\nlast stream we had Joro which by the way\nJoro did do his stuff which we'll talk\nabout in a minute but we had someone\nnamed Jorah and arose a classic gafas\nlike he has a very round face like I\ncan't even like grow a full beard so\nVoth a--'s have very like scant facial\nhair whereas gafas have like full facial\nhair\nand devathas also use their hands a lot\nso like I use my hands a lot when I'm\ntalking my mind also jumps around a lot\nlike for example just now I just\ncommented about Jordan I was like oh\nyeah like I want to say something about\njor and then I'm kind of coming back so\nif I thought are sort of like they have\na mind that's like ADHD so compare that\nto Pippa's who have a memory that's sort\nof like sharp and clear but those\npersonalities unlike being they're not\nthey're not as dynamic is about those\nbut they're very driven they're very\nfocused but the bit the mindset is a\nvery argumentative so if you guys have\nseen Tom on stream like he's a good\nexample of a pizza he's kind of like\nmedium build not very skinny not very\nfat he also like believes that like once\nhe understands something that's the way\nit is so like bit does have a difficulty\nbetween understanding like opinion in\nfact like if they if they have logically\nconcluded something they think that that\nis objectively correct so that's like\napp it though whereas vodkas can see\nlike all the different angles around a\nsituation because their mind is kind of\nlike the wind blows this way okay I feel\nthis way one day I feel this way one day\nI see this person's opinion I see this\nperson's angle I can understand this I\ncan understand that whereas bit those\nare like they're very driven and focused\nso a lot of what we think leads to\nsuccess in life is a bit the mind driven\nfocus ambitious follow-through they also\ntend to have medium features not\nparticularly anger angular not\nparticularly round and when it comes to\ngoals they can be a little bit like pit\nbulls like once they grab on to\nsomething it's really hard for them to\nlet go the third door size is something\ncalled toughie\nso cava is like earth and water so gafas\na lot of people that I know you know\nthink that they're not smart when\nactually they're just gafas so one of\nthe things to remember about Gotha is\nthat they learn slowly but they also\nforget slowly so gafas take time to like\nget up to there they have like slow\nacceleration but they can hit very high\nvelocities whereas vodkas have very high\nacceleration and unlike very like high-\nacceleration and like low velocity at\nthe end of it so they take their time\ntoughies take their time to get\nstarted guffaws are also what we call\nbig bones so they tend to be heavyset\nit's easy for them to gain weight they\nhave very round features and goofus tend\nto be very very resilient so they can\nwithstand large amounts of like negative\nsituations and sort of handle that\npretty well because they they kind of\nhave like high constitutions or high\nendurance whereas like vodkas you can\nthink of as like people that are like\nlow HP pools and low endurance so like\nbuffers or tanks\nvadas are I guess like mages and like\nbit bizarre like DPS dealers so if you\nthink about like you know like like\nmelee DPS like that's a bit though a\ntank is a toughie and Navotas like a\nmage or like a very like dynamic rogue\nor something like that and we're talking\nabout Ayurveda by the way so I'll just\ngive you guys so that's kind of like a\nbrief overview of the three Brook\nRuthie's and we'll kind of dive into\nthis a little bit more so people who are\nVata tend to get like bored of\nsituations very easily they have\ndifficulty with follow through so one of\nthe most important lessons I learned is\none of my teachers once told me that\nwhat I should do is like as many things\nas I can so they were kind of telling me\nthat I should juggle as many balls as I\ncan at the same time without dropping a\nsingle one and when I was in college\nlike I started out doing a bunch of soft\nmy freshman year like I ran for student\ngovernment joined a bunch of clubs\njoined a fraternity took a bunch of like\nrandom classes like I took Japanese and\nSpanish and like chemistry and like all\nkinds of random stuff philosophy and\nthat's like a super Vaught that way to\napproach life you're kind of doing a\nbunch of stuff and then over time like I\ndid bad at all of it cuz I was just\nplaying too many video games and like I\nfound that the more I kind of scaled\nback the fewer things I did the more\nbored I became and the more bored I\nbecame the less I felt like doing\nanything and so what one person told me\nis that as a Vata you need to do a\ncouple of different things because your\nmind is gonna be your mind is gonna be\nsuper dynamic\nso just understand that you're gonna get\nbored so now what I do is a psychiatrist\nlike once I understood that principle I\nrealize like I'm never gonna have a\nnine-to-five job I'm just never gonna\nlike if I just have a nine-to-five job\nand I do the same thing every day I'm\ngonna be like bored as [ __ ] and I'm\ngonna do a bad job at it so I realized\nthat I need a structure a dynamic life\nand I think a lot of gamers are very\nabout that so I'll give you guys an\nexample of like what my day job is like\nso I see patients I'm a psychiatrist so\nI see patients for somewhere between\nlike 2 and 10 hours a day I teach I do\nconsulting so I'll go to like an actual\ninvestment bank and I'll teach a group\nof bankers how to meditate I stream and\nyeah so like and then I also write so\nlike I try to do four or five different\nthings every week and I find that the\nmore diverse my skillset is like the\nmore I'm doing different kinds of things\nthe more I enjoy it because my problem\nis not like I never run out of energy\nI get bored so if things are interesting\nto me then I actually have a very very\nhigh amount of energy and I can work\nlike 80 hours a week as long as I'm\ndoing stuff that's engaging so in order\nto sort of build a life that structure\naround my cognitive fingerprint if I'm\ndoing one job for 80 hours a week I'm\ngonna do a terrible job I'm gonna just\nsuck at it like week after week after\nweek after week after week after week\nafter week I'm just gonna get bored like\nI'm already I've been streaming for\nabout two months and I'm already like\ngetting a little bit bored with\nstreaming because that's what happens\nlike I do something super gung-ho for\nlike a month and then I sort of don't\nfeel like doing it and so in order for\nme to be successful what I need to do is\nlike build a life that that corresponds\nwith my Vata mind so I need to be able\nto do as many different things as I can\nand still do them successfully so that's\nwhy I became a psychiatrist like if I\nwas a surgeon like it's really hard to\nwrite books teach and stream if you're\ndoing surgery it's way easier if you're\ndoing psychiatry because I have a\nflexible schedule and so I think if\nyou're about what you need to understand\nit's like you're gonna get bored easily\nso rather than just doing one thing you\nactually need to be doing as many\ndifferent things\nyou can successfully so one of the\nbiggest problems that I see with gamers\nis that they think like okay if you're\nstuck in life and you're like unemployed\nyou're not in school you're living with\nyour parents you kind of think that I\njust need to do one thing well right\nlike I just need to like get my degree\nor I just need to find a job or I just\nneed to move out of your my house and I\nshouldn't write a sci-fi TV show I\nshouldn't start a business I should just\ndo my school and everyone that you\ntalked to says that if you're going\nnowhere in life just like start with one\nthing and do that one thing well where I\nsay [ __ ] that if you're a Vata don't\njust do one thing that's the reason why\nyou're stuck is because your whole life\nyou're listening to this advice that is\nfor a cognitive fingerprint that is like\nnot your brain like your brain is not\nwired like that your brain is kinda ADHD\nso if your brain is kind of ADHD you\nneed to build a life that's kind of ADHD\nand so actually what you need to do is\nI'd say start your business enroll in\nclasses find a job and start writing\nyour sci-fi TV show do all four of them\njust dive right in and do as many\ndifferent things as you can and over\ntime you'll actually find that you know\nyou have to find the right sort of\nbalance so that that takes practice so\nyou have to figure out okay like if I'm\ngonna take you know half a class load\ncan I have like half a class load and a\npart-time job and then also like write\non the side or like develop like a\nGoogle analytic certification on the\nside so my advice for gamers who are\nsuper Vata is actually try to do more\nthan one thing because the reason that\nyou guys go back to video games is\nbecause you get bored of that one thing\nbut if you have something else that is\ninteresting and exciting that you can\nturn to instead of a video game you're\ngonna do way better the problem is that\nif you just enroll in classes like you\nget bored of classes by the end of month\none and then you start playing a video\ngame and then the video game has it's\nparticularly addictive properties and it\nkind of sucks you in and by the way\nvideo games are very satisfying to vatos\nespecially if you play like a lot of\ndifferent video games but if you think\nabout like an MMO like what how does an\nMMO like keep you engaged it's because\nan MMO is it's just one thing right you\nlike go and you like harvest\nflowers and then you spend some time on\nthe auction house and then you spend\nsome time doing like your twenty five\nman raids and then you spend some time\ndoing your five man raids you do some P\nP P V P like think about that for a\nsecond if you're addicted to an MMO if\nyou just did PvP all the time like\nyou're not vodka the reason that a lot\nof people fall into mmo's is because\nmmo's offer a really wide skill set like\nkinds of activities that engage your\nmind in different ways and so what I\nwant you to think about is think about\nyour life like an MMO and the more that\nyou structure your life like an MMO\nactually the better you're gonna do if\nyou have a lot about that so what you've\ngot to do is think about okay like what\nis my equivalent to PvP what is my\nequivalent to PvE what is my equivalent\nof auction house\nokay I'm gonna find a job where I do\nthis I'm gonna do this side hustle which\nis like selling domain names I'm gonna\ndo like a Google Analytics certification\nand I'm gonna enroll in classes like\nthat's how you should structure your\nlife do more not less and then\nunderstand that as you start to do\nsomething like prepare yourself for when\nyou get bored and as you get bored\nthat's completely fine just move to the\nnext thing that's like productive on\nyour list be like okay I'm tired of\nstudying let me like login and and do a\nfew hours of my google analytics\ncertification instructor your life to\nhave variety if you structure a life\nthat has a lot of variety then your Vata\nmind is gonna be satisfied from it and\nthen it won't need to turn to the MMO\nfor variety does that make sense so I'm\ngonna take a quick pause and just look\nat questions on discordant okay okay all\nright so are Vata immature no so this is\na classic example so someone is asking\nme avitzur immature no so this is\nbecause our society has a standard of\nmaturity we say that if you are not this\nway you are immature vatta's come across\nis immature but what I would say is like\nit's like imagine that you have stats\nlike for a May\nand then like you try to do like melee\nDPS like you're gonna suck at that and\nand you're gonna you're gonna you're\ngonna label yourself with being like bad\nlike immature do you guys get that\nimmaturity is like a label of just\nbadness it just means that you're doing\na shitty job at life whereas what you\nneed to recognize is that your mind has\ncertain strengths and certain weaknesses\nand the more that you structure your\nlife to be in line with your mind you're\nnot gonna come across as immature so I'm\ngonna tell you guys this very simply I'm\n[ __ ] lazy\nI'm not disciplined I'm [ __ ] lazy I\nstill love to play video games i\nprocrastinate I don't like to do work I\nplay video games instead of doing work\nI'm actually no different from you I\ndon't think my stats are different from\nlike pretty much anyone on stream I\nthink the biggest difference is that I\nunderstand I'm vodka I get it and I\nrecognize that this is the way that I am\nand then I structure my life to suit Who\nI am in my mind like strut like\nstructure to suit my cognitive\nfingerprint and if you start structuring\nyour life to be like design for your\ncognitive fingerprint we'll get to the\nother doshas in a second then you're\ngonna start to do a lot better so the\nreason that I'm successful is because I\nactually do a bunch of different [ __ ]\nand there are colleagues of mine that\nare like I don't understand so for\nexample I you know some of my friends\nfrom residency they're hardcore\nresearchers so they're like experts in\ntheir one field like I have a friend of\nmine who's just an expert in\nschizophrenia and she's like a\nneuroscience researcher does clinical\nwork with people who have schizophrenia\ndoes like research on people who do\nschizophrenia like just brain scans of\npeople who do schizophrenia and she has\nno idea like how I can manage she's like\nif I was doing all the random crap\nyou're doing I would suck at it and I\ncome back at her with the same thing if\nI was just doing schizophrenia day in\nand day out day in and day out day in\nand day out I would suck at it the\nproblem is that our society labels her\nis disciplined and mature and labels me\nas a [ __ ]\nwhich is sort of true\nthe difference is like at the end of the\nday like we both ended up training at\nHarvard Medical School and we're both\nfaculty at Harvard Medical School and so\nhow is it that both of us wind up at the\nsame degree of like professional success\nit's because I understand that I'm a\nVata and I created a Nevada life and\nthat she's a toughie and she created a\ncouple life and so you have to figure\nout what's your door sha and how can you\ndevelop a life that is structured to be\neasy for you right if you're if you've\ngot like mage stats like you want to be\ncasting spells you don't want to be like\nmelee dps in someone with a dagger but\nthe problem is that our society says\nthat like melee dps is the way to go and\nthen you also have your tanks who are\nlike we suck at melee DPS and so then\nthey look at themselves and they say\nlike I suck at life because I suck at\nmelee DPS what I'm trying to tell you\nguys is like well you're a [ __ ] tank\nso you're supposed to be doing a\ndifferent thing you have a different job\nand what I like about Ayurveda is that\nWestern medicine says that melee dps is\nthe only way to go this is success\nSociety says that this is the only way\nto go this is our Western society works\nright we think in terms of polarities we\nthink in terms of like good or bad we\ndon't really think in terms of shader\nshades of grey we think like Republican\nor Democrat we think like conservative\nor liberal we think about like\neverything is like a pull like a\npolarity and but that's just not how we\nare there's like like human beings are a\nspectrum and the more that you\nunderstand where you lie on the spectrum\nthe more you can understand how to like\nstructure your life in the right way\nyeah so then people are talking about\nmage tanks right yeah so you could be a\nbattle mage right you can be like like\nyou can wear heavy armor you can cast\nsome spells and then you can also like\nwheel the [ __ ] two-handed sword you\ncan do that so some people are by Doric\nor tribal shake and the thing to\nremember about people that are bi though\nShakur tried though shake is that\nthey're no like better or worse than\nother people it's just like if you're a\nbattle mage you're not gonna be as good\nof just a straight-up spell caster is a\nstraight mage you're also gonna be like\nnot have you're not gonna have the same\nweaknesses so my weaknesses in my\nstrengths are very very polarized I'm\nnot like a middle-of-the-road kind of\nperson I'm super vada and so if you're a\nbattle mage you're like you're like a\nguff up it Nevada right so you do some\nspell casting you do some melee DPS and\nyou're kind of tanky you're not gonna be\nas extreme as any people who are Vaught\nthat bit they're a toughie but you're\ngonna be like kind of like well-rounded\nso some some people are Doric like that\nso if you're not Vata let's go through\nthe other ones right so if you're pizza\nyou're driven your focus your\nargumentative I want you guys to imagine\nlike a dog that like latches on to\nsomething and doesn't let go so upsides\nof pizza or that they are like we think\nabout when we think about bit tha's like\nthat's what we think about is mature and\nsuccessful we think about people who\ndevote themselves to one career right\nthey're like I'm gonna be an attorney\nand they like work really hard and they\ngo to school they go to a good law\nschool and they're like super\nargumentative fantastic that's Pizza\ndownsides of pizza they're obsessional\nright so for you guys have seen like\nTom's stream and stuff like that tom has\nan obsessional mind he gets like super\ncaught up with stuff he can't let things\ngo so it's not like bit bizarre better\nthan vodkas we just have to understand\nthe strengths and weaknesses of each one\nso Fitness tend to be driven and\nargumentative but also have like a lot\nof problems with like anger and\nirritability\nso I fit this get bent out of shape they\ncreate a lot of like interpersonal\nconflict they rub shoulders with people\nthe wrong way they're gonna kind of like\nyou know when it comes to like\nadvancement you know they're hyper\ncompetitive which can kind of screw them\nover or allow them to be successful\nright so that's a bit though so that has\ncertain strengths in certain weaknesses\nand then gafas is like your tank so\ncoffees are stable they're resilient\nwhich means they can withstand a lot of\npunishment so if I would have quit two\nweeks in a pit that's gonna stick around\nfor some time and then like move on to\nthe next thing a capo will like stay\ntrue to whatever they're doing sometimes\nto the point of excess\nso the best friend that you can have is\na toughie and I want you guys to think\nabout the people that you know in your\nlife you know that person who you met\nwho is like intensely friendly would to\nyou and they were like man you are the\nmost awesome person in the in the world\nwe are best friends forever\nyou had this like really really intense\nfriendship with them you guys did\neverything and then they [ __ ] fell\noff the face of the earth they just like\none day they disappeared and then you\njust never saw them again\nand that's your Vata friend right your\nbitthe friend is the person who's like\npretty reliable you can count on them\nbut like it's just [ __ ] annoying to\nargue with them like you they get into\narguments with you about stupid [ __ ] and\nyou just can't like you're never gonna\nwin an argument with them because\nthey're just gonna never like listen to\nyour point of view that's a bit that\nyour cuff ax is the friend that you've\nbeen with for 10 years then the person\nwho's always been there for you they\nreach out to you from time to time you\nguys stay in touch or if you're that\nkind of person that's a cuff a friend so\nit's not like one is better than the\nother these are just different\ndimensions and so guffaws are resilient\nthey're stable like so you should\nunderstand that you're able to withstand\npunishment that a lot of other people\nyou have staying power you have\nendurance\nyou're gonna outlast other people and\nover time we've got for the problem that\nguffaws get into is that sometimes they\ncan they're so good at withstanding\npunishment that they don't make changes\nwhen they need to\nwhereas VAT does make changes when they\nshouldn't they're like okay I have a\ngreat job I'm gonna [ __ ] quit because\nI'm bored they should stick with it but\nthey don't guff us on the other hand\nfind themselves in a bad situation or\nlike a bad relationship and they like\nthey stick with it even though they\nshould leave so I'm gonna address a\ncouple of questions the first thing is\ncan people have like multiple amounts\nabsolutely so some people can have like\na Vata memory and like Agathe let's say\nlike hmm let me think about this so like\npeople can\nI'd be like have Gotha friendships and a\nVata memory like generally speaking they\nkind of lump together but everyone is\nfried or [ __ ] everyone has some level of\neach so I want you guys to imagine that\nyou have like imagine these are like\nstats so like instead of like strength\nintelligence and like constitution\nimagine that you have a vatos core a bit\nthe score and a cuff a score and\nactually there are you can hold on I\n[Music]\nthink I shared this with y'all right so\nhere's an example okay I don't know if\nthis is posted in our discord see so I\nwant you guys to think about these as\nstats\nright and everyone has like a certain\nnumber on each stat the other thing is\nit's not like higher numbers mean better\nthings so disease are problems in\nAyurveda arise when you're - when when\nyou're Vaught that when each of your\ndosha stats is too high or too low\nso I have a dynamic mind I learned\nthings very quickly and if my bot that\nstat like goes five points higher like\nlet's say my vadas like a 75 if it goes\nlike 10 points higher and I hit 85 then\nI have ADHD at that point my mind is so\ndynamic that it can't focus on one thing\nand it becomes like problematic for me\nwhereas my cuff a stat is like super low\nso like if I if my graph a stat drops a\nlittle bit more then I get like sick so\nI physically like get ill very easily\nlike I was a sick as a kid like it's\nlike kind of like you have a low\nconstant right like my poison resistance\nand my disease resistance and all that\nkind of [ __ ] is like really low anytime\nmy kids get sick I get sick\nmy wife is kapha so she like everyone in\nthe house can be sick and she's gonna be\nfine so like my immunity is weak so I\nhave like a low Cod stat high inte right\nso I want you guys to just imagine that\neveryone has like different levels of\nthese and you could be thrived or shake\nyou can be like in the middle for each\nof these and I hope if you guys take a\nlook at the question\nthere what you see is that there are\ndifferent dimensions and that like you\nknow you can have like Vata and memory\nand like gafas and friendships and like\nbitthe and career and that's just the\nway that you are and the way to become\nsuccessful in my opinion is not to like\nand this is this is the problem right as\ngamers think that there's one road to\nsuccess and you look at yourself and you\nsay if I was more disciplined I would be\nsuccessful if I was more like that\nperson I would be more successful if I\nwas different I would be more successful\nand I say [ __ ] that I say look at who\nyou are look at your strengths look at\nyour weaknesses and structure a life\nthat is designed to be fit you right\nlike if you're if you're a caster like\nif you're playing Dark Souls and you\nhave like mage stats like use spells\nand the problem here is that what you\nknow you guys just aren't playing To\nYour Strengths okay I'll stop using the\nword gamers so so play to your strengths\nyeah so I just posted the questionnaire\nin chat and then I'll post another one\nhold on so here's another example so\nhere's one that incorporates physical\nattributes as well so what we're gonna\ndo\nyou know actually what I think I'll do\nis just I'm gonna switch streams for\njust a second okay and what I'm gonna do\nso let me just modify some of this stuff\nokay we're gonna go to this\nokay we're there we go okay so here's an\nexample of the the bra critique\nquestionnaire okay so this includes\nphysical and mental stuff so if I don't\nknow if you guys can read this but this\nis wait so vadas are usually thin often\ndifficult to put on weight visible ribs\nmedium build good muscle tone is gafas I\nmean is fit those guffaws are larger\ndifficult to lose weight heavy bones but\nthe skin is dry cool thin but the skin\nis like oily smooth and warm with a lot\nof freckles or color in their face so\nyou guys should go look at Joro and look\nat the [ __ ] color in his face he's\ngot a ton of color in his face guffaws\nhave like thick skin cool skin oily so\nhair tends to be like thin kinky like I\ndon't know if you guys see this but like\nmy hair is like kinky as [ __ ] you guys\nsee this like it it it it kinks like you\nsee this action like it's not straight\nso bit does have like male pattern\nbaldness oftentimes and gafas hair is\nlike thick wavy oily lustrous so the\nother thing that's really interesting I\ndon't know if I'm gonna see if I can\nyeah kinky here I know so I want you\nguys to look at the top of my eyelid and\nsee how it covers like the top of my\niris that's classically Vata so there\nare even things like the more of your\niris you can see that's like bit does\nyou can see the entire iris of their\neyes and so there are all kinds of\nphysical oh this is great appetite there\nare all kinds of physical features so my\ndiagnostic question for vadas is are\nyour eyes larger than your stomach and\nwhat I mean by that is that do you get\nintensely hungry and then get satisfied\nwith a relatively small amount of food\nlike you feel like you can eat like a\nlike you know 10 pounds of barbeque but\nthen you eat like half a plate and\nyou're like actually I'm kind of full so\nthat's that's a classic Vata appetite\nwhere your eyes are bigger than your\nstomach and you feel super super hungry\nyou feel hungry erratically\nit does have sort of an excessive\nappetite guffaws have sort of a stable\nregular appetite bhavas tend to be prone\nto constipation Fitness can have\nindigestion and can have like acid\nreflux and like stomach problems Gophers\ncan have like you know kind of in the\nmiddle yes oh hey gizmo so now the\nquestion is so people are talking right\nthere\nlike people in chat or commenting about\nvarious attributes of Vata Pitta and\nkapha and so now like what would be\nfascinating is if you guys like go back\nand look at the comments that people are\nmaking and see if there's a consistency\nwith Vata right so gizmo has been saying\nthat that I think that they're pretty\nVata and so they're they're talking\nabout different attributes that are all\nabout that\nso vodkas are reactive yes they tend to\nbe very reactive one other question that\nI want to get to is someone asked about\nmyers-briggs so I do believe that\nthere's some correlation with\nmyers-briggs and the reason for that is\nvery simple for those of you guys who\ndon't know does anybody know what\nmyers-briggs is based on what's the\nfoundation of myers-briggs anybody know\nyou can be a chubby bother nope\nmyers-briggs is not based on the Big\nFive yeah so as Esther Q has it right\nbased on Carl Jung you know what this is\nfascinating you know what Carl Jung's\ntheories are based on did he come up\nwith them himself\nnope not Freud incorrect nope not\nNietzsche dake Moses has it correct Carl\nJung's theories are actually based on\nIRA and Hindu philosophy right so Carl\nJung studies Ayurveda and then comes up\nwith theories and then myers-briggs\nstudies call Jung and then comes up with\nmyers-briggs and so it correlates to\nVata Pitta\nso just think about this for a second\nremember that Western psychology assumes\nthat the mind is like uniform right the\nbody is uniform the heart functions a\nparticular way the mind functions a\nparticular way that's how it works and\nthen myers-briggs comes along and says\npeople are fundamentally different that\nnot everyone is the same way that\nthey're introverts and extroverts that\nthere are people who judge and feel\nright intuitive and perceptive that\nfundamentally there are different kinds\nof human beings where did they get that\nidea why is it so contrary to the what\nthe the rest of Western psychology\nbecause it's based on you because you\nsaid people are fundamentally different\nand then the question becomes where did\nyou learn it he studied Ayurveda so I'm\ngonna show you guys interesting book\nokay\n[Music]\nso here's an example so like Jung\nstudied a lot of Hindu psychology\nphilosophy and medicine he's actually\nlike or Indian Hindu whatever so I think\nthere are correlations so when I did\nsome myers-briggs training and did some\nstuff myself I was like oh this sounds a\nlot like Ayurveda yeah so if you guys\nare mixtures of stuff that's completely\nreasonable everyone is it has all three\nelements right you've got all three\nstats okay so now we're gonna move on to\nthe next thing so stress desert asks the\nperfect question can you alternate\nbetween the doshas absolutely so there's\nalso let me send you guys you guys want\nto see science is anyone wondering\nwhether anyone wondering whether there's\nany science behind this stuff like\nis this is this like just it's just\ntheory right there's no like science\nbehind it this guy's like he's one of\nthese complementary an alternative like\nhomeopathy Reiki people it's not real\ncome on can't be real\n[Music]\nright\nthere's no way so you guys want some\nscience there's the science okay\nso I'll tell you what these two papers\nshow yet some food is [ __ ] right the\nfirst is that what's what research is in\nIndia did there's a there's an emerging\nfield called IU genomics so researchers\ndid it as they said okay they gave a\nbunch of people these questionnaires and\nthey said like okay for all of the\npeople who are Vata let's check their\ngenome and for all the people who are\npizza let's check their genome and for\nall the people who are kapha let's check\ntheir genome and are there statistically\nsignificant correlations between your\ngenes and your daughter and the answer\nis absolutely yes\nthat all vodkas and just think about\nthis for a second people who are have\nfast metabolisms they have to share\ncertain traits our metabolism is common\npeople who are big-boned have a\nmetabolism that's fundamentally\ndifferent from people who are fast\nmetabolism so that has to be our body\ntypes any person can look at down the\nstreet and you can say oh there's a thin\nperson there's a person who's big-boned\nand there's a person who looks thin but\nthey clearly take care of themselves\ntheir thinness is not natural it's due\nto effort and you can just look at\nsomeone on the street and you can tell\nthere has to be a physiology behind this\nand that's just how it works so our vet\nhas been looking at this and so be this\nthe second paper that I sent you guys is\nvery interesting it actually correlates\nBrock ruthie which is what the Potemkin\nwith different kinds of metabolism and\ndiseases what they did is they\ncorrelated Brock ruthie like your Vata\nPitta and kapha and how likely you are\nto have a particular kind of chronic\ndisease so vatta's are prone to\nautoimmunity autoimmune disease is a\nvittatus\nbit bizarre prone to other kinds of\ndiseases guffaws are prone to things\nlike type-2 diabetes right so there are\ncorrelations now so now there's a\nthere's a huge area of research emerging\nin Ayurveda and the more that we study\nit the more that we scientifically\nanalyze it the more correct it turns out\nto be absolutely so yeah I want you guys\nto look back at like everything that\ngizmo has said gizmos textbook vada has\n[ __ ] lupus has ADHD mind is super\nVata has eyes that are larger than their\nstomach right like has an autoimmune\ndisease like I can't diagnose people\nover the internet but you know we kind\nof diagnosed gizmo over the internet\nlike I don't know anything about gizmo\nbut I can predict that the likelihood\nthat gizmo has an autoimmune disease is\ngreater than other people who are bitter\nor kapha so that's what's awesome about\nEyre venit like you can make predictions\nabout your life and if you if you sort\nof understand that then that's that's\nfantastic because you could start to\nlive accordingly so the cool thing about\nAyurveda is that if you do have an\nautoimmune disease if you do Vata\nlowering treatments your autoimmune\ndisease should get better right so like\nif you adjust your vato now we get to\nthe next thing which is someone was\nasking a little bit about changing your\ndoor shake level which you absolutely\ncan do so the next thing I want you guys\nto understand is that everyone has a\nprakruti which is your genetic amount of\nVata Pitta and kapha it's like the stats\nthat you are you are like created with\nso when you make a character like you\nhave a strength of 10 and into five and\nendurance of 25 then what I rather the\nway that I ever the treatment works is\nthat they modify your your your stats\nright they give you like buffs and\ndebuffs that raise your strength or\nraise your int or lower your endurance\nlike it's kind of weird because we just\nthink about strength attributes is being\npurely positive\nthat's called your Vic rupee so The Vic\nRuthie is the amount that your Vata\nPitta and kapha are deviated from the\nnorm\nso higher beta has treatments like food\nfor example there are some foods that\nwill lower your vat buffer Vata some\nfoods that will debuff your vada foods\nthat increase kava and decrease kava and\nfoods that increase pizza and decrease\npizza there are lifestyle changes you\ncan make is apoe4 pizza that is a great\nquestion I don't know but let's find out\nlet's do it let's see if I want to study\nthis that question is too good to derail\nme see this is me being bought that I'm\non a roll and then I just stop haha ah\n[ __ ] this is not a peer-reviewed article\nis this peer-reviewed article I don't\nknow what this journalists okay I don't\nknow that's a that's a great question\nI'm not sure okay so yes so people are\nasking if you're skinny fat so skinny\nfat is up it's just you being unhealthy\nand invite that like so instead of\ngetting big bone like vatos can be fat\nit's not like you can't be fat skinny\nfat is a Vata that doesn't take care of\nthemselves but they don't balloon like a\nguff up and they're not gonna get fat in\nthe same way that a bit that does\nthey're gonna get skinny fat right like\njust just look at that phrase skinny fat\nyou don't call yourself fat intuitively\nwe recognize that this is a different\nkind of fat we call it skinny fat it's\njust a completely different kind of fat\nit's not a big-boned fat it's a skinny\nfat so fat that is like door shuts our\nsimple to see in your own life and\nsimple to observe you can see kind of\nthe proof right in front of you with the\nterm skinny fat it's not big bone fat\nit's skinny fat we know that big-boned\nfat is a different kind of fat this\nany fad that's what I rather says is\nthat there isn't one kind of fad\nthere isn't one kind of mind there isn't\none kind of personality\nthere isn't one kind of memory\nunderstand which category you fall into\nand once you understand which category\nyou fall into you can adjust yourself\naccordingly because the solutions for\nskinny fat and big-boned fat are\nactually different that you need\ndifferent things to result to ideally\nfix skinny fat and ideally fix big-boned\nfat okay so where can I find the\nsuggested diet and so on for vodka okay\nso we're gonna talk about diet and vodka\nright now and then we're gonna also talk\na little bit about different mental\nhealth issues and Vata Pitta and kapha\nand then we're gonna jump to questions\nsimplest thing you can do for vodka you\nhave to get your bowels moving regularly\nso if you're constipated fix the\nconstipation number one okay even bowel\nmovements vodkas are cold and dry and so\nyou want to eat foods that are warm and\nmoist so any any time you have an option\nbetween soup and salad pick soup vodkas\nhave weak digestion so their digestive\npower is not very high so you want to\ncook foods before you eat them\nif we think about like if you eat like a\ncooked carrot versus a raw carrot and\nthey taste very different both of them\nare sweet but a cooked carrot is way\nsweeter so some of the process of\ndigestion has already been done for you\nyou've broken down some of like the\nwalls of the cellulose structure of\ncarrots so that the sweetness is more\navailable to you\nso Vava should eat foods that are warm\nand moist so avoid things like toast if\nyou have an option of using toasts and\noatmeal in the morning go without meal\nfor pizzas you want to avoid foods that\nare warm and wet so you want to eat\nthings that are cold and dry so like a\nsandwich is a great food for a bit\nthough salad is a great food for a bit\nthough gafas are cold and wet so you\nwant to eat foods that are warm and dry\nso toast is great food for\nI'm sorry cava okay so cold and dry is\nVata so you want to eat foods that are\nwarm and wet Pizza is warm and wet so\nyou want to eat foods that are cold and\ndry and kapha is cold and wet so you\nwant to eat foods that are warm and dry\nso that's the simplest change to make\nyou guys can also like google different\nlike you can just google Ayurvedic diet\nand I'm sure you guys will find stuff\nand you can sort of test it yourself so\nthere are also six tastes sour sweet\npungent or a sorry astringent spicy\nanything goodness sour sweet salty spicy\nastringent and bitter those are the six\ntastes yeah so mommy's different so in\nAyurveda there are six tastes and\nthere's their particular tastes for each\nvada as well so that's what I would say\nto start with Vata Pitta and kapha ah\nnot necessarily\nso gluten sensitivity is is a completely\ndifferent thing right so gluten is is a\nprime example of like Western thinking\nso gluten says gluten sensitivity says\nthat gluten one individual compound is\nthe problem for everyone so if you have\nlike if you have a pro allergic thing to\ngluten like that allergy is vodka but\nwhat I would say about gluten\nsensitivity is if you fix your Vata your\nability to tolerate gluten should get\nbetter so remember that some people have\nceliac disease which is a true allergy\nto gluten and that some people have\ngluten insensitivity but if you improve\nyour Vata if you lower your Vata your\nability to tolerate gluten should\nimprove okay so we have yeah so it's\nautoimmune but that's exactly what I'm\nsaying right is like you guys have to\nunderstand that Vata corrects in general\nautoimmunity so if you have MS if you\nhave rheumatoid arthritis if you have\nlupus\nany of the patients that I work with\nwhen they come in with these things I\ngive them Vata reducing diets and they\ntend to get better okay so now we're\ngonna talk a little bit about\nspecifically about vent until hell thin\niron meta so when a vato mind so we're\ngonna talk about how stress affects the\nminds of people with different door\nshuts differently okay so how does\nstress affect your mind depending on\nwhat your door SH eyes when a vada\nperson undergoes stress their mind\nbecomes anxious when a bit the person\nundergoes stress their mind becomes\nirritable or angry and when a guff a\nperson undergoes stress they become\ndepressive and isolative you can even\nlook at let me actually let me see if I\ncan find our Journal of health what is\nthis this is me I wrote a paper about\nthis so I wrote a paper in the Ayurveda\nJournal of Health about different kinds\nof depression so there's like this thing\ncalled an anxious depression which is\nlike a depression that like people's\nmind is moving very fast they have\ndifficulty sleeping like their insomnia\nso I want you guys yeah and then there's\na cuff of depression which is like what\nwe call a neuro vegetative depression so\nlike people they're hyper they have\nhypersomnia so they sleep too much they\nmove very slowly their thoughts are very\nslow and it's weird because like Western\nmedicine classifies both of these as a\ndepression okay so like dsm-5 anxious\ndepression let's see if I can find you\nguys a good source on this cuz I can't\nfind if someone can find the paper that\nI wrote in the IR via the Journal of\nhealth everything is laid out there\nbut it's kind of bizarre that in\npsychiatry if you look at the dsm-5\ncriteria for for depression you can have\ninsomnia or hypersomnia like just think\nabout that for a second that they call\nit sleep disturbance but like they say\nthat depression is the same whether you\nsleep too much or you sleep too little\nthat just doesn't make sense to me so\nanother criteria for DSM dsm-5 criteria\nfor depression is appetite changes they\ncall it appetite changes what that means\nis that you can eat too much or eat too\nlittle both of those qualify as\ndepression it blows my mind is a\nclinician that a disease where you eat\ntoo little is the same as where you eat\ntoo much those are two different\ndiseases my friends if you sleep too\nlittle or you sleep too much we call\nboth of those things depression those\nare two different diseases there's a\nvodka depression and there's a confiden\nthere's an anxious depression and\nthere's a neuro vegetative depression\nand clinicians understand this if you\ntalk to someone who prescribes\nantidepressants we have two classes of\nantidepressants clinicians understand\nthis we have activating antidepressants\nwhich give people a pep in their step\nand then we have like calming\nantidepressants we have some\nantidepressants that are also\nanti-anxiety medications and we have\nsome antidepressants that are not\nanti-anxiety medications so clinicians\nunderstand that there are different\nkinds of depression but in Western\nscience like we just haven't figured\nthis out yet actually actually we have I\ndo have another paper for you so there's\nalso fit the depression so you can have\na vodka depression a bit the depression\nand a cuff a depression\nanger attacks let me find this in PubMed\nI gotta just be a reference person hold\non I know this is maybe not what you\nguys are interested in anger attacks so\nthis is fascinating paper here we go\nMauricio fava okay you guys have to\ncheck out this part\nfascinating you guys want to see bit the\ndepression read this paper\nMauricio fava is the associate chief of\nPsychiatry at Massachusetts General\nHospital guys absolutely brilliant he's\na depression researcher and he\ndiscovered back in 98 that there is\nanother subtype of depression not just\nanxious\nnot just neuro vegetative but what he\ncalls depression with anger attacks\nthat's bit the depression the\nneurotransmitter profile for depression\nwith anger attacks is different from the\nneurotransmitter profile for anxious\ndepression and neuro vegetative\ndepression the neurotransmitters in each\nof these depressions is different and\nthat's been studied so I'm telling you\nguys like ire vetas like has this spot\non and if you understand that when\nyou're under stress do you get anxious\ndo you get pissed or do you get\ndepressant why is this thing Fleury so\nthis is an example of Ayurveda right and\nthat people respond to stresses in\ndifferent ways and if you get if you get\nangry angry or irritable when you're\nunder stress\nyou should eat foods that are cold and\ndry absolutely right so Doublemint Dave\nis saying I get angry and just tested\nthis pizza in the test yeah so and\nsomeone else was saying like art is\ndoesn't this create a cognitive bias\nlike yeah it can but I don't think it's\na cognitive bias because people don't\nknow anything about this they just they\njust circle things right a cognitive\nbias requires knowledge ahead of time\nthe other thing is I'm confident based\non the genetic testing that is\nstatistically significant that this has\nreal scientific merit right so then the\nquestion is for those of you who are\nyeah so gizmo gizmos our textbook Papa\nlupus gets anxious that's what I'm\ntelling you guys so the cool thing the\nreally cool thing about Ayurveda is if\ngizmo balances their Vata their lupus is\ngonna get better their anxiety is gonna\nget better their sleep is gonna get\nbetter their skin is gonna get better\ntheir bowel movements are gonna get\nbetter because if you lower the Vata\neverything that is associated with\nelevated vada is gonna get better and in\nWestern medicine we understand this\nconcept clinically as well when I'm\nworking with someone who has depression\nand addictions when one thing goes bad\neverything goes bad so in psychiatry we\nhave a saying that all boats rise\ntogether so the water level determines\nthe state of all of your disease\nprocesses we know that if you treat\nsomeone's anxiety their IBS gets better\nwe know if you treat someone's\ndepression their fibromyalgia gets\nbetter right we know this we know that\nthese things are clinically correlated\nbut our system of Western medicine is is\nlooking at individual things and\ntunneling down doesn't look at patterns\nand doesn't look at overarching changes\nbut we sometimes clinically we know that\nthat the even though our system isn't\ndesigned with this in mind we still\nthe evidence for this idea and a good\nexample is something like exercise or\nmeditation right exercise improves\neverything meditation improves\neverything meditation improves\ndepression it improves anxiety it\nactually there's a fascinating study\ndone by the Benson Henry Institute which\nlooked at something called MGUS which is\nmonoclonal gammopathy of unknown\nsignificance which is a precancerous\nstate and taught those people who have\nthis kind of precancerous state\nmeditation and then assess their their\ngenetic activity and actually found that\nthe pro cancerous genes are less active\nafter you learn how to meditate so this\nmay be the first evidence or there may\nbe other evidence I'm not really sure\nbecause this isn't my area but this is\nactually a really interesting data point\nthat suggests that meditation actually\nprevents the progression of cancer and\nit also treats depression how does that\nwork it's because there are some\noverarching principles behind human\nhealth and wellness that once we start\naccessing those principles to things\nlike exercise meditation everything\nabout you is gonna get better and we\nkind of know that like everyone if you\nguys like look at like you know\nsubreddits like stop gaming and some\npeople say like our mental health like\nyou just ask people they're like yeah I\nstarted exercising I feel better about\nmyself my like rash has got better like\nwhen I start exercising my skin problems\nget better so Ayurvedic is like it's\nsuch low-hanging fruit and you can make\nsuch positive changes in your life by\njust adopting Ayurvedic principles so I\nthink what we're gonna have to do if you\nguys are curious we just have to have\nsomeone come on and then like we'll talk\nabout some some specifics of Ironman but\nthe first thing to start with is diet\ndiet diet first line treatment for\nmental health problems in our event is a\ndietary change change your diet your\nanxiety or your depression your anger\nwill get better and now there's an\nemerging field of the hottest topic in\nmedicine right now is his brain gut it's\nthis idea that if you change your gut\nbacteria your mental health will change\nand IRA has been saying that for\nthousands of years so now we have\nscientific evidence between that\ncorrelates what happens in our gut and\nwhat happens in our brain right so like\nthis is the coolest study ever and you\nguys got to tell me if you really want\nreferences because like I feel like it\nbreaks my flow but I feel like it's\nimportant for me to back up what I say\nso I saw a fascinating study they took a\nbunch of depressed rats oh sorry\nthey took a bunch of depress rats\nextracted their stool transplanted their\nstool to healthy rats and the rats\nbecame depressed from a stool transplant\nthat is insane it's completely insane\nthere are two kinds of bacteria that\nhave been found in people who have high\nlevels of anxiety so they asked someone\nare you super anxious people who say yes\nthey test you've got back to you there\nare two kinds of bacteria that people\nhave high levels have high levels of\nbacteria if they're anxious if people\ntest low for anxiety there's a different\nto bacteria that are very prominent\nfascinating stuff and so if you think\nabout how does diet change your gut\nbacteria so if you eat a particular kind\nof food you guys have to understand that\ndifferent gut bacteria have different\ndigestive enzymes so lactobacillus which\nif you guys see probiotic stuff\nlactobacillus eats what does anybody\nknow it's lactose so if you eat a lot of\nlactose what do you think is gonna\nhappen to the lactobacillus in your gut\nit's gonna grow because that's what it\neats so there's some bacteria that eat\nsimple sugars some bacteria that eat\nlactose some bacteria that eat complex\ncarbohydrates some bacteria that eat\nfiber some bacteria that eat proteins\nlike different bacterias eat different\nkinds of things and so if you change\nyour bacteria I mean if you change your\ndiet you're gonna be feeding some kinds\nof bacteria and you're going to be\nkilling off or starving other kinds of\nbacteria so how does diet improve\ndepression it's because there's some\nbacteria that are\ninflammatory signals to your brain that\ncause depression also fascinating really\nfascinating study that I just saw\nrecently people start did a brief\nclinical trial of giving people\nanti-inflammatories when they're\ndepressed and their depression got\nbetter so some bacteria create a lot of\ninflammation like bacteria that eat that\ndigest processed foods create a lot of\ninflammation and when they create an\ninflammation it causes depression yeah\nso like the fascinating thing is that\nyou know people have been believing in I\nor rather you want to believe in it fine\nthe reason that I'm excited behind it\nand the reason that I'm such a proponent\nof it is because there's actually\nscience to back it up now we're not\nquite at the level of clinical studies\nbut the basic science really suggests\nthat I read is is is good and is correct\nand I've seen enough clinic clinical\nerror anecdotal improvement to where I\nbelieve it so people are wondering what\nwhat food do I eat to cure depression\nsee this is the wrong thinking remember\nwe just talked about how there are three\nkinds of depression there's anxious\ndepression there's a depression with\nanger attacks and there's a neuro\nvegetative depression depression is not\none thing that's a Western concept that\nthere's one thing got called depression\nand all depression has the same\ntreatment that's exactly what I'm trying\nto say is incorrect there are different\nkinds of depression\nwhat kind of depression do you have\nwhat's your Ayurvedic dosha that's where\nyou're gonna find the right treatment\nyou guys got that like that's the whole\npoint behind what I'm saying this is why\ndepression is so [ __ ] hard to cure\nbecause it's not one disease that's like\nsaying what do I eat to cure cancer what\nis the medicine for cancer there are\ndifferent kinds of cancer Madhu's there\nare solid tumors they're lymphatic\ntumors there are brain cancers their gut\ncancers each of these cancers has a\ndifferent chemo therapeutic regimen\nthey're fast growing cancers they're\nslow growing cancers each of them has a\ndifferent treatment the reason that\ndepression is hard to treat is because\npeople treat it like a monolithic\ndisease\nlike I don't know I mean there are all\nkinds of reasons why this could be true\nbut I have very good results with the\npeople that I work with with depression\nlike I shoot you guys not like I'm\nreally not trying to toot my own horn\nbut there are people that are in my\npractice that have been on treatment for\nlike I've been in therapy and medication\nfor anxiety for like 15 years and within\nsix months we're taping them off of\nmedication they feel fantastic\nwhy is it because I'm a brilliant\nclinician no this is what I'm saying\nI'm not actually any better it's just I\nuse tools that none of my colleagues use\nI use our villa and it's like it's okey\nman I'm not actually a better clinician\nso this is what I want you guys to\nunderstand I'm not actually saying I'm\nbetter than anyone else all I'm saying\nis that like all of my colleagues who\nare treating anxiety as a monolithic\nillness are doing themselves a\ndisservice because anxiety is not a\nmonolith Achilles there are different\nkinds of anxiety and once you understand\nthat once you start incorporating like\nanti rata diets people get better I have\none person in my practice I mean I've\nalso like I treat people with skin\nproblems and IBS and things like that\nand people like like who haven't had\nsolid shits in a decade and then we\nstart them on Ayurvedic dietary changes\nand they have solid shits and it's like\nit's crazy it's like it's not I'm not\ndoing anything I'm not doing anything\nlike extraordinary I'm just telling them\nto drink yogurt and water mixed together\nin like a 1 to 2 ratio with a pinch of\ncumin and a pinch of hydrogen sulfide or\npink salt or Himalayan salt and there it\ngets better ok so once again I can't I\ncan't provide medical advice over the\ninternet but I will tell you so if you\nguys have a medical problem like\ndiarrhea or IBS you should go and see a\ndoctor and at the same time something\nthat you should just try because is is\nto take yogurt so like take like just\nplain yogurt not Greek yogurt not\nlow-fat yogurt nothing no sugar or\nanything just plain yogurt 2 ounces\nyogurt 6 ounces of water\ntwo and a half ounces of yogurt 5.5\nounces of water mix it together add a\npinch of toasted cumin add a pinch of\npink salt drink it every day assuming\nyou're not lactose intolerant journey to\ngive you if it gives you problems don't\ndo it see what happens to your Balboa's\nthis beverage has been used as a\ntreatment for cholera in India for\nthousands of years\nnot so yogurt if you're allergic to milk\nthen don't don't do it but some people\nwho are allergic to milk can actually\nhave yogurt some people who are lactose\nintolerant can tolerate yogurt and the\nreason is because yogurt has been\nmetabolized by bacteria so that the\nchemical composition is more tolerable\nthan plain milk okay soy is completely\ndifferent yeah yogurt gives people acne\nabsolutely\nyou know what's crazy you know it's\nabsolutely blows my mind is that there\nare studies that say that diet has no\ninfluence on acne I just don't believe\nit like I just don't believe that don't\ndo kefir kefir usually has like sugar\nand stuff in it right no there's no\nlactose free alternative this is what\nI'm saying I mean there are other things\nyou can do to lower your Vaught that you\ndon't have to use lactose but that's the\nsimplest thing see there you go hallo 3\n9 7 9 says it I'm lactose intolerant not\nto yoghurt see this is the whole problem\nis that Western medicine says lactose\nintolerant and it assumes that all kinds\nof lactose are the same they're not the\nsame these are different compounds each\ncompound so this is what I read that\nsays my favorite page from a text of\nAyurveda I think is from Charaka Samhita\nis one page that compares and contrasts\nthe different kinds of milk so we're\ngonna play a fun game twitch at how many\nkinds of milk can you come up with let's\nsee if you can hit all of them ways at\nmilk ways a compound within milk nope\nnope none of these are correct this is\nnot milk there we go\nthere we go soy milk is not milk my\ndudes skim milk is not milk goat cow\nwhat else where else can we get human\nmilk absolutely sheep's milk what else\nwe've got for you already said milk\nhuman beings don't drink cat milk\nbuffalo milk five good so we've got goat\nsheep cow human buffalo what else what\nelse do humans drink milk from anyone no\ncamel milk yes and not daddy's milk\nthat's disgusting trees no bats no no no\nwe already got goats one more a horse\nyeah and elephant elephant is the last\nmilk so fascinating this this page\npeople humans don't drink cat milk\nhumans drink milks from hoofed animals\nthat's what we drink milk from right we\ndrink milk from domesticated animals we\nhave domesticated elephants in India\nright we don't drink dog milk we don't\ndrink carnivores milk you guys realize\nthat just think about that for a second\nif you observe the world you will learn\nall kinds of fascinating things about\nhumans human beings drink milk from\nhoofed animals not carnivores why the\n[ __ ] that is I don't know but I read\nthat says don't drink milk from a\ncarnivore like I don't know why I don't\nknow why right just think about that we\ndon't drink milk from carnivores but we\ndo drink milk from herbivores we drink\nmilk from hoofed mammals and then this\ntext of page of Ayurveda says that the\ndifferent milks are good for alleviating\ndifferent door shuts and that different\nmilks are treatments for different\nthings\nso if a human being is recovering from\nmalaria they should have a certain kind\nof milk and if they have active malaria\nthey should have a different kind of\nmilk like this is the specificity that I\ner vet has it breaks down each and every\nfood that we have and says that an apple\nis different from an orange that a lime\nis different from an orange that a lemon\nis different from a lime that all fruits\nfive servings of fruits and vegetables\nis they're not all the same when we know\nthis right so for example if you have a\nweak digestion give it difficulty\ndigesting foods you should eat papayas\nand pomegranates on alternate days right\nso we like IRA bears been saying that a\nnaturopath he's been saying that for\nthousands of years and now we know\nthrough science that papaya has this\nenzyme called papain which like breaks\ndown food so it makes digestion easy you\nguys go to like a health food store you\ngo to the supplement aisle you'll see\npapain enzyme is a dietary supplement to\nhelp you break things down and for those\nof you guys who marinate food\nwhy do you marinate things why do you\nnever marinate in papaya you guys know\nwhy you never marinate in papaya anybody\nknow okay we're gonna do a fun game\nwe're gonna do a fun game if you guys\nyes right so like if you marinate in\nsomething and papaya it turns it turns\nto mush it just straight like dissolves\nit and it's like a puddle of like mud\nwhen you're done so if you guys don't\nbelieve me try it right so if what I say\nis if you guys don't believe me by all\nmeans try it if you guys are not if you\ndon't have faith in the fact that we can\npredict things and the references have\nbeen insufficient just try it so what\nwould you say if pears always give me\ndiarrhea\nI'd say stop eating pears\nright so this is the thing is that\neveryone's everyone's digestive systems\nare different and I read that will tell\nyou what kinds of food to eat and not\neat it's clear to me that we're gonna\nhave to do a lot more stuff on our vests\nso I'm gonna like write stuff up for you\nguys like guides to this stuff from\nstart to finish I'll do it\nI've started already but yeah okay let's\ndo questions"
