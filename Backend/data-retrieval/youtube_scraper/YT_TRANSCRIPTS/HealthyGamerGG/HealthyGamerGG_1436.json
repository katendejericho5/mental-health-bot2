    "transcript": "and then you wonder why aren't you\nconfident it's because in the past when\nyou've been confident it did not go well\nthe one person you cared about your best\nfriend stabbed you in the back just\nbecause you were a decent human being\noh hi yeah so can we just check audio\nlevels real quick and make sure can you\nall hear us okay\n[Music]\nmic is banging against the table dammit\nthat thing is so sensitive I can touch\nanything okay audio is great okay so is\nit Lucy PI am i pronouncing that\ncorrectly can just call me Lucy okay\nyeah so Lucy tell me a list of all what\nis all that stuff in behind your chair\nthis looks like a I'm I'm a stream\nyeah but some plants uh yeah yeah this\nis my little little little cozy setup\nyeah yeah oh sorry buddy I was gonna say\nI'd like I came in and graded you the\nother day yeah I really like your stream\nthat's why I wanted to come on cuz I\nreally really like what you're doing\nokay\nand and so what are we gonna be talking\nabout today Lucy um so I've been\nreflecting on this a little bit because\nI knew this was gonna be the question\nthat was asked like I know I'll have a\nlot of issues okay and and sometimes um\nyou know when you're in the the maze of\nyour mind it's kind of hard to\ncategorize absolutely what the issue is\nbut one of the one of the big things\nthat I kind of click with today that I\nkind of wanted to start with is like um\nI really look like I like Who I am when\nI'm on my own when I'm quiet when I'm by\nmyself like I'm quite content with who I\nam as a person okay I'm nice go good\nmorals like I kind of check a lot of\nboxes and I enjoy being in my own energy\nokay the minute I'm with other people my\ninternal dialogue and my energy just\ncompletely shifts and I'm very like\ncritical I don't like Who I am like when\nI'm around people I like constantly\njudge myself and of some days it's\nbetter than others you know like if I\nmeditate before I go into an interaction\nand there's some people that I feel more\ncomfortable than others around okay um\nbut yeah for them I think that's like\nthe biggest thing that's going on right\nnow yeah so first of all thank you so\nmuch for spending some time kind of\nthinking about it and also I think you\ndid a wonderful job of encapsulating\nthis issue which is that\nthere's more than one you yeah yeah\nthere's sort of the real you and then\nthere's the person that you feel like\nyou should be when other people are\naround yeah especially with that cuz I I\ndo die cuz I'm in stream yeah I might\nlike I've been going through this like a\nlot processes lately of um trying to\nbecome more of who I am a stream on\nstream and I'm trying to become hold on\nyou're trying to become more of who you\nare on stream or off stream um like\nbring who I am off stream onto stream\nokay okay gotcha yeah cuz sometimes so I\nguess like my goal with what I like to\ndo is like I like to uplift people like\nto help people find purpose I also I'm\nvery into like this the spiritual\nscientist so I do like tarot cards and\noracle cards and just like I don't know\nlike trying to be that compassionate\nvoice of spirit I like to work with\nspirit and I I really like that and\nsometimes though I I feel like I have to\nbe this um\nthink this like always like super super\npositive or this like yeah so so you\nwant to be the thing that you are yes\nbut you feel like sometimes there's a\nthere's a voice inside you that says\nthat you should be something else yeah\nand when did you start becoming the\nperson that you are\nand\nit's been I think just like through the\nprocess of growing up he kind of like\nshed a lot of beliefs that other people\nkind of put on you yeah I'm 24 now so\nlike that process is like really saw it\nhappened in where I'm like I don't want\nto keep\ndoing this so I guess like yeah I guess\nyou keep doing what um like putting on\nlike a like out like a show or a like a\nlike a persona um like a friend yeah but\nyeah I think I'm just like finding out\nmore of who I am like I still don't\nreally know like Who I am so when you\nasked like how long have I been Who I am\nI'm like oh okay you know by the way\nyour your picture seems to have gotten\nblurry I don't know if it's oh oh hang\non hang on\noh that's\nokay yes okay sorry I just rely a lot on\nfacial expressions so it helps me an\neffect oh okay okay oh I'm really good\nwith those I'm like really bad at like\nhiding what's going on so that's gonna\nmake make this easier for me but so so\nlet's just think about this a little bit\nright so there's so give me give me an\nexample of like you say that sometimes\nwhen you're around people you start to\nhave a in your internal dialog so what\nkind of person are we talking about is\nthere someone that changes your internal\ndialogue pretty consistently yeah\nusually people that don't have similar\nbut like beliefs I think the\nspirituality thing is a big one I even\nhate the word spirituality because I\nfeel like\nI get a lot or I judge that a lot or\nfeel like I get a lot of judgment from\nthat so especially when it come on to\nlike the twitch platform like if the\nconversations thriving means something\nthat I really enjoy that I'm fine\nokay but if it's yeah if it's and and so\nif it's not thriving then what happens\nand I get quiet I kind of shut down I go\ninternal and I'm like Oh what kind of\nthoughts do you have Oh like oh I bet\nthese people think I'm stupid\nOh like I thought I sound like an\nabsolute like no case mm-hmm so if\nyou're not like talking to these kinds\nof thoughts arise when you're not\ntalking to your people\nyeah does that make sense yeah okay so\nlike so now I've got my first question\nfor you Lucy is why is it important to\nthrive because it feels good to thrive\nokay it was yeah I don't know if you'll\nyeah it feels good\nso I've got like dead limited vocabulary\nyou know that's that's no I think that's\nit that's a really fantastic answer\nright so it feels good to thrive so what\npart of what is thriving\num the exchange of information the\nconversation we talking about what I'm\npassionate about again I don't know like\nmy energy so I think okay is this like I\nfeel glowing like yeah you look good I\nfeel like I'm so does that feeling\ncoming come from you or does it come\nfrom other people um it comes from me\nI'm sure about that like well then again\nactually new because then it's like the\nconnection because I feel like I'm more\nconnected with people when I'm talking\nabout something that with driving about\nyeah so cuz I I think you know my sense\nis that it comes from you but what I'm\nnoticing is that you're not the one who\nbrings it out ya know that yeah you're\nright right yeah right because what\nwe're saying is that like so even though\nthe feeling is internal like it's a\nvocht by something else yeah so there's\nsomething there's some kind of\ncircumstance yeah that brings out your\nsense of like connection and thriving\nyes\nand what\nlet's start with this so like when some\nwhen you're sitting with someone and\nthey're not evoking they're not sort of\ngiving you a space to thrive okay is\nthat a good way to describe it yeah how\ndo you feel don't create the space\neither I beat myself up a lot of like um\nI've been compete in this cycle where I\nam so I do i do tarot readings on and I\nlove doing them and I get I get that\nthis is like the best scenario I could\ndescribe what happens is um I come in\nwith an intention of like I don't know\nlike I want to uplift people I want to\nlike have a discussion about this this\nand this and then I'll be talking I'm\nhaving a great time and then like things\nslowly start to die down but then it's\nlike internally I start to show off and\nthen I start going into this comfort\nzone of like okay I'm just gonna do\npeople's cards now and it's like a like\na comfort zone of like okay I'm just\ngonna be focusing on you and like would\nyou like I like a question and answer\ntype thing where people come in with\nquestions I like just kind of reel up\nlike go back to like yeah so machine\nyeah absolutely so so what is it what is\nit that the cards protect you from you\nsee that the cards are protecting you\nlike yeah so so I I want you and\neveryone else to notice that like when\nyou go so when you're feeling a certain\nway which is like something in the\nnegative spectrum yeah you turn to the\ncards because this is as you put it it's\nyour comfort zone yeah right you feel\nsafe if you're doing cards because the\nfocus is on them it's moved off of you\nyeah and then and then you're in safe\nterritory because then like you're out\nof the spotlight yeah and then in your\ncase it's tarot cards and it's another\nhuman being but in a lot of cases like\nfor me it was video games right when I\nwas feeling a certain way recovered\naddicts from video games yeah yeah now\nI'm addicted to tarot cards instead yeah\nbeautiful right so you see let's think\nabout that for a second so my god\nhow does that how does that work so\ntarot cards have replaced something it\nreplaced video games and I\nthink that's good like I think it's a\nstep in the right direction also kind of\nreplaced like external validation like I\nhave been reflecting a bit on like you\nknow like why can't I just be me in any\nsituation like why am I like relying on\nlike this external like yeah this this\nperson who you are is good oh no we\ndon't let you know like why am I trying\nto gauge like how I should be from other\npeople but like I have well so let's\nlet's answer that why why do you need to\nrely on other people to gauge to give\nyou a sense of confidence about yourself\nI don't know like God let's be\nmathematical so let's say let's say that\nwe're can confidence about myself come\nfrom\nfor me in theory okay or it can come\nfrom where else\num you okay where do you get it I get it\nfrom me but it's I only give it to\nmyself when I feel like validated okay\nso yeah I think that makes perfect sense\nso in a bizarre way so like I know that\nthe right answer for people who are\nspiritually in tune with themselves is\nthat confidence comes from within that's\nthe right answer but if we actually\nlisten to what you're saying your\nconfidence comes from two places yeah\nsometimes it comes from you and\nsometimes it comes from other people\nabsolutely right yeah first let's\nacknowledge that that's the way it is\nright now what what is it\nwhy would I need confidence to come\nso if I'm not getting confidence from\nthe outside where do I need it to come\nfrom from you absolutely and if I'm not\nneeding conf I'm not finding confidence\non the inside where do I need it to come\nfrom you need these come from the inside\nit's the only like sustainable source of\nconfidence uh hold on hold on woman\nsustainable source of confidence I\ncompletely agree with you but if I'm not\nif I'm getting confidence from the\noutside what does that mean about the\nconfidence what I'm getting from the\ninside well it's not that is it\nabsolutely Yeah right yeah so why don't\nwe write it so what can we understand\nabout like if you find that you're with\nsomeone and you're feeling like you're\nnot doing a good enough of a job and\nyou're feeling some kind of negative\nspace inside you're feeling judged you\nstart to judge yourself and then you\nturn to the videogames tarot cards\nNetflix take your pick Yeah right\nwhat does that tell us about your\nconfidence or what you get from the\ninside that's kind of low like yeah if I\nhave low confidence yeah yeah which is\nstrange right because a lot of the times\nit doesn't feel that way it's it's\ninteresting I think like sometimes\npeople can look at me and like see like\nthink that I'm a lot more confident than\nI am and it's like yo [ __ ] there's like\nthere's a reason I'm into spirituality\nlike that has been like something that\nI've been trying to build my confidence\nlike with yes because people can look at\nyou on paper and be like oh you have\nthis this and this you have all of these\nreasons to be confident and it's like so\nlike it's all about how you feel about\nyou like you know really like deep down\nand um yeah I'd like that's one of the\nbig reasons wanting to come into the\ncall was just because like I've been\ntrying to navigate my own maze and\nthere's just I feel like there's just\nbig coal wounds around confidence that I\nhaven't quite um like healed and even\nlike thinking about it and talking about\nit and tapping into it like like I I\nhave tissues like because I know I'm\nprobably gonna cry cuz like okay I even\nfelt like tearing up like even starting\nto open that what am I so tell us so I\nthink that makes sense because the\nstrange thing is that I see two versions\nof you right there's the confident\nversion but something happens like I\nthink that that confident person is not\nactually the real you that there's some\nkind of separation that's happening when\nyou take all of your lack of confidence\nand you kind of bundle it up and you\nlike stick it in the closet so that you\ncan be this perfect self that can help\nenough with other people it's actually a\nsacrifice that you make for the sake of\nyour antara or your duty and then the\nproblem though is that like even though\nthat person feels very authentic I think\nand I don't mean to be judgmental I\nthink that that person is a little bit\nof a lie yeah because in order to become\nthat person you have to take some of\nthis negativity and you have\nto ball it up and you up to stuff in a\nway and and and this is where you use\nthe word wounds which i think is a very\npowerful word that there's something\nabout you which you have to kind of like\nstick under the table yeah and when you\ndo that I think what actually happens is\nyou're invalidating towards yourself no\nfor sure\nI had a small realization of like well\nthis about this validation that I get\nthis persona how am I ever\nhow is that ever going to increase my\nconfidence because I don't even identify\nwith that all that there are times like\nthis person that's being accepted like\nit's only one part of me it's not who I\nam again like when I'm away from cameras\nand when I'm like alone like I really I\ndo really like Who I am and it's more\nsoft it's more general it is less\nconfident it's not that bold but it's\nlike nice beautiful so just think about\nthat for a second right in a weird way\nyou were more confident in the person\nwho is less confident yeah you're softer\nyou're gentler you're less confident in\nwho you are you're a flawed human being\nyeah and somehow it's peaceful to be\nwith that person who does not live up to\nexpectations oh my god you just blow my\nI don't know I am so afraid to like show\nthat I think I think sometimes like this\nthat's supposed to be huge\nof like oh you're supposed to be like\nthis yeah so it's expectation let me ask\nyou this Lucy who did you show yourself\nto that you cared about that didn't\naccept you my best friend\ntell me about that um I had this friend\nso I've I think your camera is tearing\nup because it just got blurry oh no we\ndon't want to see her like okay yeah I\ndon't know it sometimes it's in focus\nbut oh okay there we go it's 40 yeah\nthat's okay it's okay I'll manage but\nokay so tell me about your right your\nbest friend um so uh I get cozy for this\nemotionally preparing myself okay so um\nI had a friend everything has just gone\nblack in his flashing okay so so you\nwere saying okay yeah there we go I yeah\nI've always been I've always had like\nproblems with like social social stuff\num I've me like my sister was like my\nbest friend and I don't know just I just\nalways had like a hard time making like\ngood friends um and then I kind of like\nwhen I was about five years six years\nold I got a Gamecube so great like don't\nhave to socialize with anybody I can\njust sit at home and play games and then\nin school I'd just you know kind of like\nkeep my head down like keep my head down\nand just like don't need to make any\nfriends cause like you know um but yeah\nbut then I go I get into high school and\nI like stop making friends with this\nlike one girl and uh we end up becoming\nlike really really good friends and\nyou know those like I don't know I see\nlike people having friends of it like\nI've known this person for like 10 years\nand then like I had like how like how\nhave you got all of these friends cause\nlike it doesn't make any sense to me\num but anyway let me just clarify so so\ndoes it is it somewhat perplexing to you\nhow people maintain long-term\nfriendships not anymore\num because I i but yeah sometimes I do\nthink some long-term friendships I look\nat them and like they feel like that I\nsee a lot of people like who had in\nthose friendships because they feel\nobliged\num to be in those friendships because\nthey've been in there for a long time\nand I'm like how do you do that like how\nlike how do you maintain that um I\nalmost want to say it's like a bit of a\npersona that like you know to maintain\nthat friendship like they have to\ncompletely abandon who they really are\nin those situations of like I just don't\nhave a good like I don't have any easy\ntime doing that even though you don't\nhave a easy time abandoning who you are\nwell I do apparently but I mean I'm I\nyou know I don't abandon myself\ncompletely like there okay Inc you know\nif there's like a spectrum of how much\nyou abandon yourself uh-huh I know like\nI was like is that a super extreme but\nyou know I am I think I feel like\neveryone in a way is on that spectrum\nbecause the way I think society and\neverything is is like yeah you don't\nknow who's oh like that you are okay\nchuckling it sounds like you're you're\nkind of wondering you know how is it\nthat people can be so inauthentic with\nthemselves for such a long time in order\nto maintain a relationship for ten years\nit um honestly like I don't want it too\nmuch because it seems like I don't know\nit it's uh it seems like kind of\nself-explanatory like how things are set\nup but um oh yeah I've I've always kind\nof just struggled to do that so I kind\nof wonder what's wrong with me yeah more\nthan wonder what's wrong with other\npeople I more wonder like what's wrong\nwell Lucy so I I think I think um so\nfirst of all I don't think anything is\nwrong with you\nokay that's nice what's the narrow but I\nI do think that somewhere along the way\nyou got the idea like in your in the\nassumptions of what you're saying\nthere's this assumption that being\ntogether with someone for ten years the\nlonger you're with someone the more work\nit is because the more you have to\nabandon yourself\nright that's why it's sort of perplexing\nto you how people can maintain\nrelationships for 10 years because the\nfirst year of maintaining relationship\nis so much work and then if we have to\ndo it for a second year in the third\nyear I don't it's more like if you make\nit small about making a childhood friend\nlike that precise to be like maintaining\na friendship with somebody as you grow\nas a person and no longer become like\nyou're no longer that person that they\nbecame friends with and that they have\ngrown and a problem meet someone that\nyou no longer like oh and remember who\nthey are you're no longer who you are\nhow do you still maintain the Dodgers\nI'm not very good with like small talk\nor like I don't know like um I don't\nknow I want I don't want to say fake but\nthat's like the old I think that's like\nthe only thing about vocabulary that's\nit's like very surface level um I want I\ndon't know why I want secrecy like only\nsurface level like me me me me me like\nme I just think I don't know I just\ndon't like you that's and that's a great\nthat's a great description so I actually\nI just want to pause for a second and\nlike you and me me me me me me\nso it feels like that's not good\ncommunication but that is an amazing way\nto convey what you're feeling because I\nunderstood exactly what you meant\nwhat do you mean it's sort of like this\nidea that you know that sometimes there\nare people out there who are super fake\nand that when you haven't seen someone\nin a year that's the way you act with\nthem oh yeah it really is and it's\nreally hard for you to do that because\nit's hard for you to be fake yeah it's\nlike reads all over my face I'm like how\ndo you how do you do this yeah so I\nthink oddly enough\nI know that some of the ways that I'm\nreframing things or framing things is\nnot really connecting with what you're\nsaying but I really think somewhere\nalong the way you're kind of saying like\nhow do people maintain friendships over\n10 years as individuals grow and change\nbecause the longer the relationship goes\nin the more that you diverge the less\nlike authentic stuff the less stuff that\nyou guys have in common is you become\ndifferent people how do you maintain a\na strong connection without the mimimi\nmimimi mimimi yeah because you guys have\nbecome different people yeah I think one\nof the things there with me and as you\nlike reframe that it's like I have a\nhard time being confident with myself as\nI'm changing and growing I don't stick\nto it I was awake and I'm like me me me\nme me like yeah authentic because I'm\nlike not confident with who I've changed\nand grown into a person so I feel like I\nhave to like do these like pleasantries\nand don't feel oh there it is\nno that's very yeah so I'm gonna just\nsay that back to you right so the reason\nthat people are able to maintain\nrelationships over 10 years is because\nthey're authentic it's really really\nhard if all you have is me me me me me\nme me yeah right so the way that you\nmaintain a relationship for 10 years is\nthat you recognize that each of you has\nchanged as human beings but can you come\nto love and accept the person that they\nare now instead of the person that they\nused to be yeah you know so I had a\nfriend who we were really close when\nwhen we were in middle school and then\nlike when we got into high school he\nstarted using a bunch of drugs and like\nthat was difficult for our relationship\nbecause I didn't want to use drugs and\nhe wanted to use drugs and like we still\nare friends to this day but we've just\ntaken different paths and we've sort of\naccepted each other for like what we are\nyeah that's cool\nbut I I think the reason that it feels\nso confusing to you is because the\nreason like the reason it's so hard is\nbecause the further you guys diverge the\nmore you have - me me me me me me me me\nme it to bridge that gap right the more\nfake you have to become yeah but I think\nthe problem here is that you're not\nletting them see who you really are\nyeah that's that's that's really true\nyeah so then the question becomes and\nI'll come back to this like what\nhappened with Anna yeah so so honey her\nname was uh her name is Amy\nI'm sorry Amy yes okay I don't even\nthink I said a name to be okay so I was\na really good guess like I don't even\nknow if I said a name but um but yeah we\nwere\nreally good friends she was like my\nfirst like official like bestfriend and\nwe used to play xbox and she just really\nlike was we just really really connected\nreally clicked really go on as we got\nolder to like 18 19 she started getting\ninto drug use and I wasn't into that and\nshe got very like judgmental towards me\nbecause I wasn't interested in drugs and\nit started kind of kind of getting into\npeer pressure of like you know all you\nbeing boring oh oh you're a [ __ ] for\nlike not wanting to do it and I'm like\nyeah I don't know I just like have this\nI just don't I'm just not interested\njust internally resistant I just don't\nwant to do it like um and that like\nseemed like like they didn't really\nshouldn't really respect that and she'd\nslowly kind of like I don't know like\nshe'd start talking like trash about me\nlike to the people around me and like\nsaying that I was like judgmental and um\nlike up my own ass but like and\ncondescending and think that I'm a above\nher because of I wanted to be like clean\nand not what when I say clean I don't\nmean like there's anything dirty about\ndrugs um just as like the ceiling of\nlike being clean like I do yeah yeah\ndoing drugs I'm correcting myself now\nbecause I don't want to seem like I'm\nclothing being condescending or being\nabove anyone even it's like I'm talking\nabout it um but yeah and then over time\nlike it just the relationship just got\nreally mean and oh my god\nso I so I used to do like YouTube videos\nwhen I was younger um cuz I was very\nlike shortened I used to make call of\nduty commentaries on YouTube and I\nreally enjoyed doing them and I actually\nwas pretty successful like for my age I\nwas about 18 and I had about 80,000\nsubscribers and it was really cool I'm\nproud of it and\nthen she would always introduce me as\nlike oh this is Lucy like she's famous\non YouTube but I'm like all can you not\nlike I don't want to like that's not I\ndon't that like just makes me sound like\nan [ __ ] and she was always like if we\never got into an argument she would use\nlike that card of like oh you think\nyou're better than me because of like\nwhere you're at and um she'd like accuse\nme of being jealous and stuff a lot and\nI know like looking back now it's like I\nunderstand that she has like a lot of\nissues that she'd put on to me but I\nthink I just like gobbled them all up\nand for that I was like this horrific\nhorrible\nlike person and\nI don't know I'm trying\nhow that connects to like\neverything but like when you're in the\nmaze it's hard to see I'm sure sure can\nsee maybe maybe we can help you out with\nthat yeah\nthe combined wisdom of short chat in\nmyself oh no I'm not even looking at\nTwitter I was like I'm not either does\nit go to a chat trick chats pretty good\nthough actually so so let's just think\nthrough once again mathematically like\nwhat happened right so there's this\nperson who's your best friend you guys\nconnect y'all play xbox you've been a\nlittle bit lonely it sounds like through\nmiddle school and and when you got to\nhigh school and where what you have an\naccent where are you from generally I'm\nfrom England\nokay from Burton yeah okay so um so you\nwere kind of I think you used the words\nshut in a little bit yeah I was a sure\nenough just like homebody yeah and so\nyou had this friend and this person that\nyou really connect with and and amy is\nlike soup Amy right yeah yeah and so\ny'all are y'all are close and he's she's\nyour friend and she's your officially\nyes because I've always been like oh you\nsee like girls and cliques like all the\ncool girls in high school and I was like\na goof yes I was like yeah I have me\nlike one of these best friends yeah\nabsolutely right so you were you were\nhungry for something you were hungry for\ncompanionship and friendship and here\ncomes along Amy and you know you kind of\ndescribed in a very like logical way\nthat there was like sort of this decline\nthat started around drug use and it\nsounds like she took a lot of your\nchoices personally like she felt like if\nyou're not using drugs she was\nprojecting so in psychology and\npsychiatry we call that projecting she\nwas projecting her insecurities she was\ncalling you judgmental even though like\nand we could talk a little bit about\nthis so people\npeople sometimes hate the thing that\nthey hate the most in the world is\nsomeone who they could be yes yeah and\nand we we talked about this a little\ncouple weeks ago on Devon stream but\nlike my theory of trolls on the Internet\nis that like the reason that they troll\nis because they look at someone and they\nfeel like if they were different they\ncould be the person that they choose to\ntroll yeah and so what they have to do\nis like knock people down a peg to make\nthemselves feel better yeah and so what\nshe's got to do is like when you're when\nwhen she's using drugs and you're sober\nand you've got 80,000 subscribers on\nYouTube\nlike or where either of you\nprofessionally oriented or successful or\nacademic or anything like that no we're\nboth no we both we both like didn't go\nto college didn't go yeah so University\nabsolutely right so like like if you\nthink about both of you guys are so\nsimilar but they're a couple of really\nimportant differences between you and\nher and those are that first of all you\nchoose not to use drugs yeah and the\nsecond is that you're professionally\nsuccessful in some way despite college\nso there's like there's like the\njealousy and envy of everyone who\ndecides to go to university and you know\nbecomes an accountant which is like\nthey're like a normal functional member\nof society and then there's the two of\nyou and you guys you your bond is so\ndeep because both of y'all are misfits\nyeah and in both of you are rejects yeah\nand so it's okay for both of you guys to\n[ __ ] up yeah but then you committed the\nmost cardinal sin Lucy you didn't\nactually [ __ ] up yeah you're someone who\nwalked her path but decided not to use\ndrugs and became YouTube famous yeah and\nso she every day when she wakes up and\nshe sees you she sees the thugs so hard\nabsolutely yeah right\nand then because she's like oh it's then\nwhat happens is the guilt arises the\nshame arises like Oh Lucy's actually\nbetter than I and then what she has to\ndo is she has to protect herself for\nMatt right yeah we've talked about this\nbefore but remember that the ego arises\nin order to protect you from negative\nemotion yeah so she starts to feel guilt\nand shame the ego steps in and then she\nstarts being judgmental towards you\nright every person that she introduces\nyou to she's got to tell them that\nyou're famous on YouTube because if it\ncomes out 15 minutes into the\nconversation they're gonna be really\nimpressed right oh I like a way like cuz\nI just got really embarrassed by I was\nlike oh my god she's just like I don't\nknow yeah you got a bear spy it because\nyou're an empathic person and you\nrealize that she's insulting you in\npublic but that's not what it looks like\nI'm kidding sorry that's a joke but oh\nright so like this is this is like\nsomeone saying like so a hi my name is\nolive Canoga I'm I'm on faculty at\nHarvard Medical School like it's the\nsecond word out of like second think I\nknow mine that's a dick thing to say and\nthen if someone introduces reduce me\ndown to this YouTube favorite I'm just\nlike I'm so much more than that like\nthat was a byproduct of me being me you\nknow like yeah yeah yeah I didn't think\nof it like that\noh my god and and so she's got a she's\ngot to pull the gun out and sort of like\nit and the funny thing is she can't you\ncan't if she like if you complain about\nthat but she's like oh no I'm trying to\nlike tell everyone how awesome you are\nbut she's actually doing the exact\nopposite she's been it's no yeah yeah\nyeah and and that's what she's got to do\nbecause if people find out that like not\nonly are you a normal human being that\nthey like and your YouTube famous and\nyour humble about it and it's not how\nyou define yourself\nyeah that's intolerable I also feel like\nI need to disclaim I'm also not YouTube\nfamous anymore just like what but yeah\nhow does it feel how does it feel to say\nyou're not YouTube famous oh it's nice\nlike a weight off my shoulders like I\nmean yeah right so that's kind of weird\nso let's just let's just pause and pay\nattention to that for a second okay so\none would think that admitting\nyour failures or that you're a has-been\nwould lead to a sense of lack of\nself-confidence oh yeah I kind of what I\nhave been through that like process of\nlike my mind being like oh God\neveryone's gonna be so judgmental like\nof because I have friends that are wrong\nlike millions of subscribers now um and\nI'm like all [ __ ] like think that bet\nthey think I'm like a but I'm like you\nknow what it's actually like really nice\nto\nno that sounds like an Amy thought\nI bet they think I'm a burnout yeah like\nthat's it any thought\nyou see that very yeah wait that's the\nkind of thing that Amy used to think\nabout you oh my god if she liked the\nlittle voice in my head now those\njudgments cuz it happens like I get a\nkind of I have yes you should be really\nbad but it's not as bad anymore but yeah\nlike I have um like some quite like very\nlike famous people like syndicate and\nthere was this guy called like ksi who\nwere like huge huge youtubers I used to\nbe like quiet friends with the ball I\ngot kind of embarrassed I kind of\nreturned to the internet again as this\nyou know more like spiritual laid-back\nlike hippie rather than like a super\nintense like gamer with like I used to\nhave like a lot of opinions negative\nones I used to like run ting and like I\ndon't know but yeah I how do you feel\nright now is he\nembarrassed I why\n[Music]\nOh No um about like all of my\nprojections and like what what does that\nmean projections what do you mean well\nmy um like explaining like\nhow how I feel about and like talking\nabout my judgments and thoughts that I\nhave like sometimes I feel kind of like\nashamed of them and especially I still\nlow-key feel like I'm I'm like somehow\nlike bragging goes something by saying\nthat like I was friends with famous\npeople it's like it's just part of like\nthe story it's not like me trying to\nbrag but yeah that's an Amy comment yeah\nso so the other thing that is is those\nare the thoughts so you have this like\nprogram running like in the back of your\ncomputer\nyeah of your mind that judges what you\nsay based on how other people are gonna\nperceive it oh yeah no that's exactly it\nright and and we're gonna call that\nthing Amy\nthat's Amy Exe like that's that's\nactually hilarious because it's and\nSholay is true like it's sad so now I'm\ngonna ask you Lucy when you pull out the\ntarot cards what program are you trying\nto shut down um Amy and anything else in\nmy life that's been that program you\nknow like I have this I made my own\nlittle deck and it's like you know\nthings like listen to yourself like\nconnect with your heart like what your\nintentions let your guard down like it's\nsafe to trust things and it's just like\nthis is literally like I don't know it's\njust like I don't know it's like a\nlittle nice messages that I'm like yeah\nthat I'd like trying to dry out like\ndrown out like even today like I was\ncrapping myself coming on to this Cole I\nwas like like I was so anxious I felt\nreally sick and I was like you know it's\nlike meditate chill breathe what were\nyou feeling oh my god\nI was anxious about being able to like\ncommunicate want my issues off cuz as I\nsaid like like trying to categorize like\nI'm a whole like I'm a bit of a mess you\nknow like I've got a lot of like\ndifferent she's going on and like any\nbleed out into like different places\noh there's core issues that affect a lot\nof things yeah so let me so it sounds\nlike what you were embarrassed about is\nthat if you came on here unless you had\neverything sorted out people would think\nthat you were stupid for not\nunderstanding your issues so what I'm\nsorry what program is that well I could\nquote a myeonghui but I feel like not\nall of its from her but we can yeah I\ncompletely agree yeah yeah so I I think\nthat there are multiple things so yeah\nso this the Sun script word for this is\na some scar essay msk ARA and as twitch\nad is telling me this is like malware so\nlike I want I want you guys to\nunderstand this that like as we go\nthrough life we accumulate these\nnegative bundles of emotion that we\ndon't process yeah and what happens is\nthat bundle of emotion forms like some\nkind of pattern which psychology calls a\nschema sch EMA son script calls a some\nScott and it's kind of like this little\nthing that's like operating in your mind\nthat changes the way your mind works\nbecause when you're by yourself you're\nlike a completely normal person and even\non stream even on streams so even though\nyou're feeling embarrassment I think\nyou're being mostly authentic and I\nthink that I don't think anyone thinks\nyou're arrogant for having eighty\nthousand YouTube subscribers at the age\nof eighteen I don't think anyone thinks\nthat you think you're better than anyone\nelse for like knowing famous youtubers\nbecause you used to be together I think\nit's just a statement of fact that's the\nway I interpret it yeah\nbut you've got this some scar which is\nthis little ball of undigested emotion\nwhich when Amy did this to you she was\nyour friend she was your one person you\nwere hungry for friendship she was your\nbest friend\nand you guys were both the rejects right\ny'all were both the misfits neither\ny'all went to university neither of you\nguys had jobs or I mean I haven't asked\nyou about relationships but um you know\nlike like you guys didn't have something\nthat when you went to Thanksgiving and\nyou see your aunt or uncle and they\nasked you what are you up to nowadays\nyou didn't have an answer that has them\nnodding and respect yeah yeah I mean\nthen YouTube think even though that\nseems cool they would still like they\nweren't not in a respect temple yeah\nyeah they'd have something more than her\nat least yeah right which is big when\nyou've got nothing so like when either\nyou all have nothing and then you've got\nsomething and then that creates that\nproblem for her and then she starts\nattacking you and this is someone that\nyou formed a relationship that you were\nvulnerable towards yeah you were\nauthentic you guys had this connection\nwe just when she starts attacking you\nthat hurts\nyeah and that hurts a lot because your\ntribes me being like like it's like it's\nI was taking everything that you're\nsaying is true yes I didn't have any\nother external support to be like yo\nloose like she's she's like projecting\nher [ __ ] on you you know yes I tried to\nspeak to my mum about it and one was\nlike kind of like yeah just jealous you\nknow and it's like so what did that do\nto your internal sense of confidence I\ntook of myself you own it yeah and I\nknow it's not like every time like I'm\ndoing something while I'm always like\nokay gotta make sure like I'm not sound\nlike I can't it's almost like a calm I'm\nnot allowed to be successful like I'm\nalways beating myself up for like even\nwanting like something good yes because\nthat's a me judging you for being\nsuccessful yeah right so now what you've\ndone is you've internalized that Amy\nviruses malware yeah and and when you're\nwith yourself you don't have to be\nsuccessful you don't have to appear to\nbe successful what turns on the malware\nis other people's appearance or judgment\nof your appearance success\nyeah and also just a judgment of me like\nas as me not even in regards to success\nlike sometimes I can literally just be\nin a conversation with somebody and it\nand it turns on us like hey am i making\nthis person feel bad or like I don't\nknow just like questioning like how I'm\nbeing perceived um or judged and like it\neven with success like out of the\nequation like I just\nI just like I don't know I hate it so it\nsucks yeah right it's very powerful so\nnow I'm gonna ask you a question that\nmaybe you don't have an answer to which\nis perfectly fine so Lucy it's fine to\nunderstand that you got this bit of\nmalware there actually I think the\nreason that you say they're not all Amy\nis because the truth is that you have\nmultiple some scars and each some scar\nis like activated by a slightly\ndifferent scenario yeah and what I want\nyou to notice about a some scar is that\nyou're yourself except when it becomes\nactive and then you become someone else\nit's like the confident quiet person\ndisappears the other thing I'll tell you\nabout some scars is according to like\nyogic theory the some scar retains the\nage at which it was formed ya know I\nrelate to that a lot and and so right\nnow you're 24 yeah and so when you when\nAmy exe activates you become like 18\nagain yeah and so all the person that\nyou've become all the growth that you've\nexperienced actually deactivates it's\nlike you shut off that program and\nthat's why it's so damn perplexing\nbecause you're like I've become more\nconfident I'm confident in myself I\nspent all this time meditating and\nreflecting and I know I'm a good person\nso why is it that all of those feelings\njust randomly go out the window in some\ncircumstances yeah and so I want you to\nrecognize that your brain is literally\nlike a CPU that's running different\nprograms and there's 24 year-old\nspiritual adviser Lucy who helps people\nand is confident in herself and then\neven while you're that person sometimes\nAmy exe activates and in the middle of a\nsession with someone is a meaty XE\nactivates you can't just talk to that\nperson you need the crutch of the tarot\ncards yeah that's a third program yeah\nright which is like a full screen like\nthis is video games or other things that\nthat when we have this negative some\nscar that activates we have to pull up a\nthird program to like put that other\n[ __ ] into the background yeah yeah\nbecause it is well like trying to\noperate still while you have that going\non like you just like switch internally\nand it's like oh [ __ ] like how do I yeah\nfunction right now I need a minute like\nI need to go like yeah it's like one of\nthose pop-up ads where you click the X\nand that's a link to open up another pop\nI can't pop-up ad and it's not a real X\nyeah and especially don't looks like\njust can't go down like stream it's like\nyou know it's funny cuz like I I you\nknow it's probably like very normal you\nknow for that for that to happen and\nlike I I've been trying to be more aware\nof it's like activation I've been\npracticing like a few things like not\ntaking things personally and not jumping\nto conclusions because that's what Amy\ndoes you know Amy jumps to conclusions\nand she takes like what were the people\nsaying she takes it personally but yeah\nlike when it does it's reduced the\nactivation rate but um yeah it's it's\nstill that and when it is it's just very\nhard to like function as a person\nabsolutely\nso Lucy interaction wallet iPhone in I\nthink I think you've started by actually\nso my question was gonna be okay it's\nfine to figure all this stuff out what\ndo we do about it right like how now\nwhat and I think you've actually done a\nfantastic job of the first answer which\nis I think the first thing you need to\ndo if you have these kinds of intrusive\nthoughts and like for people who are\nwatching I want you to just think about\nthis scenario right so your your normal\nself and then some circumstances arise\nthat your mind starts going like [ __ ]\nhaywire it just starts malfunctioning\nand thinking all these thoughts that you\ndon't want them to think and you're like\nwhy are these coming back it's just like\nmalware malware is a beautiful way to\nput it and so the question is like how\ndo we conquer it like what do you think\nLucy how do we um probably like Charing\nget to the root of light why did you\ndownload the malware like why did it\ncome yeah and then how much one install\nit um probably do you like I don't know\ncuz this is why it's like this is why\nI've come to you you know I think young\nneed support they need to go to a\nprofessional to like health and diagnose\nand like run a diagnosis all right you\nthought my halwa and this is what it's\ndoing and um well I guess like on my own\nside what I've been trying to do is like\ndiagnose like what it is and like what\nit what it's doing with the limit like\nfrom from inside the mal WA which has\nbeen kind of hard and then try to\nbeautiful result like reduce how much\nit's kind of coming up but I don't\nactually know the solution I was loving\nthis tell me I will so I'm loving this\nanalogy more and more because like I I\njust love the way are you using the\nlanguage to actually describe so I think\nyou're spot on the first thing you have\nto figure out where did you get the\n[ __ ] bow where right yeah where did\nthis where did these thoughts originate\nyeah the second thing that you noticed\nis that when you're operating from\nwithin the malware it's really hard to\nshut it off or impossible to shut it off\nyeah right so what we've got to do is\nstep outside of the malware that's how\nwe're gonna diagnose it but the first\nthing is that you know to recognize that\nokay this actually is not me right now\nbut when you're on stream with someone\nand you lose confidence and you feel\nlike you're not doing a good job the\nfirst thing is to recognize that this is\nthe malware this is a me exe that's\nactivating it's not me okay and until\nyou know what a me exe is you can't tell\nthe difference and even route because\nit's like I recognize it's happening but\nI'm like is this me what's going on but\nif I'm seen it's like something external\nit's easier to like deal with in\nseparation yeah like that the other\nthing is to be compassionate towards the\nmalware yeah right is to understand that\nthere's some guy in like Russia or the\nUkraine was just trying to make ends\nmeet so he wrote this virus and installs\nmoney on your computer and that that guy\nis just trying to bribe read and milk\nand sort of understand that there's a\npart of you that is actually\neighteen-year-old Lucy who feels hurt\nand rejected yeah and what that person\nneeds is like your support right like\nwhat ami needed and I think you did a\nfantastic job of this Lucy like when I\nwas talking to you about what was going\non in Amy's mind you tossed this same\nout there oh my god that must have been\nreally hard for her yeah right I mean it\nwas it was so weird like the dynamic at\nthe relationship I ended up with me\nbeing a lot of like supporting her\nthrough that and she'd go through these\nlike\num switch modes why she'd be like\nrecognized like Oh Lucy you're actually\nreally good puss and like actually I'm\nsorry for like judging you like that and\nthen like switch because then it was\nlike oh if I recognize her as a good\npurse and then she then becomes even\nbetter than me and then Lucy you know\nwhat you're doing right now\nwell you're diagnosing malware within\nAmy you see that yeah I have like a\nnatural thing with that I'm quite good\nwith diagnose in people's malware and I\nalways feel like a and this is probably\nlike I set for it yeah mine but I always\nfeel like oh no like I don't want to\ncall out people's like oh yeah it's\nclearly shadow but I'm quite good at\ndiagnosing people's mom yeah what so\nyou're noticing that amy has this one\nmode of operation in something awakens\nwithin her where she's got to treat you\nlike a [ __ ] yeah yeah and and so all of\nus have malware all of us we all have\nsome scars\nand so the first thing is to recognize\nokay like this is where it came from the\nsecond thing is to recognize when it\narises that this is actually not me but\nthat doesn't mean that it doesn't\ndeserve space in your head like you\ncan't just delete it or close the\nprogram or something like that just\nrecognize that when this malware\nactivates oddly enough the more that you\nfight against it quick if you like go\nand you like like you know if you\ncontrol-alt-delete and like end the\nprocess the malware just like pops up\nagain you can't just shut it off by\nknowing that just understand that it's\nactivating and then like just you just\nrecognize that okay I'm feeling I'm not\nfeeling confident right now\nthis is like the Amy DXE it's gonna feel\na lack of confidence for a time and\nthat's actually okay because if you\nactually just sit with the feelings of\nAmy and you're not gonna it's hard to\nrecognize this because any time it\nactivates what happens is you go to your\ncomfort yeah and when you go to your\ncomfort the process goes into the\nbackground and then you don't actually\nget to like emotionally metabolize any\nof that negativity so just sit with it\ntry to put on a face and just recognize\nthat okay on the inside there's gonna be\nthis whole process going on and I'm just\ngonna keep talking like exactly like\nwhat I'm doing on Twitch right now which\nis internally I'm filled with anxiety\nand thoughts of judgment and all of\nthese kinds of things but I'm just gonna\nkeep talking and play pretend and as\nlong as I recognize that I'm filled with\nanxiety over time the anxiety is\nactually gonna go away yeah yeah I have\na hard time saying when anxiety arises\nI'm just like shut it down like yes and\nit's like oh yeah absolutely through it\nI like cuz because I think as well it's\nlike resistance like oh if I'm anxious\nit means like I'm not doing wash like\nshould be doing go like this is a\nwarning sign of like stop what you're\ndoing like do something different you\nknow yeah so so just recognize that your\nimpulse is gonna be to shut it down and\nas best as you can just ride it out I\nwant everyone to understand that like\nfeelings like anxiety or actually like a\nwave and if you just wait the wave is\ngonna like it builds up builds up builds\nup feels like it's imposter\nand if you try to stop the wave it\ndoesn't work but if you just leave the\nwave alone it's gonna like crest and\nthen it's gonna collapse all on its own\nyes all you have to do is just ride it\nout and so when I'm talking to people\nwho have addiction problems we talked\nabout this principle called urge surfing\nand to recognize that an urge is going\nto arise to use whether it be a video\ngame or drugs or alcohol or marijuana or\nwhatever and that you don't have to\nresist the impulse forever you just have\nto resist the urge so just ride it yeah\nsurf along top and then over time like\nthat wave is gonna crash on its own and\nthen you'll be completely fine and the\nmore that you just practice that like\nrecognize you don't have to actually\ntake a step back from anything you're\ndoing just just sit with the feelings\nthat you've got recognize that there's\nan 18 year old version of you who's\nalive and got really really hurt by\nbeing yourself because the only thing\nyou were is yourself yeah an Amy [ __ ]\npunished you for it yeah and so now when\nyou try to be yourself like you learn\nthis is a learned behavior Lucy you\nlearned that if you're just like a good\nperson someone's gonna [ __ ] you over\nthat people are gonna hate you for it\nand then you wonder why aren't you\nconfident it's because in the past when\nyou've been confident it did not go well\nthe one person you cared about your best\nfriend stabbed you in the back just\nbecause you were a decent human being\nwho didn't use drugs oh dude that's so\nlike it's really absolutely mean I don't\nthink she realized was oh yeah I feel\nlike just in day to day like you don't\nrealize the impact that you make why not\nyou [ __ ] like that and yeah like I've\ntried to speak to people in the past\nabout it and I think like you know if\npeople can like look at you and like\nlook at all you've got why did you not\nfeel confident like you've got all this\nthat's just like\nI'm really glad that I came on this coal\nyeah I'm glad you did too so let's go\nahead and transition let's see if people\nhave questions or you have this this\nquestion bot so I'm gonna see if I find\nit really interesting that you called it\nmalware to some like that no that's\ntwitch chat see I'm telling you this is\nit's not just me it's me and twitch chat\ntwitch chat call it malware so I\nactually did like a guided meditation\nonce Wow I imagined it because I really\nliked computers like okay I'm gonna do\ncontrol-alt-delete\nI'm gonna look at my processes like see\nlike a processes tab going on I'm gonna\nlike look and yep and and stop close\nI'll be like anxiety exe okay delete and\nI was like dude all of these things I\ndon't doing like okay virus scan okay\nclear out junk I don't was actually like\npretty good like it this is like coping\nmechanisms but even deeper than that\nlike I really like the idea that you\nknow we all roll just computers and when\nwere born we just like you know download\nsoftware and throughout our lives you\nknow were downloading different\ninformation viruses malware connecting\nwith different computers exchanging\ninformation you know cutting away\nconnections and just always trying to\nevolve and like upgrade and sometimes\npeople have better Mouse's and keyboards\nand some people have three monitors one\nperson might have the cheap [ __ ] one and\nyou know it just is what it is\nand you know sometimes you don't realize\nthat where the computer we think with\nthe programs that are running in it\nbecause it's just so deeply ingrained\nand then even further than that I\nbelieve like we're all actually just the\nelectricity running through that running\nthrough those computers and when we die\nthe electricity just goes back yeah yeah\nthat's that's a really great analogy I\nthink the interesting thing about some\nscars from the yogic perspective is that\nthey believe that some of your\nprogramming get happens even before\nbirth oh yeah like I'm I like I'm\ninterested in like past lives and things\nlike that yeah so you should check out\nsomething called this is like not really\ngreat science but there's a great theory\ncalled inherited trauma which is this\nidea that like\nchildren of Holocaust survivors have\nsome symptoms of PTSD and so apparently\nlike they're they're like not genetic\nlevel changes but something called\nepigenetic level changes that allow\nprior experiences to be like passed on\nto kids yeah and the prevailing theory\nwas that this was just sort of like\npsychological and upbringing like a\nnurture thing like if you experienced\nPTSD that that affects the way that you\nparent right and so because of your\nparenting changes that someone else\ngrows up a particular way but that has\nnothing to do with like birth it's just\nall your the circumstances and you grew\nup but some studies actually suggest\nthat their their changes at the\nepigenetic level which is the activation\nor on activation of genes which get\nturned on in the mother and then\nactually get passed on to the child\ngenetic yeah or in their DNA\nbut yeah so there's we can you know have\na separate conversation about\nreincarnation and past lives and all\nthat stuff yeah but I want to get to two\nquestions if that's okay so one question\nis Lucy are you using so elmond Reina\nasks Lucy are you using other people's\nstandards to judge yourself are you\ntrying to see yourself through the eyes\nof others unsuccessfully [ __ ] yeah no\nyou're right you're right yeah I do\njudge myself by other people standards\nespecially with the content that I'm\ninto creating I'm always like oh like I\nneed to be like this to be like\nspiritual or I need to be like this -\nyeah you're right yeah yeah I do judge\nmyself by other people's standards like\ncuz my standard I don't [ __ ] judge\nanyone\nI think everyone's like I'm like yo you\nlive in your best life like you go go\nyou know I I don't\nmyself by my own standards I'd be a haha\nI feel a lot happier in that's exactly\nwhat I do people kind of my oh my god my\nbrain yeah good job for a chat\nyeah so someone else so Morphin morph\nman 30 asks so in a sense Amy is the\ndevil card who Amy's the devil card who\nhas things dragging her down and Lucy is\nthe hermit walking her own path\nno I guess this person I'm saying to the\nTarot yeah yeah that's architects at the\nTarot is that can you explain that to us\nyes card is this person or it's it's a\nnon-physical thing that makes you feel\ntrapped\num it's usually dark it's demonized it's\nthe devil Cod it's usually symbolized\nwith like addiction things a taboo it's\nthe it's the things that make you like\nfeel like physically constrained and\ntrapped in something when there's no one\nactually holding you in anything it's\njust judgment and usually the best way\nto kind of get out with it is to like\nlaugh it off and not be so serious and\nthen the Hermit is the archetype of\nbeing alone go in your own way he holds\nlike a lantern and he's just on his own\npath he's in solitude he's like in a\ndeep state of like reflection and of\nlike knowing himself and knowing who he\nis compared to like out outside like\njudgment and outside perspectives and\nlike beliefs and standards of like the\nrest of the world I'd be like isolate so\nlike knows himself so yeah yeah that was\ninteresting\nyeah that's cool thanks for explaining\nthat no problem so so when you stream do\nyou do like readings and stuff yes so I\ndo like a mixture of different things\nI've recently started getting into ASM\naw because I love like um I don't know I\nlove ice well it brings you into like\nthe present moment but yeah when I\nstream I have like a little queue and\npeople can come and join in and like ask\na question and then I um I like read\nlike read cause and go through those\nquestions and you know we go from any\nof like you know like what's holding me\nback right now and the cards show these\nkind of like archetypes playing out like\nin your life right now and it's supposed\nto be like a projection of your\nsubconscious mind onto cards um through\nsymbolism through archetypes and I don't\ndo like fortune-telling I think people\nhave a bit of a thing with tarot cards\nthey think it's like supposed to tell\nyour future and how I use them is like\nthis is a reflection of the processes\nthat are going on right now helping you\nnavigate the maze because it's hard to\nlike navigate when you're in it\nTarot can show you more of like the\ndifferent energies at play or like the\ndifferent archetypes like at play and\nyeah that's that's what I mainly do on\nstream we just talk like life issues and\nyou know processing things and and yeah\nbut use Tarot is like sometimes it's\nit's probably more of a crutch I could\nprobably just talk to people about that\nissues without needing the symbolism of\nlike the cards but sometimes it's uh\nit's very interesting why do you feel\nlike it the Tarot is a crutch um cuz I\nactually like even in my own style do\nyou like private like private reads but\nI don't actually use cards I can just\nquite like I don't know I I say that\nit's because I work with spirit like I\nget like answers and I just I'm able to\ntalk with people and communicate and\nconnect with them but I guess like in a\nscientific way like maybe I'm just both\nempathic and like could pick up on cues\nand relate and see um as we kind of\npointy I'm quite good at like diagnose\nlike people's malware yeah I don't know\nhow or why like I say that that spirit\nbut it might be something else you know\nit depends what you believe in really\ndoesn't it um but yeah that's kind of\nlike what I do on stream really is that\nbut I don't always die don't always\ndiagnose malware like I do you don't\nwant you died you did that to be\ndiagnosed I can do that yeah okay thanks\nfor explaining so when do you just just\nwhile we're on the topic when do you\nstream\noften you see um I think I stream on\nlike pretty much the same days as you\nWednesday friday-sunday okay as many\ndays 8 p.m. GMT no 7 p.m. GMT ok UK UK\ntime and then let's see why I think we\nhave maybe time for one or two more\nquestions so\none of the questions is how do I build\nIKEA her\nthe instructions okay so so I guess the\nlast question comes from Tom so this is\ndomination time how does one actually\nintroduce someone in a group and try to\nbuild them up about what they do\neg this is my friend he also served in\nthe military so I guess I'll go ahead\nand take this one Lucy but my first\nquestion is why do you feel like you\nhave to build up people that you\nintroduced like why is that\nyou know like why is that standard and\nand you know if you really do feel like\nthere's a particular reason to build\nthem up like so I mean I generally don't\ntry to just build up people but I will\noftentimes say something that could be\ncorn quote building them up if I feel\nit's like relevant to the conversation\nso if I'm you know talking with someone\nwho's like a medical student and they're\ninterested in let's say orthopedic\nsurgery and I'm hanging out with a buddy\nof mine who's an orthopedic surgeon I\nwill say something along the lines of\nyou know the so-and-so is a this is a\nmedical students interest ortho and so I\nthink I try to make I try to introduce\npeople in ways that are more relevant as\nopposed to like\nyou know build them up and I'd really\nwonder a little bit about why you you\nknow why building up other people and\nconversations is important like I know\nin general like it's nice to introduce\npeople and sort of you know try to say\ngood things about them but just the\nyeah so like if you're on Tom is asking\na follow-up question and that's like\nlet's say we're at twitchcon and I'm\nintroducing dr. kay to the other\nstreamers I might say this is dr. kay\nhe's a Harvard psychiatrist an\nincredible mental health treatment yeah\nso I think that's fine all right so I\nthink that's relevant so I try to think\nabout things is is like what's relevant\nlike what is that what is the person\nthat you're going to be talking about\nlike because when you give details about\nsomeone when you introduce them you're\nframing the conversation you're teeing\nup the conversation to go in a\nparticular way right like if I'm if I'm\ntalking to a buddy of mine who's single\nand there's like someone else that I\nwant to set them up with I will\nintroduce the two of them and I will say\nyou know this is my buddy Tom he's\nsingle and this is by my friend Helen\nshe's single - and then like that super\nawkward but it's like you know it's\nteeing up the conversation in a\nparticular way or I'll say something\nlike Oh like this is Tom he's super into\nfitness and this is Helen she super\nwants to be into fitness and and so like\nthat's you know so I try to make things\nrelevant and then of course you're not\ngonna say anything negative about people\nbut I think you know take a step back\nfrom from the ego and just just say\nwhat's relevant\nand that looks like\nokay so hi it's Ava asks how do you deal\nwith anxiety when the wave just feels\ntoo high to ride out so I'm gonna start\nwith something that Lucy said and Lucy\nif you have thoughts about this I I\nfigured this question is a little bit\nmore directed towards me um but you know\nso I think the first thing to recognize\nis that if we look at Lucy's case she\nhas some mechanisms that she goes to\nright so she was talking about how she\nturns to the tarot cards and that's kind\nof like your coping mechanism in the\nmoment and then the second thing to\nremember about anxiety waves that feel\ntoo large is that there are going to be\nanxiety waves that are too large for you\nto handle that's just gonna happen and\nwhen that happens there's going to be\nsome kind of bad outcome either you'll\nhave a panic attack you'll start you\nknow you'll turn to whatever your coping\nmechanism is so I think that like Lucy\nhas done an awesome job of like trance\ntransforming like gaming which is not a\ngreat coping mechanism but I would say\nlike better than heroine right so\nthere's like a spectrum of like let's\nsay heroine gaming tarot cards taking a\ndeep breath and just sitting with the\nfeelings like there are a lot of\ndifferent coping mechanisms you so try\nto replace trying to like move up the\nline of like matter of coping mechanisms\nbut the other thing is I just\nacknowledge that sometimes the anxiety\nis too much to deal with and just\nunderstand that things are gonna be\n[ __ ] for a little bit like if your\nanxiety is just super bad just let\nyourself be overwhelmed be like well you\nknow I was interested in talking to this\nperson but at the end of the day like\nthat's not gonna work today because I'm\njust feeling like [ __ ] but I'm just\ngonna I'm gonna look like a bumbling\nidiot for the next half hour and then I\nget to leave so that's it\nI'm Sol and oddly enough when you just\nsay to yourself like I'm Sol that's it\nI'm screwed something magical happens to\nthe anxiety which is that it goes away\nand it's kind of bizarre how that works\nwell what maybe we'll practice that one\nday\n[Music]\nso I just want to thank you\nlucify for coming on yeah and do you\nhave any questions or thoughts before we\nwrap up\nno I'm I don't think so not not yet at\nleast anyway I've got I'm gonna process\nthis a little bit because I feel like\nI've learned a lot already\num but ya know thank you for having me\non thank ya you helped I just don't feel\nlike a bit like like my brain has just\nbeen like pounded well like in a good\nway like my phone like I'm gonna well\ngood I'm glad it was it was help I\nreally am glad it was helpful to you\nLucy and I think um what I want to thank\nyou for is is because I think everything\nthat you've talked about clearly\nresonated with twitchchat\nI've been sort of anything I was a bit\nafraid like I don't know because I think\nI think the stuff that I know so I think\neveryone has an amy dot exe like that\nmalware is [ __ ] it's all over the\ninternet yeah you know it's it comes\nfrom Reddit and so everyone has it and\nit's why I think it's it's really basic\nI think the reason the stream is what it\nis is because people come on and they're\nlike authentic about what their\nexperiences and the cool thing like the\ncool thing about the stream is that\nanxiety self judgement self critical\nthoughts that's something that we all\ndeal with but somewhere along the way\nsociety stops talking about bad things\nyeah\nright you always talk about like even if\nwe think about Tom's question about like\nhow do you pump someone up when you\nintroduce them somewhere along the way\nSociety placed a value judgment on\nsaying something good about someone\ninstead of saying hey this is Lucy she\nstruggles with her own internal dialogue\nfrom time to time like we just don't\nintroduce people like that it's crazy I\nwas working with someone who was having\nreally bad anxiety and he was on a date\nwith someone from tinder and the first\nthing that he said on the date was hi my\nname is so-and-so and then he said I\nsometimes struggle with social anxiety\nso apologies if this is awkward and then\ndo you know what her answer was\nno no she said I also struggle with\nsocial anxiety thank you so much for\nsaying that they had an awesome date\nthat's like it was crazy\nI like I said it's like go in with like\ndisclaimers like oh yeah yeah call them\ndisclaim is it actually like makes you\nfeel a lot more like relax just like oh\nyeah here's my disclaimer of like my\nhuman behavior oh [ __ ] you're human too\noh my god\nand I know it's it's kind of stupid cuz\nlike I've set this standard goodbye to\nlike the standard thing they go vetted\nearlier like either it's a standard that\nI've set or like that I feel like other\npeople have set for me but it's not it's\nlike as a streamer like you're supposed\nsupposed to be like this like perfect\nperson it's like sometimes I just want\nto comment stream and like yo disclaimer\nlike I'm kind of tired I'm kind of\nanxious and I don't really know if I\nwant to be here today cuz I like what\nthose are it's like that's what that's\nthe truth that's what's going on but is\nthat like oh you don't want to like like\nseem like ungrateful but then after you\nkind of get it off your chest it's it's\nkind of gone I think yeah yeah yeah\nright so I think what Lucy what you're\ndescribing is exactly what hi it's Ava\nwas asking which is like what do you do\nwhen the the urge of anxiety is too high\nand you can't surf it you just say like\nOh like hey this is just gonna be bad\nand somehow you gain power over that\nnegative emotion I just acknowledge and\nget admitting it accepting it and that's\nwhat you should do with Amy dot exe yeah\nI think yeah I think I don't know if\nit's like in society like we were like\nashamed of like the gem that comes along\nwith just saying like hey this is my Amy\nEXE like here's my [ __ ]\ncuz I think with the whole like social\nmedia thing nowadays it's like used to\nlike manufacturing yourself to like be\nperfect to then deep down everyone's got\nthis Amy\nexe runnin and it's like oh [ __ ] like\nwhat's wrong with me like why why does\neveryone else look so like perfect Yeah\nright because what's happening is are\nare the versions of people that we're\nseeing or\ncoming more and more manufacturer yeah\nso we it's just monkey-see monkey-do\nlike that's how we are and so we think\nthat we since we see everyone going on\nvacation to like Hawaii and the Bahamas\nand things like that we think that's\nwhat we should be doing right and so\nanyway thanks a lot for coming on thanks\na lot for you know being open about your\nstuff I think it resonated with a lot of\npeople and and good luck you know\ngetting rid of your malware yeah no\nproblem thank you so much and thank you\nyes and and how do we how do we hook\npeople up on stream with like\ninformation about your streams we Tommy\nI know it's been going ok so people have\nbeen doing it fantastic thank you yeah\nyeah so oh there we go\nthey just posted it yeah so you guys\nshould check that out because you know\nsometimes taro she's good at diagnosing\npeople too\nand sometimes a little bit of taro can\nprovide a nice framework to understand\npeople so thanks a lot you see yourself\nbye YouTube bye"
