    "transcript": "you're familiar with Bro Science no when\nyou go to the gym mhm and you hang out\nin the gym environment there's a lot of\nguys that walk around to claim that they\nhave the right way of exercising the\nright way it might be the right way for\nthem but if I in medicine try and take\nwhat worked for one person and try and\nscale it I'm going to run into a\ndisaster yeah that's why I think it's\nbetter to look at population and then\ntry and narrow it that's why I think the\nprinciple of starting with one and going\nup and generalizing is way more\nproblematic no no yeah but so this is a\nfundamental misunderstanding the whole\npoint of ayurve is you don't generalize\none to the broader population you\ndevelop a system that works for each\nperson ideally that's what their\napproach is there's no generalization or\nI mean there's some generalization some\nnecessary generalization but their whole\npoint is that when someone comes to you\nand this guy is a Bro Science and he\nsays this works for you the aurbic\ndoctor says the next person comes along\nand they try to figure out what will\nwork for you specifically they don't\ncare about populations they care about\nindividuals mhm"
