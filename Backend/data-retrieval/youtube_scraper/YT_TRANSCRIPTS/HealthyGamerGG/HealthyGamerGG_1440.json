    "transcript": "and then that's all you need and then\nlike just be straight with her because\nif if this is what you're doing the\nwhole time if you're just going like\nthis like hey hey hey hey hey that's\n[ __ ] creepy right\nso like flirting too much is like how\nyou become a creep\nso the first question comes from Andrew\nH I have difficulty meeting women and I\nfeel like I want to curb my sexual\ndesire because that's something I can't\nhave even though I still want it also I\nknow that focusing on my life and\nimproving myself for better pathways to\nfinding a relationship I just get the\nfeeling that if I just focus on myself\nall the time then I will miss avoid\nopportunities that come up how would you\nsuggest to reconcile those two feelings\nalso most of the social events outings I\nattend are mostly male-dominated on the\nother hand the things that I do go go\ntoo with women I end up focusing on the\nevent and enjoying myself do you think\nyou could shed any light on my situation\ntalk about a good question okay so let's\njust think about this for a second okay\nso the first thing that he's saying is\nso it sounds like Andrews done his\nhomework right so there's a common sense\nso if you're interested in meeting let's\njust assume a heterosexual relationship\nwhere we're thinking from the\nperspective of the man for a moment so\nif you're a dude who's interested in\nmeeting women one of the most common\npieces of advice is that you should just\nfocus on yourself and like the women\nwill come I think that's a really great\nattitude and we'll talk a little bit\nabout why that is but I think Andrews\nquestion is really good because he's you\nknow he's done some research and he's\nsort of found out that okay like for\nexample he goes to an event and he just\nends up like trying to enjoy himself and\nwhat he's heard is that unless you know\nif you just focus on yourself and you\nyou try to have a good time that like\nthe women will come and then he's doing\nthat he's like dude where are the women\nI was promised the women like where are\nthe women I'm focusing on myself I'm not\nchasing after people I'm not being a\nnice guy there's no one itis you know\nthat that's the like I was promised\nwomen so he's trying to figure out how\ncan i reconcile finding a relationship\nand looking for a relationship with sort\nof this idea of just focusing on\nyourself and I think that's in a weird\nway there's there's no simple answer\nthere except that it's a balance between\nthe two so I think the reason that\npeople say that you should focus on\nyourself is because a lot of dudes focus\ntoo much on a relationship right and\nwhat happens is they start to invest\ntheir time in a particular person so\nlet's talk a little bit about nice guys\nin the friend zone and like how guys end\nup in the friend zone so the friend zone\nstarts with a lack of confidence so if\nyou're interested in a woman and you're\nafraid that if you ask her out she's\ngonna say no you exhibit some degree of\navoidance oh you don't put yourself out\nthere you don't ask her out and then\nyou're kind of afraid that like she's\ngonna\nnooo so like what do you do in that\nsituation you want to increase your\nchances of her saying yes and how do you\ndo that like you do nice stuff for her\nright so if you can get her to like you\nmore then when you ask her out she's\nmore likely to say yes it's completely\nlogical so you start to invest in the\nrelationship you start to pick her up\nfrom the airport you start\nhelp her out when she's sick you bring\nher chicken soup you help her with her\nhomework and then there's like the most\ndreaded thing which is that like you\nlisten to her when she you know is\nbitching about the dudes that she's\ndating and then like if you get like\nreally deep into it and you really lose\nsight of all perspective then you do\nthings like get her flowers on\nValentine's Day as a friend\nright yes I'm at the Stromer saying you\npowerlevel her in mmo's\nabso-fucking-lutely\nthat's it right so you invest and the\nidea here is in your mind there's a part\nof your mind that says she's gonna turn\nme down if I say no if I ask her out\nso what can I do to like increase the\nchances of her liking how can I\ndemonstrate my value to her and you\ninvest in the relationship you invest in\nthe relationship and you invest in the\nrelationship and then one day your love\nreaches a critical mass and you confess\nyour love for her right it's not you\ndon't ask her out like you confess your\nlove like that's it apples and oranges\nthe scenario that we're talking about is\nthat your love and the tension around\nthat love Rises and Rises and Rises and\nthen there's a confession there's I've\nloved you like a goddamn anime you\nconfess your love for her and not what\nhappens as she says the dreaded words I\nthink of you like a friend I don't think\nof you that right and so then what does\nthat do to your confidence it knocks\nyour confidence down a peg\nand so you kind of get over it you meet\nanother girl\nand then your confidence is even lower\nso as you enter the second relationship\nyou feel like you have to invest more\nbecause the problem was that you didn't\ndo enough for her you didn't demonstrate\nyour value you didn't get her to see\nthat that\nyou didn't like show her how caring you\nare so you kind of double down on your\nstrategy and then you like go back to\nlike doing even more stuff for her\nand so that cycle repeats itself and\neach time you get rejected you feel less\nconfident\nand then you\nfeel like you have to do a lot more\nstuff to win her over and then at some\npoint these people get so frustrated\nthat they like go to the Internet and\nthen someone tells them or like friends\nthey tell them hey man like stop\ninvesting all your time and women just\ninvest your time in yourself like just\ngo to the gym work out take care of\nyourself and then as confidence Rises\nbecause you're taking care of yourself\nand it becomes easier to\nask women out so like that's where the\nconundrum comes from right like do you\nchase after women or do you invest in\nyourself and I think that the simple\nanswer is like it's got to be a little\nbit of both right because I think what\nwhat Andrew H I unfortunately is\ndiscovering is that just because you\nstart investing in yourself doesn't mean\nthat women start throwing themselves at\nyou in this this this is a brutal truth\nthat especially people who are doctors\nrealize like like a bunch of my buddies\nfrom med school they're kind of thinking\nlike oh you know like chicks dig doctors\nso once I've become a doctor I'm gonna\nhave to beat them off with a stick and\nthey become a doctor and then suddenly\nnothing happens\nthat's just and they're surprised so I\nthink what you've got to do is something\nin the middle right so like understand\nthat investing in a particular\nrelationship with the hope that she's\ngoing to fall in love with you is\ngenerally speaking a mistake\nand just waiting for women to come along\nor the gender that you're attracted to\nto just come along and be amazed by it\nhow amazing you are is also going to\nfail so instead if you meet a girl I\nthink you should be authentic with her\nand generally speaking what women find\ncreepy is not just like is not you\nasking them out but just you know like\nis like when you kind of you flirt and\nyou're kind of like unclear or you're\nyou you like nag them and all that other\n[ __ ] that people swear by on on like the\nred pill and the pickup artist forums\nand things like that\nyou just like treat them like a human\nbeing and you say like you walk up to\nthem you say hey\nare things going like\nI've really enjoyed being in class with\nyou even past couple of weeks and I'd\nlike to get to know you better\nare you interested in grabbing dinner\nsometime\nand that's it and then if you want to\nyou can even throw in a little bit of\nflirt right like you can\nlike you'll grab dinner sometime that's\nall it takes\nI see that you guys want to see how well\nthat works you guys should watch the\ninterview with Anna\nright did you guys wear you guys like\nare you guys there and we can we get a\nclip of that\n[Music]\nI'm pretty sure that there was a\nso I mean you can be flirtatious we can\nwe can teach you how to flirt\nlike you guys see that right like the\nfacial expression we played this game\nbefore like the facial expression game\nbut it's like hey\nI don't\nthat's all it takes okay it's not hard\nyou don't have to you don't have to have\na long speech like you know just\nyeah like you know it's and and you\ndon't want to overdo it right it just\nyou need just a little bit of it\nand and then that's all you need and\nthen like just be straight with her\nbecause if if this is what you're doing\nthe whole time if you're just going like\nthis like hey hey hey hey hey hey that's\n[ __ ] creepy right\nso like flirting too much is like how\nyou become a creep like just a little\nbit of flirt a lot of authenticity and\nthen move on I think that's what you got\nto do and so what I would tell Andrew\nh-i is like yeah you should continue\nlike investing in yourself\nand\nlike just you know focus on yourself but\nif you see a girl that you're attracted\nto or a dude that you can throw in a\nlittle bit of flirt and a lot of the\nflirt is in the eyebrows like flirting\ncomes from confidence and stuff like\nthat right and then\nand then just ask about be authentic\n[Music]\nyeah so I mean the other simple thing\nthat Andrew is is is not doing if we\nlisten to his questions this doesn't\nsound he like he's actually asking women\nout right like like I'm just gonna read\nthis to you again but um I have I have\ndifficulty meeting women and I feel like\nI want to curb my sexual desire because\nthat's something I can't have even\nthough I still want it so that also is a\nwhole different complex like I I mean\ncurve your sexual desire in terms of you\nknow don't be it sexually inappropriate\nwith people but if you have sexual\ndesire that's fine I think it's fine to\nyou know want to be sexually active with\nsomeone or with in general or with\nsomeone also I know that focusing on my\nlife in improving myself or better what\npathways to finding relationship I just\nget the feeling that if I focus on\nmyself all the time then I will miss\navoid opportunities that come up that's\nabsolutely true so you don't want to\nfocus on yourself all the time you want\nto focus on yourself for most of the\ntime and when you go to an event where\nthere's a woman that you're attracted to\nlike even if you've never met her you\ncan just walk up to her at the end of\nthe event and say hey you know I'm at\nthis event and I'm here to just have a\ngood time with my buddies but to be\ncompletely honest I just cannot like I\nkeep on looking at you and I'm sorry but\nI was just wondering is there any way\nthat I could buy you dinner sometime\nand then even if she shoots you down\nlike you know she's gonna smile and you\nknow she's gonna laugh\nand let your ego just take a dose of\nthat right because like even if she\nturns you down she's gonna feel amazing\nand you can feel amazing we're letting\nher feel amazing if you're not [ __ ]\ncaught up in your head\nyeah\nso it it sounds it sounds like I'm just\ntapping in a twitch chat for a second\nand so I'm confused about whether people\nwant dating advice or they want to date\nme\nhow do you work up the courage to do\nthat you know what is courage like what\ndo you mean courage\nbut what are you afraid of\nright like what are you afraid of that\nshe's gonna say no what there's a decent\nchance she's gonna say no\nlike this is something so if you guys\nare having trouble meeting women you\nguys got to come on stream and we got to\ntalk about this\nbecause like your you're so afraid of\nthe possible outcome that you're not\nwilling to even try like that's the\nproblem\nlike what are you afraid of that she's\ngonna say no like you're gonna that's\nfine like why isn't it okay for her to\nsay no\nand this is where like you have to think\na little bit about how you view yourself\nright so you're afraid that you're not\nworth dating and so since you try to\nkeep that fear of your lack of value as\na partner at bay you try to like put\nyour head in the sand and if you get any\nsort of external evidence to support the\nidea that you're not worth dating then\nthat's too much for you to bear\nso like if you want to be like this all\nhas to if you're having trouble asking\nwomen out like you've got to stop and\nthink a little bit about yourself and\nthink like what do i how do you feel\nabout yourself do you feel like you're\nworthwhile today do you think like\nyou're a worthy person to date\nlike\nwhat what is the answer to that question\nI think that's what we really have to\ndig into like why do you feel like\nyou're not worthy of dating because if\nyou feel like you're worthy of dating\nyou should be comfortable enough to ask\nsomeone out and you just acknowledge\nthat you know chances are like like\nlet's say 50 60 % of women are in\nrelationships\nforty percent I don't know I don't know\nwhat the number is and if they're in\nrelationships like there's a decent\nchance they're gonna say no but what I\nwant you to do when you ask a girl out\nis like I want you to watch her face and\nthen ask yourself did I make her feel\ngood by asking her out because this is\nan important thing because if your\n[ __ ] creeper and you pay attention to\nthem then you're gonna see that you\ndidn't make them feel good and that's a\nproblem\nshould know that\nand if you did like even if she turns\nyou down like if you make her feel good\nlike that's you know that's fine\nyou could that's okay like you made her\nfeel good like what that means is that\nif she was available like if you made\none girl like like feel appreciated and\nyou made her feel attractive by asking\nher out like you can do that again just\nget out of your own head\nall right moving on to the next question"
