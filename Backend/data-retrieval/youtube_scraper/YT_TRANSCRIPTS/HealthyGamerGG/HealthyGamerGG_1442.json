    "video_title": "Why MENTAL ILLNESS is Rising.",
    "transcript": "like the number of casualties from\nmilitary conflicts in the last decade is\nlike less than how many men choose to\ntake their own life in one year\nbut I think the diagnosis of the problem\nis beautifully put right and I think the\nbest thing I think chat was talking\nabout this\nwhy do I feel like [ __ ] even though all\nof my necessities are met and I also\nlike this sentence almost everything\nthat's enjoyable feels like it's lit\nlacks of central meaning so the first\nthing is I want to know like do you guys\nwant me to read more suffer do you guys\nactually want to talk about things\nI I am kind of confused about I feel\nlike I should talk about this\num but I need to know okay so the first\nthing is do you guys know how in the\nlast seven years you guys know how much\nthe suicide rate under the age of 18 has\nchanged\nlet's start there\nthat's a yes-or-no question well played\nyeah so it's gone up it's gone up by\nabout 50% in seven years\nright and that's like that's crazy so\nthe first thing is I think if you guys\nare making observations about the world\ndo your best to find data okay so I\nthink it's fine to have theories and the\ninternet loves theories right like\npeople on reddit or like always posting\ntheir opinions about [ __ ] but ultimately\nI'm a scientist so like I want data so\nthe first question is is here oh\nleukemias premise correct are people\nsuffering at a greater rate than they\nused to and actually the answer is yes\nso we have evidence so mental health has\nnow surpassed cancer and cardiovascular\ndisease in the United States is the\nnumber one contributor of morbidity and\nmortality mental health now costs this\nnation more than cancer and heart\nattacks so it's it's like it's crazy but\nthe data actually supports exactly what\nhero leukemia is noticing which is that\nlike the primary problem we face today\nis not physical its mental so as we look\nback like let's say 50 years a hundred\nyears 200 years a thousand years the\nmain sources of stress or challenges\nthat humans faced were not mental they\nwere physical like people had trouble\nfinding enough food people had trouble\ngetting eaten by like lions and tigers\npeople had trouble like dealing with\nwinters and there like these like\nfamines and stuff from like the early\n1900's and 1800s that like wiped out\nlarge swathes of people like there was a\nflu in the last hundred years I forget\nwhich one it was that wiped out like\nfifteen to thirty percent of the\npopulation of Europe or something like\n15 percent of the population died from\nthe flu the flu doesn't really kill\nanyone anymore\nso the challenges that was it Spanish\nflu I don't remember\nso the challenges that Humanity is\nfacing are changing like it's not\ninfections that are killing us anymore\nit's not even like I mean chronic\nillnesses are killing us but we've\ngotten way better in terms of like\ncardiovascular disease the leading cause\nof like problems in people's lives now\nor is mental health so the question is\nwhy\nwhy\nand I think the answer in my mind is\njust it's a little bit simplistic and\nit's because we're not worrying about\nthe other [ __ ] anymore because we don't\ndie from it like I could get the flu but\nlike I'm not I don't stress about the\nflute right what I stress about now is\nmeaning fulfillment and at the same time\nthat we're sort of caught in the process\nof conquering physical illness our\nbrains are being a sale to by technology\nso I don't think we realized what we\nwere doing when like you know people\ntalk about the end of the world being\nlike nuclear apocalypse\nyou guys know what I think is gonna be\nthe end of humanity you know what I\nreally think is gonna be the end of\nhumanity virtual reality girlfriends and\nboyfriends attached to sexual\ninstruments with haptic feedback does\nanybody know what that means\nyou guys know what happed ik feedback is\nso like someone is going to develop a\ndevice like so about 15 years ago I was\ninvolved with my dad was actually\ninvolved with a really interesting like\ncancer diagnosis device so this was back\nwhen like what this is still going on\nbut I don't know if you guys know this\nbut\nyou know like the Middle East has a lot\nof American institutions that are\nopening up branches they're like\nespecially your hospitals like Cleveland\nClinic and like Duke and things like\nthat are all like opening up like\nMedical like hospitals and stuff in in\nthe Middle East like especially like in\naround the UAE\nand and so so my dad was involved in the\nproduction of a device which was a glove\nwhich would allow him so that so he puts\non a glove in Houston Texas at MD\nAnderson and someone in Hawaii is\nwearing a glove and what happens is the\nperson who's wearing the glove then\npalpates a breast right so like when\nyou're doing cancer diagnosis for breast\ncancer like the the the doctor feels the\nbreast and you like feel for lumps and\nthen what my dad feels so like the the\nthe glove measures the resistance and\nthen translates that feeling and then\ncreates a sensation on my dad's hand so\nhe can like palpate a breast from like a\nthousand miles away\nright so like the sexual stuff aside\nlike it's a clinical diagnosis right and\nso that technology is going to start\ngetting used by virtual reality suit so\nwhat's going to happen is we're gonna\nlike put on a haptic feedback suit so\nI'm gonna put on a pair of scrubs that\nhas all these like pressure sensors and\nwhat's gonna happen is there's gonna be\nlike some sort of like genital device\nright like something on the spectrum of\nlike a dildo or vibrator or like flesh\nlight or something like that and there's\ngonna be virtual reality pornography\nthat you're going to be able to feel\nand then like somewhere along this\ndoomsday scenario is going to be like an\nAI that's a girlfriend so you're going\nto go on virtual dates with an AI that\nthrows temper tantrums and then like\nsometimes doesn't put out and\nand then you'll be able to like have\nyour sexual needs gratified and then\nyou're gonna stop like procreating with\nregular humans and then the human race\nis going to die out but these are the\npressures like this is not something\nthat our brain was designed to deal with\nit's scary\nand on the other end of the spectrum\nlike that's like a doomsday apocalypse\nin this scenario but on the other end of\nthe spectrum is the like button\nyou guys know like when when Facebook\nblew up it was because of the like\nbutton\nlike Facebook was a thing that college\nkids used until the like button\nand we're in a society where like\nthere's all this kind of FOMO kind of\nstuff like people talk about this stuff\nright they talk about FOMO\nand everyone was envious of other people\nbut like envy wasn't shoved in your face\neight hours a day like you didn't just\nyou know you didn't wake up open up your\nbedroom window and see a beach with\nsomeone else like hanging out on the\nbeach and then you would put on your\ncoat and walk into like the\nMassachusetts winter and then walk to\nyour job and take the subway like we're\nbombarded with all of the amazing stuff\nthat people are doing and so this is\nkind of like a huge assault on our\npsychology because our brains are\ndesigned to compare they're designed to\ncompare that's what they're made for\nlike monkeys compare humans compare it's\njust what we do\nand so technology is taking advantage of\nall of the stuff in our brain the other\nbasic problem is as our basic needs get\nmet like we think about Maslow's\nhierarchy of needs like food and shelter\nand stuff we're sort of getting taken\ncare of you know you have experiments\nwith universal basic income in some\nparts of Scandinavia and so previously\nin society we needed people to produce\nstuff for society to function but why do\nwe as a society value jobs because jobs\nwere necessary for the function of\nhumanity like you needed to have a\ncooper to make a barrel and you needed\nto have a blacksmith to do things and\nyou needed to have a farmer but it's\ntechnology produces as is like machines\nget better\nhis automation gets better as lab-grown\nmeat comes online like what do we need\npeople for we don't need people for\nanything\nit's like we don't need people for stuff\nyou can now grow in once like in one\nstory block you can grow like a thousand\nacres worth of lettuce on one square\nblock right we have lab-grown meat so\ninstead of like pastures and animals\nlike we can just grow that [ __ ] in lap\nand all the big like fast food producers\nare actually investing in this stuff so\nI think it's gonna be edible in the next\n10 15 years and so human beings don't\nneed to have like you don't need to work\nfor like food and shelter and stuff like\nin the night you know a lifetime it's\ngoing to happen\nso the more that our needs get met the\nmore we move ups Maslow's hierarchy of\nneeds and then we get to this thing\ncalled self-actualization I think mental\nhealth is somewhere in that realm right\nlike that's the spectrum of mental\nhealth meaning purpose I'm a no one and\nthen not only are we army needs getting\nbad but then we have like social media\nthat's telling us that other people are\nlike more important than we are\nright and that's where you get this\nsituation this is why mental illness is\nhigher than ever before because our our\nour survive like our other needs are\nbeing met so like the mind is what's\nleft the mind is where the major source\nof stresses if you think about you know\nour our sympathetic nervous system are\nour fight-or-flight system was designed\nto help us against tigers and snakes and\nnow what does it do what is it what do\nwe get stressed out up mortgages\nquarterly reports\ngetting a promotion at the end of the\nyear our sympathetic nervous system was\nnot designed to be active for months at\na time which is what it is now if you're\na college senior with a liberal arts\ndegree and a pile of debt your\nsympathetic nervous system your\nadrenaline system is going haywire for a\nyear it's not designed to do that we\nwere supposed to see a tiger in the span\nof 15 minutes run away kill it or get\neaten that's what our nervous system was\ndesigned for it's not designed for these\nprotracted periods of stress\nthat's also why obesity is getting worse\nlike I know we can talk about obesity in\nthe physiology of obesity but stress\nliterally makes you fat it literally\nmakes you fat so when you have a high\nlevel of cortisol\nwhat happens is cortisol mobilizes blood\nsugar so it causes your body to like\nbreak down fat and protein and glycogen\nand put blood blood I put sugar in your\nblood because the purpose of cortisol\nwas after you run away from a tiger for\nthe next 4 to 12 hours the tiger may be\nsniffing your your footprints and may be\nshowing up so you need to have a lot of\nenergy available so your body would put\na bunch of sugar into your blood so that\nyou have easily available energy over\nthe next 12 hours\nand so what we used to do like what\nyou'd use like if you see a tiger and\nyou run away\nyou're gonna hike for the next eight\nmiles to get away from the area that the\nTigers and that's what cortisol is\ndesigned for is to provide you with\nenergy so you can hike eight miles now\nwhen I'm worried about making mortgage\nat the end of the month like what do I\ndo I sit here in this chair and so then\nmy body gets confused my body's like we\nhave a bunch of sugar in our blood we\nmust have just eaten a meal let's\nrelease some insulin\nand then if we release some insulin then\nwhat it's going to do is cause that\nsugar to be stored as fat so literally\nwhat cortisol does is cause muscle\nbreakdown to increase your blood sugar\nand then your body your your pancreas is\nlike oh [ __ ] we have a bunch of blood\nsugar because we don't burn it like we\nwere supposed like we used to do and\nthen it's like oh we must have had a big\nmeal so let's release insulin so then\nwhat happens is you get this okay\nso\nhow am I gonna do this real you get this\nthis is called a buffalo huh\nthis is what happens when you have a\ncortisol tumor\nthis is literally what a cortisol tumor\ndoes to your body look at that\n[Music]\nand this is the [ __ ] that we have done\nthis is where it stressed us we're\nstressed all the time this is what's\nhappening to you physiologically\nobesity rates in this country or 30% is\nthat due to sugary beverages sure\nit's also due to stress stress literally\nmakes you fat people talk about stress\neating like it's a psychological problem\nit's not a [ __ ] psychological problem\nit's a physiologic problem\nand like look at this\nlike this is what stress is doing to us\n[Music]\nso I think my hero leukemia spot-on\nright that something is changing in our\nsociety\nthat we're killing ourselves at a higher\nrate than ever before\nand you could talk about you know like\ngender dynamics a lot I mean I think\nthat there's a lot of gender inequality\nbut I think it's shocking that\nlet me just think about you see if I can\nfind the statistic\n[Music]\nmen killed so 80% of suicides in this\ncountry are men right why are men\nkilling themselves I think we have like\nsomething like thirty or seventy\nthousand people a year killed themselves\nthirty to seventy thousand men a year\nwhich is an astronomical number like the\nnumber of casualties from military\nconflicts in the last decade is like\nless than how many men choose to take\ntheir own life in one year\nlike that's staggering\nso I I do think that there's a lot of\ngender discrimination in in this country\nand in the world and I think that things\nare not equal between men and women and\nI think that a lot of men are really\nstruggling right now and because of all\nthis dialogue around gender\ndiscrimination like men don't feel open\nabout sharing like you can't like the\nmale victim is like it's hard to be a\nmale victim nowadays\nright because there are a privileged\nclass I see this a lot because I work\nwith like these men come to my office\nand it's hard because they can't\ncomplain\nand so I think that there's the\npressures I think by Hiro leukemia has\nit spot-on\nthat why is it that most advanced\ncountries in the world are also\ncountries with the highest rates of\nsuicide\nit's because the best of the most\ndeveloped countries push us towards the\ntop of Maslow's hierarchy of needs\nright so that mental illness is what\nbecomes more problematic social media\nand technology definitely exacerbate\nthat problem\n[Music]\nhumans have always questioned the\nmeaning of life and it seems like we're\ngetting further from the answer as time\ngoes by absolutely because the meaning\nof life used to be like you didn't have\nthe luxury of the meaning of life\nlike my grandmother grew up with it like\n11 people living in like a 10 by 10 room\nlike literally like 11 people living in\nthat room\nand\nlife expectancy in her day was like in\nthe 50s so the meaning of life was\n[ __ ] surviving that was the meaning\nof life back then we conquered that so\nnow we have to find more ephemeral and\ndiaphanous meanings of life\nit's these subtle things it's like\nDharma\npurpose meaning like before it was just\nabout getting by like all this is\nboomers nowaday they're talking about\nlike lack of purpose was like because\ntheir job was just like they they were\njust trying to get by and now we're\ndoing a pretty good job of getting by so\nnow our challenges are more mental\nand I would be a little bit careful\num about assuming that let people were\nhappier before like that's a really\ncommon bias I don't really know if I\nhave data to support that like everyone\nsays that right like life was simpler\nwhen we used to live in nature and\nthings like that\nI mean infant mortality used to be\nsomething like 30% I find it hard to\nbelieve that like a thousand years ago\nwhen infant mortality was 30% like\npeople were happier\nlike I'm not sure"
