    "transcript": "so it's victimizing yourself a coping\nmechanism victimizing yourself is a\nhabit right it's something that you\nlearn to do it it's something that you\nbecome comfortable with and the mind has\na really really bizarre like it has a\nreally bizarre truth which is that it\nprefers the comfortable to the good so\nif your mind has a choice between\npicking something that it's familiar\nwith and picking something that's good\nit's actually gonna pick something\nthat's familiar with and what I want you\nguys to understand about victimizing\nyourself is that someone who victimizes\nthemself is in an abusive relationship\nwith themselves and we have to remember\nthat people stay in abusive\nrelationships human beings saying\nabusive relationships all the time and\nthen the question becomes why do people\nstay in abusive relationships like let's\nbe scientific about it right let's not\njudge and say that oh that's stupid\nlet's ask ourselves as scientists why\ndoes the human mind do what it does why\non earth does someone stay with someone\nwho like hits them like what the is\ngoing on in their mind and we have to\naccept that there's a damn good reason\nthat they are in that relationship\nbecause there's got to be a damn good\nreason if they're in a relationship\nwhere someone treats them like do\nyou have to think about scales being\nweighed and if someone's treating you\nlike like that's really heavy so in\norder to stay in that relationship\nyou've got to have something really\npowerful to balance it and that's that\nthe mind prefers the familiar to the\ngood and the reason that people\nvictimize themselves is because they're\nfamiliar with it right like why does\nJessica tell her so in her mind the part\nof herself that beats herself up is\nbasically like a copy-paste\nit's a copypasta of her dad it's her\ndad's voice that lives in her mind it's\nexactly what her dad would be saying in\nthose moments that's what she tells\nherself she learned that and why on\nearth does she continue to victimize\nherself it's because her mind prefers\nthe known to the unknown and that makes\nsense right like why do people stay in\nabusive relationships it's because they\ndon't know what else is down there they\ndon't know if loneliness is next they\ndon't know if they're ever gonna\nfind someone down the road and think\nabout that for a second is someone in an\nabusive relationship feels like they're\na piece of and if you really\nbelieve that you're a piece of then\nwhy do you think that you like the grass\nwould be greener on the other side you\nbelieve that the grass is greener on the\nother side if you have faith in yourself\nas a human being to make it greener but\nif you're in an abusive relationship you\ndon't think that you're a good person\nand you don't think that you're gonna\nfind someone better you don't believe\nthat you're worthy of someone better so\nyou're gonna stay in the abusive\nrelationship and victimizing yourself is\nan abusive relationship with yourself\nright that's what it really is and we\nstay in those because we don't think\nthat we can find a better way she\ndoesn't think that there's a part of\nJessica that doesn't understand that\nthere is a better way out there because\nher dad taught her this since she was\nlike one-year-old or even younger\nthere were times honestly where she was\nprobably crying when she was six months\nold and her dad did not pick her up and\ncomfort her and that left its mark\nthat's trauma what we're dealing with\nhere is not like anxiety or depression\nit's trauma and the reason that people\nvictimize themselves is because that's\nwhat they were taught to do monkey see\nmonkey do"
