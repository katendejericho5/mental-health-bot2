    "transcript": "so the first answers if you guys have\nbeen diagnosed with an actual mental\nillness or you really think that you're\nmental like you have true like tried and\ntrue depression you should go see a\nprofessional alright so like I can tell\nyou guys about this stuff but I\nultimately really can I can't treat you\nover the internet and nothing I say in\nthe next 10 minutes is gonna cure you\nI'm good\nbut I'm not that good so PTSD is like a\nreal thing and like if you really have\nit you should go work through it with a\nprofessional because while you can\novercome a lot of people can overcome\nparts of mental illness or even overcome\nmental illness on their own I think\nthat's what's happened in the history of\nhumanity for example like Wims Winston\nChurchill and like Abraham Lincoln both\nhad really bad depression\nand they managed to do okay in life so\nit's possible with the cool thing about\nthe roguelike that you live in is\nthere's a shop and you can just go to\nthe shop and get some mental health\ntreatment so go and get some mental\nhealth treatment like that's the first\nthing you should do like go and like\nwork with an individual human being and\nthis is some Rando on Twitch who's like\ntalking to 115 people at the same time\nit's like a real person who is dedicated\nto help you is gonna do way better than\nI can ever do unless that dedicated\nperson is me and you wind up in my\noffice so go and actually get help so\nthis is another problem that gamers have\nthey don't go and get help you guys\nwatch twitch which I love I'm grateful\nyou're making me successful fantastic\nand at the same time like go and\nactually get some help\nand like go talk to someone and this is\nwhere so a lot so someone saying that I\ndon't know you're sounding a lot better\nthan all the shrinks I've had over the\ndecades there's a part of me that's\ninclined to agree with you because I\nthink that a lot of mental health\nprofessionals are operating from a model\nthat's a little bit outdated and this is\nwhere I would say if you want to try to\nfind like a mental health professional\ngo see three don't go see one and like\nbecause mental health professionals are\nall about fit like it's not about\ntraining\nit's not about pedigree it's about fit\nso go and find someone who fits with you\nbut goes because I want you to see three\npeople then pick the one that you like\nthe best it's like if you're going out\nand buying a car you don't go to a like\na car dealership and just like get the\nfirst car that they have available right\nyou go and you test drive two or three\nthings and go and meet three people and\nthen try to figure out who like who do I\nfeel like I like and who gets me the\nother thing to think a little bit about\nis like see if you can find someone on\nthe younger end so the average like\npsychiatrist in in America is like 55 so\nI go so go find someone who's played a\nvideo game like start there if you have\na problem game because then they're\ngonna understand you a little bit better\nand it could help help right I'm not\nsaying that all like the psychoanalysts\nor that like I mean a lot of them\nbrilliant but like I mean one of them\ntold me that yeah like I was asking her\nlike why do people play video games and\nher answer is for the same reason they\nget tattoos and I was like lady you may\nbe brilliant and a professor at the\nHarvard Medical School but you don't\nknow what the [ __ ] you're talking about\nso go and find someone\nthat's really what you should do\n[Music]\num but I don't think you guys were\nlooking for that simple of an answer so\ndealing with in reducing PTSD let's\nstart there so the first thing to\nunderstand is that PTSD is actually your\nbody like learning an inappropriate\nresponse right so if we think about\nsomeone who has like a flashback or let\ngets triggered by something like if you\nhave so I've done a fair amount of work\nwith veterans and if you have like\nbetter like if you have like someone who\nis like in Afghanistan or Iraq and they\nlike you know got like like a missile\nwas fired at them and then they like\nthey have a trigger every time they hear\nlike a you know muffler expect go bang\nor a door slam your body is actually\nlike has learned from a survival\nstandpoint that loud sudden sounds mean\ndeath and so when you come back to the\nUnited States your body can't unlearn\nthat because it's a really important\nlesson to learn\nright that's how so PTSD the first thing\nto understand is that like trauma is\nyour body trying to adapt to a really\nbad situation and so what you have to\nteach it how to do is to like unadapted\napp to a difference situation so this is\nwhy people will do things like exposure\ntherapy and stuff like that so a lot of\nways to deal with trauma but I think the\nfirst thing to understand is that it's\nan adaptive mechanism which needs to\nsort of be under that and beyond that\nlike if somebody has trauma and you guys\nwant to like come on stream and talk\nabout it we can do that otherwise it's\nlike really hard for me to I mean it's\nreally hard for me to answer that\nquestion in five minutes I could talk\nabout it for an hour about trauma or I\ncould talk to a person but it's hard to\ngive you a substantive answer in like\nfive minutes\nbecause it's complicated\nthe second thing is\nyou know how do you overcome depression\nwhen you can't get yourself out of bed\nand the house and feel hopeless every\nday so like I would really think about\ngetting professional help if that's your\nsituation\nbecause gamers don't reach out for help\nbut like sometimes human beings like\nhuman beings are communal we're communal\ncreatures like we need help from each\nother from time to time\nand if you need it like if you need help\nlike go and get help it's not rocket\nscience like if you're having trouble\ngetting out of bed everyday like go and\nsee a professional this is one I would\nthink about something like medication\nbecause I think you can overcome a lot\nof depression with like meditation and\nyoga and diet but like all of that stuff\nrequires you to get out of bed alright\nso I recently had someone in my practice\nwho didn't want to start medication and\nthey wanted to do yoga and stuff and\nthat's great so I asked him like how\nmany times a week were you able to do\nyoga and they're saying once a week but\nlike once a week is not going to cure\nyour depression like it's just not going\nto work the dose is not high enough so I\nrecommended a start medication now\nthey're doing yoga everyday the six\nmonths from now we're gonna try it\nstopping the medication if they stick\nwith the yoga and if they stick with the\nmeditation then we'll see what happens\nright so if you're really having trouble\ngetting out of bed then you should\nreally the best advice is to see a\nprofessional but I've got two other\npoints for you the first is think about\nyour diet so there is a lot of there's a\nlot of recent research which shows that\ndiet is very impactful depression\nAyurveda has been saying this for\nthousands of years so first-line\ntreatment for depression and I revived\nas dietary change change their diet\nchange the diet change the mind\nand what that practically means is like\nhow can I say so there was a recent\nstudy where they took happy mice they\ntook depressed mice\nthey took the stool from depressed mice\nand did a stool transplant on the happy\nmice and the happy mice became depressed\ncrazy right so stool transplant is a\nwhole yeah ice-candy be depressed\nabsolutely\nso\nfascinating literature which suggests\nthat like and we're starting to seize\nthere also studies that show that people\nwho have depression have certain kinds\nof bacteria in their gut at a way higher\nlevel than people who don't have\ndepression and so I think the way the\nreason that I our vet has been curing\ndepression with diet for thousands of\nyears is because when you change your\ndiet you change your gut bacteria and\nthat's somehow a check affects your\nmental health\nso if you guys are depressed I'd think a\nlittle bit about what you're eating like\nhow many processed foods are you eating\nare you getting your fruits and veggies\nof the day you know cuz all that is\ngonna affect in people who like eat\nhealthy you guys know like when you\nstart eating healthy you start feeling\nbetter so if you're depressed I'd start\nwith some basic things like are you\ndrinking water let's start there\nsure go see a professional but at home\nstart by drinking water\nyou have soda don't drink soda\nyes so like caffeinated stuff is just\ngonna throw you out of whack it's gonna\ngive you an artificial energy boost and\nthen you're gonna crash start by\ndrinking water in terms of fruits and\nvegetables been in every morning and\npineapple there's literally I'm gonna\nfind this paper for you because you guys\nare gonna you mind has been\n[Music]\ncrap\ncan't find it too good to pass up\nI'm gonna do something really boring on\nstream\n[Music]\nfind it\ncrap\nI saw a paper about pineapple and\ndepression I think I had\nwe just look\nwe want to find this paper fruits\nyou\nyou\nlet me look\nyou\nhere we go found it\n[Music]\nyou\nthe box\nso the papers called so I'm going to\njust read from\nz-pak\nso this is the journal so a lot of this\nstuff is not published in the US doesn't\na pineapple a date ruin your stomach\nlike if you eat too much sure you can\nruin it but I'm going to read you guys\n[Music]\nso\nthere are no reports and literature\npertaining to CNS actions of an\nanonymous cosmoses fruit in light of the\nabove the present study was undertaken\nto test the antidepressant potential of\npineapples\nso they juiced pineapples and\nadministered at various concentrations\nrange ranging from 5 to 20%\ntwo mice and then they measure their\ndepressive activity and what they found\nis that the pineapple juice in mice\nreduced depression to the same amount as\nfluoxetine right so it's not like a\nclinical study in human beings do you\ngot to take that with a grain of salt\nwhat they basically the way they test\ndepression and mice is they like\num so this is fascinate this is gonna be\nfun so the antidepressant activity was\nmeasured using the forced swim test tail\nsuspension test and reserving induced\nhypothermia the efficacy of pineapple\njuice was compared with standard\nantidepressant agents viz fluoxetine in\nin VIP Ramin the results showed that\npineapple juice significantly decreased\nin mobility time in both for swim tests\nand TST models it also reversed the\nhypothermia induced by recipe so what\nthey do is they like they like force\nrats device to swim\nand they like depress mice give up and\nthey stop swimming and then like\nundepressed mice will keep fighting\nright and if we think about like this\nperson who's hopeless and can't get out\nof bed like they're not fighting they\nlike give up and they feel hopeless\nanyway so I don't know that so there\nhave been no clinical trials on\npineapple and the effect of depression\nI've used it in my practice the decent\nresults with some people but start by\nchanging your diet so banana pineapple\nstart with those make sure your bowel\nmovements are good go see your primary\ncare physician you can also get a couple\nof things tested like your vitamin D\nlevel so vitamin D has a big correlation\nwith the depression if you're inside all\nthe time and you're not getting if\nyou're not getting your your daily dose\nof sunlight chances are that that's\ncontributing to your low mood\nthe last thing is people are asking\nabout pineapple in in pizza and stuff\nlike eat fresh pineapple not canned\npineapple going buy a pineapple\nand then someone else is asking I hear\npeople talk about things such as LSD and\nshrooms to figure out your emotions what\nare your thoughts on this I think that\nthere are a couple of very promising\nstudies using psychedelics to treat\nthings like PTSD and treatment\nrefractory depression I've had some\npatients who have used it to treat\naddictions and it's gone very well at\nthe same time I think that things are\nvery in a very preliminary stage and\nthere's a huge difference between doing\nclinically assisted like psychedelic\nassisted psychotherapy under the\nguidance of a professional and just\ngetting high so I don't think just\ngetting high actually like helps people\nI think that using psychoactive\nsubstances like antidepressants if used\ncorrectly and under guidance and\nsupervision it looks like have a\npositive impact for mental health\num so I think the big thing is people\nwho like to get higher like oh there's\nstudies to support it so I can get high\nwhenever I want that's not actually how\nit works like I think you need to use\nthem in sort of a targeted fashion so\nthere are some places like rehabs and\nstuff that I've had a couple of\ninteresting conversation with medical\ndirectors from like international\ninstitutions that use things like\nibogaine and stuff like that and I've\nhad like people use ayahuasca and stuff\nlike that like patients of mine who've\nreported good results but a lot of\npeople also just get high with this [ __ ]\nand they don't get better so I think you\nhave to be careful about okay so it is\n8:25 my time and I think we're gonna\nhave to transition to meditation because\nwe've been screaming for two and a half\nhours and I'm getting tired\n[Music]\nso if you guys have follow-up questions\npost them in the discord\nso someone's asking you ask just what\nabout blood tests so I think the three\nthings that tend to be correlated with\ndepression first of all make sure you're\nnot anemic so check your blood levels\nbecause if you're feeling tired gonna\nhave like a physiologic cause for\ndepression would be anemia thyroid\nvitamin D and b12 so any of those\ndeficiencies if you have a thyroid\nproblem you can be depressed that can\ncause depression low b12 is gonna lead\nto low energy vitamin D is associated\nwith depression and then anemia those\nare the four things that when I have a\nperson who clinically comes in those are\nthe things that I test so talk to your\ndoctors about that stuff don't go and\njust get the lab so like go to your\ndoctor and say hey I have depression\nwhat do you think about testing these\nlab values and see what they say\n[Music]"
