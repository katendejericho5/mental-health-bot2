    "transcript": "and now we're gonna do one for anxiety\nso I'm gonna teach you guys a technique\ncalled kapalabhati and kapal Bhati means\nbellows breath I think we've done it on\nstreem before it's really hard to teach\nover the Internet but we're gonna try\nso what Koppel pytheas is a sequence of\nforceful exhalations followed by passive\ninhalation so I'll give you guys an\nexample but just watch me\nyou\nit's kind of hard to see because I'm\nwobbling my desk but like I'm\ncontracting my stomach forcefully so\nwhat I want you guys to do is try to\nhave a sharp exhalation and then sharp\nexhalation again and then sharp\nexhalation again but let's start\nyou\nokay you guys try it so what you're\ngonna what you're going to see is that\nlike you're gonna run out of breath\nafter a few exhalations do the nose\nyou're gonna run out of breath you could\ndo like two or three without running out\nof breath and then you're out of breath\nand then you're gonna notice like a\nrebound you're going to notice like a\nrebound inhalation\nit's hard to describe\nyou guys gotta get not getting it\nconfused\nyou\nso now we're gonna do it together so I\nwant you guys to close your eyes and\nwe're gonna do ten exhalations with sort\nof the the rebound inhalation are you\nbreathing between breaths you are\nthere's a passive inhalation that's hard\nto figure out it's it's kind of like a\nrecoil that's the best way I can\ndescribe it\nright so try to find it so what I want\nyou guys to do is do 10x elations if you\nrun out of breath with the exhalation I\nwant you to inhale\ninhale because you have to to keep\nexhaling you can't exhale ten times in a\nrow without inhaling but let your focus\nbe on the exhalation\nand give yourself like half a second to\ninhale\nokay so\nlet's let's go again let's you so close\nyour eyes and we're going to do ten\nexhalations\nyou\nYzerman\nnow we're gonna do 24 deep breath in\nand begin\nyou\nnow we're going to do 30 breath in\nactual\nself's it with Spacely\nyou\nall righty\nlet yourself slowly come back\nI was just saying that the space after\nthe practice is the whole point\nactually the breaths themselves\nbut after you're done with that last\nbreath of 30\njust sit with the way that you feel\nthere\nthat's the whole point it's actually not\nthe exhalations it's the post practice\nyou\nsorry for being too far away from them\nhow do y'all feel\nyou\nhey good\nyou\nYeah right so relaxed and focused slowed\nin a good way\nin some people\nour ferry experiencing some negative\nthings right some people are feeling\ntightness some people are feeling\nconstriction that's fine to just let\nthat experience happen if you're feeling\nconstriction I want you to take a deep\nbreath and breathe into the area of\nconstriction\nbreathe into your chest\nyou\nand if you even in the back of your neck\nlike as you take a deep breath in notice\nyour vertebra expanding\neach breath your vertebra and the\ninjured spine they grow I literally rise\nin my chair\nyou\nthis exercise can help with it\nabsolutely\nthe first practice that we did was for\nego it's more of a spiritual practice\nless physiology to it the second\npractice is for anger or anxiety or even\ndepression but really anxiety because\nthe anxious mind wants to move fast\nright that's what it does there's a lot\nof energy in the anxious mind an anxious\nbreathing is also fast you guys should\nsee the watch the thing that we did with\nAnna we did a whole thing around anxiety\nin the mind and sort of talked about how\nanxiety exists in the mind and like\nliterally what it is and how to overcome\nit because anxiety is a pattern of the\nmind and understand it in the way that\nJane was talking about like understand\nthings like try to like understand like\nliterally what it is\nand so this is gonna it's gonna start by\nspeed it's gonna meet your mind where it\nis which is very fast and then it's\ngonna kind of slow it down\nso you don't want to force the anxious\nmind to be calm\nyou kind of want to like run with it for\na little bit and then as you start to\nslow down your anxiety is gonna slow\ndown too\nit's like if you have a if you have a\ndog that's like super excited and\nrunning in circles if you start running\nwith the dog the dog is gonna run with\nyou and then if you stop like if you\nstart to slow down then the dog is gonna\nslow down do but if you try to get the\ndog to sit still if it's excited excited\nit's not gonna work so you've got to run\nwith it and then slow yourself down and\nit'll slow down with you\nyou"
