    "transcript": "touch on a couple of things so one is I\ngot a couple of dm's after Devon's last\nstream about IQ and I thought I would\nactually just address them I would kind\nof address them directly so the first is\nsomeone was asking I would like to ask\nabout your claim that gaming selects for\nIQ and the first question is isn't IQ an\nempty statistic meaning that it doesn't\npredict anything in the world and\ndoesn't map anything and certainly\ndoesn't define intelligence so the first\nquestion is like is IQ and empty\nstatistic that doesn't predict anything\nin the world the answer to that is no so\nIQ is a predictor of many things in the\nworld and the next question is doesn't\nin this IQ define intelligence the\nanswer to that question is also no so IQ\ndoes predict to some degree success or\ndoes predict to some degree like\ncorrelates with like real world stuff\nbut I think the real problem with IQ is\nthat we we think about IQ in a vacuum as\nbeing like the most important factor for\nsuccess so IQ is absolutely a real thing\nso for example if you test someone a\ntest someone with Down syndrome and you\ntest their IQ you're gonna end up with a\nnumber and the ability for that person\nwith Down syndrome to become a\nsuccessful attorney or investment banker\nis gonna be very difficult and that's\ngonna correlate with IQ so if you look\nat very difficult professions like let's\nsay you've grabbed a group of investment\nbankers from goldman sachs and you test\ntheir IQ that's gonna correlate to the\nreal world like the their IQ number is\ngonna correlate in some way to like how\nsuccessful they are in life\nI think the biggest challenge is that\nintelligence is not defined by IQ either\nso we now know that intelligence is\ncomplicated and that IQ is actually sort\nof a general first stabbed by humanity\nin psychology to try to gauge what is\nintelligence but one of the areas that I\nwork in a lot is recently people have\nstarted to grow like more and more\ninterested in something called EQ which\nis emotional quotient or emotional\nintelligence and what people are\ndiscovering is that IQ doesn't solve\neverything so just because you have an\nIQ doesn't mean that you're gonna be\nsuccessful in life but there are a lot\nof other things that contribute to\nsuccess in life an EQ is sort of the\nmost recent hot topic which is sort of\nyour emotional intelligence so I for\nexample I have an above-average IQ but I\ndon't think that I'm like a genius my IQ\nis actually not like that far off the\ncharts what I do have is a very high EQ\nand I think that a lot of my success is\nnot because I'm actually like good at\nacquiring knowledge but I'm good at\nunderstanding people so even when I work\nwith my colleagues like the reason that\nI'm successful like in my job is because\npeople like me it's like if you're a\nphysician if you want to like do a good\njob as a physician you need to have like\nlike the nursing staff sort of like like\nyou and support you and you could be as\nbrilliant of a physician as you want to\nbe but like unless the nurses and the\nsupport stuff on the floor like you\nyou're like it's gonna be a really hard\njob that you do so I think that it is\nimportant to remember that IQ is\nabsolutely real and also doesn't tell\nthe whole story\nsecond question is if we grant that IQ\nmeasures intelligence is there any\nevidence that gaming selects for it\nabsolutely so there was a study that was\ndone by that I think I can find it I'll\ntry to find you guys a reference you see\nbuddy\nyou\nokay I'm gonna have to find the\nreference for you guys but um is there a\nbeneath any evidence that gaming selects\nfor IQ absolutely and I think that the\nthe more I've talked to gaming a gamers\nthe more that I realize first of all I\ndo believe that gamers are average\nsmarter than the average population and\nthat's not only my personal belief and\nexperience and there are good reasons\nfor that which I'll explain in a second\nbut that's actually also backed up by\ndata so we know for example like that\nthere's a DoD study that was done in\n2012 or 2015 I'm gonna just have to find\nthe reference but that actually they\ntested soldiers and what they found is\nthat like soldiers who played video\ngames had a fifteen to twenty percent\nhigher fluid IQ than soldiers who did it\nso there's like data to support this and\nI think like this is really important to\nunderstand when you talk to a gamer so\nI'm gonna tell you guys a story so I was\ntalking to a gamer and I asked him you\nknow when was it that you sort of\nstarted playing video games and what was\nit about video games that you loved so\nmuch and what he told me was that he\nremembers like the like in second grade\nwas like when he sort of fell in love\nwith video games and when I asked him\nlike what do you remember about the\nsecond grade he said so I went to school\nand I I was in math class and the\nteacher gave passed out math worksheets\nand I did the math worksheet in about\nten minutes and then I walked up to the\nteacher and I gave her the math\nworksheet and I said okay so can I have\nwhat's next and the teachers response\nwas that's all we're doing for today\nyou'll get the next worksheet the next\nday and so he went he looked like went\nand sat at his desk and like got bored\nfor the next 45 minutes of the class and\nthen what happened is he would go home\nand then he would play a video game and\nwhen he beat level one he didn't have to\nwait till tomorrow to play level two\nlike level two is waiting for him so if\nyou have a smart kid what are they going\nto gravitate towards are they gonna\ngravitate towards a school system that\nmoves at the pace of the slowest child\nor if you give a smart kid something\nthat is paced perfectly towards you that\nif you fail at level one you get to redo\nlevel one and if you beat level one\nlevel two is there and if you beat level\ntwo level three is there like which one\nare you gonna find intellectually more\nengaging like you're absolutely going to\nfind video\ngames more engaging and the far the more\nyou outpaced school the more attracted\nto videogames you're gonna be because if\nschool is perfectly paced to you let's\nsay that you're actually kind of like\nslow like I don't mean that to be\nderogatory but let's say it takes you\nlike 50 minutes to do the math worksheet\nthen school is gonna kind of be paced -\nand video games don't offer you anything\noutside of school because you're being\nintellectually challenged in kids when\nthey're growing up they crave\nintellectual challenge that's like\nthere's a lot of there are a lot of\nstudies about this as well that like\nchildren who are growing up crave\nchallenge and want to learn how to do\nthings and want to master things there's\nthis study there's this field of\npsychology that's sort of dubbed intent\nto mastery where people basically\nfigured out that like one of the most\nfundamental human drives is to get\nbetter at stuff and when you give a\nchild like an option like school which\ndoesn't really challenge them\nindividually and you give them an option\nlike a video game which is perfectly\nchallenging them and even after you beat\nthe game you can open up another game\nand like start playing that and you're\nchallenged again so the smarter kids are\ngonna gravitate towards games because\ngames give you that sense of challenge\nand they also like give you things to\nthink about they give you systems to\nmaster and so if you're hungry for that\nkind of stuff if you're smart in the\nreal world like if you work it like\nlet's say you know flipping burgers or\nlike serving coffee at like Starbucks\nlike that's gonna be only so\nintellectually challenging and so that's\ngonna be sufficient for some people but\nif it's intellectually unsatisfying and\nthen you have the option to play a video\ngame you're gonna gravitate towards that\nso I absolutely do believe that like IQ\nmeasures some degree of intelligence and\nthat there's evidence that gaming\nselects for people who have high IQ\n[Music]\nand so then this goes on to the next\nquestion about IQ isn't IQ sort of like\nthe DSM where researchers wanted to\nfigure out whether they were testing the\nsame thing so devise this test that\nmeans smart but doesn't encapsulate the\nwhole complexity of the mind absolutely\nthat's exactly what they were doing so\nresearchers started to made some basic\nobservations that if you look in the\nworld\nsome people seem to be generally\nspeaking like more capable than other\npeople\nthat some people like someone who has\nlike Down syndrome for example or that\nlike someone is just you know they\nreally struggle in school like they have\ntrouble like problem solving they have\ntrouble holding jobs and that there are\nsome people who are who can be\nsuccessful like in generally speaking or\nlike just more successful so researchers\nlooked at the difference that there's\nlike a variance and intelligence within\nthe human population and they started\nout by saying okay how can we start to\nlike systematically and scientifically\nunderstand that and they developed IQ in\nthe second part of the question is what\ndoesn't encapsulate the whole complexity\nof the mind and the answer to that is\nabsolutely yes\nIQ does not incapsulate the whole like\ncomplexity of the mind and and so that's\nbut we got to start somewhere right so\nif we want to study something like we\nhave to start with the most basic\nobservation we can make and over time\nwe're going to improve and refine our\nunderstanding of this concept so we\nstarted with IQ and now we're moving on\nto EQ and I think that if you look at\nstudies of Ayurveda which is like mental\nhealth like a traditional Indian\nmedicine Ayurvedic goes as far as to say\nthat there are different kinds of\ncognitive fingerprints and there are\ndifferent qualities of memory that it's\nnot just good memory or bad memory but\nsome kinds of minds learn things very\nquickly but also forget things very\nquickly and other kinds of minds are\nslow to learn but also slow to forget\nand so I think there's there's an\nimmense amount of complexity in\nunderstanding intelligence but I think\nIQ is a great place to start and is also\nincomplete\nfurthermore viewing intelligence is this\ninstrument that people have different\nefficiency rating is based on a specific\nperspective intelligence ignoring all of\nthe relevant social economic or\neducational factors that contribute to\nit yes so if you look at so IQ I think\nis to a certain degree somewhat\nindependent of social economic and\neducational factors because I think\ngenerally speaking the way that we\ndefine IQ is sort of like raw\nintellectual capability but if we look\nat and some of that may be influenced by\nlike social and economic factors or\neconomical factors but what we do know\nis that like those factors correlate\nwith like worldly success in a way that\nis you know more important than IQ so\nyou can be like I think that I've met\npoor people who have very high IQs and\nI've met rich people who have very high\nIQs I've met different people of\ndifferent ethnicities who have you know\nvery high IQs and very low IQs and when\nyou look at like worldly success I think\nsocial economic and educational factors\ncorrelate with worldly success in a way\nthat far outweighs IQ so the reason that\nyou have so many Indian doctors in the\nUnited States so like I'm Indian or\nSouth Asian or East Asian so like I\nremember when I went to my like intern\norientation at Mass General Hospital\nit's like a room of a hundred and twenty\nlike basically interns at Harvard\nMedical School in one of the best\nhospitals in the country like a third of\nthem were or probably 40% or maybe even\n50% were either South Asian or East Asia\nso like 20 percent of the room was like\nIndian or Pakistani or Bangladeshi or\nsomething like that and that vastly out\nrepresents like Indians or like South\nAsians or like maybe 1 to 2% of the\npopulation of the United States but you\ngo to like internship orientation at\nMass General Hospital and it's like 20%\nof the population is that because Indian\npeople are smarter no it's because there\nwas like a selection effect where my\nparents are both physicians so like the\npeople who rose to the top of India left\nand came to the United States and then\ntheir kids not only do they have high\nIQs but more importantly like my parents\nwere really really focused on like\ninstilling\nme like a strong work ethic which I\nrebelled against 100% became very lazy\nand played like Dungeons & Dragons and\nvideo games growing up but they tried to\nreally teach me a lot of stuff about the\nimportance of knowledge and I think even\nthough I ignored like 50% or like 90% of\nwhat they said there was so much general\nstuff about like the importance of\nknowledge and work ethic and study that\ngot baked into me even though I was\nrebelling against it so if we look at\nreal world success it has a lot more to\ndo with IQ it has a lot to do with\nsocial stuff it has a lot to do with\neconomic stuff it has a lot to do with\nfamily factors and IQ is still a big\npart of it right because at the end of\nthe day if you have someone who is born\nwith like fetal alcohol syndrome or has\nlike brain damage during duda like\nhypoxia during birth their capacity to\nlike rise to the top of a field is going\nto be like heavily influenced by\nsomething going on in their brain which\nis sort of like IQ so I think IQ is\nimportant and also insufficient and so\nthis goes to kind of the the next two\ncomments so this is kind of this guy\nsharing an opinion dr. whims so he or\nshe I would like to know why why do you\nsubscribe to IQ I thought modern\npsychology sociology and anthropology\nhave moved past IQ i subscribe to IQ\nbecause there's an overwhelming data\nthat suggests that it's like a useful\nmetric and then the second piece is I\nthought modern psychology sociology and\nanthropology move past IQ yeah they have\nand I have to but like let's remember\nthat when by moving past that we've\nrealized that the issues are more\ncomplex and there are more variables at\nplay but IQ is still a useful like\nindicator of stuff\nand then this is the last and I think\nmost important question don't you think\ntelling people they are addicted to\nvideo games because they are smart\nimplanting some dangerous belief about\nthemselves and if they are better than\nothers absolutely and I think it's true\nright so I think that if you want to\novercome gaming addiction you need to\nunderstand what you are and part of\nunderstanding what you are is in\nrecognizing that you're probably smarter\nthan the average person and like this is\nreally important because then the next\nstep that you need to realize because\nour vows I do ver values intelligence is\nthat being smarter than your neighbor\ndoesn't isn't enough it actually doesn't\nmean [ __ ] like just because you're the\nsmartest kid in the room doesn't mean\nyou're gonna be successful but I do\nthink it's very important for gamers to\nunderstand that they for the most part\nthey are very smart and if they can\nfigure out how to apply that\nintelligence in the real world the sky\nis the limit and I think that's really\nimportant is it a dangerous belief\nabsolutely but I also believe it's a\ntrue belief I also believe that a lot of\nwhat holds gamers back is that they\nrecognize that they're smarter than\nother people that gives them an ego\nboost and the ego boost actually keeps\nthem complacent they feel like they're\nbetter than other people so that they\ndon't have to work hard it's kind of\nlike you build this like house of cards\nwhich is your intelligence and you\nbelieve that you're smarter than other\npeople and like the simple matter is you\nprobably are smarter than most other\npeople than the average person and then\nthe problem is like that becomes your\nescape that becomes your justification\nand that becomes your source of\navoidance like since you're smarter like\nwhat happens is the more you believe\nyou're smarter than other people like\nthat boosts your ego and then you can\nlike be content because all of the the\nnegative emotions that you get get\nburied by your ego and get buried by the\nidea that like oh that person may be\nmore successful than I am but like\nthey're not as smart as I am so like\nthat makes me feel okay about myself and\nlike that's the problem so I do believe\nthat recognizing you're intelligent is a\ngamer and more intelligent than the\naverage person is a very important\nrealization and I think it's a dangerous\nbelief and I\nthink that what we have to do is not\navoid dangerous beliefs but like\nrecognize that we have dangerous beliefs\nand then figure out how to overcome them\nlike that's the whole point like we want\nto face the music we want to face the\nproblem and we want to overcome the\nproblem\num so I don't think we should avoid that\ndiscussion about IQ in fact I think it's\nlike really important for like gamers to\nunderstand how they're different so that\nyou can get into the process of like\novercoming you know what your challenges\nare but you have to know what you're\ndealing with like I think it's foolish\nto ignore the hand that you're dealt in\nlife and if you have an ace when it\ncomes to IQ like you should absolutely\nunderstand that because part of your\nroad for it is in recognizing okay like\neven if I'm smarter than the average\npopulation and if I'm stuck in life that\nmust mean that the answer lies somewhere\noutside of IQ and I think that\nrecognition is one of the most important\nthings that a gamer can ever sort of\nrealize\n[Music]\nyeah and so I guess like I see a lot of\npeople sort of posting and chat about\nhow they were like they did\nthey did kind of smarter or they did\nwell in school they were told\nthey were smart and like that's what I\nsee like that's the experience that I\nget with gamers"
