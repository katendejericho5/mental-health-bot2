    "transcript": "and I'll give you guys just one example\nso one of the basic things that you can\ndo is become a reflective listener\ninstead of a problem solver or reassure\nso did you guys notice that Jessica was\ntalking about a lot about problems right\nshe was talking about the problems that\nI'm that she was facing and you guys\nknow what I never told her it's gonna be\nokay I never told her you're gonna be\nfine I never told her I think you're\ngonna be fine I think everything's gonna\nend up okay I never told her you know I\nI believe in you I never said any about\nwhich is weird because usually when\npeople come to us with problems our\nthought is to reassure them like if\nsomeone gets dumped by their girlfriend\nour instinctive answer is hey man there\nare other fish in the sea you'll find\nsomeone else it'll all be okay you'll\nfind love again\nyou know that's actually the wrong thing\nto say the right thing to say is man I'm\nsorry that sucks for you you must be\nfeeling like right now is there\nanything I can do to help so instead of\ntelling them that everything's gonna be\nokay which is reassurance instead of\nproviding reassurance provide reflect\nback what they say and be supportive so\nif they say oh yeah you know she dumped\nme and like I'm afraid that like I'm not\nlike no one else like I'm never gonna be\nable to find a girlfriend again what you\nshould say to them if you want to be\nlike a better listener and support them\nmore is it sounds like you're afraid\nthat you're you're not gonna be able to\nfind someone to love you again and just\nperiod pause and be silent after that\nand then they're gonna respond with\nsomething else and be like yeah man it\nsounds like you're going through really\nover rough time it sounds like you\nreally are not confident in yourself\nperiod you don't tell that everything's\ngonna be okay because that's not the way\nthey feel it's actually incredibly\ninvalidating it's kind of telling them\nhey you're stupid what your your\nfeelings are wrong you are gonna find\nsomeone you're an idiot how could you\nnot find someone like you're such an\namazing person the subtext is you're an\nidiot and it's incredibly invalidating\nso I think the first thing that you can\ndo is instead of providing reassurance\nprovide validation did you guys go back\nand you watch the interview like a lot\nof what I did was actually reflecting\nback what she said like really like look\nat what I said I didn't tell her\nanything was going to be okay I just\nsort of repeated back to her what she\nwas saying and that's what helps people\ncome out of it that's what helps the\nemotions come out\nthen she feels supportive at the end of\nit even though we were talking about\neverything how everything is bad like we\ndidn't talk about there was no like\nsunshine and rainbows in that\nconversation it was bad man but how\ndoes that help her at the end like I\ndon't know but it does so that's\nsomething you can do\nso Siller G sorry Sylar gray asks how\ndoes compassion fatigue affect you it\ndoesn't to be honest so I think what\nfatigues me is being inauthentic like\nwhat's tiring is putting on a\nact so what I love about what I do is it\ndoesn't if at eat like I mean sure I'm\ntired at the end of it because it's like\nyou're kind of emotionally active but it\nsort of feels like working out like at\nthe end of a workout you kind of feel\nphysically exhausted but like\nspiritually powerful and that's so\ncompassion fatigue doesn't affect me\nbecause sure there's like emotions and\nthat can be tiring but I find it like\nspiritually gratifying to like help\nanother human being and it inspires me\nand it gives me energy that's how I can\ndo it for like 10 hours a day what's\nhard to do 10 hours a day is live a life\nthat is like not worth living to live a\nlife of like falseness and to put on a\nmask like that's fatiguing\nwhat's wonderful and this is the big\nproblem with gamers is that they\nactually don't live a life that\nspiritually fulfilling and so they feel\nlike they have low energy they don't get\nthat energy doesn't come from from like\nexpending energy energy come sorry\nenergy comes from like living a life of\npurpose that's what gives you strength\ndoing something that matters like when\nyou're and you think about this I think\nabout the times in your life where\nyou've gone the extra mile and those are\ntimes in your life when like someone\nneeded you right that's when you\nactually like you're able to to\ndouble-down like when your friend is\ngoing through a breakup that's when you\ncan stay up till 4:00 in the morning and\nlike support them in the next day go to\nclass and still do a decent job when you\nlive a life that is like worth living\nand you when you live a life that's\naligned with what you care about and\nwhat you believe the world needs that's\nactually invigorating it gives you a ton\nof energy and if we think about what a\ngamer's deal with like they deal with\nlike a lack of energy like they have\ntrouble getting out of bed they have\ntrouble getting out of the house like\nwhy is that that's because they're not\ntapping into energy they're not tapping\ninto an energy of like doing something\nthat has purpose and meaning and so\ncompassion fatigue sure it sort of\naffects me a little bit but most of the\ntime when I go home I feel tired at the\nend of a day of work but I feel\nfulfilled and then that fulfillment like\ncarries over to my kids and though even\nthough I'm like physically exhausted\nyou know I'm still gonna like attend to\nthem in a way that that it's I mean it's\ncool it's it feels good"
