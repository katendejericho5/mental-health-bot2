    "transcript": "so Siller G sorry Siler gray asks how\ndoes compassion fatigue affect you it\ndoesn't to be honest so I think what\nfatigues me is being inauthentic like\nwhat's tiring is putting on a\nact so what I love about what I do is it\ndoesn't if at eat like I mean sure I'm\ntired at the end of it because it's like\na kind of emotionally active but it sort\nof feels like working out like at the\nend of a workout you kind of feel\nphysically exhausted but like\nspiritually powerful and that's so\ncompassion fatigue doesn't affect me\nbecause sure there's like emotions and\nthat can be tiring but I find it like\nspiritually gratifying to like help\nanother human being and it inspires me\nand it gives me energy that's how I can\ndo it for like 10 hours a day what's\nhard to do 10 hours a day is live a life\nthat is like not worth living to live a\nlife of like falseness and to put on a\nmask like that's fatiguing\nwhat's wonderful and this is the big\nproblem with gamers is that they\nactually don't live a life that\nspiritually fulfilling and so they feel\nlike they have low energy they don't get\nthat energy doesn't come from from like\nexpending energy energy come sorry\nenergy comes from like living a life of\npurpose that's what gives you strength\ndoing something that matters like when\nyou're and you think about this like\nthink about the times in your life where\nyou've gone the extra mile and those are\ntimes in your life when like someone\nneeded you right that's when you\nactually like you're able to to\ndouble-down like when your friend is\ngoing through a breakup that's when you\ncan stay up till 4:00 in the morning and\nlike support them in the next day go to\nclass and still do a decent job when you\nlive a life that is like worth living\nand you when you live a life that's\naligned with what you care about and\nwhat you believe the world needs that's\nactually invigorating it gives you a ton\nof energy and if we think about what a\ngamer's deal with like they deal with\nlike a lack of energy like they have\ntrouble getting out of bed they have\ntrouble getting out of the house like\nwhy is that that's because they're not\ntapping into energy they're not tapping\ninto an energy of like doing something\nthat has purpose and meaning and so\ncompassion fatigue sure it sort of\naffects me a little bit but most of the\ntime when I go home I feel tired at the\nend of a day of work but I feel\nfulfilled and then that fulfillment like\ncarries over to my kids and though even\nthough I'm physically exhausted you know\nI'm still gonna like attend to them in a\nway that that it's I mean it's cool it's\nit feels good\nso your ability to be engaged did you\nhave that before training for instance\nthe body language facial gestures are on\npoint I mean I think you have to\nremember that so elite mcpeet let me ask\nthe question where clearly your ability\nto be engaged did you have that before\ntraining for instance the body language\nfacial gestures are on point so I think\nfirst of all you guys have to remember\nthat you are an amalgamation of your\nentire life right like sometimes\nlike sometimes you feel like something\ncomes from just one part of your life\nbut you have to remember that you're\nkind of a confluence of everything\nthat's happened to you\nso for me I found that like I spent most\nof my life hiding my feelings and when I\nwent to India and spent years sort of\nsudden to become a monk is when I\nstarted to tap into who I was as a\nperson and then when I came back to the\nu.s. if you actually trained to be a\ntherapist\nthey actually trained you to be more of\na blank slate like if you think about\nthe classic therapists like Sigmund\nFreud sat behind his patients they\ncouldn't even see his face and it's to\nbe as neutral as possible because their\nidea was that the more neutral you are\nthe less you inject into the\nrelationship and that the more that the\nperson that you're doing therapy with\ncan like express themselves so by\nremoving yourself from the equation all\nthat's left is a hundred percent of them\nand what I actually found is that the\nmore of a blank slate that I was the\nmore tired I would feel I felt that I\nhad to like restrain who I was as a\nperson and I also like like it didn't\nseem to be helping like I was a shitty\ntherapist for like two years and I\nstarted to become a good therapist when\nI actually threw out the playbook and I\nstarted to listen to myself\nso I became that became something that's\ncalled an active therapist we just that\nI don't listen to my patients problems I\njust don't listen because I find that\n boring I can't do that it's\nexhausting I share my thoughts with them\nand I share them early and I'm wrong a\nlot like you know therapy like so what\nwe do over here is not really therapy\nbut part of the reason that we get to\nfeeling so fast is because I'm not a\nblank slate like I think when I sit\nthere like I used to Train like I've\nused to force myself to be a blank slate\nand six months would go by and like\npeople that I was working with wouldn't\nget better and I was like what am I\ndoing here I'm gonna just try to be me\nand I find that when you're authentic it\nactually like helps other people out you\nfeel better I think like truth is\namazing there's a Sun Squidward and\nSatya and they said like Satya means\ntruth and they say that a lot of\nspiritual energy comes from being\ntruthful and I absolutely believe that I\nthink a lot of the reasons that people\ngamers struggle is because they live a\nlife of lies\njust lying all the time they lie\nto themselves they lie to their parents\nthey lie to their loved ones and lie to\ntheir teachers they lie to their friends\nyou lie lie lie lie lie and they don't\nget anywhere in life you get strength\nfrom truthfulness you speak the truth\nyou call problems what they are you\nbring them into the light and you face\nthem truthfulness is about facing the\nmusic and when you start to live a life\nof truthfulness you think that your\nworld comes crashing down around you but\nthe opposite happens you start building\nit you find energy you find reserves of\nstrength that allow you to change and\ntransform your life like Jessica like\nwhy was what happened with Jessica\npowerful today it's because it wasn't\nlying it was truth she faced the depth\nof her feelings she faced the idea that\nher her father did not treat her like a\nhuman being that you'd think that that\nwould destroy you you'd think that if\nyou face that head-on it's gonna just\n destroy you but the beautiful\nthing the paradoxical thing the amazing\nthing is that it does the exact opposite\nwhen you face your demons somehow you\nfind the strength to like fight them and\novercome the way to overcome your demons\nis by like engaging with them and\nfighting them and even like giving them\na hug from time to time\nand so my facial gestures and body\nlanguage like I agree that they're a big\npart of what I do with people and saw\nI'd encourage you guys to be authentic\nand you have to be authentic with\nyourself and did I have to train yeah so\nI trained one way to like learn Who I am\nand then I trained the other way so I\nthink this is really important to wear\nif you want mastery over something you\ncan't just do one side of it you have to\ndo all sides of\nright like you have to learn like if you\nwant to be a good chef you have to know\nwhen to use salt and when not to use\nsalt so what I learned is when to use a\nfacial expression and when to use body\nlanguage and when not to use a facial\nexpression and body language there's a\nlot that I show and there's a lot that I\ndon't show there's a lot of thoughts\nthat I have which I restrain and so is\nit a product of training yes but I'd say\nmore importantly it's a product of\nthoughtfulness it's a product of\nunderstanding like what's going on\ninside me and figuring out when to when\nto laugh and when to cry and when to be\nneutral when to be silent and when to\nspeak\nin terms of feeling okay with yourself\naren't there times so Fitness Jim says\nin terms of feeling you're okay with\nyourself aren't there times you\nshouldn't feel okay with yourself and\nthat's completely functional is it that\none of the main human drives absolutely\nso I think not feeling okay with\nyourself can also be authentic right so\nlike there are times where you should\ntreat yourself with compassion and there\nare also times where you should sort of\ncall yourself out for being like\nup and case in point that's what I\nlearned with you Fitness Gym because\nthere were some things that I did that\nactually we're not good like I\nappreciate that you've got thick skin\nbut I kind of up in our\nconversation right like there are times\nwhere I sort of felt bad about and I\nthink it's good to feel bad about\nbecause I sort of didn't I didn't give\nyou a fair shake because I had a\n10-minute conversation with you where I\npainted you in a particular light and\neven though that didn't hurt you that\ndoesn't like just because you have thick\nskin doesn't mean that I didn't make a\nmistake\nlike the fact that you were okay with it\nas fine and I'm glad I'm happy for you\nbut I still made the mistake and I need\nto be honest with myself about that that\nif I want to if I I should be careful\nabout the kind of light that I paint\npeople in because if we had stopped at\n15 minutes like Jessica would have felt\nlike like I have to be careful\nabout opening a door and having enough\ntime to close it and tie it up in a\npositive way so I think it is functional\nfor us to feel guilt I don't think we\nshould stop feeling guilt I think guilt\nis a sign when we're off-track that\nthat's what it can mean and so we should\nabsolutely acknowledge and be truthful\nand authentic with ourselves about when\nwe overstep and when we understand\nyeah so so fitness gym kind of goes on\nto elaborate and he says yeah I imagine\nthat's someone who is obese has diabetes\ndoesn't feel okay with themselves in\ntheir body\nabsolutely so I'm not someone who's sort\nof for like full body acceptance you\nknow there's like this movement that you\nshould accept everyone for who they are\nand I think that yeah you should accept\neveryone for who they are as their\nperson but that there are also some\nhealth behaviors that are like not going\nto be good for you and you should work\non changing those so acceptance doesn't\nmean turning a blind eye and this is\nimportant so you guys have to understand\nthis true acceptance doesn't mean\nturning a blind eye towards the bad half\nof you I'm saying the exact opposite but\nthere are some people who feel like oh\nlike you know if someone tells me that\nI'm gonna have heart disease that my\ndoctor is fat shaming me like I think\nthat's a problem because you're you're\nbullshitting yourself to authenticity\nand real sathya is looking at the things\nthat you're doing right and the things\nthat you're doing wrong and if when you\nlook at yourself and you say I'm not\ndoing anything wrong that's up so\npeople say like they come to me because\nI'm knowledgeable and I'm an expert\nright but like I still make mistakes I\nmake huge mistakes I made a huge mistake\nwith Fitness gym last Friday and I can\nbe good at what I do and I can still\n up and I think real office\nauthenticity and being okay with\nyourself being like the best person for\nyourself supporting yourself the best\nmeans calling yourself out on your\n and if you're overweight and\nyou're obese and you have diabetes you\nshouldn't be okay with that because\nthat's not okay\nyou should be authentic with yourself\nand you have to say okay I shouldn't\nbeat myself up it doesn't mean that I'm\na shitty person but this is something\nthat I have to change I think the\nproblem becomes when they're obesity and\nthe judgment that they create for\nthemselves because such a huge part of\nwho they are that they can't like that\nthat that keeps them from working out\nthey feel so ashamed that they can't go\nto the gym and so I think you have to\nwalk a fine line between like accepting\nlike not judging yourself for being\nwhere you are and also accepting that\nit's okay to want to change and that you\nshould change and grow"
