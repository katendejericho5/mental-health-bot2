    "transcript": "we're we're set right we're good yeah\nokay can you just tell me if stream\nlooks okay because I'm not gonna be able\nto see it can you guys hear me okay\nboth so both stream looks good okay\nperfect let's just let's do it\nso Jessica thank you very much for\ncoming on stream I appreciate it\nawesome yeah I'm nervous but glad to be\nhere yeah so tell us a little bit what\ndo you prefer to be called Jessica or\nmadam Faye Jessica's fine\nso Jessica tell me help me understand a\nlittle bit about what sort of motivated\nyou to come on stream and what we're\ngonna be talking about today my husband\nactually watches domination time a lot\nokay and then he found you through him\nand he's like I think you would really\nlike this doctor the way he talks about\nthings seems like you would benefit from\nso I watched a couple videos Mike yeah\nyeah I really like this and the the big\nkicker was the interview that you did\nwas Tom and the exchange that you guys\nhad it wasn't just one person talking\nyou guys both talked about things and I\nreally liked the exchange so after I\nwatched that I sent the email okay well\nthanks for reaching out so what would\nyou like to talk about today I sent an\nemail and I gave a little bit of details\nand I can kind of try to backtrack a bit\nyeah I have I have a lot of self\njudgment that I have struggled with for\na long time and I've been trying to make\nI guess I try to move forward and figure\nout how to quell the judgment and just\nhave a better a better healthy\nself-image\nuh-huh and I'm just I have no idea where\nto start okay beautiful\nso I think I already know what your\nproblem is which is that you're trying\nto quell the self judgment yeah the\nfirst thing to point out is that like so\nsometimes we have thoughts about\nourselves and we're critical and and\nwhat do you do when you have those\ncritical thoughts about yourselves I\nmean it personally it sort of depends on\nthe day sometimes they just keep going\nother times I'm like no you're you're\nbetter than that you're worth more than\nthat yeah that you need to stop doing\nthat and let's go and do something\ndifferent yeah and so if I were to put\nit and we'll go into more details but I\njust kind of want to outline things for\nthe people who are watching so the first\nthing is like you fight against them\nright so it's a battle yes and do you\nknow who wins when you fight against\nyourself probably no one absolutely\nright so that's the first thing to\nunderstand is that like when you fight\nagainst yourself you just can't win\nthere's like there's no winning because\nlike you're gonna lose and you're gonna\nwin like that's just and I think this is\nwhat happens with self judgment is like\nI'm gonna ask you a couple of questions\nokay Jessica so do you feel like every\nday\nso you're you're not fighting against\nlike you're you're in a war against\nyourself yeah is that what it feels like\nyes and it's a kind of a war of\nattrition yeah and there are some days\nthat you win battles but you're not\nmaking progress in the war no it's just\nit never stops\nyeah so I want to just point out to you\nthat like you can't like you can\novercome that judgment temporarily but\nover time like like that takes a lot of\nenergy when you overcome it right yes\nand then eventually like there's gonna\nbe a day I understand do you have kids\nyes yeah so like how many kids you have\nI have two girls and one of them is\nalmost three and the other ones one and\na half yes so like when you have two\nyoung kids at home you're just gonna\nlose battles of discipline and\nmotivation because kids just take an\nunbelievable amount of energy investment\nyou've got nothing left for yourself\nthat's very true and so we've got a\nthink about how can we change the way in\nwhich you talk to yourself that is a why\nwe're calling absolutely we're talking\ntoday why don't we start by telling can\nyou tell me a little bit about how long\nyou've been judging yourself ever since\nI can remember\nokay so what do you remember like when\nyou were let's say like in middle school\num\nmiddle school I wanted to be part of\nlike the popular kids group uh-huh and I\ndid my best to socialize but those\npeople but I could never really find\ncommon ground with them uh-huh and I\nkind of figured that they just didn't\nlike me okay and so did you think this\nis gonna sound so the first thing to\nthink about is that you you tried to be\nsomething so did you try really hard to\nget them to like you at the time I\nprobably thought I tried really hard but\nlooking back I don't think I did I think\nwhen I met rejection I just kind of\nwithdrew from the whole thing okay I\ndidn't really put forth a lot of effort\nafter that uh-huh and and what do you\nthink it was that make you withdrew was\nwrong I'm not sure how to handle\nrejection\nokay.i it makes me have a worst self\njudgment and I just I don't know how to\nreconcile that I don't know how to\naccept rejection okay I'm gonna just\nthink about that for a second okay this\nis gonna sound kind of weird but are you\nsure you don't accept rejection too much\nI guess that's a possibility right so if\nyou're telling me that when when someone\nrejects like let me let me put it to you\nthis way like let's say that I go to a\nused-car salesman and the used-car\nsalesman says hey I'd like you to buy\nthis car and I say no if that person\ndoesn't accept rejection what are they\ngonna do um still fight for you to buy\nthat even though you've said no exactly\nbut what I'm hearing you say is that you\nactually don't do that right when when\nthey turn away what you're actually\nsaying is that when they shut you down\nyou don't try hard enough\nyeah bizarre way it sounds to me like\nyou actually accept rejection way too\neasily I never thought about that but\nyeah how does that feel when I say that\nlike does that resonate is that what\ncould be going on it's a definitely a\nnew idea and yes it does resonate okay\nso now like so this is why people don't\nmove forward because their conception of\nwhat's wrong with them is actually wrong\nbecause good diagnosis precedes good\ntreatment and so here you are saying\nthat you don't accept rejection easily\nenough but I think like the problem here\nis that you accept it too easily and\nthat's what traps you you see that yeah\nand so what we have to teach you how to\ndo is actually do the very thing so if\nyou think that you're running a certain\nplay but you're actually running an\nopposite play if you think you're\nplaying a passing game do you watch\nfootball okay do you understand off\nabout it to follow you okay so like if I\nthink I'm running a passing game but I'm\nactually running a running game and\nthat's not working like what I need to\ndo is like get like improve my passing\ngame but your does that make sense like\nyou're actually you're you think you're\ndoing the thing that you're not doing so\nno wonder it's not working because you\nthink you're doing something entirely\ndifferent Yeah right\nso\nand weird so now we get to a real\nquestion right so which is why do you\naccept rejection so easily so if we talk\nabout confidence now this is making\nsense because the problem here is that\nwhen someone rejects you you take you\nyou value their opinion over what you\nfeel yourself does that make sense yes\nare you getting emotional I get\nemotional when I talk about that stuff\nyes I do what are you feeling\nthat what you're saying is the truth and\nit's hard to accept\nwhat's hard to accept about it that I\ndon't value myself enough absolutely\nright so that's beautiful I mean not\nit's not beautiful that you know\nyourself enough what I think is\nbeautiful it's like I don't have to\nexplain the rest of it to you right so\nhere I in my mind I had started out with\nthis kind of whole map of like getting\nyou to the conclusion that you don't\nvalue yourself and isn't as much as you\nneed to but you figure that power cut\nout all on your own yeah I do that you\ndo what you figure things out on your\nown good yeah makes our life easy makes\nmy life easy I do a lot of self\nintrospection and try to understand why\nI do the things that I do but you know\nif I was thinking that I was doing one\nthing and I'm doing another it makes a\nlot of sense while I could figure this\none out of my own yeah and so I want you\nto be really careful here because when\nyou're not able to figure things out on\nyour own\nyou're probably judging yourself for not\nbeing able to fix yourself yeah right\nall the time and that in turn makes you\nfeel more and more like a piece of [ __ ]\nwhich in turn makes it easier for you to\nbe rejected because deep down you don't\nbelieve that you're worthy of being\naccepted yep now what are we gonna do\nabout that consider this as a new\ninformation and got to put some kind of\naction into play in here about incorrect\nit correct correct we're not gonna wear\naction is not where you're you're going\nwrong Jessica okay right like where\nyou're going wrong is like so you're\nhurt you don't have confidence in\nyourself\nso let me ask you a question so you have\na three-year-old right boy or girl yes\ntwo girls okay so you've got a\nthree-year-old girl when she has a\nproblem with confidence what do you do\ndo you implement an action plan to build\nher confidence well we have really\nhaven't had any issues with that that\nI've seen just okay but I think what I\nwould do would be just to sit down and\ntalk to her about what's going on and\nwhy she feels that way yeah and you know\nwhat that's probably not what you do to\nyourself what I guess is that you tell\nyourself hey I need to be more confident\nand I need to get my [ __ ] [ __ ] in\norder and and I need to stop feeling\nthis way and I need to implement actions\nto change the person that I am how would\nthat work with your kid she wouldn't\nunderstand what I was telling her yes\nand so I think what you need to learn is\nlike how to talk to yourself and instead\nof like being you know instead of being\nso corrective be a little bit\ncompassionate yeah are you nice to\nyourself\nokay so I could ask you why aren't you\nnice to yourself but I don't think\nthat's actually a productive question\nI'm gonna ask you a different question\nand stuff instead when did you learn and\nthis can be hard to answer so we can you\nknow I can ask this a bunch of ways when\ndid you learn that you're not worth\nbeing nice to that is a kind of a long\nstory there we go so let's hear right I\nmight be able to sit so it's not know\ncute a whole hour we don't need to\ncondense and just start okay see it like\nlet me pause for a second so I want to\npoint something out to you so when you\nsay that you want to condense it that's\nthe problem like you're not letting\nyourself like you're saying that my\nstory needs to be condensed you're not\naccepting what the actual like you're\nlike what you need to do in that moment\nis not condense it right you need to you\nneed to accept like who you are fully\nand that the reason you are this way is\nlike long and complicated and that like\ncliff notes is not like there's a part\nof you that says oh I need to do the\nCliff Notes version because everyone\nelse you know I'm not worth their time\nand we have more important things to\ntalk like you see how you're doing that\nit's so [ __ ] it's automatic like oh\nlike the Cliff Notes version because I'm\nnot worth it like I'm not worth the full\nhour I need to condense things so that\nwe can move on to the action plan yes so\nit's so automatic it's like insidious\nbecause it it's you become your default\nprogramming so we're gonna stop right\nthere\nand I want you to notice that when you\nlike try to condense it what you're\nactually doing is like invalidating\nyourself okay\nso let's hear the long version my\nparents got divorced when I was little I\nwould say probably five or six not sure\nabout the timeframe on that but\nmy dad got remarried 98 ish I think I\nwas 10 or 11 and a middle-school\nactually about that time I started\nnoticing some different things when we\nwould visit my dad on the weekend like I\nwould have just gotten out of the shower\nat mom's house getting ready to go to\ndad's house and get the car and he first\nthing he says to me is you you need to\nget the shower soon as we get there my\nhair is still wet why do I need to get\nin the shower we get there we can't sit\non the furniture I have a stepsister who\nlived with them but she can sit on the\nfurniture she can come upstairs out of\nthe designated play room or play area\nthat they had but my brother and I we\nhad to stay down there I would want to\ngo to school dances and junior high we\nweren't I wasn't allowed to do that if I\nstill wanted to go to Dad's house\nbecause it was his time I was interested\nin religion at a very early age and I\ngot interested in more alternative\nreligions and brought that to him the\nbiggest memory about that conversation\nthat I have is you're going to hell\nbecause I'm not interested in the same\nthings that he's interested in it he\nwould call and I actually stopped going\nto his house after a while because there\nwere just so many small little things\nthat ended up just piling up like this\nand I would tell him I'm not I'm not\ncoming I'm not coming to your house so\nhe would call and we would try to have\nthese phone conversations to figure out\nwhy I don't want to go to his house\nanymore\nand they would go nowhere he would say\nthings like well you don't have any\nopinions of your own they're all your\nmother's opinions I'm the adult you're\nthe child you need to do what I say sort\nof thing my mom you know she'd sit there\nwith me well I have these conversations\non the phone with dad she do her best to\njust be there for me and then after\nthese conversations were over she you\nknow I understand what's going on here\nyou you probably should still go to your\ndad's but she would never force me to do\nanything like that because she she could\nsee what was happening my brother still\nwent to my father's house and I'm not\nsure what his time was like when he was\nthere but after a while my mom told me\nthat when he was there the dad would\njust be like well why isn't your sister\ncoming over my brother and I have a\nterrible relationship we are civil to\neach other we show up at family events\nbut we were not close at all there's\nthere's no one to be close either like\nneither one of us really want to go\nfurther and try to mean closer I to this\nday I don't have a want to have a\nrelationship with my father I will\nanswer his phone calls talk about\nwhatever it is he's called to talk about\nI don't do holidays with him and my\ndaughter turned one in June we had a\nsmall birthday at our house I did not\ncall to invite him and I did not feel\nguilty about that it felt like a relief\nI don't have a want to be closer to him\nI have a want to figure out how to just\nbe okay with what happened yeah so damn\nessica thank you so much there's so much\nthere I imagine twitch chat is exploding\nright now but I can't see them so that's\nprobably good so and you shouldn't watch\nthem either\nno watching try I'm not good so Jessica\nmy first question I'm gonna ask kind of\nweird questions okay the first thing\nthat I want to point out is like do you\nfeel so why don't you feel guilty for\ntreating your dad the way that you do\nbecause I did feel guilty about it for a\nlong time because you know he's your dad\nyou should be close to your dad and I I\nthink I did try for a little while to\nfigure out how to make some type of\nrelationship work but it just stressed\nme out it made me feel worse it never\nmade me feel better\nuh-huh so I don't give it that effort\nanymore beautiful so if you want to fit\nI'm sorry did you want to say something\nelse I was gonna say that something that\nhe didn't really talk about is another\nthing that he would say to me my\nstepmother is biracial he would tell me\nthat I don't want to come over because\nI'm racist he would say things like that\nas well\nand I actually tried to have a direct\nconversation with her a little over a\nyear ago uh-huh\nI have the conversation on my phone\nstill and I don't know how to explain it\nother than she still wanted to treat me\nlike I was 12 years old and that\neverything that I did was wrong and she\nhad no fault of her own and anything\nthat happened and I asked my father to\nread that conversation and I asked him\nif we could have a discussion about the\nthings that we talked about and the way\nthat I feel about what happened and he\ntold me that he can't fix what's in the\npast so he doesn't want to talk about it\nthroughout what do you think about that\nthat was kind of a a reinforcement on\nthe fact that I don't need to give it\neffort if I'm not gonna get anything\nfrom it okay so I want to say something\nso I think your road forward actually\ncomes from your current relationship\nwith your dad because in a weird way\nlike even though you're doing things\nlike so just think about this your self\njudgemental self-critical nature tends\nto latch on to all kinds of stuff to\nmake you feel like a piece of [ __ ] and\nwhen it comes to the way that you treat\nyour dad I would think that the self\njudgmental part of you has plenty of\nammo to be self-critical of you with the\nway that you treat your dad now right\nyeah but you but it doesn't now you see\nthat so that's actually true north for\nus that's your solution if you can\nunderstand what has happened in your\nmind to accept your relationship with\nyour dad and not feel guilty about it\nbecause you're not self-critical even\nthough you're on paper doing things that\na lot of people would think would be\nlike not treating your dad well like not\ninviting to his grandkids first birthday\nparty on paper that's something that\nfeels like neglectful and mean but it\nisn't and more importantly you don't\ntrick yourself into thinking it isn't so\nyou actually feel confident and accept\nyourself even though on paper that\nbehavior can be perceived as bad right\nright so like do you see how that's our\nkernel of confidence all we have to do\nis understand like how did you get to\nthat place with your dad and if we can\nunderstand how you got to that place and\nwe can duplicate it then you're gonna be\nfine\ndoes that make sense yeah it does okay\nso now I'm gonna ask you so you said\nearlier that like there were a lot of\nthese things that piled up with your dad\nright you mentioned that like even\nthough you had just showered like he\nwouldn't let you sit on furniture yes he\nwouldn't let you go to school dances he\nthinks you're racist\nso what do you when you say all of that\nstuff piled up what is it there that's\npiling\nit was kind of like little messages that\nyou're you're not worth my love yeah\nso Jessica now I'm going to ask you\nquestion\nwhen you're self-critical too when you\nwhen you beat yourself up is there some\nsentiment that you are not worth your\nown love I don't know how does it feel\nwhen you beat yourself up I don't really\nknow how to answer that okay so let's do\nthis why don't you tell me a little bit\nabout how so this is the barrier right\nlike this is the barrier of our\nunderstanding so we've come this far and\nI think you're doing fantastic by the\nway and I can see that we're bringing up\na lot of very raw feelings for you how\nare you holding up actually let me ask\nyou that first oh I'm okay\nbecause it's not like this hasn't\nhappened before okay I'm trying to\nremain a little bit in control so we can\nstill talk okay I appreciate that and\nalso if you don't want to remain in\ncontrol that's fine too\nokay and you know we can pull the plug\nanytime you want to\nso I okay you know just let me know\nwhere you're you know where your limit\nis okay now let me so tell me a little\nbit about like give me an example of\nlike how you're critical towards\nyourself or something that you judge\nyourself for I'm actually a student at\nschool currently as well okay so did\nthat's insane yeah I do really well at\nschool actually and I'm not surprised\nI'm very important that I do really well\nand if I do the less that well I I could\nbeat myself up about that why is it\nimportant that you do well because when\nI started in school I was actually\nstarted college I was seventeen oh wow\nbut I didn't do well then okay I I\ndidn't go I didn't follow through\nassignments\nI withdrew classes try to get another\nsemester it was just the same cycle over\nand over again so I want to succeed this\ntime okay like I know I can succeed and\nI don't want to go back into that old\npattern okay okay so when I'm not doing\nwell it's like you don't want to you\ndon't want to fall back you've got to\ntake it up got to do better instead of\nme like like a 4.0 in a class is not\nthat important hmm\nit's okay if you get a 90% and not a\nhundred percent like part of me knows\nthis but I don't think I allowed myself\nto do that okay and what happens when\nyou get a let's say a 90 or heaven\nforbid an 88 and all right I try to\nfigure out what I did wrong and what I\ncould have done better and make sure\nthat that doesn't happen on the next\nassignment okay\nthere's not I don't spend a lot of time\nbeing like oh you're steep I don't do\nthat it's just so there's not a lot of\nfocus yeah so this feels this feels like\nit's in a wrong direction actually to me\nokay like the sentiment that I'm getting\nfrom your college experience seems like\nthe emotions that are tied up there have\nto do with your performance when you\nwere 17 like fixing that mistake this\nfeels like it's very different from like\nwhat your dad made you feel like okay it\nalso feels like relatively balanced to\nme like do you think that the way that\nyou beat yourself up over college is\nlike a problem or you think you do a\npretty good job with it\nI don't think it's a problem I just\ncouldn't really think of any examples\nother than that that was the first thing\nokay so I think I think once again it\nsounds to me like you're actually doing\npretty well there yeah like you kind of\nscrewed up like you're sort of proactive\nand you're telling me that you don't\nbeat yourself up when you get an 88\ntherefore it's not what we're looking\nfor okay right like as we're talking\nabout when you beat yourself up so and\nit's okay like so it's it's great that\nyou shared that example so like a lot of\ntimes you know when we're talking about\nthings we sort of like it's gonna take\nus some time to find what we're looking\nfor and it was really bizarre that you\nwent right to it you know the first five\nminutes like that's awesome but we can't\naccept to expect that kind of success\ngoing forward so what's something else\nhave you beat yourself up for\nokay for the longest time I didn't have\nfriends I didn't try to have friends so\nI've made sure to do things like a story\ntime with my kids so they have some sort\nof socialization uh-huh even though that\nwhole thing makes me uncomfortable\nokay and what I when I don't do that\nwith them\nwell they're gonna be just like you and\nyou can't let that happen\nthat sort of thing okay I think now\nwe're getting to it so when you say\nthey're gonna be just like you what does\nthat mean what are you like Jessica I\ndon't know how to talk to you uh-huh\nand\nwhat kind of person doesn't know how to\ntalk to people\nthe first thing I said was not a very\ngood one what do you mean by that\nsomeone that knew how to talk to people\nis a better person someone who knows how\nto socialize people\nand so you're afraid that your kids are\ngoing to end up like what\nisolated not know how to relate to the\nworld okay\nand you feel like you're isolated and\nyou don't know how to relate to the\nworld what's the time yes and what do\nyou think it like so this is gonna sound\nkind of weird but there are all kinds of\nreasons why people will be isolated and\nnot be able to relate to the world why\ndo\nwhat's the reason that you're not able\nto do it probably because I accepted it\ntoo much rejection\njust kind of let that feed the figure\nthat I need it to be isolated this isn't\nokay so I'm gonna stop you you're not\nallowed to use anything that I tell you\nokay like I hate it when people give me\nthe right answer so like this is this is\nthe part of you that's like coming up\nwith the right car like that's a\ncognitive answer I'm asking you like\nlike there's a part of you that feels\nlike you're just not okay with the rest\nof the world right right like tell me\nabout that part don't spoon feed me my\nown [ __ ]\nI mean you're right but let's step away\nfrom that right so like what like why do\nyou feel like let's say one year ago\nlet's actually go back to when you said\nthat you haven't had a whole lot of\nfriends for for awhile let's say like\nfour years ago did you have free would\nokay\nwhy didn't you feel like you had a whole\nlike did you have no friends at one\npoint I've had steadily I've had one\nfriend that we've been close with off\nand on and I guess I could kind of see\npeople that you know they go out with\ntheir friends on the weekend okay I\nnever did that sort of thing uh-huh\nI was I was never really interested and\nthe things that they would do like go to\nbars and whatnot yeah that wasn't my\nthing and I guess I just never found\nsomebody that was interested the same\ntype of things I was haha wait I was\ninterested in at them I never found\nsomebody who I had common ground with\nand I thought that that meant there was\nsomething wrong with me yeah and what\ndid they tell me about that feeling it\nmade me not what to socialize mm-hmm\nbecause if there's something wrong with\nme and then who would want to talk with\nme sort of thing mm-hmm so I\n- notice something that's going on right\nnow right so you're you're using some\namount of cognition to rationalize like\ngood reasons why you weren't able to\nmake friends like you just weren't\ninterested in going out and getting\nhammered you know and most of the people\nwho you were hanging out with we're\ninterested in going out and getting\nhammered that makes perfect sense and\nevery time you say something like that\nit moves away from the feeling that like\nsome part of you felt like you just\nweren't worth getting to know right you\nsee that yeah and and so I can also see\nthat your your facial expression has\nchanged you seem calmer to me now so if\nit makes me call there to try to\nrationalize things absolutely right\nuh-huh so what do you do like tell me\nabout that how like how does\nrationalizing help you stay calm\nmy emotions could be very turbine\nturbulent yep and in the past I've\ngotten so caught up in them that they\nthey have led me to some pretty bad\nplaces yeah like what I had a problem I\nwas diagnosed with bipolar disorder and\nabout that time with my diagnosis I had\na lot of suicidal ideation mm-hmm so I\nguess that's been kind of like a I want\nto say a coping mechanism but I'm not\nsure how to express it beautiful you can\nrationalize thinking yeah yeah try to we\ncall that it yep we call that a defense\nmechanism yeah\nthere you go so but let me ask you\nsomething but I have a couple questions\nfor you Jessica so do you do you feel\nlike the judgment that so the south\njudgmental part of you and I want you to\nkind of envision that like so you're\nlike I think there's a part of you that\nrecognizes that you're an awesome and\nwonderful person that true yes and then\nthere's this other part of you that\nthinks that you're a piece of [ __ ] yes\nso let me ask you something does that\nperson that thinks you're a piece of\n[ __ ] is that rooted in emotion or rooted\nin rationality emotion absolutely all\nright so I want you I want you and other\npeople to kind of understand this that\nlike what happens is that part of your\nmind hijacks your rational thinking it's\nlike there's like a rational part of\nyour mind that knows that you're a good\nperson but when those emotions rise up\nthey like bully your rational mind and\nthey say hey I feel like a piece of [ __ ]\nand I want you to give me a thousand\nreasons why I'm a piece of [ __ ] and then\nyour mind starts thinking those thoughts\ndoes that make sense yes what the root\nis emotion\nand I think this is where like the crazy\nthing here is that Jessica I think you\nwere taught you're not like mentally ill\nyou were taught that you're like look\nthis is important to understand you were\ntaught that you're not worth it\nright do you see that if this is a\nlesson that you learned because when\nwe're kids and we're growing up we learn\nall kinds of things that are not like\ninformation that are not like state\ncapitals and mathematics our parents\ngive us a sense of value in like who we\nare and and right now I imagine that\nyou're an amazing parent yeah yeah right\nyeah and like how long does it take when\nyour three-year-old starts crying how\nlong does it take to calm her down it\ndepends on the situation but not very\nlong usually how long are we talking a\ncouple minutes really a couple minutes I\nwould say like five minutes tops tops\nyeah you calm her down in less than two\nminutes usually yeah yeah like I would\nbe surprised if actually I wouldn't be\nsurprised if half the time you calmed\nher down in less than 60 seconds yeah\nlike 60 seconds of crying is a lot right\nyeah so I think actually I would I would\nbe I wouldn't be surprised if all like\nyou calmed her down in 30 seconds\nyeah and that tells me that you're\nactually doing an amazing job at being a\nmother because kids who get calmed down\nor kids that are secure yeah and so when\nmom tells me everything is gonna be okay\nlike she has faith in you and she\nwouldn't have that faith and you like\nkids don't have faith in in like bad\nparents right like the reason that they\nhave faith in you is because like they\nknow that when you say everything is\nokay actually everything ends ends up\nokay and 99% of the time everything ends\nup okay so she has faith in you and that\nmeans you're doing an awesome job it's\nsomething called secure attachment you\ncan like do a Google Scholar search but\nI would guess that your kid huh my\ndegree that I'm getting is child\ndevelopment Oh perfect so like your kids\nhave I think they have very secure\nattachment yeah and so I think you're an\nawesome person and your give you're\ninstilling them a sense of confidence\nand what they're learning like is that\nthey're a good person that the world\nlike makes sense right\nwhereas what you learn from your dad is\nthat the world is a confusing place and\nthat actually like you don't have a\nvoice and you're not like a good person\nright right that you can take a shower\nand he tells you like you're you're\n[ __ ] not allowed to sit in furniture\nright like if you think about one of the\nthings that makes like you know that\nthat feels to me like he's making you\nfeel subhuman yeah like you know I\nwasn't alive when civil rights was like\na big thing back in the 60s but I can\nimagine that when you're a human being\nand you were told that you're not\nallowed to drink at one water fountain\nyou have to drink it a different water\nfountain like it makes people feel\nsubhuman and when I hear the way that\nyour dad treated you it makes me feel\nlike he treated you in a subhuman way\nand when you beat yourself up I think it\nthere's a part of you that learned that\nyou are subhuman and you can and that\nthat emotion is there and you can argue\nagainst it all you want to but that\nemotion doesn't give a [ __ ] does that\nmake sense because when it starts to\nhijack your rational reasoning like it's\nlike a tidal wave and you can try to put\nup whatever kind of like you can try to\nyou know blow or splash towards the\ntidal wave as much as you want to but\nit's not gonna stop it and it doesn't\n[ __ ] work right right so now the\nquestion becomes how how do you fix this\nwhat do you think I have no idea\nhow do you help your child feel like a\nhuman being I talk to her like she\nmatters yeah do you talk to yourself\nlike you matter bad as off as I should\nwell there you go\ndo you talk to yourself like you matter\nwhen it comes to school yes there we go\nright remember when I said like the\nschool is not that's not the right\nexaminer because I think that's a good\nexample of what you're doing right when\nyou're when you feel guilty for not\ninviting your dad to your daughter's\nfirst birthday party how do you talk to\nyourself\nit didn't feel guilty for that Yeah\nright and this is the key thing I think\nyou did feel guilty and I think you\ntalked to yourself like you mattered and\nwhat you actually told yourself was that\nhey on paper I know that I should I\nshould invite him but like he's an\n[ __ ] and I don't want him to be a\npart of my daughter's life and like you\ntalked to yourself like you matter right\nlike in that moment you matter to\nyourself in your opinion matters and\nwhat you believe matters and the love\nthat you have for your child matters\nmore than his feelings in a weird way\nlike in the same way that it's\ninstinctive for you to beat yourself up\nit's actually instinctive sometimes for\nyou to treat yourself like you matter\nlike when you get into a fight with you\nwith your husband and I'm assuming\nyou're married to man but when you get\ninto a fight with your husband and like\nhe's in the wrong how do you talk to\nyourself we don't have any arguments\nokay I'm trying to think of it example\nyeah so actually you don't have to\nbecause I think that's telling right so\nthere's it like there's a chance that\nthe reason that you guys don't have\narguments is because you know like it's\na very like pat like you're not willing\nto argue with him or he's not willing to\nargue with you like maybe one of you\nguys has like there's a big power\ndynamic and you guys don't want to pick\na fight but I guess the reason that you\ndon't have arguments with him is because\nyou actually advocate and when you talk\nto him you treat yourself like you\nmatter and you make sure that he\nunderstands that yes and like that's\nthat's your answer you're already doing\nit in some dimensions of your life but\nthere's a part of you that that you\ndon't you don't treat yourself like that\nright like so when it comes here when it\ncomes to your kids when it comes to\nschool when it comes to your current\nrelationship with your dad and it comes\nto your relationship with your husband\nyou treat yourself like you matter with\nother things other feelings that you\nhave where you feel like you're a piece\nof [ __ ] and what you do is you try to\nbully that part right you fight against\nit you say oh you shouldn't feel that\nway but my guess is that when your\ndaughter is not feeling well you never\ntell her you shouldn't feel that way no\nright what do you tell her try to talk\nabout the situation like said it's it's\ngonna be okay yeah but when yourself\nwouldn't not now here's the here's the\npunchline Jessica when you're\nself-critical towards yourself do you\never tell yourself does the thought it's\ngoing to be okay ever enter your mind\nyeah absolutely\nright what enters your mind is a [ __ ]\naction plan\nyou're not okay but if you were to do\nthese things you'll be okay in the\nfuture that's not what you tell your\ndaughter you don't tell her you have to\ndo X Y & Z and then things will be okay\nyou tell her have faith in yourself\nthings are gonna be okay no matter what\nwe'll figure this out I'm here with you\nthat's what you tell her but that's not\nwhat you tell yourself and if you can\nlearn how to tell yourself that then\nyou're gonna be fine\ngood side\nhow you feeling right now that are glad\nI prepared my desk with tissues yeah\nI'm feeling like we're getting somewhere\nyeah you look a little bit lighter yeah\nso weird how that feels right that's\ngood though\nyeah it's very good means we're getting\nsomewhere\nyeah you have any thoughts or questions\nat this point I had a thought\nyeah it'll share it I thought about\nmaking a sari for my desk but you know\nit's gonna be okay just kind of putting\nit up there what do you think about that\nwhat do you think about it sounds like a\ngood idea to me okay that right I think\nthe one thing I would caution you about\nis watch out for the judgment even with\nthat\nso a weird way what I what I can foresee\nhappening is that you look up at the\nsign and you say oh I used to believe\nthat but now I don't anymore\nand you can judge yourself for like does\nthat make sense yes you can even judge\nyourself for like not believing the sign\nand you're like you can even tell\nyourself oh I used to be on the right\npath but [ __ ] look at where I got myself\nnow so watch out for that okay so I\nthink that that sign can be wonderful\nand inspiring and at the same time you\nshould maybe tack a smaller sign which\nis that if that's not how I'm feeling\nright now that's okay too I like that\nyou get the beat yeah it makes me think\nof my husband when we were dating he\nmade a side that's actually hanging up\nat her house it was a the played' you\nknow get married have kids graduate get\njobs happily ever [ __ ] after is what\nit says on the bottom of it [ __ ] it\nmakes me think about yeah absolutely\nbecause it's that last part right it's\nnot the plan\nit's the whatever yeah so whatever at\nthe bottom and that's what you need to\nlearn how to do for yourself yeah\nconcretely I think if you're not seeing\na therapist you should really think\nabout it I do okay day perfect yeah yeah\nwell I mean I'm gonna say that maybe we\nshould go ahead and and stop cuz I think\nthis is a great place to stop how do you\nfeel I agree okay well thanks for coming\non Jessica I'm gonna thank you very much\nand strong work today"
