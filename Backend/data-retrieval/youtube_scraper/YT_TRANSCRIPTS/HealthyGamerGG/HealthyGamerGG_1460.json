    "transcript": "so let's just kind of think a little bit\nabout so I'm gonna ask one or two out of\nthe other questions or read out a couple\nof questions so is refocusing an\naddiction onto your work a word of the\ngoal here what happens when your work no\nlonger fulfills him or he becomes\naddicted to work\nand then we'll get to psychology in FPS\nand RTS too so the first thing is let's\njust think a little bit about kind of\nlike addictive personalities so a lot of\npeople that I work with say that they\nhave an addictive personality and if you\nthink about it you know they'll say like\nokay I used to be addicted to like video\ngames and now I'm addicted to like sex\nor I mean that's not gonna happen\nbut you know they'll say that are\naddicted to you know alcohol now they\nsort of trade one addiction for another\nand so like some people and so they kind\nof say that\nyou know we have I'm I have an addictive\npersonality and so I think that like\nsome of the addictive personality has\ntruth to it there's some neuroscience\nevidence evidence that there is\nsomething like an addictive personality\nbut most of the time I think the reason\npeople trade one addiction for another\nis because they're not dealing with the\nunderlying cause of addiction so there's\na great concept from Buddhist philosophy\ncalled the realm of hungry ghosts and in\nlike would this like mythology or\ncosmology or whatever you want to call\nit they have heaven they have earth and\nthey have hell in between earth and hell\nthere's this thing called the realm of\nhungry ghosts in the realm of hungry\nghosts is like full of these souls that\nare always hungry and like never feel\nfull so no matter how much they like eat\nthey can eat and they can eat and they\ncan eat they just never feel satisfied\nand when I think of an addiction I think\nabout the realm of hungry ghosts so\npeople who are addicted are usually like\nlooking for something right so I think\nwhat Henri is looking for is like human\nconnection I think he's looking for\naccomplishment I think he's looking for\nlike some sense of thrill like he wants\nto be someone I can only imagine you\nknow I mean I had periods of my life\nwhere I was in no one and what I wanted\nmore than anything else I tried to climb\nto the top of the Warcraft three ladder\nbecause like that felt like being\nsomewhere and so we have these these\nbasic parts of us that if we try to\nfulfill them with one thing or another\nthing it's like not gonna work the only\nway to fill some holes is like with the\nthing that that you know the hole fits\nand so if what you need is like\nauthentic human connection so I I deal\nwith this a lot in terms of like sex\naddiction so people who have you know\nbad sex addictions what they're really\nlooking for is like connection with\nanother human being and they feel that\nway and the way that other humans like\nrespond to them after they have sex is\nlike very warm and loving and they\ncuddle and they cook on breakfast the\nnext morning and what they really want\ndoes that day in and day out but the\nonly way that they know how to get that\nis by like having sex\nso sex-addiction its core if we look at\nbehavioral addictions there's like a\nhungry ghost in there right there's like\nsome there's a part of them that feels\nunfulfilled and wants to feel like loved\nand valued is a person in the only way\nthat they know how to get that is\nthrough sex and so they can change that\nthey can change the sex for something\nelse but until they feel like they're\nlike loved until they feel good about\nthemselves until they feel valued like\non it on a stable basis and chances are\nthat some evidence suggests that you\nneed to kind of feel that way for about\ntwo years that 50 percent of this stuff\ncan just go away and be cured and that's\nkind of a slightly different I'm drawing\non some science from kind of another\ndisease or not disease but a disorder\ncalled borderline personality disorder I\ndon't know if you guys are familiar with\nthat or not but yeah two years so people\nwith borderline personality disorder who\nalso oftentimes have addictive behaviors\nand also oftentimes have like high-risk\nsexual behaviors their basic problem is\nthat their sense of self is like not\nwell-formed so what's on the inside is\nlike empty so what happens is like\nnature abhors a vacuum and so they fill\nthemselves up with the way that other\npeople treat them and that causes them\nto engage in a lot of like high-risk\nbehavior because the way they feel on\nthe inside depends on how other people\ntreat them yeah so I recently discovered\nthat like BPD is way more common maybe\nwe can just talk entirely about be\nand so I think it's it's sort of like\nthis Hungry Ghost thing where in order\nfor someone to be cured of BPD which is\npossible and people don't really realize\nthat if you can be in a stable\nrelationship where someone can put up\nwith your ops and downs like put up with\nkind of your fear of abandonment for two\nyears and not abandon you 50% of people\nget better and that they sort of get\ncured is then they sort of start to\nrealize oh I actually like am kind of a\nstable person I have value I've been\nable to see this and it's been\nreinforced enough times in a particular\nway that sort of makes them feel like\ncalm cells\nso kind of going back to the addictive\npersonality I think that you know you\ncan trade one addiction for another\nuhh\nso BPD and abusive behavior so we can\ntalk about BPD if you guys want to but\nlet me just finish up with addictive\npersonality then we can kind of dive\nback into BPD so\nI think that you can trade one addiction\nfor another and you can also throw\nyourself into work tom am I supposed to\nbe doing something about that game just\nchatting I don't know you can throw\nyourself into your work but I think at\nthe end of the day\nyou know until you satisfy like whatever\nis missing inside you like that thing is\nalways going to be there and you'll\nalways look for some other way to\nsatisfy it\nand we're gamers I think a lot of\ngetting away from video games which is\nkind of what I was trying to push Henry\non is that if we think about it like you\nknow when he quit Clash of Kings like he\nfelt alone he felt depressed he felt\nlike he didn't have friends anymore and\nso you're not going to be able to quit\nthe game if your primary community is\nthe game\nI see okay thanks so I do think you can\nsort of throw yourself into your work\nand that can be bad or I think it's less\nbad because on the one hand you know\nyou're at least you're doing something\nproductive but I still think it's a\nproblem because at the end of the day\nyou're still not targeting like the real\nthing so whether you're addicted to\ngames or work I guess it's better to be\naddicted to games because at least\nyou're gonna be making money so the\nspending money but at the end of the day\nI think true piece comes from sort of\nresolving the\nthe resolving sort of a core conflict"
