    "transcript": "I think one concept since we have new\npeople so I'm gonna start talking a\nlittle bit about the ego so feral cat\nwas talking a lot about this and I think\nit was sort of tricky because gamers\nhave a really tricky relationship with\nego so I'd like to explain a little bit\nabout\nOh sort of my understanding of ego and\nI'm gonna use some Sun script phrases so\napologies if this gets a little bit hard\nto access\nso in sanskrit the ego is something\ncalled the Omkar so a hum car is really\nmore closely translated as the\neye-feeling\nso it's sort of when I think about Who I\nam I think of the that's a hum gar so I\ncan describe myself as a man I can\ndescribe myself as Indian I can describe\nmyself is is a physician I can describe\nmyself as faculty at Harvard Medical\nSchool I can describe myself as a\nhusband as a parent so those are all\nthings that are my ahum card that's not\nreally who I know it's not the true self\nit's actually the false self so when I\nbut the the problem is that we tend to\nthink that this is who we are so we I\nthink about a hum car is anything that\nyou can put on a resume right I can read\na resume that tells me like kind of who\nyou like they tells me about you but the\nresume doesn't actually tell me who you\nare and so a hunk are we it's tricky\nbecause when we think about things like\nso feral cat was talking about how for a\nwhile she was very concerned about you\nknow the the streamer count I started\nthe viewer count on her stream so when\nshe started streaming she just streamed\nfor fun but at some point her identity\nher ego got caught up in who she is like\nsorry who's on the viewer account so\nlike her value as a human being started\nto get tied into how many subs she has\nhow many viewers she has so that's all\nego so the tricky thing is that a lot of\ngamers have trouble with ego because the\nego of the Omkar arises as a protective\nmechanism so I'm gonna give you guys an\nexample so let's say that I'm let's say\nthat like my first job like I was\nserving ice cream and so I worked at\nlike an ice cream shop and there was a\nthat let's say that there's a there's a\ncute girl who's like I'm 16 years old\nyou know I'm working at the ice cream\nshop I have a co-worker who's 16 and\nshe's cute too and I get up the courage\nto ask her out and she says No\nand then a weird thought goes through my\nhead I'm like talking to my friends\nabout it afterward and I'm like oh yeah\nlike you know I really wasn't that into\nher anyway like she's not even that\nattractive you know I just thought you\nknow it's like it's really like I'm\nreally not that into her does that make\nsense to you guys is that like can you\nguys see how someone would think that\nbut the funny thing is that that's like\ncompletely false right like if I wasn't\ninto her and I didn't find her\nattractive I wouldn't have asked her out\nin the first place so like what's going\non in your mind there what's going on is\nthe hum car is activating so let's think\nthrough what's actually going on in that\nperson's head so when I ask someone out\nand they say no I feel some kind of\nnegative emotion right I feel shame I\nfeel like oh man like I feel shame and\nlike I start to have these really really\nscary thoughts and the scary thoughts\nthat I have like I don't really\nconsciously think these but they're like\nreally buried beneath the surface I I\nstart to think like is anyone ever gonna\nsay yes cuz like you're 16 and you don't\nhave confidence and you start to feel\nshame and stuff like that but you bury\nit real deep you express a little bit of\nfrustration you're like aw man like\nthat's that's annoying\nand then what happens is the hum car\nsteps in because I want you guys to\nunderstand your ego is actually a\nprotective mechanism it's like the\nbouncer for your mind and anytime you\nfeel negative emotion the ego is gonna\nstep in and it's gonna try to protect\nyou\nso my ego steps in that says hey man\nlike you didn't really like her that\nmuch did you like she's not even that\nattractive like you nothing to worry\nabout you don't have to feel shame you\ndon't have to feel any of those negative\nthings because you're not really that\ninto her so then what happens is like\nyour ego activates so ego is a very\nprotective mechanism and then the other\nthing that the ego does is it starts to\nlike it builds up your identity right it\nbuilds up all these false things about\nyou it's like oh man you're awesome like\nyour friends really like you\nyeah so nice guys is a classic that's\nbeautiful so nice guys is all a hunk are\nright these people have this image of\nthemselves and the image of themself is\nlike like has this sort of positive\nshell for like a lot of negativity\nunderneath which is exactly how the\nOmkar works because the hum car doesn't\nneed to be around unless you're\nexperiencing negative emotion so yeah if\nyou guys want to talk about nice guys we\ncan do that and but anyway yeah\n[Music]\nhmm the masks we wear is that a man to\nbe accepted in certain situations is\nthat a manifestation of ego I'd say yes\nso I'd say so let's remember that\nacceptance let's just think about that\nquestion so what he's asking is\nacceptance is valuing another person's\nopinion so if you were bending yourself\nover backwards for another person's\nopinion chances are your ego is involved\nanother thing that we talked a lot about\nwith feral cat was like this sense of\nauthenticity she was stumbling through\nthis phase where she started streaming\nand did it because she thought it was\nfun and then what happened is like\nsomething magical happened in her head\nand what happened in her head is she\nstarted like not having fun streaming\nbut felt like tied to doing it like when\nI was listening to her it almost sounded\nlike she was like chained to a ball and\nlike the ball was like someone tossed\nthe ball in the water and she's like\nstruggling to swim and she started\ngetting like caught up in like\nviewership and partnerships and subs and\nall that good stuff\nand so she started putting on a mask for\nother people like for their approval and\nthat's absolutely what the ego is\nbecause then her identity becomes as a\nsuccessful or unsuccessful streamer\nright that's how she and then her value\nof herself as a human being is\ndetermined by the number of viewers she\nhas so that's that's exactly how ego\nworks and so the tricky thing is that\nlike how do you get around that you\nstart just like living for the sake of\nlike doing what you're doing right you\ndon't worry about what other people are\nthinking that's difficult but you start\nsort of living in kind of like living in\nthe moment because the other thing about\nthe ego in opinions is they're all sort\nof future oriented so if you think about\nlike you're trying to win someone over\nyou're not trying to win them over in\nthe present you're trying to win them\nover in the future like if I go to a\nparty and I put on a mask like why am i\nputting on the mask it's because I want\nto be invited to the next one\nso the tricky thing is that as long as\nyou're thinking about the future you're\ngonna be like wrapped up in all this\ncrap one really simple way to move away\nfrom ego is to like live in the present\nso if I think about my resume like my\nresume is like all about the past and I\nthink about expectations in the future\nbut if I want to step away from ego like\nlook at a sunset right like watch a\nsunset or actually this is a really good\none you guys want an interesting\nmeditative exercise ask yourself the\nnext time you take a dump ask yourself\nwho's taking the dump\nright like are you a man or a woman like\nare you a student or you do you have a\nnet worth when you're taking a dump like\ndoes any of that even matter nope you're\njust someone taking a dump when I'm\ntaking a dump I'm no different from\nanyone else like it doesn't matter that\nI'm a doctor or not it doesn't matter\nthat I'm a man it doesn't matter that\nI'm a parent I'm just a guy take exactly\nyou're just a human and the truth is\nthat anytime you do something in the\npresent that's all you are when you're\nlooking at a sunset it doesn't matter\nwho's looking at the sunset\nonce again you're not a man or a woman\nyou're just someone who's looking at the\nsunset\nyeah I mean you got to watch out\nconstipation is a dangerous thing you\nguys you know you're joking about that\nbut like you guys ever heard of a manual\ndisimpaction you guys know what that is\nnot funny dude\nseriously like I've worked with people\nwho are suicidal from not being able to\ntake it dumb like it's bad yeah it's\nlike so I was working with this woman\nwho was like 70 something and had like\ncancer like stage four cancer and one\nday I asked her like what's the worst\npart of your life and she's like it's\nthe constipation like she was on pain\nmedications and it's just like it's the\nworst feeling like it's just awful\nbut it looked like we had another\nquestion okay\nit can be right so the question is how\ndo you view it right it so I'd put it\nanother way like so is your job your ego\nfor some people the answer is absolutely\nyes and for some people the answers\nabsolutely no so for some people their\njob is just a job and for some people\nit's their identity so I work with a lot\nof like executives like like CEOs and\nthings like that and for a lot of these\npeople it's like it's really tough like\nI'm working with someone right now who\nrecently kind of got into a problem with\nlike board members and and other people\nin this company so he's out and and this\nis a company that he had been a huge\npart of had built like from tiny to big\nand so like that's who he was because\nlike that's what he did like that his\nhis entire he had sacrificed so much of\nhis life like all of his best years of\nhis life to become this thing in this\ncompany and then someone took it away\nfrom him and when they took it away from\nhim like who is he then he's like he\nfeels like a no one and so we're working\nto start to discover okay like who are\nyou really\nI think the beautiful thing about his\nKarma his Karma is that he's given he's\nbeen given like an amazing opportunity\nto discover who he is because if he had\nnot left that company he would just be a\nbored of that train and would be\nchugging along and then like ten years\nlater he would have a midlife crisis\nand that's what yeah so like all these\ncrises that people experience it's\nbecause you build up this identity of\nwho you are and then if something\nattacks that external thing you as a\nhuman being your identity gets attacked\nbut if all I am is a dude who's taking a\ndump like no one can take that away from\nme well I mean I guess you could be\nconstipated but like I'm watching a\nsunset if I'm just like if I'm existing\nin the moment and I'm just doing what\nI'm doing like even if it's playing a\nvideo game or like eating a piece of\nfood or studying for a test in that\nmoment if all I'm doing is that thing\nand I don't care about Who I am then\nit's not ego so right now I'm streaming\nand so is this a part of my identity\nlike not really I'm just like I just get\nup here and like basically what I do in\nmy life is I talk at people so sometimes\nyou know I'm a therapist and so like\nsomeone comes to my to office and like I\ntalk at them slash to them sometimes I\nrun a workshop or I give lectures and so\nI just like I show up and I just sort of\nsay things now you know is this a part\nof my ego not yet but if I'm not careful\nthe same thing is gonna happen to me\nright so right now I see that I have 45\nviewers if I'm not I'm not you know if\nI'm not careful like that number is\ngonna start meaning something to me\nbecause I'm not any better or worse than\nferal cat or anyone else who streams\nthere are parts of my brain that value\nthat thing because that's the way my\nbrain is wired there are parts of our\nbrain that developed when we're in\npuberty that start to like really care\nabout the opinions of others and the\nreason that happens in puberty so if you\nthink about like why high school is such\na tough time there's a really\nfascinating cognitive thing that happens\nin high school which is that your brain\ndevelops the capacity to understand that\npeople have sustained nuanced opinions\nof yourself so like if you talk to a\nnine year old they have this idea that\nyou know someone likes me or doesn't\nlike me when you're 15 you start to\nrealize that people have sustained\nopinions about you that are like\ncomplicated\nand why does that happen in in high\nschool it's because like when as we\nstart to develop like as we go through\npuberty we prepared a mate and a big\npart of mating is actually like social\ncircuitry and our standing within a\nsociety so those are linked like the\ndevelopmental kind of the development of\nego and that happens when you're a\nteenager and sexual development are\nlinked in those parts of my brain are\nactive too so as is streamers start to\nlike as they start to develop a value of\nthemselves as a human being based on the\namount of like viewers they have that's\nabsolutely ego the other thing though is\nthat there may be strong some streamers\nout there I don't really know who\nunderstand that they have inherent value\nas a person and so they don't need to\nget that value from the external world\nright and if we circle but once once\nagain back to feral cat we were talking\nabout her how her mom her mom cares what\nother people think and a lot of the\ngrief that happens between feral cat and\nher mom is because feral cat is\nconcerned about how I mean sorry feral\ncats mom is concerned about how things\nare going to look right so if there are\npeople who are concerned about how\nthings are gonna look that's all ego so\nyou can stream and you can sort of live\nyour life and you can try to make a good\nproduct I mean I'm sure there's a lot of\nyou know calculation that goes into\nsuccessful stream in terms of like\ntiming and advertising and like widgets\nand things like that but it doesn't have\nto be ego but I would guess for most of\nthe people it is and the main reason for\nthat is because most streamers are young\nright so most people like you know they\nfind themselves like in their 40s or\nthey have a midlife crisis if they\nhaven't found themselves but it takes\ntime to develop confidence in who you\nare as a person and I think that if you\nstart streaming early you really have to\nbe careful about you have to start doing\nadditional things to help yourself\ndevelop a healthy identity for yourself\nthat's sort of separate from your ego if\nyou guys are curious we can talk about\nthat\nOh\nnot really it's a little bit tricky to\nthis experience of ADHD\nrejection manifestation is for\nso I don't know what that is is a\nclinical term but I have a lot of\nexperience with ADHD\nPayne Emily you will perceive negative\nsituation in situation yeah so that I\nunderstand so but yeah so I mean it sort\nof makes sense to me so let's so let's\ntalk a little bit about ADHD in\nrejection sensitivity dysphoria so\nrejection sensitivity dysphoria I mean\nI'm not familiar with it sort of in a\nclinical technical term but it you know\nI understand the psychology behind it\nlike is essentially you know when\nsomeone perceives a lot of negative\nthings and suffers a lot from either\nrejections or perceived rejections so I\nthink this has to do a lot with\nyeah so so I mean it makes a lot of\nsense to me too I wasn't sure if there\nwas like a particular definition of it\nthat I was unfamiliar with so this makes\na lot of sense to me so I think this\ngoes back to some ideas behind like\ncognitive bias and actually senses of\nidentity so when we approach like this\nkind of mental stuff I actually think\nEastern perspectives are better than\nWestern perspectives so sometimes what\nhappens is human beings have this really\ncrazy thing where they're like if they\nbelieve something about themselves they\nhave this kind of cognitive bias to sort\nof like prove it to be true so for\nexample I'll give you guys just an\nexample of someone that I used to work\nwith was afraid that their partner was\ngonna break up with them they were like\nterrified that their partner was gonna\nbreak up with them and so they would\nactually like do things to like push\ntheir partner to break up with them and\nthey would like drive their partner\ncrazy and and it was kind of weird but\nthey'd say like oh absolutely I\nself-fulfilling prophecies they're like\nbit like you know the person would come\nhome and then be like yeah you're gonna\nbreak up with me aren't you and then\nlike if you're the partner in that\nsituation like what are you gonna say\nyou're like no I'm I'm not gonna break\nup with you but then the person is like\nno I like your you're gonna you're gonna\nbreak up with me like I just I know it\nlike I'm gonna do something and like and\nthen the partner gets frustrated and so\nthen this person like then sees the\nfrustration and then they start to think\nit's true they're like oh it's happening\nright now right you're mad at me now and\nnow you're gonna break up with me\nbecause now you're mad and then the the\nthe more like I insist that this person\nis going to break up with me the more\nfrustrated that they get and the more\nthat like I feel like this is actually\nhappening and so it becomes kind of a\nself-fulfilling prophecy\nand so this is a problem because the\nmind has this bias for like the kind of\ninformation that it interprets\nand so when it comes to rejection\nsensitivity this is a problem\nessentially of confidence so there's a\nweird thing that happens to their ahum\ncar where they believe that they are\nlike not like worthwhile human beings\nand so what happens is that there's a\nthere's actually like there's there\nstudies that should sort of show this\nnegative cognitive bias like Studies on\ndepression where if you know if I have a\nlow opinion of myself and then like I\nwalk into let's say I enter a\nconversation where I get 50% compliments\nand 50% insults like what's gonna happen\nis I'm gonna prioritize\nthe insults over the compliments and the\nother crazy thing that happens is if you\nreally have low self-confidence what do\nyou think happens when someone\ncompliments you what do you say in\nresponse\nyou\nabsolutely right\nyou you don't you don't accept it yeah\nso now now just think about that for a\nsecond right like so imagine that you\nhave a brain that is being presented\nwith positive data but then you just\ndiscount the data right like you just\nthrow it out and then what happens isn't\nwhen there's negative data like that\nwe're gonna accept like that's a\nlegitimate that's a legitimate judgment\ndo you think I'm a [ __ ] I can get\nbehind that\nbut if you think I'm a good person no no\nno you're wrong right and so then what\nhappens is it reinforces your settle\nyour lack of confidence because all of\nthe positive information that you're\nreceiving actually gets thrown out the\nwindow\nand then then what happens is like it\nonly reinforces it so then you kind of\nget into this vicious cycle that you\nkind of can't get out of because if\npeople are trying to help you if they're\ntrying to reassure you like let's say\nonce again you know I'm convinced that\nmy partner is gonna break up with me my\npartner can be doing everything that\nthey can to reassure me and it's just\nnot sinking it and so the reason for\nthat is because the lack of self\nconfidence actually comes from somewhere\nelse and so that needs to be addressed\nwith directly and once you start to\naddress it directly then you can start\nto conquer rejection sensitivity\nsyndrome\nbecause rejection sensitivity syndrome\nhas nothing to do with being rejected it\nactually has everything to do with your\nbelief that the only thing that's\nappropriate is rejection you just won't\naccept anything else so you have to\nlearn how to like develop confidence in\nyourself as a person\nand then like move from there so I think\nwe have other questions and comments so\nlet me just think for a second\nanother question yeah what this is\nwhat if you feel like you were very\nconfident you still handle compliments\nyeah then then you're not a confident\nperson right so that meant that's where\nyou feel like you're confident but it's\nlike let's just think about it so sorry\nthe question was you know what if what\nif you're a confident what if you feel\nlike you're a confident person but you\nhandle compliments and insults the same\nway and I'm assuming the same way means\nthat you knock down\ncompliments and you accept insults then\nI'd say that in your core of self you're\nnot confident because if you were truly\nconfident in yourself you could be\nunbiased with the way that you receive\nthings and so you may have an impression\nof being confident or that you may be\nconfident in some areas because\nconfidence is not like a monolith right\nit's not like one quality you can be\nconfident in your appearance versus in\nyour ability to like play dota or\noverwatch or Fortnight versus your\nability to like be financially\nindependent so confidence has a lot of\ndifferent dimensions what I guess is\nthat either you have learned how to act\nconfident in a particular way or that\nyou're confident in a particular\nenvironment but that there's a\nparticular some part of you that doesn't\nfeel confident in who you are and so you\njust have to tunnel down and try to\nfigure out okay what is it that I'm\nconfident in myself about and like why\nis it that I can't accept a compliment\nlike what about that feels wrong to me\nwhen someone you know looks at me and\nsays like oh yeah like you know you're a\nvery attractive person like what why do\nI feel like I'm not attractive you know\nwhy can't I sit with what they're saying\nand just accept it for what it is where\ndid I get the idea that I am NOT the way\nthat this person is thinking I am\nOh God so body dysmorphia for\nbodybuilders is one of the most\ndifficult things to treat in psychiatry\nso I don't know if this really answers\nyour question but so when we talk about\ngenerally speaking like psychiatric\nillness and I even then I mean I don't\nreally like the idea of psychiatric\nillness because it's based on like a\nWestern medical model like by medical I\nmean like physical medicine so\npsychiatry followed along with like\ncancer and disease in other ways but it\nour minds aren't like that you know like\na heart attack is like a very real thing\nwhereas body dysmorphia is like sort of\na it's a description that we have for\nsomeone's mind it's not necessarily like\nan illness we call it an illness because\nit causes people suffering but but\nhere's the the big thing to understand\nabout body dysmorphia and we're trying\nto help people with psychological stuff\nthe first question is whether something\nis ego-syntonic or ego-dystonic and this\nis a different ego from what I was\ntalking about earlier this is like a\nclinical term so ego-syntonic is\nsomething that people like agree with\ninternally and ego-dystonic is something\nthat people like disagree with\ninternally so I'll give you guys an\nexample so a lot of people say that\ntheir OCD because they like to keep\nthings clean that's very ego-syntonic\nlike they want things clean and if you\ntry to tell them to relax they're going\nto fight you against it right versus\nsomething that like true OCD is when\npeople recognize that they should stop\nwashing their hands after they've done\nit for the ninth time in a row with\nblistering hot water and excessive\namounts of bleach but they literally\ncannot stop because they have a\ncompulsion that is so strong like their\nhands are wrapped in bandages and they\ntake off the bandages and they'd like\nmix soap with bleach and they rub them\nbecause they feel unclean that is true\nego that that is oh that is true OCD and\nthat is very ego-dystonic the person is\ndoing it but they know that they don't\nwant to do it and they don't feel good\ndoing it versus someone who's a neat\nfreak is ego-syntonic which means they\ndon't think there's anything wrong with\ntheir with what they're doing they're\nconvinced that what they're doing is the\nright way to do it\nso the tricky thing about body\ndysmorphia\nso there are two kinds of like people\nwho come in with like problems about\ntheir appearance you know some people\nlike recognize that it's a problem and\nthey say like okay you know I know I'm\nnot like I feel unconfident in my\nappearance but like I'm trying to work\non that and I don't want to feel that\nway anymore the problem with the body\nbuilders I've worked with is that they\ndon't start there they don't think they\nhave a problem at all they're just\nconvinced that it's factually true that\ntheir body does not look good enough\nit's not an issue in their psychology\nthey don't want to change they just\nthink it's like I just don't look good\nenough and I need to train harder so\nthat I can look better and despite being\nin the top one percentile of the\npopulation in terms of like body fat or\nlike musculature or how much they can\nbenchpress they're just not unsatisfied\nbecause their beliefs are actually\nreally ego-syntonic they don't see a\nproblem with what what's going on so I\nmean I think I think it's tricky because\nhow do you convince someone so that then\nwe kind of get into denial right so like\nhow do you convince someone that they\nhave a problem that's a whole different\ncan of worms which is tricky\nsure um could you comment on the wordage\nof easy you're currently take talking\nabout confidence and I think part of it\nis the concept of easy in instruction\nand teaching I will often hear how are\nyou not confident in your abilities it's\neasy I really dislike the concept of\neasy so do I so I think that's stupid to\nbe honest so I mean know so I'm\nconfident right like you guys probably\nget that impression but nowhere along\nthe way did I say that this was easy\nlike sure I you know I'm confident in\nmyself and I think you guys can be\nsuccessful if you're struggling but\nnowhere to do I think it's easy I think\ncalling something easy is one of the the\nmost devaluing things that you can do\nbecause let's just think about that for\na second if you say that how are you not\nconfident in your abilities it's easy\nlike if you think about it what you're\ntelling the person is that they're\nincompetent right because you're like\nhow can you not do this it's so [ __ ]\neasy like you're it the easier it is so\nif something is super super easy and\nthey're not doing it that means that\nthey're super super idiotic right so I\nthink that like calling things easy is a\nreally really big mistake I don't think\nthat confidence is easy\nand I think if someone else is calling\nsomething that you're struggling with\neasy they just really don't understand\nor have not faced what you are facing\nthey just really have no idea so one\nexample is that you know so let's say\nthat like you have social anxiety and\nthen like a buddy of yours doesn't and\nthey're like I don't know I don't know\nwhat the problem is why don't you just\ngo to a party and hang out man it's just\neasy just like don't think about it like\njust try to have a good time man like\nthey have no idea what you're what's at\nthey have never experienced in your mind\nwhat what you are experiencing and so it\nyou know if someone says that like you\nknow how are you not confident in your\nabilities it's easy like you have to\npause for a second the first thing is\nthat they probably don't understand what\nyou're actually going through and the\nsecond thing is that you should really\nthink a little bit about you know why\nwhy is it that this person perceives\nsuch respect in my abilities and I do\nnot\nso I think if you want to grow there\nwhat you really have to do is grapple\nwith yourself why is it that everyone\nelse sees me as amazing and I don't like\nwhere does that come from why is it hard\nbecause it is hard because if it was\neasy you'd be doing it like that's\nstupid why is it hard for you to see\nyourself that way\n[Music]\nah no so this is a great question so\nsubtly no so people do all kinds of\ndestructive self-destructive [ __ ]\nwhich is completely ego-syntonic all the\ntime and in fact I'd even say that the\nmore self-destructive it is the more\nlikely it is to be ego-syntonic so if we\nthink about self-destructive behavior\nit's things that you do to yourself I'll\nrepeat the question\nso eager to stock is ego-dystonic like\nself-destructive behavior so what's the\nrelationship between being ego-dystonic\nand and self-destructive so I would\nactually say that most people who do and\nby the way guys I really appreciate your\npatience with like me learning the ropes\nof this stuff I'm new to this and and\nyour feedback and stuff is awesome so\nthank you for you know letting me know\nwhen I'm doing something wrong and\nplease let me know if I need to be doing\nsomething differently but just kind of\ngoing back to ego-dystonic and\nself-destructive behavior so if you\nthink about like really self-destructive\nbehavior most of the stuff that's\nself-destructive people aren't really\naware of right like if you're thinking\nabout self sabotaging relationships or\nlike let's say that you you know you you\nhave a tendency to like date the wrong\nkind of person so there's a lot of stuff\nthat I work with that's really\nself-destructive and what I've actually\nfound is that self-destructive behaviors\nego-syntonic you don't recognize that\nit's self-destructive in fact you think\nwhat you're doing is exactly right even\nthough like your torpedoing some part of\nyour life does that make sense\nyeah so like this is where it's it's not\nit's not ego-dystonic at all like you\nsure you suffer later but the thing\nabout ego-dystonic is that someone\ndoesn't want to be doing what they're\ndoing in the moment exactly so they\ndon't want to be doing what they want to\ndo in the moment and like it's someone\nwith true OCD can't help themselves they\nhave to wash their hands even though\nthey know that they shouldn't and that\nthey don't want to and so when it comes\nto self-destructive behavior a lot of\nthat stuff is like ignoring red flags\nit's like you know and you think that\nyou're doing everything right even\nthough you're doing everything wrong and\nso that kind of self-reflection is\ntricky and difficult\nyeah so locking the door usually\nrepetitive behaviors okay well will do\nlike maybe one or two more questions and\nthen we'll wrap up for the day for or\nwill transition to like doing a little\nbit of meditation and then I have one or\ntwo closing thoughts because we've been\ntalking about a lot about confidence and\nso I want to share just a little bit\nabout how to become confident\nwe have any other questions or should we\ntransition okay\nI think we've gotten to most of\nso I'm just gonna talk to you guys a\nlittle bit so you know we're talking\nabout confidence we're talking about\nit's hard so in my mind like talking\nabout this stuff really is not gonna\nchange y'all's lives right like you're I\nmean so let me just tell you guys so a\nsimple way that I think you should you\ncan develop confidence is so we've\ntalked a lot about ego and go for it\nwe'll block we've talked a lot about ego\nand we've talked a lot about you know\nhow streamers and other people in\ngeneral like how our identity starts to\nbe built up based on how others judge us\nso I think one of the best things you\ncan do for your confidence is to do\nsomething that know to challenge\nyourself in a way that no one can judge\nyou in the simplest way to do that is to\ndo things in nature so what I would\nrecommend that you guys do is like like\ngo like to a national park or something\nand like find a boulder like be safe but\nI remember like there was a time when I\nwas I would just like go out in nature\nand I would just like do stuff like I\nwould look at some point on a hill and I\nwould say to myself I'm gonna get to the\ntop of that hill or I would like look at\na boulder and I'd be like I'm gonna see\nif I can climb that Boulder and\nsometimes I would succeed and sometimes\nI would fail but the cool thing about\nnature is like nature doesn't give a\n[ __ ] like nature doesn't care whether\nyou succeed or fail it doesn't care\nabout living up to expectations or not\nliving up up to expectations and when\nyou succeed the this is a tricky thing\nabout confidence because when you do\nsomething in the real world like what's\njust as damaging or insidious for your\nconfidence is the reward right if I get\nif I become valedictorian of my high\nschool I'm screwed because my ego is\ngonna like take a boost from that right\nso whether you do good things whether\nyou get bullied in high school or you\nget praised for how smart you are both\nof them are gonna screw you over and\nlead to ego and move you away from\nconfidence so the simple solution is to\nspend time with nature because nature\ndoesn't care Nature doesn't care if\nyou're you're fat or skinny it doesn't\ncare if you're strong or you're weak\nit doesn't care if you're smart or\nyou're stupid it doesn't care if you're\na good-looking or bad-looking and so\nyour brain needs time away from all of\nthose thoughts\nso like go and like swim somewhere go\nand climb something for a long time like\na big part of my personal growth was\nlike I would go mountain climbing so I\nspent like you know time in Colorado\nmountain climbing I spent time in like\nclimbed Kilimanjaro and and things like\nthat and it was it was like an awesome\nexperience like go and spend time with\nnature because nature doesn't judge you\nnature just it just doesn't and what you\nreally need to do to develop confidence\nas being a judgment-free zone"
