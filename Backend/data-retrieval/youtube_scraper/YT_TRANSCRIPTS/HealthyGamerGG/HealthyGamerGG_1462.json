    "transcript": "so Farrell was asking about motivation\nso I think Farrell that's a fantastic\nquestion so I'll tell you guys I kind of\nhave to\n- big approaches - like my own personal\nmotivation\nso the first is to remember that if you\nhave an outcome orientation your\nmotivation is towards the outcome it's\ntowards the goal and the problem is that\nif the outcome isn't what you want your\nmotivation is gonna go with it right so\nif like my goal on a test if my goal is\nto get an a on a test and I get an A\nthen I'm okay until the next test but\nthe problem is that if I ever get a B\nlike my motivation it's it's kind of\nlike building a house of cards and I see\nthis a lot actually in in you know when\nI work with medical students is a lot of\nlike medical students have been at the\ntop of their class forever like they\nwere they were like at the top of their\nclass in high school got into good\ncolleges or at the top of their class in\ncollege so they like get into a good med\nschool and I mean we see we work with a\nlot of students but you know I most of\nthem are from Harvard and and so they're\nvery they really struggle when because\nthey've been like at the top of\neverything so they really struggle when\nthey become average and so anytime that\nyou have an outcome oriented motivation\nI feel like it's kind of like riding a\nwave that's gonna crash at some point\nand so what I really try to do is focus\non actions instead of outcomes and just\nkind of stick with the action the other\nhuge thing if we think about the other\nthing that I talk a lot about is is\nDharma and that's a big part of my\nmotivation so Dharma is a Sun script\nword that means duty or responsibility\nand in the Eastern religions they don't\nreally have kind of the standard idea of\nmorality in terms of like good and evil\nthey talk about like living and service\nto your Dharma are not living in service\nto your Dharma and I think a huge\nadvantage of living in service to your\nDharma and I'll explain what this means\nis that it gives you a lot of tolerance\nfor suffering and in failure so I'll\ngive you guys just an example so let's\nsay that I'm walking down the street and\nlike someone points a gun at me\nso when I look at that gun that gun\nrepresents a lot of things like fear\npain death and those are all things that\nI'm gonna want to retreat from right\nlike the gun represents everything that\nI don't like in this world and I'm just\ntrying to run away from it as quickly as\npossible so the gun represents a lot of\nsuffering so\nour instinct as human beings is to move\naway from negative emotions and from\nsuffering and if we think a lot about\nwhat Farrell was talking about you know\nshe was encountering a lot of like\nnegativity at different points in her\nlife and her response was to protect her\nego was to kind of like move away from\nthat prospect of failure and then she\nends up kind of becoming stuck so that's\nsort of that's how human beings respond\nright like if someone points a gun at me\nlike I'm gonna try to run away or get\nout of that situation however I can like\nif the dude wants my wallet I'm gonna\ngive him the wallet I'm gonna hope that\nhe just leaves me alone now the funny\nthing about that is that so that's\ncompletely like understandable so now\nlet's say that I'm walking down the\nstreet with my kid and someone points a\ngun at my kid then what am i doing\nsuddenly I'm stepping into the path of\nthe gun right so the the gun means no\nless death or pain or suffering but my\ncapacity to face that suffering and even\nstep into it like choose that suffering\nis because I'm living in service to my\npenguia so my first duty or my\nresponsibility is to my daughter so\nbecause I'm living in service to that I\ncan actually tolerate immense amounts of\nsuffering and negativity and kind of\ncome out hopefully on the other side and\nif I get shot I get shot but Dharma is\nwhat lets me choose the hard path\nbecause I'm doing it for a reason I'm\ndoing it in service to my Dharma so when\nI talk to to gamers about sort of\nfiguring out what their motivation is\nlike they all talk about like wanting to\nchange but for what like they don't have\na reason they're like yeah I want to you\nknow I want to graduate from college why\nso that I can get a good job why like\nso I can be happy like what is having a\ngood job have it like it's all it's all\nanswers that they kind of it's like\nhypothetical answers right like it's\nlike no one really knows like you can't\nat so they're like okay so I can get\nmarried and have kids one day you don't\nunderstand the value of being like\nmarried to a good person and having kids\nuntil you've actually done it so a big\npart of of what I try to help gamers do\nis like discover their Dharma because\nDharma is what lets you tolerate the\ndifficulty like when I was in residency\nnear you do like 24 like 30 hour call\nshifts like there were two attitudes for\nmy colleagues one is I just have to get\nthrough it right and we heard that from\nFarrell today it was all like I just\nhave to get through this period until I\nget partnership it's like it I just have\nto get through it that's actually not a\nsustainable way to live your life that's\ngonna lead to something called burnout\nright like you're gonna you're gonna dig\ndeep and you're gonna get through it\nyou're gonna get through it you're gonna\nget through it and then you end up burnt\nout like you just don't have any energy\nanymore your gas tank is empty so the\nother thing is that I realized when I\nwas on call like in the ICU that I'm\ngonna be a psychiatrist and you know one\nday like this is honestly the thought\nthat I had I'm gonna be on a plane like\n10 years from now and someone's they're\ngonna like someone's gonna ring the\noverhead speaker and they're gonna say\nis there a doctor on the plane and then\nI'm a psychiatrist but I can't\nsay no and then like I'm gonna I'm gonna\nhit the button right so the the the\nflight attendant is gonna come grab me\nand then I'm gonna go see this dude\nwho's like is maybe having a heart\nattack and then I have to know what to\ndo in that point like in that moment\ndepending on who I've become either I'm\ngonna be able to save that person's life\nor not save that person's life and so\nthat's my daughter my in that moment is\nlike that's gonna be my responsibility\nright I'm the doctor on the plane I\ncan't tell them yeah man I'm sorry I\ncan't tell if you you are having a heart\nattack or not I'm a psychiatrist and I\nmostly talked to people about their\nfeelings like that doesn't work and so\nwhen I'm in the ICU and I'm Ron my call\nshifts I think to myself this is the one\nyear of my life that I'm gonna get to be\nin this ICU and I better learn whatever\nI can because at some point if somebody\nneeds my help like am I gonna be able to\nhelp them or am I not going\nbe able to help them that's my Dharma\nand so if you live your life trying to\nget through it like I just have to make\nit through I just have to make it\nthrough like you're gonna burn out like\nit's just not gonna work right and as\nyou burn out what happens is you have to\nyou're you need some kind of relief it's\nlike this\nDHA RMA you it's just not gonna work and\nthe more burnt out you got the more you\nneed to rely on unhealthy coping\nmechanisms like alcohol or video gaming\nto like help you tolerate because when\nyour soul has been like wrung dry and\nyou're in the depths of your despair\nwhat are you gonna do to make yourself\nfeel good you're gonna like load up\noverwatch or dota or something\nabsolutely so I think it comes with\nwillingly and voluntarily accepting a\nburden but we'll talk about that yeah\nwell we'll get to that so I was gonna\nsay something yeah so so just about\ngaming so what happens is like then our\nbrain so when we feel that sort of like\nspiritual burnout like where you're not\ndoing anything in life our brain seeks\nrefuge wherever it can right you want\nthat little tiny little dopamine surge\njust so you can like make yourself feel\na little bit better and that's how you\nend up gaming and so I think the\nsolution is to find your Dharma because\nyour Dharma is gonna be what lets you\ntolerate tolerate and withstand and even\novercome as opposed to escape from\nsuffering and that's the biggest problem\ngamers have is that they don't willingly\nlike they don't know how to tolerate\nsuffering they don't know how to like\nstep into things that are that are\ndifficult right to like say like okay\nI'm gonna try to study as hard as I can\nfor this test and I have this idea that\nI'm a smart person and if I don't do\nwell on the test that means I'm not a\nsmart person and that means I'm nothing\nso instead what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna make a smurf account and roll all\nover noobs because that makes me feel\ngood about myself\nI can I don't want to play it at the\nlevel that I'm actually at where other\npeople can own me\nI want to I want to like stomp on noobs\nall day so that I can preserve this idea\nthat I'm a good player right that's\nthat's the psychology of the gamer and\nso the solution out of that is to find\nyour autonomy and so now like so so\nspark was asking you know what's what's\nyour Dharma well so I would start with\nthis so take a piece of paper and write\ndown what you think is wrong with the\nworld and then like what happens as most\npeople do this and they're like there's\nso much wrong with the world and then my\nquestion them is okay so like did you do\nit and then no one writes anything that\nare like the problems too big and that's\nwhy you don't find out what your Dharma\nis on one sheet yeah start actually\nwrite it down you'll be amazed you may\nthink that I can't fit all the problems\nall the world's problems on one sheet of\npaper of course you can't you can't fit\nall the world's problems the question is\nwhat's gonna be the first thing that you\nwrite down what's gonna be the second\nwhat's gonna be the third what's gonna\nbe the fourth then you'll begin to\nrealize what's important to you right\nthen you take a look at that piece of\npaper and you you try to figure out okay\nlike what am I gonna do about this but\ncan you do something about it like you\ngot to do something like it if you don't\ndo something about it who's gonna do\nsomething about it like let's talk about\nclimate change like you know we each\nhave to do our own part like what are\nwhat are the things that matter to you\nand so I would say so I think sparked\nwas sparked also asking like how you\nbook a session with me than him\nwhoop okay so I would say just start\nwith one piece of paper and write down\nwhat you think is wrong with the world\nand then ask yourself like what can I do\nabout this and that's I mean I think\nthat's where you got to start I think\nthere are also other things that you can\nthink a little bit about in terms of you\nknow like you can also think a little\nbit about karma so karma is Karma but I\nthink about\nI think about Karma's kind of being sort\nof your circumstances so I think each of\nus is given kind of a unique\ncircumstance in life so I think my\nDharma is heavily based on my Karma so I\nthe crazy thing is that you know I used\nto think that there was growing up I\nused to think that a 4.0 GPA is better\nthan 2.5 and there is no situation in\nwhich I would want a 2.5 GPA instead of\na 4.0 GPA makes sense right like there's\nno advantage to a 2.5 GPA except if\nyou're doing what I'm doing now which is\nto talk to people who have 2.5 GPAs and\nto say hey I know what it's like I've\nactually been there and I came out on\nthe other side like I ended up not\ngetting into medical school for a while\nbut then I like I put my life together\nand and now I'm like relatively happy\nand successful and if I can do it you\ncan do it because the truth is that I'm\nnot amazing I'm actually you know I'm\nabove average but I'm not really like\nthat different from you guys which is\nsomething that I've come to appreciate\nmore and more and that really if I can\ndo it you can do it and so when I look\nat my life I see the garma of a 2.5 GPA\nthat was the circumstance that I was\ngiven and then I had some amount of\ntraining and things like that and then I\nrealized that like gamers need help and\nI'm the guy who's around right so my\ncondolences but if you guys need help\nlike I'm I'm I'm what is like I'm the\ndude who's there so it's my Karma so my\ngod am I like my circumstances my\nplaying a bunch of video games even now\nI play video games\num and it's like it's my circumstance in\nlife to try to help you guys and those\nare my circumstances and so my Dharma\nand my karma related my circumstances in\nlife like if I was born a hundred years\nago helping people with technology\naddiction and like streamers with the\nstress of streaming that Dharma doesn't\nmake any sense back then so there are\nsome challenges that you yourself are\nthe only ones that can can do something\nabout and that's your turn"
