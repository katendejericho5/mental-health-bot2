    "transcript": "so what actually creates behavioral\nchange if we really look at our brain\nour learning circuitry which is kind of\nwe can think about our hippocampus as a\npart of our brain that sort of relates\nto learning circuitry is very closely\nconnected to our emotional circuitry and\nspecifically our negative emotional\ncircuitry and so in order for us to\nchange our behavior the most powerful\nthing that can change behavior is\nactually the experience of negative\nemotion so I'm working with someone\nwho's engaged and it turns out that he\nrecently found out that his wife I mean\nhis fiancee was unfaithful and so like\nthat caused him a lot of emotional hurt\nand also like drastically changed his\nbehavior towards her right if we think\nabout like the way that you treat your\nfiancee you treat them one way which is\nlike a very intensive behavior in a\npositive direction you treat them with\nlove and respect earn and are available\nfor them and then after he discovered\nthat she was unfaithful his behavior\nchanges like 180 degrees it flips\ncompletely and it's the most drastic\nbehavioral change that you can kind of\nthink of so his behavior changes\ndrastically and one way to think about\nthat is like if we think about how he\nhas changed he's learned not to trust\nhis wife so if we think about\nbehavioural change and learning like\nthose two things are very closely tied\nand if we think about what's the most\nrapid way that our behavior changes it's\nactually negative emotions let's say\nthat you go to school one day and you\nget bullied for like wearing a\nparticular shirt that negative emotion\nis gonna hit your brain so hard that you\nwill never wear that shirt at school\nagain it is going to completely alter\nyour behavior very drastically\nand so even if we stop and accept that\nfor a moment if we say that okay fine so\ngetting burned is how we learn things\nand it's the most drastic way to change\nour behavior what does this have to do\nwith gaming so this is where we start to\nlook at something called fMRI studies\nwhich are brain scan studies so fMRI is\na kind of study where we take an MRI\nwhich is like a scan of your brain\ntrem our eye research sort of supports\nthis is that it actually suppresses your\nnegative emotions right if I'm having a\nbad day at work or I just got into a\nfight with like my significant other or\nmy parents are on my case what do you do\nto forget your problems you go to a\nvideo game right because while you're\nplaying a video game you forget what's\ngoing on in life and so if we look at\nfMRI studies what what video games\nactually do is they shut off our\nnegative emotional circuitry but now\nlet's pause and think for a second\nescapism exactly so if I shut off my\nnegative emotional circuitry what\nhappens to my capacity to learn exactly\nit gets stunted right because our\nemotional circuitry our negative\nemotional circuitry exactly you learn\nfrom failure so our negative emotional\ncircuitry is a key way in which we learn\nbecause when we get burned by something\nlike let's just talk about actually\ngetting burned if I touch a hot pan or I\ntouch a hot stove and I get burned\nI'm never gonna touch a hot stove again\nremember that learning circuitry is get\ntied to your negative emotional\ncircuitry so when people suppress the\nparts of their brain that experience\nnegative emotions they don't learn from\ntheir mistakes they don't learn from\ntheir behaviors and they have trouble\ngetting unstuck so another prime example\nand this is something that it shares\nwith alcohol is alcohol right so when I\ndrink and like I get into a fight with\nsomeone or I'm not doing well at work\ninstead of sitting with those feelings\nand letting those feelings motivate me\nto do more and change and learn if I\ndrown my sorrows in alcohol nothing is\ngonna happen because I'm literally\nshutting off that painful which is\nrelief right and so that that creates\nescapism and the problem with escapism\nis that it doesn't help us change and so\nthen gamers end up feeling stuck right\nbecause you guys wake up every day and\nyou know that there are things that you\nneed to be doing differently and you\nknow exactly what it is because y'all's\nfluid IQs are 20% higher than average\nand yet you can't bring yourself to do\nit and you just can't bring yourself to\ndo it and you know and you know and you\nknow and you can't do it and you can't\ndo it and you can't do it and then you\ncome to a conclusion which is that I'm\nlazy normally like negative emotions\ncause us to change in in our life\nbecause we direct those negative\nemotions towards real life what happens\nin gaming is that we start to like a lot\nof like if you think about people who\nrage in video games it's usually like\npeople who are like upset in the rest of\nlife right like if you think about a\nhateful gamer like some guy who just\ngets completely bent out of shape over\nevery little thing and overwatch chances\nare that guy's not happy in the rest of\nhis life\nso gaming has a very interesting impact\non how we experience emotions and one\nthing that it does and I think this has\nto do with gamers kind of getting stuck\nis it suppresses their negative emotions\nand by suppressing our experience of\nnegative emotions it actually disables\nour learning circuitry and by disabling\nour learning circuitry what that manages\nto do is it keeps us feeling stuck\nbecause our learning circuitry is what\nleads to behavioral change\nso you're basically turning off the part\nof your brain that is the most powerful\nthing that can cause you to change your\nbehavior and then the end result is that\nyou end up sort of living a life where\nlike you know what you need to do but\nyou feel incredibly frustrated because\nnothing in your life is changing"
