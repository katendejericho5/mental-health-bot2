    "transcript": "let me just touch on a couple of things\nthat that twitchchat talks about so\nfirst of all you know I think that there\nis a correlation between men and\nalexithymia although many women are\nAlexa thymic - I think a lot of it has\nto do with video gaming I think that men\nare conditioned to experience\nessentially one emotion we're really\nonly allowed to experience one emotion\nand if we experience any other negative\nemotions or one negative emotion if we\nexperience other negative emotions we\ntend to be shamed for it and I'll let\nyou guys kind of figure out what emotion\nit is that you think that men are\nallowed to experience I think that I\nagree with crimson that you know it is\ndumb that men are pressured not to\nexperience an emotion absolutely it's\nanger right and so the funny thing is\neven if you think about like you know\nlet's say the the example of the person\nI'm working with who his his fiancee\ncheated on him what do you think his\ninitial emotional reaction was to\nfinding out that his his fiancee was\ncheating on him absolutely right he\ncomes into my office and he says I'm so\npissed off\nand the more that you think about it\nlike that feels like a completely normal\nlike everyone can identify and relate to\nthat right to feel pissed off but\nunderneath he's feeling all kinds of\nother things like will I ever be able to\ntrust someone again is there like there\nare also other things that he's feeling\nwhich it takes a while to to like get to\nwhich is is there something about me\nwhich is like broken and busted is there\nsomething about me which makes it so\nthat like is there something that I'm\ndoing wrong which caused her to cheat am\nI not good enough those are all the\nthings that are under underneath anger\nbut though that's not what he feels the\nfirst thing that he feels is pissed off\nand so this is true of gamers as well\nwe're like you know we're and now we\nkind of get to we come full circle so we\ncome full circle and we kind of get to\ntoxicity and gaming so why is it that\ngamers are so toxic and there's so much\ntoxicity in gaming it's because the main\nemotion that most gamers let themselves\nfeel is anger anger is a very reasonable\nemotion to have but there are also a lot\nof other emotions that kind of swim\nbeneath the surface\n[Music]"
