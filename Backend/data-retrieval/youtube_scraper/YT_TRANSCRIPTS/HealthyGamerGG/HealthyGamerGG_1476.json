    "transcript": "so if you drink caffeine every morning\nat the first cup of caffeine that you\never have in your life is gonna make you\ncompletely wired and so what happens\nover time is benefit caffeine every day\nis your your body develops a tolerance\nto that caffeine and then if you don't\nhave caffeine you feel really crappy and\neven if you do have caffeine it doesn't\nactually have you up it just makes you\nfeel normal guys with me so what what\nvideo games do is they release that\nconstant stream of dopamine and then\nwhat the brain does is actually down\nregulates the response of that doughnut\nso if you talked if you really look at\npeople who play video games like a lot\nthey actually don't have fun while\nthey're playing bang but it becomes\nsomething like happy where if they don't\nplay the game they just don't feel like\nthe other thing that's really dangerous\nthat it does is it actually it makes\npeople and hedonic which means it makes\npeople have difficulty finding pleasure\nfrom other activities and so the reason\nfor that is like let's say you read a\nbook in a book normally you can find it\nenjoyable but if your dopamine circuits\nhave been so down regulated because the\nintensity of dopamine release that you\nget the intensity and consistency of\ndopamine release you get from a game is\nso high that like it down rate increases\nyour entire these Olympics circuit which\nmeans things that you would normally\nfind enjoyable gamers have more trouble\nfinding jointly"
