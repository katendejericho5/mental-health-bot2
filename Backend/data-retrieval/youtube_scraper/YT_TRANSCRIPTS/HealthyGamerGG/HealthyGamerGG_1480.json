    "transcript": "that's a question how much money you\nthink the top four nights dreamer Bates\nhow many so 12 million dollars a year\nright so this is yes so this is the\nother thing when I talk about video\ngames not mean game so I work with some\nprofessional gamers so these are people\nwho like make their living - playing\nvideo games and so for you know when you\ntell your kid like hey I want you to\nlike grow up and be a doctor an\ninvestment banker you know and I want\nyou like why do you want to be in the\nbest banker so I can make 500 grand a\nyear and then there's a 16 year old kid\nhe's like I can do that today so you\nknow there are a lot of kids who like\nplay basketball there play football do\nyou think that they're gonna be in the\nNBA the NFL and the sad truth is that\njust a you know a tiny percentage of\nthem ever do it and I think when it\ncomes to having a conversation so I work\nwith some people who you know tried to\ngo pro and when I talked to them and I\nthink I talked to them about the numbers\nso you know if you have a\ntwelve-year-old son\nyou should ask them you know what you\nknow what percentage how much money you\nwanna make here and what percentage of\npeople make that money how many people\nplay for at night and how many of you\npeople make money from it and I'm not so\nsure that a twelve-year-old can think\nthat abstractly like a 15 year old of 60\nyear old on Medicaid and so I think when\nwhen they really when you really show\nthem the numbers I think that that is\none step but with a 12 year old I think\nyou really have to set limits and I\nthink the other thing which will kind of\nget to is I think one of the most\nimportant things that you can do as a\nparent so is to talk to your kids talk\nto them about why they play video games\nbecause the problem is that you guys I\nmean this is an indictment that y'all\ndon't understand"
