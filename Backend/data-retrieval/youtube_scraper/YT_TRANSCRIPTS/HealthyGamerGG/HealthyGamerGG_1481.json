    "transcript": "welcome everyone my name is Alec Cano\njeah I'm a psychiatrist who practices in\nBoston Massachusetts thank you all for\ncoming to the hell the first of its kind\nhealthy gamer lecture series and for\nthose of you who are joining us from the\ninternet welcome as well a couple of\nthings just kind of in terms of\nhousekeeping so in 2018 we're gonna try\nto do a couple more workshops or\nseminars in the Boston area and\ndepending on how much interest or\ntraction we get we may try to do\nsomething in New York City for those of\nyou who are kind of interested in\nworking longitudinally or continuing\nafter this we do have a couple of online\noptions you know there are there is a\nmailing list we have a couple of discord\ngroup chats where people can kind of\nwork through stuff together those have\nbeen going really well and then we're\ngonna continue to make other kinds of\ncontent so there may be down below in\nthe comment section you guys should see\nlike you guys can follow me on Twitter\nand there will be a couple of different\nemail addresses that you guys can sign\nup for if you're interested in workshops\nif you're interested in more online\ncontent if you're interested in any of\nthe online groups you can get connected\nto everything down there so if you guys\nhave any questions about any of that you\nknow ask me or one of the other staffers\nafter we're done\nso just to let you guys know a little\nbit about why I call this kind of the\nhealthy gaming lecture series a few\nyears ago when I was training I got kind\nof curious about video game addiction\nand the more people that I talk to the\nmore I realized that like the\npsychiatric community doesn't actually\nknow much about video game addiction and\nI realized that the reason for that is\nbecause most people who are kind of at\nthe forefront the leaders of thought\nwithin the field of psychiatry and\npsychology are like experts right so\nthey're like people in their 50s and 60s\nif you look at people who are like\nChiefs of Psychiatry so for example I\ntrained at this place called\nMassachusetts General Hospital in\nanother place called McLean Hospital and\nthe chief of psychiatry at MGH is this\nguy named Jerry Rosenbaum he's off he's\nan awesome guy but he's like he's like\nolder and I don't know if he's ever\nreally played\nvideo games so all of the people who are\nkind of leading the field of psychiatry\nif you look at people like the president\nof the American Psychiatric Association\nall of those people are like older and\nthey haven't really had experience\nplaying video games and so they don't\nactually know what it's like to play\nvideo games and they really struggle to\nhelp people who struggle with video game\naddiction\nso when I started to do is I got kind of\ncurious about it and I realized that\nactually none of my mentors are leaders\nin the field could actually tell me much\nabout it because they didn't know much\nabout it so what I started to do is just\nstarted working with gamers so I just\ntalked to people on my started out with\nlike kind of my Steam friends list and\nthen over time as I started talking to\nmore and more people I started getting\nemails and people that I talked to were\nlike hey maybe you should talk to this\nguy and word of mouth kind of spread and\nI ended up working with over the last\nthree years\nyou know maybe 50 or 60 gamers and spent\nhundreds of hours working with these\npeople and then even recently started to\nget requests to work with some\nprofessional video game players in terms\nof like stress management and things\nlike that and so I just started working\nwith people and trying to figure out\nlike you know why is it that you guys\nplay video games and and what can we do\nto help you with your addiction one of\nthe first things that I realized when I\nwas working with these people is that I\ndon't think addiction is really a great\nterm you know I think this is part of\nthe problem with the field of Psychiatry\nis we try to take things that we know\nlike drug addiction and alcohol\naddiction and we try to apply it to new\nphenomenon like video game addiction and\nso we call we sort of all lump those\nthings together but in my mind there's a\nhuge difference between someone who's an\nalcoholic and someone who's addicted to\nvideo games I mean I myself almost\nfailed out of college due to playing way\ntoo much way too many video games when I\nwas like in a freshman and sophomore and\nso I was kind of there and I still feel\nlike I haven't changed it's not like my\naddiction got cured it's just my help my\ngaming used to be what I like to call\nproblematic and now it's become\nhealthier so it used to really interfere\nwith the goals that I had for myself\nand interfere with my life like I was\nlike I remember sleeping through my\nSpanish final freshman year because I\nwas playing Diablo 3 or Diablo 2 until\nlike 4:00 in the morning and I remember\nlike my alarm going off at 7:30 that I\nhave a final in an hour and I just like\nturned off my alarm and went back to\nsleep and then like failed Spanish\nbecause I just [ __ ] slept through the\nfinal that is a problem right that's\nwhen your gaming is a problem and now\nyou know I still play games I still\nenjoy playing games I'd love to play\nmore games but I'm too busy doing this\n[ __ ] with you guys instead of actually\nplaying games but that's ok I'm ok with\nthat\nbecause I feel like this is something\nthat I find meaningful and fulfilling\nand so games have become kind of more of\na recreation for me and that's what I'd\nlike to help what I'd like to help you\nguys do so it's not about whether you're\na video game addict or not and we will\ntalk a little bit about you know how do\nyou decide if your gaming is a problem\nhow do you decide if you're an addict\nbut what I really like to do today is\nhelp you guys learn how to be a healthy\ngamer and this is another thing so in\nthe addiction world you know there's\nthis idea that it's abstinence only if\nyou're an alcoholic it's like you know\n10 years sober and you're never allowed\nto have a single drink my understanding\nis that video game addiction is\ndifferent because there are a lot of\npeople I've worked with who used to have\nreally problematic gaming who still\nenjoy playing games for they're doing\nfine in life now one of the people that\nI work with is he's actually a really\nsuccessful entrepreneur makes like seven\nfigures a year and still plays like\nvideo games for like 30 hours a week and\nI think he's okay with that and I think\nthat's fine too if you're doing\neverything that you want to do and and\nyou want to play video games for 30\nhours a week that's fine go for it\nso today what I'd like to do is kind of\njust start by reframing a little bit so\nthe first thing is that you know it's\nnot about whether you're an addict or\nnot I think where we need to start is to\nhelp you guys understand why you play\nvideo games in the first place and what\nfunction video games serve for you and\nthen we also need to think about how do\nvideo games shape you how do they change\nyour brain how do they affect your neuro\nchemistry how do they affect your\nability to form relationships and your\nability to solve problems because they\ndefinitely do when a human brain does\nsomething for\nhours a day pretty much every day of the\nweek that whatever whatever activity\nthey do is gonna change their brain if\nyou think about someone who plays music\nfor four hours a day that's gonna change\nthe way their brain works it's gonna\nchange the way that their auditory\ncortex develops and in that same way\ngaming shapes you guys so the goals of\nthese lectures are not necessarily to\novercome your addiction but to gain\nunderstanding about yourself and\nunderstanding about how the gaming that\nyou do shapes the person that you are\nand so today we're gonna cover a couple\nof different topics so we're gonna talk\nabout some just general things about\nsort of introduction to gaming and how\nyou know whether it's a problem or how\nyou know whether it's an addiction we're\ngonna talk about some things involving\ncognition so how does gaming change the\nway that you think and change the way\nthat you approach problems we're gonna\ntalk a little bit about neuroscience\nbecause one of the things that I found\nis that gamers are actually really good\nat dealing with complicated information\nand one of the reason that I love\nworking with you guys is I can actually\ntalk about technical neuroscience and it\nbizarrely does not go over your heads\nyou guys are actually able to assimilate\nand use that information in a way that\nvery few of my patients are so we're\ngoing to talk about neuroscience we're\ngonna talk about cognition we're gonna\ntalk about some general principles we're\nalso going to talk about relationships\nso we'll talk a little bit about how you\nform relationships and games how that\nworks how gaming interferes with\nrelationships and we're also going to\ntalk a little bit about emotions I'm\ngonna sneeze okay and so my hope is that\nby helping you guys understand a little\nbit about who you are and how you work\nhow your emotions work how your\ncognition works how you form\nrelationships what's happening in your\nbrain my hope is to equip you or empower\nyou with this information so that you\ncan get understanding around your gaming\nand by gaining understanding eventually\nget control over this person that you\nare and by getting control over yourself\nmy hope is that you can move in the\ndirection that you want to and stop\nbeing a problematic gamer and start\nbeing a healthy gamer\nyou"
