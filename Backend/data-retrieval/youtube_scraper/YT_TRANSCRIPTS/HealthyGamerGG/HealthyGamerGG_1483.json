    "transcript": "we've talked some about the neuroscience\nof gaming we've talked some about\nemotions we've talked to about a couple\nof introductory topics around gaming and\nwhat I'd like to talk about now is how\nyou start actually getting control of\nyour gaming and how it is that you can\nactivate your motivation you can\novercome some of that laziness you can\nsort of get your emotions in line\nthere's some concrete things that you\ncan do to get control of your gaming and\nthe first of those is to understand that\nyou can't overcome an addiction without\na competing interest if we think a\nlittle bit about so I mostly work with\npeople who have problems with other\naddictions like alcohol or opiates or\nthings like xanax or marijuana and for a\nlot of them the the substance that they\nuse serves a very important purpose in\ntheir life it helps them manage stress\nit helps them kind of decompress a\nlittle bit it helps them manage their\nnegative emotions and it's really hard\nto just get them to quit it's not enough\nto tell someone hey you know you're\ngonna if you keep on drinking you're\ngonna get liver cancer and you'll die\nearly or you'll have an increased risk\nof heart disease in order to really get\nthem to stop drinking and this is\nespecially true actually less of Meral I\nmean alcohol but the most true of\nmarijuana you have to help them develop\na competing interest and so what I mean\nby that is let's take an example of\nsomeone who smokes marijuana that person\nis gonna be smoking and they feel like\nmarijuana helps them deal with their\nanxiety it makes them feel like they're\nthemselves for the first time like\nthey're not so much in their head and it\nmakes them feel really good and so for\nsomething that's so awesome like\nsomething that makes you feel\ncomfortable\nit's really hard to just give that up\nand so in order to help that person give\nthat up what we have to work on is\nfinding what I call a competing interest\nso I'd like to tell you guys kind of a\nrandom story so when I was studying\nPublic Health I heard a really\ninteresting story about a real estate\ndevelopment project in New York and this\nwas kind of in in the Upper West Side of\nNew York like 30 or 40 years ago there\nwas\nreal estate developer that wanted to\ncome in and sort of buy up a bunch of\nproperty and then turn it into like a\nhigh-rise and so the people who lived in\nthat community didn't want that real\nestate developer to come in and buy that\nproperty and so what they did is they\nwent to these town council meetings and\nstuff and they protested and they said\nwe don't want that real estate developer\nto develop this land we don't want it to\nhappen we don't want it to happen we\ndon't want it to happen and despite all\nof their protests the real estate\ndevelopment started moving forward and\nthen finally one guy came up with the\nidea or a girl I think actually it was a\nwoman but one person came up with the\nidea that instead of saying no to the\nreal estate development what they\nstarted doing is saying we actually want\na part instead instead of actually\nopposing the real estate development\nwhat they did is create some competition\nand they said we want to devote this\narea of our part of New York City to\nbuilding a park and something magical\nhappened when they started advocating\nfor a park instead of trying to block\nthe real estate development the more\nthat they advocated for the park it\nseemed to get traction and other people\nin the community were like wow wouldn't\nit be awesome to have a park here\ninstead of a high-rise and they were\nable to get a lot more support for it\nand ended up blocking the real estate\ndevelopment and building a park instead\nand so if we look at that story I mean\nit sounds like it's completely unrelated\nbut I think it speaks to this basic\nhuman psychology that in order to to\nblock something you actually have to\nreplace it you can't just stop it and so\nfor gamers the first thing that you guys\nneed to do is come up with a competing\ninterest so you have to have a reason to\nnot game and I would argue that most of\nyou guys when I ask you guys do you want\nto stop gaming you'll say yes I want to\nstop gaming and I'll ask you why do you\nwant to stop gaming and you'll say well\nbecause I need to get a job or because I\nI need to move out of the house or\nbecause I'm not moving forward in life\nand all of those things are true but\nthey're not really a competing interest\ngetting a job in being financially\nindependent or just things that you want\nyou don't actually care about them they\ndon't drive you to do things they don't\naffect your behavior\nthey're just desires\nand desires and motivators are actually\ndifferent things a competing interest is\nsomething that you actually care about\nit's like earlier when I was talking\nabout the guy who's smoking if I want\nhim to stop smoking I can't tell him\nabout lung cancer so if I have a guy\nwho's smoking and I try to get him to\nquit smoking I say oh if you smoke\nyou're gonna get heart disease you're\ngonna die of a heart attack you're gonna\ndie of a stroke you're gonna get lung\ncancer you're gonna be wheeling around\nan oxygen tank you're not gonna be able\nto breathe you're not gonna be able to\nclimb stairs and all of those things are\nabsolutely true and he doesn't want any\nof those things to happen but none of\nthat information actually changes his\nbehavior he doesn't actually stop\nsmoking irrespective of how much he\nwants to avoid lung cancer what gets\nthat person to change is actually\nsomething that they care about a real\ncompeting interest what I what I'd ask\nthat person is do you ever want to see\nyour daughter get married do you want to\never meet your grandkids do you want to\nsee your grandkids go to college those\nare things that that person cares about\nand those are things that are competing\ninterests and when you develop a\ncompeting interest that helps you\nactually fight against the gaming\naddiction because then you have\nsomething that actually gets lost if you\nchoose to continue gaming you have a\nreal cost to gaming whereas right now\nyou don't really have a cost to gaming\nsure you don't move forward in life but\ntomorrow is not gonna be any different\nyou're not gonna be out on the street if\nyou play video games all day today\nyou're not gonna die of hunger tomorrow\nif you play video games all day you're\nnot gonna die alone if you play video\ngames all day now you will die alone if\nyou play video games for the rest of\nyour life but for tomorrow there's\nactually no cost to playing video games\nall day and you guys really have to\nunderstand that that in order for you to\nstop gaming there has to be a cost today\nthere has to be something that you lose\ntoday by gaming today and developing\nunderstanding that requires you to\ndevelop a competing interest and once\nyou develop a competing interest then\nyou actually have skin in the game you\nyou put your you've kind of gone all-in\nyou're putting chips on the table\nyou're actually betting something you\nhave something to lose and the\ninteresting thing is that once you have\nsomething to lose that's gonna change\nyour behavior automatically if I were to\ntell you if you play video games\ntomorrow I'm gonna shoot you in the face\nand here's a handgun you're not gonna\nplay video games tomorrow you're just\nnot going to do it because it actually\nhas a cost if I tell you here's $1,000\nif you play World of Warcraft tomorrow\nI'm not going to give it to you\nbut if you don't play World of Warcraft\ntomorrow I will give it to you that\nperson is not going to play World of\nWarcraft because there's a tangible cost\nthere is a competing interest there's\nsomething that they actually gain by not\ngaming in the subtle problem that gamers\nface is that they think they have a\ncompeting interest because what they\nroot but what they really have is\ndesires they have a desire they're like\nyeah I want to be rich that's like I\nwant to be rich to like everyone on the\nstreet wants to be rich it doesn't\nactually cause them to change their\nbehavior so if you actually want to get\ncontrol over your gaming the first thing\nyou need to do is develop a competing\ninterest and we'll take a short break\nbut when we get back we'll talk a little\nbit about how to go about doing that"
