    "transcript": "now we get to actually my favorite part\nof lecture series which is relationships\nI think relationships are absolutely\nfascinating and I think the\nrelationships that we form online and\nhow gamers connect to other people\nthrough the internet is just an\nabsolutely fascinating topic so just to\ngive you guys a little bit of\ninformation\nI started playing Starcraft with this\nguy when I was 15 years old and then\nlike over the next 10 years of our life\nwe were like gaming together never met\nthe dude and then when I ended up\ngetting married I actually invited him\nto my wedding which all of my like like\nmy bosses and professors and stuff when\nI tell them that they're stuntin but I\nthink you guys will understand what I\nmean because like the relationships that\nwe form through online gaming can\nactually be really authentic and I'd\nreally like to start there\ntalking a little bit about the\nauthenticity of online friendship so one\nof the things that's really interesting\nabout when you meet someone online is\nthat the internet really blinds people\nto all the kinds of things that we tend\nto judge people for so when you talk to\nsomeone on the internet you don't know\nif they're black or they're white or\nthey're Indian or Hispanic or Asian or\nany of that well maybe you do depending\non their name or their voice or the\naccent but generally speaking the\nInternet is blind you don't know if that\nperson is rich or they're poor you don't\nknow if they're they're attractive or\nunattractive you really don't know\nanything about them and if you think\nabout the real world the real world is\nincredibly judgmental and if I walk into\na room and you know I have this fleece\nwhich has like the Harvard logo on it I\nget treated differently people give me\nrespect that I'm not I don't actually\ndeserve just because of the institution\nthat I'm affiliated with that says\nnothing about me I mean like even the so\nfor example my sister-in-law I gave her\none of these fleeces for like just to\nwear because I had a next one and so she\nwalks around and she kind of you know\nwears this fleece and people think she's\naffiliated with Harvard Medical School\nwhich she's not but so people just judge\nother people based on all kinds of kind\nof shallow criteria right yeah if you're\nif you're a pretty girl or a good\nlooking guy you're more likely to get\nbetter service at a restaurant and so\nthe real world can actually be\nincredibly racist and shallow and unfair\nwhereas when you meet someone online\nthey're gonna go tell you to go\nyourself because of who you are not\nbecause of the color of your skin right\nthey're gonna they tell you that they\nwant to your mom because of who you\nare and it's not blinded by race or\nethnicity or gender or anything like\nthat\nactually genders you know an interesting\nexception because a lot of times gender\ndoes create a lot of really bizarre and\nsometimes toxic mechanics online so I'll\nsteer a little bit clear of that so the\ninteresting thing about relationships\nover the Internet is people sort of see\nyou for who you are\nthey judge their friendship of you based\non what you say in how you act and how\nyou play the game and so in a sense\nyou're judged on a more authentic level\nthan based on the color of your skin or\nhow attractive you are or what kind of\ncar you drive because none of that\nmatters on the Internet\nso the Internet is amazingly you know\nkind of like they say justice is blind\nthe Internet is blind and people tend to\nget valued for who they are instead of\nsome attribute of their birth or their\nparents and so I think that's really\npowerful and I think that's one of the\nthings that I like the most about\nrelationships that form on the Internet\nis they feel more authentic to me the\nother interesting thing about\nrelationships that are formed on the\ninternet is that they tend to be in a\nlot of stresses sense and a lot of\nsenses stronger than the relationships\nthat you form in real life and that has\nsomething to do with that has everything\nto do with just simple things like\ngeography so I'll give you guys an\nexample you know when I was in high\nschool I had a particular set of friends\nand I'm sure you guys are whether you're\nin high school or college or working or\nwhatever you have your group of friends\nright and then if you think about it\nlike when I left my small town in East\nTexas and went to the University of\nTexas at Austin I sort of left my\nfriends behind some of my friends came\nwith me and then I made a new group of\nfriends I sort of stayed in touch with\nsome people from high school but I had\nthis kind of news\nfriends and I thought that those guys\nwere gonna be like the best friends from\nmy life I joined a fraternity it was\nawesome I had a fantastic time and then\nafter I finished college I actually\nmoved to Boston where I ended up as a\nresearch assistant and so I sort of left\nall my friends from Texas behind and\nthen went up to Boston and made a new\nset of friends and then I ended up\nleaving but that job in going to medical\nschool and so I made a new set of\nfriends in medical school and then I\nleft medical school and went to\nresidency and made a new set of friends\nwhen I was training to become a\npsychiatrist and so when at the end of\nthe road when I'm making friends with\npeople who are also gonna be\npsychiatrists I've gotten so far away\nfrom the people that I hung out with in\nhigh school that that those\nrelationships have basically ended the\ninteresting thing is that the friends\nthat I made online through gaming were\nthe friends that I took with me at each\nstep of the way\nso even after I left high school I still\nwas playing Starcraft with the same\ngroup of people and then we started\nplaying Wow together and then we started\nplaying F of 14 and then we started\nplaying dota and lawl and other MOBAs\nand like now we play some overwatch but\nthose same sets a set of people are the\npeople that I've been hanging out with\non Friday nights for the last decade of\nmy life and so those are the people that\nI actually feel the closest to and\nthat's why it's so crazy when you think\na little bit about inviting this guy to\nmy wedding who I've never met before\nit's because he was there when I started\ndating my wife like I said I distinctly\nremember you know we've been playing\ngames for like six years together now\nand you know I disappear for a month or\ntwo and then I log on one day and he's\nlike dude where the have you been\nlike you haven't been online for two\nmonths and I was like hey man I met a\ngirl and so like you know he gave me\n about it and then he was kind of\nthere before my relationship started he\nwas there when my relationship started I\nremember talking to to him about my wife\nand like sort of you know thinking that\nit wasn't gonna last and it wouldn't\nwork out because I was junior and she\nwas a freshman and all this kind of\nstuff but and so he was kind of there as\nis I decided to move to Boston and then\nshe decided to move to New York and then\nwhen she moved in with me so he was kind\nof there at the start of my relationship\nbefore my relationship and as my\nrelationship had grown and progressed\nhe was kind of aware of the whole thing\nand so he was actually a really true and\nauthentic friend of mine and so I think\nthat we have to start off by\nunderstanding that gaming isn't all bad\nthat gaming actually offers us a lot of\nthings that are really positive and\nreally powerful in our life not just in\nterms of coping mechanisms but that it's\namazing that there's this part of the\nworld where you can go and not be judged\nfor how rich or poor you are not be\njudged for the color of your skin and\nthat you can form authentic connections\nwith people that will stay with you no\nmatter where you go in the world and so\nI think that's really powerful and the\nfirst thing that we have to understand\nabout relationships and gaming is that\nthere are very real relationships that\nare formed through gaming yet those\nrelationships can be authentic and\nimportant and actually be a big part of\nyour life and so I think it's just\nimportant for us to stop and acknowledge\nthat for a second and you know I think\nlater on we'll get a little bit into how\ngaming negatively impacts your\nrelationships and whether gaming sort of\nkeeps you from forming friendships in\nthe real world because you have this set\nof really authentic friends that you\nspend every weekend with and that can be\npart of the problem but I think we have\nto first understand that gaming offers\nus something and unless we know what\nfunctions it serves for us we're never\ngoing to get control over it and so the\nway that we start with relationships is\nsimply by acknowledging that the\nrelationships we form through gaming are\nblind and actually not based on and are\npermanent"
