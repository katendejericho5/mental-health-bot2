    "transcript": "so when you need social interaction and\nyou go to socially interact what happens\ngets overwhelmed right so I know it\nsounds kind of weird but the antidote to\nsocial inter needing social interaction\nis not social interaction because when\nyou approach the social interaction you\nare full of needs and let's remember\nwhen someone says need social\ninteraction they don't say want social\ninteraction or could be better with a\nlittle bit of social interaction these\npeople wait until they're hungry for it\nso I want y'all to understand this see\nwho do you think is better at getting\ninto a relationship someone who has\nnever been in a relationship before and\ncraves a relationship and needs a\nrelationship and oh my God I need it\nI've been alone for so long it hurts or\nsomeone who broke up with someone about\na year ago has been kind of like on\ntheir own and has kind of like oh maybe\nlike now is time for me to get back into\na\nrelationship okay so as you add needs in\nemotional desperation to the equation it\nactually sabotages your social\ninteraction"
