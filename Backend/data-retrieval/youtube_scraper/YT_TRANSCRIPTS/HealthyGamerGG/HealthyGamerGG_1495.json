    "transcript": "so we're now going to dig into one of\nthe most important aspects of being a\ngamer which is being lazy so show of\nhands who here said who here describes\nthemselves as lazy so pretty much\neveryone right we're all lazy in human\nbeings are actually designed to be lazy\nif we think about it like human beings\naren't gonna do stuff unless they kind\nof need to do stuff and that's a common\nproblem for the human condition but\ntends to be a particular problem for\ngamers when I talk to gamers and I ask\nyou guys you know why is it that your\nroommate or your friend from high school\nis able to do things and you're not able\nto do things why are you in the position\nthat your net you are you're in now they\nsay because they're lazy and so I think\nthat that's actually a really dangerous\ntrain of thought even if it's true\nbecause there's nothing you can do about\nbeing lazy like laziness is like a trait\nit's like I'm lazy or I'm not lazy some\npeople are lazy and some people aren't\nlazy if you're lazy you're basically\n because you can't you can't make\nthat go away and so the first part of\nlaziness that we're gonna dig into is\nunderstanding a little bit about\nlaziness motivation and willpower you\nknow how these three things fit together\na lot of gamers tell me that their life\nwould be different if they could be\nmotivated so I think we're gonna talk a\nlittle bit about how motivation\ncircuitry within your brain works so the\nfirst thing that recognizes that\nwillpower and motivation are completely\ndifferent things\nif you're motivated to do something you\nactually don't need willpower to do it\nright like let's pause and think about\nthis for a second so I have an apple\nhere and this Apple is is hard to eat if\nI'm full if I'm already full and I'm not\nhungry at all and I want to eat this\nApple I actually have to use willpower\nto eat the Apple because I don't feel\nlike eating the Apple as time goes on\nlet's say that an hour from now I start\nto get a little bit hungry or an hour\nfrom an hour later I start to get a\nlittle bit hungry or eight hours from\nnow I'm pretty\nand then suddenly I don't need willpower\nto eat the Apple anymore I'm motivated\nto eat the Apple because I'm now hungry\nI had this internal biological drive to\ndo something and I have this Apple in\nfront of me so I feel hungry my blood\nsugar is dropping and I've got this\nApple so it becomes easy to eat even if\nI don't like apples I you can imagine\nthat if I don't like apples and I wait\neight hours it's still gonna require\nsome willpower for me to eat the apple\nif I wait 24 hours it's gonna be I'm\ngonna be way more motivated to eat the\nApple because I'm gonna be starving if I\nwait 48 hours my motivation to eat the\nApple is gonna be gigantic so the first\nthing to understand is that motivation\nis not actually willpower motivation is\nan internal drive that you sort of don't\nhave control over your body has these\ndifferent circuits in your brain that\ncreate a desire to do something and\nthat's kind of what we call motivation\nthe second thing to understand about\nmotivation is that whether you actually\ndo something engage in a behavior or not\nis not just based on the biological\ndrive it also has to do with\navailability so if I am starving this\nApple is really easy to eat but if I'm\nnot very hungry I still may eat an apple\nif you put it in front of me so our\ndesire to our ability to actually engage\nin a behavior actually depends on the\navailability of what's around us so if I\nwant to eat healthier with a simple\nthing that I can actually do is just\nkeep healthy food around me and make it\neasy for me to eat healthy food if I'm a\nlazy like I am and I just have\nlike healthy food laying around there's\na greater chance that I'll eat it\nbecause since I'm lazy I'm not gonna\nleave the house to go pick up a\nhamburger when there's an apple right\nhere actually I probably will still do\nthat but the chances that I eat food\nthat's healthy is going to be greater if\nit's around so the first thing that\nwe've got to kind of summarize here is\nthat motivation is a combination of an\ninternal Drive\nand availability and this sort of makes\nsense for you guys if you stop and think\nabout it because one thing that a lot of\ngamers tell me is that it's easy for\nthem to do something if they have an\nexternal pressure to do it it's easy to\nstudy geometry if you have a test on\nFriday but it's hard to study geometry\nafter you've taken the test and so if we\nthink about that that motivation to\nstudy comes from the environment and\nthat's kind of like having an apple\navailable a part of our motivation is\nactually based on our environment of\nwhat's available around us and a part of\nit is based on our internal drive so\nwhat does that mean for gamers how do\nyou create motivation well you may not\nbe able to do a whole lot but we can\ntalk a little bit about managing the\ninternal drive but one of the big things\nthat I tell gamers is that a lot of\nmotivation is based on your environment\nso if you hang out with people who go to\nthe gym three times a week there's a\nmuch greater chance that you'll actually\ngo to the gym your motivation will go to\nthe go to the gym will be increased by\nthe kind of people that you spend time\nwith and so one of the biggest things to\nunderstand about your motivation the\nfirst thing to understand is that it's\nnot willpower and that it's actually\nbased on a combination of internal\ndrives and availability or environment\nand so if you think about it that way\nyou can start to problem-solve a little\nbit about okay what is it that I want to\ndo what do I want to change do I want to\ngo to the gym more do I want to eat\nhealthier and then you can structure\nyour environment to sort of prompt you\nto move in the direction that you want\nto go so for example if you want to eat\nhealthier go to the grocery store when\nyou're not starving and buy some healthy\nfood and keep it at home keep an apple\non your desk next to your PC and then\nwhen you feel a little bit hungry it's\neasier to eat the Apple make it easy for\nyourself to do the things that you want\nto do if for example you want to go out\nto lunch try to ask the buddy that\nyou're going out to lunch with hey why\ndon't we go to the gym first we'll like\nworkout from 10:30 to 11:30 and then\ngrab lunch afterward the more that you\ncan structure your environment to\nsupport your be\nbehavior and move you in the direction\nthat you want to go the better off\nyou'll be\nand the funny thing about that is that\nyou don't actually need willpower all\nyou need is to just structure in your\nenvironment in a way that it prompts the\nmotivation that you want"
