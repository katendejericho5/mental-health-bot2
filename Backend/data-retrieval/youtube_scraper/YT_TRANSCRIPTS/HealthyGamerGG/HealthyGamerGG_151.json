    "transcript": "people who crave social interaction go\nsocialize and then isolate are like\npeople who jump into a cold body of\nwater or like this is cold they get out\nand they're like oh my God and then they\njump back in this is what y'all are\ndoing instead of a climatizing you\nrepeat the worst part of the cycle over\nand over and over again just stay in the\nwater and you'll feel better but instead\noh my God it's so cold you have to get\nout and then you jump back in this is\nliterally what happens this is what\ny'all are doing not metaphorically\nliterally think about it right you put\nyourself through this experience over\nand over and over again and it's\nintolerable so you jump out and if you\npay attention to the times when\nsocialization is more tolerable there's\na longer period of time and this is\nwhere people make a mistake they think\noh yeah the reason I hung out with those\npeople 3 hours is because I was feeling\nless socially anxious I got along better\nwith them but it's a chicken or the egg\nthe reason that you remember that\ninteraction as better is because you\ndidn't bow out after 30 minutes of\ntorture"
