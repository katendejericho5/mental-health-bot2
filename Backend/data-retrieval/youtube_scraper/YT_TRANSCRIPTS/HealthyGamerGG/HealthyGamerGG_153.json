    "transcript": "and so when someone says how do I\nconvince this person I think that there\nare a couple of practical things we're\ngoing to say so the first is to\nunderstand the person first right so\nthis is actually like literally the\nproblem that we have with how to raise a\nhealthy gamer is we have a generation of\nparents who are like how do I convince\nmy kid that video games are ruining\ntheir life and this is where we say you\ncan't but here's how right we say first\nyou must understand first seek to\nunderstand then seek to be understood so\nunderstand them first and anytime I look\nat like conflict right so for example\nthere's stuff going on in Gaza right now\nand I'm trying to take sides but the one\nthing that I noticed is that very few\npeople are trying to understand the\nother side all the content is these\npeople are wrong no one is ever asking\nwhy do these people believe this what is\nthe data set that they're using it's not\nwhat is the data it's just they're wrong\neverybody else is wrong and I'm right no\nwonder the world is going to sh we've\nstopped trying to understand each other"
