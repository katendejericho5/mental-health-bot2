    "transcript": "so if you have too much self-awareness\nit's not that you have too much or too\nlittle it's that it's out of control and\nthe last thing that you can do is\nliterally train your awareness and this\nis through the practice of meditation\nbut not just some mindfulness don't do\nthat I you can this is where I strongly\nrecommend you do something called a\ndharana so ad dharana is a focusing\ntechnique where you put your awareness\non a particular object for as long as\nyou can and if it wanders away you bring\nit back it can be the breath it can be\nlooking at something it can be listening\nto something it doesn't really matter so\nthere's one really good Tana I don't\nknow if I have a single Bowl in here but\nwith a singing bowl we used to do this\nexercise where you can grab a singing\nbowl and you ring it and then you try to\npay attention as long as you can and try\nto detect the sound of a singing bowl\nuntil it disappears and so as it gets\nquieter and quieter and quieter you need\nto harness your awareness more and more\nand more to be able to detect it\ntechnically the sound never stops it\njust decays but your ability to detect\nit depends on training your awareness so\ndo Theon on a singing Bowl ring the bow\nand just listen"
