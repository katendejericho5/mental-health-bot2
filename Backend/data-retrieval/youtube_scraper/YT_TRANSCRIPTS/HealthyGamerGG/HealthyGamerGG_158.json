    "transcript": "I wrote this book and someone asked me\nthe question as it was about to be\nreleased are you nervous and I said no\nand they were surprised by that they\nwere like what if it doesn't do well I\nwas like then it doesn't do well see if\nI was worried the right time to be\nworried about whether the book does well\nor not is when I'm writing it after it's\nwritten that ship is sailed right so the\nmoment that I decided to write a book I\nopened myself up to the consequence of\nwriting a book see the only way to truly\nprotect yourself from failure is to\nnever try"
