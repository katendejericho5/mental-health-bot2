    "transcript": "so this is the key thing about trying to\nlive up to others expectations the first\nthing is that their expectations are\nquite divorced from reality right\nbecause they don't know you they don't\nlive with you I mean maybe even if they\ndo the other thing is like okay well\nwhat about people who do live with us so\nI have a mom thankfully and my mom I'm\n41 years old my mom still views me as\nlike a 15-year-old she'll give me like\nrandom advice on crap that I do better\nthan her but in her mind I am her child\nand so she will always view me as less\nknowledgeable than she is because when\nshe was forming her impression of me she\nmade certain judgments and the truth of\nthe mind is that it is not very flexible\nright once you define that you're a dog\nperson you hate all dogs like that's not\ngoing to change very easily so the\nproblem with living up to other people's\nexpectations is that you may never be\nable to live up to that and in fact what\nstarts to happen if you really look at\nit scientifically you look at the\nscience of Behavioral reinforcement the\nmore you live up to someone's\nexpectations the more trapped you will\nbe"
