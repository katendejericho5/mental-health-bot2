    "transcript": "so writing with a pen I think is\nprobably better for a couple of reasons\nwhen you write with a pen what is the\nrate of writing that you do versus if\nyou type pen is slower so if pen is\nslower what that means is that you must\nslow down your thinking in order to\nwrite with a pen whereas with a computer\nwe're so fast at typing that we can move\ncloser to the speed of thought so as you\nslow things down stuff will sink in a\nlittle bit more because your mind is\nliterally spending more time on a\nparticular thought and it gives you a\nchance to kind of organize things out so\nI think in some ways writing with a pen\nis better"
