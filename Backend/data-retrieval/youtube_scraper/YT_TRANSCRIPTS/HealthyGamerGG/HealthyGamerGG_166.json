studies you\nknow if y'all caught us on\nWednesday we were talking about being\nbald and like dating is another one of\nthese things that because I have such a\nvacuum of personal experience in the\nmodern dating world I try to compensate\nby reading lots and lots and lots of\nscience and I'm I'm confident so like\nbefore I used to think like oh like what\ndo I know right cuz personal

does this actually work and that's\nwhat I want to show yall this is\namazing\nso people in our community are putting\ntheir lives together okay so I don't\nknow if yall can see this but this is\nlike this is what we're doing we're\nhelping\npeople operationalize and accomplish\ngoals so grow martial arts Dojo to 20\nstudents starting point 12 regular\nstudents required maintain students\nmaintain energy and satisfaction run\nbeginner courses of 15 people part one\ngrowth beginner course dates right so it\ngets broken down and people are like\n[ __ ] doing it advertise on Facebook\nuh Instagram

can make it your own okay yall can\ndo it however you need to do it so we're\ngoing to show yall a couple of\nothers um here's another one\nso fill out a Health difficulty\nmanagement plan so like loneliness and\nstress here are the warning\nsigns internal coping\nstrategies cook and eat a nice meal\npeople in Social settings that provide\ndistraction people\nprofessionals and crisis hotlines I know\nthis is going to be hard to read so I'm\nreading it out out things I want to\nremember that tends to make me feel\nbetter creativity is awesome there are\namazing people out there that are\nselfless and give me hope so this is\nawesome like this is like I don't know\nif yall kind of get this\nbut see the problem is that like we have\nproblems in\nlife and we don't know how to fix\nthem and the reason we don't know how to\nfix them is if you've been playing video\ngames there's a part of your brain that\nhas\natrophied and that is the part of your\nbrain that deals with something called\nabstract problem\nsolving so what we know is that if you\nlook at\nGamers they struggle with specifically\nsomething called abstract problem\nsolving which is the ability to take an\na a abstract task like put your life\ntogether and break it down into steps so\nif I ask a gamer how do you put your\nlife together like I need to put my life\ntogether and I'm like okay cool how do\nyou do that they're like I don't\nknow cool thing is that gamers are\nbetter at close-ended problem solving\nthis is what games teach us to do\nbecause the games give us the rules they\ngive us the enemy they give us the stats\nthey give us the options they give us\nthe strategies they give us we evolve\nour own meta as long as everything else\nis\nfixed so what we see is that that gamers\nare actually really good the Department\nof Defense did the US Department of\nDefense did a study in 2015 that found\nthat Gamers have a 20% higher fluid IQ\nwhich is a problemsolving IQ if they're\ngiven a set of of pieces they can put\ntogether the\npuzzle but what we suck at is abstract\nproblem solving so what we are trying to\ndo for y'all with make it is we are\ntaking the abstract part and we are\nmaking it concrete we are taking this -\n20% buff or negative 50% buff and we are\ntranslating it into a plus 20% buff we\nare giving you the structure to succeed\nwe're doing our best and it's working\nlike this is we've been doing this for\ntwo days chat two days this is May 3rd\nthis started two days ago and this is\nwhere people are we'll show youall one\nmore this is crazy\ndude hold on where is it where's the\ndigital\norganizing right hold on damn it there\nwas one that I saw that was so\ncool is it that\none hold\non I want to find it there's one I want\nto show youall cuz it's so cool it's\nlike the makes me feel like I should do\nthis\nchat yes here it is okay so we're going\nto show youall a couple more\nokay\num so people are doing things like\nmaking vision\nboards but before we get to that like\nthis is cool I don't know if you guys\ncan see\nthis completed digital organizer you see\nthis [ __ ] desktop chat\nand then we get to here and we get to\nhere and we get to here this is\nbeautiful this is\ngorgeous just clean things up dopamine\ndetox no tech technology until finishing\nbreakfast 5 minutes of yoga read a book\ninstead of watching YouTube rest every\ntwo hours of studying mostly stretching\nand drinking water no\nphone put together your life\nchat people are making calendars vision\nboards\nfood you know making mission\nstatements we're doing it chat mental\nhealth difficulty plan\ndone so here's the thing we talk about\nthese community\nevents like oh my god get points like\nyeah you should do all that stuff get\nthe\npoints but the people who participate\nare the ones that do well you get out\nwhat you put in plus 20% we are\namplifying your\neffort 50% more right so yall got to\nparticipate in order to be\nhelped so the challenge with the HG\nCommunity is Dr K comes here and I tell\ny'all hey this is how this thing\nworks smoothie so\ngood this is how this thing works we\nunderstand this principle understand the\nnud\nunderstand the spirituality but at some\npoint y'all got to do something\nchat y'all got to get into it okay\npeople have worked really hard here at\nHG like we build this stuff\nokay and then do something about\nit all right we\ngood okay and like let's hit a million\nbecause let's see day two is 60,000 so\n30 days is going to be what\n180,000 um 1.8 million okay good oh it's\ntwo days so that's 30,000 no that's not\ngoing to be\nenough right it's going to be 900,000 so\nwe need to kick it up a p a bit to get a\nmillion points and then I shall review\nthe dating\nadvice okay so today not review the\ndating advice review the [ __ ] what\nare they\ncalled the the pickup artists give me a\nchance chat let me do\nit put me in coach put me\nin\nokay so um let me just make sure that\nthis is not going to like break\neveryone's ears so now we are going to\nwatch The Tick Tock you ready\nticktock all right let's go no hoes this\nvideo is for you okay that's too loud\nbuddy you Cal calm it bro in the men's\nspace they talk about looks money and\nStatus they say if you have all three of\nthose on a decent level women should be\ncoming into your life this is where I\nhave a slight push back there are plenty\nof men out there who make over six\nfigures are in decent shape yet their\nDMS their hinge matches their freaking\ney messages are all dry then they get\nmad at the world they're like yo I got\nmy money up I got some decent looks I\ngot some status for my job I'm an\nengineer wear the hose it's because they\ndidn't talk talk about this part efforts\nefforts as you can see just how you went\nafter looks money and status you now\nhave to put that effort into dating and\nobtaining girls number one going out\ntwice a week you can go out just once\nbut if you just sit in the house and\njust wait on matches you're stupid you\nhave to be able to socialize meet a girl\nout in public talk to her get to know\nher if you don't have that skill it's\ngoing to be a lot harder for you killer\nget at pictures a lot of you guys'\nphotos are really bad and I get it most\nmen don't take very good pictures of\nthemselves but this is huge if you're\ngoing to be successful\nonline number three Riz or just being\nable to talk to girls with some Charisma\nif you have looks money and status and\nthen a girl comes up and starts talking\nto you and you're just like uh hey do\nyou like bread sticks oh me too you're\ngoing to dry her up so quick and she's\ngoing to move on to the next guy okay\nyou're going out you got some good\npictures you have good\nRZ this is what's going to maintain her\nthere's going to be a broke dude tonight\nwith decent looks that's going to get\nlaid that girl is going to realize yo\nthis guy's a bum doesn't do much for\nwork but he got laid but if she goes\nback home with you and she sees your\nnice place sees your nice car knows you\nhave a good job that's when you start to\nmaintain them make sure you hit the\nfollow for more content let's go boys\nalrighty so this is the first\none all\nright so the first thing that we got to\nsay is that we got to we got to remember\nthat we're going to\nbe charitable to these people because\nthis is Tik Tok which means it's short\nform which means that there isn't enough\ntime for nuance and and whatnot right so\nthis is kind of like it's really easy to\nrespond negatively to a Tik Tok so my\nologies to all these creators I actually\nreally appreciate all the content that\nyall make I think it has value for\nsure and this is sort of what I love and\nhate about this perspective so what I\nlove about this is first of all this guy\nis like it is not sufficient to do these\nthree things and I love this\nperspective so there's an idea which I\ndon't know why this gets propagated I\nhave some I have some thoughts about\nthis but there's this idea that if you\ndo X Y and Z you will be able to get\ninto a\nrelationship and I think that that these\npeople part of the reason that they they\nsuggest that you need money you need\nheight you need to be sexy you need to\nbe capable you need money you need\nstatus like all these like Alphas right\nso I think that there's a it's a really\ngreat perspective from a business\nstandpoint because what you're asking\npeople to do is something that is so\ndifficult right so I don't know if yall\nhave seen some of these like React\nvideos where people will ask people like\nwhat percentage of men do you think are\nover 6 feet make $100,000 a year and\nlike don't have kids or something like\nthat and it's like an in an in\nincredibly small percentage of people\nmeet these expectations that everyone\nthinks you have to meet and that's why\nit works right so like if I tell y'all\nhey at the top of Mount\nEverest there is an enlightened goat\nthat can time travel and has the voice\nof Jean Luke peard and I'm like y'all\nshould like it's there you just have to\ngo up there and you'll see it so if I\nset a goal that is so\ninsurmountable that no one can ever\nachieve it people can continue believing\nthat the Jean Luke peard goat is on top\nof Mount Everest you just need to go and\nyou'll find it okay so it's like this is\nwhat people do they say like you need to\nachieve a b or\nc and then you will be in a relationship\nso there's another big bias so this\nhappens more commonly for men than women\nlike so if we look at dating advice at\nleast I see it more maybe it's an\nalgorithm thing so why is that that's\nbecause if we look at the way that men\nsupport each other there's research on\nthis there are two kinds of support one\nis something called instrumental support\nand the second is something called\nemotional support instrumental support\nis if you have a problem here are the\nways to fix the problem here's we as men\nare problem solvers so what we do is\nlike we look at the world and we see\nthat there's this 1% of men who are\nsuccessful and we think if we duplicate\nthat success that's the way to be\nsuccessful we don't know how to offer\nemotional support and often times what\nmen and people need in the dating world\ntoday is emotional support Not\ninstrumental support so why is that so\nit let me take step back so let's talk\nabout this right so people say if you\nachieve a or C then you will a and C\nthen you will be successful so this is\nthe way that men think if there is a\nproblem here are the ways to solve it\nbut this is not statistically correct\nbecause the vast majority of people 99%\nof people maybe that's not precisely\ntrue but I want to say upwards of 90% of\npeople in relationships are not going to\nmeet those requ criteria right like all\nyou have to do is like go to a grocery\nstore or go to a playground and you'll\nsee that like not everyone is six foot\nmakes $100,000 a year etc etc etc\nthere's like lots of people ins\nsuccessful the majority people are in\nsuccessful relationships and don't do\nthat kind of thing don't don't meet\nthose requirements okay so it's like\nit's weird but like this is the crazy\nthing right so if you look at people\ngiving dating advice you should get\ndating advice from like 40-year-old\nmarried men who have been married for a\ndecade that's where you should get your\nrelationship advice all these people who\nare giving dating advice like I think\nmost of them are single like they don't\nhave relationships or maybe they do I\ndon't know they don't talk about their\nrelationships right they talk about how\nyou can get into your relationship\nthey're like you should do these things\nand then you can get girls to date you\nfair enough\nokay so let's take a step back and\nrecognize that this is a very hard\nstandard to achieve I think there's a\nreason why everyone kind of gets into it\nbecause it it we all idealize these\npeople we Envy these people so if we\npsychologically Envy someone we think\nokay if I'm like this person then my\nlife will be easy so what I really like\nabout what this person says is that\nthat's insufficient which is absolutely\ntrue so there's this idea that if you\ncheck certain boxes a relationship will\npoof show up like a Genie in a Bottle\ndoesn't work like that why and this is\nwhere we get to the\nproblem\nbecause people are\nhumans women are people they're\nindividual humans and there isn't a\nformula to get an individual person to\nlike you there are statistical\nprobabilities fair enough right they're\nlike statistical things where the more\nmoney you make the more likely you are\nto end up in a relationship the more\nhandsome you are the more likely you are\nto end up in a relationship fair enough\nthere may be S certain variables that\ncorrelate with success but the key thing\nto understand is just because a variable\ntightly correlates with\nsuccess doesn't mean that you cannot\nachieve success without that variable\nright so\nlike you know so people who are\nfinancially\nsuccessful or financial let's say people\nwho are financially\nsecure are correlates with how much\nmoney your parents had fair enough that\nis a fair correlation to make but that\ndoes not mean that deterministically you\nneed Rich parents to be financially\nsecure do you all understand like the\ndichotomy there so this is where like a\nlot of people who are giving dating\nadvice I don't think understand\nstatistics I don't know if they look at\nstatistics like I I don't know right I I\ndon't know but like you got youall got\nto think statistically like if you want\nto understand the world don't think\nanecdotally think statistically so the\nnext thing that we're going to talk\nabout is this person says this is\ninsufficient and that's correct because\nand I see this all the time especially\nin in med school and with my friends who\nare doctors everyone says oh like girls\nwant to date doctors oh\nyeah and so some guy goes to med school\nand he's like I'm a doctor now where\nwhere are the ladies why why am I still\nsingle yeah it's like so if you look at\nif you ask a girl what her preference is\nshe may say yeah I'd love to date a\ndoctor but that is not sufficient to\nachieve an outcome so if we look at like\nyou know science we have certain things\nthat are necessary for an outcome and\ncertain things that are sufficient for\nan outcome money status and power are\nnot sufficient to find a relationship\nand you can go to like an anime\nconvention and you'll see dudes there\nwho are dating\npeople who appear to not have money\npower or status right they're at Anime\nconventions I'm not saying they're\nlosers right so pay pay attention to my\nwords they don't appear to have these\nthree things so if you look at the vast\nmajor maity of people who end up in\nrelationships they're not incredibly\npowerful they're not incredibly\nsuccessful and they're not incredibly\nhandsome they\nare almost by definition averagely\nsuccessful averagely attractive and\naveragely Powerful like that's what\nhappens like like you know think about\nyour parents think about your friends at\nschool and think about their parents you\ndon't need to go camping a playground\nright just think about the people that\nyou grew up with and the people that you\nknow so this is what I like about what\nthis person says he's like it requires\neffort fair enough like this is good so\nthat is not\nsufficient then he talks about just get\nRiz right the question is\nhow and like it's cool that you're\nbringing up this point of like effort\nand maybe that's why we need to\nsubscribe to this person's Channel and\nhe'll tell us how to get Riz and and\nthings like that like yeah I agree\nthere's effort involved but it's he's\nlike you know you got to be going out\ntwice a week like I think this is good\nin some ways but it's hard so now let's\nlike tunnel down into y'all pick one\nwhat do y'all out this guy says that you\ngot to have let's go back to this\nthing okay hold\non defund sying and hey if you guys like\nthis stuff like check out their content\nsubscribe to them you know like that's\nall great like I I don't I don't think\nthat's a bad\nthing\nokay let's see okay\nso I what I like about this is that that\nhe's he's good at at least like pointing\nout that there's like additional\nfactors okay so now he says like go out\ntwice a week so like I think this is\ngood so let's understand a little bit\nabout oh so so let's like give the dude\nprops for a couple things one is he\npoints out that you need good pictures\nright especially if you're using dating\napps so this is like this is a system\nwhere people make selections primarily\nbased on appearance so you should\noptimize your pictures like this is\nfantastic advice I agree\ncompletely so go out twice a week and\nraise and maintain so I also think that\nthis guy points out like stumbles on I\nthink a very very important principle\nwhich we need to\nunderstand see there's a huge flaw in\nthe research around\ndating so there's a lot of research that\nasks men and women what are your\npreferences these are hypotheticals\nthey're like what what kind of person\nwould you be interested in dating and\nthen people will say I want to date\nsomeone over six feet I want to date\nsomeone who has big boobs I want to date\nsomeone who's very attractive\nwhatever this is a very different\nquestion from who are you dating and who\nhave you dated so that to understand the\nbig problem is and we'll see a lot of\nlike I see this a lot in like incel or\nDoomer forums where they'll site these\nstudies that say women prefer this kind\nof man these iies have a huge problem\nI'll give you all an\nexample so there's a beautiful study\nthat someone did on focus groups so for\nthose of you all that don't know a focus\ngroup is when you get a group of\npotential customers and you get feedback\nabout a\nproduct and so you ask the focus group\npeople let's say I'm selling this pen\nokay and so if I'm selling this pen I'll\nask the focus group hey like do you like\nthe pen do you think it's good what do\nyou think about the color\nor you know we're going to charge $8.99\nfor this pen you know would you buy this\npen do you think it's worth $8.99 and\npeople in focus groups will say yes we\nthink it's great it's got this back end\nover here that comes off that's\nfantastic it's got this front end over\nhere this is great it looks really nice\nit feels good it has a nice weight to it\nand the focus group people give you\nfeedback and then they said do you think\nthis pen is worth $8.99 the focus group\npeople say yes there's like 12 of them\nlike 10 of them say\nyes and then these researchers did\nsomething beautiful they said great now\nbuy it give us $8.99 and you will get a\npen almost no one bought it right I\ndon't remember the exact number but it's\nlike 20% or less or something like that\nso there is a huge difference so this\nexperiment showed something very very\nimportant when you ask human beings a\nquestion about what they would do and\nwhat and what they actually do these are\napples and oranges you actually cannot\ncorrelate them and we have data that\nshows that they do not\ncorrelate that the hypothetical of who\nyou would\ndate is very different from who you\nactually date this is a fundamental\nweakness in the research so if you want\nto understand how to date like don't\nsurvey people because it doesn't\ntranslate case in point I had one rule\nin my dating life I'm not going to date\nan Indian\ngirl and if you're an Indian boy you\nknow\nwhy and my wife had one rule in dating\nshe is not going to date an Indian\nboy and if you are an Indian girl you\nknow why right and even if you're of\nsome other ethnicity you may be of an\nethnicity where you know exactly what\nI'm talking about just anyone except for\nthe the the same ethnicity as yourself\nand look at that we had these rules if\nyou ask me questions in fact I even said\nthis to my friends when they would try\nto set me me up on dates or they would\nask me what girls I like or like hey you\nthink she's hot like whatever I was like\nyeah she may be attractive and she may\nbe great but like there's no way I'm\ngoing to date any your girl no no no no\nno no no this was my one rule and look\nat who I ended up\nwith so there's a huge difference\nbetween what people say they would do\nand what they actually do and so there's\na lot of Hope for yall okay it's\nimportant to understand this\nnow so completely agree that we need\nkiller dating apps and then maintain I\nthink this is another really good point\nto think about so we also know from the\nresearch that there is a big difference\nbetween what people find\nattractive and what allows them to enter\na relationship initial\nattraction and value in a relationship\nare two very very very different things\nokay so the things that lead to an early\nrelation ship the psychological factors\nthe needs that are met are very\ndifferent from what lead to a later\nrelationship and this is why\nrelationships start and end so I know\nthis sounds kind of\nweird but if we really stop and think\nabout it it is strange that\nrelationships start and end what\nchanges right so why if you're willing\nto date someone for one week why aren't\nyou willing to be with them for the rest\nof your life like it's weird right like\nwhat Chang in that time because\nsomething must\nchange and this is what's beautiful so\nif you look at relationships what tends\nto happen is you have something like you\nknow we all know this you're in\nlove and the crazy thing about being in\nlove is like our genes our gonads are\nlike we need to\nprocreate so we're going to we're going\nto go to this part of your brain which\nmakes good decisions and we're going to\nshortcircuit it cuz we need to procreate\nand if we made calculated decisions the\nhuman race would die out we need to be\nable fall in love and when you fall in\nlove I don't know the Neuroscience\nbehind this I've looked at it some time\nago I don't think it's really well\nfigured out but we know that there's all\nkinds of weird problems with impulsivity\nso when we're in love we make impulsive\ndecisions we know that the emotional\ncircuitry of our brain is in a war with\nour frontal loes and the more\ncalculating parts of our cerebral\ncortices so when you get emotional you\nmake bad decisions right like that's but\nthat's the question is why why does the\nhuman brain make bad decisions when\nwe're emotional why wouldn't we want to\nevolve to always make good decisions\nbecause if we evolve to make always make\ngood decisions the human race would die\nout making bad decisions is an\nevolutionary Advantage because that's\nwhy we end up\npregnant it's a brilliant system and it\nrequires the short circuiting of your\nbrain so why do people date for a year\nand then break up because you were with\nthem for a year what happened so what\nhappened is there is a tolerance that\nbuilds\nup to\nthis\nlove the honeymoon phase\nends and as the honeymoon phase ends you\nbegin to see all of these problems that\nwere always there you saw them before\nbut you did you ignored them you ignored\nthem right and this guy gives the\nexample of some lady is going home with\na a broke person today and then you know\nwhat is going to keep her around is like\nthe other stuff and that's I think a\nfair assessment\nright because we'll do anything stupid\nfor one day it's as the months go on\nwhen these kind of the the honeymoon\nphase ends and then like we sort of end\nup like realizing who this person is or\nthey're not growing or we were hoping\nthey would change or whatever right\nwe're growing into different people like\nall of that stuff comes into play and\nthat's why relationships start and end\nso if you want to maintain a\nrelationship you have to focus on those\nthings and in my experience you know the\nthe whole point of I mean what makes a\nsuccessful relationship is not two\npeople but two evolving people and two\npeople who evolve in a like a a\nsynchron in a synchronous\nmanner so you are going to change over\nthe course of your relationship your\npartner is going to change over the\ncourse of the relationship and hopefully\nyall like intertwine with each other\nyall are kind of like a trellis and a\nVine right where one of y'all provide\nsome scaffolding one of y'all provide\nsome support and you guys kind of like\ngrow together\nlike a proper parasitic\nVine right if it's if it's a really good\nrelationship so the the factors to\nattract someone and the factors to stay\nin a relationship are two different\nthings now let just check in with chat\noh my God there's so many messages holy\nJesus\num do people oh my God okay hold slow\nslow slow slow slow oh my God I can't\ntell is this just no this is constantly\nokay\num okay okay okay cursed Jesus okay all\nright okay okay slow slow it down so you\nguys I'm going to read chat I'm going to\ntry to read chat a little bit better\ninstead of ranting at y'all so I can\nrespond to questions okay so now there's\nlike two issues so now we're going to\nget to the how because this guy says\nRiz so I think we had a video recently\nabout the science of Charisma did we\nhave that did I make that am I just\nsmoking something in my\nbrain\nuh didn't we break down Charisma for\nyeah okay Charisma isn't yeah so we had\nwe have a video from four months\nago um where we talk about what Charisma\nis so like this is a super cool video if\nyall haven't checked it\nout we actually looked at like the\nscience of Charisma so what is charisma\nand it's not what people think it\nis okay so if youall want to I I won't\nrepeat everything there but like so for\nexample if you look at one uh example of\nsomething that people don't think of as\nCharisma having a vision for the future\nis\ncharisma so if you all like let's just\ntake this channel for example right so\nwould people describe me as charismatic\nsure the question is\nwhy right what makes me or anyone else\ncharismatic what Mak makes why is\ncharisma so important for politics why\nis charisma so important for\nleadership why it's because people want\na\nvision so in the dating world if you\nwant to have\nCharisma you need to have a vision for\nyour life right this is who I am this is\nwhere I'm going you can join me for this\njourney and that's like very attractive\nto people like just\nscientifically it's attractive having a\nvision for your life so this is why a\nlot of people will say in dating like\nwork on yourself and everyone's like I\ndon't want to work on myself I want to\nget\nlaid what does that mean so I I I I\ndon't think people understand the\nscience behind it right but there are\nenough people who struggled for a while\nand then devel they worked on themselves\nand they're like hey this worked for\nme so Charisma is a couple of different\nthings okay so like let's talk about\nCharisma for a second so you guys can\nwatch that video a vision is literally\nthe science of it correlates we've asked\npeople like there have been research\nstudies on you know which leaders are\nthe most charismatic or like if you rate\nthe CEO of your company like what\ncorrelates with them being charismatic\nit's having a vision so that's just one\nexample of one of the data points that\nactually correlates with Charisma and\nfor the the women in our\naudience and the men in our audience I\nwould hope and all the non-binary people\nI would hope that that resonates with\nyou right that like if you think about\nsomeone who's attractive like they know\nwhat they're doing in their life and so\nall of us clueless people in life we\nlike to latch on to people who know what\nthey're doing because we think if we\nhang out with people who have a [ __ ]\nclue what they're doing with their life\nmaybe that some of that'll rub off on me\nit's very attractive right I don't mean\njust mean sexually I mean like we\ngravitate towards people who pretend\nthat they have a clue as to what's going\non in life and they show up on places\nlike the internet and they offer such\nexpounding advice citing literature but\nnever showing y'all a bibliography and\nsince they seem so confident and have a\nvision and they speak with such passion\nwe start to believe them and we gravit\ngravitate towards them and sometimes\nfour 4.9 th000 people show up and listen\nto crazy people like\nthis what Madness is\nthis okay so so next up let's understand\na little bit about how to talk to people\nbecause this person okay so so let's\nlet's go through a couple of other\npoints so here's the big problem with\nonline dating so if you look at the\nnature of how Human Relationships form\nthere is an organic to it so in order\nfor a human relationship to form there\nhas to be it can't be like intentionally\nformed like you don't like it's like\ntoday I'm going to Bar barue so I'm\ngoing to get everything ready and I'm\ngoing to show up and I'm going to start\nbarbecue and then I'm going to be done\nbarbecuing that's not how relationships\nwork you can't show up and say today you\nand I are going to start dating and a\nmonth from now we're going to do this\nand a six month from now we're going to\ndo this and a year from now we're going\nto get married and then we're going to\nhave kids and then we're going to you\ncan't do that in dating some people try\nit actually works for some people\ngenerally speaking it doesn't work well\nHuman Relationships form\norganically they can't be formed with\nintention from the get-go or even if I\nmean you can have intention but that's\ngenerally speaking not how they form so\nwhen this person says you should go out\ntwo times a week I think about\nrelationships like loot boxes it's RNG\nyou have to just open enough chests\nuntil you find a relationship so you\nwant to create opportunities for organic\ninteraction this is why there's so much\nlike emphasis on hobbies and interests\ngo somewhere don't be obsessed with a\nrelationship and give yourself an\nopportunity to have a relationship\nBlossom Okay and like that's just kind\nof how it works because when when human\nbeings are under pressure they don't\nfeel relaxed duh and when we sort of\nforce a relationship there isn't like a\nit like it it runs contrary to the way\nthat our relationships form in our brain\nthere are some cases that are like exact\nopposites of\nthis so a good example of this is\narranged marriage so arranged marriage\nis a situ sitation where like you get\nmarried and like you know some of my\nfriends parents met their spouses like a\nweek before their\nwedding now even if you look at those\narranged marriages what we see is a\nsociety that offers enough structure in\nsupport for the lack of the organic\nrelationship to happen and then what\nhappens in arranged marriage is the\nmarriage comes first you're married but\nyou don't have a relationship with this\nperson and then overtime an organic\nrelationship forms and it's kind of\nweird because even if you look at\narranged marriage like it's quite\norganic and the reason why is because\nthe decision has been made there's no\nthere's no choice anymore right there's\nno pressure the pressure is gone it's\ndone you're finished GG you're\nmarried deal with it and so then an\norganic relationship starts to\nform so if we want organic relation with\nrelationships form in organic\ncircumstances and if we want organic\nrelation organic circumstances then we\nneed to just go and put ourselves out\nthere right so that means\ngo to places and do things where there\nare other\nhumans now we get to Charisma right so\nwe have a a study I mean we have a a\nvideo about what Charisma actually is\nfrom a scientific perspective it's very\nsurprising we talked about that so now\nwe're going to talk about the more\nclassic\nCharisma so there a couple of things\nthat I find are very very if we break\ndown the science of how to talk to\npeople and flirting there are a couple\nof things that we need to\nlearn so one here the key points if you\nstruggle with social interaction and you\nwant to get good at it there are a\ncouple of things to understand the first\nis that practice makes perfect okay so\nthe more that you interact with people\nthe better off you will be the second\nthing I'm going to show you all a\nstudy uh which oh\nboy\nokay give me a second chat let me find\nthis\nis this the\none give me a second\nchat nope not this one hold on hold on\nhold on hold I'm going to need a sec\nchat not this not this not this\nthis is the only one that's\nleft yes hold\non uh give me a second chat sorry I\nshould have pulled this up early I\nwasn't planning on pulling this up here\nI can screen share this with y'all as I\nlook through it so you guys can follow\nalong at least okay so this is a paper\ncalled the promoting effect of mental\nhealth education on student social adapt\nadaptability\num let's take a quick look at what leads\nto social I'm basically looking for one\npiece of data in here I don't think it's\ngot to be this one relationship specific\nand relationship independent behavioral\nadaptivity in affiliation and bonding a\nmulti- adaptive dynamical systems\napproach\nuh yes\nokay so this is one of those scientific\npapers that uses such big words that\nit's not clear whether they're actually\nbull bullshitting us or not so like I\nlove this sentence we analyze\ncomputationally how an interplay of\nadaptive relation specific and relation\nindependent mechanisms occurs within the\ncausal Pathways for social interaction\nas part of this obviously we cover also\nthe context sensitive control of these\ntypes of adapt ation adaptive speeds and\nstrengths of adaptation which is\nsometimes termed higher order adaptation\nor\nmetaplasticity metaplasticity is our\nword for the day here is the key thing\nthat we want to understand okay so the\noutcome of the analysis forget about\nthis shows a strong dependence of\nadaptation on the extent of social\ninteraction more social interaction\nleads to more adaptation of the\ninteraction Behavior\nso this is a very fancy paper that has\n[ __ ] like\nthis like what is this like what\nwhat\nwhat what what\nwhat this is the science of behavior in\nSocial connection chat I don't think\nthese people on Tik Tok are reading this\nokay but here's the crazy thing let me\nsee if I can find this at the\nend oh God here we\ngo\num okay we're gonna I don't know where\nthis is so we're just going to go back\nto the sentence I'll tell youall what\nthis means okay so this is a\npaper that's looking\nat it's a cool paper so this is what the\npaper's looking at so if I take a human\nbeing and I have them interact with\nanother human being do they adapt\nsocially to the person that they're\ninteracting with and furthermore how\nmuch of the adaptation with so let's say\nlike I'm me and I'm interacting with\nperson a I adapt to person a but how\nmuch does that adaptation help me with\nperson B and person C and person D and\nperson e so this is a meta level this is\na second order adaptation and social\nkind of improvement okay does that kind\nof make sense that's what the paper's\nlooking at here's what they discovered\nthe more you socialize the better you\nget\nsocially right this is like this is what\ntheir answer\nis so not only do you get better at\ndealing with person a but you also get\nde better at dealing with persons B C D\nor E this is like five head stuff but\nthese papers are very important okay I\nknow everyone's like duh yeah duh so\nit's good to know but there's some\nnuances to the the paper that are that\nare good and sometimes we do studies\nlike this and we discover the opposite\nlike that focus group is a good example\nwhere we assume that if you say you're\ngoing to do something you're going to do\nit but we all [ __ ] know that's not\ntrue right\nso interact with people twice a week we\nneed to\ndecrease our social anxiety part of the\nway that we do that part of the way we\nget good at dealing with people is just\nby dealing with people and this is where\na lot of people are like Dr K I don't\nknow how to interact with someone so now\nwe get to the the applicable part of it\nyou don't need to know how to interact\nwith someone this is the biggest mistake\npeople make people who are socially\nanxious and have an atrophy of social\nskills because we exist on the internet\nthink that I need to learn how to\nsocialize before I go out no you don't\nall you need to do is tolerate your\nfeelings of social incompetence that is\nthe only thing that you need to do the\ncool thing is that literally your brain\nwill do the\nrest your brain will do the rest so our\nbrain is so amazing it is so\nneuroplastic it is an instinct to\nsocialize children are never taught how\nto socialize there are shortcomings in\nsocialization if you don't have the\nright social environment so that that's\nthere but generally speaking it's not\nlike we have formal classes we teach\nkids\nmathematics we teach them how to hold\nobjects we don't formally teach them how\nto socialize because our brain is wired\nfor it so everyone thinks I need to\nfigure out socialization I need to know\nwhat the pieces of Charisma are so I can\nstart practicing them in private and I\ncan show up a rised out whatever you\njust need to show up the brain will take\nover the problem is that we we have a\nshortcoming in distress tolerance we\ncannot tolerate feeling socially\nincompetent that's the problem so if you\njust show up with and you interact with\npeople the more you interact with people\nthe more that your brain will drust\nokay that's number one so we're going to\ngive you all a couple of tips about how\nto interact with people and specifically\nlike what does that mean to be rised so\none is I do think it's important to have\nsome vision of your life right have a\nvision of yourself and a vision of your\nlife this people will be attracted to\nnumber one second thing is I think a lot\nof people need to get better at\nambiguity so flirtation is about\nambiguity okay so like the whole point\nthe thing that's exciting about\nflirtation is no one knows what you mean\nyou know like that's I I'm trying to\nthink of a good example but like if we\nlook at flirtation it's\nlike hey are you the guy that's going to\npump my tires are you are you here to\npump my tires oh yeah I'm here to pump\nyour tires right you can say whatever\nthe [ __ ] you want it doesn't matter it's\nit's like some amount of like I can't\ncome up this is this is a fail on my\npart cuz I I was like like that's where\nit is like it's all about ambiguity but\nthe problem is that when we're we're\nsocially\nanxious we become uncomfortable with\nambiguity because we don't know does\nthis person like me or not like me when\nwe're socially anxious ambiguity gets\nturned into negative so we can't float\nin the ambiguous\nspace and this is why like everyone have\nwants to have a DTR conversation to find\nthe relationship what is this is this\nlove is this marriage where are we going\nand the only reason you have that in\norder to get to that Define the\nrelationship conversation there needs to\nbe a hell of a lot of ambiguity\nbefore I don't know what this is\nexactly that is the foundation of RZ is\nambiguity in a\nrelationship now remember that's phase\none where this is like attracting\nsomeone then you have to define the\nrelationship you have to survive phase\ntwo it's like these bosses where it's\nlike phase one is like this move set\nand you're like I just figured this out\nI just figured out how to attract PE\npeople and suddenly the boss is like\nhahaa you thought I was a snail turns\nout I'm a dragon and now I'm flying and\nbreathing fire at you and you're like I\nwasn't prepared for this this is why you\nend up with people who can date very\neasily but can't get can't settle down I\nhave a fear and we just call it fear of\ncommitment it's not fear of commitment\nthis is a phase change for a boss and\nyou learned this one script you don't\nrealize that there's a whole second\nscript and then they break up with this\nperson Things Fall Apart and they date\nsomeone new so it's like okay I wiped on\nphase number two so let me just go back\nand do phase number one again let me do\nphase number one again let me do phase\nnumber one again let me do phase number\none again and this is what happens in\ndating some people are really good at da\ngetting dates and really bad at settling\ndown especially the\nalphas right and then some people are\nactually pretty good at phase two\nand they're like I'm a loving caring\nperson but you don't know how to deal\nwith phase one paradoxically you can do\nthe hard stuff but it's the phase one\nit's fighting the snail and it's like\nyeah I don't I don't know like my\nmonitor is busted and the snail leaves\nthis like poison trail and I don't I\ndon't know how to avoid the poison you\nknow I auto attack them and it bounces\noff and I get stunned because it has the\nsnail shell like whatever so these are\ntwo separate phases okay phase one is a\nlot about ambiguity phase two is sure\nwhen he says maintenance this is about\nshared goals all that kind of stuff so\nif you guys want to like learn how to\nhave Riz like learn how to be ambiguous\nhave a vision for your life that speaks\nto\nconfidence the next thing that's really\nimportant is like\ndon't this one's kind of tricky don't\nhave a whole lot of\nexpectations so this is like sort of a\nmixed bag actually I'm going to stop\nthat I'm we're going to stop there we're\ngoing to just move on to the next thing\nI feel like I've ranted\nenough so when someone says damn not\ngood at either right so that that's\nwhere like that could be true I'm not\ndisagreeing with\nyou but I also think that\nlike many people who I know the majority\nof people who I know misunderestimate\nhow bad they are at\nthings so if we look at like Dunning\nKrueger right so remember Dunning\nKrueger is this idea that the worse you\nare at something the poorer judge you\nare which makes sense so like we'll have\nall these like you know you last like\ndudes if you were in a fight with a\ncrocodile like who would win could you\ntake on a Silverback Gorilla could you\ntake on a grizzly bear and you'll have\ndudes be like yeah like I'm stronger\nthan grizzly bear blah blah blah blah\nblah blah blah\nokay and so we people do this right and\nthen there's also like take your\nfavorite video game with online\nmultiplayer and people telling you that\nyou're bad and you need to uninstall\nDunning Krueger so the other really\ninteresting thing is that Dunning\nKrueger applies to negativity as well\nthis is what a lot of people don't\nrealize everyone thinks that Dunning\nKrueger means that I overestimate my\nskill it just means that the poorer you\nunderstand something the more you\nmisestimate your skill which direction\nyou estimate on depends on your ego so a\nlot of people say I am bad at dot dot\ndot that is such a definitive statement\nthat comes from you I don't know if it\ncomes from your circumstances and then\npeople will say but Dr K I have all of\nthis evidence and that's where it's like\nI hate to break it to you but if you\nhave one traumatic experience your brain\nwill go back and rewrite all of your\nprevious experiences to be\nworse this is crazy people don't know\nthis that your brain goes back and\nretcons your life all the time the more\ntrauma you experience the more retcon\nyour life becomes and then people look\nback and they say this is my life no it\nisn't\nand now in the world that we live in\nwe're not allowed to say that we're not\nallowed to say if you feel this way\nyou're\nwrong your feelings are valid but your\ninterpretation of reality is not you\nknow there's like studies on this stuff\nokay traumatic effects on\nmemory I forget who's\num there's a great researcher who talks\na lot about this but I'm blanking on\ntheir\nname okay so this is where like and they\nall are saying like Okay but then then\nwhat do I do\nFair good question I'm like you're wrong\nat this chat you're wrong you're wrong\nyou're bad you're bad you're wrong at\nthis you're wrong at this you don't\nunderstand this there's Dr K treating\nyou like\ncrap take a deep breath take a step back\nhere's what y'all need to do first of\nall recognize that you are a human being\nyou are adaptable you are neuroplastic\nyour past does not determine your future\nyou can change that's the main takeaway\ngive it a shot\nrecognize it's going to be tough don't\ngive up\nokay all right let's look at the next\none all right yes you're\nplastic not like the substance like the\nbrain all\nright let's do this one met in real life\nand dated who I know I would have swiped\nleft on and said no to on a dating app\nlet's talk about it this is why I think\nit's really important if you're looking\nto go on more dates if you're looking to\nmeet more people to not just rely on\ndating apps because if you're just on\ndating apps all someone gets is a couple\nof photos of you and some prompts that\nmaybe do or don't give a good depiction\nof who you are and that's it I think the\nbest thing you can do if you're single\nand you're looking to go on more dates\nregardless of your gender is to put\nyourself out there in social situations\nthat are in line with your values\nhobbies and interest and talk to as many\npeople as possible personally I use this\nexample a lot but when I do not have a\npartially torn ACL I love pickle ball so\nI will go to tons of pickle ball social\nmixers and events and I'll just talk to\nanyone regardless of gender because I\nmeet a nice girl who has a friend who\nhas a friend whose guy friend is single\nwho is looking to be set up like you\njust never know so it's not about going\nto an event and saying I'm going to meet\nas many single people as possible and\ngive out my number it's literally just\nI'm going to socialize with people I'm G\nto put it out there that I'm single and\nI'm gonna see what happens a perfect\nexample the other day I met a friend of\na friend and they met at a networking\nevent and I was chatting with her and\ninstantly I was like oh my God I know a\nguy friend of mine who I'd love to set\nyou up with if you're single I think you\nguys would get along so well she's\nsingle I set them up that's why I think\nit's so important to just put out\nfeelers touch points meet people put\nyourself out there not even in the sense\nof oh I'm going to go to this event and\nmeet the love of my life but just I'm\ngoing to connect with people and I'm\ngoing to see what happens also if you\ndon't know me my name is Danny I post\ndating in relationship advice and\nstories and don't forget to to follow me\nokay so there's some things I love about\nthat some things not a huge fan of so\nthe first thing is like I'm still a\nlittle bit confused about can we get\ndating advice from like normal looking\npeople at some\npoint cuz like here's here's the problem\nhere's my problem with dating advice on\nthe\nInternet it's all like really attractive\npeople and I feel like they're playing a\ndifferent game from the rest of\nus and I kind of get what she's saying\nbecause if you know I I imagine if I saw\nher on a dating app I would may I may\nswipe right but hearing her talk about\nsome random story about how someone met\nat a networking event I was like this is\nboring I'm done right so it kind of goes\nboth\nways so and yet we just cited research\nthat this person is correct right so\nthis is where like like you know like\nyeah let's get normal looking people\ndating advice you know what I\nmean um so so but this person's not\nwrong right we just cited literature\nthat shows that she is correct so the\nfirst thing is that like we talked about\nthere's a difference between\norganic interactions and like the\nselectivity of a dating app the other\nthing about a dating app is that if you\nswipe left on someone you just have\nanother option right so this is why\ndating apps are so brutal because it's\nlike your number of options is infinite\nso if you're not happy with this one oh\nhow much effort does it take to get\nanother option\noh my God it's just a you have to flick\nyour\nfinger got to flick it that's you got to\nflick it sorry I know it's a lot of work\nto move on to the next person but you\ngot to flick it so if you're on a dating\napp you're not competing against other\nguys or girls you're not competing\nagainst other people what you're\nactually competing against is whether\nsomeone likes you more than\nflicking that's all you're competing\nagainst right so the option for the next\nthing to come around is very very very\nlow right and people have talked about\nthis so the good thing about in-person\ninteractions is it's not like I can walk\nup to you and be like I'm tired of\ntalking to\nyou and then poof there's another human\nbeing you're relatively stuck with my\ndumb ass for some amount of time until\nyou can extract\nyourself and this is like a completely\ndifferent thing right so this is the way\nthat human beings form relationships\nit's far more\norganic and this is where like a lot of\npeople think like oh my God I should go\ninto this and like I'm trying to talk to\npeople and people say you know don't\ndon't like uh I don't even know what I'm\nsaying anymore chat Jesus just had a\nbrain fart G to have my smoothie and\njust recollect for a second\nall right what the hell am I saying who\nknows I'm working myself up just saying\nstupid things and once again huge\nrespect to all the content creators who\nare making this\ncontent but but this person is right\nokay so let's like go back over those\nprinciples\nso one thing is that dating apps are\nvery very selective and so if you're\nphysically attractive you'll do better\nthere because those are primarily based\non physical attractiveness right they're\nbased on like the pictures more than\nanything else like I mean you can write\nwhatever wall of text you want in your\nbio but mainly it's pictures that's what\npeople make their selections based on so\nwhen you reduce yourself to a picture\nhow well do you compete and this is why\nlike everyone's like oh like all the\nnice guys are like all the [ __ ] end\nup on dates like no one likes nice guys\nand their perception is because they're\nbasing things on dating apps where they\nsee Attractive people get lots of\nmatches it's like yeah like I mean if\nyou you know if you measure quality by\nhow good you are at playing mid in\nLeague of Legends or Dota 2 you're going\nto get a very significant slice of the\npopulation if we replaced all pictures\non dating apps with your rank in your\ngame of choice dating apps would select\nfor a completely different thing dating\napps select on\npictures and so if you are advantageous\nin pictures then you will have an\nadvantage and if you are not advant\nvantageous on pictures you will have a\ndisadvantage AR go this person's advice\nwhich I think is good advice which is\nput yourself out there right keep your\npants on go and create opportunities for\npeople to get other kinds of information\nabout you now I don't know if yall were\nhere let's look at one other thing real\nquick so we're going to look at another\nquick piece of\ndata this is really\nimportant we already looked at this on\nWednesday but if y'all weren't here\nwe're going to pull this up cuz this is\nlike a great study here it is so this is\na study about bald dudes right so let's\ntake a quick look at like physical\nattractiveness so the key thing is if we\nlook at people who are bald they get so\nhere's the non-bal target so we're\ncomparing pictures we're comparing\npeople who are not bald to people who\nare bald and what we find is in physical\nattractiveness people who are not bald\nare more attractive than people who are\nbald and then what we also find is that\nbald people don't have pretty privilege\nthere's something called pretty\nprivilege which is that if you're\nattractive physically attractive people\nwill think that you are more likable\nmore kind more competent more good more\nintelligent so we see this as well that\nif you ask people questions about\nnon-bal versus bald people the non-bal\npeople win except if you add something\ncalled individuating\ninformation so we have stereo ypes of\npeople and the cool thing is that when\nwe judge someone based on their\nstereotype it's just the stereotype but\nwhen you add individual information when\nyou make someone more human instead of\njust a\nstereotype then the non-bal people I\nmean the bald people actually come out\non top in terms of how much would you\nlike to spend time with this person do\nyou think this person is cool not their\nphysical attractiveness they're still\nlosing on physical attractiveness but we\ndo see a nonsignificant statistically\nbut we actually see a bump in their\nphysical attractiveness too you guys\nnotice that it's not statistically\nsignificant because the error bars\noverlap but it's there or it could be an\nerror is what it means but we absolutely\nsee a big\ndifference in do I like this person or\nnot because there are actually\nstereotypes for Attractive people too\nwhich we often times don't think about\nright Attractive people are Playboys\nAttractive people are [ __ ]\nAttractive people will dump me at the\nfirst sign of whatever so it turns out\nthat as you add individuating\ninformation as you add\npersonality to yourself right through\ninteractions people will actually judge\nyou better and the more physically\nunattractive you are if we extrapolate\nthis out the more you have to gain by\nmaking yourself an\nindividual so this is the point of\nputting yourself out there understand\nthe mechanisms at play cuz here's the\nproblem with putting yourself out there\nI say hey guys hey ladies put yourself\nout there and this person on Tik Tok who\nI'm sure is quite competent and has her\nheart in the right place and offers good\nadvice is like just put yourself out\nthere just hate that\nword and she's\nright the problem is that until we\nunderstand what's the point of putting\noursel out there it becomes very hard to\ndo now this is important to\nunderstand see our brain makes something\ncalled an action success\ncalculation so what it does is anytime\nit looks at a particular\naction it\nhas an idea of what the benefit will be\nand it has an idea of what the cost will\nbe and if the benefit is worth the cost\nwe will stay motivated in doing\nit the problem with all this advice to\npeople who give us this idea of just put\nyourself out there is our brain does not\nknow how to calculate the benefit of\njust putting yourself out there so this\nis literally what your brain does and\nyou all may have noticed this your brain\nwill be like how much do I put myself\nout there how long do I put myself out\nthere what does putting myself out there\nmean does that mean that I have to go\nthrough one grueling single speed dating\nnight or 15 what is the\nduration what is the frequency what is\nthe\nintensity and then what happens is as\nyou put yourself out there you don't\nhave a good idea of any of those answers\nand what happens is you pay a high cost\nbecause putting yourself out there is\nnot easy it's\npainful so now what happens our brain\ndoesn't\nknow what to expect when and all it sees\nis a cost and this is kind of like if I\ntell you like hey man give me some money\nand good things will happen to you\nand you're like okay here's $100 when\nwill the good things happen I don't know\ngive me more money you're like all right\nhere's another 100\nbucks and you're like when does this\nwhen do things turn around just give me\nmore money just pay keep paying costs I\ndon't know when the benefit will happen\nI don't know the intensity I don't know\nthe duration all I know is that people\nwho give me money tend to do better just\nhave faith give me more money pay pay a\nhigher cost pay higher cost pay a higher\ncost so really good example of this is\ngardening\nso if we look at gardening got to till\nthe soil got to build this raised bed\ngot to order some seeds got to put them\nin this thing got to put them in that\nthing then I got to water them every day\nand gardening why do people Garden\nbecause they know they have an expected\ngain hey when this rolls around I grew\npeas a couple years ago oh my God it was\namazing the peas were so good you can't\nfind these in a grocery store fresh peas\nso sweet you have to know when the\nbenefit will come in order to tolerate\nthe cost the problem with just put\nyourself out there is doesn't give your\nbrain any kind of idea of like how much\nam I going to pay before this pays off\nbecoming a doctor is the same going to\nmed school is like you start when you're\nlike\n17 and then you finish when you're like\n30 so for 13 years paying a high cost\npaying a high cost paying a high cost\nbecause you know that there's a payoff\nat the end the problem with just put out\nthere is what's the payoff when does it\nhappen who the hell knows you just got\nto keep trying bro just keep trying no\ndoesn't\nwork recognize this shortcoming in\nyourself recognize that putting yourself\nout there is not a solution to to\nanything it is but in your mind you\ncan't think of it that way because if\nyou think if I put myself out there then\nthings will happen but if you expect\nthings to happen your brain will say hey\nit's not happening let's stop and that's\nwhat happens with people who put\nthemselves out there they work up the\ncourage for a couple of months and then\nthey put themselves out there and then\nthey get smacked and then they go they\nRetreat and then the cycle\nrepeats see when you're putting yourself\nout there is an avoidance of loneliness\nthis does not\nwork some people will try to socialize\nbecause they are so lonely and they\nthink that loneliness is is such a it's\nsuch a powerful negative motivator but\nhere's the key thing to understand if\nyou are motivated by your negative\nemotions let's say my loneliness builds\nup now what's prompting me is negative\nemotion right that's what's forcing me\nto act so as the loneliness builds up I\nsocialize and then once I start\nsocializing the loneliness goes down and\nthe social anxiety goes up and what's\ndictating my actions is negative emotion\nso loneliness over here I end up\nsocializing as I socialize social\nanxiety increases loneliness goes down\nand what am I being dictated by\nmy negative emotion so now social\nanxiety is high well let's go back\ninside this is\npainful so you have to understand that\nputting yourself out there is a very\nhigh cost it's like gardening and there\nwill be payoffs right what are the\npayoffs it's the that paper that I\nshowed where more social interaction you\ndon't have to make things work with this\nperson this is very important to\nunderstand there is a\nmetaplasticity every time you socialize\nwith someone I don't care how painful it\nis I don't care how bad your\nrelationship is you get better at the\nnext\none that's what's cool it's how our\nbrain is\ndesigned so by all means put yourself\nout there but recognize that it's going\nto suck for some amount of time how long\nI don't know practically I'd say that\npeople who consistently socialize for a\nperiod of 6 months will be in a\nsignificantly better place this is Dr K\npulling a number out of my butt but I'd\nsay you will be 40% better in 6 months\nnow what's going to happen is an army of\npeople is going to respond to me and be\nlike no I've been doing this for 6\nmonths I'm not significantly better\nwe'll get to that one day where I'm\nmaking a video about\nit only 40% you're damn right only 40%\nnow let's understand why Dr K is saying\n40% I'm definitely going to pick a\nnumber that's under 50 why who can\nfigure out why I won't say 50% or 60%\neven if I believe it why am I saying 40%\nH hedging your bets won't try very good\nthe main thing is if I tell you it's\nyou're going to be 75% better one month\nin you're like I'm not on track for 75%\nand you're going to\nquit low expectations y'all see this is\nthe problem is we all think oh my God I\nthink so lowly of myself you're damn\nright you\nshould don't expect a whole lot of\nyourself and you will be pleased it's\nokay to be a loser it's all right you\ndon't you're not I was about to say you\ndon't deserve better that's not true\ndon't expect a whole lot and just do it\nanyway right set low\nexpectations and you have a chance to be\nimpressed you have a chance to be\npleasantly\nsurprised but if you set high\nexpectations your mind will sabotage you\nI was told so I unfortunately this\nhappens to me as a\nclinician where I developed a little bit\nof a reputation and boy did that screw\nme and everyone else\ninvolved so I had a patient once come\ninto my office that said hey I heard\nyou're the psychiatrist that people go\nto when all the other psychiatrists have\nfailed I was like\n[ __ ] GG now the expectations are high\nnow someone is expecting a miracle and I\nwas like you must have the wrong person\nbye right doesn't\nwork so expect\nless okay it's a good thing swipe\nleft\nbrilliant oh no Dr K has white hair\nyou're damn right it's going to go white\nfirst and then it's going to start\nfalling out chat mark my words it's\ngoing to happen to me\ntoo\nokay okay now we're getting to good\nquestions so Ken is asking but shouldn't\nI believe that I deserve better having\nexpectations because I value myself no\nI'm going to be straight with y'all I\ndon't think\nso so I mean I say this like this is\nlike maybe you know people will take\nissue with this which is fair enough so\nif you all disagree with what I say and\nyou think that it's it's\nincorrect please criticize and let me\nknow\notherwise so there's a lot of nuance to\nwhat I'm going to\nsay so a lot of people will think to\nthemselves and they'll try to tell each\nother you know you deserve better and\nI'll say that and I believe that at\ntimes but being a medical doctor like I\ndon't know where this idea of deserve\ncomes from like to be completely honest\nwith\ny'all I've\nseen amazing human beings who do not\ndeserve to have brain tumors get brain\ntumors like it's\ncrazy I've seen people who make bad\nmistake after bad mistake after bad\nmistake will steal people's money will\ninject using IV drugs will inject so\nthat they have a an infection in their\nheart muscle because they're using dirty\nneedles they steal\nstuff I've seen someone get electrocuted\nby lightning and survive all kinds of\nstuff and then end up using drugs to the\npoint where they basically kill\nthemselves I don't know about\ndeserving like it just doesn't make\nsense to me like sure we can talk about\nKarma and all that stuff and I think all\nthat stuff makes\nsense but we have this idea that I\ndeserve\nbetter I I I don't know that you do I\nsay that to\npeople now we all have to be careful\nokay so when I make a statement like\nthis the Temptation is going to be to\nassume I'm saying additional\nthings but I I don't know where we get\nthis idea of what we deserve I I I I I\ndon't know I I'm genuinely like I don't\nget it like I don't understand I don't I\ncan't reconcile the things that I've as\na medical professional with the concept\nof deserve because what I see in this\nworld is that good things happen to\npeople who make bad decisions and bad\nthings happen to people who make good\ndecisions I've seen people who eat super\nhealthy keto diet vegan [ __ ] get\nbrain tumors at the age of like 36 and\nhave four months to live like\nI I don't\nknow and I've seen people who are\nabusive and find Partners to abuse\nrelationship after relationship after\nrelationship I don't\nknow so should you have expectations\ngenerally speaking I think in life the\nmore you lower your expectations the\nbetter off you will\nbe now there's one last Point here which\nthis person says I should value myself\nno that you should absolutely\ndo but valuing and deserving are two\ndifferent things if you're you should\nabsolutely value yourself absolutely Ely\nVal understand that you have intrinsic\nvalue as a human\nbeing and on some level you absolutely\ndeserve happiness completely agree and I\nknow I just said you shouldn't I don't\nknow about deserving I recognize the\ncontradiction so please try to\nunderstand I don't even know if I\nunderstand 100% but I'm kind of working\nmyself\nthere see when you value yourself I\ndon't know that the world because here's\nthe thing deserve comes from the outside\nright deserve is about what you\nget or what you should get that's the\nthing I don't know what the world owes\nyou but deserve and value are completely\nseparate in mind my mind and value and\nexpectation or completely separate in my\nmind too do you have value 100% do you\nhave immense value 100% you should treat\nyourself that\nway but you should also understand that\nthe world may not see your\nvalue and that's okay and the whole\npoint like the way that you should live\nyour life is if someone does not see\nyour value you can move\non because people will say I deserve\nbetter I don't know that you do but if\nyou are not happy with what you are\ngetting then by all means move on\nthere's a Nuance here which is very\nimportant doesn't mean be a doormat\ndoesn't mean do what other people tell\nyou to do it doesn't mean stay in\nunhealthy relationships it means\nrecognize your intrinsic value and\nrecognize that if some if this is not\nright for you it's not right for you you\ndon't need to deserve better that's the\nkey thing the action doesn't come out of\na\ndeserving the action comes out of a\nvalue the action comes out of a choice\nthe action comes out of rolling the\ndice that's where I think you should\noperate\nfrom I think generally speaking human\nbeings deserve happiness all human\nbeings deserve happiness I believe it\nbut I think the world doesn't give a\n[ __ ] what I believe\nbluntly and so how do we reconcile these\ntwo things you just do the best that you\ncan recognize that you have value\nrecognize that your value is intrinsic\nrecognize that your value is not\ndetermined by the number of left swipes\nyou get on a dating\napp see when we don't see our internal\nvalue we use external measures for our\ninternal value\nwhen I don't feel good about myself I\nneed to be at the top of the class when\nI am insecure about my appearance I need\nto be the prettiest princess in the room\nmirror mirror on the wall who's the\nprettiest one of all this is born of\ninsecurity deser deserving doesn't enter\ninto any of\nthis so focus on the internal focus on\nfixing the\ninsecurity not what you\ndeserve I do believe you deserve\nhappiness but the I don't I think that\nthe key thing is that the happiness that\nyou are entitled to in this life doesn't\ncome from the world this is the huge\nmistake that people make it comes from\nin\nhere cuz you can't expect something of\nthe world like I just don't know I mean\nmaybe someone has an answer that I don't\nunderstand I have answers too I just\ndon't I'm not going to go into them now\nabout Karma and things like that I think\nit's a good\nexplanation but it's not doesn't have\nutility\nhere does that make\nsense these are beautiful comments by\nthe way I hope yall are having fun I'm\nhaving a\nblast so you know one thing that I just\nwant to mention real quick is this idea\nof like what your intrinsic value is and\nunderstanding you know your relationship\nwith the world and stuff like\nthis see the biggest problem that we\nhave is that we often times operate\nwithin\nourselves so if you really look at like\nyour day-to-day\nlife like you're talking to your mind\nmost of the time your mind is forming\nall these conclusions and this becomes\nthe world that you live in so one of the\nthings that like this is where I really\nthink group coaching is Fant\nfantastic so the whole reason it's kind\nof weird because people don't like\nreally know what group coaching is we\nhave a difficult time explaining what it\nis it has immense value it's my\npersonally it's my favorite thing to do\nas a clinician and a coach I love group\nwork we've had some streams where we\nsort of do some some group stuff and\nlike real transformation happens in\ngroup settings and the beautiful thing\nabout group is that see anytime I work\nwith someone individually like there's\nthis thought in the person that's back\nof their mind that like I'm paying you\nto be my cheerleader but in a group of\nyour peers it's different that's why\nthere's like data that shows that\npeer peer respect is worth more than\neven your boss's respect or Superior\nrespect if you look at\nprogrammers the respect that matters the\nmost to programmers is the respect of\ntheir peers not their\nsuperiors so like if you're stuck in\nyour life and you need to look at your\nlife from the outside especially when it\ncomes to\nrelationships because what happens in\ngroup is we we there's a certain set of\nrules that yall follow and the rules\ninvolve learning how to listen learning\nhow to talk learning how to claim space\nin a conversation learning how to give\nup space in a\nconversation I don't know if that makes\nsense to you'all but all of these things\nI I see people sort of saying I don't\nknow how to\nsocialize um\nright so like there's someone saying I'm\na woman trying to get into a Rel my\nfirst relationship I hear so many guys\nonline saying that women get it easy but\nI've had no luck I've done dating app\nsocialize and I've even asked guys out I\ndon't even get The Unwanted attention in\nreal life or online that almost all\nwomen I know have said they've\nexperienced I guess I should be grateful\nfor those things don't happen to me am I\njust ugly what am I doing wrong should I\nlower my expectations or just end up\nbeing to being alone this is what I'm\ntalking about like I think that this is\nwhere like in group work yall will\ninteract with each other people will get\nto know you and this is very important\nthere's no dating in group right so the\nthe other beautiful thing about group\nthe problem with other social\ninteractions is that there is a\nprice you all get what I mean every\nsocial interaction comes at a cost\nthere's some kind of Association there's\nsome kind of respect you can't be\nauthentic with people because of what\nthey'll think because of what your boss\nthinks because of what your girlfriend\nthinks because this person may not ever\ndate you because this person may crap\ntalk you behind your back because this\nperson is part of your friend Circle\nbecause this person is part of your D\nand group so you can never be authentic\nwith someone so you can't explore these\nissues\nobjectively so that's that's why like we\nstill do this group thing even though\nlike personal coaching has been full for\ntwo\nyears and like group is just beautiful\nlike it's hard to describe what the\nvalue is it's one of these things where\nyou don't quite it's like\ngardening but a lot of this social stuff\nthis identity stuff that's what people\nreally work on and if you guys watched\nour group streams that happened like\nover a year ago you'll see the change\nright it's about other people reflecting\non you that someone can't do like a\nprofessional can't do for you it has to\nbe your\npeers right they have to tell you hey I\nstruggle in this way too or whatever and\nthere's a trained facilitator right\nsomeone who has is a certified\nfacilitator who knows how to bring this\nstuff out in the right way\nand it works incredibly\nwell but what does it do I don't\nknow your mileage may vary your mileage\n100% will vary different people get\ndifferent things that's the value of it\nis that it helps us grow in the\ndimensions that we are not necessarily\naware that we need\ngrowth okay let's move\non did this one\nI've never been rejected asking a girl\non hold\non let's go\nhere I've never been rejected asking a\ngirl on a date ever in my life and uh\nit's not being sexy it's called using\npsychology what most guys do when asking\nis give off this Vibe would you like to\ntake my hands in a date please let me\ntake you out bro that's lame as it's\nboring women are triggered by emotion so\nyou want her to feel something here we\nwant the idea of a date with us to seem\nexciting to her so instead of that\napproach more so say hey I'm doing blank\non Saturday you want to come with me I\nwas thinking of trying this new spot\nnext week do you want to join me see\nthis right here is an opportunity to\nexperience something with you not join\nyou on a date it's a small shift in\nwords big\ndifference so\nI have so many questions about\nthis this person says they've never been\nrejected small shift in words and it's\nnot because they're attractive so this\nis where the scientist in me\nwonders so when someone attributes\nsomething they say it's not because I'm\nattractive it's because of a small shift\nin words how do you know\nthat right CU like this is I think you\ngot to have a trial you got to have ugly\npeople do the same thing and if we take\n50 Attractive people and we take 50 ugly\npeople and they use\npsychology which aspect of psychology\nwhat do you mean psychology psychology\nof what what kind of\npsychology it's psychology bro okay fair\nenough see like this is where like I I I\nget so confused when I see this stuff\nbecause I'm like what is this person\nbasing this on it's not because you're\nattractive it's because of the way that\nI ask so that means one of two things\none is that this person has gotten some\nkind of data where they have their ugly\nfriend do the same thing and clearly\nthey have never been rejected as well\nright in order to make that statement\nyou have to have your control group and\nyou have to have your experimental\ngroup and then the second\nthing is that this person has said that\nthey've never been rejected so how do\nthey know that asking some out on a date\nand bringing that will you take my hand\non a date how do they know that that's\nnot\neffective that's what I'm so confused\nabout right does that make sense because\nif they've they've never failed did they\ntry the other way and they failed a lot\nso they had like a 0% success rate doing\nit the first rate and a 100% success\nrate doing it the other\nway and then the other thing that I'm\nsuper curious about is like when this\nperson\nasks right they're like hey I'm doing\nthis at a certain time like do you want\nto join\nme what if the person says I'm busy does\nthat count as a rejection or is no one\nbusy when it comes to the random happen\nstance of what this person is doing\nthat's so\ninteresting\nso I I I just get confused by this stuff\nlike I like I don't know I don't know\nwhen people make statements like this\nlike this is where like I get confused\nlike I don't know what like you know\nwhat I mean it sounds good by the way I\nI agree with this General sentiment\nso I think like you know telling people\nlike hey I have this interesting thing\ngoing on do you want to join me is it\nlike I'm all for inviting people to\nexciting things I think that's\ngood but I also think that there's\nthere's another step to this so two or\nthree\nthings so the first is I'm confused by\ntheir statistical\nanalysis okay I'm not saying I'm right\nI'm just saying I'm confused about what\ndata arrives at these conclusions\ncuz I am curious like if ugly people\ntried this me method would it work I\nthink it would be better than asking\npeople out on dates but then there's two\nthree other things that I want you all\nto seriously consider the first is\nwhat's wrong with\nrejection see I I I think the right way\nto date is to be okay with rejection I\nthink some of the worst problems I see\nin relationships and is when people are\nnot okay with rejection\nbecause when you're not okay with\nrejection you promise more than you can\ndeliver you bend over backward and\naccommodate more than you're willing to\nmore than you should I I should\nsay you set false expectations you\ndeceive I think rejection is a very\nimportant part of\ndating not something that you should shy\naway from in fact I would even Advocate\nthat you to offer yourself as you are\nand instead of trying to convince\nsomeone that you are something that you\nare not which is just going to end in\ndisappointment you just let people\nreject you now people will say like I\njust can't do that because it hurts fair\nenough it does hurt until you get used\nto it number one and secondly it only\nhurts as long as your value as a human\nbeing\nis tied to someone else's acceptance or\nrejection free yourself from the value\nof\nothers if someone wants to reject me so\nbe\nit this is what I'm\noffering so a couple years ago I applied\nto be chief resident in my\nresidency and chief resident is a\nprestigious position and furthermore at\nMassachusetts General Hospital in the\nHarvard Medical School it's like man's\ngreatest hospital that's what they call\nMGH and it's very competitive so you\ntake like the most competitive kids on\nthe planet you stick them in one place\nand then you create a position that is\nlike the leader it's like class\npresident kind of\nthing and so I applied for this thing\nand for a little while I was caught up\nin I was like I want to be Chief because\neverybody else wanted to be Chief I\ndidn't end up becoming Chief was\nfantastic worked out\ngreat but at some point I was like you\nknow this is what I'm going to do so\nduring my interview I just said hey if\nI'm Chief this is what I'm going to do\nif y'all want this pick\nme if you're not interested in this pick\nsomebody else love it love that\nattitude it's the attitude that I've\ntaken that's gotten me here here's what\nI have to give if you're interested take\nit if not totally\nfine my value does not depend on your\napproval\ndoes not dep depend upon this Laurel or\neven you going out with me on a date\nthis is what yall should achieve the big\nParadox is that when you achieve this\nyou will become more\nattractive people will be more\ninterested in\nyou right that's kind of like it's how\nit\nworks so I don't think that the goal\nshould be avoidance of rejection I think\nthe goal should be independence of\nrejection\nbecause this is the crazy thing people\ncan reject you for all kinds of reasons\nyou don't need to get caught like what\nthe [ __ ] just think about it for a\nsecond there are thousand reasons people\ncould reject you and you're going to tie\nyour\nselfworth up to the reasons that someone\nelse has including they're dating\nsomeone including they're not attracted\nto your gender including they're asexual\nincluding they don't like your haircut\nincluding they are quite materialistic\nand you don't meet the material\nstandards that they have you're going to\nlet yourself worth be tied to these\nthings now it's easy for me to say\nyou're going to do that because it's not\nlike we're taught anything else and if\nwe look at the neuros and psych\nneuroscience and psychology of social\nRejection it correlates with a drop in\nour self-esteem this happens during\npuberty\nespecially so the more hormonally active\nyou are the more sensitive you will\nbecome to social\nrejection so this is not what I'm saying\nis not easy\nbut it's worth\nit right and then people will ask how do\nI have a value that is independent of\nother\npeople short answer is spend time with\nyourself so the biggest thing that I\ngained in India was time with myself\ntime away from everyone's judgment and\nwhen the mind is constantly receiving\njudgment the mind will become sensitive\nto\njudgment right if I drink alcohol every\nday I will become dependent on alcohol\nwhen I'm a celebrity and people are\nconstantly talking about my weight and\nsnapping pictures of me and judging me\nbased on my appearance a celebrity isn't\nweak for being very concerned about\ntheir appearance Paparazzi will drive\npeople to the point of body dysmorphia\nthis isn't a weakness this is a natural\nconsequence so the way to get around it\nis to spend time with yourself\nso I went hiking when I was about 19\nyears old and I was hiking by myself and\nI saw a 10-ft boulder and I was like\nI'mma climb that thing and I\nfailed and then I came back a month\nlater and I was like I'm going to climb\nthat thing and I failed\nagain came back a third time I was able\nto climb it and I felt great and no one\nwas watching and no one\nknew the whole problem in our in our\nworld is that we celebrate our\nwins we show everyone else which\nreinforces the idea that other people's\napproval correlates with my happiness\nand my\nselfworth here we are talking about\nPaparazzi and body dysmorphia but we\nalso have circle jerk award\nceremonies right where we Elevate some\npeople above others based on some\nparticular outcome same thing all leads\nto\nEgo so value in the self comes by\nspending time with yourself value in the\nself comes from earning your own\nrespect that's what you should be\nfocused on earn your own\nrespect when you look at yourself and\nyou say I'm pathetic because of a b and\nc that's what you should fix forget\nabout everybody\nelse there are so many things in your\nlife which you want to improve because\nyou want to improve them then do it that\nis where respect comes from and once you\nstart respecting yourself first of all\nit's a real tragedy but other people\nwill respect you\ntoo but the most important thing is that\nyou will not become dependent on other\npeople's respect so there are some\npeople out there who are so toxic but\ntheir toxicity is something very\ndifferent from what we think of is\ntoxicity one of the most toxic\ncharacteristics in a relation\nreltionship\nis variable respect variable approval\none of the most psychologically damaging\nthings that you can do to a child and we\nsee this so much with Asian kids their\nparents are like this if you get an A+ I\nlike you if you get an A I don't like\nyou if this other kid does better than\nyou I don't like you if you do better\nthan this other kid I like\nyou and the crazy thing is it isn't it\nisn't the standard\nit's the variable respect and if you\nlook at the most addictive\nrelationships these are the ones where\nyour partner treats you really well on\none day and then treats you really\npoorly the next\nday if we look at abuse of relationships\npeople will wonder why on\nEarth would this person stay in this\nrelationship it's because some people\nabusers have figured out that you treat\npeople well on one day and you treat\nthem like crap on another day the whole\ngaming industry has figured this out\nwith microtransactions and loot loot\nboxes this is a random reinforcement\nschedule of affection of Love of\napproval and it addicts the [ __ ] out of\npeople and it teaches people that your\nvalue as a human being is dependent on\nsome external factor and then people get\nso genuinely confused because they're\nlike I don't understand how you can have\nintrinsic value what does that mean yeah\nit's confusing and I don't blame them\nit's because they've just never had this\nidea like they've never had consistency\nof approval consistency of respect\nrespect despite\ncircumstances and I learned this from my\nmentors and you learned it in Psychiatry\nbecause you see people at their highs\nand you see people at their lows\nespecially with\naddictions and the whole point is like\nthey're the same people they're good\npeople whether they do good things or do\nbad things I don't think that it changes\nthe goodness of a person I think there's\nbad actions you can harm people and you\ncan do things that are wrong I don't\nknow that it fundamentally changes your\nvalue as a\nperson I think there's about 1% of the\npopulation that's genuinely bad people\nthose people exist too but it's like\nexceedingly rare and even the bad people\ncan become can do good things worked\nwith them it's very interesting love it\nvery exciting professionally very\nsatisfying professionally\ndoes this make\nsense but don't they both go together\nself-respect and social if you're\nscrewed they go together that's the\nwhole point is that you're absolutely\nright the way that our brain is wired\nand it's important to understand\nthis so let's understand the\nNeuroscience so if we look at theory of\nmind super\ncool so at the very beginning we have a\nyoung\nchild and a young child doesn't\nunderstand that other people\nexist so they don't understand that like\nother people like they just everything's\njust senses like sensory inputs right so\nthere's no difference between like a\nrock and a human there's just two\nobjects out in the world it's not like\nthere's a conscious being and a\nnon-conscious being because they little\npoor little brains are developed this is\nwhy peekaboo is the most lit game in the\nuniverse because if I go like\nthis\npeekaboo when you can't see me I cease\nto\nexist so babies love peekaboo because\nthey're like what the is this this\nperson is winking in and out of\nexistence they don't have object\npermanence they don't have theory of\nmind and it's like oh my God the world\nis a magical place this person used to\nbe there they're gone oh no my Dad or\nMom disappeared they've ceased they\nwinked out of existence and now they're\nback woo woo it's very very scary and\nthen they learn that mommy or daddy\nalways comes back and they're like okay\nwe're playing this game again let's go\nit's like a mini roller coaster for a\nbaby it's like fear here's the drop oh\nmy God are they actually gone are they\nactually gone and then you learn as a\nparent you learn how to play peekaboo\nyou learn that you don't go peekaboo in\ntwo seconds right away then you go a\nlittle bit longer a little bit longer a\nlittle bit longer they're like it's like\nthey're the roller coaster is going up\nup up up up the kid's like and then you\nappear and they're like yes\nthis is what happens with peekaboo they\nhave no theory of\nmind then they develop a theory of mind\nthey start to understand okay this\nperson exists there's also why\npsychological trauma uh trauma during\nthat time abuse during that time is very\npsychologically\ndamaging okay I have an allergy to this\nwhat are we talking about okay this is\nprobably the old thing\nokay because if no one else exists in\nthe world any pain that you experience\nis your fault so some someone does\nsomething bad to you you don't\nunderstand that there are other\nconscious beings that are capable of\nzering malice towards you so you blame\nyourself for everything okay that's\nanother piece consequence of no theory\nof mind then we develop theory of mind\nwe're like okay there's people out there\nand then when we're like eight or nine\nlike we recognize that people out there\ndon't have we don't have the depth of\ntheir mental experience so we're like I\nlike this person this person likes me\nbut we don't really have a whole lot of\nlike color or character to the way that\nthey think so if I were to ask you as a\ngrown adult how do you think this person\nfeels you can hypothesize all kinds of\nstuff you can empathize about their work\nsituation about dating\nwhatever but when you're a kid you don't\nreally know that they're like yeah\nthey're cool people or they're not cool\npeople then puberty comes\nalong and hormones activate and hormones\ngo to your\nbrain and now in addition to developing\nprimary and secondary sexual\ncharacteristics our brain also has to\nlearn how to like get into The Mating\nGame right it's not just about the\nphysical changes voice changes shaving\nall that kind of stuff it's also the\nbrain so the brain develops persistent\nideas of other people other people\nbecome these whole complex human beings\nand the most important thing that\nchanges is our brain learns how our\nactions influence the opinions of others\nthis is why peer pressure is so big\nduring adolescence because what I do\nshapes someone's opinion of me this\nfundamental\nfact happens in puberty this capability\nthis awareness that other people will\nchange the way that they treat me based\non how I\nact happens in\npuberty so when this happens our\nself-esteem gets tied to other\npeople now whether I'm treated well or\nnot makes me feel good about myself or\nnot not good about myself so if I am\nclass president I feel better if I'm\npopular I feel more confident so my\nself-worth ties to the self-worth of the\npeople around me this is evolutionary\nthis is\nbiological now what happens in our human\ncognitive development is then we go\nthrough other stages so hopefully it\nused to be this way in our 20s at some\npoint we have to start living our own\nlife so we decide I'm not just going to\ndo what peer pressure determines I\nfigured out that I want certain things\nin life and I'm going to gravitate\ntowards those and then in our 30s and\nour 40s roll around and then mid-40s\nroll around and then we look back at the\nchoices that we made and we say when I\nstarted the process of\nself-determination instead of caving\ninto everybody\nelse at this point in my life did I was\nit the right choice or the wrong choice\nand that's why we have midlife crises\nbecause for some people it's the wrong\nchoice or some people did cave to what\nother people want and they look back in\ntheir mid-40s and they said I've lived\nmy life for the benefit of others and\nnow I regret it hence midlife crisis I'm\ngoing to dye my hair I'm going to buy a\nsports\ncar if I get divorced I'm going to start\ndating someone\nyounger this is what\nhappens human\ndevelopment\npuberty hormonal effects on\nsocialization aronian\nstages if you're if you all want\nreferences so you're right that\nself-respect comes from the respect of\nothers and even at its origin if we look\nat the theories of secure attachment a\nchild's self-respect and confidence will\ncome from an unwavering respect and\nsupport from their\nparents not the loot\nbox you get the prize whether you do a\ngood job or a bad job this is what solid\nparenting gives people is a self-respect\nso even if you look at the roots of it\neven your own self-respect comes from\nother\npeople this doesn't mean that it has to\nbut that's where it usually comes from\nthankfully it doesn't have to come from\nthat so we know from studies of\nspiritual Traditions my own experience\nwhat I've helped people do that doesn't\nhave to come that way that's the easiest\nway it's the default but thankfully as\nhuman beings we don't have to do what\nwe're defaulting\nto right the whole point of Being Human\nwhat really separates humans from\nanimals is that I think we're the living\norganism that can most easily go against\nour\nnature now you can make arguments that\nwe're we never do that but I don't I\nmean I don't personally agree with that\nthat's not the way I see the world I\nthere's good scientific evidence that\nthat my view is incorrect but that's\njust how I choose to see the\nworld the cool thing about being human\nis you don't have to you're not destined\nby your\nbiology right we do things like we're\naltruistic and you can make an argument\nfor that being biological which is a\ngood one by the way I'm not saying that\nthat argument is\nwrong so self-respect does often times\ncome from other people that's the\ndefault but it doesn't have to and once\nyou respect\nyourself then you will become impervious\nto the lack of respect of other\npeople and then you're gucy because then\nyou feel good you feel content and\ntranquil\nokay all right let's do one\nmore no woman before sleeping with a guy\nand it's the perfect filter I would wait\nsix days if I were a woman before\nsleeping with a guy and it's the perfect\nfilter anyone who's made it past six\nstates he's in it for the long run it's\neasy to get super excited and think\nsomething's going well and you're\nuntouchable but always pull back a\nlittle when you're with somebody you're\nreally interested in versus just kind of\nhow do you feel like your approach is\ndifferent my game is a million times\nbetter if I'm not interested why do you\nthink that is I don't know you get\nnervous you get self-conscious you lose\nself-confidence me you start caring\nabout the thing oh nothing my game is\nvery good to start out with but once\nyou're into a girl it's free fall that's\nthe reason why sometimes I think I might\nbe be single forever I'm just going to\nmess it\nup all right so I think there's some\ngood stuff here and some stuff that I\ndisagree with\nso does being into a girl or\nguy is that a mistake so this guy says\nmy game is way\nbetter when I'm not into someone so I\nthink that makes a lot of sense sense\nfor a lot of\npeople so when we you know when we're\ninto someone we have a lot of emotions\nwe make\nmistakes um we're less in control of\nourselves we're more emotionally\nsloppy right we'll like text more than\nwe\nshould we'll call more we'll be a little\nbit clingier maybe we'll cry\nall kinds of stuff will\nchange\nso I I think this part this is a common\nexperience for a lot of people but I I\ndon't I don't I don't buy it I don't\nthink that's the way to do\nthings so chat I hate to break this to\ny'all but I'm like kind of a hopeless\nromantic like I believe in love I\nbelieve in true love I believe in all\nthis kind of stuff I think it's idiotic\nto believe but I believe it like I\nbelieve in lover like\nI'm I'm I'm love\nI mean I said I should say I believe in\nlove I'm a lover not a\nfighter so here's a couple of things to\nunderstand so I think one of the most\nattractive things for someone is for\nsomeone to be hopelessly in love with\nyou now that can be very scary or it can\nbe really amazing so that's the\nthing right is we sometimes it scares\npeople but like oh my God it's very\nintoxicating to be on the receiving end\nprovided you're not creeped out by\nthem so the biggest mistake here is that\nwhen we fall in love with someone and\nwhen we're totally into someone we are\nnot good at managing our emotions which\nis why men have this problem more that\nat least I see maybe it's not even true\nactually it's probably not true I see\nmen talk about this problem more and\nmaybe that's because of my social\nalgorithm but you know so dudes will say\nlike broh like you know tug one out\nbefore you go on a date right you'll\nthink clear like don't be that into her\nlike you can't be that into her\notherwise she'll take advantage of you\nthat kind of stuff happens right so\nthere's a lot of reasons to be\ncareful about being too into someone but\nin my heart of hearts I think it's love\nlike you should go for\nit and I think it's incredibly it's\nincredibly intoxicating for the other\nperson when you're like totally into\nthem provided that you're not creepy\nabout it so I think the biggest problem\nhere is that men especially are not\ntrained to be at peace with their\nemotions so in the same way that see I\ndon't think anger is a bad\nthing but we should be in control of our\nanger our anger should not be in control\nof us anxiety is not a bad\nthing we should be in control of our\nanxiety our anxiety should not be in\ncontrol of us and love is not a bad\nthing we should be in control of love\nlove should not be in control of us and\nI believe that and also I don't because\nI think sometimes the nature of Love is\nthat you lose\ncontrol and there's something very very\nendearing\nabout someone who tries to maintain\ncontrol and just\ncan't so a lot of people a lot of dudes\nare worried about premature ejaculation\nso the interesting thing is a\npsychiatrist I know that came out of\nleft\nfield so as a psychiatrist I I work with\na lot of women and so sometimes I'll ask\nthem you know we'll talk about their sex\nlives because that's a normal part of\nour Psychotherapy and I'll ask them like\nyou know what do they think you know and\nso there's there's a lot of stuff about\nsexual satisfaction but the interesting\nthing that I was surprised by is the\nmajority of women that I worked with and\nmaybe this is a a sample size issue are\nactually like not that premature\nejaculation not the worst thing in the\nworld so I think sexual satisfaction is\nimportant in a relationship but one of\nthe most\nhow can I say this complimentary things\nthat a woman can experience based on\nwhat they've told me okay is for someone\nto ejaculate very quickly because they\nare just so into this woman and they\ncan't hold back and they're like so\naroused by her body and by her soul that\nthey can't hold back they're so in love\nand like you know I think sexual\nsatisfaction is important so you can't\nend there that's the main thing it's the\npremature ejaculation is not the problem\nI mean 70% of women can't even orgasm\nfrom penetrative intercourse it's like\nyou're going to need something else\nanyway and that's the main\nthing\nokay so this is this is the thing like I\nI get that people are paranoid about\nfalling in love and like but I I think\nyou should get a little bit more\ncomfortable with it right learn to to be\nwith it learn to let it out a little bit\nlose control a little bit but like don't\ngo crazy\nand and so yeah I see the women in the\ntrat the the women in chat are like\nagreeing with me so that's reassuring so\nmaybe it's not just you know my patience\nbut\num you know and\nI yeah so like if y'all just if yall pay\nattention to chat you'll see that you\nknow people are saying this and that's\nthe thing is like we as men like we\ndon't the crazy thing about like us\ndudes is when we're like trying to\nunderstand what women want\nwe don't [ __ ] talk to\nwomen we just like I don't I don't\nknow you know like I don't know why it's\na bunch of dudes like telling each other\nlike what you know what work what works\nin sex it's like that's weird do you all\nget that like does anyone stop and think\nabout like this is the way that like you\nbe attractive and it's like I secretly I\nwonder if some of these people are\nsecretly gay and into dudes like that's\njust what they want like I honestly\nwonder that sometimes cuz here they are\ntalking about love and what it takes to\nget people to fall in love with you and\nlike what's attractive in a man they're\nlike here's how to be an attractive man\nit's like how the [ __ ] do you know\nbecause that's what you find attractive\nyou know I I really wonder about that\nsometimes it's like here's how to be\nattractive like what ask women and\nthere's there's a there's a study I saw\nrecently where men are very poor judges\nof what women are attracted\nto you know it's like it's it's\nisn't it weird chat like have you guys\never thought about\nthis that it's like it's kind of weird\nlike shouldn't we be getting advice as\ndudes from women instead of other\nmen and shouldn't women get advice from\ndudes instead of other women\nand like I I\nanyway someone saying women lie so I\nmean so do\nmen right I don't think I think\ndeception is gender\nspecific yeah but women don't agree\nbetween each other neither do dudes\nthis is so weird someone's saying\ndeception is a feminine trait I'm so\ncurious where that kind of thinking\ncomes\nfrom like deception like deception\nstarts in all babies like 2-year-olds\nare where deception\nstarts I'd say deception is a human\ntrait okay so someone's saying I\nprioritized women's advice my whole life\nI'm single at 57 thanks for sharing\nright so\nmaybe maybe that's a problem right like\nI and I'm I'm I'm honestly I'm very glad\nyou\nshared because like you know so maybe\nwhat I'm thinking is wrong\nyeah I'm not the Arbiter of Truth here\nand if people have contrary experiences\nto my perceptions like we should\nhighlight those twoo right so we got to\nfigure out what's going on\nthere and other people are saying like\nwomen give bad advice and so do men\nmaybe that's maybe that's good too\nokay best advice to get is from old\nmarried\nmen\nokay\num all right let's take a look at one\nmore and then I think we\nare okay let's do this one this looks\nlike a good one by the way I I'm really\nenjoying today so thank you all very\nmuch for you know doing\nthis like I love I love the chat\ninteraction I love what y'all are saying\nlike the energy in both directions like\nwhen yall agree and when yall disagree\nlike both directions is\nfantastic\num\nokay this has been this has been great\nhopefully this has been helpful to\ny'all that's what we're here\nfor\nno I like you I like you too how much\nthis much oh why I like you this much\nthere's an imbalance what do you see\nwhen you see me a relationship oh what\ndo you see fun dates yeah no I'm cool\nwith that are you not really but I'll\npretend but you're going to develop\nfeelings about aren't substantiated by\nanything tangible I'll just keep hoping\nyou'll change your mind fully knowing\nthat I won't mhm well that's delusional\nyes you're going to get hurt I'm aware\nwhy would you put yourself through that\nwell I'd rather have some of you than\nnone I feel like I should end this\nbefore it gets to that point why well\nthe longer we see each other the harder\nthe blow will be on you so end it I\nwon't why because I'm getting everything\nI want at your expense you end it I\nwon't why because I like to self-respect\nto walk\naway what's another situation chip\nmaybe we should look for people that\nactually want the same thing we do we\nprobably should\nbut this I think is the best\none I think that's a great I think it's\na great I think it's\ngreat that's\nfantastic\nright yeah can I link it I I I think\nit's I think it's a very good\nrepresentation of of the psychological\ndrivers that\nhappen I I have nothing chat have\nnothing to add I think they did a a good\njob I think the Hopeless Romantic in me\nsays that sometimes things do work\nout so that's I guess that's the one\nthing that I would add is that often\ntimes it ends poorly but I've seen it\nend\nwell so I I I've had I've had friends to\nend up in long-term relationships that\ndid not start out that way where one\nperson liked the other person\nmore um I think my relationship was\nprobably like that\nhonestly I think but I think it's good I\nthink I linked the video didn't I here's\nthe\nvideo I thought it was a very good\ncharacterization\nno uh I I think you know the one thing I\nwould say is I don't think it's\nnecessarily delusional right so I I\nthink that\nthere's so the the the one thing that I\nwould say is kind of like I think it's a\nbeautiful representation of a lot of\npeople's experiences but I I do think\nthat people's feelings\nchange\nso often times they don't at least in\nthe direction that you want but but I\nthink sometimes they do like I think\nit's many people that I have worked with\nhave had an imbalance of how much one\nperson is into the other person and I\nthink over time people can start to\nrecognize things in another human being\nthat they did not value at the very\nbeginning so I I I know I everyone's\nsaying don't give me hope but like I'm\nnot saying it's common but I I have seen\nit quite I mean I've seen it a lot right\nbut those are those are in the\nrelationship that end up well so that\nthere's a sample size issue there where\nlike I'm seeing the ones that ended up\nwell right so when people come to me I'm\nnot talk they don't talk to me about\ntheir relation the the fourth\nrelationship they had before their\ncurrent one that ended up because of\nthis that ended up ended because of this\nDynamic but but I I know it's I know\nit's it's bad but I I think like don't\nlose hope chat like I'm serious like I\nmean I think you it's it's healthier if\nyou do but\nnah I I'm I believe in love I I think\nlike I've seen it you\nknow I think\nit's I think it's tough\nbut yeah I mean I I don't I don't know\nwhat y'all want me to say like let's you\nknow so here's the thing is it a bad\nstrategy yeah does it sometimes work\nyeah I mean if you play games on the\ninternet you know that's\ntrue you know that good strategies don't\nhave to win and bad strategies can\nwin you know this is not good for your\npsyche like I don't know\ndude like what\nso here's here's what I would say so if\nwe're talking about like okay like I'm\njust I'm thinking through this as I as\nI'm seeing y'all's comments and and it's\nreally helpful by the\nway so how to approach this in a healthy\nway so I think it's\nreasonable to enter into something of a\nrelationship where people are looking\nfor different things and there's enough\nCommon\nGround see I think the problem that we\nhave with dating right now is everyone\nis looking from for a perfect match from\nthe\nget-go and situationships I think are a\nreally good example of this where one\nperson is kind of into you and and like\nI think it's very well said that like\nI'll take what I can\nget and even though the other person\nknows it's hurtful it's like I'm getting\nwhat I want and so you know like it's\nkind of like one person's in pain now\none person is going to be inflicting\npain later which they don't want to do I\nthink I think it's a very good accurate\nrepresentation but I do think that human\nbeings change their mind right people\ncan grow into love and they can grow out\nof\nlove now people are saying don't give me\nhopium right so like this is terrible\nfor my psyche because now I'm going to\npursue women and that's where I would\nlike I'm like one of those it's better\nto have loved and lost than to have\nnever loved at all and maybe I'll change\nmy mind one day maybe God forbid I'll go\nthrough a divorce or something like that\nand I'll be like [ __ ] I did it wrong for\n20 years I was deluded I was blue pilled\nI was such a beta cuck whatever maybe\nI'll wake up one day and I'll I'll say\nthat right who knows maybe the I'll I'll\nhave the wool\npulled off of my eyes and I'll see the\nworld for what it is and I'll take the\nred pill and all that kind of stuff\ncould\nhappen but I I think that like I don't\nknow I mean just just if you look at\njust the psychology of human beings\nhuman beings affection each other\nchanges over time that's a\nfact and so you should understand that\nand I don't think you should deprive\nyourself of the opportunity of something\njust think about it for a second right\nif you say unless this person is as into\nme as I am into them I'm not going to\ndate them from the\nget-go just think about how much you're\nnarrowing your\npossibilities that means that the only\noption is that you're head over heels in\nlove with someone who's head over heels\nin love with you and like it's great\nwhen that happens but often times those\nrelationships end up in train wrecks\nthat is something I feel very confident\nabout and how do I know this because\nI've worked at rehabs for about two\nyears rehab is a terrible place to fall\nin love and people do it all the time\nand boy do they fall in love and they\nfall in love hard they fall in love\nmutually it's a\nmess and like just because two people\nfall in love like that doesn't mean that\nthe relationship is going to end well so\nit's like let's think through our\noptions option number one we have the\nsame amount of love for each\nother okay well like that means either\nwe're both head over heels in love which\nlike sometimes ends up in like two we\nmarriages that fall apart within a few\nweeks because honeymoon phase is over\nand we begin to see each other for who\nwe really are love can't make a\nrelationship work forever it's not\nsufficient you need more than that\noption number two is like the two of us\nare just lukewarm\nokay fair\nenough and if we're kind of lukewarm\nlike are we assuming that things are\ngoing to be the same or the things going\nto be different okay no if things are\nthe same that's a shitty relationship\nright it's kind of lukewarm not the best\nnot the worst maybe it's not shitty and\nthe third thing is we're not that into\neach other and so like that that we\ndon't want so even in the lukewarm\nrelationship were we assuming that\npeople can\nchange okay so if we're assuming that\npeople can change and one person is head\nover heels in love the other person is\nkind of lukewarm like that can change\nso I think the way to approach this in a\nhealthy manner is to give it a shot and\nI think the problem is not in hoping\nit's first of all recognizing that as I\nenter this relationship there is pain in\nmy future eyes wide\nopen I think the mistake that people\nmake is\nthat it's not that they\nhope it's that they don't balance hope\nwith the possibility that things may not\nwork out well so I think the healthy\nthing to do is to enter these\nsituationships if you have feelings for\nsomeone and say I'm going to give it\nsome amount of time let's see if things\nchange I think it's important to be\ntransparent about that\ntoo right and say like I'm I'll take\nwhat I can get now I'm hoping you change\nyour mind and I'm comfortable seeing\nwhere things go and then if things don't\nwork out then I think you should\nleave now how long I don't know maybe 6\nmonths maybe a year is what my gut tells\nme but I have no data to back that\nup but I think that people es I mean\nthere's some studies about this I\nhaven't seen any consistent data about\nthe rate at which men and women fall in\nlove is\nvariable there's even like some\nweird you know studies that I don't put\na whole lot of stock into I think\nthey're lowquality research that show\nthat you know there's weird things that\nhappen\nlike dudes who become dads will be more\nattractive to like some women including\ntheir\nwives so it's it's weird and I I don't\nknow if if that's\njust women trying to make dudes with Dad\nbods feel good about themselves but I've\nseen some data to support that so like\nwhat the the nature of attractiveness\nchanges there may be some kind of\nbiological basis to that to where like\nif you see someone who is a good parent\nsome weird Evolution thing is like okay\nlike we should mate with this person but\nI'm hesitant to cite that kind of\nliterature because I don't think it's\nnearly as deterministic everyone was\nlike women are like this I I mean\nthere's all kinds of evolution and all\nkinds of biology that can be true but we\nalso know that human beings are highly\nvariable and have some degree of Free\nWill so it's not\ndeterministic um but there's there you\nknow if you study like 10,000 women\nyou'll detect some kinds of signals like\nthat and for that matter men will change\ntheir attractiveness too or men will\nchange what they're attracted to so I I\nthink like don't give up right away is\nmy\ninstinct but I think you should also\nunderstand that it doesn't necessarily\nmean that things are going to go well so\nI think Eyes Wide Open give it a shot\nand then be comfortable walking\naway don't advise people to go for\nunbalanced relationship self-respect\nrespect is so important yeah so I think\nself-respect is a very important part of\nthat so I think an unbalanced\nrelationship with self-respect can end\nwell give this person time to see if you\nknow because not everyone falls in love\nat the same rate but I completely\nagree that if you lack self-respect and\nyou're in an unbalanced relationship\nthat is where abuse comes from that is\nhow you become a doormat\nit's hard to control your emotion though\nespecially love I completely agree right\nso that's where we've got to ask a\nquestion\ny'all so how do you want to live your\nlife is a\nlife of restraint and control at all\npoints the kind of way that we want to\nlive life or do we sometimes want to let\ngo are we okay sometimes making\nmistakes are we living life to the\nfullest including the good and the\nbad right so that's a decision you have\nto\nmake all right so I I tend to default or\nmy conclusion at this point in life is\nlike you know it's not so much about\ncontrolling your love or not controlling\nyour love I think that's important I\nthink it should be tempered but I think\nit's like go into things with eyes wide\nopen accept that suffering is a part of\nlife and and you know anytime you fall\nin love you're signing up for the\npotential of heartbreak that's the\nreality right anytime you purchase a\nloot box it could have something good\nand it could have something bad it's\nyour choice whether you want to play or\nnot but I don't think that the avoidance\nof potential hurt is a way to live a\nfulfilling\nlife and what we know from studies on\nvideo game addiction is that it is the\ndenial of the reward that makes the\nthing so\nsatisfying the random reinforcement\nschedule is more satisfying it's the\nchance that when it goes in your favor\nis what really people\nlove it's the long shot it's what we\nmemorialize in our\nmythology in our stories\nso I'd say live life without avoiding I\nmean don't be stupid\nbut I I don't think that the avoidance\nof regret at every choice is how we come\nto a life worth\nliving speaking from experience living\nin constant restraint as hell yeah I can\nimagine\nhow do I know if I have enough\nself-respect that I can even start\nhealthy relationships so we have a a\nsegment that we're going to be doing in\nmiday on self-discovery on the\nmembership side but that is that is a\ngreat question I will think about\nthat\nso I think the the the real problem with\nthis idea of if I have enough self\nresect to start a healthy relationship\nis\nthat we also know from psychology of of\nattachment theory in relationships is\nthat a healthy relationship can improve\nyour\nself-respect so I think the real tricky\nthing is that we tend to think that I\nhave to do a before B before c but in\nreal life often times it's the other way\naround and I recognize that that's like\nchallenging right because if you're not\nif you don't have enough self-respect\nyou may open yourself up to an abusive\nrelationship absolutely true which\nimplies that you should work on your\nself-respect first and then enter a\nrelationship but we also have data that\nshows that a supportive caring partner\ncan help you form self-respect I know\nit's certainly the case for me so I I\nthink the issue is not so much that one\nneeds to come before the other but that\nyou should focus on both\nsimultaneously don't let one be a\nsubstitute for the\nother right so go to therapy and if you\nfeel like you want to give dating a\nshot I think that's the right\nanswer how to accept being a loser don't\nwe have that\nalready\nokay we're at time for\ntoday but this has been fantastic this\nhas been great y'all have been awesome\nDr K ignoring all the stats on men and\nwomen's differences what does that mean\nwhich stats are you talking\nabout I'm ignoring a lot of Statistics I\ncan't cite everything all the time but\nif there's something in particular that\nI'm missing\noh do you have anything about\nrelationships involving someone with\nbipolar disorder let me\nsee oh bipolar disorder and\nrelationships is tough let me\nsee I we have stuff on BPD I mean\nbipolar\nbpad but I don't know if we have\nrelationship specific stuff\nbut you you know if yall think I'm\nignoring some kinds of Statistics or\nthere's like pieces that I'm like I'm\nnot citing everything all the time\nthere's like hundreds and hundreds of\npapers about I mean on the literature is\nlike thousands and th tens of thousands\nhundreds of thousands of papers but if\nthere's something in particular that\ny'all think I'm leaving out it's not my\nintention to be obfuscation\num we had something about B borderline\npersonality disorder relationships but\nnot bipolar\ndisorder how do you know if your partner\nhas bipolar versus BPD you don't their\ndoctor does that's the whole point of a\ndoctor I'm going on a second date\ntomorrow and recently I've put on a\nsubstantial amount of weight do you have\nany advice for how I can get myself to\nfeel less self-conscious about\nit so I think that the best way to deal\nwith that is just to acknowledge that\nI'm going to be self-conscious right\nthat this is something that's changed\nand own\nit and then do your best to have a good\ntime but I think that like if you're\nself-conscious about it like I don't\nthink that that's going to change just\nyou can't fight against it just own it\nacknowledge and say this is bad and this\nis something I'm not happy with and I\nthink if you if if you're going tomorrow\nI would even say I guess here's a piece\nof concrete advice do something between\nnow and tomorrow that moves you in the\nright\ndirection so you don't have to lose all\nthe weight if you've put on weight but\nlike eat healthy or exercise at least\nonce move in the right direction at\nleast one step that will help some\nokay all right y'all thank you very much\ntake care everybody thanks for coming\nwe're doing mental health may I think\nwe've got um streams and stuff a lot\nmore this month I'll be traveling for a\ncouple of\ndays um and then I think we've got an\ninterview with Destiny on Thursday and\nthen a deep dive into cptsd on Friday so\nwe'll see yall next week chat take care"
