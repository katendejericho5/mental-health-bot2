    "transcript": "oh my God if only I knew everything that\nI know now then then I could start\nliving your life think for a second you\nknow everything that you know now you\ncan still start living your life right\nyou can start living your life at 25 oh\nbut I'm\nbehind so here we have the 25-year-old\nthinker now let's understand a couple of\nbasic things about the mind so in in\nsome people their mind is just so so I\nwould say energetic and out of control\nso sometimes our mind if you really pay\nattention to yourself the Mind loves to\nthink and what we find is that these\npeople kind of get trapped in their\nthoughts right so they have imaginary\nevents imaginary girlfriends right\nthey're absorbed they're unaware of\ntheir surroundings imagines right so\ninner monologue becomes their entire\nreality so there are a couple of things\nto re understand about why this happens\nand what to do about it hey y'all I want\nto take a moment to thank the sponsor of\ntoday's video headspace as you all know\nI am a huge fan of meditation I've been\nmeditating for about 20 years and as you\nknow I teach a lot of meditation and\nrecommend it to a lot of my patients the\nchallenge that a lot of beginners have\nis that it's difficult to sort of\ndevelop a consistent practice the cool\nthing about headspace is that it makes\nmeditation easier to actually accomplish\nthey can offer a lot of different guided\nmeditations timers they can help you\nsort of anchor your practice and stick\nwith it day in and day out I also really\nlike the flexib ability of headspace\nthey have a lot of different options so\nyou can find the thing that works for\nyou I specifically like that they have\nthese things called Sleep casts which\nare particular guided meditations to\nhelp you go to sleep in a healthy way if\nyou're looking for something that's a\nlittle bit more active they have\nintention walks in nature which are\nguided meditations that can help you get\nup and move around a little bit the\nbeautiful thing is that they have so\nmany different options you can try\nthings until you find something that\nworks so if you're interested in\ndeveloping your meditation practice\nactually sticking with the schedule\ndefinitely give headspace a shot so you\ncan check out the link in the\ndescription below or scan the QR code\nand for 60 days you can try headspace\nfor free and check out their entire\nLibrary thanks to headspace for\nsponsoring this video and helping us\nkeep mental health content on the\ninternet free by supporting this channel\nthis happens because the mind is out of\nour control so the mind is an instrument\nright so it's just like any other part\nof our body and the goal of the body is\nthat the body and mind should be\ncontrolled by you the the body should\nnot control you you should control the\nbody right and we run into all kinds of\nproblems when people are not in control\nof their bodies so like in the worst\ncase scenarios we get things like\nincontinence and so in the same way that\nwe can sometimes lose control of our\nbody we lose control of our mind and so\nif you look at this person what they're\nwhat they end up with is a mind that\ndoes whatever it wants to and we're\ngoing to dive into why it does all of\nthese things everything is kind of\nstitched together but there's one major\nprinciple to understand see we have to\nunderstand what the Mind wants so what\ndoes the Mind hate more than anything\nelse what it hates more than anything\nelse is boredom so in the absence of\nstimulus the mind will run out of energy\nsee in order for the mind to gain energy\nit must have some kind of stimulus so\nvery simple thing like let's say I'm\nwalking down the street and I see a\nfight break out in front of me oh my God\nthis is so much to think about or forget\nabout walking down the street if you\nlook at the internet what do we see all\nthe time we see drama why why does the\ninternet love drama right some someone\nparticular person does something someone\nmakes a post about it they said oh I\nthis person is not actually a saint they\ndid this to me and then everyone talks\nabout it and then they react to it and\nall this kind of stuff right this kind\nof stuff is going on right now with\nsomeone where an article came out that\nwas talking about something bad that\nthey did why does the why does the why\ndoes the internet love this because our\nminds love it why do they love it\nbecause if there's a stimulus then I get\nenergy in the mind and if the mind has\nenergy it runs right so this is what\nalso confuses a lot of people that a lot\nof people are really confused why does\nmy mind why is my an mind anxious all\nthe time I don't feel good that's\nbecause the mind will take any kind of\nenergy it can get and anxiety produces a\nlot of energy see anytime you add\ntension to the Mind any time you try to\nwrestle the mind the Mind actually loves\nit it gets way stronger because you try\nto control the anxiety and then you\nwrestle with it for a while and the\nanxiety comes roaring back twice as\nstrong and then the mind is going again\nright so the more anxiety we have the\nmore more that the Mind activates so the\nfirst thing to look at is what happens\nto the energy of the mind with all of\nthese things the energy of the Mind\nincreases see look what what what's\nHappening Here created entire\nanthologies of imaginary events oh my\nGod the mind has discovered a way to\nfeed itself this is like an infinite\nmoney glitch for your mental energy\nmultiple imaginary girlfriends now I can\nengage with my thoughts I don't require\nan external stimulus I certainly don't\nrequire a real girlfriend right because\nI can create a stimulus by myself\nthere's an inner monologue that becomes\ntheir entire reality so they get\nabsorbed in the mind and then as the\nenergy of the Mind increases they lose\ncontrol of it because now it's like a\ngigantic bull that thinks whatever it\nwants to whenever the [ __ ] it wants to\nand screw you so then we run into a\ncouple of problems so as the energy of\nthe Mind increases there are a couple of\nother things at play so as we become\nthinkers we start to become worse at\nlife right because thinking is useful so\nwhen thinking is combined with\nexperience this is when things go well\nright so let's say I'm playing a game of\nLeague of Legends or valerant or Dota or\nStarcraft or whatever sf6 we're going to\npick sf6 today so I can Theory craft all\nI want in Street Fighter 6 it doesn't\nactually make me good at the game and if\nall I do is I play mindlessly I'm also\nnot going to be good at the game if I\nnever think about my games I'm never\ngoing to be good so success in life\ncomes from the combination of thought\nplus experience but what happens with\nthe The Thinker is that they don't have\nany experience they just have thoughts\nright their inner monologue becomes a\nsubstitute for reality so the first\nthing is that the Mind loves this energy\nbecause this person this person is a\n25-year-old thinker they've been a\nthinker for way longer than just this\nyear they didn't become a thinker at 25\nthey've been think thinking more and\nmore and more and if you're a 25-year\nold think girl you'll notice that this\npattern probably started in your teenage\nyears and then as you grew more and more\ndependent on thinking you got worse at\nlife because you started using thought\nas a substitute for experience so then\nyour actual experience goes down your\nactual performance goes down and then\nyou're you end up here right oh my God\nif only I knew everything that I know\nnow then then I could start living your\nlife think for a second you know\neverything that you know now you can\nstill start living your life right you\ncan start living your life at 25 oh but\nI'm behind and so now we get to a really\nreally important problem of this okay so\nwhy do we why do we imagine going back\nin time so let's think about this right\nso you have all this knowledge now so\nstart living but then the Thinker says\nwhy not well because if I start living\nnow then like I don't know I'm behind\nand this is where we get to a huge\nproblem with the Thinker another major\nmajor major problem which explains this\nand this and this and this so generally\nspeaking the more that we think the less\nemotionally connected we become and as\nwe have negative emotions that pile up\nright because now I've lived a life\nwhere I'm not doing anything for 25\nyears I'm behind this leads to negative\nemotion not having girlfriends or\nboyfriends or whatever non-binary\nfriends leads to negative emotion so not\naccomplishing anything in life is going\nto lead to negative emotion and now this\nis where we have our imaginary stuff\ncome in so if we look at studies on\nthings like maladaptive daydreaming we\nknow that imagination is an emotional\ncoping mechanism so then what ends up\nhappening is we sort of have all these\nneg emotions and then we start imagining\nother things and while we're imagining\nhow great things could be we feel a\nlittle bit better because in our brain\nour brain thinks we can't actually\nimprove we can't start now it's too late\nI'm too far behind I can't start dating\nat 25 what Ridiculousness is this I'm\njust supposed to I can't it's too late I\nwas supposed to start dating when I was\n15 and if I started dating when I was 15\nthen I would have gotten my first\nlong-term relationship in college when I\nwas 19 I would have had sex with at\nleast five people by now and then since\nI'm 25 I would be able to like engage\nwith other 25-year-olds on the same\nplaying field but it's too late now so\nI'm not going to engage and this hurts\nand then the negative emotions require\nsomething like maladaptive daydreaming\nor imagination to Salve our wounds but\nit gets worse than this so there is\nabsolutely a mechanism of so let's think\nabout what to add okay so the first\nthing is that this pattern increases the\nenergy in the mind to the point where\nit's probably overwhelming but your mind\nis never chill right your mind is never\nbored if you look at this there may be\nsome kind of like existential boredness\nbut there is not a boredness in the\nmoment right so you're so you you've\ngotten so good at your inner monologue\nand and constructing things in your mind\nthat you're not bored your mind is\noccupied existentially you're bored\nyou're not [ __ ] doing anything all\nday so like generally speaking you feel\nbored but in your mind in the absence of\nthese external stimuli your mind has\ncreated this internal stimulus there's\nalways energy in the mind because it's\nyou figured out your infinite money\nglitch of thoughts there's negative\nemotions and then your mind copes and\nthe next thing that we kind of think\nabout is that as our experience\ndecreases okay then we become more\nincapable and as we become more\nincapable we are left with a choice and\nthis is the this is the real tragedy of\nthis so I want you all to think about\nfor a second what it's like to be this\nperson see if you believe that you're\nalready too far behind and that you\ncan't accomplish anything in life what\nare you left with so the thought of not\naccomplishing anything means that you\nfeel terrible about yourself yada y yada\nand you can't fix the problem so then\nyour brain looks at this situation and\nsays okay it's impossible to get a\ngirlfriend so what we're going to do\ninstead is we're going to do the best\nthat we can so we'll create this\nartificial life that will be like a\nshadow of the thing right we can't get\nthe object itself but we can get a\nshadow of it and that's the best that we\ncan do so internally subconsciously your\nbrain is just doing what you want it to\nit's trying to work for you and if\nyou've decided that you can't actually\ndo anything then what it's going to do\nis create imagination of those things\nand let's take a quick look at another\nexample of that okay so imagine success\nto cope instead of actually achieving it\nright has no interest in any career just\nwants to think and this is the most\ndamning of them all things are always\nbetter in my head so let's understand\nthat this is what really keeps people\nstuck because things are better in your\nhead so when you think about okay I'm\ngoing to go to a party and I'm going to\ntalk to people and like I'm going to\ncrack some jokes and you sit down and\nyou think about how all the jokes are\ngoing to go and you map them out and you\nfigure everything out and then you show\nup at the party and then you're in the\nmiddle of telling your joke and you joke\nand you cough a little bit you choke on\nyour drink you end up spewing your drink\nall over this person in front of you and\nshe's pretty cute and then everyone's\nlike ew then you're like [ __ ] and then\nyour brain is like okay well I guess\nthat's never going to work so why bother\nlet's instead let's cuz it feels good\nright when you're thinking about\neverything is going to play out and\nyou're like oh my God I'm going to crack\nthis joke and everyone's going to laugh\nand then someone's going to fall in love\nwith me and then I'm going to make out\nwith someone and then your mind is like\nlet's go and then while you're lost in\nthe fantasy you're lost in this\nemotional coping mechanism and then when\nthe reality hits then you're in big\ntrouble because things don't go the\nright way in the real world as they do\nin your head and so this is really\nreally devastating then the problem is\nthat this becomes true right this is not\nlike theoretical at this point now your\nmind has data because things are always\nbetter better in your head clearly right\nbecause in the head you [ __ ]\nmanufacture everything and the reality\nof the situation is that the real world\nkind of is difficult and things don't go\nthat way and so then you sort of feel\nlike anytime you engage with the real\nworld it's going to you're doomed to\nfailure and then the whole cycle repeats\nand you're kind of stuck in your head\nthe real tragedy about this situation is\nthat the 25-year-old thinker actually\nworks way harder than someone who is\nsuccessful this is the real tragedy they\nthink oh I'm lazy I'm not exerting any\neffort and those people out there are so\ndisciplined they actually work way\nharder I know it sounds kind of weird\nbut let me explain so if we look at\nfriction there are two effic uh\ncoefficients of friction there's\nsomething called the static coefficient\nof friction and the kinetic coefficient\nof friction which means anytime you\nstart moving something the process of\ngetting something moving is way harder\nthan keeping it moving so usually the\nkinetic coefficient of friction is lower\nthan the static coefficient of friction\nso if I'm trying to like push a box\nacross the room getting the box to start\nmoving is the hardest part and then it\nmoves on its own so if we look at life\nacceleration is what takes energy and\nthis is true in physics as well right f\nequals ma the force exerted equals mass\ntime acceleration velocity doesn't enter\nthe picture at all very important to\nunderstand so at the 25-year-old thinker\nwhat do they do they start and they stop\nlet me try to go do something and then\nthey stop and they work themselves up\nthey push they push they push they push\nthey overcome that coefficient of static\nfriction and they get things moving but\ntheir velocity is not very good and they\nlook at other people who are moving\nalong very fast at high velocity and\nthey think to themselves oh my God I'm\nmoving at 1 km per hour and this other\nperson is moving at 60 km/ hour there's\nno way in which I'll catch up and so\nthen they slam on the brakes which is\nalso exerting energy so this is what\nI've seen as a psychiatrist the people\nwho move forward in life it's not about\ncatching up or falling behind or\nanything like that it's simply about not\nquitting see I want you to just think\nabout this for a second how far are you\ngoing to get if you're driving a car\nand I slam on the gas and then slam on\nthe brakes and then slam on the gas and\nthen slam on the brakes and then slam on\nthe gas and then slam on the brakes how\nfar am I going to get and how much gas\nam I going to use versus someone who\nstarts slow just gentle pressure on the\nbrakes I mean on the on the on the\naccelerator right you start to pick up a\nlittle bit of speed but you're not\npushing very hard this is the real\ntragedy of the Thinker is that the\nThinker actually exerts way more effort\nbecause even doing a small thing\nrequires so so much energy because the\nbrain is telling you oh you're not going\nto be good at this it's better in my\nhead life ends up sucking yada y y blah\nblah blah blah blah and this is what I\nsee in the people who are stuck and this\nis why I believe so you guys think like\noh my God Dr K believes in everybody he\nhas such a heart of gold that he has\nfaith in us and I'm so [ __ ] far\nbehind I don't have faith in you because\nof whatever positive whatever the [ __ ] I\nhave faith in you because of physics\nbecause if you start accelerating the\nsame laws of physics apply to you as\neverybody else in the universe the same\nlaws of psychology apply to you as\neverybody else this is how I'm able to I\nfeel personally attacked and oh my God\nthis is me and whatever like why do you\ndo you guys think I'm actually\ntelepathic you think because people may\neven watching this 30 days from now and\nthey're like oh my God this is me do you\nthink I am so amazing that I\ntelepathically read your mind in the\nfuture 30 days from now and I have such\namazing Insight oh my God look at this\nguy's [ __ ] psychic how is this guy\nstretching across time and space to read\nmy mind oh my God no no come on on chat\nthat's not I'm not psychic it's just the\n[ __ ] the mind and our brains adhere\nto principles and if you understand\nthese principles then you can fix your\nlife the reason that y'all are stuck the\nreason that the 25-year-old thinker is\nstuck is because they have all kinds of\nerroneous conclusions and they have a\nmind that is not working for them if you\nhave a car without a steering wheel or\nthe steering wheel turns whatever the\n[ __ ] way it wants to go which is\nliterally what happens in a 25-year-old\nthinker right today it wakes up and\nwe're like hard right turn let's go slam\nthe gas let's let's pump the Nitro hard\nright turn and then tomorrow you wake up\nand you're like let's slam the brakes\nand hard left turn you start you stop\nyou go One Direction you go the other\ndirection and then what does the Mind\nconclude the Mind concludes this [ __ ]\ndoesn't work so instead what I'm going\nto do I'm going to sit on my ass and I'm\ngoing to think about imaginary things\nbecause when you think imaginary things\nthen you control the laws of physics\nthat's the whole [ __ ] that's the\nadvantage of imagination like you get to\ncontrol both sides you get to ask\nsomeone out and they get to say my God\neven though I'm dating someone I I need\nyou I'm so torn because I really love\nyou but I'm in this relationship with so\nand you're like oh my God yeah that'd be\ngreat you get to control both sides like\nwhat the [ __ ] so it doesn't obey the\nlaws of physics and we get stuck in this\ncrap so how do we overcome this first\nthing is don't quit just don't quit\nthere's one thing to understand which is\nthat in this part your mind is really\nreally going to dislike it because the\nmind now think about what it's got It's\ngot a very refined it's leveled up its\nimagination capability you're level 100\nat the imagination skill and so the Mind\nanytime you go to reality this is the\nwhole [ __ ] problem right is you go\ninto reality and things are always\nbetter in my head so there is a very\nsubtle Point here but as long as you are\nexpecting things to be as good as in\nyour head it's never going to work so\ninterestingly enough what a thinker\nneeds to do the first thing they need to\ndo is take the L you have to acknowledge\nthat for some amount of time this is\ngoing to be bruising this is going to be\nrough\nbecause remember that real progress\ncomes through thinking and experience\nand then unless you are practiced which\nby the way and we'll get to practice in\na second unless you are practice things\naren't going to go well so I can imagine\nmyself doing a backflip if I try to do a\nback flip but my body didn't flip the\nway I I imagined it so how do you bridge\nthe gap between what you think and what\nreality is how can you make reality what\nyou think practice practice practice\npractice practice and now we see why\nthere is such a gap between thought in\nreality for these people because they\nnever experience they never actually do\nso they're never actually practicing and\nso it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy\nthe one thing that they need to make\ntheir imagination a reality is\nexperience experience is the best thing\nfor them because they have none of it\nand experience will do a couple of\nthings the first thing that'll do is it\nactually make you better and then your\nperformance will closer approximate what\ngoes on in your head the second thing\nthat'll happen is that as you gain\nexperience the inputs of information\nyour axioms will change see the reason\nthat you feel so emotionally bad when\nyou're a 25-year-old thinker is you have\nthis idea of what you should be but this\nis Theory crafting it's not data and so\nthe other way to move forward what is\nthe best way to disabuse someone who is\nTheory crafting in a game hey bro if you\nthink it [ __ ] works ceue up and show\nus right get to grandm or Champion or\nChallenger or Immortal or whatever the\n[ __ ] Divine whatever Chad mode\nsandes whatever whatever rank you want\nthe proof is in the pudding and what\nhappens when Theory Crafters start\nentering the real world with their\ntheorycrafted wonderfulness they get a\nreality check and then they moderate\ntheir expectations and this is the\nreally beautiful thing see people who\nare 25-year-old thinkers think that what\nthey really need to do is live up to\ntheir expectations that's not what you\nneed to do what you need to do is\ndemolish your expectations because just\nthink for a second if you had no\nexpectations no burden of being behind\nno idea of what an imaginary\nrelationship could be if you could\nannihilate all of that and you could\nactually start over you can do that\ntoday you can start over today but the\nstarting over that you need to do is not\ngoing back in time it's to annihilate\nall these [ __ ] Castles in the Sky\nthat you built and actually start living\nlife and then something beautiful\nhappens see once you annihilate your\nexpectations and you're getting your\ninputs from experience then the gap\nbetween imag ination reality shrinks see\nthe pain of the world is not that the\nway that the world is the pain of the\nworld is your imagination about the\nworld what the world should be and the\nreality of what the world is see once we\nannihilate our expectations and then we\nsee the world as it is then we can\nproceed forward and this is where if\nyou're not careful you're going to get\nblackpilled and you're like what are you\nsaying that the world is all a piece of\n[ __ ] no because that's an expectation\nthat is born of your mind you'll\ndiscover quite the opposite that the\nworld is actually a pretty decent place\nso the real tragedy of 25 old thinkers\nis that the very things that they use as\nsolutions to their problems are not the\nsolutions that's actually what\npropagates the problem and even they\nhave some hint of that right because I\nthink over here there's all this kind of\nstuff about analysis paralysis you know\nthere's all they sort of figure out that\nthings are always better in my head and\nyet they never they never leave their\nhead this just creates a huge problem so\nstep number one start experiencing give\nyourself data instead of theory crafting\nstep number two stop slamming on the gas\nand slamming on the brakes and I will\nbet you that if you're a 25-year-old\nthinker you do this you know you do this\nthe frequency of it may decrease but you\ndo this you'll get really excited about\nsomething you'll try something right\nbecause this is not working even with\nyour 250 IQ you recognize that this is\nnot sustainable so you try to go out\ninto the real world and when you do that\nyou end up quitting slamming on the\nbecause how hard is it to go on the into\nthe real world very difficult you have\nto push that gas a lot and very easy to\nslam on the brakes and the last thing be\ncareful about which things feed the mind\nso anytime you have a thought or a line\nof thinking that leads to more thought\nor line of thinking that is the wrong\nway to think this is literally what we\nhave here see they have all the\nobservations analysis paralysis what is\nanalysis paralysis it is thought that\nleads to more thought you think down\nthis way but that doesn't work so I'm\ngoing to think down this way and that\ndoesn't work so I don't actually act and\nas long as I don't act my mind continues\nto think you see it's it's the infinite\nmoney glitch again the the moment that I\nact there's resolution and then I don't\nget to play with the problem anymore the\ngame's over so in your life cultivate\nthings that lead to a resolution of\nthought not just an annihilation of\nthought I'm not saying go get high and\nget lost in Oblivion resolution of\nthought and then you may discover\nsomething but I don't know how to\nresolve my thoughts because there is no\nanswer oh interesting maybe you should\njust try something just do something get\nmore data because the data set that you\nhave you can't solve this equation right\nit's yxal ALS a you don't have enough\ndata but [ __ ] 25-year-old thinkers\nwill keep on playing around with it over\na equals B YX over b equals a and they\nkeep on like moving around the the\nnumbers around trying to figure out okay\nlike YX / AB equal 1 okay that's\ninteresting right and yall keep on\nplaying around with it and you just\ndon't have enough data so then you don't\nlive in the world because you're scared\nof it and emotions and all the other\nstuff so look at the things that lead to\nresolution of thought and then do those\nthings and once you have resolution of\nthought followed by resolution of\nthought followed by resolution of\nthought you will have nothing left to\nthink about and you will be done being a\n25-year-old thinker yeah so someone's\nasking can you give us an example of\nannihilation versus resolution of\nthought please sure so I'll give you a\nsimple example let's say I don't know\nwhere my keys are so I can hypothesize\nabout where my keys are as much as I\nwant I can get so frustrated about where\nmy keys are and then I can decide to\njust obliv my thoughts by queuing up for\na video game and because in that hour\nthat I'm playing the video game I'm not\nthinking about where my keys are but the\nmoment that I stop playing the video\ngame the thoughts return so when you\nchange your internal state to get rid of\nthoughts the thoughts are just waiting\nto come back they don't really go away\nthey just get put on pause so resolution\nof the thought is to find the keys\nbecause then there's no thought left so\nmost resolution of thought or not most\nsome of it comes from action but some of\nit also comes from acceptance so if I'm\nlike oh my God like let's say I'm I I\nwant to I need to tell my partner that\nthis relationship is not working for me\nit's not that I want to break up but\nthat I'm unhappy in the relationship\nlet's say you're faced with this problem\nand so what people will do is they'll\nrun through all kinds of scenarios in\ntheir head if I say this then they could\nbe upset and then they could be upset\nand then how do I how do I say this to\nthem without making them upset see\nthat's where the problem is see the\nmoment that your mind says I want this\noutcome without someone being upset how\ndo I make a million dollars without\nspending any effort how do I break the\nnews without hurting their feelings so\nif you're really careful this is what\nparalyzes us anytime our mind is\nunwilling to accept the consequences of\nour actions your mind will be paralyzed\nand you can you can find this very very\nvery easily just pay attention to your\nthoughts that are dodging a consequence\nyou're looking for some kind of\nperfection how do I do this without this\ndoing this oh that's that's not hard but\nI want to do it without this other thing\nhow do I break the news to them without\nhurting their feelings I'm not saying\ngoing around and being an [ __ ] but\nI'm saying that you can't necessarily\ncontrol the feelings of another person\nI'm not saying that you should act\nwithout compassion and so if you pay\nattention to your mind all these caveats\nthat you add in your own thinking you\ncan literally write down your thoughts\nand you'll see this all the time then\nwhat you have to do is accept that\nthat's a potential consequence and then\nyou have to decide okay if I want to act\nthis could happen right so someone I I\nrecently wrote a book Joel should really\ncheck out it's a good book teaches you\nhow to talk to people bonus if you've\ngot young kids or nieces or nephews\nbecause it also teaches you how to teach\nthem healthy video game habits but\nreally it's the best guide to\ncommunication that I've written so far\nand all the communication stuff works\nfor just about any relationship I wrote\nthis book and someone asked me the\nquestion as it was about to be released\nare you nervous and I said no and they\nwere surprised by that they were like\nwhat if it doesn't do well I was like\nthen it doesn't do well see if I was\nworried the right time to be worried\nabout whether the book does well or not\nis when I'm writing it after it's\nwritten that ship is sailed right so the\nmoment that I decided to write a book I\nopened myself up to the consequence of\nwriting a shitty book if you want to\navoid writing a shitty book 100% the\nbest way to do it is not write one oh\nshocking look at what we did we chose\nnot to write one see the only way to\ntruly protect yourself from failure is\nto never try I'm going to tell y'all\nsomething pretty wild okay I have a 0%\nloss rate in Street Fighter 6 I have a\n0% loss rate in Minecraft I have a 0%\nloss rate I've never lost a game of CSO\nnever not a single game this is what\nhappens when you're the 25-year-old\nthinker you're shooting for that\nPerfection but that's not something you\ncan get so the moment that you act you\nopen yourself up to failure and you just\naccept that right then you try to do\neverything that you can to make it as\nsuccessful as possible not everything\nthat you can everything that you're\nwilling to do because I could have made\nthe book better if I was willing to make\nadditional sacrifices but I made enough\nsacrifices and so this is the resolution\nof thought comes through acceptance so\nyou just accept Okay I'm going to try to\nsay this in As Nice of a way that as I\nas I can but feelings may be hurt right\nso the moment that you started dating\nsomeone is the moment that both of y'all\nopened yourself up to particular\nfeelings being hurt all right so once\nyou board the ship the waves can be\nchoppy\n[Music]"
