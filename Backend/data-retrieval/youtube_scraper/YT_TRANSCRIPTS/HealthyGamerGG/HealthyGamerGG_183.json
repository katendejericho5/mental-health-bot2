psychiatrist hi my name is Alo\nkenoa I'm a psychiatrist but just a\nreminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if y all have a medical concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional stream is unfortunately not\na substitute for medical advice hate to\nbreak it to\ny'all um so next up let's look at\nsomething real real quick real quick\nhold on let me find\nwhere's no no okay there we go okay\nlet's see can I pop this chat out okay\npop out\nchat then I\ndon't need you\nanymore there we go okay so now I've got\nchat open thank you so much all right\nhappy Monday everybody today we've got\nsome fun stuff to talk about we're going\nto be looking at ADHD in Doomer related\nthings we're going to dive into a couple\nof scientific things maybe a touch of\nspirituality here or there I'm super\nexcited about the stuff that we're going\nto be talking about today thank you all\nso much for coming um we have a couple\nof announcements before we kind of get\ninto it okay so first announcement is\nit's hilarious so uh I love this\ncommunity and honestly if you were to\nask me like why do you love this\ncommunity Dr K I could say something\nlike oh my God I love it because it's\nfull of positivity and I love it because\npeople are so good like people are oh my\nGod they try so hard oh my God it's so\ngreat if only that were true chat you\nmust remember that despite all of my\ntrappings despite my the Cosmetics that\nI wear despite the way that I attire\nmyself I am at the end of the day one of\ny'all and what I love more about this\nCommunity than anything else is the\nmemes so 10 years ago stop eating junk\nfood and go outside F you Mom and Dad 10\nyears later stop Fe eating jump food and\ngo outside everyone's like oh my God\nthat's\ngenius right that's what we do here we\njust repackage stuff that your parents\ntold you to do and because it's me\nsaying it and I drop an F\nbomb y'all like it and you listen and\nthat's the end of things by the way I\ndon't know if youall noticed this but\nwe're not in one of the top 2% of sub\nrats we used to be like top\n5% and we've grown we're like doing\npretty good chat good\njob um that's the first thing we're\ngoing to talk about second thing we're\ngoing to talk about is clickbait so I\nmade the mistake of making a video and\nthe video is entitled why you shouldn't\nresist watching porn and people\nunderstandably um the the video I guess\nis doing pretty well cuz it was uploaded\nlike I don't know like a week ago and\nit's got 700,000 views I don't quite\nunderstand what this comment means by\nthe way so if youall could explain this\nto me that would be great um therapist\nwhen the credit card gets declined I\ndon't I don't know why this has 19,000\nup\nvotes but everyone is I I can somebody\nexplain this to me like what does this\nmean um we're going to talk about\nclickbait in a second but I I don't know\nwhat that\nmeans literally like I I don't I mean I\nshould\nknow um\nso so this is once again one of those\nthings where it's like even though I try\nto be one of y'all um it's really\nchallenging\nto oh you take the service back okay but\nwhat what does that have to do with the\nvideo I'm\nconfused oh implying your okay I see I\nsee I see I see I see okay thank you so\nmuch for explaining it chat I thank you\nI would be lost without y'all y'all are\ngreat um so let me just talk for a\nsecond about\nclickbait so some people saw the title\nof this video and they were like this\nvideo is super clickbait until you watch\nit and you know the video's I I guess\nit's good right so I I think that like I\nI think when we make videos that are\nclickbait that are like just clickbait\nright so it's clickbait like the idea is\nthat like you think there's something of\nvalue in there when you open it up\nthere's nothing of value that's what\nclickbait is it's a scam but in this\nvideo especially like I think the reason\nit's doing so well is because there's\nlike a lot of good stuff in it and so it\nlooks like a clickbait title and it kind\nof makes sense but like literally that's\nwhat the video is about there's this\nreally fascinating principle of\naddiction that if you resist a craving\nso if you resist like a level five\ncraving and then like your body goes up\nto a level eight craving and then you\nfail at resisting that higher level of\ncraving what the body does over time is\nincreases straight to eight so so it's\nlike five doesn't get us what we need so\nwe're going to go straight to eight this\nlike this is like a science thing okay\nit's like we know this so the video\ntalks about that and literally if we\nlook at like you know I don't know if\nthis kind of makes sense but sometimes\nwhat happens when you're addicted to\nsomething is that if you fight every\nsingle\nbattle like you're going to be\ncognitively exhausted and you're not\ngoing to win all of them and losing a\nsingle one strangely enough like can can\ncreate such big problems it's a really\nweird concept\nso here's kind of how we see it the\nfirst is we're going to title things in\na way that that is geared to provide\npeople with the information that we are\ntrying to disseminate like we're going\nto title things to try to help people\nthat being said we recognize that there\nis clickbait out there and that we are\nsomewhat guilty of that and so we take\nthat very seriously we appreciate yall's\nfeedback very seriously I was super\nsurprised I mean I think it makes sense\nbut I really did not when I was making\nthis video I was not thinking about\nclickbait I was like this is a really\nimportant principle that people need to\nunderstand that is Mindless resistance\ncan sometimes lead to the wrong\nconclusion and if y all like remember\ngrowing up and your parents would just\nfight you every single time you wanted\nto play a video game or every single\ntime you wanted to do this they were\njust resisting resisting resisting\nresisting resisting you resisting you\nresisting you it doesn't end up in the\nright direction which is really weird\nthing right because we think oh like you\nhave to resist all the time so like\nfocal targeted resistance is what really\nleads to like good outcomes in my\nexperience so this was not attempting to\nbe clickbait this was like and that's\nwhy I think the video does well is\nbecause like I I sort of explained that\nand people like oh that's really\ninteresting and I think it helps people\na lot which is what we're here for so\nwe're going to continue titling things\nthat way at the same time we recognize\nthat our titles can be clickbait and so\nwe are working on mitigating that right\nso we're not going to make\nI think I hope we're not going to make\nsuper click baity titles and also we're\ngoing to start adding like uh more\ndetailed description uh either in a\npinned comment or in the video\ndescription about what the video is\nactually about so if y'all are concerned\nthat like because we the problem is that\nwe only have like six words or something\nlike that right like that's we have to\nencapsulate the whole video in six words\nso that's very hard to do like I'm\n[ __ ] longwinded chat like that's\nyou know so so so we're going to try to\nfix that so for those of y'all For Whom\nthe clickbait is bothersome we apologize\nand also you'll find a more detailed\ndescription of what the video is about\nthat is\nmore justifiably explained in a pin\ncomment or description a couple of other\nthings that we're working on are\ncitations so this is where it's kind of\nlike complicated\nbut so when we make a video there aren't\nparticular citations for that video okay\nso just to give you all an example hold\non\none so like the way that we do research\nhere at HG is it's not like we set out\nto make a video and then we do research\non that topic and then like all of those\npieces of research are go into the video\nwhat happens is we will thoroughly\nthoroughly research and continue to\nresearch topics so for example like if\nyall let me just pull something up um\njust to show you all real\nquick hold on a second we're going to\nget to ADHD Doomer real quick don't\nworry\nchat okay so if we look at this for\nexample\num so like the way that we do research\nat HG is we'll like we'll look at a lot\nof research right so this is like\nfunctional neuro anatomy of pleasure and\nhappiness nucleus accumbent modulation\nreward and aversion um like Raji yog\nmeditation induces gray matter volume\nchanges in regions that process reward\nand\nhappiness the structural neural\nsubstrate of subjective happiness\nnucleus encumbrance comprehensive review\nneurochemistry of the nucleus succumbent\nand its relevance to depression and\nanti-depressant action in in rodents and\nthen the nucleus succumbent an interface\nbetween cognition emotion and action so\nthe way that we do research at HG is\nit's not like we do research for a\nspecific video we will comprehensively\nlook at a particular topic and then what\nhappens is like if I make a video on\ndepression and I'll read let's say I've\nread let's say over the last year\nprobably pretty accurate estimate let's\nsay 50 art or let's use trauma so over\nthe last year and a half I've read about\n400 peer-reviewed articles on trauma\nnow anytime we make a video on\ntrauma like we don't necessarily have a\nbibliography for that video so instead\nwhat we're going to do is share with\ny'all the way that we actually do like\nour research so we're developing a web\npage that has all of our citations based\non a particular\ntopic and then what tends to happen is\nlike if I read like 10 papers right what\nI'll do is like I'll use six of those\npapers in one video and then I'll use\ntwo of those same six plus these\nadditional four plus two video two uh\nthings about some other topic and like\nthat'll be it for the next one so we\nlike read a lot of stuff and I think the\ncitations in every video is not really\nworking out well for us like because\nthat's not practically how we do it so\nwe recognize that people like citations\nand they want further reading so we're\ndeveloping a resource for that it'll\nprobably start out like a web page that\ngets continuously updated and part of\nthe other reason that we want to do that\nis we're do building building this as a\nresource so like why do people like\ncitations I mean I I don't know why yall\nlike citations but generally speaking I\nthink of citations as hey I want to\nlearn more about this topic so what is\nthe most useful thing for us to do for\nyall as a community it's like if you're\nlike hey I want to understand ADHD and\nobesity we're like okay cool here's a\nbunch of papers about that topic that\nyou all can take a look at on your own\nso we're we're working on that stuff\ncouple of points one is just that we we\ntake this feedback very seriously so\nwhen yall post stuff like this like you\nknow we're working on it we're working\non it um and thank youall very much for\nthe feedback right so for the clickbait\ntitles like I I get that there's some\ncon concerns about it we're continuously\ntrying to find the balance\nbetween making a title\nthat gets people interested in the\ninformation that we're offering and\nmaking a title that\nis accurate to the content of the video\nI happen to think that this porn\naddiction one is actually like pretty\naccurate like that's what the video is\nlike literally about the downside to\nresisting cravings and a mechanism that\nmany people don't understand which is I\nthink part of the reason why people\nstruggle with addiction so much we don't\nknow how it really affects our brain so\nthat's by the way what we're going to be\ntalking about today but not addiction so\nwe're going to be talking about\num uh like ADHD Doomer related stuff\nokay so got a a lot of cool posts to\ntalk about um one other thing speaking\nof trauma so we you know we our trauma\nguide is like available for pre-order\nnow finally so I started working on this\nthing like two and a half years two\nyears ago let's say I think our last\nguide came out maybe in 2022 so we've\nbeen working on this for about two years\num and that's how long it takes to build\none like it's not it's not like a quick\noneandone kind of thing so it's\navailable for pre-order y'all can use\nthe command exclamation point trauma to\ncheck it out um it's I mean I say this\nfor every guide that I write but it's\nthe one that I'm the most proud of In\nThis Moment like so you know that's what\nthat's what gets me excited about things\nand stuff like that um I think it's\nreally great I think it's a guide really\nabout so what I got super excited about\nabout the trauma guide is that we don't\nknow we don't know how we get shaped\nright so like here's you and you exist\nin this present moment with all of your\ndifficulties all of your challenges all\nof your advantages all of your passions\nall of your perceptions with how you\nperceive the world so like you are\ncrafted based on your\ncircumstances and what I love about the\nscience of trauma I'm not saying trauma\nis a good thing but if you look at the\nscience of trauma the science of trauma\nis the best example of how a human being\ngets formed because you have this event\nand then we investigate what is the\nimpact of this event on this person's\nsense of identity on their thoughts on\ntheir behaviors on their physiology on\ntheir nervous\nsystem their brain like how do events\nshape people and so what we've tried to\ndo in the trauma guide is we use the\nlens of trauma but we can deduce\nprinciples of how people get formed into\nthe version that they are what is the\nprocess through making this person and\nour our hope is that\nin understanding these processes you can\ncraft\nyourself into the kind of person that\nyou want to or uncraft yourself away\nfrom the person that you are and so we\nwe did a ton of research I've done a ton\nof work on trauma it's been one of the\nmost fascinating like I love it from a\nclinical perspective it's kind of weird\nlike I I love a lot of the things that\nmany of my colleagues run away from\nwhich is like personality disorders\naddictions and Trauma those are like\nthree of my favorite clinical things to\nkind of focus\non um and so then they're all tied\ntogether ADHD is up there too so if\nyou'all want to check it out please\ncheck it out it's made with a lot of\neffort a lot of love it's taken us two\nyears and and it's not just me that's\nbeen working on it like there's a whole\num you know we have like a whole\ncreative process with a production\ncompany and they were really really\nhelpful and they're super awesome um and\nand then we've also got like you know\npeople who are like are are our D the\npeople on our our Dev team are like\ndesigning this stuff from the ground up\nand like there's a lot of effort and\nlove that goes into it and it's made for\nyall so it's not once again it's not a\nsubstitute for clinical treatment but\nthat's not what it's designed to be\nright this is about helping yall\nunderstand the principles through which\na human being is shaped and if you\nunderstand it's kind of like PC Master\nrace for humans right so like if you\nlook at PC Master race and building your\nyour own computer if you want to create\na certain PC you need to know like how\nall the parts fit together\nthe problem is no one teaches us that\nand interestingly enough it's not like\nChild Development and things like that\nthat I find the most fascinating about\nhow a human being is developed it's\nactually trauma because those are the\nindividual events that shape us right so\nthis is like it's kind of like how the\nsource code of who you are is laid down\nthrough experience and how to undo some\nof that stuff which is just super\nfascinating research I mean it's like\nmindblowing the clinical implications of\nlike some of these papers and stuff like\nthat\nanyway so definitely check it out but\nenough of\nthat\num and and the reason that I like it is\nbecause I think that's actually what our\ncommunity needs right so everyone if you\nlook at like even the post that we we're\ngoing to look at today everyone's like\nhow do I fix this problem and the answer\none version of the answer is almost\nalways understand how you got into this\nproblem in the first place how did you\nwire in this way right cuz everyone and\nthen like once you understand saying the\nfundamentals of wiring then you can like\nwire into whatever you want so that's\nwhat we're really optimistic about we\nwant to give you all some tools for that\nI'm not suggesting that you can watch\nthe guide and transform yourself into\nanything that you want to um but you\nknow I think it's like it's certainly a\nbig step in the right\ndirection and uh yeah I guess it's also\nlike since you know PC Master race over\nhere I was almost thinking about it like\nassembling a PC which is something that\nI stopped doing a couple years ago\nsag but you know I just couldn't keep up\nand instead I decided to for the LA\nsometime around 2010 I decided to start\nfocusing on instead of building PCS\nbuilding people and how that works and\nthat was a lot of fun it's been great\nit's been\ngreat okay\num all right so we've got a couple\nthings to talk about today\nokay so we're going to give youall a\nchoice all right I give you choice I\ngive Choice\nchat we're going to talk about a couple\nthings today oh that doesn't I don't\nlike it when this happens where I'm\nzooming out and the picture is getting\nlarger what so weird what what\nShenanigans is this okay the night\nbefore a day off is more satisfying than\nthe actual day off we're going to talk\nabout\nthat um why does this always happen\nafter a good head clearing walk 5 hours\ninto the walk my potential knows no\nbounds I will accomplish greater Feats\nthan any man before me I will or woman I\nwill uncover every last secret of the\nuniverse I will experience every\npossible emotion and never die I will\nturn my life around the moment I get\nhome and then 10 minutes after getting\nhome\ndamn and the Eternal ADHD Doomer\ninvoluntary switches between an\ninvoluntarily switches between being an\nUnstoppable force and an immovable\nobject writes reminders to himself and\ndoesn't read them wonders whether he's\nthe RW lazy or both gets got nothing\ndone all day still feels overwhelmed and\nexhausted can't trust his own judgment\netc etc so we're going to talk about all\nthree of these this last one we'll get\nto if we have time but I want to ask\nyall what do you all want to do\nfirst okay looks like a lot of people\nwant 5H hour\nwalk\ngreat\nokay\n[Music]\nso five okay we'll get to all three of\nthem all\nright yeah so it's the title uh go over\ntopics again okay so here are our\nchoices I'm going to try to make this\npoll Dr K attempts\npoll you're alive I'm aware I'm aware\nthat I'm live I figured that out but\nthanks for letting me know okay let's do\npoll oh\ngreat okay so ADHD Doomer is\nwinning thank you so much mods for being\nthere for me when I wasn't there for\nmyself y'all are the okay great and then\nlet's\nsee um How do I\nsee okay poll is up yeah I see that how\ndo I see the I I'm seeing number\ntwo so looks like ADHD okay so sounds\nlike people no surprise people want the\ntopic\nof okay how do I close this poll 1,000\nvotes I'm going to close the\npoll okay poll ended\nall right so okay so let's start with\nADHD great let's do it chat we're going\nto get to all three of them don't worry\nwe've got time all right okay so we're\ngoing to talk a little bit\nabout the Eternal ADHD Doomer okay so\nwhat we're going to actually do today is\ngo over each of these\nfeatures understand why they happen what\nthe Neuroscience vulnerabilities are\nwhat goes on in ADHD that predisposes us\nto this\nand the real challenge that we're going\nto discover is that one of the biggest\nproblems with ADHD is not the symptoms\nthemselves one of the biggest problems\nwith ADHD is our adaptations to the\nsystems so sorry the the symptoms so the\none of the biggest problems that I see\nin ADHD is that you're living a life\nwith ADHD and the world is designed for\nneurotypical kids they're not designed\nfor you and what this means is that you\nhave to develop compensatory strategies\nin order to succeed like chugging a\ngallon of caffeine before you get\nanything done the problem is that the\ncompensatory strategies that you develop\nactually cause problems later in life so\nreally good example of this is if you\nall play games at low rank what you will\ndiscover is that people at low rank do\nstupid things and then you ask someone\nat low rank why do you do this stupid\nthing like the the classic thing that I\ntend to see a lot in the multiplayer\ngame I play is playing a support role\nlike playing a support character in a\nnon-support role so you're like because\nit in in my rank like you can't play\nreal support because everyone sucks so\nyou need to have like a good player to\nteam up with in order to play this thing\nthe way it's supposed to be played and\ninstead what I'm going to do is play in\nsome way that only works at my low rank\nMMR and then what tends to happen in\nthis situation as you play this weird we\nstrategy that kind of sometimes works in\nyour time because you try doing it the\nregular way and that doesn't appe appear\nto work right that's just like ADHD and\nneurotypical I try to do it the\nneurotypical way the way that everyone\nis says that you're supposed to doesn't\nwork for me so I have to come up with my\nown\nadaptation but then what ends up\nhappening is that you are training\nyourself in habits that as you climb\nranks as you improve in life start to\ncreate more problems and so a lot of\nwhat I see in DHD is a lot of unlearning\nthat has to be done and the biggest\nchallenge here especially when we look\nat a lot of these\nadaptations is that sometimes we'll do\nthings to win a particular game but it\nforms the wrong habits in the long term\nand if you stop and think for a second\nabout see anytime you develop a good\nhabit the development of the good habit\nis not an advantage at the very\nbeginning the development of a good\nhabit comes at a cost with very little\nreward does that make sense so like if I\nstart exercising regularly the first\nthree months are going to suck there's\nno there's no reward it's just torture\nfor the first three months the reward\nhappens later and this fundamental\nprinciple of habit building that it\ncomes at a cost at the beginning so\nanother good example is using a\ncalendar so if I start using a calendar\nat the very beginning I'm remembering\neverything in my head and using a\ncalendar doesn't actually benefit me\nusing a calendar benefits me once I get\ninto the habit of it so in training good\nhabits comes at a very high cost at the\nbeginning and brains with ADHD are\nparticularly vulnerable to that so let's\ntake a quick look at why this\nhappens okay I'm G to mute myself so I\nthink this is Russell\nBarkley how explains to these parents\nthis child can play video games for\nhours and cannot do homework for more\nthan a few minutes as the video game\nprovides external continuous 100%\nconsequences for interacting with it and\nthe homework does nothing when a problem\nis solved on a sheet of paper nothing\nhappens the consequences are delayed and\ntherein lies the trouble so the coral\nare of this is if you want to see an\nADHD person fail put him in any\nenvironment where there are no\nconsequences\nand I guarantee you failure will not get\ndone because the person cannot self\nmotivate and this is not a choice and\nthis is not willful and this is not a\nchild who just would if they wished wake\nup tomorrow and smell the coffee and get\nbusy and do the work they cannot this is\nan internal neurogenetic executive\nfailure you can't self-motivate like\nother people so it doesn't matter what\nyour goals are you won't get there\nbecause self motivation is required the\nfourth\nexe all right so let's let's take a look\nat this okay so I think this is a great\ntake on\nADHD um and I think this principle leans\ninto a lot of these problems so what\nwe're actually going to start with is\njust like reading each of these out\nokay so\ninvoluntarily\nswitching between Unstoppable Force\nand immovable\nobject okay so we're going to explain\nwe're going to get into each of these in\ndetail okay abandons\nanything uh that they're not immediately\nsuccessful right and so thankfully Dr\nBarkley has already explained this St so\nwe'll we'll see these tired of people\ntelling him to just try harder even\nthough he knows they're right\ntry harder\nNoob okay WR reminders to\nhimself but doesn't read\nthem so we're going to break each of\nthese apart\nokay um spend weeks preparing for a\ntask preparing\nfor small\ntasks chugs gallon of\ncaffeine\nokay can't regulate\nemotions um wonders whether question\nlazy\nquestions\nstupid right uh watch this video on mute\nwhile listening to another all the while\ndistracted by thoughts so let's say\nsensory over\nsimulation okay um doesn't do anything\nno tasks\nfinished but still\ntired\nexhausted and then can't trust his own\njudgment okay so let's take a look at\nthese and understand each of them in\nturn Okay\nso we're going to the\ntop so let's start with this very simple\none of involuntarily switching between\nan Unstoppable force and an immovable\nobject so a lot of people think that\nADHD is about distraction that I cannot\nfocus my mind but if we really look at\nit what ADHD is a is is a\ndisorder of\nattention Okay now this is important to\nunderstand so when we say this is a\ndisorder of attention and we cover this\na lot in the guide to ADHD it's a\ncentral feature so disordered attention\nmeans that I'm not in control of my\nattention and if we look at the way that\nwe need to control our attention we need\ntwo fundamental capabilities to control\nour attention one is to shift our\nattention away from something when we\nneed to and the second is to shift our\nattention towards something when we need\nto so this is and it's disorder in both\ndirections and this is actually what\nleads to so much under diagnosis of ADHD\nso a lot of parents that I work with\nwill say okay my kid doesn't have ADHD\nhe can sit there and play Legos for 5\nhours without being disturbed he is\ncapable or she is capable of focusing\nfor long periods of time therefore they\ndo not have ADHD absolutely consistent\nwith\nADHD so people with ADHD struggle with\nhyperfocus which means they're still not\nin control of their attention if they\ntell their attention hey it's time to\nfocus on something else they're not able\nto do that what people are very familiar\nwith is the inability to focus on what\nyou want to so their mind is distracted\nin a thousand different places I can't\nget it to focus focus on one thing and\nthe opposite is true where once I focus\non this thing I cannot get it to deviate\nmy attention\nelsewhere this is also why kids with\nADHD get yelled at more and this will\ncome later as well so what parents will\noften times learn is that I require a\nlarger stimulus to break through their\nhyper Focus so you have to yell at your\nchildren to literally get their\nattention so this is important to\nunderstand so our brain has this part we\nhave this part of a brain called the\nthalamus and the thalamus integrates all\nkinds of sensory information and it\ntells us it brings certain sensory\ninformation to our attention so if I'm\nlike walking down the street and there's\na snake in the\npath something even though I'm seeing\nBlades of grass and birds and leaves and\nsunlight and cars and whatever I'm my\nbrain is receiving all of this sensory\nstimulus but I'm not aware of it\nthe thalamus comes in because it's\nintegrating all that information\nprocessing all that information and then\nit serves something up to you and it\nsays hey stop doing what you're doing\nbecause there's a snake here and then we\nnotice there's a snake and we jump so\nthis is the healthy way that our brain\nshould work where there is a normal\nbalance of being able to break our\nattention on one thing and be able to\nshift it to something else this is why\npeople with ADHD feel like they are\nalternating\nright and you don't get to control it by\nthe way between an Unstoppable force and\nan immovable object so you're able to\nhyperfocus on things and there are other\ntimes where it's impossible to get\nstarted and that is because we are not\nin control of our motiv our Attention\nour attention is way too disregulated it\ncan hyperfocus in some places and uh\nmake it impossible to focus in others\nokay so that's the first\nthing um second thing\nall right so abandons anything immediate\nunless it's immediately\nsuccessful\nunless okay so let's take a look at why\nthis is abandons anything he isn't\nimmediately good at why is this so Dr\nBarkley does a great job of explaining\nthis so let's understand this we have\nthis other part of our brain called the\nnucleus\nsuccumbent and if you look at people\nwith ADHD this is where our dopamine\nreward circuitry is\nand so what happens in the brain of\nsomeone with ADHD is that they are\nvulnerable to the nucleus succumbent so\nthis is important to understand so\nhere's our nucleus accumbens here are\nour frontal loes and generally speaking\nthere is a tug of war between these two\nthings so our frontal loes are the part\nof our brain that will tell us oh oh\n[ __ ] you guys can't see this\nwhoops I guess it doesn't whoops sorry\noh crap do I need to we do\nthis hold on\nchat\num let me look at this okay so let's\nI'll I'll just do this again so that\ny'all can see okay so let's go through\neach of these\nfeatures involuntary switches between an\nUnstoppable force and an immovable\nobject abandons anything he isn't\nimmediately good at tired of people\ntelling him to just try harder even\nthough he knows they're right writes\nreminders to himself and doesn't read\nthem spends weeks mentally preparing for\na task that takes 15 minutes to complete\nchugs caffeine by the gallon cannot\nregulate his emotions ruled by fear in\nfeelings of inadequacy wonders whether\nhe's [ __ ] lazy or both watches a\nvideo on mute while listening to another\nall while distracted by his own thoughts\nand got nothing done all day still feels\noverwhelmed and exhausted and can't\ntrust his own judgment so you know\nwhat's really funny about this there's a\ndecent chance I'm on the ADHD Spectrum\nin some way and this is like the perfect\nexample of my attention being so focused\non something that my Thalamus is not\ntelling me hey you haven't switched your\noverlay people can't see what you're\ntalking about they have no [ __ ] clue\nyou're in your own world just running\nfull speed Speed Ahead I become an\nUnstoppable force and y'all are not able\nto break into my Thalamus and alert me\nto the fact that you guys don't know\nwhat I'm talking about right this is\nclassic ADHD and we see it right here\nhilarious I couldn't have planned this\nbetter\nokay\nso let's kind of go back to this all\nright so this is a disorder of\nattention now let's go back to abandons\nanything unless it's immediately\nsuccessful so we have our nucleus\naccumbens which is over here this our\ndopamine reward circuitry and then we\nhave our frontal opes so when these two\nthings interact with each other there's\na tension so the frontal loes are\nresponsible for something called\nexecutive\nfunction okay hold on a second move this\naround a little\nbit\nokay looks like we lost the X there we\ngo okay so executive function is the\nability to plan and execute\ntasks which usually involves delayed\ngratification whereas the nucleus\naccumbens is responsible for immediate\ngratification so it's like let's say I'm\nhaving a sandwich and someone asks me or\nlike I'm having a burger and someone\nasks me do you want fries and and a\ndrink with that and so my frontal loes\nare like those are unhealthy for me I\nshould not have those things and my\nnucleus accumbens is like hell yeah\nlet's go so what we tend to find is that\nthere is a development of these two\nparts of our brain the nucleus\nsuccumbent develops very very rapidly\nit's very very potent in kids the\nfrontal loes develop more slowly so they\ndevelop until somewhere between the age\nof 25 and\n35 some literature will say that the\nnucle I mean the executive function kind\nof maps a maxes out around 25 that\nhasn't been my clinical\nexperience so there studies about this\nthat are a little bit dated but I think\nwe actually mature well into our\n30s so game's not over for y'all if\nyou're like 27 and your frontal loes are\nscuffed it's still okay we'll be okay\ndon't worry about it so what happens in\nADHD is that the balance between these\ntwo things is it's\nimbalanced our nucleus accumbent is\nrelatively speaking stronger than our\nfrontal loes and this is what Dr Barkley\nis talking about so like we need some\nkind of immediate gratification in order\nto reinforce the behavior and we really\nstruggle with delayed\ngratification now when Dr Barkley says\nthat this task is impossible that's\nwhere I disagree a little bit so I think\neffort is really important to understand\nand we'll get to that in a second we\ngoing to talk about try hard or Noob but\nthis is not hopeless so just to give\nyouall a couple of different examples\nokay so I think it's it's fair to say\nthat at default this task is very very\ndifficult for people with ADHD but we\nknow there are a couple of good points\none is that we know that Psychotherapy\nfor ADHD is just as effective as\nmedication we can see vast improvements\nin clinical symptoms through the\nimplementation of psychotherapy and\nPsychotherapy for ADHD is a b basically\nlike brain training it's like training\nyour brain to adapt to your\ncircumstances in a healthy way that\nallows you to achieve what you want to\nachieve without too high of a cost right\nso this training is really slow so the\nreason that we don't do it automatically\nis because we sort of figure out\nadaptations and this is the real\nchallenge with ADHD is the only\nadaptations that we're capable of making\nare the ones that give us immediate\nreward so I want you all to think about\nthat for a second right this is what's\nreally crippling about ADHD for people\nin life is that you can't make an\nadaptation that doesn't work right away\nwith which is exactly how we get\nto things like gallons of chugs of C\ncaffeine by the gallon because any kind\nof habit that will lead to success over\ntime is not something that your brain\nsees the reward from so this is really\nimportant to understand okay so when we\nwhen we do an\naction when we anytime we take an action\nat some point the action is rewarded\nOkay so I'll give you all just a let's\ndraw this out and understand this this\nis the real challenge with\nADHD so let's say I take an action at\ntime point\nt0 and then there is a lag and at time\nlet's say T1 which is let's say 5\nminutes or T2 which is 50\nminutes or T3 which is 5 days\nso if we look at something like\nexercising what we find is that the\naction takes place over here but the\nreward may be over\nhere and so our nucleus accumbens looks\nat the consequences of our actions and\nthen if the reward is over here it will\ngo back and reinforce this action the\nproblem with ADHD is that these two\nthings are not available to\nus because of the way that our nucleus\nsuccumbent Works unless unless it gives\nus an instant benefit we cannot\nreinforce that\nbehavior so I was working a video game\ncompany asked for my help and they said\nDr K can you help us make a more\npositive\ncommunity and I said\nsure and so then I asked them how do\nyall address toxicity and they say that\nokay we have this reporting system and\nthe reporting system happens and then\nsomeone files a report and then it goes\nthrough this process and then we take\naction on the report I said what's the\namount of time between the action and\nthe the the the mistake or the thing\nthat the the toxic behavior that the\nplayer makes and the consequence from\nthat behavior what's the time lag in\nthat space and they're like somewhere\nbetween two weeks and two\nmonths and I was like this is never\ngoing to work so I want youall to think\nabout this for a second let's say I play\na video game today I you up for a game\nand I'm a toxic\n[ __ ] and then sometime randomly like\n52 days later I log into my account one\nday ban banned [ __ ] what do you think\nmy reaction is going to\nbe do you think I'm going to learn from\nmy\nmistakes what do you think is going to\nhappen to my toxicity you think I'm\ngoing to be better I'm going to be like\noh my God I made this mistake oh a pool\nof my teammates oh my God my with your\nteammates I hurt their feelings oh no I\nhurt their feelings I need to be a\nbetter person I be a nicer person yeah\ni' be better i' be nicer I no longer be\ntoxic no\nno no doesn't work like that imagine if\nyou're potty training your dog and your\ndog pisses the bed and you come back 48\ndays later and you're like bad dog the\ndog is\nlike what\nwhat this is the problem with ADHD we\nneed immediate consequences this is is\nwhy people with ADHD and the reason we\nneed immediate consequence is because of\nthe brain the way the brain is wired so\nwe are so sensitive to this dopamine\ncircuitry and dopamine doesn't get\ndelayed reward it's not like when you\nhave an epic game and you win you're\nlike oh my God the team is winning we're\ngoing to lose then you make some last\nminute comeback and you win it's not you\nlike you wake up 28 Days Later and\nyou're just like wow that game was so\nmuch fun oh my God Rush of dopamine\nrandomly 28 Days Later it's not how it\nworks there's a Time\nbinding there's a temporal binding\nbetween the action being taken and the\nreward being given and people with ADHD\nare more sensitive to that temporal\nbinding which means that they need\nimmediate\nrewards which in turn means that they\nare not capable of implementing\nlong-term plans that will benefit their\nlives without help because every single\nstep requires a dopaminergic reward\nthat's why it's impossible for them to\ndo homework that's why it's impossible\nfor them to study because all they see\nis the effort and they do not see a\nreward\nokay\nso let me think do I want to include\nanything else does this make\nsense so I'm going to just talk about\nhabit formation again so this is why\npeople with ADHD so the real challenge\nthis is what's so frustrating about\nADHD the the one part of the brain not\nthe one but one of the parts of the\nbrain that is actually unaffected by\nADHD is habit circuitry so people with\nADHD are generally speaking capable of\nforming habits so this is a completely\ndifferent part of the brain it's the\nendoc canabo system this is how we form\nhabits the problem is that even though\nthat circuitry is\nintact the way in which we form habits\ninvolves the nucleus accumbent does that\nkind of make sense I don't know if you\nall understand the difference between\nthe two so once it a habit is laid down\nthe Habit is just as accessible to\nsomeone who has\nADHD but the laying down of the Habit is\nalmost impossible because in order for\nthe Habit to be laying down we need an\nimmediate reward so what do we end up\nseeing this is why people with ADHD get\nstuck in video games and other forms of\naddictive substances because their\ncapability of forming a habit their\nability to pour concrete is their\nconcrete solidifies just as well as a\nneurotypical persons the problem is the\nway in which they can pour concrete is\ndictated by their dopam energic system\nso the only time I will pour concrete is\nif I get an immediate reward so their\nhabit capability is normal but the\nhabits that they are capable of forming\nare very restricted to dopaminergic\nreinforcement which is why they get so\naddicted to video games because as you\nplay a video game day after day after\nafter day after day after day you're\npouring concrete pouring concrete\npouring concrete but you only get to\npour concrete in this one\nplace all of the other attempts to pour\nconcrete to make walkways driveways\nfreeways that doesn't work the only\nthing we can do is fill up our toilet\nand fill up our sink with concrete and\nthis is what happens with people with\nADHD they get addicted to games very\neasily there's vulnerability to the\nnucleus accumbens and dopamine that is\nabsolutely there but it's so much more\ncomplicated in that this is what's\nbeautiful about the science of ADHD we\nlearn we know so much more okay so it's\nyou can form habits\nbut which habits you are formed are\ncontrolled by the dopaminergic reward so\nif you get an immediate reward then that\nwill become habitual for you very easily\nokay so let's move on\nnext so this is why we abandon anything\nthat you're not immediately good at\nbecause there's no immed Med dope\nanderic reward which means that we\ncannot engage in the behavior again\ntired of people telling him to just try\nharder even though he knows they're\nright so this is a huge problem okay\nwe've talked about this quite a bit we\nmade a whole video about ADHD and\ndepression which yall should definitely\ncheck out this is a huge part of Dr K's\nguide to ADHD as\nwell so there's this idea in ADHD that\nmore effort will yield better returns\nand so so what often times happens in\nADHD is we see a\nmisdiagnosis because people notice oh\nthis person is capable of focusing this\nperson is intelligent and if they are\nintelligent and capable and the behavior\ndoesn't happen what's missing lazy\nthere's a lack of effort so you need to\nput forth more effort this is\nincorrect effort doesn't work if you do\nnot have the tools necessary this is\nlike telling someone who's missing a leg\nif you try hard\nyou should be able to\nwalk right the difference between\nsomeone who's missing a leg and someone\nwho has ADHD is the missing leg is\nvisible to everybody else but the ADHD\ndeficit is in your brain it's not\nvisible to anyone in fact they see\nparticular things that make you think\nthat you're neurotypical like IQ they\nrecognize that you're not\nstupid but you don't have the\ntools necessary for the effort to\nsuffuse right so if we think about\neffort effort is energy it's like\nelectricity but electricity requires a\ncircuit board to go through to manifest\nsomething so what happens is everyone is\nlooking at your house and they're saying\nthere's no lights on inside you need\nmore electricity but you have plenty of\nelectricity there's no light bulb so you\ncan have all the electricity in the\nworld but if there is nothing for the\nelect electricity to flow through you\nwill not get the result so this is the\nproblem in ADHD it's not a lack of\neffort then what happens is everyone\ndoesn't see this right they don't\nunderstand that you don't have light\nbulbs so they say you need to jack up\nthe electricity jack up the electricity\njack up the electricity and so then you\nend up doing that but you can jack up\nthe electricity as much as you want to\nbut if there's no light bulb there's\ngoing to be no light and this is where\nwe get to a lot of these other\nmanifestations okay gets nothing done\nall day still feels overwhelmed and\nexhausted wonders whether he's [ __ ]\nlazy or both these are all parts of the\nsame thing so then what happens is when\nwe recognize I'm putting in a lot of\neffort and you feel exhausted imagine\nfor a second what the conclusion is so\nif I'm pumping in effort right and this\nis another great example right here\nspends weeks mentally preparing for a\ntask that takes 15 minutes to complete\nso when I look at other humans who are\ncapable of finishing a 15-minute task in\n15 minutes and it takes me weeks and\ntons of effort and everyone is telling\nme to put in lots of effort just think\nabout this equation for a\nsecond what is the only logical\nconclusion is that I'm messed up in some\nway I'm\ncursed I'm defective right because I'm\nputting in so much effort I'm so\nexhausted at the end of the day it's so\neasy for everybody else and it makes\nsense right because if you're putting in\nall this effort and you're not able to\ndo things and it's so hard for you to do\nordinary stuff then the only conclusion\nis you're just as smart as they are so\nyou must be lazy you must be dumb in\nsome way you must be busted in some way\nthis is the conclusion that people have\nand if you look at studies of comorbid\npopulations from ADHD and\ndepression people who are diagnosed with\ndepression have a 3% chance to develop\nADHD later in life\nbut if you are diagnosed with ADHD you\nhave a 70% chance of developing\ndepression later in life\nwhy it's because of this it's because\nyou look at the world you assume that\nyou're neurotypical you put in lots of\neffort you try as hard as you can and\nyou are unable to gain the result and so\nthe only possibility I don't know if\nthis kind of makes\nsense right so like if I look\nat here's me or let's say here's a\nnormal person here's a neurotypical\nperson they put in 10 units of\neffort and they get 10 units of\nreward but if you have\nADHD you put in 10 units of effort and\nyou get one unit of\nreward so what's the only way that you\ncan\noh hold on okay so if you're\nneurotypical\n10 units of effort gets 10 units of\nreward and if you have ADHD 10 units of\neffort gets one unit of reward what's\nthe only way to make this equation work\nyou need a minus 9 over here of some\nkind doesn't matter I don't know if I'm\nlazy I don't know if I'm pathetic it's\nsome kind of negative\nquality right it's the only way to make\nit work and this is their observation\ntheir brain their ability to calculate\nis completely\nintact right so they they understand\nthis people with ADHD get this and this\nis what ends up leading to things like\nself-esteem\nproblems because what other explanation\nis there because people with it's it's\nreally sad kids with ADHD have a very\ngood intuitive sense of their IQ the PE\nthe adults around them have a very good\nintuitive sense of their IQ we're very\ngood as human beings of being able to\ntell like who is in the bottom cortile\nof IQ who is in the top cortile of IQ\nand like who's in the middle like we're\nnot great at detecting like let's say\n130 versus 140 or 140 versus 150 or 70\nversus 80 or things like that but we can\ntell if you're above aund like\nsignificantly above 100 around 100 or\nbelow 100 and the real tragedy of people\nwith ADHD is that they know that they're\nlike just as smart as the kids around\nthem which means that there must be\nsomething else wrong because the effort\nthat they put in does not yield a normal\namount of\nreward\nOkay so\nthis\nprinciple then what we conclude is that\npeople should just try harder right it's\na lack of effort and then something even\nmore damning happens is that if it's a\nlack of effort and it doesn't work then\nyou conclude that you are\nlazy so then you make this conclusion\nthat you are lazy this becomes a truth\nfor you this becomes part of who you are\nthis becomes a part of your\nidentity and then the moment that this\nbecomes a part of your identity it\nbecomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy so one of the really\ninteresting things so I was working with\num this is back when I was in residency\nso I was working with a lot of kids who\nwere\ndelinquents and the crazy thing is that\na kid will become what you expect of\nthem most of the time so if you look at\na kid and you decide and it's so sad\nbecause we see this all the time in our\ncommunity kids who grow up and y'all are\ntreated from a young age as losers or\npathetic or your parents tell you that\nyou're not going to mount to anything or\nanything like that and then you will\nlive up to expectations because that's\nwhat kids do it's like peer pressure\neveryone wants to wear these shoes you\nwant to wear these shoes too except\nthere's no material component people\nwill become what you expect of them\nbecause that's what Humans Do Right\neveryone else is crying I'll cry too\nokay fine everyone else is laughing I'll\nlaugh\ntoo so the moment that people start\ntreating a child as lazy the child child\nwill become lazy because the child is\nbeing told hey I'm lazy hey I'm lazy and\nthe child understands it too they get it\nthey're like oh all these other people\nare capable of doing this stuff I'm not\ncapable of doing this stuff and the\nworld around is telling me that there is\na word for this that word is lazy it's\nnot\nneurodiverse because ADHD is both the\nmost overdiagnosed and underdiagnosed\npsychiatric diagnosis in my opinion what\nthis means is a lot of people who don't\nhave it get diagnosed with it and a lot\nof people who do have it don't get\ndiagnosed with it\nespecially bad for girls by the way so\nthe rate of diagnosis is really\nfascinating rate of diagnosis of girls\nto boys to ADHD is 1 to three so for\nevery three boys that is diagnosed with\nADHD girls are one girl is diagnosed but\nif you look at the rates of diagnosis\namongst men in women it's one to one so\nwe're missing a ton of diagnosis in\nyoung girls why because girls are not as\nhyperactive girls are not as disruptive\ngirls are much more internalizing girls\nhave so much more external pressure to\nbe good little girls and don't make a\ndisturbance whereas boys are\nrambunctious so there's a lot of\ncultural component there too gender\nsocietal dynamics that play as\nwell but the key thing to keep in mind\nis that if you treat a child like\nthey're lazy if you tell them they're\nlazy if you tell them you just need to\nwork harder I was told that every single\nteacher conference that I had every\nsingle one I'm not talking that's not\neven EX exaggeration literally every\nsingle one when I was in school the\nteacher would say the same thing every\n[ __ ] time your son is so smart if he\njust applied himself he would do so much\nbetter if he just worked harder so I\nremember my piano teacher told me the\nsame thing which is that if he practiced\nhe'd be great and so then what would\nhappen my parents would turn to me and\nthey'd say you need to practice more and\nI'd say okay Mommy Daddy I will practice\nbut I did not know how to restrain my\nattention practicing felt so\nboring because when you practice you\ndon't actually make music you make noise\nthere's no reward and so it's impossible\nfor me to\npractice what could I practice Street\nFighter\n2 that's easy to practice [ __ ] a I\ncan practice that [ __ ] all day long\nI remember there was one day where I\nspent four hours practicing how to do a\nShore yuken for those of Y all that are\nfamiliar with Street Fighter 2 it used\nto be now it's easy but back in the day\nit used to be a very hard physical\ncombination to pull off it's forward\ndown down right diagonally and then you\ntake your pick and I practiced for four\nhours and at the beginning of the day I\ndidn't know how to do a short you and by\nthe end I could do it with 99%\nproficiency because each time you do a\nShore yukin you hear that super manly sh\nyukin I was like [ __ ] yeah let's go son\nyeah right it's such a powerful it's\nlike oh my God my [ __ ] character is\nlike flying into the air with his fist\nin the air whereas if I try to practice\npiano what\nhappens nothing it's just torture it's\ntorture there's no benefit no Advantage\nnone\nwhatsoever this is what happens in ADHD\nit is impossible to do something unless\nunless there is an immediate reward\nwithout help that is we'll get to it's\nnot you're not screwed for life okay so\nlet's move\non\nokay\nso um we'll get to this in a second\nspends weeks preparing for small tasks\nthis goes to this okay so\nnow this we kind of\ndid this we kind of\ndid so let's talk about a couple\nothers\nokay so writes reminders and doesn't\nread\nthem so this is where we get to actually\nlike treatment and options for\nADHD see what happens when we have\nADHD is that we look at the rest of the\nworld and we try to think like we look\nat what other people are doing and we\ntry to implement those Solutions so the\nperson with ADHD this is the sequence of\nevents okay the first thing is the\nperson with ADHD realizes that they have\na bad memory they\nforget and so what they say is they say\nokay I'll write myself a\nreminder and that'll help me remember\nbut there are a couple of problems with\nthis the first is that you have to\nremember to read your\nreminders and they're they don't do that\nso they can write reminders is very easy\nthey're like oh I'll like remember to\nread this later but then they don't\nactually read the reminder they need a\nreminder for the\nreminder second thing is that the\nwriting of a reminder let's understand\nthis when you write a reminder what is\nreinforced absolutely nothing there's no\ndopaminergic reinforcement when you\nwrite the reminder the value of the\nreminder is in the future delayed\ngratification T3 which is 5 days later\nyou have this reminder which you've\nforgotten there's no thing so no\nreinforcement doesn't work works for\nneurotypical people because they are\ncapable of remembering the reminder\nand when you remember the reminder and\nyou look at the reminder then you have\nyou take the action you get the reward\nbut the reward is 5 days later than when\nyou wrote the reminder so the the\ndoesn't get reinforced does this make\nsense this is crazy it's a beautiful\nexample of all the things that go wrong\nin\nADHD there's no immediate re\nreinforcement you have to remember to\nread the reminder which you can't do\nright cuz memory is a problem in the\nfirst place we'll get to that in a\nsecond\nso no\nreinforcement difficulty\nremembering third thing is we can't form\nthe Habit because we're not\nconsistent so this is why writing\nreminders for people with ADHD is a\nbeautiful solution that works incredibly\nwell if you have the scaffolding to do\nit so let's understand this this is\nwhere treatment of ADHD comes in so what\nis psychotherapy for ADHD it is a set of\ncognitive skills that are trained in\npeople that so that you have this\nscaffolding to lay down the habit and\nonce you have the system in place then\nit yields a lot of benefit see this is\nvery important to\nunderstand building a habit for someone\nlike with ADHD is like digging a well\nfor\nwater the first 9 ft you dig is effort\nwith no reward the 10th foot and you\nsuddenly have a ton of water you have as\nmuch water as you want to the last foot\nis worth infinite water the first 9 ft\nare worth Zero Water this is what\nbuilding a habit is like this is why\nit's hard so if you can get to that\npoint of having a system that gives you\nreminders using a calendar and a lot of\npeople that I've worked with with ADHD\ndo this right so they by by hook or by\ncrook with a ton of effort sometimes\nthey're lucky enough to develop some\nkind of habit that really works for them\nsome kind of external organizational\nsystem system that really works for them\nthe problem is that most of us are\ncapable of digging a 10-ft well and\nwe're okay waiting for the water with\nADHD you'll dig one foot over here\nyou'll move away you'll dig two feet\nover there you'll dig three feet in\nanother place so what's happening you're\nexpending a ton of effort you're\nactually digging 40 ft but not in one\nplace so this is how we get to\nthis right we've kind of talked about\nthis already\nbut gets nothing done all day and still\nstill feels overwhelmed and exhausted so\nlet's talk about this for a\nsecond gets nothing done and still feels\noverwhelmed and\nexhausted what exhausts you what\nexhausts you is effort and if you pay\nattention to someone who has ADHD they\nmay get nothing done but it isn't that\nthey're not doing anything all day in\nfact quite the opposite what happens\nwith someone with ADHD is they are\nwrestling with their mind all day\nlong this is what they're doing and\nwrestling with your mind the exertion of\nwillpower is one of the things that is\nvery cognitively\ndraining so they're actually digging 40\nfeet of Wells just on a dozen different\ntasks right and this is what the\nexperience of someone with ADHD is you\nhave so much stuff to do everything\nneeds to get done because you're so\nbehind so I got to do this and I got to\ndo this and I got to do this and I got\nto do this and oh no I started this but\nI forgot about this and now I need to go\ngrocery shopping now I need to do this\nand now I need to check the mail so\nyou're actually spending a ton of\neffort but nothing gets\nfinished and then every time you switch\ntasks there is a warming up to the task\nagain so like you can't pick it up\nexactly where you left off because your\nmemory isn't very good so you don't\nremember what part of this have I done\nand what part of this have I not done I\nneed to like takes takes me a day or two\nto like get back into it like what what\ndo I need to do again cuz you forgot to\ndo it so this is the experience of\npeople with ADH it's very very\nchallenging right and you continue to\nget judged because people don't judge\nthe effort that you put in this is the\nbig irony if you've got ADHD chances are\nyou're working the hardest out of any of\nyour\npeers but that's not what you get judged\nfor you get judged for what gets\ncomplete not how how hard you work and\nthis is what's so damaging to people see\nif someone is doing everything and they\nget judged for the\nopposite this really [ __ ] people up so\nif you're actually working really hard\nand people call you lazy that\ndiscordance is so psychologically\ndamaging if you're actually a good\nperson so I see this a lot in trauma\nthere's like a kid who's like a good kid\nbut their parents teach them that they\nare a bad\nkid so we'll see this a lot with things\nlike you know hyper religiosity and\nsexuality and and some of these things\nwhere like you know people are taught\nthat they are bad even though they're\ngood and this really messes people up\nbecause now Up Is Down and Down is up\nit's very hard to go through life when\nUp Is Down and Down is\nup so the big irony is kids with ADHD\nwork way harder that's why everything is\nso\nexhausting but they're taught that\nthey're\nlazy and so now if you've defined hard\nwork as lazy what chance do you possibly\nhave\nscrewed\nokay\nso let's take a look at a couple of\nother\nthings so chugs gallon of caffeine so\nthis makes sense okay because chugging a\ngallon of caffeine or any other kind of\npsychoactive\nsubstance results in such immediate\neffect we become dependent on it so\nexercising taking a walk in the morning\nthat has these things have lingering\neffects even eating a proper breakfast\nhas such a slow onset of action that the\nbehavior doesn't get reinforced chugging\na gallon of caffeine and by the way like\ndrug companies understand this very well\nbecause this is why they make stimulant\nmedication so that's really fascinating\nso if you look at the studies on\nstimulant versus non non stimulant\nmedication we've got medications like\nbuproprion or atomoxetine and then we\nhave medications like methylphenidate\nand um amphetamine salts so some are\nstimulants and some are not stimulants\nif you look at the outcomes on\nmedication so if I give people\nnon-stimulant medication and stimul or\nstimulant medication they tend to do\njust as well in life the outcomes are\nthe\nsame why do people love stimulants if\nthey've got ADHD because they feel the\neffect immediately and since they can\nnotice an immediate difference there's a\nlot more reinforcement of that\nmedication and drug companies understand\nthis very\nwell right so what they try to do is\nthey try to give you something that\nsubjectively makes you feel better same\ndifference with benzo aines and\nanti-anxiety medications like ssris or\nsnris so benzo aines activate the same\nreceptor as alcohol Gaba receptor they\nhave an immediate effect which makes\nthem more addictive and patients really\nwant it the SSRI or snri yields the same\nclinical benefit over the course of 2\nmonths but people don't feel it\nsubjectively as\nmuch so this is very important to\nunderstand so the more immediate the\nbenefit is the easier it is to reinforce\nan\nADHD okay\nnow let's talk about\nthis can't regulate\nmotions so this is another thing to\nunderstand so in ADHD there's a let me\nsee if I can find\nthis\num\nso let's just I'll just show you all so\nthere's a bunch of papers on this but we\ncan just look at it here\nreject optional cookies [ __ ] no cookies\ndude kidding so is emotional\ndisregulation part of the\nPsychopathology of ADHD in\nadults\num so empirical studies attest this\nDimension sufficient this Dimension\nsufficient reliability and validity\nsymptoms of emotional disregulation are\ndefinable and seem to be distinct\nfactors of the Psychopathology of adult\nADHD let's just look at another one okay\naccept emotional disregulation is a\nprimary symptom in adult deficit\nhyperactivity disorder right\ndysfunctional emotion regulation\nsignificantly contributes to impairment\nin several domains with\nADHD there's even a let's try\nsubtype um there's a good paper\nhere that I can't find now so there's\nthere's some there there's some people\nlike researchers who have actually\nhypothesized that you know how we have\nADD and ADHD so attention deficit\ndisorder or attention deficit\nhyperactivity\ndisorder and so some people have\nhypothesized that there is a third\nsubtype of ADHD that is or add that is\nattention deficit disorder with\nemotional\ndisregulation and so emotional\ndisregulation is a huge part of ADHD so\npeople with ADHD feel especially\nnegative emotions much more quickly more\nintensely so the onset of action is more\nrapid the intensity of the emotion is\nmore rapid and the duration of the\nemotion is\nlonger so what let's understand this we\nhave this part of our brain called the\namygdala in our lyic system which is our\nnegative emot our emotional\ncircuitry and remember that in ADHD we\nhave executive function deficits we have\ncontrol deficits in our frontal loes\nso control deficits in our frontal loes\nlead to things like impulsivity if we're\nlooking at the relationship between the\nnucleus succumbent in the frontal loes\nso nucleus cumbent is like I want it\ngive it to me let's do\nit that's nucleus succumbent we have\ntrouble controlling that if we have ADHD\nbut that's not the only thing that the\nfrontal lobe\ncontrols it also restrains our negative\nemotions so emotional disregulation is a\nhuge problem for people with ADH\nand the reason that this is a big\nproblem is not just that they have this\nneuroscientific deficit but that our\nsociety assumes a certain level of\nemotional regulation capability we\nassume a neurotypical emotional\nregulation\nproblem and so what tends to happen is\nwhen people have difficulty regulating\ntheir emotions we do not support them in\nteaching them emotional regulation\nskills we just tell them that they need\nto do it\nright so this is the big problem is\nunlike someone who's missing a leg where\nwe're like hey friend since you're\nmissing a leg we will do things like\nbuild ramps for you we will do things\nlike provide you with a wheelchair we\nwill do things like provide you with a\nprosthetic so that we can correct your\ndeficiency and you can participate in\nsomething of a normal life and when we\ndo that for people who are missing limbs\nthey're capable of living relatively\nnormal lives they still have challenges\nwe're not saying that but if if we look\nat the psychological consequences these\npeople can do things like hold jobs they\ncan get married they can have kids if\nthat's what they want to do they can go\non vacation they can get on planes we\nhave so many accommodations for people\nwith physical handicaps we have very few\naccommodations or arguably no very few\naccommodations for people with mental\nhandicaps and that too is such\nespecially on platforms like what we\nstream ha mental\nhandicap we use that term so in such a\nderogatory way right so these people are\nneurodiverse their brains are wired in a\nslightly different way they're not\ncapable of the same things at\ndefault and so we must make\naccommodations for them and\naccommodations doesn't mean that we want\nto make everything in their life easier\nwe want to do the work for them this\nmeans that we want to help train their\nbrains in the way that they need to\ncompensate for the way things\nare right it's just like even if we look\nat something like red green color\nblindness we have video games now that\nhave color blind friendly modes like\nthat's cool that's what we need for ADHD\nas well we need ways to build habits we\nneed ways of Behavioral reinforcement\nthat account for these things ways to\nregulate emotions that account for these\nthings but we don't and so the problem\nis that people suffer because standard\nSolutions don't\nwork right it's like someone without\nlegs and we're just telling them hey bro\nor girl climb stairs just climb stairs\nand it's like you can do it right if\nyou've got no legs you can go up a\nflight of stairs it's doable it's just\ngoing to be\nexhausting to climb one flight of stairs\nis going to be so exhausting and this is\nwhat happens with our cognitive the\ncognitive world that we live in where we\nassume that people can deal with\nreminders we assume that people's\nattention is capable of being focused so\nwe have some 1H hour boring ass meeting\nand even if we know it's a boring ass\nmeeting we're expecting people to be\nable to pay attention to some degree\ntorture for someone with ADHD absolute\ntorture and so this is the problem that\nwe\ncreate and then what we end up\nwith is\nthis when\neverything comes to\npass we end up with can't trust your own\njudgment because of all all of these\nother failures you lose confidence in\nyourself so then what we've really done\nnow this is kind of like the last nail\nin the\ncoffin so as we mentioned people with\nADHD can sometimes grow up to be\ndepressed but see once you lose\nconfidence in yourself the fundamental\nunit of agency in your life is\ngone so if we look at a human being's\ncapacity\nto deal with adversity the most powerful\nthing we can have is\nconfidence confidence is what determines\nwhether something is a setback or a\nfailure and the child with ADHD the\nyoung adult the adult with ADHD\nconcludes that I cannot trust\nmyself and now you're in big\ntrouble because a big part of life is\ntrusting yourself why because you can\ntrust in other people but other people\nare not 100%\nyou see if you are don't trust your own\ntaste in food and you look around at\nwhat other people are enjoying you can\nstill get some enjoyment but to have the\nperfect meal you need to look into\nyourself you need to ask yourself what\ndo I enjoy that's the way to get a\nperfect meal it isn't to find what\nsomeone else is eating and enjoy that\nbut this is what happens then they lose\nthe capacity to trust their own judgment\ntheir own confidence and now I've lost a\na very\nfundamental barometer or thermometer or\nmeasurement stick for my life because if\nyou think about anything in life you can\nget the best advice in the world you can\nhave people make food for you you can\nhave people pick out clothing for you\nyou can have people pick video games for\nyou you can have people pick all kinds\nof stuff you can do things and you can\ndo it pretty well you can look at\nreviews you can look at this you can\nlook at advice but at the end of the day\nyour life comes down to\nyou you have to decide for yourself what\nyou like what you don't like what works\nwhat doesn't work and when you lose the\ncapacity to trust yourself you will\nbecome directionless in\nlife what this looks like is that you\nare constantly looking outside for\nanswers but those answers don't\ntranslate 100% to you so you're looking\nfor another answer and another answer\nand another answer and then you get to\nthis conclusion that nothing works for\nme works for all these other people but\nnone of these Solutions I've seen this\nso many times I've had people come into\nmy office I've seen 10\npsychiatrists nothing works I'm\nhopeless so they come to me and they're\nlike you do this weird alternative\nmedicine stuff maybe you can fix me and\nI'm like [ __ ] I can't fix you if you've\nseen 10 psychiatrist why do you think\nI'm smarter than they are I'm\nnot this if you want to fix your life\nand you've gone to 10 different people\nfor help if you tried everything under\nthe sun there's one only one place left\nto go which is towards yourself because\nother people's Solutions don't work for\nyou we've already determined that and\nwhen that person comes into my office\nand says I've tried 10 other people\nmaybe you can help me there's one way in\nwhich I can help them and this what this\nis what determines whether this person\ngets better or not which is can I teach\nthis person can I help this person\nreconnect with themselves and find their\nown Solutions\nbecause there people who are better than\nme that have already tried and they've\nfailed there's no way that I can succeed\nthe answer has to come from\nyou and this is the real tragedy the\nParadox the irony call it whatever you\nwant to is that we take these kids with\nADHD and we teach them to distrust\nthemselves and then it becomes almost\nimpossible so if we look at\nPsychotherapy for ADHD what do we do so\nwhen I have a patient who comes in with\nADHD I also in the back of my mind am\nfocusing on depression treatment until\nproven otherwise trauma treat treatment\nuntil proven otherwise these three\nthings addiction treatment until proven\notherwise so anytime someone comes into\nmy office with ADHD these are the three\nadditional diagnoses that I am very\nvigilant for because chances are there's\nsome element of addiction depression and\nTrauma in this person's\nlife and the research backs that up by\nthe way this isn't you know just me\nrandomly coming up with things because I\nsee it\nbecause\nunlike growing up without legs we don't\nhave a society that accommodates people\nwith ADHD you can get extra time on\ntests whoop do you [ __ ] do shocking\nI'm going to tell youall something crazy\nokay there's also a gendered component\nADHD which I'm working on a video\non so if we look at people who get\ndivorced\n60% of women with ADHD\noh\nsorry men this is going to sound bad I'm\njust trying to remember the exact\nphrasing women with ADHD have a 60%\nlikelihood to get divorced from their\npartner because of their\nADHD 10% of men are likely to get\ndivorced from their partner because of\ntheir\nADHD so we haven't even scratched the\nsurface of a lot of these\nconsequences what does that mean I'm not\nsaying that women have it worse than men\nplease don't make that kind and we're\njust talking about statistics here okay\nwhat this means is that a lot of the\nsocietal expectations of\nwomen are impossible to meet or very\ndifficult to meet if you have ADHD very\nsimple thing women are expected to keep\nthe house organized are expected to take\ncare of the kids pack the lunches these\nthings become incredibly difficult with\nADHD the basic things that we Society\nexpect from women become very difficult\nso women with ADHD are much more likely\nto go through divorce than than men and\nwhy is it it's because of this this is\nwhat the research suggests right I'm not\nsaying that men have it easier please do\nnot so I've noticed this tendency in\nthis community where when I say make a\nstatement people will jump to a very\nblack and white way of thinking please\ndon't do that\nright and this happens when I talk about\nhow men would men kill themselves and\nthen people will get upset and they'll\nsay that but women struggle with suicide\ntoo yes I'm not in my experience as a\npsychiatrist I don't think one gender\nhas it way easier than the other it's\njust we're all [ __ ] in different\nways and the right answer is that we\nshould have compassion for all people\nfor the difficulties that they have and\nwhen it comes to a diagnosis there are\ngender specific manifestations of a\ndiagnosis it's not all the same men and\nwomen don't live equal lives they we all\nexperience the world in a very different\nway and we have our own unique\nchallenges it is our job to look at the\ndata and understand in what ways this\nparticular disease process manifests in\na gendered way in a cultural\nway because human beings have separate\nlives and if we want to help all people\nwe need to understand the societal\nexpectations and pressures for both men\nand\nwomen right so I'm working on two videos\nright now one is about how men's anxiety\nis very different from anxiety and how\nwomen's ADHD is very different from\nADHD it's very interesting so there are\neven some trials that show\nthat stimulant\nmedication does not improve symptoms for\nwomen crazy crazy crazy there's a couple\nof Trials\nand why because stimulant medication is\nvery effective at treating\nhyperactivity but women are much less\nlikely to be\nhyperactive\nokay\nso yeah if you guys\nhere\nokay so just to kind of\nsummarize see when we look at this kind\nof stuff we can look at this stuff all\nthis stuff I think is very\naccurate now even though I'm sort of\ntalking Doom and\nGloom there's one very important thing\nto\nremember if we want to fix a problem we\nhave to understand it we have to\nunderstand how it happens so please\ndon't take what I'm saying as a feature\nof hopelessness and this is where I\nthink this is I don't know that Dr\nBarkley was saying this but he says it's\nimpossible I I I mean I don't think\nthat's actually what he means I I don't\nthink he thinks that ADHD is a hopeless\ndiagnosis I think we know that there are\nevidence-based interventions but we have\nto start by understanding what the\nproblem is and the biggest problem in\nADHD is misdiagnosis when people tell\nyou to work harder or just wake up on\ntime or use sticky notes to remind\nyourself people come up with all of\nthese Solutions the reason they don't\nwork is because they are solutions to\ndifferent problems the problems that\nsomeone with ADHD has are different and\nso we need tailored solutions to those\nproblems things that neurotypical people\nwill never even think\nof so chances are one of my kids is\nsomewhere once again on the ADHD\nSpectrum she inherited my good\ngenes and so the things that I have to\nteach her as a parent are things that I\nwould never have thought to teach they\nseem so simple and\nbasic right so for for example I'll ask\nmy daughter\nlet's say we're talking about reminders\nand so what I find is that to really\nwork with someone with ADHD you have to\ndo two or three additional steps to\ntranslate a neurotypical solution for a\nneurodiverse person so if we take\nsomething like writing a sticky\nnote so if I I'll say okay you can write\na reminder but then I have to go two\nsteps further I have to ask her what do\nwe do with reminders what's the purpose\nof a reminder and then she's like kind\nof confused and she's like to remind me\nand I say yes that is very good what\nmakes it hard for us to remember sticky\nnotes how are you going to remember to\nread a sticky note and she's like make a\nsticky note to remember my sticky note I\nsaid very\ngood how are you going to remember to\nremember your sticky note and she's like\nmake another sticky note I'm fused this\nisn't going to work and I'm like ABS\n[ __ ] lutely I don't say [ __ ] cuz\nshe's\nsix this is not going to\nwork take a deep breath now let's figure\nout what do you think will\nwork okay let's put the sticky note\nlet's forget about the sticky note\nentirely as a reminder what we're going\nto do is we're going to take the back of\nyour door to your school room and we're\ngoing to put all all of your sticky\nnotes on the back of the door and the\nfirst thing that you need to do when you\ncome home every single day is look at\nthe back of the\ndoor the whole system has to be made for\nher she needs help making\nit right so what's the first thing that\nwe do when we come home we're going to\nput our snack away we're going to go to\nthe back of the door and we're going to\nsee what's written on there you have to\nbake the you have to teach them how to\nbake the\nsystem does that make sense so this is\nwhat's missing in ADHD this is what ADHD\ntreatment\nis is teaching people these kinds it's\nproviding scaffolding so that you can\nThrive so it's not hopeless but we need\ncustomized\nSolutions we need neurodiverse\nSolutions and so a lot of people in our\ncommunity have been awesome at figuring\nthis stuff out people will you know\nshare their experiences that's awesome\nwe have a whole guide about ADHD where\nwe go into these\nthings you know step by step what are\nthe things that you need to\ndo what what are the strengths what are\nthe weaknesses what are the difficulties\nhow are things different for you you\nhave to understand all of this\nstuff and then the beautiful thing is\nthat once you figure some of this stuff\nout then things start to change this\nbegins to\nchange right this begins to change this\nbegins to\nchange instead of def faulting to\nsolutions that work for other people\nwe're going to develop solutions that\nwork for\nus\nokay I'm a male with inattentive type\ndoes that mean that stimulants won't\nwork for me so that's a question for you\nand a clinician what I'm simply saying\nis\nthat there are some studies I can think\nof two that demonstrate I mean when I\nsay I can think of two\nlet me just let's just look at them\ntogether I\nthink and there's a I'm I'm working on a\nvideo on this so we'll go over this in\nmore detail but let's\n[Music]\nsee I think this is the one\nokay um give me a\nsecond so I'll just let's just look at\nthis together okay\nchat so stimulant treatment for\nfemales okay so a Lar large variation\nhas been reported in response to\ntreatment with efficacy ranging from 25%\nto 78% which is much different than the\nFairly consistently reported 70% range\nof response in\nchildren okay so this is like really\ninteresting so like if you look at\nstudies on women like the range is 25 to\n78% and if you look at like most trials\non the efficacy of medication it's\nsomewhere around\n70% um\nright so uh as noted in the previous\nsection girls seem to respond optimally\nwhen medication is combined with\nbehavioral\ninterventions um some differences in\nstimulant response have been found for\nthe in attemped type versus the combin\ntype so\nlike we're not sure right so that that's\nthe main thing is like we're all\noperating under this idea that four\ngirls that ad HD stimulant medication is\nlike 70%\neffective most people are not aware that\nthe range is 25 to 78% like that's\nshocking that's a very different\ntreatment\nresponse but I you know I think this\nkind of specificity is like not we're\nnot really aware of it it's\ncrazy um nope I'm reading\neverything okay\num okay shall we move on\nchat so we did a lot of stuff on\nADHD let\nus I want to close the tab\nclose close multiple tabs to the right\nthere we\ngo all right\ngive me a sec\nchat let's just check in with what\npeople are saying thinking\ndoing damn it that took longer than I\nexpected um\nokay so I think people wanted to do five\nhours into a walk\nright\num okay so I'm going to go PE real quick\nra quack so y'all can take a look at\nthis we're going to talk about this as\nsoon as I get back chat\nfor e\nokay\nso why does this always happen after a\ngood head clearing walk 5 hours into the\nwalk my potential knows no bounds I will\naccomplish greater Feats than anyone\nbefore me I will uncover every last\nsecret of the universe I will experience\nevery possible emotion and never die I\nwill turn my life around\nthe moment I get home and 10 minutes\nafter getting home you're like\ndamn why does this\nhappen why is it then when we're walking\nwhen we're thinking about all the\nchanges we're going to make in our lives\nwe're like oh man like I'm going to turn\nthings around first thing tomorrow right\nwe look at the future and we say I'm\ngoing to\nchange and when it comes around to it\nit's hard to change\nand we say to ourselves oh my God I'm so\nlazy it's not\nlaziness and what yall will find is that\nif you're if you're kind of like this\nyou'll find that there's a lot of\nstruggles that we have where we kind of\nwill think like okay like I'm going to\nfinally make some friends I'm going to\nput myself out\nthere and then the moment that you try\nto put yourself out there you feel very\nsocially anxious you're like I'm going\ngo home then you say to yourself one day\nokay I'm going to finally get in shape\nI'm going to exercise I'm going to do\nthis and then you think about going to\nthe gym and you're like like nah I'm not\ngoing to do\nthat so if you look at life a lot of\npeople\nstruggle to do this\nstuff and there are some people who seem\nto not struggle as much right have yall\nnoticed this that like sometimes you\nlook at people who are like doing it all\nit's like I have a family member and\nshe's just absolutely amazing she's an\namazing mother she runs her own business\nis lots of fun plans trips is like\nlearning new things is always available\nto help people she's like some kind of\nSuperwoman I'm like how on Earth how's\nthis person able to do this and we come\nup with these ideas like resilience like\nsome people some people are more\nresilient than others it's like how do\nyou become\nresilient right like H how does this\nwork how is it that some people are\ncapable of so many of these things and\nother people don't seem to be capable of\nmany of them at\nall so let's understand this\nso if you look at people who tend to be\nstuck and unable to follow through with\nthings there are a couple of very\nimportant principles to understand today\nwe're going to focus on one called\nambivalence so Ambi means both and veent\nis like Direction so when we tend to\napproach Our Lives we tend to have some\nkind of internal conflict and the\nbiggest mistake that most people who\ndon't progress\nmake is that they don't focus on their\nambivalence what we try to do anytime we\nhave Waring parts we try to have one\nperson one side win right so let's take\na classic example of should I break up\nwith this person or not and what\neveryone will tell you to do is make a\npros and cons list write all your Pros\nover here and all your cons over here\nand then look at the\nlist and then the answer will become\nclear and then you make the decision and\nthen you stick to it but that's not how\nit works right because you make the pros\nand cons list and you're like okay there\nare 16 pros and there are four cons\nlet's just use another example let's\nmake a pro and con list about playing\nvideo games all day long Pros it's fun\ncons is bad for my health bad for my\ncareer bad for my\nrelationship bad for my making friends\nin the real world bad for my fashion bad\nfor my back bad for my skin bad for what\nI eat but the pros it's a lot of fun but\nit's not even a lot of fun all the time\nlike sometimes like I don't even know\nwhy I'm doing it like procon list so\nlook at these procon list and we make a\ndecision and this is our\nmistake the biggest mistake that we make\nis that we assume that making a decision\nis going to fix anything that's not what\nhappens so if we look at our actual\nexperience we decide one thing today and\nthen we do this thing called change our\nminds right so you make a decision today\nand tomorrow you make the opposite\ndecision and so then we start to think\nto ourselves I need focus on I need to\nfollow through I need to learn\ncommitment and\ndiscipline we need to focus on is\nambivalence so I'm going to read\nsomething to\ny'all so this is a great book called\nmotivation interviewing and it's helping\npeople change so when I was a first year\nmedical student I had a family medicine\nProfessor who was teaching us about\nhelping patients so Family Medicine is\nkind of like a general practitioner or\nprimary care\nphysician super interesting guy so he\nwould do this thing so he he recommended\nthis book or not made it was part of his\nclass so he's teaching us how to like do\nsome basic doctoring and he had some\npretty hot takes one of his hot takes\nis that di type 2 diabetes obesity and\narthritis all of these are behavioral\nproblems so he was like telling us that\nyou know we have all these drugs for\nthings like type 2\ndiabetes but it is amazing what kind of\ndrugs we will\ndevelop that allow people to not change\ntheir behavior we will bend over so we\nwill advance science so far just so\npeople don't have to change what they do\nwe will enable such terrible\nBehavior with advancements in medical\nscience so he told me this when I was a\nfirste medical student thought really\nstuck with me and he was like diabetes\nis not uh a type 2 diabetes is not a a\ndisease of Endocrinology it is a disease\nof\nbehavior and we as doctors don't focus\non that and and this really crystallized\nfor me a few years later when I was on\nmy vascular surgery rotation and I had a\npatient come in who was getting her\nthird or fourth\namputation so literally what would\nhappen she had a surgeon who knew her\nvery well and the surgeon before surgery\nsaid you know we're going to keep doing\nthis until you quit smoking right and\nshe was like yeah doctor I know I'm so\nsorry so she had lost one leg below the\nknee and then he was doing\nthe second removal of certain toes on\nher feet he was like taking off chunks\nof her feet every couple years and his\nintervention was you know we're going to\nkeep doing this until you quit smoking\nright and she was like yes doctor I know\nand then he amputated her\nfoot\ncrazy so controlling your behavior is\nParamount and this is what I love about\nthis\nbook so I think it beautifully explains\nthe core problem with making a\ndecision okay\non okay yet ambivalence can also be a\nsticky place where one may remain\nsuspended for a long time the Dynamics\nof conflict make this dilemma\nunderstandable conceptually ambivalent\nconflict comes in four different\nvarieties all of them involve being\nsimultaneously pushed or pulled in at\nleast two opposite directions the more\nand here's the key thing the more you\nmove toward one choice the clearer its\ndisadvantages become and the more its\nopposite appeals so here's the basic\nproblem with making a decision see when\nI'm in the middle I look over here and I\nsee some advantages and some\ndisadvantages and I look over here and I\nsee some advantages and some\ndisadvantages and we look at these pros\nand cons\nand we make a decision but as I start to\nmove in this direction the disadvantages\nbecome more clear and potent and the\nadvantages on the other side become more\nadvantageous the grass is always greener\non the other side the idea of going to\nthe gym has certain pros and certain\ncons the moment I actually go to the gym\nthe cons become way higher and the pros\nbecome way smaller\nand then the pros of the opposite side\nbecome way more attractive and then I\nmove in that direction and then the cons\nbecome\nbigger so see the basic problem that we\nhave is that we are looking for our\nlives to be easy we are looking for some\nkind of resolution from a decision right\nso when I'm looking at this\nidea oh like all of these are wonderful\nideas but the moment that I start I will\nturn my around the moment I get home\nthis is in the future and the moment\nthat you get home the prospect of\nactually turning your life around comes\nwith such larger disadvantages than when\nyou were just thinking about it and far\naway see objects in the mirror are\ncloser than they appear downsides to\nyour behavior become seem very very far\naway until you get close to\nthem this is the\nproblem so the basic mistake that we\nmake is that we look at pros and cons\nand we make a decision and we assume\nthat our decision is like beneficial\nright so this is kind of makes sense\nlike we have Pros over here we have cons\nover here and then we're going to decide\nsomething based on a net positive and we\nthink we're going to move in that\ndirection but the whole problem is that\nthe equation changes as we implement\nit and since the disadvantages become\nbigger and the advantages seem further\naway then we move in the opposite\ndirection\nso we go from plus one and we're like\n[ __ ] this is bad then we run towards\nzero and we head towards minus one and\nthen as we head towards minus one the\ndisadvantages become bigger and the\nadvantages oh plus one weren weren't so\nbad so let me run back in that\ndirection so we're not paralyzed we're\nconflicted and it's not actually\nparalysis it's not\ninaction it is reverse\naction I'm going to break up with you\nlet's get back back together we need to\nbreak up this is crazy this is terrible\nI miss you conflict right because once\nyou break up with someone then the pain\nof them being the being absent is so\nmuch more acute you begin to realize all\nthe things that you took for granted in\nthe relationship and then when you get\nback together with you're like oh my God\nI missed this person then you get back\ntogether and all the [ __ ] toxic\nbehaviors are in your face again they're\nnagging you all the time putting you\ndown in front of your\nfriends they're cheap\nand all this other crap so it's\nwhichever direction we go starts to feel\nmore\npainful so if you look at people who are\ncapable of doing a lot of things and\npeople are not capable of very much they\nstruggle with one group struggles with\nambivalence one group is very good at\nambivalence dealing with\nambivalence and this by the way is the\nfoundation of our coaching program is\nmotivational interviewing and behavioral\nchange right so this is what we try to\nreally focus on is how it's not about\ngiving people answers it's about helping\nthem work through acknowledge their\nconflict and how to move forward in\nspite of things being difficult not\ntrying to make things\neasy so how do you overcome ambivalence\nit's very very very simple you just\naccept that whatever Direction you're\ngoing to go things are not going to get\neasier they're going to get harder see\nanytime we're looking for a procon list\nwe're looking for some kind of benefit\nwe're looking for a net gain get rid of\nthat idea and then you'll be able to do\nwhatever you\nwant okay so I'll explain a little bit\nmore because that may sound\nweird see anytime we make a\ndecision we make that decision assuming\nthat things will get better we are\ntrying to make a decision to improve our\nsituation so if I'm stuck at home and\nI'm lonely I need to make the pain of\nthis loneliness go away so I'm moving\ntowards something with the idea that\nthis will make my life\nbetter but as we just discovered the\nproblem with ambivalence is actually\nleaving the house becomes so much harder\nso as long as you are chasing an attempt\nto make your life better you will be\nstuck in\nambivalence instead what you need to do\nis accept that things are going to be\n[ __ ] honestly that's the answer just\naccept that things are going to be [ __ ]\nfor how long who knows today for sure\nexcept that things are going to suck\ntoday tomorrow is\ntomorrow what we find with people who\nare able to really conquer\nambivalence is that like so so this is\noften times used in addiction treatment\nright so this that's really where I\nlearn motivational\ninterviewing and if you kind of talk to\npeople like yeah like I mean there's\ngoing to be advantages one day if you\nstop smoking or drinking or whatever but\ntoday your life is going to\nsuck right not drinking means a return\nto social anxiety not drinking means\nfinding a new set of friends not\ndrinking means suffering more today\nbecause drinking helps with\nthat so the key thing to understand is\nfirst of all any decision you make is a\ntemporary decision that's number one\nthere's no like final mathematical\nlogical equation that will determine\nyour behavior and we all think there is\nwe think once I've made a decision\nthat's it but that's not true just\nunderstand that your decision is like\nit's made of toilet paper it'll Fly Away\nIn The Wind it'll disintegrate\nunderwater that's just how the decision\nis except that there's going to be\nconflict except that you can make one\nchoice today and that this Choice may be\ndifficult so what we tend to do is we\ntry to make a decision to make our life\neasier instead recognize that it's going\nto be\nharder second thing that we need to do\nis anticipate the difficulty that once\nsee if we look at\nthis look at this this is positive this\nis positive this is positive this is\npositive this is positive we don't think\nabout the negatives when we're thinking\nabout our\naccomplishments so what we need to start\ndoing is thinking about the negatives\neven dwelling on the\nnegatives so I will turn my life around\nthe moment I get home this is what I\nwant yall to do for any goal that you\nwant to\naccomplish you should ask yourself\nwhat's going to make this hard how will\nthis feel when I actually do\nit and we don't like doing\nthat because we like to give in to our\npositive the positive veilance right so\nambivalence is there's positive and\nnegative and we like to just focus on\nthe positive Focus on the positive focus\non the positive there's so much positive\nstuff there and then what happens the\nreality is very different from what we\nconstruct in our head there's no\nacknowledgement of the\nnegative and so the negative ambushes us\nand then we end up staying stuck not\nreally stuck bouncing back and forth\nwe're a pendulum and a pendulum never\ngets anywhere it\njust it never gets anywhere that's what\nwe are we're pendulums and the secret is\nambivalence so think about what going to\nmake what's going to be difficult accept\nthat things are going to be difficult\ntoday don't even try to run away from\nthem accept it there are a couple of\nother things that we really do that's\nthat's very helpful other cognitive\nexercises that yall can do just that\nanytime you're moving towards\ndegeneracy play the tape through to the\nend so when we think about make anytime\nwe make a bad decision let's say I\ndecide I'm going to play video games\ntoday what I need to do is play that\ntape through through to the end these\nare cognitive things that we don't do if\nI play video games today how am I going\nto feel an hour from now how am I going\nto feel tonight and what I'm going to\nfeel\ntomorrow see if you really pay attention\nanytime you procrastinate you're trying\nvery hard not to think you're trying to\navoid thinking your mind tries to\nforget and so you forget very\nintentionally and then you wake up the\nnext day and then life reminds you and\nthen you suffer and then you beat\nyourself up from yesterday but you knew\nthis was going to happen if I asked you\nhow are you going to if you play video\ngames today how are you going to feel\ntomorrow you're going to say I'm going\nto feel like\n[ __ ] you know that I know that your mind\nintentionally tries to escape so the\nchallenge that we have is we don't know\nhow our mind works and we're not dealing\nwith it in the right\nway the other really crazy\nthing is that as you start embracing the\ndifficult your life will get so much\nbetter not worse so this is something\nthat's very important to understand we\nthink that an easy life makes our life\neasy actually an easy life makes our\nlife hard a hard life makes our life\neasy which doesn't make any [ __ ]\nsense so let me\nexplain see the reason that we want an\neasy life so people who want an easy\nlife are frequently not all the time\nit's not like one to one maybe let's say\n51% a lot of times people who want an\neasy life lack confidence in\nthemselves so a lot of people will ask\nme Dr K how do I boost my\nconfidence and the way to boost your\nconfidence is not through success it's\nthrough difficulty it's not even about\nfailure or success it's about difficulty\nthere's one very simple principle that I\nI think we don't quite understand so I'm\ngoing to read yall something that I\nthink is really\ncool there's this really great story\nabout a young girl named\nsumati and sumati is an 8-year-old girl\nwho is a disciple of the\nBuddha and one day she goes up to the\nBuddha and he's on a mountain somewhere\nand he's teaching and she asks him how\ndoes someone become happy and the Buddha\ngives her 10 tenets to become happy and\nthis is one of the things that he says\nwhen working you wish to do what is hard\nwhen living with others you wish to live\nwith those who are difficult if a task\nis difficult do it without hesitation\ndoing so shows what we are capable of\nundertaking so this is a very very\nbeautiful concept from 10 paths to\nhappiness see we don't know what we're\ncapable of as long as we're living easy\nlives\nand so if we don't know what we're\ncapable of we will be filled with\nself-doubt confidence comes from\nunderstanding and believing in yourself\nbut how can you understand who you\nare so one time I played in a charity\ntournament I played in this Dota 2\ncharity tournament and I'm a shitty\nplayer when it comes to Dota 2 I'm not\nvery\ngood right I'm maybe at like 40th to\n50th percentile so my rank is\npoor but when I was playing in this\ncharity tournament I was playing against\nI was playing like with professional\nplayers and streamers and stuff like\nthat so these people are just like you\nknow top 1% top\n.01% and I played the best goddamn DOTA\nof my life like I was like playing on a\ncompletely different\nlevel and it's like until we are tested\nwe don't know what we're capable of what\nyou're capable of is not shown when\nthings are easy what you're capable of\nis when things are hard\nthe problem is that we run away from\nthat we run away from difficulty we have\nfood delivery we have instant downloads\nWe have I want this kind of thing to\ntake care of this I want a reminder to\ntake care of this I want some kind of\nlife hack to fix this problem I'm going\nto take this supplement so I don't have\nto deal with anxiety I'm going to do\nthis so I don't I can it's easier for me\nto sleep our whole lives we trying to\nmake our lives easy make our lives easy\nmake our lives easy and we go on making\nour lives more and more difficult cuz we\nhave no confidence in\nourselves so I want yall to think about\nwhen did when was a moment in time where\nyou really respected who you are I can\nbet you a lot of money that it was not\nwhen things were easy it's when things\nare hard and you found yourself\ncapable and even if you didn't find\nyourself capable you may still feel good\nabout\nit so when it comes to ambivalence what\nwe really need to do is embrace the\ndifficulty don't don't try to make your\nlife easy and when your life when\nthere's no difference between easy and\nhard then your life will be under your\ncontrol because as long as you running\naway from difficulty then what you do in\nlife is dictated by whether it's hard or\nwhether it's easy and we all say I want\nto be capable of doing something hard\nyou strive for that you want that why\ndon't you do it because you're afraid of\nfailure you you can do hard things\nnow but that's not that's not what you\nwant it's not about hard it's hard with\nsuccess and so what the Buddha told\nsumat and what we understand about\nambivalence is just accept that it's\ngoing to be difficult today don't try to\nmake it easy don't do your pros and cons\nlist and then do the thing that's the\npro thinking it's going to be easy\nbecause it's not this is a fundamental\npsychological aspect of human behavior\nthat the moment that you're sitting in\nneutral and you pick a direction and you\nmove in that direction the disadvantages\ngrow and so if our goal is to run away\nfrom disadvantage that's when we're\ngoing to become a pendulum moving all\nthe time expending a lot of energy and\ngetting nowhere it's not\nparalysis it's contradictory behavior\nand this is what\nambivalences we have\nconflict and we want to make one\ndecision you're it's impossible to make\none decision you will always be of two\nminds that's a feature of evolution so\nstop trying to make it easy on yourself\nwhy do we want to make a decision just\nthink about that for a\nsecond the reason we want a decision is\nbecause we want to be free from the\nmental conflict I want to figure out\nwhat the right thing is to do because\nthen it'll be\neasy I want to figure out I want to life\nhack my way to success I want to find\nwork that I Love Therefore I won't\nexpend\neffort I want to get paid doing\nsomething that I love that therefore my\nlife will be\neasy and we give ourselves this kind of\nadvice right find a job that you love\nand you'll never work a day in your life\nthis is running away from\ndifficulty and then people will say the\nopposite turn what you love into a job\nand you'll hate it for the rest of your\nlife which one do I do\nyou move\nperpendicularly abandon the access just\naccept that life is\nhard except that your life is going to\nbe\ndifficult except that there's no way to\nget out of the situation you can just do\nthe best that you can and sucks for\nyou I'll give you all one last example\nof this so I met someone recently super\ninteresting guy surgical\nresident so I don't know if yall know\nmuch about the live of surgical\nresidents they work on average six days\na\nweek often times the day off that they\nhave is actually like a post call day\nsometimes so what that means is that\nthey work 24 hours and then they're off\nlike they'll work from like let's say\nFriday morning to Saturday morning and\ntheir day off will be\nSaturday they just worked for 24 hours\nand they have to be back at the hospital\non Sunday so surgical residents usually\nwork very hard\nthankfully here in the United States\nthey get some degree of mandated\nvacation which is somewhere around 3\nweeks and this guy spends one out of his\nthree weeks of vacation a year working\nsix days a\nweek or so he works six days a weeks and\none of one of the three weeks of\nvacation he spends doing volunteer work\nso he flies to a different location and\ndoes volunteer work for one week this is\na\nvacation and I was like bra you're crazy\nit's like you only get three weeks a\nyear like I can understand if you know\nyou got like five weeks a year or you\nwere working five days a week like I'm\nall for volunteer work and it's good to\nhelp other people and he was like\nactually like I find that the more that\nI do this like it doesn't bother me like\nit doesn't bother me it really doesn't\nlike I enjoy doing it like I feel like\neven though I'm tired because I I I mean\nhe works hard when he volunteers too he\ndoesn't like half asset he's working\nlike 16 18 20 hours a day when he's\nvolunteering like how what is this human\nlike who are you are you human because\nit sounds very different from\nme there's something beautiful there's\nsomething weird that we don't understand\nlike this whole society we're trying to\nmake our lives so easy so easy so easy\nand when when we make our lives so easy\nwe become intolerant of\ndifficulty and there's something\nbeautiful that you can do which is to\nmake easy and hard the same in your mind\nto not Retreat from\none and move towards the other to make\nthem both\nequal to not have vacation be\nvacation work during vacation it sounds\ncrazy sounds absolutely crazy I'm not\nsaying you need to work at your job and\nlet someone take advantage of you or\nanything like that but like I'm saying\nhe\nvolunteers but if y'all really want to\nknow how to overcome\nambivalence how to actually go home and\ndo things it's about the avoidance of\ndifficulty it's about acknowledging that\nany go goal that I move towards will be\nharder than I expect it to be and to\nprepare for that\nmentally this is going to be a mess here\nwe go right and you learn this in\nmedicine when you or when you're on call\nfor 24 hours you go into that call\nknowing that this is going to be\n[ __ ] it's going to be a lot of work it's\ngoing to be a mess hopefully it's on the\neasier side but there's no way to get\nout of this 24-hour call is 24-hour call\nlike you do the best that you can\nand the more that you start to live your\nlife like this the more that you don't\ntry to move towards easy or even if you\npick One Direction you acknowledge that\nit's going to get more painful before it\ngets easier and the big irony is that as\nyou live in this way your life will get\nbetter it'll get easier it'll become\nmore fulfilling you will be more happy\nand you will be more productive all of\nthe stuff will come and the last point\nthat I'll make is you look at the\ndirection that Society is moving in\nwe're making everything easy for\nourselves and you look at what's\nhappening happiness is decreasing\ncapability is\ndecreasing Independence is\ndecreasing because we're making\neverything\neasy last last\nexample we know this\nphysiologically how do you become\nphysically stronger do you lift light\nweights or heavy weights\nsimple and yet we don't understand this\nabout the rest of our\nlife we go on lifting the lightest\nweights we can\nfind and then we wonder why we feel so\nweak all the time we wonder why we can't\nlift heavy\nweights see this is the thing we don't\npay\nattention to ourselves what actually\nhappens in our\nlives so this is actually kind of\nrelated so we'll look at this last\npost Dr k please explain why this is so\ntrue the night before a day off is\nactually more satisfying than the actual\nday\noff weird\nright very\nstrange that the\nanticipation of a day off is more fun\nthan the day off\nitself so let's understand\nsomething we aren't taught\nhow to be\nhappy we aren't taught What happiness is\nwe're taught mathematics we're taught\nmaybe some social skills if we're lucky\nwe're taught certain physical activities\nlike maybe basketball or football soccer\nor\nwhatever right we're taught how to use\ncomputers maybe tablets Electronics Etc\nhistory we're taught all kinds of things\nbut we're not taught weird thing we're\nnot taught how to be\nhappy so the first thing that\nhappens is\nthat we think that our happiness comes\nfrom our\ncircumstances and so our strategy in\nlife becomes the avoidance of negative\ncircumstances so if we sort of think\nabout why is a day off so fun a day off\nis so fun because it is not a day of\nwork right\nso if we sort of look at what excites me\noh my God I wish I never had to work\nanother day in my\nlife so what is the nature of our\nhappiness the nature of our happiness is\nto avoid things that make us\nunhappy things like\nwork and so if we sort of like think\nabout the night before a day\noff we're very excited because it's a\nwhole day that we don't have have to\nwork thank God I don't have to\nwork it's going to be so great I can do\nso many\nthings and then you wake up and the\nactual day off is not nearly as\nglorious as what you expected sometimes\nit can be so the question is\nwhy so this is kind of weird but like\nyou know the absence of a negative thing\nis not necessarily the same as a\npositive thing\nall\nthe all the absence of a negative thing\ndoes is move us from negative to zero it\ndoesn't move us from zero to 10 does\nthat kind of make\nsense so this is where like we start to\nthink that okay in life we want to be\nthe source of our unhappiness is work\nand so removing that then I can do\nwhatever I want to but when the day\nactually rolls around we tend to waste\nit\nbecause in our mind the real Direction\nall the only happiness we can think\nabout is to run away from something\npainful it is not how to create joy in\nour lives we don't know how to do that\nwhich is why the freedom from work feels\nso much more happy than the actual day\noff for some\npeople so what are the components of\nHappiness so often times people will\nregret their day off because they didn't\ndo\nanything you wake up you hop on your\nphone you scroll Reddit for a couple of\nhours you stretch a little bit you maybe\ngo get something to eat it's pretty\ntasty like that's kind of a win and then\nyou kind of go home maybe you play a\nlittle video games maybe you do this and\nthen like 4 P.M rolls around and you're\nlike I mean like none of those\nindividual decisions was bad but I\nwasted the day it's already 4 o' and\nlike I don't even do anything\nso if we look at one of the key\ncomponents of happiness it is\nintention to live your life\nintentionally so I'll give you all\nanother\nexample which is if you say to yourself\nI'm going to have a day off tomorrow and\nI'm going to be a wasteful degenerate\neven if you make that an intention that\nI'm going to do absolutely nothing I'm\ngoing to try hard to do absolutely\nnothing no chores no this no this it is\nintentional\nit isn't\nreflexive it is tomorrow I'm going to\nwake up and I'm going to try very hard\nto do nothing then you will have a good\nday we're going to maximize our\ndegeneracy this is what a land party is\nyou guys get that we can play video\ngames all day long and we can feel\nterrible at the end and we can have a\nland\nParty Land party is has no regret land\nparty is great what why why is a land\nparty part so much more fun than just\nsitting at home and playing video games\non on your by yourself maybe there's a\nsocial component sure but what it really\nis is the\nintentionality I'm going to [ __ ]\nunplug my computer I'm going to move it\ninto my car I'm going to take cords I'm\ngoing to take keyboards I'm going to\npack my monitor I'm going to move for\none day you think about how stupid that\nis it's\ndumb it's dumb\nthere's this thing called the internet\nyou can play with your friends on the\ninternet unless y'all are like living on\ndifferent contents there's no lag yall\ndon't need to be on a local area\nnetwork it is objectively\nworse it's like no but at a land party\nwe're going to like get some pizza and\nwatch some anime it's like you can get\nanime you can have a watch party you can\nhave pizza and watch anime with\npeople over the\nInternet why is it that a land party is\nFun the\nintentionality this is the crazy\nthing the intentionality is what brings\nthe joy it is setting your mind in a\ndirection and going in that direction it\nis not being\nreflexive see this is the difference\nbetween being fired and quitting one of\nthem carries intention and one of them\ndoesn't\none of them feels liberating one of them\nfeels terrible\nintentionality and if we look at our\nlives today how are we living them we\nare not living intentionally we're doing\nthe exact opposite we are living\nreflexively what are the reflexes our\nreflexes are responding to what they're\nbeing responding to the stimuli of\npeople outside of us they're responding\nto the stimuli of advertisers they're in\nresponding to the stimuli of\nmicrotransactions they're responding to\nthe stimuli of\npropaganda they're responding to the\nstimuli of\nclickbait so everyone is like I really\nlike watching YouTube but I should\nreally stop I need to cut back on social\nmedia but I have trouble why what's the\nproblem do you enjoy it well yeah kind\nof so it's dope and murgic but there's\nno\nintentionality right so i' I've never\nmet a single person\nwho has like been like yeah I want to\nwake up one day and just spend the whole\n[ __ ] day browsing stupid [ __ ] on the\ninternet maybe that person exists who\nknows like I'm sure they exist somewhere\nand if even if you do it that way I\nthink that's going to be\ngreat it's\nintentionality this is what separates\nhappiness from\nunhappiness the second thing relates to\nsomething that we've already talked\nabout is hard work\nyou see we try to retreat from hard\nwork we think that okay that an absence\nof work is going to be the source of my\nhappiness and we go back to some of\nthese things like you know pick a job\nthat you love and you'll never work a\nday in your life but then the opposite\nis also true where people will say take\nwhat you love and work and then you'll\ndestroy something that you love by\nturning it into your job this assumes\nthat your job is a fixed quantity that\ndetermines your happiness\nand to have the right job which is\nscientifically true right so there's\nfluctuations in the quality of work that\nyou can do so there's certain external\nthings that are absolutely somewhat\nfixed but the crazy thing is that\naccording to this yogic path and stuff\nlike that they believe that you control\na fair amount of\nit they believe that you control even up\nto 100% of it let's say you control 50\nlet's be fair so we know from science on\ncognitively reframing and things like\nthat that there's some amount of control\nthat you have scientifically I don't\nthink we can claim 100% Buddha claims\n100% but who\nknows so the other crazy thing is that\nif you think about planning your day\noff so I know people who plan their days\noff sometimes I will plan my day off and\na lot of people will think but that's\ndefeats the purpose of a day off because\nthe whole purpose of a day off is that\nyou're not supposed to work\nand planning is working and I'm trying\nto run away from\nworking and what you will find is that\nwhen you plan your day off you will\nenjoy it so much more and something cool\nwill\nhappen when you plan your day off and\nyou make your day off\nwork you will\nblend work and fun and this is a good\nthing cuz right now work is over here\nand fun is over here and as long as\nthese two things are separate your\nhappiness will be determined by your\ncircumstances if you have a day off you\nwill be happy and if you don't have a\nday off you will be sad and I see this\nall the time on the Internet it's a very\nunderstandable sentiment people are like\nis this what life\nis I slave away at work to go home do\nlaundry cook do this I have one hour of\nrecreation a\nday for two days on the weekend one day\nof which is like getting caught up on\nstuff and like getting my car serviced\nand seeing the doctor or whatever and\nlike doing my meal prep for the rest of\nthe week so that I can eat healthy is\nthis what life\nis is just tiny tiny fractions of\npleasure amongst a slog of\neffort and we wonder why gen Z and\nMillennials are checking out\nand that's where it's like I'm not\ndisputing that jobs can be bad and that\nI'm not saying you should be a slave or\nanything like that but there is a\ncomponent of this that you can control\nthere's a component of this that even if\nyou have to work five days a week you\ncan do your best to make it enjoyable\nyou can shift your attitude a little bit\ntowards it you can change you can change\nthe the space between work and pleasure\nand one simple way to do that is to plan\nyour days off and you're going to say it\nfeels like work yes and you will enjoy\nit it's adding that intentionality and\nas you plan your days off the rest of\nyour days will become more\ntolerable so see we try to bring\npleasure into\nwork why so that we can bridge the gap\nbetween the two that's a common sense\nright Common Sense make your work more\nfun and you will have more fun\nduh what are we doing we're Bridging the\nGap but one thing we never try to do is\nthe\nopposite make your fun more like work\nthat's crazy Dr K same principle bridge\nthe gap and now we understand why it's\nso hard for people because they're only\ndoing it half 50% of the\ntime we're only opening doors we're\nnever closing\nthem so bring work into your\nfun this is something that a lot of\npeople have discovered every religious\ntradition on the plan I don't know about\nevery most of the major ones\nsay that service is the source of\nHappiness which is [ __ ]\nweird cuz I don't like doing someone\nelse's dishes I like it when someone\ndoes my dishes like what craziness is\nthis and yet just about every major\nreligion on the planet will emphasize\nservice towards other human\nbeings what are they on like what are\nthey smoking\nbut that's really how it\nis when you do service for another human\nbeing when you do your work with\nintentionality with the intent to help\nothers it takes the pain of the work and\nit makes it go\naway right so rarely nowadays but I do\nsome volunteer work and that may sound\nweird because\nI work a lot like I work six days a\nweek even on that seventh day sometimes\nI work a couple days I mean honestly\nsome many weeks I work seven days a\nweek and then I'm I'm planning on\nvolunteering at something in in the\nsummer right and\nwhy it's crazy but once you stop\nretreating from work and once you start\nembracing it and service is a really\ngood way to do that you will find that\nwork is not as scary and once work is\nnot as scary then you will have power\nover it and it will no longer have power\nover you I'm not saying that you should\npropagate some kind of unhealthy work\nenvironment but I'm saying that you\nshould not be controlled instinctively\nor reactively to the circumstances then\nby all means craft a work environment\nthat is ideal for you but don't run away\nfrom work everyone wants to win the\nlottery and retire\neveryone wants to be left to their own\ndevices I don't want anyone to tell me\nwhat to do so I want youall to really\nthink about this for a second if you had\ncomplete Financial\nFreedom who would be in\ncontrol you may say I would be in\ncontrol but what is that\nI when I talk to people who are\nfinancially free truly free I mean we're\ntalking like net worth of\nnine figures are higher and I've worked\nwith some of these\npeople what I often times find is that\nthey chase the idea of freedom but the\nfreedom that they're really chasing is\nan external\nFreedom an internal bondage then I can\ndo whatever I want to I can live\naccording to my\nwhims then I can be in full control of\nmy\ndesires I've worked with trust fund\nbabies who have bad addiction problems\nwhy because they're free they don't have\nto work they never had to work a day in\ntheir life and their life is not full of\njoy it's the\nopposite because the internal impulse\nsays this I'm going to do it internal\nimpulse says this I'm going to do it I\nwant to travel here I go there I do this\nI do this I have sex with this person I\nget high over here internal bondage\nexternal freedom and internal\nbondage and I've met some of the\nhappiest people on the planet who have\nnothing\ncrazy because we have all this research\nthat tells us\nthat you know happiness correlates with\nmoney up to $100,000 or maybe a little\nbit more and there's good reasons for\nthat right so money provides security\nfor sure can take away some amounts of\nstress and like being able to pay rent\nso it's not that money's\nbad but the problem is that when we turn\nto things like external sources of\nHappiness we're not fun fundamentally in\ncontrol of our lives so if you look at\nlike research on happiness they'll say\nyou should be happily married have lots\nof friends and have lots of money and\nexercise and\nmeditate and for some of us that's not\nan\noption we struggle to create those\nthings in our Liv so what about us does\nthat mean we're not happy this is the\nproblem with the research on happiness\nis it gives you correlations it tells\nyou external things it's not it doesn't\ntell you actions it tells you outcomes\ndoesn't tell you what you can do it\ntells you what you have to\naccomplish and then there's an\nassumption that that accomplishment\ngives that happiness which it doesn't\nbecause this is correlative\ndata so on average people who make that\namount are more happier than people who\nmake less than and there's truth to that\nI'm not saying that that's\nuntrue but we don't know the source of\nhappiness\nsource of happiness is really living\nwith intentionality is a huge part of it\nnot being reflexive is a huge part of it\nand not shying away from difficulty is a\nhuge part of\nit it's not making your life\neasy it's being okay with a hard life\nthat is the secret to happiness I want\nyouall to just think about\nthat and the the whole problem is the\neasier we make our lives the worse we\nget at being okay with\ndifficulty and so we make our lives\neasier and easier and easier and the\nwhole society is becoming harder and\nharder and\nharder I don't have to walk I can use a\nmechanized wheelchair I don't have to\nleave the house I can have food brought\nto\nme I don't even have to do my job job I\ncan use chat\nGPT to write my emails and do my work\nfor\nme I don't need to do\nanything you know I read this story\nabout someone who's like I've got four\njobs and I basically have chat gp22 all\nthe\nwork\ngreat and what do we see we see a mental\nhealth crisis is there an economic\ncomponent\nabsolutely but these two things are not\nmutually exclusive\nand so we find ourselves running in the\nwrong direction and then we wonder why\nwe ended up in the wrong\nplace we are deconditioning our minds\ndeconditioning our bodies we're taking\nthe elevator everywhere instead of the\nstairs and we wonder why we're huffing\nand puffing even walking down the street\nwithout any\nelevation the anticipation of a day off\nbrings so much joy because it's it's an\nexcuse from our hard lives we want to\nget rid of our hard lives we want to\navoid\ndifficulty and we sign ourselves up for\ndeconditioning and that's the real\ntragedy the more deconditioned you come\nyou become the harder easy things get\nand if you look at our community you\nlook at the [ __ ] internet what is the\nHallmark of the internet\ntoday easy things are hard\nI don't know what to do making friends\nis hard finding love is hard finding a\njob is hard waking up in the morning is\nhard going to sleep is hard everything\nis hard hard hard these are supposed to\nbe the easy things in life no one's like\noh [ __ ] winning a Nobel Prize is\ndifficult that's not what people\ncomplain about curing cancer is\ndifficult that's not what people\ncomplain about the easy stuff has become\nhard Society is to blame for this 100%\nbut so are\nwe people are making it harder for us by\nmaking it easier for us and the more\nthat we let them make it easier for us\nthe worse we\ndo see we are to blame We are following\nSociety\nso we talk about this kind of stuff on\nthe membership side sometimes so who's\nto\nblame so this is where we look at karma\nkarma so we give you all one last bit\nbefore we wrap up for the\nday see let's talk about blame and\nresponsibility so I think it's very fair\nto blame\nsociety because I think Society is a\nfault\nquestion is what are you going to do\nabout\nit so this is a this is such a hard\ntight rope to\nwalk in clinical\npractice when I'm working with someone\nwho who's had a history of\ntrauma it's very difficult to\nsay it's not your fault that this\nhappened to\nyou but or and you have control over\nwhether it happens again\nso when someone's in an abusive\nrelationship I don't think it's their\nfault that they were\nabused but what their life looks like a\nyear from now is in their\nhands see in life we don't get to\ndetermine what which cards are dealt we\nonly get to determine how we play the\nhand we don't get to choose our\ncircumstances in life we get to choose\nhow we play it play the game of\nlife and so this is the tricky thing is\nwe can blame society and I think it's\nfair to blame society because I think\nSociety has made some mistakes right\nthere are forces organizations out there\nthat are actively trying to make your\nlife\ndifficult and then a lot of times people\nwill ask me so like I I wrote this book\nabout how to raise a healthy\ngamer and parents will ask me all all\nthe time why doesn't someone do\nsomething about all these addictive\ngames we should ban\nthem I'm like sure right like the world\nshould be a different place I agree with\nyou people should not make addictive\n[ __ ] and profit from it I'm with you\nwhat are you going to do about\nit every's like should the world should\nbe a different place like I agree like\nI'm with you\npeople out there suck\nbro I'm one of them I used to be a\nshitty arguably still am what are we\ngoing to do about\nit so what I learned in my life is I\ncan't wait for the world to fix itself\nin order for my life to be\ngood I literally can't\nwait I'm not going to wait for what\nshould happen to happen and I remember I\nused to Maul a\nlot when I was applying to medical\nschool and failing to get in because I\nlooked at the statistics and I saw that\nbecause I'm Indian I have to basically\nhave a standardized test score that is\nin the top\n10% whereas if I was an underrepresented\nminority like a Native American\ndifferent kind of Indian then I could\nhave a score in the bottom 40% and I\ncould still get in and I looked at this\nand I raged I thought oh my God this is\ndiscrimination and racism and everything\nshould be racially\nblinded why because in this particular\ncase my race was screwing\nme and you can make those arguments if\nyou want to but frankly I think it's\nlike from a me living my life\nperspective what am I going to sit\naround and wait for racism to be\nfixed is that my strategy for\nlife doesn't sound like a good\none racism is a fact of life should we\nstrive to change it\n100% interestingly enough I don't think\nthat those admissions criteria even bad\nnowadays there's advantages and\ndisadvantages that's what we need to\nunderstand are you going to wait for the\nworld to fix itself before you start\nbeing happy or are you going to take\nresponsibility this is what it means to\ntake\nresponsibility right life is [ __ ] I'll\nagree with you the Buddha will agree\nwith\nyou and if we on other people to fix our\nlives\nlike I don't know what's going to happen\nlike I think it can happen I've seen it\nhappen before I certainly had people go\nout of their way to help me fix mine\nwithout which I couldn't be here so\nthat's pretty\ncool and you have to take some\nresponsibility what can you\ndo and so we're here to help you do what\nyou can do and this is where we talk\nabout things like Karma\nright it's your karma to be born in this\nplace with your circumstances but karma\nisn't about Destiny it's about the hand\nthat you were dealt but then you also\nhave karma in terms of the way that you\nplay the hand if you play in this way\nyou have a chance of winning and if you\nplay in a different way you have a\ngreater chance of\nwinning so we look at our circumstances\nand we get really really upset and in\ndoing so we actually surrender the\nlittle or large power that we\nhave and this is the tight RPP that's so\ndifficult to walk with people who have a\nhistory of abuse is it's not your\nfault but it is your\nresponsibility and you control your\nfuture someone else doesn't this is\nliterally what people who are abusive\nwill try to convince people they will\ntry to convince their victims that they\nwere powerless because that's when the\nabuser truly\nwins when they convince you that you can\ndo\nnothing when the world convinces you\nthat you're powerless when the world\nconvinces you that your vote doesn't\nmatter right this is what\nhappens they convince you to throw in\nthe towel and that's when you really\nlose the\ngame it's nice to stream again this is\nan absolute blessing to be with here\nwith y'all\ntoday so someone is asking so my dad\nhitting me is my responsibility\nsorry no that's what I'm saying it's a\nvery tricky tight rope to walk so let me\ntry to\nexplain see when someone is abused\nthere's a really tricky tight rope\nbecause on the one hand it's not your\nfault\nright clearly like no one deserves to be\nthe victim of abuse I don't buy\nthat and at the same time there's a\nreally tricky balance between that and\nagency so do you have power in the\nrelationship or\nnot so the moment that you give up power\nand there may be a power Dynamic\nabsolutely but the moment that you give\nup all of your power then you're in big\ntrouble so literally what happens if you\nlook at the psychology of abusers what\nthey will try to do is cut away people's\nIndependence in their sense of\npower they will try to trick people into\nthinking that they are powerless and the\nbest way to trick someone is to add\nkernels of truth right so if you look at\nsomething like a magic trick like 90% of\nwhat a magician shows you in a magic\ntrick is exactly what you see it's the\n10% that's left that is completely false\nand that's where all the money is and\nthat's how it is in an abusive\nrelationship\ntoo so I had a I was working with\nsomeone who was in an abusive\nrelationship and they were part of like\na pretty specific religious\norganization incredible power dynamics\nbetween men and women and there was a\nreligious component there was a societal\ncomponent there's a gendered component\nthis person genuinely had very little\npower no access to bank accounts no\naccess to person documents no access to\nall kinds of stuff even when they would\ncome to see\nme they would pretend to be coming to\nthe hospital this is why they came to\nMassachusetts General Hospital because\nit's a general hospital no one thinks of\nit as psychiatric treatment because they\nhave cancer centers and this and that\nand so she would come because she had\nwomen's\nissues which her abusive partner didn't\ngive two shits\nabout and so she genuinely has very\nlittle power\nobjectively and yet she has a\nlot for her to realize that there is a\nstep forward to gain more\nterritory that's what's so tricky about\nit because it's not her\nfault but unless she starts to change\nthe way that she acts this will be her\nDestiny so if that's the case then who\nhas the\npower we like to think about these\nthings in black and white but it's so\ntricky and that's what's so hard is you\nhave to\nconvince I don't know explain explore\nlearn where does the power in your life\nlie how much of it do you have in your\ntwo hands and if you accept surrender\nhow much do you have\nleft it's like the hardest thing to do\nclinically is to find this weird and I\ndon't like know what the right answer is\nbut generally speaking when I work with\npeople who are in abusive relationships\nclaiming what little power they have and\nclaiming more power over time is\nconsistently the path to\nfreedom and this is what's really hard\nespecially when you have a minor right\nbecause then there's such a powerful\npower\nDynamic and it's like the minor can't\nchoose to like leave the house at 16\nthey know have no way to support\nthemselves so they have very little\npower in the\nrelationship and at the same time the\nmoment they acknowledge that this power\nDynamic is temporary that I can still\ntake steps to start to regain control\ncontrol of my life it's beautiful that's\nhow they break\nfree I've seen this with people who are\nhomosexual also growing up in very\nreligious\nhouseholds you know get sent to things\nlike conversion therapy and all kinds of\njust really nasty\nstuff and they're able to grow out of it\nit's amazing so it's like working with\nthose people that's made me realize that\nlike we have a lot more power than we\ngive ourselves credit\nfor and the real tragedy is that we're\nunable to see it that doesn't make us\ndumb logical right cuz your whole life\nyou haven't had power like someone else\nhas been exerting it over you so the\nconcept that you're powerful is\nforeign but it's through the working\nwith these people that I really realized\nlike how much power we have in our two\nhands it's amazing what those people\nhave been capable of and I believe that\ny'all are capable of it too even if\nyou're in a bad situation I could be\nwrong maybe you're not maybe it's\nimpossible but generally speaking my\nclinical experience has been the more I\nwork with people the more hope I have\nthe more I've come to respect victims of\nabuse and how much power they're able to\ngain over time so it gives me\nhope even though despair is very\nlogical yeah so someone saying learned\nhelplessness well said right we even\nhave a term for\nit yeah so uh someone saying I grew out\nof my abuse of home only to be crushing\nin an abusive relationship that's super\nsad too because that's so common it's\nincredibly\ncommon someone's saying the concept that\nyou have all the power can be very\noverwhelming it's a lot of\nresponsibility so you don't have all the\npower but see if you have maybe a little\nbit more than you originally thought and\nsee if you can creep forward a little\nbit with more agency more agency more AG\njust see\nexplore yeah I see there are some Indian\npeople in chat horror stories there too\njust arranged marriages and all kinds of\nstuff like even family members of mine\nhave been through that it's just so hard\ndude it's so\nhard I mean there there are so many and\nthat that's what's crazy is like I I've\nseen so many cases where people have\nobjectively very little power and yet\nthey're able to take control of their\nlives like it's\nnuts and so then if that's true and it\nhappens consistently then where does the\npower lie it's something that I think\nabout a lot like I don't know it's\nweird someone's saying Indians are much\nmore Progressive now\nin some parts of India\nright in some some Indians and it's\ncrazy it it sometimes I get shocked\nbecause that's what I thought too and I\nthink that's true objectively as a whole\nthe Indian race has become more\nProgressive and that there I'm sometimes\nshocked to discover what I see and hear\nand stuff like that so\nanyway um all right thank you all very\nmuch it's been a blast I think we've got\nuh our trauma guide is now available for\npre-order so a lot of what I'm talking\nabout about power dynamics trauma abuse\nif you all want to understand some of\nthese things like there's a lot of good\ninfo in there including stuff on\nrelationships so we have a section\nspecifically about the intersection of\ntrauma and relationships which I think\nis really really important um so\ndefinitely check that\nout uh let me see what\nelse\num and schedule wise I hope yall enjoyed\nuh the viewer interviews we had recently\nit was super fun to do them for me\npersonally like I really enjoyed it it's\nnice to be able to talk to people again\num I really enjoyed vibing with y'all\ntoday chat and last thing is we've got\num members Detachment stream part two on\nWednesday and members Q&A on Friday so\ndefinitely check those out we'll\ncontinue to have regular uh video upload\nloads as well throughout the week so\nit's just more stuff if you all want it\num take care of yall thank you all very\nmuch"
