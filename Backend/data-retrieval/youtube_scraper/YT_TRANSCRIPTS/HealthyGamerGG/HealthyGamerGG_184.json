    "transcript": "there's a really interesting set of\nresearch on something called online\ndrift which is that anytime you click on\nsomething on a platform you get engaged\nwith an algorithm and what happens with\nthese algorithms is that over time the\nemotional engagement the dopam energic\nengagement will build up a tolerance so\nI'll give you all just a simple example\nwhen you watch a video on the internet\nhow many times in a row do you watch it\nif you want to spend an hour scrolling\non the internet do you watch the same\nvideo over and over and over again for\nan hour of course not that is crazy Dr k\nwhat the hell are you talking about I\nnever watch something more than once why\nbecause there is a tolerance to a signal\nthat develops so in order to avoid that\ntolerance you need a stronger signal and\nthis is what the internet has discovered\nthey're not trying to be nefarious what\nthey realize is if you're a liberal\nyou'll get some crazy conservative Echo\nchamber content every now and then or\neven a lot because the platforms have\nlearned if we can piss you off you're\nnot going to move to a different\nplatform this is online drift"
