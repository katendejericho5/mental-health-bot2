    "transcript": "so someone says Every Man Has a life\nworth living so one of the things that\nwe try very hard as therapists is to do\nsomething called empathize what is that\nmean that means that when someone walks\ninto your office and they say this is my\nlife we do our best to meet them where\nthey're at we do our best to understand\nas therapists and maybe this is wrong\nbut this is I think is fair that this\nperson has lived their life every single\nday and I have not lived their life\nevery single day and that the\nexperiences of my life don't necessarily\ntranslate over to them so if someone\nsays every person's life has value I\nagree but the reason that I agree is\nbecause of my life I see that my life\nhas value but my point is that when\nsomeone walks into your office and they\nsay this is my experience of the world I\nthink it is the height of arrogance to\nsay you are wrong and I am right because\nI haven't actually lived a day in their\nshoes"
