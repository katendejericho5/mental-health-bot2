    "transcript": "we have to learn how to live life we\ncan't Retreat from life anymore and the\nproblem is that it's easy to retreat\nfrom life because life is it's only\nuntil we start engaging with it so right\nnow what goes on with so many people\nthat I work with see talk to is that\nthey're separating their life into two\nchunks one is their virtual life and one\nis their real life and everyone is\nretreating away from the real life and\nleaning into the virtual life they're\nlike oh my God is my whole life just\nworking for years and then I get to play\ngames on the weekend and like what the\nthis this sucks and my antidote to that\nis that like start living a life that is\nworth living right it takes work I don't\nknow like when when I play video games\nfor8 hours a day I don't feel like doing\nanything in my life I don't feel like\nworking out I don't feel like eating\nhealthy I don't feel like working on a\nbook I don't feel like work I don't feel\nlike doing anything but I do want to get\nbetter at the game and so the more that\nwe invest into this dissociated part of\noursel the less we want to invest in\nthis other part"
