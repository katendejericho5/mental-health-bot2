    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about why\nresisting pornography is a bad\n[Music]\nidea so pornography is running rampant\nthrough our society right now people are\ngetting more addicted to pornography\nthan they've ever been before and there\nare a lot of good neuroscientific\nreasons for this pornography is getting\nmore visual we have VR pornography\nhigher resolution pornography everything\nis getting brighter bouncier jiggli\nright and then we also have this whole\nparasocial angle which has never existed\nbefore in the past when you were looking\nat pornography like when I was growing\nup there were things like magazines and\nthey don't even move which is one thing\nbut they certainly don't interact with\nyou right and now what we have is things\nlike only fans or other platforms where\nyou can interact with a pornographic\ncontent creator and you can form a\nrelationship with them and this can all\nbecome very addicting but there's one\nthing that we're actually screwing up\nwhich is quite paradoxical so as people\ntry to conquer por porography improve\ntheir relationship with it maybe get rid\nof the addiction one of the biggest\nmistakes that they make is trying to\nresist it now I know that sounds\nabsolutely insane but in order to\nunderstand this we have to understand\nsort of the neuroscience and clinical\nperspective on Cravings resistance and\nalso how we ultimately in addiction\nPsychiatry overcome something like an\naddiction hey y'all if you're interested\nin applying some of the principles that\nwe share to actually create change in\nyour life check out Dr K's guide to\nMental Health it combines over two\ndecades of my experience of both being a\nmonk and a psychiatrist and distills all\nof the most important things I've\nlearned into a Choose Your Own Adventure\nformat so check out the link in the bio\nand start your journey today so let's\ntake a quick look at what happens when\nyou actually try to resist a craving so\nanytime your brain wants something right\nit starts by trying to entice you so it\nsays like hey man like let's get high\nlike let's have a good time it's fun\nit's the weekend maybe it's not quite\nthe weekend it's a Monday and it's been\na hard day and oh the weekend wasn't\nquite as fun as you thought you know\nit'll come up with whatever I can to try\nto get you to use and then if you say no\nthe addiction is like H now I'm feeling\njittery come on bro like let's let's\ntake the edge off just take the edge off\na little bit right we don't have to\nparty the whole way like let's just take\nthe edge off let's just try to do this\nit'll help us work it'll help us go meet\nour friends like the rest of the day\nwe'll be good like come on man like\nlet's let's take away a little bit this\nnegativity let's move towards positivity\nand then if you say no then the brain\nstarts getting pissed like ah like now\nI'm I'm Gonna Give You withdrawal right\nyou feel this withdrawal we've got\nheadaches we've got stomach aches we've\ngot whole body pain we're gonna have a\nlittle bit of diarrhea and then if you\nstill White Knuckle it if you resist\nthen your brain gets angry at you says\n what do you think you're doing we\nneed this stuff I told you we need this\nstuff look at how much we're hurting now\nnow the headache intensifies now you\nhave diarrhea now you're vomiting and\nthen ultimately if you end up giving in\nwhat your brain kind of says is like why\ndo you make me do this to you man like\nwhy do you have to make me hurt you so\nmuch in order to get what we need right\nit's just like hunger and thirst thirst\nto your brain where if you deprive your\nbody it starts to punish you it\nliterally sends you negative signals not\npositive signals it punishes you for not\ngiving it what it wants and so I'm kind\nof reminded trigger warning of a South\nPark episode where there's some domestic\nviolence but this is literally what I\nsee that one of my patients mentioned\nthis this episode to me and he said this\nis what it feels like when I resist a\ncraving I feel like my brain starts\npunishing me for fighting it in the\nfirst place and so this is a weird\nchallenge because what ends up happening\nis as we resist Cravings our brain\nbegins to learn what kind of signals do\nI need to send to this dumbass to get\nwhat I want and so the real paradoxical\nthing that we see in addiction is that\nthe more patients resist and fail the\nmore intensive their Cravings become so\nthis is what's really different about\naddiction right because if we look at\nmost things in life as we fight against\nthings even if we lose we get better\nover time so if I go to the gym and I\nlift a bunch of weight and I can't lift\nlet's say this high amount of weight the\nnext time I go to the gym I'll be better\nat it my muscles will grow my muscles\nwill adapt right if I play chess over\ntime I'll get better at it I'll get\nbetter at swimming I'll get better at\nreading I'll get better at studying I'll\nunderstand more mathematics more\ncalculus but addiction is the one\ninteresting thing where the more that\nyou fight it the worse off you become so\nif you look at the cycle of addiction\nafter years and years and years of\npeople resisting Cravings being sober\nfor a while relapsing and then you're\nkind of back on this treadmill over and\nover again despite the fact that people\nwho struggle with addictions have a ton\nof experience their life seems to be\nmoving in the wrong direction and why is\nthat it's because of this principle of\nif you resist a craving and end up\ngiving in your brain learns this is the\nsignal that I send to this person in\norder to get what I need so your brain\nstarts paradoxically amplifying the\nCravings because it knows that I need to\ngo straight to a high level so that we\ncan skip all these first steps because\nthis is what gets me what I need and\nthis isn't just your brain doing this in\nthe case of of of addictions we even do\nthis normally for example if you have a\nfamily member who's deaf right you start\nby calling their name you're like hey\nbuddy and they don't hear you and then\nyou raise the volume you say hey buddy\nthey don't hear you and then if they're\ndeaf you start yelling and that's when\nthey hear you if you do that a couple\ntimes your brain will stop talking to\nthem in a normal voice it'll realize\nwhat signal it needs to create to get\nthe response that it wants and it's not\njust the case of deafness we also see\nthis in sort of getting our\npsychological needs met so sometimes\nwe'll see this very commonly as\npsychiatrist with kids so if a kid is\ngetting bullied at school they'll start\ncomplaining about stomach AES and it's\nnot that they're faking it it's that\nwhat happens with this child is I'm\nbeing bullied at school I go to my\nparents and I say hey I'm I don't want\nto go to school today and they don't\nlisten but the one day that I have a\nstomach ache they let me stay home so\nour brain is learning and the child\nisn't even consciously aware they they\ncan be 5 years old 6 years old 7 years\nold and then the the the body will\nactually create physiologic stomach AES\nto get the needs met so our brain is\ndesigned to get needs met and\nparadoxically if you try to resist\ncravings and fail your brain will\nintensify the Cravings to get what it\nneeds so this is where you're probably\nsaying well what are you saying Dr K\nshould I just like watch porn anytime I\nfeel like it should I just give into it\ncompletely cuz I've tried that and that\ndoesn't work no no no so let's take a\nlook at the evidence-based inter the\nthings that really work for things like\naddictions so we have things like\nPsychotherapy we have things like peer\nsupport like Alcoholics Anonymous we\nalso have certain medications we'll even\nhave things like environmental changes\nand let's go through these right so\nlet's say I'm an opioid addict when I go\nto psychotherapy let's say I'm seeing my\ntherapist am I resisting Cravings no not\nwhen I'm actually seeing my therapist\nlet's say I go to a Narcotics annonymous\nmeeting am I actually resisting Cravings\nthere no right so when I go to a\nNarcotics Anonymous meeting there's a\nlot of community people aren't like\nactively usually resisting Cravings the\nwhole point is that they're sort of\ndoing things that are not grappling\ndirectly with their illness and even if\nwe look at things of people like\nsponsors so what's the whole point of a\nsponsor here I am resisting a craving\nand what does my sponsor do with me I\ncall them up and they say hey let's go\nfor a walk let's grab a cup of coffee\nthey kind of distract me and pull me out\nof that battle the other thing that we\nknow in addiction Psychiatry is that you\nknow I've had patients for example who\nare alcoholics and members of\nfraternities or sororities and as long\nas you are hanging out with your\nfraternity buddies your sorority sisters\nwhatever and you people are drinking\naround you all the time it is very\ndifficult to resist those Cravings so\nwhat do we recommend we recommend social\ntransplant you need a new set of friends\nwho are sober because if you are with\nyour set of friends who continue to use\nit is very difficult to resist the\ncravings and this is where we also see\nthis the principle that I talked about\nwhich is that the more you resist the\nmore your brain learns hey I need need\nto induce very strong Cravings I need to\npunish this person for depriving this of\nme so what we tend to see literally what\nI see in my patients is that the more\nthat they resist Cravings the more\nintense the Cravings become and then we\ncan also look at the medications for\naddictions things like n trone or\nbuprenorphine in the case of opioid\naddiction and literally what is the\nresult of these medications nxone\nliterally reduces cravings and\nbuprenorphine is actually like a partial\nopioid Agonist which means that it's so\nsupplies the receptor that wants the\nopioids and creates a partial opioid\nsignal and so since we're partially\nsatisfying the signal it actually\neliminates Cravings because the body and\nbrain are getting what they want so our\nwhole strategy in addiction Psychiatry\ntends to be to avoid fighting Cravings\nnow there are good reasons to fight\ncravings and we'll kind of get to that\nin a second but I just want to point out\nthat we sort of see these two very\ndifferent things the first is that if we\nare grappling and B knuckling our\nCravings over and over and over again\nthat doesn't usually lead to success\nbased on our research a lot of be people\nbecome sober without ever seeing a\npsychiatrist so we're not entirely sure\nexactly what they do and on the other\nhand we see that all of our\ninterventions are not directly fighting\nCravings in fact they're used to kind of\nDodge Cravings so what should you do\nthis is where there are a couple of\nthings about pornography that are\ndifferent the first is that when we're\ntalking about resisting Cravings this is\nwhere there are a couple of things about\npornography that are a little bit\ndifferent from sub es that we can take\nadvantage of so I know this sounds\nreally bizarre but the strategy that I\ntend to use with my patients is to pick\nyour battles so instead of just randomly\nresisting the craving and then\nultimately giving into it which will\nintensify the craving the next time you\nstep into the ring what we really want\nto do is almost schedule our pornography\nuse so one of the things that I'll do\nwith my patients is sort of pick two\ntimes throughout the day where they are\nallowed to watch pornography this has a\nvery interesting effect the first is\nthat during outside of those windows it\nbecomes easier to resist but even then\nthey're resisting a little bit it\nbecomes easier to win the Battle of\npushing the pornography until 11:00 a.m.\nand 6:00 p.m. let's say at 8: or 9: in\nthe morning you get this little impulse\nand you kind of push it till 11:00 a.m.\nso you're actually strengthening and\ntraining your frontal lobe and then when\n11:00 a.m. rolls around you can sort of\nengage in it so this is really\ninteresting because we can't do this\nwith a substance use disorder and why is\nthat because in a substance use disorder\nwe have certain gen genetic\nmodifications usually to things like our\nGaba receptors our mu receptors which\nmean that if I have a little bit of\nalcohol 11:00 a.m. the rest of my day is\nshot thankfully the pattern that I tend\nto see in behavioral addictions is that\nmoderation is more accessible it's more\ndoable like so with someone like an\nalcohol addict you can't really do that\nif they have one drink they can't stop\nwith pornography addicts I'm able to see\nmore success in this way so I know it\nsounds really bizarre but just setting\naside a particular time where you're\nallowed to watch pornography the second\nthing is to generally remember that we\ndon't want to fight battles that we\ncan't win so we're going to draw a\nlittle bit on sunzo and if you look at\nsort of the the goal of addiction\nPsychiatry it is about setting up the\nfield of battle to beat the addiction so\nit is about reducing our Cravings\nshaping our environment because the last\nthing that we want to do is fight a\nbattle and lose because then our brain\nwill sort of bludgeon us with stronger\nCravings so what we really want to do is\ntry to pick battles that we are going to\nwin and and really build up those\nsuccesses and confidence because there's\none other really Insidious thing that\nhappens when we fight a craving and we\nfail over time what do we learn from\ndoing this not only does our brain learn\nto intensify the Cravings but we learn\nthat we are powerless I fought it I\nfought it I fought it and who wins in\nthe end the addiction wins the\npornography wins the alcohol wins and\nthen tomorrow I wake up I'm sure I'm\ngoing to do a prod let's go let's go and\nthen who wins in the end the alcohol\nwins I'm sober for a little while the\nalcohol wins I'm sober for a little\nwhile the alcohol wins the sober I'm\nsober for a little while the alcohol\nwins I'm sober for a year the alcohol\nwins and when this is your experience of\naddiction you begin to give up hope\nsubconsciously you don't think you're\never going to beat this problem why\nbecause the more you fight the more you\nfail and the more you fail the more your\nbrain is learning we're not going to win\nthis might as well give up and this is\nwhat we see in the cycle of addiction\npeople will be addicted for years\nlifetimes because they tried to stop\nright most people who are addicted to\nthings have tried to stop and their\nexperiences that it doesn't work I end\nup losing because paradoxically they are\nfeeding the craving they are\nintensifying the craving they don't\nunderstand these principles so they're\nactually making the problem worse\ninstead what we want to do is pick\nbattles that we can win right this is\nwhy we want to sort of restrict things\nto a particular time of the day and at\nleast you're winning from 8:00 a.m. to\n11:00 a.m. you're winning from 12:00\np.m. to 600 p.m. and what I tend to see\nin a lot of my patients is once start to\ndo this there are times where they'll\neven skip it because they are training\ntheir brain between 8 and 11 to resist\nand when 11:00 a.m. rolls around they\nsay okay do I really need to use this\nright now or can I wait until 6 p.m. so\nit's really bizarre but addictions to\npornography are a little bit different\nand we can treat them a little bit\ndifferently the next thing that we\nreally want to Target if we're\nstruggling with pornography are the\nunderlying driving forces and there are\ntwo really big ones the first is that we\nuse pornography as a source of emotional\nregulation so as long as you are\ndeveloping proactive emotional\nregulation techniques and what I\nstrongly recommend to all of my patients\nwho are dealing with pornography in\nhealthy or unhealthy ways is that you\ndevelop alternate emotional regulation\ntechniques so we know from the\nNeuroscience of pornography that in this\nway it's very similar to many substance\nuse disorders in that it sort of gives\nus dopamine and it takes away negative\nemotions because while you are watching\npornography you don't really feel a\nwhole lot of negative emotions you feel\na ton of Shame and feel like a loser and\nall that stuff afterward right because\nyou've lost and all comes the flooding\nof negative emotion so that can\nabsolutely happen so what we want to do\nis really focus on emotional regulation\ntechniques we have videos on things like\nAlexia we teach meditation techniques\njournaling talking about your emotions\nworking with a therapist engaging in\nclinical treatment all of those things\nare really good and there's one other\nthing that we want to do we just\nactually wait out the craving so there's\none big difference between pornography\nbehavioral addictions and substance use\ndisorders from a physiologic perspective\nthe longer that you wait to use a\nsubstance the more more that the\nphysiological withdrawal will increase\nthe one advantage that we have going for\nus in pornography is that if we wait in\nrelation to pornography there isn't a\ngross physiologic withdrawal that starts\nto happen so in the case of something\nlike alcohol which acts on our Gaba\nreceptors if we go cold turkey on\nalcohol we can actually do things like\ninduce seizures induce cardiac\narrhythmias and alcohol withdrawal can\nbe fatal so remember that when we're\ntalking about a substance use disorder\nthere's all kinds of physiologic things\ngoing on there's one thing that's\ndifferent about pornography addiction\nwhich is that as we wait it'll sort of\nthe craving will intensify and then it\nwill will sort of decrease and I know\nthis sounds kind of paradoxical because\nI said don't resist Cravings in the\nfirst place but this is a really\nimportant principle to understand see\nwhen it comes to physical substances the\nclock is kind of ticking against you\nthat the intensity of what you feel will\nget worse and worse and worse but if you\ncan bypass this critical point in\npornography addiction where your brain\nis trying to tell you like hey I need\nthis I need this I need this if you can\nreally just waight it out it's not about\nbeating it it's not about conquering it\nit's just about resisting for 15 minutes\n20 minutes 30 minutes 1 hour then things\nwill start to work in your favor because\nwe another mechanism will kick in in the\nbrain which is sort of this homeostatic\ntolerance so if we think about sort of\nfeeling hungry right at the very\nbeginning when my body feels hungry it\nfeels hungry and then if you don't give\nit food for a little while our body will\nsay okay fine like it's okay like the\nhunger goes away if it'll return again\nmore intensely later but our body has\nthis really in interesting principle\nwhere if it wants something and unless\nthere is an acute physiologic withdrawal\nlike if your glucose is crashing or\nsomething like that hunger pangs won't\ngo away but when it comes to transient\nNeuroscience wants when your brain wants\nsomething if you can ride out that urge\nand this is what we call Urge surfing in\nPsychiatry then things will actually be\nin your favor so I know it sounds kind\nof weird because I said don't try to\novercome the craving and at the same\ntime\nall this stuff sucks for me but I'm able\nto tolerate the negativity because there\nis a greater purpose I'm I'm sacrificing\nfor the sake of something right this is\nwhat a lot of parents will do when it\ncomes to their kids like it sucks to be\na parent it's not very pleasant\nespecially the first couple years and\nwe're okay with that because there's\nthis greater purpose so if you look at\nwhat the sort of what purpose adds to\nyour life it's not just purpose it is\nthe ability to tolerate negativity and\nthis is where pornography addiction\nreally comes in because if we can't\ntolerate negativity we will turn to\npornography so at the end of the day\nwhat we really want to do is a little\nbit unusual because we don't want to\nfight a battle and lose because this\nwill intensify our cravings and it'll\nlead to hopelessness instead what we\nwant to do is set the field of battle\nreally try to focus on things that make\nit easy to resist pornography we want to\nshape the environment around us and this\nis literally what we do in clinical\naddiction treatment whether it is\nshaping your Neuroscience neurochemistry\nthrough medications like nrex zone or it\nis shaping your environment by quitting\nyour fraternity joining Narcotics\nAnonymous whatever we really shape the\nenvironment and this is where we use\nsunzo Art of War to set the battlefield\nso that you're set up to win and then\nultimately what I tend to see when\nthings go well is that as people start\nto rack up some winds they feel hope\nthey feel power they're able to resist\nand thankfully pornography is one of\nthese things where it's not quite as\nintense of a slippery slope as some of\nthese substance use disorders so even in\nthis process people will often times use\nwhile they are building up a life that\nis worth living so I know it sounds\nbizarre but I strongly encourage yall to\npay attention to your life and look at\nwhat happens when you try to resist a\ncraving because if you resist and lose\nchances are the next battle will be\nharder to win hey Dr K how do I get my\nkid to put down the game without it\nbeing a fight every single time the\nproblem with gaming is that it tricks\nour brain into being a substitute for\nLife once we start to get our\npsychological needs met through the game\nthat's when we become addicted how to\nraise a healthy gamer combines the\nlatest in Neuroscience research along\nwith a decade of clinical practice
