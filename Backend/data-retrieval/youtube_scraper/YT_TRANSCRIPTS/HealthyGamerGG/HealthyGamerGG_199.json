    "transcript": "so if we look at the nature of the cycle\nof being a people pleaser it is that\nwhat happens in here and what someone\nelse tells me become intertwined there's\nno Independence whether you feel good\nabout yourself depends upon other people\nbeing happy with you and if you\nliterally look at that that means that\nyou are not in control of your own\nfeelings in your own life because in\norder to feel good you have to help\nother people be happy and if they're not\nhappy with you then you feel bad do you\nsee that for you to separate your sense\nof who you are from what the world wants\nyou to let me listen to what this person\nis saying let me see where this person\nis coming from and let me do my best to\nunderstand their point of view so you\ndon't have to reject it outright in fact\nyou have to be careful because a part of\nyour ego may love this and may say yeah\nnow I get to tell everyone to go\nthemselves because it's not part of my\nmasculinity that's your ego make a\nchoice on your own listen to what they\nsay and then decide okay is this person\nright in their assessment give it your\nhonest best and as long as you remove\nego from the equation you can look at\nit"
