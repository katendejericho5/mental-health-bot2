for\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nto\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\n[Applause]\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\nall righty chat let's get started\nwelcome to another healthy gamer GG\nstream my name is allo kenoa just a\nreminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if youall have a concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional and ask them strongly\nstrongly strongly recommend it so we're\ngoing to talk about that just for a hot\nsecond because I feel like people\nsometimes don't understand why this is a\ngood idea\nsee there's a lot of\ninformation on the internet especially\nabout things like health and mental\nhealth and the problem with relying on\nthat information to determine what is\ngoing on is like you know there's a\npretty famous meme about how WebMD will\ntell you that you have Myoma if you have\nthe cold or something like that oh my\ngod I've got cancer so the real value of\nseeing a professional is that you get\nsomething called differential diag\nnosis so see the practice of medicine is\nimportant not because like these five\nthings mean you're depressed like those\nfive things could lead to depression and\nwe'll talk about this today but the\nwhole point is that that constellation\nof symptoms can be caused by all kinds\nof things so it's not about whether you\ncheck the boxes see if you come in and\nyou say you have trouble getting out of\nbed every day and you can't concentrate\nand you feel sad all the time people may\nsay oh you have depress you have\ndepression you have major depressive\ndisorder but you could have bipolar\ndisorder you could have trauma and\nteasing that stuff apart is really the\nreal value of seeing a clinician right\nso they can help you understand where\nyour problem comes from actually\ndiagnose what it is and everyone on the\ninternet seems to be concerned a lot\nwith treatment they're like what do I do\nshould I take\ntestosterone should I take this kind of\nsupplement should I do this should I do\nthis should I lift should I do yoga\nshould I do tight should I\nmeditate start with diagnosis that's\nthat's the most important thing see\neveryone on the Internet is chasing\nSolutions without understanding the\norigin of their problems and this is why\neveryone keeps chasing Solutions Because\nthe Internet offers tons and tons and\ntons of T tons of solutions but which\none is right for you that's the hard\npart so absolutely go see mental health\nprofessional we're going to be talking a\nlot about mental health today we're\ngoing to be talking a lot about trauma\ntoday\num and we have an announcement in a\nlittle bit and so we really mean that\nright there's like there's Dr K which is\nsome guy who's talking to a screen I'm\nspeaking to the internet I'm not\nspeaking to you so it it behooves you\nyou deserve having someone in your life\nwho is focused entirely on you and I\nstrongly recommend that you go find that\nperson okay\nso let us\nget started so today we have an\nannouncement which we'll get to in a hot\nsecond but before we get to that\nannouncement I'm going to just check in\nwith chat and see how everybody's doing\ngive me a second where where are the\nrest of\nyou uh how do\nI\nokay I wish it was my book that is not\nthe announcement today um he's speak\ndirectly to me so much suspense yeah I I\nthink I think it's because like many\nthings at HG we're just a touch scuffed\nso let me just make sure that okay no we\nactually it is live so we will we will\nget to it in a second we just want to\nreview a couple of community posts real\nquick and before we get to the topic of\ntrauma okay so let's get to hi all okay\na second is over all right fine let me\njust do this real quick okay R quack\nas my daughter says let me do this real\nquick all\nright so I watch 365 days of uh Dr K\nvideos have I actually changed my\ntribute to Dr Kane healthy gamer hi hey\neveryone\num oh what\nthe no how do I okay there we go okay we\ncan do this um a 25-year-old thinker\nhere first off I just want to express my\nGRE deepest gratitude to all of you and\nthe HG team see this is cool because\nthey thank yall as well so good job chat\nover a year ago I poured my heart and\nsoul into creating a mini documentary it\nwas a labor of love filled with not just\nmetaphorical Blood Sweat and Tears but\nsome real ones too what I and what I\nwhat did I do once it was ready to see\nthe light of day did I share it with the\nworld nope because sharing would mean\nfacing the possibility of failure good\njob but I'm starting to think that just\nmaybe that's perfectly okay I hope that\nsharing this video now might offer\nsomeone out there the same kind of\nsupport these videos gave me Journey\nbefore\ndestination that's a I I I know it's big\nin Brandon Sanderson so this person kind\nof made let me fix this real quick um a\nvideo about like their kind of\nexperience and y'all can check it out um\nbut I just wanted to watch a little bit\nof of it with y'all we'll watch like\nmaybe a minute\nokay gamer GG knowing I'm not doing\nanything to improve my life so sometimes\nthere is content on the internet\ndesigned to help you improve your\nlife and do you know who makes content\ndesigned to help you improve your life\nwe\ndo how like it's it's one thing to to\nstart watching the right content it's\nanother thing to actually change your\n[Music]\nlife this is pretty hype\nI lost\neverything this is a video that I've\nwanted to make for months but\nunfortunately between me getting the\nidea and me shooting this video I've\ngone through more pain than I ever\nthought possible but I'm still here and\nI know that when I do come out of this\nwhenever that is I'm going to be\nstronger than I ever have I don't know\nif i' be able to say that if two years\nago I hadn't clicked on a single video\nby Dr K since then you read the title\nit's been a main say in my life but I\nhaven't just watched\n365 I've watched all 700 plus of videos\nimagine oh all of the cards in this deck\nare a video between like 20 and 2 hours\nand let's just say I were to like try to\nshow you visually I would have to do\nthat 17 more times just to to show you\nin the air all the\nvideos and so of course when I saw a\nvideo called I watch Dr K but never\nchanged the question popped in wait a\nsecond have I actually changed and when\nI sat down to record this I was like\nabsolutely but through the suffering\nthat I've been through recently it\nreally does make you wonder because the\nthing is when you fall sometimes you\nfeel like maybe I haven't changed at all\nmaybe maybe it wasn't worth it what has\nactually\nchanged I I think honestly like this is\nwhere like real healing like has got to\ntake place but in your case I think that\nhealing is going to be hard because I\nthink a f a big part of that healing is\nactually accepting that you don't need\nto be any different you suffer a little\nbit sure or you suffer a lot sure and\nthat may sound kind of bizarre because\nhere you are randomly having suicidal\nthoughts hous is not broken but that\nthat's just that's said I was going to\nwatch one minute of this but I can see\nwhy it's really hard for this to work\nbecause or everything you've tried quote\nunquote hasn't worked because bizarrely\nlike the more that you try to fix it the\nmore that\nyou reinforce the idea that you're\nbroken yes\noriginally so we'll we'll stop here cuz\nI I feel like I want to watch the whole\nthing but this is just to say that look\nwe got into\nthis to try to help people okay and\nwe've always\nbelieved\nthat yeah I'm invested too no keep going\nall right we're g to keep going chat\nfine we will do it let's go okay that's\nlet's see what happens next so first\nthing is I'm glad that this person\nuploaded this right cuz we're all\ninvested now hold on a\nsecond wait hold\non uh desktop audio so we were somewhere\naround here right okay originally this\nwas just going to be here's all the\nthings I've learned or my takeaways from\nall the videos but actually I think what\nwould be more interesting for you guys\nand more impactful is to see what it has\nbeen like to live with Dr K in my life\nfor the last two\nyears and I'm not sponsored by healthy\ngamer I want to make that clear and this\nvideo is for you whether you're a fan\nyou've never heard of him or maybe you\neven dislike him but while this video is\nabout whether has changed my life I also\nwant to make it clear that regardless of\nthat\nexploration thank you from the bottom of\nmy heart because this has been one of\nthe most positive things that I've\nwatched in the last two years and I\nmeant when I said I don't know if I\nwould be here without this content\nsound familiar\nchat I can't believe that 7 months later\nI'm still not done I wanted to record\nthis because I feel like it's going to\nbe important for me finishing\nthis I went through so much pain\npreviously but between recording that\nsegment and me filming this part I went\nfrom the lowest part of my life through\nthe best part of my life in the span of\n6\nweeks but one thing that has not\nchanged is my grit my willpower my\nprocrastination so there takeaway really\nquick watching Dr K does not magically\nchange you into a gigachad as he would\nsay and guys this has been really hard\nfor me to make so thank you the editing\nis not going to be perfect because in\nthat video he talks about this s and I'm\ngoing to resolve to do\nthis this video does not have to be\nperfect but I'm not going to quit I'm\ngoing to finish this thing and you're\ngoing to see it even if it's\nraw you might even see me\ncry I haven't decided if I put that in\nyet but the point is\nthat I'm done\nrunning and I'm finally going to put\nthis out into the world and if it helps\npeople good if it only helps one person\nthat's enough\nif you're watching this and you commit\nto it thank you from the bottom of my\nheart from going on this journey with\nme and wish me luck because I'm about to\nedit the rest of this thing and it's\ngoing to be a beast see you on the other\nside all right so let me set the stage I\nwas a student teacher on the island of\npalao in the middle of nowhere no one\naround kind of lonely so I had a lot of\ntime to watch YouTube and one day I\nhappened to click on a video called Jack\nsepai talks to Dr K about life and I\nclicked on it and was blown away it was\nactually pretty heavy and I think I\nunderstood it a little bit more later\nthan I did originally but it was so good\nthat I kind of Incorporated it into my\nroutine going forward so I'd make\nbreakfast and then I'd just throw Dr K\non in the background but what I didn't\nexpect to happen\nwas that I wasn't staying for the\nstreamers anymore I was staying because\nthe things that he was telling Jack or\nwhoever were also things that I needed\nto hear myself and this is actually\nsomething really beautiful because they\ntalk about it in one of his earliest\ninterviews with reckful and in that\ninterview they come up with this concept\ncalled AOE healing or area of\neffect healing and basically what that\nmeans for those of you who aren't\nfamiliar with like RPGs or that kind of\ngame if I were to throw like a fireball\nat someone that is a single Target\neffect there one dude I'm attacking but\ninstead if I were to unleash like let's\nremember that fireball is actually an\nAOE right 30 radius Dage but basically\nwhat happened is during this\nconversation with reckful who's a is a\nstreamer who struggled with depression\nand unfortunately lost that battle which\nI'll address a little bit later in that\nconversation Dr K told reckful that dude\nby sharing this experience we're helping\nyou but we're not just helping you we're\nhelping everyone else who's\nwatching what do you like about what\nyou're\ndoing I like I like that I'm trying to\ngive people something I wanted as a kid\nwho are you thinking\nabout\num just people have an experience well I\ndid\nyeah so I'll tell you reful listen\ncarefully now your depression you're\ntrying to cure the depression that is\ngrowing within kids out out there today\nyou're trying to protect them from what\nhappened to\nyou yeah that how does that\nfeel that feels good yeah feels\nmeaningful yeah good is an\nunderstatement\nit is vital it is crucial you must do\nthis\nthing I agree with you\nyeah\nyeah when you're struggling sometimes\nyou feel like you're so so alone and so\nto see all of these other streamers\ntalking about their stories so one\nyou're not\nalone\ntwo not only are these people\nexperiencing it but there's people that\nyou look up to who are also going the\nexact same thing and they all have their\nown stories there's so many to cover\nlike Jack sepai talks about the loss of\nhis father finding his identity Pokeman\ntalks about self-love insecurity the\npressure uh swed Anita talks about her\nexperience with just trauma and\ntourettes and there's so many other\ndifferent stories that just cover a\nwhole range of experiences and emotions\nand finally for those of us who can\nconsume a lot of\ncontent often times we feel like we know\nthe\nanswers but when you're struggling\nsometimes you don't just want answers\nyou want to know that there's someone\nelse who's going through the same\nthing in the suffering that I've\nexperienced\nrecently sometimes I'll get sick of\npeople just telling me Oh do this and\nget better this is the answer it takes\ntime healing takes time bro but to see a\nconversation with that topic explored\nhas honestly been so so helpful so yeah\nAOE\nhealing when you share your story it\nalso positively impacts the people\naround you and even outside of context\nof a stream of how has it impacted my\nlife it's made me realize wait a second\nthe suffering that I'm going through can\nactually be used to help other people\nand so I don't have to hide what I'm\ngoing through I can talk to people about\nit and if my suffering can be the cause\nof someone's\ngood holy\ncow so the V beginning of the video I\nalluded to the fact that I had been\nthrough more pain than I ever thought\npossible and we'll see if I actually\nshare this in the video but I wanted to\nclarify so I could practice what I\npreach and do that AOE healing but\nessentially what happened to me\nis of the person I've been dating for\nsix\nyears\nand you know things weren't perfect but\nI thought you know we're going to get\nmarried we've been talking about it for\nso long and so I bought a\nring and then the breakup happened and\nit was sudden oh NOS I had never been\nmore distraught in my life CU I just\ndidn't lose a person I lost a family I\nlost a future I lost plans I lost the\ncommunity I lost those\nfriends and there was a point where I\ngot so depressed that like I was crying\nagainst like a bathroom wall and I was\nlike all right I have to stand up and\nlike make my\nbed but I\n[Music]\ncouldn't I had no reason\nto the reason I share that is because\nlike a few weeks later days later even\none of my buddies went through a breakup\nas well and suddenly people just around\nme started like going through this pain\nand I could\nrelate and I was still going through it\nwe were able to get through it\ntogether and so\nyeah\nnow I wouldn't have wished myself that\npain though I see that suffering as one\nof the best things that ever happened to\nme and so I'm incorporating this into\nthe video to tie a bow on it and say\nthat if you're going through something\nlike that I promise you it does get\nbetter\nDr K talks about urge surfing the idea\nthat emotions they come and go and it's\nnot to say that the circumstances don't\nsuck and it's not guaranteed that things\nwill just magically work\nout you will at least feel\nbetter so that's my rant let's going on\nto the next part of the video I actually\ndon't remember what it was so let's see\nwhat\nhappens okay part two The Power of\nquestions and digging deeper so at this\npoint in my Dr K Journey I'm kind of\nkind of getting familiar with the\ninterviews I've watched a bunch of them\nand we're going to pause here chat so\nwe've we've gotten through 12 minutes of\nthe\nvideo you know than so I just want to\ncomment for a\nsecond first of\nall thank you very much to Brandon for\nmaking the video um you know I I didn't\nknow what to expect so this is where\nwhere someone from our community sent\nthis to to me and said hey you should\nlike\ncheck this out and I was like okay fine\nso I I never watched that before I see\nthat Brandon is in chat thanks for\nmaking the video Brandon so let's like\nremember a couple of things the first is\nthat so I know this is going to sound\nkind of weird but like I'm not going to\nbe around forever right this is very\nimportant to understand very important\nto understand I'm not going to be around\nforever so this is something that we all\nneed to accept\nso the only way this\nworks the only way this works is for\ny'all to not be dependent on\nme right this is the only way this works\nso like in life you can't depend on\nanyone else this is the sad truth of\nlife right so are other PE people there\ncan you have faith in other people\nabsolutely but the real tragedy of life\nis that life is like like you know\nyou're by yourself I mean sort\nof this is turning Bleaker than I\nexpected it to but like so the only way\nthis works is for y'all to pick up the\ntorch right and it's not that they're\nyou're alone in life I'm not saying that\nbut what I'm saying is that you can't\ncount on anyone this is\nimportant just because you can't count\non anyone does not mean that you're\nalone so this is the beauty of what we\ntry to do here\nright is that y'all can't rely on me you\nreally can't\nbecause who knows what'll happen like\nwho knows I I don't know what'll happen\nI don't know if some random freak\naccident will happen the only way this\nworks is if someone else picks up the\ntorch and the goal of this community is\nnot to make y'all dependent on me but to\nmake you independent of me the goal of\nthis community is for you to grow into\nthe person that the world needs you you\nto be and the goal of this community is\nfor you to be what someone else needs\nnow this is very important to understand\nthey can't count on you but you can do\nit this is the only way to live life\nthis is the only solution that works is\nfor you to be what someone else needs\nfor you to be what you need yourself to\nto what you need yourself to\nbe right and so like this is where I'm\nreally thrilled that people have\ngrown from being a part of this\ncommunity so I'm going to share with\nyouall some interesting data so we're\nrunning about seven research studies\nright now um maybe a couple of them are\nfinished\nbut one of the things that we saw that\nwas kind of interesting is that over\ntime we looked at people we looked at\ncoaching\noutcomes one year ago versus one year\nlater okay we looked at two time points\ntwo years apart and what we found is\nthat our coaching program was getting\nworse the percentage of improvement was\ndeclining and so we got concerned\nbecause we were like oh no does this\nmean that coaching is like was it a\nfluke does it not work and the more that\nwe looked at the data we ran into\nsomething very very\ninteresting the reason that people are\nimproving Less in coaching is because\nthey are entering\nbetter they are stronger when they start\nand then we looked at the starting point\none year ago as measured by things like\npromis scales of depression and anxiety\nversus one year later and we saw that\nthe community as a whole seems to be\nhealthier than it was one year\nago and that's when we made a really\ninteresting Discovery Andor hypothesis\nthat we we literally had a conversation\nwith a a platform that we put content on\nthat we are beginning to detect a signal\nthat simply watching\ncontent appears to and we don't know\nbecause we haven't formally studied it\nwe're putting together a study on\nit appears to improve like mental health\noutcomes by\n10% this is the change that we saw so\nthe hypothesis that we developed is\nwhat's the difference between people one\nyear ago and and today the difference is\nthat people today watched one year of\ncontent and may have applied things to\ntheir lives etc etc etc\nso like this is the only way this works\nright so like I can't be savior to the\nworld I've never claimed to be a messiah\nand for those of you all that think that\nI'm a\nmessiah you're setting yourself up for\ndisappointment and you're placing an\nimpossible burden on my shoulders\nbecause I'm not\nthe\nsimple\nright but this is what's awesome about\nthis like we started this now five years\nago five years ago was my first stream\nwe've been here for 5\nyears and it's beautiful to see that\nsome people have been helped by us right\nso I I strongly encourage yall to check\nout the rest of of Brandon's video um\nstrong work to Brandon for making it and\na message to everyone\nelse out there so I I want youall to pay\nattention to one thing that Brandon did\nwhich is that he attached himself to the\naction and not the outcome so I I saw\nwhen I first clicked on his Channel he\nhad 37 subscribers now he's got\n41 right so within like I I don't know\nhow many minutes but he's increased his\nsubscriber count by\n10% in like five minutes oh my God look\nat the outcomes there but you can't\naccept that you can't expect\nthat\num what is listen\nAly I I don't know what that means\nbut\nanyway um oh M\nokay all right yes I am actually\nsecretly the the Incarnation of the\nfreman people I'm the leader of the\nfreman um but that's our tribe I guess\nwe're the tribe of HG so so look y'all\nso so couple of things just remember\nthat you know we're here to support each\nother I'm grateful to all of y'all who\ndo all the work that you do I I don't\nknow if yall know this but I am AAR work\non our own subreddit right and\nthankfully so far no one has figured out\nhow to tag me with Dr K so I my username\ndoesn't look like Dr K and don't spoil\nit everyone if you know what my username\nis don't tell anyone so I lurk on our\nsubreddit and it's really beautiful to\nsee like what people accomplish like\ny'all helping each other is awesome I\nmean sometimes honestly the reason that\nI don't respond to some of the posts is\nbecause the answers that y'all come up\nwith are better than the ones that I\ncome up with the reason that I don't\nspend quite as much time on the Discord\nas first of all I'm not allowed to which\nis poor mods U but secondly like y'all\nare all doing great work there right and\nthis is what we did like I I can't so\nyou know I had this idea crazy idea\ncrazy crazy idea see as a psychiatrist I\ncan help\npeople but the real goal is to I kind of\nlike adopt a 4X strategic approach of\nlike early expand right so I know if you\nguys play like rtss or 4xs when like if\nyou expand early like it increases\nexponentially like your power curve if\nyou can get away with it right so I had\nan option as a psychiatrist I could sit\nin my office and work with one person at\na time or I could wrap it expand and we\ncould create as many healthy Gamers as\nwe can who would then go out each one of\ny'all is an expansion each one of y'all\nis a cc or like second town or third\ntown or fourth town and then y'all will\ngo and create impact in the world\nthere's a ripple effect there's an\nexponential ripple effect this is the\ngoal of\nAOE and what I want y'all to understand\nand I guess this is where this is going\nnow what I want y'all to understand is\nthat see a lot of people will come to\nthis community and be like oh my God\nlike how do I fix this and how do I fix\nthis and how do I fix this which is\ngreat it's good that we're trying to fix\nthose things we're going to address a\nlot of that in a in a couple posts here\nin in a hot second but the other thing\nthat I want to remind y'all of is that\nyou have a responsibility in the world\nit's not just about fixing yourself it's\nabout being for other people what people\nin this community are for\nyou right so we get so caught up in our\nown lives that we don't\nrealize the impact we can have on other\npeople and the really crazy thing is it\nis way easier to have a power powerful\nimpact on someone else's life than it is\nto have a powerful impact on your\nlife it's way easier to accomplish so\nmuch more in someone else's life from\none hour of tutoring than it is in one\nhour of studying in your own life this\nis the crazy thing about the world is\nthat helping another person is almost\nalways more efficient than helping\nyourself and this is this is the thing\nthat that people get so caught up in\nterms of Independence and you know my\nrights and I'm entitled to this and I'm\nnot responsible for anyone else and\nthat's right but like the crazy thing is\nyou can help so someone so much more\nhelp is always almost always worth more\nthan what you invest in it now there are\nsome downsides to this which we'll get\nto like we're going to talk about trauma\ntoday and so you can get into some bad\npatterns where people take advantage of\nyour help and things like that but just\nrecognize that even in your own life if\nyou're struggling in some way you can\nhave a a profound impact in someone\nelse's life in a very without doing\nmuch see let's understand this very\nclearly how much have I\nworked so I've been doing this for five\nyears right so I I try to help people\nfor 5\nyears so let's say I I put in 40 to 60\nhours a week for 5 years that's about\n2,000 hours a year over the course of 5\nyears so I've been doing this for about\n10,000\nhours have I created more than 10,000\nhours of benefit in the world I think so\nright I think that's a very clear\narguably we have we have over 2 million\nsubscribers on YouTube we've got about\n700,000 uh followers on Twitch and so I\nthink you can easily make an argument\nthat we've help we've provided a million\nhours of help and that's I mean that\nit's exponential helping other people\nthe AOE effect is exponential\nand so by all means I'm here to help you\nokay I'm going to continue do that we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about how\nwe're going to do that in in a second\nbut just because I'm here I'm going to\nhelp you and there's going to be a 10x\nfold Improvement on your end hopefully\nthat's what we're striving for and at\nthe same time I want you to go and help\nsomeone else because there will be a 10x\nfold Improvement in their\nlives that's the way that this works\nright that's the beautiful thing\nwhen you gank another Lane you can save\na game and all it takes is like 60\nseconds of your time a 60-second\nrotation can alter the course of another\nperson's entire\ngame see video\ngames see everyone's like oh my God Dr K\ndo you have a reading\nlist what should I read if I want to\nlearn about this tell me where all the\nDeep philosophy is tell me where all the\nDeep answers are all the yogic books and\nall that\nstuff right recently I've had a a couple\nof good things let me see if I can find\nit I got a book recently this one's\npretty good the rutage handbook\nof R rutti Handbook of philosophy of\nskill and expertise honestly I wouldn't\nrecommend it it's not that great it's\nokay but if you guys really want to\nlearn everything there is to learn about\nlife just pay attention to gaming play\nmore video games but play them with\nawareness because all the lessons are\nthere all the lessons are there all you\nneed to know is if you can consistently\ndo well in your video games you can\nlearn everything you need to to apply to\nyour own life\nokay all right so we have one other so\nnow we're going to come to our\nannouncement\nokay\num okay so we're going to watch a couple\nother things\nso I was recently on this podcast this\nis awesome Under the Influence is like\none of my favorite things that I've ever\ndone it was so much fun man all right so\nwe're going to watch a quick clip of\nthis okay if you guys haven't checked it\nout be sure to check it\nout yeah it's a it's a great point so\nlike we we just filmed a guide to trauma\nwhere I think you should absolutely\nwatch it I I would love to yeah so let's\nunderstand a couple things so when you\ngrow up in an unhealthy environment\nyou have to\ncompensate in order to survive or Excel\nMH so like then what happens is that you\nlearn that this compensation is the way\nto find balance so if I'm at like a\nnegative 100 I have to amp things up by\n100 points to get back to zero and then\nonce you leave the traumatic environment\nthe only thing that you what you equate\nwith moving forward is amping things up\nto 100 so then what Happ this feels a\nlittle bit too much to me like that\nwhole what's that\num this is just weird\nman where is that oh my god dude where\nis I can't find that Meme\nof okay this is what I get for\nusing yeah this is this is turning a\nlittle bit what the\nsorry chat I'm there we\ngo this is this is turning a little bit\ntoo much into this business over\nhere this is too much Chad I can't\nhandle it\nanymore I really I really can't stand\nthe sound of my\nvoice in all seriousness okay we're g to\nwatch one more thing I guess because\nI've never seen this before either okay\nso last thing last\ninstance of Dr k watching himself and\nthen we're going to get to the real\nthings okay I can only handle so much\nnarcissism at\nonce great it's trailer Apple take two\nhow do you feel all over oh look at me\nI'm a doctor oh doctor you know I like\nto gesticulate take that let's try a\ndifferent take two Comon\nMark all right let's settle hi I'm Dr k\nshould I I'm all allo kooja right\ninternet hi my name is allo kenoa my\nname is I'm excited to introduce my\nguide it sounds ooh it's mine I can I\njust say\nI'm\nI'm I'm Dr K let go come on welcome to\nDr K's guide on your journey of loving\nno sorry living in peace healing healing\nwill help you on your journey of loving\nand living so what we've tried to do is\nwe' these different perspectives\nthreaded these different perspectives\nwho wrote this you did oh my\ngod look I can do like I can do the\nactual teaching but this kind of stuff\nis just feels weird like this I can't\nyou want me do it yeah go for it okay I\ngot you you want to try give it a shot I\ngot you I got all yours you guys have\nher now hey guys I want to tell you a\nlittle bit about the latest addition to\nDr K's guide to Mental Health\nmy name is Cy I'm the CEO of healthy\ngamer I have watched Alo for about a\nyear spent every waking minute\nresearching trauma the team has pulled\nover 200 studies 400 actually 400\nstudies holy trauma is the missing link\nI think for this community we've been\nlucky enough to support thousands of\nmental health Journeys all over the\ninternet\nand it's heartbreaking really to see how\nmuch trauma there is in this community\nso it's going to take you through the\nphysiology the emotions relationships\nspiritual perspectives and clinical\nperspectives everything you need to know\nto really just move step by\nstep it's really such a privilege to be\nable to get to do this with and for you\nguys it's made with a lot of love I\nreally hope it helps all the information\nyou need is in the links below thanks\nnice that is so much better that was\nreally good let's\n[Music]\nplay let's give this a\nshot welcome to Dr K's guide to\ntrauma that sounds\nweird now yall can see how I spend my\ntime on\nYouTube all right so this is our\nannouncement I made a guide to\ntrauma and um let me just tell y'all\nreal quick about\nwhy um give me a\nsecond okay so let's talk about trauma\nfor a second so why did I make a guide\nto trauma so first of all I love\nstreaming I love hang out with y'all I\nlove doing this kind of stuff this is\ngreat this is so much fun and the\nproblem is that when we make content on\nthe internet people tend to have a\nslightly shorter attention span people\nare kind of coming in and out and then\nthere it's very difficult to integrate\npractices exercises Etc with the\ninformation this is why we made guides\nbecause people ask us these questions\nover and over and over again we always\nget the same question which is fine\nright so we wanted to create certain\nresources is that you could go from\nstart to\nfinish on the the guide right so that's\nwhy we made it so I held a trauma\nWorkshop which sold out basically in 24\nhours and the trauma Workshop the people\nwho were in the trauma Workshop said\nthis is one one of the most like awesome\nthings that we've been a part of from\nour perspective it was incredibly\nsuccessful we got overwhelmingly\npositive feedback and so then the\nnatural thing is like okay let's do\nanother one and we may do that at some\npoint but what we really discovered was\nthat the need\nfor people this perspective on trauma\nwhich we'll talk a little bit about is\nit seem to be very helpful to people so\nI'm going to kind of give youall a quick\noverview and then we're going to talk\nabout a couple of posts and we'll lay\nthis stuff out for y'all\nokay so uh the guide has so first thing\nto understand is that trauma is like way\nmore common that we think it is so if\nyou look at the research on trauma\nbasically there's like a really\ninteresting direction that the search\ntakes so the first version of trauma\nthat we kind of discovered was something\ncalled shell shock which was something\nin that we discovered around World War I\nI mean there's older historical stuff\nbut let's just start with shell shock so\npeople notice that okay soldiers coming\nback from World War\nI were like had all these weird symptoms\nthey basically had PTSD and so doctors\nat the time were like okay this is\ncalled shell shock because they were in\ntrenches and a bomb blew up near them\nand it like concussed their brain which\nis why they're struggling right now and\nthen World War II roll P around and then\nwe noticed that okay people are having\nthese symptoms even though an explosion\ndid not happen near them okay so now\nshell shock doesn't require an act\nactual explosion it seems that if you're\nexposed to some kind of gruesome stuff\nin combat you can get PTSD fair enough\nand then as we developed this clinical\nentity clinicians started noticing that\nhold on a second like I'm seeing this\nconstellation of symptoms in people who\nhave never been in a combat situation\nand then we started to see that oh okay\nthese people were physically abused now\nI understand so they weren't in a combat\nsituation but they were physically\nabused growing up now this makes sense\nand then we started to see this this\npattern in people who are not physically\nabused and then we got even more\nconfused and we're like what's happening\nhere oh there's emotional\nabuse and then eventually we had a a\nsection of research that started to\ndevelop on adverse childhood\nexperiences so we discovered that trauma\ncan be caused by all kinds of things and\nthat 60% of the population has at least\none adverse childhood experience people\nwho have four adverse childhood\nexperiences the this can be everything\nfrom having an abusive parent to having\nparents go through divorce to even\nmoving a lot as a child right where you\nhave to find new friends all the time\nand things like that you have to leave\nyour old friends behind you're always\nthe new\nkid if you have four adverse childhood\nexperiences the risk for a mood disorder\nincreases drastically so there are even\ntheories now where we had um a a guy\nnamed uh Mark Horowitz on stream a\ncouple months ago brilliant dude who was\nsort of saying he published a paper in\nmolecular Psychiatry saying that the\nneurochemical imbalance uh hypothesis of\ndepression is false so when you ask him\nhe's like it's not a serotonin imbalance\nthis is something that was propagated by\nbig Pharma he says that basically major\ndepressive disorder and bipolar disorder\nare more likely to be linked to trauma\nearly in childhood etc etc this is his\nbelief okay I think there's some\nevidence of\nthat so what we're sort of disc what we\ndiscovered is that trauma is way way way\nmore common than we realized and let's\nunderstand\nwhy so trauma is the only in my opinion\nmental illness that is not a\nmalfunction it's the only mental illness\nthat is an\nadaptation this is why it's so common so\nthis is something that's very important\nto\nunderstand see when we go through an\nexperience our brain our body our\nphysiology our mind everything adapts to\nsurvive the problem is that the lessons\nthat we\nlearn when we are facing terrible\nsituations allow us to survive that\nsituation adapt to that situation but\nbecome maladaptive later in life this is\nwhat trauma is it is an adaptation that\nbecomes a maladaptation it's not a\nmalfunction it is a lesson that no\nlonger applies so for those of y'all\nthat are high rank in a particular video\ngame you will understand this when you\nsee low rank players playing games\nbecause they develop adaptations that\nwork at their their rank which are\n dumb so for those of y'all that\nplay Dota 2 this is like first item\nMidas on a support I don't know what the\nequivalent is in the game of your\nchoice right maybe it's a six pool\nZergling Rush or whatever there's just\ncrap that work Works in crappy\nsituations that stops working the more\nthe more advanced you get and this is\nwhat trauma\nis it is an adaptation that becomes a\nmaladaptation and so what we've tried to\ndo what I saw in this community more\nthan anything else was trauma trauma\ntrauma trauma trauma I saw it at the\nroot of so many different things that we\ndiscuss and so even the approach to I\nwould say 50 to 80% of the content that\nwe make the lectures I put together\ntogether are actually from a trauma lens\nit's about helping y'all understand how\nyou became the way that you\nare we have to understand the road that\ngot you here in order to understand the\nroad that gets you out this is what the\ntrauma guide is for it outlines this\nstep by step and I got super excited\nabout the guide because for me something\nclicked so the thing that was really\nfrustrating for me and confusing for a\nlot of people is everyone\nwonders what's the problem and I know\nthat's a weird question but I mean like\nokay I'm depressed does that mean I need\nto eat differently does this mean I need\nto exercise should I meditate should I\ngo to therapy should I take medication\nsee if you look at the world right now\neveryone offers so many different\nsolutions but which solution is Right\nwhich one should I\ndo and we all say so we don't use this\nword often on purpose because it's such\na Charged word I hate the connotations\nof this word holistic\nwhat the does that even mean and oh\nwe take a whole body perspective we take\na holistic perspective everyone else\nthey take a you know but I'm holistic\nholistic just means you charge 20% more\nfor whatever you offer and people feel\ngood about\nthemselves but here's the challenge\nright which what should I do I do do I\nneed to see a dating coach or do I need\ntestosterone injections should I lift\nmore or see a therapist\nshould I meditate or go to India to find\nmyself for a month everyone has all of\nthese answers no one knows how to stitch\nthem together that's the goal that I set\nout to do I'm not even saying I\nsucceeded whether I succeeded or not\ndepends on what y'all tell me this is\nwhat I tried to do to stitch together\nall of these disperate experiences and\nthis is where trauma comes in because\ntrauma is a whole\nperson experience\ntrauma changes your physiology it\nchanges your\nbrain once your physiology has been\naltered with something like\nhypervigilance where you become hyp\nsensitive to stimuli once a benign\nnormal stimulus triggers a adrenaline\nresponse and launches you into a panic\nattack the life that you live changes\nnow you can't socialize like regular\npeople because you're getting triggered\nand your adrenaline is pumping through\nyour your body your heart rate is elated\nyour blood pressure is very high your\nthoughts are not you're not focused on\nempathy you can't pay attention you're\nnot having a good time this impacts your\nability to socialize create social\nisolation which then Cascades down into\ndifferent effects so what I've tried to\ndo with the guide to trauma is to stitch\ntogether these perspectives when\nsomething bad happens what happens to\nyour physiology what happens to your\nbrain when something happens to your\nphysiology in your brain that changes\nyour emotional\nexperience once your emotional\nexperience has changed along with your\nemotional experience changing your\nthoughts will\nchange once your thoughts and emotions\nchange the person that you become\nchanges your identity changes once your\nidentity changes your relationships will\nchange because now you are a different\nperson once your relationship changes\nyour circumstance\nchanges we've tried to stitch together\nall of these pieces so that you can\nstart start at the very beginning with\nsomething like a simple physiology\nphysiological practice understand things\nlike a\ndissociation understand things like\nhemispheric lateralization which is what\nhappens in\ntrauma this is when we this is literally\nwhat leads to things like dissociation\nbecause we get disconnected from our\nemotions but once we get disconnected\nfrom our emotions our sense of identity\nchanges why because what is the science\nof how identity forms think about your\nidentity for a second how do you know\nwho you are it's not because of all the\nactions that you take right you've eaten\nlunch every day for your life but what\nyou eat for lunch is usually not a part\nof your identity your identity is formed\nbased on the emotional experiences of\nyour life when I talk about who I am\nwhat do I talk about I talk about\nfailing out of college this is a huge\npart of my\nidentity that's because it's an\nemotional experience if we look at\nsomeone who's blackpilled why are you\nblackpilled well I got screwed in this\nway this defines my life this is who I\nam so once we dissociate from our selves\nonce we stop experiencing emotion our\nidentity gets locked into place this\ngets further exacerbated by\ntechnology because what does technology\ndo numbs our\nemotions this is why we have a\ngeneration of people who are stuck in an\nidentity that they do not know how to\nchange and once you have an\nidentity this shapes your future right\nbecause once I see myself as a loser\nonce I see myself as an incel this\nbecomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy so this is what we tried to do\nwe tried to break apart every single\nsection so what is the physiology what\nis the Neuroscience how does this shape\nthings like motivation cognition emotion\nidentity relationships spirituality this\nis what we tried to put\ntogether and right now it's what I think\nthe community needs the most I invested\na lot of time like Ruthy said we went\nover I I read through 400 research\npapers and there's a whole team here at\nHG that helped put this together we have\na team that looked through all the\nscripts and edited a bunch of stuff and\nI mean it's it's a huge huge huge\ninvestment and so we built it because we\nthink this is what the community needs\nand already people are going to be\nwondering what's next so probably\naddictions will come next is what I\nthink but we're not done unless yall\ntell us this is not useful at which case\nwe will be done\nokay so this is what we've tried to put\ntogether so the the reason I'm very\nexcited about\nthis is\nthat I believe that this trauma guide\nhelps you understand how you became the\nperson that you\nare and if you understand how you became\nthe person that you are you understand\nthe levers that shaped the person that\nyou are today we can equip you with the\nability to change those levers you can\nmove the levers up and you can move the\nlevers down and you can craft yourself\ninto the person that you want to\nbe this is why I built this guide to\nhelp you understand how you became what\nyou are and how you can become whatever\nyou want to\nbe so I strongly recommend yall check it\nout right it's something that I built\nfor y'all so I was thinking about this\ncommunity there isn't a thousand\ndifferent things about medications and\nthis evidence-based treatment there's\nsome of that stuff because that's an\nimportant part of it right so there's a\nclinical perspective which we always add\nbut the focus is that this is something\nthat one person can understand because\nthis is what what trauma is is the\nscience of\nadaptation this is what trauma\nis and if we understand the science of\nadaptation we can craft the adaptations\nthat we want to we can undo the\nadaptations that happen to us\nautomatically the great tragedy in life\nis that most of the adaptations that we\nmake are unconscious 99% of them\nunconscious we don't choose what we\nbecome what we become happens to us but\nthere is a process there is a science to\nit and if you understand that science\nyou can change the person that you\nbecome I believe this 100% there's\nplenty of evidence to support this too\nbecause this is what we do in\nevidence-based Psych therapy and Trauma\ntreatment we'll go into some of that\nkind of stuff okay\nso um the guide gets released on May\n19th yall can pre-order right now for\nfive bucks off you can get for $25 I\nknow a lot of people get concerned about\nwhy we charge money for stuff we charge\nmoney for stuff because it costs money\nto make and for those of y'all um and we\nwe're going to address a lot of this\nstuff we try to still build a lot of\nfree stuff right so we never slow down\non what we build for free so all of this\nstuff is extra so even today what we're\ngoing to do is focus on a set of trauma\nrelated posts where we will explain some\nof the principles in the guide and if\nyouall want more information you can\ncheck out the guide but it is never Our\nintention to gate keep help never there\nis just a reality of the world that we\nlive in which is that some things cost\nresources in order for to build those\nthings we need resources that's it okay\nso we're going to jump into some posts\num okay so thank youall for some people\nare saying the price is 30 it should be\nthere should be a pre-order right now\nbut thank you all for letting us know\nI'm sure our team will look into\nthat okay so let's get to posts back to\nvibing chat let's\ngo okay having trauma feels so cringe\nsometimes like oh look at me look at my\nmom was mean when I was little and it's\ngoing to continue to affect me and all\nmy relationships and oh for the rest of\nmy life life\nah yeah so this is exactly what I'm\ntalking\nabout so see this is what we need to\nunderstand about\ntrauma we think about events as\ntemporary\nokay so like the effective events we\ngenerally think of as temporary like if\nI'm on a shitty flight to somewhere then\nas long as I'm on the flight I'm\nsuffering but once the event is over the\nsuffering should go away right now that\nI'm done with this bad relationship I\nshould be normal now this would be\nabsolutely true if we were stupid as\nhumans but the real tragedy of being a\nhuman is we have this\ncurse called\nmemory we have this curse called\nlearning\nso when we have an\nexperience if you are\nunlucky and intelligent and have the\ncapacity to remember your brain and your\nbody will make\nadaptations and then the problem is that\nyou carry this forward into your next\nexperience this is why if yall play like\nLeague of Legends or Dota or OverWatch\nor whatever each of us on the planet due\nto the principles of Karma and the\nhatred of God detest one particular\nChampion or\nhero and the moment that you ceue up for\na game someone selects that champion or\nhero and you are triggered already the\nenjoyment of the game has been shattered\nand you haven't even played it\nyet memory\ntrauma\nright so we look at ourselves and we\nthink to ourselves this was in the past\nit should not affect me\ntoday but for the same mechanisms that\nallow us to remember addition allow us\nto remember to ride a bike those same\nmechanisms are at play when you have a\nrelationship with your mother let's\nunderstand this there's a whole lecture\non a couple of lectures on\nattachment and even like sex and how sex\nand attachment relate and things like\nthat in the guide so let's understand\nthis\nwhen we have a relationship with our\nparents what do we carry forward with us\nthe relationship with our early\ncaregivers teaches us the rules of\nintimate\nrelationships teaches us what is okay or\nnot okay in Intimate\nRelationships right this is how we learn\nhow do we learn what's okay in a\nrelationship we have to have some basis\nof experience\nand so when you go to school your\nrelationships with your teachers will\ndetermine what kind of relationship you\nhave with other instructors other\nmentors Etc so our brain sort of\nunderstands okay this is like a power\nDynamic relationship where there is a\nteacher and there is a learner this is\nhow teachers and Learners relate to each\nother right so like I had some patients\nand like my parents' generation they\nwould go to some Catholic schools in\nIndia where there were nuns who were\nphysically abusive they would smack\npeople with rulers and it was their\nfavorite thing to do apparently and so\nwhen you're in that environment as a\nchild you learn a particular role you\nunderstand what's supposed to\nhappen right so when someone doesn't do\nwhat they're supposed to do you're\nsupposed to hit\nthem that's the lesson that you learn\nand you carry that lesson forward the\ntragedy of having a bad experience with\na parent is that this is the\nPlaybook that you will have for your\nfuture intimate relationships\ncue daddy issues and mommy issues what\ndoes it mean to have daddy issues and\nmommy issues it means that we learned a\ncertain way of relating to this\nparticular gender in an intimate\nrelationship which carries\nforward so if you pay\nattention to people who have toxic\ngender\nattitudes very few of them have very\nvery healthy relationships or with their\nparents or their parents had healthy\nrelationships with each other very few\nof them right these are the lessons that\nwe learn and then the real tragedy is\nthat we go on beating ourselves\nup because we look at other people who\nare able to move past things and let's\nunderstand why you can't move past\ntrauma because once again we think the\nevent is over so the effects should\ndisappear right now that I'm out of the\nswimming pool or the ocean I should no\nlonger be wet very\nlogical the problem once again is that\nthe body remembers the problem is that\nthere are epigenetic\nchanges what is an epigenetic\nchange see our DNA usually does not\nchange very much over the course of our\nlife but which parts of our DNA get\nactivated the threshold to turn on some\ngenetic Machinery at absolutely\nchanges this is why people who have been\ntraumatized will have hypervigilance\nwhat does that mean that means that a\ndoor slamming for me or you is just a\ndoor slamming we may get startled a\nlittle bit but someone else literally\ntheir the way that their genetic\ntranscription has changed will make a a\nslamming door feel like impending\ndoom so the reason that we can't put\ntrauma behind us is because it literally\nedits the source code of our body and\nedits the source code of our\nmind and this is why it doesn't fix\nitself because most of the time we're\nonly in readon mode this is very\nimportant to\nunderstand what puts us into edit mode\npowerful emotions and\nexperiences the more powerful the\nemotion the more transformative it is\nthis is when the brain goes into edit\nmode it's not only read now we can edit\nthings and the real tragedy of trauma\nwhen you're growing up is that your\nbrain is in edit mode but what are you\nediting are you editing good things or\nare you editing bad things no we have\nall this beautiful code and we're just\ngoing in there and we're\njust cuz we're like\nsix and then this lingers and carries\nwith us shapes our future because of the\nway that our genes have been activated\nthe way our physiology works even the\nchanges in our brain\nso one of the things that we know one of\nthe\nadaptations in the brain during trauma\nis decreased activity across the Corpus\ncolossum we have our left hemisphere and\nwe have our right\nHemisphere and in the middle we have\nthis thing called the Corpus colossum\nthat connects the two hemispheres the\nright brain is where we experience a lot\nof emotions the left brain is where we\nexperience a lot of\nanalysis we enter flow States when these\ntwo things are talking to each other\nwhen we have a whole brain\ninvolvement in trauma we separate these\ntwo things because there are too many\npowerful emotions we can't handle it so\nwe need to shut it off so we get into\nthings like dissociation and\ndepersonalization where you feel\ndisconnected from your life what is\ndisconnected you can still smell you can\nstill see you can still think what's\ndisconnected emotions you can taste but\nthere's no\npleasure you can detect that there is\nfood in your mouth but there's no\ndeliciousness the good news\nis that there's also no\nbitterness you can see that you are\nbeing hurt but there's no\nsuffering now we've run into a problem\nthough because in order to protect\nourselves from suffering we have\ndecreased activity across the Corpus\ncolossum so when we numb ourselves to\nthe suffering of life we also segregate\nourselves from the joy of life and this\nis the problem in\ntrauma in order to survive you have to\nsacrifice\njoy and then how are you supposed to\nlive this is what we want to help you do\nand therapy works wonders too by the\nway\nokay let's move\non okay\num does anyone else feel like they use\ntheir trauma for attention I struggle\nwith letting people in and making\nfriends due to my abandonment issues\nI've been working on said issues for a\nwhile now and finally have a friend that\nI open up to whenever I'm feeling\ndepressed or that I'm falling apart my\nissue is that when my friend gives me\nmore attention than they usually do\nwhenever I start falling apart I start\nto feel guilty about for two reasons it\nfeels like I manipulating them into\ngiving me more attention because the\ncause of my trauma happened a couple of\nyears ago there's a part of me that\nfeels like I should be past it by now\nand that it should not affect me now so\nI'm wondering if there's anybody else\nthat feels this\nway so we already covered part\ntwo so let's talk about\nthis so sometimes\nthere are concerns that people use their\ntrauma to get\nattention so let's understand this very\nvery simply\nokay so as\nwe demonstrate that we are hurting we\nsignal to another human being I'm\nhurting and then the human being does\nwhat a compassionate human being does\nwhich is if you are hurting let me give\nyou more attention\nnow let's pause for a second and\nunderstand what are the different ways\nin which we can respond to someone\ncaring for us when we are experiencing\npain so if I'm hurting and someone comes\nto me and says hey are you okay what are\nthe different things that I could feel I\ncould feel gratitude towards this person\nI could feel safety I could feel\nrelieved I could also feel like they\ndeserve to be helping someone else I\ncould feel guilt that I can't handle\nthis on my own I could feel pathetic\nthat I need this person's help\nanyway I can have a whole range of\nresponses so what determines which\nresponse I\nhave which response I was conditioned to\nhave this is very important to\nunderstand so it is very\ncommon for people who have a history of\ntrauma to feel guilty to feel like you\nare manipulating them into giving me\nmore atten ention this is what people\nfeel all the time the question is why\nwhere does this come from very\nsimple see there's a group of people I\nmean I'm oversimplifying here right so\nit's worthwhile to go see a clinician\nbut this is the pattern I've observed as\na doctor working with these people and\nI'll will ask them one very simple\nquestion when you are hurting as a child\nwhat was the response that you got what\nwas the lesson that you were\ntaught often times the the experience\nthat they have growing up is that their\nparents got mad at them for\nexpressing needs or\nhurt right parent is overwhelmed I don't\nhave time for this crap you're doing it\nfor\nattention see when a child is taught by\na caregiver that your needs are a desire\nfor attention and there's all kinds of\nstuff that could be going on in the\nparent parent is and we're not even\nsaying that the parent is bad right it's\nnot even that the parents are abusive\nlet's understand this very\nclearly parent is working 2 and a half\njobs parent literally does not have the\ntime to attend to the the child's needs\nchild comes and says mommy or daddy I\nhave a boo boo we have a single parent\n50% of households are now single parents\nclose to 50% parent doesn't have the\ntime so if you were a parent who loves\nyour\nchild and your child is hurt and you do\nnot have the time to take care of them\nhow do you feel guilty guilty guilty\nguilty guilty guilty you're burnt out\nyou're fatigued you lose sight of that\nguilt you don't even realize you feel\nguilty that guilt takes\nover and when the guilt takes over you\ntell the child I don't have time for you\nyou feel so bad it feels so bad you have\nto get the child to stop because if the\nchild stops telling you that they need\nyou then the guilt goes away so this\nhappens with parents they don't even\nrealize it because one day you try to\nhelp them and then you feel exhausted\nand one day you\nsnap as a parent you\nsnap like I don't have time for this you\nshould be able to take care of this\nyourself you're 8 years old now you\nshould know how to do this I know you\nknow how to do this I've said that as a\nparent and then the child looks at this\nand\nrealizes oh crap I should be able to\nhandle this they feel guilty now you've\ndone what all parents do you have an\nemotional umbilical cord see the\nphysical umbilical cord gets severed\nwhen you give birth emotional umbilical\ncord can be there for\nyears and now you make the child feel\nguilty you've transferred your\nguilt and then the child learns okay I\nshouldn't complain and then they stop\ncomplaining and then what does the\nparent learn the parent learns oh\ninteresting subconsciously they learn\nthat if I yell at my child my child will\nstop complaining right it's not rocket\nscience and so now the parent has\ndiscovered a way to no longer feel\nguilty for not being able to provide for\nthe child's needs all I have to do is\nyell at the kid a little\nbit and the kid figures it out\ntoo and so now the child goes through\nlife\nbelieving that if someone provides for\nmy needs this is not right I should be\nable to handle it myself I should be\nable to handle it\nmyself this is the lesson that the child\nlearns and think about our community\nright so I'm talking to you now or 50%\nof y'all how many of you say to yourself\nI should be able to handle it where did\nyou learn that because someone told you\nyou should be able to handle it someone\nshamed you for not being able to handle\nit that's why you feel that way this is\nlearned it is an\nadaptation so if we go back to this post\nvery\nsimple why does some one believe that\ntrauma is used to gain attention because\nthey were taught that\nliterally you're doing it for\nattention right kids get stomach aches\noh he's doing it for\nattention kids feel sick he's doing it\nfor attention he's\ncrying fat little kid he's doing it for\nattention this is why we feel this way\nthis is the adaptation this is exactly\nwhat I'm talking about does it make\nsense now you were taught that having\nneeds is a cry for attention instead of\nhaving\nneeds very\nsimple so this must be\nunwired right there a couple of things\nthat we can do to unwire it first thing\nto do is go back to the source of where\nyou learned this lesson and this is what\ntherapists are very good at right so I\nthink therapist therapy is the right\nthing to do here so coaching can help\nsome but I would honestly recommend\ntherapy in this case not\ncoaching you can do things like\njournaling or whatnot but really go back\nto the root of where did you\nlearn that asking for help is\nmanipulating where did you learn that\nyou don't deserve help where did you\nlearn that you should be able to handle\nit\nyourself and then once you go back to\nthat that time there'll be some emotions\nthere you want to digest those emotions\nwe've talked about that a fair amount we\ngo into a lot of different techniques\nand meditations and all that good stuff\nin the guide like we always\ndo the second thing that you can do is\nnotice it in the\npresent so anytime you notice something\nthe power of that thing\ndisappears The emotionality of it\ndisappears now you may be kind of\nconfused by that but let's understand\nthis see a joke is funny until I dissect\nit\nright a magic trick is magical until I\ndissect\nit so the emotional impact of a thing\nonly happens when we are\nunaware the moment that we dissect\nsomething the moment that we become\naware of something the moment that you\nrealize this person is trying to\nmanipulate\nme then you become resistant to the\nmanipulation who is the easiest person\nto manipulate the gullible person\nbecause they have no\nawareness literally what does gullible\nmean easy to manipulate what is the\nnature of a gullible person someone\nwho's unaware who trusts too\nmuch so awareness in the present of this\nkind of thing all you have to do is\nacknowledge in this moment now I'm\nfeeling embarrassed for needing\nsomeone's help wow there it is again\nthere's that little kid right so we've\ntalked about this in in different\ninterviews and things like that right\nwhere we we teach people how to talk to\nthemselves and this is what if youall\nreally need help with therapy is good\ntops okay so notice it in the\npresent as you notice it it will be\ndissolved a little bit the more you\nnotice the more dissolved it gets we're\njust dissecting the joke right in the\ncase of a joke it screws it up because\nwe want that kind of thing but in the\ncase of something like a trauma response\nwe want to digest we want it to be\ngone\nokay all\nright okay I see that question how do\nyou stop dark internal\ndialogue so this is also kind of the\nsame thing so you have to understand\nthat internal\ndialogue comes from thought generating\nmachines in the\nmind right there's a thought generator\nso I don't know if you guys ever play\nthis game called\nGauntlet so in Gauntlet there are these\nlike little caves and huts and stuff\nthat spawn\nenemies so anytime we get traumatized\nthere's something called a samcara that\nforms a sscar is a ball of undigested\nemotion and that ball lives in our\nsubconscious and will populate thoughts\nso in CBT we call these automatic\nthoughts we can call them their core\nbeliefs lead to automatic thoughts what\nis a core belief it is something that is\nin your subconscious that generates\nthoughts like a a vent that is bubbling\nup air in the ocean as long as the vent\nis there the bubbles will come up and\nusually to close the vent we can digest\nthat emotion so you can use the same\ntechnique for dark internal thoughts the\nfirst is to recognize the origin of\nthose thoughts when did I learn this\ntruth don't worry about whether it's\ntrue or not see this is where a lot of\npeople get tripped up with negative\nself-beliefs they try to argue\nthemselves out of\nthem so this is just dealing with what\ncomes through the portal it's not\nclosing the\nportal there's a portal to an outer\nplane in which demons are trickling out\nof and here we are aggroing the demons\nand defeating the demons one at a\ntime if we really want to fix this\nproblem we have to close the\nportal and where was the portal opened\nup see when you were\nhappy the portal wasn't there so\nliterally some kind of event creates the\nportal right there's happy you and\nthere's unhappy you and these dark\nnegative internal thoughts are unhappy\nyou you weren't always like this there's\nsomething that taught you these thoughts\nso go back to that event which is\nusually an undigested emotional\nevent and work through that as you work\nthrough that the portal will start to\nclose\nthe second thing that we can do is once\nagain observe the thoughts in the\npresent ah my mind is thinking this\nagain the other problem that we have\nwith dark internal thoughts is that we\nengage with them we fight\nthem we try to conquer\nthem but the problem with trying to\nconquer them is that sometimes it can\nwork and sometimes it can even fix the\nproblem but\nusually we kind of get\nexhausted from that combat and then\neventually they'll start to trickle out\nor something will go well in your life\nfor a few months and then some negative\nevent will happen which will turn on the\nportal\nagain so just observe the action of your\nmind see anytime we engage with our mind\nthe Mind trickles forward so I'll give\nyou all a simple example\nright so if I engage with a troll if I\ntry to argue with a troll on the\ninternet I'm not going to get anywhere\neven if I conin convince him or her that\nI right and they are wrong it doesn't do\nanything about the other trolls when you\nengage with a troll what happens the\ntroll will will engage back and then you\nget caught up in\nit the more that you recognize ah this\nperson is trolling then you don't even\nwant to engage and then the troll\nrequires your input in order to\ncontinue do you all get\nthat your thoughts require your input to\npropagate that is literally why they try\nto engage you so\nheavily see a really good example of a\nthought that struggles to engage you\ndark internal thoughts is thoughts about\nyour\nex so what does your what does your mind\ndo when you have dark internal thoughts\nabout your\nex it asks you to go stalk them on\nsocial\nmedia now if I were to ask you are you\ngoing to be happy with what you see 99%\nof the time you know that the answer is\ngoing to be no so why the does your\nmind do it because the mind wants\nengagement it wants energy it wants to\nstay\nalive and as you go look at your ex and\nyou see pictures of them with somebody\nelse the dark internal thoughts oh my\nGod it's like Nitro\nboost you punish yourself why why why\nlook at what's happening look at what's\nbeing reinforced\nit gives the thoughts more energy and\nnow they have more stuff to work with\nand here's the one thing to understand\nwhen you have dark internal thoughts\ndark internal thoughts are an antidote\nto one thing 100% of the\ntime\nboredom when your mind is torturing you\nno one's\nbored and what you will find is that if\nyour mind tortures you the more bored\nyou become the more you torture yourself\nbecause now I'm I it's like cannibalism\nof the mind it's feeding on itself and\nthis is why we love distraction because\nthen the mind doesn't need the dark\ninternal thoughts as long as it's\ngetting something\nelse but it's going to eat\nsomething so observe all of these\npatterns and the patterns in the mind\nwill start to diminish this is what the\nyogic perspective\nsays see a troll needs you to survive\nthey can't they don't have literally\nwhat is what is the definition of a\ntroll a troll is someone who engages\nwith other people in bad\nfaith you can't be like on a desert\nisland trolling anything you literally\ncan't right a troll the definition of a\ntroll requires an objective engagement\nand your mind is the same\nway\nokay let's move on\nokay\num okay this looks like a meme what\nother symptoms of trauma do you have\nwhich one is the most difficult to deal\nwith okay awful time travel can I sit\nagainst the wall triggered by random\nstuff you scared me I don't know why I'm\ncrying again please no yell get\noverwhelmed goodbye no sleep did I make\neverything up yeah so this is the thing\nwhere like literally this is why we made\nthe guide so we go through each of these\nthings in detail with like at least one\nlecture right so why do we have piles of\nemotion that dis that prop up at random\ntimes how does suppressed emotions work\nwe already talked about hemispheric\nlateralization did I make everything up\nwhat are the ways that your mind\ninterprets information why do you have\nto sit against a wall to feel safe we\ntalk about all of this kind of stuff so\nwe're not going to go into too much\ndetail because this would this would\ntake you hours\nokay does it mean I have PTSD if I\nresonate with all of the above okay\nflight workaholic overthinker anxiety\nPanic OCD difficulty sitting still\nperfectionist anger outbursts\ncontrolling the bully narcissistic\nexplosive behavior freeze difficulty\nmaking decisions stuck dissociation\nisolating numb Fawn people please their\nlack of identity No Boundaries\noverwhelmed codependent\nif you have these kinds of things does\nit mean you have PTSD\nno so let's understand something\nokay there are the ways in which trauma\nshapes\nyou and there are the there's PTSD those\nare two different\nthings so when we look at people and we\nsay 60% of people had have adverse\nchildhood experiences and have been\nshaped by trauma in some way that\ndoesn't mean everyone has PTSD PTSD is a\nvery specific clinical\ndisorder post-traumatic stress disorder\nis characterized by a certain set of\nsymptoms that are\nimpairing the reason that Psychotherapy\nis so helpful for all of these different\nproblems is because we understand in the\nfield of psychotherapy there is an\nassumption of a traumatic approach this\nis why we talk about your past what do\nwe do in Psychotherapy we understand\nthat your past events events in your\npast will shape your present Outlook and\nwill also determine your future\nbut in order to change that we need to\nchange our present\nOutlook when it comes to the trauma\nguide we address a lot of these\ndifferent things once again in a lot of\ndetail so I'll give you all just a\ncouple of examples okay but literally\nlike we made a whole guide about this\nand so then it becomes hard to like you\nknow to do it justice we need to go\nthrough the\nguide so the first thing is like let's\ntalk about Fawn people please their lack\nof identity hold on a second let me see\nif I can figure this out I'm going to\nask can I get a\nlink I wonder do I have access to the\nguide I'm going to see something real\nquick because I want to just show\ny'all one\nsecond I wonder if\nokay cool I have access wait do\nI uh oh it's not released yet\nGG let me see if there's some way I can\nask the\nteam um give me a second chat because I\nthink this is where if I can just show\nyouall the individual videos it'll be\nway easier um\ncan I get access to the trauma\nmap let's see if they can if we can\nfigure this\nout bear with us chat because I think\nthis is where like if I can just show\nyouall the actual like videos that we\nhave lined\nup\num then it will I will show youall how\nwe actually have videos about each of\nthese\nthings so we're working on it all right\nand while we're working on\nit um let's take a quick question while\nwe're\nwaiting pay Wald for\nme yeah so I was thinking about using\nthe announc vid it's a great\nidea um I just wanted\nto you\nknow all right we're working on it\nthankfully we've got an awesome team\nhere at HG we've got like devs and\nproduct managers and people who are like\nsuper great at it which is why you know\nI just like write the stuff and I film\nthe stuff but they're the ones that\nbuild it okay we'll we we'll come back\nto that\nokay okay so let's take a look at\nsomething else while we're waiting okay\nhere we go nope we got it we got it\nchat look at that dude so\nresponsive\npogchamps www.po champs.com\nokay let me just find this I always make\nthis\nmistake okay\nhere we\ngo okay so this is what we're going to\ndo we're going to take a quick look at\nthis\nokay so remember guys in the trauma\nguide we've got like over 30 videos with\nvarious\num like meditations and exercises and\nstuff like that so let's start with\nthis so flight fight Freeze Fawn so\nlet's start with with the a fawn so\nliterally what we're going to do is\nwe're going to go over\nhere see once we develop an identity and\nwe develop narrative and this is kind of\nhow to fix these\nthings then we end up with relationships\nattachment Theory and sex and attachment\nso in these videos we cover the way that\nyou um relate to other people and like\ny'all if yall notice here it says lack\nof identity is a core feature of this\nabsolute\nthat's why we cover identity first so I\ndon't know if this kind of makes sense\nbut the whole point of the trauma guide\nis that see this is the problem is when\nyou're facing all of these issues you\ndon't know where to\nstart but the whole the really cool\nthing about trauma is that there is a\nsequential way to deal with this see we\nstart the guide with physiologic\nrewiring and once you physiologically\nrewire things like you know\num anger\noutburst and overthinker and difficulty\nso difficulty sitting still an anger\nOutburst or partially related to your\nphysiology if we sort of think about it\nonce I have an anger Outburst I become a\nbully once I become a bully I become\nnarcissistic and so what we kind of see\nis anger outburst and identity relate\nand that's what we've really tried to do\nso here's how we understand anger\nOutburst hypervigilance this is when you\nget scared\nright you isolate you have to retreat\nyou have Panic we can rewire all that\nstuff we can understand your emotions\nonce we understand your emotions then we\nwe'll get better at things like\nperfectionism and work being a\nworkaholic so you may say hold on a\nsecond Dr K I thought emotions had to do\nwith anger Outburst no no no no no no no\nthis is\nphysiology let's understand workaholic\nand perfectionist what do these have to\ndo with emotions\nif you don't achieve\nPerfection how do you\nfeel not good enough ashamed\nguilty see these are\nemotions perfectionism is a strategy to\nprotect yourself from negative\nemotions which negative emotions being\nunloved why do you want to be\nperfectionistic in your relationship\nbecause then they'll stay\nbecause then they'll love me and so if\nwe go back to this perfectionism leads\nto\ncodependency perfectionism leads to No\nBoundaries so this is the crazy thing\nthis is literally why we structured it\nthis way as I understood I looked at\neach one of these different things\nacross across 400 research articles in\naddition to years of clinical\nexperience I saw my first patient in\n2014 when I was a first year medical\nstudent actually a couple years before\nwhen I was a researcher but let's say 10\nyears and what I found is that the\nchallenge with dealing all this is this\nis overwhelming where do you start the\nbeautiful thing is that some of these\nthings are dependent on other things\nthey're like a stack of books and if you\ntake out the bottom the stuff at the top\nwill actually fall\nover so all of these things feed into\neach other and the more that you\nunderstand that the more you can take a\nholistic or I would call it\nmulti-disciplinary approach rewire your\nphysiology increase your emotional\nawareness oh my goodness paralysis of\ninitiation holy there's a whole\nvideo\nabout difficulty making decisions being\nstuck literally paralysis of initiation\nwe've talked about this on\nstream right\nimpulsivity identity relationships\nright and then we get to the cool\nspiritual stuff down here like\nKarma so these are pra responses doesn't\nmean that you have PTSD and then of\ncourse we will talk about\nPTSD so what does it mean to have PTSD\nhow do we separate out this all of this\nstuff is not\nPTSD this is just the way that events\nyou adapt to situations and the way that\nevents shape you that's what this is\nthere may be PTSD there or may\nnot\nokay all\nright so let's talk about this for a\nsecond this is going to piss off a lot\nof people but I have to say it I am so\nover the cult of trauma The Cult of\ntrauma is other mental health\nprofessionals and mental health\nenthusiasts on social media who assign\neverything to a trauma response the\nAllure in labeling everything as a\ntrauma response is that you don't\nactually have to think was it something\nelse is it possible that it actually\njust has to do with your temperament is\nit possible that it has to do with\nBiology or a chemical imbalance is it\nsomething that has to do with the fact\nthat hey man life is hard relationships\nare unfair and people can be cruel that\ndoes not mean that every time you\nencounter hardship you are traumatized\nand I think that as more and more people\nuse the word trauma it's going to be\nmore important to distinguish if we're\nusing it in a colloquial casual way or\nif we're using it in a way away with\nclinical significance I'm genuinely\ncurious to get all of your opinions on\nwhether or not this is a good or bad\nthing that the word has become so\nubiquitous I'm muted let's talk about\nthis for a second so I I completely\nagree with this person's like I I feel\nthis person's frustration that trauma is\na word that gets thrown around all the\ntime and I think one of the really\nunfortunate things that we see you know\nwe talked a little bit about how people\nfeel guilty that they're using their\ntrauma for attention the other thing\nthat I think we need to acknowledge is\nthat people are using trauma to get\nattention so this is an unfortunate\ntruth of\nhumanity so if you look not just\nHumanity just\nlife see anytime\nthat there is a particular signal that\nwe can send as human beings that gets a\nparticular response right stimulus\nresponse people will discover that this\ngoes on and then they will artificially\nproduce the signal in order to Garner\nthe\nresponse so people will essentially take\nadvantage by becoming chameleons\nbecoming\nmimics and then we'll essentially like\nget the benefits of a particular thing\nwithout actually having the thing so we\nknow this very well in medicine because\nthere's a whole set of disorders\nfactitious disorder mingering what we\ncall Munch Housen disease or Munch\nHousen bioxy which is super popular on\nall the medical TV shows basically\nanytime you have another really good\nexample of this is like veterans so we\nhave a lot of people who will care a lot\nabout veterans because these are\nveterans they fought in a war they died\nfor us sometimes they lost limbs they\nhave all kinds of trauma go going on and\nthey've made a sacrifice therefore they\nget special\ntreatment so I think that there's some\ngroup of people who have this series\ncalled stolen honor or or like Stolen\nValor or something like that where they\nactually track down people who pretend\nto be Veterans for the benefit of being\na veteran they're not real veterans but\nthey pretend that because you get some\nadvantages and this is what we're\nabsolutely seeing with trauma so on the\none hand if you've actually been\ntraumatized you may feel very guilty for\ngetting attention from it and on the\nflip side whether consciously or\nsubconsciously a lot of people will\nattribute trauma to all kinds of stuff\neither for attention to get certain\npsychological needs met because\nunfortunately that is true that does\nhappen or what they'll do is use trauma\nas an excuse this is something that I'm\nseeing more happen more and more and\nmore where someone says oh yeah I've\nbeen traumatized that's why I do this\nand I I completely agree with this\nperson that you know this absolves\npeople of responsib ability right like\nyou just say like oh yeah sorry I've\nbeen\ntraumatized Get Wrecked that's the\nattitude that a lot of people will have\nsee the moment that we start making\naccommodations for someone and there's\nliterature on this okay so if you look\nat this set of diseases like factitious\ndisorder and mingering and Munch Housen\ndisease things like um pseudo seizures\nand conversion disorder what we know\nfrom the science of all of these\ndisorders there's some kind of benefit\nand when people act in a particular way\nthey reap that benefit we call this\nmaterial or immaterial gain or primary\ngain or secondary gain gain is the\nclinical term so sometimes we do it for\nmaterial benefits I want a veteran's\ndiscount of 50% off for my hotel room or\nsometimes we do it for immaterial\nbenefits psychological\nbenefits I need to feel cared for so I'm\ngoing to pretend to be a veteran so that\nI can get sympathy from other people\nbecause I don't like the way that I feel\nabout\nmyself and so we see this a\nlot and I I I think though that where I\nwould disagree a little bit and this I\ndon't even blame the person for because\nthis is something to understand so\nanytime we have short formed content and\nyou have a mental health professional\nwho makes any kind of statement in 60\nseconds that statement is going to be\nflawed by definition because there's no\nroom for\nnuance right so when I look at this\nperson I say this is what I disagree\nwith about this person but in 60 seconds\nhow much Nuance can they\nadd so I think this is what's also going\non when you have a lot of mental health\nclinicians who are saying this is trauma\nthis is trauma this is trauma this is\ntrauma that's because we're just taking\none particular slice of it right it's\nnot a 16-hour lecture on trauma with all\nof the nuance and case in point there\nare a couple of statements that this\nperson makes that I think or technically\nI wouldn't entirely agree with so they\nsay things like is it temperament well\ntemperament is influenced by\ntrauma right is it a neurochemical\nimbalance neurochemical imbalances are\ninfluenced by trauma those things are\nnot mutually\nexclusive case in point you can look at\nsome of things like Mark horowitz's\nresearch and some of these theories on\ntrauma being the source of depression\nand that there are Upstream effects of\nexperiences that will shape our\nepigenetics shape things like our\nserotonin\nTransporters so we know that there's\nsome alals like the short uh serotonin\ntransporter gene that are associated\nwith depression but we also know that\nyou can have a particular alil and then\nit is a certain environmental experience\nthat triggers that Al in a particular\nway so generally speaking I think the\nbest theory of how mental illness\nevolves is a genetic\npredisposition plus an\nexperience plus an environmental\nvulnerability and when the or a genetic\nvulnerability plus an environmental\ncircumstance when these two things\ninteract that's when we get a particular\nmanifestation of\ndisease but even if I take issue with\nsome of those small tiny little things\nwhich I I think you I don't even\ncriticize them for because in 60 seconds\nyou know you got to say something and\nyou can't be\nnuanced I think do to spot on that we\nwill often times jump to one\nanswer as the cause for all of our\nproblems and sometimes in doing so we\nshoot ourselves in the\nfoot and this is why it's really\nimportant to see a good clinician\ndifferential diagnosis is critical to\nhelp us tease apart what this is we\ndon't want to jump to\nconclusions okay does that make sense to\nyall oh my God so many comments\nchat trauma versus drama well\nsaid um\nthere's there's a great\nquestion how do you spot a\nchameleon\nso when I was in\nresidency there were a group of\nresidents\nwho enjoyed working with me because I\nwas good at spotting a liar\nso if you want to understand how to spot\na chameleon or a liar what you really\nlook for is not what they\nsay not the way they look what you look\nfor is\nchange this is how you spot a\nchameleon see if I see a chameleon out\nin the\nwilderness and they're a particular\ncolor let's say they're green do I know\nit's a chameleon or is it a lizard I\ndon't know let's say I see another\nlizard that is brown is it a chameleon\nor is it a lizard I don't know\nno the way to spot a chameleon is not\nthe way they look but the fluctuating\nway in which they\nlook so when I was a fourth year medical\nstudent I was working with a brilliant\npsychiatrist I still remember this one\nof the the moments that made me fall in\nlove with Psychiatry we were in the\ninpatient unit and this attending just\nabsolute Chad tells me you see\nthis guy walking down the street I mean\nwalking down the hallway\nhe's going to turn around in a second\nand the moment he notices us I want you\nto watch his\nsmile this is the sociopath smile and\nremember this smile have it burned into\nyour memory because this is the smile\nthat if you see in anyone else you will\nknow what a sociopath looks\nlike and so this person is walking down\nthe hallway and you can kind of tell\nthey're like not very happy they seem a\nlittle bit frustrated you can tell with\nthe walk\nright they turn I still remember this\nthey turned right to the nurses station\nwhere there's a window and they're\ntalking with the nurse their tone is\nclipped I can see a hand\nmotion I can feel the sharpness of their\nwords and then when they turn right to\nthe nurses station I'm behind them right\nso at the beginning I see their back I\nsee the way they're walking they turn\nright to the nurses station so now I'm\nin their peripheral View and the moment\nthat they notice that I'm walking\ntowards them with my boss they turn to\nme\nhey instant change transformative see\nwith normal\npeople our emotions\nlag so if you're\nangry and you walk into a store the\nanger does not disappear but with a\nsociopath there's no real anger there's\nonly the appearance of anger so the\nshift is\nsudden this is the whole problem in life\nis that when I am breaking up with my\npartner I cannot dispel all those\nemotions when I go into work the whole\nproblem in life is that once I've been\ndumped by my partner I can't dispel\nthose emotions when I go on a date the\nwhole problem is that these emotions\nlinger with us and if there is a\nlingering of emotion what that means is\nthat there is a\nconsistency of behavior there's a\nconsistency of real\nreaction but with a sociopath there's no\nconsistency it's green over here it's\nbrown over here it's red over here the\nchange is\nsudden so the way to detect a\nsociopath the way to detect a chameleon\nis the rapidity with which they\nchange make sense\nhow much of it is a sense of escapism on\nthe side of a patient assuming we're\ntalking about this and this this\nquestion is not old\nzero in the case of a sociopath there's\nno\nescapism there is just adapting to the\ncurrent\nsituation but if we're talking about the\nthe previous thing I I don't know how\nmuch chat is delayed someone is saying\nis it possible that people don't realize\nthey're faking let's assume that that\nthis is talking about trauma maybe this\nis wrong I'm guessing that I'm I'm\nlagged or\nsomething so the vast majority of people\nwho do things for attention most of\nFaking stuff is actually\nsubconscious most of\nit so very little of it is a conscious\nwhich is what makes things so\nfrustrating when you call people out on\nit right because the the denial that you\nget from them is genuine they're just as\nconfused as you are and that's why they\nfeel so hurt\nright so I I once had a\npatient I had a I was called for a\nconsult on the surgery floor because a\npatient was having pseudo seizures so\nthese are fake seizures okay what we\ncall non-epileptiform seizures\npsychogenic seizures they're going like\nah I'm seizing oh my\nGod the surgeons were pissed\noff CU they go in try to like clean this\nperson's wound dressing and stuff like\nthat and like the person starts this\nfake seizure and so they're getting\nfrustrated so they call us right\npsychiatrists like can you fix this this\nis getting annoying I just want to\nchange my wound dressing and move on\nwith my\nrounds and so what would happen is the\nthe the surgeons know what a real\nseizure looks like right so we know like\nall doctors are trained and what real\nepilepsy epileptiform seizures look like\nand they know they're faking the surgeon\nis like this is a fake seizure like you\nneed to stop this like I need to change\nyour wound dressing and what happens\nwhen the surgeon says this the person\nsees his harder no I'm not fing\nit right so here's what we need to\nunderstand I guess this is becoming a\ntalk about M stuff by the way I I love\nworking with these patients and part of\nwhat I love about being a psychiatrist\nthere's this awesome in Massachusetts\nGeneral\nHospital there's the there's a\npsychiatric consultation service and\nthese are some of the the best\nclinicians most brilliant clinicians\nI've ever worked with like just an\nabsolute privilege to train there and\njust the way just such awesome awesome\nawesome\ndoctors and so like this is exactly what\nhappens right so what what happens is\nwhen you don't fulfill the psychological\nneeds of someone who is doing something\nfor attention what you will find is as\nyou don't fulfill the psychological\nneeds you actually exacerbate the\nbehavior and this is why it's so\nfrustrating to deal with people who do\ncrap for attention\nso if there's someone who's posting fake\nmedical stuff about themselves on the\ninternet and you call them out on it are\nthey admonished no they\nescalate so what is the best\nevidence-based treatment for some of\nthese\nconditions regular appointments with\nmedical or mental health professionals\nthat are\nindependent of their\nsymptoms this is the answer\nI'm not going to change the love that I\ngive you whether you act this way or you\ndon't act this\nway the so if you have someone in your\nlife who is doing things for attention\nthe worst thing that you can do is\nrespond to the attention and this is\nwhat ends up happening right so when\npeople do crap for attention it drives\nus crazy because half the time they do\nit for attention on on a day like today\nI'm going to be empathic I'm going to be\nnice I'm going to be kind so you're like\nokay like today I've got the B like tell\nme everything oh my God I'm so it's so\nhard that you're hurting like I'm here\nfor you like hug me I will protect you I\nlove\nyou and then the other times you get fed\nup with it and you're like I don't have\ntime for this man you need to go\nsee a\ntherapist and then we get\nconfused because we try both I tried\nbeing nice I tried being frustrated and\nneither one seems to work and we're here\ntearing out our hair cuz we're like I\ndon't know how to fix this I've tried\neverything nothing is\nworking that's the problem is you've\ntried everything you should stop trying\neverything try one thing and only one\nthing and don't change it no matter\nwhat literally the evidence-based\nrecommendations for people who have\nproblems like this is regular\nappointments no matter what whether\nthings are going well or things are\ngoing poorly I'm going to interact with\nyou in the same way I'm going to be\npositive I'm going to be supportive I'm\ngoing to be\nstable oh things are going well next\nweek so the patient says yeah I don't\nknow if I need to come in next week I\nsay I don't know I mean I know things\nare going well next week but I think\nit's really important that we keep on\nthis trajectory I think not coming in\nnext week could be a huge step\nback I think we should stick with our\nappointment next\nweek\nokay they have have to learn that their\nbehavior does not affect your\nbehavior see if you were a victim to\nmanipulation there's one very easy way\nto bypass all manipulation actually\nthat's probably not true it's\nridiculous but there's a good option for\nbypassing a chunk of manipulation let's\ncall it\n51% which is to not change the way that\nyou respond no matter what\nsee the whole point of manipulation is\nthat my behavior Can evoke your behavior\nso how can someone bypass that they\nsimply have a stability of behavior\nthat's\nit all you have to do is the same thing\nevery single\ntime and this is what's kind of sad\nbecause I see this a lot on the internet\nwhere everyone's talking about boundary\nsetting which you can be very healthy\nright and they're like this parent or\nwhatever we got to set really tough\nboundaries with them and them but\neven then that's you're giving in to the\nwhole thing because then they feel\nguilty and you feel guilty and all this\nkind of crap you just be stable with\nsomeone that's the best the best\nantidote to manipulation is\nstability even doing something mean to\nthem is playing into their hands and you\nknow this if you know what I'm talking\nabout being an to someone who\nmanipulates you doesn't help it actually\nplays into their hands being a victim of\ntheir manipulation doesn't help it plays\ninto their hands so what you want to be\nis\nneutral you want to be a cliff against\nthe\nocean low tide I don't give a high\ntide I don't give a storm I don't\ngive a but you're always there see\nnotice we don't retreat the cliff\ndoesn't run away from the ocean that's a\nresponse neutral response neutral\nneutral neutral neutral\nneutral because how does someone learn\nto manipulate this too can be\nrelated how do they learn to manipulate\nlet's understand\nthis\nsee people manipulate because they don't\nhave a better way to get what they\nneed simple it's they're not bad people\nit's just they grow up in an environment\nso by the way if we look at things like\npseudo seizures very high correlation\nwith traumatic upbringing\nso why let's understand\nthis see when you are not taught a\nhealthy way of getting your needs met\nyou learn by definition an unhealthy way\nof getting your needs\nmet see a lot of\nparents who believe in being very strict\nparents think that I'm instilling\ndiscipline in my child if my child plays\nafter 1000 p.m. no more video games if\nmy my child gets a single be no friends\nI'm going to discipline my child I'm\ngoing to make him the best child in the\nworld and I'm teaching them and my child\nis good and I'm going to make sure that\nthey're\ngood you're not teaching them\ndiscipline you're teaching them\nobfuscation you're teaching them hiding\nyou're teaching them how to do things\nbehind your\nback absolutely\nit becomes an arms race they try to\ntrick you you catch them they try a\nlittle bit harder you catch them and at\nsome point they're going to outpace\nyou because their brains are plastic\ntheir brains are growing and you have an\nadvantage cuz you're an adult and\nthey're a child but over time playing\nfield is going to be\nlevel and you started this game at the\nage of 30 when you had a child they've\nbeen doing it their whole lives\nso the child always\nwins real\ntragedy anytime there's a relationship\nbetween a child and a a parent where the\nchild wins or the parent wins when one\nperson loses if one person wins one\nperson loses in a parent child\nrelationship when one person wins and\none person loses everybody loses you're\non the same\nteam so let's move\non how do you do it properly where the\nchild learns not to\nhide so I'm going to ask youall\nokay so enough answers from Dr K I've\nspoken\nenough here you all are wanting answers\nand answers answers answers asking\nquestions all the time I'm doing all the\nwork you're not doing any of the work\nyou tell\nme how does a child learn not to\nhide do you all know the\nanswer let's\nsee wow look at this beautiful beautiful\nbeautiful beautiful beautiful see the\nchild the only time you need to hide is\nwhen you're afraid of the\nconsequences right that's why we hide\nwhy do we\nlie we lie to manipulate someone else's\nBehavior lying is a way of controlling\nanother human being so let's say I'm\nhaving an affair I'm\nnot or if I am it's news to\nme why do we lie when we have affairs we\nlie because we're trying to control\nsomeone else's\nBehavior presumably our partner's\nBehavior okay that's literally right so\nif we tell them the truth we can't\ncontrol what they do but as long as they\nare ignorant we can rely on what they do\nwe can control their\nbehavior so if you want your child to be\nhonest with you you have to stop\npunishing them for honesty very\nsimple very hard but very simple\nand this is very difficult for a lot of\nparents very very difficult for a lot of\nparents and chances are in a sense it's\nalmost too late because if you have a\nchild that comes to you as a teenager\nand tells you hey Mom or Dad I'm smoking\npot right that almost never happens\nbecause there's such a thin thin tight\nrope to walk between condoning a\nbehavior and punishing a\nbehavior and the problem is that the\nmajority of parents who know that their\nchildren their teenage kids use drugs\nbasically condone\nit this is my clinical observation I'm\nnot saying you out there or whatever\nright because that's what happens is\nlike you know you'll have parents who\nlike kind of know that their kids drink\nand sometimes they're the cool\nparents and so it's very difficult as a\nparent to not condone a behavior and not\npunish a behavior very difficult\nand so as a parent when your child does\nsomething wrong it's very hard to not\ncondone it right like so like you're\nlike I have to punish it so I I'm\ntelling them that I'm not condoning it\nso here's what I would recommend right\nand this is Theory\ncrafting okay because my kids are six\nand eight I I don't know I don't know\nwhat to do about\nthis Theory crafting on my part youall\nmay know\nbetter so what I would do is explain to\nchildren that there are consequences\nright explain to Children why you\nbelieve what you believe and why you're\ndoing the things that you're doing but\nthe other really important thing is to\nlisten to\nthem listen to them it doesn't mean that\nyou can't set limits but at least hear\nthem\nout right and do your best to explain\nyour point of view so you can say hey I\ncan't let you continue using marijuana\nfor these reasons at the same time I\nhave no intention of like punishing you\noutside of this like this is the goal\nthat I'm moving towards and I recognize\nthat marijuana does something for you so\nI really need to understand that so as a\nparent what you really want to do is any\nkind of negative behavior that they're\nengaging in you need to understand what\nis driving the\nbehavior and once you understand what is\ndriving the behavior you as a parent\ncannot take away their solution you have\nto replace\nit and this is true of the not even\nparents so like so let's say you've got\na partner who plays too many video games\nwe see this all the time it's so sad\nI see this a lot actually like with\nfinance and like Crypt Bros and like\nCrypt Bros who just ruin their\nrelationships because they're spending\nall their money on\ncrypto and they end up getting divorced\nand stuff because we don't know how to\ntalk to people in these situations right\nwe have to understand why are you buying\nthe crypto in the first\nplace what's the driver there it's that\nI want to be\nsomeone I don't want to work this\n minimum wage job and like sweat\nto make ends meet like I know people are\nout there having good lives and I want\nthis good life that's why people lose\nmoney in\ncrypto it's because they want something\nthat other people get in\nlife they see that other people out\nthere have good lives but I don't have\nthis opportunity and that's\nunfair and all I want is to be able to\nlive life like other people and the\nbeautiful thing about crypto is it's the\nWild Wild West and I can get it Diamond\nhand\nno cell Apes together\nstrong they just want to participate in\nthe life that everyone else gets they\nwant to participate in the life they\nwant to be able to provide for their\nromantic Partners the way that other\npeople\ndo that's all they\nwant and so you can punish them for it\nfine but even if you're in this\nsituation right you have to address that\nunderlying need\nsee we focus so much on\nBehavior what we should be focusing on\nis the drivers of\nbehavior see if someone steals bread you\ncan lock the cabinet you can put bars on\nthe door you can do all kinds of\nthings the best way to get someone from\nstealing your bread is to give them\nsomething to\neat do you all steal bread no because\nyou have it\nyou are\ncontent and so this is a big thing that\na lot of parents miss out on right it's\nsad my parents missed out on\nit why did I get addicted to video games\nit's because I was not getting my needs\nmet in life I don't blame them for it\nthat's their karma this is my karma too\nI'm grateful for everything that has\nhappened in my life including the\npainful things it's made me the person\nthat I am\ntoday right so if you have someone in\nyour life or even let's forget about\nother people for a second and talk about\nyou so we go on trying to create this\nlife for ourselves we go on trying to\nchange I want to be different I want to\ntransform so you want to become someone\nelse what's driving\nthat see one of the biggest mistakes\nthat we make in life is we believe that\ntransforming into a different human\nbeing will bring us\ncontentment but this doesn't work let's\nunderstand\nwhy why do I believe that transforming\ninto a different human being will make\nme content let's think about it right\nbecause I'm not that human being so I\nhave no direct experience of it I look\non the outside and I see something that\nI am not that I have no experience of so\nall I can do is rely on this my senses\nmy eyes to show\nme oh this person looks contentment and\ncontent and they are this way therefore\nI should turn into that and I will find\ncontentment monkey see monkey\ndo now the problem is that the moment\nthat I become that thing what was the\nsource of my compass my the source of my\ncompass is what I see in someone else\nand when I become that thing I may not\nbe content and so then what do I do I\nlook again and I see someone else doing\nsomething else oh this person did this\nnow they're content I did this now\nthat's not enough now I need to do this\nnow I need to do this now I need to do\nthis so if you look at people who are\naddicted to\nsuccess addicted to\nImprovement why because there's\nfundamental\ndiscontent and these people can be very\nsuccessful why because they're trying to\nsolve this I'm going to do this I'm\ngoing to do this now I need to make a\nmillion dollars now I need to get in\nshape now I need to have a yacht now I\nneed to do this now I need to get\npromoted now I need to have a social\nmedia following now I need to do this\nnow I need to do this this because\nthey're looking at other people and they\nthink if I become this I will find\ncontentment so here's a crazy crazy\ncrazy thing to\nunderstand literally not metaphorically\nliterally where does contentment\nexist you can't get any contentment\nThrough The Eyes you can't get any\ncontentment through the sensory\norgans you make me say but that's not\ntrue I can eat something and then I can\nbe content hold on a second where is the\nsource of that contentment you still\nfeel the contentment in here it is your\nexperience of things that brings you\ncontentment this is the big thing that a\nlot of people miss so when you go on\ntrying to transform yourself into\nsomething else to bring\ncontentment that idea of contentment\ncomes from your sensory organs it comes\nfrom Theory crafting it doesn't come\nfrom in here and then what happens is\nyou will be victim to the next thing\nthat you see that will make you content\nand then this gets doubly difficult not\ndoubly difficult 10 times more difficult\nbecause now you have an industry of\npeople who advertise their\ncontentment of which arguably I'm\nguilty right look at me like I say oh do\nthis thing you will be happy be like me\nyou will be happy stop playing League of\nLegends play do you will be happy you'll\nbe even more sad\nlet's be\nhonest right so now you're really\nscrewed because if you're relying on\nyour sensory organs to give you a\ncompass in life you have a whole\nindustry of people whose job it is to\ncreate a false idea of\nHappiness this is why we're seeing a\nrise in mental health\nproblems so where do we find the\nanswers in here\nhere now I will give you the genetic\nwisdom of the Ancients and since I am\ngiving you the genetic wi generic wisdom\nof the Ancients I must use the accent\nI've read in the ancient yogic texts of\nthe Himalayas that all answers come from\nwithin look within and you will find\neverything that you\nneed it's true\nright so I ask y'all no\nanswers\nquestions when you want something from\nhere and you get it how do you feel and\nwhen you want something that you've been\nconditioned to want when you want\nsomething that you should want or when\nyou should want something all these\nkinds of shoulds from the outside how\nmuch happiness does that\nbring I should do this I should do this\nI should do\nthis see I'm recently I made a mistake I\nstarted playing Dota 2 again and I've\nbeen spamming this hero called Hoodwink\nand this brings me so much\njoy no one told me to play Hoodwink I\ndidn't look at someone else and be like\noh my God that person is Hoodwink if I\nwant to I just started playing a hero\nand I fell in love with\nit this is where Joy comes\nfrom Right comes from in here\nand this is the big problem in life is\nthat like we go on spending so little\ntime with ourselves we spend so much\ntime looking to the outside for what\nwill work for us but here's the simple\nthing that I think is a real tragedy is\nno two human beings are the\nsame and so their answers won't work for\nyou I'm\nsorry see if one human being's anwers\nworked for another human being we'\n figured everything out by now\nso look\nwithin that is it all the answers\nlie and I've seen it I saw a sad post\ntoday on the medical school subreddit\nabout someone who wanted to be become a\npsychiatrist and their family is like oh\nmy God you're going to be a crazy\ndoctor my family did the same\nthing so see when we look to other\npeople for our happiness\nthis is the real tragedy because when\nsomeone says do this and you'll be happy\nwe're the ones who actually have to live\nwith the consequences of our decision\nthe person who tells us what will make\nus happy myself\nincluded okay if I tell you this will\nmake you\nhappy I'm going to finish stream I'm\ngoing to go eat whatever I want to for\nlunch I'm going to go do whatever it's a\nFriday I have to do some work and stuff\nbut anyway I'm not gonna have too much\nfun today but let's say tomorrow morning\nI'm gonna have wake up I'm gonna have a\ncoffee and I'm gonna enjoy my day I\ndon't have to live with the consequences\nof the advice that I give\nyou this is the real\ntragedy your family doesn't have to live\nwith the advice that they give you you\nhave to live with the advice that they\ngive you the influence on the internet\ndoesn't have to live with the advice\nthat they give you you have to live with\nit that's why you should make the\ndecision and you should base it on in\nhere does that make\nsense this is why it's really sad it's\nreally hard to live life because no one\nelse has to live with the consequences\nof your actions except you and the\npeople stupid enough to continue\nengaging with\nyou it's not technically true right\nbecause I'm not the only one who has to\nlive with the consequences of my shitty\nHoodwink play my four teammates and my\nfive\nopponents right\nokay I don't even know what we were\ntalking about but look I got to say this\nit's a privilege to be here\ntoday um it's an absolute privilege\nlike so I can't tell you how grateful I\nam I mean hopefully you can see it in my\nface I'm trying I'm trying to tell you\ntoday I came to\nwork and my job today was to tell y'all\nthat I have labored and sweated to build\nthis thing that I hope will help\nyou and if I get to do it this way this\nis a\nwin this is the best way to do it I'm\nhaving the time of my life sure we built\nthis trauma guide sure hopefully it'll\nhelp you if you're lucky it'll change\nyour life quite a bit I really have put\na lot of love and effort into it because\nI care about y'all I really do care\nabout y'all and the reason that it's\neasy to care about youall is because you\nmake caring about you\neasy look at how nice you all are look\nat how much fun we're having I can't do\nthat without you so I'm grateful because\nI've worked with a lot of people I've\nworked overnight in emergency rooms with\npeople who have not been Pleasant with\nme when I try to help them high on\ncocaine and you know not so much cocaine\nhonestly it's been K2 that's the number\none thing that I I struggle with in\nterms of people abusing me when\nI'm trying to help them k2's at the top\nof the\nlist y'all make it\neasy so I'm grateful for that because\nI've certainly been in situations where\nit has not been\neasy okay let's do one more and then we\ngot to call it\nchat um okay this is a good\n[Music]\none oh these are these are both good\nokay is it abnormal to not be affected\nby childhood trauma I'm 32 I had\ndifferent traumas in my childhood like\nmolestation in school sexual abuse by my\ntwo uncles and beating by belt by my\nfather now I'm successful in my career\nhave a master's degree and lovely\nmarried for six years everything is fine\nwith my life at least as I know but some\nof my friends around me have suffered\ntheir whole lives from childhood trauma\nand that's somehow weird for me because\nit seems I was able to push P mine\neffortlessly when I see my friends in\nsome videos of Dr K I think to myself\nthat I I may maybe I have a problem that\nI don't know of or there is a mechanism\nin me that somehow fixes or heals that\nstuff easily my question is is it\nabnormal to not be affected by childhood\ntrauma beautiful question and the answer\nis\nyes so let us understand\nthis so we have a lecture on\npost-traumatic\ngrowth we also have a YouTube video\nabout\nit that is one of our more poorly\nperforming YouTube videos because people\ndon't seem to be too interested in it so\nso be it that's why we stuck it in the\nguide with a lot of other interesting\nstuff because we think it's really\nimportant to understand\nthis\nso if you look at studies on\ngenocide what you find is that genocide\nis the systematic attempt of\nExterminating a population of people and\nyou have people who survive genocidal\nconflicts right this isn't like one\nperson this is like there's a tribe of a\n100,000 people and like 60,000 people or\n50,000 people make it\nout now all 100,000 of these people have\nbasically gone through a comparable\nexperience and what we find is that not\nall 50,000 of those people end up with\nPTSD not everyone who goes to war comes\nback with\nPTSD so this is very important to\nunderstand it is actually quite\nnormal to have a traumatic upbringing\nand not be traumatized later in\nlife it's quite\nnormal right so remember that 60% of\npeople have some kind of adverse\nchildhood experience but not 60% of\npeople end up with a mood disorder or\nsomething something like that this is\nwhat's so cool about the human body and\nthe human mind is that it has a capacity\nto\nheal so there are two or three things to\nkeep in\nmind the first is what is the difference\nbetween someone who has something that\nwe call post-traumatic\ngrowth or post-traumatic stress disorder\nbecause there's also a pile of\nliterature on how adversity can make us\nstronger as human beings\nand so we literally in that video will\noutline the five evidence-based\nprinciples of post-traumatic growth so\nhow to take negative experiences and\ngrow from them and the reason we know\nthis is because we analyzed the let's\nsay the 10,000 people who ended up with\nPTSD and the 40,000 people who didn't we\nsaid what's the\ndifference so there are a couple of\nthings right so there's different things\nlike genetic vulnerabilities right so\nsome of it's just\nlike the way that your body is but then\nas we try to outline in the guide we\nlook at all of these factors that result\nin\ntrauma right so we look at all these\nfactors that will contribute at the way\nthat your physiology is wired the way\nthat your cognition is wired and you can\nintervene at any of those steps you can\nintervene at relationships you can\nintervene at identity you can intervene\nat physiology you can intervene at\nNeuroscience you can intervene at\nemotions you can intervene at motivation\nyou can intervene at thinking there's\nall kinds of intervene at impulsivity\nand the whole problem with trauma is\nthat one Cascades into\nanother and so\npractically one thing that I see in this\npost that I think is really\ngood so this may sound like a weird\nquestion\nbut why do y'all think this person\nposted this\ndoes this person have a\nproblem see most people who post things\nhave a\nproblem is it weird to y'all that this\nperson is posting without a\nproblem kind of weird\nright right so some people are saying\nguilt some people saying show off these\ncould absolutely be the\ncase\nright so this is what I'll tell you this\nI'm going to have a charitable\ninterpretation of\nthis see when you look to understand\nyour life when there is no problem\nthat's when your life becomes\ngood see if we\nrely on problems to prompt corrective\nBehavior Behavior what that means is\nthat the only time we will improve is\nwhen there's a problem which means that\nwe will only get to\nzero if our drive for improvement is to\nfix a problem that means that a problem\nis required for\nimprovement so one of the things that I\nthink and I'm I have no idea\nright because I've never met this person\nand who knows maybe they're just showing\noff I don't know I don't think so though\nI generally speaking I have faith in our\ncommunity that that doesn't happen quite\nas often youall have done a really good\njob people who show off go other\nplaces right so I think one of the key\nthings is a capacity for introspection a\ncapacity to ask yourself why am I the\nway I\nam this is a very different question\nfrom how do I change and this is the big\nirony of\nLife a lot of people will ask how do I\nchange how do I fix this how do I fix\nthis how do I fix this thankfully many\nof them do fix things but some of them\ndon't sometimes we fall into this\npattern of how do I fix this this\ndoesn't\nwork it is when we try to understand who\nwe are how we came to be this way it's\nnot that I need to fix a flat tire let\nme understand how the car is put\ntogether let me understand how to play\nthis game let me understand the nature\nof life let me understand how things are\nit is this attitude which is very\nprotective\nnow if you don't have this attitude not\nyour\nfault let's understand right because if\nyou're not\ncareful pay attention now pay attention\npay attention because Dr K said oh my\nGod so beautiful this person is trying\nto get better in understanding\nthemselves and then you think to\nyourself oh I don't do that I just\ntry to solve my problems how do I become\nsomeone who just introspects instead of\nsolving problems they did it\nagain how do I become like this person\nyou guys see that happens so fast oh\nthat's the way that I need to\nbe so quickly like\nlightning take a step back it's\nokay so if you are not like that you're\ndoing fine and I say that I say that I\nreally believe it right if I didn't\nbelieve it I wouldn't say it\nprobably so listen this is what we've\ngot to understand and this is where\nthere's a whole section on spirituality\nand Karma so we talk about kma and the\nguide so for all of you this is\neveryone we are all given a particular\nhand of cards we're all given these\nevents in our life we don't control\nthose events this is something called\nkarma we talked about this in\nmemberships recently we have another\nlecture coming up on\nit there's a lot of stuff that you don't\ncontrol\nsee even up until this moment the person\nthat you are you basically have no\ncontrol over you have no control now\nover what you did in the past you are a\nconsequence of all of life's experiences\nincluding the fact that you are focused\non fixing your\nproblems right and that's like not\nsomething you can blame yourself for you\nare where you are just be aware of\nit instead of trying to change just\nnotice where you\nare see the reason that we stumble so\nmuch in life is because we're always\nlooking at where we want to go instead\nof looking where we\nare so I had a friend who was\nCaucasian and married someone who was\nIndian from India and moved to\nIndia and one of the things that she\ntold me I was like what's the you know\nwhat's the adjustment like cuz it's\nquite an adjustment meant there was all\nkinds of problems cuz Marrying an Indian\nboy is not the best idea in the\nworld those of you who know\nno and so she said you know one of the\nbiggest lessons that I had to learn was\nto watch where I'm\nwalking see when you grow up in the\nUnited States you don't need to worry\nabout where you're stepping because\ngenerally speaking is\nintact sidewalks work there aren't huge\npotholes you don't have to worry about\nfalling through the floor you don't have\nto worry about stepping on a snake you\ndon't have to worry about about these\nthings you can watch you can look\nahead he said what I learned of by for\nliving in India in four years I have to\nwatch where I put my\nfeet this is absolutely true of your\nlife as well it's not about where you\nwant to go or whatever just look down\nlook where you're going not like out\nthere like look where you're stepping\nnow so you don't need to be like this\nperson if you're not like this person\nyou just need to look at where you're\nputting your feet today\nso practically what does this mean if\nyou want to solve your problem solve\nyour problems we literally made you a\nguide to help you do\nthat but also notice right what is it\nthat motivates me am I able to be\nmotivated outside of solving my\nproblems and what you will discover is\nsomething that's very\ntragic I've used tragedy a lot today but\nI guess it's top of mind tropy\nsee the reason that a lot of people can\nonly solve their problems is because\nthey don't have the luxury of anything\nelse you're so burnt out and rung out\nand ground dust that you cannot afford\nto do anything but fix your life it is\nsuch a luxury think for a second right\nit's such a luxury to\ninvest this is what solving problems\nthat you don't have looks like this is\nwhat self Improvement looks like\nself-improvement is a luxury for those\nwhose lives are not falling\napart right so I was talking to a couple\nof Finance Bros they're like yeah man\nlike this is the kind of thing where\nlike you know when I make money I invest\nit and some people just spend it it's\nlike yeah some people have debt so they\nhave to spend it they can't afford to\ninvest and the same is true in life so\nif if your life has a thousand different\nproblems don't beat yourself up for not\nbeing like this person that's this\nperson's G my you are where you are you\nlook down and you look where you put\nyour\nfeet and the emotional bandwidth that\nyou have when you are not surrounded by\nproblems is huge that allows you the\nluxury of\ninvesting very hard to invest when you\nhave a bunch of\ndebt so don't worry so much about other\npeople and whether they can solve things\nor not solve\nthings\nhey I need you sign here\nokay say Che your SL\nokay that's\nyour we've done this form like\ntimes thank you I will check my\nslack like like for now or in general in\ngeneral okay if you can Che\nyour okay okay I'm busy hanging out with\nmy\nhomies\num so you know and and and I think the\nlast thing that I'd kind of say about\nthis is that the other real challenge\nhere is that sometimes we feel so\noverwhelmed that we think that we don't\nhave any energy left that we don't have\nany anything left to\ninvest and um there's a couple of papers\nthat I showed on stream recently so\nwe'll kind of talk a little bit about\nthis the real tragedy here there's that\nword again so\nsometimes the perception that you can't\nwork on things except for problems is\nactually like false this is the real\nproblem so if we look at like people who\nare overwhelmed in life what we know is\nthat there's it's really interesting\nthere's like a kind of a psychological\nequation for being\noverwhelmed which is that when the\nactive challenges in life are outweighed\nby the passive challenges in life then\nyou feel overwhelmed so what is an\nactive challenge an active challenge is\none where you choose it and a passive\nchallenge is a challenge that is given\nto you RNG life gives it to you and what\nactually correlates with feeling\noverwhelmed is not the number of things\nthat you're doing but how many many\nthings do you choose to do and how many\nthings do you not choose to do and when\npeople are surrounded by problems in\nlife they feel overwhelmed and they\nbelieve it is because they are\nsurrounded by problems Mak sense\nright the real crazy thing and there's a\nreally fantastic specialist on anxiety\nwho taught me this principle up in\nBoston is that if you choose to take on\nmore it changes that\nratio literally the way that your brain\ncalculates overwhelmed is not the number\nof challenges but how many did you\nchoose and how many did you not\nchoose and so often times we think that\nthe\nsolution to being overwhelmed is to\nreduce the problems that we're dealing\nwith we need fewer things to deal with\nso that we can focus on one when the\nreal irony is to actually adopt more\nproblems pick one or two things that you\ncan focus on pick one or two things that\nyou want to accomplish I don't know how\nthis works but it's how it works that\nyour brain then says okay right now our\nactive challenges to passive challenges\nis a 2080 ratio if you choose to take on\nmore then it becomes 3070 that actually\nfeels better you actually start making\nprogress in life it's really\nbizarre right so if you think about like\nwhat is the goal like what what do we\nreally do in\nPsychiatry\nsometimes we will really try to reduce\nother people's problems but we can't do\nthat\ndo you all get that a therapist can't\nchange your\nlife they can't go out there and like\ntalk to your boss and make them be nicer\nto you they're not like your mom will go\nand yell at your teacher for giving you\nyou gave too much homework and my baby\nis the best baby in the whole world and\nhe's so precious and he's so\nsmart see when you have moms who do that\nthe kids don't do\nwell waving a magic wand to make your\nproblems go away help some I think it's\nstupid to say it doesn't help because it\ndoes help some and sometimes all people\nneed is just a break from some of the\n problems in their life it's my\nclinical experience too I realize it\nruns counter to my general point but\nit's\ntrue at the same\ntime sometimes what you need is to take\nmore responsibility right so even if I'm\nhelping a patient like who deals with\nwork problems what we try to do is focus\non something they can do here's how you\nset boundaries Let's help you take\ncontrol and even though setting\nboundaries is something they're not good\nat it's adding stuff to their plate\ntechnically it is an additional thing\nthat they have to learn how to do it\nhelps and if you really pay attention to\nwhat is done in therapy what you will\nfind is that whether therapists even\nrealize it or not I don't even know if\nmost therapists are familiar with this\nprinciple but I see it all the time is\nthere giving their patients more to do\nnot taking things\naway and that has a very interesting\nalmost neuroeconomic\neffect of making people feel more in\ncontrol right there's a great phrase of\nmoving deck chairs around on the Titanic\nso I don't know if this is true or not\nbut when the Titanic was sinking people\nwere like oh my God the boat is tilting\nand the deck chairs are getting all\ndisorganized let's all fix them and put\nthem back where they\nbelong the act of taking control gives\npeople a perception of control and\nsometimes this can be problematic right\nso I see this a lot especially with like\nAsian families and people who are sick\nin the hospital they can't do anything\nso what do they do it's not just Asian\nfamilies it happens to Greek families\nand probably like half families on the\non the planet what do they do they make\nfood and I see this in like funerals too\nforget about particular sets of\nfamilies you guys ever noticed that at\nfunerals everyone brings\nfood it's kind of weird right like I may\nhave Miss this part in med school but\nlast time I checked a casserole didn't\nbring someone back to life maybe it's\nnot the right\ncasserole why does everyone make\nfood it's to do something and then you\nwalk into the food and you say well that\nway people don't have to cook right\nbecause they just lost someone and they\ndon't feel like cooking first of all\ncooking is therapeutic for like half the\nplanet and secondly you go and there's\nan abundance of food they don't need\nthat much food we do it to feel like\nwe're doing something\nso if you feel overwhelmed by your life\nI wish that your life gets easier I\nreally\ndo but don't let that get in the way of\nyou stopping to\nprogress don't let life dictate to you\nwhat you should be\ndoing because when Life Starts dictating\nto you who's in control\nso taking control of your life is not\nabout solving life's problems it's about\npicking up your\nown right it's kind of like in Soviet\nRussia television watch\nyou which all need to do is start taking\non more not asking for less but I wish\nthat you get less I really do because\nI've also seen this where there's just\nso much economic\ndestruction and so much just romantic\n destruction like this old yall\nthis generation is bro you're\nlike getting so\n that's\nreal but now see even I do it so now\nit's so I can't do anything about that\nchat I can't solve your problems so what\nI'm giving you is some kind of thing\nthat what can I do I can't make women\nfall in love with you I can't make men\nstop sending you dick\npiics I can't fix those things so what\nam I doing I show up on stream and I\ntalk to I talk to a\nmonitor and then today when I go to bed\nat night I will say to myself good job\nDr K you did so\ngood you saved the world let's\ngo you're\nright think someone was like you should\nmake a guy to dating in relationships\nI'm like bro what the do I know\nabout dating in\nrelationships I've been in the same\n relationship for like a long\ntime like almost 20 years I don't know\nanything about dating I can't help you\nwith that so I'm going to ignore it and\nI'm going to focus on what I can help\nyou\nwith now here's the last thing that I'll\nend up\nwith it\nworks right so we started off this\nstream by watching a video of someone\nwho has been helped some\nright I think they did most of the work\nlet's be\nhonest here's the crazy thing it\nworks see when we have problems in life\nwe can't always fix\nthem and we think to ourselves that oh\nthe only way to improve my life is to\nfix these problems but if you kind of\ncan't do anything about that here's what\nyou can focus on be the change that you\nwant to see in the\nworld right you can take responsibility\nfor that which you can\ncontrol and things actually end up being\nquite solid when you do that I know it\nsounds\ninsane but in my experience both as a\nclinician and in my personal\nlife once people start focusing on what\nthey control what they discover is they\ncontrol way more than they realize and\nthis is exactly why their life is\ngetting screwed because they do not\nrealize how much control they\nhave it is in the ignorance of your\npower that your life becomes\ndirectionless how does one discover how\nmuch power you have you exercise\nit you will never know how strong you\nare until you try to lift\nweights and this is what's going on in\nlife is we're all getting bodied by the\nproblems that we have and then we don't\nrealize how powerful we are because\nwe're always playing\nreactionary if you're playing reaction\nyou'll never control your destiny right\nyour life is dictated by your\ncircumstances so the best defense is a\ngood\noffense all right y'all thank you so\nmuch for coming today I know we ran a\nlittle bit long thank you everyone\nseriously for coming today um definitely\ncheck out the trauma guide it is five\nbucks off as a pre-order until May 19th\ncomes out in about six\nweeks uh it is absolutely a labor of\nlove not only mine but a lot of people\nhere at HG were a pretty big org now um\nand like it's it's really it's really\nfantastic what people have put together\nit's not just me that put it together\ntoo and also thank youall very much for\ncoming today thank you guys very much\nthank all y'all for posting the\nquestions that y'all post asking the\nquestions that you ask responding the\nway that you do because y'all are my\nenergy right I think yall can see that\nthat this is something that we create\ntogether and even what went into the\nguide is not what I thought was a good\nidea what went into the guide is what I\nthought yall needed y'all told me what\nto put in I didn't decide like oh this\nis what's really good and that's what\nactually separates HG from a lot of\nother education out there like with the\nbig difference between you know the way\nthat I used to teach when I was like\nteaching in Academia\nin the way that I teach now is in\nAcademia someone comes to me and says we\nwant you to teach this some power that\nbe the powers that be will come and say\nwe want you to teach this and I say yes\nsir yes ma'am I will teach what you ask\nme to teach the difference is that y'all\nare telling us what you need and this\nguide is born of our\nlistening just as much as our\nexpertise okay so um definitely check it\nout if yall are interested like I said\nit's kind of a it's designed to help you\nunderstand the adaptations that become\nmaladaptations and to help you\nunderstand how to rewire\nyourself and um it's built with love so\ntake care of y'all we'll see y'all I\ndon't know when I think we're I'm sure\nwe've got stuff coming\nsoon I'm around in April let me see\noh sweet thrilled on Wednesday we have\nan interview about the science of\nConsciousness very excited about that um\nso that too is going to be like I don't\nknow that there's going to be anything\npractical in that but it can't always be\nabout helping you okay sometimes we got\nto talk about cool stuff can't always be\nlike me me me like oh my God I need help\nI need help K it's like no no sometimes\nwe're just going to talk to someone who\nis an expert on ious and we're going to\njust see where that leads us so thank\nyou all very much for coming to"
