    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about why\nventing is a bad\nidea now this sort of came to my\nattention recently when I've noticed\nthat there's an increasing trend of\ncontent creators to like vent about\nwhat's going on in their life on Twitter\nlike influencers and stuff kind of do\nthis stuff they're like yeah you know\nlike life is so hard like this I'm going\nthrough this I'm going through this and\neveryone is like oh my God like this\nguy's so brave like this girl is so\nbrave like so great like people are like\nsharing their feelings and stuff\nand then it also does something really\ncool right because we tend to do a lot\nof what other content creators do so if\nthey start buying this thing or playing\nthis video game then I'm going to start\nbuying that thing or playing that video\ngame right that's how the Creator\neconomy runs and so this is also really\ngreat because once like content creators\nshare their mental health struggles like\nwe're all inspired to share the same\nright yeah this is great like this is a\nbig part of what we do in this community\nright the problem is that like this\ndoesn't really work out well kind of\nscientifically and so like let me tell\nyouall what I'm talking about this kind\nof reminds me of a situation where let's\nsay I'm in a room and I feel really\nuncomfortable on the inside because I'm\nfull of gas right and then what I end up\ndoing is I like I got to let out the\nBadness so I got to literally vent the\ngas so I end up farting and then\neveryone's like wow like look at this\nperson like farting is so stigmatized\nyou know like we're not allowed to fart\nbut everybody farts and everyone else is\nlike yeah like I'm inspired let me vent\nmy gas and I'm in this room where this\none person is farted and everyone has\nstarted clapping and everyone else is\nlike you know what I'm going to fart too\nI need to fart too and then they all\nstart farting and then before you\nrealize that you are in a room where\neveryone is passing gas and so each\nindividual person feels a little bit\nbetter but you are in a room that smells\nliterally like and this is what the\ninternet has become like right can we\nall agree that like it's become a\ncesspool of venting with like no one\ndoing anything about it so I'm all for\nsharing your feelings as a psychiat\ninterest as a content creator we even\nhelp content creators with that kind of\nthing we've got you know programs where\nwe've supported over 500 content\ncreators to vent their feelings and then\ndo something about it because that's\nreally what venting is about so let's\ntake a quick look at why psychiatrists\nand therapists are all for venting so\nwhen someone comes into my office right\nand they start venting about something\nif I'm in my opinion a good psychiatrist\nit doesn't end with the venting the\nventing is a step right so let's\nunderstand so like when I'm filled with\nnegative emotion it can be very hard for\nme to see clearly so if I go and I talk\nto a therapist or a psychiatrist I vent\nthat negative emotion but then as the\npsychiatrist or therapist hopefully what\nthey're doing is they're not looking for\nyou to come back week after week after\nweek just to vent whatever is going on\nin your particular day what they're\nhopefully doing is venting so that you\ncan start to do things about what you're\nunhappy with right so as a psychiatrist\nwhen someone comes in and says oh my\npartner is like not loving and they're\nabusive and they're this or they're that\nor they have a drinking problem or\nwhatever so I'll like validate them for\na while I'll talk to them about wow that\nsounds genuinely very difficult and it\nsounds like you really love this person\nand at the same time like they can\nreally turn into a real monster when\nthey've been drinking like that must be\nso hard for you so we as psychiatrist\nthis is why we do this right so we\nactually like speed up the venting\nprocess through validation so we're like\nlet's get this moving okay I'm\ngoing to tell you why your life is so\nhard I'm going to validate validate\nvalidate and then 100 minutes of venting\nturns into 30 minutes of venting and\nthen is the psychiatrist what I do is I\nsay okay now we're what what are we\ngoing to do about it right so what we do\nthe reason we encourage venting and the\nreason we use validation is to speed it\nup is to decompress that emotion so you\ncan take appropriate action the problem\nwith venting is that it's a form of\nemotion focused coping and the problem\nwith emotion focused coping is that over\ntime it doesn't actually lead to good\nthings so let's take a quick look at\nventing and understand what it is and\nhow it works so venting is a form of\nsomething called emotion focused coping\nand here's what we know about a emotion\nfocused coping so this is a from a paper\nabout maladaptive coping mechanisms\ndeveloping in childhood so children\nfacing chronic and uncontrollable stress\nuh less often cope by actively\nattempting to solve problems and\nmanaging their emotions okay so in fact\nactive attempts to intervene in\nuncontrollably stressful situations lead\nto to undesirable social outcomes so\nwhat does this mean this means that when\nyou're a child growing up if you try to\nfix a problem like your parents are\nfighting and they're going to get\ndivorced it doesn't end well instead\nwhat children learn how to do is manage\nstress through acceptance they don't\ntend to do a whole lot of cognitive\nreframing but they tend to focus on\ntheir emotions right so I can't fix mom\nor dad because that's not going to\nhappen but what I can do is make myself\nfeel better by playing a particular\nvideo game and so we tend to is that\nthis form of coping emotion Focus coping\nwhere I can't fix the outside world I\ncan just fix my emotions it works but\nthe problem is that this pattern of\nfindings um of Reliance on an efficacy\nof avoidance right so the problem is\nthat when we focus on avoidance of the\nproblem which is what emotion focused\ncoping is it actually works the problem\nis that it doesn't work for very long so\nhowever while adaptive for chronic\nstress Reliance on avoidance does not\nequip children to cope with all the\ncircumstances they will encounter in\nlife and places them at risk for mental\nhealth problems so what does this\nmean this means that basically we know\nthat emotion focused coping or venting\nis effective if you can't do anything\nabout the problem because when there's\nnothing you can do all you can do is\nvent hey just a quick note a lot of\npeople will ask us what do I do next and\nthat's why we built Dr K's guide It's a\ncomprehensive resource that distills\nover 20 years years of my experience\nboth as a monk and as a psychiatrist and\nit's designed in a way that's tailored\nto fit your needs so if you're\ninterested in better understanding your\nmind and taking control of your life\ncheck out the link below here's what we\nknow about the science of emotion Focus\ncoping as kids learn to be avoidant\nbecause they can't fix the problem it\nactually leads to more problems later in\nlife because as you grow up your ability\nto do things actually increases but if\nall you've ever done is vent or manage\nyour emotions instead of actually fixing\nproblems it starts to create more\nproblems in life and so it can be\nadaptive if you have no control but as\nyour control increases it becomes more\nmaladaptive and so this is why we got to\nbe careful about venting because with a\npsychiatrist it can work really well but\nwhen we do it on our own it creates all\nkinds of problems so as we look at\nventing we begin to see there's another\nkey problem with it which is that the\npurpose of venting is to get rid of\nnegative emotions right and this is the\nmain thing that we need to understand\nthe most powerful\nmotivators of our Behavior are actually\nnegative emotions when you get\nincredibly angry it is easy to act when\nyou feel very very ashamed of your\nappearance it's very hard for you to\nleave the house and you may say but hold\non a second doesn't that make my life\nhard no what is the shame actually\nmotivating you to do it is a very\npowerful motivator to stay home and so\nthis is why there's kind of an\ninteresting balance with venting because\nwhat tends to happen with people who\nvent a lot is that they vent about the\nproblem but they never actually do\nanything about it and you may know\npeople in your life who are like this\nwho have this almost habitual way of\nventing and maybe a mom or dad or sister\nor whatever who are constantly griping\nabout the same thing oh my God my life\nis hard this way and this way and this\nway oh my God this sucks this sucks this\nsucks this sucks this sucks and then\nthey never end up doing anything about\nit because if you really pay attention\nthere is a correlation be between how\nmuch you about something and how\nlittle you actually do about it and the\nreason for that is very simple\nneuroscientific it is as we vent the\nnegative emotion we actually disable our\nmotivation to fix the problem which is\nwhy it works if I'm a child in an\nabusive household because I can't fix\nanything anyway but then it sabotages me\nlater in life when I am able to fix\nthings but instead I keep on leaking out\nmy emotional energy there is even a more\nsubtle problem at play here which is\nsomething that we're going to learn from\nthe yogic tradition which is something\ncalled a vasana so as we mentioned\nearlier we know that there are these\npeople who will vent about the same\nthing over and over and over again and\nthis is particularly Insidious not just\nbecause of the motivation but because of\nthe mental habit it creates now this is\nwhat aasa is so to illustrate this I'm\ngoing to give you all an example so I\nhad a patient who came into my office I\nwas their eighth or ninth therapy IST\nthey're about 48 years old okay so\nthey've been in therapy since they were\n15 or 16 and what they would do is\nthey'd come into my office and they'd\nvent about their day I'm sad because of\nthis and this thing went wrong and this\nthing went wrong and I was like a second\nyear or thirdy year Psychiatry resident\nso I was just like I just finished two\nyears of training so I'm like okay this\nis what Psychotherapy is I'm here to\nlisten to people talk about how sad they\nare like that's me being supportive\nright then a couple months went by and\nthen I was like bro is this helping and\nhe's like what do you mean is it helping\nand I was like is this actually helping\nyou and he's like well like I don't know\nI mean I'm like do you feel better than\nyou did 6 months ago and he's like no I\nmean my life hasn't improved at all and\nbut he's like isn't this what therapy is\nsupposed to be like aren't I supposed to\ncome here and like talk about my\nfeelings and that's when I started to\nrealize wait something is going\nsomething is off here and that's when I\nactually like so usually when I don't\nunderstand something in Psychiatry I'll\nread Psychiatry stuff but then I also\nread like yogic stuff and I stumbled\nupon this idea of a Vasa so a Vasa is a\nmental habit and the big problem with a\nmental habit is that once you start\nventing in a particular way your neurons\nkind of get concrete about that sort of\nthing you develop literally a mental\nhabit where all it takes is a tiny\ntrigger for your mind to go through this\nwell rehearsed form of thinking which\nfrequently venting is so if you want a\ngood example of this you can go to like\ndating forums or incel borums where\nthese are people who let's take incels\nI'm not trying to bash incels let's just\nlook at what it is okay so these are\npeople who you know went on a couple of\ndates many a few maybe a few years ago\nand yet they go on the internet every\nsingle day and they will type about how\nalone they are how alone they are how\nalone they are and you can't argue with\nthem or anything like that but they\nspend hours and hours and hours in their\nown head thinking about how alone they\nare and the really weird thing is if we\nsort of look at life for a second okay\nso like let me let me give you all kind\nof a quick example of this so let's take\na look at let's understand\nvasas okay so aasana is a mental habit\nnow here's the tricky thing if we're\nlooking at people like incels or someone\nwho gets triggered to vent so what\nyou've got is you've got one kind of\nexposure and once you trigger the once\nthe exposure triggers this exposure can\neven be less than 5 seconds so this can\nbe something as simple as I logged to\nthe internet and I saw a happy couple\nsmiling and then this triggers a venting\nresponse and this can be like\nminutes to hours and if you know people\nwho have vasas you know what I'm talking\nabout because you can trigger that\npattern of thinking and they will say\nthe same damn thing over and over and\nover again right so I play the game of\nDota 2 maybe I'll play League of Legends\nand sometimes something is overpowered\nand the moment that I see that every\ntime I lose to this particular hero I\n I log on the forums and I rant\nthis hero is so overpowered and I spend\n35 minutes of my life because I played\none game of DOTA because I saw this\nparticular person and then now I'm off\ntrack I see someone else playing that\nthat person that particular hero I start\nranting and raving the Vasa triggers the\nmental habit triggers and the real\nproblem with triggering vasas is a 5sec\nexposure can cost you 30\nminutes and now let's look at what our\nlife looks like if we have a bunch of\nASAS so 5-second trigger 30 minutes\nanother 5-second trigger 30 minutes\nanother 5-second trigger 30 minutes\nanother 5-second trigger 30 minutes and\nyou'll notice this if you go on these\nplaces that are kind of like safe spaces\non the Internet it's a bunch of people\nconstantly venting and so even though my\nexposure in life has only been 20\nseconds two negative things I have\ncreated 2 hours of negativity in my mind\nthis is what a Vasa is it is a mental\nhabit and the more that we vent the more\nour mind gets into the habit of venting\nand the more that we get into the habit\nof venting the easier it is for our mind\nto go to that particular place and then\nall we need is a single\ntrigger to knock us off on this kind of\nrant which I I don't know if yall had\nthis but like you know my mom is like\nthis where she has like particular rants\nthat she likes to go on I have family\nmembers that have particular rants that\nthey like to go on even I like to go on\nparticular rants these are all vasas and\nthe real problem with venting is not\nonly does it decompress our negative\nemotional energy but it trains our mind\nto think continuously negative thoughts\nthat's what venting is if we never go\nabout fixing the problem because then\nwhat happens the circumstance is here\ntriggers the venting and then no\nemotional energy and then I don't\nactually change anything so then the\ncircumstance triggers again and again\nand again and again and then my mind\ngets better and better and better at\nventing venting venting venting venting\nuntil all I'm doing is farting all day\nand never actually fixing the problem so\nI encourage you all to be very careful\nabout venting and here's the right way\nto do it the first is if you work with a\nprofessional hopefully you find one that\nis helping you vent for the sake of\nactually doing something and even if\nyou're not working with a professional\nyou can do that yourself so here's the\nmain question I've got for youall when\nyou vent what do you do to fix the\nproblem after you vent if the answer is\nabsolutely nothing now you know why\nyou're constantly venting\nbecause you're never actually doing\nanything to fix\nit so the next time you vent do\nsomething about it do something even if\nit's minuscule if it's insignificant\nspend 5 minutes actually addressing\nminimum of 5 minutes addressing the\nproblem that you're venting and you may\nsay but there's nothing I can do about\nit stop and think for a second oh my\nboss doesn't like me I'm venting about\nmy boss venting about my boss venting\nabout my boss why doesn't your boss like\nyou because they give me they criticize\nme well maybe you could do slightly\nbetter at your job do you think that\ncould make a difference no I've tried\nthat it doesn't work that is a Vasa you\nsee how quickly it jumps up no I've\ntried it it doesn't work I've tried it\nit doesn't work I've tried it doesn't\nwork oh I see you tried it how many\ntimes I've tried it a million times it\nnever works chances are you've tried it\na couple of times and it doesn't work\nand then you've started to form a Vasa\nof when I try things they don't work and\nthen you get stuck in this particular\nway so now we get to the Vasa this is\nthe third thing that you can do observe\nthe mental habit of your mind observe\nthat when you are in a particular\nsituation all it takes is a trigger and\nthen watch how your mind is as soon as\nyou hit the play button it's like an\nunskippable ad where now that we've\n strapped ourselves in and we've\nstarted this video we're going to have\nto sit through this 15 minutes of BS and\njust notice wow look at my mind this all\nyou need to do to melt a Vasa is observe\nthe automaticity of it so wow now my\nmind is off on that track now my mind is\noff on the track now my mind is off on\nthe track holy crap Let It Go like Let\nisn't literally like let it run its\ncourse and watch it and don't don't\nstress about it now if you guys want\nsome of these techniques of how to\nobserve and things like that I\ndefinitely recommend you check out our\nmeditation guide we'll teach you about a\nlot of this mental training but all you\nneed to do is observe the Vasa so at the\nend of the day youall need to be a\nlittle bit careful about venting venting\ncan be absolutely healthy if it precedes\naction if it helps stabilize you because\ntoo much negative emotion is\noverwhelming we want to modulate that\nnegative emotion down to where we still\nhave enough emotional energy to motivate\nto act this is what a therapist does but\nif you don't do this if instead you just\nvent for the sake of venting and then\nyou vent again and vent again vent again\nyou're forming a mental habit and then\nthe real problem with that mental habit\nis that mental habit will make it harder\nfor you to do something because now your\nbody has a habituated response when this\nproblem happens how do I deal with it I\n about it so now it becomes harder\nand harder and harder it's kind of like\nyou know once you train yourself to be\nright-handed it's it's hard to start\nwriting with your left hand so once once\nyour mind trains with a particular Vasa\nof this is how I'm going to deal with\nthis problem I'm just going to\nabout it it becomes harder and harder\nand harder to work with your left hand\nto actually do something about your\nproblem so be careful about venting and\nobserve your\n[Music]\nvasanas"
