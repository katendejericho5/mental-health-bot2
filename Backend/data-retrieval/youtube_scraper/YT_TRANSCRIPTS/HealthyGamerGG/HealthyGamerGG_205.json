    "transcript": "if I ask you what masculinity is where\ndid that answer come from for most\npeople out there their impressions of\nwhat it means to be a man is stuff that\nthey've been spoonfed over the course of\ntheir life you've not actually decided\nthis you've not decided what kind of man\nyou want to be everyone has told you\nwhat kind of man to be this is your idea\nof masculinity and even the objective\ndefinition if you look it up in a\ndictionary or Wikipedia masculinity will\nbe defined as society's expectations of\nwhat a man is society is not a thing\nit's an abstraction and yet we take this\nabstraction from the outside world and\nthen we put it into ourselves and we try\nto live up to society's expectations\nimpossible cuz society's not even a real\nperson so masculinity we've internalized\nit for sure but what I'm saying is that\neven in to function in society we need\nsome kind of ego so what I'm encouraging\nthat you all do is develop a healthy\nsense of masculinity you decide what you\nwant to be in life and we're just\nattaching the label of it of masculinity\nbecause it's easier for us to relate\nto"
