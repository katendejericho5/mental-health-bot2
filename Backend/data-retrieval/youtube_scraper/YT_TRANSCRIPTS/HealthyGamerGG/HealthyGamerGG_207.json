that\nchat pop out that chat son okay um happy\nApril 1st everyone we were thinking\nabout doing something for April Fool's\nDay but we decided not to or maybe we're\ndoing something and I just don't know\nand the joke's on\nme okay happy Monday everybody so today\nwe're going to be talking about a couple\nof cool things welcome to all our first\ntime chatters\num yeah Vata is Right Vata gang let's go\nOkay so we've got some fun stuff for\ny'all\ntoday uh I wanted to start off by just\ntouching on this actually so\nsomeone posted something in our\nsubreddit and I wanted to just talk\nabout this\num okay this is not what I want to talk\nabout this is not what I want to talk\nabout this is not what oh here we go\nuh I don't know if you guys saw this but\nNPR had an\narticle\num and I just wanted to talk about this\nfor just a hot second okay let me go\nahead and go over here and\nthen okay I don't know if you guys saw\nthis\nbut um so a new podcast examines the\nPerils of intense\nmeditation so this is there's a podcast\nthat is looking at vipasana\nRetreats um and I just wanted to talk\nabout this for just a hot\nsecond so see we have a lot of\npeople think that meditation is like\nsafe and that's reasonable to to to\nthink about right so we we have a lot of\nstudies that show that meditation\nis effective at doing things like\ntreating mental illness so you know we\nhave studies that show that like\nmindfulness-based stress reduction is\neffective at reducing depression and\nanxiety um so we have all these studies\non like\nmindfulness and sometimes I'll have and\nso people have heard about the\ntransformative powers of meditation\nright so people will say like oh my God\nlike meditation changed my life and even\nDr K will say like oh my God meditation\nchanged my life and it really did but I\nI want youall to remember that like so\nwhat meditation does is it helps you re\nprogram yourself this is one way to kind\nof put it and the challenge though is\nthat often times like you know there's\nintense healing with meditation there's\nintense transformation but you're kind\nof playing with fire you're like sort of\nediting the source code and so if you\ndon't do it properly it can be very\ndangerous we've talked about on stream\nyou know we've shared peer-reviewed\narticles of meditation induced psychosis\nwhich I've seen before I've had patients\nwho were like acutely mentally ill like\nsevere depression or even in in manic\nstates that have wanted to go on vasha\nRetreats because there's this idea that\nlike okay if meditation is so helpful\nand transformative the sicker I am the\nmore I can be healed right and then on\ntop of that there's evidence that\nmeditation is helpful for depression and\nanxiety so the sicker you are the more\nintense of meditation the more you'll be\nhealed doesn't work like that so when I\nhave patients who are acutely mentally\nill I do not recommend an actually\nactively advise against doing very\nintensive meditation Retreats because\nthose intensive meditation Retreats are\nquite challenging like especially viasa\nis like quite quite challenging it can\nbe good um and it can be transformative\nbut it's also like quite brutal so if we\nthink about when people are like acutely\nmentally ill and you cut them off from\nother evidence-based supports for mental\nillness like social support family even\nlike dietary changes your pets all that\nkind of stuff it can be very dangerous\nso I I don't know I mean I think this\narticle talks about negative impacts\nfrom vipasha Retreats I think the\nvipasha people made a statement that you\nknow hundreds of thousands of people\nhave gone through our Retreats and this\nis a handful of cases and stuff like\nthat so I I I don't I don't think that\nvipasha I mean maybe this is fameless\nlast words but from my understanding of\nvipasha I don't think that it's like a\nbad thing I think though that there's a\nvery common misconception that\nmeditation is entirely safe and what we\nknow like I've had teachers who for\nexample told me that I would become like\nvery hypersexual and that I would like\nstart sexually assaulting people if I\ndid this particular kind of meditation\nso this kind of meditation is done only\nunder the guidance of a guru and like\nout in the woods so when you start like\nplaying with fire and editing the source\ncode and stuff like that like you can\nget burned so just a quick safety\nreminder that what we know about sort of\nthe effects of meditation and this is\nwe're going to talk for a second about\nthe research on meditation so when we do\nresearch on\nmeditation the effects of meditation\nthat we're aware of have to do usually\nwith like 8 week trials so what happens\nin these in the majority vast majority\nof these trials is you have like people\nwho are like will come in first thing to\nremember is that a lot of meditation\ntrials exclude people with mental\nillness because if someone's mentally\nill it messes up the research so so\npeople are like actively mentally ill\nthey don't even include people in the\ntrial so we don't have much data on how\nmeditation helps people in with acute\nmental\nillness second thing is that these these\ninterventions are done in a normal\nenvironment with generally speaking\nnormal people so people go home they go\nto like a meditation class like every\nday for like two weeks and then they\npractice on their own for like six weeks\nor something like that it's like an hour\nand a half of class like for two weeks\nin a row 10 days and then you practice\non your own and you keep a journal like\nthat's what most of these trials are\nlike like but during all these periods\nof time people have access to their\nexisting support\nstructures and the last thing to\nremember is that these meditation trials\nare never done on or not never very\nrarely done on very very dedicated and\nintense meditators so you have some of\nthese trials on for example like Tumo\nmeditation so um you know Benson Henry\nin\n1982 did a study on Tumo meditation and\nwhat they found in that trial was that\npeople who engage in Tumo\nmeditation solid\npractitioners can change the body\ntemperature of their peripheral digits\nby 8Â° C so they took normal people and\nlike stuck them in a freezer and they\ntook two M meditators and they stuck\nthem in a freezer and what they found is\nthere was an 8 degre Celsius difference\nbetween the two so the key thing to\nremember though is that just because\nTumo intense practitioners of Tumo can\nraise their body temperature by up to 8\ndegrees probably not core temperature by\nthe way this is per full digits core\ntemperature I think is like 2 or 3\ndegrees\nCel doesn't mean that you should go out\nand like sit in a freezer if you're\ndoing your basic mindfulness exercise so\none thing to remember is that all our\nstudies on meditation and this is also\nwhere we sort of look at the flip side\nwhich is that I think meditation is\ncapable of far more than what science\nhas thus far been able to detect but the\nreason is because in order to see those\nkinds of effects you need very very\ndedicated meditators for an extended\nperiod of time and we sometimes do\nstudies on these people but they tend to\nbe very very small sample sizes and so\nit's not we don't get like 10,000 people\nit's like we're going to find three\nmonks who live in the Himalayas and\nwe're going to measure some\ncardiovascular stuff with them so the\nkey thing to remember here is that you\nknow we're big Advocates of meditation\nhere but we're also big Advocates of\npracticing meditation safely and like\nyou can get caught up in the Silver\nBullet of meditation thinking oh my God\nthis particular thing is going to fix me\nthis medication is going to fix me this\npsychedelics will fix me Dr K will fix\nme this particular thing will fix me and\npeople will do that with meditation too\nand then they'll get sorely disappointed\nor in worst case scenarios burned um\njust a quick also safety reminder that\nyou know when it comes to these\nintensive meditation Retreats they\nreally need to be done intense means\nthat you need to be as centered as you\ncan you need to be as grounded as you\ncan and there's still a grueling\nespecially these youring Retreats where\nyou're not allowed to talk talk to\npeople and then you know it's some\npeople will even describe it as like\ntorture is what it feels like and then\nif you make it to the end some people\nfeel quite Changed by it some people\ndon't um so just please be careful y'all\nthere's a reason why we don't teach a\nlot of esoteric practices of meditation\nwe tend to teach really simple safe\nstuff and remember that if yall are\ndoing some kind of practice especially\nthings like thoa where you're not\nclosing your eyes and things like that\nplease talk to a doctor if you have any\nof eye problems or you're having weird\nsymptoms or things like that never go so\nhere's the problem is that you know\nnormally when you have a a meditation\nteacher so when I teach patients in my\noffice it's different because I'm a\nmedical doctor so if they come to me and\nthey say like oh hey Dr K I'm having\nthis weird symptom I'm like okay let's\npause and just to be safe let's evaluate\nyou for stroke and do a quick cranial\nnerve exam and test your peripheral\nsensation and things like that and like\nwe're going to just see if your you know\ncranial nerve 12 is intact so stick out\nyour tongue so I'm able to do those\nthings when I teach meditation in my\noffice because I can assure or not\nassure but you know I can I can have\nsome degree of safety because I know\nwhat I'm doing and I'm also a medical\ndoctor and that's also why you all need\nto be extra careful and please talk to\nmedical professionals or mental health\nprofessionals if any of the meditation\npractices that we're giving you don't\ntend to work very well or make you feel\nweird like don't engage in them um part\nof the other thing that we try to do\nhere is remember that we offer lots of\ndifferent meditation technique so the\ngoal is to find one that is easy and\nfeels good and helps you in a positive\nway okay um does that make\nsense we\ngood\nokay uh we are doing something on the\nDiscord GG Dr K got fooled okay well\nthat's not neither the first nor the\nlast\ntime so I still remember what was it you\nguys were\ntalking to me about you know I'm from\nsaganda\nor what I don't even\nremember but trolling Dr K is a time\nhonored art it's an art form at this\npoint something that people will go\nto you know University to study let's\nsee if we can troll Dr K it's all in\ngood fun okay should we get to stuff\nchat all\nright um\nall right we have a quick win that we\nwant to share with y'all because you\nknow wins are\ngood thanks Dr K I tried therapy and it\nworked hi all I decided to go for\ntherapy after watching some of videos of\nDr K I'm glad for that decision um it's\nbeen the best decision of my life my\nself-esteem is greatly improved I feel\nso much better about myself now my focus\non work has also improved additionally I\nhave a great relationship with my\ntherapist now when I was in college I\nused to read about yian psychology I\nfeel so blessed that I can discuss yian\nideas with him even though he is not a\nyian analyst I read Bas books based on I\nread based yian psychology and whenever\nI don't understand something I ask him\ndirectly and he offers me his\nperspective on it we both have\nintellectual discussion sometimes it's\nlike having The Best of Both Worlds I\nget to see my life from his perspective\nand from yian ideas before visiting my\ntherapist I had wrong evaluations in my\nmind which we discussed in length and it\ncleared a lot of my doubts I will\npresent one in of my Improvement before\nwhen people looked at me or in my\ndirection for some reason I used to\nthink that maybe I look bad or like a\ncartoon now in the same scenario I feel\nmaybe they are looking at me because\nthey like a particular style of mine\nalso I've started to take care of how I\nlook now I feel more secured in my\nidentity than before I didn't have a\ngood childhood and affected me those\nblind spots have been healed to a great\nextent now also I would like to get to I\nwould like to all the healthy Gamers\nhere for support I would like to thank I\nassume that I received in response to\nposts I made in this sub before um my\nlife isn't perfect in any way I got\nchallenges and challenges are meant to\nbe faced my therapist is an inspiration\nfor me he taught me how to bravely look\nat life he's the first therapist I\nvisited and it worked\nwonderfully so I know that frequently\nwhen we talk about therapy um people\nwill say they've had bad experiences\nsometimes I'll even you know I I made a\nvideo about how therapy sucks for men\nand and at the same time like you know\nthere there are some weaknesses in the\nfield just like any other field and to\ndate it Still Remains the best\nevidence-based reliable intervention to\nimprove your mental health and your\nlife and to I mean I love being a\ntherapist it's great and I'm I'm really\nhappy to hear that we have inspired\npeople to go to therapy sometimes I'll\ntalk about the criticisms of therapy but\ngenerally speaking it's a wonderful\nfield and I think there's immense\nbenefit to be gained from it so\nI think it's super cool when this person\ntalks about how therapy was a success\nbut that's kind of what we do here we\ntry to but this person also mentions\nthat the community was incredibly\nsupportive they've been watching our\nvideos so we try to educate and remember\nthat if you want to move your life in\nthe right direction it's not a silver\nbullet it usually is like a moderate\namount of multiple things when woven\ntogether will lead to a lot of benefit\nsee the biggest mistake that a lot of\npeople make in their life is they think\nthat oh my God I have so big such big\nproblems and they think that big\nproblems require big\nSolutions but in my experience clinical\nexperience this is most huge problems\nare actually solved through mild\ninterventions that are combined so\nremember that when I look at let's say\none piece of string the string is not\ncannot support a lot of weight but when\nI weave together multiple pieces of\nstring into to a rope when I braid\nthings together the tensile strength of\nthe Rope is greater than the individual\ntensile strengths of the individual\nstrands put together right so there is a\nsynergistic effect of multiple things\ndone in a small\namount so we even see this for example\nin in in Psychotherapy and medication\nwhere the best outcomes are when we tend\nto combine the two interventions it\ndoesn't mean that everyone needs\nmedication or everyone needs\npsychotherapy but we tend to find that\nin life generally speaking like what\nlike if you're super super behind you\ndon't need to transform you just need to\ndo a handful of things a small amount\nconsistently over time and that will\nlead to\ntransformation so remember when when\nyou're setting your course and you're\nsailing across to the ocean a 1% change\nin the direction of your course will\nwind you up in a completely different\nplace over time so small changes over a\nlarge amount of time is usually what\ncreat change and in my personal life you\nknow we sort of talk about this failed\nout of whatever and then ended up at\nHarvard whatever whatever blah blah blah\nblah blah and the key thing to remember\nthat I think a lot of people don't\nrealize is that that time span was 15\nyears right it was 15 years of and I\ngamed the whole time right it's not like\nI ever gave up gaming for I mean maybe\nfor a couple months at a time or\nsomething like that so you can live your\nlife and enjoy yourself and and take it\nslow you don't need gigantic Solutions\nyou just need small Solutions and a\ncouple of them together you'll be amazed\nokay so thank you very much for sharing\nthat all\nrighty okay let's let's figure out what\nwhat do youall want to do next I'm going\nto give you all two choices\nokay choices oh\nGod\nokay how do\nI oh God\ndocs chat\nokay all right so let's see which one\nyall want to do first\nchat okay we've got two choices that\nwe're going to do\nfirst all right so post number\none why is this so accurate and how do\nyou make it stop needs social\ninteraction interacts with people gets\noverwhelmed isolates gets lost in own\nthoughts over thinks so we can talk\nabout this cycle of social anxiety\nisolation and\nDesperation or we can talk about the\n25-year-old\nthinker has created entire anthologies\nof imaginary events completely unaware\nof surroundings except when driving has\nmultiple imaginary girlfriends imagines\nwhat it what it be like to start a life\nover with everything he's learned in a\nmon monologue has become his entire\nreality can't understand new things just\ngets caught in analysis paralysis just\nthinks about blah blah blah blah barely\nreads just thinks imagine success to\ncope instead of actually achieving it\nthings are always better in my head so\nlet's do a quick poll I'm going to see\nif I can orchestrate a\npoll which\nfirst okay and then I'm going to see cuz\nwe're okay looks like 25-year-old\nthinker is\nwinning right\nnow um let me go can I do a poll this\nway we're g to get to\nboth\nokay all right looks like 25y old\nthinker is winning for now okay so we'll\ndo this first all right fair enough chat\nfair enough thank you very much for the\nguidance I much appreciate\nit let\nme I think it's time to start using like\nlike these Elgato buttons because I'm\nstarting to now\nrealize okay most people want to do two\nfair enough fair enough chat thank you\nso much okay\nso give me a\nsecond\num\nokay\nokay so let's get\nstarted all right so here we have\nthe 25 year old thinker\nokay see this works better nope this\none's better okay so we have the 25-year\nold\nthinker now let's understand a couple of\nbasic things about the mind so in in\nsome\npeople their mind is just so I would say\nenergetic and out of control so some\nsometimes our mind if you really pay\nattention to yourself the Mind loves to\nthink and what we find is that these\npeople kind of get trapped in their\nthoughts right so they end up\nhaving change the how do I change the\ncolor okay so they have imaginary events\nimaginary girlfriends right they're\nabsorbed they're unaware of their\nsurroundings\nimagines right so inner monologue\nbecomes their entire\nreality so there are a couple of things\nto re understand about why this happens\nand what to do about it the first thing\nthat we have to talk a little bit about\nis this happens because the mind is out\nof our control so the mind is an\ninstrument right so it's just like any\nother part of our\nbody and the goal of the body is that\nthe body and mind should be controlled\nby you the body should not control you\nyou should control the body right and we\nrun into all kinds of problems when\npeople are not in control of their\nbodies so like in the worst case\nscenarios we get things like\nincontinence and so in the same way that\nwe can sometimes lose control of our\nbody we lose control of our mind and so\nif you look at this person what they're\nwhat they end up with is a mind that\ndoes whatever it wants to and we're\ngoing to dive into why it does all of\nthese things everything is kind of\nstitched together but there's one major\nprinciple to understand see we have to\nunderstand what the Mind\nwants so what does the mind hate more\nthan anything else what it hates more\nthan anything else is\nboredom so if you look at like what the\nmind like you know I only want to do\nthings that are very engaging so if we\nunderstand okay why does the Mind hate\nboredom so in the absence of stimulus\nthe mind will run out of energy see in\norder for the mind to gain\nenergy it must have some kind of\nstimulus so very simple thing let's say\nI'm walking down the street and I see a\nfight break out in front of me oh my God\nthis is so much to think about or forget\nabout walking down the street if you\nlook at the internet what do we see all\nthe time we see drama why why does the\ninternet love drama right some someone\nparticular person does something someone\nmakes a post about it they said oh I\nthis person is not actually a saint they\ndid this to me and then everyone talks\nabout it and then they react to it and\nall this kind of stuff right this kind\nof stuff is going on right now with\nsomeone where article came out that was\ntalking about something bad that they\ndid and now everyone on the Internet is\nat\nWar and why why does the why does the\nwhy does the internet love this because\nour minds love it why do they love it\nbecause if there's a stimulus then I get\nenergy in the mind and if the mind has\nenergy it runs right so this is what\nalso confuses a lot of people that a lot\nof people are really confused why does\nmy mind why is my an mind anxious all\nthe\ntime why I don't feel good that's\nbecause the mind will take any kind of\nenergy it can get and anxiety produces a\nlot of energy see anytime you add\ntension to the Mind anytime you try to\nwrestle the mind the Mind actually loves\nit it gets way stronger because you try\nto control the anxiety and then you\nwrestle with it for a while and the\nanxiety comes roaring back twice as\nstrong and then the mind is going again\nright so the more anxiety we have the\nmore that the Mind activates we're not\nchill when the mind is active so the\nfirst thing to look at is what happens\nto the energy of the mind with all of\nthese things the energy of the Mind\nincreases see look what what what's\nHappening Here created entire\nanthologies of imaginary events oh my\nGod the mind has discovered a way to\nfeed itself this is like an infinite\nmoney glitch for your mental energy\nmultiple imaginary girlfriends now I can\nengage with my thoughts I don't require\nan external stimulus I certainly don't\nrequire a real\ngirlfriend right because I can create a\nstimulus by\nmyself there's an inner monologue that\nbecomes their entire reality so they get\nabsorbed in the mind and then as the\nenergy of the Mind increases they lose\ncontrol of it because now it's like a\ngigantic bull that thinks whatever it\nwants to whenever the [Â __Â ] it wants to\nand screw you so then we run into a\ncouple of problems so as the energy of\nthe Mind increases there are a couple of\nother things that play So as we become\nthinkers we start to be\nbecome worse at\nlife right because thinking is\nuseful so when\nthinking is\ncombined with\nexperience this is when things go well\nright so let's say I'm playing a game of\nLeague of Legends or valerant or Dota or\nStarcraft or whatever sf6 we're going to\npick sf6 today so I can think Theory\ncraft all I want in Street Fighter 6 it\ndoesn't actually make me good at the\ngame and if all I do is I play\nmindlessly I'm also not going to be good\nat the game if I never think about my\ngames I'm never going to be good so\nsuccess in life comes from the\ncombination of thought plus\nexperience but what happens with the The\nThinker is that they don't have any\nexperience they just have thoughts right\ntheir inner monologue becomes a\nsubstitute for reality so the first\nthing is that the Mind loves this energy\nbecause this person this person is a\n25-year-old thinker they've been a\nthinker for way longer than just this\nyear they didn't become a thinker at 25\nthey've been think thinking more and\nmore and more and if you're a\n25-year-old think girl you'll notice\nthat this pattern probably started in\nyour teenage\nyears and then as you grew more and more\ndependent on thinking you got worse at\nlife because you started using\nthought as a\nsubstitute for\nexperience right so then your actual\nexperience goes\ndown your actual performance goes\ndown and then you're you end up\nhere right oh my God if only I knew\neverything that I know now then then I\ncould start living your life think for a\nsecond you know everything that you know\nnow you can still start living your\nlife\nright you can start living your life at\n25 oh but I'm\nbehind and so now we get to a really\nreally important problem of this okay so\nwhy do we why do we imagine going back\nin time so let's think about this right\nso you have all this knowledge now\ngreat so start living but then the\nThinker says\nno why not well because if I start\nliving now then like I don't know I'm\nbehind\nand this is where we get to a huge\nproblem with the Thinker another major\nmajor major problem which explains this\nand this and\nthis okay and\nthis so generally speaking the more that\nwe think the less emotionally connected\nwe\nbecome and as we have negative emotions\nthat pile up right because now I've\nlived a life where I'm not doing\nanything for 25 years I'm behind this\nleads to negative\nemotion not having girlfriends or boy\nfriends or whatever non-binary friends\nleads to negative\nemotion so not accomplishing anything in\nlife is going to lead to negative\nemotion and now this is where we have\nour imaginary stuff come in so if we\nlook at studies on things like\nmaladaptive daydreaming we know that\nimagination is an emotional coping\nmechanism so then what ends up happening\nis we sort of have all these negative\nemotions and then we start imagining\nother things and while we're imagining\nhow great things could be we feel a\nlittle bit better because in our brain\nour brain thinks we can't actually\nimprove we can't start now it's too late\nI'm too far behind I can't start dating\nat 25 what Ridiculousness is this I'm\njust supposed to I can't it's too late I\nwas supposed to start dating when I was\n15 and if I started when I was 15 then I\nwould have gotten my first long-term\nrelationship in college when I was 19 I\nwould have had sex with at least five\npeople by now and then since I'm 25 I\nwould be able to like engage with other\n25y olds on the same playing\nfield but it's too late now so I'm not\ngoing to engage and this hurts and then\nthe negative emotions require something\nlike maladaptive daydreaming or\nimagination to Salve our\nwounds but it gets worse than this so\nthere is absolutely a mechanism of so\nlet's think\nabout what to add okay so the first\nthing is that this\npattern increases the energy in the\nmind to the point where it's probably\noverwhelming but your mind is never\nchill right your mind is never bored if\nyou look at\nthis there may be some kind of like\nexistential boredness but there is not\nnot a boredness in the moment right so\nyou're so you you've gotten so good at\nyour inner monologue and and\nconstructing things in your mind that\nyou're not bored your mind is occupied\nexistentially you're bored you're not\n[Â __Â ] doing anything all day so like\ngenerally speaking you feel bored but in\nyour mind in the absence of these\nexternal stimuli your mind has created\nthis internal\nstimulus okay there's always energy in\nthe mind because it's you figured out\nyour infinite money glitch of\nthoughts there's negative\nemotions and then then your mind\ncopes and the next thing that we kind of\nthink about is that as our experience\ndecreases okay then we become more\nincapable and as we become more\nincapable we are left with a\nchoice and this is the this is the real\ntrag of this so I want youall to think\nabout for a second what it's like to be\nthis person okay if you're not this\nperson\nso see if you believe that you're\nalready too far behind and that you\ncan't accomplish anything in life what\nare you left with so the thought of not\naccomplishing anything means that you\nfeel terrible about yourself yada yada\nyada and you can't fix the problem so\nthen your brain looks at this situation\nand says okay it's impossible to get a\ngirlfriend so what we're going to do\ninstead is we're going to do the best\nthat we can so we'll create this\nartificial life that will be like a\nshadow of the thing right we can't get\nthe object itself but we can get a\nshadow of it and that's the best that we\ncan do so internally subconsciously your\nbrain is just doing what you want it to\nit's trying to work for you and if\nyou've decided that you can't actually\ndo\nanything then what it's going to do is\ncreate imagination of those things and\nlet's take a quick look at another\nexample of that okay so imagine success\nto cope instead of actually achieving it\nright has no interest in any career just\nwants to think and this is the most\ndamning of them all things are always\nbetter in my head so let's understand\nthat this is what really keeps people\nstuck because things are better in your\nhead right so when you think about okay\nI'm going to go to a party and I'm going\nto talk to people and like I'm going to\ncrack some jokes and you sit down and\nyou think about how all the jokes are\ngoing to go and you map them out and you\nfigure everything out and then you show\nup at the party and then you're in the\nmiddle of telling your joke and you joke\nand you cough a little bit you choke on\nyour drink you end up spewing your drink\nall over this person in front of you and\nshe's pretty cute and then everyone's\nlike ew then you're like\n[Â __Â ] and then your brain is like okay\nwell I guess that's never going to work\nso why bother let's instead let's cuz it\nfeels good right when you're thinking\nabout how everything is going to play\nout and you're like oh my God I'm going\nto crack this joke and everyone's going\nto laugh and then someone's going to\nfall in love with me and then I'm going\nto make out with someone and then your\nmind is like let's go and then while\nyou're lost in the fantasy you're lost\nin this emotional coping mechanism and\nthen when the reality hits then you're\nin big trouble because things don't go\nthe right way in the real world as they\ndo in your\nhead and so this is really really\ndevastating I'm going to just check in\nwith chat for a\nsecond okay hold on I can only see one\nchat all right so and and then then then\nthe problem is that this becomes true\nright this is not like theoretical at\nthis point now your mind has data\nbecause things are always better in your\nhead clearly right because in the head\nyou [Â __Â ] manufacture everything and\nthe reality of the situation is that the\nreal world kind of is difficult and\nthings don't go that way and so then you\nsort of feel like any time you engage\nwith the real world it's going to you're\ndoomed to failure and then the whole\ncycle repeats and you're kind of stuck\nin your\nhead the real tragedy about this\nsituation is that the 25-year-old\nthinker actually\nworks way harder than someone who is\nsuccessful this is the real tragedy they\nthink oh I'm lazy I'm not exerting any\neffort and those people out there are so\ndisciplined they actually work way\nharder I know it sounds kind of weird\nbut let me\nexplain see if we turn to physics this\nis quite the analogy but this is what\nI've seen in my clinical\nexperience so if we look at friction\nthere are two effic uh coefficients of\nfriction there's something called the\nstatic coefficient of friction in the\nkinetic coefficient of friction which\nmeans anytime you start moving something\nthe process of getting something moving\nis way harder than keeping it moving so\nusually the kinetic coefficient of\nfriction is lower than the static\ncoefficient of friction so if I'm trying\nto like push a box across the room\ngetting the box to start moving is the\nhardest part and then it moves on its\nown so if we look at life acceleration\nis what takes energy and this is true in\nphysics as well right f equals ma the\nforce exerted equals mass time\nacceleration velocity doesn't enter the\npicture at\nall very important to understand so at\nthe 25-year-old thinker what do they do\nthey start and they stop\nlet me try to go do something and then\nthey stop and they work themselves up\nthey push they push they push they push\nthey overcome that coefficient of static\nfriction and they get things moving but\ntheir velocity is not very good and they\nlook at other people who are moving\nalong very fast at high velocity and\nthey think to themselves oh my God I'm\nmoving at 1 kilometer per hour and this\nother person is moving at 60 kilm per\nhour there's no way in which I'll catch\nup and so then they slam on the\nbrakes which is also exerting energy\nso this is what I've seen as a\npsychiatrist the people who move forward\nin life it's not about catching up or\nfalling behind or anything like that\nit's simply about not\nquitting see I want you all to just\nthink about this for a second how far\nare you going to get if you're driving a\ncar and I slam on the gas and then slam\non the brakes and then slam on the gas\nand then slam on the brakes and then\nslam on the gas and then slam on the\nbrakes how far am I going to get\nand how much gas am I going to\nuse versus someone who starts slow just\ngentle pressure on the brakes I mean on\nthe on the on the accelerator right you\nstart to pick up a little bit of speed\nbut you're not pushing very\nhard this is the real tragedy of the\nThinker is that the Thinker actually\nexerts way more effort because even\ndoing a small thing requires so much\nenergy because the brain is telling you\noh you're not going to be good at this\nit's in my head life ends up sucking\nyada y y blah blah blah blah blah and\nthis is what I see in the people who are\nstuck and this is why I believe so you\nguys think like oh my God Dr K believes\nin everybody he has such a heart of gold\nthat he has faith in us and I'm so\n[Â __Â ] far behind I don't have faith in\nyou because of whatever positive\nwhatever the [Â __Â ] I have faith in you\nbecause of physics because if you start\naccelerating the same laws of physics\napply to you as everybody else in the UN\nUniverse the same laws of psychology\napply to you as everybody else this is\nhow I'm able to I feel personally\nattacked and oh my God this is me and\nwhatever like why do you do you guys\nthink I'm actually telepathic you think\nbecause people may even watching this 30\ndays from now and they're like oh my God\nthis is me do you think I am so amazing\nthat I telepathically read your mind in\nthe future 30 days from now and I have\nsuch amazing Insight oh my God look at\nthis guy's [Â __Â ] psychic how is this\nguy stretching across time and space to\nread my mind oh my\nGod no no come on\nchat that's not I'm not psychic it's\njust the [Â __Â ] the mind and our brains\nadhere to\nprinciples and if you understand these\nprinciples then you can fix your life\nthe reason that y'all are stuck the\nreason that the 25-year-old thinker is\nstuck is because they have all kinds of\nerroneous conclusions and they have a\nmind that is not working for\nthem if you have a car without a\nsteering wheel it's [Â __Â ] or the\nsteering wheel turns whatever the [Â __Â ]\nway it wants to go which is literally\nwhat happens in a 25-year-old thinker\nright today it wakes up and we're like\nhard right turn let's go slam the gas\nlet's let's pump the Nitro hard right\nturn and then tomorrow you wake up and\nyou're like let's slam the brakes and\nhard left turn you start you stop you go\nOne Direction you go the other direction\nand then what does the Mind conclude the\nMind concludes this [Â __Â ] doesn't work so\ninstead what I'm going to do I'm going\nto sit on my ass and I'm going to think\nabout imaginary things\nbecause when you think imaginary\nthings then you control the laws of\nphysics that's the whole [Â __Â ] that's\nthe advantage of imagination like you\nget to control both sides you get to ask\nsomeone out and they get to say my God\neven though I'm dating someone I I need\nyou I'm so torn because I really love\nyou but I'm in this relationship with so\nand you're like oh my God yeah that'd be\ngreat you get to control both sides like\nwhat the [Â __Â ] so it doesn't obey the\nlaws of physics\nand we get stuck in this\ncrap so how do we overcome\nthis first thing is don't\nquit just don't quit there's one thing\nto understand which is that in this part\nyour mind is really really going to\ndislike\nit because the mind now think about what\nit's got It's got a very refined it's\nleveled up it's imagination capability\nyou're level 100 at the imagination\nskill and so the mind anytime you go to\nreality this is the whole [Â __Â ]\nproblem right is you go into reality and\nthings are always better in my\nhead so there is a very subtle Point\nhere but as long as you are expecting\nthings to be as good as in your head\nit's never going to work so\ninterestingly enough what a thinker\nneeds to do the first thing they need to\ndo is take the L you have to acknowledge\nthat for some amount of time this is\ngoing to be\nbruising this is going to be rough\nbecause remember that real progress\ncomes through thinking and experience\nand then unless you are\npracticed which by the way and we'll get\nto practice in a second unless you are\npractice things aren't going to go well\nso I can imagine myself doing a backflip\nbut if I Tred to do a bat flip but my\nbody didn't flip the way I I imagined it\nso how do you bridge the gap between\nwhat you think and what reality is how\ncan you make reality what you think\npractice\nliterally practice practice practice\npractice practice and now we see why\nthere is such a gap between thought and\nreality for these people because they\nnever experience they never actually do\nthey're never actually practicing and so\nit becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy\nthe one thing that they need to make\ntheir imagination a reality is\nexperience experience is the best thing\nfor them because they have none of it\nand experience will do a couple of\nthings the first thing it'll do is it'll\nactually make you better and then your\nperformance will closer approximate what\ngoes on in your head the second thing\nthat'll happen is that as you gain\nexperience the inputs of information\nyour axioms will\nchange see the reason that you feel so\nemotionally bad when you're a\n25-year-old thinker is you have this\nidea of what you should be but this is\nTheory crafting it's not\ndata and so the other way to move\nforward what is the best way to to\ndisabuse someone who is Theory crafting\nin a game hey bro if you think it\n[Â __Â ] works ceue up and show us right\nget to Grandmas or Champion or\nChallenger or Immortal or whatever the\n[Â __Â ] Divine\nwhatever Chad mode\nsandes whatever whatever rank you want\nthe proof is in the pudding and what\nhappens when Theory Crafters start\nentering the real world with their\nTheory crafted wonderfulness they get a\nreality check and then they moderate\ntheir expectations and this is the\nreally beautiful thing see people who\nare 25y old thinkers think\nthat what they really need to do is live\nup to their expectations that's not what\nyou need to do what you need to do is\ndemolish your\nexpectations because just think for a\nsecond if you had no expectations no\nburden of being behind no idea of what\nan imaginary relationship ship could be\nif you could annihilate all of that and\nyou could\nactually start over right you can do\nthat today you can start over today but\nthe starting over that you need to do is\nnot going back in time it's to\nannihilate all these [Â __Â ] Castles in\nthe Sky that you built and actually\nstart living\nlife and then something beautiful\nhappens see once you annihilate your\nexpectations and you're getting your\ninputs from experience then the gap\nbetween imagination and reality\nshrinks think about\nthat see the pain of the world is not\nthat the way that the world is the pain\nof the world is your imagination about\nthe world what the world should be and\nthe reality of what the world\nis this is this is the challenge in the\nworld see once we annihilate our\nexpectations and then we see the world\nas it is then we can proceive forward\nand this is where if you're not careful\nyou're going to get blackpilled and\nyou're like what are you saying that the\nworld is all a piece of [Â __Â ] no because\nthat's an expectation that is born of\nyour mind you'll discover quite the\nopposite that the world is actually a\npretty decent\nplace so be\ncareful so the real tragedy of\n25-year-old thinkers is that the very\nthings that they use as solutions to\ntheir problems are not the solutions\nthat's actually what propagates the\nproblem and even they have some hint of\nthat right because I think over here\nthere's all this kind of stuff about\nanalysis\nparalysis and then like you know there's\nall they sort of figure out that things\nare always better in my head and yet\nthey never they never leave their\nhead this just creates a huge\nproblem so step number one start\nexperiencing give yourself data instead\nof theory crafting step number two stop\nslamming on the gas and slamming on the\nbrakes and I will bet you that if you're\na 25-year-old thinker you do this you\nknow you do this the frequency of it may\ndecrease but you do this you'll get\nreally excited about something you'll\ntry something right because this is not\nworking even with your 250 IQ you\nrecognize that this is not sustainable\nso you try to go out into the real world\nand when you do that you end up quitting\nslamming on the because how hard is it\nto go on the into the real world very\ndifficult you have to push that gas a\nlot\nand very easy to slam on the\nbrakes so don't\nquit and the last\nthing is be careful this is the hardest\none be careful about what which things\nfeed the mind so anytime you have a\nthought or a line of thinking that leads\nto more thought or line of thinking that\nis the wrong way to think this is\nliterally what we have here see they\nhave the\nobservations analysis\nparalysis what is analysis paralysis it\nis thought that leads to more\nthought you think down this way but that\ndoesn't work so I'm going to think down\nthis way and that doesn't work so I\ndon't actually act and as long as I\ndon't act my mind continues to think you\nsee it's it's the infinite money glitch\nagain the moment that I act there's\nresolution and then I don't get to play\nwith the problem\nanymore the game's\nover so so in your life cultivate things\nthat lead to a resolution of thought not\njust an annihilation of thought I'm not\nsaying go get high and get lost in\nOblivion resolution of thought and then\nyou may discover something but I don't\nknow how to resolve my thoughts because\nthere is no answer oh interesting maybe\nyou should just try something just do\nsomething get more\ndata because the data set that you have\nyou can't solve this\nequation right it's yxal AB you don't\nhave enough data but [Â __Â ] 25-year-old\nthinkers will keep on playing around\nwith it y = a / x yxal a uh YX over a =\nb YX over b equals a and they keep on\nlike moving around the the numbers\naround trying to figure out okay like YX\ndivided by AB equals\n1 okay that's interesting right and\ny'all keep on playing around with it and\nyou just don't have enough data so then\nyou don't live in the world because\nyou're scared of it and emotions and all\nthe other\nstuff so look at the things that lead to\nresolution of thought and then do those\nthings and once you have resolution of\nthought followed by resolution of\nthought followed by resolution of\nthought you will have nothing left to\nthink about and you will be done being a\n25-year-old\nthinker\nquestions\n[Music]\noh\ninteresting\nokay you lost me in there somewhere it\nhappens from time to time it's more\nabout me than it is about\nyou\nyeah so someone's asking can you give us\nan example of annihilation versus\nresolution of thought please sure so\nI'll give you a simple\nexample okay let's say I don't know\nwhere my keys\nare so I can hypothesize about where my\nkeys are as much as I\nwant I can get so frustrated about where\nmy keys are and then I can decide to\njust obliviate my thoughts by queuing up\nfor a video game and because in that\nhour that I'm playing the video game I'm\nnot thinking about where my keys\nare but the moment that I stop playing\nthe video game the thoughts return so\nwhen you change your internal state to\nget rid of thoughts the thoughts are\njust waiting to come back they don't\nreally go away they just get put on\npause so resolution of the thought is to\nfind the keys because then there's no\nthought\nleft so most resolution of thought or\nnot most some of it comes from action\nbut some of it also comes from\nacceptance so if I'm like oh my God like\nlet's say I'm I I want to I need to tell\nmy partner that this relationship is not\nworking for me it's not that I want to\nbreak up but that I'm unhappy in the\nrelationship let's say you're faced with\nthis problem and so what people will do\nis they'll run through all kinds of\nscenarios in their\nhead if I say this and then they could\nbe upset and then they could be upset\nand then how do I how do I say this to\nthem without making them upset see\nthat's where the problem is see the\nmoment that your mind says I want this\noutcome without someone being\nupset how do I make a million dollars\nwithout spending any\neffort how do I break the news without\nhurting their\nfeelings so if you're really careful\nthis is what paralyzes us anytime our\nmind is unwilling to accept the\nconsequences of our actions your mind\nwill be paralyzed\nand you can you can find this very very\nvery easily just pay attention to your\nthoughts that are dodging a consequence\nyou're looking for some kind of\nperfection how do I do this without\nthis doing this oh that's that's not\nhard but I want to do it without this\nother thing how do I break the news to\nthem without hurting their feelings I'm\nnot saying going around being an [Â __Â ]\nbut I'm saying that you can't\nnecessarily control the feelings of\nanother person I'm not saying that you\nshould act without compassion\nand so if you pay attention to your mind\nall these caveats that you add in your\nown thinking you can literally write\ndown your thoughts and you'll see this\nall the\ntime then what you have to do is accept\nthat that's a potential consequence and\nthen you have to decide okay if I want\nto act this could\nhappen right so someone I I recently\nwrote a book Joe should really check out\nit's a good book teaches you how to talk\nto people bonus if you've got Young kids\nor nieces or nephews because it also\nteaches you how to teach them healthy\nvideo game\nhabits but really it's the best guide to\ncommunication that I've written so far\nand all the communication stuff works\nfor just about any\nrelationship I wrote this book and\nsomeone asked me the question as it was\nabout to be released are you nervous and\nI said no and they were surprised by\nthat they were like what if it doesn't\ndo\nwell I was like then it doesn't do well\nsee if I was worried the right time to\nbe worried about whether the book does\nwell or not is when I'm writing\nit after it's written that ship is\nsailed right so the moment that I\ndecided to write a book I opened myself\nup to the consequence of writing a\nshitty\nbook if you want to avoid writing a\nshitty book 100% the best way to do it\nis not right one oh\nshocking look at what we did\nwe chose not to write\none see the only way to truly protect\nyourself from failure is to never\ntry see I'm going to tell yall something\npretty wild okay I have a 0% loss rate\nin Street Fighter\n6 I have a 0% loss rate in Minecraft I\nhave a 0% loss rate I've never lost a\ngame of csgo\nnever not a single game 0% loss rate\nthis is what happens when you're the\n25-year-old\nthinker you're shooting for that\nPerfection but that's not something you\ncan get so the moment that you act you\nopen yourself up to failure and you just\naccept that right then you try to do\neverything that you\ncan to make it as successful as possible\nnot everything that you can everything\nthat you're willing to do because I\ncould have made the book better if I was\nwilling to make sacrifices but I made\nsacrifices so\nit\nokay and so this is the resolution of\nthought comes through\nacceptance so you just accept Okay I'm\ngoing to try to say this in As Nice of a\nway that as I as I can\nbut feelings may be hurt right so the\nmoment that you started dating someone\nis the moment that both of y'all opened\nyourself up to particular feelings being\nhurt right so once you board the ship\nthe waves can be\nchoppy you know the big irony about my\nmy gaming\naccolades the real big irony about my\ngaming accolades is the more time I\nspend playing a game the worse my win\nrate is\n[Music]\num\nso Lou goas I don't know how to\npronounce that thanks Dr K I actually\nused to think like that a few years ago\nwhen I first started watching your\ncontent I still do it today I'll be it\nway less as I keep rolling with the\npunch and adapting live I love what you\ndoing that's perfect right rolling with\nthe punches is such a great way to put\nit you can't stop the punch the best you\ncan do is roll with it and 25-year-old\nthinkers are the ones who are never\nstepping into the ring because they're\nafraid that they can't Dodge 100% of\npunches and that's also why they look\nfor the perfect\nsolution see when there's a big gap\nbetween your imagination and reality all\nyou need to bridge that Gap is\nperfection if you can be perfect then\nthe imagination reality will be one and\nthe same and if you're striving for\nPerfection you'll always be stuck in\nanalysis paralysis because I I haven't\nseen\nPerfection or you can go the hard yogic\nmeditation Buddhist route and say that\nall of reality is perfection you see how\nthey did that everything is perfect just\nthe way that it is the world is what it\nis and that is all there is decrease\ntheir expectations creates\nPerfection it's pretty cool they figured\nthis stuff out as did as did the 25y old\nthinker\nokay\nokay this is a good question why would\nwe go out and gather more data when our\npast experiences of going out and data\nGathering have been mostly bad what a\ngreat great great\nquestion see if you've had bad\nexperiences this is very important about\nGathering data often times the mistake\nthat we make is we're not critical in\nthe Way That We Gather the\ndata so sometimes I work with people who\nare alpha\nmales and alpha males have this belief\nI'm not saying that it's right or wrong\nI'm just sort of sharing this\nperspective that women are only\ninterested in money or whatever that\nthey're interested in a man's money or\npenis or whatever I don't even\nknow and so they think that\nrelationships are\ntransactional so then what happens is\nthey go go and they enter the dating\nworld and they view relationships\nsubconsciously and consciously as\ntransactional right so if the girl says\nhey where are you going to take me out\nand he's like if I'm going to pay $300 I\nbetter be getting something in return\nright so you say these kinds of things\nyou're transparent you're clear with\npeople and then one of two things happen\nso if the partner that you're dating or\nthe person that you're going on a date\nwith also views relationships as\ntransactional that's totally fine right\nthey understand how things work they\nview relationships as the same way so\nlike sure if you're going to pay $300\nwe'll see what you get haaha wink wink\nwink nudge nudge nudge eggplant\nPeach right and then there are people\nwho don't view relationships as\ntransactional and they're not interested\nin engaging a relationship with this\nperson because this person is interested\nin transactional relationships so now\nwhat you've done is create a selection\nbias in your data and you've created a\nself-fulfilling prophecy and as you go\nout and collect more and more Del data\nif you believe that relationships are\ntransactional you will find only\ntransactional\nrelationships so big problem that we\nhave about data Gathering is that we\nbelieve that the data that we collect is\nobjective but it's not there are even\nstudies that show that when you are\ntraumatized today your hippocampus which\nis where your memories live will go into\nedit mode and it will change all of your\nmemories in the past traumatic\nexperiences to today will literally\nrewire your memories in the\npast so one of the things to understand\nis that the data collection that we have\nis often times biased and we know this\nso we know for example like people who\nhave\nanxiety tend to interpret ambiguous\nstimuli as\nnegative so what happens in anxiety is\nthe way that you color the data makes\nyou more anxious and like oh this person\ndoesn't especially in in social anxiety\nso neutral stimuli in in the mind of\nsomeone who's socially anxious will be\ninterpreted in a negative way so let's\nsay that we we want to break social\ninteractions into 30% 33% positive 33%\nneutral and 33% negative this is what\nthe actual reality is no one someone is\nunhappy 33% of the time they're happy\nwith you 33% of the time and 33% of time\nthey're neutral so in the mind of\nsomeone who's socially anxious they\ninterpret this as 66% negative the\nmajority of negative so one of the most\nunder\ndeveloped skills we have is refining our\nperception this is why we talk about\n[Music]\nprara in like the ADHD guide like we're\nnot good at interpreting our data and\nreally seeing the data as what it is\nthis is why we see this on the internet\nall the time everyone is 100% sure\nthey're correct and they're sure that\nthe other person who's 100% correct\ncorrect is 100%\nwrong and they get really confused how\ncan someone be so stupid so you see this\na lot in\npolitics where two sides of a political\nSpectrum will think that the other one\nis objectively\nstupid how can you look at this world\nand believe what you believe the only op\nchance is that you're stupid that's the\nonly thing that explains it no it's\nbecause we are interpreting the data in\ndifferent\nways right we're working with the same\ndata set but I'm leaving half of it out\nand you're leaving half of it out and\nthen this is how we get this\nway so I don't dispute that the data\nthat you've collected makes you view\nthings negatively and it's not that\nthose bad things didn't happen I'm not\nsaying they didn't happen I'm saying\nthat there is a more refined way to\ncollect data in in my experience as a\nclinician as people start working on\nthis generally speaking they move in a\nvery positive way so I'd say like 95 to\n9 97% of the time people will like this\nwill be positive and you can change your\ndata collection\nmethods okay let's move on because we've\ngot more\nstuff\nokay all right\nso this is a good one let's take a look\nat the cycle of social\nanxiety so needs social interaction\ninteracts with people gets overwhelmed\nisolates gets lost in own thoughts\noverthinks and then needs social\ninteraction\nagain so people look at\nthis and they think oh my God this is\nsuch a hard cycle to break right and\nwhat we're going to do today is we're\ngoing to teach you how to break this\ncycle we're going to show you how to\nbreak it in many places so the first\nthing to understand is that when we look\nat a cycle we tend to think that this is\nvery hard to\nmanage right it's a cycle it feeds\nitself here's the cool thing about a\ncycle so if I have this\ncycle and ask yall a\nquestion which of these steps\ndo I need to stop to break the\ncycle what do yall\nthink see the cool thing about a cycle\npeople think that Cycles are really hard\nto break but they're very easy to break\nCU all you need to do to break a cycle\nof six steps is break one of the steps\nthat's the joy of a cycle is that it's\nvulnerable in many different places see\nif I want to get a car to stop\nmoving I can just take out any random\npiece I can take out the ax I can take\nout the steering wheel I can take out\nthe accelerator I can take out a piece\nof the engine I can take out all kinds\nof I can remove the gas\ntank right this is the crazy thing\nCycles feel overwhelming but they're\nactually the easiest things to break so\nwhat we're going to do today is go\nthrough each of these steps and teach\nyou how to break them one at a time and\nthen the beautiful thing is you don't\neven have to completely break one you\ncan do each of these 10% and the will\nget cut down by 75 80\n90% okay so there's going to be some\nweird stuff in here right number\none\nneeds social\ninteraction\nso this is going to be very\nstrange what is the best antidote to\nneeding social interaction so a lot of\npeople may think if I need social\ninteraction the best antidote is social\ninteraction but this is not true so I'll\nexplain to youall why so when you need\nsocial\ninteraction and you go to socially\ninteract what\nhappens gets\noverwhelmed right so I know it sounds\nkind of weird but the antidote to social\ninter needing social interaction is not\nsocial interaction because when you\napproach the social interaction you are\nfull of needs and let's remember when\nsomeone says need social interaction\nthey don't say want social interaction\nor could be better with a little bit of\nsocial interaction these people wait\nuntil they're hungry for\nit so I want yall to understand\nthis see who do you think is better at\ngetting into a relationship someone who\nhas never been in a relationship before\nand craves a relationship and needs a\nrelationship and oh my God I need it\nI've been alone for so long it\nhurts or someone who broke up with\nsomeone about a year ago has been kind\nof like on their own and it's kind of\nlike oh maybe like now is time for me to\nget back into a\nrelationship okay so as you add needs in\nemotional desperation to the equation it\nactually sabotages your social\ninteraction so how do we reduce our need\nfor social interaction I see it in chat\ngood job someone has been paying\nattention because we have a video about\nit\nSolitude now this may be confusing as\nall hell you're like what broh but I'm\nisolated all the time so we're going to\nteach y'all a couple of crazy\nthings so Solitude is enjoying or\nappreciating being with\nyourself now this is not the same you\nmay say but I'm alone all the time I'm\nalone all the time I'm lonely I'm alone\nisn't that the same no Solitude and\nloneliness even though the objective\nsituation is the same the subjective\nexperience is quite different so even if\nyou're someone who is alone all day\nlet's say you're awake for 16 hours of\nthe day even engaging in two hours of\nsolitude will change the way that you\nview your life because instead of 16\nhours of loneliness now you have 14\nhours of\nloneliness so so what is Solitude is to\nbe with oneself and there are studies on\nthis that Solitude is protective against\nloneliness right so spending time with\nyourself when you're in solitude you're\nnot alone you're with yourself and then\npeople may get super confused then don't\nworry that's why we're going to get to\nthe other five parts of the the thing\nbut if youall really want to know like\nwhat is an antidote it is this so as you\nspend time with yourself as you\nacknowledge okay instead of being alone\nfor 16 hours of the day let's remove the\npossibility of social interaction from 4\nhours of the day I'm going to wake up\ntoday I'll worry about socialization\nafteron but between 8: a.m. andon I'm\ngoing to be by myself I'm going to focus\non my [Â __Â ] I'm going to enjoy being by\nmyself I need to do this this and this\nI'm going to take care of that\nstuff so when you do that the first\nthing that you do is you reduce your\nneed for social interaction from 16\nhours to 12 hours that in turn makes it\neasier for you to engage with other\npeople because you're not quite as\ndesperate you're not quite as starved\ncrazy I\nknow the second principle that we're\ngoing to talk\nabout is one of active challenges and\npassive challenges which we'll get to a\nlittle bit later but I want to touch on\nit\nhere see when a human being chooses to\ndo something it hurts less when a human\nbeing is forced into doing something it\nhurts way more so if you literally look\nat studies on\nanxiety what we know is that the degree\nof anxiety that you experience is the\nnumber the ratio of active\nchallenges to passive\nchallenges or this is also feeling\noverwhelmed so we're kind of jumping\nahead a little bit to this and we'll\ntalk about how to do this a little bit\nlater but this is a very important\nprinciple to understand see when we feel\nso passive challenges are things\nchallenges that are\nthrown our\nway and active challenges are\nchallenges that we\nchoose so if you look at people who are\noverwhelmed they're like oh my God this\nthing is going wrong and this thing is\ngoing wrong and this thing is going\nwrong and they think that the solution\nto their problems is to fix those\nproblems and since they're so\noverwhelmed they don't have the\nbandwidth to take anything on they can't\nchoose a challenge they can't choose a\ndirection for growth and literally what\nwe know is that the more things the the\nmore that you're getting bodied by RNG\nnegative events in your life the more\npassive challenges you are the more\nyou'll be overwhelmed and the flip side\nyou may have noticed that there are some\npeople who have a lot of [Â __Â ] going\non right maybe they have families and\nmaybe they're working hard and they're\ndoing extracurriculars and they're\nlearning how to whatever and then like\nbad [Â __Â ] happens in they life in their\nlife and it's stressful but they handle\nit and we're like how are these\nsuperhuman beings able to do this on top\nof raising kids and having a career they\nalso have breast cancer like what the\n[Â __Â ] how do they do this cuz some of us\nare just getting bodied by random [Â __Â ]\nin life and it is because of\nthis\nsee\nquitting and getting fired is the same\nat the end of the day there is no\njob but this feels very\ndifferent very very very very very\ndifferent see need social isolation uh\ninteraction you're alone here you're\nalone too but this is the same\ndifference as quitting and being fired\none is your choice and when you when you\nmake a\nchoice what is it to be overwhelmed\noverwhelmed is not having choice not\nbeing able to handle what happened so\nthe more choices you make the less\noverwhelmed you will be and so what we\nwant to do is choose to be solitary for\nsome amount of time every day and then\nyou can be lonely for the rest of it the\ngood news is that even if we can reduce\nyour need by\n20% that will improve everything else\ndown the\ncycle so now let's talk about\ninteracting with\npeople\nokay all\nright so let's talk about interacting\nwith people so the first thing is that\nthe more baggage you bring to the\nequation\nthe harder is going to be to interact\nwith people so like people can tell when\nyou're desperate for social\ninteraction and so like it makes things\nway harder so if we can reduce our need\nfor social interaction by\n20% that will help a lot the other thing\nthat we really want to do is emotional\ndecompression okay and if we can\ndecompress some of our emotions if we're\nnot some bundle of nerves or bundle of\ndesperation it'll smooth out our\ninteractions we'll be a little bit\ncalmer when we interact with people and\nI'm going to kind of combine these two\npoints so let's talk about getting\noverwhelmed okay so when we get\noverwhelmed let's understand what's\ngoing\non so we have this part of our brain\ncalled the thalamus and the thalamus is\nthe\ngateway to the\nbrain so what does this\nmean so we have eyes we have a mouth we\nhave ears we have a\nnose and then we\nhave\nfingers toes Etc so all of these are\nsensory inputs and they all\ngo to the\nthalamus so the thalamus is like hey\nbraah like I'm going to be the entry\npoint I am basically the customs and\nimmigration for the\nbrain\nand then what happens is the thalamus\ndecides what information to relay up to\nour\ncortices and what information doesn't\nbelong and then the thalamus also\nconnects to our emotional circuitry and\nthis becomes kind of important to\nunderstand so let me explain this so if\nyou walk into a\nroom and you can feel the tension in the\nair this happens very very quickly so\nwhat's going on when you feel the\ntension if I ask you you walk into a\nroom 2 seconds after you walk into the\nroom you feel the tension in the air and\nthen I ask you why do you feel tense\nwhat's your answer going to be I have no\n[Â __Â ]\nidea I feel tense something's going on\nsomething's up I can feel it we're like\nWhat do you feel what tell me what are\nyou actually experiencing they're like I\ndon't know I can just feel it so what's\ngoing on there what's going on there is\nwe have sensory input that's going to\nthe thalamus and activates the emotional\ncircuitry without thought and analysis\nor any of this stuff up here because\nthis happens super fast they're like\nright next to each other okay so our\nemotions activate before our thoughts\ncan catch up your emotions can get\nhalfway across the world before your\nthoughts have put on their shoes Lac\ntheir boots in the words of Terry\npratchet\nokay so what this means when we get\noverwhelmed is when we\nare when we have less social interaction\nwe get socially\nRusty so remember that the mind doesn't\nwear out the Mind\nrusts so learning a new skill like\nplaying the piano at the age of 70 is\nprotective against demena so if you look\nat your muscles what decondition your\nmuscles what decondition your muscles is\nlack of use not using them the more that\nyou use them the stronger they're going\nto get and our brain is the same way so\nwhen we are socially isolated our social\ncircuitry becomes Rusty as our social\ncircuitry becomes Rusty we are not able\nto\ndetect\nreassuring\nstimuli so if you look at people who\ndevelop dementia why do people with\ndementia get paranoid instead of\nfriendly so our brain literally has the\nthis is kind of hard to understand but\nlike I'm going to do my best to explain\nit because it's like important okay so\nwe're going to talk about\nNeuroscience so I want yall to imagine\nthat you are designing an\norganism and if the organism is\nimpaired do you want trust to remain\nintact or do you want paranoia to remain\nintact which one do you think will lead\nto more\nsurvival so what we tend to find is that\nparanoia and fear are our most basic\nprimitive Reptilian Brain\nfeelings they are controlled by these\nhigher order human feelings like\ncompassion and\ntrust and so literally what happens in\npeople who have dementia their brain is\ndecaying and as the brain starts to\nmalfunction the most basic circuitry\nlike like the bones of the brain which\nwe want to protect at all cost those\nbecome\nactive they've always been active but\nthey're no longer suppressed by the\nother parts of our circuitry so the\ndanger circuitry is very primitive like\nreptiles have the same amydala that we\nhave so the threat detection is\nParamount if a brain loses the ability\nto detect threat we're\nscrewed so when the brain becomes\nRusty we lose our ability to be\nreassured our Thalamus\nbecomes kind of funky and then we\nliterally get overwhelmed with sensory\nstimuli you're sitting there people are\nsaying things you're not able to follow\nthe conversation you're in your own head\nand then what happens is this cognition\nkicks in let me show youall\nokay so now we're going to actually jump\nto this thing hold\non so now we jump over\nhere where when we get overwhelmed we\nget lost in our\nthoughts okay and why is this it's\nbecause there's too much sensory\nstimulus like we don't know who's saying\nwhat when am I supposed to speak is it\ntoo late to add my point now all this\nkind of crap happens so instead of\nengaging with the actual people we are\nlike caught up in our own thoughts and\nwe're playing some [Â __Â ] calculation\nit's like you have a director's cut have\nyou guys ever heard this director's cut\naudio description for like a movie that\nyou watch it's like the movie is playing\nand then some [Â __Â ] guy or girl is\nlike talking over it and the only reason\nthat people watch the director's cut is\nbecause they already know what happens\nin the movie but when you have like\nsocial anxiety you have the director's\ncut playing in your head and then you\ncan't understand what the [Â __Â ] movie\nis saying because there's like someone\nelse talking over\nit this is what happens and we get\ncaught over here and when you watch a\nmovie with a director's cut who is\neasier to pay attention to the actual\nmovie or the director's cut the\ndirector's\ncut so we get over stimulation of the\nthalamus and then when the thalamus is\noverly stimulated because we've got way\ntoo much sensory\ninput right all this crap is way too\nmuch aralis is like whoa whoa buddy like\nI don't know how to do this because\nremember we're Rusty so we can't process\nall that information so it's like let's\npeace\nout and then we end up\nisolating then we get lost in our own\nthoughts the other challenge that we\nhave when we get lost in our own\nthoughts is when we are absorbed with\nourself okay now we're in solitude with\nother people and now this creates\nanother host of\nproblems\nokay\nis when we get lost in our own thoughts\nwe're not engaged in\nempathy because we are interacting with\nourselves we are paying attention to\nourselves and without empathy we get no\nreassurance from other\npeople and then what we end up doing is\ncognitively trying to like understand\nwhat's going on and then we're playing\nlike some 5D chess in our heads about\nhow to interact with other human beings\nbut when we're playing 5D chess in order\nto interact with other human beings this\nis where we get to overthink we don't\nconnect with other human beings we can't\nbe chill we can't\nrelax right because we're like making\nmoves and the whole point point of like\nsocial interactions is that they should\nbe fluid and fun we should be vibing but\nwhen you are overthinking you are\ndefinitely not\nvibing and in order to Vibe with someone\nelse you need to externalize your\nattention you need to pay attention to\nthem so what we want to do in this\nsituation is actually try to enjoy what\nis going\non right who cares about I mean you do\nand I know it's\nhard you know I\nthe the point of the point is to enjoy\nsocial interaction you don't have to say\nanything right but then this is the\nproblem with with social anxiety is that\nwe're worried that if we don't say\nanything then people won't like us but\nyou can just listen to a conversation\nand there's studies that also show that\nbasically the problem in social anxiety\nis that we grossly overestimate the\nnegative costs of social interaction so\nwhat does that mean so let's talk about\nsocial anxiety for just one\nsecond\noverestimate\ncosts of social\ninteraction so what this means is if I'm\nsilent what is the cost of that the\nactual cost of that is nothing how many\nconversations have you been a part of\nwhere like over a 5 minute period no one\nhas said anything it was just listening\nare you like [Â __Â ] that guy particularly\nor [Â __Â ] that girl girl she's awful she\nhasn't said anything in 5 minutes oh my\nGod they're such P's we don't think like\nthat right but if you've got social\nanxiety you think silence you estimate\nthe cost as really\nbad they will\nthink I don't like\nthem right and everyone's usually too\nsocially anxious to be worried about you\nanyway they're stuck their own\nheads\nso what we want to try to do is enjoy\nthings try to just be present for the\ninteraction so now let's get to\nSolutions so if you're stuck with this\nwhat do you\ndo\nokay\nso I'm going to teach yall a couple of\nthings\nokay all right so let's start\nwith need social interaction\nstep number one is\nSolitude right so try to reduce your\nneed by 10 to 20% just be with yourself\ntry to enjoy being with yourself for a\ncouple hours of the day you can be\nlonely the rest of the day all right\nsecond thing to\ndo just look at this okay so this will\nmake it easier for you to interact with\npeople because you'll be less desperate\nbut then when we talk about overwhelmed\nI'm going to teach youall a cool\ntrick remember there's this principle of\nactive and passive\nchallenges and if the passive is greater\nthen you're going to feel overwhelmed so\nif you're overwhelmed in a social\ninteraction what does that usually look\nlike this like there's too many people\nsaying things I don't have a chance to\nbreak into the conversation like I don't\nknow when I'm supposed to speak like\nthis doesn't feel good like everyone\nthinks I'm a bad person whatever loser\nokay so what I would strongly strongly\nstrongly recommend that you do is take\ncharge now this can feel\nterrifying to people who are socially\nanxious what do you mean take charge so\nI'm going to give youall a couple of\nphrases\nokay just just just think about just\nlisten to this okay you guys can just\nuse\nthese so let's say you're in a social\ninteraction where you're kind of\noverwhelmed and there's too many people\ntalking and stuff like that so let's say\nthere's six people talking and three of\nthem are participating in a\nconversation you can tap the person next\nto you who's not talking very much right\nbecause you're paying attention to some\nof the information you can say hey like\nit's kind of loud in here do you want to\nstep outside and chat just ask people\nhey you want to like step outside and\nfind someplace quieter to talk or you\ncan say like hey I noticed you're\nhalfway through your drink I was\nthinking about getting a second one you\nwant to walk over to the bar and grab\nsomething so usually what you want to do\nis invite someone targeted specific to\nsee if they want to do something and\nthen it's okay maybe you'll get rejected\noh my\nGod oh my God what if they reject me\nthat's okay right they say oh no I'm I'm\nactually good I'm not going to have more\nthan one you're like okay cool I'm going\nto go top myself off do you want me to\nbring you\nsomething that's like\nnon-alcoholic they're like no I'm good\ntotally fine right you're just being\nkind that's it you want to step outside\nit's loud in here because if you find\nsomeone else who's not talking very much\nthey may join\nyou the other thing you can do is like\nthis happens to me a lot where like I go\nto like these Indian\nweddings and then like you're in line\nfor food or you're at some conference\nand they serve\nlunch and then you can just ask people\nlike hey can I join\nyou I don't know many people here is it\nokay if I join\nyou or if someone is in line ahead of\nyou you can say like hey are you sitting\nis it okay if I join you or you can ask\nthem do you have a do are you planning\non sitting with someone otherwise we can\nfind a\nplace\neasy right so you want to here are the\ncomponents of it super casual you want\nto acknowledge that you don't\nnecessarily need them you want to offer\nsomething to\nthem right and I see there's all kinds\nof points in here\nabout you know hey you want to\nyou can always jerk\noff um you know it I wouldn't recommend\nyou say that come with me to a dark\nalley it's the point is that so there's\na couple of things the first is that\nwe're not taught how to do this like I\nhad to learn how to do this it was\nreally hard I learned this in college\nwhere I set out to like practice this\nkind of crap every single day just easy\nsocial\nskills and then the other thing that I\nsort of found is like even when I was\ngetting older and like I would go to\nthese conferences where I didn't know\nanyone I would sometimes sit\ndown and like I would eat by myself and\nthat's only painful if I don't engage in\nsolitude right so you sit down you look\nat the place you say okay I don't know\nanyone here or the people that I do know\nare sitting over there that table is\nfull um or the most mortifying thing is\nyou go over you see an empty chair and\nthen you ask hey is this chair taken and\nthey're like actually yes yes it is and\nthen you're like well [Â __Â ] me right\nyou're like okay cool and then you go\nand you sit by\nyourself and then you stop and think\nabout it for a second you realize like\nokay so now I get to eat a meal by\nmyself I get to think about I guess I'll\nuse this time to think about what I came\nto this conference for there all kinds\nof ways to engage in\nsolitude and often times what will\nhappen is someone will walk up to you\nand we'll say hey is it okay if I join\nyou and you can say\nsure okay so sometimes bad things will\nhappen\nbut this is the crazy thing is that like\nI don't think anyone has the time to\nthink about how big of a loser you are\nfor the next decade of their\nlife\nright so what you really want to do is\nwhen you're feeling overwhelmed take\ncontrol of the situation try to steer\nthe conversation in a particular\ndirection right if people are talking\nabout something you can kind of chime in\nor participate or you can alter the\ncourse or often times what you can do is\nfind someone else and just sort of use\nsome of these stock phrases hey it's\nkind of loud in here do you want to step\nout on the\nbalcony right so you can take control of\nthe conversation the cool thing is that\nthat'll alleviate your feeling of being\noverwhelmed and often times given the\nrising rate of social anxiety you will\nbe a boon to someone else so I want you\nall to flip it around let's say you're\noverwhelmed in a social situation and\nsomeone comes up to you and as like hey\nit's way too loud in here do you want to\nstep outside and like chat get some\nfresh air\nand like this is like throwing a\nLifeline to someone with social anxiety\nthey're like [Â __Â ] yes I do so much\nbetter in one-on-one conversations so\nyou're throwing a Lifeline to someone\nelse okay that's like literally what you\nsay\nokay and then in terms of overthinking\nand getting lost in your own\nthoughts remember that the more that you\ncan attend to what is going on actually\ntry to enjoy yourself don't worry about\nwhether you're socially good or bad try\nto be empathic and attune yourself to a\nparticular person enjoy yourself and the\nlast thing is I I know it's kind of\nweird but they have isolation\noh they have isolation down here but I\nthink isolation goes up\nhere this is really where isolation\ngoes and then there's one last thing\nthat you can do which is very important\nto understand\nthe last thing that you can do is not\nisolate so I want youall to think about\nthis\nokay see people who crave social\ninteraction muster up the\ncourage to go in and then feel\noverwhelmed and then end up isolating I\nknow y'all are saying just don't isolate\nhear me\nout hear me\nout people who crave social interaction\ngo socialize and then isolate are like\npeople who jump into a cold body of\nwater are like [Â __Â ] this is cold they\nget out and they're like oh my God and\nthen they jump back\nin oh my God it's cold you get out oh\ndry off let me jump back in this is what\nyall are doing instead of a\nclimatizing you repeat the worst part of\nthe cycle over and over and over again\njust stay in the water water and you'll\nfeel better but instead oh my God it's\nso cold you have to get out and then you\njump back in this is literally what\nhappens this is what y'all are doing not\nmetaphorically\nliterally I don't know what the word\nmeans think about it right you put\nyourself through this [Â __Â ] experience\nover and over and over\nagain and it's intolerable so you jump\nout and if you pay attention to the\ntimes when socialization is more\ntolerable there's a longer period of\ntime and this is where people make a\nmistake they think oh yeah the reason I\nhung out with those people 3 hours is\nbecause I was feeling less socially\nanxious I got along better with them but\nit's a chicken or the egg the reason\nthat you remember that interaction as\nbetter is because you didn't bow out\nafter 30 minutes of\ntorture so the last thing is to\nliterally not isolate and you may say oh\nmy God Dr K that's hard I know it's hard\nbut think about this principle so what I\nwould strongly recommend is if you\nreally feel like leaving and by the way\nbeing on your phone is another form of\nleaving don't be on your phone because\nbeing on your phone signals to other\npeople that you are not interested in\nengaging they are going to feel like\nthey are bothering you if you are on\nyour\nphone worst thing you can do in a social\nsituation is to be on your phone and\nthis is like obvious if you go on a date\nand someone is\nlike they're not engaged with you that's\n[Â __Â ] apparently happening nowadays\nwhere like people are going on dates and\ninstead of eating food they're just\ntaking pictures of it and uploading it\nand then\nlike that's me taking a picture in front\nof some imaginary food over\nhere okay so if you want to isolate\nafter 30 minutes give yourself 30\nminutes and while you're there for those\n30 minutes try to take charge of the\nsituation okay\nand it may feel awkward to walk up to a\ngroup of people who are already engaged\nin conversation so I'm going to give you\nall a little tip you walk\nup with\nFocus don't be\nlike don't walk like that okay you walk\nup you walk in and you say hey can I\njoin y'all smile not like hey can I join\ny'all just casual right so like hey\nwhat's up can I join y'all\npeople don't say no to that question and\nthen they will literally make space for\nyou and then you kind of join in that's\nall it takes simple things simple tiny\ntiny tiny tiny tiny\nphrases\nright\nquestions just walk up and hey or you\ncan walk up to people and say introduce\nyourself hey what's up I'm\nalo\nthat was so creepy yeah that's why I'm\nsaying don't do so okay for those of\nyall that are saying that's so [Â __Â ]\ncreepy are you doing that no therefore\nwhat you are doing is not creepy do you\nsee how we get to this whole this whole\nproblem with social anxiety is that our\ncost estimates are completely off and\nhere yall are thinking that what you're\ndoing is really bad because you're not\ntalking where is like I just showed you\nwhat really bad\nis Right hi there how are you all doing\ntoday do you mind if I join you it's\nkind of loud in here and hot and sweaty\nisn't it do you want to step outside\nwith\nme how about we find someplace quieter\nto\ntalk oh I see that you haven't had your\ndrink in a little while can I get you a\ndrink\nI can go no you don't need to get it for\nyourself I'll get it for\nyou allow\nme okay so look if y'all don't [Â __Â ]\ndo that you're not creepy that's creepy\nlike we can see what creepy\nis okay y'all\nright right sweating right me too it's\nhot in here oh my goodness it's so oh\nhot why the southern\naccent okay so we can do the southern\naccent hey do y'all mind if I join\ny'all see that's not\ncreepy I was going to top myself off you\nwant\none kind of loud in here you want to\nstep outside it's all it's not the\naccent right so like look I know that\npeople are socially anxious but y'all\naren't this screwed up okay you don't\nactually do that so it's\nokay Dr K theater kid you know I was\noffered a career as a Bollywood film\nstar when I was like 23 or\nsomething I turned it down that would\nhave been a different life different\nlife indeed\nsomeone someone literally asked offered\nme a role in a b or c tier Bollywood\nfilm this is when I was gallivanting\nIndia and around\nIndia and it's weird how things happen\nbut the road that I didn't\ntravel um you would have been great we\ndon't know\nthat right but the the prices that I pay\nthe prices we\npay\nokay all right let's move on because now\nthat I've creeped y'all\nout\num all\nright\nokay let's look at one\nmore oh my God almost out of time okay\nlet's do one more let's go chat stay\nwith\nme\ndude oh my God okay we'll tell that\nstory one day but we have you know\npeople with social anxiety to help okay\nhow to make social anxiety afraid\nme um what does it take to go to a\nparty/ bar not knowing anyone and acting\nbatshit crazy and not give a flying [Â __Â ]\nwhile not caring about what others think\nno alcohol or drugs I've seen this video\npop up on Instagram a guy ridiculously\ncelebrating in a restaurant not caring\nwhat others think about him enjoying his\ntime and I instantly reminded of how\nawkward I am in these kinds of situation\nI don't I tried hitting play here but it\ndidn't work yeah so I think we have to\ngo to Instagram\nso I'm going to mute this for a second\nchat just because so let's just watch\nthis\noh how do I okay hopefully this\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nisn't\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nall\nright so someone's\nasking how do I be like this person\nright and everyone's saying like oh he's\nliving right this person's living their\nlife\nso let's understand why this is hard for\npeople with social anxiety and how to do\nthis so if you want to understand what\ngoes on in social anxiety basically the\nproblem is that you're adding a handicap\nto any situation so anytime we have an\naction if you look at this person what\nis this person doing they're absorbed in\ntheir action so why is this person\ndancing I'm going to make an assumption\nhere this may not actually be true that\nthey're dancing out of the enjoyment of\nit they're\ncelebrating right so today is presumably\ntheir birthday and it's like it's my\nbirthday I'm having a good time and I\nfeel like dancing there's Hype music so\nI'm going to dance for my\npleasure see when we add social anxiety\nto the equation what we do is we add a\nlayer of complexity because now instead\nof being absorbed in the task I'm\nthinking about how the task is perceived\nby other\npeople so I can focus on making a really\ngood dish but if I'm worried about how\nthat dish will taste to other people and\nhow they will judge me for it it will\nreduce my ability to engage in that\nthing so our attention in this world is\nlimited we can't focus on 15 things at\nthe same time the fewer things that you\nfocus on the more intensely that you do\nit so the moment that you start worrying\nabout other people your mind is not at\nthe task at hand and now here's a huge\nproblem right this creates a exponential\nproblem it's not just linear because\nwhen my task when I'm 100% focused on\nthe\ntask I'm not paying attention to other\npeople so I get 100% of my cognitive\nenergy on the task the task will go\nbetter the moment that I shift my\nattention away to to other people not\nonly I am I interpreting their stimuli\nin a negative way because that's what\nhappens in social anxiety we interpret\nambiguous stimuli\nnegatively that feeds my anxiety more\nand then I focus Less on the task so the\ntask is objectively done worse because\nmy attention isn't on it and as I start\nto panic my focus becomes even more\nDisturbed and it doesn't go well so\ngreat example of this is having\nsex\nso when you have\nsex if you absorbed in the task and\nyou're not worried about what the other\nperson is thinking or feeling or you're\njust vibing with them there can be an\nempathic connection where you are\nparticipating with them without worrying\nabout them without thinking about\nthem and then the ACT can feel really\ngood and yet if you have anxiety while\nyou're having sex you're not focused on\nthe ACT very\nsimple right and some sometimes the\nanxiety gets so bad that it interferes\nwith your\nperformance you can have\ndifficulties with the men that I've\nworked with sometimes their anxiety gets\nso bad they have difficulty maintaining\nan erection so this is the objective\ndifficulty in the performance and then\nthe cycle repeats itself so how does one\nbe\nfree in this\nway so the answer is to Simply focus on\nthe ACT okay the other couple of things\nthat we don't really think about is that\nthis person knows how to\ndance right they've got a Jimmy Hendrick\nt-shirt on so I don't know if there's no\ndrugs\ninvolved but this person knows how to\ndance so the other thing is that often\ntimes when we see people who are\nconfident in public that confidence was\nnot they're not naturally this way this\nis a crafted skill especially when it\ncomes to dance dancing or even speaking\nlike here I am talking to y'all and I'm\nconfident but I wasn't born this way\nthis is the result of a lot of practice\nright been streaming for thousands of\nhours\nyears and even then I started teaching\nat the age of\n21 and I started teaching meditation to\na group of high schoolers middle\nschoolers and elementary\nkids I've been teaching for 20\nyears so if you want to be confident in\npublic do two things the first is\npractice whatever you're doing in public\nin private get good at it develop your\nown internal confidence which is not\nwhat we\nsee all we see we see 60 seconds of this\nperson not even 60 seconds maybe 45\nseconds of this person dancing how many\nhours do you think that this person\ndanced do you think that they looked as\ngood as they do in this in this clip\nabsolutely\nnot and the second thing is\nenjoy this is very simple secret\nenjoy what's the purpose of\nlife\nis it to craft the opinions of others\ninto liking you a lot I don't think so I\nmean some people make it their purpose\nand that doesn't work out very well so\nif this feels hard to you what makes it\nhard for you to enjoy what you were\ndoing and this is the beautiful thing is\nin the same way that it's exponentially\nbad right if I get anxious about whether\nI'm good and bad that can lead to\nproblems like vaginal dryness or flaccid\nerections\nclassid penises and so it creates a\ndownward spiral the good news is that\nthe opposite is also true see when you\nare fully absorbed in something there is\nempathy other human beings pick up on\nwhat you send so even if if this person\nwas not as good of a a dancer why is it\nthat we all gravitate what is this\nperson the most skilled dancer in the\nworld are we sitting there thinking oh\nmy God this person look at that move and\nthat move and this person is so precise\nand they're so skilled no what are we\nresonating with this person is having\nfun let's go right that's what we feel\nwhen we watch him and that empathic\nenergy if you want other people to have\nfun with you you have to be having fun\nyourself they will absorb that\nenergy and we do this on stream I feel\nyour energy and you feel my\nenergy you don't even I don't even need\nto see you I can tell from chat I don't\nneed to see fa\nExpressions so when you are absorbed in\nthe task that you're\ndoing then people will also be like even\nif you're not the best dancer like you\ndon't need to be the best I don't think\nwe're all like appreciating like I mean\nthe person is clearly skilled but we're\nnot like this isn't some dance contest\nwhere this person is like some Master's\ngrandmas level dancer maybe is who knows\nbut that's not what this is right we see\nsomeone who is celebrating and that\nbrings us\njoy so as you become absorbed in your\nown enjoyment and you share that with\nthe world it is an\noffering that's how you bypass social\nanxiety see social anxiety is about\ngiving something someone good you're\nconcerned about how they will receive it\nbut an offering is completely different\nI offer what I have to give and I offer\nit with love if it's good or bad that's\nnot I don't know whether it satisfies\nyou or doesn't satisfy you how am I\nsupposed to know no\nidea so in life if you want to if you're\ncrippled by this kind of stuff enjoy\nthings yourself and offer what you have\nto give in whatever pathetic way it\nis we're so concerned about giving\npeople good things just offer what you\nhave that's the most that you can give\nI'm not saying be\nnegligent you know my kids come in and\nthey bring me some\npicture of theirs and it's not going to\nbe winning any art\ncontests but I receive it with love\nbecause it's given with love and it\nmakes me\nhappy so the attitude that you bring to\nthe table everyone's like oh my God so I\nthink sure you should practice by all\nmeans but if you really look at what's\ngoing on how can we enjoy this moment\nbecause we C get caught up in the\nempathy of it we get caught up in the\noffering of it and what is this person\ndoing it's an\noffering they can celebrate in their\nmind but they're like I'm going to offer\nyou my celebration I'm going to offer\nyou my\njoy and in our society this has become\nsomething that is like a vestigal skill\nit's all about transactions it's all\nabout outcomes it's all about KP no one\ngives a [Â __Â ] about you doing your best\nanymore and this is the society that we\nsee we don't accept people for what they\noffer we don't accept people in the\ncapacity that they have to\ngive and there are some good reasons for\nthat but I think it's gone too far so if\nyou're struggling with social\nanxiety number one enjoy\nyourself number two share what you have\nright that's the way to do\nthis and number\nthree\npractice so if you want to act a\nparticular way in public practice\npractice practice\npractice it'll make the public stuff see\nyou can fail in private without social\nanxiety and then you'll be more\nconfident when you go\nout\nokay we're at time today but we have a\ncouple of other great\nposts um but let's let's I want to do a\ncouple of\nquestions okay this is a great\nquestion from Doge boss\n1563 how do I tie all this stuff you\ntaught up together there's too many\nthings to focus on\nit's a great\npoint so first is like you don't have to\ntie it all together right so why do we\noffer so especially like the social\nanxiety thing there's a cycle so you you\ndo what resonates with\nyou if you guys want one thing to focus\non focus on the way that you put your\nattention so if we're talking about\nsocialization especially the biggest\nproblem in socialization is that our\nattention goes places that do not allow\nus to enjoy ourselves this is the\ndirector's\ncut so pay attention to the times where\nyou can be absorbed in the\ntask instead of thinking and this is\nwhere I say instead of you can't control\nthe thinking so the thinking will happen\nthe key thing is not to indulge\nit so you can even notice I'll give you\nall a technique oh my mind is being\nanxious\nagain beautiful\ntechnique\nso there's something\ncalled thought fusion and thought\ndefusion this is one of the skills that\nwe try to build in cognitive behavioral\ntherapy you become one with your\nthoughts but thoughts are just thoughts\nthey're not\nreality right if they were the\n25-year-old thinker would be the\nhappiest person on the\nplanet because imagination and reality\nthere's a big gap to the Chagrin of the\n25-year-old thinker so as you notice\nyourself feeling anxious just point out\nto yourself wow my mind is very anxious\ntoday take a couple of deep breaths\nbecause breathing will reduce your\nanxiety if you need some sensory stimul\nsome reduction in sensory stimulus\nbecause your Thalamus is overwhelmed go\noutside but do your best to enjoy\nyourself and also recognize like what\nare the consequences that you're worried\nabout right so the problem with anxiety\nis that I don't know how to say this let\nme think about how to put\nthis see anxiety never reaches\nresolution anxiety never reaches a\nconsequence if you really pay attention\nto what happens in anxiety in the mind\nit thinks in Direction number\none and then if you're if you really pay\nattention you think about this will\nhappen this will happen this will happen\nthis will happen this will happen and\nthen when you get to the end you'll\nnotice that the anxiety goes back and\nthen it'll think down track number two\nand then track number three and then\ntrack number four and track number\nfive and so it if you really think about\nit what happens in anxiety is you feel\nthe\nemotional pain of alternate\nuniverses only one of those things will\nhappen but in anxiety you put yourself\nthrough every possibility and every\npossibility hurts this is what's really\nweird we about the brain so there's one\nreal\nproblem which is that a hypothetical\nnegative event in the\nfuture\nactivates our emotional circuitry as if\nthe event was\nhappening so this is really bizarre I\nwant you all to think about this because\nthe negative emotional circuitry is the\nonly part of our brain that is capable\nof\nthis see if I think about a hypothetical\nof getting\nlaid I don't n\nI don't get\ndopamine see the thought of something\ngood if I think about winning first\nprize or getting gold medal in the\nOlympics I don't feel a cathartic Joy\nflush through my\nbody but if there are brain scan studies\non this if you look at negative\nconsequences the amydala activates in\nthe same way as if the event came to\npass\nso we can feel hypothetical pain in the\nreal world but we cannot feel\nhypothetical\npleasure and so the challenge with\nanxiety is we run through this scenario\nthis scenario this scenario this\nscenario and we get bludgeoned by each\none so we don't actually think through\none consequence we think through 10 of\nthem and we feel the pain of all of them\nso notice that your mind is doing this\nand notice that all of these scenarios\nthat your mind is going through chances\nare you're overinflating the costs if\nyou're at a complete lack of if you're\ntruly stuck imagine Texas accent creepy\nDr K and how do you compare to that\nperson because that person if I acted\nlike that in in public I mean this\nbecause this is public this feels nice\nand\nintimate you know that's when you I mean\nreal creepiness is real creepiness and\nusually the people who are truly creepy\nare\noblivious so where should should you\nstart pay attention to where your\nattention goes try as best as you can to\nabsorb yourself in the social activity\nbecause it'll be exponentially positive\nif you\ncan\nokay\num is it counterintuitive to attempt to\nfocus on enjoying myself when\ninteracting with someone if I am feeling\nin a in a low energy yeah so I think so\nremember that a lot of what happens in\nsocial interaction is made by two people\nso if you're feeling like low\nenergy you know like pick up on someone\nelse's energy try to set that stuff\naside and like you know there there's\nsome amount of empathy there so the\nwhole point of empathy is that the two\npeople can get on the same page and the\ncore problem with social anxiety is that\nwe can't be empathic because we are\nactually relating to ourselves you're in\na conversation with yourself when you're\nsocially anxious and when you're in a\nconversation with yourself you can't be\nin a conversation with someone else\neffortlessly so that's where like tune\ninto other people and tune in the task\nat hand that's the best thing to\ndo\nokay all right y'all thank you very much\nfor coming today I see we have a ton of\nquestions I see some stuff about\num you know I see a lot of questions\nabout like initiating tasks and\ndepression and stuff like that we have\nguides where we cover a lot of that\nstuff in detail so we have a guide to\nADHD and doing stuff we also have a\nguide to depression where we talk about\nwhat effective methodologies there are\num and that's why we built those because\notherwise I would be answering those\nquestions every stream all\nstream\num okay thank you thank you g feros for\nyour comment after 27 years old you\ndon't need solving problems or healing\nyou need self salvation I mean to Free\nYourself of problems and live in spite\nof them beautiful all right\ntake care y'all thank you very much for\ncoming today and then I think we have um\na members lecture on\nKarma which will be I believe on\nWednesday so looking forward to that\nit'll be a little bit more in depth"
