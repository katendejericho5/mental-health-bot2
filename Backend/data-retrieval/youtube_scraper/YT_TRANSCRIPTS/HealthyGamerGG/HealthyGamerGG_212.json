    "transcript": "sort of think about this the way that we\nbeat ourselves up for not being manly\nenough it's a hurtful thing so that's\nwhy I'm applying the term toxic but it's\nkind of like this impression of what a\nman should be that I don't live up to\nwhich then I hurt myself like I beat\nmyself up for it so that becomes kind of\ntoxic if you do something that is\nmasculine and people don't like it\nthey're going to call you a toxic\nmasculine and if they do like it\nif they appreciate it they will call it\nhealthy\nmasculinity"
