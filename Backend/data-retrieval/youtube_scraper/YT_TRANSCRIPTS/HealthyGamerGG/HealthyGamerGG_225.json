    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about analysis\n[Music]\nparalysis as a psychiatrist I've worked\nwith a ton of people who get paralyzed\nwith over analysis so they're trying to\nsolve problems in their life really\nimportant problems like what should I\nmajor in in college should I stay in\nthis relationship should I quit this job\nshould I pursue my dreams or should I do\nsomething that gives me a stable income\nand as we're faced with all of these\nproblems our minds starts logic through\nthings it makes calculations it says\nokay we could do this we could do this\nhere are the benefits here are the cons\nand at the end of the day though the\nMind ends up warning us because what if\nthings go wrong what if you break up\nwith this person and you can't find\nsomeone else what if you choose to study\nthis in college but then you can't find\na job so in all of these situations of\nanalysis paralysis we make calculations\nand then our mind warns us of the\nconsequences and no matter how many\ntimes we think through things\nwe can't seem to find an answer that\nprompts us to action and the reason for\nthat is because our brain is making\nintentional\nmiscalculations about the future that\nend up paralyzing us and this is the\nscience of loss aversion hey all' if\nyou're interested in applying some of\nthe principles that we share to actually\ncreate change in your life check out Dr\nK's guide to mental health it combines\nover two decades of my experience of\nboth being a monk and a psychiatrist and\ndistills all of the most important\nthings I've learned into a Choose Your\nOwn Adventure format so check out the\nlink in the bio and start your journey\ntoday so this is super cool because this\nresearch comes out of the field of\nneuroeconomics this is part of the\nreason why no one really understands\nthis because this is an emerging field\nsee we used to have psychology which\nstarted with people like Sigman Freud\nand Yung and stuff like that and now we\nhave things like psycho therapy and we\nhave therapists who understand all of\nthese things about human behavior and\nthen we have stuff like Neuroscience we\nstarted doing brain scans but the people\nwho are doing brain scans aren't\nactually helping human beings change\ntheir behavior and then we have the\nfield of Economics which is about how\nhuman beings make choices and so\nsomething really cool has happened which\nis that in the last decade or so these\nthree Fields have merged into something\ncalled\nneuroeconomics and the revelations from\nneuroeconomics are fascinating and one\nof the most important things that we've\ndiscovered which a lot of therapists\ndon't understand we're not trained in\nthis stuff is about loss aversion so if\nwe want to understand how to overcome\nanalysis paralysis it turns out that\nneuroeconomics gives us a really good\ninsight into how our brain makes\ndecisions and how there are certain\nparts of the brain that will keep you\nparalyzed because they are afraid of the\nconsequences the crazy thing is that\nthese parts of the brain actually make\nincorrect calculations which is part of\nthe reason why we when you do something\nthat's really difficult right often\ntimes you'll have this experience of\nlike oh it wasn't that bad after all and\nif you stop and think about it for a\nsecond how is it that you thought it was\ngoing to be so bad and it turns out to\nnot be that bad after all that's because\nyour brain is making an intentional\nmiscalculation so let's start by\nunderstanding the basic circuitry of\nloss aversion and once we understand\nthis we'll understand why we end up in\nanalysis paralysis and what to do about\nit so let's take a quick look at the\ncircuits of the brain that are involved\nin loss aversion so the first is the\nventral tegmental area which is also\ngoverned by dopamine so this is our\ndopaminergic Circuit of the brain this\nprovides motivation reward and\nbehavioral reinforcement all right so\nthis is the part of our brain that tells\nus to do it but when we make a decision\ndown here we also have another part of\nour brain we have our amygdala our lyic\nsystem this one is also NORAD energic\nand this will become important later but\nthis is what gives us fear or predicts\nlosses okay so what ends up happening is\nthis Circuit of the brain and this\nCircuit of the brain each generate a\nresponse that then combine together into\nsome kind of calculation in the striatum\nand then this results in some kind of\ndecision so let's just think through\nthis okay anytime we're trying to think\nabout the decision we think about the\nreward we think about what's the\nadvantage of doing this this is done by\nthe VTA and then we also think about the\nconsequence okay like should I break up\nwith this person or not well let's see\nlike if I break up with this person\nmaybe I'll feel alone maybe I won't find\nsomeone will I be able to find someone\nand there's a lot of uncertainty here\nand then what happens is we sort of end\nup over here and unless this decision is\nmade in the right way or unless this\ncalculation is in the right way we end\nup not making a decision so this seems\nsuper simple right we think about the\npotential advantages we think about the\nthe potential consequences and then we\nresult in the decision and the reason\nthat I'm paralyzed is because I don't\nhave enough information to make the\nappropriate calculation so it feels like\nin my brain I'm spinning my wheels I\nthink through the same stuff over and\nover and over again but this remains a\nquestion mark there's no decision to be\nmade because I need more information\nturns out that the reason that you can't\nmake a decision is because this guy over\nhere is intentionally\ndivorced from reality and this is insane\nand if we want to overcome analysis\nparalysis what we actually need to do is\nre in this Circuit of the brain to be\nmore commensurate with reality and once\nit is more commensurate with reality our\nability to act will become easier so let\nme just give you all a simple example of\nthis right so anytime you have analysis\nparalysis what it boils down to is you\ncan't act because what if someone\nsomething goes wrong right that's the\nessence of it so your brain is worried\nabout a potential loss all of this\neffort without some kind of gain what if\nI put in all of this effort resources\ntime energy and what if it doesn't work\nout so your mind is predicting the loss\nand if you sort of think about it that's\nwhy you can't act right because there\ncould be a potential loss there could be\nsomething that goes wrong and then all\nmy effort is wasted so if you really\nlook at what paralyzes you it's not the\ncalculation it's that there's a chance\nthat something could go wrong if I could\neliminate the chance that something\ncould go wrong or reduce the chance that\nsomething could go wrong would it be\neasier for you to act and if the answer\nto that question is yes we're going to\nshow you exactly how to do that so this\nis where we get to a couple of\nexperiments about\nneuroeconomics and this is what's really\nweird Okay so a lot of the stuff isn't\ngoing to make logical sense because it's\nnot logical because our brain works in\nan illogical way so the first principle\nthat we understand is that if I have $5\nand I have an object that is worth\n$5 these are not worth the same in my\nmind literally what my brain does is\nanytime I'm thinking about purchasing\nsomething okay so I have the $5 in my\nhand I want to buy a $5 object what my\nbrain does is thinks about all of the\npossibilities of the $5 right I could do\nthis with $5 I could buy that I could\nget a coffee I could get a digital\ncosmetic I could to order a book on sale\nI could do all of these things with $5\noh my God imagine all the stuff I could\ndo with $5 and then what happens is we\nthink about the object itself and what\nwhat does the object do it can only do\none thing so then my brain decides okay\neven though these two things are\ntechnically worth the same my brain\nvalues the $5 more now that may make\nperfect sense but now this is when\nthings get weird so let's say I have an\nobject with $5 worth $5 sorry and I'm\nthinking about selling the object so\nthen what happen happens is my brain\ndoes the opposite it actually thinks to\nmyself oh my God I have this $5 coffee\nmug this is the best coffee mug I enjoy\nthis coffee mug every single day it's\nreally crazy but like man I love this\ncoffee mug so much and if I sold it I\nwouldn't be able to you know use this\ncoffee mug anymore and so now what we\nsort of think about is the value of the\nobject and then we end up thinking a\nlittle bit about the value of $5 so I\nknow it SS kind of weird but like\nthere's very little value in the $5 if\nwe already own the object so this is\nwhat's kind of weird but the science of\nloss aversion teaches us that that which\nyou already own is worth more to you\nthan a possibility of something else now\nthis may sound kind of weird but I want\nyouall to just think about this for a\nsecond okay so anytime you're thinking\nabout let's say should I major in this\nparticular thing in college should I\nstudy this in college so if you sort of\nthink about it in that moment what you\nown is a lot of free time right so this\nis your time you haven't committed to a\nmajor what you own In This Moment is the\npossibility of choosing the right thing\nthere are a lot of sort of things that\nyou own already I know it sounds kind of\nweird but this is how it works and then\nthe moment that you commit to something\nit's either it works out or it doesn't\nwork out but right now before you make a\nchoice you have all of these\npossibilities available this is like\nhaving the $5 and then the other thing\nthat's really weird about this is that\nthe duration of ownership matters so the\nlonger that you hold the $5 or the\nlonger that you own the object the more\nit is worth to you and this explains why\nthis is really confusing but a lot of\npeople I work with Will let's say waste\ntheir life playing video games they say\nI've been playing video games for 10\nyears and oh my God people think that\nlogically if you've been wasting your\nlife for 10 years then that you should\nbe more motivated to do something with\nit right so if it's like okay I wasted a\nday like not that big of a deal but once\nI waste a month I'll be more motivated\nif I waste a year I'll I'll be more\nmotivated because I have all this\ncatching up to do but the science of\nloss aversion teaches us that the longer\nthat you hold in a particular pattern\nthe longer that you engage in this dopam\nenergic activity the more it matters to\nyou the more that it be you become\nattached to it and the harder it is to\ngive up so we literally value things\nthat we've been doing and things that we\nown for a longer period of time so the\nvalue of that which you own is worth\nmore to you than a potential possibility\nand this explains some of our analysis\nparalysis because if I'm in a\nrelationship let's say and the\nrelationship isn't very good good let's\nsay it's only a two out of 10 and I look\nat the rest of the world and I think to\nmyself okay there's a lot of people out\nthere that I could have a five out of 10\nrelationship with the problem is that\nonce you already own this relationship\nyour brain amplifies this by two to\nthree times literally we sort of know\nwhat the number is and this also changes\nwith the duration of the ownership so\nthe longer that you've been in a\nrelationship the more that your brain\nvalues it even if objectively it is not\nworth very much okay so now we begin to\nsee one calculation and this will fit in\nmore but that the duration of ownership\nand what you own actually increases the\nvalue of something in your mind even if\nit is it objectively worth less we'll\ntalk about how to deal with that\ninformation how to use it more\napplicably but this is the first bias\nthat we need to understand the second\nthing that we need to understand is a\ntemporal bias now this is going to sound\nkind of confusing like a lot of stuff in\nthis video because a lot of stuff is not\nlogical because it's actually divorced\nfrom reality so let's understand the the\ntemporal bias okay so remember we have\nthe ventral tegmental area which gives\nus dopamine which gives us our\nexperience of a reward and then we have\nour amydala which gives us our fear\nwhich gives us our projection of loss so\nhere I am am trying to make a decision\nabout the future so I don't know if this\nmakes sense but when we make a decision\nabout the future when we're worrying\nabout the future the pain of a future\nloss can be experienced today but the\ndopamine reward from a future\naccomplishment cannot be experienced\ntoday this is screwed up so anytime you\nsort of look at something that you're\ndoing right let's say I'm picking a a\nmajor in college so the exhilaration of\ngraduating four years from now with a\ndegree doesn't give me any dopamine it's\njust a possibility it doesn't activate\nthis part of my brain thinking about the\nfuture thinking about how much fun a\ngame is going to be does not release a\nsurge of dopamine the thing that is\nscrewed up about our brain is that a\nfuture loss can be experience today so\nliterally if you were stuck in analysis\nparalysis and you're thinking about the\nbenefits and you're thinking about the\nlosses the pain of the loss can be\nexperienced in the present moment even\nif you haven't lost anything and it is\nthat pain of loss right that you\nexperience over here this you get this\nsignal we get this one right so this one\nactually comes in to our brain is like\nouch this hurts but we don't get any of\nthe perspective pleasure this remains\nempty and what this results in is it\nkeeps us stuck and if only things were\nthat easy it turns out that things are\nactually even worse than this so it\nisn't just that you can experience a\nfuture loss in the present which will\nparalyze you from acting because it\nhurts so much it's that the amount of\nloss that you experience is two times\nwhat it actually is okay so this is\nliterally what we know so when our brain\nmakes a calculation about the future it\ncuts the reward in 50% or 1/2 and it\nactually does doubles the size of the\nloss so let's take a quick look at a\npaper that sort of illustrates how\nscrewed up this is so while potential\nloss had a significantly greater effect\non Choice than potential gain in both\nadolescence and adults this is looking\nat specifically adolescence but the key\nthing here to understand is that we\nvalue losses more than we value gains by\na factor of about two so I know that\nsounds kind of bizarre but what that\nliterally means is anytime you are faced\nwith some kind of analysis problem is\nyour brain is actually doubling the cost\nof what you're trying to do and cutting\nin half the benefit of what you're\ntrying to do and if you've kind of gone\nthrough life you've sort of noticed this\nright you've noticed that okay you're\nreally worried about something going\nwrong and your brain is like this could\ngo wrong and this could go wrong and\neverything could fall apart and then you\nend up doing it and you're like you know\nwhat it wasn't that bad after all I see\nthis a lot even in children who are\ngetting vaccines or getting injections\nwhere it's like okay the kid is\nterrified of the shot oh my God the shot\nis going to hurt so much but you get the\nshot it lasts like less than 5 seconds\nand then you kind of feel fine and\neverything is okay and so it turns out\nthat because of evolutionary reasons our\nbrain has learned how to\namplify prospective losses in order to\nprotect us from making mistakes but the\nworld that we live in now has changed\ndrastically from when we were like\nprimates living in the wilderness and we\nwere like trying to figure out whether\nwe should try to hunt down this deer\nwhen we also see tiger tracks so this is\nthe problem the world that we live in\ntoday has a lot of uncertainty and in\nall of this uncertainty there are a lot\nof possible losses that you could\nexperience the challenge is that in your\nbrain all of those possible losses\nliterally activate your loss experience\nin the brain they activate your fear\nresponse Center they activate your\namydala and those things decrease your\nmotivation they make it hard for you to\nact so not only is this temporal\ncomponent where we can experience the\nlosses of the future in the present and\nwe can't experience the gains but also\nthere is an amplification of this signal\nso now the question becomes what on\nEarth do we do about it and this is\nwhere there's good news because in the\nsame way that our brain is kind of\nscrewed up there are other Revelations\nthat we have that can help us almost\ntrick the brain into overcoming analysis\nparalysis and acting the first thing\nthat we need to talk about is order of\noperations so I don't know if yall\nremember this but if we kind of go back\nup here we remember that that which we\nown already is worth more than a\nprospective gain right so if we kind of\ngo back to this idea of the $5 in our\nhand versus the $5 object this is worth\nmore so in our brain literally the order\nof our thoughts matters and I'll give\nyou a very very simple example of this\nso you wake up in the morning and you\nsay I want to play video games and then\nyour brain says but I should work I want\nto game but I should dot dot dot and if\nyou pay attention to your thoughts in\nanalysis paralysis what you will find is\nsome combination of this structure all\nthe time right I really don't want to be\nin this relationship but I could be\nalone forever I really do want to be in\nthis relationship but I have feelings\nfor this other person so we have all of\nthese kinds of initial thought followed\nby but dot dot dot so this is where once\nagain neuroeconomics teaches us\nsomething really interesting whatever\nthought you think first is worth way\nmore in your decision making than the\nthought afterward the first thought is\nmore more likely to be what you go with\nthan the second thought and I've seen\nthis in my work as an addiction\npsychiatrist so what I've noticed when I\nsort of read this paper it sort of\nclicked with me because when I work with\npeople who are addicted to stuff what I\nnoticed is that the order of their\nthoughts changes hey I really want to\nhave a drink today but I shouldn't and\nthen eventually what starts to happen is\nthey wake up in the morning they say wow\nI I really need to take care of X Y and\nZ today I have this to do I have this to\ndo man it would be really nice to have a\ndrink so what starts happen is the\ntemporal order of their thoughts changes\nand what neuroeconomics teaches us is\nwhichever thought you think first is\ngoing to have a stronger motivational\nimpact so if you are trying to do\nsomething I know this sounds kind of\nweird but what we really want you to do\nis think in the direction that you\nnaturally want to go first right so if\nyou're trying to struggle with gaming\naddiction wake up first thing in the\nmorning and think to yourself this is\nwhat I really need to accomplish today\nright so start immediately thinking\nabout the direction that you want to\nmove in and then your mind will come up\nwith other reasons but I want a game and\nI'm not saying that this is going to\nwork 100% there's more to it but we\nactually know from studies of\nneuroeconomics that if you can change\nthe order of your thinking it will start\nto result in a motivational change and\ncan potentially move you in the right\ndirection the second thing that we're\ngoing to talk about is intermixed losses\nthis one is huge so here's what we know\nimagine for a moment that you are\nplaying one game of your favorite\nwhatever mobile FPS whatever you're\nqueuing up for one round of something if\nthat game is a loss how much does it\nhurt right if you play one game a day\nand you lose it hurts a lot and in fact\nif you're like me you never just play\none game a day right if you only could\nplay one game a day and there are times\nin your life where you could queue up\nfor one round you actually don't because\nwhat if the game goes bad you don't want\nto just play one game and lose but if\nyou have 10 hours to play You're Going\nto queue up 10 times you can afford to\nlose the first game it's not that big of\na deal so if we look at these two\nscenarios and they're literally the same\nright so I've played one game and I've\nlost that one game but in one scenario\nthis is okay let's just queue up and\nplay another in the other scenario this\nhurts a lot because things have ended so\nthis is another thing that we understand\nabout loss aversion when we set a\nparticular end point the possibility of\na loss hurts way more but if we have\nintermixed losses and gains which means\nwe have some wins and some losses each\nof those losses hurts way less so what\nthis practically means is if you're\nthinking about picking a particular\nmajor in college you sort of pick your\nend point in your mind at four years and\nyou think to yourself at the end of four\nyears what if I've made a mistake oh my\nGod I don't know what to do what if I\npicked the wrong thing and then I can't\nfind a job job because that's our\nparticular end point so the way that we\nframe the end determines how much the\nloss hurts and remember the more that\nthe loss hurts the more it activates our\namydala and the more paralyzed it keeps\nus so let me give you all a different\nscenario let's say I said okay you've\ngot 10 years to figure out what you're\ngoing to do with your life you've got 10\nyears to sort out your career are you\nwilling to spend four out of your 10\nyears to go to college and get a\nparticular degree now just think about\nhow different that feels right picking a\nmajor that will determine the rest of\nyour life versus you've got 10 years to\nfigure it out University or college is\nan option you can spend four years doing\nthat and you've got 6 years left if\nthings don't work out just notice how\ndifferent that feels mentally and this\nis because we are now utilizing\nintermixed losses and gains so what we\nwant to practically do is if you are\nparalyzed with some kind kind of\nanalysis chances are you are looking at\nan end point and that end point if you\nextend it further out instead of saying\nis this the right person for me or not\nshould I break up with this person or\nnot break up with this person try to add\nmore time to the end of it try to really\nthink about things in terms of\nintermixed losses and gains this may\nactually particularly go wrong that may\nhappen you know there's no way we can't\npredict we don't know that things aren't\ngoing to go wrong but the more time that\nwe add to the end of our mental equation\nthe easier it is to act now remember\nthat the goal of this video is not to\nsay that you should act or shouldn't act\nit's to help you overcome analysis\nparalysis and one of the most powerful\nthings that keeps us paralyzed is a\nparticular conception of endpoint as you\nextend that end point out it will be\neasier to act and now we get to the\nthird thing so the third thing is\nactually going to be a combination of a\ncouple of things and what we're going to\ndo is go back to our core structure\nbecause we know that there are multiple\nthings that modify this core structure\nOkay so we've got dopamine we've got\nnoradrenergic transmission over here and\nnow this is going to become important so\nremember I said that there's a box over\nhere and then we end up with a decision\nso now we're going to learn about how to\nfix this system and what's in the box\nokay so the first thing is remember that\nthis side gets Amplified by 2X and this\nside gets cut in half okay so the first\nthing that we can do is is sort of\ncognitively recognize that right so\nrecognize just notice that your mind is\nmaking things twice as bad as they\nshould be and that the gains are going\nto be half as much as what you expect\nunless you're on Wall Street bets in\nwhich case it's all screwed up which is\nwhy it's a beautiful corner of the\ninternet okay so now let's understand a\ncouple of things the more that you can\nengage in emotional regulation the\neasier this equation will be so this is\na problem that we run into with analysis\nparalysis we turn to logic or\ncalculations right we think about a lot\nof variables A + B plus C minus and\nhere's the loss aversion stuff but this\ncould go wrong this could go wrong this\ncould go wrong and then we don't know\nwhat to do so the cool thing is that we\ntend to think that if we logically think\nthrough this equation over and over and\nover again like we're some math\nprofessor right who's working on some\nfamous equation that eventually we'll\nfigure it out that's not what we need to\ndo if we literally engage in emotional\nregulation techniques we will diminish\nthe size of these variables and it will\nbe easier to act we've talked a lot in\nour Channel about different ways to\nregulate emotions and alexiy and all\nthis kind of stuff but literally if you\nhave analysis paralysis you don't need\nmore information you don't need to spend\nmore time calculating you need to calm\ndown your amydala so at least you can go\nfrom a 2X to a 1x estimation which is\nliterally what we we know from the\nscience of neuroeconomics and loss\naversion if you can employ emotional\nregulation strategies it will be easier\nto make a decision because you're a\nmigdala will not be controlling you okay\nand remember also that this is a rigged\ngame because you don't get any benefit\nof dopamine from a hypothetical but you\ndo suffer from a potential loss A\nhypothetical loss in the present which\nis completely screwed up okay the next\nthing that we can do is reduce our\nnoradrenergic transmission so let's take\na quick look at a paper that sort of\nillustrates this LW aversion might rely\non a similar amygdala strial nor\nadrenergic circuit in hu in humans\nsupporting this hypothesis positron\nemission tomography essays essays of\nneuroadrenergic activity have found that\nindividuals with lower adrenergic\ntransporter density presumably leading\nto this is the key thing greater nor\nadrenergic transmission are more levere\nthis is what this is the sentence that\nwe're looking at okay so I know it's\nkind of like weird because I just read a\nbunch of crap but I've deciphered this\nstuff for you here's the the takeaway\nthe more adrenergic transmission you\nhave the more power loss aversion will\nhave over you so I want you all to\nreally think about this too okay because\nthis is weird so when you think\nsomething is going to go wrong what I\nwant youall to understand is that the\nway that your brain calculates what goes\nwrong is not based on reality it depends\non the level of your noradrenergic\ntransmission so then the question\nbecomes how can we reduce noradrenergic\ntransmission and this is huge so stress\nfatigue inability to sleep all of these\nthings increase your noradrenergic\ntransmission right so what we literally\nknow is that when you are stressed out\nin some way your cortisol levels\nincrease your adrenaline levels increase\nand then related to Adrenaline is also\nnoradrenaline so like we have\nepinephrine we have norepinephrine so\nall of this these kinds of stress\nhormones will literally amplify the pain\nof a potential loss as we amplify the\npain of a potential loss it becomes\ndifficult for you to act so let's kind\nof come back to our example should I\nmajor in this thing and if you look at\npeople in college you'll notice that\nsome of them you're like how the hell do\nthese people do this they just pick a\nmajor and they seem to be excited in\nlife but I am not able to be excited I\nam so worried and you look at those\npeople and they're happy go-lucky\nthey're chilling they're vibing they're\nable to enjoy things and that's because\ntheir adrenergic their noradrenergic\nlevel is low they are less stressed out\nand we seem to think that okay they have\nfigured everything out which is why they\nare so Carefree we think that once I\nfigure everything out then I will be\ncarefree the beauty of what\nneuroeconomics teaches us is it's\nliterally the other way around you be\ncarefree first and then it will be very\neasy to make decision and you may say to\nyourself but Dr K that's not going to\nwork because I can't be carefree until I\nmake this decision and this is exactly\nthe intervention that we need to talk\nabout that is factually incorrect what\nwe know from yogic principles of\nDetachment and Vaga and all of these\nother things is that you literally if\nyou decrease your stress level by yoga\nor meditation or even sleeping a full\nnight or reducing your caffeine intake\nor reducing your substance use intake is\nthat your stress level will objectively\ngo down anything that you can do to\ndecrease your noradrenergic transmission\nwill make you more Carefree the more\nCarefree you are the easier it is to\nmake a decision and then we come to the\nlast thing which is where we are the\nmost screwed especially in this\ncommunity so the last variable to\nconsider is interception so the more\ninterceptive you are the more loss of AV\nverion will hurt so what does\ninterception mean so generally speaking\nif we look at human beings they pay\nattention to two different things some\npeople pay attention to the outside\nworld and some people pay attention to\nthe inside world so if you know people\nwho pay attention to the outside world\nthey can be a little bit more\nmaterialistic right there're they're not\nso aware of what's going on in here\nthey're not focused on how the bag that\nthey purchase let's say I purchase some\ndesigner bag and then that bag makes me\nhappy so some people are like wow this\nbag is really great and then there are\npeople like me and probably like you\nbecause you're here you pay attention to\nin here wow look at this happiness that\nI feel from this bag our focus is not in\nthe outside world our focus is in our\ninternal environment and the more\ninteroceptive you are the more\nvulnerable you are to loss aversion and\nthe amydala kind of gets hyperactivated\nso people in our community especially\npay a lot of attention to themselves\nright they're thinking a lot internally\nthey're feeling a lot internally they're\npaying attention to their internal\nsignals it makes you awesome it's a big\nadvantage in spiritual growth because\nthe more inter receptive you are the\neasier it is or the more tuned you are\nto your internal environment the problem\nis that generally speaking if we kind of\nthink about it right spiritual growth in\nworldly success tend to be viewed in\nsome ways as opposite ends of the\nspectrum and so as our interception\nincreases as we pay attention to more\ninternal signals and these can be our\nthoughts they can be the logical ways\nthat we calculate through things they\ncan be our internal emotional\nenvironment the more vulnerable we are\nto all of this loss aversion circuitry\nso the solution there is to externalize\nyour attention and the very practical\nway to think about this is to simply\njust do things that move your attention\noutside of your head so if you are\nstruggling with analysis paralysis where\nis the focus of your attention logic\ncalculation fear instead what you need\nto do is have conversations collect data\nand data is not reading random crap on\nthe internet right go and talk to people\nexplore things take a look at actual\ndata if you can right so the more that\nyou can externalize your attention you\ncan even do things like talk with other\nhuman beings about other things you can\ngo for a walk you can play with a dog\nyou can go to a yoga studio you can go\nout for a cup of coffee whatever it is\nyou can smell smell the roses right like\nwhatever you want to do the more that\nyou externalize your attention\nliterally what happens is this amydala\nloss aversion circuitry in your brain\nstarts to become less powerful as that\nloss aversion circuitry becomes less\npowerful it becomes easier to act so\nlet's summarize so a lot of people today\nstruggle with analysis paralysis we have\nall kinds of problems around gender\nDynamics and dating and professional\ncareers and inflation we have all of\nthese problems the world is filled with\nuncertainty so when our brain is filled\nwith this and anytime we think about\nacting we think about the pros and we\nthink about the cons cons the problem is\nthat anytime we think about the cons it\nactivates our negative emotional\ncircuitry as we activate our leg\nnegative emotional circuitry we feel the\npain of a hypothetical loss in the\npresent and that pain of the\nhypothetical loss because it cannot be\nbalanced by the pleasure of a\nhypothetical gain right so I can think\nabout what it feels like to get dumped\nby my girlfriend or boyfriend but I\ncannot experience the pleasure of a\nhypothetical orgasm if I do not get\ndumped this is a fundamental mismatch\nwith the way that our brain\nexperiences potential gains and\npotential losses and since we have this\nimbalance it biases us towards the loss\nand so literally our brain experiences\nmore loss than gain when we're making a\ncalculation so what do we do about this\nso our brain is kind of weird but there\nare a couple things we can take\nadvantage of the first is that the first\nthought that we have is worth more in\nterms of motivation and action than the\nsecond thought we have so literally\nrearrange your thinking as best as you\ncan the second thing to consider is\nintermixed losses and gains if we pick a\nparticular Endo that will hurt so much\nmore so instead what we want to do is\nextend our time scale and give ourselves\nmore time for wins and losses because if\nyou really think about analysis\nparalysis what is it that paralyzes you\nit's this concept of if there is a\nsetback it's all over right if I break\nup with this person I it's all over I'll\nnever find anyone ever again so really\npay attention to where is the end point\nin your mind and the third thing is\nreally looking at sort of the\nNeuroscience of that circuit and there\nare three three things that we can do\nemotionally reduce our fear and loss\naversion will get better secondly we can\nreduce our stress level which affects\nour noradrenergic circuitry which means\nthat if you are stuck in analysis\nparalysis the most important thing that\nyou can do is to get a good night's\nsleep remember that it's not making the\nright decision that makes you chill it\nis becoming chill first that allows you\nto make the right decision and this is\nalso where people get so stuck right\nbecause so many people I've worked with\nassume that their mental well-being is a\nconsequence of the right decision that's\nwhy you're so paralyzed because\nif you make the wrong decision then your\nlife is ruined so it becomes so\nimportant you're so stressed out about\nit it's literally the other way around\nbecome stressfree first vagia Detachment\ncheck out our guides check out our other\nvideos we have lots of resources on that\nand decisions will become easy the last\nthing is y'all like me have an advantage\nand disadvantage during the character\ncreation screen we picked interoceptive\ninteroceptive means you're thoughtful\nyou're careful you're spiritual but you\nalso amplify the negative signals of\nloss aversion so the more that you can\nexternalize your attention the better\noff you'll be so I'd love it if y'all\ncould give this stuff A shot and let me\nknow how it works for you hey Dr K how\ndo I get my kid to put down the game\nwithout it being a fight every single\ntime the problem with gaming is that it\ntricks our brain into being a substitute\nfor Life once we start to get our\npsychological needs met through the game\nthat's when we become addicted how to\nraise a healthy gamer combines the\nlatest in Neuroscience research along\nwith a decade of clinical practice check\nit out anywhere books are\n[Music]\nsold"
