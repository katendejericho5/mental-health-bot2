    "transcript": "what's the point of good posture is it\njust looking better or is there a\nfeeling that you have when there's all\nkinds of reasons why you want a good\nposture everything from like biology to\nspirituality the basic problem is that\nweight should be supported by bone not\nmuscle so if I for example if I do this\nand you push down you can put like 100\nlounds of force on my arm and my arm\nwill be fine but if you put 5 lbs of\nforce like this my arm will go down so\nif you sort of look at it we want the\nbones of our body to support our weight\nand when we have bad posture when your\nspine is curved now suddenly the weight\nof your upper torso is over here because\nyour spine is curved whereas if you have\nyour spine like this and all of the\nweight of your body is over here then\nyour muscles can relax right because\nthey're not carrying the load of your\nbody so what we tend to see a lot is\nlike tension in the trapezius and around\nthe neck muscles like all these back\nproblems or because we don't sit\nproperly because our our spine is\ndesigned to support our weight"
