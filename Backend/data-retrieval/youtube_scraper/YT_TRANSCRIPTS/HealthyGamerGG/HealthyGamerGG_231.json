    "transcript": "so if I have a goal that I want to be a\nmillionaire and I work today and I earn\n$10 how does my brain interpret that it\nlooks at the effort that I put in it\nsays $10 is nowhere near my goal and it\nactually tanks my motivation because it\nlooks at this situation it says I have\nnot moved sufficiently close to my goal\nso the bigger our goal is the harder it\nis for our brain to get on board with\ndoing it so the 25% rule is take\nanything that you want to accomplish and\ncut it in half and then cut it in half\nagain and this should be your first goal\nat a minimum you can even go smaller\nthan that you go 12.5 there's no amount\nthat is too small but generally speaking\nif you really look at it the more\nambitious your goals are the harder they\nwill be to achieve"
