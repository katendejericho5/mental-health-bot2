    "transcript": "what advice do you give to people about\ngoing down the path of AI girlfriends\navoid it like the plague don't even\ntouch it never look at it or no it's\nfine it's like porn as long as you're\nnot addicted you're good with all\ntechnology it's just recognized that if\nyou have a life that is worth living the\naddiction will melt away on its own so I\nhad a video game addiction we're a\nhealthy gamer now I teach my kids how to\nplay video games I play games with them\nthe whole point is that with these AI\ngirlfriends you're going to be\nvulnerable to that if you have no other\nsubstantial relationship right so I I\nthink the advice that I give to everyone\nis build a life that is worth living\noddly enough I don't even focus so much\non the addiction because we have to have\na solid foundation from which to combat\naddiction so I think the biggest mistake\nthat many people make with trying to\novercome an addiction is that they are\nnot acknowledging the factors in their\nlife that are driving them towards the\naddiction in the first place and you\nhave to tackle those things and then you\ncan deal with the addiction way easier"
