    "transcript": "when we have a date and we're virgins we\nthink that everything goes into this\ndate oh my God this is the chance like\nthis is going to be what determines my\nfuture this doesn't determine your\nfuture this is practice for the\nfuture Bruna Costa hi Dr K from Brazil\nplease your golden advice for a\n30-year-old virgin on everything with a\ndate scheduled with a foreigner for next\nmonth okay so what should you do if\nyou're a 30-year-old virgin who is\nhaving their first date okay so here's\nDr K's guide to if you're a virgin who's\ndating for the first time what to do\nyou've got 30 days the first thing is\nyou got to feel comfortable in your own\nbody so this is what is to be understood\nwhen we are dating and we are\ninexperienced and we're virgins our main\nenemy is the Virgin inside you that is\nwhat you're trying to conquer so how do\nyou conquer the Virgin inside you the\nVirgin inside you doesn't think that\nthey look good they don't feel good\nthey're stressed out they lack\nconfidence so the first thing you've got\nto do is feel good in your own body now\nyou may not be able to do that in 30\ndays but let's get started so in 30 days\nyou will be able to see at least some\nkind of change in your physical body if\nyou start exercising today if you start\nstretching today we want you to\nliterally feel good in your own body and\nthen what we really want you to pay\nattention to is whatever progress you\ncan make in 30 days that's the goal and\nin terms of the stakes oh but what if I\nprocrastinate What if I I do this what\nif I do this remember the goal here is\nthat you want to feel as good as you can\nin 30 days and the clock is ticking so\nfeeling good in your body can be\nexercising can also be things like Mind\nBody practices like yoga and ta Chi when\nyour ass gets up out of the chair and\nyou feel Gran and clunky and and sore\nand stiff that doesn't feel good so when\nyour body is Rusty your mind will be\nrusty okay so you got to exercise or do\nMind Body practices whatever something\nto feel good you can go for a walk\nthat's that's totally fine you can walk\nfor 30 days and that'll be good enough\ngo for 1 hour walk for 30 days a second\npart of that is often times upgrading\nyour physical appearance in whatever way\nyou can so get a nice haircut get some\nadvice from people maybe get some new\nclothing really pay attention to your\nwardrobe consider shaving right so like\nget some advice this is like I think\nokay there's this you know thing of\nlooks maxing that everybody's doing\nnowadays I think some of it's kind of\nbody dysmorphia in Disguise but some of\nit's like pretty good hey y'all if\nyou're interested in applying some of\nthe principles that we share to actually\ncreate change in your life check out Dr\nK's guide to mental health it combines\nover two decades of my experience of\nboth being a monk and a psychiatrist and\ndistills all of the most important\nthings I've learned into a Choose Your\nOwn Adventure format so check out the\nlink in the bio and start your journey\ntoday second thing is that when we have\na date and we're virgins we think that\neverything goes into this date oh my God\nthis is the chance like this is going to\nbe what determines my future this\ndoesn't determine your future this is\npractice for the future so every date\nthat you go on is not about succeeding\nat the date or failing at the date every\ndate you go on is to prepare you and\nlevel up for the next date that's frame\nof mind change number two because when\nyou've been hungry for so long and\nsomeone finally gives you food oh my God\nI need to eat it no no no slow it down\neverything is about leveling up for the\nfuture that's what this date is and the\nthird thing that I would strongly\nstrongly strongly strongly strongly\nrecommend\nis that you try to attach no outcomes to\nthis date don't try to get laid don't\neven try to get a second date or\nanything like that try to have a good\ntime so this is the way that I want\nyouall to think about\ndating so in my life I can be with\nsomeone with a lot of people with one\nperson with no people you can pick\nwhatever and so you're going on a date\nto try to get to know someone appreciate\nthem for who they are and see if you\nhave some kind of natural inclination\ntowards them see if you all can vibe\ntogether or not it's a Vibe check that's\nwhat a date is so it's not about an\noutcome it's about an experience so go\nthere with the attitude of not I need to\nimpress this person and this person\nneeds to like me or anything like that\ndon't let all that stuff go you're going\nyou're going to show up as yourself they\nare going to show up as themselves\nyou're going to be a polished version of\nyou right so you you want to make it\nenjoyable for them as well and just try\nto enjoy the experience I think that's\nwhat what I sort of found is is like um\nand I know this is going to sound\narrogant but same same sort of thing\nhappened is that like when I this was\nthe big thing that changed a lot for me\nso it started with me being a monk so I\nwas like okay I'm going to be a monk so\nnow that I'm hanging out with girls like\nthere's no semblance of any kind of\nromantic anything it's not an option\nit's off the table so I can relax and I\ncan just have a good time right let's\njust go hang out let's go to lunch\nsomewhere hey are you we're done with\nlunch do you want to like go do\nsomething else like let's go for a hike\nand then you end up hanging out with\npeople and they wind up being a little\nbit more attracted to you and then when\nI was in med school contrary to a\npopular belief it's not like everyone\nsalivates over doctors it doesn't fix\neverything immediately we're not even\ndoctors yet we're Med students same sort\nof attitude so I was engaged in med\nschool so I was like all right there's\nno like everyone else is like oh my God\nlike who's who are the hot singles like\nlet's like oh my God you know let's go\nbut I was like yeah I'm not going to\nplay that game so instead when I hung\nout with people it's just let's have fun\nand sometimes people there's attraction\nthat Sparks and that's okay so this is\nwhat I would say is is try to have a\ngood time time right recognize that this\nis not the end of the world or the\nbeginning of the world it's one date and\nyou should learn as much as you can from\nit so are you saying that I should have\nan arranged marriage no see let's talk\nabout arranged marriage for a second so\nlet's understand something so any system\nhas advantages and disadvantages and I\ndidn't have an arranged marriage um my\nparents didn't have an arranged marriage\nit was very scandalous back in the day\nand so when people say like oh my God\narranged marriages are so bad for all of\nthese million reasons and they can be\nreally really bad so I had a family\nmember who basically like was kind of\nforced into an arranged marriage the\nfamily was like somewhat abusive like\nthey basically wanted an unpaid servant\nright so and and someone to like cook\nand clean and like there was no\naffection or equality or respect or\nanything like that and so my family\nmember left right and it was very\nscandalous in the community because\nthey're like oh my God now she's like\ndamaged goods oh my God they would say\nall these kinds of things and so we can\nlook at the evils of arranged marriage\nin that way and they can be very evil\nright and also there's a reason why we\nused to do it and the one thing that we\nforget about arranged marriage is that\nwhat we look for in a partner may not be\nwhat leads to a successful marriage so\nhere we are looking for what we want and\nhow's that working out for us because we\nknow what we want and we deserve what we\nwant right I deserve everything in life\nespecially when it comes to love no\none's raising their kids and being like\nyeah you know I I have daughters and I'm\nnot you know I've never said this to\nthem where I'm like yeah you know I I\nknow that true love is really important\nbut chances are you're going to have to\nsettle for half of what you're really\nlooking for because that's life no dad\ntalks their daughters that way like it's\nabsurd right we don't talk to our sons\nthat way either you just got to settle\nbro you're not going to get what you\nwant so we create all these ideas that\noh you should have absolutely what you\nwant and by the way you're a good judge\nright let's keep that in mind so the one\nadvantage of arranged marriage is that\nyour parents chances are have more\nexperience in understanding what creates\na safe healthy long-term relationship\nthan you do maybe not safe who knows and\nso they have an idea of your personality\ntraits better than you do they know what\nwill complement you well so that's what\nthey sort of make the decision based on\nbecause when we're at the helm it's not\nlike we're always doing great right so\nand this is the the problem with things\nlike dating apps is dating apps don't\nactually allow you to select for the\nvariables that\ncorrelate with success in long-term\nrelationships we just pick things that\nare all superficial like income and\nappearance and whatever Vibe whatever\nright you just answer these random\nthings and that's why by the way I don't\nknow if youall have noticed but dating\napps have moved in the direction of\nbeing like less clear so they're they're\noffering more ambiguous information like\nyou know tell me something interesting\nabout yourself because they've realized\nthat if we just have a bunch of\ncheckboxes it doesn't work so they're\ntrying to get closer to the factors that\nactually correlate with successful\nrelationships so I mean this is it's not\nthat arranged marriages are good or we\nshould go back to them it's that they\nhave some advantages which is that if\nyou grew up with parents who understand\nwhat makes a healthy relationship and if\nyou assume that your parents know you\npretty well then they can be very\nadvantageous at helping you find someone\nwho would be a good partner right they\nthey can have that information more than\nyou can and in the current version of\narranged marriage it's usually not like\nyou meet your bride on the day or\nhusband on the day of the marriage th\nthose happen in India and some places\nstill but nowadays the way that arranged\nmarriage works for most like nris or\nother people is that you basically like\nin in the western system right in\nAmerica you date someone for a while and\nthen you have to meet the parents face\nand that can go well or that can go\npoorly right now in the Indian system\nit's just reversed so the parents\npre-approve it's you've been\npre-approved for your loan you've\nalready been approved for this credit\ncard the parents do the pre-approval\nprocess then you go on a series of dates\nwith like five or six people 10 people\nhowever however many and then you keep\non dating people until you like one so\nit's just the steps are reversed let's\nmake a biodata I'm already married son\nyeah so someone the issue is forcing\narranged marriages to everyone yeah so\nthat absolutely happens and I do not\nagree with forced arranged marriage like\nthat's just you know I think that that\ntoo comes from a I just don't think\nthat's really viable anymore but you\nknow there was a time in human history\nwhere Community kind of mattered way\nmore than the individual like you as an\nindividual had a responsibility\notherwise just we wouldn't survive like\nright so this was before we had a lot of\ntechnology and things like that so there\nwere like really simple things like in\nyour village of 300 so I was talking to\nmy Grandma about this and so she was\nkind of telling me that you know like\nthe one thing about arranged marriage is\nthat so what would happened is you'd\nfall in love with like people in your\nvillage right but they wouldn't let you\nmarry anyone from your village you had\nto go one or two Villages over to find a\npartner and why is that it's because\nchances are you're like somewhat related\nto the people in your village right cuz\nyou all have been living there for like\ngenerations and generations and\ngenerations and there's some like so\nlike they had this rule where like\nwhoever you got married to had to be\nfrom one or two Villages over that was\nreally the Only Rule they just won't let\nyou and who do you fall in love you\nnever meet these people because you\ndon't you the village over is like 20\nmiles away which is like a day's travel\nor something like that so there were\nreasons why people had these kinds of\nrules and it was just a whole different\nworld someone's asking Dr K how do I get\na girlfriend and stop being so shy\naround\ngirls\nokay let's talk about this for a second\nso couple of things to understand the\nfirst is that shyness as a personality\ncharacteristic does not correlate with\nintroversion or extroversion this is\nvery interesting so shyness also doesn't\nnecessarily correlate with things like\nanxiety so a lot of people think that if\nI'm shy I'm an introvert that's actually\nnot true so you can be a shy extrovert\nwhich can be very painful if you're a\nshy extrovert because you're shy but you\nreally love hanging out with people so\nif we understand what shyness is right\nso there's like a couple of different\nparallel things that we tend to get\nmixed up and if you're struggling with\nshyness the key thing is to try to\nunpack what we mean by the word shy\nbecause some of these things we don't\nwant to change it's part of who who you\nare and we love you for it but part of\nthat stuff can negatively impact things\nthat you want to do so case in point I\nam extremely shy I'm also an extreme\nextrovert so I mean introvert so I know\nit sounds kind of weird but like Dr K\nyou're streaming on the internet no I'm\nsitting in a room by myself on a weekday\nand I don't have to I don't even see\ny'all Y all are just fictitious in my\nmind and nothing helps a shy person so\nmuch as imaginary people on the internet\nright it's like imaginary friends is\ntotally fine so first thing is that\nlet's understand what shyness is and\nmany people find shyness especially\ngirls will find shyness to be cute um so\nlet's understand what to do about that\nso the big problem with Shina is first\nof all it's not introverted or\nextroverted so you can be either or okay\nsecond thing is that often times the\nproblem with shyness is not the shyness\nit's the lack of confidence so someone\nwho is not confident and shy will stay\nin the corner where someone who is\nconfident and shy like I don't care to\nspeak to or get to know people I just\nit's not for me and you guys may say but\nthat's weird aren't you a psychiatrist\nand like don't you get to I love to get\nto know people in that way but I detest\nsmall talk like at a party like I don't\nwant to hang out with any of these\npeople but if if you're confident you\ncan right so then what what ends up\nhappening is I'd say that you need to\nwork on your confidence and don't try to\nfix the shyness because that sort of\nfixing a part of it's a personality\ncharacteristic you don't need to fix\nthat you need to fix the confidence so\nit's not that you should be less shy it\nis that you should have the\ncontrol over yourself to where if you\nare put in a situation that requires\ninteraction with other human beings you\ncan do so with full skill and effort you\nshould not be controlled by shyness and\nthat usually involves confidence so in\nmy case what I really sort of think\nabout so here a couple of tricks to be\nconfident okay I mean I guess it's a\ntrick but it's not really a trick the\nfirst is spend a little bit of time\nthinking how much does this person\nmatter and chances are you will discover\nI know this sounds kind of weird that\nthis person doesn't matter very much\nright so I'm not saying that human\nbeings don't matter I'm not trying to be\nan but often times when we are\nlack confidence we think to ourselves\nthat oh my God if if I screw up this\nconversation with this person it's going\nto be so bad why you're never going to\ntalk to this person again it's like not\nthat big of a deal there's like 8\nbillion human beings on the planet you\ndon't need this one person to like you\nin this moment and people get so caught\nup about this with like job interviews\nand dating and whatever right there's\nlots of fish in the sea there are lots\nof human beings out there you don't have\nto impress this person that's number one\nright just think to and if you kind of\nscrew it up you screw it up I've screwed\nup many social interactions in my life\nit's like usually people like forget\nabout that kind of stuff second thing is\nthat to remember that often times you\nare a much harsher critic of your\nbehavior than other people are so they\njust see your outsides whereas you are\nbeing fogged by your outsides and your\ninsides right so if you're just like\nquiet and not saying anything you can be\nin tons of internal emotional turmoil\nlike oh my God like I had something to\nsay should I jump in is it my turn to\nspeak because they seem to be talking\nand I have something good to contribute\nbut then like 60 or 90 seconds go by and\nthey've started to move on to something\nelse and now you're like you're like\nbummed because damn it I had a good\nthing to say and I know that I need a\ngood thing to say to participate in the\nconversation but now they've moved past\nit and now should I go back to it that\nmakes things awkward so then you just\nsit there then you think about that for\nanother 30 seconds and then you're like\nwell now I haven't said anything for a\nwhile and I've been awkwardly silent and\nso there you are torturing yourself and\nthe other two people are having a\nflowing conversation they're not really\npaying attention to you so another thing\nis that often times when we are when it\ncomes to confidence our confidence or\nlack thereof is born of a comparison but\nthe problem is that the comparisons we\nmake are Franken stoni and monsters so\nwe don't just compare oursel to one\nperson with like 10 qualities down the\nroad or down the line what we do is we\ncompare we take our weakest quality and\nwe take the strongest person who has\nthat quality and we can make this\ncomparison then we compare to this\nperson's head and this person's feet and\nthis person's career and this person's\nCharisma and this person's money and\nthis person's relationship so we look at\nall these different people and we don't\ndo oneon-one comparisons we don't look\nat the person who makes more money than\nus and we tell ourselves yeah but this\nperson is like a complete train wreck\nwhen it comes to relationships and\nthey've been divorced twice we don't\nthink that way so when it comes to a\nlack of confidence be very careful about\ncomparison and ideally don't compare at\nall you or you and let other people\naccept you or reject you based on that\nand the last thing is if you are\ndeficient in some way improve upon it\nright but you don't need other people's\ncomparisons to show you that you can be\nbetter you can always be better and\nthat's what you should lean into and\ngenerally speaking once you develop\nconfidence and you are shy then that\ntends to solve the problem because then\nyou can go and you're still shy but you\ncan interact with people when you need\nto hey Dr K how do I get my kid to put\ndown the game without it being a fight\nevery single time the problem with\ngaming is that it tricks our brain into\nbeing a substitute for Life once we\nstart to get our Psych olical needs met\nthrough the game that's when we
