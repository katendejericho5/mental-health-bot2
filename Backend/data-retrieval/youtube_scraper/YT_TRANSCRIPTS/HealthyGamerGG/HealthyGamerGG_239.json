righty\nchat my chat Lords chat\nladies chatar and everything in between\nwelcome to another healthy gamer GG\nstream my name is Dr Alo kenoa just a\nreminder that everything we discuss\ntoday on stream is intended to be for\neducational and entertainment purposes\nonly nothing is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice so if youall have a\nmedical concern or question please go\nsee a licensed\nprofessional so we have a couple of\nannouncements the first is Dr K wrote a\nbook and are there any Germans in chat\nbecause\ntoday our book is coming out in Germany\nand I just wanted to show youall how\nawesome I think the German cover is I\nhave no idea what this says I'm going to\ndo my best to pronounce it Zin a g\nwe on PC\nconsole\nhandy isn't that awesome I don't know\nhow I pronounced it I don't speak German\nand so I don't know what this means what\ndo y'all think chat is this good is this\na good cover do y'all like\nit okay I see someone pre-ordered the\nbook so first we put this\ninto Google translate and this is what\nit said detected as German Dr Alo kenoia\ngambling but healthy how parents can\naccompany their children well and\nstressfree when playing on PC console\nand mobile phone great healthy gambling\nso I guess this is also going to be the\nstart of our gambling sponsorship\nbecause healthy gambling right let's go\nall right Dr K gambling stream incoming\nno but seriously\num I think this is super cool uh I I'm\nI'm thrilled I have I think I was German\nin a past life because I love the German\nAndor Austrian culture something about\nit feels very very right to me\num for those of y'all that actually\nspeak German I have no idea if this is a\ngood translation or\nnot gambling is wrong okay thank God\nthank God that our German publisher\nknows because they publish books they\nknow the German\nlanguage\num and so a couple of things I I saw\nsomeone pre-ordered so we actually have\nif yall pre-order we have a special\nQ&A um thing happening for people who\npre-order the book uh I think it's\nhappening I don't know exactly when it's\nhappening but it's happening soon and\nthen the second thing is if y'all um you\nknow have nieces nephews things like\nthat if y'all have uh kids yourself you\ncan definitely get the book but I think\none of the key things to remember is\nthat we so if we've had a couple of\nstreams where we talk about\ncommunication and if you want to learn\nhow to talk like Dr K check out the book\nso the fundamentals of communication\nthat we teach to parents to help them\ncommunicate with their kids are is like\nbasically what I do so if yall want to\nlearn how to be better communicators I\nthink the the core of what we teach and\nif y'all watch me do interviews and\ny'all read the book you will see that\nI'm using all of these techniques so if\nyou kind of want to look at the source\ncode or the strategy behind how Dr K\ndoes interviews check out the book last\nthing is that if yall have parents who\nyou have difficulty communicating with\nyou can use the book for yourself the\nother thing that you can do is get the\nbook for your parents and and check it\nout first right and make sure you're\nokay with it and then what you can tell\nthem is like hey I would appreciate it\nif you could start talking to me like\nthis right so you know how your parents\nbuy you books and they're like oh here\nis a book about how to turn into\nsomething that I want you to be like how\nto discover God 12 steps to embracing\nthe god of your choice right and your\nparents are like we want you to be more\nreligious and let's reverse Uno them\nchat we want you to learn how to\ncommunicate better and listen to what we\nare saying we want you to try to\nunderstand our perspective so our goal\nin the book is basically to and this is\nwhat we do with y'all's parents right so\ny'all's parents call us and they're like\nmy kid is all messed up and we're like\nwe beg to differ we think that you could\nbe doing different things things\ndifferently\nand then what we really try to help them\ndo is to get on your team right so we\nthink that when parents and children or\nwhen spouses or boyfriend girlfriend or\nwhen DM and player take your pick the\nwhole point is that all of the\nrelationships that we have in life we\nwant to be on the same team and there\nare certain things that make it\ndifficult for us to do that whether\nwe're siblings whether we're spouses\nwhether we're parent and child and so\nhow can you understand someone else's\nway of thinking and also how can you\nmodel behavior in such a way where are\ninterested in understanding yours that's\nwhat we really go through in the book so\npart of the reason I wrote this book\nfirst is because a lot of people will\nask us hey how do I learn how to be a\nbetter Communicator like for example\nwe'll have shorts and stuff about you\nknow like we had a really successful\nshort where I was like here is how you\nmake friends so if people are talking\nabout plans and you can just say hey is\nthis an open invitation you can just\nexplicitly ask is this something that\nonly yall are doing or is it an open\ninvitation because I'm here and I'm like\nlistening to the conversation but yall\nhaven't explicitly invited me so I don't\nknow what the [ __ ] am I invited or not\ninvited like and so there's certain\ntechniques we can use but but the key\nthing is that there are some\nfundamentals right so those are specific\nuh pieces of content that I think people\nhave really\nappreciated um but if yall really want\nto understand the fundamentals there's a\nlot of sample dialogue in there\ndefinitely check out the book the other\ncool thing is that just to to in full\ntransparency I'm trying to figure out\nhow to spend my time\nso right now I'm working on two\nadditional books um and then the the\nmain thing is that I need to know we\nneed to know from like almost like a\nbusiness perspective or impact\nperspective the two are somewhat similar\nwhether I should spend more time writing\nbooks and so should I be streaming more\nshould I be writing books more I can't\nreally stream a whole lot more because\nthere's a cap on my voice bluntly um but\nwe're trying to figure out like I'm\ntrying to figure out over the next one\nor two years like what do yall want from\nme\nso I I'm writing one book on mental\nhealth and one book on meditation and\nspirituality that's what I'm like kind\nof working on right now and these are\ngoing to be books for y'all but like we\nneed to know like do you guys want us to\nmake more guides like we have a trauma\nguide that's coming out in a couple\nmonths do y all just want us to make\nmore YouTube videos do you all want to\ndo in-person events and I know\neveryone's going to say like yeah we\nwant everything but basically we look at\nthe impact right how many people are\ngoing to read this book how many people\nare going to buy this book and that\ntells us what is the best methodology\nfor AOE healing so if y'all are\ninterested in me writing more books then\nbuy books if y'all are not interested in\nthat then show up here on stream right\nand we can do both it's just we're\ntrying to figure out like should I spend\nmore time on Research or books this\ndoesn't really cut into stream time\nbecause we're kind of committed to that\nand I I love that and I'm not going to\ngive it up because I miss y'all and I\nwant to talk to\ny'all okay um yeah so we'll continue to\ndo a little bit of everything for sure\nbecause I like that and that's fun but\nit it really it really helps us\nunderstand okay so is my goal going to\nbe write one book a year or is it going\nto be one book every other year like\nthat's what we're talking about right so\nit by 2026 do y'all want two more books\nor do you want one more book I'm going\nto write it whether y'all want me to or\nnot and then I will do my German only\nfans\n[Laughter]\nfiction okay\nend stream please I'm not in the mood\nokay\ndone so that's useful to know right so\nBagel is saying literally literally no\none I know reads books but everybody\nwatches YouTube vids this is another\nthing that we're seeing is like a ton of\nthe books are audio sales audiobook\nsales so it I kind of I think we see\nthat um but it seems like a lot of\npeople listen to books too and by the\nway I narrated The the audio book uh so\nit is it is me that took me a couple of\ndays but it was lots of fun um yeah so\nif you guys are tired of hearing my\nvoice Get Wrecked\nshitties if you want to hear more of my\nsoothing voes you listen to an audiobook\nas you go to sleep then check it out all\nright um guides with workbooks yeah\nwe're working on it right so the guides\nhave exercises and stuff we started\ndeveloping that because yall wanted it\nwe have like we have a lot of exercises\nand stuff we're slowly assembling these\nthings okay um but well noted that yall\nwant workbooks we will work on it yeah\nvoic is on cooldown that's a great oh my\nGod I love this community that's so\nbrilliant yeah voice is on cool down\nthat's a problem um\nokay so let's do a couple of other\nthings so today what we're going to be\ndoing\nis something pretty cool so I don't know\nif we've done this before so what we've\ndone is taken a few of our most\nsuccessful YouTube videos and for those\nof y'all Or Not YouTube videos I mean at\nsome point there were also twitch\nstreams right so that but they they\ncan't live on Twitch forever so we've\ntaken a couple of our most successful\npieces of online content and the cool\nthing about this community is that yall\nwatch content and then you respond in\nsome way and so the cool thing is that\nthere we're going to take some comments\nfrom some of our most successful\nlectures and we are going to address\nthose comments by teaching yall more\nstuff okay so first thing is if y'all\nhaven't seen these videos highly\nrecommend them also the YouTube\nalgorithm and everyone in the community\nalso highly recommends them and we're\ngoing to take some of the most powerful\nand insightful comments or comments that\nare we just didn't take the most upvoted\ncomments because some of them are like\nsuper you know have thousands of of\nupvotes um or likes or whatever we\ndidn't just take those but we we took\nthe things that we felt like there was\nmore to teach on or what is the next\nstep so the challenge with some of our\nlectures is that we'll get you let's say\nfrom step one to step five and then\nsomeone in the comments is like what\nhappens next right so I I still have\nthis problem so that's what we're\nactually going to address\ntoday\nokay um all right so let's take a look\nokay all right so you two I this picture\nis crazy but it is what it is let's just\nmove on I don't know why that's\nthere okay why gifted kids are actually\nspecial needs so this is one of our top\nperforming lectures right so was a lot\nof fun to do um just to give youall a\nquick background I had a couple of\nreally really brilliant supervisors when\nI was training to be a psychiatrist um\nthey prefer to remain anonymous so I\ncan't call them out by name but one of\nthem uh one day in Psychotherapy\nsupervision was teaching me about how\ngifted kids are special needs kids so\nthis is not my idea but said person does\nnot want to be internet famous so she\nprefers to she's like that's cool that\nyou made a YouTube video about it and I\nwas like this is you you taught me this\nand she was like that makes me feel good\ninside\nI'm so proud of you and she's just an\namazing Psychotherapy supervisor right\nso she takes like she's like oh my God\nshe's so supportive and so amazing okay\nbut um so what we're going to do is kind\nof take a look at some of\nthis I will never forget how many\ntimes I felt humiliated by that old I\nexpected higher grades from you speech I\ndidn't sign a contract with anyone who\ntold them to expect me to be something\nthroughout my childhood any sign of\nfailure was synon with a giant drop in\nmy\nself-esteem gifted kid here the biggest\nnegative thing about being treated like\nI was better than everyone else was that\nI still find it really really hard to\nask people for help it kind of feels\nlike I've let someone down by not being\nself-sufficient so this is\nterrifying because the challenge of\nbeing a gifted kid is that we are given\nan\nidentity to live up to we are given this\nidea of\npotential and now we are kind of in a in\na really tricky scenario because we\ndon't get to live a normal life right\nsee if you expect nothing from someone\nand they don't perform that's just a\nregular failure but if you are a gifted\nkid and someone expects a lot from you\nand you underperform even if you perform\naverage right see this is the challenge\nis that performing average or being\nnormal or even being above average is\nviewed is a\nfailure now you live in a world where if\nyou were a gifted kid kid and you\nsucceed and you're at the top of your\nclass this is not a success this becomes\naverage this is a very devastating\npsychological position to put someone in\nwhere the best that you can do is meet\nexpectations you can never exceed\nexpectations and even if you do normal\nyou are letting people down this is\nincredibly damaging and we're going to\ntalk a little bit today about how to\ndeal with this now this is also going to\nbe a little bit different because what I\nreally want yall to do today I'm going\nto say a lot of things that don't\nlogically make sense but are true and\nwhat I'd love for y'all to do today is\ntry to listen to The Poetry of what I'm\nsaying instead of the pros and even if\nthat question that statement is\nconfusing that's exactly what I'm\ntalking about okay so the first thing\nthat we're going to do is understand\npotential\npotential so there's something very\nweird about potential which is that\npotential is by definition\nfalse this sounds very confusing see\nhere we are trying to live up to our\npotential but by definition if I am\npotentially capable of something that\nmeans I have not accomplished it right\nbecause then it isn't a potential\nanymore it is a reality so potential and\nreality are on opposite ends of the\nspectrum so by definition potential is\nfalse\nso the first problem that gifted kids\nrun into is that they are living in an\nartificially constructed world so you're\nnot living in the real world anymore and\nas someone who's worked with people who\nare psychotic and delusional if you're\nnot living in the real world that will\nbe difficult we see this also not just\nwith people who have mental illnesses\nbut a lot of people will live in a\ndelusional State not like clinically\ndelusional so let's just take the simple\ndefense mechanism of denial so if I'm\nworking with a patient who is an\nalcoholic who denies that they have an\nalcoholic problem when you kind of point\nout to them that hey you have acute\npancreatitis and your pancreas is eating\nitself tearing these digestive enzymes\ninstead of digesting food are digesting\nyour own pancreatic cells and when you\ndigest the wall of a pancreatic cell so\na pancreatic cell has a bunch of\ndigestive enzymes inside that it\nsecretes into your stomach and your\nintestinal system then it breaks down\nthis living tissue like meat the moment\nthat you pop the surface or the organel\nof a pancreatic cell all of those\ndigestive enzymes leak out and then they\nstart eating the other pancreatic cells\nwhich in turn leads to a Cascade of your\npancreas digesting itself popping\norganel more it's kind of like if I have\na container that has acid if I have a\nbunch of jars of acid sitting in my\npantry and I eat through the wall of one\ncontainer and then that acid leaks\neverywhere and then leaks into the walls\nof the next acid container and then I've\ngot a spill of acid everywhere that's\nliterally what pancreatitis\nis you're digesting\nyourself and then the alcoholic says I\ndon't have a problem if you are divorced\nfrom reality you're going to have\nproblems whether you're psychotic\nwhether you have a a diagnosis of\nschizophrenia whether you're high on\nmethamphetamine whether you're smoking\nK2 whether you're manic in the cases of\nmental illness or simple psychological\ndefense mechanism or in the most\ncatastrophic case being given\npotential and I've worked with like for\nexample Legacy\nkids so very wealthy families in India\nwill send their children to Boston for\nproper\neducation and these poor kids man they\nthey're so privileged which is great in\na lot of ways but boy there's so many\nexpectations they have to go to Harvard\nthey have to go to MIT some of them end\nup at Boston University they're not\nliving up to their potential oh my God\nNortheastern and their life is\ndetermined from for them they're\nexpected to marry in a particular way\nthey're expected to take this\nmulti-billion dollar family business\nover right so this is like everything is\nset out you I have determined who you\nare before you even exist and before you\nhave any right of\nself-determination this is what we do to\ngifted kids we say you have this\npotential but by definition potential is\nnot reality then it wouldn't be called\npotential right once it is realized then\nit is\nreality there's a second problem with\ngifted kits is that anytime we give\nsomeone a sense of\nidentity if the identity is positive it\ncan be more damaging than the if the\nidentity is negative so we give you an\nidentity that is a potential but that is\npositive and that can be more damaging\nthan a negative identity now this sounds\nreally weird I'll give you all a simple\nexample so if you grow up and you're\nbullied everyone calls you a loser right\nso I was both I was both A Gifted kid\nand I was\nbullied and I've worked with people who\nhave suffered from trauma self-esteem\nproblems low self worth things like that\nthere's one\nreally positive thing about that I'm not\nsaying it's positive on the whole I'm\nsaying there's one advantage that these\npeople have which is that this sense of\nidentity is something that people want\nto get rid\nof see when you get bullied you're like\nI don't want to be a loser anymore\nand when you're uh you know if you're\nsomeone who's been traumatized and you\nhave low self-worth you say I want to\nbelieve in myself I want to love myself\nI want to feel proud of who I am so the\nthe one thing is is a clinician what the\none thing that I have going for me when\nI work with these people is that they\nwant to change this identity which is\nfalse by the way right in both cases\nthey're false because these are\npotentials and so now we've got at least\none advantage which is that we all agree\nthat we want to change so even if if you\nlook at things like motivational\ninterviewing and dealing with denial and\naddictions the goal is to help this\nperson understand that they have a\nproblem so that we want to\nchange the problem with gifted kids is\nthat they don't want to change they want\nto live up to a\nfalsity they don't want to abandon the\nidea of being a gifted kid in fact they\ntry really really hard to preserve this\nidea of being a gifted kid they want to\nlive up to their potential they want to\nbecome something they are\nnot\nbut this is very very difficult because\nonce again you're entering this realm\nwhere the most that you can do is live\nup to expectations and even a partial\nsuccess becomes a failure it is a game\nthat you cannot\nwin and so the whole point is that even\nif you're treated like a loser if you're\nbullied if you have low self-esteem you\nwant to strive to change but the problem\nwith the gifted kid is that they strive\nto become what other people want them to\nbe and this is really problematic\nbecause the strength in life comes from\nwho you are not a false idea of who you\nwant to\nbe right you have to start with where\nyou are it is the the way to get sober\nis not by denying that you have an\nalcohol problem the way to get sober is\nto admit that you have an alcohol\nproblem admit that you're in a bad place\nand then move forward from there move\nforward from where you are instead of\nchasing somewhere where you want to go\nand this we have tons of research about\nthis is my clinic experience that the\nalcoholic who wants to be sober for a\ndecade fails the alcoholic who is\nstruggling not to drink today\nsucceeds but this is the problem with\npotential is how much success gets you\nto your potential it doesn't\nwork because even if you get a B that's\nnot good enough if you start at a c\nmaking a b is progress and when progress\nbecomes a failure in your mind this is a\ncurse you're [ __ ] make\nsense so the other thing that happen\nhappens is that when we have this\nidentity of being a gifted kid we don't\nwant to shed it because then we have\nnothing left so there's another video\nthat we have about how intelligence\nleads to avoidance and so this is what\nwhat generally happens when I'm gifted\nwhen I have this idea of gifted what is\nit mean to be gifted let's understand\nthis to be gifted this person is gifted\nwhat does that mean that means that they\ndon't have to put forth\neffort how do you know the difference\nbetween a gifted person and a Ungifted\nperson oh my god do you see how hard\nthat sweaty nerd is\nworking the harder that the sweaty nerd\nworks the more sweaty that they\nget the more pathetic they\nare and the easier it is to slide\nthrough life without difficulty this is\nthe sign of\ngifted so now you have another problem\nwhich is that anytime you put forth\neffort it comes at the cost of your\ngifted kid identity so you're left only\ndoing the things that are easy in life\nthis becomes a huge problem this is why\nwe create we see this ability or not\nability this pattern in gifted kids of\nhigh acceleration followed by hitting a\ng brick wall I don't study in second\ngrade I don't study in third grade I\ndon't study in seventh grade I don't\nstudy in 10th Grade 11th grade hits now\nI'm in calculus right because I'm in all\nthese advanced\nclasses and then suddenly like I don't\nknow how to\nstudy and I can't afford to study\nbecause if I study who studies really\nhard stupid kids study really hard so\nnot only do you\nhave not living up to your potential as\na failure or at best you meet\nexpectations which means you never\nreally get any positive reinforcement\nright you don't get any positive\nmomentum you're deprived of\nthat second thing that you're deprived\nof is the ability to work\nhard because anytime you work hard\nyou're not gifted anymore so you run\naway from working hard because in order\nto be successful you no longer have to\nbe gifted and then what happens is your\nKN life becomes\nnarrow because you don't do this thing\nthat requires effort you don't do this\nthing that requires effort so the\noptions available to you in life start\nto\nshrink because you can only do what is\neasy and as time goes on as you climb\nthe ranks of life and his life becomes\nharder and harder and harder the number\nof things that are naturally and\neffortlessly easy become smaller and\nsmaller and smaller so your life is left\nwith nothing but this idea of being a\ngifted kid and then we come to the third\nCurse Of Being A Gifted kid which is\nwhat is the other thing that gifted\npeople do or don't do ask for\nhelp because who needs extra tutoring\nnot the smart kid in the class the\nstupid kid in the class and this is\nprobably the most damaging thing is that\nwe teach these children that asking for\nhelp is something that is\nshameful and now we are in a real\nproblem and this is what we see with\ngifted\nkits is that life is a multiplayer game\nit's an mmor RPG where you need a guild\nand you need a party and now you're\ndoing a Lone Wolf Run a solo run but\nunlike all of these beautiful games like\nbalers Gate 3 that give you these Lone\nWolf advantages that's not how real life\nWorks hugging yourself does not give you\noxytocin\nright jerking off is not a healthy\nrelationship like you can't do it on\nyour own like physiologically\nneuroscientifically I'm just using these\ntwo\nexamples right it's really hard to take\ncare of yourself when you've got the flu\nreally easy to take care of someone else\nwho's sick and for that person to take\ncare of you life is a multiplayer game\nit's the way that we've evolved and we\ndeny gifted kids the chance for\nhelp we tell them if you need help\nyou're a loser right and if you're a\ngifted kid and you're listening to this\nyou know exactly what I'm talking about\nother people it's okay for other people\nto get help but I can't why not because\nthey're\naverage they're\nnormies and I wear the mantle of\nexceptionalism so I don't get to get\nhelp and so how do we fix this so I'm a\nrecovered gifted kid\nand the big irony here is that when you\nshed the mantle of being a gifted kid\nyou will become so successful and then\ny'all are I just [ __ ] y'all again\nbecause now you're like okay now I have\nto get rid of this and then I can live\nup to my potential doesn't work like\nthat you really have to get rid of\nit and so this is the\nproblem so let's understand how to fix\nthis so in order to tackle being a\ngifted kid what we have to understand is\nwhat is it literally\nmean what is the mechanistic scientific\nmanifestation the physics the biology of\nbeing a gifted kid where does Being A\nGifted kid actually\nexist now the first answer that people\nwill say is that being a gifted kid\nexists in the minds of others this is an\nexpectation that other people put on\nme that is both true and untrue and what\na lot of people wish is that I wish wish\ndifferent\npeople would no longer expect this of me\nI wish other people would say hey it's\nokay for you to get help I wish other\npeople would acknowledge that I have\nworth even if I don't accomplish but\nthat's not what y'all say as gifted kits\nright let's understand like you probably\nrejected that what you actually say is I\nwish I could live up to their\nexpectations I want to defy their\nexpectations they thought that I had a\n140 IQ I want to have a 160 IQ my\nsiblings all became millionaires at the\nage of 30 I want to become a millionaire\nat the age of 25 you don't actually want\nto defy their expectations you want to\nlive up to\nthem you want to exceed them right why\nit's because you've never been able\nto right you don't actually want to\nchange their\nminds you want to show them that they\nunderestimated you not overestimated you\nand this is how the mind\nworks because when I get an F on a\ntest I don't want a c i want an\nA+ if I get dumped by my boyfriend or\ngirlfriend I don't just want to date\nsomeone else I want to date someone who\nis going to make them feel ashamed is\ngoing to regret it they're going to\nregret ever dumping me I'm going to show\nthem so where do what does it mean to be\na gifted kid so this is the one thing to\nunderstand being a gifted kid is a\ninternal reaction in your mind literally\nwhat it means to be a gifted kid is that\nyour mind will generate thoughts and\nresponses that is entirely what it\nmeans that's it and I'll give you a\nsimple example let's say you want to ask\nfor\nhelp why don't you because of what your\nmind says don't ask for help you will\nfeel ashamed of yourself other people\nwill realize that you're not as special\nas you think you are so in the case of\nbeing a gifted kid what does it\nliterally mean it means that when you\ntry to move forward in some way that\nyour mind generates some kind of thought\nthat keeps you where you are that's\nliterally what it means to be a gifted\nkid if you look at the most minute\nmanifestation of being a gifted kid it\nis a internal reaction to\nprogress no wonder we're [ __ ] an\ninternal reaction to progress\nso being a gifted kid is kind of like\nhaving a ball and chain in your mind\nthat is Shackled to you so it's sitting\nthere with this 50 lb or 50 kg\nball that is tied to your ankle and\nanytime you try to move if you try to\nask for help if you try\nto change people's expectations if you\ntry to admit to people that you're\nstruggling if you even put forth effort\nit's not allowed the only time you can\nput forth\nforth effort is when you know that\nputting forth effort will exceed\nexpectations if you can get a 8.0\ninstead of a 4.0 then you'll put forth\neffort you have to be able to Dazzle EV\nyou have to be able to Dazzle everyone\nin order to be able to do\nanything so to understand if you really\nwant to conquer being a gifted kid\nthere's really one starting step\nwhich is to recognize your mind's\ninternal\nreactions to things that are good for\nyou in progress and what you will find\nis that there's a lot of self-sabotage\nthere there's a lot of emotions like\nshame that keep you\nstuck recognize that it is all\nreactions the second step is any time\nyou see this internal reaction there are\ngoing to be a couple of other features\nof it if your mind tells you that\nsomething won't work for you but it'll\nwork for someone else then you should\nmove towards\nit so this is how you know which\nthoughts are good and which thoughts are\nbad if everyone else is allowed to do it\nthen you should be doing it too\ngenerally speaking right we don't want\nto apply that to jumping off of a cliff\nor whatever but when it comes to things\nlike sharing your feelings getting\nhelp right even the the idea of\nself-determination you ask a gifted kid\nwhat do other people get to be in life\nthey get to be whatever they want but I\ndo\nnot so notice that it is literally a\nreaction secondly try to resist the\nreaction and one of the things that you\ncan do here is just sit with it right\nyou don't have to force yourself to do\nit right away notice the reaction this\nis what's really cool is anytime we\nnotice something in the mind it gets\nweaker literally that's just how it\nhappens the the if you want to decrease\nthe weight of the shackle around your\nankles and the ball that that's tied to\nall you need to do is just notice that\nthe shackle is there noticing leads to\ndissolution there's lots of Neuroscience\nbehind that we've covered that in other\nlectures and stuff we won't go into that\ntoday but that's just how it works also\na yogic\nobservation and then the third thing to\nunderstand is once you start\ndissolving the thought patterns of being\na gifted kid and this is where we go to\nthe science of cognitive behavioral\ntherapy where we have core beliefs and\nautomatic thoughts thoughts so we have\ncertain beliefs about oursel and these\nbeliefs generate automatic responses and\neven in CBT what we do clinically is we\ntry to observe these automatic thoughts\nand as we observe them they become less\nautomatic then we can start altering the\ncourse and then eventually we will\ndissolve our core\nbeliefs\nthen you get to\nself-determination Because the actual\ngoal of being a gifted kid is to be\nnothing this is what I strive for when I\nwork with people who have this\nproblem shed all of the expectations of\nother people and that will\nhurt because if you could live up to\nthem that would feel so good you'll make\neveryone around you happy you have to\nyou're disappointing them anyway just\ndisappoint them fully the only problem\nis that you're half assing it right like\nany gifted\nkid because as long as you half ass it\nyou have an excuse for why you didn't\nsucceed it's the moment that you put\nforth full effort and don't get at the\ntop of your class that you realize\nyou're not the smartest person in the\nclass there are other mechanisms at play\nwhere your gifted kid I mind will keep\nyou stuck sabotages you literally tells\nyou don't put forth 100% effort because\nif you put forth 100% effort and fail\nthen you are really a failure but as\nlong as you have asset you can chase the\ndream that if you had worked hard see\nthe potential is still there if you have\nasset you are Pres preserving the\npotential which is a falsity so all of\nyour mental energy is going to preserve\nsomething that is not even real and no\nwonder you're stuck in life because\nyou're not actually living your life\nyou're trying to preserve a false\nlife so how do we get you have to get\nrid of it and let the shame\ncome have people be there as best as you\ncan so our community is pretty good for\nthis right it's okay you'll survive\ntrust me and if you're concerned about\nnot surviving seek medical\nattention but the beautiful thing\nhappens which is that we don't realize\nthis as gifted kids we think that living\nup to our potential is the goal but what\nwe actually want to do is get rid of our\npotential we want to start living in\nreality and what does this practically\nmean that means make your life a blank\nslate because right now you are trying\nto color in what other people have\nimposed upon\nyou and that's not going to\nwork maybe it works for other people but\nit doesn't work for you is there people\nI've worked with they seem to be doing\nokay but they're\nnot make your life a blank slate it'll\nbe liberating what would it feel like to\nhave no expectations\nawesome why don't you do it because the\nprocess of doing it\nsucks see to get to the top of a\nmountain is very nice to climb from the\nbottom is not so nice this is what it is\nto be a gifted\nkid so you want to make your life a\nblank slate get rid of all of that\npotential and then you can engage in\nself-determination you can't engage in\nself-determination when you're trying to\nlive in up to someone else's\nexpectations and then something\nbeautiful will happen that gifted kids\nhave no idea that this is even possible\nthen you will start to change the\nexpectations of others because a lot of\nthem wish that oh I wish I could change\nsomeone else's\nexpectations so let's understand this\nhow do you change someone else's\nExpectations by being something else\nand there is a period of friction as\nthey align their expectations with the\nnew person that you are see if I want my\nchildren if I want my kid to be a doctor\nas long as my kid is striving to be a\ndoctor even if they don't want to be a\ndoctor and they want to be an artist I\nwill maintain my\nexpectation and so a lot of people are\ncursed in life because you're trying to\nlive up to other people's expectations\nbut you feel burdened by them you can\nnever live up to them they always expect\nso much from you why do they expect so\nmuch of you because you keep on trying\nto tell them that yeah you're going to\nget there one day you playing their\ngame how do you get your parents to\naccept you not being a Doctor by\nstopping trying building your own life\none day they will accept because they\nhave no choice because their\nexpectations are gone because you're not\nplaying the game with them anymore this\nis how you liberate yourself from the\nexpectations of others by becoming\nsomething\nelse this happened with me\nwhen I became a psychiatrist I was\nfinishing medical school and I had done\nwell in medical school and my my family\nwas very happy they're like oh my God\nyou're going to be a great doctor one\nday and you're going to save\nlives and then I told them hey I'm\ninterested in being becoming a\npsychiatrist like I'm thinking about it\nthis is what I told them because I had\nmade a\ndecision and then I got a lot of\nnegative\nfeedback you're going to go crazy you're\ntoo smart for\nthis you should be something else do\nsomething that's actually\nmeaningful how much impact can you\nreally\nmake right and that's just their\nconditioning but in order to defy the\nexpectations of others you need to be\nsecure you have to be\nself-determined because as long as\nyou're nothing on the inside you will be\nshaped by everything on the outside\nbecause there's nothing in here we see\nthat in cases of borderline personality\ndisorder or when this person has no\nstable sense of\nself what other people expect of them is\nwhat they become these people become\nchameleons so how do you start to\nexpress your own color you have to know\nwhat it is on the inside then you'll\nhave the strength to defy expectations\nbecause you know what you are and then\nyou'll truly be free and then something\nreally cool will happen people will\neither accept or reject you but that's\ntheir choice the majority of them will\nactually accept you in my experience and\nby my experience I mean clinical\nexperience and some of them won't which\nis\nokay right so I've worked with patients\nfor example who will come out as gay and\ntheir parents don't accept them and that\nhurts\nbut that is something that you can deal\nwith pretending to not be gay and having\nyour parents accept you is probably\ngoing to cause way more suffering over\nthe course of your life\nI've seen so many people ruin so many\nlives by pretending to be what they're\nnot and when you start to be what you\nare you may disappoint a handful of\npeople but there there's way more people\nthat you're going to make\nhappy so it's very challenging to be a\ngifted\nkid because we get all of this\nexpectation and then our mind gets\nconditioned to it we internal it and\nthen it's not even the expectations of\nothers it's the expectations of\nourselves and this is why we carry it\nwith us wherever we go there's no\nescaping\nit we\ntry and this manifests a couple of\nthings the first is that you can never\nexceed\nexpectations it's either meet them or\nunderperform those are your only two\noptions the second is that you can't put\nforth any effort or ask for help\nbecause this means you're not\ngifted and the Salvation comes in\nrecognizing what is the literal\nmanifestation of being a gifted kid it's\nin\nhere it's all in\nhere and this mind has an idea of a\npotential but a potential is by\ndefinition not\nreality and so you're trying to live in\na false World instead of living in the\nworld that actually exists and that\ndoesn't\nwork so good\nluck and if this gets uploaded\nsomewhere if you have further questions\nask\nthem\nokay\nevery mental health professional I've\never talked to has been like you have a\nlot of self-awareness and I'm like yes I\nactually think that is part of the\nproblem I've come to the point where I\nlistened to this and was able to relate\nto it but my brain says you just think\nthat to feel special you just think that\nto feel special you don't have\ndepression you just want an excuse for\nyour incompetence\nokay\nso we make it sound like self-awareness\nis a good\nthing right oh like this person is so\nunself-aware whereas this person oh my\ngoodness look how self this child is so\nself aware look at how amazing they are\noh my\nGod so here's something to understand\nabout\nself-awareness self-awareness is like\nfire and just like anything else in the\nmind if we are in control of it it is\ngood and if it is in control of us it is\nbad when fire is out of control it is\ndevastating when fire is in control it\nis wonderful we can destroy bacteria we\ncan survive cold\nclimates right we can do all kinds of\nthings if we harness fire the problem in\nour society today is that we don't we\nthink of some mental faculties as good\nand some mental faculties as bad there's\n's no such thing as a good mental\nfaculty or a bad mental faculty there\nare just me mental faculties and whether\nyou are in control of them or not is the\nimportant\nthing right excitement is so good I'm\ntired of being depressed and I want to\nbe excited makes a lot of sense but\nexcitement oh my God I'm so excited\nabout this business idea I'm going to be\nan entrepreneur and then tomorrow I'm so\nexcited about opening a swimming pool\nwhere I charge people whatever so I'm\ngoing to abandon my previous idea and\nI'm going to get to this exciting thing\nI'm so excited to learn guitar and\ntomorrow I'm so excited to learn piano\nexcitement out of control becomes\ndamaging to your\nlife but what about things like shame\nisn't shame bad no there's a reason why\nwe evolved\nshame\nright I mean it's conserved throughout\nthe human species must have some\nfunction so the reason that negative\nemotions hurt so much is because they\nprompt us to\naction the reason we have anxiety is\nlike if I feel fear and anxiety when I\nencounter a mama bear that has just come\nout of hibernation with her two Cubs\nthat fear literally keeps me alive if I\nwas like oh my God what a cute bear look\nat how cuddly that bear is and I run up\nto the bear and I start cuddling it the\nMamba bear will kill me\nliterally what about shame because shame\nhelps us feel makes us feel so\nbad so what does shame do shame induces\nBehavior this is important to understand\nsee when I feel ashamed of getting a be\non a test what is that shame supposed to\ndo if I no longer want to be ashamed\nwhat do I need to do I need to get an\nA so shame actually is the motivation\nfor corrective behavior and Improvement\nin the real\nworld the problem right now is that we\nhave all kinds of artificial things that\nwill trick us into feeling shame like\nsocial media right which shows us\nliterally filtered versions of people so\nthey are showing us false versions of\nreality this is not a real\nperson this is a pixelated altered human\nbeing and then this induces shame but\nthere is no corrective action I can take\nto actually fix that problem so now\nwhat's started to happen is people have\nrealized okay I can trigger shame in\nthese other people\nif I make them feel ashamed then I will\nsell them a\ncosmetic oh you want to look like this\nright so you'll have people who are sell\ncosmetics and then they photoshop their\npictures and literally what are they\ntrying to do there they're trying to\ncreate shame and they say this will if\nyou do this thing you will look like\nthis but the picture is photosho that\nperson doesn't even look like that and\nthey're not maybe even they're using the\nCosmetic or they're not using the\nCosmetic right you literally have people\npeople who will be doing things like\nselling\nsupplements and they'll be injecting\nsteroids and they'll say if you want to\nlook like me buy this supplement you\nlook at that you feel ashamed you say oh\nmy God I want to look like that and then\nyou buy their supplement rutro surprise\nPikachu face you don't look like that\nbecause they they conveniently leave out\nthat they're injecting\nsteroids so what's happened is that\nshame has always been good but now\nthings are getting out of\nwhack and self self awareness is no\ndifferent so this is interesting stuff\nokay so people who have more\nself-awareness are can sometimes there\nare some studies that show that people\nhave high amounts of self-awareness are\nprone to depression and prone to\nsuicidality there's a really interesting\nstudy called the Insight trial that was\nlooking at people who were diagnosed\nwith degenerative neurologic diseases\nthese are things like all uh uh L\nGarrick's disease ALS\nokay so these are like degenerative\nneurologic diseases some sometimes\nthings like huntingtons and stuff like\nthat so these are things where like\nyou're basically your some part of your\nbrain is going to Decay during your\nlifetime and you won't be\nfunctional and the more aware they were\nof the problem the more suicidal they\nwere likely to\nbe and on the flip side we also know\nthat for example the the most rapidly\nacting treatment for depression that we\nhave in our Arsenal is\nketamine what is ketamine it is\nliterally a dissocia of agent so camine\nwas originally developed in\nanesthesia so you can cause this person\nto dissociate while you literally cut\ninto their\nbody this is why we developed ketamine\nto unplug your awareness from your\nbody literally what it's a chemical way\nto unplug your awareness from your body\nand this is the most rapidly acting\ntreatment for depression you can give\nsomeone an ivy infusion of ketamine\ntheir depression will disappear in in\nsome\ncases so self-awareness is not a good\nthing it is like fire it will burn you\nup literally induce things like\nsuicidality and depression if it is out\nof your\ncontrol and the problem is that some\npeople have too much but just like fire\nthe question is whether you can harness\nit or not so some people will sort of\nsay okay so what we need to do is\nliterally reduce the self-awareness and\nthere are clinical reasons for that like\nliterally we'll Infuse people with\nketamine is we're like you're way too\nself-aware bro or girl let's shut off\nthat self-awareness we also see that in\ntrauma with\ndissociation you're way too aware of\nwhat's going on right now you need to\nunplug we also see this in the majority\nof human beings on the planet in smaller\nforms numbness you're feeling bad play a\nvideo game Doom scroll for a little\nwhile forget your life because when you\nthink about your life it's so\ndepressing so this is what we tend to do\nin Western science is that we tend to\nlook at the manifestation of the problem\nand we artificially try to correct that\nand that can be good by the way right\nit's not bad necessarily it's just\nincomplete\nso if we look at things like\nanti-depressant\nmedication one of the functions of\nanti-depressant medication which is also\nanti-anxiety medication if we look at\nthings like ssris is it creates some\ndegree of emotional numbness one of the\nside effects is\nnumbness we literally reduce your\nawareness of what's going on inside\nyou and that has good clinical outcomes\nlike sometimes like we we want to induce\nnumbness right like we want to give\npeople like I don't know pain medication\nwhen we cut into them so there are good\nreasons to use it but what we also know\nfrom studies on Psychotherapy and or in\nPsychiatry is that giving someone a\nnumbing agent and combining it with\nactually fixing the problem or training\nskills has a strong synergistic effect\nwith positive\noutcomes Psychotherapy helps 50%\nmedication helps 50% and if you put them\ntogether you get an 80%\nImprovement right I'm just ballparking\nthe numbers there I I think the actual\neffect size is somewhere in the 40 to 70\nballpark they have a synergistic effect\nbut it's not\nadditive so now the question\nbecomes I have too much self-awareness\nwhat do I do because the default answer\nis numbing\nmyself to reduce my self\nawareness whereas what I would say the\ngoal the real goal long-term goal and\nyou can use medication to get there so\nthat's how I kind of think about using\nmedication is let's use medication so we\ncan stabilize someone so that we can\nhelp them engage in the skills building\nthat is necessary for real long-term\nhealing right so for example if I'm\nworking with a trauma patient will give\nthem medication like prosen which stops\nthem from having nightmares which means\nthat they have a good night sleep and\nonce their brain has a good night's\nsleep wow their ability to engage\nPsychotherapy and their emotional\ndisregulation actually objectively\nimproves so what we really need to do\nmore than anything else is train our\nself\nawareness it's not too much or too\nlittle it is in control or out of\ncontrol and so how do we train our self-\nawareness the first thing is to be aware\nof our self-awareness and what I want\nyouall to really know notice is that\nself-awareness usually has a\nDirection so if we look at this it says\nbut my brain says you just think that to\nfeel special you don't have depression\nyou just want an excuse for your\nincompetence see if you look at\nself-awareness out of control what you\nwill discover is that the self-awareness\nout of control always moves you in a\nparticular\ndirection you selectively self-aware\nthis is what makes it out of control it\nchooses to burn some things and not burn\nother things right it's not cooking your\nfood it's burning down your\nhouse and this is why there's even\nstudies that show that you know the\nhigher your IQ or the the higher your\nanalytical capability the more likely\nyou are to be depressed so the problem\nwith self-awareness is that it can be a\ntool that is turned against\nyou so the first thing to notice this is\nthat generally speaking an awareness out\nof control points always in One\nDirection not just one but maybe a\ncouple and just observe that be like wow\nthat's interesting why is it that my\nself-awareness always counters something\nin this direction and something as\nopposed to Something in the opposite\ndirection and literally what we do in\nPsychotherapy is something called\ncognitively reframing which is that what\nwe do is our our mind automatically\nmoves in this direction and we train it\nto move in another\nDirection and if you are able to\ndiscover this you can sort of check out\nwe have videos on things like some scars\nthat's in Dr K's guide to meditation Dr\nK's guide to depression youall can check\nthat out if you want more details but\nwe'll explain it\nhere is what you will find is that at\nsome point in your\nlife you learned some kind of lesson\nthere's some kind of emotional energy\nthat develops these kinds of thoughts so\nif we look at something like this like\nthis comment\nright so what does this comment tell me\nso you just think that you feel special\nyou don't have depression you just want\nan excuse for your\nincompetence so when I read something\nlike this my first thought is that this\nperson was not allowed to\nfail and this is very common with people\nwho have too much self-awareness people\nwho are\ndepressed is that other people in life\nwere allowed to fail but you were\nnot when you made a mistake people\nblamed you really hard for it when there\nwere things that were literally out of\nyour control you were still blamed I see\nthis with unhealthy\nparenting where parents will say things\nlike oh my God like you know the parent\nis drunk and they get mad at you but\nwhat were you doing you were just\nplaying with your toys you're four and a\nhalf you didn't know what else to do\nbecause by the way yesterday and the day\nbefore you were playing with your toys\nand that was\nfine\nso what we tend to see is that when\npeople are not allowed to fail they're\ntold hey this is not\nacceptable you are responsible for\nthis and when you become responsible for\nit suddenly you're not allowed to have\nan\nexcuse because you view it as an excuse\nIt's not a reason it's an excuse see if\nyou view the things in your life is\nexcuses instead of reasons this is a\nproblem what's the difference\nthe difference is the coloring of your\nmind right if it's acceptable it's a\nreason if it's unacceptable it's an\nexcuse but the thing is the same the\nonly difference between an excuse and\nreason is whether someone is willing to\naccept it so at work you say hey I'm\nsorry I'm late today this thing came up\nif your boss accepts it that's a good\nreason if they don't accept it that's an\nexcuse so it's about the acceptability\nor unacceptability it's not a function\nof reality it's a function of\njudgment so if you have too much\nself-awareness start by noticing how\nselective it\nis start by noticing where did your mind\ncome up with these\nconclusions why did you get trained in\nthis way this way of\nthinking right and were you allowed to\ndo something as simple as\nfail and then what we have to do is the\nprocess of re-engineering our beliefs I\nsee some people are saying glisha\nyeah right this is glisha very good some\npeople are paying attention in our\nmembership\nlectures very\ngood see this is the beautiful thing so\nsome of those lectures that we do we're\nteaching y'all the fundamentals but\nlearning the fundamentals is hard we\nhave to have several several hours of\nstuff to build up to that but if youall\nhave been paying attention you'll notice\nthat all of the things that I talk about\ncan be translated into these building\nblocks basana and\nklista among other things Karma\nDharma\nokay so if you have too much\nself-awareness it's not that you have\ntoo much or too little it's that it's\nout of control and the last thing that\nyou can do is literally train your\nawareness and this is through the pr\nthrough the practice of meditation but\nnot just some mindfulness don't do that\nI you can but this is where I strongly\nrecommend you do something called\nadarana so adhar is a focusing technique\nwhere you put your awareness on a\nparticular object for as long as you can\nand if it wanders away you bring it back\nit can be the breath it can be looking\nat something it can be listening to\nsomething it doesn't really matter so\nthere's one really good Tana I don't\nknow if I have a singing bowl in here\nbut with a singing bowl we used to do\nthis exercise where you can grab a\nsinging bowl and you ring\nit and then you try to pay attention as\nlong as you can and try to detect the\nsound of a singing bow until it\ndisappears and so as it gets quieter and\nquieter and quieter you need to harness\nyour awareness more and more and more to\nbe able to detect it right technically\nthe sound never stops it just\ndecays but the vibrations will continue\nto Decay continue to Decay continue to\nDecay maybe they do stop at some point I\ndon't\nknow right but my understanding is that\nthey continue to bounce off I don't know\nif it ever gets to zero who\nknows maybe a physicist can answer that\nbut your ability to detect it depends on\ntraining your awareness so Doon on a\nsinging ball ring the ball and just\nlisten for as long as you can try to\ndetect it and the good news is if I say\ninstead of just listen\nif your mind is anchored to a particular\ngoal it will be easier to focus your\nawareness so if I tell you listen for\nthe sound as long as you can and you can\neven time it you can say this time I was\nable to detect it for 32 seconds last\ntime I was able to detect it for\n28 okay so the problem isn't too much\nself-awareness it's awareness out of\ncontrol\nokay timely with the the comment um\nso just a quick heads up so we started a\na memberships thing here at\nHG and basically part of the reason that\nwe did that is\nbecause when we do stream content and\nstuff like that that content is kind of\nlike for everyone and and it's I mean\nit's not like restricted but the\naudience that I'm thinking of is anyone\ncoming in and going right so sometimes\npeople join late sometimes people leave\nearly sometimes this is the first time\nthat people are here because we're\ngrowing right and that's not a bad thing\nit just means though that all of the\ncontent must be accessible to basically\neverybody the challenge though is that\nif we make things that are only\naccessible to everybody we can never get\nto\ncalculus we can maybe do Newtonian\nphysics but we can't even get to\nrelativity or quantum mechanics or\nanything like that we have to State at\nthe basic\nlevel and so we started memberships to\nbe able to do Advan things the other\nthing is that we have to\nrespect the content restrictions of\nplatforms so we don't always prioritize\nthat as number one we'll frequently make\nlectures and things like that that are\nvery specific to a group of people that\nwon't be broadly accessible and we're\nhappy with that we'll talk about\nparticular mental health conditions\nwhatever like that's fine at the same\ntime we still have to respect that there\nis an algorithm at play we have to\nrespect that for example if we make a\nvideo on suic de side it will get\ndemonetized\nimmediately and it may impact our\noverall Channel performance because oh\nmy God this person is talking about\nsuicide so there are some realities of\nthe platforms that we live in and in\norder to break free of some of those\nrealities this is part of the reason\nthat we want to do memberships because\non memberships we don't give a\n[ __ ] right it's not about platform\nperformance it's not about getting\nbanned I mean we're not going to do\nthings that get us\nbanned but you know and then the other\nreally cool thing is that part of what\nwe like what I like about it is that see\nwhen we come up with stream topics and\nstuff we'll have some degree of\ninteraction we'll do Q&A and things like\nthat and I I love live live interaction\nit's really\nfantastic but the cool thing is that it\non the membership side basically every\nmonth people are voting for what topics\nI prepare so I'm going to generate four\nlectures a week that are at least 1 hour\nusually around 15 minutes of Q&A and\nthen there's usually one Q&A section for\nall the questions that we don't get to\nso we'll do about four to eight hours of\ncontent per week that is determined by\nthe community so\num\nuh\nuh yesterday um we did a lecture on\nthundra and\nmeditation and then we've got two tiers\nwe've got a $10 tier and a $15 tier and\nthis was really important to us that\num basically like you get all the value\nat the base tier and then if you want to\ngive us extra money you can pay more I\nknow a lot of people when they'll do\nlike patreons or whatever right like\nwhatever whatever thing they do they're\nlike okay you can support us for like a\ndollar a month or $5 a month or whatever\nand you get some emote or some badge and\nthen if you get extra content if you\ngive us $10 a month $15 a month $20 a\nmonth we feel like the opposite is the\nway that we want to do it we want to try\nto deliver the maximum value as at as\naccessible a price point as\npossible and then if you want to give us\nextra money you can give us extra money\nso if you want to help us build\nadditional content and that's the other\nreason that we're doing this is part of\nthe reason that we ask for money for\nthings is because I know it's crazy but\nsome things cost\nmoney even doing things like uploading\nvideos and having like you know we've\ngot a whole stream set up and someone\nhelps me set up this over and all this\nkind all this stuff costs money and as\nyou all know we don't we're we're very\ncareful about the sponsorships that we\ntake and we tend to leave a lot of large\nsponsorship we turn say no\nright\nbut gambling but\nhealthy so sometimes we'll get you\nknow we probably turn\ndown at least seven seven figures worth\nof sponsorships a year which is just\nsomething that we're doing because it\ndoesn't feel right in the moment um and\nI know that a lot of people are also in\nin situations of financial difficulty\nthat's part of the reason that we try to\ndo things\nas uh cost effectively as possible so\npart of the reason that we continue to\nstream and stuff like that we get some\nincome from\nstreaming but I don't know if y'all\nnotice but we we don't do things like\nsubathon or donation drives or things\nlike that we'll do it occasionally if\nthere's a really good reason for it but\nthere's no like sub goal at the top\nright that's not something that we do\nmaybe we'll do it one day who knows but\nwe're really here to try to create AOE\nhealing and we're going to do the best\nthat we can with the resources that yall\ngive\nus and there are certain things that if\ny'all give us resources for it that sort\nof pays for the cost and pays for other\nthings and there's just no way we can\nmake as much stuff unless we start\ncharging for things right the other\nthings are we haven't taken any capital\ninvestment or anything like that which a\nlot of people will\ndo um\nand that's just those are the choices\nthat we've made so far I'm not saying\nthey're right I'm just sharing with\ny'all what we think is helpful or I'm\nsharing with yall what our thinking has\nbeen so far and chances are we've made\nbad decisions like just statistically\nright because we're I'm new at this one\nof the simplest stupid things that I\ndidn't realize is the more free stuff\nyou build the free stuff is fine to\nbuild but the more people that you build\nfree stuff for the more money it\ntakes\nwhich means that free is fine if you've\ngot like five\npeople but free for 5 million is more\nproblematic and the way that a lot of\nstreamers and stuff will make that work\nis by doing things like taking big\nsponsorships but so far we've realize\nthat sometimes the reason people want to\npay us a lot of money\nis we're we're very hesitant about\ntaking a sponsorship that we really\ndon't believe in we may at some point\nright so we may decide at some point\nthat like okay on balance it's okay to\nmake a deal with the devil we're going\nto practice a little bit of blood\nsorcery\nhere and that the financial gain that we\nget will allow us to do more\ngood\nokay um all\nright okay so I\nguess here's what members are\ndoing all right right so I have a group\nof people who live near me and I spent a\nlong weekend with them recently but we\nonly hang out at that once a year\nGathering despite Living 10 minutes from\neach other so I suggested a movie night\nand we're making it happen this Friday\nand oh the vasas have been\nswarming stuff I thought I had worked\nthrough already it's been hard not to\njust flip the table and tell everyone to\nforget it but I'm figuring it out it's\ninteresting to see how when I'm stuck in\na some Scot's emotion it feels like\neverything is going horribly but once I\ncan work through it everything is\nactually going just\nfine so I know that some of these terms\nmay not make sense to y'all so aason as\na mental habit and a suara is something\nis like a ball of undigested emotion so\npart of what we're trying to do is teach\nyall the skills so that you understand\nhow your mind\nworks and once you understand how your\nmind works I don't know if yall have\nbeen in this problem where I invited a\nbunch of people and then my mind tells\nme to cancel or I said yes to going into\nthe social engagement then my mind tells\nme to cancel and we say I have\nanxiety right this is what we'll kind of\nsay oh it's anxiety it's\nanxiety\nand so like that then people will say\nlike oh I how do I fix this anxiety the\ncool thing is if we use some of these\nyogic techniques it's not about solving\na particular anxiety it's understanding\nhow the mind works and then you'll start\nto make a we hope we're really happy\nhappy we didn't know that this was going\nto happen but the reason that we taught\nthis stuff is to see things like this\nright now you're altering the trajectory\nof your life because you made these\nsocial plans you were going to quit and\nnow you're not quitting and now you\nrealize it's fine and then something\nreally cool happens once you realize\nthat it is fine when my mind is\nterrified I do not need to listen to it\nthen your life will start to change\nbecause the reason you say stuck is\nbecause the moment that your mind gets\nterrified you have to give into it the\nmoment that you no longer have to give\ninto a terrified mind then your life\nwill be completely transformed you'll be\nable to determine your own destiny\nbecause you're not controlled by fear\nanymore uh I think I'm going to join the\none I've been hesitating on Game Dev\ngroup in my state at first I figured I\nwouldn't like the people in it based off\nof the one virtual meeting I went to but\nnow I'm starting to realize that the\nhesitance to continue is just aasa it's\njust my mind saying you aren't going to\nfind people you resonate with because\nyou never do so this is exactly what\nwe're trying to\ndo okay and then people are also\nsupportive so strong\nAF so see we don't realize that so much\nof our destiny is controlled by patterns\nin the\nmind we don't realize\nthis we don't know how to study what our\nmind tells us we just accept it is\ntrue and then literally what happens is\nthis holds us back in life because this\nperson has now joined a Game Dev group\nin their state and without this thing\nthey may not have joined that that Game\nDev group and now think about the\ntrajectory of this person's\nlife there are so many things in your\nlife that you want to do but then your\nmind tells you no and you listen to it\nand then you stay\nstuck our goal is to help you here at\nhealthy gamer build a life that is worth\nliving and what is it that gets in the\nway this is a very common mistake\neveryone looks at the world and says oh\nthe world is going to [ __ ] which I don't\ndisagree\nwith therefore I can do nothing that I\ndisagree\nwith if you look at traumatic and\nabusive\nrelationships the reason that someone is\nable to stay in an abusive relationship\nas the abuser the abuser tries to do one\nthing which is convince the victim of\nabuse that they have no\npower the moment that someone convinces\nyou that you have no power that's when\nyou truly lose the\ngame see the game of life like doesn't I\nmean the clock doesn't run out I guess\ntheoretically we all die but not anytime\nsoon right so why do we lose in life\nbecause we give\nup and we don't see it as giving up we\nsee it as struggling with\nanxiety\nbut our mind controls so much of us\nshapes our life because if the mind says\nit's good to do it's safe to do then we\ndo\nit and if you look at all these people\nwho are\ndisciplined right what do they do they\nbasically learn how to ignore their mind\nnow that's one step of the way there I\ndon't think that ignoring your mind is a\ngood idea I advocate for harnessing your\nmind which ignoring it at times is\nokay right so learn how it works\nunderstand its patterns and if I could\ndo one thing like one thing that I would\nreally like to do is develop a mental\nhealth curriculum for\nschools so many of the problems that we\nhave right now are because other people\nunderstand our minds and how they work\nbetter than we\ndo\nadvertisers app developers right there\nare two see most of the world has\nclients some people in the world have\npatience there are two groups of people\nin the world who have\nusers drug dealers and app\ndevelopers think about\nthat so the problem right now the reason\neveryone's like so oh so many advances\nin Neuroscience research on psychedelics\nketamine so many advances in you know\nthese new Psycho psychopharmacology\nthird generation antis psychotics\nadvances in mindfulness all of these\nmeditation apps everywhere\nwe're learning so much about GMO and gut\nmicrobiome we're learning so much in\nscience why isn't mental health getting\nbetter suicide rates are increasing\nrates of depression and anxiety are\nincreasing rates of loneliness are at\nepidemic proportions thankfully the\nSurgeon General is aware of that and\ndoing something about it in the United\nStates despite all of the technological\nadvancement why are we losing the war on\nMental Health we're winning the war on\nCardiology we can do a heart\ntransplant we've got OIC\nwoohooo right we're developing biologic\nagents we can straight up cure certain\nkinds of cancer CML used to be such a\nlethal\ndisease we have these things like rmab\nand stuff like that like these\nmonoclonal antibodies which are helping\nus conquer diseases but we're losing the\nwar on Mental Health why because other\npeople understand our brains and our\npsychology better than we do and they\ncan take\nadvantage so you have a group of people\nwho is running\nrampant taking advantage of your\nmind including platforms like this I\ndon't think they're nefarious I think\nthey just have a\nmandate right increase\nusers that's their mandate that's\nit and how is that different from any\nother mandate if I run a sandwich shop I\nwant to sell more sandwiches I want to\ngive more people sandwiches and these\nplatforms I really don't think I mean\nmaybe they could be but I tend to give\npeople the benefit of the doubt they do\nwhat they think is right they try to\nincrease their user base right that's\nwhat happens in business it's\ncompetition but what we really need to\ncounter that is to teach people about\ntheir own mind because right now they\nunderstand everything about your mind\nyou don't understand [ __ ] about your\nmind they know how to make you buy\nsomething you don't know how to stop\nbuying something they know how to make\nyou play a video game they know how to\nincrease engagement you don't know how\nto stop playing a video game\nthey know how to make you watch\npornography and donate or support or\nwhatever pay this amount for this kind\nof thing on only fans you don't know how\nto stop it what's even more terrifying\nis sometimes the people in your life\ndon't know how to stop it for you I've\nseen marriages fall apart because of\nonly fans because there's an emotional\ncomponent there's an interactive\ncomponent so this is the kind of thing\nwhere my Approach is not okay blame them\nand everyone this is where everyone will\nsay oh my God like we need a ter it down\nwe need to stop them and there's some\nvalue to regulation and putting limits\nand stuff like that I'm not disputing\nthat but that's just not where I come\nfrom I'm a clinici I think it's way\neasier to just train the individual\nlet's give you ammo to fight back let's\nteach you about your mind in a way that\nan app developer can never understand\nbecause your mind is unique which means\nthat an app developer who's trying to\nunderstand your mind they can't\nunderstand an individual they're getting\nclose targeted ads oh my God see they're\ngetting so close targeted advertising oh\nbrilliant but you can understand your\nmind way better and we need to develop a\ncurriculum to do that we're trying to do\nthat one piece at a time here at\nHG\nokay all\nright speaking of\nof how years of porn consumption affects\nthe brain's ability to form\nrelationships okay I'm 31 and recently\nhad a talk with a 20-year-old\ninternational student from the UK\nstudying with a mutual friend at the\nparty and after a few drinks she\nmentioned how the men in her life would\nbasically treat her like a man but would\nthe way she would describe intimacy and\nrelationships would expect her to act\nlike a porn star she was talking about\nthis as if it was a fair trade she felt\nequal in her relationships but only\nbecause her view of intimacy meant she\nhad to do things porn stars would do in\norder to please her man while the men\ndidn't have to do anything in return\nsimilar to how Victoria Secret models\nmade women feel like they needed to look\nthat to be sexy in the era of magazines\nit was enough that it was enough that\npeople at the party of 30-year-olds all\nstopped talking amongst themselves and\nhad to sit her down and tell her this\nwasn't normal she still thought we were\nall joking and just being typical old\npeople but it was really heartbreaking\nhow do you convince someone who grew up\nwith the internet that porn and only\nfans is not reality and when it's the\nonly thing their generation knows about\nsex so this comment is brilliant because\nit speaks to a\ncatastrophic problem in our\nsociety which is that the human race is\nbecoming divorced from\nreality see this is important to\nunderstand we're seeing a rise in\npolitical conflict we're seeing a rise\nin Geo geopolitical conflict nations are\nat War nations are competing against\neach other here in the United States we\nhave no semblance of any kind of\ncooperation like the way that we used to\nhave 30 or 40 years between political\nparties we're seeing more religious\nconflict we're we're seeing gender\nconflict so conflict in the world is\nrising and why what's happening in the\nworld today where conflict is rising so\nmuch in every Dimension that you look\nat the reason that we used to be able to\npatch things up is because both of us\nwe're playing from the same\nreality see if I'm playing a game of\nTess with you but I have one board State\nlet's say I'm playing online chess and\nmy game is\nlagging and so my board state is\ndifferent from your board State what's\ngoing to happen we're going to start\nfighting oh I just took your queen and\nyou're like no you didn't my queen isn't\nin that square my queen is over here\nwhat the [ __ ] you're\ncheating that doesn't work see in order\nfor there to be any\nchance of conflict resol\nolution we must live in the same\nreality you're having an affair no I'm\nnot I took out the trash no you\ndidn't I told you about that last week\ndon't you remember no you didn't say\nanything see anytime human beings don't\nlive in the same reality there's going\nto be conflict that's inescapable it's\nnot some great psychological like I\ndon't I mean I don't have no studies to\nPro that but I'm sure that that's true I\nmean I do have studies actually now that\nI think about it right so you can look\nat like methods of marriage counseling\nand what do we do in marriage counseling\nso I'll give you all just a simple\ntechnique that we use in marriage\ncounseling that's really really hard to\ndo feels very cognitively difficult but\nworks really well so anytime I'm doing\ncouples counseling I'll teach both of\nthe couples a technique which is anytime\nyour partner says something before you\nrespond to them you need to repeat back\nwhat you heard\nso you have to repeat your understanding\nof their words before you counter it\nit's very difficult to do and sometimes\nit takes weeks because anytime you hear\nsomething from your partner you\nautomatically respond with why you think\nthey're wrong and why you think you're\nright you never even stop to make sure\nthat you\nlisten that you heard what they're\nactually\nsaying and something beautiful\nhappens once you stop to understand the\nreality that your partner is living in\nand they stop to understand the life\nthat you are living in the reality that\nyou're living in now at least we're on\nthe same field right we have the same\nboard State we can still disagree about\nwhether this move is right or this move\nis wrong but the whole problem is at\nleast we have the same reality that\nwe're living in and what's going on\nright now there's a really interesting\nset of research on something called\nonline\ndrift which is that anytime you click on\nsomething on a platform you get engaged\nwith an\nalgorithm and what happens with these\nalgorithms is that over\ntime the emotional engagement the\ndopaminergic engagement will build up a\ntolerance so if I watch one video of a\ncat that will be\ncute but the second video of the cat\nthat I watch that is exactly the same\nwill not lead to the same enjoyment so\nI'll give you all just a simple example\nwhen you watch a video on internet how\nmany times in a row do you watch it if\nyou want to spend an hour scrolling on\nthe internet do you watch the same video\nover and over and over again for an hour\nof course not that is crazy Dr K what\nthe hell are you talking about I never\nwatch something more than once why\nbecause there is a tolerance to a signal\nthat develops so in order to avoid that\ntolerance you need a stronger signal and\nthis is what the internet has discovered\nright they were not trying to be\nnefarious what they realized is you\nwatch One Piece of misogynistic content\nwe need to serve you more misogynistic\ncontent because that's what you'll\nengage in if I serve you one piece of\nmisandrist content I need to serve you\nmore and more pieces of mandress content\nto get you engaged and they also figured\nout something really\ncool is that if you're a misogynist to\nreally improve your engagement we need\nto serve you miss Andress\ncontent and if you're a mandress what we\nreally need to serve you is misogynistic\ncontent look at all those other people\nand how mean they are oh my\nGod if you're a liberal you'll get some\ncrazy conservative Echo chamber content\nevery now and then or even a\nlot because the platforms have learned\nif we can piss you off you're not going\nto move to a different platform this is\nonline\ndrift and so as we watch this human\nbeings we're sort of wired in a stupid\nway the stupidest most idiotic\nevolutionary wiring which is that\n[ __ ] we're so dumb that what we see\nthrough our senses is what we think an\napproximation of reality is right I know\nit's dumb but if I'm like walking down\nthe street and I see a tiger I think oh\nmy God there's a tiger if I'm walking\ndown the street and I see a dog poo poo\nin the middle of the sidewalk I'm going\nto step around that dog pooo I'm not\ngoing to step on top of it because oh\n[ __ ] my dumb brain when it perceive\nsomething it thinks it's\nreality now the problem\nis that what we are perceiving is highly\ndifferent and as we perceive different\nthings we start to live in different\nrealities and this is why we have a\nproblem with gender Dynamics today this\nis why we have a problem with\npornography this is why we end up with\nthings like this someone's asking how do\nI convince someone that this is wrong\nthe first thing is that you cannot\nconvince them that this is wrong because\nhow do you know you are\nright and they are\nwrong right maybe you are just old\nmaybe this is the way that their whole\ngeneration does\nit right I've been told\nthis that the truisms of dating for my\ngeneration are no longer true this is\nnot how girls are Dr K bruh you don't\nknow what it's like now\nbruh you have no idea what guys are like\nthere are no good ones\nleft everyone's into these misogynistic\ncontent creators and this and that and\neveryone watches too much porn and\nwhatever where did you get that\ninformation because of the content that\nyou watch\nright how many how many people's lives\ndo you get an insight into because of\nthe content that you watch and how many\npeople's lives do you get an insight\ninto because of your interactions with\nthem chances are you\nencounter hundred times more human\nbeings on the internet and they give you\nan idea of their life than you encounter\nin real\nlife how many porn stars have you\nwatched and how how many people have you\nhad sex\nwith and a stupid\nbrain when a when our brain sees a\nhundred men women whatever enjoying this\nkind of sex and we've had sex twice in\nreal life with two different people or\nwe've had two romantic Partners which\none we have a 100 data points over here\nand we have two data points over\nhere stupid brain it values the 100 data\npoints over the two data\npoints D\nbrain so we construct an idea of reality\nbased on what we consume and the problem\nis that we're not consuming reality\nwe're consuming a version of it we're\nconsuming propaganda we are consuming\nliterally stuff that has been\ncrafted literally crafted\nedited a 25-minute pornography video can\ntake 6 hours to to shoot you're not\nseeing the 6 hours you're seeing 25\nminutes and so when someone says I can't\nhow do I convince this person I think\nthat there are a couple of practical\nthings we're going to say so the first\nis to understand the person first right\nso this is actually like literally the\nproblem that we have with how to raise a\nhealthy gamer is we have a generation of\nparents who are like how do I convince\nmy kid that video games are ruining\ntheir life\nand this is where we say you can't but\nhere's\nhow right we say first you must\nunderstand and Dale Carnegie said this\nreally well he said if you want to\nunderstand if first seek to understand\nthen seek to be\nunderstood so understand them first and\nanytime I look at like conflict right so\nfor example there's stuff going on in\nGaza right now and I'm not trying to\ntake sides but the one thing that I\nnoticed is that very few people are\ntrying to understand the other side\nevery every all the content is these\npeople are wrong no one is ever\nasking why do these people believe this\nwhat is the data set that they're using\nit's not what is the data it's just\nthey're wrong everybody else is wrong\nand I'm right no wonder the world is\ngoing to [ __ ] we've stopped trying to\nunderstand each\nother so if you know someone in your\nlife who you think that they're very\nwarped and we see these posts all the\ntime people will reach out to us for\nhelp my boyfriend husband whatever is\ngoing down this\npipeline my wife girlfriend whatever is\nlike becoming a like really toxic\nmisandrist feminist person who thinks\nit's okay to emotionally abuse me\nphysically abuse me whatever we get all\nthese kinds of stories right and this is\nwhere if your reaction is oh my God like\nmen are worse or women are worse like\nthat's what I mean it's like based on\nwhat the reality that you're consuming\nyou're going to believe one or the\nother and this is where we don't really\ncare about I mean we do but generally\nspeaking we're not so concerned that oh\nwe're not going to help this person\nbecause this person has it worse like as\na medical doctor breast cancer is way\nmore common than testicular cancer but\nwhen someone shows up with testicular\ncancer we don't say Hey [ __ ]\nyou breast cancer is more common right\nyou help anyone who asks for\nhelp it's not about who has it worse and\nI've seen this as a psychiatrist where\nlike whether you've had really bad\ntrauma or just moderately bad trauma\neveryone deserves help\nso the first thing is to understand\nwhere is this person getting this\nidea and the second thing is to offer\nyour\nperspective and often times the one\nmissing piece here is that when people\nconstruct a particular reality they\ndon't realize how much hand they have in\nconstructing it so this we see all the\ntime as a\nclinician right so\nthis person has arguably an unhealthy\nrelationship with the men in her life\nbut the question is how does she select\nthose men in the first\nplace\noh right this is where a lot of times if\nwe I mean even when I work with people\nlike incels it's like oh yeah all women\nare mean or whatever women always take\nadvantage of my feelings but then it's\nthe question is like what happens when\nyou like how do you select the women who\ntake advantage of your\nfeelings\nright the women who take advantage of\nyour feelings are the ones that will\nwhen you tell them you love them they\nwon't have the respect for you to end\nthe\nrelationship they will maintain the\nrelationship and continue to take\nadvantage of your emotional energy\nwithout\nreciprocating the decent women will\nrealize this is not what I want from\nthis relationship so I'm going to end it\nso the only women that you're you end up\nwith are the ones who are going to take\nadvant Vantage of\nyou I see this a lot with patients who\nhave abusive relationships where we know\nthat plenty of studies show that if\nyou're abused as a kid you're going to\nend up abused as an adult and why is\nthat it's because the people that you\nselect in your\nlife right so this is the kind of thing\nwhere it's like if you're in this\nsituation\nand people are expecting her to act like\na por porn star but don't do anything in\nreturn the question is why do you\ncontinue a relationship with that\nperson right there's something keeping\nyou there so this is something that a\nlot of times we\nforget this is what I've learned as a\npsychiatrist I feel like I'm talking a\nlot about clinical experience see I used\nto think that people who were in abusive\nrelationships were\nstupid that was the height of my\narrogance what I've come to now realize\nis that if someone is in a bad\nrelationship all human beings only do\nthings that are good for them this is\nnumber one how we're wired\nevolutionary so the question is why\nwould someone stay in an abusive\nrelationship it's because what they get\nout of the relationship is worth more\nthan the abuse that they\ntolerate oh I used to be so arrogant\nthinking this is wrong no I didn't\nunderstand that in order for you to\nengage in an abusive relationship you\nmust be getting something else that is\nworth the\nabuse why do people stay in shitty jobs\nbecause quitting is not an\noption because I have children to\nsupport and I can't afford to not quit\nthat's why people stay in shitty jobs\nwhy do people stay in shitty\nrelationships because the the\noverpowering loneliness and suicidality\nis only kept at\nBay when someone makes me feel like I'm\na decent human being because I do what\nthey want me to do in bed and I don't\nwant to do it but at least I get\naccepted by one person all I have to do\nis something that I'm sexually\nuncomfortable with but at least they're\nthere at least they accept me they don't\nreject me and every other person on the\nplanet is rejecting me I have no one\nleft this is the one person that I have\nand this is why abusers what they do is\nthey isolate people this is how they\ncreate the abusive relationship see when\nI'm the only person that you have left\nand I'm abusive you have to stay with me\nbecause the other alternative is no one\nand you need\nsomeone so the more that someone gets\nisolated the more the abuse can\nescalate very\nsimple and the really crazy thing here\nis why don't people just make friends\nwith healthy\npeople I'll tell you why and we'll see\nright right now can y'all\nguess because of this but my brain says\ndot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot not\nthis in this particular case but because\nmy brain says if this person is nice to\nme they're going to end up abusing\nme because that's what my parents did\nright they apologized and they got me\nlots of gifts and then they were\nphysically abusive the next day\nbecause it's terrifying to be with\nsomeone who may actually be a decent\nhuman being it's very scary if you've\nnever seen it\nbefore see this is something that we\nunderstand as human beings when we see\nanimals so we'll see some abused cat or\ndog that's cowering in the corner\nthere's very heartwarming videos on Tik\nTok or whatever of like you know like\nsome human being sits next to them and\nover time you know it's a it's a 60c and\nshort which happened over the course of\na month which makes us feel really\ngood but what does it take to rewire\nthat dog we'll see this over the course\nof years even oh look at this dog and\nhow healthy it is now it makes us feel\nso good what does it take for a dog who\narguably has a less sophisticated\npsychology than we do it takes\nunconditional patience love and respect\nfrom a human being including meeting all\nof your material needs\nfor\nmonths in order to win over a\ndog and we wonder why are abused people\nstill abused and why don't they get\nbetter because which human being has an\nunconditional amount of time energy love\nmeeting your material needs to help a\nhuman being trust other human beings\nagain no\none no one has that kind of time no one\nhas that kind of energy because I have\nmy own [ __ ] that I'm dealing with and\nI'm not respons responsible for you\nyou're responsible for\nyourself Independence in\nequality you take care of you I'll take\ncare of\nme so I was working with someone at a\ntech company and they had this\ninteresting phrase f i\ni oh sorry F\nI [ __ ] you I'm\nvested so they worked at a very very\nlucrative tech company where once your\nstock options vest there was basically\ngeneration of employees that were set\nfor\nlife and so their attitude is [ __ ] you\nI'm vested so I'm set you can go do\nwhatever you want to I don't give a [ __ ]\nthis is the attitude that we have in\nlife I'm going to take care of mine and\nyou take care of yours maybe when I take\ncare of mine I will be\ncharitable and that's good like don't\nget me wrong charity isn't\nbad but the whole point is that that\ndoesn't work right we need someone to\ntake care of you today we need someone\nto give you a hug today we need someone\nto give you support today we can't wait\nuntil some people win the game of life\nand then what percentage of them are\nDain to be charitable to the rest of us\nand I'm not trying to dog them for their\ncharity it's good that they're being\ncharitable but I'm saying what would the\nworld look like if we didn't wait to win\nthe game to become\ncharitable right now we have a society\nwhere if I've got I'm going to wait\nuntil I'm full and I'm going to give my\nleftovers to someone else we have very\nfew people who say I have one sandwich\nyou can have half and all stay\nhungry this is the world that we live in\ntoday and there are other complications\nthere because even if you get Financial\nSecurity someone can take it away and\nthis is a very real threat by the way\nbecause the moment that you get money\nlike people will start suing you so even\nif you have money everyone thinks so\nyou've won the game of life if you have\nmoney you haven't won the game of life\nin a lot of ways notorious b had it\nright if I quoting this properly mow\nmoney bone\nproblems you can look at this a really\ngood example of this is look at lottery\nwinners lottery winners will end up\neverywhere from destitute to\nmurdered statistics on lottery winners\nare really\nbad and we think money solves all of our\nproblems and I'm not saying that money\nwill solve a lot of people's problems\ndon't get me wrong it helps with\nsecurity it helps with mental health\nit's very\ngood but the basic problem that we have\nis that people aren't taking care of\neach\nother\nokay so kind of going back to this\noh you know how do I convince people I\nthink you first have to start by\nunderstanding their perspective\nand then try to give them alternate\nreality\nexperiences right so like this is the\nkind of thing where I don't know if you\ncan convince someone that their\nrelationship is wrong but if there's a\ngroup of 30s somethings who's talking to\na 20-some sharing with the 20 something\nwhat your experience of life is so if\nthere are other women in the group who\nsay this is what my romantic and sexual\nrelationship is like this is what my\nromantic sexual relationship is like\nthis is the way and there are dudes in\nthe group who say this is how I treat my\ngirlfriend or wife or whatever and then\nthey'll start to see a different reality\nyou just have to show them your reality\nand you have to understand\ntheirs okay my porn use is a direct\nsymptom of never having had a\nrelationship is there still hope for me\nto mitigate this\ndependency the way things are going in\nregards to the state of relationships\nprobably not but miracles happen I guess\nas a young male and a declining consumer\nof porn I have mixed bag bag of thoughts\non it on the one hand I don't believe\ncorn BL blah blah blah okay so let's\ndeal with the top one first\nokay so is there still hope for me to\nmitigate this\ndependency so the answer to this\nquestion like most questions in life is\nit\ndepends see sometimes we have this\nproblem of chicken or egg I watch porn\nthat makes it hard for me to engage in\nrelationships I don't have a\nrelationship so I watch porn this is a\nvicious cycle so the good news is that\nanytime you have a vicious cycle it\nmoves in both directions because this is\nbasically a law of physics I think it\napplies to psychology as well I'll give\nyou a simple example of this so in\nPsychiatry we have this concept of dual\ndiagnosis so you have a patient who has\nsomething like a mood disorder like\nmajor depressive disorder and they have\nsomething like a chemical dependency\nlike alcohol use disorder and for a long\ntime people were wondering which one do\nyou treat first because the more alcohol\nyou drink the more your mood will worsen\nand the more your mood worsens the more\ndependent you become on alcohol for\nemotional regulation and the answer is\nyou've got to treat both at the same\ntime it isn't which one comes\nfirst so when I work with people who\nstruggle with pornography addiction what\nI tend to find is that you have to work\non both fronts at the same time so a\nhealthy relationship will help you\ndevelop a healthy relationship with\npornography and a healthy relationship\nwith pornography will help you develop a\nhealthy relationship with another human\nbeing both are\ntrue you just have to flip the\ncycle so so often times what this means\nis emotional regulation is at the root\nof\nit so I'll give you all a simple example\nof\nthis so let's say that I've never had a\ngirlfriend so if I think about all the\nthings that I do in order to get a\ngirlfriend or\nboyfriend will come with some emotional\ndifficulty anxiety low self-esteem shame\nand now the problem is that when I feel\nthose emotions I have one really good\ntool at my disposal which is pornography\nbecause it shuts down my emotional\nthinking it shuts down my lyic system it\ngives me some sense of dopamine it gives\nme some sense of some sense of relief so\nthe problem is I'm kind of stuck because\nif I try to engage in a relationship it\nfeels emotionally painful and sometimes\nit is very emotionally painful because I\nget rejected and whatnot and then I have\none thing I have one safe place to go\nwhich is pornography so as long as this\ndynamic exists it's very hard to\nchange but if the dynamic changes your\nwhole life will change and this is why\nwhy when I work with people who have\npornography problems usually I focus on\ntwo things there are basically two\nimportant things that most people who\nstruggle with porn addiction are missing\nin their lives and if they can build\nthese two things a porn addiction will\nmelt\naway the first is emotional regulation\nskills so let's understand why the first\nthing is that as you engage in emotional\nregulation skills your need for\npornography will go\ndown the second\nthing is that as you engage in emotional\nregulation skills the things that keep\nyou trapped with pornography become\neasier to deal with so if I can regulate\nmy emotions and I no longer need porn to\nmanage my anxiety that means now I have\na way of tech managing anxiety once I\ncan manage anxiety Then I can go on a\ndate more easily so you get double bang\nfor your buck emotional regulation is\nthe start of\nit second thing is building a meaningful\nlife so we know that there are a couple\nvariables that strongly correlate with\npornography addiction and\nmeaninglessness is one of them so you\nhave to have a reason not to jerk off\nbasically right so if you look at people\nwho are very addicted to pornography\nthey often times have some emptiness in\ntheir life there are absolutely people\nwho are addicted who have healthy Rel or\nnot healthy but they have relationships\nthey have fulfilling careers not\nfulfilling but they have successful\ncareers and arguably successful\nrelationships so you can absolutely be\naddicted without this stuff but\ngenerally speaking the more\nmeaninglessness you feel in your life\nthe more likely you are to be addicted\nto pornography and there's research to\nsupport that it's one of the two\nvariables that correlates very tightly\nso second thing that we have to do to\novercome pornography is build a life\nthat's worth living this is also where\nthe emotion regulation skills come\nin the other cool thing is that as you\nbuild a life that is worth\nliving then what happens is it becomes\neasier to\ndate because now you have a life that is\ngood and hopefully full in some way and\npeople will be attracted to that people\nwill want to be a part of\nthat you'll have you'll have confidence\nyou'll have respect you'll have some\nbuffer against\nrejection right and like I've never seen\na dating profile that's like hey I'm\nlooking for someone who's like an\nabsolute loser and going nowhere in life\nand has no Direction that's what I'm\nreally looking for that's not what\npeople are looking for why why aren't we\nlooking for that because we don't have\nthat and we're hoping if we start dating\nsomeone they can pull us\nalong\nright I'm looking to date someone who\nhas their [ __ ] figured out because I\ndon't and one of us in order for this\nrelationship to succeed has to know what\nthe [ __ ] they're doing and has to have\nsome degree of\nstability\nright why are you all even listening to\nthis because yall have a perception that\nI have my [ __ ] figured out so we're\ngoing to go listen to the people we're\ngoing to associate with the people we're\ngoing to learn from the people who have\ntheir [ __ ] figured out right do I have\nmy [ __ ] figured out I'll leave that\ny'all to you all to judge\nokay so in terms of pornography you have\nto build a life that is worth living and\nthis is what's so confusing because as\nhuman beings when we see a fire what we\nthink is how do I put out the\nfire we don't think about how do I stop\nfeeding the fire right everyone's like\noh like you know so there's like an oil\nfire people will pour water over it\nwhich just creates more problems instead\nof what you need just cover it with a\nlid de deive the oxygen so if you want\nto conquer pornography addiction you\nneed to starve it deprive it of what\nkeeps it\ngoing because trying to fight against\nthe pornography addiction doesn't work\nthis is like pouring water on an oil\nfire it just amplifies things and let's\nunderstand why so anytime I try to\nconquer the porn addiction the first\nthing is that there's conflict in the\nmind there's tension in the mind and on\nsome days I win and on some days that I\nlose so let's understand what happen s\non a day that I win I feel good about\nmyself but for how long just until the\nurge arises again and my if I had a 100%\nwillpower success rate I wouldn't be\naddicted in the first place so we're\nstarting from a situation where our\nwillpower has a 50% chance of\nwinning and then what happens is I win\ntoday and I lose tomorrow what happens I\nfeel ashamed of myself I beat myself up\nbecause I did it yesterday why can't I\ndo it today the more that the negative\nemotions increase the more I'm feeding\nthe\naddiction self-judgment shame the more I\nsabotaging now that I feel ashamed of\nmyself I feel pathetic I feel powerless\noh my God let me make a dating profile\nhi my name is Olo I'm pathetic I'm\npowerless I'm addicted to porn on some\ndays I do a good job on some days I do a\nshitty job we don't make that kind of\nprofile because no one's going to date\nus so instead what do I do I put the\nbest foot forward right because that's\nwhat everyone tells me put your best\nfoot forward be your best you and then\nyou pretend to be something and then you\nshow up on your date\nand here you pretended to be this thing\nbut on the inside here's me I'm pathetic\nI'm ashamed I'm whatever I'm\nweak and then the human being who's\nsitting across from you detects the\ndisconnect and what we need for\nrelationship building is usually some\nsense of authenticity or a very very\nvery good way of concealing yourself you\neither have to be very sociopathic so\nthis is the problem with pornography\naddicts is they're not sociopathic\nenough\nthey're not tricky enough their emotions\nleak\nout so now we create this situation\nwhere like I'm winning on some days I'm\nlosing on some days I'm increasing the\nshame the more I increase the shame the\nmore I lean into pornography the more I\nlean into pornography the more cascading\nnegative effects it has on my\nphysiology I can't engage in\nrelationships so interestingly enough\none of the B biggest things that I work\non when I'm working with someone with an\naddiction is to not solve the\naddiction in isolation by all means try\nto cut back build emotional regulation\nskills but don't stop living your life\nbecause you're addicted to pornography\nstart building a life\nanyway and if we can do that we can make\na vicious cycle in the other direction\nso we have a saying in Psychiatry that\nall boats rise and fall together not\njust Psychiatry\nmedicine so when you get heart\nfailure you'll get kidney problems\ncardiorenal\nsyndrome when you have heart failure\nyou'll get lung\nproblems when you have lung problems\nyou'll strain the\nheart see when fluid fills up in my\nlungs I can't absorb oxygen as much if I\ncan't absorb oxygen as much my blood has\na lower level of oxygen if my blood has\na lower level of oxygen I need more\nblood to oxygenate my cells if I need\nmore blood to oxygenate my cells then my\nheart has to pump faster and harder\nnow I've created a huge problem because\nnow the heart is working\nmore where does the heart get the oxygen\nbecause now we've increased the\nphysiologic demands on the\nheart so it's working more with less\noxygen then what happens is the heart\npoops\nout as the heart poops\nout it sends less blood through the the\num the lungs which in turn so it's\npumping power decreases as the pumping\npower decreases in the left ventricle\nthen what happens is our pulmonary\ncirculation backs up even more and we\nget more fluid in the lungs same thing\nphysiology psychology all the same it's\ncool like that but the good news is that\nwe can fix everything together as you\ndevelop some meaning in life as you\ndevelop some emotional regulation skills\nyou will be more attractive and the most\nimportant thing to learn if you're\naddicted to pornography is not to wait\nto move forward in\nlife see the biggest problem mistake\nthat people make is they say I have to\nfix this then I can do this doesn't work\nlike that that's how you want it why do\nyou want to fix one problem before you\ntackle the next because you want that\nsecond problem to be\neasy you look at that problem you say\nthis is hard I want to make it easy so\nlet me fix this\nfirst the reason we try to sequentially\nsolve problems in our life is because we\nare afraid of the difficulty\nwe are afraid of the\nfailure the more that you accept that is\ngoing to be hard and you are going to\nfail and I am not going to let that stop\nme this is when everything will turn\naround this is also what we know all\nboats rise and fall\ntogether this is what's cool so in the\ncase of cardiopulmonary failure we're\ngoing to give\ndeoen we're going to increase the\ncontractile strength of the heart we're\ngoing to give l Cil we're going to in\ndecrease the blood pressure that the\nheart is pumping against we are going to\nstart fixing the problem and as we fix\nthe problem as we increase the\ncontractile strength of the heart as we\ndecrease our peripheral blood pressure\nthe pressure goes down the heart starts\nto relax as the heart starts to relax\nits oxygen demands go down as its oxygen\ndemands go down it starts to do\nbetter as it starts to do better it\npumps more as it pumps more the fluid\nthat is backed up in our lungs decreases\nas the fluid that backs up in our lungs\ndecreases we get more oxygen transfer\nnow our blood is more oxygenated which\nmeans the heart has to work less less\nhard because now the blood is full of\noxygen so I don't have to pump twice as\nmuch as I don't have to pump twice as\nmuch ah cool now the heart can\nrelax we can reverse the\ncycle in both scenarios in Psychology\ntoo if we can cut back on your alcohol\nconsumption your depression will get\nbetter if your depression gets better we\nwill you will naturally cut back on your\nalcohol\nconsumption solve both problems at the\nsame\ntime am I screwed\nno can you fix one problem no can you\nfix both problems\nyes if you work on them at the same\ntime biggest mistake we make is we try\nto fix one thing at a time\nyou have fix everything all at once in\nthe capacity that you\nhave right so you don't have to fix\neverything all at once but work on\neverything work on multiple things a day\nthat's when you'll really start to see\nchange\nokay last\none I'm tired but this one's too\ngood so I mixed feelings about this\nvideo I made a video that was kind of\ninspired some time ago about why therapy\nsucks for men and I say this as a\npsychiatrist and in the video I even\ntalk a little bit about how to get the\nmost out of\ntherapy this is the video that in some\nways I\nfelt the saddest to make that this video\nhad to be made and also that people\nresonated with it so much this really\nshowed me how challenging the world we\nlive in\nis um also interestingly enough you guys\njust look at the you know 2.5 million\ntwo years ago 1.9 5 months ago if you're\nsomeone who looks at YouTube performance\nyou will say wow this video is a\nresounding success this video terrifies\nme I wish this video failed I'm\nserious I would rather have this video\nfail and people not resonate it then\npeople resonate with it this much this\nis scary so let's look at some of the\ncomments I've had male and female\ntherapists the ones that did the best\nwork with me were always paternal IMO\nthey didn't how does that make you feel\ntoo much they said you're in a cycle or\nhow can you overcome the way that you\nfeel about or interact with this so you\ncan be better so you can better your\nlife they understanding but\nstraightforward compassionate but\ncorrective even when I want to just\ncomplain and vent and blame my sad\ncircumstances or my abusers I'm told\ninstead you have experienced tragedy but\nI'm here to help you get stability not\nrub your back through crisis the\ndialogue ultimately encourages and and\nfocuses on action or at least proactive\nmental overhaul and I believe this is\nthe healthy Middle\nGround I've never been to therapy or\nanything but the few therapists and\npsychologists I've known over the years\nhave completely put me off of average\ntrying the fact that none of them were\never solution oriented is what keeps me\nfrom ever going what I honestly need is\njust solutions to things I don't know\nwhat my problems are in my hangups I\nusually just need someone to tell me\nhere's how you fix it and then push me\nto fix it\nokay they go on to talk about how their\ngirlfriend did that so let's understand\na couple things about\ntherapy the first is that the the field\nof therapy is currently being being\nthreatened by the field of\ncoaching so I hear this a lot when I\ntalk to my colleagues who are therapists\nthere's almost always this like\ndefensiveness and I remember like you\nknow reading some some supervision cases\nand things like that where a therapist\nwas saying like you know my patient came\nto me recently and said that my coach\nreally helped me with this problem and I\nfeel a lot better now and the therapist\nfeels bad because they say we've been\nworking on this problem for two years\nyears so this therapist goes to\nsupervision and all the other therapists\nsay well the patient is just crediting\nthe coach but you've been working on it\nso it's kind of like you got them 90% of\nthe way there and the coach swept in and\ngave them the victory but you should not\nfeel bad because you did a good job and\nthe therapist was like I don't know if\nI'm doing something right or I'm doing\nsomething wrong and everyone's like no\nyou're doing a good\njob how do we know\nthat see when a patient comes to you and\nsays this person was able to help me in\nthis\nway we have to be very careful as the\nfield of\ntherapy because our methodologies are\nthe best that are out there\nscientifically and they don't work for\neveryone and I think what's going on is\nfor a long time we had a couple of\nhistoric things happen in therapy the\nfirst is an emphasis on\nemotions and this is not a bad thing by\nthe way so we discovered that there was\na subset of patients that you could give\nlogical answers to and they would not\nchange you can tell someone hey alcohol\nis bad for you here are all the logical\nreasons why it doesn't cause them to\nstop\ndrinking or does\nit so what happened in therapy is that\nwe realize that as long as there is an\nunderlying undigested emotion that\ndrives all of these patterns this\npattern will continue and I think this\nwas a good finding there's plenty of\nscientific evidence for it\nbut I think we also made a few\nmistakes which is that if you look at\nsome of the biases in therapy there are\na few the first is that therapy is\nengaged in by people who are\ntraditionally\nwealthy it's a luxury right you go to\n[ __ ]\nManhattan or downtown Boston everyone's\nin\ntherapy you go to rural Texas there's\nnot a therapist within 60 miles\nso therapy is engaged in by the\nrich second\nproblem is that therapy has historically\nhad women as patients and so this is my\nbelief okay there's some extrapolative\nevidence to support this but there\naren't really strong studies okay so\nthis is my opinion all right so there's\nthis not supported 100% by\nscience that since therap the majority\nof therapists are women and the majority\nof patients are women\nwhat we tend to select for is emotional\nlanguage so if we look at women women I\nthink this is also not I don't know if\nthis is a statement of fact but\ngenerally speaking get a lot more\nmileage out of processing emotions than\nmen do men have a bias for whatever\nreason whether it's conditioning or\nbiology we want plans\nactions so when I was training to be a\ntherapist I was actually actively\ndisincentivized to problem solve with my\npatients I was told that problem solving\nis bad and even when we when I teach in\nour coaching uh at the healthy gamer\nInstitute when I'm teaching principles\nof coaching I actively discourage\nproblem\nsolving okay so I do it too and there's\na good reason to do it but here's what I\nlearned if you all want to know honestly\nthe reason I started healthy gamer is\nbecause I had a group of video game\naddicts in my office and what I found as\nI tried to do Psychotherapy with them is\nthat what helped them with was not\nPsychotherapy it was\npsychoeducation\nliterally I had 50 I had the same\nconversation 50 times with 50 different\npeople where I explained to them this is\nwhat your brain is doing this is what\nthe video game does to your brain this\nis why it is hard for you to control\nyourself here is how you control\nyourself if you do a b and c I laid out\nthe science the neuroscience and\npsychology of video gaming and I gave\nthem a solution\nfor a path\nforward and they got better and then I\nrealized I'm not actually doing\nPsychotherapy because Psychotherapy is\nindividual tell me about your life tell\nme about this tell me about this tell me\nabout this how are your parents how was\nthis how do you\nfeel I wasn't doing\nthat right so there's a part of that but\nI started to realize there's a lot of\ncommon\nstuff so I was doing Psychotherapy with\nthem in some way but there was a larger\npsycho education component than with a\ndifferent group of\npeople and so I started to wonder can I\nhave one conversation publicly and can\nanyone who's listening\nbenefit wow I had no idea what I was\ngetting into I had no idea how much\nbenefit there\nwas right and we have one some very\npreliminary data it's not an IRB\napproved study or anything like that\nthat even watching our content\npotentially improves depression and\nanxiety by 8 to 9% that's pretty good\nanti-depressant medication will get you\n30 to\n40% right so that's very not controlled\ndata right so there's a signal there\njust so you all understand I'm not\nsaying that watching our content will do\nthis we detected a bizarre signal that\nnow is so I want you all to understand\nthis anytime we do a study we have to\nhave a hypothesis in order to have a\nhypothesis we have to start with some\nkind of observation so we have a\nretrospective uncontrolled observation\nof a mental health Improvement from\nwatching our\ncontent it is large enough to make us\nWonder Hey this should be studied there\ncould be something real going on or it\ncould be false we don't know yet you all\nunderstand that\nnuance and so now what I find is when I\nwork with men\nespecially what they need is\neducation they need to understand why\nthey have emotions what's the purpose of\nemotions they need to understand how\nthey function what is going on inside\nyou what I basically do is take an\nengineering\napproach with my male\npatients here is the diagram of your\nphysiology and your\nNeuroscience for example very simple\nthings cortisol and adrenaline collapse\nyour peripheral vision from 180° to\n30° anytime you have stress in\nAdrenaline cortisol and adrenaline in\nyour it will also collapse your\nperipheral vision of thinking you will\nnot be able to consider\nalternatives if you are stressed\nliterally it is physiologically and\nneuroscientifically your brain is\nhandicapped so anytime a a male patient\nof mine has is stressed out and thinks\neverything is going wrong I will ask\nthem one\nquestion what's your stress level very\nhigh what does that do to your thoughts\nmakes an possible for me to see\nAlternatives can you see Alternatives no\nhow do we fix this reduce my stress how\ncan you reduce your stress I'm going to\ngo for a walk with my dog I'm going to\nmeditate and I'm going to hit the gym\ngood go today after we're done go take\nyour dog for a walk hit the gym try to\nget good night's sleep meditate text me\ntomorrow with three other options for\nwhat you can do boom\ndone it's amazing how well it works you\nteach people how their mind works you\nteach them how their physiology works\nand suddenly it's like everyone is going\nthrough life blind you're trying to\ndrive a car but you've got a blindfold\non and no wonder you keep on getting\ninto\nwxs once you understand that your mind\ncannot see additional Solutions and you\ncan change your physiology to see\nadditional Solutions the men in my\npractice do so much\nbetter\nand this is where we have this principle\nin therapy and by the way like I'm not\ndogging on therapy because let's\nremember one important thing I was\ntrained by some very good therapists and\nso all of the conclusions that I have\ncome from the training of excellent\nsupervisors they taught me the\nfundamentals of\ntherapy not the structure not what's at\nthe end what is the fundamental of\ntherapy and since they taught me this I\nwas able to perceive this I would be\nnowhere it's not that therapists are bad\nit's that I had some of the most\nbrilliant therapists on the world who\ndid such a good job at teaching me\ntherapy that I was able to help my\npatients the only difference is what I\nwas doing is not something that was\nentirely\ntraditional that's the only difference\nbut even then the people who taught me\ntaught me how to be successful and\nnon-traditional you don't have to follow\na script you need to understand the\nfundamentals of the principles at\nplay and even teaching men something as\nsimple as why do we have emotions\nemotions are source of information and\nemotions are source of\nmotivation and so so many of the men\nthat I work with they try to avoid their\nemotions avoid avoid avoid avoid avoid\nand in doing so they're literally\nblindfolding themselves they are\nhandicapping themselves because we have\nthese circuits in our brain that are so\nimportant that even animals have them\nreptiles have them so function\nthe functional utility of your emotional\ncircuitry is\nastronomical it gives us motivation and\ninformation what are the two most common\nproblems that I hear from men today I\ndon't know what to do and I can't get\nstarted well what the [ __ ] bro if you\nare sabotaging your emotional circuitry\nno wonder you don't know what to do and\nno wonder you don't know how to get\nstarted I don't feel like it well [ __ ]\nmaybe stop sabotaging your emotional\ncircuitry how are we sabotaging our\nemotional circuitry technology\nsubstances number one and number\ntwo addiction rates are so much higher\nsubstance use disorders are so much\nhigher in men men are also more\nsociopathic potentially more\nnarcissistic what are the features of\nnarcissism and sociopathy emotional\nchanges sociopathy is inability to feel\nemotions these are conditioned we say\nmen are evil because they're sociopaths\nthey're not evil because they're\nsociopaths they're sociopaths to survive\ntheir their emotional\nstate we induce features of sociopathy\neven in psychiatrists and therapists\nthis is part of the training to\nemotionally separate yourself to reduce\nyour empathy otherwise you'll get torn\napart for some men sociopathy is a\nsurvival mechanism against our\nemotions and we get demonized for\nit should we get demonized for\nsociopathic behavior that hurts people\nabsolutely but helped more\npeople I mean I haven't helped anyone by\npunishing them but I've helped plenty of\npeople who test highly on the sociopathy\nscale by teaching them\nthis so if you are a man alive today and\nyou're saying these the other problems\nif you're numb to your emotions your\nnormative male Alexia which we've talked\nabout so Lexi is color blindness to your\ninternal emotional state and in the\nscientific literature we use this term\ncalled normative male Alexia what does\nthat mean that means that Alexia is\nnormal in men\nwe're all emotionally color blind and\nthen what happens is we have a bunch of\ntherapists who are trained to ask people\nhow do you feel and we as men don't\nknow and so then we feel stupid and we\nfeel like we're not doing therapy right\nbecause our therapist continues to\ninsist how do you feel how do you feel\nlet's get in touch with your emotions\nlet's get in touch with your emotions\nlet's get in touch with your\nemotions and then men\nleave doesn't\nhelp and then this is the where we get\ninto a big problem in\ntherapy because then the therapist\nconcludes oh that that person's emotions\nwere too deeply buried if they had\nworked harder and if they had gotten to\ntheir emotions I would have been able to\nhelp\nthem it is a non-falsifiable\nhypothesis there was recently an\ninteresting video that that I saw about\npeople talking about bad experiences in\ntherapy and I think this is one of the\nreasons as a profession I think we'\nbecome\narrogant myself included like I'm not\nsaying I'm separate from\nthat right because like it's interesting\nlike no one ever asks if a patient\ndoesn't show up no therapist tracks them\ndown and asks hey why didn't you show up\nwhat could I have done better no one\ndoes\nthat just let them go they weren't\nready maybe someone does that I don't\nknow I've never heard of it in some ways\nwe even actively ethically we think it's\nagainst our system so it's an unethical\nto do that that's part of the reason\nthat we don't do it because we have\nconcluded as the field of therapy that\ntracking down a patient and asking him\nis bothering them you should respect\ntheir autonomy which is a good ethical\nargument what I'm saying though is when\nthat becomes a good ethical argument\nwhat are we opening ourselves up to as a\nprofession we are opening ourselves up\nto a lack of feedback when we fail it's\nthe price that we pay for this ethical\nconsideration\nso we don't don't get good\nfeedback so if you're a man I strongly\nencourage you to get therapy I'm serious\nI'm saying\nthis so just because there are\nweaknesses to the profession does not\nmean that it is a bad thing in fact we\nstill remain I started this statement\nI'll repeat it again that that therapy\nis the best evidence-based intervention\nthat we have for most me mental\nillnesses it's the best we've\ngot and it could be better\nand if you go to a\ntherapist and you feel like using this\nlanguage of emotions doesn't work for\nyou you can tell them hey I'm interested\nin\nSolutions and then the worst thing that\ncan happen is a therapist can say oh how\ndoes like finding a solution make you\nfeel\ngood right you can tell them that I'm\nconcerned that I like I may benefit from\na fair amount of psycho education so so\nI'd like to understand how things like\nmental endless\nwork I think that would be what would be\nhelpful for me so you can tell them that\nthis is what I\nwant and then if your therapist insists\non talking about feelings and can't\nexplain to you why talking about\nfeelings is\nimportant then you can even ask them you\ncan say Hey you keep on asking me how I\nfeel I'd appreciate it if we could take\na different approach besides just asking\nme about my\nfeelings are you capable of doing that\ncan you make a referral to someone who\nis less focused on feelings and more\nfocused on cognition or psycho education\nit's all you have to\ndo right and that's fine if the\ntherapist takes gets offended by that\nthen that's their problem let them\nhandle it in\nsupervision not every therapist is\nperfect for every\npatient fit is the most important\nthing\nthe last thing that I'll kind of share\nwith you'all just because I found this\nto be so incredibly helpful with the men\nthat I work with is anytime you feel an\nemotion if you really want to understand\nthe emotion ask yourself two\nquestions the first is what is this\nemotion telling\nme what is the information that my brain\nis conveying to me because of this\nemotion so it's a cognitive right so if\nI walk into a room\nand everyone is\nlaughing and one person makes eye\ncontact sees that I walk into the\nroom coughs and does that and then\neveryone shuts the [ __ ]\nup emotionally I feel\nbad\nwhy because my emotion is telling me\nsomething see this is important to\nunderstand emotion is our fastest source\nof\ninformation if without emotion it would\ntake a long time to figure out what was\nhappening happing in a long time to act\nthe whole point of emotion is someone\nslaps me across the face before I even\nrealize what's going on I'm slapping\nback what is the information that this\nwhat is the shame telling me we get so\ncaught up in it that we don't even\nrealize my my brain is trying to tell me\nsomething what is it trying to tell me\nand this is where your first reaction is\nit'll tell you something bad so you take\nthe first three things that it's telling\nyou you write them down and then you\ncome up with seven more bits of\ninformation the real learning is going\nto be in the the latter seven not the\nfirst three because emotions are\nprocessing a ton of\ninformation so\nquickly so each piece of emotion is\ntelling you 10 different things and your\nlearning will happen in numbers four\nthrough 4 through 10 not numbers 1\nthrough 3 although that can be helpful\ntoo the second thing is what is this\nemotion motivating me to\ndo what would fix this\nemotion so I'll give youall an example\nright someone let's say someone makes me\nfeel\nguilty and then I try to make the guilt\ngo away by giving them what they want\nhey bro can I borrow a 100 bucks uh you\nstill haven't paid me back for the last\ntwo times I borrowed you money bro oh my\nGod like I can't believe like you're so\nlucky and like you work at Google and\nlike you've got all this money and like\nsome of us aren't quite as fortunate as\nyou and you're like dogging me about\nmoney all the time I thought we were\nlike closer friends than that boom\nguilt what makes the guilt go\naway giving them\nmoney but when you give them money how\ndo you\nfeel bad you feel taken advantage of and\nthen you're stuck because you're ping\nponging between negative emotions this\nis what creates negative patterns in\nlife especially for men is ping ponging\nbetween negative emotions trying to keep\nit's like you're you're defending a city\nthat is under siege and different\nemotions are attacking you from\ndifferent sides from the North Face it's\nguilt from the East face it's anger at\nfeeling\nguilty from the south face it's\nhopelessness and sadness that you've\nbeen in this cycle between getting\npissed at your friends and being\nmanipulated by your friends and this is\nnever going to get\nbetter and from the West face it's shame\nbecause holy [ __ ] you're so pathetic and\nthis is never going to get better and if\nyou were a better man and if you had a\nbigger set of balls if you had a bigger\ndick if you were more manly you wouldn't\nhave this problem so then you beat\nyourself up and then you go back the\nwest and the East face turns back into\nanger now you're angry with\nyourself and so what we try to do is we\ntry to dodge one emotion and we just end\nup creating another\none so if you really ask yourself what\nis this emotion telling me to do\nwhat is the anger telling you to do what\nis the shame telling you to\ndo the shame and the anger are telling\nyou to change your situation don't have\na relationship with this\nperson set a limit with\nthem call them out on their\n[ __ ] right tell them hey I've let\nyou borrow\n$200 and instead of gratitude I get\nentitlement for you I raise concern that\nyou haven't paid me back and your\nresponse is to try to guiltrip\nme I'm not so sure that this\nrelationship is worth it for me\nanymore like I'm happy to help you out\nbut your response when I help you out I\ndon't think demonstrates good\nfriendship now when you hear me say that\nif you have a positive response you need\nto change the way that you're living\nyour life if that resonates with you and\nyou have an emotional response I wish I\ncould do that once again that emotional\nresponse's emotions are giving you\ninformation and they're giving you\nMotivation by all means set those\nboundaries have conversations with your\nfriends if you feel taken advantage\nof say hey I don't feel okay about\nthis why do you say these things to\nme well because you're so lucky you have\na job at Google why do you ask me for\n$100 instead of help getting your rese\ntogether why don't you ask me for help\nwith putting your own [ __ ] together and\ngetting your life in order instead of\nhitting me up for money and then making\nme feel guilty why do you reject my\nactual attempts to help your\nsituation these are the conversations\nthat especially as a man I feel like I\nneed to have more and more with men the\ngood news is that we're really good at\nhandling this\nstuff call them out on their [ __ ]\nand if it feels righteous and good to\nyou that once again is information and\nmotivation so this is what I think we\nneed to teach people and the beautiful\nthing is that we have a lot of really\ngreat therapists out there who figured\nthis\nout right such a beautiful\nphrase you've been through tragedy your\nlife sucks my job is to help you get\nstable not rub your back through the\ncrisis\nsometimes the job of a therapist is to\nrub someone's back through a\ncrisis sometimes it's to help them gain\nstability and a good therapist is able\nto tell the difference and a good\ntherapist is able to do\nboth sometimes we're naturally gifted at\none over the other and here I am talking\nabout what makes a good therapist and a\nbad therapist this is humbly my\nexperience right this is what I've seen\nand one of the things that I've learned\nas a therapist is that I'm not the best\ntherapist for\neverybody right I recognize that there\nare some things sometimes my patients\nneed something that I can't provide for\nthem and honestly the best thing that I\ncan do for them is to send them to a\ncolleague of mine who really understands\nthis problem and has really good\noutcomes with\nthem so it's\nchallenging but I think as men we've got\nto learn certain basic things about how\nwe work I hope y'all are able to find\ntherapists that are good for you I think\nit's totally fine to ask for a referral\nif it's not working out I think it's\nalso totally fine to offer some\ndirection in therapy remember therapy is\na\npartnership not a\ndictatorship and so one of the best\nthings one of the things that I\nappreciate the most is when a patient\nwalks into my office and says this is\nwhat I'm looking for can you help me\nwith this\nit helps me a lot because I know right\nso like this is good and even what's\nalso good is I have to set my ego aside\nbut if a patient says this is not\nworking for\nme it hurts to hear but that's good it's\nhealthy we shouldn't avoid it just\nbecause it hurts especially if the\npatient isn't getting\nbetter in this too I believe all of this\nstuff because I had some amazing\ntherapists as\nteachers and I believe all this stuff\nbecause I've had a lot of patients who\nhave had very bad experiences I've had\nfamily members who have had bad\nexperiences because the other thing that\nwe don't realize is that therapists on\nthe whole are burnt out as\n[ __ ] so when therapists are burnt out\nit's hard for them to do their job so\nit's not a weakness of an individual\ntherapist they too are victims of their\ncircumstances\nokay so we're at time for the\nday I just want to thank all of you for\nmaking this\nhappen so we would not be anywhere\nwithout your\nparticipation so I don't thank you just\nfor your support I thank you for your\nparticipation because all the material\nthat I have to go on is literally what\ny'all give me right so unless these\npeople\nwere thoughtful enough and motivated\nenough to make these comments the stream\nwould not be possible even these videos\nare possible because someone posted and\neven the people like my patients and my\nteachers who allow me to make these\nvideos this is what this is I mean\neveryone thinks Dr K is healthy gamer\nand oh my God Dr K Dr K Dr K and I get\nthat I appreciate it it right I have\nsome hand to play there's no question\nI'm not going to adopt false humility\nhere but the one thing that I really\nreally really love and respect is that I\ncan literally cannot do this without you\notherwise it'd be me talking to an empty\nroom it is with the interaction that\ny'all tell me what direction to go and\nwe go there\ntogether that's the whole point we go\nthere\ntogether that's what therapy is about\nit's about going somewhere\ntogether the last thing is\nthat we try to do what we do to fix the\nproblems as I see\nthem right so I can't be a therapist for\neverybody but what I can do is when I\nsaid I started a healthy gamer because I\nwas having the same conversation with 50\npeople that information that\nunderstanding that knowhow is what we\ntry to build so whether that's a lecture\nor live stream like today whether that's\na video that's uploaded to a particular\nplatform whether that's something like a\nbook or whether that's something like Dr\nK's guide so in Dr K's guide what I\nreally try to do is take everything that\nI've learned and all of the stuff that\nis on repeat for my patients I've tried\nto turn into an educational\nresource and the other thing that that I\nreally find is that like you know I've\nworked with some people now who have\nwatched my\ncontent and we move so much faster\nbecause don't have to explain the basics\nto\nthem and I've heard from so many people\nin the community that watching something\nlike Dr K's guide has helped them\naccelerate in their therapy or helped\nthem get into therapy or help them solve\nthis problem that's why we build it\nbecause there are scientific principles\nof how the mind works how the brain\nworks and the whole problem with the\nworld today is we don't know what they\nthey they are but the people who want to\ncontrol our Behavior\ndo this is why we don't have Direction\nin life this is why we have a generation\nof people who's addicted to pornography\nand video\ngames because the people who make it\nknow this stuff and we\ndon't we're being attacked on all sides\nthey've got weapons and we\ndon't so our mission is I can't be\neveryone's therapist we can't solve The\nWorld's Mental Health crisis we can't do\nit but what I'm going to do is give\ny'all a Fighting Chance that's my goal\nat least let's balance things a little\nbit you're probably still\nscrewed but we're going to give you the\ntools to go down\nfighting and the beautiful thing is that\nI'm grateful but it appears that when\nsome of y'all have some of these tools\nyou're able to win and I I certainly\ndon't think that you're winning because\nof us you're winning because of you we\nhave some small thing right you have to\nswing the sword but we can give you the\nsword that's all we're doing and that's\nhonestly I believe that I don't I don't\nthink I just don't think it's\nneuroscientific possible for some guy to\nsay something on the Internet and create\nsome kind of really profound change in\nyour life all I can give you is the\ntools and that's what we've designed\nwe're really trying to do as best as we\ncan and we see good\noutcomes so thank you all so much for\nbeing here for making this possible and\nfor supporting us the more that you\nsupport us the more that we're going to\ndo with it and if y'all if participation\nis all you're doing just showing up and\nwatching is fine you can send links to\nother people by the way if you guys want\nto check out you know some videos if if\nyall are relatively new to the community\nstrongly recommend you check out all the\nones that we we have right so some of\nthese things like Dr K's guide are cost\nmoney but clearly we've got a lot of\ngood resources out there that are\nabsolutely free so if yall haven't\nchecked out these videos there's a\nreason why they have millions of\nviews um we hope to help yall in\nwhatever capacity we are able to and in\nwhatever capacity that you can afford\nand if if you guys can help us with\ngiving us some kind of resources whether\nthen that you can give us resources or\nyou can link to things send stuff to\nyour friends this is what we're trying\nto do and one of the things that'll help\nus the most right now frankly is\nordering our book right I hope it'll\nhelp you all get it for your parents get\nit for your friends get it for your\nparents who have nie I mean your\nbrothers and sisters who have nieces and\nnephews get it for yourself if you want\nto learn how to\ncommunicate and that'll give us more\nfuel and I'm working on number two and\nnumber three but that too whether those\nget published or not depends on whether\nmy publisher is happy with the\nperformance of this book so this is the\nkind of thing where I can write the\nbooks but literally whether you will\never get access to them I there's some\nthings I suppose I could self-publish\nand stuff like that but that has a whole\nset of problems with\nit so this is the kind of thing where\nthis is a\npartnership and so what I am capable of\ndepends on you so if this book does well\nI have the license to write two more if\nif it doesn't do well then it just\nbecomes more challenging doesn't mean\nthat I'm going to give\nup so literally whether this stuff\nhappens or not depends more on you than\nit does on me I'm going to do my part\nyou can do your part if you feel\ncomfortable with it if you don't feel\ncomfortable you're like [ __ ] this guy I\ndon't want to buy his book fair\nenough I'm trying to be as transparent\nand authentic with y'all as I can about\nhow I view this stuff what your\ncontribution\nis\nokay so thank you all so much for coming\ntoday I hope this has been helpful huge\nshout out to everyone that has posted on\nsubreddit commented on videos shared\nstuff that is really the most important\nthing it is about the community more\nthan anything\nelse and this is what's super cool like\nI don't know if yall get this\nbut if yall want to see this is why\nhealthy gamer is more than Dr\nK so when this person shares\nright it's just my mind saying you\naren't going to find people you resonate\nwith because you never do and then\nsomeone else says strong AF work imagine\nwhat positive feedback you're giving\nthis\nperson and this is the problem is that\nif Dr K tells you good job your mind is\nlike oh that's just Dr K Dr K of course\nlike is [ __ ] dumb and he's going to\nsee the goodness in all people and all\nthis kind of stuff you'll dismiss what I\nsay you guys see that I can't do\nthis this can only be done by\nkth and this is the other beautiful\nthing is Dr K says this stuff who knows\nif it's right who know if it's wrong I'm\nthe first one that'll say I don't know\nif this is right or wrong it's y'all\nthat have to figure it\nout and now kth says holy [ __ ] kth sees\nthis and he compliments Reed and so Reed\ngets a\nboost and kth is like maybe I should try\nthis and the other cool thing is\neveryone who is reading this is also\nlike hey maybe there's something to this\nmaybe I should try it it's\nCommunity y'all are the ones doing the\nreal\nmagic see if I was responsible for most\nof your change then everyone in our\ncommunity would be equally\nchanged everyone in our community is not\nequally changed what is the scientific\nthe only scci not only scientific the\nbest scientific hypothesis for this is\nthat you have to put in the effort to\nand if you put because the stimulus is\nthe same right the intervention is the\nsame Dr K's lecture that's the same for\neveryone who watches it what determines\nwhether some people get helped and some\npeople don't get helped it's what you\nput\nin it's way more than\nme I can give you the sword but you have\nto swing\nit so strong work and let's keep going\nchat I'll see yall I think next week but\nI'll be doing some traveling so\nschedules are going to be kind of wonky\ncuz book comes out in 5 days and I have\nto go and H do K I wrote a book it's\ncalled healthy\ngambling all right y'all take care we'll\nsee y' allall uh when we see you next\nwhich I don't even know I'm so brain\ndead I don't even know where that\nis"
