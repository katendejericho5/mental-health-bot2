    "transcript": "as a human race like nuclear war is not\ngoing to us it's going to be stuff like\nhaptic feedback and virtual girlfriends\nand things like that this is what\nhappened with video games someone is\ngoing to figure out that with an AI\ngirlfriend the way to really get someone\naddicted is we have to approximate the\nreal experience as much as possible\nwhich means once in a while your AI\ngirlfriend is going to pick a fight with\nyou and she's actually going to hang up\non you when you call her I don't know if\nthis is true or not but I would bet\nmoney that over time this is exactly\nwhat we're going to see and as we do\nthat we're activating other parts of the\nbrain and we're making this virtual\nexperience approximate the real thing\nbecause I'm sure you're familiar with\nrandom reinforcement schedules right so\nright now the problem with porn is that\nanytime I watch it it's always available\nthe moment that someone figures out that\ndenying someone their pornography 20% of\nthe time means that they're going to\ncome to your website more that's so\ncrazy"
