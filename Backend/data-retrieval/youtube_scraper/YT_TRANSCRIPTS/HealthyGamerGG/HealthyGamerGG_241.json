    "transcript": "when did creativity stop being in our\ncontrol when did we start treating\ncreativity as different from anything\nelse that we do oh yeah and other\ndimensions of my life I can have a\nroutine and I can have a habit but when\nit comes to creativity just going to\nsend it out the window incorrect so the\npeople who are successful artists are\nthe ones who make a habit of creating\nit's a skill to access that creative\npart of yourself so this is where like\nif you look at mahil shet mahil right\nthe guy who developed flow he's like\ntalking about developing a process to\naccess that creativity let me put it to\nyou this way like so you can't create a\nstate of sleep you can't just feel like\nI'm asleep no can habit help with sleep\nabsolutely even though you can't create\nit in fact it facilitates it so when you\ndevelop a good creative habit when you\ndevelop a good process it primes your\nbrain to like be in the right mode and\nthen once you're in the right mode like\nthe creativity actually flows more\neasily the problem is that the reason\nyou think creativity only Flows at\nrandom times is because the way that\nyou've allowed it to flow is only at\nrandom times"
