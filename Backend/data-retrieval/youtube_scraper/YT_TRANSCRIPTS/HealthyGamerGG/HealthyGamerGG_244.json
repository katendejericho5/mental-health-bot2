    "transcript": "the ego is a part of the mind it can be\nobserved just like your thoughts just\nlike your emotions you can notice the\nfunction of ego it's trickier it's\nsubtler but you can even notice any eye\nstatement that you make is is a thought\nright and it's being sort of run by the\n[Music]\nego why does everyone talk about the ego\nas if they're not the ego that's doing\nthe talking everyone seems to refer to\nthe ego as if it's a as if it's separate\nfrom the one typing or talking\njust as a thought arises so do these\nwords I'm typing as well as the words I\nspeak it's like everyone is trying to\ntranscend this voice in their head or\nwhatever but the voice in the head is\nwhat's creating these words I type as\nwell as the words I speak do people\nunderstand this or have they just\ncreated a super ego that thinks it's\nseparate from the thoughts and words\nwhen reflecting upon what they've seen\nwhen explaining to me it seems as if the\nprogram has realized it's a program but\nother people seem to think that the\nwords they write and say are not coming\nfrom the from thought SL ego I'm not\nreferring to the awareness or\nConsciousness that's observing all of\nthis just referring to the seemingly\nlarge number of people who think they're\nnot an ego when communicating so if you\nare confused because everyone's talking\nabout ego but isn't it just the ego\nthat's doing the talking no it's not hey\nDr K how do I get my kid to put down the\ngame without it being a fight every\nsingle time the problem with gaming is\nthat it tricks our brain into being a\nsub substitute for Life once we start to\nget our psychological needs met through\nthe game that's when we become addicted\nhow to raise a healthy gamer combines\nthe latest in Neuroscience research\nalong with a decade of clinical practice\ncheck it out anywhere books are sold so\nif you all want to understand this it's\nvery simple okay maybe it's confusing\nbut I think it's relatively simple the\nfirst is that thoughts and ego are not\nthe same so we're going to use a lot of\nSanskrit here because I think Sanskrit\nis a very very sophisticated language\nand we run into this problem here with\nEnglish because English does not have\nthe language to specify these\ndifferences so the first thing is that\nthis person says thought SL ego which\nimplies that thoughts and ego are the\nsame thing right so if you're using like\ngood slash right like that implies and\nthis is precisely this person's problem\nI according to me is that they haven't\nunderstood that the mind has different\nparts and that different parts can\nobserve and act on each other so let's\nunderstand that we're going to use the\nSanskrit phrase Anana so Anana is often\ntimes translated as the mind but man is\nmind such an unsophisticated\nrepresentation of it so antakarana\nliterally means internal instrument and\nthat is the best definition so if we\nlook at our lives okay there is this\nphysical body we have hands we have eyes\nwe have nose and all of these things are\ndesigned to interact with the outside\nworld so I can pick up a pen so that the\nhand is really interesting because it is\na sensory organ and is it it is an organ\nof action I can affect a willpower\nchange in the external world with my\nhands and I can get information from the\noutside world with my hands the whole\nbody is an external instrument I can\ntaste things from the outside my body\nwill let me know whether this is healthy\nor unhealthy because I'll get sick or\nI'll feel good after I eat something so\nwe have this instrument that allows us\nto connect with the external and then we\nhave this instrument that is internal\nthis is the an this is the mind now\nlet's understand so much like the body\nhas hands feet Eyes Nose we have five\nsenses we have many organs of action\nright we can do things with our heat\nfeet we can do things with our hands we\ncan do things with our voice we can\naffect change in the outside world with\nmany instruments that are part of the\nbody so what are the parts of the\nantakarana the internal instrument so\nthe first question is thoughts and ego\nbecause this is what this person is\nconfused about can I think without\nhaving an ego absolutely right so if we\nlook at what is the ego the ego is the\nsense of ey so an ego is something\nthat's me mine that's what ego is so\neven in the west and the East we kind of\nagree that there is a quality of\npossessiveness there is a quality of\nmeanus there is a quality of Inus we\nknow there's this part of the brain\ncalled the default mode Network which is\nprobably where this part of the Inus\nlives we also know that the me has a\nspatial location so I know this sounds\nkind of weird but you\nthe Unice of you exist somewhere over\nhere you're not in a different room\nright now you're where you are right and\nthat sounds kind of weird but we also\nknow that you can electrically stimulate\nthe temporoparietal junction of the\nbrain and you can trigger It Out of Body\nExperience you can have an eye that is\noutside of the physical location of your\nbody so there's a certain Inus so you\ncan the the function of thought is\nseparate from the function of ego so ego\nis identity it's like who I am okay in\nSanskrit we have the the word aara which\nmeans the sense of ey oress but you can\nthink about things without ego it is you\nthat's doing the thinking yes but you're\nnot thinking in terms of ego like I can\njust drink this water there's no ego\ninvolved in that right I'm just drinking\nwater and you can say but you're saying\nyou're saying you're drinking water but\nyeah but that could be unconscious too I\ncould just drink the water so we have\nthoughts we have emotions and then we\nhave the ego so the ego is anytime you\nhave an eye statement that is the ego so\nI am good at this I am good at that that\nrequires a judgment of a an identity\ncompound anytime we make a comparison\ninvolves the ego because I cannot say\nthat you are taller or shorter without\nme being taller or shorter so you can\nmake comparisons to non-p people that's\nnot ego but anytime you make a\ncomparison to someone else that involves\nthe ego because you can't say that\nyou're taller or shorter unless you have\nan identity and so the ego is a part of\nthe mind it can be observed just like\nyour thought thoughts just like your\nemotions you can notice the function of\nego it's trickier it's subtler but you\ncan even notice any eye statement that\nyou make is is a thought right and it's\nbeing sort of run by the ego and we know\nthat we can exist with egoless States so\nreally good example of an egist state is\nif you ever jump into a body of water\nthat is a little bit cold for a moment\nyou're just pure existence you're not\nfat or thin you're not silly or smart\nyou're not successful or a failure\nyou're not poor or Rich for a moment you\njust jump into the water and then you\nexist fully in that moment you're not\nnot paying attention you're not thinking\nabout video games or distracted or\nanything like that you're fully present\nright there for just a flash of a second\nbut you have no sense of identity if you\nreally pay attention you'll find this\nand so this is the ego and it's not the\nsame as thought it's not the same as\nemotion and then we sort of get to this\nthis ultimate idea which the person kind\nof alludes to in in their post right\nwhich is um I'm not referring to the\nawareness or Consciousness that's\nobserving this that's what's ultimately\nat the end of it okay is that there is a\nConsciousness the act of witness\nobservation or experience is ultimately\nlike what's even beyond the antakarana\nso the antakarana or the internal\ninstrument or the mind has thoughts it\nhas emotions it has ego has two other\nthings some scars like memories and it's\ngot a a location of sorts called the\nchitta it's got a space where all these\nthings interact and then beyond that is\npure Consciousness and so when this\nperson says it seems to me as if the\nprogram has realized it's a program it's\nnot the program that realizes it's a\nprogram it's the Consciousness that\nrealizes that there is a program running\nso you have a witnessing capability\nwhich can witness your thoughts can\nwitness your emotions and can witness\nyour ego but the witnesser itself is\ndoesn't have any ego qualities because\nit is just the screen on which\neverything else is projected right so I\ndon't know if this makes sense but like\nyou know you can have a lot of pixels on\nthe screen but the TV itself doesn't\nchange everything all of the images that\nare projected on the screen can change a\nlot your thoughts can change your\nemotions can change but that Which\nexperiences has never changed that's the\nyou your body has changed your mind has\nchanged but you have not changed what\nmakes you you what makes you you is\nyou're the one who experiences every\nmoment of your life this is why it's so\nhard for other people understand you\nbecause they don't experience the other\nparts of your life if everyone could\nshare experiences everyone would\nunderstand each other the whole\nchallenge in life is you're the only one\nthat experiences your life and yet you\nare always experiencing it you don't get\na break from it for even moment this\nquality of experience is the most\nfundamental thing and that is what\nobserves the ego it isn't the ego\nobserving the ego and there's a very\nsimple way to understand this so when\nsomeone is behaving egotistically do\nthey know they are behaving\negotistically not at all y'all get that\nthe more of their head that someone has\nup their ass the less aware they are the\nego dominates the mind it is dominates\nthe antakarana and as it dominates the\nanara you lose awareness narcissists\ndon't know their narciss that's the\nwhole problem how do you demolish\nnarcissism you raise awareness as they\nbecome more aware the narcissism reduces\nliterally if we look at things like\ndialectical behavioral therapy which is\nregarded by many as the best\nevidence-based treatment for borderline\npersonality disorder which is a cluster\nB personality disorder and the cluster B\npersonality disorders also include\nnarcissism so what do BPD and narcissism\nshare they share a very unhealthy ego\nthat's the root of it unhealthy in\ndifferent ways and so mindfulness helps\nboth so the more we move away from the\nego the more that the symptoms of these\nclinical illnesses improve and so ego\ndoesn't observe itself okay and now if\nif y'all are really paying attention\nsome of y'all may ask the question okay\nbut you know what is it so if if the\nwitness or the experiencer can observe\nthe ego what is it that observes the\nwitness and the cool thing is people may\nsay is there a witnesser Beyond\nwitnesser right so I witness my life but\nis there something beyond that is there\nsomething beyond that is it basically\nlike turtles all the way down and the\nanswer is no there is an end of the road\nand the witnesser is the end of the road\nbut you can't understand that until you\nget really good at looking beyond the\nanara to your awareness until you learn\nhow to move past emotions thoughts and\nego to what it what is experiencer and\nthen you try to look beyond that you can\nkeep looking and then you'll find the\nanswer it makes sense once you find it\nright there's just one it's not like the\nTV is pixels on another TV which pixels\non another TV right so this is what it\nkind of looks like but no this it it it\nisn't infinitely regressive so and the\nway that we know that is because if you\nactually get rid of the antakarana if\nyou stop all thoughts all emotions and\nall ego and you are just witnessing in a\nraw way there's nothing Beyond it that's\nfull it feels complete it's you have to\nexperience it but by all means go\nlooking for something Beyond ego and I\nmean beyond the witnesser and prove me\nwrong go for it right this is just once\nagain the ego of me oh my God my\nexperiences must be generalized to\neverybody I could be wrong I could be an\nidiot in fact I am an idiot so check it\nout for\n[Music]\nyourselves"
