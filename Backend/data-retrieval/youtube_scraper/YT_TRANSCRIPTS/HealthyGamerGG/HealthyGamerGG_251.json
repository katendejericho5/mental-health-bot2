    "transcript": "so the key thing that we need to\nunderstand is that if you want\nconsistence you have to start by\nunderstanding that you don't exist\nBeyond today that your life is actually\na multiplayer game where random people\nare waking up in your life and get to\nlive life one day at a time but Dr Kay\nno these are all these people are me no\nthis is the problem this is what the\nyogi said this is a viida you don't know\nthat this isn't actually you you're just\na random person living this life one day\nat a time and that may sound weird but\nthink about it for a second right\nbecause what do you love to do you love\nto screw over tomorrow you and then you\nwake up tomorrow and then who do you get\nmad at you get mad at the dude that came\nbefore you right because that person\ndamn it why didn't that guy do this crap\nthat needed to be done instead I'm\nwaking up today and I have all this\nstuff that this person yesterday did not\ndo so if you really stop and think about\nit the basic problem with life is that\nyou don't recognize that you only get to\nlive for this moment in time"
