    "transcript": "so this is the way that I want youall to\nthink about dating so in my life I can\nbe with someone with a lot of people\nwith one person with no people you can\npick whatever and so you're going on a\ndate to try to get to know someone\nappreciate them for who they are and see\nif you have some kind of natural\ninclination towards them see if you all\ncan Vibe together or not it's a Vibe\ncheck that's what a date is so it's not\nabout an outcome it's about an\nexperience not I need to impress this\nperson and this person needs to like me\nor anything like that don't let all that\nstuff go you're going you're going to\nshow up as your self they are going to\nshow up as themselves you're going to be\na polished version of you and just try\nto enjoy the experience this was the big\nthing that changed a lot for me so it\nstarted with me being a monk so I like\nokay I'm going to be a monk so now that\nI'm hanging out with girls like there's\nno semblance of any kind of romantic\nanything it's not an option it's off the\ntable so I can relax and I can just have\na good time right let's just go hang out\nlet's go to lunch somewhere hey are you\nwe're done with lunch do you want to\nlike go do something else like let's go\nfor a hike and then you end up hanging\nout with people and they wind up being a\nlittle bit more attracted to you"
