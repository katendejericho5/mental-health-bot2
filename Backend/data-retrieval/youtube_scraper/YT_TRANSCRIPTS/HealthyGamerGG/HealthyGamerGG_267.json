    "transcript": "we view transformation of the self as\nlike separate from the rest of our lives\nwhereas the big lesson I learned in\nIndia is like I don't have to be in\nIndia to become a monk in fact running\naway to India was just running away from\nmy problems and a subtle way for my ego\nto like outperform people who were\noutperforming me so when someone you\nknow when my friends and stuff like got\n4.0 gpas and got into medical school and\nI failed to get into medical school for\nthe second time in a row I was like okay\nwell let me go become a monk because\nthen I'm above all of this rat race all\nthese doctors who are chasing money I'm\nbetter than of them I'm not\nmaterialistic etc etc it's all running\naway from my problems and then I\nrealized through thankfully a lot of\nbrilliant teachers and and some you know\neffort on my own part that I'm going to\ntake my problems with me wherever I go\nthey're my problems running away to\nIndia like I'm going to take them with\nme so you can move to a new town but\nlike your sense of disgust where is it\ncoming from like where does it live it\nlives up here"
