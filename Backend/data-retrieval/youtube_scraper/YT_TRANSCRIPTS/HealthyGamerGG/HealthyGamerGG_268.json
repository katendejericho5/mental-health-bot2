righty chat let's get\nstarted how's everybody doing today h oh\nsomething fell how's everybody doing\ntoday welcome to another healthy gamer\nGG stream just a reminder that although\nI'm a psychiatrist nothing we discussed\non stream is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly happy Monday\neverybody um we are now in the month of\nFebruary and just a Remer that Dr K\nwrote a book how to raise a healthy\ngamer so uh we have uh a cool\nannouncement to make so I wrote a book\nabout raising kids in the digital age\nand how to raise your kids in a way that\nhelps them develop a healthy\nrelationship with\ntechnology and if you already have a kid\nwho has a problem with technology or a\nloved one like significant other or you\nknow\nfriend brother sibling what have you\nsome of the techniques in the book will\nalso work so we are the book comes out\nin uh on March 12th and so we actually\nhave a couple of cool things that we're\ndoing so if you pre-order the book you\nget access to a couple of things one is\nyou get a sneak peek of a chapter from\nthe uh book on audio read by Yours Truly\num you also get a parent workbook if you\npre-order right now so that's\nunderstanding your child's gaming type\nand then we're going to do a special Q&A\nfor people who have pre-ordered the book\nso we'll answer questions if yall\npre-order and then you you know have any\nquestions about gaming stuff we will do\na live Q&A on the 11th um yeah so\ndefinitely check it\nout we have a book that is out now and\nor not not not out now it's it gets\nreleased in one month exactly and today\nwe're going to be doing stuff sort of\nrelevant to that so we're going to be\ntalking about parenting kids with\nADHD\nso let's get\nstarted and it's available anywhere\nwhere y'all can you know order\nbooks so I'm super excited today so this\nis kind of\ninteresting so you know like we talk\nabout so a lot of what I share comes\nfrom my personal experience right so\nthere's like oh there's like the\nPsychiatry and then there's the\nneuroscience and then there's the\nspirituality but um part of the reason I\nwrote this book is because like I'm a\nparent now and today we're going to be\ntalking a lot about parenting kids uh\nparenting kids in the digital age and\nparenting kids with ADHD so like it's so\nfascinating to see how difficult it is\nto raise a kid with ADHD and some of the\nworkarounds that I've kind of like had\nto figure out so it's taken everything\nthat I've learned from India\nNeuroscience Psychiatry whatever to even\nlike raise my own own kids in this\ndigital age and one of my kids is\nprobably\nneurodiverse so um I'm like there's a\nlot of challenges out there that parents\nreally struggle with when it comes to\nraising kids especially with ADHD but\nwhat I've sort of found is that if you\nreally understand what ADHD is and how\nit works then you can adjust your\nparenting style and then it ends up so\nmuch smoother so we're going to kind of\nget into that spoilers from the book so\nthe book has has four sections the first\nsection is about understanding the\nimpact of technology Addiction on your\nchild so like what does technology do to\ntheir brain what does their technology\ndo to their psychology part two is about\nbuilding an alliance because you can't\nbe sober for someone else so this is\nsomething I learned the hard way so when\nyou're an addiction psychiatrist you\ncan't convince someone to be sober they\nhave to want to do it themselves now in\nthe case of gaming we don't necessarily\nneed sobriety\nbut you can't have a gamer who doesn't\nwant to be a healthy gamer like you\ncan't force it on them right so they\nhave to decide for themselves hey these\ngames are not like moving my life in the\ndirection that I want them to go and\nthis is where I think one of the the the\nthings that we explain pretty well which\nis very confusing to parents is that\nmany people will look at a gamer or\nhusband wife whatever sibling and\nthey'll be stunned because you tell this\nperson hey I think your gaming is\ncausing\nproblems but then the person like no\nmatter how hard you try to explain it to\nthem how much logic you use they just\npush back over and over and over again\nand the reason is because if you're a\ngamer whose life is falling apart on a\nsubconscious level you know it's falling\napart if your life is falling apart you\nare trying very very hard to suppress\nthat fact and people who point out to\nyou that you were screwing up your life\nwill actually trigger your psychological\ndefense mechanisms and you will deny the\nobvious so this is where if you sort of\nlook at it right there are a lot of\npeople out there you can look in like\npolitical spheres and things like that\nthat are clearly in the wrong but the\nmore clearly they are in the wrong the\nmore they insist that they are correct\nso the book dives into sort of how to\nbuild an alliance and sort of the\npsychology of like how to show people or\nhow to create a space where someone\nfeels like they can admit that they made\na mistake and once they admit that\ngaming is a problem then y'all can\nwork in a positive\ndirection right so it's it's not that\nthey can't see it Katy Escape it's that\nthey try really hard not to see it they\ncan see it but they're even it's not\neven a simple it's not even as simple as\nlike oh they can't see it it's not a\nlack of ability it's actually in the\nopposite direction where they are trying\nreally hard not to see it and so this is\nwhat's so confusing about parents\nthey're like oh my God I don't\nunderstand like I how does he how does\nthis this kid not realize no they\nthey're trying very hard they realize\nand they realize so well that they are\ntrying really hard to disprove what they\nalready know and so you're kind of\napproaching it with the completely kind\nof opposite energy it causes them to be\ndefensive dig in their heels and not\nadmit that they have a\nproblem so weapons grade copium well\nsaid right so how do you get around that\nkind of stuff so I know this is um a\nlittle bit strange because this book\nisn't you know arguably for our core\nCommunity but that's actually changing\nbecause the average age of people in our\ncommunity is like 32 a lot of people\nhave kids now we have some people in\ntheir 60s that watch our content which\nis awesome for those of y'all that are a\nlittle bit older welcome to the\nclub and um yeah the other thing is that\nsome of the skills in this book even if\nthey don't apply to the parent child I\nmean even if they're not if you don't\nhave a parent child relationship they\nabsolutely apply to communication with\nother people so if yall are having\ntrouble like in general with\ncommunication and building healthy\nrelationships that's a big part of what\nthis book is about okay all right let's\ndive\nin oh is there a video where he talks\nabout anxiety caused by thinking about\ndeath not specifically but y'all should\ndefinitely check out our first interview\nwith Ethan\nEvans so he is an awesome dude and we\ntalk a lot about that and this is like\nthis is like three years ago but check\nit out\nokay\num all right so let's dive in got good\nones\nchat\nokay\nuh hold\non this doesn't look\nright U oh there it is scrolling Dr K\nneeds to scroll\nokay give me just one second chat let me\nget set\nup\nokay all\nright this I love this one okay\nso how to limit iPad use hi so my\n4.5-year old got an iPad for for\nChristmas from mother-in-law me and the\nwife limit it to 1 hour a day but she is\nobsessed with this iPad in the texting\nfeature and insists on texting the\nMother-in-law whom just entered her life\nat\nChristmas she was absence since birth\ndue to other issues how can I limit my\ndaughter from iPad use before I throw it\naway completely okay so this is a very\nclassic classic\nexample so grandparent whose job it is\nto spoil their child especially when\ngrandparent has been absent right so the\ngrandparent has been absent so sometimes\nwhen you have a kid and they have some\nkind of caregiver or parenting figure\nwho doesn't do a great job either\nthey're a little bit absent or maybe\nthey yell or maybe they drink or\nsomething else maybe they're trying to\nwin over your child's affection right\nbecause they're trying to get their own\nemotional needs met will give the child\nan iPad or some other kind of\ntechnological\nadvice now this is what's really\nunfortunate so when uh grandparents or\nother caregivers do this what they're\nbasically\ndoing is is one of my mentors once put\nit they [ __ ] the bed and letting\nsomeone else clean it up so when when\nyou give a child a technological device\nthey love you it is a way of buying\naffection and the other thing that\nyou're doing is you're making the\nparents a bad guy because now you're you\nget to give the child the the iPad right\nso the child loves it and then the\nparents are the ones who have to\nInstitute limits so you're like here\ntake some crack cocaine or opium or\nheroin take something that makes up for\nall of the guilt that I feel for being\nabsent from the first part of your life\nor I'm trying to bribe your affection\nthrough giving you something that you\nwant and by the way it is my\njob to spoil them this is the situation\nthat we face right because grandparents\noften times don't realize that these are\nhighly addictive substances so I want\nyou all to just think about this for a\nsecond right is it okay as a grandparent\nto be like man I'm feeling guilty\nbecause I've been absent from my\ngrandparents grandchild's life for a\nlittle while and I want them to love me\noh and the little one loves crack\ncocaine so much they love heroin so much\nlet me just give them some heroin here\nI'm going to give you a pile of heroin\nthat you can use every single day and by\nthe way I'm going to text you and you\ncan text me so let's use the heroin\ntogether such\namazing grandparent child bonding so the\nfirst thing is that we as a society need\nto\nnormalize having conversations with with\npeople who give gifts before they give\ntechnology see gift giving is great you\ngive it as a surprise no one really\nknows what you're giving oh my God\nthat's amazing okay it's it's great like\nyou get give someone a gift it's a\nsurprise oh my God they open up they're\nso happy they had no idea but now we\nlive in a society where if you give the\nwrong gift the gifts can be harmful\nright so we don't like gift people vape\npens like oh like little Timmy is seven\nlet me gift him a g a vape pen right you\ndon't do that\nso this is something that absolutely\nneeds to happen if you are a parent or\nyou are a grandparent or you are a uncle\naunt sibling whatever always talk to the\nparents before you give someone a\ntechnological advice because they're the\nones that have to Institute limits\nthey're the ones that have to fight with\nthe child they're the ones that have toe\nprevent the technological device from\nharming their\nchild so as a parent this is also\nsomething you should do where you need\nto normalize having conversations with\ngift givers and say hey if you're ever\nthinking about giving the kids some kind\nof Technology youall need to clear it\nwith us first we're working really hard\nto set healthy limits around device us\nusage okay so like I know this is kind\nof confusing because because we normally\ndon't clear gifts before we give them so\nI want youall to think about device\ngiving kind of like gifting a pet you\njust don't gift someone a pet because\nit's a huge responsibility\nright you can't just be like hey I got\nyou a dog good luck no you need to clear\nit with them first make sure that they\ncan handle it and Technology falls into\nthis\ncategory so this is also\nlike okay does that make sense the other\nthing that we have to understand is that\nas a parent even though you should be\nhaving these conversations the other\nthing that you should absolutely be\ndoing is working with your child to\ndevelop healthy technology habits and so\nif you have a plan in place to teach\nyour child a healthy relationship with\nan iPad then it's okay if someone gives\nyou an iPad because you already have the\ninfrastructure in\nplace to manage the iPad set limits\nwhatever so this is a common problem\nthat we also see with parents where\nthey're like oh my God like we're not\nworking on like developing a healthy\nrelationship with technology therefore\nsomeone randomly gives us a gift and it\ncreates all kinds of problems as parents\nwe need to expect that our children will\nbe exposed to technology at some point\nit's not good enough that you haven't\ngiven it to them right so this is where\nas parents what we want to do is prepare\nour kids for the world that they're\ngoing to live in and preparing our kids\nfor the world that they're going to live\nin means preparing them for a world\nworld with technology and so how do you\nteach a child how to have a healthy\nrelationship with technology you give\nthem access to technology and start to\nbuild up a healthy relationship what\ndoes that mean so this means something\nas simple as okay let's talk a little\nbit about technology usage when do you\nwant to use how much do you want to use\nwhat effect does it have on your\nmind what effect does it have on your\nmood let's talk about how when we're\ngoing to use when we're not going to use\nwhat do you enjoy about it what do you\nnot enjoy about it this is everything\nthat we have in the book right so this\nis all in here so how to have\nconversations with your kids so that\nthey understand so I'll give you all an\nexample of something that I do with my\nchildren so my kids wake up not anymore\nbut they used to wake up and they used\nto want to watch TV the first thing in\nthe morning right it's the weekend let's\nhave fun because I had this idea that\nwhen I was growing up and I on the\nweekend like I would wake up and watch\ncartoons and play video games and like\nthat's what I did on the weekend so I\nwas like okay the weekend is for fun the\ndifference is that when I was growing up\nthere was a limit to how many cartoons I\ncould watch because they weren't on\nDemand right so the cartoon happens it\nhappens from a certain time to a certain\ntime they start around 7:00 a.m. and\nthey end around 11: or noon and then\nthey like don't have good cartoons in\nthe afternoon so I was limited the\nproblem is that right now kids are not\nlimited right so if they watch something\non their on demand video service right\nthey can watch for like literally 24\nhours a day for 365 days a year and\nthey'll never run out of stuff to\nwatch so the the standards that I grew\nup\nwith don't apply anymore so I was like\nokay let me indulge my kids and let them\nwatch on the weekend but then I realized\nthat this was causing a lot of problems\nand so now what I do is when I when I\nwake up we sort of wake up and then we\nsay okay do you want to watch let's pay\nattention to ourselves how much do you\nenjoy the first 30 minutes how much do\nyou enjoy the next 30 minutes do you\nwant to take a break let's take a break\nanyway and then I'm going to ask you in\n30 minutes after taking a break whether\nyou really wish you had kept watching or\nyou're having fun so we'll go to the\nplayground or something like that and\nthen I'll ask them in half an hour hey\ndo you want to go home and continue\nwatching or are you having fun with your\nfriends they're like no we want to stay\nokay now they understand that stopping\nwatching at some point can help them\nhave\nfun so this is kind of the approach that\nwe want to take with our kids is like\nyou have to start setting healthy\ntechnology limits at a young age and a\nbig part of that is encouraging your\nchild to pay attention to themselves and\nthen asking them hey if we watch for one\nhour versus two hours is the second hour\njust as fun as the first hour and if you\nraise awareness of these things with\nyour children they will naturally start\nto realize okay technology is fun but\nother stuff is fun too there is a\ndiminishing return on technology usage\nand the one simple thing the most\nimportant lesson you can teach your\nchild if you want to prepare them for a\nworld of invasive technology is that\nthere is diminishing returns on\nusage this is the most important lesson\nonce once your child understands there\nare diminishing returns on their\ntechnology usage they will naturally\nstart to reduce their usage up to a\nhealthy amount right they'll be able to\npay attention and start to see I know it\nsounds\nunbelievable but you work on it for a\nfew months by the way this isn't like a\none week or two week thing okay this is\nlike 6 months 8 months nine months where\nyou're asking them to pay attention\nlet's experiment let's have one day with\ntech and one day without Tech or less\nTech more Tech and you tell me which day\nyou\nenjoyed ask ask them to notice and\nreflect at the end of the day did you\nhave fun today do you want to do this\nagain next week and they're kids right\nso which means they're vulnerable to\ntheir dopamine which means that if\nthey're at the playground they don't\nwant to quit the playground to go home\nand and play on technology they're like\nI want to do this forever I don't ever\nwant to go home right so you can play\ninto\nthat okay\nquestions um\nokay all right let's move\non is that good you have\nquestions\nyeah so there's a lot of good stuff so\nat what age your kids old enough to\nstart doing this so I do this when\nthey're like four or five it depends on\nthe kid but like even a four-year-old\ncan start to make some kind of choice\nand that's the big thing is that the\nearlier you start with this just like\nanything else right if you teach your\nfour-year-old to play chess or play a\nmusical instrument they will be better\nat it by the time they're\nnine and so the the moment that they\nhave some degree of self-awareness and\nthey can pay attention to their signals\nyou can start with\nthis so what if he says he wants to go\nback and watch then I would say you can\nlet them do that right so then you can\nsort of still let them do that you can\ngo back and you can say okay let's go\nback and watch and let's see how you\nfeel and then if they go back and watch\nand they say okay this is all I want to\ndo right so even in the worst case\nscenar this is all I want to do ever\nthat's when you can say as a parent\nthat's not not\nacceptable so I understand that all you\nwant to do is watch but my\nresponsibility as a parent is to help\nyou be well-rounded so here are the\nthings and we'll get to this more here\nare the things that you need to do every\nday you need to have some amount of\nsocial activity you need to have some\namount of physical activity you need to\ndo some amount of chores so if you want\nto watch all day the second you get all\nthis stuff done then you can\nwatch and what you will actually find is\nthat as long as you kind of lay out out\nlike that and sort of make sure that you\nkind of play with play the game the the\nway that the kid does so meet the kid\nwhere he's at so if the kid says all I\never want to do is watch and none of the\nAwareness stuff seems to work that's\nokay you still want to teach them and\nprepare them for life that if you want\nto spend all your weekends playing video\ngames as an adult you still have\nresponsibilities so let's take care of\nyour responsibilities first and then you\ncan\nplay\nokay is that Tech technique does that\ntechnique work on adults as well\nabsolutely so this is where I encourage\nyou all to pay attention to your\ntechnology usage so let's say you browse\nyour choice of social media or Internet\ncontent aggregator Reddit or Twitter or\nInstagram or whatever right so like the\nfirst 15 minutes that you browse\nwhatever your feed is it's like pretty\nfun but like when you're going on hour\nnumber three you're just like looking\nfor something else to make the boredom\ngo away it's not even fun anymore no one\nwakes up on a given day and is like man\nI can't wait to browse Reddit for 14\nhours at a stretch no one says\nthat and what you'll find and and so\nthis is important to understand what\nyou'll find is that the the less you use\ntechnology the more enjoyable it\nactually is because you'll develop\nsomething called dopaminergic tolerance\nso there are diminishing returns to each\nyou know hour of the game that you\nplay\nokay how would that not just lead them\nto half-ass everything that you would\nimpose on them just to be able to play\nyeah that so so then you make sure that\nthe threshold is full assing it right so\nif it's not an acceptable level of\nperformance then they have to do it\nagain and we'll get to that so let's\nlet's move\non okay\num all right so we're going to move move\nthings around a little\nbit\nokay okay let's look at the next\none so this is great so a lot of y'all's\nquestions I hope will be answered here\nat my wits end with a 9-year-old boy\nignoring basic requests I'm working on\non getting an official diagnosis for my\nson who's nine in the meantime I'm\ntrying to alter his environment to make\nhis life easier however he fights me on\nevery little thing he clearly needs\nstructure but when I try to do that for\nhim he fights it he's been arguing with\nme whenever I ask him to do something\nsimple today after finishing his\nhomework I told him he needed to put his\npaper in his folder and put the folder\nin his book bag because he has a habit\nof shoving things in his book bag and\nthen he can't find anything he proceeds\nto immediately stuff the paper into his\nbook bag I asked him why he did that and\nhe said I forgot but that makes no sense\nbecause I gave the command like 2\nseconds before he put the paper in his\nbook bag I want to be forgiving for\nstuff like this because I'm also\nneurodiverse and tend to forget things\nbut this doesn't seem like forgetfulness\nit it just seems like blatantly ignoring\nme because he doesn't care about what I\nsay it's not just this but other things\ntoo I'm not sure whether to punish the\nback talk in ignoring my demands but I\nalso also don't have the patience to be\nunderstanding of him in this area so\nthis is a very common example so kid\nseems defiant kid ignores what you say\nkid seems to forget even though you tell\nhim two seconds right before you tell\nthem give them can kid doesn't like it\nso if y'all want to bypass this and I\nhave dealt with this myself we have to\nstart by understanding the brain of\nsomeone with ADHD we have to start by\nunderstanding how their brain shapes\ntheir experience because what you see as\na parent is very different from what\nyour child experiences and once we\nunderstand how their brain works we can\ncraft a strategy that fits the child and\nwill will result in the behavior that\nyou want okay I know it sounds\nunbelievable but let's understand this\nso let's\nstart by understanding the kid this is\nthe kid's experience so the kid does\nhomework and at the very end of\nhomework parent says put this in your\nbag put this in\nfolder and then folder in\nbag this seems very\nsimple right you're just a parent you're\njust telling him hey like just do this\nthing bruh it's easy I just told you to\ndo it just do it but the kid seems like\nsuper like the kid is defined so let's\nunderstand literally what's going on in\nthe kid's brain so the\nfirst is when a child with a child with\nADHD is doing homework what this means\nis that after the\nhomework the child is exhausted they are\ncognitively exhausted so let's\nunderstand this so the child has frontal\nloes frontal loes allow them to restrain\nimpulses pay attention\nFocus okay this is what the frontal loes\ndo so normally if a if you're a\nneurotypical person and you finish your\nhomework you have enough frontal lobe\ngas in the tank that you can put things\naway properly because at the very end\nwe'll get to this in a second but with\nkids with\nADHD you don't have any gas in the tank\nwhich means that they are exhausted\nwhich means that they can't pay\nattention\nit's very difficult for them to restrain\ntheir impulses and do what you ask they\ncan't focus they're already empty empty\nfrontal loes at the end of homework okay\nthis is the pro first problem second\nproblem is I want yall to think about\nthe emotional experience of a child who\nis struggling to do homework so this is\na kid that has been doing homework okay\nI have to do homework I have to force my\nmind to pay attention I'm paying\nattention I'm paying attention I'm\npaying attention I'm finally done holy\n[ __ ] this is so hard but I'm finished\nnow I'm\nfree I did it this is so hard for me but\nI did a good job I did what mommy and\ndaddy told me to do I have my homework\nfinished I worked really hard I\nsucceeded I'm done this is a win I'm\nfree now in comes\nparent and says no no you're not free\nyou have to do more you have to do\nsomething else\nyou have to do one more thing and one\nmore thing and one more thing so think\nabout the emotional experience when\nyou're done for the week and you've\nworked really hard you've worked really\nhard for the whole week and it's Friday\nat 6 p.m. and you're like I'm done for\nthe day I'm done I'm going to head home\nand your boss walks in and says oh by\nthe way can you do one more\nthing it'll just take a minute think\nabout your emotional experience in that\nmoment and you are a full grown adult\nthis is what the child with ADHD\nexperiences the other thing to keep in\nmind is that the child with ADHD has a\ndisregulated lyic system so remember\nthat ADHD doesn't just AFF affect the\nfrontal lobes it also affects our\nemotional\ncircuitry which means that the child\nwith ADHD when when we can handle\nsomething a kid with ADHD won't be able\nto handle it emotionally so they\nexperience more intense\nemotion it is more\ndifficult to control their\nemotion so for you it's just putting one\npiece of paper in the folder and putting\nthe the folder in the book bag when\nyou're cognitively exhausted but for\nthem it's like okay now take these\nhundred papers and put them into a\nhundred different folders and organize\nthem and then put them all in your book\nbag bag in order so the emotional\nexperience is literally more intense we\nhave fmri studies that show that kids\nwith ADHD suffer from emotional\ndisregulation because the literal signal\nin their brain is more intense than the\nsignal that we\nexperience furthermore since their\nfrontal lobes are empty their ability to\ncontrol this emotional Outburst or this\nemotional response is\nweakened Okay so let's look at this case\nagain all right trying to alter his\nenvironment he fights me on every little\nthing okay he's been arguing whenever I\nask him to do something simple so when\nthe homework is done the kid is already\nexhausted and then the parent says oh\nand there's one more thing to\ndo okay it's not that and then let's go\nto the third thing okay so it's let's\ntalk about\nthis hold\non okay I asked him why he did that and\nhe said I forgot but that makes no sense\nbecause I gave the command like 2\nseconds before he put it in his book bag\nnow hold on a second so this is really\nimportant when your child with ADHD\ngives you a answer that makes no\nsense don't just assume that they are\nwrong you don't don't do\nthat if it doesn't make sense to you you\nall need to come to an accord because\nthere is something that you may not\nunderstand and this is what really\nfrustrates parents because parents will\nsay I just told them two seconds ago but\nthey forget how can they forget so let's\nunderstand a third neuroscientific\nmechanism attentional\nproblems so\nremember that in ADHD people don't\nforget this very common misconception\npeople assume so forgetfulness in ADHD\nis not a memory deficit so we see memory\ndeficits in things like Dem Dementia or\ndelirium these are actually dementia is\nlike a memory deficit this is not people\nwith ADHD have have memories that are\ntotally fine they can remember stuff\nfine the problem with ADHD is that stuff\ndoes not sink in this is the problem\nthey are not paying attention when you\nare speaking so they never hear you in\nthe first place so the more cognitively\nexhausted you are at the end of your\nhomework the hard hard it is to pay\nattention to one more thing right so I\nwant yall to imagine this imagine that\nyou're at the end of a international\nflight and you've been on the plane for\n24\nhours and then some dude in the airport\ngives you a list of like 16 things to\ndo and you just can't pay attention you\ncan listen to the first like two or\nthree minutes but at the end of it you\njust can't pay attention to the rest of\nit it's not sinking in it's not that\nthey don't forget they don't forget it\nnever goes in in the first\nplace so if your child says I forgot and\nyou're like that makes no sense it's an\nattentional problem okay so now these\nare the three problems that we have we\nhave frontal loes that are exhausted we\nhave a lyic system that is hyperactive I\nwas free but now you're taking that away\nthere's one more thing oh my God one\nmore thing that's harder to regulate and\nsince their frontal loes are exhausted\nthey have difficulty listening to what\nyou're saying now the good news is that\nwe can fix all this once we understand\nhow their brain works we can Institute\nsystems to actually correct all of these\nokay so this is where there is one big\nmistake that parents make which is to\nthink about\nwhen is the\ntiming of the\nrequest so remember that let's say\nhere's your frontal lob\nenergy so this is your child's ability\nto pay\nattention follow\nthrough even regulate\nemotions okay now here's\nhomework over time so as your child with\nADHD does their\nhomework this is this is what happens to\ntheir attentional energy and then you\ntell them down here one more\nthing doesn't work so here's the key\nthing this is what you this is when you\nneed to tell them if you're trying to\ncreate structure in your child's life\nyou cannot create structure and\nImplement structure at the same time you\nneed to plan the structure that's the\nwhole point of structure right it's\nbuilt ahead of time so if we think about\nlike you know structure in in something\nlike a house we don't build the roof\nwhen it starts raining right that's\nabsurd you build the roof way ahead of\ntime and then when it when it rains the\nroof is already ready it's ready it's\nthere everything is set up this is not\nwhat kids with ad parents with ADHD do\nwith their kids they create the\nstructure when things are burning down\nor when things are going wrong does that\nmake sense oh the kid did not put their\nthing in the proper folder therefore let\nme teach the kid where to put it no no\nno that's not creating structure that is\ndealing with a fire that has already\ngotten out of hand structure is creat it\nahead of time preemptively not at the\nmoment when you need\nit okay so here is what I would\nrecommend that we do and there are a\ncouple of other uh techniques that we\ncan use here\nokay so what I would do is literally\npractice and\nexplain\norganization so what we're going to do\nbefore we even start the\nhomework is we are going to take the kid\nand we're going to say hey so let's talk\na little bit about where our homework\ngoes before we do our homework where\ndoes homework go and this is there's a\nhuge thing that parents miss out on is\nthat they try to explain things to their\nkid but if you've got a kid with ADHD\nyou need to leverage their understanding\nask\nquestions okay so what we want to do is\nask questions you can ask them okay\nwhere should we put our homework when\nit's done why do we put it in there\ncan we leave it out on the table and\nthen put it in later what happens if you\nleave it somewhere and then you're going\nto organize it later what do you think\nwill happen and the kid is smart the kid\nknows oh maybe I'll forget where it is\nokay so then what should you do about\nthat leverage their understanding and\nthis is a big thing that a lot of\nneurotypical parents don't understand is\nyou can't take for granted the stuff\nthat is easy for you to learn see\nneurotypical people will connect the\ndots and the the whole challenge with\nraising a neurodiverse kid is that they\ndon't connect the dots the same way that\nyou do so you have to spend time\nexplaining things that otherwise don't\nneed to be explained and if you take\nthat step all of the effort of the mess\nthat you deal with down the road like\nthis this all gets fixed you just have\nto do it upfront and in the right way so\nwhat I would recommend is that you first\nhave a conversation with your child\nright so you have to like show up\nTuesday at 5:00 p.m. when nothing else\nis going on there's no homework being\ndone they have a full frontal lobe\nthey've just gotten back from their\nsoccer class we're going to sit down\nyou've had a good day let's explain\nlet's talk about\nhomework and then what we're going to do\nso we're going to start with questions\nright\noh go with\nunderstanding questions okay and then\nwe're going to explain organization so I\nmaybe I should do these in the opposite\norder okay so first thing you're going\nto\ndo number one is ask\nquestions and shoot shoot for\nunderstanding what does your child\nunderstand okay second thing that we're\ngoing to\ndo is explain if you need to because\nsometimes you'll need to explain they\nwon't\nunderstand like so you'll say okay like\nthis is why we do things so that we we\ncan find them do you sometimes forget\nyour homework do you have difficulty\nmisplacing your homework okay so here's\nthe reason that we put it in the folder\nand then all you have to remember is to\ncheck your folder you don't have to\nremember where the homework is what's\neasier checking your folder or trying\ntry to remember where your homework is\nokay good and this is the third step\nthat a lot of parents Miss 95% of\nparents miss\npractice you have to literally practice\nthis skill so what I would say is that\nokay now what we're going to do is I've\ngot three different pieces of paper that\nare in three different places in the\nhouse what I want you to do is go get\neach of those three pieces of paper and\nthen put them in your folder and put\nyour folder in your back\nbackpack now this is really important so\nyou don't just do this once you do this\nevery day for one to two\nweeks this is our task that we are going\nto\nlearn three pieces of paper in three\nfolders it takes less than 60 seconds\nonce they get good at\nit and here's the beautiful thing in the\nADHD brain we know that these parts of\nthe\nbrain right our emotional system our\nfrontal loes we have a tensal problems\nbut there is one circuit of the brain\nnot one there are many circuits of the\nbrain that are completely\nintact that function totally fine for\nkids with ADHD and as we use the intact\ncircuits of the brain their life will\nbecome extraordinarily\neasy so the first circuit that we're\ngoing to talk about or the main one is\nthe Habit circuitry this is completely\nfine so the habit circuitry is the endoc\ncanabo\nsystem so this system is not altered in\nADHD the problem with kids with ADHD is\nif you are constantly nagging them and\nthey're they don't have if there's no\nconsistency their habits can never form\nthis is the real tragedy of being a\nhuman being with ADHD is that the very\ncircuit that can fix all of your\nproblems which is the Habit formation\ncircuitry never gets enough consistency\nto form a habit in the first\nplace so there's one thing that can save\nyou and is very hard to activate that\nthing so as a parent what we need to do\nis build these habits so for two weeks\nall we're going to do is practice\nputting our thing away putting our paper\naway when we're done with our\nhomework and now what happens is if you\nInstitute this properly what you'll find\nis that for two weeks you're focusing on\nthis and then after that the kid will\nknow how to do it and once they know how\nto do it you will not have to nag them\nyou will not have to remind them it'll\nbecome habit even if they're not paying\nattention this is the key thing right so\nif we look at this remember that the\nwhole point is you're asking the kid to\npay attention restrain their impulses\nand do this extra step if the child\ndoesn't pay attention they will end up\nhabitually doing it anyway because it's\na different part of their brain so even\nif they're emotionally exhausted if\ntheir frontal loes are exhausted the\nhabits kick in that's exactly what we\nwant when the child stops paying\nattention they'll behave in the right\nway it's\nbeautiful okay\nquestions\nendoc canabo\nsystem right so so yeah so that\nsomeone's saying like what do your kids\nunderstand\nexactly so the problem is also that see\nwhen we often times if you're\nneurotypical you can connect the dots so\nit's obvious to you that if you put the\nhomework in the folder then you won't\nlose the homework but sometimes if your\nkid has ADHD you have to connect those\ndots for them right so you have to ask\nthem like where should your when you're\nlooking for your homework where should\nit be in the folder and even if they can\ncome up with the right answer it's not\nthat they won't be able to come up with\nthe right answer you have to ask them a\nset of questions and then those\nconnections will form in their brain\nthey can come up with the right answer\nbut you have to ask them the question\nand once they come up with the right\nanswer that's great they may answer\nright away but you're still like\nconnecting those dots for\nthem\num yeah so we'll we'll talk about\nnagging in a\nsecond what if the parent is ADHD and\ncan't build any habit very good question\nso this is a huge problem right is that\nneurodiverse kids often times have\nneurodiverse\nparents\nand so the beautiful thing is that it's\ngoing to be difficult but once you\nfigure out how to do this for yourself\nyou will be the best person on the\nplanet to teach it to your\nchild because you have the experience of\nstruggling\nyourself so if we look at our basic\nprinciples remember that a habit\nformation is difficult at the end of the\nday so we need to do if you're a parent\nwho has difficulty with structure is\nfirst you have to implement the\nstructure yourself and second is you\nshould practice to\nright so practice putting your keys in\nthe right place your wallet in the right\nplace literally what we'll do is like I\nI'll with my kid I will practice this\nthree times in a row go put your\nbackpack here go put your water bottle\nin the sink go put your snack in the the\nsnack container in the\nsink and now we're going to pull them\nout of the sink you're going to pack\nyour bag again we're going to walk out\nthe door and we're going to come in and\nwe're going to do it two more times we\nwill practice this and once they do it\nthree times a day every day for one week\nthen they know how to do it I never have\nto tell them again so you should do the\nsame thing as an adult it feels\nhumiliating it feels\nstupid Implement that structure early on\nin the day when your frontal loes still\nhave some energy and literally go\nthrough the\nmotions\nokay\nwhat if the kid refuses okay so we'll\nget to defiant kids in a\nsecond but this is where like when your\nchild refuses something what do you do\nright as a parent there's all manner of\nbribery con\njoling instituting limits setting\nboundaries punishment you take your\npick and this is where what I sort of\nfind is that kids don't refuse\neverything right so you have to pick a\ncouple of things and you have to figure\nout okay what's the right way to\napproach this so sometimes that's like\nif they refuse used to do this\nparticular thing you can let that slide\nokay we're not going to worry about\nhomework but we're going to put your\nshoes away we're going to put your food\naway so you can focus on one thing at a\ntime and if you run into resistance in\none place you just focus on something\nelse and then you realize as a parent\nfor two weeks we're going to have\ntrouble with homework and then you come\nback to the kid and you say okay you\ndidn't want to do it then that's fine I\ngave you two weeks now we have to learn\nit because this is causing\nproblems\nokay all\nright oh wow so I was diagnosed with\nADHD 5 years ago and recently discovered\nI've been living with black mold it has\nrendered my ADHD meds ineffective any\ntips for what I can do besides move out\nof my house that's absolutely a question\nthat I would ask your doctor um because\nI I'm not sure about the influence of\nblack mold and ADHD medication I'm also\nso curious how you concluded that the\nblack mold is rendering your stuff\nineffective generally speaking when you\nhave an environmental allergy the Right\nmedical thing is to you know get rid of\nthe allergy or move or something like\nthat not everyone is able to do that but\nI'm really fascinated by the concept and\nI'm going to do some research and maybe\nwe'll do a video about environmental\nallergies and\nADHD thank you very much for the\nquestion\num okay hi I'm 17-year-old and I just\ncan't bring myself to any good habits so\nthis is something important to\nunderstand if you have trouble building\ngood habits there are a couple of ways\nto make it easier the first problem that\nwe have with building good habits is\nthat we're too ambitious so we have so\nmany habits that we need to build and we\nneed to build them so\nrobustly so what you can also do is\nlevel up your habit formation circuitry\nby starting\nsmall okay so don't don't build the\nHabit that you absolutely need build the\nHabit that you can\nbuild so it can be something as simple\nas I'm going to put all my clothes in\nthe laundry basket first thing in the\nmorning I'm going to make my bed first\nthing in the morning starts super\nsmall second thing that we want to do is\ndo it early in the day so as we become\nmentally exhausted it becomes very\ndifficult to control our\nimpulses so the earlier in the day that\nyou it the better off you will be the\nthird thing to consider is remember that\nthe amount of dopamine in our brain is\nlike a lemon so if you sort of think\nabout it at the beginning of the day the\nlemon is full of juice so even a slight\nsqueeze something that is not that\nenjoyable will still give you a decent\namount of juice but if you play\nsomething like a video game first thing\nin the morning it squeezes all the the\njuice out of the lemon this is like a\nvery tight squeeze and then you have no\ndope dopamine left for reinforcing other\nbehaviors so it is very difficult to\nbuild a habit after you play a video\ngame but if you try to build a habit\nfirst it is going to be way easier and\nyou will get more\nreinforcement and then what'll end up\nhappening is that you'll sort of then\nyou can play a video game and that's\ntotally fine so start first thing in the\nmorning start small and the other thing\nis that a part of your mind will say oh\nmy God this isn't enough don't worry\nabout that you will level up your habit\nformation circuitry and then it'll be\neasier to build more difficult\nhabits okay if yall are curious about\nthat dopamine stuff we have a a good\nvideo about that that got uploaded maybe\nabout a week ago on how to control your\ndopamine\ncircuitry\nokay all right let's move on great\nquestions Okay\nso\num okay let's talk about someone asked\nabout nagging\nokay so how to get things done without\nresorting to anger I find getting my kid\nto do things extraordinarily difficult\nwithout resorting to some level of\ndisapproval they don't take me seriously\nif I'm not nagging snapping or lecturing\nbasic tasks like flushing the toilet\nmaking their bed getting ready for\nschool not waking up their sister at\n5:00 a.m. putting away toys Etc require\na huge amount of effort to get done a\ngentle prompt rarely gets results and\nlists signs and routines are ignored\nthey're very anxious and I see flashes\nof fear in their eyes at the smallest\nlevel of disapproval from me I remember\nbeing scared of my mother growing up and\nI don't want my kid to have the same\nrelationship with me as their dad so\nthis is super scary but once again if we\nunderstand the brain of a child with\nADHD we can figure out a different way\nto approach the\nchild so let's start by looking\nat um let's start by looking at the\neffect of some of these things okay so\nif you have a child who doesn't listen\nchances are you end up resorting to\nnagging\nsnapping or lecturing\nand even though it feels like these\nthings work these things are not doing\nwhat you want them to\ndo so let's start by understanding why\nnagging never\nworks so why do we nag because they're\nnot paying\nattention and what we discover is since\nthey're not paying attention I will keep\nreminding them you tell them once you\ntell them twice you tell them three\ntimes you're saying the same thing over\nand over and over again so as someone\nnags you what do you start doing so just\nthink about this right so when you get\nnagged in life you're not paying\nattention to begin with so we start\nnagging but the more that someone nags\nyou the more you ignore the other person\nso the more you nag your child the more\nthey will learn to ignore you the second\nthing that you're doing is you are\nactually reinforcing the exact wrong\nthings so we have to nag our child with\nADHD because they don't pay attention\nbut I want youall to think for a second\nwhen I nag my child to get something\ndone what I'm actually doing is\nenabling their\nirresponsibility okay so I I once had a\npatient and patient had a parent who was\nconstantly nagging them so kid is in\ncollege parent asks kid hey did you are\nyou sure you're you're on time to\nregister for your classes your class\nclass registration opens tomorrow do you\nhave everything under control and the\nparent the kid is like yeah I'm an adult\nnow I'm a grown-up I know how to do it\neverything will be fine the kid the\nparent is like skeptical so they ask the\nkid or hey are you sure are you sure are\nyou sure do you want my do you want me\nto call you want me to do this par kid\nis like no no no I got it I got it\neverything's under\ncontrol on the morning of registr\nregistering classes kid sleeps through\nhis alarm\nwakes up late doesn't register for\nclasses on time guess who he blames\nblames\nmom mom I know I told you not to wake me\nup but you always wake me up\nanyway now I didn't get to register for\nmy classes and it's your\nfault so when we nag our\nchildren we are forcing them to pay\nattention pay attention pay attention\nwhich means that their frontal lobes\ndon't have to do the lifting we are\nserving as a external frontal lobe for\nour child we are taking the\nresponsibility they don't need to\nremember because by the way I'm going to\nnag you constantly I'll make sure you\ndon't forget so when we nag we make\nsure it gets\ndone this is what a parent does right\nwe're making sure we're taking the\nresponsibility you remove the\nresponsibility from your child and you\nare creating\ndependence the exact opposite thing so\nas a parent you'll have noticed this if\nyou start to nag they never learn you'll\ncontinue to nag you'll continue to nag\nyou'll the more you nag the more you\nneed to nag if God bless y'all some of\ny'all are in romantic relationships with\na husband or wife who nags you or you\nhave to nag your husband or wife or\nboyfriend or girlfriend or whatever you\nwill find that if you nag them once you\nnever stop I have to nag them that's the\nonly way things get done both of y'all\ndon't like it that's because you're\ntaking the responsibility\nand then you are creating\ndependence stop\nnagging second thing let's talk about\nsnapping so remember that kids with ADHD\nthis is super scary but let's understand\nthis kids with\nADHD I see flashes of fear in their eyes\nat the smallest level of disapproval\nlet's understand the neuroscientific\nmechanism of this kids with ADHD have\nattentional\nproblems okay so let's understand this\nokay I'm going to make a diagram so\nhere's the kid with the\nADHD here's their\nthoughts A1 BC they're thinking about\nall these things now here's the outside\nworld so the outside world like a voice\ntries to enter into their con\nConsciousness\nVoice doesn't work right gets knocked\naway because their attention they're so\nhyperfocused on their thoughts that a\nregular voice does not penetrate into\nConsciousness if you are typical and\nsomeone talks to you you will hear them\nyou will stop your thinking and you will\nbe able to pay attention in ADHD it does\nnot penetrate so what do parents\nnaturally\nlearn loud voice in order to penetrate\nthe barrier of attention I have to yell\nthat's the only way that they are able\nto listen you're not wrong as a parent\nnow here's the problem this is what it\ntakes to break through the barrier but\nthe physiology the physiologic response\nwhen you're parent yells at you is still\ntriggered right so the physiologic\nresponse of being yelled at is the same\nbut the attentional barrier is different\nin ADHD what this means is that every\ntime their parent they realize their\nparent is talking to them they get a\ncortisol\nadrenaline and fear\nresponse this is the tragedy of ADHD is\nthat someone needs to yell to get your\nattention but the parts of your brain\nthat detect danger still get triggered\nfrom yelling so what this means is is\nthat every time your parent is talking\nto you you're getting yelled at the\npsychological impact is the same even\nthough the intentional impact is\nnecessary does that make\nsense okay\nso this is why the kid is fearful\nbecause the only way to get things done\nis to yell at them to to break through\ntheir attention and then let's talk\nabout\nlecturing now the problem with lecturing\nis is that there's no\nunderstanding and the kid has difficulty\npaying attention so lecturing is a waste\nof\ntime if you could give a 30 minute\nlecture to a kid with ADHD they're going\nto catch the first minute of it doesn't\nmatter how long it is doesn't matter how\nwell you explain things this is going to\nlead to frustration on everyone's part\nthe kid knows they should be paying\nattention but they're not able to you\nfeel frustrated because you've explained\nit 15 times and they don't get it that's\nbecause the lecture they can't pay\nattention to the lecture this is why we\nwant to use\nunderstanding and questioning you must\nengage with your child when you teach\nthem if they have ADHD ask them\nquestions okay so in this case what is\nthe parent trying to\ndo flushing the\ntoilet okay so like here's literally how\nI would teach my kid to flush the\ntoilet so what I would do is I'd say hey\nwhen we go potty do we flush toilets or\nnot and they say like yeah we do or no\nwe\ndon't and then you can ask them why do\nwe flush toilets they'll say to get rid\nof the poop okay we're going to do an\nexperiment every time we use your toilet\nfor three days we're not going to flush\nno flushing your toilet you're not\nallowed to flush your toilet I'm going\nto use your toilet we're not going to\nflush every time we use my toilet we're\ngoing to\nflush if you do this with your kid for 3\ndays and you don't let them flush they\nwill learn why you flush toilets they\nwill have a blast doing it let's see\nwhat it smells like after one day do you\nwant to flush nope we're going to wait\nfor a second day we're going to wait for\na third day this is literally how I\nwould teach my kid to flush the toilet\nwe'd have one toilet in the house that\nnever gets flushed one toilet in the\nhouse that always gets flushed and then\nyou pick which toilet do you want in\nyour bathroom you must teach them help\nthem understand but not by lecturing use\nexperiments use engagement kids with\nADHD are often times brilliant you just\nhave to engage their mind in the right\nway don't install an autof flushing\ntoilet completely defeats the purpose\nthat's awful you're damn right it is so\nthis is the other thing to understand\nabout ADHD kids kids with ADHD are\nincredibly sensory if you can use their\nsense organs they will understand way\nbetter okay not rub their nose in okay\nso maybe not your toilet in my toilet\nthat's cruel so this is what we're going\nto do if you guys think that's cruel\nthis is what I would say I would say you\ncan use Daddy's toilet whenever you want\nto and Daddy doesn't get to flush for 3\nDays let's see what happens or I'll even\ngive them a choice one of these toilets\nis going to be flush one of them is not\ngoing to be flushed which one do you\nwant to pick Daddy's toilet doesn't get\nflushed okay fine let's see what happens\nyou get to use Daddy's toilet whenever\nyou want to and I don't get to flush\nlet's check on it day one let's check on\nit day two let's check on it day three\ncan daddy please flush will you remember\nto flush it'll\nwork right so if you don't turn it into\na punishment so you can take one for the\noften times when I'm teaching my kid\nwith ADHD\nsomething I'm the one that gets\npunished\nokay so this is exactly what I mean so\nyou work on one thing at a time you\nunderstand how to engage them properly\nand then you go you go at it from there\nokay now with something like like\nnagging this is also where what we want\nto do is we want to take one of these\ntasks take your pick and we're going to\nwork on this simple\ntask for one to two weeks so the problem\nwith this is as a parent you get\nfrustrated with bedtime routine right so\nif you want to do bedtime routine that's\nfine we can like do bedtime routine or\nwhatever you pick one thing because your\nkid can't form 15 habits all at the same\ntime so getting ready for\nschool so let's say bedtime\nroutine not getting ready for school\nokay so what I would do is have them\nliterally practice their bedtime routine\nso we're going to brush our\nteeth change\nclothes pack our\nbag\nuh grab\nwater in case you need it overnight and\nthen what we're going to do we're not\ngoing to do it once every night that's\nnot practice see when you're learning to\nplay the piano you just don't play one\nsong you don't just try playing it once\nand then you're done for the day I'll\nplay I'll give it one more shot tomorrow\nno you're going to do this three times\nin one night for one week right every\nnight for one week we're going to brush\nour teeth three times we're going to\nchange our clothes three times we're\ngoing to change out of our pajamas back\ninto our regular clothes and we're going\nto change back into our pajamas we're\ngoing to do the whole routine three\ntimes it's going to take us 1 hour if\nnecessary what however long it takes\nwe're going to practice the routine\nuntil it becomes a habit see a lot of\nparents the mistake they make is they do\nnot explicitly practice these things\nthey just do it every single day and\nit's a fight every single day I can\nalmost guarantee you that if you do this\nthree times a day for two weeks and your\nkid spends one hour and you are spending\none hour with them they will get faster\nat it they will get better at it and\nthey will learn how to do it\nhabitually does that make sense\nso use understanding use\nexperimentation make it\nfun and really I I mean there's a reason\nwhy I didn't pick the bed right I so I\npicked the flushing toilet on purpose\nbecause what I found is that kids with\nADHD are very sensory so if some\nsomething smells they will\nlearn okay this is why I don't flush the\ntoilet if you do this and you make\nthings fun oh my God can daddy please\nflush the toilet it's been 2 days the\nflash of fear in their eyes and the\nsense of disapproval will disappear they\nwill do what you want them to do they'll\nenjoy doing it you'll enjoy doing it\nit'll completely change the dynamic\nbut no nagging no snapping no\nlecturing okay\nquestions\ngood so someone's saying whoa this\nactually makes so much sense for myself\nperfect toilet and make it fun\nabsolutely so kids with ADHD you got to\nunderstand often times kids with ADHD\nhave a different sense of humor they're\nvery\nsensory right and if you don't want to\npunish your kid right so then you take\nthe team you take one for the team\nyou'll be amazed at how quickly they\nlearn so my kid didn't like lemon just\nto give youall an example so she didn't\nlike lemon and when she gets sick she\nneeds to have something like honey lemon\ntea but she did not like lemon in the\ntea she didn't like the way it tasted so\nI said okay here's what we're going to\ndo next time you get sick we're going to\nI'm going to have you cough a glob of\nmucus into one bowl and the next time\nyou cough we're going to have two bowls\nof\nmucus then what we're going to do is\nwe're going to take a lemon and we're\ngoing to do an\nexperiment we're going to squeeze the\nlemon juice into one bowl and we're\ngoing to see what the scientific effect\nof acid on mucus\nis once we did that experiment and it\nsunk in now she has lemon she\nunderstands what it\ndoes it's beautiful engage with their\nsenses what do you all think lemon does\nto\nmucus I'm serious like this kind of\nstuff works very well right these are\nnatural bodily functions like there's\nnothing to be ashamed of with this\nstuff so you would think it makes it\nthick thinner but it actually makes it\nthicker it causes it to\ncongeal okay it doesn't dissolve or\ndigest it you'd be amazed so that's why\nlike I don't know what's what goes on so\nthere's also some evidence that when you\ndrink lemon\nit changes your pH and then you actually\nget a comp compensatory metabolic\nalkalosis from\nlemon so it actually causes it to\ncongeal so if you sort of think about if\nyou have something like um you know milk\nboiled milk and you add lemon to it what\nhappens it separates the way from the\nthe create it creates a heterogeneity\nright so like this is how you make\npaneer so you heat up warm milk and then\nyou add some lemon to it and then the\nsome of the solids come out of solution\nand then you're left with water that's\nwhat it actually\ndoes how did you come up with this\nexperiment like I don't know so\ntheoretically people say that lemon is\nsupposed to help with colds right so\nlet's just study let's see what goes on\njust engage their senses in some\nway how can you get them to not only\ndoing their chores but also seeing that\nthey have to be done okay so there are a\ncouple of things to do so with chores so\nI wouldn't say chore first of all don't\ndo chores do one thing at a\ntime and then what's the\npurpose of doing something like a chore\nright so this is where you have to show\nthem okay so if you don't do the chore\nwhat happens if you do do the chore what\nhappens so I'd start with like certain\nthings\nlike you know like I don't know like\nputting your books away so what's the\nadvantage of cleaning your room when you\nclean your room you get to actually find\nyour\nthings so showing them okay do you want\nto play with this like and if they're\nusing something like technology what I\nwould do is like i' I'd do something\nvery simple so when I use the controller\nI'm not going to put it away properly oh\nyou want to play a video game where's\nthe controller I don't know Daddy didn't\nput put it away properly you can go\nlooking for it but we're not going to\ntouch a device until you find the\ncontroller because you need to find the\ncontroller oh wow okay you did find it\ngood job the next day when daddy plays\nwith it he's going to put it in another\nrandom place we're not going to put\nthings away\nproperly right so teach them the lesson\noh you want me to put things away\nproperly this is the value of putting\nthings away\nproperly now it's your\nturn right and then have them go through\nthe Habit formation of it it's really\nimportant very important and then at\nsome point there may be certain chores\nwhich they don't understand or agree\nwith which is fine they still have to do\nthem we are not doing XYZ until this is\ndone\nokay so you also can set\nlimits right so you can illust your job\nis to\nteach the other thing that we oftentimes\ndo as parents is that we do not reward\nthe right behavior in the right way so\noften times when our kid completes the\nchore we try to bribe them with\nsomething so we'll say oh you get ice\ncream or you get this or you get this\nthe right completion of a chore is\nRaising awareness of the benefit of the\nchore so what I will do for example for\nmaking the bed is like hey like should\nwe get it does this bed look inviting to\nget into let's get into bed this is\ngoing to be lots of fun so when it comes\nto like making the bed with kids what\nI'll oftentimes do is I will so with my\nkid this is how I taught my kid to make\ntheir bed somewhat I haven't really\ntaught them but this is how I I've\nworked on it some it's not something\nI've\nprioritized but what I'll do is I'll\nI'll make the bed with them in it\nso you guys get to lay down Daddy's\ngoing to make the bed and let's see how\nthat\nfeels okay so then what I'll do is\nthey'll be laying in bed I'll set up the\npillows and then I'll put the covers\nover them right and I'll tuck I'll you\nlift that up you know you fluff the\ncovers they love it it's awesome to be\nin the bed while it's being made on top\nof\nyou okay now you do it now Daddy's turn\nto lay inside and you guys make the bed\non top of me oh my God that's so much\nfun that feels amazing\nwhat do yall think is it is it funner to\nget into a\nbed that is made or do you like to get\ninto a messy\nbed okay so illustrate whatever you\ncan right so so like someone saying so\nthey used to get Skittles for doing the\nright thing no because that just\nincentiv that just teaches them to want\nSkittles see if there is a chore that\ngets done there must be a benefit to\nit and then like that's the benefit that\nyou really you want them to feel the\nreward of the task\nitself not externally motivate them with\nsomething else this is another problem\nthat I see a lot is a lot of parents\nmotivate their kids with video games if\nyou do this you get the game if you do\nthis you get the game if you do this you\nget the game in Psychiatry we have this\nconcept of something called overvalued\nideas so these are things that people\nwill place a lot of emphasis on if the\nprize for all good behaviors is video\ngames you will actually reinforce the\nvideo game\naddiction right this is literally what\nhappens with addicts when I have addicts\nwho are addicted to heroin or fentanyl\nanything for the next fix I'll Rob for\nthe next fix\nI'll do unsavory things for the next fix\nI will work my job for the next fix I\nwill borrow money for the next fix I\nwill mow your lawn for the next fix\neverything is about to fix it's about to\nfix it's about to fix when you have a\ndrug addict who is willing to do\nanything to get enough money to buy\ntheir next fix you're not teaching them\nsobriety you can create a situation\nwhere everything that your child does\nproperly you get games you get games you\nget games you're reinforcing their\naddiction does that make sense we don't\nwant to do that help them understand the\nreward of the task itself and if you\ncannot help them understand the reward\nof the task itself maybe you need to\nconsider where whether this task really\nneeds to be done or not\nright you should question it and you\nwill respect you will earn their respect\nif you question the rules that you put\non\nthem you should hold yourself to the\nsame standard the standard is you should\ndo this because it's good but if it's\nnot good you have to be fair maybe you\ndon't need to do\nit\nokay\nall\nright let's move\non why did my child say I was\ndead hi I'm looking for advice my\n9-year-old ADHD son told his teacher\ntoday for no reason my mom died the\nteacher called to check on us and found\nout that he\nlied she didn't know what to say and I\ndidn't know how to defend him he lies\nimpulsively a lot about many things\nusually it is to avoid doing things like\nsaying he washed his hands when he\ndidn't his dad and I try our best to\nsupport him with his ADHD we are\nliterally doing everything in the book\nto help when it comes to lying we\nactually make consequences smaller when\nhe tells the truth to try and encourage\nthe behavior however I'm not sure how to\ndeal with this with it this time the the\nLIE is huge and I know this might sound\nsilly but my feelings are really hurt\nwhen I was a child losing a parent was\nunimaginable to me and now he is\ncasually lying about me dying I know\nthat he loves me but I still can't\nunderstand how and why he would say\nsomething like this I'm not even sure\nwhat is the proper response in this case\nso this is another\nexample of we need to understand the\nbrain of ADHD in order to understand\nwhat is going on and how to deal with it\nso the first thing is the child lies\nokay about something\nbig and then the parent is hurt how can\nmy child be so\nheartless I've lost a parent this child\nhas no idea what they're saying so let's\nlook at how the brain of ADHD is\ndifferent number one\nimpulsivity so in most human\nbeings there is a barrier between\nthought and\nlanguage see thinking and speaking are\ntwo different functions I can think one\nthing and I can say a different thing\nthis is the experience of most human\nbeings in ADHD oftentimes there is no\nbarrier between\nthought and\nspeaking so you will know this that\nsometimes people with ADHD can rattle on\nthey can just talk and talk and talk no\none can be paying attention they're not\neven paying attention to whether you're\npaying attention they just talk and talk\nand talk and talk and\ntalk right so now I want you to think\nabout this do you have thoughts that are\nuntrue absolutely all the time are those\nthoughts lies not really so a lie is\nwhen you intentionally speak a\nmistruth but your mind thinks all kinds\nof random things you think oh like what\nif I\nwas a gorilla instead of a human right\nthat's not a lie it's just your mind\njust randomly generates all sorts of\nthoughts right what would happen if my\nparents died what would it be like if\nthey died so your child is 9 years old\n10 years old is starting to understand\nthe concept of death so when you're\nunderstanding the concept of something\nyour mind plays around with it now the\nproblem is that with a impulsivity right\nso there's impaired frontal lobe\nfunction which means that the moment the\nthought comes in it comes out of the\nmouth so this is not a lie it is just a\nthought that is spoken out loud okay\nit's not a statement of Truth so you\nneed to understand this about your kid\nnumber one they're not lying they're\njust they had a thought and they spoke\nit out\nloud number two kids with ADHD struggle\nwith\nempathy now let's understand why this\nis so if we think about what is\nempathy so I'm over here I have my\nexperience and there's another human\nover here and they have\ntheir\nexperience and right now my attention is\nfocused on this as I become empathic my\nattention wanders and considers\nthis so literally you have to pay\nattention to someone else in order to be\nempathic so remember with kids with ADHD\nthey struggle with their attentional\ncontrol but attentional control isn't\njust about studying right your attention\ndoes all kinds of things paying\nattention while you're chopping\nvegetables you cut yourself why why do\nyou cut yourself because you weren't\npaying\nattention so empathy requires directing\nyour mind to the experience of other\npeople kids with ADHD have difficulty\nwith this it's not that they don't\nunderstand other people we'll get to why\nthey may not but that's not the problem\nthe problem is that they literally once\nthey're focused on their own perspective\nthey have difficulty stepping out of\nwhatever they're focused on they can be\nfocused on Legos they can be focused on\ntheir own perspective they can be\nfocused on the television and then it\nbecomes hard to\nDe Focus this attention and move it\nanywhere\nelse so as an example let's say I'm\nplaying on the playground and I just go\ndown the slide and there's a line of\nthree kids waiting to go down the slide\nso as I go down the slide kid number one\nstarts to climb to the top I am so\nexcited oh my God that was so much fun\nall my mind can think about is I want to\ndo it again so I run from the bottom of\nthe slide back around to the the line\nand I cut in\nline it's not that I don't care about\nother kids it's that it never crossed my\nmind to consider the impact of my\nthoughts on other human beings I did not\nthink about it this is the\nproblem right so when you have a kid\nlike\nthis they do not think think about the\nimpact right they don't even think about\nlike how what other people they didn't\neven realize they just the impulse came\nin the thought came in they\nspoke they don't have the attentional\ncontrol to consider other people this is\nsomething that needs to be trained in\nkids with ADHD now the third thing to\nconsider is that once the parent is\nhurt now Things become even more\ndifficult okay once the parent is hurt\nand why because now you're add adding\nyour own\nemotions to the equation and this is\nhard for your child to\nunderstand right so once you feel\nbetrayed and hurt by your kid all they\ndetect is the\nnegativity when the negativity kicks in\ntheir ability to understand things and\nlearn things shuts\noff so they're not their learning\ncircuitry literally shuts off and they\ngo into survival\nmode so now it's hard to have a\nconversation with them so as a parent if\nyour kid is you know if you're upset\nabout something the first thing you need\nto do is calm yourself emotionally\nrecognize that your kid didn't mean any\nof this stuff and then now then you can\nexplain things to them so once you\ndisarm the emotion and everything calms\ndown you don't teach them the lesson\nthen and there by the way so this\nanother really important tip for kids\nwith ADHD don't teach them lessons when\nthey make\nmistakes because when they make mistakes\ntheir emotions\nare activated they're\nfeeling\nafraid\npanicked they're in survival\nmode and they can't understand something\nin a nuanced way right so like if I'm\nwalking down the street and I get bit by\nan alligator I'm going to learn a lesson\nwhich is get the [ __ ] away from the\nalligator never go near alligators and\nby the way I don't walk down the street\nbut you will learn all the wrong lessons\nbecause your brain is so adrenaline\nfocused it's so influenced by adrenaline\nthat it doesn't learn things in a\nnuanced way and when it comes to\nsomething like\nempathy kids with ADHD can not learn\nempathy when they are in a panicked mode\nof mind because what happens when I'm\nfeeling fearful it's literally very hard\nit becomes way harder to think about\nsomeone\nelse when I'm feeling angry when I'm\nfeeling betrayed all I can think about\nis\nmyself so especially with empathy don't\nteach them the lesson when they make a\nmistake wait a couple of\ndays hey let's try to understand why you\nsaid what you said did you have control\nover it\neven and this is where like you have to\nteach really basic stuff to kids with\nADHD stuff that that you we all take for\ngranted what effect do your words have\non other\npeople\nreally think about start that simply\nwhat is the effect of your words on\nother people what do words what is the\nwhat is the relationship between humans\nand\nwords this is the level at which you\nneed to\nstart Let's do an\nexperiment I'm going to say some\nwords let's see what that impact that\nhas on\nyou instead of going to the pool\ntomorrow we're going to do extra chores\nI spoke words what impact does it have\non you oh that hurts instead of doing\nchores today we're going to stay up and\nwatch a\nmovie oh my God what impact does that\nhave okay now but those are things that\nhave to do with chores and activities\nthat you like how about this I really\nlove you the most you're such a\nwonderful kid what impact does that have\nversus I'm really disappointed in you\nit really hurt my feelings that you did\nnot do X Y or Z what impact does that\nhave now you\ntry why don't you try to use your words\nand see if you can make me feel a\ncertain\nway right so then then the kid will\nunderstand it'll be\nlike you look like a\nbutt and then I will be hurt right and\nthen we'll all laugh and then Daddy I\nlove you and then we'll hug and that\nfeels good okay so it looks like words\nhave an impact but are you done then no\nfor two weeks you are going to pay\nattention to words in the impact that\nthey have so when you tell your kid it's\ntime for bed you stop right there and\nyou ask them hey when I said this to you\nwhat impact did it\nhave when you got home and I said hey\nit's so great to see you how did my\nwords affect you okay so this is where\nlike you have to basically like show\nthem over and over again over a period\nof 2 weeks encourage them to play around\nwith words and see what impact it has\nthis is how you will teach them they\nhave to understand so that's the\ntrickiest thing with ADHD you can't\nteach a kid with ADHD their mind is not\nas receptive to the knowledge but the\nbeautiful thing is their capacity to\nunderstand is very\nhigh because their attention does not\nsit and listen to you for 15 minutes\nwhile you are teaching\nyou have to get their atttention engaged\nand usually getting their attention\nengaged involves experimentation paying\nattention emotional activation hopefully\nin a positive\nway\nokay all\nright\nokay let me get\nyeah you actually ask them the question\nin the moment right so for a period of\ntwo weeks what we're going to do is pay\nattention hold\non I hear a phone\nringing one second\nch\nokay I don't know where it is whatever\nokay can you all hear\nthat no so so people are saying parents\ndon't parent so it's not that parents\ndon't parent it's that the parenting\nthat we're\ntaught doesn't work for kids with\nADHD right so the parents that the\nparenting that we the default mode of\nparenting which human beings have\nevolved over tens of thousands of years\ndoesn't work with kids with ADHD it\nneeds to be\nadapted and what I literally do is I\nwill pick one or two things to work on\nfor a period of two weeks and then in\nthe moment you can remind them of stuff\nright but not when they make a mistake\nlet's pay attention to the impact of\nwords let's do another experiment let's\ncall your grandma and let's see what\nimpact our words have think about what\nyou say ahead of time what should we say\nto Grandma before she picks up the\nphone and now we're doing something very\nvery important so if you think about it\nso we normally think about what we say\nbefore we say it right but kids with\nADHD are different some people think in\norder to speak kids with ADHD speak in\norder to\nthink their thought process is out\nloud\nokay hold on a\nsecond\nokay hold on one\nsecond\nuh all right can can youall see this now\nsorry um I think this should be\nfine\nokay\nokay might they become\nmanipulative so your kids might become\nmanipulative but that's not the worst\nthing in the world so understand\nthis see being\nmanipulative is a survival Advantage\nwhen it comes to the\nworld right so like we don't want to be\nmanipulative with back intentions but to\nunderstand human behavior is like a\nsurvival benefit so this is one really\ncommon thing where a lot of parents will\nsay present a unified front this is the\nway that you can get your kids to listen\ndon't let them divide\nyou to which I say hold on a second so I\nthink generally speaking it's good as\nparents to present a unified front but\nthe goal of parenting is to prepare your\nchild for the world that they're going\nto live in and is the world filled with\nunified fronts that demand\ncompliance is it an advantage if you\nwork in a corporate environment to be\nable to understand what people want and\nAdvocate and get one powerful figure to\nbe on your side when another powerful\nfigure is not on your\nside having kids navigate any sort of\ncrack between you and your potential\nspouse or other caregiver or whatever\ncan be a very important skill to teach\nyour\nkids right let them manipulate you a\nlittle bit let them understand how to\nget what they want right there's nothing\nwrong with that you as parents should be\nintentional about it that's the main\nthing so there some cases where you want\nto present a unified front and there are\nsome cases where just like anything else\nyou're going to let them take advantage\nof you're going to teach\nthem right it's not the worst thing in\nthe world and so what so you're the kid\ngets to win because they've tricked\nmommy or daddy into giving them\npermission is that the worst thing in\nthe world like if we're talking about\nlike drug use for teenagers that's a\ndifferent story you want to present a\nunified front there are absolutely times\nwhere you want to present a unified\nfront but I've also seen as a\npsychiatrist that one of the most\ntraumatic\nthings that a child can go through is\ntheir parents presenting a unified front\nwhen one of your parents is\nwrong I've seen this in cases of\nphysical abuse emotional\nabuse where one parent is abusive and\nthen the other parent stand stands by\nand watches right and why is that\nbecause one parent is aggressive one\nparent is controlling and they control\ntheir spouse you don't always want to\npresent a unified front one of the best\nthings the healthiest things that a\nchild can experience is for one parent\nto go over the line and the other parent\nto contradict them publicly and directly\nhey I think what you're doing is wrong\nyou want to teach your kid how to stand\nup for themselves you have to model\nstanding up to Authority which often\ntimes means standing up to the other\nparent creating\nconflict\nit's terrifying unified front unified\nfront unified front no we don't have if\nI don't agree with you we don't have to\npresent a unified front and I understand\nthat the kid May manipulate us and may\nend up getting their way but I think you\nare\nwrong so we can absolutely talk about it\nand this is also where I would Advocate\nthat you and your spouse you all\ndisagree instead of just presenting\nunified front you let your child watch\nhealthy\nconflict hey child I know that you want\nto play video games your dad believes\nthis I believe\nthis we're going to talk it through and\nwe want you to listen and tell us what\nyou\nthink by all means have conflict have a\nhealthy conflict with your child\nwatching both sides they will learn so\nmuch from\nthat\nokay\nokay um next up\njust close got time for maybe one\nmore um okay let's\ndo okay let's see what we've got\nleft\nokay 10-year-old is always right and I\nam always wrong I'm sick to death of\nbeing corrected 18,000 times a day about\nanything and everything me I wish Amazon\nmusic had a really really like this one\nbutton um Netflix has always had a love\nbutton really I don't think so and I'd\nand I'd been corrected at least 18 times\nthis morning so straw camel back I chose\nto explore this H yep for 100% sure\n1,000 1 million per sure so you're\ntelling me Mr 10 year-old that you know\nthat since the day of its Inception\nNetflix had a love button yes blah blah\nblah ah Google's\nit uh Netflix introduc the two thumbs up\nbutton in April of 2022 and he doesn't\nadmit it then he rages won't apologize\nwon't admit he's wrong that I wasn't\nwrong and it's just a stupid little\nthing but I wasn't arguing about Netflix\npointing out that no one likes to be\ncorrected all the time especially when\nthey were\nright how do I teach this without being\nmy\nmother let me think about this\nso the first thing to understand\nis that if you pay attention to the\nparent the parent is so stubborn about\nproving a point\nright so if the parent is stubborn about\nproving a point what does the child\nlearn that it is okay to be stubborn\nabout proving a point even when it's\nincredibly insignificant right is right\nand wrong is\nwrong so it's kind of interesting\nbecause what the child will inherit is\nwhatever you\nsignal which is\nstubbornness so when you have stubborn\nparents you have stubborn\nkids there's a second thing to\nunderstand so when a child is 10 years\nold we have to understand their brain\ndevelopment so their capacity to engage\nin type 2 reasoning which is critical\nthinking and being able to question your\nown results is very poor for\n10-year-olds\nso in our brain we have two kinds of\nreasoning circuits we have type one\nreasoning which is our impulsive\nanswer this is the answer that we think\nis logical but is not actually logical\nso I'll give you all a really good\nexample of this so someone goes to the\ngrocery store and buys a bag of cookies\nand then you ask them after they\npurchased the cookies why did you bag\nbuy the cookies they will give you some\nreason they said I bought the cookies\nbecause my roommate loves them\nbut the real reason they bought the\ncookies they wouldn't have bought the\ncookies if they weren't on prominent\ndisplay so when they walked into the\ngrocery store they had no plans to buy\ncookies for their roommate but they saw\nthem their emotions got triggered their\nimpulses got triggered their desires got\ntriggered and they bought the cookies\nthen they will manufacture a false\nreason as to why they did it this is\ntype one\nreasoning type two reasoning is not\nrapid it is actually critical thinking\nit is logical it is analytical and we as\ndoctors learn type two reasoning it\ntakes us 4 years to train to learn type\ntwo reasoning we call it differential\ndiagnosis so I'll give you all a simple\nexample of this so we as doctors are\ntrained not to jump to conclusions but\nit is so easy to jump to conclusions\npatient walks into my office looks like\nthey have the flu sounds like they had\nthe flu the last three people I saw have\nthe flu this means that they must have\nthe flu this is how the mind works jumps\nto a conclusion all the time jumps to\nconclusions all the time so I want\nyouall to think about this when you make\nsome kind of decision how long did you\nthink about it when you conclude that\nthis guy is feeding in my game the\nreason I'm losing is because my\nteammates suck did you sit down and\ncritically do a replay analysis of 50 of\nyour games and try to figure out okay\nwho made what kind of mistakes of course\nnot you just jump to a conclusion in the\nmiddle of it and then you know it's\nbecause the reason you keep losing is\nbecause your teammate\nsuck this is type one reasoning it is\nautomatic kids a 10-year-old has some\ndegree of logic their logical circuitry\nis forming so they can jump to\nconclusions very easily but their type\ntwo reasoning is not intact their\nability to critically look at their\nideas is not developed very far as a\n10-year-old so this is why they always\nthink they're right the part of their\nbrain that can second guess yourself is\nnot very well formed that's the way to\nthink about type two\nreasoning now the second thing is what\nis the value of pointing out that\nsomeone is\nwrong in this case literally what is the\nvalue of pointing out that your child is\nwrong if you're child misunderstood\nwhether there is a like button or a love\nbutton or whatever what difference does\nit make in their life none\nwhatsoever has no bearing doesn't give\nhim better grades doesn't give him more\nfriends doesn't make him happier doesn't\ndo anything for\nthem and so when you point out when you\nstick their nose and you say hahaa\nyou're wrong what value does that it's\nnothing it's ego so when you demonstrate\nego I'm going to point out to you that\nit's wrong for the sake of it being\nwrong it's just ego and they're going to\nrespond the same way you're egotistical\nthey're egotistical people people who\nare egotistical never admit when they're\nwrong and people when they're\negotistical love to point out and force\nother people to understand that I am\nright and you are wrong so your child is\nlearning exactly what you\nmodeled\nright it's kind of weird they don't have\na brain that can figure it\nout so what do you do in this\nsituation so what I would sort of\nrecommend is the first thing that you do\nis you let it go if you don't think that\nthere's real value to\nit second thing that you can do so when\nonce you start letting things go they'll\nlet things go too as well as you start\nbeing less stubborn and egotistical your\nchild will be less stubborn and\negotistical second thing that you can do\nis you can point out to them hey I\nnoticed that you believed really\nstrongly that this was the\ncase what do you think happened there\nright so be curious don't be accusatory\nso it seems like your mind jumped to a\nconclusion what happens when our mind\njumps to\nconclusions can you pay attention to\nwhen I jump to conclusions and what\nimpact that has so this is a really good\ntechnique to use with kids when you\npoint when you're trying to explain to a\nkid that what you're doing is wrong if\nyou're trying to explain to them the\nprinciple don't make them the focus of\nthe mistake make you the\nfocus when I jump to conclusions what\nimpact do it have on\nyou cuz now you're the one who's making\na mistake and oh my God the kid loves\npointing out yeah Dad Mom yall make this\nmistake all the time I hate it when you\ndo this oh interesting you hate it when\nI do this maybe I should work on\nit what do you think should you work on\nit\ntoo let's work on it together you stop\njumping into conclusions that'll make\nyou a better parent\nwonderful and you're modeling for them\nthe right Behavior see we as parents\nwhen we try to teach lessons we don't\nrealize first of all our kids are\nmodeled after us they do what we do so a\nlot of the mistakes that your child\nmakes you make\ntoo and let them point out your mistakes\nyou're going to be showing them humility\nyou're going to be showing them that hey\nas long as like it doesn't matter\nwhether you're the parent or the child\nit's not like the parent is right all\nthe time the child is wrong all the time\nanyone who makes a mistake makes a\nmistake and I can correct it too you're\nmodeling them for them so many good\nthings humility flexibility\nthe logic of\nit right and then you sit down with your\nchild and you say I'm going to work on\nthis you should work on it too we can\nwork on it\ntogether and then you can say but what\nif the child doesn't want to work on\ntheir\npart\nwonderful fantastic if they don't want\nto work on it then you're going to give\nthem a task to work on so in this case\nthere's asynchronous effort the parent\nis putting in all the effort they're\ngoing to work on their problems the\nchild isn't putting in any effort\nwonderful let's flip it around so now\nI'm going to tell you to work on this\nthing but I'm not going to fix it how\ndoes that make you\nfeel you like that strategy wonderful\nlet's play with that strategy I'm just\ngoing to tell you a thousand different\nthings to do I'm going to continue\nmaking the same mistakes but you have to\nfix\nthem that's like wonderful let's do it\nthat sounds awesome I don't ever have to\nimprove but I can tell you to\nimprove and oh wait if the child Rebels\nagainst that because that's unfair holy\n[ __ ] maybe we should pause as parents\nand think about whether that's our\ndefault position which is that I as a\nparent don't need to improve but you\nneed to fix\neverything\nright no we not going to do it that\nway so if your\nkid refuses to admit that they're wrong\nthere are a couple of things to keep in\nmind the first is that their brain has\ndeveloped the capacity for opinions\nbut has not developed a very robust\ncapacity for critical thinking about\ntheir opinions so this is very\nnormal second thing is that often times\nthe stubbornness in the ego is model\nafter the parental Behavior which we as\nparents don't like to\nadmit right so if it's the sad truth of\nit and the last thing is try to be as\nforgiving as possible try to sort of\nencourage them to understand the\nsituation make yourself a part of the\nsitu youall should learn things together\nas parent and child this is what I found\nworks the\nbest is that yall are learning this\ntogether you're in it together you're\ngoing to practice it these are all\nreally\nimportant\nokay all\nright let's see if we have time for one\nmore\nvideo game and parenting hello X Gamers\nof\nReddit I've been following this sub ever\nso often and this is the first time\nposting because I need to get this off\nmy chest I just wanted to give a very\nbrief background of\nmyself um about three years ago I've\ndecided to stop gaming cold turkey I got\nrid of my accounts my rig anything to do\nwith gaming and I was done for good\nhonestly I haven't really looked back or\never Rel collapsed into gaming because I\nmoved on to better things and life was\ngood fast forward to 3 months ago my\nwife and I had are firstborn and ever\nsince it got me thinking of what kind of\nfather role model I want my son to have\nI'm in a dilemma when it comes to gaming\nI'm on the fence about whether as a\nparent we should forbid or limit the\nconsumption of gaming like setting time\nlimits or would that help at all or\nblocking certain games because with they\nhave addictive or manipulative\nmechanics in this community we're all\ntoo familiar with the negativity of\ngaming as a parent I do not want my\nchild to follow my footsteps potentially\nmaking the same mistakes and live with\nregrets in his life on the other hand I\ndo not wish to deprive my son from\nexperiencing life to the fullest and yes\nthat might include gaming as well\nperhaps more importantly I do not want\nhim to be left out from his peers\nbecause Dad didn't let him have an Xbox\nif I do allow some access to gaming is\nit a good idea to be involved with him\nin gaming perhaps that could be\nsomething to bond\nover um but as an ex- gamer myself the\nthought of going back for whatever\nreason is a little daunting I might be\noverthinking it too much because there's\na possibility might not even be\ninterested but I just want to be\nprepared any parents out there I would\nlove to hear your thoughts so this is\nbeautiful beautiful\npost sounds like this is a former gaming\naddict struggling to figure out should I\neven expose my kids because on the one\nhand they can get really addicted to it\non the other hand I don't want my kid to\nbe left\nout very real concern because to deprive\nyour child of gaming in today's day and\nage is potentially to socially isolate\nthem so my take on this is that we need\nto prepare our children for the world\nthat they're going to live in why do we\nteach our kids to look both ways before\nthey cross the street it's because on\nthe street there are cars this is the\nreality of the world and you should be\nprepared to live in\nit so now the question becomes how do we\nprepare our child for a world of\ninvasive\ntechnology abject restriction I do not\nthink is the best way to prepare their\nyour child right I think that they're\ngoing to use devices at some point so\nteaching\nthem how to use a device in a healthy\nway is the best gift that you can give\nyour child and you can't teach them how\nto use it in a healthy way if you don't\never expose them to it so what I would\nsay first and foremost the most\nimportant thing to teach them this\nparent already knows\nI got rid of my accounts my rig anything\nto do with gaming and I was done for\ngood honestly I haven't really looked\nback or ever relapsed into gaming\nfortunately because I have moved on to\nbetter things and life was good this is\nwhat you need to teach your child this\nis our Approach at healthy gamer in a\nnutshell build a life that is worth\nliving do not rely on video games to be\nthe fundamental source of meeting your\npsycholog iCal\nneeds and then gaming will not be\naddictive you won't even look back it's\nnot a problem at all it can then be\nrecreational so I would say teach your\nchild exactly what you learned as a\nparent the other thing to keep in mind\nis that often times I would say this is\nthe true in like 90% of cases when I\nwork with kids who have video game\naddictions the parents did not\nunderstand what they were dealing with\nthey either thought they understood it\nreally clearly or they felt completely\nout of their depth one of the two either\nI'm sure this is bad or I have no idea\nwhat's going on there's no middle of the\nroad okay this is these are the various\nconcerns it's nuanced it's complicated\nthere is no right answer there is no\nsimple answer when parents start\nthinking about gaming this way this is\nwhen they do a good job it's when\nparents make a decision and feel like\nthey understand it you can't predict the\nfuture you don't know what games are\ngoing to come out you don't know what\nyour child is going to be like you can't\nknow any of that and yet when you make\nyour mind up 100% that games are evil\nand we're going to keep it away you've\nrun into a mistake so understanding that\nyou're ignorant is one of the best\nthings that you can do as a parent\nbecause what does this mean\npsychologically this means that as you\ncollect new information you will revise\nyour opinion as you revise your opinion\nyou will be closer to the the situation\nat hand and you'll be able to give the\nbest\nguidance\nso what I would encourage for all of\ny'all and this is what we do here right\nis we try to teach\nparents how to teach their children how\nto be healthy\nGamers and that's to teach your kid hey\nso games can be fun but I had trouble\nthis is what I struggled with and here's\nwhere I am now I don't even play anymore\nso if you want to play a game right so\nlike this is the kind of thing where you\ndon't have to expose them right at the\nvery beginning or you can if you want to\nbut if you don't want to give them a\ngame that's fine when your kid asks for\na game you can say okay you want a game\nbecause you're feeling left out let's\ntalk about it let's understand why we\nhaven't given you one so far here are\nthe problems that I had here are the\nsettings that I'm going to give it to\nyou let's think about just because you\nget one doesn't mean you can play all\nthe\ntime right have all of those\nconversations and take it one step at a\ntime and you don't know what the right\nanswer\nis I do think some amount of restriction\nmakes sense in the sense that you don't\njust give them the game and let them run\nwild right you teach them okay let's\nthink about what's our job as a kid what\nare your responsibilities as a child\nhaving fun is one of\nthem but these are your responsibilities\nlet's understand how games can make our\nlife better and how they can make our\nlife worse let's pay attention to the\nimpact of gaming on our own\nlives this is the kind of thing where\ntimes my kids will walk up to me and\nthey'll say Hey Dad I want to play a\nboard game but I'm in the middle of a\nDOTA match and I will say Daddy's\nplaying right\nnow and then when we're done not always\nbut sometimes I'll have a conversation\nwith them I'll say what was it like for\nyou when Daddy was playing a game and\nyou wanted my\nattention Okay so I'm going to work on\nthat I'm going to try to give you more\nattention and I want you to think about\nthat\ntoo I want you to remember what it felt\nlike because the next time you're\nplaying a game and daddy wants your\nattention what should you\ndo and the next time Daddy's playing and\nyou want Daddy's attention what should\nDaddy do see kids understand this stuff\nreally well if you give them the right\ncalm frame of\nmind right so someone saying I wasn't\nallowed games as a kid and now I'm\ntotally addicted in my\n30s I'm a parent hell yeah I'm a parent\nI have a six-year-old and an y-\nold\nright so like I I think it's a\nchallenging world that we're we're\nraising kids in it's incredibly\nchallenging games are more addictive\nthan they've ever been and they offer\nmore potential than they've ever\noffered see when I was growing up gaming\nwas just Recreation now it's a job it's\nan industry it's a very successful\nindustry Esports\nstreaming so many careers\nborn through gaming so the world has\nchanged and we as parents need to change\nwith\nit right and I don't have all the right\nanswers but what I what I can tell\nyouall is someone who struggled with\ngaming addiction\nmyself is someone whose parents tried to\nhelp me and didn't know\nhow as someone who has helped hundreds\nof people with gaming addiction and\ntheir parents help them get to a\nhealthier form of life and now is a\nparent who hopefully is Raising healthy\nkids\nwe'll see jur is still out I'm doing the\nbest that I\ncan it's a challenging\nworld and we have see here's the problem\nwith gaming is that gaming is getting\nmore\naddictive every year it's getting more\naddictive and the problem with parents\nas parents is that like generally\nspeaking as a parent you don't have to\nstart worrying about an addiction until\nyour child is a teenager historically\nthis is when kids get into trouble with\nalcohol marijuana take your\npick we've never had to worry about\naddiction at the age of two before but\nthis is the world that we live\nin right so as parents we have to learn\nabout addictions way earlier we have to\nbe way smarter we have to pay more\nattention the world is demanding more of\nus my parents could be relatively AFK\nwhen I was seven or eight years old and\nthe consequences weren't that bad you\ncan't be AFK with your 5-year-old\nanymore because their brain is wiring\nand if it wires with the iPad if it\nwires with a heavy amount of technology\nthat wiring will take a lot of work to\nrewire right so it's\nchallenging and the the hardest thing as\na parent is that even if we live in this\nworld we don't know what the right\nanswer\nis you know our institutions are not\nregulating the addictiveness of video\ngames the only thing that you see is if\nthe game is violent it says 18 plus but\nviolence is not the problem we have\nplenty of studies that show that playing\nviolent video games does not lead to\nViolent Behavior so here we are\nregulating video games due to violence\nand there's even one study that I looked\nat that found that sociopath kids with\nsociopathic personality characteristics\nwhich is like a fair amount of them\nright all human beings are a little bit\ndifferent actually have a reduction in\nstress and cortisol levels when they\nplay violent video\ngames it helps people calm down and\nbehave in a healthier manner in some\ncases but this is what we regulate we\ndon't ulate The Addictive\npotential and so you can go to your\npediatrician your pediatrician isn't\nreally going to know what to do unless\nthey're amazing you can even go to a\npsychiatrist and I've heard this story\nthousands of times hundreds of\ntimes I went to a psychiatrist or\ntherapists they diagnosed him with\ndepression they started him on\nmedication the gaming is whatever\nthey're not really addressing\nthat right so it's challenging to be a\nparent\nreally hard whole new thing no one knows\nwhat to do and yet your child is here\nand the consequences are high because in\na year or two your child you know their\nrelationship with gaming will be heavily\ninfluenced so you have to know what to\ndo now you can't wait 5 years for\nsomeone to figure it\nout and your parents don't know what to\ndo because it wasn't that invasive when\nthey were growing up so where do you\nturn to no one knows where to go there's\nno\nanswer that's what's hard about being a\nparent\ntoday just the things that you have to\nworry about are just completely\ndifferent I want yall to just think\nabout this for a\nsecond see when you're a a a\nparent and you take your kid to the\nplayground you see the kids that they\nplay with but on the internet you don't\nget to see\nthat so on the internet your kids are\nplaying with whoever you have no\nidea imagine you're at the playground\nand a group of like 30 some 30 something\ndudes come and start playing with your\n12-year-old kid every single\nday would you be okay with\nthat this is what happens on the\ninternet there's no barrier between your\nchild and anyone else the interesting\nthing is not that the 30-year-old dudes\nare bad right so when I play up when I\nqueue up for a game of doto like there's\na 15-year-old kid and they've got Dr K\non their team hopefully that's not toxic\nwho\nknows maybe I'm toxic who knows it's not\nthat it's bad right it's okay for like a\n15-year-old to have a friend who's 30\nyears old I think that's okay\nbut the problem is that as parents\nnowadays we're not involved in our kids\nsocial lives because it's all on the\ninternet at the playground you at least\nsee who they're playing\nwith you have some\nawareness but once the headsets go on\nand they've got the gaming system in\ntheir\nroom and you go out for Valentine's Day\nwith your partner because y'all's sex\nlife is flagging because y'all have two\nyoung kids and so you carve out some\ntime to yourself who are you leaving\nthem alone with on Valentine's Day you\nhave no\nidea parenting is\nhard see a lot of people in our\ncommunity some someone's been asking Dr\nK can you help me so like I'm here to\nhelp y'all and I help y'all I've I've\nspent thousands of hours streaming\nmaking videos whatever I've been\nstreaming at least basically around six\nhours a week on average since 2019\nI've literally made thousands of hours\nof content to help\ny'all these are the people that I\nhaven't\nhelped that's why I wrote this\nbook right there's a whole generation in\nmy heart of hearts why did I write this\nbook why didn't I write a book for\ny'all I mean today we're talking about\nparents so this is for\ny'all it's because if I really stop and\nthink about it what is the one thing\nthat would fix all all of the problems\nin our community or not the one thing\nbut the biggest thing that would have\nfixed all of the problems and why we\nwere founded why we started why we're\nhere today it's because our parents\ndidn't know what to\ndo if our parents had known what to do\n20 30 40 years ago we wouldn't be here\ntoday so now the question is okay like\nif I die tomorrow how can I help I can\nhelp by helping the parents of the Next\nGeneration because the deck is stacked\nagainst us y'all\nand I've got two more coming and the\nnext two aren't going to be parenting\nbooks the next two are for y'all\nchat and if yall are parents then this\nfirst one's for you all to so you get\nall three because parents need it we\nneed to cut a parents a little slack\nokay I know they're supposed to be\nresponsible and they have to do all the\nwork and all that kind of\nstuff I know I I I talk about our our\ncommunity as if they're not parents but\nthere's a ton of parents in our\ncommunity that's why we're doing this\nwe've got some other cool stuff coming\nfor y'all\ntoo so we're gonna I guess we'll take\nlike maybe one or two more questions and\nthen we're going to call it for the\nday\num any last\nquestions how to have hope about being a\nparent\nin in the is Gen\nI don't\nknow how do you manage ADHD kids who are\nobese and seek food as their dopamine\nSource what a great question I'm going\nto have to think about\nthat I will do some research and get\nback to you Dr good game what a\nbrilliant question I have an instinctual\nanswer but I really want to I feel like\nthis deserves some research so I'm going\nto look into specifically ADHD and\nobesity Dr K is riding the Winds of\nWinter if only I could\nchat\nokay do I have content for addiction we\nwe have a lot of content about addiction\nin general but there's no guide or\nanything to\naddiction\num\nokay hello I'm 15 years old and I\nbelieve I have 8hd in attentive type\nI've been researching it a lot lately\nand relating to a lot of stuff about it\nbut my mom doesn't believe me what do I\ndo so this is really common problem\nwhere if you're like a teenager and your\nparents don't believe or listen to you\nabout your mental\nhealth this is tragic in a lot of ways\nbecause what you sort of have to do is\nlike become become the parent in this\nsituation and what I mean by that is\nlike start\nby pretend that you have a kid who's\nreally stubborn and doesn't believe you\nhow should you approach that as a parent\nright so you want to start by asking\nthem what we call open-ended questions\nand so we teach this stuff like in the\nbook right so this is where like it's a\nbook for parents and their kids but a\nlot of the techniques are very useful\nfor situations even like\nthis where I would start by asking them\nquestions like what do you think about\nADHD\ndo you think it's real what's your under\nif they don't think it's real like\nwhat's your understanding of why medical\ndoctors and professionals like why do\nthey think it's real what do you think\nthey base that on so start with really\nreally open-ended\nquestions right so start by what is your\nunderstanding of ADHD do you think it's\nreal do you think it's not real why do\nyou think it's real why do you think\nit's not\nreal here's the challenge that I'm\nhaving right so then you can share with\nthem so there's a chance that I've got\nADHD there's a chance that I don't have\nADHD now if you're right and I'm wrong\nand I don't have ADHD then you know it\nsounds like I nothing needs to be done\nabout it because it's all in my head I'm\njust lazy there's nothing to do about it\nso there's no harm right or there's\nnothing lost if you're right and I'm\nwrong but let's assume that I'm wrong\nand there are treatments for it and we\nnever pursue them so this is a situation\nwhere if you're wrong and I'm right or\nmedical professionals are correct that\nmeans that the course of my life could\nbe significantly\naltered right so this is something that\ncould be fixed and may not be addressed\nthat's what I'm concerned about and the\nlast thing is I would not convince your\nparents I would not try to convince your\nparents that you have\nADHD for any number of reasons the first\nof which is that if you're learning\nabout it from the internet people\nmisrepresent it all the time so you're\non understanding of it may not be\ncorrect so the goal that you really want\nto shoot for is encouraging your your\nparents to get an evaluation okay I\nthink I've got it you think I don't have\nit neither of us is an\nexpert what do you think about getting\nan evaluation for ADHD let's go talk to\nsomeone about it and then let let an\nexpert\ndecide I don't know how to explain this\nstuff to you maybe they'll be able to\nexplain it to you and if they're\nresistant to that then things get very\ndifficult but I found that about 50 to\n75% of kids who approach things from not\nconvincing their parents see convincing\nyour parents you have ADHD is a very\nhigh\nbarrier and half the reason that your\nparents don't believe that you have ADHD\nis because they have undiagnosed ADHD\nand they never got diagnosed with it\nthey they were just like you when they\nwere kids I was exactly the same way and\nI grew out of it I ended up fine you\ndon't need any diagnosis you don't need\nto see a shrink you don't need to see\nsome [ __ ] person who's going to\ndiagnose you with stuff and no that's\nall Bs I did fine I ended up okay and\nyou're the same way this is the reason\nwhy many parents think this\nway so convincing them that you have a\ndiagnosis means running up against that\npsychological pile of\ncrap their own struggles when no one was\nthere to help them their own\nfrustrations that all comes pouring out\nand they built up these hard defense\nmechanisms to protect themselves in\norder to survive and they're going to\nhelp you survive to do we're not going\nto do any of that Namby pamby mental\nhealth\nstuff so don't try to convince some you\nhave ADHD try to advocate for an\nevaluation and even if they won't let\nyou see a mental health professional you\nshould still see a\npediatrician right so you generally\nspeaking will see a pediatrician the\nnext time you see a pediatrician usually\nwhat will happen if you're a teenager is\na pediatrician will ask you hey do you\nwant are you do you is there anything\nyou want to talk to me about in private\nor they should ask your parent to leave\nthe rooms they can ask you questions in\nprivate if they ask you for to be seen\nin private you can say\nyes or if you don't want to ask it in\nprivate you can just even ask them my\nmom and I have been discussing recently\nabout like whether I have ADHD or not I\nwas wondering if I could get an\nevaluation just ask your doctor now the\nball is in their Court your parent May\njump in and say they don't need an\nevaluation but then the medical doctor\nshould do the right thing in that moment\nwhen a when a child asks for mental\nhealth services and a parent says they\ndon't need it it is the doctor's\nresponsibility to help\nyou so that's the last thing you can do\nif no one else like if your parent is\nunwilling to listen great\nquestion so\nhard\num what's your opinion on parenting\ndifferences between cultures for example\nin Japan parents often sleep with kids\nuntil adolescence while they that may be\nseen as overly dependent in the west I\nthink there's cultural differences in\nparenting so I think generally speaking\nI mean I don't think one is right or\nwrong I think that the biggest mistake\nyou can make with cultural parenting is\nassuming that your parenting is\nobjectively correct because you come\nfrom a culture that's a mistake that\neverybody\nmakes and you know I have certain\nparenting norms and things like that I\nalso come from a culture where\nco-sleeping is way more\ncommon so I I think it's just different\nlike different people have different\nlives they have different\npressures um you know so I think it's\njust they're different cultures and I\nthink it's really important to recognize\nthat cultural parenting usually evolves\nfor a reason it's not that it's\nobjectively correct it's that whatever\nparenting Styles we have often\ntimes succeed in the environment that we\nhave so in the west we Foster more\nIndependence and Independence is\nimportant kids potentially get kicked\nout of the house at the age of 18 which\nmeans they probably need to start\nlearning Independence at the age of two\nor three on the flip side in eastern\ncultures we have more of a community\naspect the individual is not more\nimportant than the community or the\ntribe and so you have a population like\nIndia like 1.4 billion people and like\npeople have to learn how to Value the\ncommunity over the\nindividual so there's just not as much\nland in India right the density of\nhumanity is much\ngreater similar thing is true in Japan\nso like you know 90% of Japan is like\nmountain or something like that I don't\nknow exactly what the statistic is so\nyou have very densely populated cities\nand you have Community Living is very\nvery important that's why everyone's so\nrespectful well it's not why I mean it's\ndense in India as well but people aren't\nnearly as\nrespectful\nokay all right y'all thank you very much\nfor coming\ntoday we've got um I think we're\nstreaming potentially on Wednesday stay\ntuned and um yeah so how to raise a\nhealthy gamer is available for\npre-order uh basically anywhere where\nyall can find books so if y'all are\ninterested in learning about you know\nhow to raise your kids without you know\nby decreasing the risk of Technology\naddiction how to teach them a healthy\nrelationship with gaming definitely pick\nit up if yall have a a kid who is a\nlittle bit older and you need to like\nreally work on what you think is an\naddiction there's a lot of good stuff in\nthere and then in general I think the\nbook is also teaches our fundamentals of\ncommunication so if yall are like not in\neither of these situations but you have\na spouse or sibling who struggles with\ngaming that can be very helpful and then\nthe last thing is there's just a lot of\nGeneral communication stuff that is\nreally good that applies to stuff\noutside of gaming so the frame of the\nbook is going to be a little bit off but\nthe techniques are still very very\nsolid estimated release date is March\n12th so thank you all very much for\ncoming today and we will catch youall oh\nso just a reminder that if yall\npre-order we're going to have a couple\nof special bonuses for y'all one is you\nget uh a chapter of the audio book which\nis read by yours truly and then we are\nalso having a special Q&A for people who\npre-order so we recognize that the book\ncovers a lot of ground but there are a\nlot of edge cases that may not be\ncovered so if youall have a specific\nquestion then please ask it and then\nwe'll sort of get around to it okay the\npre-order Now button doesn't work by the\nway okay great to know thank you so\nmuch we are still\nscuffed\num\nthank you so much\nchat as\nalways um thank yall so much for all of\nyour help all the questions that y'all\nask all of your participation and I'm\ngoing to look into a video about ADHD\nand obesity so thank you very much for\nthe person who asked that\nquestion\num so for people who are asking how can\nthey contact me I don't generally\nspeaking get I don't answer questions\ndirectly for the most part and the\nreason for that is very simple it's\nbecause any question that I answer\nhopefully other people can benefit from\nso if I have a choice like you know if\npeople ask me like private questions I\ncould theoretically answer them but then\nI couldn't answer public questions and\nthat would only benefit the person that\nI'm that is asking the question so I'm\nall for getting your questions so we\nhave everything from you know live\nstreams like this yall can post things\non our subreddit there's a chance that\nI'll get around to it we also have some\nother places like we've got um a\ncommunity space where questions get\nasked uh that yall can ask questions we\nalso have opportunities like this with\nthe pre-order where there's a lot of\nspaces where we receive questions for\nfrom you all\nso\nyeah okay"
