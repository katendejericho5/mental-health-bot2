    "transcript": "a growing number of opthalmologists that\nI know are getting concerned about these\noil glands in the eyes that will\nessentially die out because people are\nnot blinking often enough so when you\nplay video games or look at a screen the\nrate of your blinking actually goes down\nand if you don't blink enough your eyes\nwill dry out and the consequence of your\neyes drying out is actually that there's\nthese little oil producing glands in\nyour eyes that will actually stop\nfunctioning and so there's a growing\nnumber of people who like require eye\ndrops and stuff and external lubricants\nbecause this is happening it all has to\ndo with your blinking rate so I try to\nminimize my screen time even when it\ncomes to things like reading so blink\nchat when you play games who can blink\nmanually while doing anything I don't\nknow can you blink manually it's hard"
