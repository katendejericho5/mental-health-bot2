    "transcript": "the problem with depression is that we\nhave an inciting event something\ngenuinely bad happens this has an\nemotional reaction this then turns into\na cognitive bias which then we have a\nbunch of ambiguous stimuli or even\npositive stimuli that we start\ninterpreting in a negative way and then\nwe discount this stuff so this cognitive\nbias is what then what happens is the\nworld that you live in becomes\nobjectively worse because of you're\nfiltering out information so if you're a\ndemoralized programmer changing your\npercept strengthening your perception\nwhich is one of the things that we have\ngotten the weakest at in our society I\nthink the number one reason why mental\nhealth is getting worse in the world\ntoday is because our powers of\nperception have gotten weaker I actually\nI talk about this quite a lot is there's\na joke that I have which is the only day\nthat the way that people act on April\nfools day is the way that they should\nact in general which is they meet the\ninternet with scrutiny they say wait a\nminute is that real before they\nimmediately engage and kind of go on\nwith it and April Fool's Day is the only\nday that happens and that should be\nevery day April Fool's Day should be\nevery day yeah love that"
