    "transcript": "so if you feel like you're always an\noutsider there's no tribe for you my\nsincere advice is that you look at the\nimpact of that feeling and the biggest\nproblem is that often times if we're not\ncareful just like narcissistic behavior\nif we're not careful it will always\nbecome a self fulfilling prophecy\nbecause if you go somewhere and you feel\nlike an outsider then you're not going\nto go back and now you have one more\ndata point of a community that you\ndidn't join and now your mind is\nthinking wow like I don't even know if\nthere's a community out there for me\nbecause I've gone to two and now I'm\ngoing to community C I don't know if\nthis is going to work maybe I'm just a\nloser and I'll never make friends you\nwalk into that Community with that bias\nin your mind it's difficult to form\nconnections why because you have\nself-dialogue you're talking up here\nyour mind is all up here you're not even\npaying attention to the signals and we\nknow this that once you start to believe\nthat there's no tribe for you your brain\nfilters out and actively removes any\nreassuring or welcoming signals and\namplifies negative signals and the most\ndamning of them all the ambiguous\nsignals get interpreted in the negative\nway"
