    "transcript": "we've evolved to do this like have this\nproblem with future discounting which\nbasically means that we as a human\nspecies this is the way we've evolved\nvalue a dollar today more than $2 a year\nfrom now so we our brains are wired\nthere's a part of our brain called the\nnucleus succumbent and it's wired to\nValue things that are immediate more\nthan things that are distant and so if\nyou sort of think about it for a second\nright let's say I've got two things to\ndo I want to play a video game let's say\nit's Friday I've got to play a video\ngame and I've got to fill out an\napplication so my brain looks at this\nproblem and says okay I've got these two\nthings to do and due to future\ndiscounting I can do my work today and\nthen I can have fun tomorrow but\nliterally my brain values fun today more\nthan fun tomorrow this is why we\nfundamentally as a species procrastinate"
