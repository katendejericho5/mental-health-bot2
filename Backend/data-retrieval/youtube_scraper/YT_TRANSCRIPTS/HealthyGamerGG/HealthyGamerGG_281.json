    "transcript": "so let us understand why do we do not\nwrite into the air this is a deep\nspiritual concept when we write on the\npaper what happens to the writing it\nbecomes something to hold on to so all\nhuman beings want to hold on to things\nthis is the problem so we why do we take\na photo instead of enjoying vacation I\nwas on vacation at a Bach and what I saw\nis no one is enjoying the beach and what\ndo they do they take picture and then I\nasked why are you all you are doing a\nthousand people are taking pictures all\nthe time I ask why are you taking\npicture so I can remember if you sit and\nactually enjoy then you will create\nmemory what is your memory of vacation\nis taking pictures instead of actually\nleaving we take a picture of a beautiful\nflower because we want to hold on to\nthat flower forever we will frame it and\nput it up but instead you are right we\nshould write only in the air live in the\npresent if you go to concert no need to\nrecord on your phone listen to the music\nenjoy the life right in the air let go\npaper"
