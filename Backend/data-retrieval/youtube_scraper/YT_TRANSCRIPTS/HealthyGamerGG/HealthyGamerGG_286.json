    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\ndevelop consistency in your life as a\ngamer now if you're a gamer chances are\nyou're trying to level up your stats\nlike motivation or discipline or\nwillpower or building habits because if\nyou can do all that you will be\nconsistent the problem with consistency\nhas nothing to do with net motivation or\ndiscipline or willpower the core problem\nwith developing consistency is that you\ndon't know who you are you think you are\nliving your life but you're not living\nyour life you are constantly spawning\ninto some random dude's life and it once\nyou realize this your ability to develop\nconsistency will become way easier so\nthis was originally a discovery that\nYogi in the Himalayas made thousands of\nyears ago that the source of suffering\nand problems in our life has to do with\naidia or ignorance of our true selves\nand this is actually the case in your\nlife too because you kind of know that\nyou're not the same person every day\nright you may have dreams of oh man\nremember that one day that one week back\nin March of 2023 when I woke up and I\ndid everything that I was supposed to do\nman if only I could be like that person\nand every day you wake up and you wish\nyou were that person but the problem is\nthat you're not that person that the you\nactually fluctuates quite a bit and if\nwe want to understand how to develop the\nright consistency in life we have to\nunderstand how to live life hey just a\nquick note a lot of people will ask\ndiscuss what do I do next and that's why\nwe built Dr K's guide It's a\ncomprehensive resource that distills\nover 20 years of my experience both as a\nmonk and as a psychiatrist and it's\ndesigned in a way that's tailored to fit\nyour needs so if you're interested in\nbetter understanding your mind and\ntaking control of your life check out\nthe link below so this is something also\nthat I think Gamers will be pretty good\nat because we can sort of look at okay\nhow do we win in a video game how do we\nget good at a video game what are the\ngeneral principles and how can we apply\nthat to to life so let's start by\nunderstanding so if you want to play a\ngame and you want to be good at it you\nhave to understand the flow of the game\nyou have to understand the kind of\ndirection of the game right so there's\nthe early game and in the early game we\nsort of level up and we prep things so\nthat we can hit our mid game Power Spike\nand then once we have our mid game Power\nSpike then it's just about not screwing\nup and closing out the end game right\nyou've got your advantage then you can\nkind of close things out the problem is\nthat much like your Pub matches when\nyou're playing your life there's no\nin consistency there right your early\ngame is like yeah I'm going to like not\npay attention in high school I'm not\ngoing to develop good study habits\ntherefore I'm going to go into my mid\ngame of like college and 20s with a\nsignificant disadvantage and since I\nhave a significant disadvantage this\npart of my life is really going to suck\nand then I'm kind of going into my late\ngame of like 31st birthday and now we\nhave this like trash of like an early\ngame and mid game and then we kind of\nWonder oh my God like how how did I get\nhere right we're playing the game of\nlife with some like Elon Musk Elden ring\nbuild which is like hey I got a level up\nlet me just dump a point over here and\ndump a point over here oh that item\nlooks cool like I'll start using that\nitem this is the way that we're living\nlife there's no consistency because we\nhave no sense of the flow of the game\nand this is the other problem is that if\nyou really stop and think about it\nyou're not playing the game of life as\none person in fact that's the whole\nproblem is that you wake up on a\ndifferent day and you're actually like a\ndifferent person so the key thing that\nwe need to understand is that if you\nwant consistency you have to start by\nunderstanding that you don't exist\nBeyond today that your life is actually\na multiplayer game where random people\nare waking up in your life and get to\nlive life one day at a time now you may\nsay but Dr k no these are all these\npeople are me no this is the problem\nthis is what the yogi said this is a\nVidya you don't know that this isn't\nactually you you're just a random person\nliving this life one day at a time and\nthat may sound weird but think about it\nfor a second right because what do you\nlove to do you love to screw over\ntomorrow you right so here you are on a\ngiven day and it's like okay well like\ntoday I have to like go through the mail\nand I have to do laundry and oh yeah I\nhave to fill out those applications for\ncollege but do you actually do those\nthings no of course not why not you tell\nyourself I will do it later but it's not\nthe you that has to do it later it's\nthat next guy or girl who has to do it\nlater I'm going to leave this for the\nnoob tomorrow and so you spend your life\nenjoying today and then you wake up\ntomorrow and then who do you get mad at\ndo you get mad at yourself sort of you\nget mad at the dude that came before you\nright because that person damn it why\ndidn't that guy do this crap that needed\nto be done instead I'm waking up today\nand I have all this stuff that this\nperson yesterday did not do so if you\nreally stop and think about it the basic\nproblem with life is that you don't\nrecognize that you only get to live for\nthis moment in time this is the only\ntime that you get to be in charge and\nthis is why you are so neglectful right\nbecause if we sort of look at it when\npeople have no conception of the future\nwhen they have no sense of stewardship\nwhat do they do they screw things over\nfor the next person and this is exactly\nhow we live our life I'm going to do\nthis today because tomorrow me can\n clean up this mess and so the\nyou actually f U Ates quite a bit and\nthis runs deeper than the mind right so\nwe know that desires fluctuate emotions\nfluctuate the problem is that it runs\ndeeper than that it's not just at the\nsurface levels of the mind it's your\nvalues it's your choices it's the life\nthat you're crafting you can wake up on\nJanuary 1st 2024 and decide this is the\nyear that I order a uh learn to play a\nmusical instrument and then you order a\nmusical instrument and then since you're\nan Amazon Prime member it shows up in 2\ndays and two days later it's January 3rd\nand you're like you know what but I\ndon't want this anymore the person that\nyou are has changed so what do we do\nabout this how do we start to live a\nlife of of consistency if we ourselves\nchange every single day and this is the\nfirst thing to understand is that so far\nyou've been trying to build a consistent\nlife assuming that you are the same\nevery single day but the whole point and\nyou know this is that you're not the\nsame every day right this is why you are\nso attached to a former version of\nyourself so many people in our community\nare like man I wish I could go back to\nbeing this person that I used to be I\nwish I could I wish I could have learned\nwhat I am today I wish I could have\nlearned that 10 years ago and then my\nlife would have been completely\ndifferent if you really stop and look at\nyour experience of life you recognize\nthat there's a lot of fluctuation in so\nwhat do we do about this so the first\nthing to sort of really tunnel down into\nis that if you live a life temporarily\nif you're just inhabiting your body for\none day what would your life actually\nlook like and this is where chances are\nyou would kind of screw things up right\nthis is why public toilets people piss\non you know piss all over the public\ntoilet because they don't have ever have\nto use it again this is why public\ntoilets are such a mess because there's\nno sense of stewardship because I can\nleave it for the next person and if you\nlook at your life and you lack\nconsistency what's going on there you\nare leaving stuff for future you to deal\nwith right you don't want to deal with\nit today and people may Wonder well why\nis that and this is where there's an\ninteresting bit of Neuroscience that\ncomes in so if you look at the human\nbrain we've evolved to do this like have\nthis problem with future discounting\nwhich basically means that we as a human\nspecies this is the way we've evolved\nvalue a dollar today more than $2 a year\nfrom now so we our brains are wired\nthere's a part of our brain called the\nnucleus accumbens and it's wired to\nValue things that are immediate more\nthan things that are distant and so if\nyou sort of think about it for a second\nright let's say I've got two things to\ndo I want to play a video game let's say\nit's Friday I've got to play a video\ngame and I've got to fill out an\napplication so my brain looks at this\nproblem and says okay I've got these two\nthings to do and due to future\ndiscounting I can do my work today and\nthen I can have fun tomorrow but\nliterally my brain values fun today more\nthan fun tomorrow this is why we\nfundamentally as a species procrastinate\nso what do we do about this we have to\nunderstand that we are inheriting this\nlife from the person who came before us\nand we are custodians of this life for\nthe person who comes next see our life\nis not one where we exist from moment to\nmoment to moment it's some weird body\nswap comedy and all of those body swap\ncomedies what happens this person's\nConsciousness gets transplanted into\nthis new body and what what does their\nlife become their life becomes a\nplayground of there's $10,000 in the\nbank account well I'm going to buy\nwhatever the hell I want to because this\nperson who will come after me will have\nto clean up that mess so we really have\nto accept this so I want youall to start\nliving your life as if you're playing a\nvideo game but you're only playing it\nfor 5 minutes at a time if you're\nplaying a MOBA game and someone else is\nlike in the bathroom and they're like oh\nno the que popped start playing the game\nfor me how are you going to play that\ngame even though you won't get the joy\nof winning are you going to start saying\nlike Okay like lol I'm going to screw up\nthis person's game and then they can\ninherit it 5 minutes from now and then\nwhat whatever no when you sit down to\nplay the game if you really pay\nattention you're going to try to play\nthe best game that you can even though\nyou're not going to get the joy of\nwinning then you step out of the seat\nyour friend steps into the seat and then\nthey take over and when that second\nperson steps into the seat they are\ncustodians of the game for five minutes\nthey don't get to see the victory right\nthey're only playing for five minutes\nthey're swapping for someone else and\nthen that next person plays the game\nwhen do games go wrong when someone\nwho's sitting stops playing in 5 minute\nintervals when someone who's playing for\nthe first 5 minutes and your enemies\nfeed then they think oh my God the game\nis lost everything is screwed and then\nwhat do you start doing you start ining\ndown mid and you start over the\nguy next who comes next and then when\nyou respawn you're in this game but\nyou've screwed things up for yourself\neven more see this is the key thing to\nunderstand when we connect our present\nday to some kind of outcome we recruit\nthe nucleus\nwe begin to tilt everything gets Tangled\ntogether and we actually lose control\ninstead how should you play a game where\nyou've you know gone 0 and two and mid\nand things are not going well okay I am\na custodian of this game for the next\nfive minutes how can I play this game to\nimprove things for the person who comes\nnext this is exactly how you should live\nyour life so my my favorite example of\nthis actually comes from outside of\ngaming so many years ago I used to love\nwatching this show called Top Chef and\nin this this this one particular episode\nof Top Chef they had this really cool\nchallenge where they had teams of chefs\nand there's a team of five chefs okay\nand they have to make a dish the only\ncatch is that one person goes into the\nkitchen starts cooking for about 5\nminutes and then they leave the kitchen\nthe next Chef on the team comes inside\nit's almost like a relay race and they\nhave to figure out what F Chef number\none was thinking and then they have to\nsort of continue their process and then\nthey leave after 5 minutes Chef number\nthree comes in tries to figure out\nwhat's going on and then tries to do the\nbest and move things along the\ninteresting thing is that if you start\nliving your life this way if you start\nby really acknowledging that you are not\nthe one who gets to live the remainder\nof your life you don't get to win at the\nend you are just a custodian for today\nit will change the way that you live\nlife ironically it will help you\nactually build consistency because if\nyou just exists for today what kind of\nLife do you want to set up for the\nperson tomorrow now some of y'all may\nsay say but I don't care about the\nperson tomorrow if I'm just living for\ntoday why wouldn't I be like the body\nswap comedy person and just burn through\neverything so this is where we have to\nunderstand another aside so this is\nwhere self-compassion becomes very very\nimportant and a lot of people misunder\nunderstand this they really struggle\nwith things like motivation and stuff\nlike that but if you really don't love\nyourself what is the point in making\nsacrifices for your life see we make\nsacrifices for things that are worth it\nso I can afford to eat healthy today or\ngo to the gym or whatever if the person\nI'm doing it for is worth something\nright we sacrifice for those that we\nlove and if you're in a situation in\nlife where you don't love yourself why\nwould you sacrifice for something that\nyou don't love and this is why if we\ndon't love ourselves it can become very\nhard to make sacrifices today for a\nbetter tomorrow because we don't care\nabout the person who's inheriting\ntomorrow so we've got to be super\ncareful about this particular pitfall at\nthe end of the day if you want to live a\nlife of consistency paradoxically what\nyou really need to do is recognize that\nthere is no consistency within you you\njust get to live today you don't get to\ndecide what happens tomorrow because\nyouve tried that right you tried that\n some time ago where you're like I'm\ngoing to play games today the person\ntomorrow can do the work and what\nhappens when you wake up tomorrow the\nperson is like ah I'm not going to do\nthe work today I know I said I would do\nit yesterday\nbut today I'm not going to do it and you\npunt things along punt things along punt\nthings along so just accept that you\ndon't actually live your life you are\njust a temporary custodian you're\nconstantly spawning into this person's\nlife and once you start doing that then\nask yourself how do I want to live this\nlife today am I going to set things up\nbetter for the person who's going to\ninherit tomorrow or do I want to be a\nhedonistic and create a mess for\nthe person who is is inheriting tomorrow\nand the whole problem is that we end up\ndoing the latter thing because we think\nthat there is consistency because we\nthink that we can make up for it\ntomorrow but that's impossible if that\nworked none of us would actually be here\nso I know it sounds bizarre but\nparadoxically understanding a little bit\nabout gaming understanding the flow of\ngame can help us understand this ancient\nprinciple of aidia or ignorance leading\nto suffering and problems in our life we\njust have to adapt it a little bit for\nthe gamers in our\n[Music]\naudience"
