    "transcript": "so I'll give you an example my favorite\nexample from when I was in college and\nwas terrible at dating so allo likes a\ngirl I'm Olo by the way in this story\nand Olo wants to ask out a girl and Olo\nasks out a girl and girl says no Then I\nfeel ashamed but I'm not really aware of\nmy emotions but then what happens I\nstart making these statements to myself\nand to other people to anyone who will\nlisten I'm not that into her you know ah\nher loss the self bull yeah right the\nself begins yep now this is not\nlike analytical and so then literally\nwhat the ego does is it goes your budy\nand it says hey bro we're feeling bad\ngive me a selective interpretation of\nthis give me something that feels\nlogical that can help us feel better so\nwe're going to selectively ignore all\nthe stuff that she's I'm in love with\nher and she's amazing and and all this\nkind of sh and then just give us all\ngive us all the bad things about her\nbecause if we can put her down we can\nfeel better about ourselves and then we\ndon't have to feel ashamed of ourselves\nthis is how it works makes sense okay I\ncan see that"
