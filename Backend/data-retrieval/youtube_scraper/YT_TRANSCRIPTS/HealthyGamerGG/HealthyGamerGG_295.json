having me\nback um so great to be here um I'm Dr\nMichaela thorderson I go by Michaela or\nDr Michaela if you're feeling\nparticularly interested in remaining\nformal um I am um a clinical child\npsychologist by training um in specialty\narea but have really done a lot of my\nwork through my career across the\nlifespan and across a a couple different\nsettings um for people who are just a\nlittle bit experiencing mental health\nconditions all the way to people who are\nexperiencing some pretty severe symptoms\nso I think that's like a brief\nintroduction yeah awesome and so what\ndoes your day job look like right now Dr\nwhat do you want me to call you do you\nwant me to call you DR thers or\nMichaela's good okay no Michaela's good\nyeah thank you um my day job currently I\nwork with the Children's Hospital in\nSouthern California and I run a couple\nprograms that are exclusively for um\nsuicidal youth okay so one of those\nprograms is an intensive out outpatient\nprogram which is something where kids\nand their families come to for about 13\nto 15 hours a week and then one of those\nprograms is a short-term brief\nstructured interview vention to provide\nsafety for kids who are experiencing\nSuicidal Thoughts while they're getting\nconnected to Services um to get that\nlong-term care awesome cool and so today\nwe're going to be talking about women's\nmental health right yeah yeah so what\nwhat have you seen like what's going on\nwith women's mental\nhealth um that's such a fun question um\nI think that\nuh I don't really know when we started\nto pay a little bit more attention to\nthe fact like women and men might be a\nlittle bit different um and then\nnoticing that a lot of our foundational\nresearch in mental health um had was\nvery male heavy was very white heavy was\nvery like middle socioeconomic heavy and\nso uh we built a lot of stuff on\npremises um explicitely focused around a\nmore narrow group of folks not\nnecessarily recognizing how different we\nall are as human beings and so I don't\nknow if it was like 20 years ago or when\nthat started where we started thinking H\nwe should actually start to think about\nhow applicable this is across like\ndifferent groups of folks um and so one\nof those groups obviously is you know\nwomen um and then I think just kind\nof diving into the fact that women are\ndifferent not just for from our biology\nand there are some obviously really\nclear differences in our biologies but\nalso um a little bit in our brains and\nthe ways that our brains function\nbetween like um women and men uh but\nalso the way that Society treats um\nwomen and the way that that affects uh\nthings in really big ways and that we uh\nwe kind of in some ways have a hard time\npulling apart the differences between\nwhat is a biological contribution and\nwhat is a social contribution because\nsocial\ncontributions kind of start in in the\nwomb so um yeah I think that I think\nwe're really starting to into what are\nthose differences and how do we\nunderstand them and what do they mean um\nas like a Global Perspective um and it\nreally just does affect so many\ndifferent things um I think a thing that\nhas been well I'll pause there but um I\ndon't what do what are you kind of\nthinking and seeing in the areas of like\nwomen's mental\nhealth\num yeah so that's an awesome explanation\nI have so many questions for you but I'm\nI'm happy to answer so so I I I think\nlike you said I I think there's some\nfundamentals in just to give you an\nexample so there's some fundamentals in\nour models of disease that are very um\nmale Centric so the simplest example is\nI was looking at um research on so I've\nhad several uh female patients who have\nlike diagnoses like ADHD and we sort of\nso if you look at like even the\ndiagnostic criteria of ADHD it's like\nfixed over time that's the whole point\nis that you have these kinds of\nimpairments and that we sort of view\nADHD as like relatively constant whereas\nthere's actually a ton of emerging\nresearch that the symptoms of ADHD will\nfluctuate depending on your menstrual\ncycle so if we sort of think about like\nthis is such a deep deep deep\nfoundational thing is that once you have\na disease the disease is the disease not\nthat it fluctuates and it's different\ntwo weeks out of the month versus two\nweeks out of the month so even the fact\nthat you have one biological organism\nwhich is like a man which does not\nappear to have hormonal fluctuations\nwhich affect everything from Pain\nsensitivity to cognitive function to\nsleep to appetite there's so many\ndifferent things that are hormonally\naffected and so this sort of means that\nlike you know I've even had patients\nthat we've realized like so like\npatients will come in and we'll start\nthem on a stimulant medication or\nsomething like that and then some weeks\nit seems to really help and then some\nsome weeks they come in and they say\nlike oh like we've already know what the\nanswer is now but this is really\nconfusing right because they don't teach\nyou this in med school so they come in\nand they're like yeah the medication\nWorks fantastic oh my God and then they\ncome in two weeks later and they're like\nthe medication like I'm having all these\nside effects and this is going on then\nlet's stop it and then two weeks later\nthey're like the medication I I it's I'm\na mess I need the medication again okay\nlet's start it and then like it's really\nconfusing and then you sort of realize\noh actually so the the pathophysiology\nof the disease process is fluctuating on\na week toe basis and it's even gotten to\nthe point where sometimes I will\nprescribe stimulants like depending on\nwhere people are\nso a third you know you don't take the\nstimulant every day like around this\nparticular time we're going to take the\nstimulant around this time you may not\nneed it and so there's all kinds of\nfluctuations which don't get\nconsidered um so so that's just like one\nexample of something I'm seeing but\nthere's also stuff like on what I would\ncall kind of like cognitive load um so I\nI think that there's a lot of while\nthere's I think generally speaking we're\ntrending towards equality in a lot of\nways I think that um women struggle with\na lot of like cognitive load in\nrelationships MH so even if if uh I mean\nI I certainly saw this in in my\nrelationship where like when we started\nto have kids like the default like who\nwas mentally responsible for stuff like\neven if our workload was 50/50 who was\nmentally responsible for stuff is\nusually my wife that's changed now but\nso it's it's kind of interesting because\npeople will sometimes perceive an equal\namount of like physical labor being done\nbut I think that people don't really\nacknowledge we don't really acknowledge\nas a society that if no one takes care\nof something it's usually the a woman in\nthe family unit that is ultimately\nresponsible for a particular thing now\nthere there are particular situations\nwhere you can argue against that you can\nsay things like Financial Security is\nsomething that is primarily like the the\nthe male in the relationship has the\ncognitive load for that there's\ndefinitely some evidence of that but I\nthink there's just a lot of stuff that\nwe sort of take for\ngranted which is which I'm seeing affect\nwomen more and more and more especially\nas we move to dual income households two\nprofessional careers and then when you\nthink about like you know having kids or\nsomething like that the work is almost\nnever like\n50/50 um so there's all kinds of I I\ndon't know what you're looking for but\nlike I've seen stuff that's a little bit\nmore societally like cognitively like\nthis is not like a mental illness thing\nand then I've absolutely SE seen things\nthat are diagnostic\num and and I also think that we there's\ncertain fundamentals of our diagnosis\ndiagnoses which are also biased against\nmen as well so I think we you know as\nyou're kind of saying over the last 20\nor 30 years we've realized that we\ncannot apply one system to like everyone\nequally\nyeah\nyeah um yeah so if you've got a response\nto that you can go otherwise I've got\nquestions for\nyou uh I mean that the the cognitive\nload I think is is such a fascinating\nconcept right because it is that\ninvisible hidden work that typically\nwomen are doing um and that there are\neven like the first layer of things that\na lot of you know traditionally men try\nto do to like help actually end up\nadding you know like hey I wanna I want\nto cook dinner tonight or I wanna what\ndo you want oh I'm gonna just order food\nwhat do the kids prefer you know and\nit's often the moms who are thinking\nlike oh well you know that one won't eat\nit if the pepperoni touches the cheese\nor yeah you know things things like that\nso um and then there's also the\nemotional labor too of like thinking not\njust like oh I here's what I know about\npreferences but also I'm implicitly the\none who's responsible for the nurturing\nfor the making sure people are okay that\nI have to check in somebody had a hard\nday um and the ways that we do that in\nour\nin our I mean we talk about a lot like\nin a family unit with partners and kids\nbut also that often female children are\nare more expected to check in on their\nparents hey you know my parents are not\nhaving a good time female people are\ntraditionally checking in on their\nfriends more often and so that is\nsomething people are thinking about but\nit's also you know oh I also expect I'm\nexpected whether people are saying with\ntheir words I'm expected to do these\nthings I'm expected to be available to\nhold it together so that I can kind of\ndo those things so C can I ask for like\num a little bit more detail around so\nlike you you mentioned this phrase of\nhidden work um so can you tell us like\nwhat that means and sort of explain the\nconcept and maybe like offer an example\nor two of what that could look like or\nwhat you've seen as a\nclinician yeah I mean just coming off of\nthe holiday season you know that\neverybody celebrates really differently\nbut that they're um often times across\ncelebration Styles and groups of folks\nit is often the women who are doing the\nthings like oh um what am I thinking how\nam I going to make my space beautiful\nhow am I going to make it look festive\nhow am I going to uh who needs presence\nand who doesn't need presence and what\ndo they like and what do they already\nhave and so these are all things that\nare in your mind that are not being kind\nof even necessarily even talked about\nbut there's a lot of work being done\nwhether that's just thinking or whether\nthat's hopping on Amazon and you know\nwindow shopping or running through a\nlist of things or looking up activities\nto plan or hey my work group um we'd\nreally like to celebrate the holiday St\ntogether so what's that going to look\nlike and so then there's the sure\nsomebody sends out an invitation or a\ntext message and it doesn't even have to\nbe formal but what went behind that text\nmessage was thinking things like well\nwe're all really busy on Monday and\nTuesday and you know Wednesday's\nprobably the best day because people\nhave family commitments over the weekend\nand then I'm going to look up a\nrestaurant that we can all go out to but\nit's not too expensive but it's going to\nhave gluten-free options because you\nknow um Sarah she doesn't eat\ngluten but all that looks like has been\ndone is somebody picked a place and sent\nout a text message to invite the group\non a day and so that that hidden work\nthat goes into\nsometimes a ton of different activities\nI think that when these kinds of things\nstarted coming up on my socials and I\nwas like oh mental load oh cognitive\nload and then looking into that in\ndifferent\nways you start to pay attention to all\nthe things that you're doing that are\nyou know hidden hidden pieces a\ndifferent example um on some of the team\none of the teams that I run there was\none person who was kind of doing all of\nthe planning and prepping and photoc\ncopies and making sure that different\nsupplies were ready and and they were in\nthis like on and off very quick cycle of\nburnout so they would be okay and then\nbe falling apart and the rest of the\nteam is like what's going on with you\nand it was going so now we created what\nwe I mean we call it a quarterback sheet\nbut we created a piece of paper that\nbasically just explicitly identifies all\nthe different pieces that need to go\ninto a day of work and now people have\nto sign up for each individual task so\nit's not inadvertently falling to one\nperson um who's doing all the work and\nthen also not being recognized for it\nbecause that's the kind of piece of that\nhidden labor is that nobody even knows\nyou're working that hard so it's a\nliterally thanless job yeah wow that's\nreally cool I I like the idea of this\nquarterback sheet and so so it sounds\nlike there's a lot of hidden work that\nis that is planning in nature or\ncognitive in nature but you also\nmentioned that a lot of the emotional\nlabor oftentimes Falls to women can you\ntalk a little bit more about\nthat yeah so thinking about\num uh let me see like um think about\nfriend groups right so um friend groups\nmaybe traditionally are single gender\nbut now are being a little bit more kind\nof like Diversified um on average and so\na lot of times it falls to like if\nsomebody is having a hard day or a hard\nweek or is going through a rough time um\na lot of times within a friend group\nit's the women or the females who are\nexpected to be the ones who are more\nresponsive or um if somebody kind of\nlike has a conflict or you know\nsomebody's like um I'm always dramatic\nand I'm like oh unleashes the theory but\nyou know so somebody's like kind of\nsnaped at people right if it's um a\nperson who like is more male we are like\noh you know we write it off we let it go\nthere's not an emotional uh component to\nthat person often saying like oh now I\nneed to apologize I need to make sure\nnobody's feelings were hurt versus um\ntraditionally women will be like oh I\nnow need to think about the group I I\nneed to not just like I'm having a hard\ntime I need to talk about it but I need\nto make sure everybody else is okay I\nneed to make sure that I haven't you\nknow disrupted our you know friend\necosystem I'm the one who needs to go\ncheck in with everybody else and see how\nthey're doing and a lot of times in\nfriend groups or you know groups of\nhumans like women will will hide their\nown\nemotions because they want to take care\nof everybody first and that's both there\nis some biological contribution to that\nbut it is heavily socialized um that\nwomen are expected to be the nurturers\nthe emotional um caregivers yeah so\nwhere does that sense of responsibility\ncome from like how how does that\nhappen yeah it's so interesting I mean\nit's if when I first started looking\ninto the research around this I was like\nkind of like mind blown because there's\nresearch that says that from the moment\nthat um a woman finds out the sex of her\nbaby the people around her start\ntreating the baby differently this is\nbefore the baby has exited the mother's\nbody the people are talking about the\nbaby about if if the sex is female um oh\nI'm sure she's going to be beautiful\nshe's going to be so so nice she's going\nto be lovely and boys are typically\ntalked about as like strong and smart\nand you know that they're going to\naccomplish things and then thinking\nabout that language continues obviously\nafter the babies come out of um the womb\nbut then thinking about like what toys\ndo we give very tiny children and boys\nget cars traditionally right cars action\nfigures um you know superhero\nthings like that eventually like guns\nand swords and you know fighting and\nbattle stuff and girls get girls get\ndolls and they play dress up and then\nthey get shopping carts and cute little\nkitchen um and sometimes there's a\nlittle bit more variability when kids\nare ler but once they start getting to\nthey're hanging out with other kids so\nlike kindergarten or when other kids are\ngoing to come into the home and I\nliterally was just talking to a parent a\ncouple days ago who would who's saying\nthat they let their kids play with any\nchoice they want but once he got to like\neight or nine they really were like oh\nwe should take the dollhouse out of your\nroom I want to help you because if your\nfriends come over and see you have a\ndollhous that might not go so well for\nyou and so even in families that are\nlike accepting and we're not going to\nforce kids to have certain\ntoys eventually the message is hey\nbecause you are a boy you're not allowed\nto have a dollhous because you're a boy\nwe got to take the kitchen stuff out of\nyour room um and so it's really\ninteresting the way that and if that's\nthe way that we're talking about kids\nand their activities and their interests\nwhen they're really little it would be\nlike kind of silly to think that oh that\njust changes you know one day yes um so\nthat that caregiving right that H\nfocused that\nbabies um it starts so early it's so\ninteresting\nand and you mentioned that even uh girls\nare more sort of emotionally responsible\nfor parent parental well-being so can\nyou talk a little bit about like\nparentification of children or or and\nlike what that sort of looks like and\nhow that affects women\nspecifically yeah um and I'm a little\nbit less coent on like the research\naround these pieces so I have kind of\nlike just a a superficial level of the\nres\nunderstanding especially because this\ncan vary heavily by culture um so like\num country um you know and then the way\nthat gender roles are kind of normed and\nthen the ways that those genders are are\nand are not allowed to be outside of the\nhome so this this can vary kind of more\nwidely um but often times women but\nespecially eldest females right are put\nput in the roles of like many parents\nand so initially that is helping with\nany younger kids um it's also helping\nwith tasks around the house so the you\nare as the oldest female you are the Sue\nChef right so you're going to help\ncutting chopping things up you're going\nto help with dishes um or any other\nthing so I I am an eldest daughter and I\nas an adult love wrapping gifts like Lo\nit because as soon as I knew that Santa\nwas um cily visiting my household um I\nwas responsible for wrapping all of the\npresents um and so that was just my\ndefault task even after other siblings\num kind\nof made different you know awarenesses\naround Santa um I was still the one who\nwas responsible for wrapping all the\ngifts and um um there are there's\nactually a little bit of um research\naround this but there's a lot of stuff\non my socials that's about how like a\nlot of oldest girls don't want kids or\ndelay having children if they do want\nchildren because it's either like well I\nneed to make sure everyone else is okay\nfirst is one hypothesis or there's just\nsome fatigue like I've had kids since I\nwas five so I'm not sure I want more\nkind of a situation and then as your\nparents kind of enter a different phase\nof life now instead of having children\nyou have parents that you're responsible\nfor checking in and scheduling doctor's\nappointments\nand taking them shopping or you know\nteaching them how to use technology so\nthat they can stay connected because\nboys would be more traditional like do\nthey have the money can I send them\ngroceries but girls are G be like oh but\nthey're lonely um you know I need to\nhelp them feel not sad and kind of\nthinking about those pieces yeah that's\nthat's so fascinating so just a couple\nof things and by the way uh Michaela\nthank you so much for sharing all this\nthis is this is I think exactly what we\nare looking for um so just a couple of\nthoughts one is you know it's\ninteresting because you talked about\nbeing the eldest girl and sort of\nneeding to rap presentence so in my\nculture there is also a age difference\nand a gender difference the gender roles\nare very very segregated traditionally\nin Indian culture and so since my I\ndidn't I don't any sisters so I became\nso so the youngest brother becomes fills\nthe role of cuz like the the eldest\nbrother is like the patriarch right so\nin the same way that the eldest daughter\nbecomes sort of parentified and becomes\nthe mini parent so the the eldest\nbrother becomes somewhat of the mini\nparent um in in Indian households but\nthey also get sort of turned into Golden\nBoys uh and then so as the younger\nbrother I sort of fill in the female\nrole so like I fulfill the daughter's\nrole so whenever like my mom needed help\nin the kitchen like my brother got to do\nwhatever he wanted to do but like I was\nsort of the SF so it's it's something\nthat I resonate with a lot um the other\nthe other really interesting thing is\nI'm I'm reminded of so many of the the\nwomen I've I've worked with in terms of\npatients of mine and the other really\ninteresting thing is I've noticed now\nthat I'm thinking I never thought about\nthis before that I had a group of I've\nhad a group of women\nwho are always the punching bags in\ntheir family these are usually older\nwomen so they're the punching bags of\ntheir siblings they're the punching bags\nof their kids they're the punching bags\nof their parents so like you know if\nlike you know let's say they have\nthere's a brother there there's like a a\n35-year-old with who struggles with\naddiction and they're 51-year-old sister\nis somehow like the place that everyone\ngoes to so parents like lean on them CU\nlike parents can't handle it at this\npoint or their other siblings or like\nother like cousins show up and they'll\nbe like you know kid has an addiction\nyour mom and dad are like too like\nthey're too gullible like they don't set\nlimits like so then who do they turn to\nthey they turn to this particular person\nand then so they sort of almost become\nthe default punching bag and I never\nconnected now that I'm thinking about it\nthey are actually all the oldest\ndaughter in in the relationship or in in\nthe family unit so like and even parents\nwill kind of I mean their their own kids\nwill kind of get mad at them too there's\nsome kind of like and I think that's\nwhat what kids will pick up on is\nthey'll see the the family Dynamics\nright so like who who is okay to blame\nwhen I'm having problems this is the way\nwe all treat that person and then\nespecially if it's been happening for\nthat person's like whole life right they\nalso this is how I am treated this is\njob this is my yes exactly so so just a\nhuge part of the therapy is like let\npeople [ __ ] make their own mistakes\nright because when you try to stop them\nthey hate you for it so it's a lose lose\nsituation if you try to stop them and\nthey don't listen and things go wrong\nanyway they still end up blaming you\nbecause if you hadn't interfered\neverything would have been fine I'll see\nthis especially when when we have\nmothers who have daughters or sons who\nare in unhealthy romantic relationships\nso this in-law situation right so the\nmother-in-law is like always the bad\nthing and speaking of like societal\nconditioning I I think it's kind of\nshocking like even my kids started to\nworry a little bit about like when they\nstarted to understand that like parents\naren't permanent and that sometimes\nthings like divorce happen they were\nterrified of their hypothetical\nmother-in-law because the mother-in-law\nis always the villain stepmother yes oh\nsorry stepmother sorry that was aian\nslip so in in my culture it's the\nmother-in-law always villain but it's\nthe stepmother yes you know they're\nviewed is is very evil and conniving and\nI was just kind of thinking as I read\nstory after story after story to my kids\noh my God what are we step how are we\nsetting up stepmoms for failure you know\nlike before they even enter the picture\nthere's a whole conditioning around\nstepmothers being evil yes but it's so\ninteresting to think about some of my\npatients and just how they kind of like\nfall into this this scenario of like um\nthere's one patient that I'm thinking\nabout who uh you know patient comes into\nmy office and they're like I'm\nfrustrated you know I I'm in this I'm\nthings are stressful at home I said well\nwhat's what happened they said well so\nyou know my my son is registering for\ncollege classes and they're they're 21\nyears old and so a couple days before I\nsaid hey are you did you register yet\nare you going to register mom is nagging\nthem right and so so kid says I'm an\nadult stop treating me like a child\nthey're like did you set your alarm\nyou're going to have to register for\nyour classes they get a frantic phone\ncall 3 days later Friday at 1 p.m. I\ndidn't get any of the classes that I\nwanted I'm stuck with these [ __ ]\nfreshman times 8 AM classes why didn't\nyou call\nme why didn't you wake me up uhuh and\nand so this is so interesting to kind of\nhear you talk about because I've seen it\nso much I never put the pieces of the\npuzzle together because someone comes in\nand we're like okay let's understand how\nto set boundaries right um right yes and\nso we'll we'll sort of work on that and\npeople get better but I I never sort of\nconnected this pattern together uh so so\nit's it's cool it's really interesting\nto see things get connected I mean I I\nenjoy seeing that I'll be able to I'm\ngoing to reach out to a couple of my\npatients and be like hey I didn't never\nrealize this but you know I was\nwondering did you ever think about being\nthe eldest daughter and what role that's\nplayed for you but that's so cool thank\nyou so much for sharing that um yeah and\ndid you have something else you wanted\nto add or something you wanted to build\non or I mean I think um can\nhearing you talk about like oh wow these\nkind of like missing pieces that we're\nkind of connecting the Doss on um and I\nknow we were kind of thinking about\ntalking and you mentioned ADHD before\nbut there's also like how many things\nthat we have um been able to socialize\nwomen into to hide some of the mental\nhealth conditions or like developmental\ndifferences that people are born with\nand it's kind of this message of like\nyou're fine just tow the line as long as\nyou can get there you don't need help\nyou don't need support and so because\nsocial influences can be so powerful how\nwomen kind of then get maybe missed or\nneglected in some of the things where we\nespecially developmentally could use a\nlot more support but also things like\ndepression and anxiety like you know\nyou're supposed to be a perfectionist as\na woman so like that's not anxiety\nthat's adaptive or or oh you have a\nperiod so of course you're Moody\nsometimes like it's the hormones rather\nthan recognizing that either it's maybe\na true depression or that our hormones\nhave some powerful effects on our bodies\nand brains and that sometimes that more\nthan what is actually expected\nnormatively and that there may be\nsomething kind of going on there that\nthat person needs more support around so\nI think that like just this topic like\nso many different like pieces kind of\nlike pop up when we're thinking about it\ncan I ask you a couple specifics about\nthat yeah okay so can we talk about\nneurode Divergence and and like autism\nspectrum or ADHD and girls women so you\nmentioned that you know there's a lot of\nTowing the line there's a lot of uh you\nknow masking that goes on if you want to\nexplain what that means so so can you\ncan you just tell us a little bit more\nabout how we treat or\naddress girls who are neurode\nDivergent yeah so thinking specifically\nstarting with like the autism spectrum\ndisorders um and that um pretty much the\nbiggest brain difference across people\nwho have autism or don't have autism is\nthat kind of like social orientation and\nso people with Autism often have\ndifficulties or differences in their\nability to either perceive social cues\nand put them together in the same way\nthat we can or that some like social\nelements may be more overwhelming right\nso like eye contact for example like I\ncontact's like pretty intimate pretty\npersonal in coup therapy there's a whole\nthing where you're supposed to like\nstare into each other's eyes for like\nthree minutes uninterrupted to like\nreally connect or something which like\nholy cow all that to illustrate\nthat eye contact is very intimate and\nvery intense so if you're a person whose\nbrain naturally is a little bit\noverwhelmed by that intimate connection\nand you're avoiding eye contact UM but\nfor women you're expected to be social\nyou need to do the things as a woman\nthat you know you're oriented you're\nconnecting and so we um\ncorrect nonsocial behaviors a lot faster\nin girls and a lot more intensely and so\ngirls learn that okay I have to do these\nthings because my environment is kind of\nsaying like you're unacceptable the way\nyou are and so they they kind of get\nthis really intense influence from the\noutside that they need to act a certain\nway that doesn't mean that it is all of\na sudden gone that oh now social things\nmake sense to me or now I'm totally\ncomfortable with like hugs or making eye\ncontact or having like close connection\nor close physical proximity it just\nmeans I don't know what I'm supposed to\ndo with this except act like I'm okay\nwith it um and so the the actual support\nin either learning some of those things\nor having different kinds of\nrelationships never happen because\nthat's just it's it's a hidden\ndiagnosis and um as I was kind of\ntalking about the research earlier when\nwe first did research on on the autism\nspectrum disorder we were not looking at\ndifferences between boys and girls and\nboys were being diagnosed at\nsignificantly higher rate than girls\nwere so obviously boys are more likely\nto have\nautism well when we started actually\nlooking at girls with autism and\nthinking about like oh hey you know what\nthere may be differences here that we\nare correcting and changing and when you\nlook at that the diagnostic rates have\ngotten closer and closer over time um so\nthat's you know just like oh it's not\nthat there's there's a like oh boys have\nmore autism it's that we're not as good\nat finding girls with autism oh\ninteresting and then it's the same yeah\nso it's it's very um yeah very\nfascinating and then I've I've recently\ndived into the world of like um on some\nof my socials some like lived experience\naccounts so those are accounts that are\num either hosted by people with\nconditions or are kind of designed to be\na place for people with these different\nmental health conditions to talk about\ntheir experiences and their conditions\nso not research based not evidence-based\ntreatment like those things that like\nyou and I are really socialized to be\nfocused on um and have been really\nreally intrigued at the power of like\nself- diagnosis or that like um\nsometimes what we think of as the\nevidence-based like first line\napproaches so for autism that's ABA or\napplied behavioral analysis um might not\nfit for everybody or might not take into\naccount the perspective of the person\nwho's going through that thing so for\nexample like the the eye contact in ABA\nyou train praying kids with autism to\nmake eye contact and so I've kind of\nbeen hearing from like these communities\nthey're like that's not helpful to me\nlike why would you make me essentially\nthey were giving like a a metaphor of\nlike staring at a painfully bright light\nwhy would you force me to do that why\nwouldn't you dim the light why wouldn't\nyou say who needs to look at lights\nyou're still in the room and so I think\nthose are some other perspectives of\nlike oh our treatments are bringing\npeople who have fundamental differences\nand saying no you have to fit into the\nway this Society currently is um and\nthat women are often the ones who are\nimpacted more by that and so then you\nknow you grow up as an and you get to\nadulthood not understanding some real\nbig pieces about yourself and then you\nget to adulthood and you're like holy\n[ __ ] this makes so much sense I have had\nthis difference there's nothing wrong\nwith with me I'm just different but no\none ever acknowledged it no one ever\ngave me base to be\nmyself um I've just been acting like a\ndifferent person for so long um and then\nyou could imagine like the depression\nand anxiety that comes with that and at\nsome point it's like do you have a\nmental health condition or are you just\nhaving a natural reaction to being like\nlowkey rejected your whole life um so\nreally interesting pieces around like\nthe gender differences yeah that's f so\nso I I think it's so interesting how one\nof the things that I've seen especially\nwith neurodivergence um and\nand one of the things that's really\nshocked me\nis how neurot how for granted\nneurotypical\nparents I don't even know how to say\nthis so when you're a neurotypical\nparent with a neurode Divergent kid and\nyou instruct your\nchild it's amazing how how for granted\nwe take that our child can put the\npieces of the puzzle together so like\nlike I'm even thinking about my own kids\none of whom may be on the neurode\nDivergent Spectrum somewhat and then so\nit's so interesting because for one of\nmy kids I can just tell them like hey\nlike if you do this like people will be\nupset with you and and she's able to\npiece together the puzzles and she\nunderstands it right away but like for\none of my kids I had to sit down and\nexplain to her like this is what how\nfriendship works like yes she she did\nnot have an instinctive understanding\nof why like how friends work and then\nand then like I I sat down with her we\nhad a 45 minute conversation I could see\nthe light bulbs going off in her head\nand and just really trying to explain to\nher I was like okay like who is your\nfriend and who is not your friend why is\nthis person your friend why is this\nperson not your friend where she's like\nI don't like this person because they do\nthis and I like this person because they\ndo this and and I was like okay which\none do you do well and she's like well\nsometimes I'm I'm like these people who\nI don't like and I was like and so what\ndo you think that that means she means\nthat oh so people won't want to be my\nfriend oh and then she kind of like gets\nit right and it's it's it's amazing just\nhow for granted we take when we we tell\nsomeone you know like for example when\nyou mentioned the eye contact we just\ntell someone just look at someone we\ndon't really understand what that\nexperience is doing right so we'll sort\nof\na correc behavior may have some arum I\nknow that ABA is about you know\nall neurod people to function in a\nneurotypical world yes um and and at the\nsame time I've also seen cases you know\nI had a patient I don't know if you're\nfamiliar with a condition called\nmisophonia um but but me you oh\nyeah that was highly contentious at\nfirst right like that's not a real thing\nand now it turns out like oh oops yeah\nthat is can you talk about that\num I it was so in our like diagnostic um\nmanuals right like misophonia there's\nthere's like the the main chapters that\nthat are right established can you start\nwith what misophonia is oh misophonia um\nso it is and I don't have like the\nperfect language for this but it is like\na condition\nand that may actually be identifiable\nthrough neuro uh like brain Imaging\nstudies I'm not 100% sure on that but um\nwhere and at first it was like oh it's\nall sounds and then it was like well\nthat's not true and then it was like\nsome sounds but specific ones and now it\nturns out that different people have\ndifferent kinds of sounds that\nare essentially like\nexcruciating for them to\nexperience um and so you know naturally\nwhen we have trouble with something the\ntreatment is exposure just keep keep\ndoing the thing until it no longer\nbothers you um and uh for misophonia\nmost people with misophonia my\nunderstanding is have a really hard time\ndoing that because we're putting them in\nan a physiologically excruciating\nsituation that honestly like how often\ndo you sit next to somebody who's eating\npotato chips or chewing ice like not\nthat often so do we really need to\ntorture people so that they like hear\nreal loud awful sounds until they're\nlike kind of okay with it like probably\nnot um but in the like you know research\nfield because this is something that is\nreally hard to study because a lot of it\ninitially was like a very subjectively\ndescribed\nexperience um it was just like well\nobviously that's not a real thing and so\nyou've had this like group of people who\nhave been going through life like\nseriously suffering at times um like I\nknow I um know a couple people who I've\nworked with who um will not go out to\neat um except at restaurants that like\nonly serve salads or you know that have\nsoft foods so that they're not in a\nrestaurant where other people may be\ndoing things and eating is like just a a\ncommon place where just a lot of\ndifferent noises are coming around um\nbut yeah it's it's a very interesting\nfascinating yeah so my understanding of\nit is that so if you kind of like look\nat you know we get these auditory\nsignals that enter our ear and then\ntravel to this part of our brain and\nthen our brain interprets an auditory\nsignal in a particular way and with\nmisophonia something about not the sound\nitself but the way that our brain\ninterprets the sound is incredibly\npainful or uncomfortable it it's kind of\num you know I I one time the best way I\ncan sort of describe it is is kind of\nlike nails on a chalkboard right like\nThe Sensation that we get when there's\nlike nails on a chalkboard is like what\npeople with misophonia get when they're\nyou know people are\nchewing and and so and and for a long\ntime I I I have seen patients that went\nthrough exposure therapy because that\nwas the treatment and my take on it is\nthat they've just been like traumatized\nfrom that\ntherapy um yeah and and really it's it's\nstrange like the more I kind of dig into\nit the more like if you take a step back\nand really look at okay so what happened\nover time as you engaged in this ther\nthey just got more and more and more\ntraumatized from these repeated\nexposures and then everyone was kind of\ntelling them like hey you've got to be\nstrong you know like you can do it and\nlike keep doing it yeah and and so then\nthere was also this it'll get better\nyeah and and then there's this personal\nassociation of failure if you don't get\nbetter right we got to try harder we got\nto up it and so the the more it hurts\nthey're like oh is this hot let's turn\nup the heat let's you know and it it's\nit's it's crazy like um and anyway so I\nI've seen a couple patients like that\nand it really makes me wonder about I\nalso wonder if there's something related\nto neurod Divergence because if you look\nat things like arfid or you know the the\nsensory um on the autism spectrum\ntextures of food yeah yeah so so you're\nkind of saying that uh when it comes to\nwomen specifically first of all\nthat uh girls are\noftentimes we can you talk a little bit\nmore about like masking and sort of\nsocietal pressures and how we take\nneurodivergent girls and what we do to\nthem and and sort of how that affects\nthem yeah so um because our gender\nexpectations are for women to be social\nand emotionally attuned and um kind of\nlike aware of other people um girls are\ngetting messages\nalmost not even almost like immediately\nthat they need to be playing with other\nkids right it's okay for a boy to not\nnecessarily go play sports he can go\nclimb a tree and nobody's going to be\nlike what's wrong with that boy why is\nhe climbing a tree why is he all alone\num it's okay for a boy to be really\nexcited about rocks and bugs like that's\nsure boys like rocks they throw them um\nyou know boys like bugs like they're\ncool um but if a girl is off by herself\nit's like whoa the girls are sitting in\na circle playing or all the girls are\ndoing something together like that girl\nis a problem we need her to go have\nfriends be with the other people and\nthen we most people don't do what you do\nDr K and say like hey wait a second like\nthis is why friendship's important this\nis what's going to help be helpful for\nyou this like let me break this down for\nyou so you can understand it in the way\nthat your brain needs to be able to\nunderstand it and instead they're like\ndon't do that you need to play with the\nother girls and it's not often like\nangry or punitive it's just like oh let\nme help you you need to go do these\nthings um one of the things that we look\nat in kids on the oism spectrum disorder\nis something called parallel play so\nwhen you put kids with other kids at a\ncertain age they play together well kids\non the Spectrum uh will play next to\neach other so they're not in any way\nplaying together um it's like if I was\nplaying Call of Duty sitting next to you\nplaying Halo we're not on the same game\nbut we're just like having a good time\nbeing near each other um and so we\ntypically allow boys to do that for a\nlonger period of time and then notice\nlike oh wow that that's unusual we need\nto do something about it versus girls\nwho engage in parallel play get pretty\nimmediate corrective messages that they\nneed to be playing together that they\nneed to be doing it together so for\nthose girls that are neurod divert\nthey're like uh oh I guess I'm going to\ndo this thing but I don't understand it\nand I don't actually even really like it\nbut everybody else needs to understand\nit around me and then as those girls\ngrow then they start to feel very\nanxious about being around other kids\nand so they either do the like I'm just\ngoing to have one or two friends or I'm\ngoing to keep masking but always feel\nlike everyone understands this in a way\nthat I don't people seem to be getting\nthis in a way that doesn't make sense to\nme\nbut they don't know how to ask and I\nmean think about you've done this with\nsounds like one of your kids when\nsomebody actually asks you a question\nlike how do you make friends or how do\nyou um have a Roman like how do you how\ndo I get a\ngirlfriend it's like\nuh yeah that's actually a lot more\ncomplicated like if you try to break\ndown the pieces well like you have to\nmeet people well how do you meet people\noh okay and you know you have to go all\nthe way back to the very\nfundamentals but even if kids especially\ngirls on the Spectrum ask like well I\ndon't have any friends or I don't know\nhow to be friends we're very like often\npretty dismissive or we're like oh just\ndo the thing like of course you have\nfriends you know you hang out at you\nknow Sarah's house every day after\nschool it's like well what we missed\nthere is that our kid didn't feel like\nshe had a friend or like she even\nunderstood what it meant to be a friend\nand we just kind of take it for granted\nthat it's understandable and easy and it\nmakes sense to all brains\nso I feel did I answer your question I\nfeel like I lost yeah no I I I think um\nyou know what it's kind of reminding me\nof once again is when I when I have\npatients who are neurod Divergent you\nknow oftentimes we'll see like people\nasking for the breakdown so so when I\nwork with people who are neurod\nDivergent that kind of takeaway I've\ngotten is that they almost approach life\nlike a video game where it's like there\nare particular rules and like what is\nthe what is the equation for friendship\nand then they're like how do I make\nfriends okay I do this I do this because\nthat's how they construct their their\nsocial interactions right when someone\nright holds their hand out to me I need\nto hold out and then it's two pumps not\nthree pumps not four pumps not one pump\nit's two pumps and then we're done right\nand and so so they'll they'll sort of\nconstruct like a rubric for like how to\nsocially interact and then the the\nreally frustrating thing that I've seen\na lot is people will say you know I was\ntold that this is what I'm supposed to\ndo and I checked all the boxes and it\ndidn't work and and that's because\nthere's certain things that are\nassumed that people with advice will\ngive you that that's actually the most\ncritical stuff right it's the stuff that\nis left out you know that that everyone\nsort of takes for\ngranted um that that really is is the\nmost challenging kind of thing and and\nso you know it's really interesting to\nhear you kind of talk\nabout how you know they get the\ncorrective signals earlier I was a\nlittle bit curious about anxiety so you\nsaid at some point they start to get\nanxious can you tell us a little bit\nabout where that comes from and and how\nthat\nevolves yeah so um when we think about\nanxiety um kind of if you zoom out to\nget like an umbrella understanding of\nanxiety um what's going on is it's it's\na fear-based reaction and so there's\noften an um\noverestimation of both the probability\nand the magnitude of some kind of danger\nso um you know to kind of use an extreme\nexample like oh um a meteor the size of\nthe United States is going to hit my\nhouse right so huge meteor like very big\nmagnitude of a danger and then the\nprobability it's a guarantee right that\nmeteor is going to crash into my house\num and then an under estimation of the\ncoping abilities and if that happens\nobviously I can't cope with it because\nI'm going to die so now if you kind of\nput that into social situation um that\nwould be like oh um someone is is uh not\njust gonna kind of like tease me but\nsomeone is GNA say awful things to me\nand it is absolutely going to happen and\nthere's no way I can cope with that\nbecause I I can't tolerate like people\nnot liking me well if you put kind of\nthat process into a person who genuinely\ndoes not understand social interactions\nin the way that you know probably some\nof the or most of the people around them\nbut they're being forced to execute the\nbehaviors well they are experiencing\nmore negative you know uh feedback like\nyou said there's a rubric I um put my\nhand out you know and then I I hold it\nand then then I shake two times but some\npeople um put their hand out and they\ndon't want to shake it they want to do\nlike you know something like that and\nthen they think you're weird like what\nyou don't know how to like do a high\nfive kind of like hand thing or like\ninstead of shaking a hand I'm gonna put\nmy hand out and then hug you and it's\nlike oh I wasn't expecting that what am\nI supposed to do do I hug back how hard\nis it two hands is it one hand you know\nand so there's all of this like what's\ngoing on\nhere so you're you are actually getting\nmore negative feedback so the\nprobability is higher than a\nneurotypical person who understands\nsocial cues the magnitude probably\nescalates because at first you're just\nlike a little bit weird but then you're\nlike definitely the weird kid um and\nyour coping resources are kind of\ndiminished because you you're walking\nthrough life not really understanding\nwhat's going on anyway and so you've\njust learned you're coping is to pretend\nlike it's not happening which as we all\nknow that unfortunately doesn't work um\nand so you develop a very understandable\nprocess of like I don't know what's\nhappening something bad is coming my way\nbut I can't even predict right like I I\ncan't look at you and know if you want\nto hug me or handshake me or do like a\nyou know like really exactly slap my\nhand around\nlike\nI mean and and I feel like we all got a\nlittle dose of this like you know during\nCo and right after it was like do we\nshake hands anymore do you hug do you do\nthe like um you know some people were\ndoing like this yeah like elbow things\nor like fist bumps or like imag do you\nremember like that negative feedback\nwhere you went in to like shake a hand\nor hug someone and they like backed away\nfrom you and like oh oh I'm so sorry\nlike I didn't mean to like violate your\nboundaries but though we got little tiny\ndoses of what people on the autism\nspectrum are experiencing in big ways in\nmost areas of their lives on a pretty\nlike consistent basis um so I\nthink that and then but think too about\nhow like we're not identifying girls who\nare neurod Divergent right so maybe\nneurod Divergent girls happen to find\nanother neurod Divergent girl where it\nkind of works really well and so\neveryone's like oh you can't have autism\nbecause you have a friend you have\nfriends yes you have a friend right or\nthe number of girls that I did um autism\nevaluations with um who all of the\nadults in their life said she doesn't\nhave autism she's she's great with the\nteachers she's amazing with my friends\nparents saying that and it's like yeah\nbecause um first of all it is way easier\nto interact socially with people who are\nnot your peers that is the most thre\nthreatening kind of like challenging\narea but also how do we teach girls to\ntalk to\nadults there is a very specific rubric\nfor the\nexpectation for a child and especially a\ngirl talking with and interacting with\nadults and so it is less inherently\nthreatening and I have very strong\nscrips about the way that I'm supposed\nto behave here and then I get powerfully\nreinforced by that um and so yeah um\nmore information that my dog is really\nI'm excited about joining this\nconversation that's totally fun um all\ndogs are welcome\num um is um you know like oh well\nbecause they're good with adults they\ncan't have autism so it's something else\nand then again we just keep\ndismissing um things that really we\ncould have identified people who needed\nmore support or just different ways of\nlearning even um so yeah yeah there's\nthere's a a lot so speak speaking of\nkind of socialization anxiety can you\ntalk a little bit about social anxiety\nin women and and sort of what you\nnoticed or how it could manifest\ndifferently or you know just do that\nwhole thing that you do where you talk\nabout developmental perspectives in\nsociety and biology yeah just just go\nagain if you don't mind please thank you\nyeah yeah yeah um I think\none of the things that just it with the\npandemic I think we are not I think we\nwe are seeing like some skyrocketing\nsocial anxiety in our um young people\nand I imagine it's happening in adults\nas well but um because obviously I'm I'm\npredominantly focused on youth it's\nreally in my face and and things that\nI'm reading about but um so we kind of\ntalk through like what is anxiety and\nhow does it come about in people who are\nner Divergent and then I've been talking\na lot about autism but like 88 is super\nrelevant and basically follows the same\ntrajectory right kids who bounce around\nthe room boys are allowed to do that\nuntil we think hm they're bouncing a\nlittle extra girls who bounce around the\nroom are immediately given feedback you\ndon't do that absolutely not you need to\nsit in your chair you know you need to\nbe quiet um so you know take what I said\nabout ad autism and you can basically\ncopy and paste it for ADHD and then\nthere is an overlap between those two as\nwell so you used to say you could only\nhave one or the other and then we\nlearned like m not true you can actually\nhave both so that's fun but so um for\ndifferent reasons people with ADHD are\nnot picking up on social cues because\nthey're kind of picking up on everything\nall at once and unable to filter the\ninformation very well so they are also\nhaving kind of social difficulties um so\nyou've got this kind of like social\nanxiety piece where I have a lot of um\nunpredictable negative social\ninformation coming my way and I don't\nknow the right answers and I have like\nmy Baseline approach but it doesn't\nactually work for me every time um and\nthen you add in the um social ways of\nconnecting that we have on screens so\nthat there is a big buffer\nzone first of all you don't have to look\nat me if I don't want you to in most of\nour like favorite online platforms um my\nphysical visibility is not required and\nso I can learn how to connect with\npeople without having to think about\nwhat do I look like and there is some\nreally interesting and I'm sure we we\nall do this right we all have avatars we\nall go online we all do I mean gaming\nthings whatever even if it's like a me\non the Nintendo systems right so you can\nactually\nconstruct your experience in a way that\nyou literally cannot in the like\nphysical world so I can change my gender\nI can change my race I can change my age\num and you know I grew up when like the\ninternet was first happening and we had\nlike dial up and you know I could tell\npeople literally anything about me and\nthe fun thing is is that you don't even\nhave to stay the same you can have 10\nonline interactions and be like a\ntotally different person in each\nexperience and so it really allows you\nto be\nmore I mean free but like fluid and\nexperimental so I can kind of like test\nout ways of being um and then oh hey\nthat didn't I didn't like that and the\nnegative feedback you get online I mean\ndon't get me wrong can be very intense\nand unpleasant but also is can be\ndepending on your platform controllable\nI can block you I can just end this\nconversation and move on to the next\nroom right I can get into a different\nfer so there are ways of kind of like\nadapting to this different platform of\nsocial interaction that can sometimes\nmake\nsocializing\neasyer um and certainly less\noverwhelming because you're getting a\nlot less social feedback so like let's\njust take that fundamental eye contact\npiece and just take it off the table\nthere is no eye content um you know in\nin online platform and so all of a\nsudden let's say I'm a person who has\nsocial anxiety and now I have ways of\ninteracting with humans where maybe\nthings go better for me in some\nsituations and so I can actually connect\nwith people which now I have a huge\ndiscrepancy in my life now oh I have\nthis safe space I have these connections\nI can make and then I go out into the\nworld and it feels even more like oh so\nwhat do we do when we feel anxious about\nthings we avoid them we don't like them\nwhat does that do to our anxiety\nunfortunately\nit feeds it it grows that beast and so\nyou see this kind of like interaction\nbetween holy Cal think thank goodness I\nfound this space or these people or this\nplace where I can really connect but\nthen it almost makes other things worse\nin some ways right and I'm not saying\nlike don't connect online yeah yeah so\nhow does connecting online make social\nanxiety potentially worse so you said it\nfeeds it how how so right so um\nif I am getting my needs met or I'm\ngetting that reinforcement in a in a\nspecific way then um I can say like hey\nwhen I am this version of myself or this\npiece of myself online or even this\ntotally unmasked version of myself\nonline and I'm getting this really\npositive positive Pleasant wonderful\nreaction um than it does does kind of\nlike tyen some of the other sources of\nlike wo negativity and especially like\nit doesn't matter whether it's my full\nunfiltered version that I get to be\nreinforced by or whether it's like the\nsection of me that this online community\ngets to know then\noh so my unfiltered version is\ncompletely unacceptable to the rest of\nthe world or oh the only part of me\nthat's good\nis this part that I share with this\ncommunity right and so then you're just\nreally\num you're getting like this like\nfeedback so that like you're kind of\nthink think about like a tree right so\nlike we have this beautiful blossoming\ntree but like when the tree you know\nwho's walking around the world um\ninteracts with a certain group or a\ncertain people it's like that group is\nlike no we need to trim these branches\nyou need to stop growing those leaves we\ndon't like that color of flower flowers\nyou need yellow flowers and the tree is\nlike I don't know can I make yellow\nflowers I thought I only had purple\nflowers but as humans we can we can make\nsome of those changes but they're not\nnecessarily authentic to ourselves or\nfeeling good and so when we have these\nadditional social influences it's like\noh sometimes it's good but sometimes\nit's not and you know of course online\nwe're not going to get positive feedback\neverywhere and so it's just we're adding\nmore sour of that unpredictability of\nthat like wait I know it works sometimes\nbut like not always but like sometimes\nyes and and so we're just like the chaos\nand unpredictability like fuels the\nanxiety yeah yeah makes a lot of sense\nand is there are there particular things\nthat you've noticed about you sort of\nmentioned that you know women or or\ngirls are more expected to socialize\nconnect with each other so does social\nanxiety affect women in a different\nway oh I mean so here's an interesting\nother gender difference right\nso uh we think so yes because of the\nphysical component and that there are\nreally um clearcut uh physical Norms of\nwhat you need to look like and adhere to\nto be a proper girl to be accepted\naccepted by Society even to be called\nbeautiful right and some of those things\nare completely outside of my control um\num because of how I was you know what my\nbody was born as but like I'm going to\nsay no I have to fit into this Norm well\num because of the intense scrutiny on\ngirls and women um there is we thought\nthat that was a really big piece kind of\nmore exclusively to girls well when we\nstarted saying hey maybe not everybody\nhas all the like one siiz fits all um\nlooking at our eating disorder\npopulations which is like a bodycentric\nright um condition uh girls obviously\nused to be diagnosed that significant\nlike boys barely even had eating\ndisorders and if you were a boy with an\neating disorder wow there was something\nseriously wrong with you well turns out\nnot super true um boys also have a\nreally hard time with their ridiculous\nbody norms and standards and the need to\nfit a certain way of looking being\ndressing acting um and so\nwhile social anxiety for girls often is\nvery heavily focused on on also like oh\npeople are going to look at me and laugh\nat me people are you know\nand traditionally if you look at like\nmen or like famous men like look at the\nmale celebrities who dress in certain\nways and then like female celebrities\nlike um I think Adam Sandler is well\nknown for a lot of like celebrity photos\nof him in like some a very athletic um\noversized attire and it's more just like\noh that's Adam Sandler he's so funny\nlike she just dresses like that versus\nlike remember when Billy eyh came onto\nthe scene and it was like why is she\ndressing like a homeless person and\nshe's wearing trash bags and that's not\nokay and does she think anyone's going\nto think she's attracted and it's like\noh um you know really intense negative\nfeedback for girls and so those are just\nlike some kind of like celebrity version\nexamples of how girls are navigating the\nworld but I I not sure that we are as\ndifferent as we think on those gender\ndifferences in social anxiety um and\nthen of course boys have a lower\nexpectation in general for their social\nconnections like men which again I think\nthis is a problem men are not really\nallowed to like cry to each other\nthey're not allowed to have intimate\nconnections because you know and we have\nlike oh them that's a whole other thing\nand so like if a boy has social anxiety\nhe doesn't have the same societal\nexpectation that he has to be connecting\nwith people AKA engaging in one of his\nmore feared experiences versus girls no\nno if you're a girl who doesn't have\ngirlfriends and isn't going out for\ngirls drinks and you know has a group\nchat with all of her girlfriends then\nyou know there something wrong with you\nso do it even if it's scary or hard or\nterrifying yeah that's so interesting so\nI I I if if you're okay with it I want\nto jump to um uh so we have like a list\nof questions from the Q&A which you\nshould have gotten uh and I think some\nof these are sort of like connected so\nI'm going to jump to one of those if\nthat's okay so um\n[Music]\nyeah so how would you recommend that\nwomen or girls deal with social\nisolation and\nloneliness everyone assumes you'll have\nother girlfriends but many of us don't\nyes how do you cope without a support\nnetwork or even a toxic\none yeah yeah um first of all I just\nwant to say the questions that this\ncommunity um kind of like generated were\nphenomenal just like reading through\nthose questions I was super excited and\njust it really reflects like how engaged\nyour community is and how like creative\nand like um really like thoughtful like\npeople are interacting with the\ninformation so um shout out to all of\nyou out there um but I think this is\nsuch a hard question\nbecause um how do you cope without a\nsocial support\nsystem my understanding both socially\nand biologically is we are socially\nwired creatures like our brains are\nbuilt to need other humans other people\nof our species and so coping without a\nsocial support system\nis really [ __ ] hard and it and um it\nlike I want to say it just don't\nrecommend doing it even knowing\nsometimes it's incredibly challenging to\nbuild that social support system um and\nthen or to step away from like I've\nworked with so many young women who have\nextremely toxic social support systems\nor we'll call them social groups and\nthey're like you know we do a pros and\ncons and we're looking at like do we\nleave the friend group or do we stay\nand like heartbreakingly more often it's\nlike it's better to stay with people who\nare clearly adversely affecting my\nmental health and not treating me well\nthan it is to be isolated and alone and\nso you know that that's just like and\nagain coming in like oh is a mental\nhealth professional I'm going to say no\nthat's an unhealthy relationship it's\nabusive but if you actually look at what\na person values and priorities and needs\nare a lot of times people say like it's\nbetter than nothing and who am I to say\nlike oh you're wrong right and so um\nsummary statements of this first part is\nlike you really do need that social\nsupport and I want to just take a moment\nit's really really hard to build healthy\nsocial support systems and so kind of I\nthink with anything social where do you\nstart at like your very first baby step\nand the last time um we hung out here we\ntalked about kind of thinking about\nfriends or social groups in like\nlayers um and that you don't start at\nthe like most intimate layer so you\nstart with casual\ninteractions um shared interest\nPleasant\nconversations um and sometimes that\nneeds to be like artificially created so\nthat means like hey if you see a person\nno matter how they look saying like\nhow's the weather today or you know\ncommenting on shoes\ncan then sometimes like oh that leads to\na conversation and then a conversation\nif you're you know in a shared space you\nbump into them more often and then you\ncan you know talk more diversify the\ntopic so now it's like oh I'm learning\nmore about you um and then like\ninitiating plans is a big one that is\nlike pretty terrifying um\nand kind of the biggest step in going\nfrom oh we have casual conversations\nhere and there or I see you in class at\nwork or you know in my building but like\ncreating plans would be the next step to\nactually then building that into from an\nacquaintance into a friendship um so I\nthink taking it slowly and just being\nkind to yourself so as you're trying to\nconnect with other people we so quickly\ngo into a they don't like me because\nthere's something wrong with me they\ndon't like me because I'm dumb ugly\nflawed broken whatever the mean things\nare that we're saying to ourselves so\ninstead just kind of thinking hey that\ndidn't work out we're not the right fit\nfor each other we are not you know it\njust isn't the there are lots of people\nI really enjoy and respect as humans\nthat I don't want to spend my f time\nwith it's not a negative thing it just\nis we're not all what did I see on like\nwe're not all chicken nuggets like not\neverybody's going to love us so but then\nthere are vegetarians see not even\neverybody loves chicken\nnuggets yeah so that that's so so kind\nof what I'm hearing from you is first of\nall I I I and I complet completely agree\nby the way that I you know I I see a lot\nof people in abusive\nrelationships and\num and you know people from the outside\njust don't understand right like they\njust don't like they're like how on\nEarth can you stay with this person and\nand I think a lot of times what we lose\nsight of or what took me years to\nunderstand as a as a psychiatrist is\nthat why are you with this person\nbecause this is actually better than the\nalternative which is such a scary\nthought that like most people cannot\nfathom depending on the life that you've\nLED right that like this thing that\nseems so wrong to you is a step up from\nwhat the alternative is and we see that\nwith toxic friend groups uh especially\nin our community where we talk about you\nknow toxic support where it's sort of\nlike you have to take I mean it's almost\nlike taking your medicine where it's\nlike okay in order to fight off the\nbone crushing loneliness I have to\ntolerate this person's assholery I'm the\nperson that always texts first always\ntexts first always texts first but if I\ndon't text them they will never text me\nback and if I don't text them I won't\nsee anyone yeah so this is sort of the\nreality that that some people experience\nand I I don't know if you're familiar\nwith the concept of MMR matchmaking\nrating um no\nno it's a gaming concept so so when when\nwhen you play a when you play a video\ngame and you win a match you will gain\nsome level of points and then the next\ntime I queue up my opponent will have\nthe same level of points that I have\nokay and and the interesting thing is\nthat you know when I look at this\ncommunity I almost see like there's like\na social MMR where like people who know\nhow to socialize will end up socializing\nwith other people who know how to\nsocialize\nand then what we sort of end up with is\nlike sometimes there people who have\ndifficulty socializing and then it can\nfeel like okay all the normal people\ndon't want to hang out with me and so\nyou're sort of stuck hanging out with\nall the people who don't know how to\nsocialize yeah and and so this is\nsomething that like is really\nchallenging I see this in the most\nbizarre places so online D and D groups\nis a really good example this I'm not\nsure if you're familiar with Dungeons\nand Dragons but yeah yeah like some of\nthe most toxic situations I've seen like\nsocially or in like Dungeons and Dragons\ngroups where people have power and some\npeople don't and your DM is like [ __ ]\npower tripping and they don't like\nsomething that you're doing and you\ncan't advocate for yourself it's it's\nsuch a mess right oh yeah and sometimes\nthat's because the DM like the only\nreason they DM is because they're not\ncapable of doing that back and forth\nthat allows them to maintain\nrelationships so I think one of the\nother real challenges that we kind of\nhave to acknowledge is that like\nsometimes the reason it's hard to find\nsocial groups is because\nas a society we're atrophying our social\nskills yes and so it becomes harder and\nharder I don't think that there's\nsomething wrong with you I think there's\nsomething wrong with all of us and it is\nbecoming harder we are seeing more and\nmore objective evidence that even for\nexample like dating and and romantic\nrelationships and things like that are\nbecoming like more objectively difficult\num we are seeing an increase in\nloneliness from men and\nwomen yeah and and so and adults to kids\nit's like it's happening around the\nworld to all ages to all genders I mean\nit is yes yeah so it's it's it's it's I\nI appreciate your answer so much that\nfirst of all like you know sometimes\ntoxic relationships are kind of better\nthan the alternative and and that's\nbecause as you said we are social\ncreatures so I I think the interesting\nthing about going through med school is\nreally understanding that the mind is\nthe only organ in our body that requires\nthings outside of you in order to be\nhealthy so I can like basically take\nalmost 100% care of my cardiovascular\nhealth without anything outside of me if\nI eat right and I exercise I have 100%\ncontrol over my cardiovascular health\nnot technically 100% because there's\nmental influences on that and then\ngenetics and whatnot but generally\nspeaking I can take take care of my\nkidneys I can take care of my liver I\ncan take care of my heart the only thing\nthat I can't take care of by myself is\nmy mind unless you're a monk in which\ncase but I wouldn't recommend that wait\nbut actually so there is literature that\nsays the reason that works for some\npeople is because they are connected but\njust not to a physical human they're so\ndeeply connected to the spirituality\nthat it functions socially and so that\nlike people who live in they're not like\na monk like well I mean like a the word\nmonk right is is somebody who lives in\nisolation because they're deeply\nconnected to a spiritual practice or a\nbelief system even if it's not like a\nreligious Fai right versus a person who\nis completely isolated and living on\nlike a you know mountain top that's\nthat's a great point so it's it's\ninteresting because you know a lot a lot\nof times we view monks in a particular\nway but monks are actually quite\nsocially connected too because they live\nin monasteries with groups of other\nmonks um I I also think that a lot of\ntimes when we sort of think about monks\nas being non-materialist they have the\nluxury of being non-materialistic\nbecause they don't have to worry about\nhow they're getting a roof over their\nhead they don't have to worry about\nwhere their meals are coming from those\nthings are actually the highest security\nthat you can get in terms of living\nrentree and getting free Pro food\nprovided is actually to be a monk safely\nand consistently too yeah absolutely and\nand the the other thing it's really\ninteresting because if you look at some\nof these studies on transcendental\nspiritual experiences and which we kind\nof Al get into with psychedelics one of\nthe things that happens is our sense of\nself breaks down and our sense of\nconnectedness on a neuroscientific level\nactually\nincreases yes a and so it's so\ninteresting because when we think about\ncompassion compassion if you really look\nat some of these old texts they say that\ncompassion is not something you have to\ntry to do as a monk compassion naturally\narises when you start to realize that\nyou and someone else are one and the\nsame so I don't need compassion towards\nmy hand naturally take care of my hand\nbecause I see it as part of me so if you\nlook at some of these old texts they say\nthat as you do these practices you will\nrealize that there is a Oneness between\nall things and the realization of that\nOneness naturally results in compassion\nbecause I don't walk around slapping my\nhand right because it's part of me why\nwould I hurt it and so you start to\ntreat others as you would treat\nyourself and now we even have sort of\nthis interesting uh you know evidence\nfrom Neuroscience studies and things\nlike that on the deactivation of the\ndefault mode Network and some of these\nother parts of the brain that start to\nbreak down which is where our sense of\nindividuality comes from and when we\nbreak that down then we feel we sort of\nhave some idea of a neuroscientific\nmechanism of like feeling one with the\nuniverse so I never really thought about\nmonks as connected but that makes\nperfect\nsense um it's it is very fascinating um\nyeah so that's so cool so just if I can\nswitch gears for a second because we\nwe've got maybe about 30 minutes left\nand we have so many questions um yeah so\ndo you have any advice for handling\nunrealistic beauty standards I can't\nhelp but feel inferior because of my\nlooks and I don't know how to start\naccepting\nmyself again right like these are some\nreal big big questions um\nand I was um in grad school one of my\ncolleagues was doing research on she was\nan eating disorder specialist but she\nwas doing research on body image um and\num GNA flub the numbers but you know\nwhen a group of young adult women were\nsurveyed about how happy they were with\ntheir body something like\n97% were moderately or more dissatisfied\nwith the way that we\nlook if you think about that like are\nthere only 3% of women in the in the\ncountry that are beautiful like of\ncourse not when I think about walking\naround and looking at people right I'm\nlike oh you know like that person's\nbeautiful that person they also don't\nall look the same some of them do but\nyou know like\nyou're we are thinking about other\npeople like oh they're so beautiful this\nis also applicable like when you look at\nlike Oh I thought I was fat and then I\nlooked at pictures of myself during a\nperiod of time where I thought I was\nreally fat and then I was like oh wow I\nwasn't F at all right so if you kind of\nthink like both of those Concepts like\neither within myself when I was like oh\nnow I'm out of that phase and I'm\nlooking at it I'm like huh weird I'm not\nas judgy of myself as I was or thinking\nabout the way that we all just kind of\nlike hate ourselves clearly the facts do\nnot match with the perception right is\nthe kind of like that's what those those\nkind of pieces are showing us so um\nthere there are two ways that I think\nyou could go about working on your like\nbody image one is you can start\nexternally and you can work a lot on\ncomplimenting praising and identifying\nBeauty in a lot of people not just the\nones that are like the filtered social\nmedia influencers the celebrities the\ngorgeous people because also none of\nthose people actually look like that\nright so um how do I show more\ncompassion and praise and open up my\nperception of beauty and Body Image\nright how do I look at that outside of\nmyself and kind of bring that positivity\nchange my perception externally which\nthen often times I'm after I get good at\nthat I start to be more like aware and\naccepting and loving of my own look\nright um and then for some people it\nworks better starting with myself right\nso looking when I'm looking in the\nmirror when I'm looking at pictures um\nso there's some research in this with\nlike um they've done research on like\nmoms with daughters and um how um if you\ndeliver an intervention to moms about\nhow they talk about their bodies and\ntheir image like in pictures or in the\nmirror um or the compliments they give\nthemselves in front of their daughters\nyou affect the daughters body image and\nvisions of beauty and so you know can I\nbut you also affect the moms right so\nI'm I'm a mom I'm doing this for my\ndaughter but then I'm now believing like\num right that my body is actually like\noh you know why do your boobs look like\nthat well it's because my boobs did this\ncool thing and St you for like a year or\nhowever long right and so now all of a\nsudden what we're thinking about with\nall those negative judgment words about\nthe way that like my body has changed or\nthe way that my body looks now now I'm\nframing it in a light of like holy cow\nthat is really cool and the more I talk\nabout it the more like oh so I'm not\nthinking about it as oh it's the right\nshape and wrinkle free or this or that\nor size but I'm thinking about it from\nlike a different lens and so that can be\nanother way of kind of gifting right\nlike my I ripped and fell in a crosswalk\non a major six Blan Street yesterday\nlike I went down um tumbled had a hard\ntime getting up and so I was really\nembarrassed and then afterwards I was\nlike how cool is my body like I\nbasically bounced off the street today I\nmean don't get me wrong I have a l BR on\nmy knee but like when we start thinking\nabout our bodies Beyond like what are my\nlegs looking like what size are my jeans\nbut we try to like expand the way we're\nlooking at our bodies that's another way\nthat you can really transform don't try\nto Gaslight yourself of like oh you know\na size six isn't that big I don't have\nto be a size two like you're just buying\ninto the beauty standard that of what I\nhave to look like like right oh if I\njust color my hair a certain way or\nlearn the right contouring techniques\nwith my makeup or you know lift whatever\nweight that that actually is not going\nto be the thing that's going to get you\nto that acceptance because you're still\nstaying in that Narrow Lane of what is\ngood so how do you kind of like zoom out\nand really look at things like you know\nlike I I I can walk um I can go up and\ndownstairs I mean those are kind of like\nyeah that's some people would say that's\na low bar but like\nlook at other bodies and can they you\nknow walk long distances can they drip\nand fall on some con and just stand back\nup and keep walking um so just kind of\nlike thinking about things in a\ndifferent way to really kind of expand\nyour view of body and beauty and good\nthings yeah so so that's so interesting\nuh so if I understood you correctly you\nwere saying that when we teach mothers\ninterventions to try to support their\nbody their daughter's body image that\nthe mother's sense of body image also\nimproves was that did I understand that\ncorrect yeah okay yes that's so\ninteresting because I also I've seen\nevidence of the flip which is that when\nyou teach\nparents uh when you treat anxiety in\nparents when you have a anxiety disorder\nin a parent and an anxiety disorder in\nthe child if you medicate the parent and\nyou see clinical improvements the\nchild's anxiety will\nimprove oh yeah so so having having a\nComm which is not that surprising but\nyou know having just treating the parent\nwill by definition treat the\nchild right because we're treating a\nsystem yeah where it's not just like\nlike they don't exist you know theme of\nour conversation we don't exist alone in\nthe world so if you can how do you\nintervene on the system in a way that is\ngoing to create create P yeah so so you\nknow I I'm a little bit if it's okay\nMichaela I'm going to push back on some\nof the stuff that you said because the\nlow\nseems like you know so\nlike you know I I I'm I'm with you and I\nalso think some of this stuff is is just\nit it feels a little bit gasy to me so\nthat's what I'm kind of I love that you\nkind of talk about gaslighting yourself\nso I have a perspective on this but you\nknow just to kind of push back so you\nkind of mentioned okay like the the\nreason that my breasts look the way that\nthey do is because I I fed you and and\nwe all know that from a medical\nperspective you know feeding multiple\nbabies um and I've noticed as a is a\nhonestly is a medical doctor\nthat the second child that a woman has\noften times changes her body way more\nthan the first and and so I don't know\nif that's anecdotal or if there's data\nbehind it or it's certainly anecdotal\nbut um it's just something I've observed\nthat that you know oh yeah I was gonna\nask if if age moderates that or so\nthat's why I I I don't know so so it\ncould be the mitigating factor that you\nalways have a second child after you\nhave your first and so you're going to\nthe age is going to that could be a\nconfounding variable okay but um and\nthen something about third child fourth\nchild fifth child the body seems to\nchange less for my the patients that\nI've I've worked with um okay and so but\nyou know we sort of have these certain\nbeauty standards of of what breasts are\nconsidered attractive and then after\nyour breasts serve this function of\nliterally swelling drastically so that\nyou can produce\nstore and\nand disseminate large amounts of milk\nthat that there's going to be a\nphysiological change in the breast and\nso like yeah it's cool that I sustained\nlife like that's a good thing but my\nbreasts still look different right\nthey're not they don't look the way that\nthey they they're they're supposed to\nthey really aren't consistent with\nbeauty standards that we sort of have\naround us and so like what I kind of\nlike what what my instinctive response\nis and putting myself in the shoes of my\npatients and trying to channel what I\nimagine they would say and maybe I'm not\ndoing them Justice here is that like you\nknow they don't look as good as they\nused to like sure we can work on\nself-acceptance but sure you know I mean\ncan't I I still there's still not as\nattractive as some the way they the way\nthat I used to be 10 years ago let alone\ncomparing yourself to women who haven't\nhad children or or whatever and then\nalso it's it's kind of like you say like\nwell yeah my my body bounced off like\ngreat you're you know you're made a\nrubber there that's good but there's a\nit's a completely different bucket of\nstuff like one is like functional\nutility and one is like I'm ugly right\nand that there are other people out\nthere who are beautiful so that seems to\nme to be like a pretty big\ngap yeah so um what we're talking about\nis like\ndiversifying the the information we're\nconsidering around our body right so um\nlike we are socialized and this is\nprobably not the platform to do this on\nbut we're socialized because like of the\nmulti-trillion doll beauty industry to\nneed to look a certain way those things\nare by and large completely made up\nthings and I don't know if you've seen\nany of the like um Prime uh switches of\nlike this is what it was to be beautiful\nin this time in this time in this time\nand kind of like going like um\nso\num that that is socially constructed\nthat that's like a madeup thing and it's\nmade up because it generates a lot of\nmoney for a lot of people is so that I\ncan you know constantly have you buying\ndifferent products buying different\nclothes trying different diets etc etc\nbut that's like a that's a whole\nseparate thing right but so when we're\nthinking about it\num what we want to do is we want to I'm\nyes oh fake made up so we still live in\nthis Society right so I can't say like\noh it's all made up so who cares don't\npay attention to it this is still the\nsociety I live in just like ABA is\ndesigned to help people on the autism\nspectrum to function in the society we\nlive in because this is this is what we\nhave so I'm not trying to say like oh\nyou know forget Society I don't know how\nrealistic that is what I'm saying is the\nmore we can diversify the way that we\nlook at Sal so um the way that I look at\nmy body in the mirror and I criticize\nthe way that I look at it and some\npeople will say oh compare yourself to\nothers you know and there's like you\nknow compare yourself well I'm not as oh\nI can walk I'm not in a wheelchair so\nthat means like my body is good H that\ndoesn't really fit very well with me and\nthere is some literature that supports\nthat as being potentially helpful but I\nthink when we look at instead of my body\nand the only way of being beautiful and\nthe only way of having value right\nbecause that's what beauty is it's like\nthe value of my physical appearance or\nphysical\nfaith is in this one narrow definition\nof that so when I can\nexpand my opportunities to have value in\nmy physical being then we also start\nseeing so with any black and white\nthinking right once you diversify and\nnow there's there is black and there is\nwhite and then there's like a range of\ngray all of a sudden being that black\nand white is less important and I can\nnow see how I still fit in to some of\nthose things in ways that I wasn't able\nto perceive before because there's a\nperception piece here where it's not\njust factual that I am fat or misshapen\nor ugly right it is there's a perception\npiece that we are often the worst judges\nof for our own self and so when we can\ndiversify the value first of all now I'm\nseeing that my body has value in a lot\nof different ways but now I'm also can\npeel away some of that negative\nperception that I'm putting on myself so\nthat I have again more of that like oh\nokay so like I guess you know what M\nisn't AC that big or you know whatever\nthe pores are not that huge I guess you\nactually can't notice them versus if\nyou're so focused on how big your pores\nare and you need to get them smaller and\nyou know like there's lots of products\nyou can buy to make your pores smaller\nor cover them up or do the makeup or\nwhatever the thing but when I start\nlooking at all of the pieces like oh um\nyou know what I have a sister who is\nvery sad that she has some aging on her\nskin and she's been really talking about\nlike yeah I have aging on my skin\nbecause I have so much fun outside and I\nget to do all these cool activities on\nthe beach and at the pool and you know\nin the mountain that I wouldn't\notherwise have had and so now I'm again\nadding value and looking at these pieces\nin a different way does she still\nsometimes look in the mirror and be like\noh I have wrinkles I should get boto\nsure and it the impact to her emotional\nwell-being is absolutely uh like\nmitigated or like her sense of physical\nBeauty and self is way better because\nshe's been able to incorporate some of\nthese pieces okay that make sense yeah\nno I I love the way that you sort of\nsaid that so ultimately if we think\nabout beauty beauty is a is one source\nof\nvalue yes right and so so then if we\nreally look at what's the root that\nwe're talking about it's about value and\nwhat is the value of my body and and\nbeauty is just one slice of it and\nthat's something that I think that a lot\nof people can intellectually understand\nis that you know like I'm good for any\nnumber of things one of them is being\nbeautiful and another is is that I can\nmy body can bring me pleasure I can\nbring me joy I you know I can do fun\nthings with it um and and so that that's\nreally interesting so it's not even\nnecessarily challenging the perception\ndirectly but the the first step is to\nexpand the scope and then then and I'm\nI'm with you 100% about you know the the\nvalue of creating a non- black and white\nsystem so the problem is also like from\nblack and white systems like there's no\nway to\nprogress right because it's binary so\nlike either you're beautiful or you're\nnot so if you sort of think about okay\nif we assume a system where there are\nugly people and Beautiful People what\ndoes the ugly person do nothing there's\nnothing to do because there's no sense\nof incremental change because you're not\nbeautiful and that is a fixed\nobject the moment that you start to add\nShades of Gray now I can like move in\nthe right direction right I can do\nsomething a little bit for my appearance\nI can get my hair cut I can start using\ndeodorant I can start showering I can do\nwhatever likes small things that will\nmove me in the right direction and and I\nreally love how you you kind of sort of\ntalked about just understanding that\nyour value and I think that's the big\nproblem that's kind of how I approach it\nas a clinician is is sort of really\ntackling this idea of like the value of\nbeauty and what I try to help my\npatients do is understand that you may\nnot be beautiful okay you know so what\nyeah yeah and and then that's where we\nget to a lot of really interesting like\ncognitive\nconstructions about beauty um and then\nonce we get to that point I I think it's\nyou also pointed out this is something\nthat I think is very very under almost\nunderdeveloped in in the field of like\nPsychiatry is like focusing on cleaning\nperception um so in the yogic system I\nmean perception is actually viewed as\ncritically important and then if you\nlook at kind of what's going on\nespecially with social media and stuff I\nthink a lot of these are problems of\nperception where where you know you I'll\nask people like when they have a\nparticular belief like it's impossible\nto do XYZ I where do you get that\ninformation it's usually one or two\nlived experiences or a small amount of\nlived experiences followed by a mental\nconstruction from social media so you\nfall into this group and there's\nresearch on like online radicalization\nor online\nwhich is just you know once you sort of\nview yourself as an ugly then the kind\nof content you absorb will make that\nbelief more radical over time and also\nfar more concrete because now everyone\nout there also has this experience and\nwho is everyone it's what the the\nalgorithm feeds you\nright and then there's other inherent\nproblems like what the algorithm benef\nbenefits from which is which is to a\ncertain degree creating insecurity and\nand ping ponging your\nemotions and so the the more I think\npeople figured out a while ago that if\nyou make someone laugh they'll move to a\ndifferent platform soon enough but if\nyou can make someone\nangry yeah if you can make someone feel\ninsecure that actually causes them to\nengage in content more and more and more\nyes\nyeah um so I think we have time for\nmaybe one more and I'd love to ask you\nthis question so this is kind of my\nfavorite question what is currently a\nwoman's mental health topic that we are\nnot aware of Slash not talking about\nenough is there something you observe\nthat we should know\nabout um I had such a laugh when I read\nthis question because I was like Oh and\nit how ironic for it to come on the\nheels of what you just said about the\nalgorithm and the content we speak right\nour community is awesome they're like\namazing\nI I'm not sure what other people don't\nknow because my feeds and the things\nthat I'm reading and that I'm hearing\nabout are all constructed on my\nApproach life which then reinforce and\nkeep going so like I've been reading\nstuff about cognitive and mental load\nfor months I thought everybody was\ntalking about it turns out not right and\nso um I think I think we've already\ncovered kind of like mental load um\nanother thing that I've been seeing is\nthat like when when women entered the\nworkplace and so you you you also kind\nof alluded to like the Dual income so we\nshifted economic contributions to the\nhousehold without ever Shifting the\nsocial contributions like women are\nstill expected to clean and cook and\ngrocery shop and care for the kids and\nmen are expected to get the money but\nnow we have women who are also getting\nthe money and in some relationships are\nearning more money so like there's\nthere's like that kind of like wait now\nwe need to redistribute you know it's\nit's a full system with you know\nmovement across um but I think one of\nthe things that we haven't covered oh\nand it flipped out of my mind oh a thing\nthat we haven't covered um that I think\nis I'm seeing a lot on on my platforms\nis um like the things we think about as\nwe na navigate the world so like\nparticularly um like we don't like a\nyear ago my boyfriend and I were walking\nour dog at night and he wanted to cut\nthrough an alley so dark\nalley I would literally never even with\na dog walk I have a really big dog um\nwalk down an alley at night like that is\njust a thing that would never happen and\nit he was like why why would we not go\ndown this alley and so I think that's\nanother thing that we're like looking at\nis is that there are that women are now\nkind of like talking about the fact that\nthere are a lot of places so just like\nthe social roles and the the masking\nthat neurod Divergent women has to do is\nlike if it seems like we're starting to\nkind of open up about these hidden\nexperiences and by hid and I just mean\nthat like we as women have accepted them\nas this is just what you do versus men\nnever even most men never even knowing\nthat this these are the things that you\nneed to that women are thinking about on\na regular basis and so whether that's\nyou know dark alleys or um jogging with\ntwo headphones in um I would never do\nthat you know so like there are some\nsafety pieces um but there are also just\nlike um we were talking about rapping\npresents I don't fit into the\ntraditional female version of this\nbecause now I either don't wrap presents\nand just hand them to people um or I\nlike duct tape and like newspaper um but\nthat there is a lot of the like the ways\nwe then judge women for not conforming\nto some of those standards and that it\nis so built into our thought processes\nthat we don't that other people are not\nthinking about like oh I just judge the\n[ __ ] out of you for doing that um\nbreastfeeding right if you breastfeed\nyour boobs look real unattractive after\nyou do that turns out if you don't\nbreastfeed you are shamed to hell and\nback because you are not doing your job\nas a woman feeding your child oh and by\nthe way formula is really really\nexpensive not because it's like hard to\nmanufacture but because we can\nfinancially punish women for not feeding\ntheir children which is a free thing\nthat you should be doing and so I think\nthat there are some of these pieces that\nit's like we've been doing them without\nthinking about like I wonder if that was\na good choice or if we need to keep\ndoing it this way and that I think which\nthen opens up the conversation for other\ngroups so now men can say yeah but I'm\nnot allowed to cry I don't I don't get\nto have feelings I live an anger I'm\nallowed to be angry and so now we're\nlooking at and really uncovering the uh\nphysical insecurities that men have but\nalso the like uh emotional isolation\nthat men experience and so like we've\nbeen focusing today obviously on women's\nmental health and there are so many\nthings that are super relevant for women\nbut I think that like the term feminist\nis something that sounds like oh now\ngirls are the best instead of boys being\nthe best but the intention of the word\nwas to say hey let's look at this and\nzoom out of like gender and saying that\none is better than the other that like\nwe can kind of all exist and all do\ndifferent things and all be empowered\nseparately um so I just think that part\nof is super cool that we are really kind\nof deconstructing and looking into some\nof these things and that doesn't mean\nthat as a girl you can't be dainty or\nprefer ballet or be a stay-at-home mom\nthere there are value in all of these\nboth traditional female things but also\nin the nontraditional things um so those\nare things that I think that I'm seeing\na lot of my platforms so I don't know if\nother people are talking about them or\nthinking about them because I thinking\nabout them a lot that that's that's such\na such a\nmental health professional response\nright yeah it's like acknowledging your\nown perceptual like you know I I don't\nknow if what's being talked about and\nit's it's so interesting I think one of\nthe things that kind of shocked me is\nthat you know I had sort of I was\nvaguely aware that women face a lot of\ndiscrimination the thing that shocked me\nthe most um as a mental health\nprofessional is how much that\ndiscrimination comes from other women\nand oh yes and you know I think you\nmentioned like the breastfeeding thing\nis just like one example but like the\nthe thing that that shocked me so much\nbecause of how uniform it is is in the\nfield of Finance women are not allowed\nto have babies until they're like 35 and\nand what happens is it's interesting\nbecause like if a dude so first of all\nit's not their male superiors who are\ntelling them this CU like they get sued\nto Kingdom Come and and so so but what\nit is is it's it's like the female\nmanaging directors who were like [ __ ]\nyou I had to wait until I was 38 39 IVF\nand you're not I had to sacrifice my\n20s and then I had to like put in the\nhours and even my 30s and then this was\nwhen I was allowed to have children this\nis the sacrifice I made the sacrifice\nthis is our industry this is what you\nneed to do\ntoo and just just the uniformity of that\nexperience was shocking talking to me oh\nyeah yeah and when I when I just started\nmy career one of my colleagues um we had\nfinished our training and she got\npregnant and at lunch when the rest of\nthe kind of Department found out\nliterally like two people away so not\neven behind backs or anything these two\nwomen are talking about how my colleague\nis an absolute idiot for getting\npregnant what is she thinking he has no\nright to be pregnant this early in her\ncareer and she is going to ruin the work\nthat she's doing for doing that and it\nmakes us all look bad kind of a thing\nlike so it's not even like Finance you\nknow like oh math so obviously men men\ndo that more like no you're you're\ncompletely spot on these like biases and\nthese experiences we we all do them\nwhether we identify as women or or or\nnot like doing them to each other um in\nin big ouchy\nway yeah I I think it so that was really\nsurprising to me because I think there's\na fair amount of\nlike discrimination that is gender-based\nbut I I was surprised by how like a\nspecific flavor of discrimination tends\nto come from the opposite gender or your\nown gender um just in gender Dynamics\nand I was just stunned when when I was\nyou know talking to my patients about\nthis stuff um we do have a a a couple\nminutes so I I have one kind of last\nquestion because now we're talking a\nlittle bit about so do you have time for\none more question yeah okay sure and\nthere's a whole host of stuff that we\nhaven't gotten to like gender identity\nand sexuality and stuff so we're going\nto have to do that later but um how do I\nstop\nfearing platonic friends and family\nrelationships with\nmen yeah\num also yet another like great question\num and so uh fear is typically treated\nwith exposure right when you're afraid\nof something you do the thing and then\nyou learn um in the context of what we\nwere just talking about some most many\nwomen have experienced genuinely\nnegative experiences with men and so you\nknow um I get this question a lot of\ntimes from women who have had\nspecifically very negative experiences\nwhether like emotionally abusive\nrelationships or have experienced some\nform of sexual assault and um it is\nactually not safe to just say just go be\nfriends with men again um so really um\nwhat we want to think about when you're\ntrying to kind of get back either get\nback into or get into any kind of\nplatonic relationships with male people\nin your environment is to actually start\nfor yourself by identifying what are\nyour what we call them safety cues but\nlike what are your green flags basically\nto like use kind of current terminology\nso how do you know that a man is is safe\nor that you want to be around them what\nare the the green flags that are assign\nthat you want to be looking for and then\nwhat are the red right so what are those\ndanger cues what are the things and\nsometimes those come from outside of us\nbut also sometimes they come from inside\nof us and we are sometimes so socialized\nto gaset ourselves right um get over it\nhe's just trying to talk to you he's\njust a friend whatever whatever but if\nyou are feeling like um I'm not sure\nabout this you don't need to be able to\npoint to like a oh this is the reason\nyou can just trust yourself if that is\nan effective red flag cue for you so and\neverybody has different ones right so I\ncan't some people don't have a very good\nidentifier of like safe versus not in\nthe way they feel because they're just\nkind of globally like men you so maybe\nthat's not one of your red flags but\njust really trying to break down and I'm\nnot saying like oh somebody who has a\ngood degree it's not like that right\nit's finding what a the man who looks me\nin my eyes when I'm wearing a low cut\nshirt might be a safety CU a green flag\nright or it might just be um a guy who\nlikes the you know silly like Candy\nCrush game that I play so just like\nfinding your green flags finding your\nred flags and being just because someone\nhas a green flag or a red flag in the\nbeginning doesn't mean that there are\nnot other flags as well so just always\nassessing that um to ground yourself in\nthe oh this is an actually okay\nrelationship versus a there might be a\ndanger here that's so helpful thank you\nbecause I think those are these are some\nof the very like concrete things that\npeople don't know I I think um we're\nactually going to do something which\nyou're welcome I think it's a great\nsegue uh so sometimes you know in our\ncommunity people are like we can talk\ntalk about things abstractly but then\npeople are like how do I actually like\ndo this thing one of the things that I'm\nsuper proud of in in this community is\nthat we focus a lot about\nhow um and and so I I want to we I think\nwe're at I know we talked about two\nhours so I want to sort of respect that\nlimit I just also wanted to share with\nyou so we can sort of close out if you\nwant to hang around you're absolutely\nmore than welcome to um there's one\nparticular post that we're going to\naddress because there's a little bit of\nuh I don't know if drama is the right\nword there's there's some contentious so\nsometimes what happens in our community\nis we're a place where Echo Chambers\nCollide and I think this is actually\nreally healthy um because people are\ncoming from these places where safe\nspaces or call them whatever you want to\nthat can sometimes be incredibly toxic\num but places where you know some kind\nof some people congregate with a\nparticular set of views and then they\nreinforce that particular perspective\nand I think yeah for whatever reason\nwe've become a place where we have a lot\nof women entering our community but we\nalso have a lot of incels and then when\nthese two groups meet there can be some\nkind of tension or Clash which I think\nour moderators have done an awesome\nawesome awesome job of navigating\nthrough and really thinking about like\nthis is a place like it's not a place to\nvent um this is a place to focus on\ngrowth and so you know sharing your\nexperience is a part of that but it's\nnot like a place for you come and like\nvomit everything like they're venting\nspaces on the internet that's totally\nfine that's not actually what our goal\nis yeah um so we're going to address\nactually a post about someone who who\nsaid like you know I have this I hate\nall men but they sort of talk about\nthey're not saying all men are bad in\nfact quite the opposite they say I I had\na a group of traumatic experiences\ngrowing up and I recognize that this\nthinking is wrong but I don't know what\nto do about it so this this post was\nquite\num divisive\nand so we were going to try to address\nit directly you're welcome to stick\naround if you want to but I also don't\nwant to keep you um okay yeah I I can\nhang out for a little bit and then um I\njust want to say like I love that this\nis a place where you say Echo Chambers\nCollide because that means that this is\nvery specifically combating the negative\ninfluences of that algorithm it is a\nproblem to be existing in rabbit holes\nand so how do we get more opportun to\nconnect with people where we get our\nviews challenged and time learning grow\nso I'm I'm definitely here for it okay\nso I'm gonna so let's go ahead and okay\nlet let then let's talk about it um let\nme go ahead and switch a couple of\nthings so let me just make\nsure\num so I just got to check one or two\nthings uh yeah so let me do this I'm\ngoing to move over\nto a couple of things so just bear with\nme you're going to be off camera okay um\njust cuz I'm going to show I'm going to\nshare a\npost okay um\nso and then\nuh this is\nwhere so you'll also get to see I in in\nyou know live in\naction\num how the kinds of things that we\nstruggle with and and what we sort of\nshoot for so so what I'll do is I'll go\nahead and try to screen share with you\nMichaela so you can see what everyone on\nthe stream can see\num and then everyone can hear you so\nthey they won't be able to see you but\nyou will be able to okay uh you know\nthey can hear what you're saying so\nyou're welcome to chime in okay can you\nsee this this\npost yeah okay so I'm going to go ahead\nand switch to this and now we should be\ngood okay so so people should be able to\nhear you too so we had a post a couple\ndays\nago um that says I hate almost all men\nso this post may upset some but I ask\nyou to actually read it first this post\nis entirely about my feelings which I do\nnot believe are fact and are instead\nbased in my life experiences for better\nor worse I recognize they are logically\nflawed thoughts and not legitimate this\nis an account of my internal thoughts\nI'm a woman and I hate men I'm 23 years\nold recently graduated with a computer\nscience degree and worked in software\nengineering at the same company for the\npast 2.5 years while completing\nUniversity I work entirely with men I am\nboth the only woman in the room and the\nyoungest in a professional environment\nthis doesn't bother me and I have no\nproblem with working with having daily\ninteractions or being polite to men I\ntake it as a badge of honor to be in the\nboys club is men are often visibly\nsurprised by My Success I'm somewhat\npretty with big boobs so of course a\nbimbo men face no threat from me and you\nwould never know anything about it from\nmeeting me they G they give me far more\ntrouble than I give them I've had men\nopenly ignore me in group projects\npretend I'm not speaking refuse to ask\nme about code I designed and work at and\nwrote at work and instead ask my boss\ninsinuate I'm [ __ ] my boss say My\nSuccess is because of my looks or being\ndiversity higher among other\nthings but I strongly dislike and and am\nextremely suspicious of men any man I\nmeet I feel I know he must have dark and\ndisgusting Secrets behind a polite\nfacade I believe every man has deeply\nhurt women one way or another whether\nthis is denying rape sexually\nhumiliating girls in their class when\nthey were kids sharing nudes domestic\nviolence or just being openly\nmisogynistic it is all the same to me\nthey have all contributed to this\nmassive issue of misogyny and the\npervasive trauma all women seem to\nendure at the hands of men I often\nbelieve men are very sick individuals I\nwas hurt throughout my entire life by\nmen and see this is the root of my issue\nmy step father abused me emotionally\nmost often by sexually humiliating and\nmocking me he ostracized me from my\nfamily though we lived together my\nsiblings his children my half siblings\nhaven't spoken to me in 10 years they\nwould walk by without hello my mother is\na sweet woman and I love her to death\nbut spineless and unable to stand up for\nher herself or me I was repeatedly told\nI was stupid a [ __ ] a troublemaker a\nproblem and a loser he accused me of\nbeing a prostitute at 10 I was just a\ndepressed kid my biological father died\nin accident when I when I was 11 which\nmade me spiral into depression he was a\nnice dude as far as I recall but still a\na man with men's\nfaults I spent most of my time alone in\nmy room scared of the sounds of the\nhouse I was sexually abused by men\nonline from 11 onward due to my\nemotional issues and lack of attention\nat home my grandfather groped me from 8\nto 12 I was raped at 15 and rumors\nspread around the school I had falsely\naccused someone of rape after confiding\nin a friend and causing me to lose all\nmy friendship sh and be openly hated at\nschool this gave other boys permission\nto sexually harass me even escalating\ntheir groping me and telling people it\nwas worth it my rapist was celebrated\nanother girl accused him as well before\nme but she was also told she was a liar\nhe was popular we were weird later on\nboy boys shared my underage nude images\nbetween each other my first boyfriend\nconstantly harassed me about nudes and\nsex my second boyfriend coerced me into\nsex multiple times I could go on and on\nabout the things that men have done to\nme but I think i' I've got the picture\nacross uh oh wow this goes on for a\nwhile okay even writing this I'm\nanticipating a response akin to well\nmaybe you shouldn't have acted like such\na [ __ ] or none of this would have\nhappened take some accountability pick\nbetter this is what I expect from men\nwhen men respond like this I believe\nthey feel defensive about their own\nactions and subconsciously guilty so\nthey lash out they see a woman say that\nactions similar to ones they took are\nevil and affected her and needs to\ndistance themselves immediately one part\nof me recognizes my hypocrisy I hate men\nfor hating women non-discriminant but I\nhate men non-discriminant another half\nof me tells me that my thoughts and\nfeelings are a valid worldview and it is\nconstantly reinforced through day today\ninteractions and through my entire life\nstories from friends and much else I\ncannot seem to decide if my worldview is\na valid response to misogyny or a simple\nfear response due to trauma I cannot\ndecide if I feel bad about it or not I\ncannot decide if I have a phobia or or\nam a simple bigot maybe both things can\nbe true and the world is misogynistic\nbut my reaction to it is irrational I've\ngone to therapy and resolved my\ndepression but didn't bother to tackle\nthis worldview I felt there was no point\nmen will do these things to me again and\nI will be right back in the place in the\nsame place again I really do not know\nhow to resolve these feelings but I\nwould like to stop being prej judgmental\nto men it is also knowing to be\nconstantly fearful and suspicious\neven when I know a man well I'm waiting\nfor him to reveal himself I know some\nmen can be good as I grant an exception\nto my boyfriend of seven years I've had\nmale friendships in the past that were\nsomewhat positive even though they uh\nusually turn negative I also recognized\nwomen can be bad as well and have seen\nfemale abusers in action just at a far\nlesser rate I take male Tales of abuse\nwith healthy healthy doses of Suspicion\nmy stepfather claimed my mother and I\nhad made his life miserable abused him\nand made him a prisoner his own home\nthis colors my reasoning I don't\nparticularly see my lines of reasoning\nas different to that of an incel and\nrecognize that likely had they likely\nhad opposite experiences to me which led\nthem to hate women it is somewhat\nbothersome as all interests are\ntraditionally all my interests are\ntraditionally male Computers video games\nscience Science Fiction and Fantasy and\nmy female friends are not interested how\ncan I get over\nthis um\nokay\nwe then they talk about the edits but so\nso uh Michael you're welcome to chime in\nif if you want to but otherwise I'm\ngoing to try to address this yeah go for\nit okay yeah so like there are a couple\nthings so so first of all like I'm I'm\nglad and I one of the things that I'm\nsure you all can see is that this this\npost got a lot of upvotes and and I\nthink that there have been a lot of like\ndivisive reactions to this um\nso some people can look at this and they\ncan they can see this as it's okay to\nsay I hate men but it's not okay to say\nI hate women and and we're going to get\nto that in a second but so my first\nresponse to this is like this is\nactually like what this community is for\nbecause this person is saying that I\nhave a\nperception I there's a big difference\nbetween saying all men are\nevil and saying I perceive there is some\npart of me that perceives men is evil\nand I acknowledge\nthat this is possibly irrational I even\nsuspect that it's irrational and I'm\ntrying to change it so this is a huge\ndifference about what why our community\nis different from other corners of the\ninternet because our goals here are not\nto say all women are bad or all men are\nbad or anything like that or good or bad\nor whatever it's not to make\ngeneralizations about people the purpose\nof this community is to be a place where\nif there is a part of yourself that you\nwant to change we here to help you\nchange it that's what we're about so\nthere are a couple of other things about\nwhy this post I imagine didn't get taken\ndown right and I actually don't make the\nrules on the subreddit there are mods\nwho are far wiser and more skilled at\nthis than I am and so these are their\nrules which I'm I'm on board with by the\nway so the first is that we don't make\nGeneral statements of fact we share our\nexperiences the second is what is the\npoint of this this post this is not a a\npost where someone is venting or even\nsaying that all men are evil this is a\npost of someone saying hey I've had a\ntraumatic background I do not think my\nway of thinking is right I think\nactually I'm like the female version of\nan incel in some ways and I want to stop\nthinking this way I don't believe that\nthis is actually true there's some part\nof me that believes this is not true but\nmy mind has these kinds of thoughts how\ndo I change so this is why this post\nstayed up now the second thing is people\nmay say and this is where we have to be\nsuper careful\nso when you read a post like this you\nhave to be careful about your own\nreaction because the first thing to\nunderstand is we are all biased by our\nperceptions all biased by our\nexperiences this is a post about when I\nsee a man even if they pretend to be\nnice I do not believe they are nice my\nmind is\npopulating my mind is populated with\nthoughts of this person is faking it\nthis person is going to be bad this\nperson is going to be evil every post\nyou see on the internet your mind is\ndoing the same thing your mind is going\nto automatically populate with thoughts\nand I imagine the people who had an\nissue with this post are populating with\nthese kinds of thoughts this is unfair\nthis is biased against men oh I can't\nmake a similar post against women you\nautomatically have this\nreaction but this is why this post is up\nit's not that it's men or women or\nanything like that it's that this person\nis saying my mind has this pattern I'm\ntalking about my experience and I would\nlike to change that's why it stays up\nnow you can say you can make a post\nabout I dislike cats and I want to learn\nto love cats and the same applies the\nthe question is what is your what is the\npurpose of the post what is this person\ntrying to do and the challenge is that\nwhen we read something like this this\ncan trigger all kinds of responses\nwithin us and then we can get to\ncensorship and bias and all this kind of\nstuff but that's something that you're\nbringing to the table right you already\npreconceive of those ideas is when you\nread this post this is your emotional\nreaction to it I'm not saying that there\nisn't something correct in what you're\nsaying I'm just pointing out that\nanytime we read something that is\ntriggering the most important thing to\ndo is to take a step back and notice our\nown perception what am I adding how am I\ninferring what what am I extrapolating\nfrom a post like\nthis and if you do this you will be able\nto utilize the internet in a far better\nway because the whole problem is that\nanytime we have a cognitive bias and we\nare more likely to have a cognitive bias\nwhen we are emotionally active and we've\nbeen traumatized this is not a bug this\nis a\nfeature so as I get traumatized by\nsomething my mind become learns that I\ncan't take a\nrisk right so if like if I get bit by a\nsnake every rope that I see my mind's\ninitial reaction will be is that a snake\nthat could be a snake let's treat it\nlike a snake until it is proved\notherwise and so as we navigate through\nthe internet I see this all the time and\nif y'all have seen like these kinds of\nposts about like I'm going to use like\nsort of a a silly example but you know\nI'll see these posts about oh this hero\nis op or this Champion is op or this\ncharacter is op in a video game and this\nperson sort of makes this post and\nthey're like this person is completely\nridiculous and then people will comment\nright they'll say like it's actually not\nthat bad you just have to know how to\ncounter it whatever and then the person\nargues with them argues with them argues\nwith them the cherry on top of the\nperson will say how do I beat this\ncharacter right they'll ask this\nquestion but anytime someone gives them\nan answer they'll shoot it down that\ndoesn't work that doesn't work that\ndoesn't work that doesn't work I don't\nknow if you all have seen these posts\nbut they're like you know every one of\nthe Ops everyone who answers the\noriginal poster gets upvoted and the\nop's comments all get downvoted because\nthe person is not actually there to\nlearn so we have to be careful because\nwhen we use the internet a lot of what\nwe see comes from our perception it\ncomes from the way that we fill in the\ngaps\nso this is something where like I don't\nthink that this post is bad right and I\nI think that like there are parts of it\nthat can be hurtful to other people but\nI think this person's heart is in the\nright place they're here to try to\nchange their view right and like for all\nthe dudes out there who are like oh [ __ ]\nwomen judge me so harshly they don't\ngive me a chance yeah this is the one\nwoman out there who is trying to change\nthat right this is this is an ally to\nall of The Men Who feel prematurely\njudged by women because here's a woman\nI'm presuming it's a woman we actually\ndon't I think yeah she says she's a\nwoman there's a woman who's saying hey I\nhave a bias how do I go about changing\nit and we want to [ __ ] downvote her\nlike this is the this is what everyone's\ncomplaining about right here is a woman\nwho says I believe this particular thing\nI want to\nchange and on the flip side everyone's\ncomplaining about oh like people don't\ngive me a chance right this is this is\nperson is trying so there are a couple\nof other things things that I encourage\nyou all to do the first is that anytime\nyou read something on our subreddit the\nstronger your initial reaction the more\nyou need to slow it down right so like\nthere are probably I post on our\nsubreddit rarely but I would say that 80\nto 90% of what I write on the subreddit\nI do not actually post so I go through\nthis thing where I have an emotional\nreaction I start typing I pause and then\nI just delete it I delete the comment\nand I'm like this is not I'm not in the\nright head space so there's 80 to 90%\nghost comments that Dr K almost posted\nwhich I I don't okay so y'all should\nslow it down a little bit the second\nthing to consider is that we want to try\nto approach people in this subreddit\nwith as much compassion as we can\nmuster so try to understand that this\nperson has been through a a situation\nwhere like holy [ __ ] right they've been\nlike traumatized through and through and\nthrough like stepdad problems sounds\nlike their step siblings were not\ngood sexual abuse\nrape being groped by family members no\nless right and if we like I mean this is\nnot rocket science here I'm I'm sure Dr\nthers will agree with what I'm about to\nsay but this is what happens right so\nwhen we look at the the\nhealthy development of a relationship\nwith a gender it doesn't matter whether\nit's same gender opposite gender whether\nyou're gay straight I don't care when\nthere are people in your life that you\nare supposed to be able to trust and you\ncannot trust them this is what's going\nto\nhappen so if I'm a boy or girl doesn't\nmatter whether I if all the men in my\nlife the people who I'm supposed to\ntrust my dad my stepdad my siblings my\ngrandfather my boss my boyfriends my\nfriends when all of these\npeople have let me down betrayed me\ntaken advantage of me in some way it's\ngoing to be very hard to try to trust\nthese people right this this is going to\nhappen to anyone in this situation\num and so try to temper the like as much\ncompassion as you can muster is what you\nshould muster secondly like notice your\nown perception what triggers you about\nthis where does that hurt come from\nbecause as long as you are operating\nfrom a place of hurt is very difficult\nto leverage some degree of compassion\nright so like when y all respond to this\nin a negative way instead of vomiting on\nthe internet right which is normally\nwhat happens and youall know what I'm\ntalking about where someone posts\nsomething and some some [ __ ] out\nthere just starts vomiting negativity\nvomit negativity vomit negativity vomit\nnegativity that doesn't make that a\nproductive\nplace so and I'm not saying that you\ndon't deserve to vomit on some level\nbecause you've been traumatized too so\nthe reason that we're even bringing this\nup is because we should have compassion\nfor the people who approach this with\ntoxicity right we should have compassion\nfor everybody that's why we're trying to\ndo this so we're trying to help everyone\nhere by first of all take a step back\ntake a deep breath understand what your\nreaction is why is my reaction to this\nso strong and what you're going to say\nis like there're going to be people\nbecause I I know part of the reason I\nknow is because I used to be one so I\nstill have the thoughts that there's a\ndouble standard you can make a post\nabout I hate almost all men but you\ncannot make a post about I hate almost\nall\nwomen and even if that is true to some\ndegree which I think that that is to a\ncertain degree true there's some\nevidence of that that is irrelevant\nbecause that's not what we're about here\nif you want to go fight a a war to make\nthe internet an equal place in terms of\nhatred like go fight it somewhere else\nwe're a place where we want to help\nindividuals grow it's not about the\nrightness or the wrongness of it it's\nabout like what are we here to\ndo and so as best as you can notice your\nown reaction and the source of your own\nhurt this will help you way more than\nvomiting whatever negativity you have\nout there and we're not saying that\nyou're to be blamed for the negative\nbecause that's there for reason too you\nbelieve that way because you were\ntraumatized and so temper a little bit\ntry to get a little bit of compassion\nthen imagine when you go on your rent\nright on the internet how would you like\npeople to respond to you you want people\nto delete your post no of course not\nright you want you want people to be\nlike responsive and caring and listen to\nwhat you have to say so you should be\ntry to be that for someone else even if\nthey find you even if you're triggered\nby it and if you're triggered by it and\nyou can't respond then just stay quiet\nright it's okay you don't have to\nrespond and there's like another layer\nto this which we're not going to get\ninto which is you know what should this\nperson actually do like my tldr is like\nthey already kind of figured it out I've\nI've gone to therapy to resolve my\ndepression but didn't bother to tackle\nthis world people well that's\nnext right so in cases of of\noverwhelming trauma traumatic upbringing\nI think therapy is the right answer\nthere are other layers to this to kind\nof understand which if you guys want we\ncan explore this from a more theoretical\nstandpoint even like a yoga standpoint\nwhat happens to the mind how does this\nkind of construction happen how can we\nunderstand this there's also some like\nkind of very practical advice so like\nsometimes what I'll do with my patients\nwhen they're in situations like this is\nthat I I'll point out to them that you\nknow there there are safe this kind of\nleans into what what Michaela was\ntalking about about like there are ways\nto approach relationships in a safer way\nso simple example of this is that if you\nhave friends who are women that\ntrust like trust completely or trust to\na high degree who have male friends or\nhusbands or boyfriends or whatever you\ncan have some limited interaction with\nthem in a safe environment while your\nfemale friend is\nthere now this too you have to be a\nlittle bit careful because just because\nyour Fe you trust your female friend and\nthey trust their husband doesn't mean\nthat the husband won't try to get laid\nwith you it's absolutely possible right\nand there's some people some predators\nwho even function that way so you have\nto be a little bit careful but generally\nspeaking this is the kind of thing where\nyou know very practically when we're\ntalking about like exposure therapy like\nthere are ways to expose yourself\nwithout putting yourself in danger so\nyall can go you know this is just what\npatients have found helpful in the past\nwhich is they'll sort of tell me what\nended up working is I started hang out\nwith my friend and they had their\nbrother there and their brother was like\na nice guy and was trustworthy and I was\nalways with my friend so I felt safe so\npractical ways to do this but that's\nsomething that you all have to sort of\nsort\nout anyway we wanted to just kind of\ntalk about this like I I think that this\nis you know it's challenging for us to\nbe oh whoops it's challenging to be in\nthis community for I mean this because\nthis is what happens right we have a\nplace where we let people who have been\ntraumatized come and share their story\nbecause they want to grow and that's\nwhat we want to be here\nfor um and I I don't I don't blame the\npeople who get upset by this I don't\nblame y'all for seeing this as\npotentially biased or whatever but\nreally pay attention to this right like\num right so like the second sentence is\nthis post is about my feelings which I\ndo not believe are fact so the other big\ndifference between this post and so many\nof the other posts you'll have a lot of\nposts women are [ __ ] men are all\n[ __ ] men are\nuntrustworthy right women are\nuntrustworthy these are statements of\nfact there are people out there on the\ninternet who believe all this is fact\nyour traumatized perception is a\nsubstitute for fact and then what\nhappens is because of the way that the\ninternet since as people say things like\nthis and they get banned from all of the\nneutral places on the internet the only\nplace they're allowed to go is the\nplaces that everyone else has been\nbanned and so now we have [ __ ]\nforchan right this is how we get forchan\nand so this is why it's a talk success\npool because we take all the band people\nand where else do they go they only have\none place to go with each other and then\nthis kind of stuff intensifies and then\nwe are the one sad place on the internet\nwhere all of these people are coming\nback\nto and I'm happy about that because I\nthink that that's what we need we need\nto like give these people a place to\nreturn to on the internet without\nostracizing them and at the same time\njust because you are from one of those\nplaces does not mean that you get to\nengage in those toxic\nbehaviors while you're here because this\nis a shared\nspace and so this is like very important\nto\nunderstand okay last thing and then rant\nis going to end and then Dr thers can\nweigh in if she wants to so this very\nimportant to understand about yeah Dr k\ni I do have to step off quickly so thank\nyou so much that was brilliant I'm so\nhappy I got to um hear that explanation\nand review um yes okay take care thank\nyou very much for coming thank you have\na great day okay bye so this is the last\nthing that I'm gonna say we're gonna\ntalk a little bit about and then we're\nwe're done for the day okay let me get\nout of zoom and meeting for all [ __ ]\ndone with that Zoom okay last thing to\nunderstand so a lot of people are\nconfused about like isn't this a place\nto vent no it's not a place to vent it's\na place to\ngrow so let's understand when it's okay\nto vent and when it's not okay to\nvent see venting is like passing\ngas like sometimes you got to do it to\nrelieve the tension but just like\nfarting venting makes things a little\nbit worse for everyone around you so if\nI walk into a room and I start venting\nabout how my life is hard do I need that\nrelease absolutely but what effect does\nit have on the people around you it's\nnot\npositive right it they have to absorb\nthat negative emotional energy so then\nwhat happens is we have these safe\nspaces on the internet where people come\nand they vent have you all been to those\nsafe spaces we've had tons of posts on\nour subreddit of I can't hang out here\nanymore this place is way too toxic and\nnegative for my mental because everyone\nis coming here and just venting their\nstuff so this is like and it's like good\nto vent right but then like you'll even\nsee this sometimes where like you know\npeople will like vent and then everyone\nelse starts venting and then suddenly\nyou're in a room where everyone is\nfarting and then it smells like\n[ __ ] so it's not that you shouldn't\nvent so even when is a therapist if my\npatients want to vent that's good but\nremember that the purpose of venting is\nto clear your emotional energy so that\nthat you can take\naction see a lot of people like I you\nknow we had a guest she'll remain\nunnamed who's kind of like you know\ndon't don't psychiatrist a therapist\ndon't they just want to like basically\nlike addict you where you come in you\ntalk to them about their problems and if\nthey never help you you come in every\nweek you talk about your problems talk\nabout your problems talk about your\nproblems and then you're kind of hooked\nand then you never make any progress\nthat's not the point I mean sometimes it\nis but not usually right so there's some\npeople who are in a space where they\ncannot make effective change in their\nlife they are so they have so little\npower or agency in their life that the\nonly thing that they have left is that\nthey need someone else to help them stay\nafloat so sometimes therapy is for\nthat but the whole point of venting is\nthat you clear your emotional energy\nthen your mind is thinking clearly and\nonce your mind is thinking clearly you\ntake action to actually fix the\nproblem so venting is the first step it\nis cleaning the kitchen before you cook\nnow this is the problem is that this has\nbeen lost for like 95% of the\ninternet and you have PE places where\npeople just go to vent vent vent vent\nvent right without ever taking action\nwithout ever actually doing something\nabout the problem and so sometimes\npeople will come and they'll they'll be\nsurprised because they're like isn't\nthis a safe space and like yeah we want\npeople to feel safe here but I don't\nknow what the term safe space\nmeans cuz often times it seems like when\nwhen like the way people interpret it is\nlike safe space means I get to say\nwhatever the [ __ ] I want to I can take a\nI can walk into the room I can take a\ndump on the ground and then no one is\ngoing to like get upset and if anyone\ntells me that I'm doing something that's\nout of line it's no longer a safe space\nsafe space you're restricting my speech\nwhatever now on the flip side there are\nreasons to create safe\nspaces right so we have some areas of\nthe internet where like unless we keep\nsome people out they will come inside\nand start dumping on the ground and we\ndon't want to do that so we want yall to\nfeel safe but the goal here is not\nsafety the goal here is\ngrowth and in that event of course we\nwant to keep it safe right we don't want\nlike predators and [ __ ] like that so I'm\nnot saying that safety is bad but what\nI'm saying is that some somehow I don't\nknow what safe space has started to mean\nto some\npeople right it's like this means that\nno one is allowed to criticize me when I\nopen my mouth like that's not what this\nis I mean people criticize me and it's\nmy\nsubreddit right and it's like that's a\ngood\nthing people are like I don't like how\nDr K does like that's good like we're\nall on this journey together it's not\nreally my subreddit it's our\nsubreddit we're on this journey\ntogether I'm arguably a little bit\nfurther along but I'm not even sure of\nthat right that's the Pres because I'm\nthe guy who's in front of the\ncamera but if y'all pay attention to\nthis community the wisdom in this\ncommunity comes from the community\ndoesn't come from\nme we have people like Dr thers today we\nhave all of the people who have come on\npeople like Thor and people like random\nrandos from our community who have come\non and shared their experience and we've\nlearned from all of\nthem and so look in\nsummation you know I can totally\nunderstand how someone would read a post\nlike this and get very upset but I ask\nfor your patience and your compassion\nand it's not even that we're right right\nso this is the other thing if you listen\nto this you calm down and with a clear\nhead you say I think this is wrong\ntotally fine make your case we're here\nto\nlisten but if you jump to some kind of\nconclusion and all of the toxicity from\nthe other parts of your life\nfind a projection on this kind of thing\nthen that's not okay that's not what\nwe're here\nfor right and this is the kind of thing\nwhere like I'm sure someone out there is\nlike I'm going to make a\npost that has all these things but I'm\ngoing to reverse men with women let's\nsee what\nhappens I guarantee you there's someone\nout there thinking that you know why\nbecause I thought that because I used to\nbe that way\nand then I ask you fine you can do that\nyou can have your experiment you can\neven win but then what's the point what\nare you trying to prove that's not what\nwe're here for we're not here to prove\nsomeone right or prove someone wrong how\ndoes that help you\ngrow it's beyond the scope of what we're\ntrying to\ndo so these mods are working so hard to\ncreate a set of rules that allow us to\ngrow as human beings and who is us it's\nthe [ __ ] internet have y'all been to\nthe internet have y'all seen what a Cess\npool it is and now we have these mods\nthat are trying to create a space for\ncivil discussion and growth with this\n[ __ ] hand of cards and so so one of\ny'all out there is going to think like\nI'm going to I'm going to teach them\nthat their rules are bad and you're\ngoing to win because out of all the\nconniving [ __ ] you're going to\nwin because someone out there will be\nable to puncture a system of rules that\nour mods can develop because they're\nhuman and they're not\nperfect and no set of rules is perfect\nthere's always some way to like disarm\nsome set of rules find some way to twist\nthings around and get to what you want\nwhich is why I ask you what are you here\nfor are you here to fight a crusade\nagainst Injustice please I am grateful\nthat you're fighting a crusade against\nInjustice go do it somewhere\nelse let us focus on\ngrowth all right\nthus endeth the rant now if y'all want\nto I'm tempted to do maybe we'll kind of\nrevisit this because I think like\nwalking through this process is really\ngood what this person is sort of saying\nis like how do I change my beliefs if I\nhave a toxic set of\nbeliefs\num and so I I don't know we'll see so\nwe're going to we we'll see all on\nMonday uh we have our super secret\nproject should be coming coming out in a\ncouple months I don't know when we're\ndone filming a huge shout out to Dr\nthers for showing up today um sharing a\nlot about her perspective on women's\nmental health um I found it very\neducational I was able to if you guys\nstuck around you you notice like I was\nable to put together certain dots and\nand that's that's kind of like you know\nso I I think I do a pretty good job in\nsome ways when it comes to supporting\nwomen's mental health um obviously as a\nclinician my patients seem to like it\nand at the same time I think that like\nwithout the lived experience of being a\nwoman I I just can't connect some of the\ndots and so that's why I'm eternally\ngrateful for people like Dr\nthorderson and the women in our\ncommunity for sharing their perspective\nand and you know I can look at research\nDr thorderson can look at research like\nthere's it's not that I'm incompetent at\nthis it's that I cannot I can offer\nsomething from the male perspective\nbecause I have one big\nbucket of experience with growing up as\na man\nthe other thing that I would encourage\nyou all to do is there were many\nstatements made today hopefully yall\ndidn't get this Vibe but it's not like\nDr thorderson isn't saying that this\nthere's a similar thing that happens to\nmen we just condition them differently\nso the issues that we kind of talked\nabout were focused on women because\nthat's totally fine to do that sometimes\nwe talk about men right and the\nexperiences of different kinds of people\nare different and we have to be able to\ntalk about people's experiences in\nisolation sometimes it's useful to sort\nof\nnote that things are more widely\napplicable so I'm not saying that you\nknow it has to be 100% equal on both\nsides or 50/50 or whatever or that we\ncan't mention men if we're talking about\nwomen or we can't mention women if we're\ntalking about\nmen but hopefully this was helpful to\nyou all for the women in our community\nhopefully you found this educational and\nuseful for the men in our community\nhopefully you found this educational and\nuseful I think a lot of these Concepts\nlike cognitive load and stuff like that\nare things that we're not really aware\nof um especially as dudes and on the\nflip side there are going to be other\nkinds of hidden there's other kinds of\nhidden work that men\nexperience that women don't sort of\nthink about right so a good example of\nthis just one example is when there's a\nviolent patient on an on a on a\npsychiatric unit the men step forward no\none asks you to it's just one dude walks\nup to another dude and they say there's\nsomeone who's violent they would always\npage me they wouldn't page my female\ncolleagues right and that's just sort of\nthe expectation so there's hidden work\nall over the place for all kinds of\npeople and I think that we're going to\nget better the more we understand this\nas a\nwhole like it's not about it fairness or\nunfairness or anything like that I'm not\na j judge it's not I'm not God I can't\ndetermine what's fair or just our goal\nhere is to understand the experience of\nother people understand our own\nexperience then do what whatever we can\nto help it it's about moving it Forward\nnot whether it's 50/50 I I don't know\nabout\nthat right there's all kinds of hidden\nwork all over the place and people don't\nget thanked for\nit all right y all take care have a good\nweekend thank you so much for coming\nhere and honestly a huge shout out to\neveryone in this community whether\nyou're good you're bad you got banned\nyou didn't get banned whatever\nwhether you have a lot of up votes no up\nvotes like look everyone is here you're\nall a part of the process and I'm\ngrateful to each and every one of you\nbecause that's what like even the people\nwho are toxic we can learn from right\nand I say this to someone who was toxic\narguably is still toxic from time to\ntime depending on on how poorly my carry\nFarms"
