    "transcript": "so the more that you are learning the\nmore sleep signals your brain will be\nreceiving so as you store a bunch of\nstuff in your short-term memory our\nbrain says holy crap we have to encode\nall of this stuff from our Ram into our\nhard drive and that require sleep so\nwhat you will find is people who are\nengaged in cognitively intensive tasks\nwhere they are learning like learning\nnew things learning new languages it\nwill be easier for them to sleep because\nthe brain is sending signals sending\nsignals to your reticular activ system\nhey we need sleep hey we need sleep hey\nwe need sleep so this is different from\njust spending cognitive energy so if I'm\nplaying the same video game over and\nover and over again I'm not learning\nanything I'm not rising in rank right\nI'm not watching replays I'm not like\nfocused on learning something then I'm\nnot going to be able to sleep it is\nspecifically learning that triggers\nthings like brain derived neurotrophic\nfactor which will also help us sleep so\nwe want to send all of these kind of\nsignals to our brain to help us sleep"
