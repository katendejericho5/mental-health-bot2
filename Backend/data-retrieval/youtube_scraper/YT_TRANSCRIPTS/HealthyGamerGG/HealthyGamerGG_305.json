    "transcript": "so in our society today all the bad\nstuff is what feels really good playing\nvideo games using drugs pornography the\nbad stuff eating unhealthy food food\nthat is high in carbohydrates and fat\nand processed why does the worst stuff\nfeel so good it's because the world that\nwe live in today is so accessible and\neasy we have such an abundance of those\nthings and back in the day when we\nevolved the things that made us feel the\nbest were a rarity right if you look at\ncalorie density for example we used to\neat stuff like cassava I mean a lot of\nthe world still does right we'd eat\nthese different tubers and we'd forage\nand berries and stuff like that we\ndidn't have like animal farms we had\nlike we had to go out and Hunt so there\nwas a very natural balance between our\nyearning for something and the\navailability in the world the reason\nthat life has become harder is because\nlife has become abundant and easy and\nthe easier it gets the harder things\nbecome for us"
