    "transcript": "the world that we live in sucks and\nevery day it appears to be getting worse\nand as the world gets worse and worse it\nbecomes harder and harder to live in it\nwhich means that people are becoming\nincreasingly\nunhappy before we get into what the\nnature of happiness is I want to take a\nsecond to tell yall where I'm coming\nfrom so hi I'm Dr K I spent about 7even\nyears studying to become a monk and then\nended up becoming a psych atrist so my\nperspectives that I'm sharing with yall\ntoday are essentially a combination of\nthose two things if yall are interested\nin more resources on depression or\nwhatever else you're looking for there's\na ton of stuff on our YouTube channel we\nhave a Discord server and then we also\nhave things like drk's guide to\ndepression and we recently launched\nYouTube memberships where people can\nsort of make requests for more in-depth\nlectures if yall are interested check\nout the links in the description below\nso our impression is that the reason\nthat we're unhappy is because of all of\nthese events going around around outside\nof us and I'll be the first to admit\nthat like stuff is bad out there right\nyou can look at even very simple\nstatistics like the average us home\nprice prior to the pandemic was\n$290,000 with an interest rate of around\n3% a mere 3 years later the average home\nprice is\n$420,000 with a average interest rate of\nlike 6 to 7% so that means that a mere\nor four years ago you need to you needed\nto make\n$76,000 a year in order to be buy to buy\na home now you need to make\n$127,000 to be able to afford a house\nthis is crazy this is just a 4-year span\nso there is no question that things are\nobjectively harder the problem is that\nas Things become objectively harder we\nstart to surrender our happiness to\nthose circumstances we don't realize\nthat if I want to be happy happy today\nyeah the world can suck but I actually\nhave some component or some degree of\ncontrol or agency in how happy I am\ndespite the\ncircumstances now you may say Dr K\nthat's a load of BS right the reason I'm\nunhappy is because the world sucks and\nthe moment we start believing that we\nsurrender our happiness to the state of\nthe world so just think about what\nyou're doing there for a second okay if\nyou're saying that in order for me to be\nhappy I need the world to be back to\nwhere it was in the 1960s which by the\nway that was like the Epic generation\nright so to be born in the 50s have\nunprecedented economic growth from World\nWar II be live in the 60s and 70s when\neveryone's doing LSD and then\nnot requiring like any kind of college\ndegree or anything like slip into a job\nwith like minimal effort and then like\nevery there's an unprecedented level of\neconomic growth you retire in the '90s\nwith a full up pension and then you're\njust chilling like that's epic if the\nworld is an epic place and everything is\neasy then everyone gets to be happy the\nproblem is that if you assume that the\nworld has to be fixed in order for you\nto be happy you are trusting whoever is\nin power or macroeconomic events to\nessentially determine whether you're\nhappy or not that ain't going to work we\ndon't want to trust them it's those\npeople out there who made the world what\nit is today they're the ones who screwed\nit up and we do not want to UST our\nhappiness to them so we're going to\nlearn how to take it back so you may be\nskeptical but let's understand that even\nin a shared circumstance that everyone\nis dealing with there is a variability\nof Happiness so I think the best example\nof this is actually Victor Frankle in\nconcentration camps during the Holocaust\nso what Victor Frankle discovered is\nthat everyone's in a concentration camp\nand it sucks for everybody and yet I can\ndiscover some degree of happiness or\npeace in spite of my circumstances and\nwe also know this from a ton of like\nliterature on trauma and things like\nthat where you can have like populations\nthat go through genocide like there's\nactually an attempt at genocide and not\neveryone ends up with PTSD right there\nis something that we can do as human\nbeings to alter the way that we feel in\nspite of our circumstances now this is a\nskill that I think has been lost to a\ncertain degree and the generation before\nus didn't need it right so the better\nthe world is is the less good we need to\nbe at like finding happiness and\nstealing happiness out of the world\nbecause the world is pretty chilling now\nwhat's started to change is as the world\nhas gotten worse we need to train\nourselves in our mind we need a level of\nskills we need to adapt to our current\nenvironment in order to be happier so\nhow do we do that let's start by\nunderstanding what the nature of\nhappiness is so I'll give youall like a\nsimple example right so people will say\nthat comparison is the thief of joy and\nthat's somewhat true right so let's say\nthat I'm like going out there and like I\nmake myself a sandwich and that sandwich\nis really good and then I go to lunch\nwith my co-workers and I'm eating my\ndelicious sandwich but next to me\nthere's someone who has AR an even more\ndelicious sandwich and their sandwich\nhas a better bread and it's got this\nhomemade like garlic aoli instead of\nmayonnaise right like which is basically\nthe same thing with a little bit of\ngarlic powder I don't even know what\nthat stuff is but they have like the\nfancy version of the ingredients and so\nsuddenly the sandwich that I used to be\nenjoying I'm enjoying less because that\nperson out there has a better sandwich\nand we sort of know that this is true\nespecially with things like social media\nthe thing about social media is that it\nencourages us to compare I had five\npeople like my post but that person over\nthere gets 20 people liking their post\nand therefore I used to be really happy\nbut this person has it better than me so\nthen I feel less\njoyful now if only comparison was the\nthief of joy and you may be wondering\nwhat do you mean by that didn't you just\nsay that comparison is the thief of Joy\nno no it's not the thief of Joy it is\nsimply one of the thousands of thief\nthieves of joy that exist in our society\ntoday because there's all kinds of other\nthings that steal away our joy and if we\nreally want to understand how to steal\nit back we have to understand the nature\nof Joy okay so now I'll give you all\nlike let's run through a couple of other\nexamples so let's say I'm eating a\nburger okay so if I eat a hamburger\nwhere does the joy of the hamburger come\nfrom from so if I'm sitting there and\nI'm eating the burger and if I'm kind of\njust eating it right like it can be\npretty fun but what happens to the joy\nof eating a burger if I'm watching some\nkind of TV what happens if I'm eating a\nburger and my mind is worried and\nstressed about like the test that I have\ntomorrow or whether my boyfriend or\ngirlfriend is going to break up with me\nand so the first thing that we can sort\nof understand is that the joy doesn't\ncome from the burger itself there is\nsome layer of personal involvement let's\ncall it that for now we'll Define what\nit is that determines my happiness from\nthe burger so I'll give youall like a a\nsimple example right so let's say I eat\nthe burger and then like I start to\nthink to myself man I should have had a\nsalad and then I start to feel guilty\nand then even though the burger tastes\nreally good and I wanted to eat the\nburger suddenly something has happened\nwithin me that now I feel guilty now I'm\nthinking I should have eaten this other\nthing and then my joy from the burger\nhas somehow reduced so let's take a look\nat another example let's say that we're\ngoing to the bathroom and the key thing\nto understand is that when we go to the\nbathroom what is the one thing that we\nfear more than anything else the\ninability to take our phone with us\nright so let's understand what happens\nif you go to the bathroom without your\nphone you get bored so let's understand\nlike we try to avoid boredom at all\ncosts right that's why we've got this I\ndon't know about y'all but I'm the kind\nof person who like listens to an\naudiobook while I'm doing my dishes and\nthe second I'm done with my audiobook\nI'm turning on the TV and the second I'm\ndone turning off the TV I'm back to the\nAudi book or now I'm listening to a\npodcast so our mind is constantly\noccupied and what we consider boredom\nwhat is the nature of boredom is that I\nhave all these kinds of random thoughts\nthat don't have a focus so when I become\nbored if you really stop and think about\nit the amount of thinking that I'm doing\nactually increases and even if you look\nat comparison right so if I'm comparing\nI'm sitting there enjoying my my\nsandwich and what happens the moment I\nstart to compare literally what is\ncomparison within you it is an addition\nof thought so we start adding on a layer\nof thought of like I'm enjoying my\nsandwich and then suddenly like now I'm\ncomparing to this person now I'm\nthinking about this person I'm thinking\nthis I'm thinking this I'm thinking this\nand if we sort of think about even\nenjoying the burger right so if I'm\nenjoying the burger I don't know if yall\ncan tell but I must be hungry and it's\nalmost\nlunchtime so as I'm enjoying the burger\nif I'm distracted by something the more\nthoughts that I add to the equation the\nless I enjoy my experience and boredom\nis unregulated abundance of thoughts\nright so now we're starting to see a\npattern which is the more that I'm\nthinking the more unhappy I am now let's\nkind of take the flip side of it right\nso if we reduce our thoughts does it\nmake us happier and if we look at all of\nthe activities that people love what do\nall of these things do let's start with\nsubstances of abuse alcohol marijuana\nlike what do these things do oh my God\nso anxious I'm worried about this I'm\nworried about this the world is going to\nhell let me get high let me get drunk\nand then what happens to our thoughts\nour thoughts slow down right we reduce\nthe number of thoughts that we have\nwe're able to just think about one thing\nright so you have these profound\nRevelations of like thinking when you're\nhigh right and so let's look at other\nthings healthier versions of this so now\nwe come to mindfulness so everyone is\nlike oh my God like we need to do\nmindfulness practices oh my God like I'm\ngoing to do this mindfully like mindful\nmindful mindful but if we really look at\nmindfulness mindfulness isn't about\nmindfulness it's actually about mind\nemptiness the purpose of mindfulness is\nnot to have your mind full it's\nliterally to empty your mind so as we\nbefore we sit down to meditate for\nexample our mind is filled with thoughts\nand as we focus on our breath or as we\nchant a monra or as we engage in some\nkind of mindfulness practice what we are\nliterally doing is reducing the amount\nof thoughts in our mind and it's not\njust these things this is where also you\ncan look at Psychopathology okay so if\nwe look at Psychiatry we have a lot of\nmedications that never cure an illness\nand what do all of these\nmedications share what do they all do\nthey all have one very fundamental\nmechanism of action which is that they\nnumb and slow down the mind okay so if\nwe look at something like ssris which\nare serotonergic medications what they\nessentially do is emot emotionally numb\nus side effects of ssris include\nemotional numbness and sedation right so\nif we have someone who is thinking too\nmuch let's say they're depressed and\nwhat is it what's happening in the mind\nof a depressed person they're constantly\nthinking about how bad they are what is\nhappening in the mind of an anxious\nperson so we know that one of the\nfeatures of anxiety is something called\nrumination which is when you think about\nthe same thing over and over and over\nand over again and what is our treatment\nfor that we're going to give you a\nmedication that will slow down your\nthoughts and numb that crap out but it's\nnot just the ssris we also have people\nwith schizophrenia or psychosis and we\ngive them anticho medications side\neffects include sedation and what does\nthis literally do it slows down the\nactivity in some parts of our brain so\nif we're doing things like hallucinating\nand thinking all these like negative\ndelusional thoughts those literally get\nnumbed out but they make us kind of\nnumbed out and sedated ah but Dr K what\nabout other medications like benzo di\naines so this is another treatment for\nanxiety which is basically like alcohol\nin a pill form works on the same\nreceptors the gab receptors of the brain\nand what does this do it kind of chills\nus out it kind of works like alcohol we\nstart thinking less right we cut back on\nthe rumination ah but Dr K those three\nthings are all sedating but what about\nstimulant medication in ADHD the\nmedication that we give wakes people up\nit's a stimulant haha it doesn't slow us\ndown once again\nincorrect what do we stimulate with ad\nHD medication we stimulate our frontal\nloes what do our frontal loes do they\ncontrol and act as breaks and slow down\nthe other parts of the mind if you look\nat someone who has ADHD their mind is\nmoving in a thousand different\ndirections how is it that a stimulant\nallows them to literally slow down which\nis what it does because it increases the\nstrength of the brakes it shuts off a\nlot of thinking so our whole system of\npsychopharmacology in psychiatry is all\nabout slowing down thinking of the mind\nand what we've discovered and this is\nwhat's really cool what we've discovered\nis whether we slow down the mind in\ndepression it improves depression it\nimproves anxiety it improves ADHD it\nimproves psychosis all of our mental\npathologies are enhanced by slowing down\nthe mind this is also why meditation and\nmindfulness is an evidence-based\ntreatment for every single mental\nillness out there it works for\ndepression it works for anxiety it works\nfor ADHD works for schizophrenia right\nso how does that work it's because\nmeditation slows down the\nmind so now we're going to kind of sum\nthings up because if you understand this\nprinciple if you understand the nature\nof happiness in the mind you will able\nto be happy in today's world in spite of\nthe circumstances so if we look at all\nof the things that we dislike boredom\nincreased activity of the Mind Right\ncomparison is the thief of Joy I'm\nenjoying something and then thoughts\nstart coming in depression it means\nhyperth thinking about myself\ncomparisons in social media shatter my\njoy anxiety is rumination about a\nparticular problem the more we increase\nmental activity the more unhappy we\nbecome let's look at our antidotes how\ndo we end up being happy in today's\nworld we're going to get drunk we're\ngoing to get high we're going to binge\nwatch something and so if you really\nstop and think about it let's say I'm\neating a burger and I'm watching a TV\nshow what's happening in my mind I\ndisappear for an hour right I want to\nget caught up in something I want to\nwatch a TV show that makes me stop\nthinking I really want because when we\nbinge watch you know that really good\nthing it's like oh my God like I'm not\nthinking about anything else right I'm\njust focused on the show I want a show\nthat makes me forget everything else\nsame with video games same with\npornography right so when we watch\npornography like we stop thinking about\neverything else so even our psychiatric\nmedications and mindfulness they all\nwork on the same mechanism which is to\nslow down the thinking of the Mind hey\njust a quick note a lot of people will\nask discuss what do I do next and that's\nwhy we built Dr K's guide It's a\ncomprehensive resource that distills\nover 20 years of my experience both as a\nmonk and as a psychiatrist and it's\ndesigned in a way that's tailored to fit\nyour needs so if you're interested in\nbetter understanding your mind and\ntaking control of your life check out\nthe link below and so how do we use this\ninformation to steal back joy in today's\nworld so I want you all to start by just\nthinking a little bit about your own\nlife right so take the moments of your\nlife and I I recommend that you'll do\nthis over like a 24-hour period look at\nthe moments in your life where you are\nmore joyful where you are happier and\nmore content what is happening in your\nmind is it is there are there a ton of\nthoughts are there very few thoughts is\nthere thinking only about one thing\nright this is another reason by the way\nwhy orgasm is so enjoyable because\norgasm is a physiologically induced no\nmind State the second the orgasm is over\nyou start thinking oh my God was it good\nfor them was it good for them or not oh\nmy God oh my God and right before orgasm\nyou may be thinking oh my God are they\nenjoying it are they enjoying it but\nthat moment of orgasm it all disappears\nso I want y'all to start by just paying\nattention to what are the moments of joy\nin your life and what are the moments of\nunhappiness in your life and what I\nreally want you to pay attention to is\nthe level of mental activity going on in\nyour\nmind the next thing to consider is what\nlevel of control do you have around how\nthe world enters you you okay so we\nthink that I am unhappy because my\ncircumstances are bad and if we take\nlike the example of me for example like\nso I have a really I'm lucky right so I\nhave a lot of stuff going for me I'm\nblessed to have a wonderful wife I've\ngot kids I've got a stable income like\nI'm so lucky in so many ways therefore I\nmust be happy right but if you actually\nstop and think about it my experience\nwas that the happiness came first I went\nto India and I learned this principle\nwhen I had failed out of college when\nwhen I had no money when I was 26 years\nold I had a 2.5 GPA no prospects no\nincome nothing and yet I was content\nbecause I understood this principle I\nunderstood that the circumstances in my\nlife touch me in some way this is the\nkey thing to understand there's all\nkinds of crap going on outside in the\nworld but as that stuff touches you it\nenters your mind and the moment it\nenters your mind the moment it enters\nyour being you have some degree of\ncontrol over how you receive it right\nand this is the tricky thing some of\ny'all may say okay but like what's the\ndegree is it 1% can you modify things by\n10% can you modify things by 50% can you\nmodify things by 99% what amount of your\nhappiness is determined by your\ncircumstances and what amount of\nhappiness is determined by the way you\nreceive things now I'm not going to give\ny'all a clear answer this is something I\nwant y'all to figure out I'm very\nconfident in what the answer is and I\nthink you know what the answer is too\nbut I want yall to play around with it\nright so what I want yall to do is first\nnotice how active is my mind when I'm\nhappy and how inactive is my mind when\nI'm unhappy so look at those two things\nthe next thing that I want yall to try\nto do is to try to notice that okay if\nthe less activity in my mind correlates\nwith happiness then literally all I need\nto do is reduce the activity of my mind\nright so when I receive some kind of bad\nnews what will sort of notice if you\nreceive bad news what happens in your\nmind your mind starts looping oh my God\nthis is going to happen this is going to\nhappen this is going to happen this is\ngoing to happen this is going to happen\nthis is going to happen right this\nliterally what happens and I know it\nsounds kind of weird but like even in\nthat moment where this bad news has hit\nyou let's say you got dumped if you can\nslow down the activity of your mind\nliterally the happiness returns this is\nwhy we binge watch stuff and get drunk\nafter a breakup because it slows down\nthe activities of our mind and now we\nget to the really weird thing which is\nthat the happy that you feel you view as\na chronic state right my life is bad\ntherefore I am chronically unhappy but\nif you really look at your life what\nyou'll see is that there's fluctuations\nit goes up and down throughout the day\neven if your life is the same the level\nof unhappiness that you literally\nexperience from moment to moment as you\nlive your day\nfluctuates now this is a really\nimportant Revelation because what this\nmeans is that if we can find what those\nhigh points are and we can expand them\nby slowing down our mind oh my God I\njust got dumped or oh my God this thing\nis happening let me meditate for a few\nminutes let me take a deep breath let me\njust enjoy this sandwich let me be\nfocused on this one thing I have to eat\nanyway but thinking about my problems\ndoesn't actually solve anything so let\nme just enjoy the sandwich and as yall\npractice this and you can literally\npractice meditation that's the best way\nto sort of train this skill doesn't\nmatter what kind of meditation you do\nbut the most important thing is\nobservation as you practice this you\nwill discover something really really\nfascinating and this is where people get\nreally really tripped up everyone thinks\nif someone's life is good that's why\nthey're happy but the truth is is that\nit goes the other way as you become\ncontent and happier in your day-to-day\nlife despite your\ncircumstances the instrument that you\nuse to improve your life becomes way\nstronger right so when I get dumped what\nis the best frame of mind to actually\nhealthily move out of that if I'm\nanxious if I'm depressed if I'm\ncatastrophizing I can't actually improve\nmy circumstances and this is what I\ndiscovered in India is that when I\nstarted to become content with myself\nwhen I started to be accept myself when\nI stopped ruminating all the time and\nhaving all these consuming thoughts that\nI had to self-medicate with binge like\nplaying video games for 20 hours a day\nwhen I stopped having to do that crap\nwhen I could accept who I was when I\ncould just exist in my own skin for a\nfew hours suddenly I can actually make\nprogress to improve my life so the\nhappiness actually comes first and if\nyou can sort of discover that even 1%\n10% 50% you will be your mind will be\nfree of anxiety free of depression as\nyour mind becomes free of those things\nyou can start suddenly start actually\nmaking your life better you can start\nacting in a forward momentum and the\nproblem is right now the anxiety\nparalyzes you from even improving\nso I know it sounds crazy but I\nencourage you all to really look at this\nright start to really think about what\nis it that accounts for the fluctuations\nin my happiness throughout the day and\nI'm giving youall a direction to look at\nwhich is look at the activity of your\nmind and then what you'll discover is\nthat as I modify the activity of my mind\nas I'm able to be present when I do a\nparticular thing I will find more joy in\nit and as you find more joy in basic\nthings your mind will calm down your\nmind will fall into line and then the\nBeautiful thing is then you can leverage\nit utilize it to actually fix something\nin the outside\nworld so we all think that the reason\nwe're unhappy today is the world is\ngoing to and we're not wrong in\nthat sense right like the world is going\nto and yet not everyone is equally\nunhappy some people have figured out how\nto be resilient how to not let the alses\nof the World Bowl them over and the\nproblem is that in our society this is a\nskill set that the generation before us\ndid not ever need to train because their\nlife was good but as the world changes\nwe need to be darwinian we need to be\nlike Darwin's finches and we need to\nadapt by learning how to steal back\nhappiness from a world that is trying\nvery hard to take it\n[Music]\naway"
