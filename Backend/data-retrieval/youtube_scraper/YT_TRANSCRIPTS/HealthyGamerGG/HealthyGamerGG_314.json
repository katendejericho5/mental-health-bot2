    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how ADHD\nis actually a meditation\nsuperpower before we dive in further\nabout ADHD and meditation and how it's a\nsuperpower I want to take a second to\ntell youall where I'm coming from so I'm\nalo kenoa also known as Dr K I studied\nfor about seven years to become a monk\nand then ended up going to med school\nand becoming a psychiatrist so a lot of\nwhat we're teaching yall today is sort\nof a combination of these perspectives\nif y'all want more on ADHD or meditation\nwe've got plenty of videos on our\nYouTube channel and we also have uh Dr\nK's guide to ADHD and doing stuff so if\ny'all are interested y'all can check\nthat stuff out now if you're listening\nthis you're probably like oh my God what\nclickbait man what are you saying ADHD\nis not good at meditation it makes it so\nhard because honestly that's our\nexperience right so we sort of think\nthat meditation is sitting there and\nfocusing on something incredibly boring\nlike my breath and I'm just going to\nobserve the breath and after all of like\n6 seconds if you've got ADHD you're kind\nof bored with that and honestly I was\nsuper bored with it too when I first\nstarted learning meditation I found it\nto be incredibly boring but that's not\nbecause meditation is incredibly boring\nor even that my mind wasn't strong\nenough to be able to meditate properly\nbecause that's what we think too right\nif you've got ADHD or if you're someone\nwho's bad at meditating you think that\nokay if I practice this long enough and\nI keep doing it eventually my mind will\nimprove and then I'll be able to focus\nand then it'll be fun but that's not\nactually how it works it's a bunch of BS\nif you find meditation to be boring\nthat's because the kind of meditation\nthat we have all learned is for\nneurotypical people so let's think about\nthis for a second okay so there's been\nan explosion of mindfulness and\nmindfulness is not actually meditation\nif we sort of look at what has exploded\nand what everyone has access to whether\nit be like apps or whatever and this\nkind of person is teaching mindfulness\nand mindfulness mindfulness mindfulness\nwhy has that spread so the things that\nare naturally going to spread in our\nsociety are things that are good for\nneurotypical people because the majority\nof us are neurotypical but if you stop\nand really examine what true meditation\nis the most advanced forms of meditation\nif you have something like ADHD you may\nactually find that you have an advantage\nat those forms of meditation now you may\nbe wondering what do you mean Advanced\nforms of meditation so there's this\nplace in the world called the Himalayas\nand in the Himalayas there are caves and\nin the caves there are people who sit\nthere and meditate for 30 40 50 even by\nsome people's claims hundreds of years\nnow the question is what on Earth are\nthose people doing are people who sit in\ncaves in the Himalayas just observing\ntheir breath for like 30 years at a\nstretch and the answer is absolutely not\nthis was not something that I understood\nuntil I actually went there and like\nlearned from some of those people and\nthat's when I discovered what real\nmeditation is now if we want to really\nunderstand what real meditation is let's\nstart by understanding this whole\nmindfulness thing so mindfulness is\nbased off of the Zen tradition okay so\nthe Zen or the Buddhist tradition is\nlike it's a very very like strict kind\nof\nstraightforward kind of like really\nhardcore form of meditation just to give\nyou all an example a a common Zen\npractice is for Zen Masters to walk\naround and smack disciples with bamboo\nswitches or sticks like this is part of\nthe practice so the whole point of Zen\nis like we're going to sit there and\nwe're going to Brute Force our way to\nEnlightenment and as part of this track\nto enlight enen we need to learn things\nlike let go of expectation and to learn\nacceptance right this is the kind of\ncrap that we all talk about learn to\naccept like don't expect things like\nlive life like the way it is and that's\nreally hard to do which is why what Zen\nMasters figured out is the most\nefficient way to teach people which\nactually involves a mild form of\nphysical abuse so what Zen Masters would\nliterally do is you're sitting there\nmeditating and the Zen master smacks you\nwith a stick and if we stop and think\nabout it what happens after someone\nsmacks us with a stick you're walking\ndown the the halls of the asham or the\nmonastery boom Zen master jumps out of\nthe bushes and smacks you with a stick\nyou're sitting there eating your food or\ntrying to like cook for everybody else\nand zen master pops out smacks you with\na stick and so if you sort of think\nabout it what happens so the first thing\nthat happens if you get smacked by a\nstick a couple times you get really\nangry but you can't really do anything\nabout it right and then what happens is\nyou start to like fear the stick so\naround every corner and Bush you kind of\nlike like you're like oh my God is this\nzen master there there's a zen master\nthere and the Zen master these guys are\nreal bastards okay they leave you alone\nfor like a month so then you kind of\ncalm down and then like once your guard\nis now they're like smack you with a\nstick this is literally a part of the\nZen tradition and So eventually what\nhappens is the only thing that you can\ndo because anticipating it doesn't work\nbecause these people have been smacking\npeople with sticks for like 20 years\nokay so they're like better at it than\nyou are sort of anticipating it doesn't\nwork and then eventually what ends up\nhappening is you sort of realize as a\nZen disciple that nothing I can do to\nstop the master from smacking with a\nstick and if you really stop and think\nabout it it's not like he's smacking me\nme with a stick for like 24 hours a day\nit just kind of jumps out occasionally\nand smacks with a stick it's a bamboo\nswitch it doesn't really cause lasting\ndamage it's kind of annoying So\neventually I'm going to just learn to\nignore him I'm going to treat the Zen\nmaster like a mosquito that bites me and\nwhen you do that you've kind of advanced\nin the Zen tradition that's the whole\npoint is to sort of let go of all of\nyour expectations and just accept\nwhatever comes now the problem is that\nby today's standards this is considered\nphysical abuse right if I opened a\nmonastery and I was like yeah I'm going\nto teach y'all to meditate and by the\nway I'm going to be smacking you with a\nstick you're going to be like no that's\nnot for me so what's happened is that\nthis is originally the tradition that\nthat mindfulness came from but what's\nhappened is this tradition has removed a\nlot of these pieces and so what we're\nwhat we end up with is a very watered\ndown version of the original tradition\nbecause based on our you know human\nrights climate this kind of stuff is\nunacceptable and so what we sort of end\nup with is this super water down version\nof mindfulness where we're just sitting\nthere and like observing our breath and\nlike we've got an app and maybe we'll do\nsome visualizations that's not what the\npeople in the Himalayas are doing so\nwith this watered down version if we're\nsitting there and observing the breath\nif you've got ADHD you're going to get\nbored so if we look at the brains of\npeople with ADHD there are a couple of\nfeatures which we think of as\ndisadvantages but they're only\ndisadvantages unless we're meditating in\nthe right way so the first thing is that\npeople with ADHD love novelty right you\nlike new things if there's something new\nthere your like mind is going to be\nsuper excited about it if you try to do\nthe same thing over and over and over\nagain your mind is going to wander and\nyou're going to get bored of stuff so if\nwe sit down and try to do a standard\nmindfulness practice we're basically\ntold to do the same damn thing that is\nreally boring over and over and over\nagain which works great if you're\nneurotypical but really sucks if you\nhave\nADHD the second aspect of ADHD which\nmakes it really hard for us to meditate\nnormally but it's actually a superpower\nif we meditate in sort of these this\nHimalayan Master way is that we're\nhighly highly distractable or we're\nhighly highly sensitive to small things\nso this is really important to\nunderstand so if I'm sitting there and\ntrying to study and I've got ADHD we\nthink of this as distractability right\nso in the Psychiatry pathology model we\ntake an aspect of your mind and we say\nyou're sick because you can't study and\nwe want everyone to be able to sit there\nand read a book but this is neither good\nnor bad this is just how your mind works\nso whereas most people can sit there and\njust read the book and like they there\nall kinds of sounds and there's like a\nbird that flies by and someone is\nwalking over here our mind is able to\nfocus now if we have ADHD what happens\nis our mind is what we call distractible\nbut I'm going to change that what we\nreally have is a mind that's highly\nsensitive so this means that whereas\nnormal Minds will ignore or not even\npick up all kinds of stuff that's going\non around us if you have an ADHD mind\nyou are highly sensitive to everything\nthat goes on around you it's not that\nyour mind is distractable it's that your\nmind is highly highly perceptive and you\ndon't know how to control that\nperception there are even some\nevolutionary studies of ADHD hypotheses\nreally\nthat suggest that the reason that we\nhave ADHD within the population is\nbecause when there were some people out\nthere who were like foraging that there\nare actually advantages to being highly\nperceptive right so I want to be able to\npick up okay this twig is broken over\nhere there's a a footprint over here and\nif my mind is highly perceptive I won't\nbe caught off guard now that worked\nreally well when we were hunter\ngatherers but now in a society of nine\nto fives and sitting there and reading\ntextbooks and doing the same damn wrote\ntask over and over over and over again\nour mind is not adaptable to that but as\nour society has moved in that direction\nour meditations have moved in that\ndirection as well so two key features\nkind of neuroscientifically of the ADHD\nbrain are an appreciation for novelty\nand a high degree of distractability or\nanother way to put that is highly\nsensitive to the tiniest little thing\nright other people can study but all it\ntakes is a tiny little bell over there\nand your mind is distracted now the the\ninteresting thing is as we move from the\nwater down meditation to the hardcore\nmeditation these things that you think\nare weaknesses start to become strengths\nnow in order to understand that we have\nto understand what hardcore meditation\nactually is so what are those people in\nthe Himalayas actually doing so they're\nnot observing their breath over and over\nand over again in kind of a a boring way\nwhat they're actually doing is exploring\ntheir internal universe and I sounds\nkind of weird but if you stop and like\nreally look within\nyourself you will discover that there is\nan endless amount of exploration within\nyou so let's say you take a thought or\nan emotion and you can ask yourself\nwhere does this thought come from and\nthen you will track that down into\nsomething within you that you've never\nseen before and then you can ask\nyourself okay where does that thought\ncome from where does that thought come\nfrom where does that thought come from\nand you can literally go on basically\nclose close to Infinity exploring within\nyourself if you feel an emotional\nreaction let's say you're walking down\nthe street and you see someone eating a\nbiscuit and then you can sort of say oh\nwow like now I want a biscuit and you\ncan actually close your eyes and you can\nexplore where did this a desire for a\nbiscuit came biscuit come from well it\ncame from my sense organs well how much\ndo I want the biscuit well I wanted a\nlot why do I want it a lot today and I\ndidn't want it a lot yesterday so you\ncan kind of go on with this internal\nexploration and we'll teach youall how\nto do this so it'll become a lot clearer\nthis sort of internal exploration can\nkind of continue like towards Infinity\nit's kind of like within the internal\nUniverse I know it sounds weird but\nwe'll yall will understand in a second\nit's kind of like imagine that I board a\nspaceship and I just fly towards the\nends of the universe so this is\nliterally what those people in the\nHimalayas and caves in the Himalayas are\ndoing they're sort of exploring this\ninternal environment in subtler and\nsubtler ways and they're making really\ncool discoveries they're not sitting\nthere doing the same damn rote thing\nover and over and over again they're\nliterally out there or in there\nexploring the vastness of the internal\nUniverse now you may be wondering okay\nlike what the hell does that kind of\nmean so we're going to teach y'all a\npractice that will hopefully illustrate\nthis okay so we're going to teach y'all\nom chanting which I know maybe youall\nknow how to chant M but we're going to\nteach you a different way of om chanting\nthat I have found I love and I'm I kind\nof have subclinical ADHD and when I have\npatients who have ADHD and I teach them\nthis kind of meditation meditation not\nonly becomes easy for them it actually\nbecomes enjoyable for them okay so the\nmain thing about om chanting that we're\ngoing to do we're not going to sit there\nand chant M the goal is not to complete\na task because the ADHD brain hates that\nthe goal is to explore so we're going to\ntake om chanting and we are going to\nturn it into an exploration so I want\nyall to sit up straight head head\nstraight neck straight spine straight\nand what I want you to do is om chanting\nis really simple we're going to open our\nmouths like we are mouth breathers right\nwe're going to do this and then we're\ngoing to go we're just going to emit\nsound so just emit sound with an open\nmouth\nAh that's the first version okay and\nit's really simple we're just going to\nemit sound with a open mouth and then\nwe're going to go all the way to a\nclosed mouth that's all om chanting is\nit's not some special thing it's just\nneutral open mouth emitting sound\nwithout trying to say anything all the\nway to closed mouth\nso and that's what om chanting is if you\nliterally look at the actual like you\nknow translation of M it's not om it's\nauu m and why is that it's because with\na completely open mouth ah with a half\nopen mouth\nuh and then with a fully closed\n[Music]\nmouth that's what om chanting is so\nwe're going to go from start to finish a\nthrough U all the way to M and we kind\nof want to do it in a gradual way so we\nwant the whole thing to maybe last 9 10\n12 seconds something like that so we're\ngoing to open our mouths do it with\n[Music]\nme\nM that's one round now what does this\nhave to do with ADHD superpower\nmeditation so when we do this practice\nthe goal is not to chant a certain\nnumber of times the goal is to pay\nattention within us and what you will\ndiscover is that there is a really\nreally subtle and profound vibration\nthat happens within you so when we chant\nwe're not focused on sound we're going\nto pay attention to our vibration so now\nwe're going to close our eyes we're\ngoing to chant one more time okay and\nwhat I want youall to do is pay\nattention to how the sound travels\nthrough your body so close your eyes\nopen your mouth deep breath\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\nin now chances are as you do that you\nfeel some kind of VI ation but you're\nnot quite sure where it is the most\ncommon thing that people originally feel\nis that the a in the U are kind of\nsomewhere around here and then the m is\nvery like centrally located kind of\nsomewhere in your head and even towards\nthe end of the M you'll notice that the\nvibration kind of goes from the bottom\nof your your chin kind of the to the top\nof your head okay so you may be\nwondering okay like why are we doing\nthis stuff so now we're going to get\ninto what real meditation is so you've\ndone this you maybe you're just\nlistening along or maybe you're like\nwatching this on the Subway or something\nyou can't start chanting like a\nweirdo but as you do this practice\nwhat's going to happen is you will\ndiscover all kinds of subtle variations\nof vibration within you so for example\nat this point when I chant you know I\ncan really feel the ah starts down here\nthe uh is like spreading out from the\nmiddle of my chest and then the M starts\nat the bottom of the chin and goes kind\nof all the way to the top and this is\nwhat real meditation is so when we do\nthis kind of meditation the goal isn't\nto chant like seven times and get bored\nwith it while your mind is distracted\nactually what we need is for your mind\nto be\nhyperfocused on trying to detect as much\nvibration as you can so what we're sort\nof doing is like right now we're at the\ntop where we can't really detect a whole\nlot but as we move as we really pay\nattention you'll start to discover that\nokay there's actually something that I\ncouldn't detect before and as you sort\nof hone in on on that and you get really\ngood at detecting that second layer of\nvibration you'll discover a third layer\nof vibration underneath it and this is\nwhere if you try to come to an answer\nand you say I don't feel it I'm done\nthen this isn't going to work for you\nthe whole point is if you practice a\nlittle bit if you really close your eyes\nand you try to really feel that\nvibration it's just like sort of trying\nto close your eyes and like let's say\nI'm drinking a wine or a beer and I say\nif I really close my eyes and I\nconcentrate I can notice notes of like\noh there's like notes of and Oak and\nlike oh my like there's some kind of\nburgundy or like there's some kind of\nlike I don't know flowers or seeds or\nfruit or it's got a note of fruit or\nwhatever the right this is what\nlike people wine tasters do this is what\nthose people in the Himalayas are doing\nthey're noticing these subtler and\nsubtler things happening within\nthemselves and all I can say is that\nwhen I've taught this to my patients and\nwhen I learned it myself it became\nincredibly addicting it's like so cool\nthat if I really pay attention I can\ndiscover something about vibration that\nI've never discovered before and then\nthe really cool thing about this and\nthis is what really reinforces it is if\nyou do this for a little while you'll\nstart to like understand things about\nthe universe now this is hard to explain\nbecause until it happens to you you're\nnot going to really get it but this it\nit's really weird like you start to see\nthat this vibration of M is present in\nother kinds of places that you see it's\nkind of weird and esoteric and mystical\nyou just got to trust me if you keep\ndoing this for a while you'll start to\ndiscover things and that's just kind of\nhow it works and if you can get to that\nfirst point of Discovery then meditation\nwill become really easy for you now\nlet's talk a little bit about how ADHD\nis an advantage for this so the the key\nthing to understand is that remember\nwhat we're looking for is novelty right\nso as we subtly increase our awareness\nas we pick up more about subtle\nvibrations this becomes more and more\nnovel for us in the ADHD mind will\nbecome addicted to it the second thing\nthat we're really good at is remember\nthat ADHD people are highly distractable\nbut highly distractable is bad if you're\ntrying to study but let's remember what\nthis really is is our perception is very\nvery sensitive so whereas a normal\nperson when I sort of teach this to\npeople without ADHD it takes way longer\nfor them to understand what the hell I'm\ntalking about whereas if you have ADHD\nand you are willing to give it a shot\nyou will actually Advance quicker than\nthe neurotypical person hey just a quick\nnote a lot of people will ask us what do\nI do next and that's why we built Dr K's\nguide It's a comprehensive resource that\ndistills over 20 years of my experience\nboth as a monk and as a psychiatrist and\nit's designed in a way that's tailored\nto fit your needs so if you're\ninterested in better understanding your\nmind and taking control of your life\ncheck out the link below so now let's\nget to practicalities what should you\nactually do so this is where things get\nhard because I'm not going to tell you\nthat you should do seven rounds of ohm\nthat's not going to be enough nine\nrounds of ohm is not going to be enough\n21 rounds of ohm is even not enough for\nmy ADHD patients what I recommend is 33\nohms and you're sitting there and you're\nsaying oh my God Dr Kate 33 that's so\nlong that's like half an hour of\nmeditating I can't do that and this is\nwhere you will say that at the very\nbeginning which I totally get but if you\nreally want to get to this what you will\nnotice is if you do 33 ohms and you can\nwork your way up by going 7 9\n21 33 like you can step yourself up that\nway that's totally okay but the real\ngoal is to do many many rounds and what\nyou will literally notice is that there\nis a huge difference between the first\nohm and the 333rd ohm the two\nexperiences will be completely different\nyou will notice so many more things\nwithin yourself at the 33rd round\ncompared to the seventh round cuz\nremember when we start to meditate the\nfirst couple rounds our mind isn't even\nreally paying atten attention we're\ntrying to really pay attention we're\ntrying to sort of settle it down but as\nyou get into more and more rounds you\nwill discover like the experience\ncompletely\nchanges and even for me having meditated\nfor 20 years even today when I sit down\nand I do this kind of practice or\nanother kind of month or practice I\nstill notice that my mind doesn't jump\nright to the end of the practice right\nat the beginning even when I chant M\ntoday it takes me five seven nine rounds\nto really get into it which is just sort\nof how the practice works so I know that\na lot of people out there think that\nADHD like they suck at meditation and\nyour experience has been that meditation\nis hard because you can't force your\nmind to focus and then you look at all\nthese scientific studies that say that\nyeah like it's trains your frontales and\nthen you're kind of like practicing\nfocusing and all that crap is true but\nthe key thing to understand is that the\nmeditation that we practice today is\nactually a watered down version of a\ntradition that used to be so much more\nrobust this is like the difference\nbetween a cocktail and a mocktail it's\nthe same drink we're just taking out all\nthe alcohol which is the point of a\ncocktail when we look at the Zen\ntradition it used to be a complete\ntradition and then it got kind of\nwatered down and turned into an app and\nturned into a subscription service and\nbecame a business model that private\nEquity companies and VC companies are\nlike investing in because everyone's\ninto meditation the the true\nspirituality of the practice has been\ncompletely annihilated and why is that\nit's because you've got meditation apps\nthat are competing and if they're\ncompeting they realize oh my God if I\nmake this too hard for someone someone\nis going to unsubscribe from my\nsubscription service and they're going\nto sign up for someone else who makes it\neasier for them so we're going to\npretend that we're meditating and we're\ngoing to help people feel good about\nthemselves but we don't actually care\nabout your spiritual growth whereas a\nzen master who's smacking you with a\nstick is actually invested in your\nspiritual growth they don't care whether\nyou come or go because you're not paying\nthem anything anyway so our whole system\nof meditation has been bastardized by\nall this crap going on and if this is\nthe reason that you think you're bad at\nmeditation it's not that you're bad at\nmeditation it's that the people who are\nteaching you meditation don't really\nknow what they're doing right their\ngoals are different their objectives are\ndifferent and it turns out that this\nhappened to me where like I started to\nmeditate and it was really hard and then\nsomeone taught me what actual meditation\nis and suddenly I fell in love with it\nso remember that if you want to meditate\nwith\nADHD don't do something rot explore\nwithin yourself try to discover as much\nas you can and what you will discover is\nif you give it a shot because you're not\ngoing to know this right away you'll\ndiscover that there are layers of stuff\ngoing on within you that are incredibly\nfascinating and you could keep on\npeeling away layers of the onion and\nlike you'll discover all kinds of things\nbut it's unclear whether the onion ever\nends so I have some ideas about that but\nthat's where I'm not going to give you\nthe answer you keep peeling them away\nand then you let me know what you\n[Music]\ndiscover"
