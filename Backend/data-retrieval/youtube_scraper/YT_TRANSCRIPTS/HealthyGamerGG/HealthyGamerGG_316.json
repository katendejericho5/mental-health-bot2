    "transcript": "if you want your brain to function\nbetter if you have ADHD you need to\nclean your room because even though you\ndon't notice that stuff your brain is\nliterally suppressing all of that\nsensory input which is a cognitive load\nthere are studies that show that when\npeople with ADHD clean their room their\ncapacity to study actually improves so\nif you study in a messy space with an\nADHD you literally have less ability to\nfocus on the task at hand cuz when we're\nstudying we're using top down processing\nso we're telling ourselves focus on this\nbut there's all this crap going on over\nhere that we're trying to suppress don't\nthink about that lamp don't think about\nthat mail don't think about this don't\nthink about this don't think about this\njust think about this and so as the\nnumber of things that your brain has to\nnot think about in order to focus\nincreases we become more cognitively\nfatigued so stuff blindness is\nabsolutely a thing and the most\nimportant thing that you can do to fix\nstuff blindness is to clean your room"
