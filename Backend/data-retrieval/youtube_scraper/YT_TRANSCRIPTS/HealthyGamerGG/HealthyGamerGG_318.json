    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about why\ndoing nothing is the most important\nthing you can\ndo now this may sound kind of bizarre\nbecause you're sitting there thinking\nwell I do a lot of nothing and in fact\nmy problem is that I do way too much\nnothing and instead I need to be doing\nsomething but it turns out that\nscientifically there are different kinds\nof nothing and we tend to do the wrong\nkinds of nothing and there are actually\ncertain kinds of lit in action that lead\nto positive outcomes in our life now\nthis may sound weird but just hear me\nout so right now we live in a world that\nis going to hell there's climate change\nproblems inflation problems dating and\ngender Dynamics are a mess like people\nunder the age of 30 are mostly living\nwith their parents there's like Wars and\nstuff going on the world is an absolute\nmess so as human beings when we are\nfaced with absolute messes we do\nparticular things and it turns out that\nthe things that we do when we are faced\nwith problems actually create more\nproblems than they solve as a simple\nexample let's say I have a final that's\ncoming up at the end of the week and I'm\nterrified that I'm not going to do well\nso what do I end up doing in order to\ndeal with this problem I end up spending\na lot of time playing video games or\nbinge watching shows or maybe even\ngetting drunk or something like that so\nit is the way that I try to solve my\nproblems that actually creates\nadditional problems it would be one\nthing if I just didn't do anything all\nday long but even the things that I\nchoose to engage in like let's say I do\nget drunk or go to a party or something\nlike that mean that I'm hung over the\nnext day which means that studying for\nthe test is actually harder the most\ncommon experience that I hear from\npeople today is despite the fact that\nthey're swimming really hard everyone is\nstill drowning despite the fact that you\nare trying to stay afloat the harder you\nseem to work the worse things become and\nthen what ends up happening is people\nfeel incredibly burnt out so today what\nwe're going to do is figure out how to\ncompletely re-evaluate that cycle and\nparadoxically do less but in the right\nway so this sort of idea actually comes\nfrom some really interesting research\naround coping mechanisms so coping\nmechanisms are things that we do when\nsomething is not going right so when I\nhave a problem the way that I manage\nthat problem is the way that I cope and\nrecently what I've heard especially in\nthe field of like Psychiatry and therapy\nand even just the internet is everyone's\nlike level up your coping mechanisms\nbruh like I need to be able to cope like\nI need my copium like oh my God like\neveryone needs to be meditating and\nexercising and spending time in nature\nand like these are the healthy coping\nmechanisms instead what we need to do is\nget rid of the unhealthy coping\nmechanisms I need to be meditating\ninstead of watching porn and jerking off\nwell it ain't that easy right and so\ntoday what we're actually going to teach\nyou is a little bit better of a way to\ndeal with your problems with actually\ndoing less because that's actually the\nmost powerful coping mechanism I know it\nsounds crazy but hear me out let's start\nwith the worst form of coping which is\ncalled emotion focused coping so motion\nfocused coping is when something goes\nwrong out there it creates an internal\nchange in here so if I am you know for\nexample if I have that test and I feel\nafraid what I'm going to sort of focus\non is not fixing the problem out there\nbut managing my internal emotional state\nthis is called emotion focused coping\nand what we sort of know from studies in\nPsychology Psychiatry coping mechanisms\nespecially things like trauma is that\nthe worst kind of coping mechanisms are\nactually emotion focused coping emotion\nfocused coping mechanisms actually lead\nto poor outcomes over the long term so\nwhat that means more practically is if I\nsolve my problems or if the way I deal\nwith my problems because I'm not really\nsolving them or to actually change my\ninternal emotional state that actually\ndoesn't fix any problems and is going to\nlead to worse problems later on let's\njust think about this right so let's say\nI have a test I'm studying for or\nsupposed to be studying for and instead\nI feel incredibly anxious and fearful\nthat I'm not going to do well on the\ntest I really need an a I really need an\nA and what do I do with all that fear\nand anxiety I turn to something like\nvideo games or pornography or alcohol or\nmarijuana or whatever something to\nmanage my internal emotional state there\nare also other examples of this so let's\nsay you're in a relationship with\nsomeone who is very very dependent on\nyour emotional support or maybe you're\nthe one who needs emotional support and\nthen anytime you feel negative emotions\nin here your goal is to make those\nnegative emotions go away now this is a\nhuge problem nowadays especially with\nthings like trigger warnings now I'm not\ncompletely against trigger War warnings\nthere's some evidence that they're a\nlittle bit harmful but let's just\nunderstand this okay so what goes on\nwith a trigger warning what goes on with\na trigger warning is you say something\nthat makes me feel a particular way\nwe're not saying talk talk about hate\nspeech or anything but you say something\noh my God you were talking about\nexercising and that triggers my trauma\nabout when I last went to the gym so in\nthis situation what is this person doing\nthey're saying that you should stop\ndoing what you're doing to try to\ncontrol my internal emotional state the\nworst problem here is that we are\nsurrendering the power of our internal\nemotional state to other people but at\nthe end of the day all of these are\nemotion focused coping and the purpose\nof emotion focused coping is to fix\nthe emotions that are caused by problems\nso what happens when we use emotion\nfocused coping at the best nothing\nchanges right because I'm managing my\nemotions but I'm not solving the\nproblems that actually create them and\nat the worst when I engage in Emotion\nfocused coping it actually impairs me\nwhen I try to solve my problems I'm more\nhung over now it's been a week since\nI've studied and I forgot something so\neven though I've sort of delayed by\nseven days I'm actually forgetting\nsomething each one of those days and so\nwhat we sort of know of the science of\nemotion focused coping is that people\nwho rely on it tend to do poorly so if\nwe don't want to do emotion focused\ncoping what's the other option so now we\nmove to standard copium in standard\ncopium the most common example of this\nis something like problem solving so as\nwe already said you know I have a couple\nways of dealing with my problems one is\nthat I can try to manage my emotions and\nnot actually deal with the problem and\nthe second is I can actually deal with\nthe problem and the cool thing is when\nwe focus on problem solving is a coping\nmechanism the data shows that we tend to\ndo better right no surprise that people\nwho fix their problems tend to do better\nin life so here I am telling you oh just\ngo problem solve and just fix your\nproblems and this is where we run into a\nreally important problem with problem\nsolving which is if you are listening to\nthis video right now you've already\nfigured it out which is that you can't\nsolve all your problems right because\nhey the world is going to hell\neverything is screwed up climate change\nand inflation all the other crap that I\nsaid I haven't been able to go on a date\nin 2 years I've never had a girlfriend\nall the men I I date are toxic and all\nthese kinds of problems exist out there\nand these are unsolvable problems and so\nthen what do we do we decide to give up\nso this is the other problem with\nproblem solving is if the Mind cannot\nclearly see a path to problem solve we\nwill go ahead and give up and that is\nexactly the wrong thing to do because as\nit turns out trying to solve unsolvable\nproblems is one of the most useful\nthings you can do this may sound insane\nbut hear me out so I'm going to tell you\nall the story so when I was an intern I\nhad a patient who had stage four\nmetastatic liver cancer so this means\nthat they had cancer of the liver and it\nhad spread all throughout their body so\nthis person was going to die and his\nfamily would come in every day and they\nwould be freaking out we'd sort of\nexplain to this person and his family\nwhat the diagnosis is you've got maybe\nabout a month to live right that's like\nit's like one of these bad scenarios and\nthe family was like they since he's got\nliver cancer so the liver is like up\nhere and then it presses on the stomach\nit's it metastasizes so it's all in his\nabdomen and it's his intestines and\nstomach and stuff like that so what is\nhe doing he's not eating and then the\nfamily gets really really bent out of\nshape about this they're like oh my god\nhe has to keep his strength up he's not\neating anything you got to get him to\neat like we're trying to get him to eat\nhe needs to eat he needs to eat needs to\nkeep his strength up and I'm sitting\nthere in the back and I'm kind of\nthinking like bro what are y'all talking\nabout like he doesn't strength ain't\ngoing to make a difference the guy is\nlike terminally ill with cancer like\nthis isn't going to work and so this was\nback when I was an intern right so this\nwas before I became a psychiatrist and I\nrealiz I didn't realize at the time that\nwe're missing out on something really\nreally important which is that when we\ntry to problem solve there are two\nmechanisms actually at play one is we\nare trying to solve the problem and if\nwe can fix our external circumstances\nthen we will sort of get better right\nright our lives will get better\nobjectively because we fix something but\nthere's a second aspect to problem\nsolving which is incredibly important\nand has nothing to do with with whether\nthe problem gets solved or not and that\nis the mental aspect of problem solving\nso in the case of this family what they\nwere doing is doing anything they could\nand the cool thing about that is that\nanything that they can do even if it's\ncompletely irrelevant in the long run\nchanges their psychology so if we look\nat in the face of unsolvable problems\nthere are two options one is we can try\nto do something futile and then at least\nwe're giving it you know we're trying\nsomething we're giving it some effort\nthat we've got or what we can do is give\nup and now this is the beautiful thing\nwhen it comes to long-term outcomes and\npeople who use coping mechanisms and\nstuff like that there's one big\ndifference that people who try do way\nbetter than people who give up and so\nthe other really bizarre thing is that\nfrequently when we give up we also have\na cognitive bias at Play and our mind\ntells us there is no point in trying\nbecause we are doomed to failure but\nthat isn't objectively correct\nespecially if you look at something like\ndating or whatever there there's so many\npeople that I've talked to who have said\nyeah this is objectively hopeless\neverything is a mess look at all this\nevidence that I have from the internet\nand people talking on the internet and\npeople posting things on shorts and\nTwitter or X or whatever it is nowadays\nand look at all of this evidence and I\nhave my own experience of trying to go\non dates three or four times and\neveryone says right cuz let's remember\nthat the internet is scientific research\nthose two are absolutely\ninterchangeable when we're sort of faced\nin that situation we tend to give up and\nso I know it sounds crazy but even in\nthe face of unsolvable problems I\nstrongly encourage you to give it a shot\nand don't worry about your mind telling\nyou this will never work that's not what\nwe're actually shooting for when we're\ntrying to solve an unsolvable problem\nthe goal is not to actually solve the\nproblem but there's a decent chance\nyou'll make an impact of some kind the\ngoal is mentally to not give up the goal\nis to mentally understand that if you\ncan put forth some effort even if it's\nfutile it changes the equation of mental\nburnout in your mind so this is kind of\nwhat copium is all about we absolutely\nwant to try to solve our problems but\neven in the face of unsolvable problems\nyou should still give it a shot because\nhuman beings at the end of the day when\nthey do something they feel like they're\ndoing something right so people will\nkind of say oh you know I prayed to\nwhoever right I prayed to God and\nbecause I prayed to God this person's\nlife was saved and I'm not trying to\ndock on prayer or say God exists or\ndoesn't exist or anything like that I'm\njust pointing out that the psychology of\ndoing something makes people feel like a\nlittle bit more responsible and take a\nlittle bit more credit if things are\nmoving in the right direction so we\nabsolutely want to give things a shot\nand then we move to the top tier of\ncoping mechanisms which is what I would\ndub hopium which is the super cool\nbecause the top tier of coping\nmechanisms that leads to the best\noutcomes in life actually involves doing\nabsolutely nothing and this tier of\ncoping mechanism is called cognitive\nreframing cognitive reframing is\nliterally changing the way that you\nthink about things and I know it sounds\ninsane but I've worked with a lot of\npeople who are like degenerate Gamers\nand a lot of people who are super\nsuccessful like CEOs and like streamers\nand stuff like that and what I've the\nreally bizarre thing is that I don't\nthink that there's a big difference\nbetween these two groups of people hell\nin my life the big difference like I was\nthe same person I was like 15 years ago\nas to now what really changed my IQ\ndidn't change it's not like my\nconscientiousness magically increased\nwhat changed was the way that I think\nabout things which is technically doing\nnothing and so cognitive reframing is\none of the most important tools that you\ncan actually harness so let's understand\nthis a little bit B better okay so you\ncan take two different people who\nencounter the same scenario let's say\nthey go through a breakup and literally\nwe've done scientific studies on the way\nthat people respond to breakups and what\nwe found is that the way that they think\ndetermines their outcomes over time so\nif I break if I break up with someone I\ncan think to myself oh my God I'm\nunlovable and I will be alone for the\nrest of my life and this person is going\nto do so much better without me and\nthere's no hope for me right so we went\nthrough a breakup they dumped me didn't\ndump me whatever you can pick whatever\nscenario you want on the flip side we\nhave people who are good at cognitive\nreframing and these people literally\ntake their initial thoughts and try to\nmove them in a different direction and\nyou can even acknowledge the negativity\nwow I got dumped that means that you\nknow I'm really not in a good place\nright now I really have a lot of work to\ndo if I want to become a healthy person\nwho can engage in a healthy relationship\neven even though this relationship fell\napart at the least I learned a lot from\nit and I will be better prepared to\nengage in future relationships so this\nis literally what cognitive reframing is\nand this is what we do in Psychotherapy\nis that we take people's default\nthoughts and what we actually try to\nhelp them do is reframe to more helpful\nthoughts and so it's not enough that I\njust tell y'all hey just start thinking\ndifferently bruh so there's a a\nparticular process that I'm going to\nwalk youall through like a you know a\nquick rundown of how to cognitively\nreframe hey just a quick note a lot of\npeople will ask us what do I do next and\nthat's why we built Dr K's guide It's a\ncomprehensive resource that distills\nover 20 years of my experience both as a\nmonk and as a psychiatrist and it's\ndesigned in a way that's tailored to fit\nyour needs so if you're interested in\nbetter understanding your mind and\ntaking control of your life check out\nthe link below so the first thing to do\nif you want to C cognitively reframe is\nyou want to write down whatever your\ninitial thoughts are so you're going to\nhave all of these kinds of like negative\nthoughts that kind of come out and just\nwrite them down right and then ask\nyourself this kind of a dgen technique\nokay ask yourself if you were a\ndifferent human being if you were a more\nresilient human being if you were a\nbetter human being if you were one of\nlike one of those people who's like good\nat life right instead of you what would\nthey think about the situation you know\nthose dumb asses that are trying to\nencourage you and get you back up and\nstuff like that they're like oh man like\nthink about the big picture like what\nwould they say and what you're going to\nfind is that there is an instinctive\nrevulsion to that second column what\nyou're going to find is as you write\nthings down your mind will naturally\nreact by countering those kinds of\nthings but here's the crazy thing just\nbecause your mind has a reaction doesn't\nmean that it's true and so then what you\nwant to do is notice that third reaction\nright which is the conflict between\ncolumn 1 and column two just how do you\nfeel when you're trying to write down\nthe second column and write those things\ndown this is absurd this doesn't work\nfor me this works for other people but\nis not going to apply in my case you're\ngoing to recognize all these kinds of\nthoughts and just jot them down then\ntake a deep breath and just ask yourself\nout of the second column which is the\nhopeful column right which is the\ncognitive reframe column which of these\nthings because you can't accept all of\nthem but is there a single one that you\ncan somewhat sort of accept right so you\ntake these five things in which one is\nthe least offensive is the least\nIncorrect and just circle that one and\njust spend a little bit of time thinking\nabout it and then ask yourself okay why\ncan I accept this one after you pick\nyour one just ask yourself okay what is\nit about this one that makes it okay\nwell at the end of the day like I know\ntechnically any breakup that I go\nthrough I will have learned something\nI'll have gotten better at breaking up\nI'm managing my emotions it's like\npushing me to do a little bit better and\nthis way and this way and this way and\nso Something Beautiful happens the\nsecond you start doing doing that is\nthat you have actually cognitively\nreframed you've literally rewired your\nneurons a little bit because what we\nknow about thinking is that thinking\nhappens in patterns so anytime you see a\nparticular thing your mind will evoke\nthe same thoughts right so like in my\ncase you know like I was just thinking\nabout one of my kids and one of my kids\ndoesn't like Mayo so the first question\nshe asks anytime she sees a sandwich is\nis there Mayo on it every time there's a\nsandwich it triggers some kind of\nresponse and in my case it's like\nwhenever I eat something sweet I'm like\nwow I like this it's not too sweet so\nyou may have noticed that you say the\nsame damn [ __ ] over and over and over\nagain or people that you know say the\nsame damn [ __ ] over and over and over\nagain and that's because our neurons\nhave been well-wired in that way so if\nwe want to start thinking differently\nliterally what we have to do is push\nthis up this Boulder uphill of positive\nthoughts and it will feel very very\ncumbersome when we first do it the\nbeautiful thing is that if you engage in\nthis cognitively reframing technique\nover and over and over again your mind\nmind will literally start to change the\nnatural responses that you have when you\nget a setback will be a little bit\ndifferent you'll be able to look on the\nbrighter side of things and once you're\nable to look on the brighter side of\nthings that's the first Domino because\nnow you're not in despair now you're not\nburnt out now you're not giving up at\nthe first setback and even if we sort of\nthink about these terms what is the\ndifference between giving up in a\nsetback it's just whether you keep going\nor not right a setback which is your\nlast setback is when you give up but if\nyou don't give up after a setback it\nautomatically becomes a setback and so\nthen the question you need to ask\nyourself is what do you want your life\nto be do you want to be a person who\ngives up or has setbacks and that's the\nbig difference between a dgen gamer and\na CEO one of them gives up and one of\nthem has\nsetbacks so I know it sounds kind of\ncrazy but it turns out that a lot of\nwhat we do when we are faced with\nproblems actually creates more problems\nthis is why doing nothing is actually\neverything but there are different kinds\nof nothing and the most important\nnothing that you can do is the nothing\nup here the interesting thing is if you\nreally pay attention most of y'all when\nyou say I do nothing you're not actually\ndoing nothing you're doing something\nright I have a test at the end of the\nweek are you literally doing nothing no\nyou start doing crap you start doing\ndumb crap right you start watching TV or\nyou're on YouTube right now\nprocrastinating from doing the work that\nyou're doing by watching this [ __ ]\nvideo this is not doing nothing you are\ndoing something you are watching me\nright now and that's the crazy thing is\nthat what we sort of found is that\npeople who focus on doing something that\nmakes them feel better mopi or emotion\nFocus coping or even problem solving are\nnot as Chad or Stacy as people who\nactually do a little bit less or do way\nless but do that Less in a very\nparticular way which is cognitively\nreframing and not giving up this is\nnormally the part of the video where I\nwould say now go out and do something\nbut actually maybe you should do\n[Music]\nnothing"
