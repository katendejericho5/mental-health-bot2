righty chat let's get\nstarted welcome to another healthy gamer\nGG stream my name is Dr Alo kenoa just a\nreminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discussed on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purpose bu\nonly if y'all have a concern or question\nplease go see a licensed\nprofessional so welcome y'all to the\nlast stream of the year so this is our\nlast healthy gamer stream that is\nofficial anyway sometimes I sometimes\nshow up in randomly I'll stream video\ngames and stuff if I'm taking a break\nover the holidays but this is our last\nstream of the year so we uh really have\nbeen grateful to all of your\nparticipation through all of 2023 we\nhope that we've been able to help youall\nsupport you all hopefully all learned a\nlot hopefully y all had some fun during\nthe\nprocess um yeah so thank youall very\nmuch so today we're going to be talking\nabout asexuality so we're going to do a\ndeep dive into asexuality so what does\nthat mean so we're going to sort of take\nthis concept of asexuality and I'm going\nto kind of give you all my take on it so\num it's not just like my opinion so\nwe're going to talk about a lot of\nscience a lot of clinical medicine a lot\nof Neuroscience psychology um even a\nlittle bit of like culture and history\nso that we can understand like this\nconcept of\nasexuality uh another thing before we\ndive into that I we just want to say\nthat we we really appreciate everybody's\nfeedback about the commercialization of\nhealthy gamer if y'all if this has been\na concern for yall we strongly recommend\nyou check out we did like basically a\ntwo-hour stream with me and gruy where\nwe\nexplained um our perspective on like how\nwe think about money and HG so yall can\ncheck that out uh I think there's a VOD\nof it um I don't know if it's still\nliving on twitch or if it's on YouTube\nor what what platform it's living on now\nbecause twitch fods tend to get deleted\nbut if that's something that yall are\nsuper curious about um we absolutely\nincorporate all of your feedback we\nreally pay attention to it and one of\nthe big things that we had sort of heard\nfrom people is that you know we don't do\nlike deep dive kind of content anymore\nand so this is in line with that um just\nso you all understand Deep dive content\ntakes like a long time to do so it was\neasier for me to make this stuff at the\nbeginning when I already had like a bank\nof stuff in my head so a lot of things\nthat I was sort of like a not an expert\nin I mean but things that I felt very\ncomfortable teaching for a couple of\nhours about and as we're sort of\ndeveloping like exploration of of newer\ntopics things that I have less clinical\nexperience in it takes a little bit more\ntime to prepare um so the the Deep dive\nthat we're going to be talking about\ntoday probably took somewhere between 20\nand 30 hours of like preparation to put\ntogether um so we we really appreciate\neverybody's feedback we're we're going\nto try to give everybody what they want\nthe challenges that different people\nwant different things so we're going to\ndo our best to\naccommodate uh and yeah so so happy\nholidays everybody and let's dive\nin um not running out of content there's\ntons of content to make it's just we're\nlike ranking up right so as we start to\nget into different stuff it becomes a\nlittle\nbit it just requires more work so I'm\nnot like an expert in asexuality so that\nrequires more work okay so today we are\ngoing to talk about oh is chat work not\nwork let's\nsee there we go let's see if chat works\nall right there we go all right so today\nwe're going to be talking about\nasexuality and my hope today is to give\nyou all a perspective of asexuality that\nwill do a couple of different things\nfirst of all understand like the\nhistory of\nasexuality and then we're going to\nunderstand a little bit about the\nepidemiology of\nasexuality then we're going to dive into\nsort of a neuroscience\nperspective on sexuality so how do we\nfeel like when we're like sexual\ncreatures what's going on in our brain\nand once we understand the core\nNeuroscience behind a sexuality we can\nstart to get into what I would call kind\nof the differential\ndiagnosis of not feeling\nsexual and what we'll discover is that\nif you don't feel\nsexual um there's many reason potential\nreasons for that and those include\nthings like a uh probably a\nnormal sexual\nvariant right that is not pathologic\nanyway it's not an illness or anything\nlike that and then there are also\npathologies so these are things that are\nbasically like wrong with us some kind\nof diagnosable thing where whether it be\na hormone imbalance or or something like\nthat um that lead to a lack of sexual\ndesire and then we also once we kind of\nget through some of that we're going to\nsort of dive into features of\nasexuality\nand then what we're going to do is\nexplore a little bit more about sort of\nthe\npathologies of\nasexuality and then we may sort of end\noff a little bit uh I may stick this\nstuff a little bit earlier maybe even\nsomewhere around here but um talking a\nlittle bit about\nLexia and then at the end we're going to\ntalk about\nAlexia and autism spectrum specifically\nand its connection and potentially\nschizoid personality types and\nasexuality okay so the goal here is\nto I'm sort of envisioning a couple of\ndifferent audiences the first is like if\nyou're a parent of a child who says hey\nMom Dad I'm asexual like how do you\nunderstand that how should you approach\nthat on the flip side if you're someone\nwho's been wondering whether you're\nasexual my hope is to educate you a\nlittle bit on all of this stuff right so\nwhat does it mean to be asexual what are\nthe different causes how what's going on\nin the brain are you ill are you not ill\nis it a normal variant to help youall do\nthrough uh get through that and then\nespecially this piece may be kind of\ninteresting because we know a fair\namount\nabout the features of asexuality so like\nwhat happens what so like there's a lot\nof details that we'll kind of kind of\nkind of get into that will hopefully be\nsubjectively relatable for yall so what\nthat sort of means is like I don't know\nif I'm asexual or not so what are some\nof the features of of people who are\nasexual so for\nexample people who are asexual are much\nmore likely to be attracted to and\nfantasize about fictional characters\nright it's just something like it's\nthat's a little bit unusual we'll get to\nwhy that is there's a really fascinating\nthing so if you're the kind of person\nwho's like man I I watch a bunch of\nanime and like I'm not interested in\nanyone in my real life but man I'm\ntotally in love with this anime\ncharacter that's how consistent with\nasexuality a feature of asexuality okay\nso so we'll get to that I know so that's\nwhy like a lot of stuff and my hope with\nall of these lectures is to educate\ny'all and then once we sort of educate\nyou we'll sort of get a a little bit\ninto what next steps may be for like but\njust learn a little bit about yourself\nokay um I I know calling us out it's\nit's chill chill chill okay now\nhopefully we're going to cover this in\nabout two hours okay but maybe it'll be\na little bit faster maybe a little bit\nshorter so let's start off with the\nhistory of\nasexuality all right so this is where\nthings get kind of\ninteresting okay I'm going to just go\nback to this for a\nsecond so let's just talk about the\nhistory of\nasexuality it's okay all right so first\nthing is that the term asexuality has\nnothing to do with human sexual behavior\nwhen it was first coined asexuality was\noriginally designed as a term to\ndescribe microorganisms so there are\ndifferent kinds of bacteria and like\nsome of them will like reproduce without\nsexual contact with like another\nbacteria so if you all studied like you\nknow cell biology and and sort of\nmicrobiology you'll remember that there\nare some kinds of bacteria that will\nhave things called f plasmids so this is\nlike this DNA transfer that one bacteria\ndoes to another bacteria IIA and then\nlike the F plasmid has all this\nMachinery that allows you to transfer\nmaterial from one bacteria to another\nthe interesting thing is that once you\ntransfer the the F plasmid then the\nsecond bacteria will have the ability to\ntransfer it to something else to a\ndifferent bacteria so originally\nasexuality had nothing to do with human\nbeings it was just all about sort of\nunderstanding\nmicrobiology and then if we sort of look\nat it though there's actually a fair\namount of evidence that asexuality\nexists in the animal kingdom and this is\nwhen we're now talking about a sexual\nvariant so for example some studies show\nthat 12.5% of rams are asexual so these\nare\nmale Rams right so variant of a goat or\na sheep or something I I don't know what\nthe a ram and a u i know the the\npositive I don't know what this the\nspecies is they they seem to have like\nno interest in sexual activity so what\nwhat biologists did and this these are\nfascinating papers to read by the way so\njust to tell you all like a interesting\nstory so there's some really old papers\non biology of of animal sexuality that\nare just stunning to believe so one of\nmy favorites was they were also looking\nat Rams for some reason biologists\nreally like to study Rams and their\nsexual behavior who knows\nwhy but there was so there were a group\nof biologists who are describing sexual\nbehavior of rams and what they noticed\nis that there are some Rams who like\nengaging in sex with other Rams so these\nare both males right so they both have\nbig horns but one of them mounts the the\none male Ram the all male if we use the\nword Ram mounts another RAM and then the\nbiologists are looking at this and their\nhypothesizing they're trying to figure\nout what's going on here and they're\nlike oh we know what's going on this is\nlike back in the 50s or 60s they're like\noh like this Ram is confused right so\nthe the ram who's doing the mounting\ndoesn't understand that he's mounting\nanother male that he's actually like he\nthinks it's a female and then all the\nbiologists are like Ah that's it right\nthe Rams the ram is just confused he\ndoesn't know what he's doing I don't\nknow how it got in there and then\nsomeone asked the question they're like\nokay but what about the ram who's being\nmounted right what about the the bottom\nas it were what's going on with that RAM\nand then they were like I don't know\nmaybe he's confused too so some of these\nearly like biological explorations of\nsexuality are absolute a delight to read\nso when we were looking at the the\nbehavior of animals we've sort of\ndiscovered that in some populations\nwe'll sort of study populations and up\nto 12.5% of rams are\nasexual um which means that they just\nseem to have no interest in engaging in\nsexual\nactivity so then we also know from like\nthe history of humanity that it seems\nlike asexuality in some form has been\npresent in humanity and very well\ndocumented for like hundreds if not\nthousands of years so good examples of\nthis are you know there's like there\nthere there are these concepts of like\nyou know um lifelong Bachelors or\nspinsters or even people who will like\njoin religious organizations and are\ncelibate so like if you look at like\nsort of the dialogue of religious\norganizations and how they view celibacy\nthey'll sort of say like celibacy is\nlike a struggle right like oh my God\nlike you have all these sexual desires\nand you have to like conquer your sexual\ndesires to be closer to God but if you\nlook at a lot of like the writings about\na lot of these like monks and stuff it\ndidn't seem like they ever struggled\nthey just weren't very sexual to begin\nwith and they were like totally fine\nwith that so if you look at the history\nof humanity we absolutely have like a\nsubset of the human population that from\nbasically as long as we have recorded\nhistory has not been very interested in\nsexual activity now we don't know\nprecisely how horny they were right but\nit seems like the more that you kind of\nlook into it there's clearly been a\nsubset of the population that has not\nbeen engaging in sexual behavior now\nwe'll call that celibacy which is the\nvoluntary abstinence of sexual behavior\nbut if you really like look at some of\nthese writings and stuff like that it\nseems like the voluntary part wasn't\nvery hard for many people so many of\nthese like monks and stuff just weren't\ntoo interested in sex to begin with\nnever really interested in them they\nwere just like yeah it's just not\nsomething I'm interested in so it seems\nlike asexuality has been you know\noriginally a biological term but there\nseems to be evidence of of something of\na normal variant we're not sure if it's\nnormal or not it could be pathological\nright but we sort of know that it's been\naround for a long time so that's kind of\na quick rundown of the history now let's\ntalk a little bit\nabout oh whoops the\nepidemiology okay so key takeaways 12\n.5% of rams are asexual based on one\nstudy right so there seems to be\nhistory of low sex\ndrive human beings and we'll talk a\nlittle bit more about what we mean by\nasexuality now actually okay\nmonks uh lifelong\nbachelor\nspinster right so those are like kind of\ngender\nterms but now let's talk a little bit\nabout okay what do we mean by\nasexuality so we're talking about\nasexuality what we generally mean is a\nlack of sexual\nattraction or interest so these are\nbasically people who are not interested\nin sex or interested in in\nsexual stuff they like they don't get\nturned on kind of psychologically okay\nthere's some really interesting studies\nwe'll get to this in more detail but\nthere are studies that show that\nphysiologic responses for people who are\na asexual can be actually quite normal\nso there's one study for example that\nwas looking that had women watch erotic\nfilms and what they did is sort of\nmeasure the level of like arousal based\non the erotic film and what they found\nis that these women who were asexual\ndidn't have any sort of mental arousal\nbut if you do photoplethysmography of\nthe vagina so this is like measuring the\nphysiologic response in the vagina what\nyou found is that there's a normal\nvaginal response so the body seems to be\nresponding appropriately to the erotic\nfilm or what we would expect from normal\npeople but it really seems to be a lack\nof attraction or interest so it's not\nquite physiological in nature it seems\nto be a little bit more mental in nature\nand even if we look at other variants of\nsexuality most of the way that we Define\na sexuality is like what turns you\non right so if you get turned on by the\nopposite gender we call you heterosexual\nif you get turned on by the same gender\nwe call you homosexual if you get turned\non by both genders or all genders we can\ncall you bisexual pansexual whatever\nwhat turns you\non okay and even as a psychiatrist\nlike um when I'm assessing people's\nsexuality this is kind of the route that\nI'll go right so like I don't ask that\nquestion because that sounds weird right\nso so I I won't say like oh what turn\nyou on like I won't say that to a\npatient but I will ask them you know\nlike when you fantasize or when you\nmasturbate like what kinds of things do\nyou think about so what are the things\nthat you find sexually arousing so those\nkinds of questions we can ask just to\nhelp people figure out what their\nsexuality\nis\nnow um so let let's talk a little bit\nabout like how common this is so about 1\nto 3% of the population is probably\nasexual this is based on various studies\nnow now we got to talk for a second\nabout epidemiology and and studies for a\nsecond so we suspect that somewhere\naround 1 to 3% of people are are asexual\nokay and the first thing that we've got\nto understand about research around\nasexuality so let's talk about\nresearch is that the research on\nasexuality\nsucks\nbluntly we've done very very little\nresearch the majority of papers on\nasexuality are published in four\njournals so it's not like a widely\nstudied topic and then the M also like\nthere's a ton of research that is like\nbasically scanning the internet so a lot\nof these studies on asexuality are not\nlike actually laboratory studies are not\neven things where you're talking to\nhuman beings or even surveying human\nbeings a lot of the research on\nasexuality comes from\nresearchers scanning discussions on the\ninternet and like pulling out themes and\nstuff of how asexual people feel I know\nwe were joking about being a weeb\nearlier but I suspect this is how we\nkind of got there right because our\nsource of information is not we're not\ndoing some kind of objective research\nwhere we're sitting down and asking\nsomeone a ton of questions about what\nturns them on or measuring things or\nanything like that we're just scanning\nparts of the internet and then we're\nsort of like synthesizing that into\nresearch so our research is actually\nquite low quality this is also because\nof problems like when we do these big\nstudies so we have some very large\nstudies that we kind of do where we\nmeasure all kinds of crap right so these\nare like the study of adult human\ndevelopment which is the longest study\nuh longest running study that's run at\nhar run by this guy named Bob waldinger\nfantastic dude who was once a mentor of\nmine um and so in all these standardized\nstudies like we ask all kinds of things\nbut we don't usually ask people if\nthey're asexual so this is starting to\nchange now with the way that we sort of\nask people how they identify but the\nproblem is that our research\ninfrastructure has not been sort of\ngeared to pick up or measure asexuality\nand furthermore a lot of our research on\non when we actually do talk to people is\nlike very small sample size and things\nlike that okay so 1 to 3% and it seems\nlike the key feature is a lack of sexual\nattraction or interest okay um a couple\nof other things to understand about\nasexuality is that it doesn't seem to be\nclearly associated with depression and\nanxiety so for some time people were\nwondering okay what is asexuality is it\nbasically like we used to think it was a\npathology right so then people thought\nokay like if it's a pathology it must be\ncorrelated with depression or anxiety\nand then there's some studies that show\ncorrelations other studies that don't\nshow correlations so I'm going to go\nahead and say that there's not a clear\nlink to depression or anxiety and even\nso the the links to depression seem to\nbe more associated with the social\nstigma of\nasexuality so there's one study for\nexample where we we asked normal people\neverybody what do you think about people\nwho have these various sexual natur so\nlike what do you think about homosexuals\nheterosexuals whatever and and the\ninteresting thing in that study is that\npeople felt that asexual human beings\nwere the least human so like this is the\nkind of thing if we're talking about\nokay like even gay people or B people or\nlesbians or whatever they're at least\nlike horny and it turns some them on\nthey they're filled with lust for a\nparticular thing just the object of the\nlust is different so if you kind of ask\nthe average person what makes people you\nknow the most alien it's having asexual\nuality so people have a lot of\ndifficulty understanding the asexuality\nof other human beings because at least\nyou can relate to someone if you're\nheterosexual or homosexual you can\nunderstand that okay like I get horny\nbecause of this you get horny because of\nthis but at least we both like the the\nhorniness is there that's a core feature\nof being a human being so when you take\naway the horniness when you take away\nthe lust it makes people like really\nreally hard like they sort of don't\nunderstand that at all we'll get more to\nmore about social stigma later okay so\nas we're sort of like looking at this\nkind of stuff re researchers basically\nsat down and started to think a little\nbit about okay like what are the causes\nof asexuality so if someone does not\nhave sexual desire if there is a lack of\nInterest what are the potential causes\nof that and this is where there's all\nkinds of stuff that is associated with\nlow sexual interest so now we're going\nto run through a quick differential\ndiagnosis I don't think this is going to\ntake two hours I think we're going to\nblow through it man I prepped really\nwell\nso the first is that is a normal\nvariant okay so this is like some people\nare just asexual like the Rams okay but\nthen we also know there's all kinds of\npathologies that relate to low sexual\ninterest so one\nis hsid D which\nis\nhyposexual\ninterest desire\ndisorder okay and there's actually a\nfemale variant and a male variant that\nare a little bit different we'll talk a\nlittle bit more about this if yall want\nto but the big thing that separates\nhyposexual interest desire disorder is\nthat in the case of an asexual person or\nsomeone who has\nhsid they both lack the interest to have\nsex they both both lack an lack the\nability to be aroused and things like\nthat there's a huge difference\nthese people are okay with it and these\npeople are distressed by\nit so if you find yourself to be worried\nand be like I don't want to lack arousal\nI I don't like this I want to be more\naroused so if you look at studies for\nexample people with hsid are more likely\nto have romantic\nPartners so they're more likely to be in\nrelationships right and so it causes\nproblems in the relationship and the\nperson thems is unhappy so that this is\nthe big difference if you're okay with\nyour lack of sexual interest it's more\nlikely that you're asexual if you are um\nnot okay with your lack of sexual\ninterest then you're more likely to be\ndown this road and even one of the\nexclusion criteria of\nhsid is hyposexual interest desire\ndisorder is being asexual so if you're\nasexual you can't be diagnosed with hsid\nor I mean there's some Nuance there but\nthat's like one of the key things to\nunderstand okay so even before we get to\nthe rest of the stuff we'll get to the\nrest of the stuff but like this's a big\ndifference so does it bother you or does\nit not bother you if it doesn't bother\nyou then you're asexual it's probably a\nnormal variant we'll get to that in a\nsecond so there are also other things\nthat like kind of may make you lack\ninterest in sexual activity another one\nis\ncelibacy right so this is a case where\nit's not that you lack interest but that\nyou are voluntarily trying to sublimate\nor reduce your\ninterest you're just choosing not to\nengage in sexual activity and hopefully\nover time you stop being sexually\naroused okay but then there are also\nother kinds of causes for a lack of\nsexual interest so if we so some people\nhypothesize that oh the reason that\npeople are asexual is because they've\nbeen\ntraumatized and Trauma is on the\ndifferential for someone who does not is\nnot interested in in sexuality but this\nalso looks a little bit different this\nusually has to do with fear of\nintimacy or this has to do with like\nadverse physiologic\nreactions right so like for example if I\nif I have a history of like sexual\ntrauma then when I start to engage in a\nsexual act or I start to feel aroused my\nbody will also activate danger signals\nbecause my body has sort of figured out\nthat things go together right so neurons\nthat fire together wire together so this\nis why like Pavlov sort of discovered\nthis with his dogs where he rang the\nbell and then he fed the dogs food and\nso the the neurons that detect the\nBell fire around the same time that the\nthe dog gets fed so these two neurons\nthen start activating together and all\nPavlov had to do is ring the bell to\ncause his dogs to salivate in the same\nway we can develop traumatic responses\nthis is what we can call\ntriggers okay and so these triggers can\nbe pretty specific to the person in the\nexperience so like anytime I get\nsexually aroused I can start to also\nfeel Panic so let's say I was sexually\nabused by one of my parents and so any\nkind of sexual touch also comes with\nsome kind of pain and so my brain\nAssociates these two things together and\nso like this causes problems so there\ncan be other kind of trauma it doesn't\nhave to be sexual trauma so there you\ncan just fear Intimacy in general and\nconnection with another person and being\nvulnerable we'll get to a little bit of\nthat when we get into the Neuroscience\nbut there is absolutely a variant of a\nlack of sexual interest which probably\nhas something to do with\ntrauma then we also know that there are\nhormonal\nchanges that correlate with a lack of\nsexual interest so low\ntestosterone in both men and women by\nthe\nway we also know that high levels of\nprolactin also in both men and women are\nassociated with decreases in sexual\narousal so we know that there's like all\nkinds of different stuff hormonal\nimbalances even like thyroid changes and\nstuff like that can correlate with like\na lack of sexual interest so the first\ntakeaway for\ny'all is if you feel a lack of sexual\ninterest it may not be that you are\nasexual it may be that one of these\nthings is going on too well this one you\nprobably know because you figured that\npart out so this is why like I wouldn't\njump to a conclusion and that's kind of\nthe point of this is for to for yall to\nunderstand that there's like a variety\nof different things going on and we're\ngoing to talk through them a little bit\nokay but one of the key things that\nbasically happened in the research on\nasexuality is that as we looked at these\nthings what essentially happened is\npeople discovered that if you take all\nof this\nstuff this does not\nexplain or account\nfor all lack of sexual\ndesire so what basically they did is\nthey took people who are asexual didn't\nhave any sexual interest and they\nassessed them for each of these things\nand what they sort of found is oh\nactually like 1 to 3% of the population\nhas none of this stuff going on so it\nmay just be a normal sexual variant\nright and then they looked at like\nresearch on Rams and whatnot and they\nsaw okay this happens in the animal\nkingdom too all right this is kind of a\nquick differential of like how to think\nabout\num sort of feeling asexual or having a\nlack of interest in in sexuality so now\nthat we sort of know okay it appears\nthat one to 3% of people is not a\nvoluntary choice and do not have\nanything physiologically wrong with them\nas far as we know that means that there\nis a variant that is asexual so let's\ntalk about\nfeatures of\nasexuality okay so what do we\nknow about people who are asexual and\nthis is where things get interesting\nthen we'll get to the Neuroscience\nactually let me think for a\nsecond okay before we get to\nthis let's let's I'm going to change the\norder of\nsomething\nokay first what we're going to talk\nabout is is\nnormal\nsexuality\nNeuroscience\nokay so the next thing that we have to\ndo before we sort of understand\nasexuality is we have to understand what\nis the default functioning of like\nsexuality in a human being so where does\nsexuality come from like what parts of\nthe brain are involved how do these\ndifferent things work and I'd love to\nkind of just walk youall through some of\nthis stuff okay so like hopefully this\nlike helps yall understand just even if\nyou're not asexual like if I get aroused\nand I I lust for someone I like sex\nwhatever like how does that process work\nwhat is the process of sexual arousal\nand engagement in human beings\nokay so the first thing that we're going\nto start with is the\nthalamus so the thalamus is the\ngateway to the brain and what does that\nmean that means that we have the sense\norgans and they feed their input into\nthe thalamus right so we have it starts\nwith sensory\ninput okay so I see something that I may\nfind\narousing now the next thing that happens\nis that once we have the thalamus we\nalso have our limic\nsystem and amydala\nand so the thalamus sort of synthesizes\nthis sexual input this input and then\nstarts thinking about sex\nokay like oh like this person is naked\nand is string in front of me and like\nhe's talking in an accent and is like\nyou know like going like this like oh my\nGod like now we're we're talking and\nthey're dancing and oh my God this is\ngreat so it starts with sensory input\nnow as I give you guys the sensory input\nokay so like we'll just give you all an\nexample so like Dr K can go like this I\ncan go oh I got to move this over here\nhold on I can go like oh yeah come on\nlet's talk let's go baby so now yall are\ngetting sensory in point right but are\nyou aroused oh yeah let's go no you're\nnot aroused come on don't be ridiculous\nso if we understand like if you what\nyou're doing right now is you're like\nprobably laughing right because this is\nhilarious I'm not actually like I'm not\nhorny no you guys with the the way the\ntwitch meta is\nnowadays okay so if you really look at\nit what's happening like even though I'm\ndoing these kinds of things right so\nwhat's happening is you're actually\ngetting an emotional\nmodulation of the sensory\ninput so you you get an emotional\nmodulation so now emotions enter the\npicture okay and this this is governed\nby the lyic system and the amydala\nokay so then what happens is once we\nmodulate um the the input right so we\nhave an emotional reaction to it that'll\nmake us more aroused or less aroused so\nonce we become\naroused then it triggers other kinds of\nthings so then this arousal goes to the\nhypothalamus and now we're engaging the\nphysiology so now our body starts to\nrespond right so it starts with sensory\ninput plus emotions and then my body\nbegins to respond so maybe I'll get\nerect I'll start to get pyow\nretion this means our hair stands up on\nend I may start to get sweaty it sort of\nwe have this autonomic nervous system\nkind of response which is also really\ninteresting because the response in the\nautonomic nervous system it's one of the\nfew things that both engages the\nparasympathetic nervous system and the\nsympathetic nervous system so we engage\nboth kind of at the same time some parts\nbecome\num are activated by the parasympathetic\nnervous system so we'll just give you\nall a quick example of this so if we\nlook at penile erection\nso the erection itself is caused by the\nparasympathetic nervous system so when\nwe're relaxed if we're dudes we are\nlikely to get boners so this is\nsomething to understand it doesn't mean\nthat you're aroused arousal is not the\nonly thing that causes an erection\nrelaxation can cause an erection this is\nwhy you wake up in the morning with\nthings like morning wood but then what\nhappens is the process of\nejaculation is governed by the\nsympathetic nervous system so basically\nour body gets primed by our\nparasympathetic nervous system so we\nkind of get into this like relaxed\nchilling kind of vibing State and then\nwe launch into sympathetic nervous\nsystem activity as we engage in the\nsexual act this is all coordinated by\nthe hypothalamus\nokay um then there's a couple of other\nregions of the brain that are like\nreally really important so the first is\nthat depending on what happens after the\narousal\nbased on the ACT we will activate our\nnucleus\nsuccumbent which is our reward center of\nthe\nbrain right so if I engage in some kind\nof sexual act and I have an orgasm then\nI get a spurt of dopamine and then I'm\nreinforcing the behavior so then what\nhappens is the nucleus accumbens\nshapes our you know shapes our reward so\nthen what happens is if we engage in the\nsexual act this is going to feed\nback and go to the thalamus and tell it\nhey seeing these things is a sign that\ngood things are coming this is great we\nlove what we're seeing right here and it\nalso goes back to the lyic system in the\namydala and it's saying hey get excited\nbaby because this stuff is great right\nso this it kind of feeds back now this\nis also well we'll get\nto we'll get to problems in a second all\nright so there are a couple of other\nthings to keep in mind one is that um\nthe frontal\nloes generally speaking have an\ninhibitory effect on this whole process\nso the more our frontal loes are active\nthe less sexual we we want we don't want\nto engage in sexual behavior our\nrestraint towards sexuality comes from\nour frontal loes okay there are a couple\nof other things like we've got regions\nlike the SEPTA sepal region\ninsula that all are involved as well so\nthe insula for example is\nphysiologic\nfeedback so this is just a bit\ncomplicated but I'll just give you all\nan example of something that we're not\ncovering so as we start to get this kind\nof\nstuff this stuff then the erect penis\nthen sends signals back to the brain how\ndo you know you're erect right how do\nyou know you don't have to look at it\nyou can tell physiologically so these\nsignals then go back to the insula and\nthen the insul let the rest of your\nbrain know hey we're good to go all\nright so the septile region is just a\npart that modulates our sexual\ndrive based on all kinds of different\nstuff so there's like different kinds of\nstuff that basically will go and modify\noh\nboy go and will modify this either by\nstrengthening it or we weakening it okay\nso this is a rough idea of like how we\nhave\nsex so there's other parts of the brain\nthat are really important so we're just\ngoing to talk about our empathic\ncircuits of the\nbrain okay\num and this kind of relates\nto uh like the lyic system I'm going to\njust sort of take a circuit approach as\nopposed to an anatomical approach but\nbasically like our what the empathy that\nwe receive how connected we are with our\nprot potential partner will lead to\npluses or minuses okay so like if we're\nlike if we're vibing like I'm into you\nand you're into me like oh my God like\nthat's going to reinforce things right\nwhereas if if I'm into sex and you're\nnot into sex like there's no empathy\nthere's no connection there so I can\nstill feel lust but the experience is\ngoing to be a little bit different so\nfor those of youall that have had sexual\nrelationships where like you're into it\nand the partner isn't they can still\nhave sex with you because you know y'all\nare in a committed relationship and you\ndon't feel like it all the time they\ndon't feel like it all the time maybe\nyou don't feel like it but they feel\nlike it so you kind of kind of do your\nduty right so this is an example of like\nwhy it's different whereas like when\nwhen when I'm super into it and you're\nsuper into it the sexual act is a lot\nmore intense and why is that it's\nbecause the empathic circuits of the\nbrain are also giving us pluses so the\nmore pluses we\nget okay the more intense the sexual act\nwill be so this is a quick rundown of\nthe Neuroscience of of\nsex\num so now what happens is let's talk a\nlittle bit about what's different about\npeople who are\nasexual okay actually I'm going to pause\nfor a\nsecond um let's just does that do y'all\nhave any\nquestions okay I will do\nthat thanks Tech\nteller pause champ\nI will\ncheck okay so we are going to do this\nand we're going to disable chat okay we\nhave to disable chat sorry chat okay I'm\ngonna pause for a second let's ask\nquestions what if I think I'm asexual\nbut I'm not we're going to get to that\ngood this is all good does this apply to\nfemale sexuality too\nabsolutely okay my wife is asexual okay\nthis is good this is good this is good\ndoes love have any effect on it of\ncourse love has an effect on it we'll\nget to that we'll get to like a romantic\nand romantic and all that kind of stuff\nin a second but so so hopefully all\nunderstand so someone's asking does love\nhave an effect yes that's what we\npointed out right so that's why we're\ntalking about amydala lyic circuit uh\nsystem and empathy so not just love has\nan effect this is how it has an effect\nand this is kind of what I'm pointing\nout to youall hopefully you all you all\nare going to see this\nbut this is kind of like a a spoiler\nokay so if we look at the act of Sex and\nthe arousal of sex so remember first of\nall that asexuality is a is a feature of\narousal okay it's not necessarily a\nfeature of behavior or anything like\nthat so now what we can see is that as\nstart to knock out various of these\nthings so let's say that I I'm not in\nlove this is going to affect my sexual\narousal let's say that I have difficulty\nwith empathy this is going to affect my\nsexual arousal let's say that I watched\nporn a lot and that has [ __ ] up my\nnucleus succumbent that will affect my\nsexual arousal let's say that I'm used\nto masturbating in a particular way\neither with a vibrator or death grip or\nsomething like that that is going to\naffect my insula and the feedback that I\nget from my sexual organs that go to my\nbrain and drive me towards different\nkinds of of sexual pleasure or lack of\npleasure if we look at things like if my\nautonomic nervous system is out of whack\nlet's say I'm super stressed out and\nsince I'm stressed out my sympathetic\nnervous system is highly highly active\nright this is what happens when I get\nstressed my sympathetic my heart rate is\nis high my blood pressure is high and so\nthen what happens is even though\nsympathetic nervous system is involved\nin ejaculation the parasympathetic\nnervous system can never Prime us for\nthe sexual act so stress acts\nhere the last thing is that if my\nfrontal loes are highly active so if I'm\nlike trying to restrain myself let's say\nI'm celibate so big part of becoming\ncelibate is training the frontal loes so\nalready once we\nunderstand kind of the\nthe the sequence of sexuality we can see\nhow if we knock out any one of these\nregions or interfere with any one of\nthese regions that it will actually like\nresult in a decrease in sexual drive\nokay so there are a couple of other\nthings that we can talk a little bit\nabout just to give you all\nexamples there also hormonal\ninfluences so remember a hormone is a\nchemical signal that travels through\nyour blood to every part of your body\nand coordinates your whole body in a\nparticular mode so low\ntestosterone high levels of prolactin\nand then there are also things like um\nhigh levels of\nSerotonin so serotonin is our\nsatiety hormone so when we're content we\nhave high levels of\nSerotonin and so as we become more and\nmore content we become less and less\naroused okay\nso there other kind of global effects as\nwell now let's get to the features of\nasexuality so the first thing to\nunderstand about features of asexuality\nis that there's all kinds of like\ninteresting stuff so that doesn't that\ndoesn't mean anything so let's get to\nwhat's interesting so remember we're\ntalking about lack of\nInterest so now we're going to I'm going\nto kind of go through various research\nso there's one\nstudy that looked at\nvaginal\nphoto pla oh that's an L plethysmography\nso plethysmography is looking at sort of\nthe physiologic response okay and what\nthey sort of found when we're watching\nerotic\nfilms is that that people who are\nasexual in this case it's vaginal so\nwe're looking at\nwomen they have no\ninterest mentally\nbut the body responds\nnormally so what this sort of means is\nthat\nsomehow stuff from the thalamus is\nsomehow going even though we're not\naroused through like these circuits and\nthese circuits somehow the signals from\nthe thalamus are ending up at the\nhypothalamus and acting activating the\nphysiology does that make sense so like\neven though these steps aren't really\nhere oh I guess you guys can't see that\nso even these steps aren't really here\nsomehow when we're talking about asexual\nindividuals they the the um the sensory\ninput ends up activating the\nphysiology okay a couple of other things\nwe know\num so asexual individuals actually\nmasturbate a fair\namount but if you talk to people who\nmasturbate and are asexual they say it's\nmore about\nrelieving physical\ntension or inducing\nrelaxation so it is more common for\nasexual uh individuals to like kind of\nclean out the plumbing as it were and\nthey're not necessarily horny they sort\nof feel like emotionally not ideal\nphysically not ideal so they kind of\nlike they use it almost like as a\nsubstance right so you just kind of\nmasturbate and you kind of you feel\nbetter physiologically so that's it's\nthe plumbing works with asexual\nindividuals they're just not interested\nin in in\nsex so the other thing is if you ask\npeople okay so if you masturbate like\nwhat do you think about so this is\nwhat's in the mind of asexual\nindividuals first of all they can\nsometimes feel a vague sense of\nlust but the lust is often times not\ndirected towards a\nperson this could be kind of like\nconfusing for people to understand if\nyou haven't experienced it and be can\nbecome quite revelatory for people who\ndo experience it that I kind of feel\nlike horny but I'm not like into a\nparticular\nperson um so they sort of have this\ndiffuse sense of\nAttraction so they kind of feel like\nsort of sexual but there isn't an object\nof their\nsexuality the other thing is that\none researcher was sort of coined this\nterm\nAuto choros\nseexual which is essentially like\nidentity less\nsexuality so this is something that's\nvery very\ninteresting sometimes people who are\nasexual will have fantasies but the\ncontent of their fantasies is very\ninteresting so the first is that even in\nthe case of a sexual\nfantasy they do not identify with one of\nthe characters so for most human beings\nwhen we have a sexual\nfantasy we are the\nprotagonist right so like if you feel\nlike when you have a sexual fantasy like\nthere's a decent chance that you're like\nI want to have sex with this person man\nit would be great if I had sex with\nperson I'mma do this I'mma do this I'mma\ndo this I'mma do this so we are the the\nprotagonist of our sexual fantasies but\na people who are asexual can still\nimagine sexual things and even be\nsomewhat aroused but they're like not\ninvolved it's kind of like an\ninteresting experience\nokay um so there's kind of like an\nidentity\nidentity less sexual\nexperience right and also when I'm\nworking with people who are exploring\ntheir sexuality\nsometimes like even with with like the\nthe men that I work with more common\nwith men for whatever reason just based\non my sample size and who I've seen you\nknow even when we talk about what their\nsexual fantasies are I'll sometimes ask\nthem a very scary question which is in\nthis sexual fantasy of you know man\nhaving sex with woman which one do you\nwant to be and sometimes that's a very\nscary question for people because they\ncan sort of imagine the fantasy and\nthey're getting turned on there's two\nactors there but which one actually\nturns you on do you want to do the\nrailing or do you want to get railed and\nso the way you identify with your sexual\nfantasies can be very very uh\ninformative about who you are and how\nyou think and what you get turned on by\nokay so we sort of know that that this\nalso is where like sometimes they'll\nhave fantasies about fictional\ncharacters or they'll have romantic\nfeelings towards fictional\ncharacters\nokay this is also common so this kind of\nrelates once again to like either you're\ninvolved or you're not involved or\nsomething is going on with identity and\nbeing the protagonist we're not really\nsure but in a someone who is like let's\nsay heterosexual or homosexual we kind\nof know that like I'm involved this is\nwhat turns me on I want to do all this\nstuff but even asexuals when they\nmasturbate can fantasize about\nparticular things but they can fantasize\nabout other people it's just kind of\nwhat we know\nokay\nnow\num\nokay so now let's talk a little bit\nabout what we know about the\nbiology of\nasexuality okay\nso we also Al have evidence that\nasexuality is a variant as opposed to a\npathology because there's all kinds of\nreally\ninteresting biological correlates okay\nso we know that women who are a asexual\nare more likely to have\natypical\nmenstruation okay so we know that\nthere's more more likely if you take 100\nwomen who are asexual and 100 women who\nare not asexual the asexual women are\nmore likely to have irregular or\natypical menstrual cycles and so\nremember this often times has to do with\nestrogen and\nprogesterone but the female menstrual\ncycle probably affects a lot of other\nhormones as well and so something about\nestrogen and\nprogesterone are going to Prime this\nwhole\nsystem so even progesterone\nreduces sexual desire so when a woman\ngets pregnant and they start producing\nmore progesterone\nthat will inhibit various parts of\narousal and even like sexual desire and\nand not just sexual desire but also\nsexual acts and things like that so the\nother reason that\nprolactin inhibits sexual desire is\nprobably from an evolutionary\nperspective so when we're producing\nprolactin if we're women we're we're\ngoing to be prolactin so it's like pract\nso we're producing breast milk and stuff\nlike that and as we have high levels of\nprolactin it also inhibits our ability\nto get pregnant and inhibits are things\nlike our sexual desire and that's\nprobably like adaptive right so once\nwe've just had a baby we we're not ready\nto get pregnant again and once the baby\nis old enough to start eating food and\nstop breastfeeding and stuff like that\nthat's when they they're old enough\nthey're kind of stable and now we may be\nable to get pregnant again from a\nphysiologic or evolutionary\nstandpoint not just humans by the way\nthis is true of animals as well okay so\nwe know that there's atypical\nmenstruation we also know that there is\na delayed\nonset of puberty\ny um and this is where we got to talk\nabout something else another feature of\nasexuality so one thing that's really\ninteresting about asexuality is that one\nstudy showed that among\nadolescents who identifies as\nasexual if you measure them later in\nlife out of 25 who are asexual only\nfre will\ncontinue to identify as\nasexual so we know that at least in one\nstudy it showed that a fair amount of\nasexuality will resolve over time and\nthat's a little bit more fluid than we\noriginally thought so well the key thing\nthat I would say and I'll I'll sort of\noffer some conclusions towards the end\nis if you're someone who feels like\nyou're asexual it I would be careful\nabout jumping into that label as a\npermanent part of your life okay CU\nthere's some evidence that it does\nactually\nchange um a couple of other things this\nis really\ninteresting um more likely to be non\nright-handed this is true of homosexuals\nas well there's something about\nhandedness and sexuality where for\nwhatever reason there's something going\non in the brain or whatever that people\nwho are asexual are more like to have a\nnon-dominant right hand so this can be\nleft-handed or\nambidextrous which means that if you\nfight with two weapons you get less of\nan attack penalty on your offhand okay\nso it's like awesome asexuals are better\nat dual wielding you heard it here first\nchat chat Lords okay the other thing is\nthat we also know that um people who are\nborn later\nin birth\norder are more likely to be SE\nasexual so what does this mean so if\nyour mom had like four kids and you're\nthe fourth kid you're more likely to be\nasexual than the first kid now there's\nsome really interesting research behind\nthis this is also true of homosexuality\nbut there's a lot of stuff about the\ninudo\nenvironment\nthat seems to affect\nsexuality so this could have everything\nto do with like hormonal concentrations\nthat change with sub subsequent\npregnancies but one really interesting\nhypothesis or not hypo I mean there's\nsome evidence of this is that if you're\na woman you've got two x's right and so\nyou have no Y chromosome so when you\nhave a when you have a male child in\nyour uterus the male child starts to\nproduce\nproteins from the Y\nchromosome and this is what allows the\nchild to develop as a\nmale and in some women what happens is\nwe actually develop\nantibodies to these y chromosomal\nproteins which then changes like we\ndon't know exactly what those antibodies\ndo sometimes it attacks those things\nsometimes it activates them we're not\nquite sure what effect it is but what we\nsort of know is as women have multiple\nkids and they develop these antibodies\nto to proteins from the Y chromosome it\nsort of affects the likelihood that\ntheir subsequent kids will be homosexual\nor\nasexual so some people have posited that\nthis is one of the mechanisms okay so we\nknow that there's a lot of biology to\nasexuality we're not quite sure like\nwhat this means or what's going on this\nis where once again I kind of said we\ndon't have very good studies on this so\nwe haven't really explored this fully\nbut we've got data points here and there\nthat suggests that there's a biology to\nit\nokay now let's talk a little bit\nabout asexuality\nvariance\nokay so if you're someone who doesn't\nbelieve that asexuality is a real thing\nhopefully I've given you some evidence\nthat we can rule out everything else\nright we can rule rule out all the\npathologies and some people are asexual\nfurthermore we can look at the nature of\nsexual arousal interest an engagement\nand we can see that if we tamper with\nany of this stuff we will have\ndifficulty with sex right and depending\non what you tamper with it'll have a\ndifferent effect but there are a lot of\ndifferent things so this is the other\nthing to understand about sex it's not\nlike a one organ thing so if we look at\nour heart right our heart handles the\nheart stuff the liver handles the liver\nstuff stomach handles the stomach stuff\ngallbladder handles the gallbladder\nstuff but when it comes to sex it\nrequires a coordination of all of these\ndifferent parts of our brain so we can\nscrew with one and we can get all kinds\nof changes so for example if we have a\nhistory of trauma trauma will affect\nthis and this the inability to engage in\nempathy and even our emotional response\nto the sexual act right so that's where\ntrauma\nWorks um whereas hormones so hormonal\nchanges will affect\nhere and so we can look at all the\ndifferent things that can lead to a lack\nof sexual interest we can even see where\nthey exist like where how they interfere\nwith the sexual\nprocess now let's talk a little bit\nabout all these variant of asexuality\nokay um so I don't know these terms very\nwell okay but like this is where when we\nlook at asexuality there's a variety of\nsubjective experiences okay so one\nis like this uh process of being\na-romantic\ngray a or demisexual I don't even know\nwhat these terms mean I should have\ntaken better\nnotes um and so we sort of know is that\nthere are variant of asexuality so these\nare these are people who feel no degree\nof romance I think demisexuals are\npeople who if they have a romantic\nconnection that can lead to an increase\nin sexual\nbehavior\nor\narousal\nokay\num yeah and if y'all want to help me you\nguys can Define some of these terms for\nme I I have this one\nsecond left the paper behind somewhere\nokay so various\nuh yeah so gray a I think that's that's\nright so you can sometimes experience\nual\nattraction okay that's what what gray a\nmeans the point is that there's various\nvariants and we can kind of see right so\nlet's take the case of a demisexual so\nsomeone who requires an emotional\nconnection so if we were to look at this\nperson there's a decent chance that\ntheir sensory\ninput the strength of their sensory\ninput is lower so looking at like erotic\npictures does not trigger a strong\ndesire for sex and instead what they\nneed is a strong emotional connection or\na strong sense of empathy so these are\npeople who I'm hypothesizing here right\nthere's no studies about this that if\nyou look at this the balance between\nsensory input and emotional importance\nwhen it comes to the desire for sex is\naltered in these individuals very simple\nso that what I like about sort of\nunderstanding the core neurosciences you\ncan look at any one of these variants\nand we can understand how this can be\nexplained by Neuroscience\nokay so we know that there are some\nvariations and like that's fine like we\ndon't know too much about the science\nit's not that we've studied I haven't\nseen a ton of studies on Gray a people\nor demisexual people and the reason for\nthat is because these terms by the way\nare like subjectively developed right so\nthis is people in the asexual Community\nwill start to Define themselves in these\nparticular terms these are not\nscientific terms this may exist this may\nnot exist we're not quite sure so it's\nvery possible that for example someone\nwho's a romantic that if we took all the\npeople who were a romantic we'd find a\nvery high history of\ntrauma and so we don't know whether like\nit's people who are a-romantic have a\nhigh history of trauma or it is a normal\nvariant right so people who are gray a\nwho sometimes experience sexual\nattraction we have no idea is this a\nnormal\nvariant or is this consistent with\nhormonal fluctuations\nright because the whole point of gray is\nsometimes you feel sexually attracted\nsometimes you don't well hm Dr K I\nwonder what\nchanges from day to day or week to week\nin someone's life oh their hormones\nchange so maybe that's like the cause of\nbeing gray a we just don't know because\nthese are not scientific terms these are\nCommunity defined terms and now what we\nneed to do is scientists so we need to\nexplore what the hell is going on here\nokay\nnow let's talk about a couple of other\nthings\nso people on the autism spectrum are\nmore likely to be\nasexual are also more likely to be\nnon-binary now this is very interesting\nbecause we know something about the\nNeuroscience of\nautism so we know about the Neuroscience\nof autism is that these people have\ndifficulty with\nempathy and one of the reasons they have\ndifficulty with empathy is that they're\ninternal\nsignaling\nis off in some way doesn't mean that\nit's bad so sometimes I think it's very\nclear that autism is to me anyway and\nand I'm not intending to offend anyone\nbut so I I've worked with patients for\nexample who have severely autistic\nchildren and I think of that as an\nimpairment so we're talking about kids\nwho self harm a lot can't engage in\ndialogue can't even learn things like\nurinary control bowel control can't\nengage in friendships don't even\ncommunicate and and when I sort of look\nat that I think of that as is a\nmedically defining it that is an illness\nI'm not saying that that person has less\nvalue or more value there's also cases\nof high functioning autism where this\ndoesn't I mean their lives are hard but\nmany of these people don't see that as\nan illness and I think that's completely\nfair right so this is just who I am I'm\nwired a little bit different from\neverybody else and I'm not necessarily\nill so be it right so I I I can see both\nsides of that I think it just depends I\nmean most of what I see is based on what\nmy patients see so if my patient says\nyeah I think of autism as a disadvantage\nI'll say okay sure and if another\npatient says I think of autism is not a\ndisadvantage I say okay sure you're the\none who's autistic you're the one who\ngets to decide whether it's a\ndisadvantage or not a disadvantage I\nhave no place place making that value\njudgment for\nyou so what we kind of know is that\npeople with Autism have difficulty with\nempathy their internal signaling\nespecially their emotional\nsignaling seems\noff so this also creates difficulty with\nrelationships and we know that people on\nthe autism spectrum are also more\nalexithymic which means we are\ncolorblind to our\nemotions so I can tell that I vaguely\nkind of feel bad or good but I can't\ntell that I'm feeling shame or guilt or\nwhatever so what we sort of know about\nautism spectrum and Alexia is that there\nis a\nblindness to our internal processes\nthings like emotions if there's\nblindness to our internal emotional\nprocesses this makes it hard for us to\nbe empathic which in turn makes it hard\nfor us to form\nrelationships right does that kind of\nmake sense so if I don't have empathy\nlike I'm not where this other person is\nand it gets confusing for me so this\nalso I think correlates with asexuality\nbecause if we go back to the\nNeuroscience of asexuality we begin to\nsee that these two circuits of the brain\nare very important for the whole process\nof sexual\narousal and so that this sort of idea of\nlike lost and emotional engagement and\nconnection is like very important for\nsex in general so we can also see like\nonce again how people can be damisexual\nokay this this makes sense too so we\njust know that something about these\ncircuits is common amongst all three of\nthese these people right so if I if I'm\nasexual here's how I put if I'm asexual\nand I I have let's say I'm\nayic so this means that this part is\nimpaired and this part is impaired if\nI'm\nalexic and I'm autistic we can see how\nAlexia leads to a inhibition or\ndifficulty of having sex via\nAlexia so if I'm not aware of my\ninternal signals this is kind of why\nalso touching on the insula there are\nvarious parts of our body that give to\nour body and brain so our brain and our\nbody talk to itself and so if I can't\ntalk to myself if I can't listen to\nmyself then it seems to interfere with\nsexuality so we did a a deep dive some\ntime ago about transgender and\nasexuality where we dug into this in a\nton of detail so our goal today is not\nto talk about asexuality and and autism\nspectrum specifically is to talk about\nthe umbrella of asexuality and autism is\na is a a slice of that if youall want\nway more detail about that definitely\ncheck out the transgender and asexuality\nvideo\nokay all\nright um\nso now the question kind of\nbecomes what\ndo\nokay so now what I'm going to do is I'm\njust going to talk to you'all okay so\nenough enough iPad time to just talk is\nhumans\ntalk all right so here's my\ntake first disclaimer is I'm not an\nexpert in asexuality or or\nlgbtqia mental health or anything like\nthat okay so I'm a clinician I work I\nmean so if you just do just like General\nclinical medicine which is what I really\nlike so I did a fair amount of uh\naddiction\nPsychiatry but I just saw BAS phasically\nanyone and\neveryone and so here's kind of my\ntake and I I I have no desire to offend\nanyone so if I say anything out of line\nplease let us know it's it's it's\nhonestly I'm I'm coming at this from\njust my understanding and I'm sharing it\nand I hope it'll be helpful to\nyou so the first thing is if you if\nyou're not attracted to some someone or\nanyone first of all that's\nokay second thing to understand is that\nthere is a different diagnosis for\nasexuality so one of the biggest\nmistakes that I think a lot of people\nare making nowadays is that they Define\nthemselves as\nasexual right so if you lack sexual\nattraction by the age of 14 or 15 you\nsay I am asexual and then you define\nyourself in this way now I think if\nyou're doing that you're doing yourself\na little bit of a disservice because I\nthink that you may not be asexual right\nso remember that some amount of\nasexuality resolves or there could be a\nhormonal thing or there could be some\nsome other kind of thing you may have\nhypoactive sexual desire disorder you\nmay have all kinds there's all kinds of\nstuff so if you lack sexual interest I\nthink the most important thing to do is\nto thoroughly explore it this is the\nmain piece of advice I would give is\njust explore it now I think um this is a\ncase where I would strongly recommend\ntherapy over something like coaching\nbecause I don't think that that coaches\non average are trained with this kind of\nstuff now if if a Coach specializes in\nthis then that's a different story our\ncoaches certainly don't specialize in\nthis they just have sort of this peer\nsupport angle so we have coaches who I'm\npretty sure we don't ask right but\nthey've sort of volunteered some of this\nstuff we certainly have coaches on the\nSpectrum we have coaches who are neurod\nDivergent we have coaches who have a\nrange of\nlgbtqia\nidentifications you know so so there's\nthat exists but I would strongly\nrecommend that you work with a therapist\nfirst so we also know that Psychotherapy\nis helpful for people who are asexual so\nPsychotherapy is helpful for a couple\nreasons one is that if you have\nsomething if if your asexuality\ndistresses you you should absolutely see\na mental health\nprofessional because if you get\ndistressed by this then there are things\nthat they can do to help you overcome\nthat distress and even work on that\narousal and engage in healthy sexual\nrelationships even if you are not\ndistressed by it we also know that there\nare benefits of seeing a\ntherapist that is because the worst\nchallenge of asexuality is not just that\nyou're asexual it's the societal stigma\nagainst asexuality so in terms of\nacceptance managing kind of stuff\ntherapy can be very helpful so I'll give\nyou all just a simple example I you know\nI've had patients who are asexual and\none of the most annoying things for them\nis how they talk to their family because\ntheir family just doesn't get\nit they're like why aren't you seeing\nanyone yet like oh my God the big 30 is\ncoming up and you're still not married\nlike oh my God like you just have to say\nthe word and I'm going to help you out\nlike oh my God this is something you got\nto do you got to do you got to do you\ngot to do right there's just no\nawareness that like you may not be\ninterested in that and then you have to\ndeal with that crap over and over and\nover again and you can say I'm not\ninterested and then how are they going\nto interpret that they're going to be\nlike what's wrong right they don't\nunderstand that this can be a variant of\nthe population that you're just never\ngoing to be interested they think\nsomething's wrong with you and then they\ngo about trying to fix you if you're not\ninterested right and then sometimes like\nyou'll even have people who are like\nvery like they're very woke right oh\nlike even though I'm Indian I'm wum and\nwhat not I'm woke I'm with it are I know\nyou're not interested but you're gay\nright it is gay you're a gay I know that\nthat's not see that that's what I mean\nlike people just don't get that\nasexuality is like a normal variant so\ncoping with that stuff some of the the\nsocial stigma of it sometimes people\ndon't know like how to relate to you\nright like they don't know like what\nthis means like should I invite you to\ncouple stuff or not couple stuff or like\nit's hard to fit into this world if\nyou're asexual\nso therapy can help with that okay so\nyou can see a therapist so explore it\nnow there may be some people I was sort\nof preparing this lecture and I was kind\nof thinking there may be people who are\noffended if I say like okay don't lock\nin your asexuality even if you feel\nasexual and and the reason for that and\nI'm not placing a value judgment over\nlike asexuality is like less than not\nnot being asexual but I think that in\ngeneral in life the right way to live\nlife is to try to engage in the fullest\nrange of\nexperiences so I think you should enjoy\nas much as life has to offer now I'm not\nsaying that you should enjoy you need to\ndo everything so you don't have to do\neverything that's not what life is about\nbut that if you if you do some if you\nchoose not to do something that's\ntotally fine so I think the right way to\nlive life is to say okay if I like I\ndon't ever want to try meat I'm happy\nbeing vegetarian so go for it right but\nthe the vegetarianism is something that\nyou should choose ideally as opposed to\nit being forced upon you this is true of\nall aspects of of life in general I\nthink life is better when you get to\nmake a choice about how you live your\nlife as opposed to being forced into\nsomething and I've absolutely worked\nwith people who believed they were\nasexual and will then discover that they\nare not asexual and that something or\nother is going on whether it's a history\nof trauma I've seen hormonal imbalances\nI've worked with people for example that\nwill have things like pituitary tumors\nthat are secreting prolactin so this a\nrelatively benign tumor it doesn't\nreally mutate or metastasize or anything\nlike that\na pituitary adenoma can sometimes\nsecrete prolactin so You' just got one\nthing which is a high level of prolactin\nand especially in something like men\nthat'll absolutely kill your sex drive\nand you'll think that you're asexual\nbecause you have no sexual desire and so\nthen we we sort of discover that this\nperson has a pituitary adenoma through\nsome blood tests we do a CT scan they\nsurgically reect it and suddenly they're\nhorny for the first time in their\nlife okay so in my opinion that this is\nlike a good thing right like\nand and you're allowed to tell me I'm\nwrong and I'm going to be open-minded if\nyou tell me I'm wrong but I I would\nencourage all and this I see this\nhappening a lot with like young people\nnowadays right so now I'm showing my\nMillennial age that we too often Define\nourselves way too\nquickly right well like pick some term\nand then this is what I am and then now\nyou're locked into this no you're not if\nwe know anything about the the sort of\nhistory of sexuality it's that sexuality\nis more fluid than we originally thought\nso don't lock yourself into something\ngive yourself the capacity to\nchange and bi all means assess all of\nthis kind of stuff if you have like a a\nlack of sexual desire or whatnot like go\nahead and assess it I've also seen the\nflip side where men are like oh I have\nlow testosterone I have low testosterone\nI have low test I'm not horny I'm not\nhorny I'm not horny it's not that you're\nnot horny you're just asexual your\ntestosterone is fine right and they'll\nsupplement testosterone anyway then\nmaybe they have male hypoactive interest\ndisorder also possibility because it's\nego distonic in that case but I've seen\nthe whole\nrange so the main thing that I would\nencourage you all to do is like just\nunderstand this stuff even understand\nyourself a little bit more and then by\nall means explore don't lock yourself\nin okay sexuality is a choice I don't\nreally think so so I think we've got I\nmean there's a certain amount of choice\nto it for sure but we also know that\nthere's a certain amount of wiring right\nso with all this like data about let's\nsay\nthe antibodies to the y y chromosomal\nproteins like I don't think that's a\nchoice but that clearly seems to have a\nCOR a statistical correlation with\nasexuality or\nhomosexuality\nokay yeah so could you uh okay so now\nlet's do so\nquestions\num could you discuss the distinction\nbetween desire for sex and desire for\nromance yeah absolutely so sex generally\nspeaking is a mechanical Act Right is a\nphysical need so like you don't have to\nhave like romance is about an emotional\nconnection or even a like playing into a\ncultural narrative so romance is about\nlike narrative and emotion and it can or\ndoes not need to include sex so I'll\ngive you a simple example you can watch\nas many romcoms as you want to very few\nof them will include\nsex right maybe at the end or maybe at\nthe very beginning but generally\nspeaking most romantic stories have a\nminimum of sex and on the flip side you\nhave a lot of people who are like into\nhookup culture and stuff like that which\nis sex without\nromance so sex is a physical act romance\nis a narrative an identity an emotional\nexperience and the two are absolutely\nlinked as we've seen based on the\nNeuroscience\nokay is sex really a need or is it just\nsomething that people strongly desire\nit's a great question so let's think\nabout what's the difference between a\nneed and a desire so when I think about\na need I think about something like f\nfood clothing shelter like things that\nare necessary for survival now I don't\nthink sex is necessary for survival\nbecause we've had a lot of human beings\nwho have never had sex in their life and\nthey died just like everybody else\nthere's even some um anthropological\nkind of like quite woooo evidence that\nasexuality is helpful for the survival\nat the level of family so if you I'll\nkind of put it this way this also\nrelates to something called like the gay\nuncle or gay Aunt\nhypothesis so let's say back thousands\nof years ago when human beings were like\nevolving in in that world right so let's\ntake two scenarios let's say that\nthere's scenario number one where\nthere's a family of five where you have\nfive kids and family number two also has\nfive kids so you have two sets of five\nkids now in family number one all five\nkids have children and let's say they\neach have five kids so now you have 10\nadults taking care of 25 kids and in\nfamily number number two let's say four\nof the kids I mean four of the four of\nus have children so we have 20 kids and\none person never has children so now we\nhave\narguably nine adults taking care of 20\nchildren or 10 adults taking care of 25\nchildren or even the the single person\nmay be partnered in some way or the the\nsorry the asexual person or homosexual\nperson may be partnered in some way then\nyou've got 10 adults taking care of 20\nchildren and so what is the survival\nlikelihood of that next Generation if\none of the people from The Generation\nabove never has children and there's\nsome hypothesis that having more like a\ncertain ratio of adults to children that\nthey take care of and having some adults\nwithout their own kids will benefit the\nsurvival of all of their nieces and\nnephews so that way is sexuality a need\nI wouldn't really call it a need but I\nwould say that for the average person it\nis um\na generally speaking a healthy part of a\nfull\nlife but there are many exceptions to\nthat right so if you're taking the\naverage person I would say that having a\nhealthy sexual relationship is one of\nthe core parts of\nlife and by the way I didn't talk much\nabout spirituality if you guys are\ncurious about that we can sort of take a\nspiritual perspective to asexuality and\nthings like that but that's like\ncompletely\nunscientific so I'm trying to do this\nyou know today's lecture is based in\nscience and clinical\nexperience\nokay all right um so you guys want okay\nso there's voluntary asexuality okay let\nme think for a\nsecond so drop me stuff and say did you\nmiss the schizoid part no so the other\nthing is that people who have a schizoid\npersonality are more likely to be\nasexual so there's a very strong\ncorrelation there as\nwell\nokay uh I don't know what automatism is\njoean\ndo you think schizoid PD can be treated\nprobably but it's it's I don't know if\nI've ever\nhad maybe I mean if I've seen skis\npeople with schizoid personality\ndisorder it's been like less than five\npatients and I haven't had a a long\nclinical relationship with them so it's\nit's one of the things that I don't\nspeak much about because I just don't\nhave the clinical\nexperience yeah so so someone saying\naromanticism exists outside of\nasexuality it is correlated pretty\nhighly but not exclusive a-romantic and\nalosexual is an identity exists yeah\nabsolutely\nso I mean we sort of see that but I\nthink that's a that's a conversation for\na different day right so I think the\nlack of romantic attraction that we see\nprevalently today so people are into\nhookup culture and even like red pillars\nor or things like that I think there's a\nlot of stuff going on there\npsychologically so that I have a ton of\nclinical experience exp in so what makes\nit hard for people to form romantic\nconnections that's a whole different I\ndon't know if you guys remember this I\nmean I could draw yall a chart that is\nalong the lines of this very\neasily for\nRomanticism we can do this and we can\npoint out all the ways that people can\nbecome not inter roomit okay so you guys\nwant spirituality\nfine let me just make sure that there\naren't other questions about\nthis\num so dissociate of Personality Disorder\nso we will have something about that\nsoon give us a couple months it's in the\nworks\nokay\num what is\nSPD oh schizoid personality is Mo most\nego distonic or not it's ego syntonic\nwe've got vapu art in chat who's saying\nas someone who's schizoid it's not a\nproblem for me so that's that's a big\ndifference so most people with schizoid\npersonality disorder it's quite egos\nsyntonic okay does anyone physically\ncringe at the idea of romantic gestures\nbut on the very rare occasion crave\nphysical affection\nor physical touch I feel mostly\nembarrassed cringe away from romantic\ngestures and physical touch but on the\nrare occasion I want it is that a\nromantic so this is a prime example of\nwhy we're kind of talking about this\nthis does not sound a romantic to me so\none of the key things I'm not diagnosing\nyou a romantic is into diagnosis but\nlet's understand this example okay so a\nkey feature of asexuality as a sexual\nvariant is eg syonic ego syonic means\nyou don't have a problem with it you're\nactually fine with it so even if we look\nat the the psychological impacts of\nbeing asexual most of the psychological\nimpacts are not becoming not from being\nasexual they're from other people\ntreating you a particular way because\nyou're asexual has nothing to do with\nyou you're fine with it\nusually now if you physically cringe\nthat speaks to me that that you have\nsome kind of response to this which is\naversive now that clearly has a\ndifferential diagnosis so like when I\nworked with people with a history of\ntrauma this is sometimes what it sounds\nlike right so even I had that growing up\nso when I first started like dating and\nbecoming intimate with Partners I found\nthat I had a very like physical\nrevulsion and discomfort with like touch\nbecause it\njust it just didn't feel right and it\ntook me a little while to like get used\nto and appreciate that I had to sort of\ncalm down my physiologic response my\nembarrassment I had a lot of problems\nwith like PDA and things like that like\nbut that all that stuff is gone now now\nI love it all right so I'm very like\ntouchy feely with my kids and I love\nhugging them and picking them up and\nthrowing them up in the air and things\nlike that so that that stuff I think can\nchange that's why I'm saying sort of\ndon't Define yourself as a-romantic if\nyou have those kinds of things so\nthere's a difference\nbetween having nothing okay so here's\nthe key thing about a-romantic versus\nnot a-romantic there's a difference\nbetween not feeling any romance and\nlonging for something and having a\ndifferent part of you that is like\ncringing away from it so a romantic is\nnot internal\nconflict a romantic is an absence of\nromantic desire so if you're the kind of\nperson who has internal conflict where I\nwant it but I think it's cringe that's\ninternal conflict that can be resolved\nusually right that's my\nexperience so ambivalence or internal\nconflict is very different that's not\nasexuality so people who are asexual\nusually have no desire whatsoever\nusually something else is at play when\nyou have that intrinsic sexual desire\nbut some other part of your brain is\nlike pulling you away from it is warning\nyou is having this physiologic response\nthat I've seen a ton of times with\ntrauma so just to give you all a simple\nexample so I was once working with a\nwoman who had something called\nvaginismus so vaginismus is spasm of the\nvaginal muscles usually the outer\nvaginal muscles like the vaginal entry\npoint so if you're if you have a muscle\nspasm at the entrance of your vagina\nthey're spasming and any kind of\npenetrative sex will be incredibly\npainful because it can even trigger the\nspasm and so this person feels lust and\nis sexually attracted and can be even be\nin love but anytime they have a sexual\npenetrative experience it hurts like\nhell and they've tried and they've tried\nthey tried using lubrication they tried\ndoing this they tried doing this they\nthink they're in the mood and then what\nhappens is your body starts to seize up\nbecause it knows oh [ __ ] even though you\nwant to have sex you can't have sex and\nthen your body is like this is going to\nhurt so even as you start to have sex\nyour body is like this is painful by the\nway this is going to hurt and then you\nstart to fight against yourself and then\nyour arousal disappears because now\nyou're being triggered with your trauma\nfor\npenetration and then you force yourself\ninto it because you want this you want\nthis you want this and then it hurts\nagain and again and again so thankfully\nthere are treatments for vaginismus and\nso this is a case of having a sexual\ndesire but then you at some point your\nbrain learning this is not a good idea\nbut you can thankfully do that\nunlearning so there's a big difference\nbetween\nasexuality and conflicted\nsexuality\nokay\num right so so this is the key thing if\nyou have some kind of\nreaction then the likelihood of\nasexuality or a Romanticism is I would\nsay lower right because the whole point\nis we Define it as a lack of interest\nit's not a negative reaction you can\nform negative reactions if you lack\ninterest and you kind of give it a shot\nand it's like [ __ ] that that wasn't any\nfun you try it again you're like [ __ ]\nthat then you can form a negative\nreaction what types of therap are best\nuh for massaging out aversive responses\nto intimacy touch desire o that's a good\nquestion the short answer is it depends\nand we also are going to be working on\nthat so we'll have some stuff on that\nshortly in a couple months um in January\nI am doing another secret\nproject and then we're going to cover\nall this kind of stuff\nthere\nman there's so many questions about\ntrauma\nuh okay but you guys want spirituality\nright\num Can someone's sexual orientation be\nego distonic absolutely\nman oh man have I seen my fair amount of\nthat so like the good example of this is\nlike homophobic\nhomosexuals there's a ton of that so\nthis it's well studied so we know that\nthere's this thing called um reaction\nformation so if I'm conditioned in a way\nthat I'm Tau Tau let's say that I'm\ntaught that homosexuality is Bad Evil\nokay I'm not going to even use the word\nsin I don't even want to single out a\nparticular religion for whatever reason\nI'm taught that homosexuality is bad and\nI grow up in a in a situation where\nhomosexuality is viewed as bad so as I\nstart to have homosexual\nfeelings I feel homosexual and\nhomosexuality is bad therefore I am\nbad and then it's very hard to go\nthrough\nlife hate a part of yourself what's way\neasier is for us to take that hate\ntowards ourself and project it towards\nsomebody else and you'll notice this\ntrue for many people Everyone\nbasically the things that you hate the\nmost in other people are the things that\nyou hate about\nyourself I [ __ ] hate that I'm always\nlate and do you have compassion for\nother people when they're late no screw\nthese people I hate that these people\nare late this is what makes us all\nHypocrites right so if you like talk to\nmost of your friends are hypocrites\nyou're you're a hypocrite and so that we\ndo this we have this very simple trick\nthat we do that when I hate myself cuz I\ncan't fix it right it's who I am so\ninstead what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to prove to\nmyself that I'm like this thing is bad\nand I can I can punish other gay people\nand the more that I punish other gay\npeople the more it aligns with my\nconditioning and I just sort of don't\nhave to worry about the fact that I'm\ngay so it's very\ncommon\nokay\num no not no okay so when we're okay so\nlet's talk about spirituality all what\nam I gonna\nsay let me think about how to okay so\nlet's talk about I know we're talking\nabout sexual attra raction and interest\nhere but we're going to kind of start\nwith sort of a Eastern perspective okay\nso first thing is we did a whole video\non this about how being virgin is the\nultimate Chad and we talked about this\nconcept of brah\nmacharia which is sort of a spiritual\npractice that enhances your spiritual\npotency so we're just going to touch on\nissues of sex\nsexuality um and even to a certain\ndegree of gender\nidentity so this is from my perspective\nokay so when I say like Eastern\nreligions or Hinduism or Buddhism that\ndoesn't speak for all of Hinduism or\nBuddhism but generally speaking I think\nit's a fair statement to make and many\nscholars will\nagree so if you look at the East their\nperception of the self is that there is\na Transcendent self that has no\nqualities so I know it sounds kind of\nweird but if you look at like who you\nare your sense of\nidentity is based on certain mental\npatterns okay so when you say I am smart\nso I can't dissect you and find\nsmartness anywhere I can't biops you or\nx-ray you or find smartness anyway where\nyour IQ you may say but I have a high IQ\nthat's why I'm smart no even if you have\nobjectively a high IQ there's a big\ndifference between having an IQ and and\nfeeling like you're a smart person if\nyou have a high IQ with a bunch of\nnormal IQ kids you will feel like you're\nsmart if you have a high IQ and you're\nsurrounded by a bunch of geniuses you'll\nfeel like you're stupid even though\nobjectively you have the high IQ so the\nfirst thing to understand is anything\nthat you believe about yourself is a\nmental construction or abstraction and\nthis is why it's very easy for\nidentities to change I used to be a\nloser now I'm a winner I used to be a\nbeta now I'm an alpha now I'm a sigma I\nused to be a student now I'm a doctor I\nused to be a son now I'm a father right\nso identity is fluctu Ure that there are\nreal things in the world that change but\nmy point is that that real thing doesn't\ndetermine the identity the identity is\nan abstraction of the\nmind so there are many people out there\nin the world this is sad just to give\nyou all an example but once you're once\nyou become a dad doesn't that make you a\nfather if only that were true the number\nof\npeople that have come into my office who\nhave\nbiological dads but no fathers is\nastronomical see having a child doesn't\nmake you a father right so as we see the\nfirst thing to understand is there's a\ndifference and there's also people who\nhave no biological children and are\nwonderful\nfathers so being a father is not the\nsame as having a child right like it's\nkind of weird like biologically so\nthere's the outside world and the\noutside world penetrates into your mind\nand your mind forms conclusions about it\nand that conclusion becomes your\nidentity and since it's not a real thing\nit's very easy to change right that's\nwhy your identity changes over the\ncourse of your life there's a lot of\nresearch on this too you can look at the\nresearch on post-traumatic growth and\nnarrative and identity formation and\nletting go of your ego and all this kind\nof crap is there okay but this is the\nfirst thing to understand so then the\nquestion is okay like what are you if\nall of your identity is essentially a\nmental construction or an abstraction\nwhich absolutely has utility in the real\nworld right so when I think of myself as\na doctor that helps me function in the\nreal world other people think of me as a\ndoctor I think of myself as a doctor\npatients come into my office I do the\ndoctoring they receive the doctoring and\nthen we're done so it's very useful\nthat's why it's that way but if you\nreally look at the truth of it all of\nyour identity is\nfalse and I'll give you all just another\nexample of this so like the gender\nidentity is a good example of this so\neven gender identity is false really if\nyou look at the chest form of of\nyoga is that gender is also an\nabstraction but you can say but Dr K I\nhave a penis doesn't that make me a man\nI'm not trying to get into the gender\ndebate we're not going to touch that\nlet's just look at it\nmedically so what makes a woman well a\nwoman is someone who has the capacity to\nhave children okay fine so let's say\nthat there's a 9-year-old girl who's in\na car accident has a hysterectomy we\nremove her uterus does this mean that\nshe's no longer a woman or a girl she\nbecause she can no longer have\nchildren right so this is something that\nI've worked with a lot with my patients\nso like a a woman has theagene and has\nto get a double mastectomy every woman\nI've ever worked with who has a double\nmastectomy then goes through a crisis of\nbeing a woman you don't feel like a\nwoman because what is a woman a woman\nhas tits and now I no longer have tits\ntherefore I'm not a woman and then\neveryone will turn around and say no but\nyou are a woman you are a woman believe\nblah blah blah blah blah but for that\nperson there's absolutely a trauma\nbecause this sense of what it means to\nbe a woman part of like my identity of\nbeing a woman is that I will wear\ncertain tops and it makes me feel very\nlike powerful and sexual and people give\nme attention and now I have these\nscars\nright so like very simple things like a\npatient who has a mastectomy is like do\nI still wear a top when I go to the\nbeach or am I supposed to be shirtless\nlike I don't even [ __ ] know there's\nnothing to cover up it's all gone right\nvery traumatic very difficult so you can\ntake whatever physical feature that you\nwant and the idea of being a man and a\nwoman is a mental construction according\nto the yogic system I'm not trying to go\ndown the road of woke or not woke or\nwhatever okay staying away from that I'm\njust talking about let's just think\nabout it\nokay so next thing to understand is that\nso this Transcendent self like if you\nkind of close your eyes and like let's\nsay we take a kid and then we like the\nkid grows up by itself or raised by\naliens on a planet where it's like needs\nare taken care of and stuff like that\nwhat kind of gender identity would the\nkid have like it's not clear right we we\ndon't\nknow so if we really look at a lot of\nour conceptions of masculinity and and\nfemininity like they're not part of the\nTranscendent self so the Transcendent\nself so if you close your eyes and you\nmeditate and you just exist for that\nmoment there's no masculinity or femin\nyou're just existing you're just\nobserving the breath it's you and the\nbreath that's all your experience is and\nthen we can extrapolate that out a\nlittle bit and recognize that every\nmoment is just what the moment is and\nour sense of identity is something that\nwe stitch together from all of these\ndifferent moments but it's still\nstitched together so this is where we\nget to the first kind of Eastern aspect\nwhich is\narar so there's an incarnation of Shiva\nlet me see if I can find this for\nall so in the East we have this concept\nof AR nishar so this is an incarnation\nof\nShiva oh\nGod who is both half man and half woman\nso Shiva and shaki are like two sides of\nthe same coin they're yin and yang we\nhave all these like different kinds of\nentities right so this is or then sure\nlike this side's a dude the sides a\nwoman and there's kind different kinds\nof pract like meditative practices and\nstuff to connect with this kind\nof I'm not qualified to teach all those\npractices because I haven't really done\nthem I mean I understand it in some way\nbut I'm not I haven't been trained in\nthat stuff so I can't teach and\nunfortunately now this is has to do with\ngender identity but gender identity is\nnot sexuality so let's talk about\nsexuality\nokay next thing to understand is\nlike all right so when it comes to\nspirituality like what is\nlust right so this is where we sort of\nstop and think about it and lust is just\na desire it's a desire to engage in some\nkind of act and what we know is that\nwhen we engage in lustful Behavior just\nlike we looked at the Neuroscience it\nreinforces the nucleus accumbens we form\nassociations our brain gets wired right\noh this [ __ ] is good and then once once\nour nucleus [ __ ] want something we go we\nspend our days wanting this particular\nthing because it feels good so yogis\nwill even say that sex is the most\nfundamental of\naddictions and that if we really want to\nbe like have a fully pure mind and we\nwant to be free from our desires it's\nvery hard to do so while having sex\nbecause sex will make us want to have\nsex again now this is the weird thing so\nsee a lot of people in life are seeking\nfreedom but what they're really seeking\nis freedom to engage in bondage and what\nwhat do I mean by that so if I talk to\npeople and ask them what do you want in\nlife they're like I want a ton of money\nI want a ton of [ __ ] I want a ton of\nhoes I want whatever ton of dudes\nwhatever right so I I want I don't want\nany worldly responsibilities and what\nare you going to do with your freedom\nI'm going to eat whatever I want to I'm\ngoing to drink whatever I want to I'm\ngoing to travel where I want to I'm\ngoing to [ __ ] whoever I want to this is\nwhat I want in\nlife okay this is what everybody wants\nbut what fundamentally people do not\nunderstand is what is running your life\nat that point you're not running your\nlife your desires are running that life\nyou are just giving free reign to your\ninternal\nimpulses so if I ask a 5-year-old child\nwhat do you want I want to eat cookies\nfor breakfast lunch and dinner and then\nI say to the child okay fine here's\ncookies you can have as many as you want\nfor breakfast lunch and\ndinner is this kid going to win the game\nof life this is what they want they want\nendless accessibility to their desires\nbut what they're actually doing is\nthey're being bound they're the they're\nthe least free in life because they\ndon't control what they do they're just\ngiving into their desires now the\nnucleus accumbens is running the\nshow right and some of y'all will say\nthis person has won the game of life\nlife they\nhaven't right and you can see this if\nyou look at people like on social media\nand things like that you'll see a lot of\npeople who claim that they've won the\ngame of life and even we'll look at them\nwe'll say oh my God this person has so\nmuch money they have so much Fame they\nhave so much power everybody wants to\n[ __ ] them this is the the life that I\nwant very few of those people are\nactually happy in my experience okay\nmaybe I'm wrong maybe they can say yeah\nI'm the happiest person they think\nthey're happy fine maybe I'm\nwrong but what you'll often times find\nis that these people are unsatisfied\nthey're not content they have all their\ndesires fulfilled but they're not\ncontent and believe me I've seen it so\nmany times I've worked with trust fund\nbabies who have all the money in the\nworld and can hire as many sexual people\nas they want and they're still\nunhappy that's not where happiness comes\nfrom and even y'all will understand this\nbecause you know what it's like to have\na nucleus accumbens that's running your\nlife pornography addiction technology\naddiction video game addiction social\nmedia addiction nucleus succumbent is\nrunning your life running your life\nrunning your life running your\nlife so asexuality like as I've grown\nolder and as I've engaged in more and\nmore spiritual practice I become more\nand more\nasexual this is a good\nthing so I still like you know I've got\nkids and stuff and I'm married and what\nnot but like to be less lustful is good\nbut I also enjoy lust too like don't get\nme wrong it depends on what I'm doing so\nif I'm doing a lot of spiritual practice\nmy lust will go down if gruth is\nlistening to this she's like stop\n[ __ ]\nlying because I can also be quite the\nLusty pirate if you\nwill right but this is the key thing to\nunderstand is that as you engage in some\nso this is where the spirituality comes\nin so the key thing is that if we want\nto understand our Transcendent self if\nwe want to kind of engage in like these\nAdvanced spiritual practices you cannot\nbe lustful because the lust is a\ndistraction there's also physiology to\nthe\nlust because it wants it right so this\nis where you'll look at things so for\nexample there's this yogasan called\nsidas which is a depths\npose so I'll show you all\nsasan\nokay so in\nsidas the main thing is that this is\nprobably the best one the heel of one\nfoot is placed in the perum so the area\nbetween the scrotum and the\nanus and\num let's look at\nthis so if we look at the scrotal blood\nsupply let's\nsee um let me try to find the\nright okay I don't actually I don't know\nif I can I don't know if that's going to\nget me banned actually so I don't\nknow um so if you look at the scrotal\nblood supply the blood supply to the\nscrotum actually happen is on the is in\nthe same spot that you press in sidas so\nin sidas you press your heel against\nyour perenium and when you sit in that\nposture for a long period of time you're\ngently compressing the blood flow to the\nscrotum so you start to probably this is\nmy guess I don't have studies showing\nthis but just matching up what I\nunderstand from physiology to something\nlike um yogic practice the reason that\nthis is called a depths pose this is\nwhat you sit in before Lotus posture by\nthe way so you sit in a depths pose not\nLotus posture and the reason for that is\nbecause it slowly decreases the blood\nflow to your testes which I'm guessing\nmeans that you will sort of start to\nproduce fewer amount less amount of\ntestosterone and then as you produce\nless to testosterone Your Lust decreases\nand you can focus in\nmeditation so the cultivation of\nasexuality or what we call brahmacharya\nis a very important goal in meditation\nthere's also some really weird stuff\nabout when you nut you sort of lose all\nof this Shakti or energy so if we look\nat the human being has a capacity to\nmake a new life and this energy is very\npowerful because it can literally make\nnew life and the moment you start losing\nit through things like masturbation or\nsexual activ you lose a lot of your\nspiritual\npotency so a big part of like this is\nthe key thing to understand is that as\nscience has become more as meditation\nhas become more and more scientific\nwe've actually lost 99% of the spiritual\npotency of these practices so there's\nsomething weird going on in meditation\nright now which is that more and more\nmore more and more people are meditating\nbut very few people are having spiritual\nexperiences from meditation and then\nwhat science concludes is that all the\nspiritual stuff is false\nbut the reason that no one is having\nthese spiritual experiences is because\nno one's body is primed for the\nspiritual\nexperience so good example of this is\nlike and so if you talk to some of these\nlike gurus and stuff like they'll use\nall these terms like energy and dormy\nand stuff like that they'll saying your\nspiritual energy is dormant so the\nMachinery is there but you need to\nengage in a particular kind of diet you\nneed to have a particular hormonal\nbalance and once you have all of these\nkind of diet and balance your gut\nmicrobiome needs to be lwi inflammatory\neven your insulin level needs to be\nsuper low which is why we sort of eat\nthese very specific yogic diets once\nyour physiology has all of these things\ngoing on then your brain can trigger a\nspiritual\nexperience now this is also to be\nunderstood that\npsychedelics so no substance that you\neat or drink or ingest can create\nsomething new all the substances can do\nis trigger endogenous\nreceptors okay so like for example we\nlet's say I use marijuana there is a\ncannabinoid but the whole reason that we\nget high off of marijuana is because we\nhave cannaboid receptors in the\nbrain why do people enjoy alcohol well\nbecause we alcohol binds to the Gaba\nreceptor right so the receptors already\nexist we just have an external substance\nthat's triggering them why are opiates\nso effective because we have IM\nreceptors right so we have to have the\nendogenous structure for a substance to\ntrigger the only problem is that this\nsub this stuff cannot be triggered\nunless you do all of the other stuff\nwith meditation that's the important\nstuff and then you engage in the\nspiritual practice and you'll have some\nkind of weird experience so the whole\npoint of asexuality when it comes to\nspirituality is to engage in this kind\nof stuff\nand technically brahmacharya does not\nmean\ncelibacy brahmacharya means non-\nlustfulness so you can n you can even\nhave sex you just can't be horny that's\nthe goal of\nbrahmacharya and as you become more\nbrahmachari this the potency of your\nspiritual practice will absolutely\nincrease you just have to try it you'll\nyou'll see if you eat a satvic diet if\nyou eat the yogic diet you do all these\npractices and\nyou free from all substances and then\nyou abstain from sex to the point of\nbecoming naturally non\nlustful then you will undoubtedly have a\nspiritual\nexperience but it's not enough to not\nhave sex this is where the noat people\nget it\nwrong because they don't ever sublimate\nthe desire they just try to control the\njerking\noff\nokay so asexuality is very potent it's a\nvery potent spiritual Force this isn't\njust the Eastern tradition if you look\nat so there's another really simple\nhistorical example if something is true\nmultiple cultures will Discover it and\nwhat you find is that every culture and\nevery religion every spiritual tradition\nI don't know about every but all the\ndominant ones that we know about all\nhave an asexual track that they\ncorrelate with\nspirituality and there's even stuff that\nshows\nthat a lot of the\nweirdness of of sexuality and sexual\nidentity even comes from like this part\nof the brain called the temporo parietal\nJunction and that a lot of these like\nweird spiritual experiences that we\ntrigger including things like\ndepersonalization have something to do\nwith the temporal parietal Junction so\nsex affects the temporal parietal\nJunction people who are very very\nreligious have a a sort of a temporal\nlobe\nhyperactivity and people who dissociate\nand depersonalize have activity across\nthe temporal parietal\nJunction and when you have these\nmeditative experiences they're like der\nrealization and\ndepersonalization so something going on\nin that part of the brain the science is\nreally not there to say that all of\nthese things is really what it is we\njust sort of have some vague\ninclinations that there are two or three\ndifferent things that all relate to that\npart of the\nbrain\nokay and so sexuality and spiritual\nuality are very tied\ntogether and so there would even say\nokay but what if I'm asexual what does\nthat mean for my spiritual practice so\nif you ask a\nyogi what do you think about me being\nasexual they would say that asexuality\nis you're lucky to be asexual asexuality\nis a consequence of your Brahma charara\nfrom a past life your celibate your\nspiritual practice from the past life so\nthat you could be born in this life and\nnot have to worry about lustfulness see\nthink about this asexuality is a\nbeautiful gift on the spiritual path\nbecause there's the rest of us who\nstruggle with lust and struggle with\nnofap and struggle with porn and now you\nare born with a life where you have porn\nresistance sex resistance lust\nresistance and so now you can devote\nyourself to spirituality without getting\nbogged down and all that stupid [ __ ]\nthat ruins everybody else's\nlife from a spiritual perspective\nasexuality is one of the best traits to\nbe born\nwith because you look at everybody\nelse's life what [ __ ] up the most\npeople's lives lust number one problem\nis lust what causes the most damage in\nthe world it's not anger it's not\nsadness it's not suicidality it's\nlust why is this what do you mean but\nisn't lust the source of love Yeah\nthat's the [ __ ] problem\nbecause when you were growing up you had\na parent who lusted and so then they had\nsex with someone besides your other\nparent and now there's a divorce now\nthere's two sets of\nkids and now the parenting is all [ __ ]\nup and now that you're\ndivorced you know they your your parent\ndecides to marry this other person that\nthey got pregnant and now they want yall\nto be one happy family but you didn't\npick that you don't want to be one happy\nfamily this is\nlust you're at work you have a secretary\nyou lust for the secretary sexual\nharassment sexual predation here we go\nsexual exploitation here we go\nlust and even for all those disasters\nforget about those disasters you're\n[ __ ]\nteenager what causes the most hurt to\nteenagers lust I'm lusting for this\nperson that are not lusting back it's\nthe found Foundation of a whole genre of\nbooks right these are fiction romance\nnovels what's fictional about it this is\na fiction novel what's fictional the\nfiction is that you lust for someone and\nthey lust for\nyou if it was non-fiction it'd be I lust\nfor them and they lust for somebody else\neasy you all get\nthis so if you guys want the based take\nit's that if you're asexual engage in\nspiritual practice because have plus\n100% yields on\nspirituality you already are born with\nwhat the rest of us are struggling with\nconsider yourself lucky and go see a\ntherapist because the rest of the world\nis going to hate you for\nit people are talking about twitch right\nlike so let's just talk about the meta\nchanges for a\nsecond so everyone's blaming\ntwitch\ncumer meta right but like you all\nunderstand the problem that twitch has\nthe problem that twitch has is [ __ ]\ntwitch\nchat how on Earth do you expect a\nplatform to regulate the cumers of the\ninternet like what the [ __ ]\nman like I'm not saying that their\npolicy shouldn't be better but like do\nyou guys see like the basic like how the\n[ __ ] are you supposed to come up with\nsome policy when there's just a legion\nof cumers that are just waiting for any\ncrack it's like a single crack in the\ndam and it's a flood of the cumers here\nwe\ngo right it's like hold on a\nsecond there's a ton of people who are\nchoosing to watch this stuff instead of\nwatching video games and I'm not saying\nthat there isn't like some\nimpressionable young kid who isn't aumer\nyet who sees all this crap on the front\npage and then they suddenly watch it but\nlike let's\nlike bear in\nmind what the the real problem\nis right the twitch is a platform\nthere's plenty of people who are willing\nto make nude content and there's plenty\nof people who are willing to watch\nit I have something to sell you're\ninterested in buying it and we're\nblaming the guy who's who stall I'm\nsitting in to conduct my\nbusiness right I'm not saying that they\nshould or shouldn't do something I have\nno idea what they should or shouldn't do\nall I'm pointing out is that there's\nlike another layer to\nthis okay and I don't know I don't I\njust don't see anyone talking about\nthat\nyeah right so people are saying that's\nwhat only fans is for and yeah I\nmean luk Rus say Dr play K please go\ntopless and get into the hot tub join\nthe meta yeah I would we'll start an\nonly fans one day but everyone's too\nconcerned we're too commercial to begin\nwith\nokay so does that make sense from a\nspirituality standpoint I know there's\nnot like I mean there there's a lot of\npotency to a lack of\nlustfulness sexy gamer when oh sir\negg oh sweet child we we are already\nsexy gamer and if you can't see it that\nmakes me\n[Music]\nsad\nokay any last\nquestions\nsee everyone saying isn't it a problem\nof sexualizing okay so here's the thing\nlet me explain something to\nyall everyone's saying oh my God they're\nsexualizing content anyone who watches\nthis is going to get sexualized you're\nright it's a\nproblem but boy are we\nscrewed if we are relying on a\nplatform to\nregulate what happens to us\nthe only true antidote to you being\nsexualized by the internet is\nyou the whole reason we got here in the\nfirst place is because we put the\nresponsibility of mental health on the\nplatforms like look at social media and\nattention spans and the rise of\nADHD and we sat there and we were like\nyeah like oh my God like now like my\nattention span sucks because spend all\nthis time on Tik Tok man [ __ ] Tik\nTok like we surrendered our power in\nthis relationship we surrendered the\nability to like decide what I want to do\nwith my [ __ ]\nhead and one of the big reasons for that\nis because here I am with a army of one\nin my head and then what do I what am I\nup against I'm against up against\nbillion dooll industries that are trying\nto take advantage of my my\nbrain so no wonder we're\nlosing cuz we are\noutgunned\nbut the moment that you rely on someone\nelse to shape your mind in the right way\nis the moment that you lose control of\nyour\nlife think about what you're\ndoing I've seen this in relationships we\nlike waiting for this person to make me\nfeel good about myself it's so sad\nespecially with\nparents I want my parent to love me I\nwant my parent to love me I want my\nparent to love me my sense of self-worth\ndepends on my parent and this is hard\nright I'm not blaming this person but\nthere's some amount of agency because\nthat's how we're wired so that\neveryone's exploiting our wiring that's\nfine but like Bros ladies everything in\nbetween you have some control\nhere\nright you have some\ncontrol what you put into your mind is\nyour\nchoice you have some Choice oh I can't\nresist it I know you can't resist it on\na given day fine you\ncrack I cracked yesterday I ate Taco\nBell I ate Taco Bell at Christmas\ntime and then boy did I reget it I may\nbe done with that\nnow\ncan't meditate after Taco Bell it's\nreally\nterrible like I just felt so heavy like\nmind is just dull and doesn't focus and\nall the s other kind of\ncrap two veggie Mexican pizzas is my\ngo-to\norder all right so this is where like\ntrain your mind if you train your mind\nyou will have full control over your\nlife so if you look at like why do\npeople not accomplish what they want in\nlife it's because they can't get this\nthing to\nlisten this thing doesn't\nlisten I want to do the dishes but this\nguy doesn't want to so [ __ ]\nit I really should fill out that job\napplication but this guy doesn't want to\nso [ __ ]\nit and we wonder why mental health is\ngetting worse reason mental health is\ngetting worse is because what little\ntraining we had for the Mind we've now\noutsourced\noh interesting question do spiritual\nexperiences breed more spiritual\nexperiences the same way that lust\nbreeds more lust basically yes not\nprecisely but basically yes so let's\nunderstand something about spiritual\nexperiences as you start to have\nspiritual experiences you accumulate\nshaki energy that energy will then\nfacilitate further spiritual experiences\nthat's number one number two is that\njust like anything else in the mind if\nyou condition the mind in a particular\nhabit then it will get conditioned in\nthat\nway so after you have an a spiritual\nexperience you may be more excited to\nmeditate right so then you sit down to\nmeditate more often it becomes more\nimportant to you totally fine there's\nsome ways in which spiritual experiences\ncan cause\nproblems in terms of having other\nspiritual experiences so there are a\ncouple of pitfalls so here are the\npitfalls of spirit ual\nexperience number one is when you have a\nspiritual\nexperience it creates an expectation to\nhave another spiritual experience and\nhaving an expectation prevents the\nspiritual experience from happening\nbecause the first one you\nhad you had no expectation because it\nhad never happened to you\nbefore right so the first time you have\nlike an outof body experience you're\nlike wow this is\ninsane but how did you get to that first\nspiritual experience with a lack of\nexpectation I was just sitting there\nobserving my breath and suddenly this\nweird crap started to happen now you go\nin and you have the thought I want I\nwant to I want to float around let's go\nlet's ask to travel let's go do all this\nstuff and that will prevent you from\nattaining it that's number\none second problem Pitfall with\nspiritual experience is that it feeds\nour ego because now this thing has\nhappened look at me I'm so\nspiritual I'm so spiritual oh my God so\ncool so the simplest way to avoid the\npitfall of spiritual achievement is by\nshutting the [ __ ] up do not talk to\nanyone about it the moment that you talk\nabout it it becomes externalized see\nhere it is living within you and if you\ntalk about something it goes out into\nthe world and it leaves you this is why\nPsychotherapy works oh I have all this\ntrauma in here and I talk about it now\nit's not in here anymore it's out into\nthe world we did a great video about why\npeople who are quiet are really ADV\nadvantaged in life and you'll notice\nthat there are people who talk a big\ngame and never do anything and there are\npeople who actually do a lot who usually\ndon't talk about\nit so the more you store your energy in\nhere the more it compounds this is what\nwe know from trauma so if I put\nsomething in here and I never let it out\nit compounds and it starts to rot away\non the inside because it's a negative\nthing and so what happens is as you\nstart to talk about it your ego grows\nyou move away from the conditions that\nallowed you to have that spiritual\nexperience and you also lose that sh\ndoes that make\nsense so spiritual experience can foster\nmore spiritual experience provided you\ndon't do it you don't screw it up so the\nbest analogy I can give is hey if I make\nmoney does it get easier to make more\nmoney yeah usually right so if you've\ngotten to the point where you're making\na fair amount of money all you have to\ndo is keep doing that and you'll get\nmore money and furthermore there's a\ncertain compounding interest if you can\nsave some that money will will grow on\nits own so that same same is true of\nspirituality but that's only true if you\ndon't spend\nit right if I get my first paycheck I'm\nlike look at me I got so much money and\nI'm going to go buy a bunch of [ __ ] then\nI won't make\nmoney so synaps is saying How's being\nquiet and compounding negativity good\ncompounding negativity isn't good we\nwant to vent our negativity the whole\npoint about being quiet is you want to\ncompound\npositivity don't talk to people about\nyour positivity right when you achieve\nsomething just let it go don't go tell\nthe whole world hey I do this hey I'm\nworking on this project hey I'm working\non this I have this idea for an app let\nme tell you all this cool stuff I'm\ngoing to\ndo so even we sort of subtly do this so\ntoday we said hey I've got a secret\nsuper secret project coming up so we\nkind of put a nod to it I'm trying to\nsignal to the people that hey their\nanswer is coming I'm working on it and\nat the same time I'm not going to talk\nto youall about what I'm doing because\nthe moment I talk to you it creates\nexpectations I lose my energy for it all\nkinds of stuff check out our video on\nintroverts being\nadvantaged ah so aakashi twins is saying\nhold everything inside don't hold\neverything inside let the negative stuff\nout vent the negativity whatever you\nwant to compound is what you should hold\ninside do you personally believe in\ndeterminism I don't know what\ndeterminism\nis I believe in\nkarma and Karma is nothing but the\nprinciple of cause and\neffect why not hold the positivity\ninside why not share it it depends on\nwhether you want to compound the\npositivity or not right so when I earn\nsomething let's say I earn money same\nanswer as money let's say I earn $100\nwhy not share the wealth you can\nabsolutely share the wealth but then\nit'll be\ngone it's not a bad thing to share the\nwealth the question is what do you\nwant so if you want to share if your\ngoal is to make the world a better place\nthen by all means share your\npositivity right you want to make this\nperson happy because they love you and\nwant to share something go for it\nbut it's there's very slip see the mind\nis slippery the reason I'm speaking in\nabsolutes is because it's very easy for\nego to hijack wanting to make the world\na better\nplace very very\nsneaky so what about love if your love\ndoesn't show how can you truly love what\na great question so what we're talking\nabout is speaking not doing so I never\nsaid don't do so if you have some\npositivity in there you want to share it\nthrough your actions egoless action go\nfor\nit share it right if you feel proud of\nsomething or if you if you've\naccomplished something and you want to\nshare it with the world do it but do it\nwithout\nego so if you want to you know someone\nneeds money you don't advertise that\nyou're a charitable\nperson that's a problem because other\npeople will come to you asking for money\nright so you can do kindness I'm not\nsaying don't do kindness what I'm\ntalking about is specifically about\nspiritual culmination and the\ncultivation of spiritual\nenergy so there are gurus like s gurus\nspeaking about their spiritual\nexperiences why do they do it don't they\nlose energy based on my understanding\nthey do but that's also a calc I don't\nknow you'd have to ask him right why he\nshares what he shares I mean I I have\nsome inkling but I'm not going to\ncomment on that because generally\nspeaking we don't do that either so on\nthis channel we do our best to talk to\npeople not talk about people doesn't\nmean that we never we sometimes talk\nabout people but we try to be present\nand just not talk about\npeople so if you want to know why\nsomeone's doing something you go ask\nthem\nokay how can you tell if it's actually\negoless or just virtue\nsignaling so that comes with the power\nof discrimination right so the more you\nbecome\naware\nof what ego looks like and how it acts\nthe more you'll be able to tell is this\nfor ego or not for ego and then the\nother subtlety here is you can do\nsomething not for ego and still have\nyour ego affected so my personal\nexperience has been that I can do\nsomething from a place of no ego but\nwhat I've come to realize is when I do\nit the ego will grow so I just prepare\nmyself for\nthat right I'm doing this thing it's not\nideal the ego will grow but so be\nit because sometimes you have to\ncommunicate for some other\nreason\nso just to give you all a simple example\nright so I trained at Harvard Medical\nSchool and that's a good thing right\nit's like\noh and there are times where I will\nshare that so like there are times where\nit's useful so like I also wrote a book\nand as part of the book proposal and\nwhen I'm speaking to my agent or a\npublisher I want to share that tidbit\nbecause it will make the Venture that\nI'm trying to do more successful\nand I pay the price of now my ego is\ngoing to grow a little bit because I've\nsaid look at me I'm so\ngreat right so there are times where you\nhave to do\nit that's okay it's just the price you\npay is going to be a growth of ego and\nsince I choose to exist in the world\nthis is going to happen my ego is going\nto\ncome which by the way y'all can\npre-order now\nright so it's a parenting book for those\nof youall that don't know I wrote a book\nabout how to be a healthy gamer and\npeople may be super confused about that\nwhy didn't you write a book for us very\nsimple reason I was looking at If I Die\nTomorrow how can I help the world and\nwhat I realized is that if I had written\nthis book or someone else had written\nthis book 30 years ago half of us would\nnot be in the position we're in\ntoday the most important thing I can do\nis go back in time and teach\nparents about how to communicate with\ntheir kids and how to protect them\nagainst\ntechnology I'm helping 5-year-olds sixy\nolds and seveny olds hopefully fight\nagainst this tide of addictive\ntechnology right very\nsimple now I wish I could say that you\nguys can benefit a lot from the book I\nthink you can benefit a lot from the\nbook but like it's not I mean Target is\nparents so if you guys want to\nunderstand the Psychology and\nNeuroscience of gaming we explain all of\nthat and if you want to get better at\nyour communication skills then you'll\nbenefit from the book but like 30% of\nthe book is going to be framed towards\npeople that are not you but now we also\nhave the average age in our community is\nlike in the early 30s I think so we have\na lot of young parents and if youall are\na young parent definitely check it out\nit certainly helps us and then makes it\neasier for us to write additional books\nif this book is successful because then\nwe can say okay if Dr K has a choice\nbetween streaming for 50 hours and\nwriting a book what's a better use of my\ntime there's absolutely like a very like\nmaterialistic calculation to that it's\nnot just money it's about reach and\ntrying to help the most\npeople there's a worldly calculation so\nI would certainly appreciate it if you\nguys want the book and you're interested\ngo for it we also teach a fair amount of\nlike communication skills which I think\npeople in our community have been asking\nfor once again it's framed from like a\nparent child persp perspective but how\nto talk how to listen how to set\nboundaries with people if yall are\ninterested in that stuff definitely\ncheck it\nout so that's what we did it for and I\nI'm next ones are coming for y'all I\ndon't think I'm going to write another\nparenting book that's the one thing I\ndid for them and they can go have that\nand hopefully we'll make the world a\nbetter place next stuff is going to be\nfor\ny'all\nokay all right so thank you all very\nmuch for coming today\num let's see not\nme so I think it's also interesting\nright because if we ask about\nparents what we'll find is that if we\nhave a stream on asexuality there's\nthere's a selection bias\nthere\nright um oh my god I've never seen this\none\nbefore\nthat's a cool\nemote\nso stream1 aexuality I would imagine\nthat the majority of people aren't\nparents but hey you never know so listen\num I just want to say thank you all very\nmuch for being with us for 2023 we\nstarted this journey four years ago it's\nbeen a lot of fun I think it's cool that\nlike I'm working today and this is what\nI do for work I'm grateful to be able to\ndo this share this stuff for youall we\nreally hope it's helpful I'm really\nlucky that I get to do things that help\ny'all and I enjoy um and I'm grateful\nfor yall for supporting us in whatever\nway you have and supporting us in terms\nof just showing up and watching and\nparticipating asking questions that\nreally makes our content way better so\nthank you for that whether it's\nsubscribing or following or whatever\nthat helps us too and if yall do do\nstuff like you sub or you donate or like\norder something or buy the guide or\nwhatever like all that kind of stuff\nhelps too we're here to try to build as\nmuch as we can for yall unfortunately a\nsilly lesson that learned a little while\nago is that the more free stuff you\nbuild the more expensive it is which I\ndon't know why I didn't think about and\nso as we've grown and stuff like that\nwe've started to realize we do need some\nkind of income and so we're trying to\nbuild things for different people based\non what their resources are and we try\nto sort of make things as value driven\nas possible so that's another reason why\nwe don't do a whole lot of like donation\ndrives and stuff like that I I really\nwant y'all to be able to get some value\nif you're giving us money we want you to\nbe able to get some value out of it and\nfor those of you all that are kind\nenough to just give us money just\nbecause you give it to us thank you very\nmuch we'll put that money to good use in\nbuilding things like this so thank you\nall very much have a happy happy holiday\nand I'll see\nyall probably in 2024 tiny little chance\nthat I show up on New Year's Eve or\nsomething like that and I just stream\nbecause"
