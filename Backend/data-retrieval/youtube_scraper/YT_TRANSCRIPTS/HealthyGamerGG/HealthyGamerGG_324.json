    "transcript": "you're antisocial you don't really like\nother people and that wouldn't be a\nproblem except you're also\nlonely so this is something that I'm\nhearing happen more and more where\npeople are\nlonely but they don't really like\nsocializing they don't like hanging out\nwith people and how do we actually solve\nthis problem because we have an epidemic\nof loneliness right now so today what\nwe're going to talk about is what to do\nif you are both antisocial and lonely if\nyou cra human connection but anytime\nthere are humans around you're like no\nthis is annoying I don't like these\npeople this is a waste of my time we're\ngoing to teach you how to fix that\nproblem okay so let's understand why\nsocial interactions are actually painful\nthe first reason that social\ninteractions are painful is because\npeople suck to be blunt people are\ngetting worse like I swear to God people\nare getting worse so I've been doing\nPsychiatry I've been seeing patients for\nsince 200 what is this 14 okay so I've\nbeen seeing patients for about 9 years\nnow and in my professional opinion\npeople suck more than they used to like\nI hate to say it but it's true let's\nunderstand a little bit about why okay\nso first thing is that people's level of\nTolerance is decreasing what we're\nseeing based on the Internet is as\npeople use more technology their\ncapacity to emotionally regulate is\nactually decreasing as people's capacity\nto emotionally regulate decreases what\nthat means is that they get pissy more\nthey get more mentally tuned out and\ntherefore they're like harder to be\naround the second thing that's starting\nto happen with people is that we're\ngetting radicalized a little bit more so\npeople are sort of you know are are part\nof these like algorithms on Twitter or\nYouTube or Tik Tok or Instagram or\nwhatever or Reddit right and as we enter\nthese Echo Chambers we start to become\nradicalized and the more radicalized we\nbecome the less empathic we become which\nis also a result of technology so people\nare sort of becoming more emotionally\ndisregulated it's easy to trigger people\neasy to piss people off people are\nbecoming a little bit more radicalized\nlike yeah like if you believe in this\nthen screw you and I hate you and all\nthese people are terrible right so the\nworld is becoming more antagonistic more\npolemic and PE human beings are becoming\nless empathic so as human beings are\nstruggling and as we're becoming more\nburnt out the first thing that goes with\nburnout the first sign of burnout is\nactually a lack of empathy or the loss\nof the capacity of empathy which means\nthat as the world struggles more as my\nown crap is taking up so much of my time\nI have less time for you and I hate to\nsay this but like it's true people are\ngetting worse and we're we're both\nvictims to this too and this isn't just\nme saying like oh like yeah it's like\neveryone but me and you right like all\nthe other humans suck but like me and\nyou are good no this is happening to me\nthis is happening to you it's happening\nto everybody right so it's harder for\npeople to be decent human beings that's\nwhy it's that's one of the reasons\nyou're in your social like let's call it\nwhat it is but there's other stuff\nbecause you can't really do anything\nabout that right but there isn't any\nutility to saying people just suck and\nthat's why you're antisocial like yeah\nthat's the end of the YouTube video now\ngo out and what exactly like no no so\nthat's the one thing that we have to\nacknowledge has become objectively\nharder but there are actually a lot of\nthings that you can do to better\ntolerate those things and improve your\nenjoyment of social interactions okay so\nlet's start with the biggest one or not\nthe biggest one but just one the one\nthat came to my mind first okay so one\nof the things that really sabotages\nsocial interaction is ego and comparison\nso if we literally look\nat what you do when you hang out with\nother human beings you can be engaged\nwith them right so if we're like all\ntalking about let's say like politics\nright it's a lively discussion but the\nmoment that your mind starts making\ncomparisons you enjoy the social\ninteraction less so if we're talking\nabout politics but I someone else is\nover there and like I'm like oh my God\nthat person is like making such great\npoints and that person is so articulate\noh my God they're so articul ulate and\nI'm not articulate I sound like a\nbuffalo like oh my God so suddenly this\nthis politics discussion which may have\nbeen a train wreck but we were all kind\nof enjoying has become worse because my\nmind has started to make a comparison\nyou can also do this with all kinds of\nother comparisons any comparison that\nyou make in a social interaction is\ngoing to damage your enjoyment of the\nsocial situation oh my God like we're me\nand my homie are talking to these two\ngirls but my homie is taller than I am\nand he's sexier than I am and then\ninstead of like enjoying talking to\nthese two girls I get trapped in my own\nhead I start making comparisons and then\nI'm not enjoying myself so watch out for\ncomparisons that you make when\nsocializing first of all they don't do\nany good right because what are you like\nwhat's the point of making that\ncomparison in that moment so they don't\nreally help us in any way all they help\nus do is feel inferior usually and the\nsecond way that they sabotage our social\ninteractions is now we are in our head\ninstead of engaging in the social\ninteraction and anytime I in my head I'm\nnot going to enjoy the socialization so\nif we're if we really pay attention you\ncan be enjoying yourself in a social\ninteraction and the moment that you\nstart comparing that enjoyment will\nliterally get shattered so what do we do\nabout this the most important thing is\nto catch it right notice when your mind\nstarts going off on that comparison\ntrack and this is what's kind of weird\nwe made a video about the science of\nwillpower and it turns out that\nawareness of something and controlling\nand suppressing that thing come hand in\nhand literally the part of your brain\nthat is aware of things is the same part\nof your brain that controls it so as you\nbecome aware of something its power\nliterally diminishes in your brain so if\nyou can catch yourself making the\ncomparison your mind will automatically\ndecrease the level of comparison that\nyou'll make that may take a little while\nbut it'll absolutely happen over time\nand the beauty of this is as you stop\ncomparing you will start to enjoy the\nsocial interaction a little bit more you\nwill be more more engaged you'll get\nthat positive feedback and then you will\nfeel less antisocial it'll be more fun\nthat's the point right so be careful\nabout comparison now the second thing\nthat's going on is super interesting is\nrelatively new comparison has existed\nfor the history of humanity this is\nsomething that's really really new there\nsomething weird that happens nowadays\nwhen we socialize up until the moment\nthat we start socialization we're on a\ndevice we're usually engaged in\ntechnology in some way and that is\nhaving a really interesting effect so\nany time I'm using technology when I\nstop using the technology my internal\nemotional state becomes worse so if yall\nhave kids and you have someone who stops\nusing their device if you take your iPad\naway from the kid or you tell them to\nturn off the video game the first thing\nthat happens is they become really\nreally grumpy and cranky you may have\nnoticed this in yourself or your\nsignificant other that when you're done\nplaying a video game or someone stops\nyou from playing a video game anytime\nthe technology stops you don't feel\nemotionally great right like if you've\nbeen playing like [ __ ] queuing up for\nsomething for 8 hours at a stretch you\ndon't end that and you're like man I\nfeel amazing I'm ready to go have some\nfun today no you just feel awful at the\nend of technology so what's going on\nthere so we know that basically all of\nthe engaging Technologies suppress our\namydala and our lyic system so our lyic\nsystem is our emotional circuitry and if\nyou kind of think about it like if I'm\nhaving a bad day and I start scrolling\nthrough Tik Tok then what's going to\nhappen that it's going to kind of numb\nout the bad day that I'm having right\nfor the next 15 minutes like I'm kind of\nlost in this dopaminergic kind of\nwhatever it's not really super fun so\nit's not entirely dop and energic but my\nnegative emotions go away so there's a\nreally interesting principle in the\nbrain which is that when we have\nsomething that is suppressing a part of\nthe brain and we take that away what we\nexperience is a neuroscientific rebound\nso as soon as you take the device away\nfrom the kid they get more cranky than\nthey would have been if the device ever\ntouched them in the first place when\nwe've been playing video games for a\nwhile we feel grumpier less motivated a\nlittle bit angrier a little bit more\nanxious all the negative emotions rise\nup this is a neuroscientific rebound\neffect so now let's understand what this\nhas to do with\nsocialization so if I socialize with\npeople for one hour and I've been using\ntechnology up until that point the\nsecond I stop the technology the\nnegative emotional rebound effect starts\nto kick in in my brain and for the first\nhour that I interact with people I will\nliterally enjoy myself less because of\nthat emotional crankiness post\ntechnology so now what's going on is\nyour assessment of how fun is it to hang\nout with other people is actually being\nmessed up by this neuroscientific\nrebound of negative emotion post\ntechnology so instead of being able to\nenjoy one hour with someone the first\nhour that you step away from technology\nit's actually like hard to have fun with\nthem and yall know what I'm talking\nabout if you've ever been in the\nscenario where you go to a party right\nyou're like going to a party and you\ndon't really know what to say you're\nkind of hanging out and you're like H\nyou don't really feel great you feel a\nlittle bit\nanxious no one's really talking to me\nyou say hi to a couple people maybe you\ngrab a drink and then like you're kind\nof feeling anxious and 30 minutes in no\none's really talking to you so you pull\nout of your phone and then suddenly you\nfeel better right you're kind of like oh\nmy God I still like I don't like being\nhere now I'm the loser who's sitting on\nthe corner the corner on their phone but\nlike that's all you kind of know how to\ndo and that feels you makes you feel a\nlittle bit less anxious right it's a\ncoping mechanism because now you're at\nleast like looking at cap pictures on\nthe internet and this is exactly what\nhappens so one of the key things to\nunderstand is that part of the reason\nthat social activity isn't Fun is\nbecause we are using technology right\nbefore we start engaging in social\nactivity and what that ends up doing is\nsabotaging our enjoyment of the social\nactivity once we sabotage the the\nenjoyment of the social activity once\ntwice three times then what happens our\nbrain learns our brain learns that hey\nwe've gone out and hung out with people\nthree times and it is not fun every time\nwe do it and then what happens is it\nwill decrease your motivation to\nsocialize because you're like\nsocialization isn't Fun where did that\nconclusion come from that conclusion\ncame from a emotionally withdrawing\nbrain trying to engage in socialization\nso what is the solution to this my\nfavorite solution if y'all want a real\none that is hard is walk for an hour\nbefore you engage in in social activity\nand do not use technology so ideally\nabstain from technology for about an\nhour before you engage with people but\nit is even better if you go for a walk\nand this is where people are saying like\nOkay what about podcasts or what about\nmusic ideally none of it just be with\nyourself for a little while go for a\nwalk and ideally for an hour depending\non where you live you may not be able to\ndo that may not be safe whatever the key\nis to try to avoid technology for one\nhour before you socialize with people\nthat'll like kind of calm your brain\ndown and then once your brain is a\nlittle bit calmer you will be able to\nengage with people and you will actually\nenjoy it more the last thing that we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about are a\nfew more concrete tips to actually\nincrease your enjoyment of social\ninteractions so I found that a lot of\npeople who are antisocial take a\nbackseat in social interactions right\nthey're like they're the extroverts and\nthe extroverts are running the show and\nso what I have to do is like be kind of\nlike a passive recipient because all the\nsocial people are figuring out what to\ndo I'm kind of an outsider I can't\ndirect anything no one's going to listen\nto me and that is a huge mistake because\nonce you let the extroverts start\nrunning the show they're going to take\nthe conversation and start doing things\nthat are going to make you feel\nuncomfortable so I know it sounds kind\nof paradoxical but if you want to enjoy\nsocial activities more you need to\nadvocate for moving things in the right\ndirection so here's a list of questions\nwhich I kind of enjoy asking that sort\nof get get the ball rolling right so\nfirst question that I tend to ask people\nis hey like is there anything you're\nexcited about over the course of the\nnext year or is there if you anything\nthat you've been excited about over the\nlast couple of months anything that\nyou're looking forward to so I do not\nask the questions that are the standard\nquestions what do you do for a living\nhow old are you where are you from what\nkind of video games do you like I don't\nask any of those questions about their\ninterests why because those questions\nbecome interviews where are you from I'm\nfrom Massachusetts period and now you're\nlike what do you do in Massachusetts I a\nbiotech engineer\nperiod what do you do for fun I watch\nsports and I go clamming in the ocean\ncool right do you see how like those\nquestions which by the way are like an\nfrom an era when we were trying to like\nsocially rank people right that's that's\nlike that's why we ask all those\nquestions like I get all those questions\nby Indian aunties and uncles like all\nthe time like oh what are you doing are\nyou Doctor are you a doctor okay let me\ngive you plus five okay okay now I\nrespect you more because you have a\nprofession you are artist bhagan e you\nare artist oh my God that's minus 20 no\nno no we can't do that oh doctor where\ndid you go to school oh Harvard oh my\nGod that's plus 20 oh my God so sexy\nright that's why we ask these stupid\nquestions and these stupid questions\nmake people feel embarrassed or make\npeople feel proud so you don't want to\nbe asking those questions instead ask\npeople what they're interested in what\nthey've been doing recently like\nactually don't ask what you've been\ndoing recently cuzz sometimes people are\nlike I've been sitting at home playing\nvideo games for three months so instead\nask him hey is there anything you're\nlooking forward to or what do you think\nabout something that's going on so you\ncan ask him a little bit about current\nevents but you want to ask what's\ninteresting what are you looking forward\nto what was the last year like for you\nthat's a nice open-ended question\nwithout a positive direction what was\nlast last year like for you is there\nanything that you're looking forward to\nor anything that you hope will happen\nover the next year and then ask\nfollow-up questions based on that and\nthen you also want to pay attention and\nkind of give them a chance to ask you\nquestions\nbut the other thing that you can do is\nwhen you ask them a question if they\ngive you an answer you can sort of offer\nyour own perspective right so if they\nsay something like oh yeah what I'm\nreally hoping for for next year is to\nlike get a stable job and that's where\nyou can empathize and you can say brah I\nknow exactly what you're talking about\nright so I was like in and out of things\nfor about 2 years and finally stuff\nstarted settling down like I didn't know\nwhat I was doing for a while but I feel\nso grateful that like it seems sorted\nand like I hope things work out for you\ntoo right so you can offer your own kind\nof perspective without them necessarily\nasking so you want to steer the\nconversation in ways that you feel a\nlittle bit more comfortable you can also\ntalk about things that are like hot\nbutton issues I think is okay so you can\nask people about politics I know\neveryone's like oh my God don't talk\nabout politics don't talk about politics\nat work with other human beings that\nlike really engages them and it can be\nreally fun so here's the other cool\nthing about when you do something like\nthis a lot of people who are antisocial\nare worried about how to get into the\nconversation right so they're like\npeople are talking back and forth and\nyou're like how do I butt in the cool\nthing is when you start a conversation\nyou can shut up for the rest of it and\neveryone will perceive you as a part of\nthe conversation because you got the\nball rolling you're like running the\nshow you're like at the head of the\ntable it's super cool if you like being\nquiet and you don't know how to butt\ninto conversations what you should do is\nstart the conversation because then it's\ncheck mark we're done make it's awesome\nI love it as an introvert who doesn't\nlike talking okay if you're ready to\ntake the next step on your mental health\nJourney check out Dr K's guide it's an\nimmersive resource that distills over 20\nyears of my experience laid out in a way\nthat is tailored to your needs so if\nyou're ready to better understand your\nmind and take control of it check out\nthe link in the description below the\nlast tip that we're going to give you\nwhich is the most painful of of them all\nis for you to be a social butterfly if\nyou are\nantisocial now this is where a lot of\npeople get confused because they're like\nwait aren't extrovert Social Butterflies\nyeah they can be but if you're an\nintrovert and if you're antisocial you\nneed to be a social butterfly for 6\nmonths and here's the reason why if\nyou're antisocial or introverted chances\nare you are more selective with who you\nhang out with hell the reason we're here\nin the first place is because you don't\nlike hanging out with the average person\nright so then the the problem we run\ninto a really interesting problem when\nit comes to our brain and reinforcement\nwhich is that if I don't like hanging\nout with the average person and I force\nmyself to socialize with like three\npeople and I don't have a good time what\nis my brain going to be telling me it's\ngoing to be telling me hey we attempted\nthis behavior and we got punished for it\ntherefore we are not going to reinforce\nthe behavior we are not going to\nincrease our motivation towards\nsocialization because when we tried to\ndo it it was painful we're not going to\ndo it again so then what happens is we\ndon't socialize for a couple months and\nthen we get lonely and then the\nloneliness gets so big that we force\nourselves to socialize but already at\nthe beginning my brain is like oh my God\nI can't believe I have to do this again\nright that's what it does so instead\nwhat you really need to do is be a\nsocial butterfly and why it's not\nbecause you're trying to you know like\nmake a 100 friends what you're trying to\ndo is meet a 100 people so you can find\nthe most tolerable five human beings\nthat you actually enjoy hanging out with\nthe other advantage of doing something\nlike this is like you're just telling\nyourself okay for six months stuff is\ngoing to suck I'm going to try to meet\nas many people as possible and when\nyou're trying to figure out what should\nI do ask yourself will this Le lead to\nmeeting more people right so this can be\nsomething as simple as but I have my\nonly like I only have my group of\nfriends like how do I get them to\nintroduce me to more people anytime you\nhave an activity with your core group of\nfriends you can literally ask them hey\nis there anyone else that you'd like to\ninvite right so anytime you make plans\nor you're following up with someone just\nask them is there anyone else that you'd\nlike to invite is there anyone else that\nyou think would enjoy what we're doing\nso you're actually asking because you\nknow five people the one of the people\nthat you're inviting knows five more\npeople so even a cluster of introverts\nwho can barely tolerate each other if\nyou use this technique you will get\nconnected to way more people and the\npoint of being a social butterfly is to\nnot be a social butterfly forever it's\n[ __ ] exhausting it's to try to meet\nas many people as you can so you can\nselect the 5% of them that you find\ntolerable and enjoyable but it has to\ncome with a period of robust social\nactivity and this is a little bit like a\nchicken or egg problem and a good\nanalogy of this is like I hate going to\nthe gym because I'm out of shape well\nlike that's true right but the way to\nenjoy going to the gym is to start\ngetting in shape so it's not so damn\npainful all the time so there's this\nlike early period which is a little bit\nof a Bruiser and in my experience really\nencouraging people to like socialize a\nton over a brief period of time and what\nyou're doing is you're internally you're\nnot there just to like have a good time\nyou're there to try to figure out okay\nwho out of this do I actually want to\nhang out with in six months I'm G to try\nto find five friends in six months that\nI enjoy hanging out with and that is how\nyou become less antisocial the real\ntragedy in the world today is that\neveryone is becoming increasingly lonely\nand also people are starting to suck\nmore and as a result it's not fun to\nsocialize it's just not as enjoyable for\nus and if we really want to fix this\nproblem and get out of the cycle of I'm\nso damn lonely let me force myself to\nsocialize oh my God this was awful I\ncan't wait to be at home again this\ncycle we get stuck in this cycle between\nabject loneliness desperation and\nsocialization if we want to break this\ncycle what we really need to do is have\nmore fun in social situations but this\nisn't just like oh just have more fun\nbro this is where if we understand why\nwe don't enjoy those social situations\nwe can actually fix those problems and\nyou will literally start having more fun\nin social situations and once you start\nhaving fun socializing then fixing\nloneliness becomes way\neasier\n[Music]\nwe"
