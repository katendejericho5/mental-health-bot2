    "transcript": "number one advice if you have a crush on\nsomeone no confessions confessions are\nterrible let's understand why so if you\nhave a crush on someone you have this\nyou have a little bit of emotion your\nlove starts down here okay I'm not\npointing to my penis I'm trying to point\nto my belly button so love starts in the\nbelly button and works its way up to the\nchest and when it gets to about the\nthroat right so this is like it starts\ndown here with butterflies in the\nstomach and then we feel that aching\nover here and if we let the love build\nup too much it ends up in our throat is\na lump and we can't say anything and\nthen we feel crippled that's how love\nworks physically logically it's\nscientific okay so when you're in a\nrelationship with someone let's say\nwho's a friend and you signal to them\nthat you're attracted to them and that\nyou want to go on a date confessing\nmeans letting all this crap that is\nbuilt up out so you're not just like\ntelling them you're dumping all of this\nlike pent up love and oh my God I need\nyou so bad oh I've been loving you for\nall of this time and I need you in my\nlife right you can't dump that on people\ncome on"
