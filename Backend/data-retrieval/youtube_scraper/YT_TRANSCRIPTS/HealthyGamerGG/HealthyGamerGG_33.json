    "transcript": "gaming does not lead to dissociation\ngaming is an artificial form of\ndissociation so what leads to\ndissociation is usually overwhelming\nemotion so I'm unconnected I'm I'm\nfeeling feeling feeling feeling feelings\nare getting worse worse worse worse\nworse and when they rise Beyond a\ncertain threshold it's too much to\nhandle boom unplug the circuit we're\ngoing to dissociate traditionally the\nway we conceptualize dissociation is an\noverwhelming emotional experience\ntriggers dissociation gaming\naccomplishes the same thing so gaming\nwill induce a similar state of emotional\nnumbness and since we are using gaming\ngaming is like Liane or anesthesia for\nour emotions and since we're using this\nexternal thing we no longer need to\ntrigger the internal dissociation"
