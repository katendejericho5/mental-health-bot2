welcome to a another healthy\ngamer G stream my name is Al kenoi just\na reminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational entertainment purposes only\nif yall have a concern or question\nplease go see a licensed\nprofessional welcome everybody happy\nMonday I've been streaming a little bit\nmore recently um and that's fun so I'm\nlooking forward to doing more streaming\nwe've been in town I've been traveling a\nlot this year went to like all the stuff\nout in California like the streamy and\nthe American Psychiatric Association\nconference and Vidcon and like all these\ndifferent cons and conventions and\nconferences and award shows and whatnot\nthe occasional\npodcast um I was on the iced coffee Hour\npodcast recently and I hear that people\nare enjoying it quite a bit so if you\nguys are interested it was like a\nthree-hour podcast so for those of y'all\nthat are into long form content by Dr K\nI highly recommend y'all check it out um\nI'm sure that someone can link it\nsomehow somewhere some somewh but it was\na lot of fun it it was one of my\nfavorite\npodcasts so there's a couple of other\nannouncements we've got um the first is\nthat this Friday we are going to have uh\nan awesome guest Dr Uma Naidu who is an\nexpert on food and mood so she's a\npsychiatrist like I'm sure she's on the\nfaculty at Harvard Medical School works\nat I think MGH M General Hospital um and\nshe's written WR a couple of books about\nthe impact of food in Psychiatry and I\nknow that there's all this gut\nmicrobiome stuff going on but she was\ntalking about food and Psychiatry before\nit was cool so she's going to be on this\nFriday and we're going to learn a little\nbit about food and\nmood\num\nand yeah so check that out the other\nthing just to let youall know we\nrecently started YouTube memberships so\nthis is for people who are interested in\nmore in-depth content basically for 10\nbucks a month you guys get four\nadditional lectures that are 1 hour in\nlength plus Q&A um the topics of\nlectures are actually determined by the\ncommunity so for those of you all that\nwant like more stuff that is a little\nbit more in-depth and y'all want to pick\nwhat Dr K uh Le builds a lecture on\nthat's what kind of memberships are for\nthe money from memberships goes on to\nfund all of the other things that we do\nincluding all of our free content so\nwe're committed to trying to make Mental\nHealth Resources as accessible as\npossible but as we discussed on Friday\nbuild the more free stuff that you build\nthe more money that you need right which\nis I think sometimes something that\npeople miss out on so we're incredibly\ngrateful to everyone who just watches\nour videos who donates and stuff like\nthat um but a big part of what we really\ntry to do is deliver value when we ask\nyall for money so we're trying to offer\nsome\nvalue um so definitely check out\nmemberships the the lectures for this\nweek I mean this month are around male\nmental health so we did one lecture on\nmanaging expectations as a man this week\nwe're going to talk about um how to deal\nwith I think it's this week is it this\nweek or next week let me\nsee yep so this Wednesday so in two days\nwe're going to do a lecture on healthy\nversus toxic masculinity and where toxic\nmasculinity comes from and where healthy\nmasculinity comes from so um and then\nnext week we're going to have emotions\n101 for men so like how to understand\nemotions as a man and how emotions are\neven different for men and then on the\nlast week we're going to do a deep dive\ninto depression for men so what are the\nmale specific manifestations of\ndepression um so and then this month the\nreason we're focusing on male mental\nhealth is we pulled the community and\nthis is what people were interested in\nbut on starting on December 15th we get\nto vote or y'all get to vote for what we\ndo in the following month uh for those\nof y'all that are interested in more\nlong form content we some people were a\nlittle bit upset that we're pay Walling\nstuff that's not really Our intention\nwe're not reducing the amount of free\ncontent that we build in fact it funds\nall the free stuff that we do so that's\nkind of why we're doing it if y'all are\ninterested in that please sign up we'd\nreally appreciate your support and we\nhope that you'll get something out of\nit couple of other things um oh yeah and\nthen there's a second tier at $15 a\nmonth that is basically if youall want\nto give us extra money so you will get\naccess to certain features like right in\nthe fields or other beta tools that\nwe're developing before other people but\nreally if y'all want to support the work\nthat we're doing we're giving y'all a\nsecond option for that at 15 bucks a\nmonth um the goal of this is also to\nmake things more accessible so we you\nknow have other services like coaching\nor even Dr K's guide which is fantastic\nbut uh those are like 25 bucks uh a pop\nfor the guides so we tried to find\nsomething that's a little bit more\naffordable for people so if yall are\ninterested sign\nup um female mental health yes we're\ngoing to talk about that today actually\nso today we're doing something kind of\ncool we are talking about\nADHD and what we're talking about today\nis a little bit\ndifferent\nyeah so even other topics that are not\ngender centered I completely agree so I\ndon't know if you guys know this but\nlike 95% of the content that we make is\nnot gender specific it's just life stuff\nso today we're going to be talking about\nADHD there's going to be one segment\nthat we do that is gender specific which\nI think is really cool and fascinating\num which is the impact of ADHD and\nmenstrual cycles so how does menstrual\nhow do menstrual cycles affect ADHD but\nwe're going to talk about ADHD as a\nwhole so today what we're really doing\nis talking about ADHD but we're taking a\nparticular approach to it so as the\ninternet has grown and as platforms like\nTik Tok and YouTube shorts and Instagram\nreels and stuff like that start to come\nout we've seen a plethora of content\nabout this feature makes me\nADHD right so if you have this then you\nhave ADHD if you have trouble studying\nthen you've got ADHD if you sometimes\nforget where you put things then you\nhave ADHD so we have a lot of self\ndiagnosis and very like things where\npeople will say like if you've got this\nyou've got ADHD so today what we're\ngoing to do is dive through a lot of\nthese very common misconceptions and\ntalk about whether they are indicative\nof ADHD or not indicative of\nADHD um and so that's the goal for today\nso we're going to like jump through a\nbunch of different things that get\npropagated on social media as like I\nnever realized this was an ADHD thing\nokay and we're going to dive into the\nscience of it so for those of y'all that\nare interested in long form content we\nhope that today will satisfy you because\num we're going to really like dive into\na lot of the scientific features of\nvarious aspects of\nADHD\num\nokay wait it affects periods I had no\nidea yeah it's going to be cool I mean\nit's not cool it's unfortunate but um\ncan you also make specific content for\nwomen yes we have done that in the past\nand we will continue to do so and for\nthose of you that are interested in more\nlong form content we've got like 800\nvideos on our YouTube channel many of\nwhich are like over an hour in length so\ny'all should check those\nout um okay questions before we\nbegin how can I free myself from you I\nfreak out that I will miss out on\nbettering myself if I miss a video if\nyou disappear I'm scared I will fall\napart and I don't like this dependency\nyeah let me think about how to answer\nthat H how can I answer\nthat um yeah so it's not freeing\nyourself from me so let's understand\nthis when we have an insecurity our\ninsecurity will find a face for it to\nlatch onto so even if I Disappeared it\nmay be traumatic for a little while but\nthen you will find something else to be\ndependent on and so the reason that\npeople become dependent on Dr K is not\nbecause I'm the best thing since sliced\nbread I know it's crazy to say as a\nnarcissistic\nstreamer but sometimes in life if we\nfeel insecure about\nourselves we need someone else to lean\non and we start to think to ourselves\nthat as long as this person is here then\nI will be\nsafe right but this has nothing to do\nwith me or whoever the person is that\nyou're dependent on it has to do with\nthe fact that you are dependent on\nsomething you need to be dependent on\nsomething why because you lack faith in\nyourself that you can do it right\nwithout this pillar I will fall\napart and so the real way to fix this is\nto really recognize why you need someone\nelse to be there right why what would\nhappen if I cease to exist and how much\nof an impact do I really have I'm a\nrandom person on the internet who like\nis talking at you not even talking to\nyou right and how much impact can I have\nwe can teach you a lot I'm not saying\nthat we don't offer good educational\nresources but we're not out here like\nsaving lives right left and Center like\nwe sometimes people will say yeah you\nsaved my life or you changed my life or\nwhatever so we'll take that credit we're\nnot saying it doesn't happen but the key\nthing to understand is even if you say\noh Dr K you you changed my life it's not\nlike I was the only one who\ncould right so for someone to say okay\nyou changed my life that requires a lot\nof effort on your part in fact requires\nmore effort on your part than it does on\nmy part all I have to do is talk to a\ncamera or a computer screen and the rest\nof it is you so if you feel like someone\nis really good at helping you and that\nyou cannot survive without them I want\nyou to really pay attention to how much\nthey do and how much you do because\nchances are you do 90% of it they just\ngive you some guard rails they give you\na little bit of guidance they give you a\nlittle bit of direction but you're the\none who's doing all the\nwalking so it can feel scary to lose\nsomeone but trust in yourself even if\nyou lose the rest of the world at least\nyou'll have\nyou\nokay do you have a narcissistic per\npersonally Dr K personality y'all tell\nme chat is Dr K\nnarcissistic what do y'all\nthink um\nyeah I don't think I'm very narcissistic\nI'd guess that I'd test quite low on the\nnarcissism scale but maybe that's what\nall narcissists\nthink so you never\nknow\num okay oh yeah I mean there's so much\ngood stuff about autism all right so\nother stuff that we want to come up with\nI'm I'm working on a deep dive on on\nasexuality which I'm excited about but\nlet's\n[Music]\nstart okay let's do this one\nhere\nokay okay\nlet's get started what do y'all think\nshould we get\nstarted that's what anarc would say yeah\nso it looks like man I'm\nnarcissistic I'm a raging narcissist now\nhere's the question would a raging\nnarcissist admit they are a raging\nnarcissist probably not right so now\nthis is where we get to Schrodinger's\nnarcissist where if I don't say I'm a\nnarcissist I am a narcissist nist but if\nI say I'm a narcissist a narcissist\nwould never say\nthat so which is it chat oh my God oh my\nGod oh my God trapped you\nchat yeah it's really good so here's\nwhat I would say I am what I am if it is\na narcissist I accept it if if it is not\na narcissist I also accept it I am what\nI am and my goal is to try to be a\nlittle bit better today than I was\nyesterday so where I where I am is\nirrelevant the question is which\ndirection am I going do youall get that\nif every narcissist on the planet\nadopted my worldview then no narcissists\nwould\n[Laughter]\nexist right it's oh my God if everyone\njust did what I did oh my God all the\nnarcissist would\ndisappear everyone just needs to do what\nI'm doing and then they would be not as\nnarcissistic as I am right that's\ngood\num this is fun we can do this all day\nlong we can go as many rounds as y'all\nwant you guys like how at the first part\nof that before I started trolling yall\nyou're all like man that's so great like\nlook at this guy oh my God he's like he\nshould he should be an influencer\nbecause he's so positive any spread spot\noh my God that's right you just need to\nbe better than you who you are yesterday\nyeah let me gobble that [ __ ] up that\npositivity oh yeah baby let's\ngo um yeah I walked right into it you're\ndamn\nright how else am I supposed to have a\ngood time this isn't just about y'all's\nentertainment and education okay I get\nto have fun\ntoo is Alexa time you're related to ADHD\nwhat a great\nquestion\nokay\nlet's get started\num okay let me see stuff\nblindness\nokay oh\nwhoops okay let's\ndo all right so today what we're going\nto talk about is a number of things I\ndon't know what to get started with chat\nso I'm going to need your help I don't\nknow if there are mods around\nbut here are the things that we're going\nto cover ADHD things that are not in the\nDSM stuff blindness I left my vibrator\non the\nsyn that's going to get clipped out of\ncontext\nchat um or problems with authority and\nADHD thing I thought I'd outgrow that\nADHD annoyance but here I am at 24\nacting the same as I did at\n12 do you feel like an actual child eh\nokay we'll get to that cracking the\nseal um this is a good one is starting\nover several times in your life in ADHD\nthing is it ADHD to copy people's quirks\nand distracted during sex and then we\nalso have women with ADHD does your\nexecutive dysfunction depressive\nsymptoms get worse during your\nperiod which one do youall want to do\nchat any takers I'm going to randomly\nlook at stuff\num yeah the 12 one\nokay okay let's do\nit we're going to do all of it it's just\nwhat\norder what to join what a quote to join\non yeah\nwelcome time to have fun the vibrator\none please okay looks like someone is\nfarming clips for\nlsf\nokay two stuff blindness okay it looks\nlike most people want to do two or is it\nthe same people that are spamming things\noh my God I'm getting so taken advantage\nof that's fine we'll start with this one\nstuff\nblindness I once left my vibrator on the\nsink when having friends over for the\nevening anyone become totally blind to\nthings once they've been there for a day\nor two I don't have people over often\nbecause my house is usually a complete\nmess and I'm a bit of a Hermit however\nlast year I did have some friends over\nfor drinks smokes and board games all\nwent well had a great evening together\nand they went home I then realized when\nbrushing my teeth that my vibrator dildo\nthe rabbit type one I don't even know\nwhat that means I didn't realized there\nwere animal what does that even mean the\nrabbit type\none does that mean that there are dildos\nthat are modeled after various\nanimals had been set on the edge I feel\nlike I'm too innocent for the internet\nhad been set on the edge of the the sink\nthe whole time I had been to the toilet\na few times as had my friends and just\nhadn't noticed or I assume any of the\nlooks given to me my friends to alert me\nI assume they would do\nthis my stomach dropped when I realized\nand I spiraled into a massive meltdown\nbut now it's been like a year I find it\nhilarious\num\nokay so is stuff blindness with ADHD a\nthing now a lot of times what will\nhappen is you'll have someone who says\nlike oh my God is your house a mess do\nyour do you leave your vibrator on the\nsink if so you've got\nADHD is this a thing the answer is\nactually yeah yeah it's kind of a thing\nso let's understand a couple of things\nabout\nattention and the environment when it\ncomes to\nADHD so our brain has a couple of\ndifferent ways that it processes\ninformation it has something called top\ndown processing and it has something\ncalled bottom up processing so bottom up\nprocessing is when we sort of get lots\nof stimuli from the environment and then\nsomething gets floated to the surface\nokay and top- down processing is when we\ntell our mind to focus on a particular\nthing and that's what it focuses on so\nI'll give you all a simple example of\ntop down versus bottom up processing\nlet's say I'm going for a walk with my\nfriend and we are we are going on this\nwalk because my friend and I have both\nrecently gone through divorces knock on\nwood and we are commiserating about our\nfailed\nrelationships that's kind of scary but\nanyway so we're going there in my I've\ndecided that I am talking to my friend\nabout this so as I'm walking down the\nroad there is a snake that is on the\npath so in this moment I'm telling my\nmind to focus on one particular\nthing but then what happens is my mind\nis actually my brain is processing all\nkinds of external stimulus and then\neventually what'll happen is that the\nexternal stimulus that my mind is\nprocessing will break into my\nConsciousness so once I see a snake on\nthe road if I'm if my brain functions\nproperly it will alert me to the snake\nso now I want to go one place with my\nmind but my mind is saying hey there's\nthis stimulus out here that needs to\ndominate your attention and it Flags it\nin my brain and it says hey there's a\nsnake and so then I stop thinking about\nmy relationship and I start paying\nattention to the snake this is top down\nversus bottom up now the problem in ADHD\nis that we are more\ndistractable so if we are more\ndistractable what that means is that we\nneed very little actually let me just\npull this out I think it's going to be\ngo time\nchat hold on I'm going to redo this okay\nchat we're going to do this we're going\nto do this we're going to do this we're\ngoing to do this so let's let's redo\nthis I need to draw this out my\ndudes my friends bear with me for a\nmoment\nokay okay so let's take a look at this\nin ADHD we have top oh\nblue okay need\nwhite I'm\nOCD so we have top down\nprocessing and we have bottomup\nprocessing and these two things\ndetermine\nwhat is in our mind at a given moment so\nthis is when I tell my\nmind to\nFocus so the reason we call this top\ndown is because from the top you have\nthe dictator and you tell your mind hey\nthis is the direction we're going and\nthe mind is like okay if we're lucky and\nin bottom up processing we have sensory\ninputs that then we get alerted to so if\nI see a\nsnack this is a snake with a fork tongue\nthen it breaks into our mind okay now\nlet's take a look at how this is this\nsystem is different in\nADHD so in ADHD our top- down processing\nis\nweaker okay and what does that mean that\nmeans that our frontal loes so this is\nfrontal\nloes if we tell our brain to do\nsomething someone with\nADHD their brain has trouble following\nthe command right we're more vulnerable\nto distraction so we're more\ndistractable now if we we look\nat what does distractability\nmean that means that if I'm focusing on\none thing if I'm going in this\ndirection that a new sensory input can\nmake me go in this direction instead so\nnow that there's a new sensory input I\ncan't control my mind so what this sort\nof means is that the bottomup processing\nis way stronger in\nADHD and so what this literally means is\nthat it's easy for something in the\nenvironment to distract me so if you\nlook at kids who have ADHD for example\nyou try to get them to read a book but\nthen like a car drives by and they look\nat the car or someone walks by or they\nsee a lollipop over here and they run\nover there so they're highly\ndistractable they can't regulate their\nsensory\ninput so then what happens over time is\nwith ADHD we start to form an\nadapation where we learn that okay we're\nway too vulnerable to this and our top\ndown process is weak so instead what\nwe're going to do is we're going to\novercompensate and start to suppress\nstimuli from the environment so I'm\ngoing to start ignoring stuff okay and\nso then what ends up happening is to\ncompensate for this system we try to\nbecause this is what happens our brain\nhas a system of homeostasis so we always\nform a balance right so if I'm too\nexcited eventually I'm going to calm\ndown if I'm feeling very sad then\neventually I'm going to feel normal\nagain if my heart rate goes up my body's\ngoing to naturally bring it down if my\nheart rate dips too low I'm naturally\ngoing to bring it up so then what\nhappens is people with ADHD\ncompensate to the susceptibility of\nexternal stimuli by\nsuppressing external\nstimuli and then hopefully what happens\nis we will achieve some kind of balance\nnow the problem with this is that when\nwe suppress external stimuli what ends\nup happening is our place becomes a\nmess why because if you're a normal\nhuman and you walk into your like house\nand everything is a mess you get fed\nwith that information you're like man\nthis place is a mess I really need to\nclean it up but once you have ADHD you\nhave this compensatory suppression of\nexternal\nstimuli which then\nmeans that you ignore everything around\nyou except for if it is\nnovel so if there is something new in\nthe environment then with ADHD you will\npick it out right away over time we\nbegin to suppress it okay now there's an\neven bigger problem with this is that\nthis suppression of external\nstimuli takes cognitive\nresources so if you look at the brain\nwhat burns fuel in the brain the most is\nsuppressing things so if we suppress\nemotions that fatigues will it's one of\nthe number three um drain the three\nlargest drains of willpower include\nemotional suppression stress is a second\none I'm I'm blanking on what the third\none is at the moment they're three major\ndrains maybe internal\nconflict but the other thing that we\nknow is that suppressing all of this\njunk in your environment takes up\ncognitive resource\nwhat do we mean by take up cognitive res\nresources it actually makes our top down\nfocusing capability weaker so as we are\nsuppressing oh what\nthe where did this come from what on\nEarth\nwhat that's creeping me out a little\nbit okay speaking of suppressing sensory\nstimuli I don't even know what happened\nthere okay\nwhatever okay I don't know how to how do\nI delete\nthis okay I don't know we're going to\njust pretend it's not what\nthe okay I'm starting a new one that's\nfrightens me okay so when we have a\nmessy\nenvironment I'm\nsorry because it just showed up on my\ncomputer and he didn't know what a\nrabbit\nwas what the rabbit vibr didn't know\njust\naoke how did you insert it onto the\nbecause it's MyPad it's connected to my\ncomputer but why would it show up in my\nnotes because your Note is popping up on\nmy\nscreen so that has this showed up\nbecause of the the Rabbit vibrator yes I\ndon't even know how that works and\nthat's creeping me out and we'll worry\nabout that later because I'm trying to\ngive a lecture about ADHD and blindness\nokay all\nright okay so messy\nenvironment requires sensory\nsuppression okay sensory\nsuppression uses cognitive\nresources using of cognitive\nresources\nweakens or\ndrains our frontal\nloes which in turn makes it harder for\nus to\nfocus\nso you can absolutely end\nup with stuff blindness because we don't\nwe we suppress this stuff if it's in the\nenvironment for a while and the other\nkey tip\nhere is that if you want your brain to\nfunction better if you have ADHD you\nneed to clean your\nroom because even though you are not you\ndon't notice that stuff your brain is\nliterally suppressing all of that\nsensory input which is a cognitive load\nso there are studies I wonder if I can\nfind it I don't think I can find it um\nWR the second but there are studies that\nshow that when people with ADHD clean\ntheir\nroom that their capacity to study\nactually proves so if you study in a\nmessy space with an ADHD you literally\nhave less ability to focus on the task\nat hand right cuz when we're studying\nwe're using top down processing so we're\ntelling ourselves focus on this but\nthere's all this crap going on over here\nthat we're trying to suppress don't\nthink about that lamp don't think about\nthat male don't think about this don't\nthink about this don't think about this\njust think about this and so as the\nnumber of things that your brain has to\nnot think about in order to focus\nincreases we become more cognitively\nfatigued\nso stuff blindness is absolutely a thing\nand the most important thing that you\ncan do to fix stuff blindness is to\nclean your\nroom when we clean our room then what\nhappens is a new stimulus in the room if\nthere's a vibrator next to the sink my\nmind will flag that for me and it'll say\nhey there's a vibrator next to the sink\nbecause there's only one thing if\nthere's one thing in a pile of things\nit's hard to see it's like those those\nold books that have like where's Waldo\nand there's like a of all this crap and\nyou can't find Waldo because there's\n[ __ ] everywhere this is what it's like\nto be in a mind of an ADHD person\nwhere's the vibrator who the [ __ ] knows\nbecause there's an open toothpaste cap\nand there's a hairbrush and there's a\nhair in the sink and there's this thing\nover here and we're running out of\ntoilet paper and the trash can is full\nand like we can't find the vibrator\nwhere did it go who\nknows so if you want to fix this you got\nto clean things up as you clean things\nup a single thing that you put out of\nplace will get flagged in your mind and\nthen you can address it also has the\nadded advantage of anything else\nliterally anything that you try to do in\nyour house if your place is\nclean will allow you to focus more\nmental energy on\nit does that make sense and tontron is\nasking what did I just walk\ninto who the hell knows\nanymore who the hell knows sorry\nfriend Jordan Peterson took over Dr K\nyeah I mean I you know I don't know I\ndon't know how Jordan Peterson got\ncredit for this clean your room thing\nit's like cleaning your room is like a\ngood thing to do right\nlike can we just say can we just clean\nyour room man it's like it's a good\nthing for everyone\ninvolved okay questions about space\nblindness stuff blindness in\nADHD do you have ADHD Dr K I probably\nhave subclinical\nADHD what does subclinical mean that\nmeans that if I was tested as a kid when\nthings were not on certain days I may\nhave been diagnosed but on average I\ndon't think it's like so\nimpairing\num\nokay there's a question about can you\nrecommend a practice to heal alexiy I\nwould definitely check out our our video\non Alexia I think we've got various\nemotional stuff like emotional\nregulation techniques that we've taught\nin various places so um you can also\ncheck out like Dr K's guide to\nmeditation I want to say where do we\nhave alexithymic\nstuff um\nyeah or you can check out the YouTube\nvideo I'm sure we've we've done\nmeditations for alexiy in the\npast okay so people are asking what is\nsubclinical ADHD so if we look at ADHD\nand this is a big problem with kind of\nthe internet right right so people say\nif you have this feature then you have\nADHD but there's a problem with this way\nof thinking let's understand this okay\nso if we say for example that suicidal\nideation is a feature of major\ndepressive or bipolar\ndisorder that does not mean that\neveryone who has suicidal ideation has\nmajor depressive disorder or bipolar\ndisorder many human beings can\nexperience transient suicidal ideation\nin the absence of mental illness while\nsuicidal ideation is a feature of\ndepression not everyone who has suicidal\nideation is depressed and I'm using that\nas an extreme example on purpose so if\nwe look at something like\nADHD being blind to stuff doesn't mean\nyou have ADHD it is a feature of ADHD\nbut not everyone who is messy or is\nblind to stuff has ADHD right so\nsometimes you can be like even my wife\nand I will joke about having Uncle eyes\nso there's a saying in my culture that\nwomen look with their eyes and men look\nwith their voice now you may ask wonder\nwhat the hell there's a cultural\nsignificance to this so it's like you\nknow when my mom is looking for\nsomething she will like go and look for\nit but when my dad is looking for\nsomething he will be like\nhey Uma where is this thing he'll just\nask his wife right that's what Indian\nmen do is we just ask our wives where\neverything is this is called Uncle eyes\nbecause we can't see it it's like\nthey're like it's in the pantry and then\nI walk into the pantry and I look around\nand I like literally don't see it even\nthough it's right in front of me this is\nUncle eyes we're stuff blind so it's not\nthat all people who are blind to stuff\nhave ADHD you could also be an Indian\nuncle right so this is the big problem\nwith a lot of this self- diagnosis stuff\nwith ADHD all of these things may be a\nfeature of ADHD but just because you\nhave that feature does not mean that you\nhave\nADHD and so the way we Define having\nADHD is you have to have enough of the\nstuff to the point where it impairs your\ndaily life so I have a lot of this stuff\nbut it doesn't it's not so bad that it\nmakes it like impossible for me to\nfunction on a day-to-day basis so I get\nhighly distracted I can't sit down and\nlike read a book but I can like read a\npaper or like sometimes I can read like\na chapter here or there but it's really\nhard for me to sit down and read a book\nI mean sometimes I can I have to have\nthe right frame of mind whereas for\nother people it may be very easy for\nthem to sit down and just like read a\nbook so you can have a lot of those\nfeatures but if let's say you need like\nfive out of nine of these features most\ndays of the week I'm someone who has\nlike three or four of those features\nhalf the days of the week so I get close\nbut I'm probably not like I check a lot\nof the boxes but I probably don't\nwouldn't be\ndiagnosable the other problem with ADHD\nis that it requires an impairment of\nfunction so big reason why a lot of\npeople feel like they have ADH but\nwouldn't get diagnosed is actually\nbecause they have compensatory\nmechanisms so when everyone says I'm\nADHD they identify with this thing but\nthey are so good at compensating for it\neither through high IQ or developing\nhabits or whatever other systems they\ndevelop they develop things so to where\ntheir ADHD does not actually cause\nproblems it makes their life harder but\nthey've developed systems to protect\nthemselves from their ADHD which the\nmoment you start doing that you become\nundiagnosable because now we're no\nlonger impairing your function so I\nprobably have enough compensatory\nmechanisms in place including marrying\nsomeone who protects me from my\nADHD so this is what subclinical ADHD is\nthis is why everyone feels like they've\ngot it and they may not have\nit does that make\nsense\nokay why are symptoms of trauma\nsometimes similar to neurode Divergent\ndisorders oh man what a great question\nthis is a lit question love this\nquestion okay and then we're going to\nget to the other stuff we're going to\ntalk about\nthis so if we look at neurod divergent\ndisorders like\nADHD\noh man this is so good okay no insertion\nof bunny pick hopefully what's going on\nhere\nokay let us look\nat\nwhy\ntrauma and neurod\nDivergence look the\nsame okay so first let's understand\nneurod Divergence so in neurod\nDivergence we have a number of features\nabout our brain that are different so\nfor example we know that people who are\nneuro neurode Divergent have difficulty\nwith empathy okay so this is both\nADHD and autism spectrum disorder all\nright we also know that neurod Divergent\npeople okay so empath empathy have\ndifficulty with\nemotional\nawareness um so they they have\ndifficulty recognizing their\nemotions okay they also have difficulty\nwith emotional\nregulation so let's just dive into this\nthis is also ADHD and autism all of\nthese you guys want you guys want to see\nmy subclinical ADHD it's that I didn't\nclose this parenthesis you guys see that\nso let's just take one of these so let's\nlook at emotional\nregulation so we know that for example\nlet's see if this is here we go right so\nemotional is emotional regul\ndisregulation a component of attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder um is\nemotional disregulation is now known to\nplay a causal role in ADHD\nsymptomatology emotional disregulation\nis a primary symptom in adult attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder right so\nthere's a lot of papers that show that\nthis is the\ncase so what we know is that we have\ndifficulty regulating our emotions and\nif you're on the autism spectrum we know\nthat sometimes people on the autism\nspectrum can have like these meltdowns\nright they can have these like\ntemperature Tantrums or like autistic\nmeltdowns and stuff like that so we know\nthat uh emotional regulation is is\ndifficult so let's talk about a couple\nof other features ability to\nfocus so we can\nperseverate which means Focus way too\nmuch or become\ndistractable not focus enough both are\nfeatures of autism and\nADHD so this makes sense right now let's\nlook at trauma so the thing about trauma\nis trauma can do all of this stuff but\nthe mechanism is\ndifferent so as an example people with\ntrauma are prone to\ndissociation all right now why do people\nwith trauma dissociate let's understand\nthis so when I'm usually trauma starts\nin childhood so when I'm a\nkid and someone abuses me I feel bad\nemotionally but as a child as a\nsix-year-old child I can't do anything\nabout it right so I'm feeling hurt\nphysically emotionally whatever and then\nlike I can't fix the problem I have no\nagency so what ends up happening as a\nchild is that my brain discovers that we\nhave this ability to just stop feeling\nthings we're going to unplug our\nemotional circuitry and we literally do\nthis\nby\ndecreasing\nactivity in the corpus\ncolossum\nnow the Corpus kosum I don't know if\nyouall remember this but we've got two\nhemispheres in our brain and then we've\ngot this thing what\nthe we've got this thing that connects\nthe two hemispheres of our brain here's\nthe right brain which is emotions and\nhere's the left brain which is logic now\nif you guys are wondering why this is\nbackwards it's because anytime we do\nanatomical drawings we're looking from\nthe feet okay we're not anyway so this\nis right and this is left it's kind of\nconfusing so as we increase activity\nacross this we are able to analyze our\nsituation so we know what's going on but\nwe don't feel any emotions so we become\nfully left brained okay now when we do\nthis we no longer have awareness of our\ninternal emotional state that's what\ndissociation is I don't feel anything so\nnow we see that these two things can\nlook very\nsimilar to everyone right because the\nend experience is the same I don't know\nwhat I'm feeling I don't feel anything\neither I can be emotionally unaware or I\ncan be emotionally numb in both cases\nI'm not going to feel anything I I I\ndon't know what I'm feeling right does\nthat make sense but the mechanism is\ndifferent so this is where a lot of\npeople that I work with who think oh I'm\nAutistic or I'm ADHD you could have\ntrauma you may not actually be have ADHD\nor Autism and this is what's so\ndangerous about self diagnosis on the\ninternet the biggest problem with self-\ndiagnosis on the Internet is no one does\na differential diagnosis this is part of\ndiagnosis 101 so as medical doctors\nanytime there is a feature let's say I'm\ndistractible what we see on social media\nis people say oh if you get distracted\neasily you've got\nADHD yeah but the whole point the whole\nreason that you spend four years\nbecoming a medical doctor and then\nusually years after that training to be\nan actual you know life like alive\nphysici is because you learn all of the\nother things that can cause\ndistractability like substance use\ntrauma\nmenstruation right there're all kinds of\nthings that can cause distractability\ndementia\ndelirium developmentally\nappropriate and this is kind of the\nproblem with the WebMD diagnosis or the\ndrct Google right Google MD is that you\ncan search for a set of symptoms it'll\ngive you an answer but the tricky thing\nis that there's a thousand things that\ncan lead to distractability including\nthings like\ngrief and so which one of these is\nresponsible do you drink coffee every\nday do you use marijuana every day have\nyou been traumatized are you on your\nperiod do you have\ndementia right there there's all kinds\nof things that can cause distractability\nso when it comes to empathy so let's\njust run through a couple of these other\nones okay so also when we come to\ndissociation as we dissociate from\nourselves it becomes hard to form\nconnections with other people so I don't\nknow if this kind of makes sense but we\nalso have\ndepersonalization in trauma so\ndepersonalization is when my sense of\nmeanness disappears so I don't feel like\na person I feel like a robot I feel like\na an actor in a Play I Don't Like feel\nalive right I kind of it's weird I just\ndon't feel connected to myself which is\nalso a consequence of dissoci and\nthere's other stuff that goes on in the\nbrain but if you think about empathy\nempathy is me forming a connection with\nyou in order for the two of us to form a\nconnection I have to have a me in the\nfirst place so as I be depersonalize\nit's impossible for me to form empathy\nright because I can't form a connection\nbecause I I don't feel myself let's talk\nabout emotional regulation or\ndisregulation so here's the mechanism in\nADHD okay so we have our amydala\nin our lyic\nsystem this is where emotions come\nfrom okay and then we have our frontal\nloes which inhibit our emotions so when\nI'm feeling\nangry I will I will say Okay Alo take a\ndeep breath calm down it's not the end\nof the world that is my frontal loes\ncontrolling my emotional circuitry\nthis\nconnection is weak in ADHD it's very\nweak so I am not as good at controlling\nmy\nemotions now let's take a look at\ntrauma so what we know from trauma is\nthat since I spend so much\ntime suppressing\nthings what ends up happening is I don't\nget I don't get good at controlling it\nbecause I don't know if this kind of\nmakes sense but like you know if I just\nmake things disappear through\ndissociation I'm not going to be good at\ncontrolling them when they show up so\nthere's like a difference let's say I\nhave a dog if I live with the dog every\nday and I focus on training the dog\nevery day the dog will be obedient but\nif anytime the dog acts up I go and I\nlock it in a closet or I go put it out\nin the barn and I never like learn how\nto regulate it every time the dog shows\nup it's not going to listen to me\nbecause I never spend any time training\nit so what happens in people who are\ntraumatized is they get bad at\nregulating their emotions because they\nsuppress their emotions so much and they\nalso have emotional regulation problems\nbecause the emotions that they feel are\nmore profound and this has to do with\nphysiology so their physiologic state is\nso wired towards tension high levels of\nsympathetic nervous system activity high\nlevels of adrenaline and\ncortisol and these two hormones\nactivate negative\nemotions they stimulate our danger\ncircuits of the brain our survival\ncircuits of the brain so in the case of\nADHD we have difficulty regulating but\nin the case of trauma these things are\nhyperactive the result is the same we\ndon't we have difficulty regulating our\nemotions now let's talk about ability to\nfocus\nokay so in the case of ability to focus\nlike we know that this is a core feature\nof ADHD but this is also a core feature\nof trauma and the reason that\ndistractability and is difficult or is a\nfeature of trauma is the mechanism is a\nlittle bit\ndifferent okay so in the case of trauma\nthere's all kinds of cognitive stuff\nthat goes on so the first is this is\ngoing to this is could to be a whole\nlecture and of\nitself\nso this gets more complicated probably\nthan we have time for but I'll give it a\nshot so if we look at\ntrauma a key aspect of trauma is\nsomething called coercive\ncontrol and what coercive control means\nis that you grow up in an environment\nwhere you don't get to control things\nsomeone else is controlling stuff for\nyou so for example I can make plans with\nmy friends and I can say hey do you all\nwant to come over for a sleep over this\nweekend but then if I have like a very\ncontrolling parent you know I made these\nplans I asked for permission but my\nparent is pissed that day so they force\nme to cancel the plans they always\ncontrol my life they don't let me exert\ncontrol and in the worst cases when I\ntry to exert control they will punish me\nfor it so they take away my control so\nif you grow up if your brain grows up in\nan environment without\ncontrol without\nagency there is no point in planning\ntowards the future right because every\ntime I make plans for the future someone\ntakes away my control so there's there's\nno point in planning for the future in\nfact planning for the future becomes a\nsource of pain because now I have these\nhopes now I have these expectations and\nmy parent is never going to let me enjoy\nthat they're going to try to control\nthey're going to try to suppress they're\ngoing to try to abuse\nwhatever so then what happens if we\ndon't plan for the\nfuture\nthere is no point in focusing so if we\nreally I know it sounds kind of weird\nbut I want you all to think about this\nwhen do you need to focus you need to\nfocus for the future not for the present\nlet's just come up with a thousand\nexamples why do I need to focus on\nstudying because I have a test on\nFriday why do I need to pay attention in\nclass because I have a test on\nFriday why do I need to pay attention in\nthis meeting at work so that I can get\npromoted so I can advance so our our\ndesire to reign in our impulses in focus\nis always future focused it's for some\nbenefit in the future if it was fun in\nthe present then I wouldn't have to pull\nmyself in right it's easy to focus on a\nvideo game because a video game has\nnothing to do with the future in fact it\nsabotages the future but the second that\nsomeone with trauma tries to focus on\nsomething that benefits them in the\nfuture their brain just Rebels and why\ndoes it Rebel it's because that part of\nthe brain has become\natrophied because we learned a long time\nago that sacrificing today for tomorrow\nis a waste of time because when I spent\nall of my chore money I I've saved up\nall of this money and I bought this\nPlayStation and my drunk dad on\nChristmas morning because I was playing\nPlayStation instead of came down and set\nthe table they walked upstairs they\npicked up the PlayStation and they\nsmashed it on the ground and broke it\napart with a hammer why the [ __ ] would I\never want to sacrifice anything today\nfor\ntomorrow and then I have to study for a\ntest when I'm 22 years old because I've\nfailed one year of college and I'm still\na\njunior and now I try to get my mind to\nfocus and it doesn't want to because it\nlearned a long time ago that it's a\nwaste of\ntime does this mean I have ADHD\nabsolutely\nnot it just means that I have cognitive\nconsequences of\ntrauma so there's a ton of overlap\nbetween ADHD and Trauma it can look the\nsame but this is what youall need to\nunderstand about mental health or mental\ndiagnoses there are symptoms and there\nare ideologies the ideology is the cause\nand the symptom is what it looks\nlike and the problem is that we take a\nlist of symptoms and we are self-\ndiagnosing because I have difficulty\nfocusing that means I have\nADHD and the biggest trag there is that\nthe reason that 90% of people have\ndifficulty focusing in today's\nenvironment is because we were never\ntaught how to\nfocus focus is literally a skill of the\nmind that is trained in Ancient\nIndia they used to send students to this\nplace called I think a Vidya pit they\nused to send them to the monastery where\nthey were trained by monks to focus so\nthey learned about mathematics and\nliterature and Medicine and they also\nlearned so medicine was a core part of\nthe curriculum by the way just like\nhistory or\nmath as was focusing class where they\nteach you how to learn what is the\nmechanism of memory how do you optimize\nmemory it's crazy that we don't teach\nthis stuff and so just because you have\ndifficulty focusing doesn't mean that\nyou have ADHD it could be\ntrauma it could be substance related and\nit could be that you just never\nlearned does that make sense\nokay all right so by the way so we're\ngoing to uh talk about a lot of this\nstuff today but if yall are interested\nin more info two things one is that\nwe've got a guide to ADHD and doing\nstuff which hopefully will teach youall\nlike the mechanism through which\nthe Mind does things like so how do you\nactually get yourself to do stuff we try\nto break that down okay and then we've\ngot several videos on ADHD on our\nYouTube channel so y'all can watch all\nthose stuff about ADHD and depression\nand all that kind of stuff we're going\nto cover a lot of it today and the last\nthing is if youall want more content on\nthis that's like deep dive let us know\nin some way so we'll do more Deep dive\ncontent on stream and stuff like that if\nyall ask for it but the this the fastest\nway to get it is to become a member and\nvote for it so you all decide what we\nwhat we build content on as\nmembers\nokay okay what so someone's asking a\nquestion what would it look like if\nsomeone had ADHD and suffered trauma in\nthe past it would look like\nADHD and so here's the crazy\nthing so someone did a study so we have\na a a whole YouTube video about this\nokay about ADHD and depression we also\ngo into it in the guide but the the\nYouTube video is pretty in\ndepth so growing up with ADHD means\ngrowing up with trauma in at least 70%\nof\ncases so this is confusing for a lot of\npeople what does that mean what do you\nmean so when you a child with\nADHD and you grow up in a neurotypical\nsociety you are\ntraumatized because your your brain\ndoesn't work the way that everybody else\nis does\nso for example there's some studies that\nshow that by the second grade a child\nwith ADHD will get invited to a total of\nzero birthday\nparties because when you're at the\nplayground and you're a first grader you\ndon't wait for your turn in line you go\ndown the slide there's a line of four\nkids and you cut right to the front and\nthen you bowl someone out of the way and\nthen you climb up and you go down again\nthe other kids don't like you because\nyou're impulsive you don't understand\nthat you even did anything wrong you\ndon't even see the other kids you're\nlike that was fun let's do it again\nbut the other kids see that and then\nthey don't invite you to birthday\nparties and then what comes what ends up\nhappening is you don't get invited to\nthe birthday party you don't get invited\nto\nany and then Monday morning rolls around\nand all the kids are talking about wow\nit was so much fun having I had so much\nfun at your birthday party and you're\nleft out boom isolated no friends\ntraumatized so if you look at a comorbid\npopulation of people who have ADHD and a\nmood disorder like major depressive\ndisorder\n3% of people who have depression will\ngrow up to have\nADHD 70% of people who have ADHD first\nwill grow up to have depression there is\na very clear causitive link between\ngrowing up with ADHD and having\nself-esteem problems in the\nfuture and the reason for that I'll give\nyou all just another reason because you\nknow if you're ADHD that your intellect\nis good you know you're not stupid or\nthan the other kids but for some reason\nyou cannot do what the other kids do you\nknow that you're just as smart as your\nfriend but your friend gets an A and you\nget an f and then you don't know what's\nwrong with you but there must be\nsomething wrong with you something\nreally bad because you can do it\nsometimes you've been able to do it\nbefore you've gotten an A on a test\nthere are times where you've been able\nto sit down and study and you've done\nawesome but why can't you do it it again\nall you want is to do it again but you\ncan't and as you don't understand that\nyou start to have self-esteem problems\nbecause what's wrong if you're just as\nsmart as they are then you must have\nsome kind of horrible debuff or some\nterrible character trait that just makes\nyou randomly 50% chance that if you make\na successful skill check you fail anyway\nyou feel\ncursed and this carries with you in your\nself self-esteem because I'm\nfundamentally busted in some way because\nI'm just as smart as everybody else but\nI can't do what people do so I must be\nbusted I just need to pay attention more\nvery good people will say things like\nthat or if he or she applied themselves\nif they actually\ntried they could do so much better\nyou'll hear these kinds of statements\nlike that and so then what does a child\nbelieve a child believes oh I'm someone\nwho's lazy I'm someone who doesn't try\nwhen the truth of the matter is that you\nactually try 10 times as\nhard but then what happens happens is\nyou start to form an identity I a lazy\nkid with ADH you don't think about ahd\nyou diagnose yourself with laziness that\nbecomes a part of who you are and then\nhere's the really damning Thing Once you\nhave an identity of being lazy as you\ntry to go and do things your mind tells\nyou oh you can't do that because you're\na lazy person going to the gym is for\npeople who aren't lazy but you are lazy\ntherefore you're not going to succeed at\nthe gym and so there's a thousand\ndifferent things that you could do in\nlife\nwhat your mind tells you you will fail\nat because you are\nlazy so this is the tricky thing that a\nlot of people don't\nunderstand people think that your future\nis determined by who you\nare the truth of the matter is who you\nsorry people think\nthat what you do is determined by who\nyou\nare right if if I'm a lazy person it\nwill determine what I do or don't do the\ntruth is it's the other way around what\nyou do determines who you\nare we get that mixed up and it's\ndevastating because we let our idea of\nourselves Define what we're capable\nof I'm unathletic I'm\nlazy I'm not graceful I don't know how\nto dance I don't know how to sing that's\nnot for me and so then you never try and\nthen that becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy the more self-fulfilling of a\nprophecy it becomes the more you believe\nit clearly you're right right because\nthat one time that you were forced into\nkaraoke you did such a bad job holy [ __ ]\nyou're so bad at\nsinging it is not who you are that\ndetermines what you do it is what you do\nthat determines who you are it's\nactually all in your\ncontrol and this is the real tragedy of\nlife\nis that you can fix\nit but you have taught yourself or\nSociety has led you to believe that you\nare\npowerless and this is what we've learned\nscientifically when we work with\npatients with\ntrauma the real tragedy of trauma is\nthat when someone is in an abusive\nrelationship they have a lot more power\nthan they realize the reason they stay\nin an Abus of relationship is because\nthey have been taught to believe that\nthey have no\npower and when you give up your own\npower in a\nrelationship that's when you lose\ncontrol of the relationship when you\ngive up your own agency in life when you\nsay that oh the world is a terrible\nplace and I am unhappy because of\ninflation or climate change or political\ndiscourse or War right I'm not saying\nthat those problems aren't real they're\nabsolutely real and they control huge\naspects of our lives so we can't do\nanything anything about that\nright\nnaturally but the moment we say there is\nnothing I can do we are surrendering\nwhat little power we have we are\nsurrendering what little control we have\nand that's the real tragedy is you don't\nknow exactly what you're capable of\nuntil you actually\ntry\nokay okay so people are asking okay what\ndo you do about it all right so I'm\ngonna ask youall do we have mods in chat\ncan we do a quick poll so I want to ask\ny'all let me just look\nat okay we've got\ntime\num so here's what I want to know\ndo you guys want to answer questions\nfrom chat or do you all want\nto go over the various posts that we've\ngot what's a better use of our\ntime if there are mods around mods may\nnot be around we'll see I don't know how\nto do this stuff on on\nYouTube\nso someone's oh my God so\nhard posts okay people want to do\nposts um thank youall very much for\nsigning up for membership okay everyone\nwants to do\nposts okay oh thank you\nmods y'all are the real heroes and\nheroins go over post okay everyone wants\nto go over post okay so if you guys have\nquestions um\none thing to keep in mind is that so we\nknow that people have questions we try\nto answer some of them here but youall\nget to decide so we have a special Q&A\nportion uh for members like so once a\nmonth we're going to do like a stream or\nsomething like that where we focus\nspecifically on\nQ&A um and but people want to go over\npost so that's what we're going to do\nokay so y all\ndecide all\nright\num okay so this one let's look\nat\nokay I feel\nlike some of this stuff we kind of\ncovered so it's emotional\ndisregulation okay let's talk about\nAuthority are problems with authority an\nADHD thing tldr is in the title read on\nfor details since I was a kid I've\nalways struggled with authority it's\nmostly when someone in a position of\nauthority teacher boss Etc makes me do\nstuff that I don't find reasonable or\nfair and I'm wondering if this is an\nADHD thing the only example I can think\nof right now is my third grade teacher\ntrying to make me learn curse of\nhandwriting which I refused because\nregular handwriting was doing the job\njust fine and I didn't see the need\nturned into a big argument and I got in\ntrouble as an adult the arguments are\nrare and I just bottle up my anger\ninside but it's still a problem because\nit makes me hate my boss and causes me\nto act rebellious do you guys also have\nexperience this and do you have any\nadvice to make oneself care less about\nit great question so do people with ADHD\nhave a problem with\nauthority so from the get-go the first\nthing what we're going to\nsay we're going to REM remind ourselves\nthat problems with\nauthority\nhave a differential diagnosis so there\nare many things that give us a problem\nwith authority so for example having a\nnarcissistic\npersonality will give you problems with\nauthority having some different kinds of\nuh so let's called um what is it\nOppositional\ndefiant\ndisorder can result in problems with\nauthority okay there are all kinds of\nthings that can result in problems with\nauthority including\nADHD so let's understand how ADHD leads\nto problems with\nauthority so the first reason that ADHD\nleads to problems with authority is\nbecause\nADHD leads to\nemotional regulation\ndeficits so people with ADHD so let's\njust take a quick look at\nthis okay so emotional libility which\nmeans experiencing a lot of powerful\nemotions can result from different\nneurobiological\nmechanisms um we go into all this kind\nof stuff but basically what what happens\nis\num if you were a kid with 80 DD you will\nhave difficulty regulating your emotions\nyour frontal\nloes which are your control circuits of\nthe brain have difficulty inhibiting\nyour\nemotions so kids with ADHD will feel\nmore\nemotions more\nrapidly so the onset of emotion is quick\nand less ability to control\nthem so now let's think about what this\nwould what this this does when we\nhave a situation with authority so if\nit's easier for me to get pissed and\nit's harder for me to control my anger\nthe likelihood that I will talk back to\nmy teacher or parents increases right\nbecause I get angry and then anyone who\ngets angry and talks back is going to\nhave problems with that authority figure\nthe problem is that that happens way\nmore with kids with\nADHD which in turn then means that the\nkid with ADHD starts to get a reputation\nthis little [ __ ] this little defiant\nlittle prick this little kid who doesn't\nlisten this kid throws temper tantrums\nthis is a bad\nkid and if you get a kid who's\ndisobedient and gets angry all the time\nwhat are you going to do as an authority\nfigure you're going to clamp\ndown exert your Authority more this\nperson gets fewer passes this\nDisobedience needs to be worked out of\nthem other kids get Second Chances but\nthis little [ __ ]\nhell no we can't give this kid an inch\nhe'll take a mile so this is Source\nnumber one for problems of\nauthority but it gets worse so Source\nnumber two of problems with authority\nespecially in school settings is that\nADHD kids are class\nclowns so we have to understand this\nwhen you're an ADHD kid you have\ndifficulty forming\nrelationships why do you have difficulty\nforming relationships\nnumber one you don't have to pay\nattention you can't pay attention so if\nI'm having a conversation with a friend\nof mine and I'm zoning in and out like I\ncan't participate in the conversation\nand then the friend is going to be like\ndoesn't enjoy talking to me because I'm\nnot paying\nattention or what happens is when I'm in\na group of kids I'm\nimpulsive and I interrupt people when\nthey're talking\nso why would anyone want to talk to me\nso\nlike this is all going to lead to social\nisolation last thing is when I'm on the\nplayground or I'm playing a board game\nwith someone I'm not paying attention to\nthe rules I cut in line because I'm\nimpulsive and this is where we get back\nto kids with ADHD some studies show that\nthey get invited to zero birthday\nparties by the second\ngrade right why is that it's because I\nkeep cutting on line I don't wait my\nturn it's hard to play a board game with\nme so kids don't like me so this leads\nto social\nisolation so now I've got no friends no\none likes me I get made fun of a lot I\nhave a low social ranking how do I fix\nthat by being a Class Clown because no\none wants to play with me\nbut when the teacher calls on me and\nsays little Alo what is 6 plus 7 and I\nsay poo poo pee PE and every everyone\nlaughs I don't even know what the\n[ __ ] question was so I couldn't\nanswer it if I wanted to so I'm screwed\nI'm not going to know the right answer\nso what do I do I just say pooo\npooo and then the teacher gets mad at me\nbut everybody else starts laughing and\nsuddenly my social isolation has\nimproved increas in social\nstanding so as I form Defiance to the\nteacher all the other kids like it and\nit's not like I'm going to know the\nanswer anyway so this is the second\nreason why ADHD kids are defiant to\nAuthority will compromise our\nrelationship with our teacher which is\npretty bad to begin with and at least\nthe other kids will like\nme this is also why people with ADHD\nmake really good streamers because we're\nhilarious because we don't know what the\nhell is going on we can look at two\ncomments from chat and we can make some\nstupid ass joke it makes us very\neffective at streaming because we know\nhow to be spontaneously funny\nokay uh reason number three oh\nyeah so\noh reason number three now this is the\none that is really hard to understand\nfor young kids so let's take a look at\nthis example the only example I can\nthink of right now is my third grade\nteacher trying to make me learn cursive\nhandwriting which I refused because\nregular handwriting was doing the job\njust fine and I didn't see the need this\nis sort of incorrect\ninterpretation so I want you all to\nthink about the mind of a third grader\nright this is an 8-year-old kid when an\n8-year-old kid says I don't want to do\nsomething they don't use\nlogic I refused because regular\nhandwriting no they're not like doing a\nlogical analysis and then they decide oh\nmy God like this is not a good use of my\ntime therefore I respectfully disagree\nwith the fact that I need to learn this\ntherefore I'm not going to learn cursive\nthat's not actually what happens you\nmake logical arguments once once you\nhave a fully developed brain a third\ngrader doesn't know how to make a\nlogical argument they come up with some\nrationale but that's not how their mind\nworks this is\nemotional so what happens with a third\ngrader with\nADHD\nis they look at learning\ncursive and they think this is hard I'm\nnot\ngoing to be\nable to do\nthis this is\nboring I'm G to\nfail this makes me\nangry there's no way I'm going to learn\nthis [ __ ] that's really what the third\ngrader is thinking because they've\nlearned by this point in the third grade\nthat they can't focus on stuff right\nthey already know they have an\nimpairment and anytime we ask a kid with\nADHD to learn cursive they realize\nsubconsciously I'm going to fail at this\nthat makes them very angry and very\nashamed so how can I avoid failure when\nI know I can't focus I can't my hand\ndoesn't write this way I don't know how\nto do this I don't know what's going on\nI'm going to fail no matter what so what\nthey choose to do is not play the game\nthey say [ __ ] you I'm not going to do\nthis and this creates problems with\nauthority so people with\nADHD create problems with authority when\nthey subconsciously know they're going\nto fail at a\ntask and so it's very common for people\nwith ADHD to have problems with\nauthority but we have to understand why\nthese problems happen there's a\nfundamental difficulty with emotional\nregulation which means that Authority\ndoesn't like\nus the second thing is we learn that as\nwe become socially isolated one way to\nRally the people is in defiance of\nauthority so so I learn very early on\nthat the only way the other kids will\nlike me is if I say [ __ ] you to the\nteacher cuz then everybody laughs and I\ngo to detention and the third thing is\nthat in a neurotypical world Authority\ntells me to do something that I know I'm\ngoing to\nfail and no third grader let alone\n30-year-old is going to willingly sign\nup for a task that they know they are\ngoing to\nfail right you do that you don't like\nsign up for Olympic swimming tryouts\nknowing that you're going to get\ncrushed you don't go compete at you\ndon't try out to be a cheerleader for\nthe Dallas Cowboys knowing you're going\nto get crushed we do things that we\nthink we can succeed at and if we think\nwe can we're going to fail at something\nwe try to bow out but as a third grader\nyou don't know how to do that in a\nhealthy way you don't know how to tell\nthe you don't even not even whereare you\ncan't say to the teacher hey I I feel\nlike I'm afraid that I'm going to fail\nat this and I'm afraid that all the\nother kids are going to make fun of me\nbecause I'm not going to be able to\nfocus my mind and learn\ncursive therefore can you please help me\nthe third grader doesn't have the\nawareness of that so they say no I'm not\ngoing to do it they know instinctively\nthat they're going to fail and they just\nRebel the way that they know how which\ngets perceived as a problem with\nauthority but even if you have all of\nthese things I don't want yall to think\neveryone with a problem with authority\nhas ADHD because there are many reasons\nthat people have have problems with\nauthority another thing that we didn't\nconsider on the differential diagnosis\nis I have parents who are powerful this\ncreates problems with authority all the\ntime because when I go toe to to Toe\nwith the teacher the teacher says you\nfailed this class and then Mommy and\nDaddy show up and they they threaten to\nsue the principal principal goes to\nteacher and says give him a b and then\nteacher comes and says you get a b and\nthen the kid is like great I'm I'm GL\nglad you learned your lesson\n[ __ ] next time you better give me an A\nso there are all kinds of reasons that\nlead to a problem with authority but it\ncan absolutely happen consistently with\nADHD okay\nnext\nall\nright\num me see which one do we want to do\nokay let's do this one is starting over\nseveral times in your life an ADHD thing\nI just got diagnosed in my 30s and\nthroughout my life I've lost contact\nwith 98% of my friends due to moving\naround and switching between different\njobs and focus areas I went to high\nschool in another city lost Conta with\nmost of my primary school friends I\njoined the army lost contact with most\nof my high school friends I went to\nUniversity lost contact with most of my\nArmy buddies I moved to a different city\nfor work and lost contact with most of\nmy University friends and so it has\ncontinued it is not just losing friends\nbut I also feel like I have taken on\nwhole new personalities when I switched\nsettings I've done a lot of thinking\ninto this in the past and luckily my so\nhas kept me grounded for the past decade\nbut I cannot help but wonder whether\nthis was actually an ADH thing all\nalong\nokay um thank you all so much for your\ncomments it is overwhelming to see how\nmany people relate to this the\nrelationship between Wanderlust Gene and\nADHD plus ADHD masking seem to explain a\nlot of a lot and I will definitely be\nlooking more into that so the first\nthing to\nunderstand is that just because\nsomething happens in ADHD does not mean\nthat if that thing happens you have ADHD\nright so people with ADHD may start over\na lot but just because you start over a\nlot does not mean that you necessarily\nhave ADHD there's a differential\ndiagnosis so another good example of\nthis is the Wanderlust Gene right so\nwhatever they're talking about here but\nthis is what I mean so some people just\nhave this Wanderlust Gene and they just\nmove on from place to place I'm like\nthat okay so let's just talk about\npersonality versus\nADHD so this is where I personally like\nthe IR conception I find it to be very\nhelpful so ayurva is traditional Indian\nmedicine and ayurva posits is different\nfrom Western medicine for a couple of\nreasons the first major reason that it's\nfundamentally different is that it\nassumes that not all people are the same\nso I know it sounds weird but doesn't\nWestern medicine assume that people are\ndifferent no right so like if I diagnose\nyou with ADHD you have\nADHD and other people who have ADHD or\nwe all have ADHD and so there set\ncriteria for ADHD it is not that ADHD is\nindividual in a person there is an\nisolated disease process which has an\nisolated treatment and the person is\ndoesn't factor in so I know it sounds\nkind of weird but let's take a look at\nthe way that Western science studies\nthings okay so we use these things\ncalled randomized controlled trials and\nwhat randomized controlled trials mean\nis that we try to remove the\nindividuality from The Trial\nwe try to take populations that have 50%\nmen and 50% women old people young\npeople we try to remove all\nindividuality that's what the controlled\nis we try to control for all individual\nfactors so that we can isolate the\ndisease process and the treatment and\nremoving individuality from the equation\nthat's literally how we do things we\nremove\nindividuality so when we ask okay what\nare the diet recommendations that\nWestern science recommends it is the\nsame recommendations for everybody right\n2,000 calories a day high fiber low\nsugar medium amount of protein lots of\nfresh fruits and vegetables everyone\nshould eat the same things whereas in\nayura they say different people\ndepending on your Constitution should be\neating different\nthings so they believe that people are\ndifferent now this is where I like the\nayurvedic conception of something called\nVata so there are some people who have a\npersonality that is Vata and Vata is\nmade up of two elements wind and ether\nwe're going to gloss over ether for now\nbut Vata people are like the\nwind and what does that mean so if you\nlook at the wind the wind is cold it's\ndry it's strong it's inconsistent it\nblows really hard in One Direction and\nthen it dies down and then it blows\nreally hard in another Direction and\nthen that stops and now we're blowing\nover here and now we're blowing over\nhere and now we're blowing over here\nthat is different from someone who has a\npersonality like fire which is another\none of the doas so fire is steady stable\nin One Direction if a fire starts on\nthis end of the forest there's only one\ndirection it's going to go right it\ndoesn't randomly decide to change\ndirections or stop or die down or\nanything like that we're starting in one\ndirection we're going to plow forward in\nthat\ndirection so when I was struggling in\nlife so just to give you all an example\nmy freshman year of college I ran for\nstudent government I joined a\nfundraising organization I joined a\nfraternity I joined a like a science\nCouncil like I did all this random\ncrap I joined like a cultural\norganization so I did like a thousand\ndifferent things because I was like so\nexcited and I want to do a bunch of\nrandom stuff because my mind is like the\nwind I get excited about this I move in\nthis direction I get excited about this\nI move in this direction even if you\nlook at my life today well we'll get to\nthat in a second\nso then what happened is my dad told me\nhey Alo you're failing all your classes\noh I also signed up for Japanese Spanish\nphilosophy and science classes and I was\nPremed and I just took a bunch of random\nclasses and so I failed basically all my\nclasses my first year my dad tells me\nhey you're trying to do too many\ndifferent things you need to focus on\none thing right you're too distracted\nyou're doing like a thousand different\nthings just do fewer things and so I\nsaid okay Dad you're right so then I cut\ndown the things that I cut out all the\nextracurriculars still failed a lot my\nsecond semester of my sophomore year I\neven cut down to half a normal class\nload I'm still doing too much still\nfailed a lot so then I went to\nIndia and someone there listened to the\nstory and they started laughing an iic\ndoctor and they said that is a terrible\nidea I said what do you mean he's like\nwhat was your experience as you started\ncutting things out did it become easier\nto do the remaining things and I was\nlike\nno so even when you were taking two\nclasses instead of a normal load of five\ncould you focus no I couldn't focus why\nnot well I got bored I got bored very\neasily and he's like yes that's correct\nso he said your mind is like the wind\nand it'll get bored very easily so what\nyou need to do is find the right balance\nof as many different things that you can\ndo so imagine you're juggling a few\nballs and try to juggle as many balls as\nyou can without dropping a single\none so you need Variety in your day you\nneed to be trying to do as many\ndifferent things as you can without\nscrewing up so don't overdo it which is\nwhat I did at the very beginning but\nrecognize that\nvariety is actually that novelty will\nget keep you excited if you do the same\nthing over and over and over again\nyou're going to get\nbored this is the Vata mind and once I\ngot this piece of advice it changed the\nway that I lived my\nlife so now for example\nI see patience for 5 to 10 hours a week\nI stream and make content for some hours\na week I wrote a book I go and I give\ntalks I do workshops I go and am a guest\non\npodcasts so I find that the more variety\nI have in my life the more I excel at\neach of those things whereas there are\nother people who are like kind of like\nthe fire right their personality is like\nI'm going to do one thing and I'm going\nto go in One Direction I get\nbored so this Wanderlust gene or this\naspect of starting over over and over\nand again is a feature of ADHD or the\nVata personality and Vata and ADHD are\nhighly\ncorrelated okay it's just a different\nconception and so often times what we\nwill do is start over and I did the same\nthing I had a group of friends in high\nschool I went to college left them\nbehind graduated college moved to Boston\nstarted med school make a brand new set\nof friends go to residency make a brand\nnew set of friends leave residency now\nI'm back where I grew up and now I'm\nmaking a new set of\nfriends this is very\nnormal if you have Vata if this is your\npersonality because you enjoy variety\ndoesn't mean that you've necessarily got\nADHD this is just a personality thing\nnow the the reason that it correlates\nwith ADHD is people have hi\nVata have are very close to having ADHD\nand there's an overlap between hiat and\nADHD but I would say that if you start\nthings over over and over and over again\nthat's very normal there's nothing wrong\nwith it now the real question becomes\nhow do I make progress if I get bored\neasily and I switch what I want to do so\nthis is where I have one really\ninteresting\ntrick which is that I find that when I\nget bored of something I can set it down\nbut then if I come back to it later I\nwill be just as interested so the\nbiggest problem that people with with hi\nVata make so if you're someone who's got\nADHD quote unquote\nis so how can you become consistently\ngood at something if you get bored very\neasily okay so let's take a look at this\nso here's what we have we have ADHD or\ncall it the Wanderlust\ngene or fata okay I'm kind of using\nthese three terms\ninterchangeably so here's what happens I\nstart with thing number one and then I\nget bored of that and I go to thing\nnumber two and then I get bored of that\nand I go to thing number three I get\nbarded of that go thing number four\nget barded of that thing number five get\nbarded of that thing number\nsix so here's the\ntrick by the time you finish thing\nnumber three if you actually go back and\nyou redo one you'll be just as\ninterested so then we're going to get\nbetter at one and by the time I'm done\nwith one I'm going to go back to two and\nthis will be interesting again and then\nI'm going to go back to three and this\nwill be interesting again and then I'm\ngoing to go back to one and I'm going to\ngo to two and I'm going to go to three\nso this is the difference between what\nhappens in this standard case which is\nthat we just get one check here one\ncheck here one check here then we go we\ndo something else so you end up digging\na thousand Wells that are one foot\ndeep now here's the crazy\nthing the cool thing is that if you do\nthis you will actually\noutperform the people who are slow and\nsteady wins the race because you have\nmore total energy your excitement is\nworth so much so if you have this wander\nlust gene or ADHD you can accomplish\nwhat takes other people a week you can\ndo it in one day if your excitement is\nat the right level so what I encourage\nyou all to do is harness that excitement\nand then people may Wonder Dr K how are\nyou able to do so much I see patience I\nmake content I write books I go on\npodcasts I do all this stuff right I'm a\nstreamer I was faculty at Harvard\nMedical School they're like man bro you\nmust be op no I'm just as degenerate as\nthe rest of you\nI'm not actually any better than anyone\nI just know how to play this game I\nfigured out how I work and now I get\nsuper excited about something else and\nthen I harness that excitement this is\nthe key thing don't go to thing number\nfour thing number five thing number six\nCircle back around Circle back around\nyou want to learn how to play guitar\nfantastic buy a guitar you get bored of\nit no problem you want to learn how to\npaint get painting stuff no problem you\nget bored of painting and you want to\nlearn how to garden no problem but when\nyou get bored of gardening don't pick up\nthe piano go back to guitar and then\nwhat you'll find is that you know you\nguys know what I'm talking about where\nyou sort of do this thing where like you\naccomplish so much in one day and you\nask yourself all the time why can't I do\nthis all the time [ __ ] man if I could I\nhad such an awesome day yesterday I did\nso much and you go chasing those days of\nMaximum superhuman productivity that\nyour Normy friends who are succeeding at\nlife can't even\nimagine and you have 10 shitty days and\nyou have one beautiful day and somehow\nyou're still surviving because one day\nof functionality counts is like five for\na regular human being and you wonder to\nyourself if I could do this every day\nimagine what I accomplish this is how\nyou do it every day every day you knock\nit out of the park because you learn how\nto harness that excitement harness that\nnovelty harness that wander lust\nand then every day I mean I work usually\nsix to seven days a week and I work like\n60 to 80 hours a week and I don't feel\ntired because everything that I'm doing\nis very exciting and people will say\nstuff like oh love what you do and\nyou'll never work one day in your\nlife now the problem is that most of the\npeople who do\nthat love one thing and that's what they\nfill their life up in and the problem\nwith us who get bored easily is that we\nlove lots of things and we don't know\nhow to duplicate that formula this is\nhow you duplicate\nit every day you're excited every day\nit's new for you we want to create\nnovelty but we also want to create depth\nso use this cycle and you can wander\nlust all you want and yet you'll still\nbe consistent you'll still build\nthings avoid burnout yeah it's not an\nissue when you're doing something that\nyou enjoy when you get cuz think about\nit right so when you you do like eight\nhours of something day cuz you get super\nexcited you're not burnt out at the end\nof it you may\nbe delightfully\nspent burnout doesn't happen for people\nwith ADHD because they're working hard\nevery day at a new thing that they're\nexcited about burnout happens when you\ndo a shitty job at the same thing over\nand over and over again and it takes you\nspend 10 hours of effort to do two hours\nof work that's what burns you out it's\nnot chasing your excitement it's\nignoring your excitement and doing the\nsame wrote damn boring thing over and\nover and over again that's what burns\npeople out 2 hours of productive work\nthat takes 10 hours will burn out\nsomeone with ADHD not doing 10 hours of\nexciting work every single day the\nformula for Burnout is\nindividual this is the beauty of ayurve\nwhereas if you look at all of the\nstudies on burnout they'll say that\nburnout is the same for all people it's\nnot right we know it's not because the\nstuff that Burns you out you look at\nyour friend who's able to do that every\nday and they're crushing it and they're\nnot burning out but if you try to do 20%\nof what they do you'd be burnt\nout so understand yourself set up a life\nthat harnesses who you\nare don't try to become someone else\nthat's such an uphill battle why don't\nyou just be the best version of yourself\nand create a life that fits you then\nyou're off to the races and you're still\ngoing to be\nlazy cuz when you get excited you're\njust doing something\nproductive\nquestions okay so there's a question\nso people are asking can you do Variety\nin one thing sure right so this is where\nyou decide you lot are asking me how the\n[ __ ] do I know what's going to work for\nyou so you tell me can you do Variety in\none\nthing can you change which characters\nyou play in Dota and make it fun for a\nlong time or do you need to play\ndifferent video games I don't know you\nall decide how do you do this as a\nstudent very good question so a lot of\ntimes we think that as students variety\ncomes from the classes we take but it's\nstill all education so I say the main\nthing to do is a student is is to try to\ndo a couple of things outside of\nschool right so if you're a student\ndon't and you want to write fiction like\nstart writing fiction I'm going to do my\nwork my school work and then some days\nI'm going to write fiction or I'm going\nto learn how to garden or I'm going to\ngo do something physical I'm going to go\nrock\nclimbing or I'm going to travel or I'm\ngoing to volunteer or whatever so don't\ndo things to pad your resume do things\nthat excite you do things that give you\na break from the monotony of school\nand all you need to do is find that\nbalance to where you're not taking so\nmany breaks that the school actually\nsuffers so this is the key thing juggle\nas many balls as you can without\ndropping a single one I'd start with\nhonestly four activities four different\nthings in your life that's kind of Where\nThe Sweet Spot is usually for\nme three seems a little bit too little\nso like you need\nvariety so so I I find that four things\nis\ngood so does this a type apply to\ninattentive type to ADHD absolutely so\nthe whole point of inattentive type of\nADHD is we want to do things that Garner\nour attention it works really well for\nin attentive type because the whole\npoint is when you're excited about\nsomething your attention naturally comes\npeople with inattentive type from ADHD\naren't inattentive in all situations in\nfact they can hyperfocus half the time\nnot half the time 10% of the time so\nwhat we're doing is we're farming for\nhyperfocus and the whole point is that\nthe reason you're inattentive is because\nyou do the same crap over and over and\nover again which is why your mind gets\nbored and you become increasingly\ninattentive what this methodology does\nis it allows you to bypass the\ninattention it creates attention instead\nof\ninattention you are neither attentive\nnor inattentive there is an there is an\nan interaction between you and the\nenvironment and every human being on the\nplanet does not respond to the same\nlevel of attention given the same\nstimulus right so like some people may\nthink like oh my God like some beautiful\nwoman in lots of lingerie just walked in\nand now 100% of my attention is on this\nbeautiful woman assuming I'm a\nman but if I'm gay my attention is going\nto be\ndifferent if I'm a home sexual woman\nthen it'll be the same as a heterosexual\nman right so the attention that you\nbring to the table depends on who you\nare\nokay is maladaptive daydreaming related\nto ADHD probably we have a whole lecture\non maladaptive daydreaming y'all should\ndefinitely check it out\nokay and if you guys want like more\nstuff on this just let us know you guys\npick the topic because that's one of the\nthings that we're doing with memberships\nnow members are going to vote in four\ndays about which four in-depth topics I\nprepare for next\nmonth so these are for 10 bucks a month\nwe're doing four lectures plus Q&A on\ntopics of Members Choice we're also\ndoing our standard level of content so\nmemberships does not reduce the amount\nof free content that we make I'm\nplanning a deep dive probably something\naround women's mental health and\num asexuality are probably coming up\nhopefully in\nJanuary\nokay love these questions but people\nsaid posts right so we're going to do\nposts okay\num\nokay let's do uh let's do this\none women with ADHD does your executive\nfunction SL depressive symptoms get even\nworse during your\nperiod when I consider all the things\nI'm contending with my life feels\nirreparably broken the thing is even\nthough I do feel that from time to time\nit's always way worse during my period\nI've read that symptoms of ADHD get\nworse during menopause but does anyone\nknow if that's also true during a normal\nmenstrual cycle does your executive\nfunction depressive symptoms get worse\naround that time is a great\nquestion so in order to answer it we're\ngoing to do something a little bit\ndifferent\num\nI got to find\nthis okay\nthis how do\nI um\nokay hold on a second chat I\n[Music]\ngotta\num let's do\nNew\nImage oh\nboy G hold on a second chat I got to\nfigure this out I want to\ndownload no how do\nI because I need to draw on an image so\nI'm trying to figure out I

let's get back to\nthe question at hand so women with ADHD\ndoes your executive dysfunction SL\ndepressive symptoms get worse during\nyour period the answer is yes so here's\nthe\nproblem with ADHD and\nmenstruation okay so ADHD absolutely\naffects\nmenstruation but things are way worse\nthan we this is a real mess\nso if we look at medicine we've made a\ncritical mistake in\nmedicine and this mistake has has been\nbeen is huge for women so the biggest\nmistake that we made in medicine is that\nwe\nassume that the disease process is the\nsame all 30 days so if we look at\nsomething like heart disease it is not a\ndimension of heart disease that it gets\nworse on Tuesday and better next\nThursday it is sort of a fixed problem\nso if we look at our models of disease\nwe do not account for a hormonal\nfluctuation impacting the\ndisease this is I think a a very\nimportant bias in medicine because in\nhalf the\npopulation their disease process gets\naltered based on menstrual\ncycles and the fact that this is not a\nkey part of our understanding of\nmedicine is a huge oversight so let's\ntake a look at the impact of\nmenstruation on\nADHD so here's a paper that talks about\nreproductive steroids and ADH ADHD\nsymptoms across the menstrual cycle okay\nso we'll go into more detail in a\nsecond the relationship between sex\nhormones reproductive stages and ADHD a\nsystematic review where we see that you\nknow there's different kinds of data\nthat we we'll dive into what this is\nattention deficit disorder in the\nmenstrual cycle theory in evidence where\nwe talk about for\nexample there are declines in executive\nfunction in trait control characterized\nby increases in approach and risk be\nbehaviors at midcycle per ulation and\nincreases in avoidance and negative\naffect per menr okay so we'll explain\nwhat all this is I'll I'll break it down\nfor youall but the short answer is that\nADHD is absolutely affected by your\nmenstrual cycle and it's not even like\nit makes it worse that is a simplistic\nview as it turns out if we really look\nat the menstrual\ncycle what we discover is that the\nvarious features of\nADHD are actually change throughout the\nmenstrual cycle so some things get worse\nsome things get better this thing\nchanges this way this thing changes that\nway there's like all kinds of variations\nso let's go through what happens all\nright so let's start by understanding\nthe female menstrual cycle and I know\nthis is kind of scary for yall but let's\nunderstand it so the first thing to\nunderstand about the female menstrual\ncycle is that it starts with Menses so\nmenstruation or when you get your period\nis actually Day Zero or day one okay\nthat's how we sort of rank things and\nthen after menstruation we enter\nsomething called the uh proliferative\nphase and then we sort of get ready to\novulate so this is like where the the\negg is out and then we're developing a\nfollicle and then during ovulation the\nfollicle ejects an egg and this egg is\ncapable of getting pregnant okay and\nthen if it gets pregnant then it sort of\nimplants in the uterus over\nhere it implants over here in the uterus\nand then we get a pregnancy and if\nthere's no implantation that happens we\nwind back around to menes and we repeat\nthe cycle again okay so now let's\nunderstand how ADHD affects these things\nnow the main way that ADHD gets affected\nis actually by these hormones and\ndifferent hormones do different things\nat different levels so it's not so\nsimple as ADHD gets worse during this\nphase and better during this phase ADHD\nhas a number of different features like\nemotional regulation risk-taking\nBehavior impulsivity mood and all of\nthese get uniquely affected by the\nbalance of\nhormones so the first thing is that when\nwe look at periods of time\nthat\nestradiol\nuh okay so when estradiol is\nlow and progesterone is high so this is\nthe phase that we're talking\nabout this leads to\nincreased\nimpulsivity so what we sort of know is\nthat the we just know from different\nstudies that one of the changes that we\nsee in menstruation is that in your\nsecretory phase which is immediately\nafter ovulation something about the\nbalance of your estrogen and\nprogesterone level lead to a worsening\nof impulsivity oh\nGod okay so that's change number\none change number two oh\nGod okay there we\ngo is we know\nthat so this is kind of similar but\nParry ulation so around the time of\novulation we also get\nincreased risk taking\nBehavior okay if we sort of think about\nthis right this is very\ndangerous because if we think about like\ngetting\npregnant right around the time that we\nare capable of getting pregnant from a\nmenstrual standpoint as when we as women\nI'm using the collective we but when\ny'all women I suppose have increased\nrisk-taking behavor behavior and\nincreased impulsivity so what is the\nrelationship between the menstrual cycle\nand ADHD\nsymptoms our capacity to gauge\nrisk and think about the consequences of\nour actions seems to be affected by this\nprogesterone to estrogen level so when\nour estrogen is lower than our\nprogesterone we're more we become\nriskier so what I would advise to women\nwhen it comes to ADHD in the menstrual\ncycle is prepare for more impulsive\nbehavior per ulation so what this kind\nof means is that if you have a regular\nmenstrual cycle 14\ndays after you menstruate you're going\nto enter the zone of high risk-taking\nBehavior so I would be extra careful who\nyou have sex with be extra careful who\nyou hang out with because it may be\neasier for you to have sex you may not\nthink about the consequences quite as\nmuch and so you're going to have more\nimpulsivity all right that's so the\nstudies show\nanyway next thing is that per\nmenstrually we see increases in\navoidance and negative affect so around\nthe time of menstruation so over here\nwe're going to see increased\navoidance and increased negative affect\noh that's\nnegative so these are the two big\nchanges that we see that seem to be\nrelated to ADHD so interestingly enough\nit's not even\nattentional so around the time of your\nmenstrual cycle if you have ADHD you\nwill be more vulnerable to negative\nemotions and you are more likely to be\navoidant and this is the interesting\nthing is it's not that people who\nmenstruate are more avoidant when\nthey've got ADHD there's a fluctuation\nthat is dependent on hormones so what do\nwe need to take away from this let me\nactually look at at one last thing\num okay\nso the last thing to consider is that\nwhen we have low estr I mean uh low\nprogesterone this seems to be correlated\nso the the purple one being low this\nseems to be correlated with negative\naffect okay or low mood\nokay so I want youall to understand this\nis super cool so as our progesterone if\nlow progesterone means low mood what\ndoes high progesterone mean means High\nmood and when our mood is really good\nthat's when we like to have a good time\nthat's when we become more impulsive\nthat's when we don't think about the\nnegative consequences of our actions\nright cuz we're feeling pretty good\nwe're feeling pretty chill we don't have\nto worry about much so it's all good\nbaby and so this is what's really\ninteresting is that when it comes to the\nmenstrual cycle in ADHD we don't see a\nwhole lot of data that suggests that is\npurely attentional in fact what we see\nis that the menstrual cycle\ninteracts with the part of ADHD that is\naffected by hormones and that seems to\nbe more to do with risk-taking behavior\nimpulsivity reactivity and mood so it's\nnot so much that you have difficulty\nconcentrating which is also why it's so\nconfusing for many people that they're\nsaying well I have maybe I have some\ndegree of difficulty concentrating but\nit's not necessarily it's not so simple\nas\nconcentration it's that I'm less able to\ncontrol my impulses apparently per\nulation so halfway through your\nmenstrual cycle right and then your mood\nwill probably be a little bit lower\naround the time of menstruation you'll\nengage in more avoidant behaviors around\nthe time of menstruation and so as a\nwoman it's really important to\nunderstand these fluctuations because\nthis is what you have to prepare for my\nexperience of working with women and who\nhave ADHD during their menstrual cycles\nis it's really\nconfusing like they don't know what to\nexpect clearly there's some kind of\ncorrelation but they're like eh it's not\nlike I have difficulty studying but\nsometimes this is harder and sometimes\nthis is harder so the couple things you\nneed to watch out for worsening affect\nincreased avoidance during your men\nmenstruation 14 days later during\novulation your mood can improve you'll\nbecome more impulsive and you'll take\nmore risks so be\ncareful\nquestions yeah so 1984 X is saying High\nprogesterone is not good mood at all\nprogesterone can cause inflammation make\nyou feel uh like having a cold body\ntemperature goes up absolutely true so\nremember what we're talking about here\nis not the effect of progesterone on\nmood we're talking about the specific\nway in which progesterone affects the\nmood of people who are not neurotypical\nand have\nADHD and this is at least what the\nhandful of studies that I've looked at\nso far show is that there are changes in\nmood what if you have irregular Cycles\nthis is great question so remember that\nthis is kind of why I explained if we go\nback to this hold\non so the reason that I didn't talk\nabout just the cycle but I talked about\nthe hormonal imbalance or the hormonal\neffect is that even if you have\nirregular Cycles if this process\nsometimes takes 28 days and sometimes\ntakes 35\ndays the thing that affects the ADH day\nsymptoms is not this down here or this\ndown here but this over here so as you\nunderstand where you are in your cycle\nin the balance of your hormones whether\nit takes 35 days 28 days or 21 days\nthose effects should be the same so even\nif you don't know exactly what's going\non you kind of know that okay increased\navoidance and negative AFF effect is\ngoing to come first and then in about\ntwo weeks we can see a lifting of f mood\nand an increase in impulsivity and an\nincrease in risk-taking Behavior so you\ncan know that okay like right now I'm\nfeeling down I stopped feeling down a\nweek from now maybe I'll start to feel\ngood and a and that's when I need to be\nreally careful about like my impulsivity\nmy impulsivity could get worse so I need\nto be more careful about not impulsively\nbuying things or at the last minute\ndeciding to throw a party this is where\nI tend to screw myself because I give it\ngive into my\nimpulses so irregular Cycles is gets\ncomplicated but that's exactly why we're\nnot basing it on this or this or we're\nbasing it on is this and these number\nthis stuff can change from person to\nperson and week to week or month to\nmonth great\nquestion okay this is great so there are\nalso questions about birth control pills\nand\nADHD so the first criminal mistake that\nthe field of medicine has made\nis that we as a field when we prescribe\nbirth control we don't tell people hey\nby the way do you have ADHD because it\ncould affect your ADHD we'll mention\nmood a little bit often times that's\nlike a part of the you know anticipatory\nguidance when prescribing birth control\nbut this is kind of the the I think the\ntragedy in medicine is\nthat just about every aspect of your\nphysiology and psychology is going to be\naffected by your hormonal\nlevels now this is less of an issue for\nmen unless we've got low testosterone or\nsomething like that and that's because\nour hor hormonal levels don't seem to\nfluctuate at the level that they do for\nwomen but even we know for example that\nthe risk of cancer and heart disease\nchanges postmenopause so all of those\nchanges that are likely due to hormonal\nchanges in women that are going to\naffect your heart health and your risk\nof Cancer all of those changes are going\non from a week to week basis within you\nso your your your cholesterol metabolism\nyour you know of that stuff is aggregate\nrisk over time so it doesn't change that\nmuch but there's all kinds of things\nthat are changing week to week and it's\ncriminal in medicine that we haven't\nsort of acknowledge that right we don't\neducate women on that when we start them\non birth control we don't say hey this\ncould affect your ADHD it could affect\nyour anxiety it could affect your mood\ncould affect everything your OCD it\ncould even affect the way that you feel\nabout yourself and the way that you form\nrelationships and\nattachments so birth control is going to\naffect all of this stuff the question of\nhow depends on the birth control\nso for example we have some progesterone\nonly birth control we have some mixed\nestrogen progesterone birth control we\nhave birth control that is pills that\nthen has a placebo area that induces\nyour menstruation we also will have\nthings like iuds which can also have\nprogesterone in them which have more of\na local effect so those I would expect\nto affect this stuff\nless right so the how does birth control\naffect your ADHD it depends on the birth\ncontrol\ngreat question though I wish I could say\nbirth control does this but the whole\npoint is that like that would be an\noversimplification and that's not how it\nworks the mistake that we're making is\nwe're assuming that there's one effect\nno it's like\ncomplicated yeah nuing is a good example\nof like I think ning is progesterone\nonly\nright so Donnie is saying sounds like a\nsmart evolutionary move to ensure we\nprocreate yeah maybe right so maybe\nincreasing risk-taking Behavior around\nthe time that you can get\npregnant propagates the\nspecies dazios is asking I've taken some\nsort of birth control since I was 16\nshould I stop to see how I'm without the\npill or keep going with Yas because of\nmy pmdd that is a question for your\ndoctor right now we get to the beautiful\npart of stream when we\nsay everything is for educational\nentertainment purposes only this crosses\nthe line right so when we say this is\nnot medical advice if I were to say hey\nyou should stop your birth control that\nin my opinion would cross over so we're\nteaching yall these general principles\nand the whole point of stream is to is\nand it's not that I it's that it would\nbe irresponsible to cross that line\nbecause I don't know what your medical\nhistory is I don't know how long you've\nhad pmdd I don't know what your\ndifferential diagnosis is so now that\nyall understand this stuff by all means\ngo and talk to your doctor about it and\nask them hey what do you think about me\nstopping my birth control here are my\nconsiderations and when someone knows\nyour medical history then they can\nactually provide medical care they will\nask you diagnostic questions and make\ntreatment\nrecommendations would you recommend an\nendocrinologist to track those hormonal\nphases how can an endocrinologist help\nwith ADHD here's what I would recommend\nif yall are interested in menstruation\nand ADHD in that particular intersection\nsee a psychiatrist who specializes in\nwomen's health that would be my\nrecommendation not an\nendocrinologist obig would be number two\nso number one would be psychiatrist who\nspecializes in in women's health number\ntwo would actually be an obig number\nthree would be General\npsychiatrist maybe that's wrong\nor an Obi gy who knows like mental\nhealth\nstuff because obies can be really\nfantastic they're like super hardworking\nand\nstuff does the high impulsivity phase\namplify actions based on negative\nemotions the short answer is we don't\nreally know but based on my reading of\nit and I'll show you all the the\nreference right\nhere so this is a relatively small study\nbut let's take a\nlook so the present study examined\nestradiol progesterone and testosterone\nassociations with ADHD symptoms across\nthe menstrual cycle in regularly cycling\nwomen with a sample size of 32 so this\nis a very small\nstudy and what we find is that results\nindicated decreased levels of E2 in the\ncontext of increased levels of P4 or t\nwere associated with higher ADHD\nsymptoms the following day particularly\nfor those with high trait\nimpulsivity okay so that's number one so\nthis is where we become more impulsive\nnow let's look at why so\nincreases um in low in avoidance and\nnegative affect per menr low estrogen\nand control May then interact with\nincreases in positive and negative as\naect respectively to\nincrease hyperactivity impulsivity\nsymptoms post OB ation and inent oh it\nlooks like inattention symptoms per\nmenstrually so what this kind of means\nis that we're not 100% sure because this\nstudy is also not 100% because we don't\nreally have great and here's if you guys\nwant to know here's what we know the\nliterature on the relationship between\nsex hormones and ADHD is\nlimited available studies present\ncontradicting information it is not\nknown we we don't know really know much\nso what I've done is I I've taken\nessentially a lot of low quality\nresearch and tried to synthesize it into\nsomething as best as I can understand\nit but it seems that that low\nestrogen May then interact with\nincreases in positive and negative AFF\neffect so this study is suggesting that\nthere could be a vulnerability to\nboth that when we have low estrogen we\nbecome more more vulnerable to positive\nand negative effect which in turn will\nresult in\nimpulsivity\ndoes that make\nsense someone's asking about a podcast\nwith the men's ADHD support group we've\ngot a press inquiry thing on our website\njust apply there that's how we handle\nthat why not high quality research just\nbecause we don't have great studies yet\nright we're spending our money on other\nthings\nhow does ADHD medicine interact with the\nmenstrual cycle what a great\nquestion so ADHD medicine to my\nknowledge does not interact profoundly\nwith the menstrual cycle but actually\nyou know I haven't done that search so\nhold on a\nsecond let's find out\ntogether\num okay so let's just look here's how I\nanswer questions y'all you guys want to\ndo this with me let's do it together so\nI I did stimulant medication menstrual\ncycle or we can do ADHD\nmedication let's see\num the phac okay no but see this isn't\nabout\nmenstruation let's\nsee\n[Music]\num yeah see this is a study that's\nlooking at like differences between boys\nand girls it's not specifically about\nthe the effect on the me menstrual cycle\nso here if we do stimulant medication\nwhich is why I searched for stimulant\nmedication um let's take a look at\nthis see this is a cross-sectional study\nthat's not going to help this is a case\nreport ah here we go this is what we\nwant acute effects of damphetamine\nduring the follicular and ludal phases\nthis is this\npaper\nn\n[Music]\nreject although there were no Baseline\ndifferences in mood during the\nfollicular ludal phase the effects of\namp were greater during the folicular\nphase than the ludal phase\nokay so the follicular\nphase is so it seems that\nlike the the medication makes people\nfeel better post menes so the follicular\nphase is the part after menes and the\nludal phase is post\novulation um\nso it looks like so uh\namphetamines are influ the response to\nEMP Fatam Mees is is dependent depends\non the level of\nestrogen right so it looks so so now now\nlet's go back to this so now we learned\nsomething isn't this cool\nso so it looks like during this phase so\nlet me change my color\nwhere's my\ncolor pen color let's do blue green okay\nso it looks like during this phase where\nour estrogen levels are high this is\nwhen\namphetamines or\nstimulants correlate with a bigger\neffect according to this one study so\nit's very possible that you have a\ndifferential response to medication\nbased on where you are in your menstrual\ncycle and it seems to correlate with the\nlevel of estrogen so what we find is\nthat\npeople during the follicular phase right\nso this is the folicular phase this is\nthe first half feel more High energetic\nand intellectually efficient\neuphoric\num\nso during the ludal phase in the\npresence of both estrogen and\nprogesterone estrogen levels were not\nrelated to the effect\nof which means that the follicular phase\nyour medication will work differently\nand in the ludal phase it seems like\nthere isn't a differential response to\nestrogen so meds may feel like they work\na little bit better in the first half of\nyour menstrual\ncycle we learned something Isn't that\ncool my point is that I think it's crazy\nthat I don't think ADHD is the\nonly diagnosis where this is\ntrue I think it's crazy that for half\nthe\npopulation we don't think about this\nstuff we're just like ADHD here's the\nmed oh by the way it's going to be twice\nas effective in days two to 10 of your\nmenstrual cycle and by the way you're\ngoing to be more susceptible to negative\naffect which kind of makes sense right\nso if we feel worse post menstruation\nthen a medication that makes us feel\nfeel more euphoric will be more\neffective this could even result in like\nvery very specific prescribing patterns\nof based on your ADHD and menstrual\ncycle I'm going to recommend that you\ntake a stimulant days 2 to 15 and as\nsoon as you ovulate you can stop the\nmedication like this could be the kind\nof specificity we could move towards but\nwe don't because we think about ADHD as\nstatic it's\ncrazy\num okay\nso how do I deal with doctors telling me\nadult ADHD doesn't exist and that it\nalways turns into bipolar disorder I\nhave literally never heard a doctor say\nthat that boggles my mind there is so\nmuch overwhelming evidence that I can\nthink of that that is not true\nI don't even know where I don't even\nknow what to site because it just defies\nour current understanding of medicine I\nwould need to see evidence of\nthat now I actually I mean I could I\ncould\nengineer something that could suggest\nthat which is more like okay if we look\nat ADHD as\nimpulsivity I I can see how that some I\ncan see how that could happen because\nyou could have bipolar disorder with\nsome Ree of hypomania which then gets\ndiagnosed as ADHD and then as people\ngrow older we discover that they never\nhad ADHD to begin with their\ndistractability difficulty with\nconcentration Etc was actually a feature\nof bipolar disorder so I take that\nback but I would say find a different\ndoctor yeah so so so when people are\nsaying like misdiagnosed with bipolar I\nthink bipolar is one of the most\nmisdiagnosed diagnoses out there like I\nthink the the prevalence of bipolar\ndisorder is like\n1% bipolar disorder is actually quite\nrare let me just double\ncheck yeah so look at the oh that's\nelderly\nokay so like look at this so people\ndon't like everyone's like oh my God\nhe's bipolar no he's\nnot so bipolar disorders on with a\nmeasured lifetime prevalence in 1% okay\nthis this is older\npeople where's the\nepidemiology okay\nso lifetime prevalence of about 1 to 3%\nin the general population\nokay however reanalysis the data\nNational epidemiologic catchment area\nsurvey of the United States just that\n8% of the population has experienced\none manic episode and 05% have a\nhypomanic\nepisode so like including sub threshold\nso this is what I'm saying it's very\nrare 1% met lifetime prevalence of\ncriteria for by Bol disorder 1.1 for\nbipolar 2 and 2.4 for sub threshold\nsymptoms so bipolar disorder is quite\nrare I mean I don't always get these\nstatistics right and I'm relieved that I\ngot that one\nright 1% is still quite a lot but if you\ncompare to the lifetime prevalence of\nmajor depressive disorder let's take a\nlook at that it's going to be like 30%\nit's\ncrazy let's\nlook\nlet's look at\nepidemiology okay\n88.4%\n[Music]\num\n177% ages 18 to\n25\num 25% of\nwomen 10% of\nmen right so so I mean I want to say\nit's somewhere around 30% but maybe I'm\novershooting it a little\nbit but it's at least 10 times as common\nif not 15 to 20 times as common as\nbipolar\ndisorder right I mean like I'm not like\nI'm not an epidemiologist this is just\nlike clinical perspectives just like gut\nof how you practice I'm not an expert in\nany of these conditions\num okay so let's do one more and then\ncall it a\nday are we I'm kind of wiped\nchat what are the dangers of combining\nADHD meds and\nweed\nokay all right so this is absolutely a\nconversation for your doctor but if yall\nwant a tldr of combining ADHD meds and\nweed it's kind of like asking the\nquestion what's the downside of drying\nyourself off with a towel in the pool\nwhile you're swimming well the downside\nis that the purpose of the towel is to\ndry yourself off and then if you're in\nthe water it ain't going to do anything\nso the most common thing about ADHD and\nand wheat is that the two substances are\nworking to counteract each\nother okay so weed is going to dull your\nfocus is angiolytic which means it\nreduces your anxiety is it kind of makes\nyou chill out a little bit stimulant\nmedication is going to do the opposite\nright it's like mixing an upper and a\ndowner so generally speaking my\nexperience as a psychiatrist is that\nwhen people are using\nsubstances especially alcohol and\nmarijuana it reduces the\nefficacy of the stimulant medication\nthat they\ntake so I think it's kind of like you're\nshooting yourself in the foot now the\nflip side of that is that many people\nlove doing it and if they love doing it\nwe have to take a pretty serious look at\nwhy so the other really interesting\nthing is that the flip side of the\nargument is that ADHD medication is\nanxiety inducing so we know that one of\nthe side effects of stimulant medication\nis to increase our anxiety we know that\nADHD medication can interfere with our\nability to\nsleep and so then the question is why do\nwe do why do we take marijuana because\nwe we're actually self-medicating the\nside effects of the ADHD\nmedication on the flip side why do we\ntake ADHD medication because we're\nself-medicating the side effects of\nmarijuana so marijuana chills us out\nallows us to socialize allows us to\nrelax allows us to get out of our own\nhead but dulls our senses and makes it\ndifficult for us to concentrate so we\nwant to we want to sort of manage that\nwith ADHD medication so I don't think\nit's\nsilly that people tend to use the two\nand they love using the two there are a\ncouple of other concerns that you have\nto be super careful about so we know\nthat marijuana is actually a gateway\ndrug and what does that mean it's a\ngateway drug that means that the effect\nof marijuana on the developing brain so\nif you're under the age of 28 marijuana\nhas this effect on your brain where it\nchanges your dopamine circuitry and your\nnucleus succumbent\narchitecture so that you are vulnerable\nto becoming addicted to euphoric\nsubstances so it changes the way that\nyour brain is gets wired which makes you\nvulnerable to other\naddictions so that's what we've got to\nbe kind of careful about now on the flip\nside we know that people who take\nstimulant medication have an interesting\nrelationship with developing\naddictions because on the one hand it\nmesses with your dopamine circuitry but\none of the things that we know is if you\nactually look at epidemiologic studies\npeople who are started on stimulant\nmedication are less likely to become\naddicted later in life and the question\nis why if it's if it causes Euphoria\nwhat happens well it turns out that\nstimulant medication\nenhances your frontal loes and your\nfrontal loes protect You Against\nAddiction so it's like it's complicated\nI don't know if yall followed like all\nthe back and forth but that's kind of\nwhat we know right should I write that\nout are yall able to follow\nthat\nokay so someone's saying Russell Barkley\nSt that th can use causes more Focus but\nless recall so let's understand that for\na second right so this is where like\nthings get complicated it's not like\nthis thing good this thing bad so if we\nlook at ADHD we are highly distractable\nwe have lots of different thoughts our\nthoughts are all over the place so any\ncentral nervous system\ndepressant will slow down all of the\nexcess thoughts and leave us with one or\ntwo thoughts and the more we get left\nwith one or two thoughts the more it\nwill feel like\nFocus but this is where my personal\nopinion is that a lot of psychiatrists\ndo not study Focus the way that yogis do\nthey don't really think about what is\nthe nature of\nfocus so we're sort of slapping on this\nimproves or disproves but really you\nhave to look at what is the actual\nmechanism in the Mind through which CNS\ndepressants can help ADHD so we'll give\npeople stimulants and people will say\nokay if I take a stimulant it helps me\nFocus my mind if I literally stimulate\nmy brain I focus my mind more\neasily if\nI give myself a central nervous system\ndepressant like alcohol or marijuana\nthat also allows me to focus how is that\npossible well it's very simple when we\nstimulate the part of the brain that\nwe're simulating is the frontal loes the\nfrontal loes are the breakes of our\nbrain not the gas pedal so what they\nhelp us do is they help us slow down\nthey re in the impulsive IND\ndistractable parts of our mind so I'm\nstimulating my break which allows me to\nslow down then I can give a CNS\ndepressant which slows down the end\nresult is the same in both cases we're\nslowing\ndown right does that make\nsense\ncould walking the path of the agori help\nsomeone cope with\nADHD does their yogic perspective differ\nfrom others as a cope what an\ninteresting\nquestion so I'm I'm putting out a video\nsoon hopefully I'll record maybe on\nWednesday morning about meditation and\nADHD so it's one that I've already like\nscripted out and stuff but I'm going to\nhave to think about agori I'd have to\nreally think about that question for a\nlittle\nbit so is it too late for a drug addict\nwho wants to quit to try stimulants no\nno I mean there's actually like a decent\namount of evidence that treating ADHD\nwith stimulant medication helps people\nbecome\nsober so for a long time we thought as a\nfield that if someone has a history of\naddiction don't give them an addictive\nsubstance\nbut it turns out that a lot of people\nhave a drug of\nchoice right their brain is not\nvulnerable to all\naddictions um that there're specifically\nusually we people have a drug of choice\nso an alcoholic can still for example\nsmoke cigarettes and like be okay or\neven use marijuana or something like\nthat um and what we know is that like we\nsaid ADHD medication helps us actually\nrestrain impulses there's some data that\nshows that actually improves addictions\nbut that's where like you really need a\ngood clinician to help you decide like\nwhat's your threshold what's the risk\nbenefit\nEtc\nokay\num what if weed is only used for the\ncown of stimulants would you still\nconsider this drawing in the\npool so here's what I'd say in\ngeneral I'd say if that if you're using\none\nsubstance to counteract the effect of\nanother substance that's not really a\ngreat way to do\nthings so the simple truth of the matter\nis that the body is way better at\nself-regulating than we\nare so your body's natural ability to\nregulate its mood go to sleep wake up is\nfar superior to caffeine plus a\nsedative and so I'd say that generally\nspeaking doing both is less healthy than\ndoing neither there's some exceptions to\nthat but if we kind of think about it\nlike these stimulants and depressants\nare like blunt instruments we're\nflooding our body with a particular\nchemical that hits all of our\ntissues and has all kinds of effects\nthere's no balance the thing about the\nhuman body that's really cool is there's\nall kinds of intrinsic balance a really\ngood example of\nthis it's wild so if we have this\nhormone called\ncortisol cortisol does a couple of\ninteresting things one is it increases\nthe inflammation that we experience it\nincreases our heart rate it increases\nour blood pressure it makes us more\nmentally stressed we feel more mentally\nstressed and it floods our bloodstream\nwith\nsugar now since it does all of these\ndifferent things each of these things\ngoes back and regulates cortisol\nso there's a really interesting set of\nstudies that show that in trauma people\nwho have been traumatized have high\nlevels of cortisol and those high levels\nof cortisol increase their\nhypervigilance make it hard for them to\ngo to sleep the world is dangerous and\nthe cortisol is doing that to your brain\nso really cool studies show that eating\nbeta glucans which are some of the\nsubstances in mushrooms that regulate\nyour blood sugar will actually go back\nand reduce your cortisol\nlevel so even if we want cortisol\nincreases our heart rate makes us more\nmentally stressed and increases our\nblood sugar if we can eat stuff that\nlowers our blood sugar that will kind of\ngo back and feedback and reduce the\ncortisol and then result in a lower\nblood pressure lower heart rate and\nlower stress level so you can eat\nmushrooms to lower your stress level\nthis is in the case of someone who's\nwho's got a high level of cortisol in a\nhistory of\ntrauma so this is the this is the\nsophistication of the way that our whole\nbody and mind and brain are like a\nnetwork of all of these interplaying\npieces another good example of this is\nwe have bacteria in our\ngut that produce neurotransmitter PR\nprecursors so they produce the compounds\nthat become serotonin and\ndopamine in epinephine and\nnorepinephrine so the food that we eat\nwill influence our neurotransmitter uh\nproduction\nokay yeah we can do a meditation\nstream uh I don't know which mushrooms\nspecifically have beta glucans I know\nthey're in\nmushrooms I don't know which ones I\ndon't know if it's like shitake or\nwhatever\nokay um so I need to eat mushrooms to\nreduce my cortisol I don't ah maybe hold\non let's see I don't remember the\npopulation for that that study so beta\nglucan\ncortisol let's\nsee okay yeah so it does look like it\nworks let's take a quick\nlook right so beta glucan induced\ncortisol levels improve the early immune\nresponse in Minka that's not\nhumans um beta glucan reduces cortisol\nplasma levels enhances innate immune\nsystem after a\nhydrophilia\ninoculation this looks like it could\nbe yeah so these aren't human\nstudies so so let's\nsee yeah this is like fish and shellfish\ndude\naquaculture wow so it looks like what\nthey're doing is\num it looks like they're using beta\nglucans in like fish farms to reduce\ntheir cortisol and level up their immune\nsystem so that fish farms don't they\ndon't they're less susceptible bacteria\nthat's next level so it looks like\nthey're feeding fish\nmushrooms to keep him\nhealthy that's next\nlevel dude like I love science like I I\ndon't know if you can make an\nextrapolation for\nhumans\nbut\nyeah am I a millionaire\nno I don't think so\nanyway I\nwish um okay so take care everybody this\nwas fun okay so let me ask y'all before\nI go how was this so we covered some\nposts we did some stuff we you know does\nit feel like y'all are happy with this\nsome back and\nforth can ADHD be cured through working\non oneself or can only medication help\nwith the problem I don't know if ADHD\ncan be cured but it can absolutely you\ncan absolutely work on yourself to the\npoint where ADHD does not affect your\nlife in a negative way you can learn to\nlive with\nit okay you wish I did this when I\nwasn't working well that's what vods are\nfor although I love having people\nlive okay okay okay great so thank you\nall very much we're streaming we have\nour uh members stream this Wednesday on\ndeveloping healthy masculinity if y'all\nare unfamiliar with memberships we just\nlaunched this feature so a couple of\nthings to keep in mind the first is that\nmemberships do not affect or reduce any\nof the free content that we make\num the reason we started doing\nmemberships is because as we've started\nbuilding YouTube videos and stuff like\nthat like let let me just show you all\nreal quick hopefully this will like just\nexplain\num so if we look\nat our YouTube\nchannel what we find is that we have\nsome videos that\nare\nlike you know so this is a 20 minute\nvideo that has 700,000 views it's a\ngreat video um and then we if you guys\njust kind of go down and you look at our\nlike longer videos they don't do as well\nso like here's a 2hour interview that's\nlike\n85,000 you know so like our our long\nform content doesn't just doesn't\nperform as\nwell which doesn't mean that we don't\nmake it right we're here on stream for\ntwo hours today and like that's fine\nlike we're okay doing that but one of\nthe things that we found is if if we're\ntrying to help the most people possible\nmaking something that more people will\nwatch like so we had a video about why\ntherapy sucks for men that has I think\nlike well over a million views I don't\nknow if it's like 1.1 or 1.7 or whatever\num and\nso we're trying to make stuff that\npeople on YouTube like now the problem\nis that I'm tired of making 20-minute\nvideos although I'm going to continue\nmaking them but I I really want to go\nback to doing like in-depth lectures and\nso we're going to do that on stream like\ntoday and we'll continue to do that we\nstill occasionally do that and [ __ ] the\nperformance sometimes right so we have\nto sort of balance that but for those of\ny'all there's been a a big demand in our\ncommunity for people who want more so\nlike back to one hour lectures and what\nI'm excited about is y'all get to decide\nwhat the topics are so every month on\nthe 15th yall vote for what topics you\nwant me to prepare lectures on I'm going\nto prepare those lectures that are going\nto be 1hour lectures that will be more\nacademic more in-depth and even more\napplicable if you guys want to do things\nlike skills-based workshops and stuff\nlike that we can do that\ntoo cost is 10 bucks a month and helps\nfuel our free content right so I know\nthis is kind of confusing but the more\nfree stuff we make the more it costs us\nso that money's got to come from\nsomewhere and thus far we don't do a\nwhole lot of fundraising drives we\nhaven't taken capital investment we're\nsuper careful about our sponsorships\njust to give you all kind of a a sense\nof scale we get some sponsorship offers\nthat would pay us in one month what we\nwould make in a whole year of YouTube\nmemberships and we turn those down\nbecause we turn those\ndown and we're we're doing memberships\nbecause I want to go back to making that\ncontent this is an additional thing that\nI'm trying that substitutes for other\nstuff that I do has nothing to do with\nthe free content that we make so if yall\nare interested it's 10 bucks a month for\nfour lectures that are one hour each\nthat are delivered live with Q&A and\nthen even we're considering an e extra\nQ&A like 60 Minute or 90 minute stream\nor something like that specifically for\nquestions that are asked\nby the\ncommunity and we're really grateful for\neveryone who's signed up because I get\nto make more lectures doing more\nadvanced topics and you all get to\ndecide what it is so instead of Dr K\ntrying to figure out okay this is what\nI'm going to talk about today yall tell\nme and I'll make\nit um I like long content too that's\nkind of why we're doing it and just a\nreminder that this doesn't mean that all\nof our long content is going to be a\nmembers content we'll continue doing\ntwo-hour streams and stuff like that\nwe've got a couple of deep Dives plan\nthat we're still planning on doing but\nyou all get to decide so if yall are\ninterested in that sign up we really\nappreciate everyone who signs up it\nreally helps us do the work that we want\nto do and then there's also a second\ntier at 15 bucks a month for people who\nwant to give us additional money you'll\nget access to some beta features and\nthings like that but really it's for\npeople who want to support the work that\nwe're\ndoing we've tried to make it make it as\naffordable and accessible as possible so\nwe also have other services like\ncoaching and stuff that'll be anywhere\nfrom like 20 to 30 bucks to 50 bucks a\nmonth a week which is really out of the\nreach for a lot of people even some\npeople will say guides at $25 a pop are\ntoo expensive so we're trying to give\nyouall content that is even more\naffordable and so you know even less\nthan the price of cosmetic horse\narmor\num okay so thank you'all very\nmuch and uh is there a way to do\nmembership that doesn't give YouTube my\ncard not yet but I would yeah not yet\nbut we're working on so we recognize\nthat doing this may be like leaving\nbehind our twitch subs and things like\nthat so we're trying to figure out some\nway where there's like it's hard but\nwe're trying to figure out how to give\nlike everyone the same\nstuff okay so take care everybody thank\nyou all very much for coming today and\ngood luck with\neverything will the videos be archived\nabsolutely and there's even some talk\nfrom Members about you know some members\nwere saying like Okay like maybe we\nshould share this with other people like\nthe the rest of the community and like\nwe're going to talk about that kind of\nstuff um if I join m memberships can I\nwatch older membership content that\ndepends on the YouTube platform but I\nthink the answer is\nyes right and and we so here's the thing\nwe're we're when we launch\nmemberships we're trying to do more for\nthe\ncommunity and we recognize that not\neverything is for\neveryone and so that's where like\nhonestly if we so let's say that we\nreplaced our existing content with the\ncontent that we're planning on doing\nwhich is one hour lectures a week if\nthat's what our content became our\nYouTube channel would\ntank and then the question becomes okay\nlike is it okay for it to tank well like\nif our if we had taken that attitude\nfrom the beginning chances are 90% of\ny'all wouldn't be here today because you\nwould have never heard of us because we\ndidn't play the YouTube game so we're\ntrying to actually do both we're trying\nto balance making in-depth content with\ndoing stuff that is generally\naccess and this isort of the solution\nwe've come up with for now so I'm super\nexcited about it because I want to make\nlike more in-depth lectures I'm really\nexcited about the lecture we have coming\nup on Wednesday about masculinity what\nis healthy Max masculinity what is toxic\nmasculinity and how to develop healthy\nmasculinity um and then I'm also excited\nabout doing this which is like let's\ntalk about ADHD so we're going to try to\ndo more for yall because yall want\nmore so take care everybody love yall\nand enjoy the rest of your day okay"
