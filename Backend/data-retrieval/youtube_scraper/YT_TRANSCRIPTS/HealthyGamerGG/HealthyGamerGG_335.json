welcome to another healthy\ngamer GG\nstream my name is Alo konoa and I a\ndoctor but just a reminder that\neverything we discuss on stream today is\nintended to be for educational purposes\nonly nothing is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice if youall have a concern\nor question please go see a licensed\nprofessional stream has started no I\nwould hope so because I'm certain here\nand I'm certainly talking to an empty\nroom um and for those of y'all that are\nsaying hit the like button for drk famam\nwe really appreciate it thank you guys\nvery\nmuch okay so uh yeah so seriously so\nwelcome to another healthy gamer GG\nstream my name is Alo kenoa I'm a\npsychiatrist just a reminder that\neverything we talk about on stream today\nis intended to be for educational and\nentertainment purposes only nothing is\nintended to be taken as medical advice\nand so if you all have a concern or\nquestion please go see Li\nprofessional so yeah I don't know what\nthat accent is um sometimes I just mix\nhim up for this for the little ones and\nmy kids don't they used to really\ndislike it when I spoke in an accent but\nfirst of all they are now learning\naccents\nthemselves and so I don't know if\nthey're already like offensive at their\nage and then the second thing is they've\nsuddenly started to like\nthem um y'all don't need to smash the\nlike button once is enough what you need\nto smash is mean\num okay so today we're going to do\nsomething different so it's kind of like\nend of\n2023 we're looking at 2024 so gruy and I\nthought that we would just talk to y'all\nabout what we're doing so what's going\non with this whole healthy gamer thing\nlike where where how did we get started\nwhat are we doing now um there's been a\nlot of community concern I think some of\nit is like back and forth all discussion\nhas been fantastic about things like\ncoaching and we recently launched\nmemberships and some people are\nconcerned about oh my God like we're pay\nWalling content now and like we thought\nHG was like better than that and stuff\nshould be free those are all super valid\nconcerns and I I I actually think that\nit's completely reasonable for people to\nsay that right because that's how we\nstarted like we just started out\noffering accessible Mental Health\nResources on the internet and like the\nvast vast majority of what we do is free\nso today I I thought that we would\ninstead of just focusing on on that one\nthing what I'd love to do today and\nhopefully gruy will join me at some\npoint is we just want to talk to youall\nabout like what we're thinking where we\nstarted where we want to go how we're\nplanning on getting there and why we do\nthe things that we do um and so I was\nhoping she would be here by now and and\nso I could just Dive Right In but that's\nwhat we want to talk about we'll\nprobably spend about I guess 45 minutes\nor an hour talking about this and then\nyou know we'll answer questions if\nyouall want and then depending on what\nthe vibe is like we can do like more\ntraditional HG stuff so I'm totally like\nI'm well rested today I kind of canceled\nmy morning um I spent a couple hours in\nbed this morning uh and just just\ncanceled my morning because I was just\nburnt out because I I've streamed like\nfour times today and I'm like writing a\nbunch and things like that so I just\nlike needed a\nbreak um so now the on the upside it's\nlike noon and I just I'm starting work\nright the second and so so this is fun\nwhich means I've got some energy so we\ncan just do whatever yall want like\nafter we're done maybe we'll all be\nwiped and we all want to go home who\nknows um yeah\nso\nuh yeah so so uh boopy the fox says I\nreally want to support the stream and\nget access to extra content and I am\nable to afford but I literally cannot\npay because I'm based in Russia anything\nI can do besides moving so so first\nthing is like I want to say we hear that\nloud and clear so let me you guys let's\njust get\nstarted let's just get started so we're\ngoing to address that and I want to\nexplain to you why we do stuff for\nfree and why we don't do stuff for free\nand what the thinking is behind that\nwhat the goals are behind that is that\nlike are you all cool with that is that\nokay like we're going to talk about the\nHG Mission we're going to talk about\npeople who have these concerns right cuz\na lot of y'all and this is stuff that\nI'm like I'm actually really proud that\nwe've gotten\nhere\num as far as we have\nso let's start from the top all right so\nhere is a human on the\ninternet and the first problem is\nthat mental health is the only specialty\nof medicine that is getting worse so if\nyou look at\noutcomes as we dump more money into\ncancer research cardiovascular research\ndiabetes research we have things like\nOIC right which is this miracle diabetes\ndrug oh my God this stream is not\nsponsored by OIC I'm not recommending\nthat you take OIC I'm saying if you want\nOIC go talk to your\ndoctor but if you look at despite all\nthe research and despite gigantic\nadvances in our understanding of the\nmind and I think like big ones are\nthings like the\nMRI so we thought that like okay now we\nhave a way of like looking inside the\nbrain and if we can look inside the\nbrain then we'll understand like why\npeople are mentally ill but despite all\nthis research funding and stuff like\nthat mental health is actually getting\nworse it's the only thing that it's the\nonly field of medicine where we're\nlosing the war so some of this stuff is\nrelated to pandemic but I don't think\nit's all pandemic so like people will\nsay like oh my God the pandemic is\nruining people's mental health and it\ndid but I think the\npandemic was certainly bad but I think\nwhat really happened is the pandemic\nexposed all of the weaknesses in our\nsystem and and it accelerated a decline\nin mental health that was already\nhappening and has continued to happen\npost pandemic so we're losing the\nwar and then Along Comes little baby Dr\nK and this is before I was Dr K this is\nAlo who has a medical\ndegree woohoo yay I finished med school\nand Olo had Ambitions little baby Olo\nhad Ambitions little baby Alo was going\nto be a very very successful person was\ngoing to be a holistic healer was going\nto be an\noncologist and use the power of yoga and\nmeditation combined with the latest\nscience to cure people of\ncancer because that is a noble\ngoal that's what real doctors\ndo and then\nI sort of fell in love with Psychiatry\nbecause the mind is my favorite\norgan and then the other thing that\nhappened is when I was training to\nbecome a psychiatrist I had a couple of\nvery formative conversations in my\nsecond year of\nresidency and I asked people basically\nlike what do you all think about tech\naddiction specifically video game\naddiction and what I was stunned by is\nthat like the leaders in the field of\nPsychiatry these are people like who are\nprofessors of Psychiatry at Harvard\nMedical School chief of psychiatry at\nplaces like Massachusetts General\nHospital and mlan Hospital which are\nbasically the number one and number two\npsychiatric hospitals like in the United\nStates definitely top five in the world\nthey basically like compete with each\nother I'm sure there are other great\ninstitutions out there like Yale is\nawesome like Stanford is great like UCLA\nis awesome um there's T tons of um we're\ngoing to need you can you get yourself a\nchair I'm on a roll do you no okay okay\nso I was talking to these people and\nthey're like yeah like nothing's really\ngoing on so like this is back in 200\nmaybe 16 or 17 I thought Tech addiction\nwas a huge problem I thought it was\ngoing to get worse and like basically it\nwas like not on the radar of people who\nwere sort of leading the field back in\n2016 2017 this isn't just these people I\nalso spoke with like the president of\nthe American Psychiatric association and\nI said like what's the apa's plan to\ndeal with this and they're like we\ntotally acknowledge it's a concern but\nwe've got an OP crisis that's like\npeople are overdosing on opiates and\nthat's what we're focused on right now\nwhich is also completely fair I don't\nblame these people for like not you know\nsounding the alarm Bells like six or\nseven years\nago so then what happened is I started\nto realize I started to become somewhat\nsuccessful and then I started to build\nup this like private practice of like\nholistic Psychiatry where I had like you\nknow like CEOs and crap like that like\ncome into my office and I was teaching\nabout the basically what I teach yall\nbut I was doing it for people who are um\nsomewhat well off\nand then like one day I realized that\nlike those are not the people that need\nmy help like sure they can benefit from\nit but there's a line of people out the\ndoor who can help these people and like\nmy people that are the degenerate Gamers\nso I started streaming on\nTwitch and when I started streaming on\nTwitch um it was really great like I\nreally enjoyed it and then like I\nstarted like connecting with the\ncommunity and stuff like that a lot of\npeople don't know this but you know for\nthis first 6 months of HG maybe eight\nmonths I also ran a group on Discord\nwhere I would show up on Discord\nThursday evenings for about 60 minutes\nI'd give a talk about some kind of topic\nand then I'd like answer questions and\nstuff like that and then we would like\nmeditate and whatever and there were\nabout 30 people that showed up this was\nHG at its Inception it was really great\nbecause it was like first name basis\nwith everyone there I got to know\neveryone 15 people would show up every\nweek you know uh rotating like some\npeople would miss and some people would\ncome and and it was was really great I\nwas like I had this little group of\npeople we were lean we were mean we were\nsmall no one was really paying attention\nto\nus and then what happened is like we\nstarted to grow and then as we started\nto grow like things started to change\nand this is kind of what I want to talk\nto you all about and you want to say hi\nor or scoot in yeah sure we're gonna\nhave to take turns because the mic is\nnot set up\nfor yeah that's annoying just move the\nmic no no but then come on the side okay\nand then I'll scoot this way I know it's\nkind of weird but I think this is going\nto be better technical is isues like the\ngood old days yes yeah we're not you\nknow\nokay um\nso then as we started to grow we started\nto have a problem which was that\neveryone wanted to work with Dr K so I\nwas getting at the most 10,000 requests\nfor people uh to work with me in my\nprivate practice per month that was the\nheight I think\nand so then like I have a problem right\nbecause there's no way that I like can\nsee 10,000 people a month let let alone\nwhatever I can see maybe at most like 30\npeople 40 if I really push myself so\nthat's just not going to work and this\nis in the backdrop of a mental health\ncrisis and so like the old Solutions are\nnot working anymore and I even saw let\nme show you all\nsomething um can you put this over there\nuh I I can in a second\nokay\num so like this is in in the backdrop of\nstuff like this right so the other thing\nthat's going on is psychologists can't\nmeet the growing demand for mental\nhealth care so this is stuff like over\nhalf said they had no openings for new\npatients weight lists are three months\nor longer and nearly 40% said that their\nweight list has grown in the past year\nso this is just a survey of\npsychologists it's not you know it's not\nlike a peer-reviewed research or\nanything but one of the things that I\nstarted to really believe is that our\ncurrent mental health system is not\nworking right and this is why we're\nlosing the war on mental health because\nthis sort of idea of like okay I'm going\nto go see my psychiatrist or therapist a\nsmall subset of the people needs to do\nthis I'm going to do this for about a\nyear or two I mean some people are in\ntherapy for like decades right and it's\nnot a knock on them or their therapists\nbut there's just not this is not working\nlike something fundamentally is like not\nworking despite the fact that we're\nadvanc in in Neuroscience you've got uh\ndrug companies that are just investing\ntons and tons and tons of money in\nmental health and one of the reasons for\nthat is that often times a drug company\nthat has a medication for someone who\nhas a mental health problem has a\nlifelong patient so it's like a good bet\nfor them because our medications manage\nsymptoms they don't treat root causes um\nand that's not a knock on the drug\ncompany it's just like their perspective\nis like okay so if I take all of the\ndifferent diagnoses that can help if I'm\ntreating an infection I can sell one\nweeks of one week of of antibiotics and\nI'm helping someone with their anxiety I\ncan treat them for 30 years right and I\ndon't think that's nefarious I think\nit's just like you can have a customer\nfor a week or you can have a customer\nfor 30 years which one are you GNA pick\nit's the way the model is built right\nit's just how how it is yeah um so I\ncannot see thank you should we get you a\ndifferent\nchair okay I'll go get get you a\ndifferent chair in a second\nokay so this is kind of what I was\nseeing and so like I wasn't quite sure\nhow we're going to tackle this problem\nand the story of HG has basically been a\nseries of experiments to try to tackle\nthis problem to try to tackle the\nfundamental problem that one person an\narmy of therapists seeing people one\nhour a week for like some number of\nyears is insufficient to manage the\nMental Health crisis I mean people are\ntrying that right people are trying the\narmy of therapists\napproach\nso that so but at the beginning things\nwere fine because here's Dr K and I'm\nstreaming and I'm teaching\npeople about mental health we're also\ndoing some things like uh we're teaching\nyouall to meditate and things like that\nso when we're getting tons of these\nrequests this is the first thing that\nhappens is I start to ask myself can I\nteach other people to do what I do and\nthat's where our coaching program was\nborn it wasn't like I didn't start out\nto start a coaching program so we're\ngetting 10,000 requests a month there's\nI could tell people and I tell youall\nevery stream to go see a therapist right\nand then like a very common thing that\nwe get is like that's not feasible for\nme and that's like half of y'all half of\ny'all are for from countries where\ntherapists are very very hard to find or\ndon't exist or push religion or anything\nelse so like the gold standard of\ntreatment for mental health is not\naccessible for the majority of the\npopulation this is the fundamental\nproblem\nso then the question is okay if like a\nhighly trained psychiatrist or therapist\nis not available to you then what H what\ncan we do so I'd also done a lot of\nPublic Health work he he's an mph I\ndon't know if you'll know that um and\nthen so so I like looked at the peer\nsupport model and this was also like\nbased on my training right so what I\nnoticed is that here I am a psychiatrist\nwho's very competent but my patients are\ngetting a ton out of AA that I can't\nprovide so I can be an addiction\npsychiat and I can explain to them like\nthe Neuroscience of the brain and all\nthis kind of stuff but like I don't know\nwhat it's like to be addicted to heroin\nand there's some kind of help that you\ncan offer if you have like lived through\nit and survived a problem this is just a\nfundamental like part of humanity and so\nthere's also growing research and there\nare organizations like the World Health\nOrganization the United Nations which\nare all basically saying like we need to\nbe doing more peer support and then I\nasked around like and I even talked to\npeople like in the office of the US\nSurgeon General and I was\nlike where I have a huge population of\npeople who are struggling with their\nmental health which peer support\nprograms can I send them to yeah and\nafter talking\nto these\ninstitutions they were like they don't\nexist at scale at scale right so you may\nhave like some group somewhere in like\nColumbus Ohio or something like that\nthat does something around Tech\naddiction but that the nothing exists\nthat scale okay so then we started\ncoaching can I interject with kind of\nwhat I was seeing so hi I'm cie I'm Mrs\nk um I'm Miss cruy in chat um it's good\nto see you guys it's been a long time\nso this my day job is very boring\ncompared to getting to hang out with you\nguys but in the meantime when Al was\nrunning these 30 member Discord groups I\nwas a stay-at-home mom and I was I\nremember being next in the Next Room\ngiving our kids a bath and and I was\nthinking how do we do this and then I\nwent to business school for Healthcare\nManagement and as Al was telling me more\nand more about what's going on what he\nwanted to build I would think okay\nhere's here's the three problems I'm\nseeing it's not affordable so whatever\nwe do has to be affordable it's not\naccessible right it's local it's um\nwhether it's insurance covered whether\nyou can get there at 2:00 on a Tuesday\nthings like that so accessibility was a\nbig part of it it's not inclusive right\nit there's not a get it Factor if you're\ngoing into somebody's office as a\n20-year-old college student you're\nprobably going to be working with like a\n55y old person they don't relate at all\nso we said okay whatever we build has to\nbe affordable accessible inclusive and\nthat that's kind of how whatever we\nbuild at healthy gamer outside of all's\nbrain that's kind of the North Star okay\nkeep going yeah thank you yeah so then\nwe kind of so now we've got we stream\nright and then we've got coaching but\nthen there's a problem with coaching so\ncoaches are very effective like we spent\na lot of time developing our program\nlike we really believe in it part of the\nreason that we talk about it so much is\nnow we have like tons of data that it is\nvery effective um so we like were\nfeatured this year at the American\nPsychiatric association uh based on like\nwhat we're doing with with our coaching\nprogram and stuff like that those kinds\nof outcomes um and so we've also got a\ncouple of studies that we're running on\nthe program we hope to publish our first\nuh outcomes very soon so then you know\npeople can look at everything and\nanalyze the data and stuff but then we\nsort of started to run into like an\ninteresting problem right so we're\nmaking a ton of stuff for free right so\nstreams and\nwhatnot um just to be clear free to you\nguys expensive to us right well well\nyeah I'm getting that so so here's the\nthing that like I think is not hard to\nunderstand but I think even I don't\nreally think about this stuff and I\ndidn't really understand this\nuntil I started building free stuff and\nI went to business school so here's the\nthing so free stuff costs money right\nlike y'all get that right obviously and\nthen here's the thing as you grow free\nstuff and you offer more free\nstuff right so like\nDiscord and then a Discord that has\n10,000 people versus 87,000 people which\nis I think where we are now um as you\noffer stuff like resource packs as you\nhave thumbnail editors right so then we\nhad like an additional very simple\nproblem which is I stream on Twitch and\nthen like where does that live so then\nwe start uploading things to YouTube If\nyou upload things to YouTube that's an\nadditional cost I'm not saying it's\nsuper high but what I'm saying is like\nthe more free stuff you offer and the\nmore free things that you\ndo the more money you need which is like\nI know it's a stupid thing but like I\ndid not get that at the outset well um\nthat's what kind of made it awesome we\ndidn't want to\nbuild we didn't I think that's what made\nit special yeah anyway so like I just I\ndidn't quite grasp that at the beginning\nand so if you think about an\norganization right so let's say there's\nan organization that provides free\nwidgets the bigger you become the more\nyour costs increase but your like\nrevenues don't increase\ncompensatorily now some people may say\nlike okay but don't you guys get ad\nrevenue and stuff like that from YouTube\nabsolutely but there are a couple things\nto consider there the first is that we\nare trying to do more than just be a\nYouTube Creator and we're going to talk\nto that in a second because our goal\nhere is not to make a revenue neutral or\nprofitable content channel it's to\nactually try to solve this problem of\nlike Tech addiction and losing the war\non mental health and we'll get to that\nin a second and so maybe if all I was\ndoing was content like that would be\nfine but we're actually trying to do\nother things so as we're trying to solve\nthis problem like let me just give you\nall a sense of like what I think needs\nto happen to solve this problem so do we\nneed so we can make content so we need\nto educate the public\nbut then also like sometimes educating\npeople isn't enough right in fact most\nof the time education doesn't solve\nproblems there's a bazillion interview\nuh uh YouTube videos out there like Tik\ntoks whatever take your platform of\nchoice about how to exercise how to eat\nhealthy it doesn't actually get people\nto exercise and eat healthy or it\ndoesn't work at a very high fidelity\nright so for every T every hundred\nvideos that you watch on cooking a\ndish you may make like 1 to 10 that's\njust the way that Education Works\num what okay so second thing that we\nneed to do is I sort of noticed that\nthere's a we were also hearing a lot of\nPE people from the community so this is\nwhere kind of peer support comes in so\nthis is a a more scalable way to support\nindividual people to make behavioral\nchange and that's what our program is is\nkind of built on um but then there are a\ncouple of other things that we need to\ndo the first thing is that I know that\nDr K is great and all but we actually\ndon't know whether what we're building\nworks right like do you all get like we\nhave no idea well this is just backing\nup right like if you think about what is\nfundamentally kind of flawed in the\ntherapist patient relationship or\nregardless of any doctor patient coach\nclient whatever that relationship is\nthere's no accountability right if you\ndon't have a good experience with your\ntherapist who do you tell maybe your\ntherapist but even then your therapist\nwill probably be like well that's\nbecause you see the world this way or\nthat way and so if you don't have\naccountability you can't I don't know\nyou're you're stuck with what you get\nand that's kind of the end and we didn't\nwant to build something with no\naccountability we also didn't want to\nbuild something\nwhere I don't know\nthat had this paternalistic like I know\neverything you know nothing kind of\nsituation which is you got to sit\nforward can y'all hear me or no you have\nto get really close to the mic the way\nset up like this yeah okay this is very\nuncomfortable was very awkward all right\nall I was saying is you know from the\noutset what we wanted to build was\nsomething that fixed the fundamental\nproblems that we saw in mental health\nand one of those is\naccountability so\nwe didn't want to just kind of say like\nall right here's your coach the end\ngoodbye it was really important to us\nthat it have integrity that you have a\nway to escalate that you have a way to\nsay this isn't working for me that there\nare good feedback loops not only with\nyour coach but with the organization not\nonly with the organization if you said\nhey this is like icky there's ethics Pro\nprotocols like whatever it might be we\ndidn't want people stuck in these kind\nof flawed models okay so we decided that\nwe also wanted to build an a research\ninfrastructure because we need to be\nable to study the efficacy of what we're\nbuilding so we know whether it works or\nnot and then there are other things that\nwe need to do as well so the other thing\nthat we were hearing a lot so I just saw\na great comment I mean not a great\ncomment sad comment in chat\nabout uh finding a therapist is like\nplaying Russian roulette like you have\nno idea whether you're going to get a\ngood one or bad one so at the same time\nwhat I'm seeing is a deficiency in\neducation for therapists and\npsychiatrists and mental health\nprofessionals as far as I know to get to\nbecome a psychiatrist or a therapist in\nthe United United States today it\nrequires a total of zero hours of\neducation training or clinical\nexperience in dealing with technology\naddiction so what I was hearing t uh\nTime and Time and Time Again part of the\nreason we grew so much is because a lot\nof people were going to therapy for for\ntheir problems and yet we were able to\nhelp them more than their therapist was\nthat's what they would say I'm not\nsaying that it's true or we don't need\nto evaluate that but we're certainly\ngetting that feedback right and that's\njust because we're not trained as\ntherapists in stuff like what what ADHD\nhow porn addiction affects your brain if\nyou walk like watch porn for like 10\nyears we're just not trained in this\nstuff right um and so this is where we\nstarted at HGI so this was like a big\nthing that we did over the last like\nyear and a half where we started this\nthing that actually teach is\nprofessionals so if we really want to\nsolve this problem we got to take kind\nof a Long View and it's not enough for\nus to build it ourselves we also need to\neducate all the other therapists out\nthere about what we've learned working\nfrom you and this is going to be the\nkind of thing that will help hopefully a\n100,000 people over the next 10 years\nright so this is another part of the AOE\nnow the problem with HGI is that it\ndoesn't make any money right now or I\nmean hopefully we'll start generating\nsome Revenue but like when you're\nbuilding something from\nscratch you know it takes it takes money\nright so like we have to invest that\nmoney and then the question is where\ndoes that money come from so other uh\nyeah we'll get back to this so let's\njust talk about money for a\nsecond so we we need money from\nsomewhere right so there's a couple of\ndifferent options so when I was I'm not\ngoing to go into too many details but I\nwas pretty involved at a nonprofit that\nwas devoted towards making the world a\nbetter place\nthrough a particular take on health okay\nwhich was like great and all so it's\nlike one of these places that was really\nfantastic really doing great work and\nthey were kind of a nonprofit and they\nwere donation\nbased so what this actually meant is\nthat first of all you have to spend a\nlot of your time soliciting donations\nright like even like the the most\npowerful people at the nonprofit were\nactually the fundraisers because without\nthe fundraising like the whole thing\nfolds the other really really scary\nthing is that if you are running a\nnonprofit HGI is the HG Institute so\nthat's where we just got accreditation\nfrom the American Psychological\nAssociation um for continuing education\nmodules for therapist so if you are a\ntherapist and you want to get credit for\nlearning from healthy gamer that's where\nyou go yeah and you do get you do get uh\nceu for HGI stuff right so that that\nwhole process we have to like apply and\nfill out applications and fees and all\nthat kind of stuff I think okay let me\nkeep going so so then the other problem\nwith sort of this nonprofit route is\nthat like when a donor comes to you and\nlet's say they've donated a million\ndollars and they say hey like I think we\nshould do this you don't get to say no\nright you all get that so like the the\nreally bizarre thing in my experience\nhaving worked a lot in finance and stuff\nlike that is that like the direction is\ndetermined by the donors because that's\nwhere the money is coming from and I\nwould even argue that when you have so\nthen the second option is profit or\nCapital\nraising right so this is like VC\ncompanies private Equity companies\nraising Capital now once you raise\nCapital you sell a chunk of your company\nyou get a pile of money and then you use\nthat to build but then the problem is\nthat the people that are giving you the\nmoney so over here I would actually say\nthat like you control Less in a\nnonprofit even than you do in a\nfor-profit and the reason for that is\nthat in a for-profit there's\ntransparency everyone knows that hey I'm\ngoing to give you a pile of cash today\nand I want an even bigger pile of cash\nin three years and that's what I expect\nof you and you're going to give me this\nand no matter I I don't care about your\nideals or anything like that but at\nleast there's transparency the problem\non the nonprofit side is that there\nisn't transparency someone gives you a\n$1 million donation and then they're\nlike hey I think we should do this it's\nlike if you say say no what happens like\nno one has a clue so it's really bizarre\nthere's a lot of like psychology\ninvolved there so this is the other\nthing is that we you know we get offers\nto invest like all the time so we've had\noffers to invest from everywhere from\nrandom people on the internet we got our\nfirst buyout offer for HG three months\nafter we started um we've gotten offers\nto invest from like you know normal like\nPE firms and PC firms and things like\nthat but also like some really weird\nplaces like things that I thought were\nlike scams so Sovereign wealth funds of\nlike countries have like approached us\nand been like hey like are yall open to\ntaking raising Capital websites and yeah\nlike these are these are things that you\nget an email from someone and you're\nlike this looks like a scam but it's not\na scam it's actually someone who is from\na country and has access to the\ncountry's bank account and is like we\nwant to invest and thus far we have not\ntaken Capital now I still don't know if\nthat's a good idea or a bad idea and and\nthis is also where like you may say like\nokay like good for you Dr K like yay so\nwe haven't taken Capital because we\ndon't want to surrender so much control\nthat's me personally I think there's\nother gruth is the boss here so it's\nwhat she wants but the the bigger issue\nis that if this is really our goal there\nis no question in my mind that if we\ntake Capital we can probably do better\nright so like there's a reason why\nraising capital investment and taking\ncapital is like the standard that's how\neveryone does it and the reason that\neveryone does it is it's because\nprobably because it's the most effective\nmodel to actually like accomplish\nsomething so if you look at all of the\ncompanies out there that are super\nsuccessful all of them have taken\ncapital and that's one of the reasons\nwhy they're all super\nsuccessful we haven't done it yet okay\nnow the next kind of way that we can\nmake money is things like\nsponsorships so this too is something\nthat we've started to do more and and\nthis is the you know we've had some\nsponsorships from like companies like\nBabel or like factor or whatever but\nwhat a lot of people don't know is that\num we\nget very large sponsorship offers from\ncompanies that we generally turn down\nand I I'm not going to go into too much\ndetail here but just to give you all a\nsense of the scale if you project out\nall of our revenue from YouTube\nmemberships for one year we we have\ngotten sponsorship offers that will give\nthat to us in one month so all of the\nmoney that we're going to generate from\nYouTube memberships over the course of\nthe year we've gotten offers we'll pay\nyou that every month we just want to\nsponsor your videos right and we're not\nsaying that that's bad right that they\nhave an angle so one of the nice things\nabout our YouTube channel for example is\nthat we're in the highest tier of\ncompensation for our videos so our\nvideos make the most money on YouTube\nlike in terms of like percentage of\nstuff like that and the reason for that\nis because\nadvertisers pay the highest price to\nadvertise on our videos because of the\nnature of what that is so we've we've\nseen kind of\nfirsthand like the dollar signs in\npeople's eyes when they realize how much\nthey can influence this community and\nwe've become very protective of you guys\nand this isn't I I I'm not telling y'all\nthis because I want all to think of us\nas Saints please God do not do that\nwe'll talk about the cult stuff in a\nsecond if y all think about us as Saints\nit's an\nimpossible thing for us to live up to\nand it's just going to open you up to\ndisappointment right like I have never\nclaimed to be anything beyond an\nordinary human I'm just talking to y'all\nbecause I trust y'all this is a\nrelationship this is just explaining to\ny'all where we're coming from don't look\nat this and say oh my God like he's so\namazing because then tomorrow if we\ndecide to take a sponsorship then it's\nlike I've fallen from Grace so don't put\nme up on a pedestal to begin with we're\njust being we're laying it out for y'all\nokay when we're not there's more so then\nthe other thing which some people in\nchat have noticed is when I talk about\nsponsorships I'm not talking about\nstreaming\ndeals right so but we're not exclusive\nwith any platform and this is another\nway that we could make a ton of money\nright so we could assign\nexclusivity with a particular platform\nand and like depending on which platform\nthat is we would receive piles and piles\nof money depending on which platform and\nthere are some platforms out there that\nwould be very very very happy to\nhave one of the most one of the largest\nmental health content creators streaming\nexclusively on their platform so and\nthis is like this is the thing okay so\nthis is\nlike $1 sign this is like $5 signs this\nis also like maybe $3 signs this is like\nI don't know maybe like five or 10 more\nless less less okay I don't know anyway\nthis is very like 2021 okay yeah so that\njust another thing like it's been a wild\ncouple of years yeah\nso the the next thing is\num we\nalso so so this is where money can come\nfrom right so then then the other things\nthat we sort of have is and then we kind\nof have our we can generate our own\nmoney from our\ncommunity so for example like people\nhave been telling us oh Dr K you should\nstart a patreon people have been telling\nme this for four years so the reason I\nhaven't started a patreon is really\nreally really simple I feel weird asking\npeople for money for like free we'll do\nit we'll do it from time to time there\nhave been times where we'll do like\nsabatons and whatever but you all know\nwe don't do this much like maybe once a\nyear right and and that's where like it\njust feels weird so like if if y'all are\ncoming to me for help and I give you\nhelp and then I say like oh please give\nme money it puts people in a really\nweird situation does that make\nsense um and do yall do y'all kind of\nget that that I think this is airplane\nmode okay turn thank you so so it's not\nI'm not saying that we won't do patreon\nin the future or stuff like it just kind\nof feels weird so what always felt way\nbetter to me is like Hey we're gonna\nthere's going to be a fixed price you\nknow what you're getting\nyou know what the value is and like\nwe're going to sell this thing to you\nyou know what you get we're going to\nmake it as affordable as\npossible and like it's kind of clear\nright so I personally feel weird like\nhey I'm going to like do this like\nsacrifice for you oh like Dr K is\nsacrificing himself he's such a good\nhuman being and he's like please please\nplease okay donate okay like we are\ndoing God's work we are doing wonderful\nthings we are making World better place\nn give me money n so there's a thousand\npeople out there there who are gurus or\nlike religious people or like people who\nare doing the Lord's work or God's work\nor whatever and like many of them make\ntons and tons and tons of money using\nthis model that is not a model that I\nwant to be a part of so I've had the\nopportunity to become a spiritual Guru\nfor a while now it's not something I'm\ninterested in there's all kinds of\nproblems with it I much prefer and this\nis something I learned as a psychiatrist\nright so as a psychiatrist like you're\nyou're a medical doctor you're helping\npeople but you're getting paid for it\nit's so much clean\nthere's no like you owe me and then the\nquestion is how much and what do a lot\nof religions do they say\n10% that is not a model I feel\ncomfortable\nwith okay I'm not saying that these\npeople who are religious are good or bad\nit's just not my model I'm not a guru I\ndon't pretend to be a guru this is my\nwife we have kids I will sometimes enjoy\nthings like sweets and alcohol and\ncaffeine and like I'm living a worldly\nlife I'm an ordinary person that's what\nI want to\nbe so the next thing to consider is then\nwe get to our things like let's let's\nsay\ncoaching\nguides and now\nmemberships right so these are the ways\nthat yall can give us money now here's\nhere's the main thing that I think um W\ngo ahead what there's the\nfoundation talk about it later um so so\nthe the next thing is so if we kind of\nlook at this here's one thing that I\nthink we haven't done a very good job of\nof explaining or even sharing when we\noffer something at HG it isn't for\neveryone so this is the other big thing\nthat we learned if we look at our\naudience different people want different\nthings have different resources\nand need different things okay that's\nwe're done they want different things\nand they have different resour sources\nso some people are totally content with\n20-minute YouTube\nvideos some people have no money some\npeople have some money some people have\na lot of money and so when we kind of\nlook at this some people want in-depth\nlectures some people want something like\na\nguide right like some people want like I\nwant 10 hours that that Dr K is going in\ndepth about a particular thing totally\nfine other people are like I just want\nan hour I want two hours I want a\nworkshop this is why we've also done\nthings like we tried our first\nWorkshop um and and\nso not everyone is looking for the same\nthing and we've sort of discovered this\nin our community that like a fully half\nor more of our community is completely\ncontent never spending a dollar and just\nwatching like two YouTube videos a week\nabout about [ __ ] that kind of interests\nthem or they like I there's so many\npeople in our community who will like\nlisten to us on Spotify while they work\nout listen to us on our commute and like\nthey're happy with that they're happy to\njust sort of like take content the way\nthat it's delivered now and the other\nthing to also remember is that the\ninternet is a very different place from\nwhat it was four years ago the style of\ncontent that people respond to ask for\nand like kind of support is changing too\neverything is becoming more short form\nso when we build this stuff I don't know\nthat like we're not we don't want all of\nthis stuff we don't want all of y'all I\nmean if you want to do it go for it but\neach of these things are built for\ndifferent people because a big part of\nour mission is to meet people where\nthey're at and our community is\nheterogeneous it's not all the same so\nmeeting people where they're at means\nmoving to a lot of different places and\nthis is why we design the things the way\nthat we do because some of y'all so\ncoaching is let's say uh 30 to 50 bucks\na week okay guides are what are they\nnow 25 25 right and this is speaking of\nridiculousness so the most common\nfeedback we get on the guides are\nthey're awesome and you're chronically\nunderpricing and one person there's this\nhilarious post I saw in our subreddit\nwhere someone was like wait the guides\nare not a subscription and we're like no\ndude it's like this was back when they\nwere 20 bucks you pay 20 bucks once and\nyou get it right\nbecause like we get that people can't\nafford subscriptions we didn't have a\nsubscription at that point we couldn't\neven generate the content but like\nthere's is also like I'm a boomer so I\ngrew up prior to the days of DRM and it\n[ __ ] makes me livid that like\neverything out there is now like\nstreaming and it's like you don't own\nanything um and so that actually like\nand the cool thing is there's devs on\nour side who are like feel the same way\nand so they're like [ __ ] that right but\nthis is also a world where there's\n$25 horse\narmor\nDLC this one cosmetic for amount in one\nvideo game earned more money than\nStarcraft 2 wings of Liberty this is the\nworld that we live in so there's\nsubscription stuff and people are like\nout there there's a group of people out\nthere who are willing to pay for\n[ __ ] right so like if I'm going to ask\nyouall to pay for something it's not\ncosmetic right there's like real value\nto something I would hope that I mean\nthat's my internal compass and you can\nsay to me Dr K [ __ ] you I disagree there\nis real a real value in the horse armor\nDLC and and that's fine like that's just\na judgment I'm making like I don't\npurchase\nCosmetics anyway\nso different people want different stuff\nand different people have different\nthresholds to pay and so then like what\nwe actually realized is like as we\nstarted Ed growing and these numbers\nstarted growing we started to realize\nlike oh [ __ ] this is not going to work\nand this kind of it comes to sort of the\nthe last thing which is that if we sort\nof talk about mental health what we're\nunderstanding about mental health is\nthat it's way more than education it's\nway more than peer support it's way more\nthan even Psychiatry and therapy there\nare things like\nDiet there are things like so this is\nlike a gap so I'll I'll tell you all\nsomething that we're working on very\nactively is skills\nbuilding and\naccountability so what is the next step\nfor HG so the next step for HG is to try\nto create something that incentivizes\nyall to actually [ __ ] do\nsomething so you can listen to a YouTube\nvideo and we'll offer some like thing at\nthe end where you kind of go in a\ndirection we have a lot of in-depth\nstuff in the guides where we'll say you\ncan do this meditation or this\nmeditation you can do this EX exercise\nbut this is where stuff like right in\nthe fields was\nborn and our the community people who\nand our devs who developed right in the\nfields are\nbrilliant we built something right so\nthis is like our own we pay for devs so\nlike you know we have a team of devs\nthat programs this stuff from\nscratch that will actually teach you\nskills to increase your EQ and right in\nthe fields and touch\ngrass where the the two most successful\ncommunity events that we had and the\nreason they're successful is because\nthousands of people in our community\nstarted taking walks started meditating\none of the brilliant touch grass things\nwas pick some kind of wild ass fruit and\nturn it into a juice and people did that\nso we can tell you to meditate but\nactually getting you to meditate is way\nharder but if we want to fix this\nthis war on Mental Health that we're\nlosing this is what we need to\nfix the problem is that this is not easy\nto do right like this is the problem\nwith Humanity this is why OIC is such a\nblockbuster drug because you can't get\npeople to eat healthy it's way easier to\nget them to like take a pill but I am\nnot content just because the world has\nfailed at this does not mean that I'm\ncontent at like saying that that this is\nimpossible possible and and the fcking\npeople in our community and this is this\nis why it works it's not going to be\ndeveloped by an expert like me it's\ngoing to be developed by someone who\nunderstands what these struggles are and\nthis is the beauty of HG is that like\nyou know the the brain this is the\nbrainchild of if you all know Tech\nteller and maybe that's unfair because\nI'm not crediting other people like\ntrinian or or or devs and stuff like\nthat but this is the brainchild of tech\nteller if youall know who Tech teller is\nand if you've like been to our subreddit\nor you show up on stream you know who\nTech teller is and Tech teller is\namazing right this this guy is in a\ndifferent country and his work day is\nfrom like 700 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. so that\nhe can be in meetings with us the dude\nhas sacrificed so much and has built so\nmuch and like this is amazing like what\nwhat we were able to build and then\ny'all went with it you guys actually did\nit now the problem is that building this\ncosts\nmoney and we didn't charge for it and\nthe reason we didn't charge for it is\nbecause someone was saying I'm from\nRussia and I can't afford it so now\nwe're kind of stuck and this doesn't\neven get to the pie and the sky stuff\nright so one of the things that I kind\nof noticed when I went to\nashrams is we can say that gut\nmicrobiome is really important for\nmental health we can say you should eat\nthis healthy kind of diet and you should\ndo this and you should do this but the\nreason that ashrams are good for mental\nhealth is because people cook for you\nthey have all the recipes they have all\nthis the special stuff the this like\nsort of yogic diet that is like very\nvery like low in process things is very\ngood for your mut microbiome reduces\nanxiety reduces depression reduces\nthings like that and there's a part of\nme that's like at the end of the day\nI've worked in residential addiction\ntreatment facilities and they're awesome\nI've been to asham and if we're really\ntalking about mental health mental\nhealth is your mind is what you\neat who you spend time\nwith what your in environment\nis and I don't know how to fix this I do\nnot know how to provide this for y'all\nbut honestly that's what it's going to\ntake I have no idea so does this mean a\nbrick-and-mortar facility one day we've\ntalked about it the reason that we've\nshied away from it is because if we had\na brick-and mortar facility like a rehab\nor like and by the way you know I got an\namazing job offer from someone who is\nlike will build you a technology\nAddiction Rehab and we'll give you 3\nyears to be profitable come and build it\nwe'll like we'll do everything right so\nwe've gotten these and I think it would\nbe good the person was really awesome\nreally good human being who's really\ntrying to make the world a better\nplace and and so it was like you know we\ncould do this but this all takes money\nand this is what it's going to take and\nthen the problem is even if even if we\ndo this let's say that hypothetically we\nbuild something like a rehab facility\nwhere in my heart of hearts I've had so\nmany conversations about\nthis I've talked to people who are\nmembers of our community who are retired\nCEO former CEOs at the age of like 30\nwho are like if you want to build it\nlike let's do it bro but then the\nproblem is that even if we build this\nand it's like this place where you come\nand stay for 30 days we're going to cook\nfor you we're going to teach you yoga\nwe're going to learn this meditation\nstuff yall are going to go through\nclasses and workshops and whatever like\nthat would be awesome but then the\nquestion is who actually shows up\nbecause that's not I mean I mean this\nkind of [ __ ] you know one of the places\nthat I worked charges 50k a month and\nthey're\nfull so this level of service that's a\nlittle bit different because it's\nAddiction Rehab and and you know people\nare willing to pay and things like that\nbut there are like technology addiction\nlike residential treatment facilities in\nthe United States that like you know\nstart at 20K a month so even if we say\nlet's say we do it on the cheaper side\nwhich is 20K a\nmonth like would we make it ton of money\nabsolutely you bet your ass we would but\nwho gets to\ncome the people who can afford 20K a\nmonth the person in Russia may not be\nable to come we're leaving like that\nperson gets left behind even at a $10\nmembership but 99% of y'all get left\nbehind but if you honestly want to know\nwhat it takes to fix your mental health\nthis is\nit the mind is the only organ of the\nbody that requires other human beings so\nyou need a positive POS environment you\nneed other people there who are [ __ ]\nnon-toxic right and we what yall need\nmore than anything else is a life\ntransplant and that's where like I I\ndon't say that to be mean but honestly\nlike I believe that because that's what\nhappened to me I was 21 years old\nfailing out of college and [ __ ]\nnothing and I went to a place where\nsomeone cooked me food where people were\nlike positive and taught me how my mind\nworks and it turned my life around and\nall of the data that we're seeing from\nPsychiatry is that this is what it takes\ngreen space correlates with mental\nhealth sunlight exposure exercise\npets dogs and horses are the two best\nanimals to treat people with trauma and\nso like if I in my heart of hearts what\nI want to do more than anything else is\nlike I want to find a\nfarm true like I I mean gruy Reigns Me\nIn from this [ __ ] all the time and it's\nlike if we really want to go cult mode\nlike we can go cult mode right we can we\ncan buy a it's not a farm it's a ranch\nit's just land right now it's land it's\nranch right CU that's where Cults go\nthey don't go to Farms they go to\nranches but I'm telling yall like when\nyou start growing your own food and you\nlike put your hands in the soil and like\nthat's really good for your mental\nhealth the one of the best things I do\nfor mental health is weeding I go out in\nmy backyard and I weed stuff okay\nthere's a lot more on the other side I\nknow I haven't done my mental health is\ndeclining because I'm not weeding enough\nright so but but I mean this is kind of\nwhat I'm talking about but like if this\nis what it takes how do we get there I\nhave no\nidea and so this is like where we're\ncoming from we're not trying to do [ __ ]\nto just like make money right if we were\ndoing that we would have just taken a\nsponsorship and the last thing that I\nwant to say is you guys can look at this\nand you can say oh Dr K you should do\nthis and you may be right I don't know\nif you're right or wrong but the one\nthing that I can guarantee you is each\nperson in the art not each person but\nevery I'm just going to say this is not\ntrue each person in the audience thinks\nthat there is a different right path\nright some of y'all will say let's say\npeople who are from like developing\ncountries right and we're really proud\nlike I've had a couple of moments where\nI've actually been proud of the work\nthat I am doing and that's not most days\none day one day that I felt like immense\nPride for the work that we're doing is\nwhen I discovered that we had someone\nwho purchased the guide in swasiland\nlike I was like [ __ ] yeah this is what\nwe started out to do because they've got\nnothing that was country number 100\nswasiland was 100 mhm we're up to like\n121 now yeah so the other thing is that\neven though we screw up from time to\ntime and we haven't even gotten into all\nof our fuckups and for those of y'all\nthat remember hypy hypo groups like you\nknow like we used to do product\ndevelopment with like Dr K has a random\nID on the internet and let's go that\nonly works when there's like 30 of us\nthat was such a disaster people were\nsigning up for this [ __ ] and paying for\nit and they didn't even understand what\nthe [ __ ] was going on even the people\nrunning the groups were like what's the\ndifference between a high performance\nand high potential and I was like I\ndon't know it's kind of this and so we\nwe've sort of built into this like more\nstandard company and the reason for that\nis because you can't do stuff like off\nthe seat of your pants I mean that's how\nyou end up as a canceled streamer right\nlike you can't you can't do that\nand so the struggle that we face is that\nyou know each of y'all may say oh Dr K\nyou should do this you should just make\nit a\nnonprofit by the way or you should just\ndo this just take the sponsorships\nbecause then all the people in Ethiopia\nyou know they get stuff for free and\nyou're taking the sponsors money the\nproblem that we face is whichever one we\ndo a different part of our community is\ngoing to be frustrated with us a\ndifferent part of our community will be\ndisappointed with us each of y'all may\nknow what the right right answer is the\nproblem that we face is that y'all don't\nagree right and this is why I'm grateful\nfor all of the feedback they all provide\nseriously we're doing this stream\nbecause so many people have been posting\nmeta stuff about H which is really\nhealthy right like there is a there's\nsomething in The Ether of our community\nwhere we need to stop and think about\nwhat we're doing and where we're going\nand what's the right way to get\nthere and so I appreciate when\neveryone's like okay like this is like\nDr K is now like pay Walling helpful\ncontent that goes against the ethos of\nHG and they're not wrong the problem\nis and this is the last thing that I'll\nkind of talk about so here's another\nlike real thing that we struggle with\nthis is very fundamental do we grow so\nI'm going to ask y'all do you think as\nHG we should\ngrow one for yes two for no yeah or we\ncan pull one for yes two for no\nso so like um there's a really good\npoint so Pogo laugh is saying pricing it\ndifferently in different countries could\nhelp more people in lower income\ncountries afford it I completely agree\nRegional pricing is fantastic that way\nand forget about all the stuff like okay\npeople can use vpns to get cheaper\nprices and whatever and and that's where\nlike in my mind if if if you want to use\na VPN to save a couple of bucks like\nwhatever right the problem with regional\npricing is that it's expensive to\nimplement it's also very easy\nto be fraudulent yes circumvent yeah\nokay so the majority of people are\nsaying we're grow so so now now like I\nthink I actually think that the majority\nof people who are saying we should grow\nI challenge that because I don't think\nthat practically youall like what that\nlooks like so the one thing that I've\nreally seen is that when y'all get upset\nwith HG which I don't blame you for cuz\nI would get upset with it I'm I'm upset\nwith it actually because maybe this is\nthe way I feel about\nit the HG that y'all love is the HG that\nexisted when you first joined and any\nchange since then is a step down I'm\nright right like am I right like you\nguys get that right so I liked it better\nwhen Dr K did interviews I liked it\nbetter when Dr K so we we heard this\nwhere we used to do interviews with\npeople right and then what happened is\nwe started interviewing streamers and\nthen everyone was like well not everyone\na lot of people were like really upset\nthey're like why is he interviewing all\nthese\nstreamers and then this is the core\nproblem that we face is if we want to\ngrow then we have to do things\ndifferently right so if this is the\ninternet here I I guess here's like the\nhardcore\nhgs and then when we move from 2our\nstream to 20 minute YouTube video our\nreach increases by this much so now and\nhere's the problem that I have when we\ndo this let's say we help you 50% and\nwhen we do this let's say we help you\n20% I do not\nknow whether what\nthe why is\nit what the thank\nyou still a boomer\nchat so if you look at the area between\nthese two curves okay I do not know\nwhether this is better than this I don't\nknow so she she may\nknow so I don't know like the problem is\nthat each of these things honestly y'all\nlike I don't know what's best I don't\nknow whether we should take money from\nsponsorships and whether that is a\nlesser evil than taking money from from\nlike for V from VC I don't know if it's\na lesser evil to go down the nonprofit\nroute and have some donor who gets to\ndictate what happens because we're\ndependent on the tee of the\ndonor I don't know whether it's like\nbetter to ask y'all to pay for stuff or\nto get some [ __ ] drug company to pay\nfor\neverything right all I know is that\nwhatever we choose a different group of\ny'all will be unhappy and our goal is\nnot necessarily to keep youall happy but\nalso it is very\nimportant our compass is y'all y'all are\nthe ones that tell us hey this is good\nor hey this is bad so we did a workshop\nsome people may be confused so we did\nour first workshop and one seat in the\nworkshop cost $200 the workshop sold out\nin 24 hours and 96% of people who went\nto the workshop said that they would\nhappily pay for another one it was\nfantastic now you could look at this and\nany business-minded person would say\nit's a no-brainer you run one Workshop a\nmonth and like that's all the money\nyou'll ever need why didn't we do that\nbecause if all of our content is\ndeveloping workshops for people who can\npay for $200 a pop then we leave\neverybody else\nbehind and so now the question is how\nmany workshops is it right to build so\nthat we can generate enough money to do\nthis stuff to\nbuild\nthis stuff or this stuff and the answer\nis I don't\nknow okay so this is kind of where we\nare like we try to really think about\nwhat y'all need and we're trying to do\nthis [ __ ] Balancing Act which may be\nan absolute mess um and and I think\nsometimes y'all like we send y'all mixed\nsignals because there's some things that\nwe do that are money oriented and some\nthings that we do that are not and it's\nreally [ __ ] confusing because in the\nworld we think that there are two kinds\nof people they are the good people\nthey're the charitable people and there\nare the greedy people and the problem is\nwe're like halfway between each of those\nthings don't bucket us into either one\nand it's [ __ ] confusing because then\nif we do something that generates money\nhalf of y'all are like cool that's\ntotally fine the value is really good\nand I'm really happy about that because\nthe one thing that I never want to do is\nsell yall $25 horse Armour\nDLC\nright right so like we have a merch\nstore but we don't like push merch right\nand the reason we don't push merch is I\ndon't know that merch will like actually\nmake a big difference in your life so\nfor those of youall that order merch and\nyou like merch like thank you very much\nthe money helps us a lot and and and\nlike it would be different like if I we\nstarted like so we I've been trying to\nI'm so excited about selling meditation\nkits like I want to give you all this\nincense and these malas and all this\nkind of [ __ ] but like we haven't been\nable to put it together so we'll start\npushing merch the second that I believe\nthat the merch will actually help\nyou but but that's the thing is now\nwe're kind of stuck because if we want\nto grow then that means we have to\nchange and if we have to change I want\nto keep doing what we used to be doing\nbut then we have to figure out like I\ndon't know if I should be running\nworkshops because that we make more\nmoney but we reach fewer people okay hi\ncan I just say something so out of\neverything that we do the most expensive\nresource is his time\nso the time we are now spending on\nthings like\nokay so the most expensive resource at\nhealthy gamer is all's time\nand the time that we are spending on\nYouTube videos on resource packs on\nworkshops on\nmemberships the reason we can do that is\nbecause we have taken a couple of Select\nsponsors we have done a couple of paid\ncorporate events things like that but we\nwould rather be building stuff for you\nguys than I don't know talking to a CBD\nsponsor like categorically we don't work\nwith CBD companies right they're the\nones putting all the big money on the\ntable\nbut I don't know it's basically a way\nfor us to kind of reclaim all Oak's time\nto build stuff that we think works best\nfor you guys a lot of it we can do for\nfree some of it we cannot but nobody is\nsaying that you have to do something you\ndon't want to do right if if you don't\nwant to do the membership if it's not in\nyour price range if you don't see the\nvalue don't do it no problem um if you\ndon't want the guides if you'd rather go\nwith the resource packs no problem it's\nnot it's not a forced decision we're\ntrying to build kind of like more of a\nbuffet than like you have to do this\nthan this then this then this and Ju\nJust to be clear so like the reason we\nbuilt res ource packs right so these are\nlike free resources that are\nlongitudinal and are kind of like a\nguide I mean they're not like really\nthey're they're closer to a guide the\nreason we built them is because so many\nof y'all said even the guide is too\nexpensive so then we sat back and we\nstarted to wonder what can we build that\nwe can offer for free and so the\nresource packs are like content plus\nokay friend you have talked too much\nlet's take some\nquestions I think they're every\nhere oh\nokay\nuh we did what is hg's goal just to like\nvery clearly our goal is to make\naccessible affordable inclusive Mental\nHealth Resources for this community\nwe're not trying to solve every problem\nthere is we're trying to serve this\ncommunity I heard a couple of you guys\nor I read a couple of you guys were\nasking well what if we just want to kind\nof\nsupport um we did create a healthy gamer\nFoundation which is a 501c3 nonprofit\nand we're issuing about\n$20,000 of holiday help grants so that's\nour way to kind of give back to this\ncommunity either directly through grants\nlike that or um ideally what we're doing\nis partnering in the industry to run\nresearch projects the industry is in a\nbit of a chaotic moment right now as you\ncan see with the platform\nthe dev Studios laying people off so\nit's been a bit of a slower start than I\nwould have liked but that's where if you\njust want to support\nand kind of take a tax right off that's\nwhere you do\nit um\nokay what is the goal of\ncontent so let's you want to read that\nout sure all right so these are these\nare some questions that have been\nsubmitted through Reddit and YouTube\ncomments um and I want to watch chat too\nbut I really wonder if you could make\nthat bigger all\nlook all right so one question was Dr K\nused to do these in-depth videos but\nthese days most of the videos I see from\nhim are shorter have more clickbait and\nrepeat a lot of old\nConcepts yeah so that's a great\nquestion uh someone also asked me what\ndo I uh what do I H how do I feel about\nthe content that I make so I'd say that\nthe most frustrating thing for me as a\nVata is that for four years I've been\nanswering basically the same 200\nquestions so you're like tech support\nturn it\noff that's a great analogy so it's\nbasically like I'm tech support for the\nmind right so I'm using my racial bonus\nas a is an Indian for my plus five to\ntech support skill try resetting so it's\nit's usually like dc8 checks and I've\ngot like a tech support scale of like 15\nso it's kind of boring so and this is\nwhere like hopefully now youall have a\nlittle bit more context for this\nquestion that's why it's like a hard\nquestion to answer simply so the answer\nfor why we make short kind of Click\nbaity content is because we're making\nthat for everyone who doesn't know who\nwe are right so if our goal is to grow\nthen then we need to reach more people\nand the appeal of people on the Internet\nis changing and so if we want to grow\nand we're not saying that we're like\nwilling to grow at all cost so it's not\nlike we do I mean there's we try to\ndeliver healthy I want to I want to type\nto chat no no you can't you can't you\ncan't type I haven't figured out how to\nI failed my tech support check hold on\nlet's see if we can at least do this\ngive me a second\nchat how are y'all doing though yall\ndoing good view my\nchannel chair sucks the other thing that\nwe did not talk about is um we did not\ndiscuss\nour hold on let's see if I do\nthis at least you can have\nthis this is the best having to watch\nads on your own channel is like yeah\nsuch insult to injury YouTube ads um so\nso yall are right that that content is\nis like changing on the YouTube channel\nso the way that and that's because\nthat's for a different audience right so\nfor those of y'all that are OG gers\nwhere I used to talk for two hours about\nsomething that content is harder and\nharder to produ it's not that we don't\ndo it anymore it's that we split our\ntime between making the shorter videos\nand doing the in-depth more Deep dive\nkind of things the other thing that's\nchanged is that I do some of that stuff\nthe other slice of time that is now\nhard is that like I go places so like we\nwent to the I made like four or five\ntrips out to California this year for\nlike the streamy the\nAPA um you know like going out there for\nlike podcasts and things like that so\nwe're also doing some in depth in-depth\nstuff at other channels so that's where\nsome of it's going but basically like I\nused to be able to do in-depth content\n100% of the time and now I'm able to do\nin-depth content 30% of the time now you\ncan say Dr K I want you to do more\nin-depth content you should increase it\nto 50 or\n60% and that's totally fair but the\nmoment that we start moving in that\ndirection ction is the moment that we\nstop growing which is also okay I'm not\nsaying that we're we need to keep\ngrowing but that's also where we asked\nyou like should we continue to grow and\nif I had if I had if I had sort of not\ngone for growth then like I literally\nwouldn't be here right now I would have\njust stayed in my office and then you\nknow just seeing 30 people and I'm sure\nthat if you kind of think about it if\nyou're one of my patients and I stopped\nseeing you because now I'm doing\nHG you were getting a very watered down\nversion of what you used to get because\nyou used to get eight months with Dr k\nfor one hour a week and now it's like\nI'm doing 2our streams with like 2,000\npeople so like every step you lose depth\nand you gain bread part of the reason\nthat we were thinking about memberships\nis because I actually miss that stuff\nthat's my favorite stuff she's already\nsaid once that I've talked too much and\nI know she's thinking it\nagain and and so like I would love to do\nI'm I'm doing all kinds of like I'm\nlearning all kinds of cool stuff so like\nthat's where I I love the trauma\nWorkshop so the trauma Workshop was like\nlet's go for eight hours and really\nunderstand from start to finish what\ntrauma does to you and what to do about\nit okay but for like I think the short\nanswer is why has the content gotten\nmore click baity I hear your feedback\nbut I also see the\nanalytics and it just performs better\nand so for us to not have to make that\ntradeoff of\nYouTube performing better versus you\nguys getting because for those of you\nwho are asking for more in-depth stuff\nthe majority of you have been with us\nfor a long time so there are distinct\nkind of user Journeys if you will coming\nin one is new people coming in with the\nmore kind of bite-sized content and then\nthey kind of go on their path and\nthey're going down the library that you\nguys have already been through so\nthey're just further behind than you\nguys are the way you guys think and go\nabout your lives now is so different\nthan it was two or three years ago so\nthe solutions that we're putting out now\naren't really for you they're for people\nthat are new to the community so how do\nwe like I hate it when companies do that\nwhen all they care about is new\ncustomers and they forget about the\npeople that they already have like I\nhate it I hate it when gyms do it when\ncell phone companies do it like\npromotional offers for new customers\nonly I hate that crap so what do we\nbuild for people\nthat have been with us who have been\nsupporting\nus who have purchased from us who have\nyou know trusted us that's um where\nwe're kind of at right now can I can I\nso there's a a comment from Modest\ntriangle I feel like people who\nnegatively critique your new videos\nshould be grateful that you do it in the\nfirst place it's like free education I\nappreciate the\nsentiment and also like there's a part\nof me that completely agrees with you\nyou know there's people who are like\nokay like why aren't you making new\nvideos and there's a part of me that\nwonders like how many of our 400 or 600\nlong form videos have you watched have\nyou watched all of them because a lot of\npeople are really upset about the new\nvideos coming out but we have a library\nif yall want deeper content we have a\nwhole library of like two or three years\nof doing really deep content it's just a\nlot of content at the same time I mean\ntelling people to be grateful I think is\nnot useful like I think that that\nfeedback is still helpful to us right\nknowing where y'all are what you like\nwhat you don't like that's the backbone\nof what we do so I may have an initial\nemotional reaction of frustration it's\nlike how many we've made 800 free videos\nlike how many more do you want and\napparently it's like what some people\nwant is it's not that they want more\nfree videos it's that 800 free videos is\nnot what upsets them what upsets them is\nthat there are 20 not free videos and\nthat I think is like fair to feel that\nway right and and we also have to\nunderstand that some of these people are\ncoming like this person who com like\nthey're coming from countries where they\ncannot afford a single paid\nvideo and this is a topic that they\nreally could benefit from and like I\ndon't blame someone for being frustrated\nby that right that's completely\nreasonable if I were in their insues I'd\nfeel the same way too I really want to\nwatch this video but this guy is pay\nWalling it and I can't afford it and\nthat of course it's reasonable to be\nfrustrated by that I want to show youall\nsomething though about YouTube\nperformance because people are talking\nabout clickbait and why you're TI so\nnegative so here is a video that here is\na stream that I really really liked hold\non a second so this is just looking at\n[Music]\nour hold\non okay this was one of my favorite\nthings to do you're not crazy for being\nsick understanding psychosomatic illness\nthis this is one of my favorite lectures\nto prepare I talked about psychosomatic\nillness for 1 hour and 38 minutes and it\nhas 143,000 views compare that to why\ntherapy sucks for men has 1.4 million\nviews in his 17 minutes now the reason\nwe make this kind of content is I'm\ngoing to ask youall a question because I\ndo not know the\nanswer which one of these videos makes\nthe world a better\nplace I don't know I don't know whether\nhelping 143,000 people who suffer from\npsychosomatic illness in a deeper way is\nbetter than helping 1.4 million people\nunderstand the challenges in therapy for\nmen I don't know so what we try to do is\nall of it right and and the reason that\nwe sort of started this whole the\nmembership's thing is\nthat if I so I I I did a a corporate\nevent recently in San\nFrancisco and at uh I don't know if it\nwas was it publicized do people know or\nis that NDA okay so like I was invited\nto YouTube headquarters to give a talk\nright and this is like a paid engagement\nand so you know like YouTube like they\nthey pay\nwell um it was a super cool event I\nreally loved being there it was really\nfantastic but now I've got a choice so\nlike if I want to continue building\nstuff like this for free the money needs\nto come from somewhere so either I can\ndo paid engagements with YouTube which\nis cool like I'm really grateful for\nhonestly it was really fantastic but\nthen the problem is like if I don't do\nthat the money needs to come from\nsomewhere and so then what I was sort of\nthinking is like how can we make some\nmoney not sell our soul right this\nsecond but we'll I'm sure we'll sell our\nsoul at some point every person has\ntheir price and I'm human right so thus\nfar I've been able to\nresist sums of money large sums of money\nbut I mean some one day someone will ask\nwill offer me a pile of money that'll be\ntoo big and maybe I'll be able to resist\nmaybe I won't so far the numbers that\nI've resisted have been very very high\nso I believe in myself but I'm only\nhuman um and and\nso I want to do both and one way to do\nboth is to stop going to places that pay\nme a sizable pile of money to go and\ngive like a lecture or a workshop or\nsomething like that I would much\nrather spend one hour with a thousand of\ny'all than the same amount of\nmoney with like 20 people right who are\nlike Executives or whatever and and I'm\nnot saying we're not going to continue\nto do that and it's like the answer is\nlike we end up doing some blend of\neverything and then it's like kind of\nconfusing for yall so when it comes to\nYouTube other people are also sort of\nsaying like why are the the stuff so why\nis the stuff so negative and that's\nwhere it's like yeah sometimes things\nare positive and work really well like\ndiscipline is actually an emotion so\nwe're sort of thinking about this why\nchasing red flags leads to love I don't\nthink either of these are negative\num you know but like some of this stuff\nis negative like how to change your\npersonality I don't know if that's\nnegative but this is negative you need\nto stop being a simp that's negative and\nand and the reason that we do that is\nbecause if we sort of look at our\ncontent like what not engages people but\na lot of it is like I feel personally\nattacked that's what I'm shooting for\nbecause because it's it's the other\nreason that we make negative styling\nthumbnails is\nbecause that video is designed to fix a\nproblem so we've made videos that are\nlike emotions 101 and no one [ __ ]\nclicks it it can be the best content on\nthe universe but unless it's solving a\nproblem on the platform of YouTube you\nneed to use clickbait because you're\ncompeting against people who clickbait\nand as as lovely as y'all are you have\nthe same brain that everybody else has\nyou have a human brain and people on the\nYouTube platform have figured out how to\nexploit it and the other thing is like\nyou know we were doing a lot of\ninterviews and stuff and during the\npandemic um but we don't have we're not\nwe had nothing to do then right so we\nwere all watching content for hours and\nhours and now we're kind of back to work\nback to school we don't have that kind\nof time anymore to watch 2hour lectures\nI hear some of you guys saying well I\nlike it in the background for this or\nthat and there are probably about\nhundred interviews on the channel so I\nthink what we need to do a better job of\nis organizing playlists podcasts things\nlike that to help it just easier to find\nwhat you're looking for because the\nlibrary is really overwhelming but\nanyway let's move on this is supposed to\nbe a Q&A\nfriend no\nAMA I want to\nrant are we do we like or can we can we\nmove on yeah we can move on yeah\nplease why don't we just why don't we\nbreak the ice with like a fun question\nand move away from this for like just a\nsecond yeah do you all have mean anybody\nhave a random wild question general\nquestions playlist would be great\ngreat yeah so that's like another prime\nexample of like yeah it would be great\nbut well there there are\nplaylists they you got to click around\nto find them but they're they're up\nthere both are\nokay P Dr K really is talking too much\nsorry all got me started see that's good\nfeedback so oh you know speaking of\nRussia I'm really proud of kind of what\nwe did there um we had we had some\nRussian clients we had some Ukrainian\nclients and we we just subsidized their\ncoaching we kept them on the platform um\nof course you know the scheduling got a\nlittle volatile which makes total sense\ngiven the circumstances but we were able\nto\nsubsidize coaching on both sides um so\nwe're doing what we can but you guys\nhave to remember we're we're a Content\nchannel that has\ndifferent products and services for\nmental health But ultimately like we're\nsmall potatoes in the grand scheme of\nthings asking us to fix things like\ncurrency exchanges and like Global\nconflicts things like there's there's\nonly so much we can do we do everything\nwe can but please give us some Grace\nfor for not being able to tackle these\nlike ills of the world at scale yeah one\none thing I I just building on that for\na second so I I'm really grateful that\ny'all have given us a chance and that\ny'all continue to support us and for\nthose of youall that have been here for\na while you're more aware of our many\nmissteps and and because we're learning\nthis right so like the thing that I'm an\nexpert at is like arguably Psychiatry\nand arguably spirituality it's not\nstarting a digital mental health startup\nin that way gruy is awesome but she also\nlike you graduated what you HG was\nstarted when you were still in school I\nlove this comment you're the best\npotatoes sweet potatoes that's so cute\num thank you\nkiwi so you someone saying I watch a\ntwo-hour roast session of Dr K we did\nthat a couple years ago so it's like\nsitting on our YouTube\nchannel um and so someone else is saying\nDr K ranting is beautiful other people\nare saying Dr K is talking too much this\nis the problem right is that people want\ndifferent things and so the reason we\nkeep on building different [ __ ] is not\nfor each of you to do everything it's\nbecause different people want different\nthings we're trying to meet yall where\nyall are\nat um it is not currently possible to do\none-on-one therapy with hog sorry\nguys time\nconstraints uh\nyeah why do you only have one hour in\nbg3 because I'm doing\nthis um\nDr K book list so people have been\nasking that for years I I I don't have a\nlist I'm working on making one but I can\nmake a couple of\nrecommendations so uh I I'm finally\ngetting around to reading body keep\nkeeps the score by Bessel Vander kulk\nand I think it's like one of the best\nfive books I've ever read um it's just\nbeautifully crafted and I'm very\nfamiliar with Vander kul's like primary\nresearch like his his Publications so I\nknow a lot of it but it's just it's very\nbeautifully written\n[Music]\num what do I think about Alan\nWatts oh there's one\nabout how is it like to work together as\na married\ncouple I think this is a great question\nin like the Creator community in general\nwhere a lot of creators are kind of\nworking with partners and spouses at\nthis point I think it's good I think we\nkind of hired each\nother\num what do you think\nI love it so I I think it's challenging\nI I think that um honestly I I\nthink let me can I think for a second\nI've got something to say\nsure\nso some time ago people arrived at the\nconclusion that working with your spouse\nor family members or things like that is\na mistake don't mix business and\npleasure or or stuff like that and I\nthink that that is that is a\ngood general rule but I think the moment\nthat we all started believing that we\nactually atrophied or rusted in our\nability to successfully do that so we\nstopped practicing navigating these like\ncomplex relationships and I think in\ndoing so we actually lost something very\nvery important so one of the things that\nI'm really lucky with\nand I know very few people who have this\nis that we are able to have a work life\nbalance that is like a unit so I never\nhave to explain to my spouse and deal\nwith her frustration when I have to work\nlate she knows I have to work late she\nknows exactly why I have to work late I\nwouldn't be working late unless she\ngreen lit it and on the flip side I know\nexactly when my spouse needs to work too\nmuch and then like I kind of know right\nso as her husband I know that holy [ __ ]\nthis stuff is going on in the company\nright now and so she's been grinding I\nknow what's going on because like I'm a\npart of those meeting I'm not a part of\nthose meetings but I know what's going\non and so then I know that okay at home\nlike I'm going to have to cook I'm going\nto have to take care of this I'm going\nto have to take care of this because\nshe's working so one really cool thing\nis that there's a lot of frustration and\nconflict when so even when I was like\nyou know a full-time practicing\nphysician and I tell cruy like oh I'm on\ncall and she's like damn it you know\nlike why do you have to be on call like\nI wanted to go out this weekend and like\nthis stuff like that she's\nunderstandably frustrated to sleep this\nweekend more like yeah and and so the\ncool thing is like we don't it's also\npretty neat because I you know I don't\nhave to worry I mean hopefully I don't\nhave to worry about my CEO stabbing me\nin the back which can happen sometimes\nin companies right so you can get I\ndon't know if you guys were paying\nattention to what happened at open AI\nbut that seemed like you know some\ninteresting stuff for a second I'd like\nto think that we're resistant to that\nsort of thing on the flip side um you\nknow some of the people that we talk\nto uh someone who was an angel investor\nwho you know we as we've said we haven't\ntaken money anyway but they were kind of\nsaying I I never invest in husband and\nwife couples because if there's a\ndivorce or something happens in your\npersonal life like the company implodes\nso that that that's a you know I don't\nknow if that's true or not but it's it's\na con conern overall I think it's like\npretty good and I'm I'm grateful for it\nand she's she's a fantastic person to\nwork with I on the other\nhand you're\nyou're Alo is like the quintessential\nbrilliant solo contributor who is a\nchaotic manager but you kind of you kind\nof need his opinion on everything but\nhe's um I would not say management is\nhis strong suit confirmance reviews this\nyear are going to be\nfun there's\na\num so there's a question about members\nare able to drive future content my\nconcern is that f2p voices aren't given\nas much responded in chat okay which\nis\ncool but generally I think the sentiment\nis do memberships now kind of\nhijack content for everyone and I'm\nsaying that there's two different\nworkflows so membership content is\ncreated for members there's definitely\nbe ideas and inspiration from there that\nwill tease out against General audience\nbut General audience\num I think most of our ideation whether\nor not we're doing a good job is in\nanalytics but ideation comes from\ncomments um so I don't know if you guys\nknow this but we read a lot of what you\nguys write we read through the comments\nwe read through the\nreddits um sometimes yall hurt our\nfeelings and sometimes yall make our day\num but we read\nit oh yeah oh are you are you oh you're\ngonna say it of course no no so so uh I\nam a\nlurker in our in our stuff and I was\nvery upset to discover that\nsomeone someone probably a mod tagged my\nReddit account with the tag of Dr K on\nour subreddit but it was actually really\nfun when people didn't like I guess now\nthey know and I mean some people knew\nbut like it was fun to be able to\nparticipate on subreddit\nwithout people knowing who I am uh in\nother news about a year ago I got banned\nfrom our Discord this is a great story\nand um the reason I got banned is\nbecause I showed up and then the mods\nwere like bro you can't do that and I\nwas like why not and they're like it it\ncreates chaos and I was like okay fine\nso now now honestly our mods have so\nmuch power and they should I mean so so\nthey're they they get they get to yeah\nbut it's amazing how they're like no no\nno no no you don't come here so so I you\nknow I think it's like they're the\nexperts so I I do what they\nsay where and and the mods are all so\nfantastic I mean I I think where even\nthey had some concerns about some of the\nstuff that we're building so hopefully\nwe'll be sitting down with them soon and\nreally listening to them and for those\nof youall that are concerned about you\nknow the the voices of f2p that's\nsomething that's uh that's something\nwe're very aware of um and part of the\nreason we're doing the stream is like\nthis is a chance to communicate with\neverybody and the last thing is that one\nof the ways that we do it is that we\nwe're really happy about so when we\nlaunched\nmemberships it did not cut into our f2p\ncontent it's an additional thing what\nit's cutting into is basically like\ncorporate events so that's what we're\ntrying to replace and if we can replace\ncorporate events that fund and fuel our\nfree stuff with stuff directly from the\ncommunity and make content right like\nthat's a\nwin-win so that's what we're shooting\nfor and that that's why it's like and\nit's cool because we're going to do four\nfour things and it'll be in- depth and\nit'll be whatever youall want so I'm\nexcited about that shout out to gem oh\ngem is awesome\nyeah gem is great yeah ol has good\nsweaters right this is some of my my\nbetter work\nhere you know what's Rich they're saying\nwe're overthinking it I see that are we\noverthinking it I don't I I'm not\ngenerally an\noverthinker um\nI mean I I I I really appreciate the\nsentiment\nbut you know we we got in this to think\nabout you we were thinking for a second\nif you will yeah I I think it's like\nthat's what we're here for right so we\nthink about yall like that's my job to\nthink about yall and I think about what\ndo people need I I read comments I do\nall that kind of stuff can I interest\nyou in a\nmug\num\nyeah are antis psychotics healthy yeah\nI've seen that question many times the\nanswer is I think he should do a\nbreakdown on um like psychosis and antis\npsychotics and\nstuff I also think you should do some\nmore stuff on neurod\nDivergence\npersonally okay\ncan I\ntalk yes okay so let's let's talk about\nthis for a second so\nuh I would like to do more stuff on\nantis psychotics and schizophrenia so\nlet me explain to yall why I haven't\nyet so if we look at something like mood\ndisorders like depression or anxiety\nbetween 30 and\n50% of people have depression or anxiety\nat some point in their life schizophr\nand psychosis is about 1% so part of the\nreason that we haven't done more content\non psychosis is because it affects fewer\npeople now that doesn't mean that I\ndon't want to I actually so we did we've\ndone streams on psychosis so I I think\nmy two or three favorite streams one of\nthem is on psychosis I think we talked\nabout Brian Charley and all that kind of\nstuff it's like actually one of\nthe it's a lecture on psychosis that was\none of the formative moments that made\nme want to become a psychiatrist so\nthere was this just brilliant lecture\nthat was given by someone a guy named Dr\nCarlin and it was like so cool and I I\nfell in love with Psychiatry um and then\nwe're we're doing I'm I'm doing I I have\na video planned about neurode Divergence\nand software development o that sounds\ngood yeah so the but some of these\nthings like take time so just to give\nyouall\nuh I mean if it takes time that means it\ntakes\nmoney that's what I hear\nso ju just to give you all a\nsense you guys want to\nleak so you\nknow um making YouTube videos is hard so\nlike these are all of the videos I'm\nworking on right\nnow um these are the videos that we've\nactually\nfilmed and like each of these involves\nlike a fair amount of research and and\nstuff like that and we need to get\nbetter like someone pointed out to us is\nthis really your opening all right so\nwe're lazy [ __ ] am I right\nyes yes that is correct and so people\nask I mean okay so like let me just tell\nyou about this video okay so I'm a lazy\n[ __ ] and and like you know this when\npeople are saying like you make negative\ncontent and it's like what happens is I\nwake up on a particular day and I'm like\nwhy the [ __ ] am I like\nthis why am I just lazy and then I think\nto myself okay what am I going to do\nabout this and then I like think about\nall of the yoga training and all of the\nscience and I'm like let me stop being a\nlazy [ __ ] and then I was like you know\nwhat I'm going to teach other people how\nto stop being lazy [ __ ] but if we\nmake this video I I feel excited about\nit because this is really what the this\nis what the video is born from it's like\nI'm tired of being a lazy [ __ ] but the\nthe thumbnail is going to be\nnegative\nokay um so there also other things like\nI've been working on a deep dive into\nasexuality for a long time I don't quite\nknow what this is going to look like but\nfor everyone who is like okay I am\na-romantic\nasexual you know like am i ace am I not\nace like I'm not attracted to these\npeople like you know so so but the thing\nis it's complex like asexuality is hold\non a second here they're calling you a\none document Anarchist and they are\nright oh I I beg to differ I don't think\nso we're not going to let that slide no\nsir that's\nsilly okay look you guys think I'm a one\ndocument\nAnarchist I don't I don't think I this\nis November this is November December\n2023 this doesn't include all whatever\nthis random crap\nis or March April or like all this other\nstuff in January and whatever like this\nis not one document Anarchy if only my\nmy you know why I make multiple\ndocuments because one starts to get so\nunwieldy like once I cross like 20 or\n30,000 Words which by the way is like a\nthird of a book in terms of length the\naverage non-fiction book is about\n880,000 words once my gaming PC which\nnow agreed agreed is a little bit dated\nit's like four years old five years old\nsix years old once my gaming PC starts\nlagging when I open up word I know it's\ntime to make a new\ndocument so like I said all look in a\nbrilliant individual contributor but he\nis work with us\nmanager what' you got um I I just want\nto so\nlike people were asking\nabout just be careful about bumping this\nevery time bump shock waves that's\nbecause we need to get someone to build\nus a good setup this is beautiful but\nit's not fun like we have to keep on\npassing the microphone you'd think at\nthe size of content creators we are we'd\nhave a setup where you would have a real\nchair and then this microphone would be\nbetter so like this is a great\npaper I don't know if you guys can see\nthat oh yeah asexuality sexual\norientation parap Ilia sexual\ndysfunction or none of the above like I\ndon't know but that's going to be a\nvideo one\nday um and then the the rest of the\nbinder is all\nthat like we're looking at like you know\nArchives of sexual\nbehavior which is not nearly as\ntitillating as one would\nhope um so yeah we're we're we're\nworking we're working on stuff how\ntitillating do you want things scale 1\nto 10 um so we'd I'd like to\nokay how titillating do I want things so\nI know that people have been concerned\nabout how we have paid services but if\nyou really want to know how titillating\nI like things check out our only\nfans and then you'll see exactly how\ntitillated I enjoy getting oh God and\nthen we can do some AOE\ntitilation\ngreat\ngreat how do we feel about creating HG\ncontent in different languages I feel\nreally good about it but I don't know\nexactly how we would segment it out\nwithout it being um too complicated to\nkeep up with I think just having um\nclosed captions in different languages\nwould probably be the easiest\nbut I don't know man I'd really like to\nget this one language right and then be\nable to build it out I feel like we're\nstill not quite\nthere\num so one of the cool things was you\nknow we did a we did a sponsorship for\nBabel and so I started relearning\nSpanish and I had a conversation\nyesterday about do I need to relearn\nMandarin so because I I'm really\nthinking about we can translate stuff\nbut like wouldn't the content be better\nif I just knew the language but that\ntakes some time so uh\nWang\nright like we could do\nthat I learned Mandarin originally to\nread like ancient texts on taii and in\nChinese medicine how' that go really\nwell good it it was good only\n[Laughter]\nchance yall are\nfunny his Hindi might be the most\noffensive yeah people get really upset\nwhen I speak\nHindi is he promoting his only fans in\nmanding yeah I\nwish that'd be\nawesome all right do we go to a serious\nquestion or let's just Let's Just Vibe\nfor a bit I mean we're we're at we're at\nalmost two hours so okay well one hour\nwas you just monologuing so well I get I\nget to do some things as the as the what\nas the as the Creator as the pretty face\nas the talent is the talent oh my God\ncan I tell you Dr K is so hard to work\nwith his talent he's so high maintenance\noh my God he needs to have this thing in\nthis way I'm it's such a\ndiva um yeah we can we can just Vibe\nokay bg3 stream when maybe today if yall\nwant you guys want want to do bg3 stream\nwe have to go to zoo today I know but I\ncanceled my afternoon meetings or\nrescheduled\nthem once again to the frustration and\nand at the cost of the patience of\npeople that I work with who are super\nawesome wait I thought you wanted to use\nthat time for something else not to play\nvideo games\nI was going to use that time for work I\nonly said it was okay for you to cancel\nthose rooms because you wanted to do\nother stuff I was working I was G I\nneeded it to work busted and so I'm I'm\nworking right because Chad is ask asking\nme to play bg3 and part of my job is to\nplay video games on\nstream let me tell you what your job\nis uh no if you really want to it's fine\num so a great question thoughts on\ndyslexia so this is\nfascinating so all right y y'all got me\nexcited can I go\nokay okay so dyslexia I think is way\nmore\nimpactful than we think it is so\nrecently I've had a couple of uh patient\ninteractions that have really opened my\neyes to this so you know when we're in\nschool we have some people that have\nlearning disabilities or learning\ndifferences or what whatever the the\nterm is nowadays but we have some\npeople whose brains have difficulty\nprocessing the information in the way\nthat it's presented in school so the\ninability to read or\nwrite the really interesting thing is\nthat once people leave school and we\nkind of like get past it or we fix it we\nthink that we're done but I've seen a\nlot of actually disturbing data and it's\nanecdotal so it's not data so never mind\nthat word but I I've seen like a lot of\nstuff that I've started to realize I've\ntalked with a couple of psychotherapists\nthat dyslexia may actually impact things\nlike internal dialogue the ability to do\nthings like cognitively reframe and even\nthings like emotional awareness so if we\nlook at\ndyslexia it's a way bigger problem than\nwe give it credit for so it's just I mix\nup words when I read them right that's\nall we sort of say dyslexia is but if we\nreally look at it that means that\nthere's a part of our brain like the\nlanguage processing part of our brain\nthat is somehow impaired now if that\npart of our brain is impaired we don't\nknow that the written word being garbled\nis the only way in which it is that you\nhave a problem because if we sort of\nthink about it if a child is dyslexic we\ndo not assess them for whether they have\ndifficulty verbalizing their emotions we\ndo not assess their capacity to\ncognitively reframe like those aren't\nthings that we test but those could be\ndeficit that correlate with\ndyslexia so it's very possible that if\nyou have\ndyslexia there are many things that\nother people can do which you take for\ngranted which we never talk\nabout that are actually harder for you\nand make your life harder another really\ngood example of this is forming a\nnarrative to put things past\nyou so so if we look at like um there's\na really cool study that came out\nrecently that showed that the reason\nthat trauma is so hard to get past is\nbecause we literally do not move past it\nso the way the parts of the brain that\ntrauma lights up are the parts of our\nbrain that govern present experience\nthey don't actually actually activate\nmemory circuits in the brain so if we\nlook at like how do you get Trauma from\nbeing in the present to in the past and\nmove past it what you literally have to\ndo is develop a narrative use language\nand then it stops uh activating the\nfrontal parts of your brain and it\nstarts living in your memory centers and\nthat's when we heal from trauma and so\neven that process requires a certain\nlevel of verbal\nproficiency so it's very possible that\ndyslexia can do everything from make it\nharder for you to understand your\nemotions therefore harder for you to\ncommunicate therefore harder for you to\nsuccessfully participate in\nrelationships make it harder for you to\ncognitively reframe which reduces your\ncapacity for resilience and increases\nburnout and also maybe even get past\ntraumatic events like things like\nbreakups and stuff like that so we don't\nreally know but it's like there's a real\npossibility there that dyslexia can be\nquite\ndebilitating really cool\nquestion\num\ncan you do a trauma guide\nmaybe check back in a\nmonth or\ntwo this is like such a basic but like I\ndon't know why I didn't think about it\nbut your ideas list for videos I wonder\nif we can um just share that and get\nsome feedback on what people want to see\nfor second\nthird\nshould we leak this or\nno uh you can if you want to it's not\nthe worst\nthing this is sitting at 5,600 words\nright now that'll grow a lot over the\nnext couple of\nweeks you have a deadline friend I know\nI have six\ndays so you're gonna play some bg3 right\nI have six days to write 60,000 words I\ncan do it\nwe're fine we'll be good it's all up\nhere once again he's a brilliant\nindividual\ncontributor um let's go down\nhere does that have to do with brokas\narea un undoubtedly you said Bas but I\nthink it's\nbrokas oh man I always get chai Tai Chi\nand chai te confused how have I never\nhow have I oh my God my mind is just\nblown have you read Gabor Monte\nabsolutely I think uh in the realm of\nhungry ghosts is like I think mate is\nlike a bit long- winded for my taste but\nit's excellent like as a thinker he's\nawesome they were asking about Alan\nWatts\nearlier uh I think Alan Watts is great\nbut I think his system of meditation\nis not what I like so I I like the more\ntechnical Raji yog tantric Mantra\nharness energies of the universe\nactivate your chakras really specific\nkinds of meditations that do specific\nthings even cognitively so like this\nmeditation will train your mind to do\nthis and stuff like that Alan Watts\ndoesn't really do that so he's a very\nvery I I think skilled meditator in is\nfrom the Buddhist tradition or I would\nguess the ma Mahayana tradition just\nbased on his his\nteachings and when it comes to Buddhism\nlike I'm a bigger fan of\nvajana this YouTube Chat thing is so\ndumb how do I get out of this I I I\ndon't\nknow keep\nokay we're gonna go to the zoo later\nlike in a couple\nhours what's the book that had the\ngreatest impact on\nyou\num so a couple I I my the first one that\npops into my head is actually count of\nmonac\nChristo so count of monac Christo is\nreally what made me it was her\nrecommendation um it's my favorite book\nand\nit it made me really like I've always\nliked fiction but it made me really like\nfall in love with fiction and I think\nit's just such a beautifully written\nbook and like it's great in terms of\nnarrative and stuff like that I know\nthat I mean I I think a couple of other\nbooks that I think are really good from\na spirituality perspective so I do think\nthat uh yoga the Alpha and Omega by Osho\nis very\ngood um I like\nuh let me think what\nelse Kundalini Tantra by bear School of\nyoga is really\ngood\num vgan py of Tantra is really good you\njust read um a fantasy novel that you\nwere really into right oh yeah so other\nthings are um psychodynamic diagnostic\nmanual is brilliant but I don't know if\nthat's what y'all are looking for\nthere's a mon Cristo\nanime that doesn't surprise this this\none's good\nbut it's like it's like a toone but it's\nreally\ngood\num what else he's\n[Music]\ngood do self-help books really help yeah\nI think so I think if there was no\nutility to them\nthen I I I don't think that they would\nsell and the other thing is you know I\nwrote oh we didn't even talk about this\nso U one thing that is kind of confusing\nor was confusing for me is I wrote a\nbook about parenting so specifically\nlike helping kids who struggle with\ntechnology addiction and that also is\nkind of like a weird thing to do because\nyou know it's not a book for y'all a\nsmall slice of y'all because some of\nyall have kids but the reason I wrote\nthat book is I was really thinking about\nlike how do we fix this problem and I\ncan't help but think\nthat the one thing that would make this\ncommunity disappear in the sense that we\nwouldn't need to be here is good\nparenting and so when I was sort of\nthinking about if I died\ntomorrow what what would happen how\ncould I help if I'm if I If I Die\nTomorrow how can I help the most people\nand what the conclusion that I came to\nis if I can help parents protect their\nkids from technology then that's the\nbiggest impact I'll have on the world so\nthat's why that's the first book that I\nwrote I I think that if yall have kids\nit's a I think it's pretty good um if\ny'all don't have kids and you want to\nsupport us anyway by all means get it I\nstill do think that for those of youall\nthat are interested in like\ncommunication and\nrelationships a lot of our core\ncommunication skills even stuff that we\nteach our coaches is in that book so\nthat book is really about rep pairing a\nrelationship between parent and child so\nif yall are interested in that kind of\nstuff the setting is going to be\ndifferent right because we're talking\nabout technology addiction but it's\ngreat because we explained to parents\nhow technology affects their brain so it\ncould be useful for y'all too to\nunderstand why you were addicted because\nI explained my theory of video game\naddiction in the book\nso it's not y'all aren't the target\naudience to be completely honest but\nthere are pieces of information in there\nthat I think could be I learned that\nstuff by helping this community because\nI I taught I tried to teach parents how\nto talk to their\nkids and I think that some of that stuff\nis like basic I mean stuff that I do\nand you know will there be an audiobook\nyes he's narrating it I'm narrating it\ngood um but I've seen him obviously as a\nparent he's an incredible parent so as\nan\nexample one of our oldest kid um was\ngetting made fun of by our youngest kid\nand the two kids that they car pull with\nand she was feeling really left out and\nreally hurt and she asked at bedtime do\nyou see it do you see them being mean to\nme and that was a really proud moment\nfor you right Alo where you were like\nwow she's actually coming out of her own\nhead out of her own experience to see\nlike is it just me that thinks that\nthey're being mean to me or is this\nreally happening I think it's really\ncool\num it's a\nvery I mean even at our age right we\ndon't necessarily say like oh maybe it's\njust me we kind of think of our\nexperience as the truth and that's\nwhat's really happening and so for an\neight-year-old to kind of be\nlike is this happening or is it just me\nI thought was really cool\num yeah we're proud of her he's an\namazing\nparent time will tell\nyeah no I I got you don't worry I think\nI think dude the kids are op man like\nit's super\ncool I click pre-order and it doesn't go\nanywhere oh my God that's devastating\nclassic see this is the [ __ ] that if we\nhad a little bit more money we could\nprobably\nfix what a fail yall can go to any\nwebsite where you can get books and it\nshould be available\num it's on Audible if you want to just\nuse an audible credit like that helps us\num and you don't have\nto you know spend real\nmoney\num give the man a best ad mug do you\nwant to know something really cute\nbecause I've seen comments of like you\nknow you're my internet dad and stuff A\nlot of times when he's scripting he's\nsitting down with his like number one\ndad mug and he's like getting into dad\nmode a lot of times when he's um on his\none\ndocument for all of his video scripts\nbut he definitely goes dad\nmode yeah so the other thing that I\nthink a lot of people don't think about\nis for every one YouTube video that gets\nproduced or even for that matter for\nlike a deep dive that I do I make\nactually three videos and two of them\njust don't see the light to day because\nthey're not good enough um and so the\nthe content creation process for me has\nalso changed lot so a couple of other\nthings that have changed are that is\nthat as we do more and more topics we\nreach the barrier of my knowledge so the\nfirst two years I was streaming we like\nit was very easy to cover all the stuff\nthat I was already an expert in but as\nwe dive into things like autism spectrum\nor um I'm doing a ton of research also\nright now on menstrual cycles so I have\nkind of a hot take which kind of like\nblew my mind um when I kind of connected\nis that we think of our disease model as\nfixed so when we think of something like\nADHD we say you are diagnosed with\nADHD and that's it's ADHD but if we sort\nof think about the way that we\nunderstand disease we assume that the\nhuman being is the same all 30 days and\nso there's a ton of actually emerging\nresearch that ADHD\nworsens throughout different periods of\nthe menstrual cycle we know that there's\npmdd premenstrual dysphoric disorder so\nwe know that like there's also\npremenstrual syndrome and stuff like\nthat so we know there's fluctuations but\nI think it's actually like really Biz\nbizarre and it's actually a failure in\nthe field of medicine that we have not\nrecognized that probably each illness\nthat a woman experiences has\nfluctuations in its intensity and even\npathophysiology depending on the\nmenstrual cycle because we think ADHD is\nthe same on day one day 15 and day 30\nbut literally for half of the population\nit fluctuates\nand it's like it's crazy to think that\nwe have a model of medicine that does\nnot account for fluctuations in 50% of\npeople on the planet or 52% of people on\nthe planet um it it's kind of the\nopposite of psychotherapy where I think\nPsychotherapy since we saw historically\nso many women in Psychotherapy it's\nbiased towards women not in a\ndiscrimination way uh but like you know\nwhen 70% of your population benefits\nfrom a particular thing and you study\nyour population\nit's going to be pushed by that 70% so\nthis is why I think talk therapy has\nbecome the gold standard um and then on\nthe flip side though I think while it's\nhard I I don't think Psychotherapy is\ndesigned specifically with men in mind I\nI do think that the rest of\nmedicine is not designed with women in\nmind and there's there's actually a ton\nof scary emerging data about things like\npain control and stuff like that like\nreal horror stories about IUD insertion\num and people will say like yeah you're\ngoing to have some soreness but like IUD\ninsertion is like a surgical procedure\nthat can be crippling for some people so\nI'm studying all kinds of\nstuff um seeing some feedback about um\nmenstrual cycle and ADD ADHD\nspecifically I think that would be\nreally yeah that's what I'm digging into\nspecifically and um so we'll almost\ncertainly do a video about that but it\ngot me thinking as I was reading I I\nactually think that like I wonder if\nthere is\na menstrual fluctuation of any diagnosis\nincluding things like cholesterol heart\ndisease diabetes yeah we already know\nthat mood and anxiety are changed but\nwhat about things like\ntrauma um infection\nsusceptibility all kinds of\nstuff I'm just seeing some some kind of\nnewcomers hi my name is cruy it's kruti\nI'm Mrs K and also I run the business\nside of healthy gamer so we're just here\nchatting um taking some questions some\nfun and some serious as there's been I\nthink we've grown so much and I used to\nkind\nof pop in and out of stream so I felt\nlike I knew you guys and I haven't been\nhere in a while cuz we've been so busy\num so just popping in to say hi and take\nsome\nquestions you looking for an article uh\nno no I have articles okay my bad I'm\njust pulling them up yeah so like this\nis some really interesting stuff\nreproductive steroids and ADHD symptoms\nacross the men menstrual\ncycle\num right so relationship between sex\nhormones reproductive stages and ADHD a\nsystematic\nreview and then atten ition deficit\nhyperactivity disorder and the menstrual\ncycle Theory and evidence like these are\nall great papers if you guys want more\nif you want to read more on the topic\nbut I'm going through these and I'm\ngoing to prepare a\nlecture by the way we've seen some\nfeedback that you guys would like\nsources cited and we're figuring out a\nbetter workflow here's here's why it's\nhard because usually ol will have an\nidea he'll post it on our company slack\nour research manager um will pull what\nhe thinks is relevant and then all of\nformulate kind of looking at everything\nhe'll formulate kind of what he wants to\nsay a lot of times he's not pulling from\nany one paper a lot of times it's from\nacross the board sometimes it's one\npaper but I think where things break off\nis he doesn't close the loop and say\nokay I've written this out and here's\nthe edited down list of sources so we're\nwe're working on how to get better at\nthat but that's the the\ndisconnect um okay so a couple other\nquestions great questions someone asked\nabout borderline personality disorder\nthis is another one that I'm super proud\nof I think it's one of the best lectures\nI've done uh this it's a 30-minute\nlecture on BPD and then there's a 35\nminute lecture on how to date someone\nwith BPD I think they're both top-notch\nand YouTube I think agrees those are\nsome of our better performing videos and\nthis is that's my\nface over there that's good and then\nsomeone asked about astrology so man\nokay so like I I think that\nuh so I I'm I'm already so one of the\nthings about\nfeedback so I I get that there's an\nappetite for more in-depth\nstuff um so I I think I think we're\ngoing to do like more deep Dives in 2024\nso more like\nsingle we're going to do more deep Dives\nand I'll do one on astrology if yall\nwant I have I have many thoughts about\nastrology um I think at the top of the\nlist is I think the way that we're\nstudying astrology is wrong so everyone\nsays there's no scientific evidence of\nastrology that's because I don't think\nthe trials have been designed right uh\noh so here's what I would like to do so\nI think one of the trials that we need\nto do for astrology I've tried to do\nthis one a couple of times but just\nhaven't been able to get together the\npeople what we need to do is have a\ncompetent astrologer draw up a set of\nbirth charts and then what we need to do\nis have those birth charts anonymized\nand then we need to see if people can\npick out their own birth chart so if we\nhave 10 birth charts and 10 people what\nis the likelihood that you will be able\nto pick out your birth chart now there\nis a random chance of one person for 10\nthings that's 10% right the actual\nstatistics are a little bit more\ncomplicated than that but I suspect that\nif you get a competent astrologer that\nyou will get a better than 10% hit rate\nbecause I think there's something\nlegitimate to\nastrology the problem is that astrology\nhas\nbecome so\nunscientific that all the scientists\nleft and so a lot of astrology has\nbecome like BS that is not rigorously\ndone or even trained right so you kind\nof think about we have like\nschools where we have very excellent\nteachers who are like teaching this\nstuff whereas astrology is like I'm\nlearning random crap from the\nastrological equivalent of WebMD so I\nthink as as a\nfield the academic rigor in the field of\nastrology is it like a one out of 10 so\nI think that's another reason why\nastrology is\nnot well anybody well\nregarded be an astrologist right just\nyeah so so I I I think if we actually\nstart studying it and and I know that so\nI was talking to my grandmother the\nother day who was telling me about my\ndad's birth chart and like like it's\ncrazy but like she was saying like you\nknow all the stuff was predicted and\nlike really weird stuff um I've had two\nastrologers so i' I've seen probably\nabout 10 astrologers over the course of\nmy life two or three of them I think are\nthe real deal like scary level of\npredictive accuracy so I think a lot of\nastrology uses some of these cognitive\nbiases like the availability bias and\nsome amount of vagueness and there's\nlike you will have a challenge at some\npoint in your future and that just\ngeneral statements that apply to anyone\nbut you know one astrologer told me that\nmy my good career like the right career\nfor me was funeral home\nmanagement and like that's the I mean so\nthat prediction was\nwrong and\nthen and I still remember the\nconversation I was like what what and so\nsome astrologers out there will be very\nspecific so he was like yeah like you\nshould do funeral management I like what\nthe [ __ ] and so I was like help me\nunderstand how you get that and he's\nlike well based on your birth chart you\nwould do really well with professions\ninvolving\niron and then I was like does surgery\ncount and he's like no he's like\nmedicine isn't for\nyou I was\nlike\nokay but I mean like I give the guy\ncredit for not saying like oh do\nsomething that helps people you know\nit's like such a specific\nthing and and so the interesting thing\nis that I mean that's one where arguably\nhe's right like I I don't know like\nmaybe we'll shut down this whole HG\nthing and funeral homes by HG with iron\ncaskets um and who knows right maybe I'm\nnot living up to my full\npotential glad you didn't listen to him\nthat's just because you're\nalive but I mean it's it's fun stuff\nlike I think astrology is very\nintellectually engaging\nI just wouldn't go planning your life\naround\nit by the way we're a really good match\nin terms of astrological birth\nchart we're like\nOptimal we got too high of a score right\nnope we didn't get too high of a score\nso you can get too high of a score which\nmeans like if you get like 30 I think\nit's out of 36 if you get 32 plus that\nmeans that you're too similar and that\nyou'll have a bad marriage but I think\nwe're in the high high 20s which is like\nideal L 30s I think no I think we're\nlike\n29 okay well we'll take a look okay Dr K\nbeing like this isn't even my final form\nyeah wait till we start we're going to\nopen a funeral home we're going to buy a\nrench I'd do it chat I really would if\nyou guys give me the license and I can\nfind some money I'd do it let's see what\nhappens here's an interesting question\ndoes DOA influence\ndating uh yeah of\ncourse right so DOA involves in involves\nuh temperament and personality and so\nthat's something that becomes a problem\nor I mean you just have to understand it\nso we're very dally\naware so she's she like when I move my\nhand you know how she mocks me for\nmoving too much that's because I'm a\nVata and she's a kafa so we kind of\nunderstand\nthis and then you know I have the\nangular nose and she has like the round\nknows\nyeah I get mad easily he\ndoesn't I do sometimes though but less\neasily than I used to right and I get\nmad more easily that's because of\ncaffeine intake and lack of sleep um HG\nfunerals POG I don't think\nso I think we can call a lot of things\nthat we do POG funerals doesn't seem\nright on a scale of 1 to 10 how often do\nyou adhere to your own\nadvice I'd say like oo good\nquestion I'd say somewhere around a\nseven to an eight but if you really pay\nattention I don't give much\nadvice is that the loophole yeah I I I\ndon't think advice is very\nhelpful so so in terms of living\naccording to what I teach I'd say it's\nlike a seven or an eight and like if I\nwasn't then you\nknow I mean it helps a lot\nlike it helps a lot to understand the\nnature of happiness and like literally\nlike understand how to be happy and it's\nlike a process that you can do and so it\nhelps me be happy on a day-to-day basis\na good example of that is is even with\nlike all this feedback right so some\npeople were like oh like people should\nbe\ngrateful and like take a step back from\nthat St take a step back from my own ego\nand it's like a people are saying\nsomething what's their intention I don't\nthink their intention is to make me feel\nbad if they're critical their intention\nis that they see the work that we're\ndoing they think that something that\nwe're doing is not aligned with that\nwork and they're sharing their opinion I\nthink they're coming from a place of\npositivity and so that's just a really\nsimple example of just how you reframe\nlike what happens up here is very\nimportant teach us teach us more that's\nthe plan until I'm dad or can't do it\nanymore um seeing that studies show that\nADHD individuals have higher risks of\ndepression and drug abuse wouldn't\nmedication be a better solution than\nthat seeing the world does not cater to\nthose with ADHD it's a great question\nand it's i' refer you to three uh\nYouTube videos that we've done or four\nthings three things that that are free\nand one thing that's paid so we had a\nconversation with Destiny about ADHD\nmedication where we explain a lot of the\nstuff that one's really good we have a\nYouTube video about how ADHD leads to\ndepression that one's really good uh\nthere's there was another YouTube video\nabout ADHD that covers this maybe we've\ngot some stuff about ADHD medication\nsomewhere else in there um and then the\nlast thing is we have a guide to ADHD\nwhere we talk about this in depth and\nI'm really happy that just from an\ninternal Compass standpoint that if\nsomeone has a question I can say we've\ngot somewhere around three hour a\nminimum of 3 hours of stuff that you can\nwatch for free and if you want 10 hours\nthen you can pay 25\nbucks but I I think it's like you can\nget a lot of value out of that three\nhours oh Eating Disorders again I know\nyou have some some stuff around male\nbody\ndysmorphia yeah so Eating\nDisorders yeah we could we could do\nsomething about that\nyeah yeah so Katy scape is saying the\nguide to ADHD in doing stuff is amazing\ngood that's why we made\nit any major fears about the outcome of\nHG yeah take your\npick everything from we crash and burn\nto we lose\nourselves\nto I I don't know like some government\nget 20 years from now you're still\nmaking YouTube videos and you're like\njust let me out of here I mean there's\nall kinds of fears right so like like so\nI don't know if yall pay are following\nwhat's happening with like twitch in\nKorea and this is another reason why we\ndo things the way that we do them people\nare like why don't you just do more\nstuff on YouTube or stream on Twitch or\nwhatever and part of the reason that we\nhave we have a diversity of stuff is\nbecause if you're a twitch streamer in\nKorea right now you're\nscrewed right so like the problem with a\nlot of these like General ideas of why\ndon't you just do this like why don't\nyou just make stuff on YouTube or\nwhatever is like then like if something\nhappens with YouTube then we're screwed\nthere's basically because because we've\nchosen right we've chosen we don't want\nto just be a self-help Channel we want\nto make resources so now we're in kind\nof two industries at the same time we're\nwatching mental health and the way\nmental health is regulated what's how\npeer coaching is becoming more part of\nthe conversation we're\nwatching um I don't know the way\ninsurance reimburses and doesn't and how\nlike basically what's going on in\nhealthcare and mental health we're also\nwatching what's going on in content and\nthe Creator economy and just kind of the\nplatform Wars technology in general and\nso to be at the intersection of that is\na lot of volatility a lot of changes a\nlot of like one decision changes\neverything for like the ripple effect is\nso big so that's that's where I think a\nlot of\nthe careful planning the risk hedging\nthe kind of that's important but it's\nalso really important for us to have a\nNorth star which is again this community\num because we've made conscious\ndecisions we don't want to take on\ninvestors because then we're beholden to\nprofit lines we don't want to become a\nnonprofit because then we're beholden to\nconstantly fundraising we don't want\nto I guess back away from the intensity\nand like the scrutiny and\nthe you know building a healthc care\ncompany is very expensive that's where\npeople raise like $10 million seed\nrounds you know it takes a lot to be\nable to keep up with all of the regul at\nenvironment so we wanted to stay\nsubclinical and\nnot I guess take on challenges that were\nkind of too big for our scope but we're\nwanting to expand\num as much as we can to help as much as\nwe can so that's where the Institute\ncomes into play that's where these\ndifferent coaching iterations come into\nplay memberships more modules workshops\nEtc that's kind of the root of it\nall is just to be able to have I think a\nreally strong North Star when there's so\nmuch change happening on both sides of\num these two\nindustries we are not a b\nCorp the reason you would file as a b\nCorp it would be to essentially be able\nto take on investors and not have the\nfiduciary responsibility of profit and\nreturns but that doesn't we're not\nreally looking for investors\nI don't know something about B Corp just\ndoesn't feel right like it feels overly\ncomplex for what we're trying to do okay\nso can I yeah I love a lot of these\nquestions this is super cool so I think\nthank you all very much so one thing\nthat I actually want to uh Express\ngratitude for is our community is\nawesome so one thing that I think is\nawesome awesome awesome awesome awesome\nis that we have so many people who ask\nquestions and we have so many people who\nanswer them so like that's awesome that\nyall know so much everything from what's\ngoing on in Korea to even people like\nposting about hey this happened with my\npsychiatrist what should I do and like I\nread the comments and I think to myself\noh like I should answer this question\nand I read the comments and someone has\ngiven an answer that honestly is better\nthan the answer that I could get so\nthat's epic strong work everybody\num next thing that there's three or four\nquestions\num that I wanted to get to so people are\ntalking talk about Crash and Burn is\nrelative at this stage there surely is a\nlarge impact to the digital community at\nlarge already absolutely so let's\nunderstand something Crash and Burn\nmeans that we disappear in some way and\nthat could happen tomorrow who knows\nright so like maybe some the federal\ngovernment decides that medical doctors\ncan no longer create content on the\ninternet like who knows what kind of\nlegislation could happen right people\nhave talked about banning Tik Tok in the\nUS and so whatever like we don't know\nwhat's going to happen with the\nintersection of content creation and\nbeing Medical Professional because we're\none of the few medical we're one of the\nfew professions that has like an ongoing\nlure process where there's like\nadditional stuff that's attached so if\nthat happens tomorrow I don't know what\ncould happen we could crash and\nburn but you're right that we made a big\nimpact so one thing that I also want to\nsay is like whatever happens tomorrow\nand whatever people are happy with or\nunhappy with today the one thing that I\nfeel really good about is I started this\nto help for one really simple reason I\nthought that if I spent my whole year\ncareer as a psychiatrist working in my\noffice I would be able to reach let's\nsay 30 people a year\nfor 30 years so I'd be able to help\nabout a thousand patients and so my goal\nwhen I started at HG was to be able to\nhelp at least a thousand in one people\nthere needs to be a net benefit beyond\nwhat I can do as a clinician and I I\nhonestly feel that confident to say that\nwe probably helped at least a million\npeople so we get about 5 million\nVI views or unique viewers on YouTube\nuniques y so we we get about 5 million\nmaybe closer to six now unique people CL\nbetween four and five between four and\nfive okay so four million five million\nyou know unique viewers on YouTube right\nthat doesn't count on other platforms\nthere's a lot of overlap and so I I I\nthink it's safe to say that if there's\nfour million unique people every month\nthat somewhere in there we've crossed\nthe 1 million Mark in terms of like\npeople that actually gain some benefit\nso already there's an there's in my book\nit's been an overwhelming success\nirrespective of the money stuff\nirrespective of where we're going to go\nup until this point we've helped a ton\nof people which is what we set out to do\nso it's already a success everything\nBeyond this is in a sense gravy but in\nthe other sense there's an\nacknowledgement that even though we've\nhelped a bunch of people is it\nenough and the problem is no it's not\nenough\nright we haven't turned the\ntide on the direction that our mental\nhealth is going there's a deterioration\nacross the world and so I'm happy to\nhang up my hat once someone else fixes\nthe problem right now the problem is\nthat I don't see anyone doing what we're\ntrying to do better than we are so that\nmeans we have to do\nit\nany last questions\nguys so someone saying fundraising in\nvenmo so so look I think this is this is\none thing that you know sometimes we'll\ndo some kind of fundraising but you know\nour commitment is that if we're if yall\nwant to support us there are a couple\nthings you can do the first thing that\nyou can do is you can get better like\nthat's what we're here for like so the\nthe most basic thing that we're asking\nyou to do is get better understand\nyourself better become healthier become\nhappier that's like literally what the\njob is so if you do that and this is why\nmost of our content is free it's because\nlike that's our goal now if you want to\nsupport\nus you can support us by giving us money\nin any number of ways right pre-order\nthe book that's probably the thing that\nmaybe will support us the most right now\nor do something like just sign up for\nmemberships or buy the guide or give\ncoaching a shot the the one thing that\nthat I feel really good about internally\nand maybe I'm wrong and if I am y'all\nlet me know is that when we ask y'all\nfor money we want to give you something\nworthwhile in return right so that's why\nI mean if you guys have been paying\nattention to comments people have like\nwe're we're not asking hey did y'all\nlike the guides people are saying hey\nthe guide was great hey the guide was\ngreat the meditation guide is also great\nthat's why we build this stuff so if you\nwant to help us just get something that\nwe're offering you and pay for it don't\ngive us something for free get something\nin return we we we don't if yall just do\nthat that'll be enough right because I\nwe walked through all the stuff all the\nfinances and things like that and the\nconsiderations and things like that and\nthe reason that we come up with these\nproducts at the price points that we\ncome up with is first of all 50 bucks a\nweek is too expensive for a lot of\npeople out there totally get you $25 is\na onetime price is something that a lot\nof people can afford but some people\ncan't so 10 bucks a month is something\nthat a lot it's even a lower price point\nright so it's like more accessible and\nand you get four lectures a week Q&A\nevery week and then even an additional\nQ&A stream where we're going to answer\nyour\nquestions and there was a you know\nquestion about what about leaving f2p\npeople behind so here's the reason we're\nnot leaving f2p people behind because\nwe're not cutting into any f2p stuff\nwe're going to continue offering all the\nfree stuff and continuing to grow the\nfree stuff the money the the the money\nthat we ask for funds the free stuff and\nso for each of you who's taken a a shot\nat coaching that money went to build the\nInstitute which is now being used to\neducate therapists so that then three\nyears from now when some kid who's 19\nwalks into the therapist's office they\nare going to know more about technology\naddiction they're going to know about\nsocial media induced body dysmorphia and\nthey will be able to help that person\nmore\num I saw a question about how do you\nknow when it's time to change your\ntherapist um I'll give you my experience\nso I was seeing a therapist for a little\nwhile um after I had our first\nbaby and there was just so many\ntransitions going on Al was working a\nton um and I had I felt like I had spent\nfour or five weeks just explaining my\nlife and we weren't getting anywhere and\nI wasn't sure if we were ever going to\nget anywhere because also at that time\nwhen you have like a new baby that time\ncommitment of like one hour a week is\nit's quite a commitment\nso the questions I asked that helped me\nunderstand okay this isn't really going\nto work was just saying like hey do you\nhave a sense of what's going on or What\na Way Forward looks like and her answer\nwasn't super\nsatisfactory another thing that helped\nme was talking to other therapists of\nsaying like hey here's my situation and\nthem being able to say okay this is\npretty straightforward here's what I do\nwith other patients like you and they\ncould kind of give me a sense of what\nour time together would look like and I\ndon't think it's necessarily um you know\njust because you set a plan knowing 20\nminutes about a person doesn't\nnecessarily mean you're going to stick\nto that but I wasn't interested in a\nNeverEnding conversation about my life I\nwas looking to like deal with something\nmove on and my therapist wasn't so\nthat's kind of how I knew that it was\ntime to move on and I I basically said\nhey I think I can give this like two or\nthree more weeks before I have to make a\ndecision on whether or not this is doing\nanything for\nme um so I was pretty straightforward\nwith my therapist which was hard for me\nat the time\num but it helped quite a lot that's just\nmy story I don't all probably has a more\nacademic answer but as someone who has\nbeen there that's what helped\nme I was responding to people in chat\nokay cool will you do more content about\nautism\nabsolutely I I love dude autism is\nfascinating I think just neuro\ndivergency in general is fascinating so\nlike I said a couple times I'm working\non a video about or lecture on autism\nand and software development and so\nthere's some stereotypes what's the\ntruth of it is it actually advantageous\nin some ways it's really\nfascinating\num oh this is a good question mads mads\nman I would love to see y obtain more\nBadges of legitimacy so to speak APA and\ntalking to search in general are amazing\nsteps do you do you all consider\ncollaborative projects with\ngovernments um what's really interesting\nis the US government\nis you you know that's our home\ngovernment and we're not seeing a lot\nthere we are seeing interest from\nschools from cities I think like\nsomebody from the City of Corpus\nChristie Texas reached out which was\npretty cool um we've seen interest\nfrom the government of Australia by the\nway I don't know if you know this but\nAustralia has like a voucher program\nwhere you can use like tax-free money or\nsomething for mental health services\nwhich is like super cool and they\ninclude things like um mental health\neducation books courses things like that\nso if you're Australian definitely look\ninto that um a lot of interest from the\nMiddle East which seems to be um really\nprogress aggressive when it comes to\nmental\nhealth at least\nin what we do I guess I don't want to\nmake a blanket statement but we've seen\na lot of interest froms some Middle\nEastern governments\num but yeah we we really want to work\nthere I think there are a couple of\nresearch projects in the works and um\ngetting some accreditations for The\nInstitute has been I think more\nlegitimacy badges so were accredited by\nnaak which is I'm going to get this\nwrong but some of those a stand for\naddiction the national National\nAssociation for addiction counselors or\nsomething like that yeah so from naak\nfrom the American Psychological\nAssociation and I think a provisional\nfrom the American um social workers\nboard so I hear you loud and clear I\nthink we do need more legitimacy we do\nwant to work at that kind of more macro\nlevel um and we're taking a lot of Step\nsteps to get there yeah I mean so like I\nthink I think a big part of this is that\nHG is way more than what yall see like\nwe we have a there's a whole operation\nin which we have calls with health\nsystems that have 130 hospitals and\nmedical centers like in various parts of\ncertain countries and we speak with\ngovernments um we've done work we the\nmost bizarre thing is is\nuh being\ncollaborating with the United Nations\ncounterterrorism\nunit and and so we'll we'll we'll do\nthis kind of stuff like all the time and\nthat stuff takes time right so the other\nthing to also remember is like the UN\ndoesn't pay me when we do that like we\ndon't get any money for that we do it to\nmake the world a better place and and so\nthere's a lot of governments that we're\nwe're talking to and and places that\nwe're going in in different countries\nwhere we also don't publicize a lot of\nthat because I think that see our\nmission is to try to help help people\nwith their mental\nhealth and we tend\nto be open to supporting people who want\nto do something with that and I think\npart of the challenge that we face is\nthat some of the people that we\napproached by have a political ideology\nthat at least in the West can can be\nconsidered quite extreme and so we're\nalso like trying to navigate what to do\nabout that right so let's say that pick\nyour favorite politician who you think\nis an evil person\nimagine a scenario in which that person\napproached HG and said hey will you help\nus with mental health in my\ncountry and what do you think we should\ndo in that situation like I don't know\nwhat the right answer\nis so and there's a lot of stuff that\nwe're dealing with on that side right\nbecause that that's part of the mission\nbut that has is so far away from y'all\nwhich is fine like I I don't know what's\ngoing to happen in terms of Crash and\nBurn we could run a foul of some foreign\ngovernment and I'm in that country and\nmaybe I disappear and I never come back\nlike that's honestly something I've\nconsidered um it's not\na it it's a\npossibility\num yeah so someone's asking about India\nabsolutely so I don't know if youall\nknow this but like India has a quite a\nprofound Mental Health crisis as well\nand one of the things I was super\nsurprised by is who in India is willing\nto admit it because people that I was\nvery surprised about um I would was\nexpecting people based on my assumptions\nabout political beliefs that they would\nbe like oh you know this is not a\nproblem but especially\nsuicide\nin people Millennials and younger is\nlike real problem in India something has\nhappened in the system of Education I'm\nnot trying to criticize India every\nevery country has a evolution of\nwhatever and it's happened all over the\nworld and I don't think India is immune\nand so a lot of a lot of people are just\nstruggling over there like this whole\nsystem of like education where you know\nyou go to school and then you spend like\nsix hours a day at like a coaching\nschool or something like that doing your\ntutoring and whatnot like it's brutal\nand people don't and they work really\nreally hard for like 16 hours a day\nstarting at the age of like\n11 and then at the age of 18 they get\nsome test or 16 or something like that\nthe test score is not as high as\neveryone else who's grinding just as\nhard as you are or even harder and then\nlike your family is\ndisappointed you know there's no chance\nof recovery because I mean the US is\nnice in that way where I could fail out\nof college and like there's a path for\nme to still wind up at Harvard I think\nthat's way hard harder in India yeah so\nonce you kind of like once you have one\nsetback in India it's very hard to\nrecover is my understanding and if\npeople are from India and that's\nincorrect please educate me um but\nabsolutely so the other thing to\nunderstand is that H is international\nlike we've had clients in 121 countries\nat this point that's what we set out to\ndo so like in 17 territories 17 yeah\nright it's\nreally very cool it's such a privilege\nit is a lot of work and it takes a lot\nof infrastructure to\nsupport\nall of the\ndifferent people and places that we're\nin yeah okay y'all well thank youall\nvery much for coming today I I I like\nthat we've gotten to the point where\npeople have not quite asking so many\nquestions which is cool\nuh are we all happy is anybody still\nmad um we'll probably find out on Reddit\nyeah no I and I I I think it's I I\nthink how can I say this I think at the\nat the end of the day please just know\nthat we're trying to do the best we can\nand we're trying to do it for all the\nright reasons and the way we get\nthere there's not a single right answer\nright because if you look\nat any of the big mental health\ncompanies right now they're laying\npeople off or they've they're in trouble\nbecause of privacy laws they're like\neverybody is trying to figure this out\nif we had figured it out we wouldn't be\nin a mental health crisis so we're all\njust trying to\napply what we know how to do and the\nthing that we know how to do better than\nanyone else is how to connect with this\ncommunity online and build subclinical\nresources so we're not going to be the\npeople to come to for therapy but we're\ngoing to be the people people that are\ngoing to produce the best educational\nexperiences the best community\nexperiences the best coaching\nexperiences kind of anywhere on the\ninternet we're really proud of that one\nlast passion project that I want to tell\nyou all about oh my God between the\nranch in your astrology research and\nlike all of your other wild ideas last\none please so someone was asking can\ncruy narrate the book I would love to\nwrite a book one day about the story of\nHG and what I've learned about it and\nhave her write the same book but from\nher perspective and it's gonna be like\ngonna it'll be like an annotated Journal\nI'll just C cross this out because it's\nlike it's so interesting like I have all\nthese ideas and perspectives and it's\nlike her life is completely different\nand what she deals with on a day to-day\nbasis is completely different it's like\ntwo hour phone calls with the IRS over\nhere and\nthen what a great way to start the day\nyeah everything's okay thankfully\nbecause she's such a\nChad such a\nStacy um but yeah so thank you all very\nmuch honestly like thank you very much\nfor being here thank you very much for\ncoming um thank you very much for giving\nus the time a day and even you know gruy\nwas asking or is any anybody still mad\nand like you're allowed to be right\nthat's okay and and if you are like let\nus know the only thing that we ask is\nthat you be constructive in your\ncriticism as much as you can because I'm\nI'm I have a human brain just like\neveryone else we're we're actually like\nyou're talking to us yeah we're reading\nit yeah and and so even this stream was\nlike I've already streamed 3 days today\nin addition to whatever content work\nthat I do and other things I was like on\na podcast and things like that um but we\ndecided to do this because I think it\nwas overdue and I think that at some\npoint what started happening is we used\nto be a lot more open with our\ndiscussions about what we were thinking\nabout and then we in a sense we stopped\ndoing that\nbecause like the reason that gruy is\nlike face ping when I talk about what I\nwant to do is it ends up creating a\nexpectations and then it ends up\ncreating\ndisappointment and so what I realized is\nthat when I say something people think\nit's going to happen even if I say this\nmay not happen and this is something\nthat every content creator we've had 500\ncreators in our content creator coaching\nprogram and all of them do this because\nthe problem on the Internet is like you\ncan I've been speaking we've been here\nfor two hours and 42\nminutes and the problem is that a small\nslice of this can the whole conversation\nso what creators end up doing over time\nis speaking less and less because what\nsomeone will hear even over the course\nof this 2 hour and 42-minute\nconversation people are going in and out\nthe Nuance is very easy to miss in a\nsociety that has 30 second clips that\nget\nuploaded so Tori e put it\nsuper succinctly I missed it what are we\nmad about and it's just like case in\npoint right\nbeautiful\nit really hits the nail on the head\nright thanks guys really appreciate it\ngood to see you I'll try to drop in more\noften because this is this is fun for me\nthis this is not fun for you it's okay\nyou're gonna have to take one I know\nyeah take one for the team that's right\nokay thank you all very much have a good\nweekend bye do you still stream on\nTwitch\nabsolutely uh I think we're going to\nstart so this was we were talking a\nlittle bit about YouTube memberships\ntoday so this is that's why we're\nstreaming on YouTube I think technically\nwe' stream on Twitch and and talk about\nYouTube memberships but I think that's a\nbad for I think you can't okay okay well\nthat's good to know this is why you have\na team yeah um but we're planning on I\nthink actually dual streaming more\nespecially for some of these"
