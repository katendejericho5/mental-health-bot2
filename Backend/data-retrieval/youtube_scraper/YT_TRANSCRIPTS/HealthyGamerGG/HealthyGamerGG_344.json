    "transcript": "once we have an identity of I don't have\na lot of value as a human being now what\nhappens is we become dependent on the\nresponses of others to pump ourselves up\nso on a weekend if I spend 3 hours doing\nsomething for myself versus spend 3\nhours picking up someone up for the\nairport and then that that friend from\nthe airport which by the way they never\ngive me a ride which is okay right\nbecause I'm okay making sacrifices\nthat's worth more and our friend says\nhey thanks so much for giving me a ride\ntoday you really helped out you were\nlike oh my God that feels so good oh my\nGod so good oh my God give it to me tell\nme I'm worth something I need it from\nyou because I can't get it from myself\nand then when they don't reciprocate we\nfeel bad and what do we do to counter\nthat feeling of Badness we construct\nthis identity of like I'm going to\nsacrifice and that's what makes it okay\nso when other people walk all over me\nI'm going to cognitively reframe that as\nsacrifice and then I'm going to feel\ngood about myself and then think about\nwhat you've done you've created a\ndynamic where for you to feel better\nabout yourself someone has to take\nadvantage of you"
