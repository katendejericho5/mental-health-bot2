    "video_title": "Why People Who Have ADHD Burnout So Often",
    "transcript": "burnout usually comes from trying really\nhard and not seeing a result right so\nI'm going to kind of focus on this which\nis very common for people with ADHD so\nwhat happens when you've got ADHD is you\nhave a world that is designed for brains\nthat are not yours and so what you have\nto do is try extra hard or develop\nadaptations that are more costly right\nso other people can move through life\nrelatively easier but everything causes\na lot of friction for you it's hard to\nmake friends even like socializing\nbecomes something that you have to spend\na lot of effort in because you know you\nshouldn't be interrupting people you\nshould be paying attention you just\nintroduced yourself and you forgot what\nthis person's name is and so if you you\nlook at sort of the experience of people\nwith ADHD they're very burnout prone\nbecause they expend a lot of effort and\nit requires twice as much effort to get\nwhat a neurotypical person may get"
