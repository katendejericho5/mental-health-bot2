    "transcript": "the root of the problem is emotions\nwhich means if you want to quit\npornography due to feeling desperate\nyou're doomed to fail because that\ndesperation is what fuels the\npornography I'm feeling so lost I'm\nfeeling so helpless that's when your\nbrain is going to reach for the\n[Music]\npornography how do I stop watching\npornography permanently I'm 17 I live in\nIndia and I'm preparing for an\nengineering entrance exam to my dream of\nbecoming an astronaut there are 4 months\nleft and I had really R ruined my\npreparation by procrastinating in\naddictions such as video games\npornography Etc I did get rid of my\nvideo game addiction but pornography I\njust can't seem to stop watching it I've\ntried the easy peasy method which I\nbelieve is the best possible method to\nquit pornography but I've have been\nunsuccessful I want to get rid of this\naddiction as soon as possible whenever I\ntry to quit it's just a couple of days\nuntil I change my mind and relapse I'm\nmaking this post as a Last Hope for\nquitting pornography because I really\ncannot focus on my studies and my\nefficacy drops sharply due to this\naddiction which I cannot afford at this\nperiod of time the first thing to\nunderstand I want you all to pay\nattention to the language permanently\nget rid can't seem to stop watching it\num I want to get rid of this addiction\nas soon as possible I cannot afford at\nthis period of time so the first thing\nto understand is that when we get\naddicted to something the addiction\ncreates a desperation to fix I need to\nfix it now it needs to be fixed forever\nso the goal becomes how do I fix f it\npermanently and the moment that we let\nthe desperation fuel our desire to\novercome an addiction is the moment we\nlose to the addiction because if it's\nbeing fueled by the desperation what\nhappens when the desperation eases up a\nlittle bit what happens when you have a\ngood day and you feel less desperate so\nyou are setting up a fuel which will run\nout hey y' if you're interested in\napplying some of the principles that we\nshare to actually create change in your\nlife check out Dr K's guide to Mental\nHealth it combines over two decades of\nmy experience of both being a monk and a\npsychiatrist and distills all of the\nmost important things I've learned into\na Choose Your Own Adventure format so\ncheck out the link in the bio and start\nyour journey today second thing to\nunderstand is that pornography is\nprimarily a emotional regulation\ntechnique so if we look at the data on\npornography and how it affects our brain\npeople do not watch pornography because\nthey're horny or lustful this is a\ncommon misc Inception they're not like\nthe horniest people on the planet or\nhorny people can watch a lot of\npornography but people who tend to get\naddicted to pornography are usually not\nhorny when they watch it okay different\nthings what tends to happen is we use\npornography for emotional regulation so\nthe key thing about sexual activity is\nthat sexual activity has a very powerful\neffect in the brain so if we look at the\npurpose of the human brain and body it\nis to procreate which is why if you look\nat sort of like fertility and like\nthings like that like you'll see this\nsituation where if the body can afford\nto mate it will because that's\nultimately what the goal is so you'll\neven see in some situations like you\nknow angler fish where the male angler\nfish will attach to a female and all of\nthe male angler fish's organs will\natrophy and it will become one giant\ntesticle and pump sperm into the female\nanglerfish so we see some highly\nspecialized adaptations based on\nsexuality and in the human brain or mind\nwhat we end up doing is you sex will\noverride everything else in our head and\nso when sex like when I'm feeling bad if\nthere's an opportunity for sex hey let's\npush that out the window because hey\nthere's sex so when we see pornography\nit triggers these kinds of changes in\nour brain it triggers a a strong amount\nof emotional suppression and then the\nother thing is that often times with\npornography there will be some amount of\nmasturbation there'll be some amount of\norgasm which will release dopamine and\nwill calm down our hippocampus even more\nwe also sort ort of slow down our brain\nright there's post nut Clarity so there\nare all kinds of physiologic and\nneuroscientific changes from watching\npornography but the root of the problem\nis emotions which means if you want to\nquit pornography due to feeling\ndesperate you're doomed to fail because\nthat desperation is what fuels the\npornography I'm feeling so lost I'm\nfeeling so helpless that's when your\nbrain is going to reach for the\npornography so how do you quit\npermanently you do not quit permanently\nthe way to quit permanently is by\nletting go of the word permanent you\ncan't be sober for a year you can be\nsober today you can just resist now so\nif you really want to conquer this stop\nthinking about tomorrow stop thinking\nabout a month from now stop thinking\nabout all the time that you've wasted\nstop thinking about how important it is\nthat this get taken care of all of those\nthoughts are not helpful and in fact\nthey are harmful regret about the past\nnegative emotion fear of the future\nnegative emotion desperation for change\nnegative emotion negative negative\nnegative just feeds the pornography\ninstead one really simple thing don't\nwatch pornography today don't watch\npornography now this moment in time do\nnot watch when tomorrow rolls around\ndon't worry about tomorrow we're going\nto worry about today not today not today\nnot today those of y' all who\nprocrastinate leverage your\nprocrastination procrastinate with\npornography I'll watch tomorrow I'll let\nmyself watch tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow\ntomorrow keep putting it off keep\nputting it off keep putting it off and\nas you put it off other things will\nstart to happen you won't need it quite\nas much you'll start to unwire yourself\nnow a couple of other practical tips\nnumber one number one cause of relapse\nis not actually strong negative emotion\nit is boredom so when you need that\nSpurt of dopamine your brain will make\nyou bored if you struggle with\npornography addiction and video game\naddiction and some other kind of\naddiction boredom is the problem boredom\nis a dopaminergic craving so if you want\nto quit pornography you better have your\nday packed from the moment you get up to\nthe moment you go to bed the more you\nyou can structure your day the less\nvulnerable you will be to pornography\nbecause pornography squeezes in in the\ngaps right I've got 15 minutes let me\nwatch some porn I've got an hour before\nbed I'm done with dinner maybe I'll game\nI don't know what I'm doing I don't want\nto go to sleep yet porn porn will fill\nin whatever Gap you have so if you've\ngot a gap in your day porn will fill it\nnumber two is structure your day as much\nas you can number three is remember that\nthe root of pornography is emotional\nregulation as long as you do not have\nalternate emotional coping skills\npornography will be your def this is\nwhere stuff like meditation works really\nwell or doing something like seeing a\ntherapist things like that like you need\nsome way to regulate your emotions\nbecause the trash has to be taken out\nand porn is really good at taking out\nthe trash so you got to take out the\ntrash in some other way now the key\nthing that people trip up with here is\nthat when you try to take out the trash\nyou have to remember that while you are\nbuilding a new emotional coping skill it\nwill be less effective than anything\nelse you do it will be the biggest waste\nof time this is what people miss about\nemotional coping skills any new coping\nskill you're going to be level zero and\nyou're like a level 92 pornography\nWatcher your brain knows exactly what's\ngoing on knows exactly what it's looking\nfor knows exactly where to find it you\neven know based on what kind of\npornography you watch right depending on\nwhat kind of mood you're in whether you\nneed something a little bit more\nhardcore a little bit less hardcore it's\ninteresting right and that's because\nyour brain knows we need a stronger so\nthis is also interesting if we look at\nwhy pornography is addictive we need a\nsupern normal stimulus and a supernormal\nstimulus is something that is like more\nthan what we're used to so we see\nbrighter colors we see 4K we see\nsurround sound we see VR all this kind\nof stuff is more more stimulus engages\nour brain more so if you really want to\nkick it you got to procrastinate you got\nto pack your day because boredom is\nreally going to be what screws you you\ngot to start start to learn alternate\ncoping skills meditation is probably\nnumber one that's why it's so hard why\ndoes all the bad stuff feel so good what\na great question so in our society today\nall the bad stuff is what feels really\ngood playing video games using drugs\npornography the bad stuff eating\nunhealthy food food that is high in\ncarbohydrates and fat and processed all\nthe why does the worst stuff feel so\ngood it's because the world that we live\nin today is so accessible and easy we\nhave such an abundance of those things\nand back in the day when we evolved the\nthings that made us feel the best were a\nrarity right if you look at calorie\ndensity for example we used to eat stuff\nlike cassab I mean a lot of the world\nstill does right we'd eat these\ndifferent tubers and we'd forage and\nberries and stuff like that we didn't\nhave like animal farms we had like we\nhad to go out and Hunt so there was a\nvery natural balance between our\nyearning for something and the\navailability in the in the in the world\nthe reason that life has become harder\nis because life has become abundant and\neasy and the easier it gets the harder\nthings become for us when I have food\ndelivery grocery delivery I can work\nremotely I I can always find new friends\nonline I don't need to leave the house I\ndon't need to leave my computer I don't\nneed to learn how to repair\nrelationships because I can just block\nsomeone and start talking to someone new\nso the easier the world has become the\nharder things have become for us because\nwhen we wired when our brains evolved\nthey evolved in a certain kind of\nenvironment where we could not gratify\ndesires 24 hours a day it was physically\nimpossible and so now what's happened is\nthe burden has shifted to us to\nself-regulate so we're quickly entering\na world where EQ or emotional quotient\nis more important for your long-term\nsuccess than IQ or your intellectual\ncapability\nself-regulation is what correlates with\nsuccess not intelligence I mean\nintelligence does correlate with success\nbut what we really see is that\nself-regulation and conscientiousness\nare very important and so the stuff the\nreason all the bad stuff feels good is\nbecause it didn't used to be bad because\nit used to be rare but now that it's\nbecome abundant it becomes harmful sex\nis not harmful food is not harmful it is\nthe abundance of those things that is\nharmful and so what's changed is that\nthe availability has increased which\nmeans we need to be more restrictive to\ncompensate so we have to evolve as human\nbeings to survive in this world\n[Music]\ntoday"
