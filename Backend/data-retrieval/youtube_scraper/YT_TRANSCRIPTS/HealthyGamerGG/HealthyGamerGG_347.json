    "transcript": "how do you develop friendships as a dude\nso I think the first problem with this\nis that there's this idea that we\ndevelop friendships I don't think that's\nhow male bonds actually form there isn't\nlike sort of this intentional\ndevelopment I think the biggest thing\nabout developing friendships as a man is\nyou walk up to another dude and you say\nliterally hey you want to hang out\nsometime there doesn't need to be an\nimportant subtext there doesn't need to\nbe an emphasis on like long-term\nengagement or becoming vulnerable in\nfact the extent of vulnerability for\nfriendships with men at the very\nbeginning is hey do you want to hang out\nsometime"
