    "video_title": "Why \"No Fap\" Is So Hard",
    "transcript": "and this is kind of interesting cuz if\nyou look at people who do noof fap one\nof the reasons that I think noof fap is\nso hard is because we have all these\nsexual desires and impulses and noap is\nall about regulating them right so we're\ngoing to smash him down with willpower\nand the reason it's so hard is because\nthen you don't have willpower for\nanything else the reason it's so hard is\nbecause you're not dealing with the\nunderlying desire or horniness which\nmeans that you're constantly regulating\nit and what I've sort of found in my\nclinical work is that when people are\nsexually obsessed it doesn't mean that\nthey're getting laid all the time or\nwhatever but the majority of their\nthoughts have to do with horniness\nlustfulness thinking about sex they tend\nto stall in life and the more that I\nsort of read this research the more I\nconnected the dots that it's not that\nthese people are like worse or pathetic\nor their Bas or anything like that\nbecause that's what they sort of\nconclude the simple reason is because\ntheir brain is spending so much time and\nenergy on regulating their sexual\nimpulses that they've got nothing left\nin the tank to build other parts of\ntheir life"
