    "transcript": "but a lot of the problems that we see\nwith caffeine have to do with the way\nthat it interferes with sleep and this\nisn't just falling asleep this is also\nwhat it does to our sleep architecture\nwhile we sleep so people who have higher\nlevels of caffeine are more likely to\nhave less restful sleep we don't really\nhave great data on what exactly it does\nor what the chances are but this is just\nkind of my observation is that even\nhaving caffeine like caffeine first\nthing in the morning for some people\nwill affect the restfulness of their\nsleep at night so we can also get into\nthis really interesting problem where\ncaffeine Keeps Us kind of artificially\nawake which means that our brain is\nfatigued from excessive use but we have\nso much artificial stimulation from the\ncaffeine that we are not able to fall\nasleep and what this creates is what I\nwould call the zombie window so the\nzombie window is when you are too\ncaffeinated to go to sleep but you are\ntoo mentally exhausted to make good\ndecisions"
