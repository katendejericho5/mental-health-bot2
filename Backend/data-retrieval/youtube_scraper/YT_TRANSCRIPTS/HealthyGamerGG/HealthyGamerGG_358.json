    "video_title": "Does Being a Virgin Make You More Enlightened?",
    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how the\nultimate Chads are actually\nvirgins so in the spiritual Eastern\nTraditions there's this concept of\nbrahmacharya brahmacharya is a Sanskrit\nword that usually gets translated into\ncelibacy but technically it's not\ncelibacy what the literal translation is\nis to dwell in Brahman and Brahman is\nsort of this Cosmic Consciousness so\nwhat it literally sort of means is to\nlike focus on the Divine which kind of\nmore literally translates as non-\nlustfulness and if you sort of look at\nthese Eastern Traditions these like\nmonks and you know meditators and people\nliving in the Himalayas and whatnot they\ntalk about the immense power of\nbrahmacharya and they kind of say that\nif you're a brahmachari in the right way\nthis is what sort of cultivates the most\npowerful spiritual energy that will\nresult in like Enlightenment and freedom\nfrom bondage and all this other kinds of\nstuff right so basically what there\nsaying is if you're not lustful you will\nbecome op hey y'all I want to take a\nsecond to talk about HG coaching and\ny'all may be wondering oh my God bro\nlike I don't want to talk about coaching\nI just want to watch YouTube videos\nbecause there's a part of your brain\nthat recognizes that you need to do\nbetter in life but you don't actually\nwant to invest the time and energy you\njust want to sit there and watch another\nYouTube video which is exactly why I\ndeveloped a coaching program because I\nrealize the problem that we have today\nis not that we don't know what to do\nit's that we don't really\nunderstand how we work and how to get\nourselves to actually do things and the\nreason I developed a coaching program is\nso that 12 weeks from now you can\nactually have made progress we've shown\nthat people improve in their sense of\nlife purpose by about 58% and a 25 to\n45% reduction in depression and anxiety\nthe reason we made a coaching program\nisn't because you can't DIY it it's\nbecause if you want to have made\nsignificant progress 3 months from now\nyou're going to need help doing it so if\nyou're interested check out the link l\nin the description below and if you're\nstill not ready yet totally fine that's\nwhy we literally have 800 YouTube videos\nand so monks in the East are all about\nnot having sex and not being lustful but\nhere in the west and sort of in the\ndeveloped World we're actually moving\ncompletely in the opposite direction\nbecause in today's society sex cells\nright everything that we look at is\nsomehow sexual in some way so you know\nlook at take any sort of celebrity or\nany movie they're they're going to be\ndressing in ways that sort of provoke\ntheir sexuality um we as a society are\nobsessed with sex we sort of place value\non human beings based on their sexual\nactivity so for some of us if if you get\nif you're having a lot of sex that means\nthat you are a superior human being to\nother human beings but on the flip\nthat's usually men right so we'll sort\nof say oh like this guy is like so he's\nso Alpha and he's having sex with so\nmany people he is a better human being\nthan I am and on the flip side we've got\nthe betas right and the betas are kind\nof like well I'm not having as much sex\nas other people or I've never had sex so\nlike I'm not useful as a human being and\nI've literally worked with patients who\nare suicidal because they've never had\nsex at the age of 21 I'm not trying to\nbash them or anything but that's just\npeople's experience on the flip side if\nwe look at women this is also a\nsituation where the more sex you have\nthe less valuable you are as a woman\nright so something weird is going on in\nour society where we place value on\nhuman beings based on their sexual\nactivity and there may be some kind of\nlike biological like imperative kind of\nargument here right so a lot of these\npeople are quite pseudoscientific and\nthey'll sort of say well like the\npurpose of human beings is to procreate\nand so like you know procreation is why\nthe reason that sex is so important is\nbecause it's biology it's not us it's\nnot a human construction this is what\nthe biology the biology wants us to all\nhave\nsex and so if you sort of think about it\nfor a second right a virgin who goes to\na sperm bank once a week is much more\nbiologically successful than someone who\nis getting laid all the time and\npressuring all of their Partners to be\non birth control or get abortions\nbecause they don't want to be a father\nand they don't want the responsibilities\nof it right so like the biological\nimperative thing is kind of insane like\nwe don't need human beings to have human\nbeings and if you kind of look at it\nlike there are lots of people out there\nwho are neither Alphas nor betas but are\njust like from countries without birth\ncontrol and they're having like eight\nnine kids and they're you know just\nordinary human beings so I don't quite\nbuy this biological imperative I'm sure\nthere's some argument there's some truth\nto it obviously right so we know that we\nwant to propagate the species and all\nthat good stuff but I think that this is\nsort of where like a lot of\npsychological stuff gets conflated as\nbiology but at the end of the day I was\nsort of stuck between these two\nperspectives so here in the East you\nhave all these people who are saying\nthat non- lustfulness is super op and\nhere in the west we have entire lives\nthat are constructed around getting laid\nso then I started to wonder okay if if\nthese like people in the East are right\nabout this then there should be some\nscience to it right there should be some\nscientific evidence that not having sex\nfor some amount of time or not being\nlustful which is technically what it is\nyou can actually have sex as a\nbrahmachari which\nis issue for a later date but so what\nthey were sort of saying is that okay\nlike if this truly makes you op there\nmust be some scientific evidence for it\nand I went and I I tried to find like\nokay what does the science say about\npeople who are not lustful or don't have\nsex like what would change in the brain\nright so I get when I get curious about\nthis stuff I look at the science and\nwhat I found was I couldn't find an\nanswer and that's when it hit me that\nthere's actually a really really\ninteresting answer so if we look at the\nscience of sex and the Brain regions\ninvolved in sex I was trying to figure\nout okay which brain region is affected\nif we have sex or we don't have sex\nwhich parts of the brain are involved\nand it turns out that literally every\npart of the brain is involved in Sex and\nthis is actually a really interesting\nphenomenon because if you look at\nbasically any other human function if we\nlook at like language or the ability to\ndo mathematics or even hunger and thirst\nif we look at the way that we form\nrelationships the way that we process\nvisual information the where we\nexperience our emotions where we where\nwillpower comes from every other human\nfaculty can be reduced to some part of\nthe brain the weird thing with sex is\nthat every part of the brain literally\nevery part of the brain is involved in\nsex so let's take a quick look at this\npaper so this is a great review it's\ncalled the neuroanatomy and function of\nhuman sexual behavior okay so they're\ntalking about okay which part of the\nbrain are involved with\nsex and if we kind of scroll down like\nthis is what's kind of interesting\nsummary of brain areas involved in human\nsexual behavior so like okay so this is\nthe reward system there's the thalamus\nis involved the hypothalamus is involved\nthe amydala is involved the sepal region\nthe prefrontal cortex the singulate\ncortex the insula right all of those are\ninvolved and all the sensory parts are\ninvolved to the occipital cortex and all\nthat kind of stuff so like basically the\nwhole brain and then like all of these\nareas are somehow main brain regions of\ninvolved in human behavior it's like\nmost of the brain okay and then there's\nalso subdivisions like their various\ncortical areas so the the cerebral\ncortex is kind of what makes us human\nand lots of different parts of the\ncerebral cortex are involved in sex but\nwhat about things from a more and they\ntalk about networks and stuff like that\num but what about things like\nneurotransmitters right so we sort of\nsay okay like dopamine is the pleasure\nchemical and serotonin like helps you\nfeel good and like norepinephrine is\nadrenaline and like all of these\ndifferent neurotransmitters do different\nthings right it turns out that like\nliterally all of them are involved in\nsex in some way and so this is the\nreally crazy thing is I was trying to\nfigure out okay like if someone is\ncelibate for a little while or they're\nnon- lustful which parts of the brain\nget freed up and it turns out that like\nall of them get affected okay and that's\nwhen it sort of hit me holy crap maybe\nthese mugs are actually on to something\nbecause the reason they say it's so op\nis because this is the one axis which\nwill affect like literally all parts of\nyour brain and affect every\nneurotransmitter and so maybe they're\nactually on to something and as I dug\nmore into the research I found a couple\nof things that I thought were really\ninteresting so we're going to just\nhighlight three of the many regions that\nare involved in this okay the first\nregion that we're going to talk about is\nthe amydala so the amydala is the center\nof our brain that we experience\nprimarily negative emotions and it's\nalso our survival center of the brain so\nthis is a part of the brain that helps\nus stay alive so this is what teaches us\nthings like fear so if I see a bear out\nin the wilderness I'm going to have a\nfear response that'll happen in my\namydala and then like I will hopefully\nrun away from the bear so if we sort of\nthink about it like the amydala is\ncritical for survival but a lot of our\nsuffering comes from the amydala if we\nlook at people who are depressed or\nanxious or have borderline personality\ndisorder or narcissistic personality\ndisorder even ADHD or Autism Spectrum\nall of these disorders have some kind of\ndisregulation of the amydala so people\nwho are have ADHD for example have\nemotional disregulation they feel their\nemotions more powerfully and it's harder\nto get them under control and this has\nto do with a disregulated amydala or\nnon-optimized amydala so it turns out\nthat if you look at sort of the science\nof it the Neuroscience of it the\nneuropathology of it if you leion the\namydala if someone damages the amydala\nwhat happens is we become\nhypersexual so as the amydala gets\ndamaged or weakened in some way our\nsexuality actually skyrockets and in\nsome cases there's this thing called clu\nbuy syndrome which is like really really\nhypersexuality like these people are\nconstantly you know humping things and\nmasturbating and and hitting on things\nlike and and I I'm not talking about\ninternet degenerates okay I know that\nyall are going to\nsay I do that too everyone on the\nInternet is so horny no this is like a\nmedical condition that people need to be\nhospitalized because otherwise they\nwould constantly sexually assault other\nhuman beings okay so maybe internet\nusers I don't know but it's a serious\nproblem okay so here's the interesting\nthing so as we damage the amydala\nhypersexuality increases so then there's\na really interesting principle in the\nbrain which is that most things are\nreciprocal right so it kind of begs the\nquestion okay well if we like control\nthe amydala and we restrain the amydala\nwhat would end up happening what our\nsexuality decrease the answer is yes and\nsome people even hypothesize that a\ncertain kind of activity in the amydala\nis required for Spiritual experiences so\nyou have these like stories of these\nlike Mystics or Saints or even people\nlike\ndostoevski and there's a lot of like\ninteresting neuroscientific hypothesis\nhypotheses about what's going on in the\nbrains of these people who are like\nhyper religious and have visions of God\nand it turns out that there's a\nparticular activity within the amydala\nthat correlates with spiritual\nexperiences so on the one hand if we\ndamage the amydala we become hypersexual\nbut if we do something else to the\namydala I'm going to go ahead and say\nfine tune it but that's not really a\nfair scientific statement then we sort\nof result in spiritual or religious\nexperiences really interesting right the\nsecond aspect that is really really\nimportant is that the inhibition of\nsexual activity and sexual thoughts is\nprobably the number one cause of\nwillpower drain so if we look at the\nability to regulate ourselves we can\nonly regulate ourselves so much right so\nafter a hard day of work when I'm when I\nkind of get home and I'm sort of\nfatigued and I don't want to do anything\nlike that's when I order a pizza because\nI don't have any will power left to eat\na salad after a hard day of work when we\nfeel emotionally drained when we feel\nmentally drained we have no willower\nleft to do anything else and so one of\nthe really interesting things is if you\nlook at kind of the science of it one of\nthe most powerful sources of willpower\ndrain is actually inhibition of sexual\nthoughts and sexual activities and this\nis kind of interesting because if you\nlook at people who who do noap one of\nthe reasons that I think noap is so hard\nis because we have all these sexual\ndesires and impulses and noap is all\nabout regul ating them right so we're\ngoing to smash him down with willpower\nand the reason it's so hard is because\nthen you don't have willpower for\nanything else the reason it's so hard is\nbecause you're not dealing with the\nunderlying desire or horniness which\nmeans that you're constantly regulating\nit and what I've sort of found in my\nclinical work is that when people are\nsexually obsessed it doesn't mean that\nthey're getting laid all the time or\nwhatever but the majority of their\nthoughts have to do with horniness\nlustfulness thinking about sex they tend\nto stall in life and the more that I\nsort of read this research the more I\nconnected the dots that it's not that\nthese people are like worse or pathetic\nor their betas or anything like that\nbecause that's what they sort of\nconclude the simple reason is because\ntheir brain is spending so much time and\nenergy on regulating their sexual\nimpulses that they've got nothing left\nin the tank to build other parts of\ntheir life and the really interesting\nthing is that even the red pillars have\nsort of stumbled upon this right and the\nred pillars are the ones who will say\nlike actually stop worrying about\ngetting laid and focus on yourself and\nso they've also sort of stumbled into\nthis which is really interesting which\nis that stop thinking about sex so much\nand start going to the gyms you know\nwork on your career do all of these\nthings and then attraction will come the\nsecond thing that's really interesting\nis that sexual activity sexual thoughts\nresult in a lot of require a lot of\ninhibition that results in a lot of\nwillpower drain the third thing that\nwe're going to talk about and there's\nlike thousands more but the third thing\nwe're going to focus on is actually\nserotonin so serotonin is a\nneurotransmitter that's responsible for\na lot of stuff including things like gut\nperistalsis and what does gut\nperistalsis mean that means that as we\neat something the food travels from our\nstomach all the way through our\nintestines and out the back end right if\nwe're lucky and so that is governed by\nserotonin so serotonin does all kinds of\nstuff but one of the things that it does\nin the brain is it leads to a sense of\ncontentment and peace and relaxation so\nwhat we sort of know is that there's two\nkinds of like pleasure or posit positive\nexperiences that humans can have one is\ngoverned by dopamine so dopamine gives\nus excitement Joy pleasure adrenaline\nfun and serotonin gives us contentment\nwe're kind of chilling we're relaxing\nI'm happy I don't need to do anything\nfun because I'm just sitting by the\nwater and I'm reading my book and I'm\nkind of just enjoying life okay we also\nknow that serotonin is somehow impaired\nor messed up in some way when it comes\nto a lot of mental illnesses that sort\nof theory is still being hotly debated\nbut what we sort of know is is that\nmedications that boost our serotonin\nTransmission in the brain tend to\nalleviate symptoms of depression and\nanxiety so we sort of know that okay\nlike high levels of Serotonin generally\nspeaking are kind of healthy but when we\ngive someone this anti-depressant or\nanti-anxiety medication one of the most\ncommon side effects as we boost\nserotonin Transmission in the brain is\nanorgasmia or reduced sexual drive so\nanorgasmia is the inability to have an\norgasm which means that people on ssris\nor anti-depressant medication they can\nstill become erect or become somewhat\nsexually aroused but they're not able to\ncomplete an orgasm so it's difficult for\nthem the second thing is that we find\nthat there's a reduction in arousal so\nonce again we're seeing something really\nreally interesting which is that as we\njack up our serotonin levels it leads to\ntheoretically more peace and contentment\nbut makes it difficult to have\nsex and now this is kind of really\ninteresting right because now we're sort\nof stumbling into something that's\nreally kind of interesting which is that\nif we are a lot of the healthy things in\nlife a lot of the optimal functioning\nthat we want in life actually is\ninversely correlated with our sexuality\nthe more Lusty we are the more we have\nto inhibit our sexual impulses and the\nless willpower we have the less\nproductive we are there's something\nabout weird around serotonin and\ncontentment where the more content we\nare if you artificially boost serotonin\nwe become less sexual over time and\nthat's absolutely something that I can\nattest to in terms of my own own\nspiritual practice we just can become\nless lustful and the last thing is that\nsomething around our emotional\nregulation and our hypersexuality is\ncorrelated where the more disregulated\nour emotions are the more likely we are\nto become sexual and the more regulated\nour emotions are the more likely we are\nto become spiritual so there's some\nreally interesting Neuroscience kind of\nevidence about this now the question\nkind of becomes okay Dr K but like what\ndo we do about it are you saying that I\nshould become non- lustful and this is\nwhere I'd love to share with youall kind\nof a story okay so once upon a time\nthere was a monk and when the monk was\nmeditating he noticed that there was a\nrat in his room that was running by so\nmonk would sit in meditation the rat\nwould realize okay Monk's not awake it's\nlike they're asleep so I can run around\nand stuff like that and so the monk goes\nto a friend of inst and says hey like\nevery time I meditate there's this rat\nthat comes out friend is like you know\ndon't worry about it if you have a rat\nproblem you should get a cat the monk is\nlike that sounds like a great idea so he\ngets a cat and then as he get gets the\ncat he starts to realize oh like I need\nto feed the cat something so he goes to\nhis friend and he says well now I've got\nthis cat the cat took care of the Rat\nbut I got to feed the cat which I do and\nthe friend says no problem so I have\ncats too really simple thing you just\nneed to get a cow and you can just milk\nthe cow every day and then you'll have\nplenty of milk for the cat and you'll\nmilk for yourself too so the monke is\nlike great to solve this problem of what\nto feed the cat I will get a cow and\nthen the monk is like hold on a second\nso he gets milk for a couple days and\nhe's like well what am I supposed to\nfeed the cow so he goes to his friend\nand he says well now I've got this cow\nlike I don't know what to feed it he's\nlike hey no problem I I got you man I\nsince you're a monk and you're a holy\nperson I've got this plot of land I'll\nlet you use the plot of land you just\nhave to take care of it and stuff like\nthat and you'll have plenty of grazing\nland for your your cow and so then the\nthe monk is like okay fine thank you so\nmuch so he gets this plot of land and\nthe cow is grazing every day and now\nhe's like taking care of this plot of\nland and he's like well like now what do\nI do I mean this is too much like taking\ncare of this whole plot of land like\nit's too much for me to handle and his\nfriend is like don't worry about it you\nknow there's there's absolutely an easy\nsolution to this the monkeyy is like\nwhat's that he's like you should get\nmarried have a family right cuz on a\nfarm like you can't take care of a whole\nFarm by yourself so you need to get\nmarried have some kids and you'll be\nyou'll be golden you'll be Gucci the\nmonke is like okay fine she decides to\nget married and have\nkids and this I love this story because\nit's like this is what we've done with\nsex we've taken this tiny little thing\nwhich is sex and by the way y'all may be\nsurprised to hear do you know how much\nsex people have on average so the a\naverage sexual coupling lasts 3 to 7\nminutes and if you pull the average\nperson who has sex including women they\nwill say that 10 to 30 minutes of sexual\npenetrative intercourse is too much the\naverage sexual duration is 3 to 7\nminutes and if you're someone who's Like\na Virgin who's never had sex and all you\ndo is watch pornography and these are\nhour and a half pornography videos this\nmay sound\nconfusing but if you are someone who has\nhad sexual relationships for a long\nperiod of time you will know exactly\nwhat I'm talking about doesn't take that\nlong the other wild thing about this by\nthe way that's why foreplay is so\nimportant okay because like you know\npeople just don't like penetrative\nintercourse like 25 minutes straight\nthat's why forplay and arousal and all\nthat stuff is really really important\nokay but that's neither here nor there\nthe other really interesting is how\noften do people have sex most people\nhave sex once a week sometimes twice a\nweek and so here's the problem with our\nsociety today we have an activity that\nwe do for on average 3 to seven minutes\nonce a week okay so let's say that like\nthat that in that the way that we\ncollected that data is kind of messed up\nso let's be like even more conservative\nlet's say we have three time sex three\ntimes a week okay so like triple the\naverage and let's say that our duration\nis also triple the average we're going\nto have sex for 21 minutes three times a\nweek this is 1 hour of your week and\nwhat do we construct to get this this\nhour of enjoyment right it's one hour a\nweek this results in my sense of\nselfworth this results in the career\nthat I pick it results results in the\nthe way that I do my hair the clothing\nthat I buy the fact that I need to buy\nclothing the fact that I need to have a\njob what I eat what I want to spend my\ntime doing everything that we do in this\nlife is just like the Monk and the rat\nin order to satisfy ourselves for 63\nminutes a week on the top end we are\nconstructing our entire life to do these\n63 minutes we are obsessed with it and\nthere are people that I've worked with\nthat are literally suicid because they\ncan't have sex and so what does this\nmean for you so I want to share with you\nall kind of like a very very interesting\nperspective so when we look at you know\npeople who are obsessed with sex and\nthey kind of say like okay like I'm\ngoing to make a I need I make six\nfigures I need to become six feet tall I\nneed to have a 6 inch dick like whatever\nright so I need to do all these things I\nneed to get in shape and then I can get\nlaid as much as I want to so you are by\nthe way sacrificing the rest of your\nlife for this objective which I don't\nthink is worth it but okay fine if you\nwant to say it's worth it in the\nbiological imp of whatever but I'm going\nto give you all kind of this interesting\nperspective from the East which is\nreally what brah macharia is which is\nnon- lustfulness which is I want yall to\nthink about what you want freedom and\npower for so a lot of people that I talk\nto will say like yeah I want to be free\nand I want to have power I want to have\nmoney and the question is why right why\ndo you want freedom so I don't want any\nexternal constraints I don't want to go\nto work I don't want to have to have a\njob I just want an endless amount of\nmoney in my bank account and then the\nquestion is why and then what these\npeople almost always inevitably come\ndown down to is so I can indulge my\ninternal desires so if I had no external\nconstraints then I could do whatever I\nfeel like but the crazy thing is that\ngiving into whatever you feel like is a\ndifferent kind of bondage it's not\nreally Freedom if I have an endless\namount of money but all I'm doing every\nday is like using cocaine and like\neating unhealthy food and like hiring\nhookers or like whatever or even not\neven hookers but taking people on first\nclass flights so that I can get laid\nwhat kind of freedom is that like it\nsounds epic don't get me wrong right and\nI've literally worked with people who\nhave done this right so I've worked with\npeople who are have just gigantic trust\nfund babies and their lives are absolute\nmesses and you can look at Celebrities\nand you can look at all kinds of people\nwho are privileged you could see like\nthese people are screwed up and I think\nwhat the yogis really figured out and\nthis is the value of brah macharia is\nthat even if you have all the external\nfreedom in the world are you just going\nto give in bondage within are you going\nto give in all of these impulses yeah I\ndrink this kind of coffee every day and\nI'd have this $5,000 espresso machine\nand it would make the best cup of\nespresso and then everything around me\nlike I do this I do this I do this and\nyou're just giving into that bondage\nover and over and over again and it does\nnot lead to happiness now I'm not saying\ndon't pursue it because I think the\nright thing to do is to chase all of\nthose things right by all means go for\nit and get your $5,000 espresso machine\nand have the $5,000 cup of espresso and\nthen have a $2 cup of espresso from the\nCuban place down the street and notice\nthe difference between those two things\nif yall haven't guessed I've actually\ndone those two things right and what\nyou'll discover I think is what the\nyogis discovered when they sort of\ndiscovered brah macharia which is that\nbondage to our internal self is actually\nthe source of our suffering and if we\nreally want to be free from in this\nworld it's not the outside stuff that we\nnecessarily need to be free from that if\nyou can be free from the things in here\nthen you will have true freedom and\nBliss and all kinds of other stuff and\non a more practical perspective I think\nwhat they sort of realized is as we stop\nobsessing over sex it frees up our brain\nto handle all kinds of other things so\nat the end of the day I'm not suggesting\nthat yall become brahmacharis I'm not\nsuggesting that you become celibate but\nparadoxically that's what helped me you\nknow find my partner long term which is\nwhen I walked around and I kind of said\nhey I'm celibate now right and something\nbeautiful happen when I did that I said\nokay I'm going to be a brahmachari\nbecause I want to be a spiritual Chad\nand then what happened is all of my\ninteractions changed right so now when I\nmeet people women I'm not like worried\nabout does this person like me does this\nperson not like me I just get to be with\nthis person with no goal in mind with no\nthoughts of lust or anything like that\nI'm just like I'm going to just be with\nthis person I'm going to appreciate this\nhuman being for who they are even when I\nmeet with men there's no thoughts of\nokay this person is better looking than\nI am less better looking than I am I'm\nI'm Chad they're more Alpha I'm more\nbeta all those thoughts go out the\nwindow because it's like I'm not worried\nabout that anymore right that's not a\npart of my life so I can sit down with\nanother dude and like we can just be\nchilling without any sense of\ncompetition or I'm meeting this friend\nfor the first time and a hot girl walks\nup and now suddenly it's like all right\nlike now we're in this competition to\none up each other and all this other\nstupid crap and you just let let freak\nget Let It Go be free of it and it's\nliberating to not worry about that crap\nall the time imagine what your life\nwould be like if you were not not\nthinking about sex or getting laate or\nwhat this person thinks or what that\nperson thinks imagine what you could\naccomplish but instead we sacrifice our\nwhole life our whole sense of identity\nwe choose careers literally people will\ngive themselves heart attacks to make so\nmuch money so that they can get laid by\nthe person who they think is the hottest\nyou're are sacrificing so much of your\nlife for this one thing and how much is\nit really 3 to 7 minutes once a week is\nwhat we're talking about so is is it\nworth it I encourage youall to think\nabout this this isn't uh stop having sex\nor anything like that this is like think\nabout the way that Society has\nconditioned you think about what you\nwant your life to be and if you really\nwant to be free of all that crap and\nreally want to live up to your full\npotential I strongly encourage you to\ntake one step towards\n[Music]\nbrahmacharya\nm"
