    "transcript": "we also have evidence that shows that\ntrauma correlates with changes in\nattachment style so the more traumatized\nyou are so in the cases of severe severe\ntrauma we'll see a disorganized\nattachment style and that is all about\nhow you connect to other people you\nconnect to other people in a\ndisorganized way so we'll see things\nlike an anxious attachment style where\nif your needs were not met sometimes we\nbecome anxiously attached and we become\nclingy which will affect our\nrelationships sometimes we have an\navoidant attachment style where our\nemotional vulnerabilities punished us so\nwe work very very very hard to be\nemotionally unavailable that will\nabsolutely affect your relationships"
