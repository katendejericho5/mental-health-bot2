    "transcript": "what makes a therapist bad what a great\nquestion so let's talk about this a good\ntherapist listens a good therapist\nadapts to your needs so what we mean by\nlisten is as a therapist it's your job\nto take everything that you've learned\nand not apply 90% of it to your patient\nthis is the difference between a good\ntherapist and a bad therapist the bad\ntherapists in my opinion are the ones\nthat have learned a lot of stuff and\nthey come in and they say oh look at all\nthe stuff that I know I will apply it to\nyou we're going to make you a standard\nfast food sandwich with no customization\nbecause this is what works good\ntherapists are the ones that recognize\nwhat parts of their knowledge don't\napply to this person which parts of\ntheir knowledge need to be adapted to\nthis person"
