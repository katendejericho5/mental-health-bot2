    "transcript": "and this is the problem of caffeine is\nthat it doesn't allow us to fall asleep\nand we're tired because we didn't sleep\nenough and then we are groggy and when\nwe are tired and groggy what do we drink\nfirst thing in the morning we drink\ncaffeine what's the effect of caffeine\non the brain in the long term how safe\nis the consumption of caffeine to one's\nme one's health so this is a great\nquestion we talk about alcohol we talk\nabout nowadays marijuana and there are\nlots of people who are super super pro\nmarijuana and people are also exploring\nthings like psychedelics but there are\nsome substances that have generally\nspeaking been legal all over the world\nhave never been criminalized have never\nbeen considered drugs of abuse and are\nstill very psychoactive and caffeine is\nnumber one on the list I think 90% of\npeople in America I think use caffeine\nof some kind on a daily basis 90% of\nadults um so it it's staggeringly\nwidespread and a lot of people wonder\nokay what are the the impacts of\ncaffeine because we do develop a\ntolerance to it hey all I want to take a\nsecond to talk about HG coaching and\ny'all may be wondering oh my God bro\nlike I don't want to talk about coaching\nI just want to watch YouTube videos\nbecause there's a part of your brain\nthat recognizes that you need to do\nbetter in life but you don't actually\nwant to invest the time and energy you\njust want to sit there and watch another\nYouTube video which is exactly why I\ndeveloped a coaching program because I\nrealized the problem that we have today\nis not that we don't know what to do\nit's that we don't really understand how\nwe work and how to get ourselves to\nactually do things and the reason I\ndeveloped a coaching program is so that\n12 weeks from now you can actually have\nmade progress we've shown that people\nimprove in their sense of life purpose\nby about 58% and a 25 to 45% reduction\nin depression and anxiety the reason we\nmade a coaching program isn't because\nyou can't DIY it it's because if you\nwant to have made significant progress 3\nmonths from now you're going to need\nhelp doing it so if you're interested\ncheck out the link in the description\nbelow and if you're still not ready yet\ntotally fine that's why we literally\nhave 800 YouTube videos so there a\ncouple of things to understand the first\nis that the data on caffeine is mixed\nthere are a lot of studies that show\nthat caffeine has health benefits can do\nthings like reduce the risk of dementia\ncan increase like all kinds of\ncardiovascular kind of outcomes there's\ngood evidence that shows that a Moder\namount of caffeine on a daily basis is\nsomewhat healthful help healthy for our\nlongevity and mental health but we also\nknow that caffeine can be damaging for\nespecially developing brains and this is\nwhere I'd say if you're trying to figure\nout okay what should I do about my\ncaffeine intake number one thing to\nunderstand is that the earlier you start\nusing caffeine in brain development the\ngreater the chance is that you will have\nsome kind of harmful effect so our brain\ndevelops until we're about the age of\n2728 for those of y'all who started at\nthe age age of 16 GG no I'm kidding it's\nnot that bad let's understand okay but\nif you want to if you're trying to\nfigure out what is the healthiest way to\nuse caffeine I would say start after the\nage of 28 cuz what we know about\ncaffeine is that it tends to protect\nagainst neurod degeneration that happens\nlater in life okay but what we know\nabout caffeine is that when you take it\nvery early so for example if we look at\nstudies of prenatal caffeine exposure so\nfetuses that are in the uterus uteri of\npregnant women who get a large exposure\nto caffeine have certain changes to\ntheir brain so a couple of the things\nthat we see are decreased kind of\nefficacy of the frontal loes so these\nare babies that will sometimes have\ndifficulty with\nself-regulation so we know that caffeine\nand prenatal exposure sort of tampers\nwith our frontal loes we also know that\nit tampers with our reward circuitry so\npeople the most interesting thing is\nthat early caffeine exposure the most\nclear danger that we see to that or\nexcessive caffeine exposure during the\ndeveloping brain actually has to do with\nyour weight your sugar metabolism and\nyour binge eating behaviors so we know\nthat caffeine is an appetite suppressant\nand so when you have an appetite\nsuppressant in the brain in a developing\nbrain like a fetus or even a young child\nit tampers with our sugar metabolism so\nlike when we start suppressing appetite\nwe feel less hungry as we feel less\nhungry we eat less food as we eat less\nfood our energy balance starts to dip as\nour energy balance dips a compensatory\naction happens in the body our body is\nlike hey we've run out of energy we need\nto eat more calorie dense foods we need\nto eat foods that give us a lot of\nenergy really quickly because the\ncaffeine has caused us to fall behind on\nour food on our caloric intake for the\nday so what we actually see is that the\nmore caffeine that you ingest prenatally\nthe more likely your child is to develop\nobesity the more likely your child is to\nhave problems with their blood sugar and\nwhat we see sort of cognitively is an\nincreased susceptibility to cravings for\nfood so what's really interesting is\nthat if you are trying to figure out\nlike if you're trying to think about\nokay what problems does caffeine cause\nmost of the problems that we actually\nsee have to do around diet and sugar so\nparadoxically one thing you can really\nthink about is if you're having trouble\neating a healthy diet and are vulnerable\nto highly processed foods with a very\nhigh nutrient density there is a chance\nthat cutting back on your caffeine will\nhelp you with that on the flip side we\nalso know that for people who are\nintermittent fasting for example they\nwill recommend caffeine intake early on\nin the morning or even into the\nafternoon to make it easier to tolerate\nthat sort of fasting window right so if\nyou're doing something like 186 and\nyou're awake for like 8 10 hours a day\nwithout eating caffeine can really be\nuseful appetite stimulant in that way\nbut I'd say that the primary problem\nthat caffeine causes has to do with like\nmaking it difficult for us to regulate\nour blood sugar our sense of hunger and\nour Cravings the other big thing that we\nsee with caffeine is that it interferes\nwith sleep so the second M main problem\nwith caffeine has nothing to do with\nnecessarily brain development but a lot\nof the problems that we see with\ncaffeine have to do with the way that it\ninterferes with sleep and this isn't\njust falling asleep this is also what it\ndoes to our sleep architecture while we\nsleep so people who have have higher\nlevels of caffeine are more likely to\nhave less restful sleep we don't really\nhave great data on what exactly it does\nor what the chances are but this is just\nkind of my observation is that even\nhaving caffeine like caffeine first\nthing in the morning for some people\nwill affect the restfulness of their\nsleep at night so we can also get into\nthis really interesting problem where\ncaffeine Keeps Us kind of artificially\nawake which means that our brain is\nfatigued from excessive use but we have\nso much artificial stimulation from the\ncaffeine that we are not able to fall\nasleep and what this creates is what I\nwould call the zombie window so the\nzombie window is when you are too\ncaffeinated to go to sleep but you are\ntoo mentally exhausted to make good\ndecisions and what this kind of results\nin is a period of time usually between 2\nand 4 hours between like 1100 p.m. and\n1:00 a.m. somewhere in there is usually\nwhat we're talking about maybe 10:00\nmaybe maybe 2: a.m. 3:00 a.m. somewhere\nin that 11 to1 window is really where\nthe the major part of it is where you're\ntoo tired to actually do anything\nproductive and since your brain is\ndisinhibited and you've run out of\nwillpower for the day you end up doing\nstupid like being on your phone or\nwhatever or like playing video games or\nordering things online or like buying\nstocks right and this is kind of\ninteresting so there was a major um\nTrader that was just betting against\neveryone who did stock trades like at 2\nin the morning so major Trader realized\nthat all these like retail Traders so\npeople are downloading these apps like\nRobin Hood and they realize that people\nmake stupid decisions like after\nmidnight there's a a major clearing\nhouse that was like any Noob who is\nusing an app who purchases anything\nafter midnight we're just going to take\nthe opposite end of the bet whatever\nthey want to buy we're willing to sell\nit and they made a ton of money because\nthey were correct that people make\nstupid decisions when they're mentally\nfatigued and this is the problem of\ncaffeine is that it doesn't allow us to\nfall asleep but extends this window of\nkind of bad behavior so then what\nhappens is we wake up the next day and\nwe're tired because we didn't sleep\nenough because the caffeine was floating\naround in our brain and then we are\ngroggy and when we are tired in groggy\nwhat do we drink first thing in the\nmorning we drink caffeine and so this is\nalso important to understand the way\nthat caffeine boosts our energy is not\nby boosting our energy the way that\ncaffeine makes us feel more more\nenergized is by blocking adenosine\nreceptors so adenosine is the waste\nproduct from something called ATP which\nis a general energy molecule in our body\nit's like the most basic form of energy\nthat we have so really what you're doing\nis you're not actually improving your\nenergy you're just blocking the fatigue\nsignal so when you get dependent on\ncaffeine what happens is that you are\nfunctionally impaired because you're\nfatigued you're like not at 100% by any\nmeans but your brain tricks you into\nthinking you've got energy which is how\nwe enter this zombie state of like I\ncan't fall asleep and I don't really\nfeel like doing anything but I don't\nactually have a functioning brain that\nis like able to enter the Flow State so\nthese are the problems that I tend to\nsee with caffeine number one is it\nmesses with our sugar balance and our\nhunger and our cravings and our ability\nto binge eat and things like that it\nreally tampers with that second thing\nthat we tend to see is this weird stuff\naround falling asleep and not being able\nto fall asleep and like messing with our\nREM sleep so we're tired the next day\nand then we also developed caffeine\ndepend\nso in the in the absence of caffeine we\nfeel very groggy and tired and so those\nare the problem now like I said there's\na fair amount of evidence that shows\nthat caffeine is also neuroprotective\nagainst dementia moderate amounts\nusually one cup of coffee a day or tea\nor something like that is probably on\nbalance healthy for you is my guess but\nwe also have to remember that when you\ndrink coffee or tea or you you are\ngetting way more than caffeine you're\nalso getting antioxidants you're getting\nall kinds of like bitter stuff and you\nknow you got different stuff in like\ngreen tea that is helpful like theopen I\nthink is in green tea as well and\ntheophine can even is even a medication\nthat we use for people who have asthma\nused to that will like open up their\nairways so there are all kinds of\ninteresting benefits around\ncardiovascular health respiratory Health\nbut you got to watch out friend ofy is\nasking is it caffeine or coffee that's\nprotective can I take a caffeine pill\nand get the same benefits chances are\ncoffee is far more protective than a\ncaffeine pill so there's also something\nelse to understand about most\npsychoactive natural compound compounds\nso if you look at the difference between\ncaffeine pill and something like coffee\ncoffee has antioxidants may have other\ncompounds that are stimulants like thein\nis a good example I don't know if thein\nis in coffee but it's definitely in\ngreen tea so you'll have um a variety of\ndifferent psychoactive compounds in a\nnatural plant-based form the interesting\nthing is that most plants that are\npsychoactive actually have compounds\nthat do both so in the case of for\nexample marijuana we know that there are\ncompounds that can increase psychosis or\neven a sensation of anxiety and there\nare compounds that can decrease\npsychosis and a sensation of anxiety and\nin Baseline marijuana we have both so it\ntends to happen when we create\nartificial marijuana so we had a bad\noutbreak of this in in Boston back in\nlike 2010 2012 I don't know if it's\nstill a problem up there but of\nsomething called K2 which is artificial\nmarijuana and boy did people get\npsychotic off of K2 like all the time\nlike every day I was in the emergency\nroom someone is like floridly psychotic\nso one thing that tends to happen is\nanytime we purify something and remove\nit from its plant compound we exac we\nreally escalate the the bio biological\neffect and frequently we'll T tip it out\nof balance now we use this\ntherapeutically when we're using drugs\nlike aspirin and cholesterol medications\nand things like that but generally\nspeaking when you remove caffeine out of\nsomething I think it's going to be more\nlikely to be harmful than\nbalanced\n[Music]\nhe"
