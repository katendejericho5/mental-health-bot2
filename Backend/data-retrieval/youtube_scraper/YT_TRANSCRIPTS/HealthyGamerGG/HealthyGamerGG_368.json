    "transcript": "if you think a piece of information is\nwrong and you're listening to someone\nelse and your mind is reflexively\nchallenging it if you really want to\nlearn and change what you should do is\ntry to understand how that information\ncould be right so try to take the other\nperson's point of view and question your\nown beliefs right so this is something\nthat the internet doesn't do the\ninternet is like hey I think this is\nwrong therefore screw them downvote\ncancel them we never question our own\nbeliefs and this is how we create Echo\nChambers and this is how we stay stuck\nso if you are someone who consumes some\nkind of content this is really common by\nthe way right so we see this a lot with\nlike people who are consuming content\nthat they disagree with this going to be\npolitical where I'm going to watch\nvideos of people who I politically\ndisagree with and I'm going to just poop\non them in my head and I'm going to feel\nbetter about myself so this is what our\nmind reflexively does so if you want to\nreally learn something I know it sounds\ninsane but try to understand the other\nperson's perspective"
