    "transcript": "and so the basic problem if you're\nsuffering everyday in life is that you\nhaven't been taught how to live it and\nyou haven't asked the question what is\nthe source of my\n[Music]\nsuffering why do people choose to live\nlife when most of it is just suffering I\nneed this answer I need to know hello\nall for the past 2 years I've been\nstruggling to answer this one question\nwhy do people choose to live despite it\nall when I look at everyone's Liv around\nme I'm just so stunned for most people\nlife is nothing more than a cycle of\nworking your ass off all day so that you\ncan make enough money to feed yourself\nso that you can wake up the next day to\nrepeat the same thing again and again\nand again until you die and I have not\nbeen able to cope with this not at all\nthis question struck me hard two years\nago back when I was 16 the time during\nwhich I would start studying for college\nentrance exams I studied all the time\nI'm an Indian so it's harder here\neventually I looked at my future and I\nwas horrified nothing but working to\nlive the next day to then work for the\nnext and the worst part of all this is\nthat I'm one of the few who have it good\nI just can't imagine others poor\ncountries where people have to work even\nharder or War torn countries even the\ncountries which I felt would have been\nmy salvation like the United States seem\nto be getting crushed under inflation\nthere's nowhere to run from my fate no\nhope in the past it was even worse\nslavery was a thing slaves actually\nchose to live why why why did they\nchoose to live why do the Chinese who\nwork the entire day choose to live\nsomebody please tell me right now my\nlife is a bit on ease and but I can't\nimagine how I will cope with the idea of\nbeing alive once I get a job if I can\nget one I'll probably kill myself o\nthat's scary so please don't do that and\nyou know if y'all are having thoughts of\nsuicidality please go see a licensed\nprofessional or call Emergency Services\nbut let's start with this basic premise\nright like why on Earth should I live if\nlife is suffering hey y'all I want to\ntake a second to talk about HG coaching\nand y'all may be wondering oh my God bro\nlike I don't want to talk about coaching\nI just want to watch YouTube videos\nbecause there's a part of your brain\nthat recognizes that you need to do\nbetter in life but you don't actually\nwant to invest the time in energy you\njust want to sit there and watch another\nYouTube video which is exactly why I\ndeveloped a coaching program because I\nrealized the problem that we have today\nis not that we don't know what to do\nit's that we don't really understand how\nwe work and how to get ourselves to\nactually do things and the reason I\ndeveloped a coaching program is so that\n12 weeks from now you can actually have\nmade progress we've shown that people\nimprove in their sense of life purpose\nby about 58% and a 25 to 45% reduction\nin depression and anxiety the reason we\nmade a coaching program isn't because\nyou can't DIY it it's because if you\nwant to have made significant progress 3\nmonths from now you're going to need\nhelp doing it so if you're interested\ncheck out the link in the description\nbelow and if you're still not ready yet\ntotally fine that's why we literally\nhave 800 YouTube videos because for many\npeople it's about a SLO I wake up today\nI work really hard and I work really\nhard and then I go to go home I feed\nmyself and then I go to bed so that I\ncan have more energy to work tomorrow\nI'm in a highly competitive testing\nenvironment where everyone is cramming\nall the time and what's the point it\nsucks to cram I don't want to learn this\nstuff but I have to because my future\ndepends on it and this person even says\nso of us will try to cope with this\nreality of life is suffering and I can't\ncope anymore well yeah coping ain't\ngoing to work so if you all want to\nunderstand how do you live life if it is\nfundamentally suffering and why should\nwe do this the reason you should do it\nis because you can get better at it and\nthe reason that life is suffering is\nbecause you suck at living it I know\nthat sounds kind of not compassionate\nbut that's how it is let me give youall\na simple example I can throw some\nsomeone into a swimming pool and their\nexperience is I'm struggling to stay\nafloat oh my God this is awful I can\nbarely breathe I'm trying to cope with\nthe fact that I don't know how to swim\nand I'm in a body of water why on Earth\nshould I stay in this body of water this\nis awful yes you are correct being in a\nbody of water sucks if you don't know\nhow to swim and coping is not the answer\nthe basic problem is that we are not\ntaught how to swim in life we are not\ntaught how to live life because if all\nyour life is subsisting today so that\nyou can continue to subsist tomorrow\nthat ain't going to work now sometimes\nso let's start with a couple of Basics\nthe first is that we all have a core\nneed for survival and theoretically\nprocreation so this is a basic human\nDrive where if you look at a bacteria a\nbacteria is trying to to live to\nprocreate so we have this core reason to\nstay alive which is just because we're\ndesigned to right we prefer life over\ndeath as human beings as all animals as\nall living things they don't even need\nto be animals they strive to survive so\nwhat's happened in the past I don't know\n20 30 40 years is that the drive to\nsurvive is no longer sufficient to keep\nus in the game because life has started\nto suck so much this is where people\nwill say but Dr K what are you talking\nabout there's been so much advancement\nand I agree there's been a lot of\nadvancement and a lot of good stuff\nthat's happened think we're better off\ntoday than we used to be but we are\nswimming in different Waters and\nsurvival used to be sufficient because\nin some ways survival was easier and I\nknow it sounds kind of weird but like if\nyou look at hunter gatherer societies\nhow many hours a day do hunter gatherers\nwork they kind of work six maybe eight\nhours a day their life is pretty chill\nthey don't have to worry about mortgages\nat the end of the month they don't have\nto worry about oh my God if I get a B on\nthis test in my sixth month of\nUniversity how will it affect my job\nprospects 4 years from now so a couple\nof fundamental things have changed\nobjectively things in some ways are\nbetter for example people used to starve\nto death and some very unlucky people\nstill do but generally speaking obesity\ncauses more death than starvation does\nwhich is wild right think about that for\na second we have essentially won the\ngame of surviving life and we have won\nthe trophy of suffering as a result\nbecause survival used to be enough to\ndrive us used to be enough of a reason\nto do something because if we didn't do\nit we didn't eat and we didn't survive\nand so now the game has changed the main\nquest is different and now the very\nthings that we have been wired to do are\nthe things that harm us I love fatty\ncarbohydrate dense food as does every\nhuman being on the planet because that\nhelped us survive now that love kills\nyou literally so that which we were\nwired to do no longer works because the\nworld has changed and the world has\nchanged more rapidly over the last 30 or\n40 years because if we look at the rate\nof change in the world is increasing how\nmuch technological advancement happened\nbetween the years 430 CE and 600 CE not\nvery much what was the world like in\n1850 compared to what it is now\ncompletely transformed you could take a\nhuman being from the world in 1850 and\ndrop them into today and they would be\nso confused what is this guy doing he is\ntalking to an image of himself and there\nare these weird lights and he's like\ntalking as if he's interacting with\npeople but there's no one in the room so\nthe world has fundamentally changed and\nwe have not been taught how to live in\nit and you can't cope with this you just\nhave to learn how to live and so then\nthe question becomes how do you learn\nhow to live cuz they don't teach us that\nright so this is a core problem in the\npast our education was based on external\nthings because that's what we needed to\nsurvive this is how you farm this is how\nyou do mathematics this is how you read\nbut now we have tools that do all that\nstuff we have this thing called a\ncalculator we have programs that will do\nyour taxes for you we have audio books\nand we can look up anything at the drop\nof a hat right we can search anything on\nWikipedia and have all the information\nat our fingertips so our educational\nsystem has not kept up because now what\nwe need more than ever is to understand\nhow to live not be successful how to\nlive and so this is where spirituality\ncomes in because I think the most\nsuccessful study on how to live is what\nI would call spirituality so if you you\ndescribe different branches of knowledge\nso what is like mathematics what is\npsychology right so mathematics is the\nstudy of math or not study it's it's ma\nit's mathematics I guess mathology would\nbe the study of math but and in\nPsychology this is where we get another\nthing that's kind of tripped up so\npsychology is not about understand\nunderstanding yourself it is about\nunderstanding the external behavior of\nhumans how do human beings in general\nfunction right it's kind of like\neconomics it's not like there's a big\ndifference between personal finance and\neconomics economics is money on a big\nscale personal finance is personal it's\nmoney on a small scale and we even\ncalled the field I work in finance that\ndoesn't mean you do personal finance\nthat means you work in like banking\nright so we we add the word personal so\npersonal psychology is Spirit uality\nbecause if you go to get a degree in\nPsychology they're not going to teach\nyou how to wake up in the morning\nthey're not going to teach you how to\nfind motivation in your own life they\nliterally will not teach you that they\nwill teach you core psychological\nprinciples like pavlovian responses this\nis what we understand about human\nbehavior this is what we understand\nabout sadness not your sadness but\npeople's sadness so spirituality is the\ndiscipline of understanding yourself\nthat has nothing to do with God so even\nif you're an atheist this is why you\nshould engage in spirituality if you're\nreligious or an atheist both people\nshould engage in spirituality because\nspirituality is the study of the self\nthat's how I'm defining it now a lot of\npeople may say but hold on a second like\nisn't psychology and biology and\nwhatever sufficient I don't think so\nbecause learning about how human beings\ndevelop cravings and learning about the\nscience of digestion doesn't necessarily\nallow you to choose a salad instead of\nlike a fried whatever the [ __ ] and so\nthe basic problem if you're suffering\neveryday in life is that you haven't\nbeen taught how to live it and you\nhaven't asked the question what is the\nsource of my suffering and people will\nsay okay I have to work every day and\nstudying for this test is the source of\nmy suffering that's not the source of\nyour suffering your suffering comes from\nyour reaction to those circumstances\ndoes everyone who studies every day\nsuffer the answer is no in fact some\npeople love it and don't you wish you\nwere like them I study more on a daily\nbasis today than I did at any point in\nmy life prior to like the last two years\nso this is an example of something that\nI went through over the course of a\nmonth all right this is a gigantic pile\nof paper so studying isn't what causes\nsuffering it is your reaction to\nstudying and the number one reason that\npeople suffer is because they do things\nthat they should because your whole life\nyou've been taught that you should do\nthis and you should do this and you\nshould do this and you don't want to and\nso then what happens is there's\nsomething in here which doesn't want to\nand there's something out there telling\nyou to do something else and how do you\nreconcile to these two things you bury\nthis you bury a part of yourself you\nstop paying attention you numb out and\nwhat you are literally doing is burying\na part of you that strives for something\nand then we're confused why we suffer\nthe reason you suffer is because you're\nnot living your life you are living a\nlife that is prescribed by other people\nno wonder you suffer cuz you're not\nliving the life that you want you're\nliterally literally you're literally\nliving someone else's ideal idea of a\nlife and it's not even one person right\nit's some [ __ ] Franken steinan\namalgamation of what we should do\nbecause then you get in this educational\nsystem where the goal isn't even\nlearning anymore can you'all believe\nthat right and this person was from\nIndia so like I I'll tell youall just\nrandom tangent so I was looking at some\nstatistics the most successful companies\nin the world and I was really surprised\nbecause if you kind of look at like\ndeveloped Nations right the US and parts\nof Europe like Germany like China they\nhave these like awesome gigantic\nconglomerates that are doing like very\nrevolutionary and groundbreaking work\nand India is falling behind same amount\nof people as China roughly but Indian\ncompanies don't do as well on the global\nstage right and maybe that's incorrect\nI'm not trying to dis India but then I\nstarted to wonder why I was like wait a\nsecond like we're just as smart we're\njust as capable we have just as many\npeople we've got awesome colle and\ninstitutions why is there a per capita\ndisproportion in like the number of\nleading Indian companies and it's\nbecause of the way that we Foster\ncreativity or don't Foster creativity\nright learning is all about cramming\ncramming cramming cramming cramming\ninstead of actually learning it's about\nrot memorization and what we're also\nstarting to see is like these very or\nnot starting these have been there\nforever very hierarchical power\nstructures and as we as human beings\nstart living in in situations where you\nknow I I'm involved in a company and\nthere are people older than me who\nreport to me this is something that is\nvery common in the United States much\nrarer in India so the reason that we\nsuffer is because we're trying to exist\nin a world that demands other things of\nus and we quiet down our internal\nthoughts and we ignore them and then\nonce you disconnect from yourself of\ncourse life is going to be suffering\nbecause when life is good is when you're\nconnected with yourself when you get to\nfeel and be and do something right I was\ntalking to a patient of mine who is\nperpetually high on marijuana\nperpetually constant use of Edibles and\non top of that smokes throughout the day\nand I was talking to them about why do\nyou do this and they kind of told me\nthat like the more I talk to them the\nmore I realize that they feel connected\nto themselves when they're high they can\ntaste food better they can hear music\nbetter their social anxieties start to\ndisappear they stop worrying about the\noutside world and think about that for a\nsecond this person's s SCE of Happiness\ncontentment is about disconnecting from\nthe outside world and reconnecting to\nyourself This is the essence of\nspirituality so some people will use\ndrugs to do it you don't need to it can\nbe taught and so if you're suffering in\nlife because you're unhappy with your\nsituation do something else and this is\nwhere you will say I can't why not\nbecause because what because people will\nbe upset how will I be able to pay my\nrent how will I be able to do this how\nwill I be able to do this that's a good\nquestion question I don't know the\nanswer to that so if you don't know how\nto do something are you going to try and\nfigure it out or if you can't see the\nroad from A to Z are you never going to\ntake the first step and this is what\nhappens we are a society that is\nbecoming increasingly risk averse and\nwe're told follow this path follow this\npath follow this path and you'll be\nhappy you'll be happy you'll be happy\nyou'll be happy and then you ask the\nquestion when the answer is always the\nsame later when will you be happy when\nthe exam's are over I'm still not happy\nyet when you're done with school when\nyou get a good job you get a good job\nnow I just grind at work every day when\nyou're the boss even when you're the\nboss you're so stressed out all the time\nlater later later later later so\nspirituality is the practice of living\ntoday not about the future not about the\npast living today these are the core\nCentral tenants of spirituality number\none that happiness comes from within\npeople may think it comes from without\nbut this is the wild thing you may say\nbut no but my happiness comes from the\nenjoyment of external things okay so\nyall got to understand this that is\nwrong you'll say no but I like apples\nokay let me ask you a question where\ndoes the experience of liking happen\nliking apples happen where do you like\napples I like it in here do you all get\nthat no material object carries pleasure\npleasure comes from your reaction to an\nobject this fundamental thing we do not\nunderstand oh I love playing this video\ngame it's so much fun and on hour six I\ndon't know why the [ __ ] I play this\nvideo game it's not even fun the game is\nthe same game hasn't changed you had\nSmurfs on your team in game one you had\nSmurfs on the enemy team in Games 2 3 4\n5 and\nsix crazy thing there was never a Smurf\nyou just thought there was right cuz\nsurely when you're getting dumpstered\nit's because there's an enemy Smurf do y\nall see that so this is the key thing to\nunderstand all enjoyment comes from\nwithin literally you cannot enjoy\nsomething outside of yourself it's\nimpossible physically existentially you\ncannot enjoy something outside of\nyourself well no that's wrong I'm my my\nbrother or sister got married recently\nand I'm happy for them where do you\nexperience the happiness it's in here\nfirst tenant of spirituality joy and\nhappiness and suffering all come from in\nhere once you discover that a lot of\nthings start to change so now what you\ncan do is there are external events\nright studying for a test which then get\ntranslated into your internal being\nthere is a system of translation and\nthen you can modify that sum right so\nnow this is what things get really\ninteresting because how much can you\nmodify an external event to create a\ndifferential response within you so\nlet's start with 50/50 but honestly the\nanswer is close to 99 or even 100% you\ncan absolutely do that and people may be\nconfused about that but we actually know\nthis clinically so when we have someone\nwho is depressed and suicidal we know\nthat there are different kinds of coping\nmechanisms so the most basic kind of\ncoping mechanism which is not very\nhealthy in the long run is emotion\nfocused coping and what that means is\nwhen I feel something bad in here I'm\ngoing to do something to numb these\nemotions and make the Badness go away\ndoesn't help the most successful kind of\ncoping mechanism and by successful what\nI mean is leads to good outcomes for\npeople like objectively and subjectively\nso they feel better and they do better\ntop of the list is something called\ncognitive reframing and as therapists as\npsychiatrists we will literally go into\nour office for 7 hours a day and teach\npeople how to do this what does\ncognitive reframing mean does it mean\nfixing your problems no it means\nchanging the way that you think about\nthem it's not changing anything on the\nexternal it is changing on the internal\nthat process traditionally is what we\ncall spirituality so you can modify\nwhatever comes in and this is where I\nwill leave you with the most basic tool\nof spirituality the only thing that you\nneed which will get you all the way from\nzero to a thousand which is look within\nyourself all you need everything else is\na permutation or combination or fancy\nway of looking within yourself so if you\nare unhappy about studying what is it\nabout this that causes suffering within\nyou and what you'll discover usually is\nthat what causes suffering in you is the\nattachments to the thing the meaning\nthat your mind literally extracts from a\nbenign thing this is just a test I'm\nliterally studying mathematics that's\nall I'm doing 2 + 2 is 4 that's it but\nour mind attaches all this crap to it oh\nmy God if I get it wrong then I won't\nget a good job if I don't get a good job\nthen I won't get a good marriage if I\ndon't get a good marriage then I won't\nbe happy in life and so what happens is\n2 plus 2 equals 4 suddenly becomes your\nmind attaches meaning to it that you are\n[ __ ] if you get this question wrong\nbut that's literally incorrect like\nliterally that is not correct it is all\nof the rest it's a Hy hypothetical it's\nnot literal you all get that we attach\nall of these things we construct these\nthings in our mind and that's the root\nof our suffering how do we deconstruct\npay attention to your reactions because\nthat is those are the building blocks\nyour reactions to things what does this\nmean to me and as you look within\nyourself what you're going to be doing\nis the very opposite of where we started\nsomeone else is telling me I should do\nthis but I don't want to do this so I'm\ngoing to suppress this and I'm going to\nlean into whatever everybody else wants\nthat is the very opposite of looking\nwithin yourself in fact it is shutting\ndown your ability to see within yourself\nand this is the source of suffering now\nthis has nothing to do with God this is\nwhat spirituality is simply an the study\nof the self now people may Wonder but\nthen how the hell did this get\ncorrelated with spiritual religion and\nstuff in the first place for two reasons\nso the reason spirituality got\ncorrelated with religion is because when\npeople did this they discovered\nsomething like God so as people people\nstarted doing these meditative practices\nand looking within themselves they\nstarted activating parts of their brain\nin unusual ways so chances are what\nhappened is they started inducing high\nCO2 States within the brain normally\nwhat happens when you have a high CO2\nstate is you die but if you train\nYourself by like being in the Himalayas\nfor 15 years and slowly reducing your\nrespiratory rate until you can tolerate\nthrough sort of managing that lactic\nacidosis through metabolic means there's\na whole physiology behind it which your\nbody can ramp up so it is no longer\nlethal you start to create malfunctions\nin the brain that are not harmful and\nwhen you say malfunctions in the brain\nwhat do you mean what I mean is Visual\nand auditory hallucinations psychedelic\nexperiences but since these are not\ninduced by artificial drugs and you're\ntrained in in the ability to use your\nmind your mind is a very sharpened\nweapon that can cut through anything you\nare able to handle that spiritual\nexperience and you see some kind of\nconnection to some greater being and so\nthe original practitioners of\nspirituality became the source of\nreligion they were enlightened in some\nway they had some kinds of spiritual\nexperiences the second thing that\nhappened is that as people made\ndiscoveries they started passing these\ndown and that became codified into a\nreligion and Buddhism I think is the\nbest example of this where Buddha\nexplicitly did not start out to start a\nreligion you could make the same\nargument for someone like Jesus right\nI'm not an expert in Christian theology\nor history for that matter and so when\nthese people this is the second thing\nthat happened is when people started to\ndiscover the source of happiness and\nlose I like conquer suffering basically\nother human beings were like holy [ __ ]\nwhat did you figure out teach me how to\ndo that because you seem happy all the\ntime and you don't even have as much\nmoney as I do this person is different\nand so then they gravitate to that\nperson and then this person teaches them\nand this becomes codified into a set of\npractices that we then call religion and\nthen if you look at what goes wrong in\nreligion basic problem in religion is\nthat you've got someone who knows what\nthe [ __ ] they're talking about and then\nother people are like teach me bro or\nteach me girl and you're like all right\nand then you teach it to them and then\nthe original person dies the problem is\nthat unless there is a enlightened\nperson in the Next Generation someone\nstarts living by a script instead of\nactually understanding they start paring\nanswers and so there's a decay in\nknowledge and understanding which is how\nreligions go off track right you can\nmake an argument that a lot of religious\npeople nowadays don't even understand\nthe essence of the religion that they're\npracticing it's turned into something\nelse because without the spirituality\nreligion becomes a husk of codes of\nconduct without understanding and then\nwe get these really wild like\ncontradictions based on the roots of the\nreligion when someone is like yeah we're\nabout peace but I'm a kill you or we're\nabout compassion but [ __ ] you because\nthese people don't have the spirituality\nand so I don't think people sometimes\nget upset about religion and stuff I\ndon't think religion is bad or good just\nlike anything else in this world science\nisn't bad or good it's how we use it I\nthink the biggest problem with religion\nis that we've lost a lot of spirituality\n[Music]\nthere"
