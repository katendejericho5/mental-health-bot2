    "transcript": "so this frustration that I have with the\nfield of therapy and the sort of\nintroduction to coaching is literally\nwhy we started a coaching program it's\none of the things that I I got the most\nfrustrated about is that if you look at\ntherapists we do not take responsibility\nfor improving external things in\npeople's lives we absolutely take\nresponsibility for improving clinical\noutcomes like reducing feelings of\ndepression but therapists generally\nspeaking if you walk into an office and\nyou say hey can you help me accomplish\nthis in this amount of time most\ntherapists will shy away from that and\nthat's because that's not what what\nwe're trained for and this is why the\nfield of coaching is emerging so much\nit's because there's a whole ability to\nuse everything we understand about the\npsychology of the mind but point in a\ndifferent direction which is not healing\non the inside but accomplishing on the\noutside"
