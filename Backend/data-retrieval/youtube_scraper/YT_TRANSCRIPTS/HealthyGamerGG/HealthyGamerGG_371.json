    "transcript": "so if you say if I stream less maybe\nchat will think they can do something\nwith their lives but I mean like I know\nyou're influential misf but I I don't I\ndon't think the majority of your chat is\nheld back in life because they watch you\noh no no no I mean it smells like\nprojection where it's like if you can do\nsomething to save chat then you can kind\nof save yourself I mean I don't know why\nyou're so concerned about chat like why\ndon't I mean right so that that's what I\nmean is like you're not thinking about\nyour it's it's weird because like on the\none hand you're thinking about okay if I\nif I stream less then it will be good\nfor chat but what I'm wondering is like\nwhy can't you do something that's good\nfor you why does it have to why do you\nhave to think about what's good for chat\nwell it's more so like a both situation\nnow sure right so that's what makes it\neasy is when we convince ourselves that\nsomething is good for me and something\nis good for you that Dodges the guilt\nbecause now you're doing something\nthat's good for you that you want to do\nbut if you make it good for chat then\nyou don't have to feel guilty Dr K\nyou're supposed to be on my side with\nthis not their side what are you doing I\nam on your side"
