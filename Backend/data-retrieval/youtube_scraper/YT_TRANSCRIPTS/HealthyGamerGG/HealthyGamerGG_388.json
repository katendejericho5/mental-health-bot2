    "transcript": "so everyone's wondering why gen Z is so\nnihilistic and I see stuff like you know\nthese corporate CEOs who are like no one\nwants to work anymore and the kids don't\nthey don't have discipline and they\ndon't have no work ethic and everyone's\njust lazy and everyone's just like h no\none's chasing things and the reason that\nJen Z thinks that life has no meaning is\nbecause life has no meaning so if we\nreally stop and think about it in the\npast the meaning of life or what got us\nthrough our early years was this kind of\nscript that later on we will be happy\nright there was a sort of idea that if\nyou sit down and you work hard for a\nwhile eventually the good things will\ncome and the purpose of life is to have\nthe good things and so early on when\nwe're sort of like when our brains are\nyoung and we're still sort of forming\nwhat life is we would kind of go through\nstuff and we'd say like okay this is the\nprize over here there's the pot of gold\nat the end of the rainbow let me follow\nthe rainbow because eventually I'll be\nhappy"
