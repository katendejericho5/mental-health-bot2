    "transcript": "so sometimes in therapy we end up\nplateauing you've made some progress but\nat the end of the day you kind of start\nto stall and it seems like therapy isn't\nhelping as much but frequently what\nhappens is in a therapeutic relationship\nthere's this weird power Dynamic that\ndevelops and this therapist is here to\nhelp us become better so what's the\ntherapist job the therapist job is to\nhelp us and what's our job our job is to\nactually get better and if you stop\ngetting better you it can kind of feel\nlike it's your fault because the\ntherapist is there they're helping you\nand supporting you all the time and\nyou're just not doing enough to take\nthat help and turn it into progress so\noften times patients are very very\nhesitant to share that uh they're\nplateauing in therapy because they're\nafraid of disappointing their therapist\nright you're such a good person you're\nhelping me all the time and all I need\nto do is get better but it doesn't seem\nto be working"
