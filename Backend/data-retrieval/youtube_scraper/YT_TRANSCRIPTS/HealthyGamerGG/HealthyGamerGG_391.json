health content\non the internet free so today I'm going\nto share with you'all my experience not\nonly for my personal life but what I've\nseen as a psychiatrist where I've worked\nwith a lot of people who have a lot of\npotential so these can even be people\nlike 35-year-old who will say hey I'm 35\nI haven't accomplished anything in life\nis it too late for me to start or even\npeople who are very successful and are\naccomplished investment bankers or\ndoctors and are struggling because\nthere's just one part of their life\nwhich they continue to suck in and as\nI've worked with these people I've sort\nof discovered that there's this XP\ndebuff that they all carry with them\nthat there's something going on within\nyou that even though you try to make\nprogress and you do everything that\nyou're supposed to do or start to do\neverything that you're supposed to do\nsomething gets in the way and all of\nyour efforts get washed away that you\nstruggle with follow through and you\nhave nothing to show for it at the end\nof the day and so today we're going to\ntalk about how to cleanse that XP debuff\nto understand that even if you're 35 and\nyou have sort of stalled in life you can\nabsolutely catch up and you can\nabsolutely take on whatever you want to\ndo even if you're 30 and you've never\nbeen on a date on in your life you can\nactually fix that you can progress in a\nvery meaning F way because of all that\nstuff like the 10,000 hour rule the\nproblem though is that it's hard to\nengage in the 10,000 hour rule it's hard\nto follow through and this is the tricky\nthing anytime we try to apply the sage\nadvice of the internet there's something\nthat is Lost in Translation because\npeople out there it seems to be working\nfor them and everyone's talking about\nhow I did this and then there's a lot of\npeople who are talking about Drop\nShipping and side hustles and like I'm a\nside hustle here I'm a side side hustle\nthere I'm a side hustle off my side\nhustle I'm going to side hustle my way\nall the way around the planet I have a\nring of side hustles we're going to do\nthe Great Wall of side hustles and then\nI'm going to husten my way to into a\ncircle or some some like that and\nthen like you try to do that right\nbecause everyone's like oh yeah this is\ngoing to work man it's going to work and\nlike it doesn't work because something's\nmissing and that's what we're going to\ntalk about today so working as a\npsychiatrist I've learned that what's\nmissing is actually internal that even\nthough you can have the right answer out\nthere there's some critical pit pfalls\nwithin you that make it difficult or\neven impossible to apply the right\nlearnings the first of these pitfalls is\nthe desire to become the best and this\nis kind of interesting because isn't the\nwhole point isn't all don't all these\npeople say like if you want to be the\nbest you got to do this and you got to\nput in more time than everyone else\nthat's what everyone's saying and so\nlike you want to be the best right it\nturns out that wanting to be the best is\nstupid so the first thing to understand\nis that you can't be the best the best\nis an abstraction of the Mind in nature\nthere's no such thing as the best and if\nwe really look at it like what does the\nbest even mean does the best mean like\nin this group of people that you know\ndoes it mean in the history of humanity\ndoes it mean the people that you kind of\nsee on social media like how do you even\nmeasure the best it's all a sort of\npsychological construction and it turns\nout that being the best actually is\nrooted in insecurity so this is\nsomething that I'll I'll kind of share\nwith youall so when I was failing out of\ncollege right so I'd gotten a bunch of\nFS my first year when I started my\nsecond year I didn't think to myself\nokay the goal this year is to not fail\nevery class the goal was to get straight\nA's right because the moment that we\nfail we have to\novercompensate in order to balance our\nfailure so if I got straight FS I need a\n4.0 I need straight A's in order to have\nany chance of recovery I need to go from\nthe worst student to the best student\nbecause that's the only way I can fix\nthe problems of the past but now I've\nactually set myself up for failure\nbecause if I got straight FS I'm not\ngoing to get straight A's right and even\nif I get a B what do you think that's\ngoing to do to my motivation I started\nthis this year and I'm GNA I'm going to\nbe the best right like let's go son like\nand then I get a single B and then what\nhappens well screw it I got a single B\nnow I can't be the best and so you give\nit complete passion and hard work ethic\nfor one month and you get a single b or\nany other result yeah I'm going to learn\nlearn how to pick up women I'm going to\nlearn how to be the best girlfriend I'm\ngoing to be learn how to be the best\nboyfriend and then the moment that\nsomeone rejects me even a little bit I'm\nlike well screw that I'm not the best\nanymore so the crazy thing about being\nthe best is that it actually sabotages\nyour motivation it actually pushes you\nto give up because unless you hit your\ntarget which is going to be really hard\nif you're starting from straight FS\nyou're actually shooting yourself in the\nfoot and it's not going to work so the\nthe first thing that you've got to do is\nabandon being the best because being the\nbest is actually rooted in insecurity\nyour attempt to be the best is your\nattempt to actually fix the shame that\nyou feel and it turns out that if we\nmetabolize that shame if we kind of\nacknowledge that hey like I screwed up\nlet's focus on doing better that's the\nright attitude to actually end up as\nawesome and this is from someone who\nfailed out of college and then wound up\nat the top of my med school cohort and I\nlike won a couple of Awards in med\nschool right and the main thing is that\nI stopped trying to be the best I just\nfocused on learning the material so when\nyou are trying to get awesome at\nsomething and when you want to get\nreally good notice that thought of I\nwant to be the best and the more that\nyou notice that thought don't actually\nlean into it take a step back from it\ndon't do anything don't start out doing\nanything to be the best despite what all\nthe internet gurus tell you and I say\nthis as an internet Guru and I recognize\nthat's a little bit hypocritical okay so\ntake what I say with a grain of salt too\nthe reason that people struggle with\nfollow-through and really give up and\ncan't really be become awesome is\nbecause they have the wrong reasons now\nthis may sound kind of confusing because\nisn't this like oh my God like I'm\nentitled to my reasons I'm allowed to\nwant what I want no I mean sure you can\nwant all that crap but if you want to be\ngood at something you have to have\nscientifically the right reason and we\nknow from a ton of research that certain\nreasons lead to consistent Positive\nBehavior now this starts with a sort of\na problem with the word reason okay\nbecause reason is not one thing it's not\na reason reason's actually your discreet\nthings in your brain so the first kind\nof reason is a desire so a desire is an\nImpulse that you want to satisfy okay so\ndesires are born of the sensory organs\nif you want to play a particular video\ngame where did the desire to play that\nvideo game come from it came from seeing\nan advertisement or watching someone\nelse play it if you desire a hamburger\nbecause you're walking down the street\nand you smell a hamburger that's where\nthe desire for a hamburger comes from so\ndesires come from the senses okay that's\nthe first thing the second thing is that\ndesires are kind of like a lose lose\nsituation because if you do something\nand you satisfy the desire if the desire\nis the driving force and you satisfy the\ndesire then the motivation is going to\ndisappear because you're done you're\ndone right so I really want to eat a\nhamburger I eat a hamburger and then I\ndon't want to eat any more hamburgers\nI'm full like I'm done with the\nhamburger now the smell of a hamburger\nis actually a little bit disgusting so\nthat's the that's what we've got to be\nsuper careful about is that desires are\nactually like even if as we fulfill them\nwhich means as we make progress our\nmotivation actually decays and we end up\nnot becoming awesome because we kind of\ngive up CU eh we're sort of done right\nso good examples of this are like I'm\ngoing to learn how to play an instrument\nI'm going to learn H it's too hard\nthat's the other thing is that if a\ndesire does not get satisfied in a\ncertain amount of time there's a part of\nyour brain that calculates whether\nsomething is worth the effort and if the\nSAT desire isn't satisfied your brain\nwill tell you to give up because your\nbrain sort of has this expected value of\nwhat we're going to get and it sort of\nhas this idea of effort and if the\neffort is not worth the value it'll\nactually like cancel your motivation\nit'll be like yeah this is not worth it\nright so if I buy a guitar and it's like\nyeah I saw someone else being such a\nmega Chad playing guitar oh my God they\nwere so amazing everyone loved them so\nmuch I'mma learn how to do that and you\npick up the guitar and you're like this\nhurts my fingers oh my God it hurts my\nfingers and then your brain is like this\nis not worth it so whether you satisfy\nit it's going to be gone or if you don't\nsatisfy it and it's too hard it's going\nto be gone so either way we don't want\nto use desire as a reason second reason\nthat is bad is actually not a reason at\nall it's emotion so if we are driven\ntowards a behavior due to an emotion\nlike let's say that I am lonely and I\nuse that loneliness as fuel to connect\nwith other people that is not going to\nbe a sustainable way to do things\nbecause as I'm lonely a couple of things\nwill happen the first is that I may run\ninto other negative emotions and then it\nbecomes a battle of emotion\nso then like I'm lonely so let me leave\nthe house and then uhoh here's social\nanxiety you forgot about me because you\nwere all alone in your house but here I\nam now that we're interacting with other\npeople I'm going to tell you you're\ndoing a terrible job and make you feel\nbad about yourself and then what happens\nis since you gave into the emotion as\nyour motivation you are vulnerable to\nother kinds of emotions taking away that\nmotivation the other really interesting\nthing if we just look at the brain and\nalso the yogis kind of figured this out\nis that emotion fluctuate right like\nthis is what's kind of interesting but\nyou know if you if you had an awesome\n13th birthday party it's not like you're\nhappy for the rest of your life and the\ngood news is if you if someone dumps you\nand you feel heartbroken there's a good\nchance that you won't be heartbroken for\nthe rest of your life right emotions\nactually fluctuate and they come and go\nand there's a part of our brain called\nthe lyic system which actually tries to\nequilibri emotions so there's this\nprinciple of homeostasis where you know\nis is as we feel a ton of emotion our\nbrain will actually start turning on\ncircuits to tone down the emotion and\nthis is why like when you get angry\nright you get really really angry at the\nbeginning and then slowly over time the\nanger kind of decreases so we don't want\nto use emotion as a reason to actually\nget good at something because the\nemotion will will actually disappear\nover time so now we get to what is a\ngood reason and what we really want to\nfocus on is values so values are things\nthat you care about they're not design\nthey're not things that you want they're\nthings that you care about and they're\nnot emotions they're things that you as\na human being say this is important to\nme and there's one really interesting\nscientific difference with values is\nthat when we start operating in relation\nto our values we can tolerate negativity\nso working as an addiction psychiatrist\nwhen I sort of like try to get people to\nquit stuff right like let's say heroin\nand heroin withrawal is like bad man\nhopefully you've never experienced it\nbut you actually want to die like most\nvery common experience experience that\nI've had with most of my patients that\nthey become suicidal when they're going\nthrough herin withdrawal they're like I\nwould rather be dead than go through\nthis you've got diarrhea every part of\nyou aches and hurts because your pain\nsensors have been so numbed by heroin\nthat when the heroin goes away they go\nthrough withdrawal and withdrawal for a\npain sensor means inflicting physical\npain on you so you just feel a ton of\npain you feel terrible your nose is\nrunning it's all kinds of just mess\nright and so if you sort of think about\nhow does a human being get through that\nhow does a human being stick with it\nthey have to have something that they\ncare about enough to tolerate that\nnegativity so if you want to get good at\nsomething instead of just getting\nexcited because you saw someone else do\nit or instead of just doing it because\nyou feel like doing it the first thing\nyou should do is really ask yourself\nwhat about this is important to me and\nspend some time actually introspecting\nor even write it out and there are a\ncouple of really interesting ways that\nyou can apply it so start with\nintrospection and the second thing that\nthat I want you all to do is when you\nstart doing the task there are going to\nbe times where you don't want to do it\nand then ask yourself two questions\nquestion number one is what is more\nimportant to me right now is it more\nimportant to actually go out and try to\nmake friends because this is what I care\nabout or is it more important to me to\ngive into the social anxiety and not put\nmyself through the discomfort and the\nsecond thing that you can ask yourself\nis tomorrow which choice will lead to\nPride and Which choice will lead to\nregret and really stop and ask yourself\ntake a deep breath and ask yourself\nwhich of these will lead to Pride and\nwhich of these will lead to regret and\nthen give yourself the option to say\nokay you know what I want to be proud of\nmyself tomorrow that's important to me\nmaking progress is important to me and\nas you actually move in that direction\nyou'll discover that leaning towards\nyour values allows you to actually make\nconsistent progress towards something\nthe next thing that I want you all to do\nis to use your infantile and pathetic\nacknowledge that you've gained from a\ntiny amount of progress as soon as\npossible so if we look at why do we not\ncontinue to progress towards things one\nof the main reasons is because this idea\nof delayed gratification so some human\nbeings are born with high\nconscientiousness which means that they\ncan delay gratification for a long\nperiod of time and then they can\ncontinue to invest effort but if you're\nlike me and if you're like most human\nbeings you need to see some kind of\nreturn in order to continue you being\nmotivated and progressing towards a goal\nnow the problem is that when we're\nlearning something from the for the\nfirst time we don't feel confident in\nsharing it or using it and so as a\nresult if you kind of stop and think\nabout it what does that what does that\ndo right so I'm investing let's say a\nyear of my life learning this particular\ndegree right so I'm let's say I want to\nbecome an electrical engineer and I\nspent one year of my life learning this\nstuff but I don't use it so all my brain\nsees in that moment is the cost of one\nyear of suffering with no gain and then\nyear two rolls around and now you spent\ntwo years learning this crap but you\nstill don't see any benefit from it 3\nyears go by and at this point you're\nburnt out because you've pushed yourself\nyou've exhausted your reserves of\nwillpower and you still haven't seen\nanything for it and now you start to do\nworse you have less energy you're\ngetting seiz you're skipping class you\ncan't focus right and so things start to\nfall apart and this has been my\nexperience with so many of my patients\nwhich is that start to fall apart so how\ncan you prevent that use your infantile\nand pathetic knowledge as quickly as\nhumanly possible okay so what does that\nmean that means that even as a first\nyear as you go into your second year\nstart tutoring first years right because\nyou've actually learned something even\nthough you're only 25% into your 4-year\ndegree you've actually made 25% of the\nprogress you're 25% of the way done\nthat's really awesome the problem is\nthat the way that we structure progress\nwe don't actually try to learn apply our\nlearning ings very early on right we\nthink that I have to be at the end of\nsomething I got to be perfect I got to\nbe the best and then I can unleash\nmyself upon the world I would be so\namazing oh my God then everyone would\nlove me and if I were to start to share\nwhat I've learned or try to teach people\nor try to apply it in some way then it's\ngoing to be embarrassing and I won't be\nthe best so I can't do that but we\nreally shoot ourselves in the foot by\nsort of adopting this approach because\nwhen we do this we actually don't open\nourselves up to the chance for\nBehavioral reinforcement to kick in\nright anything that you want to learn\nhow to do try to get some advantage of\nout of it as quickly as possible so if\nyou're playing a if you're learning how\nto play a musical instrument try to play\nit in front of someone else even if it\nkind of sounds pathetic but you can like\nyou can work on some of it right you can\nplay like 30 seconds decently and it\nsounds like a song just go to someone\nand say hey can you guess what this song\nis and play 30 Seconds of it they know\nyou're new you're you know you're new\nyou don't have to be the best no one's\nexpecting you to be perfect and yet we\nfeel so embarrassed that we don't give\nourselves the opportunity for positive\nreinforcement and then we wonder why we\ngive up why we don't follow through the\nlast thing that I'm going to tell you\nabout is a very very subtle but\nimportant Pitfall so if you want to get\nawesome at anything in your life it's\ngoing to take effort it's going to take\nwork and Malcolm Gladwell wasn't wrong\nthat it sort of takes 10,000 hours to\nbecome an expert fine but that's not\nactually the problem right the problem\nis that we can take this abstract\nconcept of this will make me awesome but\nwhen we download that concept into a\nhuman being we open ourselves up to all\nof the flaws of a human being and in my\nwork as a psychiatrist the most wasted\npotential I've seen because you know\nyou're capable is when we let this human\nelement get in the way whether this is\nworking with a professional Esports\nathlete or it's working with someone\nwho's a doctor or it's working with\nsomeone who's 40 years old and hasn't\nreally done anything in life it's all\nthe same at the end of the day all of\nthese people whether a doctor engineer\npainter you are a part of your equation\nfor Success your life you can learn as\nmuch stuff as you want to you can read\nas many books and you can figure out as\nmany productivity tips and you can take\nas many supplements as you want to but\nat the end of the day you are a part of\nthe equation and the number one thing\nthat holds you back from being awesome\nis actually yourself so look for these\npitfalls avoid them at all costs\nrecognize sort of dig into yourself and\nyou will be awesome at anything you want\nto in a very short amount of time so\nthere are often times formulas and right\nanswers to being awesome right something\nlike the 10,000 hour rule where even if\nyou look at residency training it's\nabout 10,000 hours that's how long it\ntakes to become a psychiatrist so\nthere's a lot of value to these rules\nand even you can take things like\nsupplements or you can meditate or\nwhatever everyone has these formulas for\nbeing awesome kind of figured out the\nproblem though is that if the formula\nworks why isn't everyone awesome and\nthat's because as you translate the\nformula into a human being the human\nelement enters and so the crazy thing is\nthe really the most important thing that\nis keeping you from being awesome is\nyourself and so the better you\nunderstand these pitfalls the more that\nyou learn to move maneuver around them\nthe more awesome you'll\nget"
