    "transcript": "and I know it sounds weird but when\npeople are going through a war this is\nwhere everyone who has it worse than you\nneeds you to be the best that you can so\nthat you can help them right if someone\nis like drowning if you can stand on\nfirm footing and hold them that's way\neasier that's a way better chance to\nhelp another human being than if you're\ntreading water right when my feet are\nfirmly planted on the ground I can hold\nsomeone up but when I'm treading water\nit's so much harder to help another\nhuman being and so this is where I'd say\nlike you should prioritize your Str\nI'm not saying that you should do it to\nthe exclusion of helping other people\nbut this is where I want you to\nunderstand that you have a\nresponsibility to the rest of humanity\nto get your in order because like\nwe need you the human race needs you so\nget your in order as quickly as you\ncan you don't need to be ashamed about\nit you shouldn't invalidate it and at\nthe same time like you need to get it\ntaken care of"
