    "transcript": "there's a serious problem in the field\nof therapy and that problem is that\nsometimes self-love and self-compassion\nnot only doesn't work but can actually\nbe\nharmful finding a good therapist in La\nis so damn hard everyone's practice\nseems to be based on self-love self\nforgiveness and\nself-affirmation swear to God I wish\nthere was something like a Marine Corps\nboot camp for fat lonely men I don't\nneed to live in a bubble of stupid\naphorisms I need someone to kick my ass\nabsolutely I had two reactions when I\nread this the first is an internal\nfrustration with the field of therapy\nand this sort of like idea that\nself-compassion and self-love is the end\nall Beall of what we're trying to do in\ntherapy and in my experience not only\ndoes it not work some of the times in\nsome cases it's actually harmful and the\nsecond thing that happened is I got\ncurious about boot camp in the military\nand I remember that that like I've done\na lot of veterans work and when I talk\nto Veterans one of the most interesting\nthings is that almost all of them think\nabout boot camp as a very positive\nexperience I've had a ton of patients\nwho went to boot camp and transformed\ntheir life and so I started to\ninvestigate what happens psychologically\nin boot camp what happens that makes\npeople confident and resilient and I\nactually discovered a couple of really\ninteresting things and we're going to\nteach you how to implement the most\nimportant aspect of boot camp psychology\nin today's video so we're going to start\nwith baby Dr k When I was a tiny little\nbitty in tune at the Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital I had a lecture on\nPsychotherapy and in walked someone who\nis a professor of Psychiatry at Harvard\nMedical School who then asked me a\nquestion if a patient walks into your\noffice and says doctor can you help me\nfind a girlfriend or boyfriend what are\nyou supposed to say and my dumbass is\nlike yes this is what we do in therapy\nwe help people accomplish their goals\nand it turns out that I was wrong and\nthat in therapy we do not help people\naccomplish their goals the right thing\nto say when someone walks in and says\nhey can you help me find a girlfriend\nthe right thing to say is not to say\nanything not to answer the question cuz\nheaven forbid as a psychiatrist you\nanswer a patient's question instead you\nhave to turn it into a question invite\ncuriosity what is it that makes you want\na girlfriend how do you feel about not\nhaving a girlfriend why do you think it\nis that you haven't been able to find a\ngirlfriend what's going on tell me about\nyour feelings let's talk let's talk some\nmore let's talk some even even more and\nthis is what I found incredibly\nfrustrating as a therapist is that we're\na profession of people who don't really\nfocus on the outcomes of our patients I\nknow it sounds kind of paradoxical and\nif you're a therapist out there and you\ntake offense to that there's a good\nreason that you will and we'll get to\nthat in a second but if we sort of look\nat the profession we're a profession\nthat will do therapy with people for 20\nyears and we'll keep on talking about\nfeelings talking about feelings talking\nabout feelings and then like it's not\nclear to me what the patient gets out of\nthat and so there are a couple of things\nthat we have to say kind of in defense\nof therapy because it's not all bad and\nit's actually really good the first is\nif this is so bad like why does everyone\nfocus on self- Lov and self-compassion\nand this is what's really important to\nunderstand is that for about half of\npatience\nthe single most revolutionary thing you\ncan do for them is to teach them self\nlove so I think the reason that we're\nbiased this way as the field of therapy\nis because for half of the people if we\ncan teach them self-compassion all of\ntheir problems will be fixed and that's\nkind of the goal of therapy right that's\nthe approach is that like the problem\nisn't that you you lack knowledge to\nsolve this particular thing the problem\nis that there's something inside you\nthat as as long as it's broken and isn't\nreally functioning properly you can try\nto go on fixing things out there and\nit'll never work and that's a really\nvalid approach like literally in my\npractice I'd say like the most\ntransformative thing is teaching people\nself-love but for half the people the\nreal problem is that for the other half\nit doesn't seem to work because not\neveryone is traumatized and not everyone\nsort of needs more self-love and\nself-compassion and in fact for half the\npeople that walk into my office if I\ntell them hey bro you need more\nself-love they hate it because the these\nare people and you may be one of them\nthat don't deserve self-love you don't\ndeserve compassion because you suck at\nlife right and like I'm not here to\nteach myself how to love this pathetic\nversion of me this is not what I'm\ninterested in I actually don't want to\nlove this person give yourself love to\nsomeone who deserves it what I actually\nwant to do is create a life that I can\nbe proud of something where I deserve\nlove in confidence and and like all all\nthat good stuff is like appropriate and\nif people come into our office that way\nunfortunately a lot of my colleagues\nwill be like n n you need to self\nlove you are deserving of love you're\nnot pathetic like love yourself love\nyourself and that can actually be\ndamaging in a couple of ways the first\nis that it's incredibly invalidating\nbecause your patient is coming in and\nthey have a fire to transform their\nlives and here you are telling them no\nno no let's shut off the fire which\nbrings us to the second thing which is\nthat let's remember that negative\nemotions are drivers for positive change\nso if I get angry at someone because\nthey steal from me instead of like\nprocessing that anger with a therapist I\ncan use that anger to set boundaries\nwith them and block them right the other\nthing is if we look at emotions like\nguilt and shame like we can go into a\ntherapist's office and we can metabolize\nthem with the therapist but why do we\nfeel guilt we feel guilt because\nsometimes we do the wrong things and\nguilt is an emotion that helps us do the\nright thing that's how we know the\ndifference between right and wrong if we\ndidn't have guilt we wouldn't have an\ninternal moral compass and so this is\nthe real problem I think with a lot of\nthis self-love approach to therapy is\nthat we forget that like not loving\nyourself can be a really really good\nmotivator and this is where we kind of\ncome to a really important part of like\nthe alternate way okay so if we're not\ngoing to do self Lov which can\nabsolutely be very very positive but for\nsome people it doesn't work and for\nthose people and if you're one of these\npeople let's remember that there are two\nways that you can deal with emotions so\nwhen I'm a human in the world the world\nwill do stuff to me and when the world\ndoes stuff to me I will feel things and\nthen I've got two options to deal with\nthese feelings I can either process them\ninternally or I can change the\ncircumstance es that make me feel a\nparticular way all right so here's an\nexample let's say that I go to the beach\nand when I go to the beach I feel a\nlittle bit embarrassed about the way\nthat I look and so I've got two options\nin this situation one is that I can go\nand talk about my feelings which can be\nreally effective right so let's say I'm\ngoing there with my partner my friends\nand I voice to them hey I'm feeling a\nlittle bit embarrassed and they're like\nlook man it's totally cool like you're a\nsexy beast like look at you you're so\nsexy oh my God you're so sex sexy right\nor that hey like no one really cares and\nwe're here to have fun and like they can\ngive you some reassurance they can give\nyou a little bit of TLC yeah you can\nfeel a little bit embarrassed but you\ncan work on it internally the other\nthing that you can do if you feel\nembarrassed about the way that you look\nis you can exercise and you can change\nyour diet you can actually transform the\ncircumstances that make you feel a\nparticular way now this is the big\nproblem with therapy is that generally\nspeaking in therapy we don't really\nfocus on the latter there are some\nabsolutely great clinicians who do focus\non that we can look at evidence-based\ntechniques like motivational\ninterviewing that are really designed\naround behavioral change and stuff like\nthat but generally speaking most\ntherapists therapists don't specialize\nin changing external behavior and when I\nwas sort of super interested in this at\nthis place called mlan hospital I talked\nto the chief of Psychiatry there and I\nwas like how do we actually get patients\nto change their lives and that's when he\ntold me he was like hey you should check\nout this place called The Institute of\ncoaching which is all about creating EX\nexternal change for our patients as\nopposed to using psychotherapeutic\nmodels to heal the pathology so it's\nsuper cool and I looked into it and I\nreally found that it was a good fit so\nlet's remember that when it comes to us\nfeeling a particular way and like if\nyou're ashamed of who you are or how you\nlook or how much money you make there's\nactually a whole different way to manage\nthose emotions which is to actually fix\nthe crap in your life that makes you\nfeel that way it's not just about\nmetabolizing that that emotion and this\nis what happens is if we start to focus\nentirely on emotions then what starts to\nhappen is sometimes we can stall so I\nhad a patient for example who was like\nin the the clinic that I was working at\nfor 20 years and they kept on getting\npassed on from one resident to another\nResident to another Resident and so\nthere's a you know one argument to be\nmade there is like maybe they should\nhave worked with someone who's not a\ntraining psychiatrist and worked with a\na real psychiatrist who's fully trained\nand that could have helped them they'\ndone that too but I think the bigger\nproblem is that this person kind of came\ninto my office and was like you know I'm\nreally unhappy with my life I'm\ndepressed all the time I'm like why are\nyou depressed well you know I'm\ndepressed because of this this and we\ntalk about feelings talk about feelings\ntalk about feelings and then I asked\nthem you know are there times in your\nlife when you haven't felt depressed and\nthey were like yeah I was dating this\nperson once who like you know had a\nreally nice car and we'd Drive somewhat\nrecklessly and then we'd have really\nwild sex and it made me feel like James\nBond and so like I did what I was\nsupposed to do right cuz I I heard the\nprofessor of Psychiatry who came in and\ntell me no never never change a\npatient's life just talk about their\nfeelings and so I was like okay well you\nknow like let's just talk about your\nfeelings and what feels so great about\nhaving James Bond sex and towards the\nend of our therapy like you know I\nstarted to get frustrated with that they\nstarted to get frustrated that we've\nbeen doing that for a couple years and I\nwas like bro do you want to change your\nlife and he's like yeah and then we\nstarted working on that and we made huge\nprogress and so if we kind of look at\nthis externalizing approach to our\nemotions which generally speaking is bad\nso for example if we look at a lot of\nwhat gets men into trouble it is that\nthis is the only strategy they have so\nif someone makes me feel a particular\nway I'm going to change my circumstances\nso that they no longer make me feel that\nway this opens the door to things like\nemotional manipulation this opens up\nthis is how bosses will kind of squeeze\ntheir employees because they make you\nfeel guilty and if they can make you\nfeel guilty they can shape your behavior\nand if they can shape your behavior to\nmake you feel less guilty now they can\ncontrol your behavior by controlling\nyour emotions and so a big part of very\nsuccessful therapy is actually helping\npeople get away from this this sort of\napproach of let me fix the outside world\nto make myself feel a different way on\nthe flip side though sometimes we\nactually want to use that and this is\nwhere I got kind of curious about\nmilitary recruit recs and like let's\nremember that military recruits will\noften times join the military because\nthey're unhappy with their lives and\nthey're depressed and they're not going\nanywhere and then after serving some\nperiod of time in the military like\nsometimes there are cases of trauma and\nsexual assault and things like that I've\nseen that working with veterans but\nactually I would say the majority of\npatients I work with really appreciate\nbeing in the military they learned so\nmuch and they developed so much\nconfidence and what's going on there how\nis it that the military can be so\novertly abusive right you've got a drill\nsergeant who's telling you hey you suck\nyou're going to fail and yet you come\nout of that experience feeling stronger\ndoes a swift kick in the ass actually\nwork and if it works what is the\nunderlying psychological principle at\nplay so let's actually look at research\non the psychology of people who go to\nboot camp so there are a couple of\nreally interesting aspects to it the\nfirst is that while they are verbally\nabusive which is bad right they actually\nare implicitly very very like invested\nin you and don't give up on you I think\nthis Paradox is really important to\nunderstand so if you go to if you\nactually join the military there will be\ndrill sergeants and I went to a military\nschool for a little while so I have a\nlittle bit of personal experience who\nwill tell you that you're going to fail\nout you're pathetic you're never going\nto make it you're never going to make it\nyou're going to fail you're going to\nfail you're so pathetic but they never\nkick you out right they sort of teach\nyou one really important principle which\nis that even though I'm telling you\nyou're going to fail I'm not actually\ngoing to kick you out ever ever you can\nfail today and I'm going to be here\ntomorrow you can fail tomorrow and I'm\ngoing to be here the next day no matter\nhow many times you\nfail what determines whether you succeed\nor fail here is actually you you can\nquit whenever you you're ready and you\nshould have quit a week ago you should\nquit today and you should quit tomorrow\nbut until you quit I will actually like\ncontinue to be here for you and this is\na really fascinating kind of perspective\nand there's actually research on on this\nwhere this is also kind of a masculine\nsort of thing so if we look at men we do\nsomething called the negative expression\nof a positive affection so when my when\nI started dating the person who was\ngoing to be my wife like my friends were\nhappy for me but they could not keep\nthey could not stop giving me about\nit right they were technically they were\nhappy they were like and I could tell\nthey were happy they're like oh my God\nAlo you're so whipped BR you're so\nwhipped bro you're so whipped you're so\npathetic like oh my God like oh did you\ngo to Victoria Secret and buy some\nlingerie for yourself because your ass\nis whipped and this is what we do to\neach other as men when we are proud of\neach other we actually express it in a\nnegative way so it is the negative\nexpression of a positive affection and\nit turns out that this is actually\nuseful in a couple of ways so if you\nhave some degree of self-loathing or\nhate yourself if you sort of have this\nnegative expression it can be very\nvalidating right because someone else is\ntelling you like yeah man like I can see\nthat you were a loser like you you\ntechnically correct I can see that what\nare you going to do about it so this is\nthe really important thing that we sort\nof discover from the the psychology of\nmilitary recruits is that negatively\nexpressing stuff is okay as long as\nthere's Faith underneath that like you\nwill make it in the end and what we\nactually discover is that what boot camp\ndoes to people people is it improves\nthis psychological concept called grit\nand grit is the very opposite of like\nall this self-love and self-compassion\nstuff so in 2007 there was a a\npsychologist named Angela Duckworth who\ndiscovered this concept called grit\nwhich is sort of like this personality\ncharacteristic which is like people\ndon't give up it's not self-love it's\nnot self-compassion it's not like res\nit's related to resilience actually is\nthe closest thing but she basically\nnoticed that some people like quit when\nthings go bad and other people like\nstick with it and if you really look at\nlike boot camp what does boot camp do it\nboosts grit hey there thanks for\nwatching and I'm glad these videos have\nbeen helpful a lot of times I'll read\nthe comments and see people asking well\nwhat do I actually do about it which is\na great question and unfortunately the\nresources out there haven't been that\ngreat which is precisely why I started\nHG in the first place HG coaches are\ntrained on a curriculum that integrates\nmy understanding of what motivates us\nwhat paralyzes us and most importantly\nwhat leads to Lasting behavioral change\nif you're ready to take the next step HG\ncoaches can help you build the life that\nyou want they've helped people build\ncareers help people find relationships\nbuild networks of friends and even do\nthings like discover their passions or\npursue Hobbies so if this sounds like\nsomething that you'd be interested in\ncheck out the link in the description\nbelow and so there's an alternative to\ngoing down the route of self- Lov and if\nyou're someone who gets incredibly\nfrustrated by like I don't want to love\nmyself I don't deserve to love myself I\nactually want to make something of my\nlife you don't need to force yourself\ninto doing something that feels\nunnatural instead what you need to focus\non is building grit and building grit is\nabout not about doing it or\naccomplishing because let's remember if\nyou lack confidence you can't accomplish\nanything instead building grit is just\nabout not giving up and so if you were\nable to make this cognitive reframe and\ninstead of focusing on even succeeding\nwhat you really need to focus on is I'm\ngoing to keep trying and I'm not going\nto give up no matter what and and if\nyou're able to do that this is going to\nbe the alternate path to transform your\nlife so that if you can shape the\ncircumstances around you by not giving\nup then you will deservedly feel love\nand pride and confidence for what you've\naccomplished so this frustration that I\nhave with the field of therapy and the\nsort of introduction to coaching is\nliterally why we started a coaching\nprogram it's one of the things that I I\ngot the most frustrated about is that if\nyou look at therapists we do not take\nresponsibility\nfor improving external things in\npeople's lives we absolutely take\nresponsibility for improving clinical\noutcomes like reducing feelings of\ndepression but therapists generally\nspeaking if you walk into an office and\nyou say hey can you help me accomplish\nthis in this amount of time most\ntherapists will shy away from that and\nthat's because that's not what what\nwe're trained for and this is why the\nfield of coaching is emerging so much\nit's because there's a whole ability to\nuse everything we understand about the\npsychology of the mind but point in a\ndifferent direction which is not healing\non the inside but accomplishing on the\noutside so hopefully this has been a\nhelpful video for yall I'm with you in\nterms of like I don't really care much\nfor the self-compassion and self-love\nit's not how I put together my life I\ndecided to walk this other path of let\nme understand myself and then craft a\nlife that is worth living and if yall\nwant to do that the most important place\nto start is with the development of\n[Music]\ngrit"
