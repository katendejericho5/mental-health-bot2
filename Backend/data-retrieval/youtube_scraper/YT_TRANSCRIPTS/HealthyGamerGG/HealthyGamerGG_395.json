    "transcript": "and this is what's really interesting\nabout ADHD is that once you screw up you\nactually perform better so if we look at\nthe brains of people with ADHD their\nability to adapt to chaotic\ncircumstances is actually Superior to\nneurotypical people this is a\ncompetitive advantage that if you're\nplaced in sort of a chaotic environment\nwhere there's a lot of external stimuli\nthat are pressuring you to do things\nthat's when you actually do your best\nyou can't study for a test that's a\nmonth away but when you forget that oh\nmy god I've got a test tomorrow in its\nlast minute Panic that's when ADHD kids\nactually rise to the challenge and so\nthis is where most of y'all learn a\nreally interesting adaptation which is\nthat okay so if I'm going to screw up\nanyway I might as well screw up now I\nmight as well create an environment of\nchaos because as someone with ADHD\nyou're really good at damage control but\nyou're really bad at damage prevention\nyou're really bad at preventing problems\nand making sure everything goes okay but\nyou're actually pretty good at piecing\nthings together"
