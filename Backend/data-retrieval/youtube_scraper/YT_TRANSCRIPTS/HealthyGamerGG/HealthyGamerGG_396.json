    "transcript": "if you take a a person that is\nunderachieving at school and then they\nbecome more introspective\nself-reflective and get a greater\nunderstanding of themselves it's harder\nto imag or it's hard to imagine that\ntheir life doesn't also significantly\nimprove in other ways because my my\nguess would probably be that those\npeople that are in those bad situations\nare probably more inhibited than an\naverage person when it comes to those\nintrospective things so opening that up\nwould help them probably that's a that's\na brilliant assumption that you're\nmaking because that's like literally\nthat's what happened in my case what we\nsee a lot right so if we think about\nwhat is the effect on a human being of a\nbad situation it hurts and then our\ninstinctive response when something\nhurts is to numb it cuz we haven't been\ntaught how to fix it so then we ignore\nit and then what we actually see is\npeople in bad situations are more\nintrospectively blind I don't think\nthat's an evidence-based statement but\nthat's my opinion"
