    "transcript": "chances are if you've got ADHD you're\noverwhelmed and despite your best\nefforts at organizing things planning\nthings trying to keep things under\ncontrol you always find yourself in a\nlife full of chaos and today we're going\nto learn how to break free of\nthat the real curse of ADHD isn't the\nfact that your frontal loes are a little\nbit different that you struggle with\nattention or impulsivity or you can't\nfocus the real curse of ADHD is that you\nhave intact parts of your brain that\nyou're actually not using because of the\nway that you adapt to your ADHD so this\nall starts with you being a kid and when\nyou're growing up as a kid with ADHD you\nquickly learn that your brain is\ndifferent so you quickly learn that\nwhile things are easy for other people\nyou struggle with them and that despite\nyour best efforts everything that you\ntry ends up falling apart in some way\nand then something really interesting\nhappens when you start to fear that\nthings are going to fall apart then you\nactually can't focus on the task at hand\nso if I'm trying to let's say paint a\npicture but I know that I'm going to get\ndistracted and then I'll screw up the\npicture then a lot of my cognitive\nenergy is thinking about don't screw up\ndon't screw up don't screw up and the\nmore that you start thinking about not\nscrewing up the more likely you are to\nscrew up because you're not focused on\nthe task at hand it's a little bit like\ntrying to force yourself to fall asleep\noh my God I need to sleep I need to\nsleep I need to sleep oh my God it's\ngetting so late I'm going to be so tired\ntomorrow and what ends up happening the\nfact that you're trying so hard to fall\nasleep actually keeps you awake and so\nthis is exactly what happens to you if\nyou've got ADHD as you start to realize\nI'm going to screw up and then you start\nto focus on not screwing up but despite\nyour best efforts you will end up\nscrewing up because that's what happens\nif you're a neurode Divergent kid in a\nneurotypical world and then as this\nhappens over and over and over again you\nstart to recognize that screwing up is\ninevitable you've got two options either\nyou can try really hard to do it right\nand end up screwing up anyway or you can\njust kind of screw up right now and\nmentally Free Yourself of the stress\nbecause if you're going to screw up\neventually why bother stressing out\nabout it and this is what's really\ninteresting about ADHD is that once you\nscrew up you actually perform better so\nif we look at the brains of people with\nADHD their ability to adapt to chaotic\ncircumstances is actually Superior to\nneurotypical people this is a\ncompetitive advantage that if you're\nplaced in sort of a chaotic environment\nwhere there's a lot of external stimuli\nthat are pressuring you to do things\nthat's when you actually do your best\nyou can't study for a test that's a\nmonth away but when you forget that oh\nmy god I've got a test tomorrow in its\nlast minute Panic that's when ADHD kids\nactually rise to the challenge and so\nthis is where most of y'all learn a\nreally interesting adaptation which is\nthat okay so if I'm going to screw up\nanyway I might as well screw up now I\nmight as well create an environment of\nchaos because as someone with ADHD\nyou're really good at damage control but\nyou're really bad at damage prevention\nyou're really bad at preventing problems\nand making sure everything goes okay but\nyou're actually pretty good at piecing\nthings together hey all' if you're\ninterested in applying some of the\nprinciples that we share to actually\ncreate change in your life check out Dr\nK's guide to mental health it combines\nover two decades of my experience of\nboth being a monk and a psychiatrist and\ndistills all of the most important\nthings I've learned into a Choose Your\nOwn Adventure format so check out the\nlink in the bio and start your journey\ntoday I know this certainly happened\nwith me like I remember when I was in\nlike the third or fourth grade I walked\ninto school one day and I noticed that\neveryone was bringing in school projects\nand I was like oh crap I completely\nforgot to do this project that was\nassigned a month ago and so I spent the\nwhole hour of lunch in the bathroom with\nlike glue and tape and toilet paper and\ncardboard cobbling together something of\na school project and when class time\nrolled around even though I hadn't\nwalked in with a school project I had\nsomething kind of pathetic that saved me\nfrom failing the class the real tragedy\nis that as you discover that you thrive\nin chaos and that you may actually do a\nbetter job when you're surrounded by\nexternal pressures you actually disable\nthe one part of your brain that protects\nyou against ADHD which is your habit\ncircuitry so let's remember that in\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nour frontal lobes are the primary thing\nthat that's impaired so our frontal\nlobes govern things like sustained\nattention restricting our impulses and\ngiving us the ability to focus but if we\nlook at habits they're actually a\ncompletely different part of the brain\nthey're a part of our brain called our\nbasil ganglia and if you sort of think\nabout a habit a habit is automatic it\ndoesn't require attention it doesn't\nrequire Focus you don't actually have to\nrestrain any impulses when you're\nengaging in something that's a habit\nbecause a habit is automatic it is done\nwithout attention and even the\nneurotransmitters involved are\ncompletely different if we look at\nthings like stimulant medication which\nis what we use to treat ADHD that\naffects the neurotransmitters of\nnorepinephrine in dopamine whereas our\nhabit system is primarily governed by\nendoc canabo which are cannabinoids so\nthat's the same stuff as in marijuana\nwhich is also why marijuana messes with\nhabits but that's neither here or there\nwhen we start to engage in chaotic\nBehavior consistently because remember\nthat you're so afraid that you're going\nto screw things up that you kind of\nscrew things up now and you find\nyourself in a chaotic situation it's\nsomething that once you believe that the\nscrew up is inevitable you might as well\ndo it now and Free Yourself of the\nstress of it but as you start to do that\nit becomes impossible to engage in\nconsistent behavior and if you can't\nengage in consistent Behavior your basil\nganglia won't help you form habits and\nthis is the real tragedy because if you\ndon't have habits and your attention\nstarts to wander the automatic part of\nyour brain doesn't know what what to do\nand I've worked with a ton of people who\nhave ADHD and when we focus on habit\nbuilding what tends to happen is when\nthey lose their attention The Habit sort\nof starts to kick in and if it's the\nright habit then they end up being okay\nbut the real curse of ADHD is that since\nwe start creating chaos we don't really\nengage in that habit circuitry and the\nproblem there is that the habits are\nactually what's going to save you\nbecause if you think about going through\nlife with ADHD you're not paying\nattention but if your autopilot\nmechanism is actually intact and does\nthe right things like if you have wired\na habit of putting your keys in the same\nplace or putting your cell phone in the\nsame place every time you come in the\ndoor you will always know where it is\nthe problem with ADHD is that you\nhaven't built a habit and so you end up\nleaving your keys in the toilet and your\ncell phone in your bed right so we don't\nuse this habit circuitry because we end\nup creating chaos and so if we want to\nstop creating chaos we've got to tackle\nthat that and this is where there's\nanother part of the brain with ADHD that\nis completely intact that y'all are\nusually not very good at using which is\nour capacity to cognitively reframe and\nthis is literally what therapists do\nwith you in your office so your\nanalytical capability or your IQ with\nADHD is completely intact your ability\nto analyze situations and come up with\nintellectually the right conclusion is\nactually completely intact the problem\nis that if you come up with the right\nconclusion you can restrain your\nattention long enough to actually follow\nthrough with it but the analytical\ncapability is completely intact and\nbizar this is one of the reason that\nkids with ADHD grow up with depression\nbecause they recognize that I'm just as\nsmart as everyone around me and yet I'm\ngetting crappy grades there's something\nfundamentally wrong with me although I\nsort of get deep down that my IQ I'm not\nstupid I know I'm not stupid I just\ncan't leverage my intelligence and so\nwhat we want to do is cognitive ly\nreframe in one particular way that sort\nof avoids this chaotic environment and\nallows us to build habits now why do we\nseek chaos in the first place if we go\nback to our earlier example remember\nit's like a sequence of a couple things\nnumber one I try and I fail number two I\ntry to avoid failure and that stresses\nme out and doesn't work anyway which\nmeans that number three what I'm going\nto do is create chaos because I can\nthrive in chaos because my frontal loes\nare externally motivated in stimulus\nbound if everything is falling apart\naround me I'm going to get all these\nimpulses and I will rise and I will\nlevel up my sort of chaos management\ndamage control skills and so what we\nwant to do is utilize our cognitive\nreframing or analytical circuitry in a\nvery particular way we want to use that\nto allow ourselves to start building\nhabits now why don't we do this normally\nit's because we've learned a couple of\nunfortunate lessons with ADHD I'm going\nto screw up even if I try I'm still\ngoing to screw up I do better in chaos\nand I've leveled up my damage control\nskills so in order for me to succeed in\nlife I must make things as chaotic as\npossible because once they're chaotic at\nleast I don't have to worry about not\nscrewing up and then I will rise to the\noccasion this needs to stop and the main\ncognitive reframe that we're going to\nuse is sort of reframing this idea that\nfailure is inevitable so what we\nactually have to do is take the belief\nthat you have and sort of re frame it a\nlittle bit and create a different\nsituation and what I want youall to do\nis don't try to stop failing which is\nwhat people usually try to do just\nrecognize that the more you can delay\nfailing the better off you will be and\nthere's a really great example of how\neffective the strategy is and it comes\nfrom actually the realm of orts so I was\nworking with a particular team that was\nvery very talented but would tend to\nchoke so on some matches or games they\nwould do really really well and they\nlike dominate their opponents and we're\nlike yeah like these guys are awesome\nand then in other games they would sort\nof start to crumble they'd start to fall\napart and at 15 20 minutes into the game\nthey'd start to realize oh man we're\ngoing to lose and once they started to\nbelieve that they were going to lose\nthey stopped trying because these are\npro Gamers and they know how to predict\nwhat's going to happen in the game they\nknow that their chances of winning are\nclose to zero so you might as well throw\nin the towel so these this group of of\npro Gamers actually learned a slightly\ndifferent strategy which was okay even\nif you're going to lose we want you to\nlose less and even win more and what\ndoes that mean lose less that means that\nif you've lost the game at 20 minutes\ndon't actually GG out at 25 see how long\nyou can hold on we're not saying that\nwe're even trying for victory we're just\nsaying we're going to make the enemy\nteam bleed for every inch of ground they\nmay have won but we're not going to make\nit easy on them and so 20-minute games\nbecame 30 minute games become became\n40-minute games and the other really\nshocking thing that started to happen is\nthey started to win games that they\nshould not be winning they started to\nmake comebacks more consistently 10% 15\n20 or even 25% of games that people\nthought were over this particular Squad\nwas able to like make a comeback now\nthat may not be possible for you who\nknows that's not actually what we're\nshooting for but it may work the reason\nthat we want to delay the inevitable\nfailure is because the more that you\ndelay things the more time your brain\nhas to form habits so if you're trying\nto do something with ADHD you may start\nto get really stressed out you're like\noh man I'm going to screw up I'm going\nto screw up I'm going to screw up and so\njust take a step back and tell yourself\nyeah there's a decent chance that I'm\ngoing to screw up but what I'm going to\ndo is try to do as good of a job as I\ncan for as long as possible and if you\ncan frame that way which is not quite\ntrying to counter what you already\nbelieve it's just not giving up right\naway and not invoking the chaos then\nwhat you'll do is buy yourself some time\nand as you buy yourself some time you\nwill start to form habits and as you\nstart to cognitively reframe and start\nusing your basil ganglia then you will\nstart to activate other parts in your\nbrain that will start to change the\ndestiny of your life so instead of\nconstantly being behind and constantly\nbeing stressed you will start to form\nhabits that if you lose track of things\nyou're still kind of like doing things\nthat are kind of productive or useful\nyou'll start to view failure in a\nslightly different way and so the real\ntragedy of the curse of ADHD isn't that\nyou've got some part of your brain that\nis neurod Divergent and can't focus or\nhas difficulty focusing it's that the\nadaptations that you create when you\nchoose chaos and damage control because\nthat's what you're the best at you\nactually disable the most functional and\nhelpful parts of your brain and that's\nthe real curse of\nADHD"
