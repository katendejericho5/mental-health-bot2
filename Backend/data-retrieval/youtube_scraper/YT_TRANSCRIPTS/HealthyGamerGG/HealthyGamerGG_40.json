    "transcript": "my brain does not have the capacity to\nfocus and yet I'm pushing it I pushing\nit I pushing it and I yield very little\ntherefore I must be fundamentally broken\nthere's a lack of effort you need to\nlive up to your potential if you just\napplied yourself you'd do so much better\nwhere is the flaw where is the flaw\nwhere is the flaw it's inside me it's\ninside me it's inside me the reason\npeople think this way is not because\nit's true but because we've been trained\nto conceptualize things in that way if\nwe have ADHD every ADHD at some point\nwhat if I don't really have ADHD what if\nI just have a complex series of personal\nflaws that map onto ADHD experiences\nthat are incredibly relatable to other\nAD other people with ADHD and every\nfailing in my life is entirely and\nunequivocally my fault forget about ADHD\nfor a second this is a very common\nexperience right and this experience\nhappens for three reasons the first is\nthat when we have flaws and someone\ntells us hey this flaw is due to your\nADHD what our mind actually says is it\nresponds with this every failing isn't\nthe ADHD it is entirely and\nunequivocally my fault okay so this is\nwhere like we don't like to blame our\nADHD for our problems this is number one\nbecause our understanding of ourselves\nis consistent with blaming ourselves so\nlet's understand literally what happens\ntwo of the biggest problems I see in our\ncommunity are that people have fallen\nbehind in Life or they're burnt out and\nlooking to make a career pivot and while\nI can give yall lectures on neur neuros\nscience or how to meditate your problems\naway the Practical problem of actually\ncatching up in Life or making a career\nshift Still Remains and that's where\ntriple 10 comes in triple 10 is an\nonline educational platform that offers\nvarious curricula through a boot camp\nformat and they have some of the best\noutcomes in the industry 87% of their\ngraduates have a job within 6 months of\ngraduating and this is unheard of triple\n10 actually offers a refund if you're\nnot able to find a job so you can just\ncontrol Z that tuition away which is\ninsane in this day and age but that's\nhow much they believe in their\ncurriculum and that's how good their\noutcomes are feeling frustrated at work\ncan take a toll on your body and mind\nresearch shows that finding the right\njob that fits you can significantly\nenhance your overall satisfaction with\nlife so if y'all are actually interested\nin making a career change instead of\nthinking about making a career change\nuse the link in the description below to\nget 30% off valid on all of their\nprograms\nin summary ADHD increases the risk for\ndepression especially during adolescence\nand young adulthood however it is not\nwell understood why ADHD increases the\nrisk for depression at this stage so\nthis is true this actually we figured\nout okay so this is a a review paper\nthat's looking at cognitive mechanisms\nunderlying depressive disorders in ADHD\na systematic review and this is sort of\nlooking at how ADHD leads to depression\nI have a complex series of personal\nflaws that map on to ADHD and every\nfailing in my life is entirely and\nunequivocally my fault and it turns out\nthat the reason people think this way is\nnot because it's true but because we've\nbeen trained to conceptualize things in\nthat way if we have ADHD so here's why\npeople with ADHD don't think that they\nhave ADHD they think that they just have\na set of very unique personal problems\nand they don't like to blame their ADHD\nhere's you as a kid and humans are\nactually pretty good at estim IQ maybe\nthat statement is factually incorrect I\ndon't know but generally speaking like\nkids can tell when like another kid is\nsmart or another kid is dumb this may\nchange a little bit later once we start\ngetting phds and we use big words but\ngenerally speaking like you can tell\nwhen someone's stupid right and you can\nkind of tell when someone's smart so\nkids go to school and there's a group of\nkids and we all sort of recognize that\nour IQ is in the same ballpark now here\nyou have a kid with ADHD and you\nrecognize that I'm a about as smart as\nthe other kids then what happens is you\nlook at your performance this kid gets\nan a this kid gets a b and I get an f\nand there are lots of studies that show\nthis we we go into a lot of the detailed\nresearch in Dr K's guide to ADHD and\ndoing stuff it's like super scary so\nthere's a study that looks at if you\nlook at kids with ADHD and depression\nthere's one study that found that if you\nget diagnosed with depression first\nthere is a 3% chance that you will get\ndiagnosed with ADHD as an adult if you\nget diagnosed with depression as a kid\nif you get diagnosed with ADHD as a kid\nthere is a 70% chance that you will have\ndepression as an adult so now you're a\nkid and what we know from ADHD is that\nwhen you are a kid with ADHD often times\nit is not diagnosed so ADHD is both the\nmost underdiagnosed and overdiagnosed\nmental illness in my opinion which means\nthat we diagnose it a ton in people who\ndon't have it and we diag we miss it a\nlot in people who do so this is also\nincredibly common for girls so if you're\na girl with ADHD the rate of diagnosis\nof girls to boys is 1 to three so three\nboys get diagnosed with ADHD for every\none girl gets diagnosed the interesting\nthing is that if you look at women to\nmen this is one: one so how do we\nunderstand this two things one is that\ngirls usually have a frontal lobe that\nis developed one year ahead of their\nmale counterparts so one study showed\nthat if you look at a boy who uh a girl\nat the age of 10 will have like a\nfrontal lobe that's about 11.5 years old\nversus a boy will have a frontal loobe\nthat's about 10.5 years old it's\nsomewhere around 10 years okay so what\nthat means is that when someone is like\nlooking at a a boy versus a girl the\ngirl is like their brains are like one\nyear more mature another reason for that\nwe miss diagnose uh girls we miss the\ndiagnos of ADHD and girls is because the\nmost common symptom that leads to\ndiagnosis is hyperactivity and girls are\nmuch less likely to be hyperactive the\nthird thing that changes is during uh\npuberty we get an in increased estrogen\nAlters our dopaminergic circuitry and so\nwe start to see a lot of like\nimpulsivity and other kinds of like SE\ndopamine seeking activity happen more in\nwomen so there's a puberty effect as\nwell anyway Point here is that this kid\ndoesn't get diagnosed so when this kid\ndoes get diagnosed I want you all to\nthink about imagine that you're a\nseven-year-old child and you recognize\nthat you are just as smart as your\nfriends but you see that there is a huge\nperformance difference and then on top\nof that what happens is your teachers\nyour parents diagnose you with an effort\nproblem they said that you just need to\ntry harder I don't understand why you\ncan't just study why can't you sit still\nwhy can't you go to bed on time I've\nbeen calling you 15 times you need to\ntry harder so I think the single most\ndamaging thing I've seen as a\npsychiatrist is when someone is doing\nsomething completely correctly and you\ntell them that they are doing it\ncompletely wrong so the single most\ndamaging thing what really screws people\nup for life is when they get taught that\nUp Is Down and Down is up so I'll give\nyou all a simple example of this so\nlet's say I have abusive parents and I\nam doing my best to make them happy\nright so I'm actually like being extra\ncareful I'm trying extra hard I'm\nworking extra hard I don't want my\nparents to yell at me but my parents are\nalcoholics and so they're drunk and then\nthey yell and then they blame me even\nwhen I don't do anything wrong so the\nreason that this is so psychologically\ndamaging is because your brain thinks\nthat doing the right thing is the wrong\nthing and then if you go through life\nthinking that the right thing is the\nwrong thing it [ __ ] up so many parts of\nyour life and we see this also I see\nthis in like romantic relationship ships\nright that are abusive where there's\nlike one partner who's like you do\neverything wrong but the person is is\nlike technically doing everything right\nso when you get taught that right is\nwrong and that there is no way to\nachieve right this creates learned\nhelplessness this creates a very\nconfusing way to navigate life because\nthen the right answer no longer becomes\nright you know it's like you you want\nyou want to know how to [ __ ] up people's\nability to do finance and Mathematics\nyou tell them 2 plus 2 is 5 and they're\nlike no I think it's four and you're\nlike No 2 plus 2 is five 2 plus 2 is\nfive there's this great scene from Star\nTrek TNG basically like in this episode\nand this what is what makes Captain\npeard such a Chad peard is getting\ntortured by the card Kardashians\nKardashians and so basically the guy's\nlike you know there's four lights and\nhe's like trying to convince he tortures\npeard until peard says there are five\nlights so he's like trying to get bicard\nto lie so he's like trying to divorce\nthis person's mind from reality\nforite and what I think is is is\nhilarious and sad about this is in the\nshow Captain peard is like very very\nResolute right so he's like very strong\ninternally so he can resist torture and\nthe problem with ADHD is it's the exact\nopposite so peard is like a\n65-year-old you know Starship captain of\nthe flagship of the Federation and but\nwhen you're like six with ADHD you don't\nhave the internal fortitude of a\n65-year-old fictional character like you\njust don't have that internal fortitude\nso when the rest of the world tells you\nthat you need to be working harder it\nreally messes you up you you begin to\nlearn that 2+ 2 is 5 you begin to learn\nbecause everyone around is telling you\neveryone around you is telling you that\nyou're screwing up and you need to put\nforth more effort right so let's say\nthat what you see in other people is you\nsee that they have an IQ of 100 and they\nget an A you have an IQ of 100 plus X\nbut you get an F so what do you conclude\nhere you conclude that X must be some\nlarge negative number and this is\nliterally what happens that we have\nstudies on this so then what happens is\nyou you begin to believe that you have\nsome kind of deficit there is something\nwrong with me there is something\nfundamentally broken and when there's\nsomething wrong with me and\nfundamentally broken this belief is what\ncontributes to the depression so what\nhappens is people with ADHD carry they\nhave this learned belief of Shame and\nthat there's something I am put putting\nforth so much effort because my brain\ndoes not have the capacity to focus and\nyet I'm pushing it I pushing it I am\npushing it and I yield very little\ntherefore I must be fundamentally broken\nthis mathematical equation is what I see\ntime and time and time again with ADHD\nand now what happens is you carry this\nbelief even though it's not true that\nyou have a broken something that is\nalways with you and when you have a\nbroken something then what happens is\nyou look at your life and you say I I am\nbroken there's something every failing\nis my life in my life is entirely and\nunequivocally my fault this is what this\nis what happened so this is a\nconsequence of ADHD if you doubt your\nADHD in this way this is the consequence\nof ADHD and why do you believe this it's\nbecause when you were failing no one\nsaid something else is wrong right the\nblame got placed on you there's a lack\nof effort you need to live up to your\npotential if you just applied yourself\nyou do so much better where is the flaw\nwhere is the flaw where is the flaw it's\ninside me it's inside me it's inside me\nand what happens with these kids it's\nsuper sad because at some point the kid\nmay try to talk to the parent and say\nlike I know I'm smart but they don't\nknow how to articulate like I don't know\nwhat's wrong with me sometimes they'll\nsay that right actually that's what they\nsay literally they say I don't know\nwhat's wrong with me but there is\nsomething wrong with you you've got ADHD\nright you're a neurodiverse individual\ntrying to succeed in a neurotypical\nworld so there's even some evidence when\nwe look at sort of the the stress\ndiathesis model of illness what it\npresumes is that illness is the the\nresult of an environment plus like a\ngenetic risk right so it's not even that\nsomething is objectively wrong with you\nit is that there is an environmental\ncomponent to the manifestation of\ndisease so you can look at someone who\nhas a predisposition for alcohol and\nthen you can give them stressful\ncircumstances you can give them trauma\nyou can even start them on an SSRI or\nanti-depressant medication so even the\ncom the idea that no this is not ADHD\nthis is something that what if I have a\ncomplex of personal flaws that map on to\nADHD you all see how absurd that is but\nthis is the way that the Mind thinks and\nwhy does the Mind think this way because\nit was taught to think that way because\nas a kid you may have asked or wondered\nI don't know what's wrong with me and no\none actually took that question\nseriously no one sat down and did did a\ndifferential diagnosis no one stopped to\nthink what could be wrong with this kid\nand instead what we get told live up to\nyour potential so there's like this this\ncomplex that develops in the mind of\nsomeone who has ADHD where they think\nthere's just something like these are\nall my personal flaws and I have to own\nthem a lot because that's what you were\ntaught you were taught to blame yourself\nand chances are parents don't let you\nmake excuses right so they're like no\nyou can't make excuses this is your\nfault now there are a lot of good\nparents out there who do allow their\nchildren to make excuses those are the\nkids that get diagnosed those are the\nkids that don't wind up with depression\nright remember that the comorbidity\nbetween ADHD and depression is somewhere\naround 30% right so still there's 70% of\npeople out there who don't wind up with\ndepression some amount of luck some\namount of genetics some amount of like\nwhatever the cognitive mechanisms are um\nthen that that you know underly the two\nif you dodge that bullet then you're\nyou're in good shape the last thing to\nconsider about this this like shame that\nof ADHD is experiences that are\nincredibly relatable to other people\nwith ADHD right so you've got like oh\npeople say they have ADHD and I have it\ntoo like I experiened the same thing but\nI'm not willing to diagnose myself with\nADHD and you shouldn't diagnose yourself\nyou should go go get a clinical\nevaluation but you know this is exactly\nwhat it looks like this is the\nmanifestation of the\nshame I I don't I mean it's possible\nthat you have a collection of things\nthat perfectly overlap with ADHD relate\nto other people's experiences with ADHD\nand you still don't accept that you have\nit I think that's completely like normal\nI I don't think it's correct but it's a\nvery very common experience and it's\nbecause of this shame complex you know\nsome people are saying tooking getting\non ADHD meds took away more than half of\nmy depression almost immediately so\nthat's uh that can absolutely happen so\na lot of medic I mean medication for\nADHD is incredibly effective and it is\nalso doesn't work doesn't is not a\nmiracle for like a lot of people out\nthere so for some people they see\ninstant benefits there's also Euphoria\ncomponent to stimulant medication which\nI think elevates people's mood and and\nyou someone else is saying short acting\nfocal messes me up more than than taking\nnothing yeah so like that's like really\ncommon is that there's a highly variable\neffect especially for women female side\nof pharmacotherapy for ADHD a systematic\nreview several sex differences are\ndemonstrated in the prescription usage\nand efficacy effectiveness of both\nstimulant and non-stimulant ADHD\npharmacotherapy a single daily use of\nthis is probably methylphenidate may\npossibly not be optimal for girls with\nADHD and atomoxetine may be a promising\nmedication for girls and women with ADHD\nand the reason for that is really simple\nis I want youall to think a little bit\nabout how ADHD drugs are developed so\nwhat is the most what is the symptom or\nsign it's really a sign that correlates\nthe most with ADHD diagnosis is it it is\nhyperactivity and so what do we what do\nwe really look for what makes a parent\nor a teacher happy with a medicated\nchild it is the reduction of\nhyperactivity right so the kid [ __ ]\nsits in their seat the kid stays seated\nduring dinner the kid isn't running\naround all over the place thank God\nthey're finally medicated for their ADHD\nso when when you're when this is the\nmain sign that we're looking to treat\nand then we develop a stimulant\nmedication turns out stimulants are very\ngood at dealing with hyperactivity the\nproblem is that hyperactivity is more\ncommon in boys than in girls so the\nmedication was developed specifically\nfor and not specifically for\nhyperactivity but that's a huge part of\nthe efficacy of the medication and it\napplies more to boys than girls so so\nthe mileage for girls varies quite a bit\n[Music]"
