    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about the\nscience of self-control and\nevidence-based techniques to boost your\nself-control so the basic problem here\nis that you want to do stuff right you\nwant to eat healthier you want to\nexercise more you want to wake up on\ntime you want to go to bed on time you\nwant to spend less time on your phone\nbut the problem is that you don't really\nlisten to you right and so what we end\nup doing is we try to find Solutions for\nour problems and you'll maybe do a\nGoogle search or watch a YouTube video\nabout how to eat healthy or how to\nactually go to bed on time hey y'all I\nwant to take a moment to thank the\nsponsor of today's video Babel Babel is\nthe top language learning app worldwide\nand I can't advocate for it enough part\nof what I love about Babel is that it's\ndesigned by real language teachers so\nthey know exactly what a student needs\nto learn a language and they also use\nevidence-based techniques to optimize\nlearning in a short amount of time I\nreally wish that I had access to this\nwhen I was actually in med school\nbecause they make learning so easy I'm\nlearning a lot of very common phrases\nthat doctors would actually need to use\nto communicate with their patients I for\nexample am learning medical Spanish\nwhich I wish I had access to when I was\nactually in med school so I'm learning\nhow to say B AA e which means drink\nwater and rest the last thing that I\nreally love about Babel is that it's\nvery accessible in all of the in between\nspaces in my life so part of the problem\nis that learning a new language takes a\nlot of time but I love that I can\nreplace the boring wasteful stuff that I\ndo on my phone with actually learning\nmedical Spanish so I can't thank Babel\nenough for sponsoring today's video and\nstrongly recommend that youall check out\nthe awesome offer which is 60% off your\nsubscription in the link below thank you\nonce again to Babel for sponsoring\ntoday's video and making mental health\ncontent on the internet free and so we\nend up trying to fix these problems\nindividually but in the back of your\nmind you probably know that if you could\njust be better at controlling yourself\nall of these things would get better if\nyou were better at self-control you'd be\nable to eat healthy you'd be able to be\nmore motivated at work you'd be able to\nsuppress and control your burnout and so\nthen we end up doing things to try to\nboost our self-control like sometimes\nwe'll even take supplements that are\nsupposed to be cognitive enhancers or\nwe'll do really hard things like take\ncold showers because taking a cold\nshower is hard and if I can force myself\nto do it then I should be able to force\nmyself to do all of the other stuff and\nit turns out though that that doesn't\nreally work because if cold showers\nincreased everybody's self-control then\nwe'd have a lot of data supporting that\nand everyone would be taking cold\nshowers it turns out that if you look at\nit scientifically what cold showers make\nyou good at is tolerating cold showers\nand that's what's so elusive about\nself-control that we can get good at a\nparticular task but that doesn't\nactually translate over into the other\nparts of our lives and the reason for\nthat is because we have haven't really\nunderstood the science of self-control\nuntil now and there have been a couple\nof in my opinion revolutionary studies\nthat have completely changed our\nperspective on self-control in fact\nthey've shown us that self-control\ndoesn't really exist and paradoxically\nit's through understanding this that we\nwill learn the best scientifically\nvalidated methods to improve our\nself-control and if this is so\nrevolutionary why haven't you heard\nabout it and why aren't people talking\nabout it there are a couple reasons for\nthat the first is really simple it's\nactually really really hard to\nunderstand because it completely changes\nour perspective on self-control and the\nsecond thing is that the discovery isn't\nsexy at all in fact it is quite\ndisappointing and at the same time now\nthat we know this now that we literally\nunderstand where self-control originates\nin the brain we can actually do things\nto significantly boost our self-control\nso let's start by understanding what we\ndo know about self-control so a couple\nthousand years ago a group of yogis\nsitting in India basically discovered\nsomething that awareness precedes\ncontrol and when I teach this principle\neither as a psychiatrist or a meditation\ninstructor I kind of point out that okay\nif you kind of go to the dentist and you\nget something numbed up you can't feel\nyour mouth anymore and if you can't feel\nyour mouth anymore you can't control\nyour mouth water will spill out talk\nlike this you can't really like\nunderstand what people are saying people\ncan understand you right so I sort of\nuse this kind of analogy that okay if\nyou get something numbed up you can't\ncontrol it anymore and it turns out that\nwhile that analogy seemed really good\nit's actually wrong and it goes way\ndeeper than that in the 9s and 2000s\nthere were a group of psychologists who\ntried to figure out what is going on\nwith self-control what is it really\nbecause the basic idea that we had at\nthe time was that self-control is\nessentially like a personality\ncharacteristic it's a part of who you\nare and if you've got the right genes\nand if you've got the right upbringing\nthat if you're 20 years old and you've\nbeen raised with discipline then you\nwill continue to be disciplined we\nthought it was a fixed aspect ECT of who\nyou are as a person and this group of\nresearchers basically discovered that\nit's not a fixed aspect of who you are\nas a person but a diminishing resource\nit's not something that's on your\ncharacter sheet as a trait it's actually\nlike a Mana bar that can be depleted\nover time and this sort of makes sense\nright because we kind of know that on\nsome days we're able to control\nourselves but on days where there's a\nlot of stuff going on and we have to\nexert a lot of self-control when I've\nhad a really rough day at work and I\nwant to yell at my boss and I strain\nmyself all day at the end of the day I\ncan't bring myself to eat a salad and I\njust order a pizza and I sit down and\nlike I'm just done with the day so they\nbasically discovered that the more\nself-control you exert the more it\ndepletes and once researchers had\nfigured out that it is a diminishing\nresource naturally the next thing that\nthey looked at is what diminishes\nself-control the most and what we\nbasically figured out is there are two\nthings that severely severely drain your\nself-control the first is emotional Reg\nregulation so if you spend a lot lot of\ntime suppressing or regulating your\nemotions if you want to tell someone to\ngo screw themselves and you have to hold\nthat in then you will diminish your\nreserve of self-control that's number\none the second thing which reduces\nself-control is stress because let's be\nhonest stress is bad at everything\nstress is bad stress is bad stress is\ngoing to reduce your self-control but\nthey literally found that they found\nthat people who were in more stressful\nsituations had a lower reserve of\nself-control and could not exert that to\ndo healthy behaviors and that kind of\nmakes sense right because stress makes\neverything worse and then there were a\ngroup of researchers that showed up and\nsaid okay what can we do to boost\nself-control and no surprise meditation\nhelps us boost self-control because you\nshould meditate more if you meditate you\nwill be more in control more in control\nbut then like I said earlier this gets\nus back to the original problem where if\nI had the self-control to meditate every\nday I wouldn't need to meditate every\nday if I could force myself to sit down\nthen I wouldn't be in this problem in\nthe first place and this is where we\ncome to the truly revolutionary research\nso a group of scientists sat down and\nthey sort of figured out okay so we know\nthat emotional regulation and stress\nreduce our capacity for self-control\nthen they ask the question what's going\non in the brain when emotional\nregulation and stress actually drain our\nself-control which part of the brain is\nactually being drained and they used\nsomething called an EEG which is\nmeasures the electrical activity of the\nbrain and they discovered something\nreally fascinating that there's this\npart of our brain called the anterior\nsingulate cortex and the anterior\nsingulate cortex is responsible for\nmonitoring internal conflict and what\nthey essentially discovered is when we\nstop monitoring our internal conflict\nour capacity for self-control goes out\nthe window so this was kind of a weird\nfinding because it sort of suggested\nthat self-control isn't really a thing\nbut simply that what self-control really\nis is our capacity to monit monitor\ninternal conflict and if you sort of\nstop and think about it you'll notice\nthis right because when do we exert\nself-control we only exert self-control\nwhen there is an internal conflict so\ngenerally speaking in human be Behavior\nI have an automatic impulse I want to\neat a slice of pizza and then there is\nanother part of my brain that says\nactually we should eat a salad and in\nthat moment when you exert self-control\nthere is actually a conflict because\nbetween one part of you and the other\npart of you that's literally why we call\nit self-control because you are trying\nto control yourself and the self\nactually wants to do something else now\nwe've assumed based on our subjective\nexperience that there's actually a\ncontrol aspect going on but it turns out\nthat that's actually not the case it\nturns out that what these researchers\ndiscovered is as long as the conflict is\nbeing monitored we will be in control\nbut the moment we stop monitoring the\nconflict we lose all control and you may\nmay have actually noticed this because\nit sounds kind of weird right but just\nlike pay attention to your particular\ncircumstance where you fight a battle in\nyour mind and then as long as you're\nfighting that battle you're still sort\nof in control but the moment that you\nstop paying attention and the moment the\nbattle disappears is the moment that we\nlose control now this is where we think\nthat the reason we stop monitoring the\nbattle is because we've lost or we've\nwon right that's what we sort of assume\nthe battle is over that's why I sto\npaying attention and this is completely\nnatural because the two happen really\nclosely together we stop thinking about\nit after we lose right and then we kind\nof give into the behavior but it turns\nout that it's actually the other way\naround it is that when we stop\nmonitoring it that's when we lose the\nbattle and you may have kind of noticed\nthis that in the back of your mind\nyou're kind of arguing with yourself but\nyou sort of like eh and then you stop\nthinking about it and before you realize\nit your phone is in your hand and you're\nkind of waving it around and you're\nscrolling in bed before you realize that\nyou've turned on the light or opened up\nyour tablet and You' started to watch\nwatch something and even working as an\naddiction psychiatrist when I talk to\npatients about their relapse they don't\nrelapse after a long and drawn out\nBattle of like resisting resisting\nresisting resisting resisting you kind\nof give up in your mind and you kind of\nstop thinking about it and then you're\nengaging in the behavior before you even\nrealize it and so this is exactly what\nthe researchers discovered that conflict\nmonitoring is self-control but hold on a\nsecond okay what about all this stuff\naround emotional regulation and stress\nbecause we know that those two things\ndeplete self-control the most but you're\ntelling me that simply monitoring\nconflict is self-control how does that\nrelate and it turns out that it fits\nperfectly so if we look at emotional\nregulation what are we literally doing\nin emotional regulation we are\nsuppressing our internal emotions I want\nto tell my boss to go screw himself but\ninstead of paying attention to that I'm\nI'm going to shut off that part of my\nmind and shockingly when I shut off my\ninternal awareness I shut off my ability\nto monitor conflict and as I shut off\nthe part that is responsible for\nself-control shockingly my self-control\nworsens so emotional regulation fits\nperfectly because literally what you're\ndoing is shutting off that conflict\nmonitoring part intentionally so that it\ngetting pissed off doesn't take control\nand actually cause you problem right so\nthat sort of makes sense that as we\nsuppress our internal awareness we will\nlose the capacity for self-control what\nabout stress though so stress is also\nsomething that fits perfectly because\nwhen we are stressed out literally what\nour brain is doing is externalizing our\nattention when you are stressed out you\nare not thinking or paying attention to\nthis you are paying attention to the\nproblems outside that are going to screw\nyou right so when I'm stressed out about\na test I'm not paying attention to the\ninternal environment I'm thinking about\nthe test when I'm stressed out about my\nboyfriend or girlfriend breaking up with\nme I'm not thinking about how I feel I'm\nthinking about how do I prevent This\nDisaster so now we see another really\ninteresting point of evidence which is\nthat when we are stressed out literally\nwhat our brain does is externalizes our\nattention to solve the problems that\ncause us stress and shockingly when I\nexternalize my attention what do I stop\npaying attention to my internal conflict\nso we actually see that this old\nresearch about emotional regulation and\nstress causing reductions in\nself-control fits perfectly with this\nmodel that conflict monitoring is\nliterally self-control and so what does\nthat mean for you a couple of really\nsimple things the first is that the more\nof your emotions that you have to\nsuppress the worse your self-control\nwill get and this kind of makes sense\nbecause if we look at addiction\nPsychiatry the more emotionally\nturbulent someone is the more more\nlikely they are to use and relapse and\nnot control their behavior the crappier\nyour life is emotionally the more likely\nyou are to give into bad behaviors binge\neat comfort food when do you need\ncomfort food when you need comfort when\ndo you need comfort when there's Badness\nin here so the first thing that we've\ngot to do is learn how to alternately\nregulate our emotions so this can be\neverything from going to therapy to\njournaling to taking walks but what you\nneed to understand is that you cannot\nimprove your self-control if you are\nemotionally turbulent that fixing the\nemotional turbulence is the same thing\nas improving your self-control that's\nnumber one number two what about stress\nbecause this is where we could say but\nokay Dr qu are you saying that as long\nas I'm stressed out that I won't be able\nto control myself and that's where the\nscience really comes in and says not\nquite because I'm not saying that you\nhave to solve all of your problems but\ninstead what you need to do is re\ninternalize your awareness and this is\nthe mistake that we make when I'm\nfocused on solving problems let's say I\nhave a a final coming out up and I'm\nafraid to fail it what I start doing is\nstop paying attention to myself I stop\npaying attention to my Hunger signals I\nstop paying attention to my fatigue\nsignals I stop paying attention to\neverything in here because I'm so\nfocused out there so it's not that you\nneed to fix all of the problems in your\nlife to gain self-control it's that you\nneed to re internalize your awareness so\nanytime you're feeling stressed out try\nto take 15 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes\nto just check in with yourself sit down\nor go for a walk and just ask yourself\nhow am I feeling right now just take\ntake a moment to literally re\ninternalize your awareness just pay\nattention to what's going on and then\nyou may say but Dr K that won't be\nenough even if I pay attention how do I\nstart doing healthy things and this is\nthe Revolutionary and confusing thing is\nthat the two are actually the same\nliterally all you need to do is increase\nawareness of the internal self as you\nincrease that awareness you will be\nboosting that conflict monitoring system\nin the anterior singulate cortex it's\nnot that self-control is separate from\nawareness it's that the two are actually\nexactly the same thing so as long as you\ncan pay attention to your internal\nsignals literally your self-control will\nimprove because the circuits are one and\nthe same what we subjectively experience\nas self-control is different from what\nis actually going on in the brain so a\ngood example of this is if I'm nervous I\nwill say I have butterflies in my\nstomach but I don't literally have\nbutterflies in my stomach it is just the\nway that I subjectively experience\nnausea or anxiety or whatever and\ninstead there's an actually discreete\nneuroscientific mechanism and so if you\nkind of stop and think about it the\nsolution to getting rid of butterflies\nin your stomach is not to remove the\nbutterflies in your stomach it's to\naddress what's actually going on in the\nbrain and so even if you accept that you\nmay be saying okay so I need to\ninternalize my awareness when I'm\nstressed out but then what how do I\nexert self-control and this is exactly\nwhy this is so hard to understand you\ndon't actually need to do anything else\nthat self-control and awareness of your\ninternal State specifically awareness of\nconflicts within you is literally the\nsame thing as self-control and that\nsounds really confusing because\nsubjectively that's not really what it\nfeels like right and this is exactly\nwhat the problem is is\nas we try to figure out how do I control\nmyself we don't find any good\nevidence-based answers because one none\nof them exist and now we actually come\nfull circle to meditation because why is\nmeditation so good at improving\nself-control because when I'm doing\nmeditation all I'm doing is paying\nattention to my breath that's not\ncontrolling my breath it's not resisting\nmy breath it's just paying attention and\nthat's literally because these two\nfunctions are the same in the brain so\nit turns out that the yogis actually had\nit right all along and even what I was\nsaying earlier about awareness precedes\ncontrol is actually incorrect it's not\nthat awareness precedes control it's\nthat awareness is control and so the\nlast thing that you can do which I know\nsounds crazy is actually meditate but\neven in this way you don't have to do a\nformal meditation practice literally the\nmuscle of self-control is the muscle of\nconflict monitoring so all you need to\ndo is pay attention to your internal\nconflict and the more that you s with\nthat conflict the more you will be able\nto exert control and the last thing that\nI'll leave youall with is if you even\nkind of think about the times in your\nlife where you exert self-control you\nkind of are aware of that conflict and\nthen you kind of have this idea of just\ndo it right you kind of make up your\nmind and you just do it and so if we\nsort of stop and think about it then it\nbecomes easy you're like yeah I just\nwoke up one day and I just did it and so\neveryone on the Internet is telling you\nto just do it but that's hard because\nyou don't know how to just do it and\nthat's the beautiful thing think if you\nlook at every person who has decided to\njust do it all of that just doing it was\npreceded by a very high awareness of\ninternal conflict and if we're talking\nabout someone who overcomes an addiction\nwhat we literally do in Psychotherapy is\nbecome aware of that conflict over and\nover and over again and then one day an\naddict wakes up and becomes sober they\njust wake up and they just do it and so\nif you want to do that for your life and\ndevelop self-control what you really\nneed to do is actually not just do it\nyou're trying to solve the wrong problem\nwhich is exactly why it doesn't work\ninstead all you need to do is pay\nattention to your internal conflict and\nthe longer you can be aware of it the\nmore in control you will\n[Music]\nbe"
