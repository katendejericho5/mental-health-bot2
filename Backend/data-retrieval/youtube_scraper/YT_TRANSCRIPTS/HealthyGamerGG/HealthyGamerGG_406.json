    "transcript": "today I'm going to teach you how to stop\nsing and as we explore the Psychology\nand Neuroscience of sing we're going to\nlearn a lot of cool stuff along the way\nwe're going to learn how to stop hating\nother simps arguably how to stop hating\nyourself and even how to stop hating\nwomen for the women in our audience\nwe're going to teach you a little bit\nabout the psychology of only fans\naddiction so that you can better\nunderstand the men around you and if\nyou're really unlucky you can also\nbetter understand people like your\nboyfriend\nthe day that the term simp was invented\nwas a dark day for the internet because\nbasically what we did is observed that\nsome men were being kind to women and\nthat apparently was unacceptable so what\nwe started to do is take the men who\nwere kind to women and denigrate them\ninsult them we added a label we invented\na word of simp and we started crapping\non dudes who were nice to women and so\nif we really want to unpack how that\nwhole thing happened we have to actually\nstart in a really weird place which is\nhow Beatles have sex in 2011 there were\ntwo researchers who got the IG Nobel\nPrize for observing Beetle sexual\nbehavior now we got to take a step back\nfor a second to understand what an IG\nNobel Prize is so there's the noral\nNobel Prize which celebrates gigantic\nadvances in different fields of Science\nand literature and things like that but\nmany years ago someone came up with\nsomething called the IG Nobel Prize\nwhich is also really interesting\nresearch that actually advances the\nfield but is on topics that are kind of\na little bit sus so these two\nresearchers were actually studying\nsomething really interesting which is\nthey observed that Beatles were having\nsex with glass bottles and they were\nreally confused this was kind of a\nconfusing thing right because why on\nEarth is it that Beatles are having sex\nwith bottles something in their brain is\ngetting sort of miswired and they're\nexhibiting mating behaviors towards\ninappropriate mates hm does that sound\nfamiliar it turns out that this research\nalthough kind of ridiculous was actually\nquite revolutionary and it opened up a\nwhole new realm of real psychological\nresearch about humans especially around\nmating and pornography and what we ended\nup discovering was that we get addicted\nto sexual things when they meet\nsomething called a supernormal stimulus\nso if we sort of look at General mating\nyou know I will look at someone and I\nwill be attracted to them you will look\nat someone like me and you will see that\nI have my button unbuttoned and that\nwill make you sexually aroused right so\nthere are some things that we can kind\nof do and even if you look at things\nlike literally people undoing buttons or\nhaving you know low necklines what we're\nactually doing is exposing the people\naround us to a more hyper stimulus right\nso if you sort of think about cleavage\nyou can have covered cleavage or you can\nhave mildly visible cleavage or you can\nhave visible tits and what we sort of\ndiscovered about human beings and people\nwho make pornography sort of figured\nthis out is that the more extreme the\nstimulus there's like a normal stimulus\nof how you would normally see cleavage\nevery day but then the more extreme the\nstimulus is the more it actually excites\npeople and if we look at people like\nsimps or people who start sing for other\npeople what we sort of discover is that\nthis aspect of supernormal stimulus is\nabsolutely at play so in the past people\nhave always been aroused by whatever\nthey've been sexually ared Ed by and\nthen we started doing things like making\npornography and pornography in its\nearliest forms wasn't even visual we're\ntalking about writing dirty letters like\n600 years ago sending letters where you\nsort of describe what you want to do to\nsomeone who's like 3 months of travel\naway and then what happened is we\nstarted taking black and white\nphotographs and we turned them into\ncolor photographs then we added motion\nand with each of these steps different\nparts of our brain are getting activated\nand engaged which means that the\npornography is more more arousing and we\nsort of draw more of a connection\ntowards that thing and recently what's\nstarted to happen is we've added other\nlayers of supern normal stimuli so for\nexample in the past even if I watched\npornography I couldn't really like\ninteract with the person that I was\nwatching but nowadays with platforms\nlike only fans or even streaming\nplatforms we've started to add other\nlayers of human connection and\nrelationships that result in something\nthat's more like sing which is not\npurely a sexual or pornographic\nrelationship this is a relationship that\nhas emotional connections it has social\nconnections and we're sort of triggering\nthese parts of our brain with supern\nnormal stimuli so let me give you all an\nexample if I watch a streamer so the\nstreamer may be physically attractive in\nsome way which makes perfect sense or\neven an only fans Creator and I may get\nsome amount of sexuality right on Twitch\nthere was this whole period of hot tub\nstreams and people were sort of being\nsexually provocative but now I start to\nadd other elements of a real\nrelationship so other elements include\nthings like casual interactions daily\ninteractions I'm watching this person's\nstream every day and if we think about a\nreal relationship real relationships\ninvolve daily casual interactions it's\nnot just all love and games and and sex\nand fun it's also like have eating while\nyour partner is eating it's seeing them\non a daily basis it's hearing them talk\nabout their day but streaming and only\nfans don't only give us that they also\ngive us the opportunity for interaction\nso now I can be noticed by this person\nand when I get noticed by that person\nand even this can be really interesting\nbecause they're noticing me when they\nhave hundreds of viewers right so I get\na lot of special attention and if we\nthink about a real relationship a big\npart of that is special attention so in\nthis way we're also scratching another\nitch and there are also other things\nthat are even more engaging that sort of\ndelude our brain into thinking we have a\nreal relationship and this these are\nthings like emotional vulnerability and\nintimacy so we can watch a streamer who\nis confessing that they're having a\nreally hard time they're crying we sort\nwe were sort of with them in this very\nintimate private and vulnerable moment\nand so the more of these boxes we check\nthe more areas we are taking normal\ninteractions like I'm watching someone\non TV and we're adding these other\nstimuli to them in fact we're adding\nthese super normal stimuli and as we add\nthese super normal stimuli\nwe start to get into almost an addictive\nspace and if you find yourself sing over\nsomeone else there's a good chance that\nyou check a lot of these boxes you have\na lot of sensory input but that you also\nhave regular interactions they may even\nbe somewhat one way that sometimes you\ncan feel really special and important to\nthe other person like when they cry on\nyour shoulder because they're\nsignificant others treating them like\ncrap and all they want is someone who's\nreally nice and listens to their problem\nand you're sitting there and you're like\nhere I am you're sharing that emotional\nvulnerability you're sharing that\nintimacy and it almost tricks your brain\ninto thinking that you all have a\nromantic relationship in the worst cases\nwe actually see this being taken\nadvantage of by platforms like only fans\nor only fans creators so there are a lot\nof women that I've talked to who will\nsort of notice that their partner seems\nto be like into to only fans and it's\nvery threatening it leads to a lot of\ninsecurity but the most important\nquestion that I hear women ask is why am\nI not enough for you I don't understand\nwhy you can't ask me or to do the same\nthings that you ask this Anonymous\nperson and that's what's so devastating\nbecause in a real relationship there are\nnormal safeguards but when you look at\nsomething like only fans this is a\nsecret right I have this dirty little\nthought or this dirty little sexual\nfantasy which I feel kind of embarrassed\nabout but with the protection of the\nanonymity of the internet I can ask\nsomeone else or pay someone else to kind\nof engage me in this fantasy and then I\nsort of get this dirty little secret\nkind of thing that sort of sexually is\nenticing and then of course there's\nactually pornographic material involved\nso that's also sexually enticing so once\nagain what we're doing is we're sort of\nscratching those it itches in a\nartificial way and this is why dudes get\naddicted to only fans because I get\nnoticed I ask them for things and they\ngive me things back there's even a\ntransactional or reciprocal part of the\nrelationship right because I'm giving\nthem something and they're giving me\nsomething which is a normal part of a\nhuman relationship so even if we look at\nsomething like only fans addictions what\nwe're really seeing is that there are\nmen out there who are sort of engaging\nthis stuff and women could be engaging\ntoo and that we're scratching a lot of\nthese super normal stimuli itches but\nwe're also sort of scratching these\nitches of stuff being done behind the\nscenes stuff being done secretly which\nkind of ties us together right because\nwhen you're intimate with someone what\nis the definition of intimacy that means\nyou and I are the only two people on the\nplanet that know that this is happening\nso they kind of scratch that itch and\nthen there's also a lot of vulnerability\ninvolved right I'm going to share\nsomething deep and dark that I feel\nembarrassed about and I can't actually\nshare it with my partner because I'd\nhave to see them the next day what if\nthey judge me about it whereas with an\nonly fans Creator they get paid not to\njudge you they get paid to indulge the\nthings that you were embarrassed about\nand even if they do judge you you can\njust go find a different only fans\ncreator and so we start to see that this\nactivation of the supern normal stimulus\nleads to a lot of unhealthy behavior and\nif you are sing over someone because\nyou're sort of getting all this thing\nyou're getting noticed you're sort of\nsharing these intimate moments you're\nseeing them you're physically attracted\nto them what do you do about it one of\nthe most common things that people do is\ntake the red pill so every person who is\na simp hater was once a simp just about\nevery single person I've talked to who\nhas taken the red pill their journey\nstart starts with trauma related to a\nwoman I was in love with this person and\nthey cheated on me I was in love with\nthis person and they took advantage of\nme and then any human being will look at\nthemselves and start to wonder okay like\nhow did I get into this situation how\ndid I waste three years of my life how\ndid I end up paying this person's rent\nfor six months and I never even like\nthey were never even my girlfriend and\nnow they're dating someone else I've\ninvested so much into this and I've\ngotten burned so bad and if you think\nabout how do you protect yourself from\nthat there's a really simple way you\ntake the part of you that loved this\nperson you take the part of you that was\nintimate and cared for this person and\nyou start to demonize it you start to\nhate it because the part of you that\nfalls in love is the same part of you\nthat got into trouble and then you've\ngot kind of a tricky problem right\nbecause this is a part of it's a part of\nyou and so this is a part of you that\ntheoretically is supposed to be good and\nhow can you protect yourself from it you\nhave to start demonizing it I hate\nmyself I'm so pathetic for falling in\nlove you know I'm such a weak beta\nbecause I fell in love love in this is\nwhat the red pillars say right love is\nlike they call it oneitis so they take\nthis normal human emotion and they\ncreate new terminology that is\ncondescending and denigrating towards it\nand the bizarre thing is that this\nactually helps them in a lot of ways\nlet's remember that red pill actually\noffers people a lot of very positive\nsupport it offers men a community it\nencourages them to take care of\nthemselves to put GA your life to you\nknow become a whole human being on your\nown the problem is that in order to sort\nof fuel that they have to demonize this\none part of them which is their capacity\nfor love and this is also why we sort of\nget simp haters on the internet and even\nif we come back to the terminology of\nsimp the terminology of simp is a\ndenigrating terminology it's an insult\nit's something that you say to knock\nsomeone down a Peg and so now what's\nhappening is I hate the part of myself\nthat loves women or loves people or\nloves or is vulnerable and then this is\na very important principle of psychology\nthe things that I hate Within Myself are\nthe things that I will hate the most in\nother people there are studies that show\nthat if I hate if I myself am a cheater\nI will be paranoid about my partner\ncheating on me the things that we feel\nin here we project out onto the outside\nand then we sort of demonize it out\nthere this is also why a lot of people\nwho are homophobic will sometimes get\ncaught doing things like fting other men\nin public restrooms right so there this\nis a psychological principle called\nreaction formation where if I hate a\npart of myself that hurts right because\nI'm hating a part of myself and what I\ncan do to that hate is I can take it\noutside of me and I can send it towards\nsomeone else and then I'm hating that\nobject out there instead of hating\nmyself which then feels psychologically\nkind of more dissonant I less dissonant\nright so it's more cohesive that oh yeah\nall these losers out there if I can hate\nthe losers out there I don't have to let\nhate the the loser in here so this is\nabsolutely one way to deal with it but\nin my opinion it's maladaptive over time\nbecause essentially what you're doing is\ntaking a normal healthy part of you the\npart of you that falls in love and\nyou're basically demonizing it which\nmeans that you may be able to get laid\nyou may be able to put together your\nlife you may even find Community with\nother men but anytime that you fall in\nlove you're actually going to retreat\naway from it and we've even done\ninterviews with people that sort of\nhighlight this point and so in my\nopinion it's kind of like a double-edged\nsword right because if you let this part\nof you run wild you will actually end up\ngetting burned taken advantage of Etc\nbut if you demonize yourself this part\nof yourself you may protect yourself\nfrom getting taken advantage of but\nyou're still not going to be able to\nhave a full healthy relationship and in\nfact the most healthy relationships\nwhere you love them and they love you\nand your partner y'all are Partners\nyou're actually going to retreat a away\nfrom and so if we kind of come back to\nthis idea of sing how do we actually fix\nthis in a healthier way and it turns out\nthat what we really need to do is just\naddress the supernormal stimuli we need\nto understand that sing is not love it's\nactually an addiction because all of the\nresearch that we have on supernormal\nstimuli are really related to addiction\nwhat we've really discovered is this is\nthe way in which our brain gets addicted\nto something and in the case of the\nBeetles and the beer bottles essentially\nthere were some features of brown pitted\nbeer bottles which tricked the Beetle's\nbrain into thinking that this is a\nbeetle because the be what Beetle sort\nof processes and what it sees is we were\nlooking for something brown we're\nlooking for something that has pits in\nit and we're looking for something that\nyou know when I touch it has like\ngrooves and stuff like that and so as we\ncheck these boxes and then the beer\nbottle is very very Brown and it's also\nvery very big and it has these very very\nextreme pits The Beatles got kind of\ntricked into trying to mate with the\nbeer bottle and this is this is exactly\nwhat happens when we s we these supern\nnormal stimuli trick our brain into\nthinking that we are in love when it's\nnot really love it's actually an\naddiction so the way we want to fix this\nis actually really simple we want to\nstop all the supernormal stimulus from\nentering our brain so what this sort of\nmeans is a couple of basic things so the\nfirst is stop being intimate with this\nperson so if there are things that you\nshare with this person only or there are\nsecret things that they share with you\ndon't do that anymore the problem is\nthat when this happens that part of your\nbrain that gets confused about love will\nstart to think that this is love that\nyou're feeling when what you're actually\nfeeling is an addiction they're\nscratching that itch in a way that's\nactually unhealthy the second thing that\nwe're going to do is stop things like\ncasual contact because once again in a\nhealthy relationship I see this person\nat their best at their worst and\neverything in the middle I get to see\nthem when they haven't showered I get to\nsmell their bad breath I get to do all\nof these casual normal things with them\nand the more that you have casual normal\ninteractions with this person the more\nthat your brain will think that you're\nin love and then of course there's\nsensory stimuli so the more that we\nexpose ourselves to the through the\nsense organs to this person the more we\nsee them the more we hear them the more\nwe DM them the more we talk to them the\nmore we stalk them on social media all\nof these things will will trick our\nbrain into thinking that this is a\nrelationship now if I tell you just stop\ninteracting with them right which is the\nsuccessful advice on the Internet by the\nway which is like cut all contact go no\ncontact and why does that work it works\nbecause people have sort of figured out\nwithout understanding the principle that\nthe more we engage in these supernormal\nstimuli the more likely we are to lose\ncontrol and become addicted and so even\nif I were to tell you this it doesn't\nnecessarily make it easier right you may\nhave tried going no contact and that's\nwhere we're going to teach you something\nreally interesting so I want you all to\npay attention as you start reducing your\nyour stimuli what happens within you\nbecause if this is real love then it's\ngoing to look different from an\naddiction if it's an addiction what\nwe're going to see is withdrawal right\nso if I stop being emotionally\nvulnerable with this person and I also\nset boundaries with them that like hey\nI'm not in a good head space to like\nhandle sort of this emot this level of\nemotional stuff with you right now I'm\nsorry if you do that what you're going\nto notice is that you're going to\nexperience withdrawal you're going to\nmiss it you're going to feel bad about\nyourself you're going to need it oh no\nI'm so sorry I'm here for you tell me\nall of your deepest darkest Secrets\nyou're going to start to Crave that\ndegree of of sort of emotional\nconnection you'll also go through\nwithdrawal around sort of like a lack of\ncasual interaction which may sound weird\nbecause it's not important right it's\njust casual interaction but if you go\ntwo or three days without talking to\nthis person you're going to DM them and\nthen you may even do things like you'll\nstart watch if they're streamers you'll\nyou know watch them again if they're on\nsocial media you're going to look at\npictures of them and you're going to do\nall of these things to satisfy your\naddiction because once you stop getting\nthat stuff you're going to start\ninducing cravings and withdrawal and\nthis is the key thing to understand\nthat's not love love is a couple of\ndifferent things love is first of all\nit's reciprocal it tends to be two-way\nright I love my kids my kids love me and\nif one of those pieces of Love kind of\ndisappears it kind of falls apart the\nother thing about love that separates it\nfrom addiction is love is about the\nother person right so when I really love\nsomeone someone I do things for them I'm\nwilling to sacrifice for them and this\nis exactly how we sort of end up in the\nsimp realm right is that we start\nsacrificing for the sake of this other\nperson so isn't that love no there's a\nbig difference because in sing you are\nactually looking for something if you\nreally pay attention to yourself the the\nreason that it's an addiction what\nseparates love from an addiction is an\naddiction you're looking for something\nfrom this person and this is why you're\nso damn frustrated that they don't give\nit to you this is why you hate them this\nis why we start start hating women\nbecause they don't give us what we need\nand we also start hating ourselves\nbecause damn it why am I so addicted to\nthis crap I'm not I'm giving everything\nand I'm not getting anything in return\nso we build up all of this resentment\nthat is the picture of an addiction if\nyou truly loved this person you would be\nokay letting them go because their\nhappiness is more important than yours\nand that's where things get kind of\ntricky right because you tell yourself\nthat you tell yourself oh I care about\nthis person their happiness is more\nimportant than I mine so I will continue\nto suffer I will continue to support\nthem but that's actually the addiction\nit's very subtle but I want youall to\nreally pay attention to the difference\nbecause even when you're doing all that\nstuff how do you feel about yourself and\nare you able to walk away because if you\ntruly love them you don't need to\ncontinue to engage with them you can\nactually let them go live their lives\nand you can just be happy with them for\na distance but it's that addiction that\ndoesn't allow you to let them go wants\nyou sort of is hungry for more of their\nstimuli more more of their intimacy more\nof that casual contact more of that\nvulnerability and so this is the key\ndifference right love is reciprocal love\nprioritizes the other person but when\nwe're sing and we're sort of addicted to\nanother person it's kind of weird but\nthat that sense of sacrifice actually\nbecomes a way to fulfill our own\nemotional needs and when we sacrifice to\nfulfill our own emotional needs what\nends up happening we sacrifice over and\nover and over again and we get taken\nadvantage of because sacrifice in this\nsense makes me feel good because I'm a\ntragic lover oh my god I've given up\neverything for you and that sort of\nfeels good right it satisfies this\naddiction it's not real love if you guys\nreally pay attention you'll see that\nit's hunger it's an addiction hey all'\nif you're interested in applying some of\nthe principles that we share to actually\ncreate change in your life check out Dr\nK's guide to mental health it combines\nover two decades of my experience of\nboth being a Monk and a psychiatrist and\ndistills all of the most important\nthings I've learned into a Choose Your\nOwn Adventure format so check out the\nlink in the bio and start your journey\ntoday so this is where at the end of the\nday if you really want to break free of\nthis cycle you've got to start by\ncutting down that supernormal stimulus\nand pay attention to whether you go into\nwithdrawal or not the other thing to\nconsider is that if you're someone who\nhas hated women and continues to hate\nwomen and hates other simps I want you\nto really pay attention to whether this\nif this is what's going on is the reason\nthat you hate women because you yourself\nare vulnerable and are not able to\ncontrol yourself that you yourself\nbecome addicted to them and one of the\neasiest ways to let go of an addiction\nis to start hating it right if I'm like\nif alcohol is ruining my life I'm going\nto hate alcohol I'm going to hate video\ngames I'm going to hate DOTA and League\nof Legends Valor I'm going to start\ncrapping on it because that's the only\nway that I can break free but even in\nthat case it's kind of tragic because\nwhat you're really doing is in your\nattempts to conquer an addiction you're\nsacrificing your ability to actually\nhave a healthy and meaningful\nrelationship so if that's the case for\nyou I want you to go back and revisit\nsome of this stuff think through it\nthink about what was was this really\nwhat was going on that I was addicted to\nthis person and if you were addicted to\nthat person and as you've developed\nconfidence and as you form so social\nconnections I know it's crazy but you\ncan learn to love again you won't be the\nsame pathetic beta simp that you were\nback then you've grown as a human being\nso love is something that you can\nactually risk because you are a\nresilient and good person and most of\nall you don't actually have to hate\nwomen anymore right because the reason\nthat you hated women was because it was\nthe way that you conquered your\naddiction to women which makes perfect\nsense but that's not their fault that's\nyour personal weakness which means that\nit's your responsibility to fix and as\nyou fix it you'll stop Bec com a simp\nand hopefully learn to love\nagain"
