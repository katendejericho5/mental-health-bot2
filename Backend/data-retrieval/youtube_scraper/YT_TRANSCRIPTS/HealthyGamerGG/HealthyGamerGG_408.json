chat welcome to another healthy\ngamer G stream my name is allo kenoa\njust a reminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discussed on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational and entertainment purposes\nonly if y'all have a medical concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional Hello everybody welcome so\nhappy Thursday everybody we're streaming\na fair amount this week we are probably\ngoing to be streaming a little bit less\nnext week we are out and doing some\nother things uh but stay tuned to\nYouTube we should actually be uploading\nvideos uh all throughout next week and\nthe week after that\num so we're going to be kind of in and\nout a little bit from like a live\nstreaming standpoint which is part of\nthe reason we're streaming every day\nspeaking of streaming every day tomorrow\nwe are going to be talking with the one\nthe only the\ndestiny um the destiny destiny um and I\nthink we're going to talk a little bit\nabout cognitive enhancement stimulants\ntrying to understand how to approach\nthat stuff uh so tune in for that I\nimagine it'll be a fun and Lively\nconversation just like all of our other\nones\nare\num yeah so how are y'all doing\ntoday yeah I see that I'm a positive\nmale role model excellent I'm happy to\nhear that and hopefully I'm not a\nnegative male role\nmodel um yeah so really looking forward\nto talking to Destiny tomorrow we'll see\nhow that goes usually our conversations\nare pretty Meandering and um I don't\nthink we end up\ndebating but you know we'll we'll talk\nand it'll be great I enjoy talking to\nDestiny a\nlot I'm GNA skip anything with Destiny\nnot going to lie totally totally for you\nyou do you my friend you know so I I\nthink part of the challenge of being a\ncontent creator is that we can't make\neverybody happy all the time and that's\ntotally fine right so that's why we do\ndifferent things with different people\nand sometimes we'll do lectures\nsometimes we'll do what we're going to\ndo today which is we're going to be\nreviewing some stuff on the internet and\ntalking about it um sometimes we do\ninterviews sometimes we do conversations\nthat's why we do everything once in a\nblue moon we will watch a video game or\nplay a video game play a video game I'm\nthinking about watching right now\nbecause the international is starting\nright\nnow um and cro Crona Madness is saying\nhonestly better since I discovered your\nChannel\nDoctor good thank you very much for\nsaying that and that's what we're here\nfor and we do hear that a fair amount\nthat people have like actually been\nimproved which is why we do it and I\nreally hope that I will be able to\nimprove something about y'all's lives\ntoday that's the\ngoal\num okay I don't know who Jesse Lee\nPeterson is but happy to talk to most\npeople in general um yeah\nso cool so someone else's 5 weeks into\ntherapy pretty helpful not going to lie\nrecommend it to anyone honestly as do I\nso one thing to keep in mind is that\ntherapy is generally speaking designed\nfor pathology but a lot of people will\nget benefit from seeing a therapist\noutside\nof uh you know having a clear\npathological problem so whether it's\nlike increasing your self- understanding\nor you know it depends on the therapist\nbut if you find someone who's sort of\ntrained in something like positive\npsychology they can really help a\nlot\num talk talk to Bill\nbutlicker okay well I'm not quite sure\nhow to contact bill\nbutlicker\nbut you know maybe I should look behind\nme when I'm in the shower and maybe\nthat's where Bill butlicker\nis um yeah so for those of you all that\nare here for the first time welcome\neverybody and uh today we're going to be\ntalking about a couple of different\nthings we're going to be talking about\nAI girlfriends is ruining an entire\ngeneration of men the relationship\nbetween ADHD and and\nPTSD um why do people choose to live\nwhen most of life is suffering and then\nwe're going to be talking some\nabout existential crises and neglectful\nparents I\nthink\nokay\num so Rubik is saying it's me I'm Bill\nbutlicker I thought I recognized you\nrubic from my\ndreams all\nright are prices have never been lower\nwhat are we talking\nabout\num uh I have not considered speaking to\nthe ADH I mean sorry the bg3 voice\nactors that sounds lit but that's so\ninteresting thank you very much for the\nbelated\nbirthday wishes snea I appreciate\nit\num will we talk about pizza today no but\nyou just made me hungry my dude or\ndudette um slow mode how do we slow mode\nI don't\nknow I don't know how to slow mode\nit I am\nBoomer\num yeah so we're a question about ADHD\nin the first year of med school yeah I\nmean it's a roller coaster for everybody\nI think we've actually got a couple of\nthings coming out and I would say\nuh we're going to be talking some about\nADHD and Trauma so stay tuned for that\nbecause that'll probably help and then\nwe also have you know Dr K's guide to\nADHD and doing stuff which I know it\nsounds interesting because you're saying\nthat you struggle with motivation and\nyou're kind of grounded with your ADHD\nand that's what we sort of find is that\nADHD really does affect motivation and\nunderstanding that is kind of why we\nincluded the doing stuff part of the\nguide which is actually like 70% of the\nguide so it's really it teaches people\nabout how your motivation circuitry\nWorks what are the things that you can\ndo that allow you\nto function when you don't feel like\nyou're motivated how do you actually how\ndoes the human brain set tasks and\naccomplish them so that kind of core\nunderstanding is something something\nthat I think is sorely lacking in our\nsociety we just don't teach people how\nto use their brains and so then we get\nreally surprised when like people\nstruggle they're like oh my God my\nemotions oh my God I keep on self-\nsabotaging oh my God I'm so unmotivated\noh my God all I want to do is sit around\nplay video\ngames and then we wonder why and it's\nbecause you're driving a car and you\nwere never given the owner's manual so\nyou don't know what any of the buttons\ndo and so you're kind of driving around\nand you're in the wrong gear and your\nhazards are on and you're confused why\nall the other cars on the driveway are\nrunning away from you as quickly as\npossible it's\nbecause your hazards are on and you're\nswerving around because no one ever\ntaught you how to use a steering\nwheel um can you do a stream more on\nyour spiritual practices sure we can\ntalk about that today maybe I think\nlet's get started started how does that\nsound so what do youall think\nchat um we will talk about spiritual I\nI'll I'll incorporate it\ntoday okay do You' want actually let me\nask yall can can I do a poll here I\ndon't know even know if I have mods do I\nhave mods because I'm streaming on the\nthe YouTube YouTube he streaming on\nYouTube okay oh look at this I'm live\nokay and add GG um let me see if I can\nfigure out yeah I don't know how to do\nthis all right so let's talk about uh um\nokay do you all want to talk about\nspirituality or AI\ngirlfriends jump in the\npole I I I don't know I don't know how\nto do this\nchat\nI don't know how to do this you can do\npolls mods okay so let's try to figure\nthis\nout we will try one more time okay it\nlooks like people want to do AI\ngirlfriend let me see if I can am I\nlogged in I'm not logged\nin how do I run\nup hello\nchat did you guys see\nthat how do I run a\npoll\nokay I can clip\nsomething uh yeah okay it looks like I'm\nokay there we go thank you so much mods\nmods to the\nRescue all right do I get to\noh okay what's the\nanswer what's the answer\nchat\ncool blunty just super chatted 10 bucks\nthank you so much Dr videos your Dr k\nyour videos have been such a huge help\nto me lately trying to get over my\nattachments and set healthier boundaries\nto keep toxic people out of my life\nemotional disregulation and all of that\nstrong work blunty keep at it my\nfriend\nokay okay so we can do I maybe if we\nhave\ntime one day we'll\ndo how to date people who are\nexcessively\nspiritual yeah I'm sorry I can't date\nyou because the\nplanets I'm having a bad day because of\nthe planets and my Prana and my chakras\nare all out of\nalignment today we will do a stream on\nthe techniques of muladhara chakra\nstimulation\nto balance someone's\nfrana and if you know what that means\nyou know what that means and if you\ndon't know what that means I would not\nGoogle\nit okay so how do I see the results of\nthe\npoll just\nlike do yall do yall know what that\nmeans\nokay so someone's asking hey Dr K do you\nneed to be extremely wealthy Rich to\nprogress heavily in mental health W the\ncould be enlightened but his teachers\ncouldn't because they didn't have his\nwealth so that's a great question you\ndon't need to be rich you need to be\ndone with the game of money right so if\nwe look at the people who became\nenlightened they were usually at least\nin the Indian subcontinent Kings or\nprinces so we're talking about people\nlike Buddha Rah Krishna they're all\nKings they're spiritual teaching\nteachers the experts the brahans the\npriests were not\nenlightened and so one of the key\naspects of spirituality is you have to\nbe done with the game of money he can't\nbe chasing materialistic stuff and be\nspiritual now you can acrw materialistic\nstuff it is okay to make money but it\nabout the chasing it is about this\nfundamental idea of what brings me\nhappiness and as long as you are\nunsatisfied and trying to fill it with\nmaterialism\nthere's only so high you can go on the\nspiritual path because some people will\neven say that's an important step to\ntake right so like materialistic\nsatisfaction gets you to floor five but\nif you want to go above floor five then\nyou have to be done with the game of\nmoney all right how do I see the poll\nresults\num yeah so Dr K is an atheist myself how\ncan you re reconcile any understanding\nof spirituality great great great great\ngreat question we'll get to that I'm\njust I can't see the poll results chat\ndoes anyone know what they\nare I see the poll is live\nbut let me see if I can find\nout okay can I close\npoll\nno all right so let me ask yall\nsomething\nchat if I watch a YouTube ad here's an\nexistential question for\ny'all if I'm streaming on\nYouTube and I browser share my stream\nand it plays an ad do I get twice as\nmuch\nmoney okay mods we're going to have to\nfigure this out okay 57% spirituality\nokay let's talk about spirituality then\nthank you thank you so\nmuch thank you chat oh my God I don't\nknow what I would do without\ny'all okay\nso let's get\nstarted why do people choose to live\nlife when most of it is just suffering I\nneed this answer I need to know hello\nall for the past 2 years I've been\nstruggling to answer this one question\nwhy do people choose to live despite it\nall when I look at everyone's lives\naround me I'm just so stunned for most\npeople life is nothing more than a cycle\nof working your ass off all day so that\nyou can make enough money to feed\nyourself so that you can wake up the\nnext day to repeat the same thing again\nand again and again until you die and I\nhave not been able to cope with this not\nat all this question struck me hard two\nyears ago back when I was 16 the time\nduring which I would start studying for\ncollege entrance exams I studied all the\ntime I'm an Indian so it's harder here\neventually I looked at my future and I\nwas horrified nothing but working to\nlive the next day to then work for the\nnext and the worst part of all this is\nthat I one of the few who have it good I\njust can't imagine others poor countries\nwhere people have to work even harder or\nWar torn countries even the countries\nwhich I felt would have been my\nsalvation like the United States seem to\nbe getting crushed under inflation there\nis nowhere to run from that there's\nnowhere to run from my fate no hope in\nthe past it was even worse slavery was a\nthing slaves actually chose to live why\nwhy why did they choose to live why do\nthe Chinese who work the entire day\nchoose to live somebody please tell me\nright now my life is a bit on ease and\nbut I can't imagine how I will cope with\nthe idea of being alive once I get a job\nif I can get one I'll probably kill\nmyself that's scary so please don't do\nthat and you know if y'all are having\nthoughts of suicidality please go see a\nlicensed professional or call Emergency\nServices\nbut let's start with this basic premise\nright like why on Earth should I\nlive if life is\nsuffering because for many people it's\nabout a slog I wake up today I work\nreally hard and I work really hard and\nthen I go to go home I feed\nmyself and then I go to bed so that I\ncan have more energy to work\ntomorrow I'm in a highly competitive\ntesting environment where everyone is\ncramming all the time and what's the\npoint it sucks to cram I don't want to\nlearn this stuff but I have to because\nmy future depends on\nit and this person even says some of us\nwill try to cope with this reality of\nlife is suffering and I can't cope\nanymore well\nyeah coping ain't going to work so if\nyall want to\nunderstand how do you live life if it is\nfundamentally\nsuffering and why should we do this the\nreason you should do it is because you\ncan get better at it and the reason that\nlife is suffering is because you suck at\nliving it I know that sounds kind of not\ncompassionate but that's how it is let\nme give youall a simple\nexample I can throw someone into a\nswimming\npool and their experience is I'm\nstruggling to stay afloat oh my God this\nis awful I can barely breathe I'm trying\nto cope with the fact that I don't know\nhow to swim and I'm in a body of water\nwhy on Earth should I stay in this body\nof water this is awful yes you are\ncorrect swimming or not swimming being\nin a body of water sucks if you don't\nknow how to swim and coping is not the\nanswer the basic problem is that we are\nnot taught how to swim in life we are\nnot taught how to live\nlife because if all your life\nis is subsisting today so that you can\ncontinue to subsist\ntomorrow that ain't going to\nwork now sometimes so let's start with a\ncouple of Basics the first is that we\nall have a core need for survival in\ntheoretically procreation so this is a\nbasic human Drive where if you look at a\nbacteria a bacteria is trying to live to\nprocreate\nso we have this core reason to stay\nalive which is just because we're\ndesigned to right we prefer life over\ndeath as human beings as all animals as\nall living things they don't even need\nto be animals they strive to survive so\nwhat's happened in the past I don't know\n20 30 40\nyears is that the drive to survive is no\nlonger sufficient to keep us in the game\nbecause life has started to suck so so\nmuch this is where people will say but\nDr K what are you talking about there's\nbeen so much advancement and I agree\nthere's been a lot of advancement and a\nlot of good stuff that's happened I\nthink we're better off today than we\nused to be but we are swimming in\ndifferent\nWaters and survival used to be\nsufficient because in some ways survival\nwas easier and I know it sounds kind of\nweird but like if you look at hunter\ngatherer societies how many hours a day\ndo hunter gatherers work\nthey kind of work six maybe eight hours\na day their life is pretty chill they\ndon't have to worry about mortgages at\nthe end of the month they don't have to\nworry about oh my God if I get a B on\nthis test in my sixth month of\nUniversity how will it affect my job\nprospects four years from\nnow so a couple of fundamental things\nhave changed\nobjectively things in some ways are\nbetter for for example people used to\nstarve to death and some very unlucky\npeople still do but generally speaking\nobesity causes more death than\nstarvation does which is wild right\nthink about that for a second we have\nessentially won the game of surviving\nlife and we have won the trophy of\nsuffering as a result because survival\nused to be enough to drive us used to be\nenough of a reason to do something\nbecause if we didn't do it we didn't eat\nwe didn't\nsurvive and so now the game has\nchanged the main quest is different and\nnow the very things that we have been\nwired to do are the things that harm\nus I love fatty carbohydrate dense food\nas does every human being on the planet\nbecause that helped us survive now that\nlove kills you\nliterally leads to two people's death so\nthat which we were wired to\ndo no longer works because the world has\nchanged and the world has changed more\nrapidly over the last 30 or 40 years\nbecause if we look at the rate of change\nin the world is increasing\ncalculus how much technological\nadvancement happened between the years\n430 CE and 600 CE not very\nmuch right 170 years not much what was\nthe world like in 1850 compared to what\nit is now completely transformed you\ncould take a human being from the world\nin 1850 and drop them into today and\nthey would be so confused what is this\nguy doing he is talking to an image of\nhimself and there are these weird lights\nand he's like talking as if he's\ninteracting with people but there's no\none in the\nroom what on Earth so the world world\nhas fundamentally changed and we have\nnot been taught how to live in\nit and you can't cope with this you just\nhave to learn how to\nlive and so then the question becomes\nhow do you learn how to\nlive because they don't teach us that\nright so this is a core problem in the\npast our education was based on external\nthings because that's what we needed to\nsurvive this is how you\nfarm this is how you do mathematics this\nis how you read\nbut now we have tools that do all that\nstuff we have this thing called a\ncalculator we have programs that will do\nyour taxes for\nyou we don't need to we have audio books\nand we can look up anything at the drop\nof a hat right we can search anything on\nWikipedia and have all the information\nat our\nfingertips so our educational system has\nnot kept up because now what we need\nmore than ever is to understand how to\nto\nlive not be successful how to\nlive and so this is where spirituality\ncomes\nin because I think the\nmost successful study on how to live is\nwhat I would call spirituality so if you\nyou describe different branches of\nknowledge so what is like mathematics\nwhat is\npsychology right so mathematics is the\nstudy of\nmath or not study it's it's ma it's\nmathematics I guess mathology would be\nthe study of math but and in Psychology\nthis is where we get another thing\nthat's kind of tripped up so psychology\nis not about understanding yourself it\nis about understanding the external\nbehavior of humans how do human beings\nin general\nfunction right it's kind of like\neconomics it's not like there's a big\ndifference between personal finance and\neconomics economics is money on a big\nscale personal finance is personal it's\nmoney on a small scale and we even\ncalled the field I work in finance that\ndoesn't mean you do personal finance\nthat means you work in like banking\nright so we we add the word\npersonal so personal psychology is\nspirituality because if you go to get a\ndegree in Psychology they're not going\nto teach you how to wake up in the\nmorning they're not going to teach you\nhow to find motivation in your own life\nthey literally will not teach you that\nthey will teach you core psychological\nprinciples like pavlovian\nresponses this is what we understand\nabout human behavior this is what we\nunderstand about sadness not your\nsadness but people's\nsadness so spirituality is the\ndiscipline of understanding yourself\nthat has nothing to do with God so even\nif you're an atheist this is why you\nshould engage in spirituality if you're\nreligious or an atheist both people\nshould engage in\nspirituality because spirituality is the\nstudy of of the self that's how I'm\ndefining\nit now a lot of people may say but hold\non a second like isn't psychology and\nbiology and whatever sufficient I don't\nthink\nso because learning about how human\nbeings develop cravings and learning\nabout the science of digestion doesn't\nnecessarily allow you to choose a salad\ninstead of like a fried whatever the\nright and so the basic problem if you're\nsuffering everyday in life is that you\nhaven't been taught how to live it and\nyou haven't asked the question what is\nthe source of my suffering and people\nwill say okay I have to work every\nday and studying for this test is the\nsource of my suffering that's not the\nsource of your suffering your suffering\ncomes from your reaction to those\ncircumstances because here's a really\nsimple\nexample does everyone who studies every\nday suffer the answer is no in fact some\nsome people love it and don't you wish\nyou were like\nthem I study more on a daily basis\ntoday than I did at any point in my life\nprior to like the last two\nyears right even cramming for textbooks\nand stuff I go through yall want to see\nlike just a quick example of like oh I\ndon't have it here but\nanyway so like the over the last 24\nhours I've read 150 pages of scientific\narticles okay I'll give you example if\nyou guys want to\nsee right so this is an example of\nsomething that I went through over the\ncourse of a month all right this is a\ngigantic pile of\npaper so studying isn't what causes\nsuffering it is your reaction to\nstudying and the number one reason that\npeople suffer is because they do things\nthat they\nshould because your whole life you've\nbeen\ntaught that you should do this and you\nshould do this and you should do this\nand you don't want\nto and so then what happens is there's\nsomething in here which doesn't want to\nand there's something out there telling\nyou to do something else and how do you\nreconcile to these two things you bury\nthis you bury a part of\nyourself you stop paying attention you\nnumb out and what you are literally\ndoing is burying a part of you that\nstrives for something that wants\nsomething that is reaching for\nsatisfaction and\nenjoyment and then we're confused why we\nsuffer the reason you suffer is because\nyou're not living your life you are\nliving a life that is Pres described by\nother\npeople no wonder you suffer cuz you're\nnot living the life that you\nwant you're literally literally you're\nliterally living someone else's ideal\nidea of a\nlife and it's not even one person right\nit's some Franken steinan\namalgamation of what we should do\nbecause then you get in this educational\nsystem where the goal isn't even\nlearning anymore can y'all believe that\nright and this person was from India so\nlike I I'll tell youall just random\ntangent so I was looking at some\nstatistics on the most successful\ncompanies in the world and I was really\nsurprised because if you kind of look at\nlike developed Nations right the US and\nparts of Europe like Germany like China\nthey have these like awesome gigantic\nconglomerates that are doing like very\nrevolutionary and groundbreaking work\nand India is falling behind same amount\nof people as China roughly\nbut Indian companies don't do as\nwell on the global stage right and maybe\nthat's incorrect I'm not trying to dis\nIndia but then I started to wonder why I\nwas like wait a second like we're just\nas smart we're just as capable we have\njust as many people we've got awesome\ncolleges and institutions why aren't\nlike why is there a per\ncapita disproportion in like the number\nof leading Indian\ncompanies and it's because of the way\nthat we Foster creativity or don't\nFoster\ncreativity right learning is all about\ncramming cramming cramming cramming\ncramming instead of actually learning\nit's about rote\nmemorization and what we're also\nstarting to see is like these very are\nnot ve starting these have been there\nforever very hierarchical power\nstructures and as we as human beings\nstart living in in situations where you\nknow I I'm involved in a company and\nthere are people people older than me\nwho report to me this is something that\nis very common in the United States much\nrarer in\nIndia so the reason that we suffer is\nbecause we're we are trying to exist in\na world that demands other things of us\nand we quiet down our internal\nthoughts and we ignore them and then\nonce you disconnect from yourself of\ncourse life is going to be suffering\nbecause when life is good is when you're\nconnected with yourself when you get to\nfeel and be and do\nsomething right I was talking to a\npatient of mine who is perpetually high\non marijuana\nperpetually constant use of Edibles and\non top of that smokes throughout the day\nand I was talking to them about why do\nyou do\nthis and they kind of told me that like\nthe more I talk to them the more I\nrealize that they feel connected to\nthemselves when they're\nhigh they can taste food better they can\nhear music\nbetter their social anxieties start to\ndisappear they stop worrying about the\noutside\nworld and think about that for a\nsecond this person's source of Happiness\ncontentment is about disconnecting from\nthe outside world and reconnecting to\nyourself This is the essence of\nspirituality so some people will use\ndrugs to do it you don't need to it can\nbe\ntaught and so if you're suffering in\nlife because you're unhappy with your\nsituation do something else and this is\nwhere you will say I can't why not\nbecause because what because people will\nbe upset how will I be able to pay my\nrent how will I be able to do this how\nwill I be able to do this that's a good\nquestion I don't know the answer to that\nso if you don't know how to do something\nare you going to try and figure it out\nor if you can't see the road from A to Z\nare you never going to take the first\nstep and this is what happens we are a\nsociety that is becoming increasingly\nrisk averse and we're told follow this\npath follow this path follow this path\nand you'll be happy you'll be happy\nyou'll be happy you'll be happy and then\nyou ask the question\nwhen the answer is always the same later\nwhen will you be happy when the exams\nare over I'm still not happy yet when\nyou're done with school when you get a\ngood job you get a good job now I just\ngrind at work every day when you're the\nboss even when you're the boss you're so\nstressed out all the time later later\nlater later\nlater so spirituality is the practice of\nliving today not about the future not\nabout the past living today these are\nthe core Central tenants of spirituality\nnumber\none that happiness comes from\nwithin it can come from people may think\nit comes from without but this is the\nwild thing you may say but no but my\nhappiness comes from the enjoyment of\nexternal things okay so y'all got to\nunderstand this that is wrong you will\nsay no but I like apples okay let me ask\nyou a question where does the experience\nof liking happen liking apples\nhappen where where do you like apples I\nlike it in here do you all get\nthat no material object carries pleasure\npleasure comes from your reaction to an\nobject this fundamental thing we do not\nunderstand oh I love playing this video\ngame it's so much fun and on hour six I\ndon't know why the I play this\nvideo game it's not even fun the game is\nthe same game hasn't changed\nyou had Smurfs on your team in game one\nyou had Smurfs on the enemy team in\nGames 2 3 4 5 and\nsix crazy thing there was never a Smurf\nyou just thought there\nwas right cuz surely when you're getting\ndumpstered it's because there's an enemy\nSmurf do y'all see\nthat so this is the key thing to\nunderstand all enjoyment comes from\nwithin literally you cannot enjoy\nsomething outside of\nyourself it's impossible physically\nmentally existentially you cannot enjoy\nsomething outside of yourself well no\nthat's wrong I'm my my brother or sister\ngot married recently and I'm happy for\nthem where do you experience the\nhappiness it's in\nhere first tenative\nspirituality joy and happiness and\nsuffering all come from in here once you\ndiscover\nthat a lot of things start to change so\nnow what you can do is there are\nexternal events right studying for a\ntest which then get translated into your\ninternal being there is a system of\ntranslation and then you can modify that\nsum right so now this is where things\nget really interesting because how much\ncan you modify an external event to\ncreate a differential response within\nyou so let's start with 50/50 but\nhonestly the answer is close to 99 or\neven\n100% you can absolutely do that and\npeople may be confused about that but we\nactually know this clinically so when we\nhave someone who is depressed and\nsuicidal we know that there are\ndifferent kinds of coping\nmechanisms so the most basic kind of\ncoping mechanism which is not very\nhealthy in the long run is emotional\nemotion focused coping and what that\nmeans is when I feel something bad in\nhere I'm going to do something to numb\nthese emotions and make the Badness go\naway doesn't\nhelp the most successful kind of coping\nmechanism and by successful what I mean\nis leads to good outcomes for people\nlike objectively and subjectively so\nthey feel better and they do better top\nof the list is something called\ncognitive\nreframing and as therapists as\npsychiatrists we will literally go into\nour office for seven hours a day and\nteach people how to do this\nwhat does cognitive reframing mean does\nit mean fixing your problems\nno it means changing the way that you\nthink about them it's not changing\nanything on the external it is changing\non the\ninternal that process traditionally is\nwhat we call\nspirituality so you can modify whatever\ncomes in and then the question kind of\nbecomes how and this is where I will\nleave you with the most basic tool of\nspirituality the only thing that you\nneed which will get you all the way from\nzero to a thousand which is look within\nyourself that's\nit all you\nneed everything else is a permutation or\ncombination or fancy way of looking\nwithin\nyourself so if you are unhappy about\nstudying why what is it about this that\ncauses suffering within\nyou and what you'll discover usually is\nthat what causes suffering in you is the\nattachments to the thing the meaning\nthat your mind literally extracts from a\nbenign thing this is just a test I'm\nliterally studying mathematics that's\nall I'm doing 2 plus 2 is four that's it\nbut our mind attaches all this crap to\nit oh my God if I get it wrong then I\nwon't get a good job if I don't get a\ngood job then I won't get a good\nmarriage if I don't get a good marriage\nthen I won't be happy in\nlife and so what happens is 2 plus 2\nequals 4 suddenly becomes your mind\nattaches meaning to it that you are\n if you get this question wrong\nbut that's literally incorrect like\nliterally that is not correct it is all\nof the rest it's hypothetical it's not\nliteral do you all get that we attach\nall of these things we construct these\nthings our mind and that's the root of\nour suffering how do we deconstruct pay\nattention to your reactions because that\nis those are the building blocks your\nreactions to things what does this mean\nto\nme and as you look within yourself what\nyou're going to be doing is the very\nopposite of where we started someone\nelse is telling me I should do this but\nI don't want to do this so I'm going to\nsuppress this and I'm going to lean into\nto what everybody else wants that is the\nvery opposite of looking within yourself\nin fact it is shutting down your ability\nto see within yourself and this is the\nsource of\nsuffering now this has nothing to do\nwith\nGod this is what spirituality is simply\nan the study of the\nself now people may Wonder but then how\nthe hell did this get correlated with\nspiritual religion and stuff in the\nfirst place for two\nreasons so the reason spirit uality got\ncorrelated with religion is because when\npeople did this they discovered\nsomething like God so as people started\ndoing these meditative practices and\nlooking within themselves they started\nactivating parts of their brain in\nunusual\nways so chances are what happened is\nthey started inducing high CO2 States\nwithin the brain normally what happens\nwhen you have a high CO2 state is you\ndie\nlike if we're talking about asphixiation\nokay kills you but if you train Yourself\nby like being in the Himalayas for 15\nyears in slowly reducing your\nrespiratory rate until you can\ntolerate through sort of managing that\nlactic acidosis through metabolic means\nthere's a whole physiology behind it\nwhich your body can ramp up so it is no\nlonger lethal you start to create\nmalfunctions in the brain that are not\nharmful and you say malfunctions in the\nbrain what do you mean what I mean is\nVisual and auditory\nhallucinations psychedelic\nexperiences but since these are not\ninduced by artificial drugs and you're\ntrained in in the ability to use your\nmind your mind is a very sharpened\nweapon that can cut through anything you\nare able to handle that spiritual\nexperience and you see some kind of\nconnection to some greater\nbeing and so the original practi\npractioners of spirituality became the\nsource of\nreligion they were enlightened in some\nway they had some kinds of spiritual\nexperiences the second thing that\nhappened is that as people made\ndiscoveries they started passing these\ndown and that became codified into a\nreligion and Buddhism I think is the\nbest example of this where Buddha\nexplicitly did not start out to start a\nreligion you could make the same\nargument for someone like Jesus right\nI'm not an expert in Christian theology\nor history for that\nmatter and so when these people this is\nthe second thing that happened is when\npeople started to discover the source of\nhappiness and lose I like conquer\nsuffering basically other human beings\nwere like holy what did you figure\nout teach me how to do that because you\nseem happy all the time and you don't\neven have as much money as I\ndo this person is different\nand so then they gravitate to that\nperson and then this person teaches them\nand this becomes codified into a set of\npractices that we then call\nreligion and then if you look at what\ngoes wrong in\nreligion basic problem in religion is\nthat you've got someone who knows what\nthe they're talking about and then\nother people are like teach me bro or\nteach me girl and you're like all right\nand and then you teach it to them and\nthen the original person dies the\nproblem is that unless there is a\nenlightened person in the Next\nGeneration someone starts living by a\nscript instead of actually understanding\nthey start paring\nanswers and so there's a decay in\nknowledge and understanding which is how\nreligions go off\ntrack right you can make an argument\nthat a lot of religious people nowadays\ndon't even understand the essence of the\nreligion that they're practicing it's\nturned into something else because\nwithout the spirituality religion\nbecomes a\nhusk of codes of conduct without\nunderstanding and then we get these\nreally wild like contradictions based on\nthe roots of the religion when someone\nis like yeah we're about\npeace but I'm a kill\nyou or we're about compassion but\nyou\nbecause these people don't have the\nspirituality and so I don't think people\nsometimes get upset about religion and\nstuff I don't think religion is bad or\ngood just like anything else in this\nworld science isn't bad or good it's how\nwe use\nit I think the biggest problem with\nreligion is that we've lost a lot of\nspirituality\nthere\nquestions AMR is is this live you damn\nright it\nis okay so there's a very practical\nquestion here from Jared hey how does\nthis work with relationships when I get\nhome from work I want to relax and my\ngirlfriend wants me to do some chores\nand and that is what I should do but I\nwant to\nprocrastinate so let's understand\nsomething as you start your progress\nthrough spirituality you will discover\nsomething okay the world wants me to do\none thing internally I want to do\nsomething\nelse and the source of suffering is I\nstop listening to myself and I start\nlistening in to what people say I should\ndo so then you may naturally conclude\nokay so then I get you ignore what other\npeople say and just do what I feel in\nhere I don't want to do the chores I\nwant to sit around I'm going need ice\ncream and make myself a gen and tonic\nand just chillax everybody\nelse pay\nattention because here's what you will\ndiscover as you\nprocrastinate you will feel bad\nyou will start to discover something\neven Wilder which is satisfying the\ninternal desires doesn't even lead to\nhappiness this is crazy you will\ndiscover that okay I shouldn't listen to\nthem I should listen to me instead but\nif I listen to me all the time I'm going\nto be unhappy and you're damn right you\nare because that's what happens right so\nif I like want to be a degenerate and\nI'm like I just want to play whatever\ngames all day long\nyou're like listen to yourself Dr K\nthat's that's great like I'm a play\ngames yeah everybody else we're\njust G to we're going to have fun it's\ngoing to be\nHedonism and that's when you will\ndiscover that even satisfying so\nprinciple number two of\nspirituality satisfying your internal\ndesires is a source of\nsuffering I'll give you all a simple\nexample I want to play a game today okay\ncool take the day off play game but I\nfeel guilty and when I go to bed at\nnight I feel like I wasted the day and\nthere were other things that I wanted to\ndo and this person is upset with\nme so now we get to something else which\nis that beneath your desires so here's\nthe other thing that the yogis figured\nout what you want in here is multiple\nthings not all desires are the\nsame and what they sort of discovered is\nthat there's one simple way to separate\nthem there is desires and there's\nDuty and you may say to yourself but\nhold on isn't Duty what I should do no\nit is what you feel you should do not\nwhat someone else says you should do so\nit is a should but is a should that\ncomes from the inside instead of a\nshould that comes from the\noutside because here's what you discover\nif you pay attention to yourself if I\nspend a day playing video games all day\nlong and I go to bed at night I'm going\nto feel guilty I'm going to feel bad I'm\ngoing to feel unhappy with myself if I\nspend a day doing work that I am\ninterested in let's say I spent I'm\ngoing to take the day off cuz work\nbut I'm going to go to the grocery store\nI'm going to cook myself a nutritious\nmeal I'm going to exercise I'm going to\ngo for a walk and I'm going to journal\nfor 30 minutes and then you play video\ngames for the next 5 hours or 6 hours or\neven eight hours because I know it\nsounds crazy but that crap only takes 4\nhours you wake up at 8:00 a.m. be done\nby noon be a degenerate gamer for the\nnext 8 hours I can guarantee you and I\ndon't say use that word very often but\nthis is the closest to a guarantee that\nI can get that you will be happier in\nthe second scenario where you did\nsomething productive and then had fun as\nopposed to being a degenerate all day\nlong and so the second main main\ndiscovery of spirituality is that simply\nsatisfying your impulses in here does\nnot lead to happiness and that some\namount of sacrifice and difficulty leads\nto\nhappiness and Now We're Off to the Races\nboys and girls because you have just\nmade the Revolutionary discovery that\nwill transform your life absolutely\ntransformed mine how did I go from\nliterally failing out of college to\nbeing faculty at Harvard Medical School\nthrough this one\ndiscovery that that which is hard and\ndifficult actually makes me happy and\nnow the world is a different place\nbecause now when something is hard or\ndifficult you don't Quake you don't get\ndepressed you don't give up you're like\n yeah let's\ngo just imagine how different your life\nwould be if when something was difficult\nyou were like yeah I'm going to do it\nanyway all those doubts all those fears\nof what if it's not good enough somebody\nelse can do it differently somebody else\ncan be better I'm not so suited at\nthis if all those thoughts didn't have\npower over you what would your life be\nlike and this is why people who truly\nunderstand uh spirituality religion\ncrops up around them like\nmushrooms because they start to live\ntheir life in a different way so\nhedonistic Pursuits from the internal\nare not going to lead to happiness and\nremember I didn't say that you need to\nknow all this stuff I just said you need\nto pay attention and if you pay\nattention you will discover this on your\nown I want a cookie eat a cookie now I\nfeel\nguilty I'm happy with the first one but\nnow I want a second one wait so hold on\na second you ate one cookie you got some\nhappiness and your desire increased yeah\nso I'm going to eat a second one I'm\ngoing to be more happy okay so you eat\nthe second one I want a third one but\nnow I ate too much I should have stopped\nat too you see you're no matter\nwhat you\ndo you can do the good things but the\ngood things lead to suffering\ntoo so when you feel like you should\nprocrastinate or you're unmotivated by\nall means pay attention to yourself and\nthen ask yourself what is more important\nto\nme right so the basic problem with\nlistening to the shs and suppressing\nyourself is you decide that this thing\nis more important than this thing that\nother people's opinions are more\nimportant than what I want you're making\na value judgment of them being above you\nleads to\nsuffering next step of spirituality is\nrecognizing that listening to this this\nis actually multiple things there are\nbase\ndesires right these are things that come\nfrom the sense\norgans taste smell sex watching\nsomething emotional engagement and then\nthere is stuff that matters to you there\nis the stuff that you want and there's\nthe stuff that you care about these are\ntwo different\nthings and the more that you live\ntowards what you care\nabout the happier you will\nbe but that stuff isn't easy it's not\nfun it's stuff that you care about\nbecause it helps you feel good at the\nend of the\nday so this is one last thing that I'll\ngive youall in terms of\nNeuroscience so if we look at\nhappiness as as neuroscientists explored\nthe nature of happiness and pleasure in\nour brain they discovered two really\ninteresting things the first thing is\nthey discover the dopamine circuit\npretty quickly in the nucleus accumbent\nthey realized that there's a circuit in\nour brain that when something feels\npleasurable we release dopamine and then\nthat dopamine reinforces that\nbehavior but then they started to wonder\nsomething which is kind of interesting\nwhich is that the subjective feeling of\nHappiness of being content with your\nlife as opposed to chasing some kind of\npleasure is\ndifferent and so they started to look\nfor okay hold on a second is this\ndopamine and they discovered that it's\nnot because you can be pleasurable you\ncan engage in pleasure and be miserable\nieq up for another game or you can even\nbe content and be uncomfortable like I'm\ngoing to go camping and I'm going to\nsleep on the ground and it's kind of\nuncomfortable and I'm kind of hungry and\nI'm kind of thirsty and I'm kind of\ndirty but I'm still content so they're\nlike holy crap well hold on a second how\ndoes that work they discovered something\nreally\nimportant we have hedonics which is\ngoverned by dopamine in the nucleus of\ncombinant and then we have you\ndionic we word what does that mean that\nis a sense of\ncontentment the sense of satisfaction\nthe opposite of the sense of suffering\ncomes from a completely different part\nof the brain than the nucleus accumbent\ncan anyone guess which part of the brain\nit comes\nfrom udem\nmonics udem\nman anyone anyone anyone\nanyone\ncome on chat where does it come\nfrom what do you all\nthink people are saying frontal lobe\npineal gland amydala everyone is right\nand wrong it comes from everywhere\nexcept the nucleus\naccumbent definitely frontal loes\ndefinitely has an emot part it is\neverything else in your\nbrain and so if you look\nat especially some parts of the\nprefrontal cortex orbital frontal\ncortex things like that what you begin\nto see is something really\ninteresting which is that when you are\nactivating from there it\nreduces the impact of the nucleus\nsuccumbent that the more you live a UD\ndionic life the more resistant to\npleasure you become and what do you mean\nby resistant to pleasure what I mean by\nresistant to pleasure is that pleasure\nreinforces your behavior\nless this is\nspirituality to have your behaviors not\nbe controlled by your pleasure or have\nyour behaviors not be controlled by the\navoidance of pain which is is also what\nthe nucleus accumbent does to be content\nin spite of pleasure or\npain this is what spirituality does so\nwe have studies where we will look at\nmeditators and what we tend to see is\nthat the thickness of very Parts various\nparts of their brain and other parts of\ntheir body\nchange and as their brain changes they\nstart to become more UD dionic which is\nGeneral contentment and happiness with\nlife as opposed to pleasure from a\nparticular\noutcome and then people get really\nconfused because they're kind of like\nhold on a second but if I'm no longer\nmotivated by Pleasure or the avoidance\nof\npain what do I do in life in the answer\nis whatever the you want because\nnow you are no longer being driven by\nyour nucleus accumbent the whole problem\nin life is that we are driven by the\navoidance of pain and the pursuit of\npleasure it's a drive y'all feel it in\nyou it's like yeah give me more baby one\ncookie ain't enough son give me two give\nme three and now I feel unhealthy so I I\nwas talking to someone who's using\ndrugs and what they wanted more than\nanything else was to get better at using\ndrugs they wanted more high right they\nwanted to like survive better so they\nstarted like taking care of their body\nso they could tolerate higher Doses and\nget more intense highs that's what we\nwant I don't want to stop eating cookies\nI want to expand my stomach so I can\nhandle another one I want more stamina\nso I can play another\ngame right I want to take Viagra so I\ncan\nagain this is what's happening we want\nmore and more and more these are the\ndrivers and so if you want choice in\nlife you have to separate yourself from\nthat whole circuit which is what\nspirituality is about\nthen you're not driven you choose and if\nwe Circle back to this original person\nwho's like I hate what I'm doing on a\nday-to-day basis this is because your\nlife is being\ndriven you're not\nchoosing yall get\nthat no wonder you're suffering because\nyou have no\nchoice your Leaf being blown on the wind\nand you end up wherever the\nthe wind sends\nyou and then you wonder why am I not\nhappy it's because you don't get to\nchoose\nanything and if we look at so uh last\nthing I'll share with\nyall so if we look at the human mind\nright so remember we were talking about\nhow our reactions to things are\ncontrollable by us and determines\nwhether we suffer or are happy with\nsomething I'll give you all a simple\nexample\nwhether you get fired or you quit your\nsituation is the same you no longer have\nthat\njob\nbut the psychological impact is\ndrastically\ndifferent y'all get\nthat in one case something happened to\nyou you were the\nrecipient and in another case you made a\nchoice situation is the same the\ndifference is in one you get to choose\nand in one you\ndon't exercising choice is one of the\ncore foundations of\nHappiness the problem is that we\nsurrender our choice because we feel\nlike we can't afford to\nchoose but the moment you start making\nchoices is the moment you take\npower like literally that's not a\nmetaphor I'm not talking about\nare like getting in touch with your de\nno I mean like literally like how does a\nhuman being exercise power they do it by\nmaking a choice I'm choosing to do this\ndoesn't matter whether it's good bad or\nstupid I'm still in control as long as\nI'm doing\nit that's why it feels good can you\nimagine how annoying this would\nbe if someone walked up to you and was\nlike doing this to you and they did it\nthree times they're like let me teach\nyou a lesson\nbe annoying but the stimulation\nis the same totally fine when I do it\nhell I am doing it to myself even though\nit's\nstupid totally fine with it look at my\nface do I seem upset are y'all\nupset y'all get\nthat\nquestions okay how do I know what choice\nI want what do I want to be when I grow\nup let's understand\nthis there's a very simple reason why no\none knows what they want\nanymore couple things happen the first\nthing that happened is we have\nexternalized our\nattention so if you look at like how do\nyou know what you want to what you want\nthe more time you spend paying attention\nto something the more you will\nunderstand that thing so for example if\nI'm trying to figure out what spices or\nseasoning or in a particular food the\nmore I pay attention to the food the\nmore I take a couple of bites and I'm\nreally paying attention the more aware I\nam the more I will figure out what's\ngoing on in\nthere so the main\nreason that we don't know what we want\nanymore is because we've stopped paying\nattention to\nourselves because now we have all kinds\nof things right that tell us what we\nwant so much advertising and so many\nstories and Echo Chambers to be a part\nof people talking about their\nrelationships and this is how I do stuff\nat work here's a day in the life of\nsomeone who works at some company that\neverybody wants a job at I come in I get\nmy coffee I do this I go sit in this\nplace and then I go get a massage and\nthen I do a float tank and then I do a\nlittle bit of this I send a couple of\nemails and then I'm\ndone and then you're like wow I want\nthat so now when you say you want that\nwhere did that come from if came from\noutside of\nyou and as long as you are chasing wants\nthat emerge from outside of you you will\nnever be happy because here's what\nhappens that's what we do that's what\ngot us in the first in this problem in\nthe first place is I did everything that\nI thought I should do I did everything\nthat I wanted to but I'm not happy why\nis that it's because those wants come\nfrom the\noutside so if you want to know what you\nwant you have to spend time with\nyourself and why is that hard because\nnowadays we have a different word for\nspending time with yourself we call it\nboredom wait I'm just supposed to sit so\nI was on a plane once okay a flight back\nfrom India I was on my fifth year of\nMonk training and when I prepare for a\nflight you know I prepare for a flight\nI've got some notebooks I've got some\ngood books on meditation and yoga I'm\ngoing to do a little bit of writing I'm\ngoing to do a little bit of reading I\nhave some entertaining stuff I don't\nthink I had like a gaming console or\nanything at that point you know but I\nhad something fun maybe I had a\nsomething to watch I don't I don't\nremember and there was a guy sitting\nnext to me with\nnothing 10hour flight dude was just\nfreeballing it no\nbook nothing to watch just sat there\n stared Straight Ahead made a\nlittle bit of small talk for 10 hours\ndidn't do\n so we've spent less time with\nourselves because we call it\nboredom we used to have one last Bastion\nof solitude and quality time with\nyourself and that was the toilet and\neven this has invaded that at this\npoint\nso when you are bored there'll be all\nkinds of thoughts right so if you think\nabout what is the nature of boredom the\nBor boredom is a punishment that your\nmind gives you to seek dopamine hey I'm\ngoing to make you suffer until I get\nwhat I want so start looking at\nsomething give me social\nmedia give me Twitter give me Tik Tok\ngive give it to me\nnow don't be in the bathroom by yourself\nfor 75 seconds oh my God how are we\ngoing to survive for 75 seconds by\noursel oh my\nGod we don't know how to be\nbored so as you start being bored you\nwill discover yourself as you discover\nyourself you will discover what you want\nand it's not that far\naway the other B big problem that's the\ncore of it but there are other reasons\nwhy this is particularly hard and that\nis as we externalize our attention it's\nwe're not extern izing our attention to\nsomething that is benign we are\nexternalizing our attention to something\nthat creates Echo Chambers to something\nthat breeds insecurities and shows us\nhow unhappy we are and why is that it's\nbecause this is the fun part if they can\nmake you unhappy they can make you buy\nstuff right because oh my God look at\nthis you have\nwrinkles\noh\n right this is something that I\nthink affects women at an alarming rate\nso I've seen this a ton where like the\namount of body dysmorphia that we're\nseeing is staggering all these Beauty\ninfluencers all these people pedaling\nproducts everyone telling women all over\nthe world that you're not attractive\nenough right there's a whole industry\nand men feel not attractive enough as\nwell but when I'm talking about the\nproportion of influencers who are\ntargeting this particular thing\ndefinitely see an epidemic of it in\nwomen people just buying all kinds of\nrandom crap because they feel insecure\nabout the way that they look and a lot\nof this stuff is like scientifically\nlike completely bizarre like it's or not\nbizarre it's false I mean I could be\nwrong and maybe there's new research but\nthe last time I checked just to give you\nall an example rubbing collagen or\ningesting collagen does nothing for your\nbiological collagen production or the\nfirmness of your skin last time I\nchecked maybe there's new\nresearch right everyone's like collagen\ncollagen collagen so collagen can be\nnutritious but it doesn't directly\naffect like wrinkles last time I checked\nwhich was like 10 years\nago but everyone keeps on like coming up\nwith these new products to feed on your\ninsecurities and then you don't know\nwhat you want well why is that it's\nbecause you've been trained to not want\nthings yourself and instead you've been\ntrained by the\ninternet who tells you what you\nwant they know what you want and they\nknow how to make it go away they know\nhow to satisfy it they know how to\nfulfill your desires they're very good\nat creating\nthem hey what are we going to do we're\ngoing to have a social media campaign\neveryone's going to be playing this game\nit's going to be everywhere that you\nlook and then what do you want you want\nthe game here we'll let you buy it no\nlonger $60 now 70 or 80\nand oh my God if you pay a 100 or 120\nyou get to play it a whole 72 hours\nbefore anyone else except for everyone\nelse who plays it who pays an extra\n$120 so we've externalized our attention\nso much that we've forgotten to\nunderstand what we\nwant so someone Boomie is saying there\nis no stop to this it's a scam yeah\nthere is a stop the stop isn't\nhere right you don't have to\nkeep you don't have to gobble it\nup right can y'all believe this people\nwill pay like almost twice the price of\nvideo game they played three days\nearlier oh my\nGod it's like is the game going to\nchange from 3 days pre-release to one\nmonth Post Release and the answer is yes\nyes it\nwill how is it going to change it's\ngoing to get better because it won't be\n full of bugs and you have your\nyou have people paying more money to\nplay an objectively shittier\ngame like what is going\non how did we get\nhere y'all get\nthat\nso AG sadala has it right minus $6 to\nbeta test\nyeah right beta testing used to be\nsomething that you got for\nfree because you're giving them feedback\nbecause the game doesn't work right you\nknow what they did at some point they\nstarted calling it early access and\npaying what people people receiving\nmoney for it and if yall are confused\nabout this at all I strongly recommend\nyou you check out this awesome game\nwhich is going to come out any day now\ncalled Star\nCitizen good\nstuff but in\nreality I can't find\nit so one thing one thing that I did do\nI actually ordered like a $200\njoystick with some throttle thing that\nhas like bazillion buttons so that I\ncould play Star\nCitizen like I I wish I could find it\nbut it's been collecting dust for two\nyears cuz I got it and I was like damn\nlet me get this thing because our\ncitizen is g to come out soon I was like\n what am I get to this thing is so\nimpractical that I can't use it for\nanything\nelse it's like the only thing you can\nplay with it is Star Citizen because\nit's the only game that is that\ncomplicated it's it's got like 32\nbuttons for like one thing for the\nthrottle yeah it's hotas that's\nright yeah gamers in\nchat\nokay um let's move on to AI girlfriend\nbecause sleepy critical is saying I have\na glitch can I accidentally press\nspirituality on the poll can I change my\nanswer to AI girlfriend\nabsolutely let's move\non all\nright AI girlfriends let's go\nchat alrighty the opening message from\nan avatar named Alice described as a\ncurious

to send you a photo you just have to\nask it in the chat like hey Alice can\nyou send me a picture of you and I'll be\nmore than happy to send you\none but of course to bump up from\ntexting to more voice chat as well as\nreceiving sexy and well other sorts of\npictures Alice asked that we become a\npremium member for $9.99 a month wow so\nwe bid her farewell but there are many\nwho are engaging the hill recently\npublished a piece by my next guest data\nscience Professor Liberty vit under the\nheadline AI girlfriends are ruining an\nentire generation of men she wrote The\nFollowing apps have created virtual\ngirlfriends that talk to you love you\nallow you to live out your erotic\nfantasies and learn through data exactly\nwhat you like and what you don't like\ncreating the perfect relationship and\nthat young lonely men quote are choosing\nAI girlfriends over real women meaning\nthey don't have relationships with real\nwomen don't marry them and then don't\nhave and raise babies with them as I've\ndiscussed here before we're living in an\nepidemic of loneliness among young men\nProfessor Scott Galloway told me that\nfailing young men he perceives to be an\nexistential crisis for the country why\nwell Pew found that 63% of young okay so\nlet's pause for now we'll get back to\nthis so the first thing to understand is\nthat people will say things like this\nthey will say AI is AI girlfriends are\nruining a generation of men oh my\nGod first thing to understand is they're\nnot ruining the generation is already\nruined that's why AI girlfriends have a\nare in the market y all get that this is\nnot causing the damage this is the end\nstage of renal failure right this is\nlike the end we're already there the\nruining has already happened which is\nwhy people are vulnerable to this this\nis the other crazy thing I don't know if\nyall saw this but this AI I want youall\nto pay attention Okay so this is going\nto be crazy I want you to look up here\ntell me what you see in the domain name\n cupid. A with a\nK so let me ask y'all a question\nchat if this domain name is cupid. a\nwith a K why isn't it cupid. a with a C\nwhat do yall think it's because that's\nright someone else reserved that domain\nname and has a competing product so if\nyou have something in the market let me\nexplain something to youall the thing in\nthe market is not usually ruining\nsomething it is fulfilling a market need\nthat exists that's how like product\ndevelopment works right we're going to\nlook for a market need and so what\npeople have discovered is that oh\nthere's a generation of lonely men who\nare\n right so we're going to get\nthrough some statistics with this guy\nand we'll see exactly how and why and so\nthe first thing to understand is that AI\nis not ruining a generation of men the\nruining is already happened they're\nalready\nruined if you want me to send you a\nphoto you just have to ask it in the\nchat like one in five American men who\nare unmarried and not in a romantic\nrelationship report not having any close\nfriends and according to Pew there's a\ndecline in the number of single men\nactively seeking relationships or even\ncasual dates currently around 50%\njoining me now is Liberty vit professor\nof data science at Washington so let's\npause for a second and address this too\nso let's understand like okay what's\ngoing on with the ruining of men so what\nis this promise of the\nAI the promise of the AI is oh my God if\nyou try to communicate with me I will\ncommunicate back so everyone is like oh\nmy God they're nudie pcks I don't know\nif yall get\nthis I don't know if y'all been to this\nplace called the internet but finding a\npicture of boobs or penis or whatever\nyour flavor may be is not that difficult\nthey're in fact I know it's shocking\nentire\nwebsites that have more pictures of\nnudity than you can literally look at\nfor the rest of your life there is more\nnakedness out there on the internet on a\nsingle\nwebsite then you will like you literally\nlook at that every second of every day\nfor the rest of your life you'll never\nwatch it all so everyone's like oh my\nGod they're just going to send nudie\npics oh my God that's with ruing men\nbecause men are pivots no what does an\nAI girlfriend do oh my god oh oh\n it's ruining men what does the AI\ngirlfriend do she responds\noh oh there's actually\nsomething out there that is going to\nrespond when someone says something\nSociety is going to fall\napart like what the\n this is how bad things have\nbecome right because what is that men\nare looking for what is it they don't\nget and this this guy did a good job\nhe's like 50% of men I guess are not\neven trying to date we'll get to that in\na second\nand like why not it's\nbecause it doesn't work it's because\nit's painful it's because people aren't\ninterested right so like what am I going\nto do I'm going to throw in the towel\nand here comes the cupid with a k.\na\noffering the forbidden fruit which is\ninteraction with a digital entity\nbecause I can't get interaction with a\nhuman entity and if I can't get that\nthen like hold on a second I wonder like\nwhere what what exactly is ruined how\ndid this happen let's find\nout in St Louis and opinion contributor\nfor the hill so not to be puant at this\ntime of day but are all the needs of\nthese young men able to be facilitated\ntaken care of by AI avatars well you\nhave to think about this word AI that is\nin this it's not a virtual girlfriend\nit's an AI girlfriend so it learns from\nyou learns what you like and what you\ndon't like what kind of pictures you\nlike what kind of pictures you don't\nlike and well not oh my God shocking\nhold on a second chat let's make sure we\nunderstand this\nproperly what is so Insidious about the\nAI\ngirlfriend the Insidious thing about the\nAI girlfriend is that it pays attention\nto\nyou it may give you things it learns\nwhat you like and it adapts oh my God\nthe world is coming to an end because it\npays attention and it does things that\nyou will\nlike oh my God that sounds\ndevastating oh my\ngod let's see more what else is wrong\nwith this not all needs are met that is\nthe next step is actual physical\ngirlfriends uh AI ones for that matter\nand so the next step or the next\nFrontier is one that can meet all of\nyour\nneeds so there's going to be some type\nof pairing between what I've already\nshown to the CNN audience and something\n3D that's going to be your living room\nor bedroom yes I mean that's that is the\nworld we are moving into and as you said\nit's enabling this entire generation of\nyoung men to continue in this loneliness\nepidemic it's it's really the enabler\nfor this to continue hold on a second so\nthis we got to talk about so it is the\nenabler for it to continue so let's\nunderstand this\nokay I think technically it's a correct\nstatement but hold on a second how did\nwe get here in the first place right so\nthis this epidemic was not created by AI\nit may further whatever the problem is\nwhich I think is a fair take it's not\nsomething that I necessarily agree with\nbut how do we get here in the first\nplace because the real root of the\nproblem is how we got here in the first\nplace which is that apparent\nit is\nridiculous for a man to\nbe responded to and also for an external\norganism whether that be an artificial\nintelligence or human being to pay\nattention to what they like and offer it\nto them to adapt right this is these are\nthe two big\ndraws so I mean I kind of with you but I\nthink that we're sort of missing the\npoint Professor what's going on with\nyoung women if this is a trend among\nyoung men is there something similarly\ntaking place with the ladies we don't\nsee that you know with with as you saw\nit's 2 to one the ratio of single men to\nsingle women young women are marrying\nolder men because they want to have\nchildren they have a biological clock\nand so you see them being with older men\nand that is obviously causing huge\nissues with birth decline we've had a\n50% decline over the past 60 years\nbecause women go with older men we also\nsee psychologic wait I don't know that a\n50% birth\ndecline has to do with women choosing\nolder men that doesn't I think it\nprobably has to do with the development\nand spread of birth control and women\nchoosing not to have more\nbabies that younger women they have more\nclose friends they have more wider\ngroups of friends and they are not being\nnearly as affected as young men in this\nsort of Silent epidemic of\nloneliness I have read about incels\ninvoluntarily celibate gu okay so let's\ntalk about this silent epidemic of\nloneliness for a\nsecond I don't think we're in a silent\nepidemic of loneliness I think the\nreason we call it silent is because no\none is listening to the\nscreaming there's a big difference\nbetween\nsilence and turning down the volume on\nsomebody screaming I think we've seen\nthis epidemic for quite a while and it's\nfar from Lonely the only problem is we\njust don't pay attention to it\nright am I crazy there that this is not\nlike\nsilent like am I crazy here that we have\nlike studies and and things like you\nknow the pre PR Research Center and\nwe've got lots of information about how\nmen are lonely am I crazy here that like\nif you look at Tinder\nstatistics we know that you know you\nhave to look at 10,000 people to get\nlike one date if you're lucky like I\ndon't think this is silent I think we\njust haven't been paying attention or\nwhat's actually more Insidious which is\npart of the reason that I think a lot of\ndudes are pieced out is that it's we've\njust been ignoring them and so like at\nsome point you're going to stop talking\nright\nI I I by by the way I think her analysis\nis actually pretty good I just don't\nagree with some of these premises more\nthan anything\nelse guys who are angry about it I think\ntheir argument is that women today are\nless approachable has something happened\nhas something shifted in terms of the\nDynamics the power dynamics between\nyoung men and young women I guess that's\nmy question I think there's certainly an\nargument there that I mean if you look\nat college campuses there's more women\nthan men women are having careers\nthey're having children later so there\nmight be an argument that men need to\nadapt to this change in women but uh\ncalling it women's fault I don't think\nis probably the right way to\ngo yeah so I think that's a great\nstatement I didn't really interpret that\nas calling it women's fault but let's\nunderstand something\nokay so for the dudes out there\nchange in expectations completely agree\nbut something has very important which I\nthink for the most part is positive has\nhappened with women over the last 50\nyears okay and maybe I'm about to get\nbanned but let's\nsee so what's happened is that in the\npast if you were a woman living in this\nworld in order to have your needs met\nyou had to be in a romantic\nrelationship okay same same was true for\na man so like human beings were more\ndependent on each other so this isn't\neven specific to women so what's\nhappened as any part of society becomes\nmore independent and therefore less\ndependent on another part of society now\nthe whole equation\nchanges it's not I don't need you to\nmake me happy anymore now the question\nis does a relationship at all or\nrelationship with you is it more trouble\nthan it's worth so I think one of the\nbiggest problem that a lot of men don't\nget they're like oh my God like women\nwon't give me a chance and it's like no\nI think women frequently will give men\nlots of chances it's just sometimes they\nend up dating a lot of\nManchild and it's just not worth it like\nit's just not worth it to be in this\nrelationship I do not get more out of it\nthan I put in the amount of stress that\nI have to deal with is not worth what I\nget out of it now this equation used to\nbe really different when we we had sort\nof more divided gender roles and you\nkind of like needed the man to make\nmoney right so that's what the man\nbrought to the\nrelationship so now the equation has\nchanged it's not she's not like because\nthe the thing is this what's really wild\nthis is what's really scary for a lot of\nmen is that I think a lot of women are\nactually okay being by themselves they\ndon't need you anymore so now the\nquestion becomes if you want to be in a\nrelationship you have to like offer\nsomething\nsubstantial right and and that's like it\nit's kind of weird but it's not like one\nperson is to blame or one gender is to\nblame or anything like that I think\nthat's very harmful like because that's\nnot how it that's not how relationship\nWorks a relationship is between two\npeople and so anytime you blame the\nother people oh my God women I don't is\nthere an epidemic of loneliness\nabsolutely is it silent I don't think so\nhas this been going on for a while yeah\ndo men get screwed in a lot of ways\nabsolutely but I don't think it's the\nfault of women that is a logical step\nwhich I think we need to be very careful\nabout\nmaking if you really want to know what's\ngoing on the world is\nchanging and the basic problem is that\nthe expectations that we have for men\nare not\nchanging so if you look at the research\non\nperfectionism perfectionism has\nincreased by about 30 to 40% in the last\n30\nyears perfectionism has increased in men\nmore than women and the perfectionism\nthat men experience is this very\nspecific kind of perfectionism of I am\ngoing to be\nunable to live up to the standards that\nare expected of me this is a gigantic\nepidemiologic shift a 30 to 40% increase\nof human primarily men or more than 50%\nit's increasing for everybody more men\nwho believe that I can no longer fulfill\nthe expectations that the world sets on\nme and that's true right why do people\nfeel that way because it's usually\npeople feel away because there's some\ntruth to it so I'll give you all a\nsimple\nexample so women have started earning\nmore good that's a good thing we want\nequality generally speaking I'm in favor\nof that okay now here's the interesting\nthing is that there's an attitude that I\nwant my male partner to make more than\nme so if you ask I think the majority of\nwomen they will say\nthat now things are a little bit tricky\nbecause there are more women in college\nmore women get Advanced degrees there\nare more women in medical school right\nso a lot of these women who want to\nmarry doctors like the pool of male\ndoctors is shrinking so now the question\nbecomes do you want to adjust your\nexpectations and this is the problem\nthat men are experiencing is that\nthere's no adjustment of expectations\neven though the world has\nchanged so I'll give you all another\ngood example of this people are saying\nlike Okay like men need to be\nemotionally available number one thing I\nsee when I'm trolling around on my\nsingle friends dating\nprofiles of what women are looking for\ntop thing that floats to the surface\nmaybe this is just a subset of people I\nhang out with is emotionally available\nmen right because men should get in\ntouch with their\nemotions but if you really look at how\nwe judge men for getting in touch with\ntheir emotions it's not very good and\nyou may say no Dr K like no we're like\ntotally fine accepting men's emotions no\nwe are not we are okay accepting one\nemotion from men which is sadness now\nthankfully in the last 30 years it's\nokay for a dude to cry\nbut do we accept a a man's\nanger no that's what we call toxic\nmasculinity men are allowed to feel\nemotions except for anger because when\nyou feel anger you're a toxic man toxic\nmasculinity bad man for feeling anger\nyou should be crying instead how dare\nyou get upset how dare you express\nanger what about\nshame oh as a man I feel pathetic I\ndon't know if this is ever going to work\nout I'm so sorry I'm a piece of crap oh\nmy God this guy is so emotionally needy\nI can't handle this it's not my\nresponsibility to patch up this man and\nthe crazy thing is you're not wrong\nthere right if that's what you're saying\nit isn't your responsibility no single\nhuman being is responsible for fixing\nanother human\nbeing and this is where we come back to\nis it worth it for a woman to be in a\nrelationship or not because a lot of\ntimes what relation ship for women mean\nis since we've got a society of screwed\nup\nmen what that means is that there's a\ncertain amount of like you got to play\nmedic right so if you're like a woman in\na relationship because of something\naround parenting and we'll get to some\nof these macro factors in a second it's\nlike you got to be 50% medic and 50%\ngirlfriend and some women especially now\njust don't want to sign up for that\nright like there's some of y'all that\nwant to be a savior and and heal someone\nwhich is cool also leads to problems in\nrelationships but this is a problem so\nwe're okay with men being sad thankfully\nbut we're not okay with them expressing\nother\nemotions because those are those are\nweak those are toxic masculine\nespecially the anger one that one's the\none that's the\ncraziest it's also the emotion that men\nhave the most access to so when we say\nwe're going to emotionally accept men\nwe're going to emotionally accept a\nminority of your emotional\nexperience right so just to give you all\nan example if you have a relationship\nwith there two people and one person\ngets angry and one person\ncries what is the Judgment that we place\non those negative emotions what we\nalways do is we value the sadness over\nthe anger we don't say that you have a\nright to be angry if you're angry and\nthis person is crying you did something\nbad we place a value on sadness that is\nabove anger and if two negative emotions\nCollide sadness always\nwins and then if we look at\ndifferentials in the way that different\ngenders express emotions women are more\nlikely to cry and men are more likely to\nget angry and this is why men are scared\nto go to coup's therapy because they are\noutgunned because we don't treat all\nnegative emotions the same we treat the\nones that are masculine more\npredominantly masculine as negative and\nthis by the way also screws\nwomen because the worst thing that you\ncan be is a woman who expresses a\nmasculine\nemotion that's the\nworst we treat men harshly for it but we\ntreat women even\nworse because now suddenly you're a cold\n at work because you got pissed the\nsame way that a male colleague\ndid we do not allow women to even\nexpress\nanger right and if you're like a woman\nand you get mad at someone and someone\nelse starts crying and it's like oh my\nGod how heartless are you oh my God\nthere's a word right we we we use the\nword we use the word cold we use\nthe word heartless there's a particular\nidea that we have around\npeople and so this isn't like anti-men\nor anti- women or anything like that\nlike I don't think that that's\nproductive let's understand what's\nactually going\non but this is where we get to these\nthis issue of expectations because if\nwe're talking about equality equality\nmeans equality equality means are you\nokay with the stay-at-home dad are you\nokay being the sole bread winner and\nworking two jobs and doing overtime\nwhile your husband goes to the gym and\ntakes care of your\nkids as a dude can you put that on your\ndating\nprofile not interested in a career not\ninterested in financial Independence I'm\nlooking for someone to take care of me\nbecause I am beautiful and I deserve it\nlike I'd love to see an experiment where\nsomeone actually did that and we'd see\nwhat\nhappens but the basic problem is that\nthe world has changed but our\nexpectations of men have not and as a\nresult there's a gap that makes it\nimpossible for men to live up to\nexpectations and then we have this other\nparallel thing going on which is that it\nyou and this is where things kind of get\nconnected so let me just explain right\nso hopefully I'll see this but and this\nwhole point about what do you bring to\nthe relationship so what men you need to\nbring more to a relationship now than\nyou used to because the woman doesn't\nneed 50k a year because she can make 50k\na year herself she can to add value to\nthe relationship you need to bring 100K\nyou need to bring emotional availability\nyou need to bring all this other stuff\nthat we were never taught how to bring\nthat's the other\nthing right so as men like what are we\ntaught we're taught that hey if you feel\nbad the only only thing you're allowed\nto express is anger you can't cry that's\nshameful you know and your value is\ndetermined by what you bring to the\ntable right 6 feet 6 in six figures two\nof those you probably can't control so\nyou focus on\nmoney and this is a problem that women\nhad worse I think a couple years ago so\nback when like and we still see it like\nwomen and who are having babies later\nbecause they can't afford to have them\nearlier because they have a boss who's\nalso a woman and I swear most of my\nfemale patients most of the gender\ndiscrimination based on my small sample\nsize I'm not citing this\nscientifically the majority of\ngender-based discrimination that my Pat\nmy female patients have experienced in\nthe workplace is from other\nwomen and at the top of the list the\nmost\nresentful piece of gender-based\ndiscrimination that I have seen against\nwomen in the workplace the most\ntoxic is I had to wait until 36 before I\nhad my first child how dare you think\nabout having a child at the age of\n25 you don't get to do that I made the\nsacrifice and since I made the sacrifice\nyou're going to make it\ntoo so\ntoxic the whole point is that we were\nsupposed to make things better for\nwomen so that they could make different\nchoices it's not to propagate the cycle\nof\nabuse right and if if those of y'all I\nknow like 70% of our audience is dudes\nthis is something that y'all need to\nunderstand right like yeah we're\nas dudes because of loneliness but it's\nnot like women have it easy they made\nprogress but it's not like they have it\neasy I don't think anyone in life has it\neasy I mean maybe some people who knows\nI'm sure objectively people have it\neasier I don't think it's helpful We're\nAll in This\nTogether the next thing to understand is\nwhy are men lonely in the first place\nlike what happened so I think this has a\ncouple of interesting things the first\nis at some point I really think the root\nof this is really bizarre is when we\nstarted demonizing\nhomosexuality so when I was growing up\nin the 80s and 90s the biggest insult\nyou could get was to be called Gay\nwas like oh my God and so when we\nstarted demonizing especially\nhomosexuality what started happening is\nmen stopped being able to touch each\nother right which even if you're\nlistening to this now if you had an like\nan instinctive reaction dudes touching\neach other dick if you had that kind of\nreaction you're conditioned just like I\nam right it's a completely benign\nstatement there's nothing sexual about\nit but we sexualized it we sexualized\nall Manon man contact and that too man\non\nman right I can hear the thoughts in my\nhead as I react to them as I say these\nthings so now men become dependent on\nwomen for\ntouch and Men start isolating from each\nother that with the destruction of third\nspaces right so that combines with\ntechnology to where now we're doing\neverything online so we have even less\nconnection with other people especially\nmen and then somewhere in that vein we\nalso saw a loss of positive male role\nmodels so if you look at this is kind of\na stretch but it's cool research so here\nwe\ngo so if you look at delinquent Behavior\namongst male elephants because male\nelephants who are adolescence can be\nreal\n the number one thing that\nshapes whether that male\nelephant learns how to behave properly\nis the presence of a senior\nmale the older men put the young men in\ncheck this has disappeared from our\nsociety I don't know why but positive\nmale role models I have all kinds of\nideas why so one thing is that once\nagain we're very very quick to judge men\nI know this sounds crazy who are like\nwho will touch a\nchild right so like when I go to a\nplayground if there's like a\nsix-year-old boy who's crying I can't\npick him up and hug him and give him a\nkiss on the\nhead even though that's what my parental\ninstinct tells me to\ndo so we don't allow men to touch boys\nwhich there may be good reasons for but\neven if there are good reasons for\nthat we still have to deal with the\nconsequences of making that change\nright because sexual predation is a real\nthing and most of the sexual predation\nthat was happening that was not we were\nnot aware of I don't know about most but\nwas especially like we're talking about\ntaking advantage of young boys and and\noften times adult men doing that so like\nthere's a reason why we're worried about\nthat right that's not we're not making\nthat crap\nup and so what happened is as men is we\nwe stopped having solid relationships\nwith like role models we stopped being\nphysically in touch with each other or\nemotionally in touch with each other and\nthere's some amount of equality that has\nhappened which have made women less\ndependent on us so now what happens if\nyou're a dude is you really have to\nbring something to the table you can't\n autopilot that\nanymore that on top of unrealistic\nexpectations which have not adjusted\nresults in the crisis of men that we\nhave\ntoday which is that I can try my hardest\nand it won't be enough I'm doing it\nalone because I can't connect to other\npeople I have no place to connect to\nother\npeople and the primary result of this is\ntoo much internal\nemotion and that internal emotion is not\nsomething that I'm allowed to\nshare and that's what the problem is and\nnow you take a dude like this\nand you offer him an AI girlfriend and\nwhat do you expect him to\ndo so I'm\nalone people don't respond when I\ncommunicate with them oh my God so\naddictive someone responds\nback people but don't adapt to what I'm\nsaying there's not a silent epidemic\nunwillingness we've been screaming for a\nwhile and no one has been paying\nattention male suicide rates have been\nfour times what women female SU iide\nrates are for like at least 100\nyears how's that\nsilent and what we end up with is\nsomeone who wants nothing more than\nsomeone to respond and someone to pay\nattention and heaven forbid adapt to\nwhat I want in\nlife and when we say that this is going\nto enable or ruin men it's not going to\nenable or ruin I mean maybe it'll enable\nsome but the ruin has already happened\nwe're already here they're already this\ndesperate for a connection to anything\nout there that they'll take something\ndigital and\nfake this is how bad we are and so the\nquestion is like okay even if you say\nthat AIS are going to enable it what are\nwe going to do are we going to stop\ndoing AIS are we going to fix the\nproblem well that's the that's the\nreason the problem hasn't gotten\nfixed because no individual person is\nresponsible for it right if a man is\nangry I don't need to listen to them I\ncan block\nthem if a man is ashamed of themselves\nI'm not responsible for fixing\nit if you are a woman who's in their\nlate 20s there is a decent chance that\nyou have already had one child even if\nyou've never had a kid you've had a baby\nbrother you've had a\ndad you've been parentified because your\ndad is infantilized\nright you've already been a parent and\nwhat you want in a partner is not\nanother\nkid but here's the thing it's not the\nman's fault that they're a child totally\nfair it's also not your responsibility\nas a woman to fix them also totally fair\nso now the question is what do we\ndo and this is where what I think we\nneed to do as a society is everybody\nneeds to take responsibility the men\nneed to take responsibility\nthe men who are not alone need to take\nresponsibility and women need to take\nresponsibility non-binary people\ngrandparents whoever the\n because when there is a part of our\nsociety that is suffering one thing that\nmakes me proud to be human is thankfully\nhuman beings usually are involved in\nhelping the people who are\ndowntrodden the story of our race right\nand if you look at the Equal Rights\nmovement if you look at you know the\nCivil War in the United States you had\npeople on the opposite side supporting\nyou had men supporting the Civil Rights\nMovement you have men who are feminists\nthese are good\nthings this is how it should be any part\nof our society that is downtrodden or\nneglected should get the help of\neverybody else even though it is not\ntheir responsibility this is a choice we\nhave to\nmake and the crazy thing this is what I\nthink really puts the pin in\nit is that there's one class of people\nwho we Society expect to fix their own\nproblems without help and that is men\nand that is the root of the problem\nbecause everyone else deserves\nhelp but right now there is\na dialogue going on that since men are\nprivileged in some ways which is true by\nthe way right there are real scientific\nThere's real scientific evidence that\npeople that men are privileged in a lot\nof\nways but since they are privileged they\ndon't need our\nhelp and so you can look at like the\npercentage of white men in the United\nStates who are CEOs but they're also\nlike 99% of brick layers are like white\nmen the majority of people who suffer\nworkplace injuries are men there are all\nkinds of other things like the privilege\nis there and even if you take a poor\nwhite dude who gets pulled over by a cop\ncompared to a poor black dude the poor\nwhite dude I believe I'm not an expert\non the research so correct me if I'm\nwrong here but I think the poor white\ndude is going to have better outcomes\nthat exists but that doesn't mean that\nthat dude's life is\neasy right and this is the key Nuance\nthat I don't think we see enough of that\nyou can have some advantages in life and\nstill need help\nthat advantages in one area of your life\ndon't make it easy in other areas of\nyour life and it's true of women as well\nso there are for example womenonly\nscholarships and yet women are already\nmore than 50% of people who go to\ncollege and just because that is true\nand that women may have an advantage\nwhen it comes to admissions or\nscholarships or whatever doesn't mean\nthat it isn't dangerous to to be a woman\nso if you want to talk about a real big\nsource of male privilege it is the sense\nof\nsafety so just being existing as a woman\nin the world today there is a\nfundamental unsafe about it which is\njust what I've observed right so I'm not\na woman so I don't really know but I\njust kind of noticed that when I have\nmale patients and I have female patients\nthe male patients like aren't worried\nabout being sexually assaulted on a\nday-to-day\nbasis\nthey don't get worried about being\nsexually assaulted when they're walking\ndown the street and it's dark at night\nand those fears are\nreal and so this is the problem is we\ndon't really understand that like you\nknow we're not we're not like it's not a\nvideo game where everything balances out\nand you've got 40 points to distribute\ninto various advantages and\ndisadvantages that's not how it\nworks and it's not like some people just\nhave it I mean some people do have it\nbetter but I think when we're talking\nabout classes of people Everyone suffer\nin a particular\nway and what we really need to do is\ninstead of making it a competition where\nlike you know men die more in workplace\ninjuries so\ntherefore this thing about women we\nshould not take seriously that needs to\nstop we need to stop trying to combine\nall the issues into one\nequation that comes to like perfect\nequality and instead what we need to do\nis listen to whoever is saying I'm\nhaving a hard\ntime and take that person's\nseriously right and that's where like\nbelieve women and me too came from\nbecause for a long time by the way there\nwas not a silent epidemic of sexual\nassault towards\nwomen the same way that there is not a\nsilent epidemic of loneliness there's\nbeen screaming from the rooftops we just\nchose not to\nlisten and now the real test of\nsociety is going to be can we take all\nthe\nlessons that we have learned from the\nprogress of women and apply those things\nto\nmen that's the real question that I see\ntoday because thankfully they've\nactually they did the hard part they\ntrailblazed and fought for equality so\nnow we know what equality looks like and\nare we going to continue to apply\nit\nokay well that's all the time we have\nfor today that went fast I'm just trying\nto\nthink and I I I think the researcher is\ngood by the way I hope I didn't like you\nknow get pissed at her I don't blame her\nI think it's a common mistake that a lot\nof people are making is like there's\nthis idea of a silent it's not\nsilent\njust booked my first coaching session\nyesterday it starts this Sunday and I'm\nreally looking forward to it thank you\nfor what you're providing thanks a\nlot D D dat of that we appreciate you\ngiving it a shot so by the way you know\nif y'all are like if y'all resonate with\nthis approach everything that we've\ntalked about today highly recommend yall\ncheck out like our resources right so\nthat's why we built this stuff so I sit\nhere and I rant and I rave and I'm\nbased but then like one of my key one of\nthe key things that drives me is that\nproblems cannot just be talked about you\ngot to do something about\nit and that's why we built the resources\nthat we have that's why we do streams\nand stuff like this is like if you're a\nman who's struggling with these\ndifficulties if you're a woman who's\ntrying to figure out hey I don't know if\nlike I even want to be in a relationship\nbecause the people I keep on dating suck\nwhich by the way one reason that\neveryone has such bad experiences in\ndating is really simple it's because the\nbad apples move around the\nmost right so you don't actually have a\nfair Shake it's just that if there's an\n out there who's sending dickpics\nthe is going to send dickpics to\nas many people as he can or she I\nsuppose you know because we're being\ngender\ninclusive and so the the problem is that\nif you look at the worst actors right so\nif you look for example like the\nsomething that I hear a lot from dudes\nthat are\nfrustrated is chicks that friend zone\nright and this person thinks they're\nfriends so she has like 15 friends so\nyou have 15 dudes who are like oh my God\nall women friend zone me no it's just\none woman who likes to have a lot of\nfriends and is making a lot of friends\ncompletely skews your perspective on the\nflip side you have who send\ndickpics and it's like the\nspreads himself out more\nthat combined with Echo Chambers where\neveryone's like oh you had this\nexperience I had this experience too and\nsince both of I us had this experience\nnow it becomes a\nfact and so there's all kinds of other\nthings going on with like Echo Chambers\nand the way that we share information\nand what kind of information gets\npropagated right and the reason that a\nlot of this toxic masculinity stuff gets\npropagated is because a lot of dudes are\nlonely and resentful and there's really\nonly one space that validates that which\nis the toxic masculine space because if\nyou try to enter a normal space as a\nlonely or resentful man and you share\nyour feelings you're G to get\nbanned because you're toxic\nmasculine you're not allowed to suffer\nor the way that you suffer is triggering\nwhich by the way is\ntrue right so the other thing that we're\nreally doing by shooting ourselves in\nthe foot as lonely dudes is we ingest\nall of this toxic masculinity crap and\nthen we start regurgitating\nit and that stuff is like harmful to\nothers which is why they ban us and once\nthey ban us then we're like oh my God no\none's listening to me and so then you go\nand you go to the toxic masculinity\nbuffet and you start shoveling that\ninto your mouth and then you show up\nsomewhere else and and it comes vomiting\nout and then you get\npersecuted which then makes you feel\ngood because human beings love being\npersecuted it makes us feel good about\nour negative\nexperiences cuz heaven forbid you\nactually say oh my God the reason I'm\nlonely in life is because of something\nthat I did wrong it's way easier to say\nit's because the world discriminates\nagainst\nme\nanyway so we can talk about this stuff\nwe can rant and ra but definitely this\nis why we designed our services the way\nthat we did right so if yall are\ninterested in like what to do about it\nif you want to DIY it check out Dr K's\nguide to mental health we have a lot of\ninformation about like all the stuff we\ntalked about about spirituality so we've\ngot like you know a whole course on that\nstuff where we teach the fundamentals of\nwhere does desire come from how do you\ncontrol your thoughts all this kind of\nstuff is in there and then if y'all are\ninterested in more like tackling these\nissues of what am I doing with my life\nhow do I find out what I want how do I\ndiscover my purpose how do I work on\nmotivation that's what our coaching\nprogram is\nfor and what I literally did when I\ndesigned the coaching program and I\ndesigned it from the ground up and I\nwork with just about every single one of\nour coaches for a period of eight\nweeks and the reason that we do that is\nI noticed as a psychiatrist that my\npatients needed help in ways that I was\nnot\ntrained because as psychiatrists we\nfocus on\npathology we focus on fixing what is\nbroken not building what is good now a\nlot of good therapists will be able to\ndo that but it's not a core part of our\ntraining it's the exception and not the\nrule\nso coaching is not a substitute for\nmental health treatment absolutely we're\nnot just saying that as a medical\ndisclaimer legal disclaimer it's like\nliterally the design is different the\ndesign is to help you achieve as opposed\nto fix something it's not about healing\nit's about goal setting achievement\nbuilding something discovering who you\nare discovering what you want it's\ndifferent ball\ngame and if you're struggling with\nthings like relationships the other\nthing that we like and part of the\nreason that our outcomes are so good is\nbecause it's based on the peer support\nmodel and the peer support model\nsupposes they have this\nassumption that having someone who knows\nwhat it's like to grow up in your\nworld is worth more than having an\nexpert so a psychiatrist who is\n65 may not be able to help you as much\nas a dude who is four years older than\nyou and and had their life be nowhere\nand has put it together peer support and\nwe sort of know this scientifically as\nwell if you look at things like\nalcoholics and Anonymous as a\npsychiatrist I will do Psychotherapy\nwith my patient will prescribe certain\nmedications and then I will tell them to\ngo to AA meetings because there is a\ndifferent kind of value that I cannot\ngive\nthem and we know scientifically that\nthat value is quite powerful and\narguably even more powerful than the\nexpert\nopinion there's studies that suggest\nthat more people become sober through AA\nthan they do through seeing\npsychiatrists but that's a bold\nstatement to\nmake and so if yall like want to work on\nthis stuff and the last thing that I'll\nsay is the reason that we developed the\nway that it we did is I know what it's\nlike to be on the internet I know what\nit's like to watch stuff and passively\nreceive it and even when the speaker is\nhyped up feel good about\nit but there's a big difference between\nwatching crap day after day after day\nand actually signing up for something so\nthat you will be done with it in 12\nweeks there's a big difference between\nsaying I want to learn the guitar I want\nto learn how to play the guitar and\nsigning up for someone to teach you\nguitar for 12 weeks the main advantage\nthat we offer I I believe that y'all can\nget there on your own I really do I\nhope but the question is the reason that\nwe designed the curriculum that we the\nway we did which is also a little bit\ndifferent from therapy is we're focused\non rapid sustainable\noutcomes so the question is because this\nwas my experience when I was up\nin life is that life was passing me by\nso I could DIY it and it would take me\ntwo and a half years but I would lose so\nmuch time and that's literally the\nreason that I left Academia because I\nhad this two awesome job offers on the\ntable just nice track to become the\nworld's expert in video game addiction\nI got an offer from someone who said\nhey we'll build you a rehab and you can\nrun it and we'll give you three years to\nbe profitable we'll cover your losses\nfor three years come and run this rehab\nand do this research on video game\naddiction and I was like people can't\nwait that long 10 15 years from now when\nI research everything and figure\neverything out people's lives are going\nto be over there's a kid right now who's\n17 years old who's going to be 27 by the\ntime I'm done and then I'm going to\npresent them with the answers and it's\ntoo\nlate so I felt a lot of desperation of\nevery moment that was passing me by when\nI was in my early\n20s another day lost a day of my 20s the\ngood years of my life I'm falling\nfurther and further behind and I'm\nmissing out on more and more\nopportunities more and more doors are\nclosing so part of the reason I designed\na coaching program is because literally\nlike it if yall could wait I would see\neach and every one of y'all myself if we\nhad a thousand years wouldn't need to\ndevelop a coaching program at all just\njoin the wait list we'll get around to\nyou\neventually but the problem here is\ntime the problem here is that you need\nhelp now or it's not even that you need\nit but you could benefit from it and\nthat's what those are the central ideas\nthat have been baked into what we\ncreated here\nit's the reason we\nstream it's the reason we have a Discord\nserver because y'all can't afford to\nwait and I'm with you there and that's\nwhere like a lot of people like people\nlike I've had you know Psychotherapy\nsupervisors who will be like patients\nneed to learn to be patient they need to\nlearn like it's not going to happen\ntomorrow then I'm like when is it going\nto happen you don't know you can't know\nwhich is like technically true but it's\nlike what the man are we going to\nsit around for two years and wait for\nsomething to\nhappen and so I think one of the\nweaknesses of the field of therapy is\nthat we're we are not rigorous on\nimproving those outcomes the way that we\nare in product development you can look\nat something like Amazon and Amazon is\nlike how can we get 1% better how can we\nget 1% better 1% better 1% better 1%\nbetter we see it in the video game\nindustry in a nasty way how can we\nsqueeze in another microtransaction let\nme stuff this other microtransaction let\nme stick it up there butt just a little\nthey could pack a little bit more in\nthere just one more\nmicrotransaction they're ruthless with\nImprovement the field of therapy doesn't\ndo that yet we really need to that's\nwhat we're trying to do with hii so we\neven teach therapists\nnow but then the question is like for\ny'all like this is what we've tried to\nbuild we've gone through seven or eight\ncurriculum revamps in our coaching\nprogram in four\nyears youall believe that eight\ncurriculum\nrevisions two curriculum revisions a\nyear on average and why is that it's\nbecause we can get a little bit better\nwe can get a little we can get a little\nbit better that's why we get feature\nthat the American Psychiatric\nassociation is a digital innovator in\nmental health it's because of our\noutcomes right our pilot study and this\nis what's awesome is because of the\ninternet pilot studies are like 20\npeople 50 people 90 people our coaching\npilot had\n1,397 or 79 people I think 13 or300 for\nsure I think it's 79 or 97 so we've got\nbig effect sizes too so it works at\nscale and we've gone from eight coaches\nto well over a 100 I think over 120 and\nthe reason is because like it works well\nso if yall are interested in that stuff\ndefinitely check it\nout and if that's not your cup of tea\ntotally fine right we're going to do our\nbest to help you even if that's not your\ncup of tea and in fact the majority of\nthe work that we do is to help the 90%\nof y'all that aren't going to do\ncoaching because we recognize that not a\nlot of people are going to do it\nunfortunate for them but you\nknow\nokay and huge shout out by the way to\nall of our coaches who are just\nphenomenal I think we we see shout outs\non Reddit and stuff all the time but\nthey're really just a fantastic group of\nindividuals just to give youall one one\nlast\nso we review about 600 applications for\nlike eight spots in coaching or 800\napplications or something like that so\nthe the acceptance rate is like\n1% and so we we really do take the\nbest and like the best isn't has a\nparticular degree or has a has a\nparticular degree or or has a particular\nGPA the best is weird I don't even\nunderstand what our recruiting stuff is\nhow we choose to accept people into a\nparticular class but it's good it's\npeople who get it that's the what we\nreally look for so there are people who\nare philosophy majors and people who are\nphds and people who are dropouts and\npeople who are\nnurses and people who are pro\nGamers right we we want to take y'all\nand give y'all a set of scientifically\nvalidated evidence-based techniques so\nthat you can help other\npeople all\nright I know we didn't get to emotional\nneglect but hopefully y'all are\nsatisfied with the spirituality and the\nAI girlfriend\nstuff and we will see you tomorrow\nthat's the other reason we're kind of\nsticking with our time today we're see\nyou all tomorrow because we're talking\nto Destiny and I got to save something\nfor\nthat all right y'all take care I don't\nknow I still don't know how to raid\nsomething on YouTube so GG peace out and\nI guess watch our latest Youtube upload\num and even though we're not going to be\nstreaming much next week I'm going to be\nlike on a podcast and things like that\nwe're going to have regular uploads I\nhave a couple of really awesome videos\nI'm excited about that I'm going to try\nto film over the weekend so definitely\ncheck those out"
