    "transcript": "this is the introvert\ncurse you're hanging out with someone\nwhat and then some part of your brain is\nlike this guy's having fun at a social\nevent doesn't he know he's an introvert\nand then we unplug the social battery\nand then you feel drained so if we look\nat people nowadays everybody is an\nintrovert why because social\ninteractions are\nexhausting so let me ask youall a\nquestion what does an extrovert\nwith social anxiety look\nlike can extroverts get social anxiety\nhow does that work so it turns out that\neveryone thinks that they're an\nintrovert and chances are that half of\ny'all at least are wrong okay so there's\na lot of common misconceptions about\npersonality in introversion and\nextroversion and people sort of think\nthat oh if I get drained by social\ninteractions that means I'm an introvert\nwell it turns out that things are a\nlittle bit more complicated than that\nlet's take a look at some science happy\nnow tired later extroverted and\nconscientious Behavior are related to\nimmediate Moon gains but to later\nfatigue extroverted Behavior correlates\nwith being socially tired later wow\nthat's kind of weird right that's\ninteresting so this is what a lot of\npeople don't understand if you get tired\nfrom social interactions that does not\nmean that you are an\nrovert what we're going to learn today\nis first of all how introversion and\nextroversion there's a lot more\ncomplicated stuff about social anxiety\nand once we understand why we actually\nget drained from social interactions and\nextroverts by the way get drained from\nsome social interactions more than\nintroverts do then we'll understand what\nis the nature of introversion\nextroversion how does my social battery\nget drained and we'll also give you one\nkey thing whether you're an introvert or\nan extrovert to not\nget drained when you act uh interact\nsocially so we'll teach you how to have\nmore energy when you approach social\ninteractions okay hey y'all I want to\ntake a moment to talk about HG groups\nour group coaching experience here at\nhealthy gamer is designed to help people\nwith the problems of the digital age\nproblems like social isolation a lack of\npurpose or simply feeling overwhelmed\ngroups are a place that will help you\nlearn the skills that are necessary for\nSuccess that aren't really taught\nanywhere else skills like how to Be an\nEffective listener and communicate\neffectively skills like how to be\nvulnerable so that you can allow\nyourself to authentically connect with\nanother human being skills like\ncultivating self-awareness so you\nunderstand where your motivation comes\nfrom but also where self-sabotaging\nBehavior comes from and so if yall are\ninterested in learning more about groups\nand interested in learning a little bit\nabout how you can develop competence and\nconfidence to move forward in life check\nout the Link in the description below so\nmisconception number one everyone thinks\noh my god extroverts get energy from\nsocial interactions and if I feel\ndrained that means I'm an introvert\nincorrect so what we tend to find is\nthat even extroverts become fatigued\nfrom social interaction the other really\ninteresting thing is that if you look at\nnegative work spaces so people where\npeople where work spaces where people\ngossip so a lot of y'all think oh I'm an\nintrovert and I hate this [ __ ]\npolitical everyone's gossiping all the\ntime and it's so exhausting it turns out\nthat if you are an introvert you are\nactually\nresistant to workplace gossip and\nactually additionally extraversion\nstrengthens the main effect of negative\nworkplace gossip on emotional\nexhaustion right so this is bizarre this\nmeans that actually extroverts are more\nsensitive to social things and that\nnegative workplace gossip actually gets\nnegatively impacted by extroversion so\nsome of y'all out there may actually be\nextroverts but you just get tired from\nsocial interactions and that's because\nthere is a simplistic view I know this\nsounds crazy but as we get more and more\n60-second Tik tocks that have no Nuance\nin them we start to get these like black\nand white perceptions of what\nintroversion and extroversion are this\nmeans I am an introvert this means I'm\nan extrovert no it doesn't half of y'all\nare introverts and half of y'all are\nextroverts and on top of that\n87.5% of y'all are basically somewhat in\nthe middle and it shouldn't gigantically\nimpact you there are other things going\non let's understand this so if I'm\nsaying hold on a second if I get\nexhausted from social interactions does\nthat mean I'm not an introvert yes there\nis even some evidence that being an\nextrovert causes certain kinds of social\ninteractions to be more to affect you\nmore so the key thing about extra verion\nis you are more connected to your social\nenvironment so if you're if you're\n[ __ ] in a toxic workplace and you\nfeel exhausted in going to work every\nday it doesn't mean you're an introvert\nit just that me actually means you could\nbe an extrovert who's just more\nsensitive to the workplace Dynamics\nintroversion means that you're less\nconnected to workplace stuff or social\ninteractions okay that's number one\nsecond thing is if we look at that\nfatigue paper that even if you get a\nmood lift you will be fatigued 3 hours\nlater and that finding is actually\nsomewhat independent of whether you are\nan in introvert or extrovert so that\nsounds kind of weird because or weren't\nwe talking about extroversion in some\nway so if you look at extroverted\nBehavior extroverted Behavior leads to a\nmood lift followed by fatigue 3 hours\nlater and whether you are your\npersonality is more of an introvert or\nextrovert it actually doesn't matter so\nso this is the key thing a lot of that\nexhaustion does not have to do with\npersonality and this is really important\nto understand because\npersonality is relatively fixed it can\nchange some over time but it's kind of\nwho you are the key thing to understand\nwhat a lot of people don't understand\nabout exhaustion and social interaction\nit doesn't have to do with personality\nit has to do with what's your in your\nhead at that moment your behaviors in\nthe way that you frame social situations\nso even introverts can learn how to\nenjoy social\ninteractions so if this isn't the case\nif we're sort of saying that it doesn't\nmatter that I'm an extrovert or an\nintrovert social interactions are going\nto be exhausting for everybody and maybe\neven social interactions are more\nexhausting for extroverts in some\nsituations why does everyone feel so\nsocially exhausted and why does everyone\nthink that they're an introvert so\nthere's a second thing going\non what socially what exhausts people in\nsocial situations is also something like\nsocial\nanxiety so if we look at Social Anxiety\nwhich an extrovert can have by the way\nwhich is terrifying it's it really\ntricky what happens is that when we go\ninto social situations when we have\nsocial anxiety our cognitive Ram is\nfilled up with anxious thoughts so you\ngo and you hang out with a group of\nfriends and you're like oh my God like\nwhat is this person thinking is this\nperson upset should I speak when should\nI enter the conversation I have\nsomething cool to say but I don't know\nhow to enter the conversation I'm just\nwaiting here waiting for my chance to\nspeak waiting for my chance to speak and\noh crap now they've shifted to something\nelse but I had really something cool to\nsay should I go back to the topic but\nthat feels kind of awkward and I kind of\nmiss my chance and oh crap and like now\nI'm not even saying anything and are\npeople wondering like if I'm just\nstanding around am I being creep this is\nwhat leads to social exhaustion this is\nsocial anxiety now why is this\nexperience more common the one univer\nuniform something that I think is\nresponsible for the rise in social\nanxiety across our generation starting\nwith Millennials and is getting worse\nthe deeper down we go the younger we get\nis the use of\ntechnology so what's started to happen\nis we've stopped relating to other\npeople like in person we do things like\nDM each other on Discord and when we use\nonline-based communication a lot of our\nempathic and social circuitry starts to\nrust so just to give you all a simple\nexample when human beings used to sit\naround around a fire and like talk to\neach other 2 years ago there are all of\nthese circuits in our brain that started\nto develop that measure tone body\nlanguage you know facial expressions and\nas those circuits develop those things\nreassure us right because you can like\nas you pay attention you're not really\npaying attention to all subconscious so\nthe tone and body language of the people\naround you reassure you you say okay\nthese people like me they feel\ncomfortable as we move on to more online\ncommunication those parts of our brain\nrust because if I'm dming 15 people on\nDiscord I don't have like the part of\nlike I can't measure tone I can't see\nbody language so those parts of our\nbrain start to shut off in the same way\nthat you forget a language if you don't\nuse it now we go into a real life social\nsituation these parts of our brain that\ngive us social reassurance are shut off\nand so we don't get any of those\npositive signals telling us hey people\nactually don't think you're a creep\nthey're smiling at you they're looking\nat you right they're like that they\ndon't think you're a creep but as those\nparts of our brain\ndeactivate the cognitive part of our\nbrain starts picking up all of that load\nand then it starts hyperactivating and\ndoing like calculations and calculations\nare fatiguing and the more cognitively\nyou're sitting there calculating\ncalculating calculating how to not screw\nup this conversation and no wonder it's\nexhausting it has nothing to do with\nwhether you're an extrovert or an\nintrovert okay this is why social\nanxiety is increasing this is why people\nare getting more think they're an\nintrovert all the time doesn't mean that\nyou're an\nintrovert next thing so how do we fix\nthis okay so there are a couple of\nthings one is that you can just spend\nmore time with other human beings and as\nyou spend time with human beings those\nparts of your brain will start to like\nthe gears will start moving and it'll\nstop being a little bit Rusty okay but\nit's painful to do that right and that's\nwhy like people will say this [ __ ] like\njust put yourself out there just put\nyourself out there just put you're like\nthat's painful yeah it's painful but\nit's going to take some time for your\nlike gears to adjust so it's kind of\nlike you know if I'm sitting all day in\nan air conditioned environment then I\nstart spending time Outdoors where it's\nhot it's going to feel really crappy but\neventually my body will like start to\nchange my Thermo regulation because the\nbody adapts but it sucks until that\nadaptation kicks\nin second thing so if we look at what\ncauses exhaustion when we socially\ninteract with people there's one primary\nvariable that you can control which is\nthe purpose of the social interaction so\nPurpose Driven social interaction\nreduces the the energy drain so when I\ngo to a party because my friends are\nlike hey put yourself out there and\nyou're like all right I guess I have to\ngo to a party and then you go to a party\nbut you're like okay I'm just here to\nput myself out there there's not a clear\nidea of like what you're doing there\nthere's not a clear\npurpose that's going to be socially\nexhausting because you're just sitting\nthere you're holding a drink maybe\nyou're on your phone too you're kind of\nlike what am I even doing here like this\nis a pain like no one's talking to me\nI'm not talking to anyone you're not\nreally like focused on you don't have a\nparticular\ngoal so this is what's really\ninteresting is you can send introverts\nto social situations or extroverts and\nif they have a purpose for being\nthere their energy will will be way\nhigher right so I can send an introvert\nto like hey like we're going to go play\nboard games at a board game Cafe and\nlike we're going to have fun at a board\ngame Cafe and then you go to a Board\nGame Cafe and suddenly you've got these\nintroverts who are chatting up the\npeople next to them cuz I'm there with\nlike my three friends we're playing a\nfour-player game but hey let's play like\nMafia or something like that involves\neight players and now suddenly you're\nlike making friends there's tons of like\npeople at Anime conventions who are like\nhitting each other up and making friends\nand half of them introverts or half of\nthem extroverts it's not like anime is\nlike specifically an introvert hobby\nthat's what we think but I don't think\nso so Purpose Driven social activity so\nif you feel\ndrained by social interaction it doesn't\nmean you're extr doesn't mean you're an\nintrovert instead what you really need\nto think about is what am I doing this\nfor what's my goal in being here and\neven to sort of almost like\noperationalize that out a little bit and\nif you're going to a party okay like I'm\ngoing to go here and I'm going to\npractice talking to people so I'm going\nto try to introduce myself to five\ndifferent people at the party and I'm\ngoing to at least make small talk with\nfive different people and after that if\nI'm not having a good time after 45\nminutes I'm just going to leave so lay\nit out for yourself and then how do you\nactually introduce yourself to people at\na party you literally walk up to them\nand you can say hi hello don't say both\nof those things that's weird walk up and\nsay hi smile walk up hold out your\nhand like this you know and say hi my\nname is Alo it's nice to meet you and\nthen you can kind of ask them like you\nknow who like how did y'all end up here\nyou can ask them why why they're you\nknow how did you end up here are you a\nfriend of so and so someone invited you\nto the party right and you can say like\nhey I'm a friend of so and so's however\nyou got to the party or I'm I'm a\nstudent at this\nUniversity and I'm here to get to know\nsome people and expand my Social\nCircle that's it right you don't need an\nexcuse like oh my God like I have no\nfriends and I haven't left the house in\n18 you don't need to say that just say\nhey I'm here to expand my social I'm\nhere to meet new\npeople right and that's all the reason\nyou need and they're like this\n[ __ ] they're all socially\nanxious so they're like this\n[ __ ] I wish I could do\nthat they're like now I have to explain\nwhy I'm\nhere right you get that like all the\nsocially anxious people wish they could\nwalk up to someone and confidently\nintroduce themselves and confidently\nintroducing yourself is not about having\nconfidence it's about being succinct you\njust walk up you say very little and\nthen the ball is in their Court\nthat's\nit right and you don't want to do so\npeople are like how you doing don't do\nany of that\ncrap right or you can be hi hello how\nare you doing\ntoday right and if you stutter over your\nwords you stutter that's okay you can\nstutter you can say\nhi you know hi hi hi I I I can't D I\nmean I can't\nI can't create a stutter so you just\nstutter and you just say your thing hey\nI'm here to meet people be having a\nstutter doesn't mean that you're not a\ngood human\nbeing what if they laugh then let them\nlaugh right that's why you're you're\nintroducing yourself to five\npeople and maybe you said something that\nwas funny who\nknows"
