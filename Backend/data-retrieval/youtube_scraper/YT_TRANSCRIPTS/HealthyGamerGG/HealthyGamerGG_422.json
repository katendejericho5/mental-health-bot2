    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about why you\nshould be ashamed of yourself\nI know it sounds kind of weird but one\nof the biggest problems in society today\nis that we've forgotten the value of\nShame let's remember that our human\nbrains have evolved to experience all of\nthese emotions and therefore each of\nthem serves a very important purpose and\nit turns out that a lot of the problems\nthat we struggle with today in our\ntechnologically overcharged Society have\nto do with actually not feeling ashamed\nof ourselves hey just a quick note a lot\nof people will ask us what do I do next\nand that's why we built Dr K's guide\nIt's a comprehensive resource that\ndistills over 20 years of my experience\nboth as a monk and as a psychiatrist and\nit's designed in a way that's tailored\nto fit your needs so if you're\ninterested in better understanding your\nmind and taking control of your life\ncheck out the link below\nand so this is something that I first\nkind of ran into when I was playing Dark\nSouls and I sucked at dark souls and I\nsort of struggled and then I went on the\ninternet and I asked for help and the\nanswer that I got from everyone is get\ngood right I was like hey I'm struggling\nwith this boss the boss keeps owning me\nat me Bros help me Bros and everyone was\nlike get good Noob get good get good no\none gave me any support no one gave me\nany help no one kind of cued in with me\nthey were just like get good and what I\nlike about Dark Souls is that it's\nincredibly realistic because much like\ndark souls in real life you suck I suck\nwe all suck and the biggest problem\nthough is that even if you suck today\nit's not like you wake up tomorrow and\nyou're better despite the fact that we\nstruggle in a lot of different\ndimensions of Our Lives it's not like we\ncan develop some kind of energy or\nmotivation to consistently fix our\nproblems and today we're going to talk\nabout precisely how to do that because\nas it turns out we as human beings have\nevolved circuits to help us fix our\nproblems and the most important thing\nthat helps us grow as human beings is\nactually shame so in order to understand\nthis we have to understand the\nevolutionary purpose of Shame right\nbecause shame like hurts it really sucks\nand we really want to avoid it if you go\ninto a situation where you feel ashamed\nof yourself chances are you will avoid\nfeeling that shame at all costs so yeah\none time I went to a grocery store and I\naccidentally said penis instead of wenis\nwhen I was checking out so therefore I\ncan never go to the grocery store again\nand I don't even know that doesn't make\nany sense but you all know what I mean\nright so you do something stupid and\nthen like you can never go back there\nand talk to those people ever again\nbecause of how shamed you are and it\nturns out that that's not a bug it's a\nfeature so if we look at the\nevolutionary purpose of Shame let's go\nback like 5 000 years right so back when\neveryone was using Nokia phones and so\nwe're a tribe of like 150 or 200 humans\nand let's say that there's some kind of\ncelebration for some kind of harvest all\nright so I go to a party where there's\nsomeone that I'm crushing on\nand everyone is dancing and then what\nhappens is I start dancing and it turns\nout that I suck at dancing and I feel\nashamed of myself and in Step some Chad\nwho is good at dancing and starts\ndancing with my crush and they are So\nGraceful and they are so awesome and\nthey are so sexy that you know I feel\neven worse about myself so I feel shame\nand so the question is in that situation\nwhen I've got 150 human beings in My\nTribe what is the antidote to that shame\nhow do I make that shame go away so when\nwe have a fixed group of people and we\ncannot avoid those people or those\ncircumstances shame actually is what\ndrives us towards personal growth\nbecause six months from now there's\ngoing to be another Harvest Festival and\nduring that Harvest Festival I will have\nthe chance to dance and so if I don't\nwant to be ashamed at all future Harvest\nfestivals I actually need to learn how\nto dance and this is why psychologists\nactually call shame the master emotion\nshame is such a powerful emotion that\naccording to psychologists it actually\ntrumps all of the other emotions it is\nthe most OP emotion because it can\novercome things like anger and fear and\nlove shame is the most powerful emotion\nand you may understand that if you're\nfrustrated with yourself for being stuck\nin life and you're like you get angry\nwith yourself and like tomorrow I'm\ngonna wake up and I'm Gonna Change I'm\ngonna go back to that gross history\nstore and I'm going to say wenis instead\nof penis and then as soon as you walk in\nthat shame overwhelms you it kind of\nbubbles up and it's so strong that it\ncompletely deflates the anger so shame\nis sort of a very powerful emotion it\nalso turns out that shame is the most\npowerful emotion at shaping our learning\nand personal growth so if we sort of\nthink about it if you're a kid hopefully\nyou're not in this situation but we can\nlook at kids who are emotionally abused\nfor the first 10 years of their life and\nif you were grew up in a situation where\nyou were in an abusive household or\ntoxic household the way that your brain\nwires due to the shame that you felt\nwill actually dictate the next 70 years\nof your life right so the lessons that\nshame teaches us are the lessons that we\ncarry with us through our whole life and\nthis is why it takes sometimes months or\nyears of practices like Psychotherapy or\nhealing or something like that to\nreverse the damage of Shame\nnow here's the problem if we grow up in\na situation where we were made to feel\nshame or later in life let's say teenage\nyears we did something ourselves that\nmade us feel ashamed of ourselves we\nsort of feel that shame and then some\npart of our brain wires right I'm a\nloser I suck at dancing I'm never going\nto be happy I'm never going to be in a\nromantic relationship whatever we learn\nsome kind of like neuroscientific sort\nof stuff our brain wires that way and we\ncarry it with us and then the problem is\nthat if we sort of think about okay so\nif shame is what wires our brain\nand we wire in one way and then we avoid\nshame for the rest of our life if we\navoid feeling that shame what we're\nactually doing is losing the capacity to\nrewire because shame is such a powerful\ninstigator at sort of neuronal firing\nand wiring the problem is that it's\nharder to harness shame for personal\ngrowth in today's world than it was 5\n000 years ago so let's look at another\nexample so let's say that I'm out with\nmy tribe and we're all hunting and\nsomeone else uses a bow and arrow and\nthey sort of shoot a deer and then I\nsort of shoot I take my shot I shoot a\ncouple of arrows and I always miss so in\nthat situation I feel ashamed of myself\nor maybe what happened is I did\nsomething sneaky maybe I stole from\nsomeone in the tribe and then the whole\ntribe starts to ostracize me and I feel\nashamed of myself\nso in those situations when I feel that\npowerful shame it hurts me a lot right\nand so then what my brain says is okay\nthis is so painful that we never want to\nbe in this situation again we actually\nneed to avoid shame but in that Society\n5 000 years ago I had certain physical\nrestraints that made it impossible for\nme to retreat from the circumstances\nthat induce shame so if I steal from My\nTribe people in My Tribe I still have to\nlike live there because I can't survive\non my own so in order to fix that\nbehavior and never steal again the shame\nteaches me hey stealing is wrong and if\nwe steal again we're gonna we're really\ngonna be screwed or Shane will teach me\nthat okay if I suck at like shooting\narrows I need to go out and practice for\na while so I no longer feel ashamed in\nthe constraints of our old Society where\nwe couldn't actually leave our\ncircumstances shame forced us to grow\nright and that's if you kind of think\nabout it that's also a form of avoidance\nbecause what are we really doing\neven if I grow and I get better at\nshooting arrows or I never steal again\nI'm still avoiding the shame the shame\nis not happening right because I've\nbecome better as a human being and this\nis the really tricky thing that we've\ngot to understand\nthe more an emotion hurts you the more\nimportant it is for your progress so if\nyou sort of think about why would your\nbody or brain punish you in the first\nplace it punishes you because it's\nreally really important for you to learn\nthat lesson and each emotion has its\nplace anger helps us maintain our\nterritory and boundaries sadness even\nhelps us bond with other human beings\nand the purpose of Shame is to induce\nthe right behavior and so we sort of see\nthis in parenting Styles as well which\nis like okay if you make a kid feel\nashamed of themselves they'll never\nbehave that way again or at least that's\nthe goal and so this is exactly what\nwe're missing in today's world because\nin today's world we have a new way of\navoiding shame a way of avoiding shame\nthat does not involve fixing the problem\nand that is the internet right because\nnow\nif I feel ashamed about something I\nnever have to go back to those people\nright if I feel mortified because I said\npenis instead of wenis at a grocery\nstore I can just go to a different\ngrocery store or I can use grocery\ndelivery and I never have to interact\nwith anyone if I do something stupid in\nmy class it's really easy I can just\nskip class and watch the videos or I can\neven drop the class so now what's\nhappened is our society is structured in\nsuch a way where if we feel shame in a\nparticular situation we don't actually\nhave to correct the behavior to avoid\nthe shame we can just avoid the\nsituation entirely this is exactly the\nproblem that you run into if you don't\nknow how to harness shame you can start\nto progress in one way but the moment\nthat you get a setback that shame is so\npainful that it causes you to abandon\nthe Endeavor altogether so I'm going to\nlearn how to play chess and chess is fun\nit's really cool I really enjoy it and\nI'm gonna sign up for an amateur\ntournament and in the first round of the\namateur tournament I get crushed by a\nkid who's half my age I feel so ashamed\nof myself oh my God I'm such an idiot\nthat I abandoned chess altogether and\nhey maybe I'll learn how to play guitar\nand then I go out with some friends and\nthey say Hey you know how to play guitar\nLet's Jam together let's have a jam\nsession you need to show up in there\nreally good and then you feel ashamed of\nyourself looks like guitars out the\nwindow and so this is what happens in\nour life is we when we start to avoid\nall of this shame which by the way is\nkind of weird right because it's wired\nto do that our brain is wired to make us\nnever feel shame again but in the past\nwe had to fix those problems instead of\nabandoning them but abandoning our\nproblems is so much easier today which\nis exactly how we end up feeling stuck\nso if we want to fix this problem I know\nit's kind of crazy but what you really\nneed to do is feel more shame stop\nrunning away from the shame because the\nshame is exactly that nuclear energy\nthat will lead to personal growth now in\norder to do this it's a little bit\ntricky right so I'm not saying that you\nall should expose yourselves to people\nwho chronically make you feel ashamed\nright I'm not saying go find someone\nwho's toxic and just have them beat you\nup over and over and over again what I'm\nsaying is that if you have a situation\nin which you feel ashamed do not Retreat\nfrom the situation but still avoid the\nshame now you may say that's kind of\nweird because if I'm in the situation\nwon't I feel ashamed of myself no this\nis exactly what shame is supposed to do\nshame is supposed to alter your behavior\nso that when you are in that situation\nyou no longer have to feel ashamed about\nyourself so if I go with my friends to\nthe beach and I am embarrassed about my\nbeach bot and I feel ashamed of myself\nand I leave my shirt on and I don't go\ninto the water and stuff like that and I\njust kind of sit around all day I feel\nashamed and I say to myself well it\nlooks like I'm never going to go to the\nbeach again on the contrary what I want\nyou all to do\nis commit to repeating whatever made you\nfeel shame within 30 days so 30 days so\nif you do something or if you are in a\nsituation where you feel ashamed of\nyourself 30 days from now you're gonna\ndo the same damn thing\nyou're going to go back to the beach in\n30 days with those friends without those\nfriends or whatever whatever the\ncircumstances that makes you feel\nashamed I lost in this amateur\ntournament I'm gonna sign up for another\namateur tournament 30 days from now\nso put your brain back in the situation\nin which it was evolved you need to\ncreate those artificial constraints to\nre-expose yourself to that same\nsituation\nand now you've done something really\ncool because now you know that that\nshame is coming 30 days away so that\nthis is when you're the fear of that\nchain will start to activate different\ncircuits of your brain your brain will\nstart to say okay it's time to actually\nfix this problem so that we don't feel\nshame because we're going to be there\nanyway right and this is a really\npowerful principle for Behavioral change\nand this is why we as human beings\noftentimes force ourselves into bad\nsituations a ton of the people that I've\nworked with patients clients even\nfriends who are getting married for\nexample will get married a year from now\nbut they will commit to having a\nparticular suit size or dress size that\nis one or two sizes smaller than what\nthey're wearing right now so they're\nsort of forcing themselves to have a\nwedding dress that may not fit them and\nthe shame of not being able to fit into\nyour wedding dress actually motivates\nyou to get into shape and this is the\nkey problem is that we've stopped\nutilizing shame so what I want you all\nto do is pick whatever it is that makes\nyou ashamed and then try to pick a\nTarget 30 days from now where you are\ngoing to do that thing and then ask\nyourself okay if I'm gonna do this or\nI'm going to do this 30 days from now\nwhat can I do between now and then that\nwould make me feel less ashamed about\nmyself what can I do between then and\nnow that will help me\nget good and feel less of that shame and\nharness that motivation that fear of\nshame because it hurts so much to\nactually make progress towards your\ngoals and it turns out that Dark Souls\nhad the answer all along because the\nfirst time that you go into a boss's\nArena and you get them down to 10 health\nand then you end up losing you're like\noh man I got this and then you run back\ninto the arena you Zone in and they two\nshot you and then you're like wait\nthat's why did I do so well the first\ntime and then you go in the third time\nand fourth time they three shot you four\nshot you you know and you're getting\ncrushed and how is it that you actually\ndown the boss you have to keep on zoning\nin the problem in today's world is that\nthat feeling of Shame is so powerful\nthat we let it turn into a different\nkind of avoidance instead of avoiding\nthe shame through growing which is\nreally what shame is designed for\nbecause we couldn't shape our\ncircumstances now we avoid shame through\nnot growing now we avoid shame through\nRetreat and this is the problem is\nunless you start harnessing shame unless\nyou start putting yourself in situations\nthat you may feel ashamed you will\ncontinue to run away from everything in\nyour life you will continue to run away\nfrom all kinds of difficulty and that's\nno way to live life so if you want to\nget good be ashamed of yourself\nforeign\n[Music]"
