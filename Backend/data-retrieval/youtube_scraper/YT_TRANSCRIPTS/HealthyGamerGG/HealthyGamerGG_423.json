    "transcript": "I know it's kind of weird but I\nencourage you to really think about the\nimpact of red flags on your relationship\nI want you to think about the impact of\ngreen flags on your relationship is this\nthe kind of situation where I'm looking\nfor perfect and something always falls\napart and if you really think about it\nyou're losing out on something that's\nreally important which is finding a\npartner who's willing to change who\ncares about you enough to change a\nfundamental aspect of their life and\nthat's probably the kind of person you\nwant to end up with I'm not saying that\ny'all should Chase red flags I'm not\nsaying that red flags are good and the\nmore that you have the better off your\nrelationship is going to be what I'm\nsaying is that I'm noticing an\nincreasing trend of people looking for\nperfect and the more that they looked\nfor perfect the more that they delay\nconflict resolution and if you really\nlook at what leads to prognostically's\nvery successful relationships it's the\nability to navigate conflict and\ncompromise and oftentimes as we discount\npeople with red flags we don't give\npeople a chance to change and to grow\nand to whatever that's actually shooting\nUs in the foot so it's just something\nfor you all to think about and hopefully\nbalance a little bit"
