    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nbecome a different person\n[Music]\nit's a lot of people that I talk to\nfantasize about wanting a life\ntransplant right so you wish that\nsomeone would come in and pluck you out\nof your current life and drop you into a\ndifferent life where you have tons of\nmoney and lots of people who love you we\nwish we could kind of do a life\ntransplant but even more people that I\ntalk to wish that you could transplant\nsomeone else into your life because if\nyou were actually a different person if\nyour personality was different if you\nwere more resilient if you were more\nexcited then your life could be so\ndifferent if a better version of you was\nactually living your life then your life\ncould be completely transformed and that\nmay sound crazy that may sound\nimpossible but we are actually going to\nteach you how to do that and it turns\nout that we actually have evidence-based\ntechniques that do precisely that so\nbefore we get started we really have to\nunderstand what is personality and a lot\nof people may think like oh personality\nis just who I am and it's fixed that's\nactually not true we scientifically know\nwhat personality is and personality has\nthree components the first aspect of a\nperson reality is the way that we\ninterpret information the second is the\nway that we react to circumstances and\nthe third aspect of personality is the\nway that we behave so if you sort of\nthink about two different people with\ntwo different personalities and we put\nthem in the same scenario their\nreactions will be different right so if\nI have two different people have two\ndifferent personalities and they both\nget dumped by their significant other\ntheir personality will determine how\nthey behave in that situation so one\nperson may interpret the breakup as I am\ninsufficient as a human being whereas\nanother person may interpret that\nbreakup as we just grew into different\nhuman beings and we're no longer\ncompatible it says nothing about me and\nbeing insufficient and this is something\nthat I sort of learned working as an\naddiction psychiatrist and when you work\nas an addiction psychiatrist you deal a\nlot with something called personality\ndisorders these are things like\nsociopathy or narcissism and so if we\nlook at people who are narcissistic we\ncan see how they interpret and react to\nsituations in ways that are different\nfrom normal people right so the thing\nabout a narcissist is everything is\nabout them so even if I win first place\nin a chess competition the narcissist is\nlike I can't believe you did that you\nmade me look so bad I got second place\nand I can't believe you would do\nsomething so hurtful is get first place\nin this competition that I was competing\nin they take these ordinary\ncircumstances and they interpret them as\na personal attack and then what happens\nis that the narcissist it's not just\nthat they feel that way right they also\nbehave in a certain way so then what\nthey do is they go and talk to you about\nit and make you feel guilty for hurting\nthem in some way so they change their\nbehavior and they start to do\nmanipulative stuff and then if you sort\nof think about it why would a narcissist\nwant to make you feel guilty because\nideally what they want you to do is\napologize for winning first place and\nhurting their feelings and then that'll\nmake them feel better right so I got\nsecond place and you hurt me but if I\ncan get you to apologize then and I will\nfeel better about myself hey y'all I\nwant to take a moment to talk about HG\ngroups our group coaching experience\nhere at healthy gamer is designed to\nhelp people with the problems of the\ndigital age problems like social\nisolation a lack of purpose or simply\nfeeling overwhelmed groups are a place\nthat will help you learn the skills that\nare necessary for Success that aren't\nreally taught anywhere else skills like\nhow to Be an Effective listener and\ncommunicate effectively skills like how\nto be vulnerable so that you can allow\nyourself to authentically connect with\nanother human being skills like\ncultivating self-awareness so you\nunderstand where your motivation comes\nfrom but also where self-sabotaging\nBehavior comes from and so if you all\nare interested in learning more about\ngroups and interested in learning a\nlittle bit about how you can develop\ncompetence and confidence to move\nforward in life check out the link in\nthe description below and so this sounds\nkind of weird but then like okay so if\nthat's the case how do we change that\nand so in Psychiatry what we did is\ndevelop evidence-based techniques to\ntreat people who have severe personality\ndefects so he developed certain kinds of\ntreatments like dialectical behavioral\ntherapy for example treats people who\nhave borderline personality disorder\nthere are other kinds of therapies that\nwe've developed for people with\nanti-social personality disorder those\nare people like sociopaths people who\nhave dependent personality disorder\nthese are people who tend to be like\nreally dependent on others and the cool\nthing is that eventually we got together\nand we put together all of this research\non all of these specific therapies to\nfix these particular personality\nproblems and then a group of researchers\ngot together and asked themselves okay\nwhat's the common element between all of\nthese therapies what do all of these\ntherapies share what's the fundamental\nthat allows us to change anyone's\npersonality and they settled on two\nmajor factors metacognition and meta\nemotion and so what metacognition is is\nthe way that we think about our thoughts\nand what meta emotion is is the way that\nwe feel about our emotions so I'll give\nyou all just a simple example of meta\nemotion so sometimes I will go to a\nparty and I will feel socially anxious\noh my God I'm so anxious I'm afraid and\nthen after scrolling through my cell\nphone you know on the side for half an\nhour the social anxiety gets too high\nand I decide to leave because no one's\ntalking to me and that's not where it\nends though right because once I leave\nthe party then it's not just the anxiety\nthat I dealt with it's the way that I\nfeel about being so anxious in the first\nplace I get angry with myself I feel\nashamed with myself I start to fear the\nfear right oh my God this fear is out of\ncontrol this anxiety is out of control I\nfeel anxious about being anxious and if\nyou really look at what screws you in\nlife it's not the anxiety it's all the\ncrap that happens to you when you feel\nanxious you start getting anxious about\nfeeling anxious you beat yourself up so\nif I actually beat myself up for being\nanxious in the first place and I get\nanxious about my anxiety what do you\nthink will happen the next time I go to\na party it's not just the social anxiety\nthat I'm dealing with it's my meta\nemotion that actually cripples me and\nscrews me in the future and this is the\nkey thing that these researchers\ndiscovered it's not the thoughts\nthemselves or the circumstances or even\nthe emotions it's the way that we react\nto those thoughts emotions and\ncircumstances that actually determines\nour destiny and so we really need to\nunderstand what metacognition is and as\nyou start understanding metacognition\nand meta emotion you will actually be\nable to change your personality and the\nreal tragedy here is that if you think\nabout how you go about trying to improve\nyour life what you actually do is try to\ncontrol the circumstances of your life\nright you try to focus on particular\nevents I want to get a job I don't want\nto be alone anymore I don't want this\nperson to break up with me and what we\nactually don't control at all is the\nconclusions that we draw from what\nhappens in real life live literally the\nonly thing that you can control in your\nlife is the stuff in here we can't\nactually control whether someone\npromotes me or doesn't promote me breaks\nup with me or doesn't break up with me\nbut that's actually where we spend all\nof our cognitive energy and this is\nexactly why we end up stuck in life\nbecause we put all of our energy into\nfixing things out there because that's\nreally what we want right I want to get\npromoted I want to get married I want\nall of these things and that's where we\nput our energy but the real tragedy is\nthat we don't actually pay attention to\nhow those events affect us up here and\nit's the way that we are up here it's\nour personality that actually determines\nour destiny so let's say that I get\ndumped by someone when I get dumped by\nsomeone I will try to avoid that I will\ntry to repair that and I'll spend a lot\nof energy trying to repair the\nrelationship but what I actually\ncompletely ignore is the conclusions\nthat I draw about myself up here right\nso when you get dumped you're like like\noh my god I've gotten dumped how do I\nget this person I'm going to be alone\nI'm not worthy oh my God all this stuff\nis going on those are the thoughts that\nwe actually assume is true we let the\nconclusions from the crappy stuff that\nhappens to us in life go completely\nunchecked right so if you get a B on a\ntest your mind forms all kinds of\nconclusions about who you are and if you\nstop and really think about it you can't\ncontrol what another human being does\nbut literally the only thing that you\nhave some degree or even complete\ncontrol over is the conclusions that you\nform from an experience no one else gets\nto determine your conclusions about your\nlife and your experience for you so we\ngo through life automatically forming\nreflexive conclusions about who we are\nand as we form those conclusions those\nwill change the way that we interpret\ninformation they will change the way\nthat we react to circumstances and they\nwill change the way that we behave okay\nthis person person didn't text me for\ntwo days well how do we interpret that\ninformation well that depends am I a\nloser am I not a loser because if I\nconclude earlier in life that I am a\nloser that becomes a facet of my\npersonality right and then we go through\nlife thinking I am a loser and so if I\ngo through life thinking I'm a loser and\nsomeone doesn't text me for two days the\nmeaning of that text not texting for two\ndays changes this person doesn't text me\nbecause I'm a loser but you all see how\nlike me being a loser is completely\nindependent from whether they text me or\nnot there are a thousand different\nreasons why someone may not text me for\ntwo days but it's the way that I\ninterpret that information it's the\npersonality of being a loser that\nultimately determines how I react to\nthat and then the problem is that if I'm\nletting Loser run the ship up here this\nis a metacognition that I have right\nbecause it's not an actual thought it is\na thought about my experience in life I\nam a loser then that that feeling of I'm\na loser will change the way that I\nbehave and react to that person either\nI'll try to give them something hey by\nthe way you haven't texted me in two\ndays so let me win over your affection\nbecause I'm a loser and I have to like\ngive you something materialistically to\nto get affection from you and then what\nwhat does that do for my life right that\nthat will determine that the people I\nend up spending time with are the people\nthat become dependent on my\nmaterialistic or financial support or\ngifts because that's what you have to do\nif you're a loser right you let people\nwalk all over you unless you keep on\ngiving them gifts and all this other\nkind of crap or you give them the gift\nof helping them feel good about\nthemselves by making yourself small and\nboosting their ego you do all kinds of\nunhealthy behaviors and this is going to\ndetermine your life then you wake up one\nday and you wish you had a life\ntransplant because you've surrounded\nyourself with people who you have to go\nthe extra mile for instead of them\ncreating a reciprocal relationship and\nwhere did all of that start it started\nwith the conclusion that you're a loser\nand then if we sort of think about where\ndid that conclusion come from it came\nfrom events right that's what you'll say\nyou'll say well these three things\nhappened and this is how I determined\nI'm a loser but hold on a second because\nit's that determination that is the\nmetacognition when those three events\nhappen there are different ways to\ninterpret those events right bad luck or\nbad circumstances or maybe the reason\nyou don't have friends is because your\nparents literally did not teach you how\nto make friends maybe the reason that\nyou don't have friends is because you\nare part of a cultural group growing up\nand so all of your friends were sort of\nthrust in front of you you were an\nIndian kid hanging out with a bunch of\nIndian kids and then when you moved off\nto college then you didn't have the\nskills necessary to make new friends but\nthat's never the way that we interpret\nit because we interpret it automatically\nand so it is when our metacognitions the\nconclusions that we draw from Life run\nrampant that we start to lose control of\nour life and the good news is that you\ncan actually change all that as you\nstart to shape your metacognitions and\nmeta emotions literally your personality\nwill change as you start to change those\nthe way that you interpret information\nreact to circumstances and behave then\nyour personality will change and then as\nyour personality changes you will\nliterally wake up as a different person\nand we know this because we've done this\nscientifically with like literally\nmillions of people we've taken tons and\ntons of narcissists and gone through\nthis painstaking process of\nmetacognitive changes which is how they\nno longer become narcissists and we can\nactually do that and so now the question\nbecomes how do I actually go about\nchanging my metacognitions and so\nthere's one really key place that we're\ngoing to start which is Observe and be\ncareful about the conclusions that you\ndraw from the experiences in your life\nso if you go do something let's say I\napply for a job or I ask someone out on\na date you'll notice two things the\nfirst is that you will feel some amount\nof reaction which is completely\nautomatic right so like you feel hurt\nand you feel rejected but if you're not\ncareful you'll notice that that\nemotional and hurt and rejection which\nwill disappear over time will actually\ntransform without your knowledge into a\nconclusion and that's the step that we\nneed to stop so what I want you all to\nreally do is pay attention to the\nconclusions that you draw and your mind\nwill give you all of this evidence right\nand so you will feel like that is an\nappropriate conclusion but a lot of\ntimes the evidence that it actually\npresents to you is shaped by all kinds\nof emotions because if you really stop\nand think about it the conclusions that\nyou draw about yourself are formed based\non evidence that you collect when you\nare highly emotional the evidence that\nyou actually collect is not objective at\nall and so then the conclusions that we\ndraw are by definition not objective in\nthe Buddhist tradition there's this\nconcept of the two arrows and what the\nbook this believe is that we get hit by\ntwo arrows in life the first is the\narrow that life shoots at us which we\ncan't avoid and the second is the arrow\nthat we shoot at ourselves for getting\nhit by the first I get angry at myself\nfor losing my temper and one of those\nthings we can control in the second one\nwe can and this is what was really\nconfusing for me because when I was\nstudying like Psychiatry I went back and\nI looked at all these yogic and Buddhist\ntexts and like where's all the\npsychology here like where's all the the\ninformation about anger and Trauma like\nnone of that stuff is in the yogic texts\nand the reason for that is because the\nyogis actually figured out that you\ndon't need to fix a particular problem\nwhat the yogis actually focused on was\nmetacognition so when they have all\nthese practices like meditation they\njust transcend mind and and don't they\ndon't care about the content of what's\ngoing on in your mind that's why\npatanjali's yoga sutras doesn't have any\ninformation about particular traumas\ninstead with these old yogic texts have\nis this sort of exploration of how do\nyou move past cognition entirely and\nstart working at the level of\nmetacognition because when you start\nmeditating and when you start looking at\nworking at the level of metacognition\nwhatever is in your mind will get solved\nand we see good evidence for this that a\nlot of people who start to practice\nmeditation they'll say that all\ndimensions of my life are better and\nit's like wait hold on a second how is\nit that sitting there and observing your\nmind makes your relationships better\nmakes your work ethic better makes your\nmakes you more productive like how does\nthat work and that's because the yogis\nare work looking at the level of\nmetacognition so if you want to change\nyour personality it turns out that you\nactually can and the main thing that you\nneed to focus on is instead of trying to\nfix your life fix the way that you\ninterpret and draw conclusions from Life\nevents pay a lot of attention to that\nbecause the real tragedy of life is that\nwe spend a lot of energy trying to fix\nthings that involve other people which\nmeans fundamentally they're complete not\ncompletely but at least partially out of\nour control and then what we end up\ndoing is we ignore all of the\nconclusions that we draw about ourselves\nwe don't think about it we don't work on\nit we don't craft the conclusions that\nwe have about ourselves and so those\nthings develop automatically and then\nthey determine our personality and once\nthey determine their person your\npersonality then they'll determine the\nway that literally interactions get\ninterpreted by your brain they'll\ndetermine your emotional reactions to\nsituations and most importantly they'll\ncontrol the way that you behave so if\nyou want to forge a different Destiny\nyou need to become a different person\nperson the good news is that that's\nactually a lot easier or at least more\npossible than we realize\nforeign"
