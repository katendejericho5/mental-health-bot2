    "transcript": "there's one last really interesting\nthing about emotionally turbulent\nrelationships and why human beings are\nmore attracted to them this kind of\nexplains why you can't get away from\nyour toxic ex sometimes we're confused\nlike why don't I just like stop seeing\nthis person I know it's bad for me but I\ncan't help myself so it turns out that\nthere's a lot of really interesting\nneuroscience and Physiology about what\nattracts us to our toxic exes so it's a\nreally fascinating study that was done\nwhere they had people dating and the\nonly difference between dates was that\none was on a bridge that was made of\nstone and the other is on a bridge that\nwas like rickety and what they sort of\nfound is that the emotional fear of the\nrickety bridge made people fall in love\nwith each other more that anytime you're\nin an emotionally unstable environment\nit causes people to bond and so one\nreally interesting thing about red flag\nrelationships is that early like\nturbulence in the relationship creates\nactually a lot of negative emotion and\nthen you'll kind of bind together and\nwork through it"
