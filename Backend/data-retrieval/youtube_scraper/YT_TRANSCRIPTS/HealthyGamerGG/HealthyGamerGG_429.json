    "transcript": "and if we tunnel down into a little bit\nabout how men deal with their emotions\nwe'll kind of see that this is true in\ngeneral as well because if you're a man\nan emotion is a problem to be solved not\nsomething to be talked about right so\nthink about like if you get bullied on\nthe playground and you feel ashamed of\nyourself and people call you a fat kid\nand beat you up that isn't something you\ntalk about in fact if you go and cry to\nMommy or cry to the teacher you're\nactually treated worse you're taught\nthat articulating problems and talking\nto people is cause for punishment\ninstead what you're supposed to do if\nyou're a man is fix the problem right so\nif kids make fun of me for being fat I'm\nsupposed to lose weight get ripped learn\nmartial arts and the next time they talk\nI'm going to teach them who's boss it's\nif you sort of think about it the\nsolution to an internal feeling feeling\nashamed is to take an action and change\nthe circumstances that make me feel that\nway"
