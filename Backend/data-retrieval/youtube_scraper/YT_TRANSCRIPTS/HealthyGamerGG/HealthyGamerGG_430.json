    "transcript": "where it's like well I'm tired of being\na failure but every time I try to go and\nbe successful and fix my life it's like\nit's so hard and then you muster up a\nbunch of willpower and you force\nyourself to apply for a new job and then\nyou go to work and then you ghost after\ntwo weeks or you get fired and so then\nyou get really confused because you're\nlike hold on a second I understand that\nI'm afraid of failure but why am I\nafraid of success too those are\nopposites the fear of failure drives me\nto want success so I want success but\nthen I try to become successful and I'm\nscared of that too like but that's what\nI want how can I be scared of what I\nwant the fear of failure is not the\nopposite of the fear of the success it\nis actually the same damn fear you can't\nbe two things at once it's the same damn\nthing right so when people say oh\nthere's a thin line between love and\nhate but they're opposites right no\nthey're not opposites they're the same\ndamn thing and you may say how are love\nand hate the same thing they're both\nattachment the connection to the other\nperson is what causes those things it\ndoesn't matter what you're transmitting\nbut you're tightly connected y'all see\nthat so the fear of failure and fear of\nsuccess aren't different they're\nactually the same damn thing"
