    "transcript": "what causes exhaustion when we socially\ninteract with people there's one primary\nvariable that you can control which is\nthe purpose of the social interaction so\npurpose-driven social interaction\nreduces this the energy drain so when I\ngo to a party because my friends are\nlike hey put yourself out there and\nyou're like all right I guess I have to\ngo to a party and then you go to a party\nbut you're like okay I'm just here to\nput myself out there there's not a clear\nidea of like what you're doing there\nthere's not a clear purpose that's going\nto be socially exhausting because you're\njust sitting there you're holding a\ndrink maybe you're on your phone too\nyou're kind of like what am I even doing\nhere like this is a pain like no one's\ntalking to me I'm not talking to anyone\nyou're not really like focused on you\ndon't have a particular goal so this is\nwhat's really interesting is you can\nsend introverts to social situations or\nextroverts and if they have a purpose\nfor being there their energy will will\nbe way higher"
