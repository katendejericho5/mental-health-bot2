    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nbecome immune to fomo\nthe basic problem with fomo is that you\nare chasing the lives of other people\ninstead of figuring out what you want to\ndo in life what we're doing is seeing\nother people do cool things and then\nyou're chasing after them hoping to get\na fraction of their joy and today we're\ngoing to teach you how to switch it\naround we're going to teach you how to\nbe the inspiring person that sort of\nevokes fomo in other people because\nyou're out there living your life hey\ny'all I want to take a moment to talk\nabout HG groups our group coaching\nexperience here at healthygamer is\ndesigned to help people with the\nproblems of the digital age problems\nlike social isolation a lack of purpose\nor simply feeling overwhelmed groups are\na place that will help you learn the\nskills that are necessary for Success\nthat aren't really taught anywhere else\nskills like how to Be an Effective\nlistener and communicate effectively\nskills like how to be vulnerable so that\nyou can allow yourself to authentically\nconnect with another human being skills\nlike cultivating self-awareness so you\nunderstand where your motivation comes\nfrom but also where self-sabotaging\nBehavior comes from and so if you all\nare interested in learning more about\ngroups and interested in learning a\nlittle bit about how you can develop\ncompetence and confidence to move\nforward in life check out the link in\nthe description below and this is\nsomething that was really hard for me to\ntackle as a psychiatrist I sort of\nnoticed that people would come to me\nmore and more with fomo and that the\ntraditional methods of psychotherapy\ndidn't seem to be working we talk about\nokay like what's your underlying\ninsecurity and tell me about your\nparents and all this kind of stuff and\nthat despite doing all that stuff it\njust didn't seem to work and that's when\nI sort of realized that Psychotherapy is\nbuilt on our cerebral cortices it's\nbuilt on the higher order functions of\nour brain it's kind of like we talk\nabout feelings and emotions and desires\nand values and even the subconscious\nwhich manifests in dreams but it's all\npart of our like human or cortical mind\nthe most evolved parts of our mind and\nthe problem is that fomo and especially\ntechnology activates the deeper parts of\nour mind so if you sort of look at\nsomething like Doom scrolling right your\ncerebral cortices your human parts of\nthe brain are kind of saying like hey\nlike we should stop doing this like put\ndown the phone go do something\nproductive you're going to regret this\ntomorrow and your brain is kind of\nscreaming at you I don't do this don't\ndo this don't do this but the problem is\nthat technology accesses these weird\ndeeper reptilian parts of our brain uh\nDoom scroll dopamine fun I don't feel\ngood cats right so this is what this is\nhow technology works and it turns out\nthat fomo actually accesses two really\nreally primitive circuits in the brain\nthat are also present with a lot of\nanimals the first is the reason why\ntwo-year-olds are brats and what do I\nmean by this if you all have ever seen a\ntwo-year-old who's playing with other\ntwo-year-olds it's like I was at a\nbirthday party recently where there were\ntwo-year-olds who were eating cupcakes\nOkay so like one two-year-old has a\ncupcake and starts eating cupcake\ncupcakes delicious another two-year-old\ncomes along and says I want that cupcake\nand you're like no no these are all like\nthere's like 30 cupcakes they're all the\nsame here's your cockpit and the two I\nwas like no I want that one I want that\none I want the one that other people\nhave and when people get developmentally\nstunted we see really sordid stuff and\nI've seen this in my private practice\nand it's really nasty it's like two\nsisters and one sister wants everything\nthat the other sister has right so if\none person wins a trophy in Taekwondo\nthe other one starts Taekwondo and in\nthe worst cases this even does it\ninvolves things like trying to seduce\nyour sister's husband because you want\nwhat they have so this is a really\nprimitive circuit in the brain and you\nmay have sort of seen this when people\ntry to outshine you or if you do one\nthing someone's like hey you can't be\ndoing that without me doing it I'm gonna\ndo it better than you I'm gonna make you\nfeel bad about yourself I'm gonna do it\nbecause you're doing it I want exactly\nwhat you want I don't want to live my\nlife I want to live your life but better\nso it's a really primitive circuit in\nthe brain and it's very like\nevolutionary in nature as well because I\ndon't know if y'all have seen these\nvideos of like you know people walking\ndown the street and then a crowd like a\nprank video where a crowd starts running\nthe other way like the world is ending\nand the person who's walking down the\nstreet is like I don't know what's going\non but I'm going to turn around I'm\ngoing to run with the crowd so kind of\nmonkey see monkey do it's really\nprimitive part of our Behavior the other\nprimitive part that fomo sort of\naccesses is this desire not to be\nostracized so the world has changed a\nlot but our brain did not evolve for the\nworld that we live in today so as an\nexample you know in the past we lived in\nlike communities of maybe 200 or 300\nhumans these were like tribal\ncommunities or even smaller packs we're\ntalking about like for millions of years\nthis is what humans used to do and so if\nyou sort of think about the price of\nbeing left out or the price of\nostracization it was really really\nsevere right if you kind of fall out\nwith your tribe it's not like you can\njust meet new people on the internet\ntoday you can't just block one person\nand then find a new person tomorrow you\ncan now but you didn't used to be able\nto so what happens is our brains sort of\nrealized that okay being ostracized from\nthe pack like a wolf that gets\nostracized from the pack is basically\ngonna die so our brains are hyper\nhypersensitive to being ostracized and\nleft out we sort of view this as oh my\nGod now I'm screwed and so here's the\nproblem with technology today is it\nactivates these two primitive circuits\nlogically cortically in a sort of human\nbrain sense right our upper level\nfunctions we may realize that I don't\nactually need to do what everyone else\nis doing and if you stop and think about\nit they're like eight billion people on\nthe planet the definition of your life\nis that you're going to miss out on\n99.9999 of experiences because 8 billion\npeople are out there they're all eating\ngreat meals they're all having all kinds\nof different problems and getting\nmarried and getting divorced and having\nkids and getting pets and going scuba\ndiving and going surfing the majority of\nyour life is missing out on what other\npeople are doing the problem with things\nlike technology and especially social\nmedia is it activates these two parts of\nthe brain and that's kind of hard to\npsychotherapize so now the question\nbecomes how do we fix this right if\nthese primitive parts of our brain are\nbeing active what is the antidote to\nthose primitive parts of the brain and\nthis is where we're going to talk about\nbasically being satisfied so if you look\nat like people who don't have fomo why\ndo they not have fomo there's two groups\nof people right people who are able to\njust live their own life and when other\npeople are doing things they're like wow\nthat's really cool that's really good\nfor you like I hope you had a great time\nand these guys are actually genuine\nright they're like genuinely like they\ndon't feel like they're missing out on\nanything and why is that it's because\ntheir cup is full if we sort of think\nabout okay if I'm starving and I see\nsomeone else eat like a really really\njuicy burger it's like man I really want\nto eat that burger but if I'm if my\nstomach is full I actually don't covet\nthe food of other people so the the key\nantidote to fomo is to actually be\ncontent yourself\nand that may sound really hard but we're\ngoing to talk a little bit a really\nsimple way that I actually found worked\nfor a lot of my patients to actually\nkind of be content specifically with\nfomo\nso what I want you all to do is the next\ntime you have fomo what you're going to\ndo is you're going to want to do what\nother people do I want that one but\ninstead of just jumping to do that one\nbecause if you do you're gonna end up\nyou may feel good today but tomorrow\nwe'll roll around and you're not really\ncontent with your life so you're going\nto get fomo again so instead of just\njumping in and doing what other people\nare doing I want you to stop and think a\nlittle bit about okay what is it about\nthis activity that I am missing in my\nlife because it's not the activity\nitself there's going to be some kind of\ninternal value that you recognize as not\nbeing satisfied so it may be something\nlike exploration like people are going\non a trip somewhere\nand that sounds really cool I wish I\ncould go on a trip so what I want you to\nreally do is think about the underlying\nvalue that you want to sort of have in\nyour life and as you sort of figure out\nwhat that underlying value is it could\nbe exploration it could be a sense of\ngrowth it could be a sense of\nconnectedness or you know doing things\nwith other people so figure out what's\nthat like deeper value that you care\nabout that that deeper psychological\nneed\nso once you figure out what that is the\nnext thing to do is to start to think\nabout okay systematically how can I\nstart to build this into my life because\nI know it sounds kind of weird if people\nare going on a trip like you can go on a\ntrip too you don't have to go on a trip\nwith other people you can take the\nweekend and maybe go travel somewhere\nfor like a weekend maybe get a nice\nAirbnb or get a hotel for a couple days\nor maybe get pitch a tent and go camping\nand then what I want you all to really\ndo is think about okay how can I satisfy\nthis value in the simplest way possible\nso we're not talking about duplicating a\ntrip that other people are taking what's\none thing that I can do to feel a little\nbit more connected what's one thing that\nI can do to explore hell go to a museum\nin your city that you've never been to\nbecause we all go always go to museums\nwhen we travel somewhere else but we\nactually don't take advantage of the\ntouristy kind of things in our own City\nand something cool will happen when you\nstart to do that because when you set a\ngoal for yourself when you think a\nlittle bit about your values and you\nstart to move towards them that's what\nleads to contentment and I know it\nsounds kind of weird contentment isn't\nfulfilling your fantasies contentment is\nprogress towards your values and that's\nwhat's really cool is once you start\ndoing this you're going to start doing\ncool stuff and you'll start to feel\nbetter about yourself I know it sounds\nkind of weird you may think but if I\nwant this desire\nand don't have to fulfill the desire to\nbe content actually no because if we\nsort of think about the nature of Desire\nfulfilling a desire doesn't make it go\naway long term it actually increases it\nover time so instead what we want to do\nis progress towards our values so take a\nlook at what someone's doing figure out\nwhat you care about in terms of what\nthey're doing and try to build it into\nyour own life in a very small way and\nwhat I'd recommend is over the course of\nthree to seven days try to take one step\nforward towards what that value is\nand then once you start to do that a\nlittle bit by all means post on social\nmedia right and this is where we sort of\nget to the really fun part which is that\nyou get to induce fomo and other people\nand so let's say two of your friends are\ngoing to France for a week and you're\nlike that's super cool but I'm gonna go\ncamping for three days and then you post\nabout it right and you're gonna be like\nyeah I'm gonna go camping or you come\nback and you kind of say hey I went\ncamping for three days by myself it was\nreally awesome I got to hang out I got\nto you know go on a hike I got to make a\nfire I got to see some Wildlife it was\nreally cool and like camping and stuff\nlike that is actually really fun and\nthen you're gonna come back and you're\ngoing to be healthier because you\ninhaled all these plant aerosols you got\nfresh air you were disconnected from the\ninternet which has its own advantages\nand then you're gonna post about it and\nthen you're gonna start inducing fomo in\nother people\nso the real antidote to fomo the real\nway to become immune to fomo is to feel\nlike there's nothing missing on the\ninside the fear of missing out and when\nwe are unfulfilled internally that makes\nour minds very very vulnerable to fomo\nbecause we've got these two really\ncritical circuits these primitive\ncircuits in the brain of wanting what\nother people want in fear of\nostracization and fomo tackles both of\nthose and the real challenge is that our\ncortical structures of the brain are\nlogic and all this other kind of stuff\ndoesn't really work it kind of fixing\nthose problems so I encourage y'all to\nreally lean towards your values start to\ntake a couple of small steps and you\ndon't have to go all the way and as you\ndo that you'll start to build\ncontentment and you will start to induce\nfomo in others so good luck and keep us\nposted on what y'all ended up doing and\nwhether it worked or not\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]"
