    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about the\nNeuroscience of\n[Music]\nEnlightenment so if you look at these\nEastern spiritual Traditions they have\nthis concept of Moka or Liberation\nEnlightenment this state of basically\npermanent happiness which is impervious\nto all of the vagaries of the world\naround us but if we look at the science\nwe don't really see a whole lot of\nevidence of that right so we have these\nstudies on meditation or mindfulness\nthat will show reductions in anxiety or\nimprovements in quality of life but no\none using a mindfulness app is becoming\npermanently happy for the rest of their\nlife so it seems like we don't really\nhave any Neuroscience evidence of\nEnlightenment or do we oh suspense So\ntoday we're going to understand the\nneuroscientific mechanisms of\nEnlightenment how to cultivate\nparticular things in your life that will\nlead you to happiness that could be a\nlittle bit more permanent that could be\na little bit more impervious to your\ncircumstances which may sound really\nconfusing because if we look at\nhappiness research it actually points Us\nin the opposite direction there's\nstudies that show that for example if\nyou have lots of friends you're more\nlikely to be happy if you make more than\n$100,000 a year you're more likely to be\nhappy these are all correlational\nstudies that basically look at the\ncircumstances of your life and will\nbasically tell you okay the better your\ncircumstances are the more likely you\nare to be happy so if you were born with\na silver spoon in your mouth and a gold\nspoon up your butt then good luck you\ndid you won the lottery and you're more\nlikely to be happy the challenge with\nall of these studies on happiness is\nthat they don't really give us\nactionable information right so if this\nsecret to happiness is making a bunch of\nmoney and having a lot of friends that's\nnot necessarily something you can\ncontrol it's a huge problem because you\ncan move in that direction But\nultimately people may not like you you\nmay get fired from your job you can't\njust wake up tomorrow and make 100 Grand\nand as I've seen in my clinical\nexperience it's not clear that money\nbuys happiness money does buy security\nwhich can be one of the components of\nunhappiness or fear or anxiety but it's\nnot like making infinitely more money\nactually increases your happiness so\nwhat does the Neuroscience of Happiness\ntell us what do we know about sort of\nprinciples of Neuroscience that could\ngive us a clue how we can be happy in\nspite of our circumstances and\nthankfully there's a lot of great\nevidence of this we're going to start\nwith dopamine so this is our basic\npleasure chemical and the yogis say that\nchasing our desires or basically\nsatisfying our dopam energic system will\nnot lead to happiness and it turns out\nthat they're right so here's what we\nknow about the dopam energic system so\nanytime we get a release of dopamine we\nget some amount of pleasure and then we\nalso get some amount of anticipation so\nthis is what dopamine does anytime\ndopamine gets released we feel good and\nwe get anticipation and we get\nbehavioral reinforcement so I'm kind of\nlumping those two together so when we\ntalk about anticipation the other way to\nthink about it is craving so anytime I\ndo something dope and energic I enjoy it\nand I want more now this would be\ntotally great if it were not for one\nfundamental feature of life which is\nthis thing called adaptation so\nall living organisms adapt right they\ndon't just live the same way over and\nover again and this is why dopamine will\nforever be a trap so let's understand\nthis let's say I play a video game so I\nget five units of pleasure and then what\nhappens is my brain is like that was\ngreat let's get some more and so then I\nhave five units of anticipation or\ncraving I want to play again right I\nwant to achieve what I achieved the\nfirst time the problem is that when I\nget these five units of uh anticipation\nI also get one unit of\nadaptation so what that basically means\nis we velop a tolerance so this is a\nfeature of human evolution like life\nEvolution really so for example like you\nknow you can drink one cup of coffee the\nfirst cup of coffee in your whole life\nand you'll be like wired forever but as\nyou develop a tolerance what literally\nhappens with dopamine is that we remove\ndopamine receptors from our cells so the\nmaximum dopamine signal that we can\nreceive actually goes down so let's look\nat what happens practically right so I\ndo this action once and I get five units\nof pleasure I get five units of\nanticipation and I get one unit of\ntolerance so now the second time I\nengage in the activity I only get four\nunits of pleasure because I have this\none unit of adaptation so my maximum\npleasure goes down the problem though is\nthat the craving is based on this the\ncraving actually doesn't go down the\ncraving Remains the Same so now as I\nengage in the second round of the\nbehavior I get one more unit of\nTolerance and four only four units of\npleasure so this wasn't quite as fun so\nnow what I end up with is a one unit of\ndeficit right because I have five units\nof craving I want this much fun but this\ngame wasn't that much fun so what do I\ndo again let me let me play again so\nthen I play another round and now I have\ntwo stacking units of Tolerance okay so\nI end up with three units of pleasure\nfive units of craving a Delta of two and\nanother unit of Tolerance and if you\nlook at any pleasurable activity in life\nthis is basically what you will find\nright so when you the first time you\nplay through a game oh my God it's so\nmuch fun it's so epic and I saw a thread\nrecently where people were like if you\ncould wipe one game out of your mind and\nhave amnesia which game would you pick\nso that you could experience it for the\nfirst time so embedded in that idea is\nthat the first time we do things is the\nmost pleasurable right except for losing\na virginity because we don't we don't\nknow how to have sex yet anyway so\nthat's a conversation for a different\nday and so this is the core problem with\ndopamine which is that if we are relying\non it for pleasure there are diminishing\nreturns and so the yogis sort of figured\nthis out and they said well hold on a\nsecond if we're chasing pleasure in life\nit will never lead to sustained\nhappiness and we see this very\npractically right so we'll have people\nwho will chase one dopaminergic activity\nafter another dopaminergic activity\nafter another dopaminergic activity and\nsome people will even develop almost\nlike their life is an art of Hedonism\nright so they'll try to figure out I\nworked with patients for example who\nhave poly substance use so what does\nthat mean that means they're not just\naddicted to one substance they're\naddicted to a lot of substances and how\ndoes that work it's because this\nprinciple of tolerance so the first time\naround I'm going to do THC but since I\nget diminishing returns on that now I'm\ngoing to use Aderall to get five units\nbecause it's a new source of stimulus\nand then I'm going to play a video game\nwhich is five units and then I'm going\nto basically rotate between dopam\nenergic activities so you'll have some\npeople who will try to develop this sort\nof perfect hedonistic lifestyle where\nI'm eting really good and I'm playing\nvideo games and I'm having sex and I'm\ndoing drugs and it sounds awesome but\novertime these people are not happy I\nthink a great example of this if yall\nare familiar with Mike pner and he you\nknow made this F famous song called I\ntook a pill in Aiza and then many years\nlater he had this awesome like Instagram\nstory or whatever he was talking about\nhis journey and how he used to chase\npleasure and like where he is now it's\nlike super inspirational and stuff but\nthe key thing that I found is that\npeople will try to rotate between\ndifferent pleasures and you'll notice\nthat you do this too because after\nplaying the same game for a little while\nyou want to switch to a different game\nyou want to watch something maybe watch\nsome anime maybe do something else fun\nmaybe go go out drinking we rotate\nbetween dop and energic things but it\nnever leads to sustained happiness hey\nall if you're interested in applying\nsome of the principles that we share to\nactually create change in your life\ncheck out Dr K's guide to mental health\nit combines over two decades of my\nexperience of both being a monk and a\npsychiatrist and distills all of the\nmost important things I've learned into\na Choose Your Own Adventure format so\ncheck out the link in the bio and start\nyour journey today the second thing that\nthe yogis talk about is the removal of\nego so they say that as long as you have\nan ego you will not have sustained\nhappiness now it turns out that\nNeuroscience actually supports this as\nwell so often times we have this sense\nof identity right so I say oh I'm I'm\nAll Oak and let's say I feel like I'm\nnot happy with the way that I look and\nwe have this idea that if I'm unhappy\nhappy with something about myself fixing\nthat thing will lead to more happiness\nright so if I get in shape I will be\nmore happy seems very very logical seems\nvery very simple seems like a fact of\nlife but if we look at the Neuroscience\nof it that's not true so if we look at\nour ego our sense of identity chances\nare this has to do with a part of our\nbrain called the default mode Network so\nthis is a it's really a circuit it's not\nlike an anatomical part it's connections\nbetween different parts of the brain and\nwhen the default mode network is active\nwe are thinking about ourselves and it\nturns out that when I am unhappy about\nmy body it's not the part of my body\nthat actually causes my unhappiness it\nis the fact that I'm thinking about\nmyself this is really where the\nunhappiness comes from so I want youall\nto think about your own experience right\nso when you reflect too much on yourself\nand we see this a lot in depression so\nfor example like in studies on\ndepression we know that these patients\nhave a hyperactive default mode Network\nso what that means is that they're\nconstantly thinking about themselves and\neven if one thing gets fixed the default\nmode network is still active and it will\nfind something else to think about so\nwhen I work with people who have highly\nactive default mode networks are very\ndepressed even if something goes right\nin their life they don't feel satisfied\nbecause the mind finds something else we\nalso see this in cases of things like\nanorexia or body dysmorphia where isn't\nit isn't fixing a particular thing that\nleads to happiness it is the fact that\nthis part the self-critical part of your\nbrain the part of your brain that is\nthinking about you and judging you your\nego as long as it is active you will be\nunhappy no amount of progress no amount\nof facial surgeries or Buckle fat\nremovals or Botox injections will fix\nbody dysmorphia that's the nature of it\nand what do we know about the\nNeuroscience of these conditions it is\nhigh activity of the default mode\nNetwork it also follows and we have\nclinical evidence of this that disabling\nthe default mode network is what leads\nto relief so when someone is depressed\nabout their life fixing all of the\nproblems that they perceive doesn't\nnecessarily lead to happiness the\nfastest way to stop someone from being\ndepressed is actually a ketamine\ninfusion so I don't recommend that\nyou'll go abusing it if you get\nprescribed that's a different story but\nwhat we know is that ketamine is a\ndissociate of agent which means that it\nunplugs us from our sense of self we\nalso know that the default mode Network\ncan sometimes be\ndisactivation is a very good way to dis\ndeactivate the default mode Network so\nonce again it seems like the yogis were\non to something when they said remove\nyour ego from the equation because once\nthe default mode Network gets\ndeactivated this is when we're happy it\nis not in satisfying our views of our s\nthat are not very good that actually\nleads to happiness it can lead to\nprogress in some degree of contentment\nbut that too depends on whether the\ndefault mode network is active when you\nare done so if I feel unhappy about my\nbody the question is after I work out\nwhat happens to my default mode Network\nthe more active it is the more unhappy I\nwill remain whereas often times what\nhappens when we move in the right\ndirection is we actually disable the\ndefault mode Network so that's still the\nkey principle at play the third\nprinciple that we're going to talk about\nis living in the present which is really\nfantastic because everyone's like oh\nyeah man I'm trying to like live in the\npresent so like I'm not going to pay\nrent and I'm not going to pay you back\nbecause that's in the future and I'm\nliving in the present so I'm going do\nwhat I want I'mma live in the present\nI'mma play video games I'm G get hot\nit's going to be great I'm living in the\npresent turns out that living in the\npresent is absolutely a fantastic idea\nand the reason for that is because our\nbrain is honestly a little bit scuffed\nthere's one basic problem with living in\nthe future so if we look at the\nNeuroscience of our brain when we\nproject into the future we can actually\nexperience a hypothetical pain but we\ncannot experience a hypothetical\npleasure so I'll give you all just a\nsimple example of this okay so if you\nlook at someone who's stuck in an\nanxiety Loop they're worrying about the\nfuture and then if you literally look in\ntheir brain when someone is having an in\nan anxiety Loop or a panic attack the\nparts of their brain that\nexperience okay so this means the\nfeeling of it the experience not\nhypothetical the parts of their brain\nthat experience negative emotion are\nactive so when you are thinking about a\nfuture negative event you can literally\nfeel pain you can feel shame you can\nfeel guilt you can feel fear all of\nthese negative emotions are possible\nfrom hypotheticals and this is what's so\nterrifying when I work with people who\nstruggle with anxiety because they don't\njust have one they don't experience the\npain of one bad outcome they experience\nthe pain of a hundred bad outcomes\nthey're thinking this could happen and\nthat hurts oh my God that hurts and then\nI'll be embarrassed and then this will\nhappen and then oh my God that hurts and\noh my God that hurts and oh my God that\nhurts and it's crazy because they're\nliterally experiencing more pain through\nthese hypotheticals than they would if\nthis action actually happened and only\none outcome happened even one bad\noutcome is one unit of pain but they're\nprojecting into the future and they\nexperience a lot of pain now the scuffed\nthing about our brain is that this\ndoesn't work for pleasure our brain does\nnot hypothesize pleasure in get a spurt\nof dopamine right like you can't you can\nthink you can be anxious about the\nfuture and feel like ashamed and your\nheart rate will go up and all this kind\nof crap that can happen here and now but\nyou can't think about playing video\ngames and get that Rush of dopamine you\ncan't think about having sex and get the\npleasure of an orgasm our brain is just\nnot designed to do that and that's\nwhat's so scuffed and we see this a lot\nin studies on things like neuroeconomics\nwhere I'll ask you okay you have a 100%\nchance to get $100 I can just give you\n$100 right now or there's a 50% chance\nto get\n$250 which one do you pick right and the\nmajority of human beings even though we\nknow that\nstatistically $250 onage average I will\nget 125 I value the 100 guaranteed more\nthan the potential loss of nothing so if\nwe really look at it in our brain the\nway we make calculations losses are\nworth more than gains they're valued at\na higher rate and this is a principle of\nbiology this is baked into our\nneuroscience and what is the mechanism\nof that the reason that our brain values\nlosses more than gains is because of\nthis basic principle of a hypothetical\npain being experienced in the present so\nas you're thinking about do I want $100\nin my hand or but what if I don't get\nanything what if I get zero that hurts\nso much so that tiny amount of hurt\nversus the pleasure of oh crap I've got\n$250 that's awesome right that sort of\ndiscrepancy between the way that our\nbrain actually works makes it so that\nlosses feel more real and will cause\nsuffering so what do the yogis do the\nyogis conclude very easily that okay so\ndon't live in the future because it's a\nrigged game right so if you're living in\nthe future you can experience the pain\nbut you can't experience the pleasure\ntherefore live in the present so another\ngreat example of this is casinos because\ncasinos operate on the same principle\nbut in the opposite direction a casino\nis basically designed by the most evil\nYogi on the planet because what do\ncasinos try to incentivise you to do the\nreason they keep people hooked is\nbecause they keep you they prevent you\nfrom from thinking about your future\nlosses because they know that if you\nstart thinking about the future losses\nthen you will have a huge problem so\nthey'll even do things like they'll\nchange the lighting in the casino so you\nhave no sense of time right whether it's\nday or night it all looks the same\nthey're literally implementing things\nthat remove the dec the the realm of\ntime from your brain we can also look at\nthings like anytime you lose they don't\nlet you dwell on it so the moment you\npull something on a slot machine there's\nanticipation anticipation anticipation\ndidn't work and then you can just pull\nagain when I work with people who are\ngambling addicts and casinos will Design\nthis on purpose you're actually playing\nwith six slot machines at the same time\nI had a patient who would walk down and\nback pulling levers pulling levers\npulling levers pulling levers right\nthey're not thinking at all about the\nfuture Dimension they're actually\nengaged in a lot of sensory stimuli and\nanytime there's a loss you can pull\nagain and you can focus on the present\nso they're keeping you relent LLY\nfocused on the present and they do this\nwith the winning as well because when\nyou lose it's not like there's some w\nw no no no no the second that you lose\nyou can pull again and you can play but\nwhat about when you win when you win\nthere's lots of money and the money\ncomes out slow right it's not like they\ncredit your account it's like the money\ncomes shooting out and they have to\nspend a lot of time picking it up and\nthere's lots of noise and lots of lights\nand everyone's paying attention and so\nthey are bringing you to the present\nbring bringing you to the present\nbringing you to the present so they\nbring you to the present to experience\npleasure and they keep you away from the\nfuture in in terms of avoiding pain and\nremoving the dimension of time it's\nactually brilliant if not predatory the\nlast thing that the yogis kind of talk\nabout is one-pointedness of the mind and\nthey say as long as your mind is\none-pointed you will be closer to\nhappiness so let's take a look at this\nso if we look at a lot of the nature of\nemotional suffering ing or mental\nsuffering if we look at Psychiatry what\nwe tend to find is that people who\nsuffer have a two trck mind so if we\nlook at something like social anxiety if\nI go out on a date and I have social\nanxiety I'm not focused on the task I'm\nnot with this person 100% 50% of me is\non the date and 50% of me is running a\ncommentary subtitles director's cut\nthinking about oh does this person like\nthis does this person not like this so\nwhat we tend to find is that anytime we\nhave a TW track mind it will lead to\nsuffering because what is that second\ntrack it is a commentary on the\nexperience of life itself right so even\nif I'm doing something like let's say\nI'm taking a test and there's a question\nthat I don't know I can try to answer\nthat question but the simplest way to\nimprove or make my suffering worse to\nenhance increase my suffering let's say\nthat is to think about the consequences\nof getting the action wrong so I don't\nknow the answer to this question right\nthat is some amount of pain fair enough\nbut if I start projecting this means\nthat I'm going to get a B on the test\nthis means that I'm going to get a B in\nthe class if I get one B in the class\nit's impossible to get a 4.0 if I don't\nget a 4.0 I won't be able to go to\nmedical school or law school or MBA or\nwhatever these other I won't get the\nscholarship and then the Cascade of\nevents happens right so if you really\npay attention what you find is that\nsuffering correlates with the fractured\nnature of the mind and the opposite is\nalso true this is why we love non-boring\nvideo games so what does a non-boring\nvideo game do it keeps us 100% focused\non the game at hand what are the games\nthat we enjoy the most it's the ones\nwhat what are the ones that are the this\nfull of butt clenching moments and on\nthe edge of your seat right like it's\nlike we're right on the edge and if you\nlook at some of these like um you you\nknow battle arena kind of games where\nthe world is constantly shrinking why do\nthey do that it's to keep you constantly\nengaged\nkeep you focused keep you so that a\nmoment of distraction costs you so much\nright this is also why if you look at\nvery simple game mechanics like damage\nto HP pools a lot of times over time\nwhat we see in video games is the damage\nto HP pool is very favorable for like\none-shotting things right so it's not\nlike I have a thousand health and I do\n10 damage I don't know if yall remember\nthis game War which is a card game where\nit's like I flip over one card and you\nflip over one card and and whoever gets\nthe higher card gets both of the cards\nright and the goal is to like wipe out\nthe other person this is the most\n boring game on the planet\nbecause the HP pool is super high and\nthe DPS is super low so we're sitting\nthere blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\nblah blah and what do you do when you\nplay war you're not like Focus you're\nlike oh my God butt clenching moment\nlike what's going to happen next which\ncard you're like this is so\nboring like give me some other game and\ngames are designed in the exact opposite\nthey keep you one-pointed and so the\nyogis actually figured out that\none-pointedness of the Mind correlates\nwith happiness this is why we love doing\nthings that are in the Flow State even\nwork can be pleasurable if we can\nachieve flow because it's\none-pointedness of the mind it's not the\naction it's not the outcome it is\none-pointedness this is also why orgasm\nis so addictive because in the moment of\norgasm we have a one-pointed mind this\nis a physiologic and neuroscientific\nmechanism where all thoughts of the\nfuture all thoughts of what the other\nperson is is it good for the other\nperson too all of those disappear from\nour mind and when we think about\nsomething like the sexual act right\nwhich maybe not everyone can relate to\nfair enough but y'all will get there one\nday so if we think about the sexual act\nthat too we can realize that the joy of\nthis can be shattered if we ever stop\nfor a second and think about the other\nperson right so if we're just having sex\nand we're having fun but the moment that\nwe create a TW track mind is it good for\nthe other person is they enjoying it am\nI doing too much am I doing too little\nshould I be doing this should I be doing\nthis that commentary in our head is\nwhere our suffering comes from so it\nturns out that we actually do have a lot\nof evidence for this concept of\nEnlightenment it turns out that if we\nliterally look at our Neuroscience\nstudies of the way that these different\ncircuits of our brain work it actually\nmakes sense that if you are able to\nconsistently Implement these four things\nwhich are first of all not chasing\ndopamine and pleasure because there's no\nway that'll lead to sustained happiness\nsecondly to disable the ego which is\nliterally what some of the strongest\ntreatments in Psychiatry are designed to\ndo is just literally unplug your ego\nthese are things like ketamine and\npsychedelics third thing is to focus on\nthe present because our brain is kind of\nscuffed it's kind of scuffed it's like\nrigged that it can experience a\nhypothetical pain but not experience a\nhypothetical pleasure and the fourth is\nto be one-pointed with your mind now the\ncrazy thing is that if we Implement\nthese four things what I seen in my own\nlife and what I have literally helped\nhundred of people do is to become happy\nin their own lives this is not about the\ncircumstances of your life and this is\nwhat's so powerful about this see the\nproblem with\n$100,000 a year and being 6 feet tall or\nif you're a woman having an hourglass\nshape in a thigh gap right I've worked\nwith women who have worked so hard to\nget thigh gaps because the thigh gap\nmeans happiness so we go in our lives\nalways trying to chase these external\nthings we try to achieve these\nparticular things we try to Chase these\nparticular Pleasures but that means that\nthe true control the decider of my\nhappiness is on the outside world if I\ndon't get a promotion that means I'm\nunhappy the crazy thing is that the yogi\nsaid if you really stop and think about\nit you can control perfect happiness you\ncan be permanently happy in spite of\nyour circumstances and the crazy thing\nis that as we look at this\nneuroscientific research we know that\nit's not about particular outcomes it is\nabout activation and deactivation of\nparticular parts of your brain this is a\nscientific fact right so if my amydala\nis active when I am panicking about\nsomething this will lead to suffering\nthis is a scientific fact when I am not\nactive when my amigdala is not active\nand I am not in anxiety Then I am\nBlissful we know this this is also\nsubjective experience so the key thing\nis to cultivate these four things and as\nyou live in alignment to these\nprinciples you will move closer to a\npermanent state of happiness\nB\n[Music]"
