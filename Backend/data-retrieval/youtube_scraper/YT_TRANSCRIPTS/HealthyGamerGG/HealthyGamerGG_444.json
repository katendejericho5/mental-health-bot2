    "transcript": "we're going to teach y'all how to make\nfriends using two rules in under two\nminutes so friendship requires two basic\nthings first thing it requires is common\ncause so people have to be there for a\nshared purpose this is the first way\nthat human beings bind together the\nsecond thing that they need is regular\nunplanned interactions so you need to\nsee this person more than once without\nthe two y'all making a plan to see each\nother this is why we make friends in\nplaces like classes because we show up\nwe've got to study for the same test and\nwe get to see each other day after day\nafter day after day without either of us\nforcing it the problem that we run into\nnowadays is that we try to force\ninteractions with people so it feels\nlike way too artificial and pressured\nand the second thing is that you can't\nlike randomly meet people and make\nfriends with them because you have no\ncommon cause so if you want to make\nfriends what you need to do is check\nthese two boxes"
