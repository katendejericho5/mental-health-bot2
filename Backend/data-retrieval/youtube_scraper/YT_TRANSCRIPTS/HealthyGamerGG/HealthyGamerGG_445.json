    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how red\nflags can actually lead to successful\nrelationships and how green flags can\nactually sabotage successful\nrelationships\nso I first noticed this as a\npsychiatrist when I was working with my\npatients\nand some of them would have really\nsuccessful marriages long-term\nrelationships and as I ask them a little\nbit about how did you get into this\nrelationship you know how did your\nrelationship start I was stunned by how\nmany red flags were at the beginning of\nvery successful long-term relationships\nand even in my own life I know my wife\ncertainly had a red flag or two I was\nbasically like a whole parade I was like\naddicted to video games failing out of\ncollege no job after two years being\nsupported by my girlfriend was going\nnowhere very rapidly in life and yet\nwe're still like happily married with\ntwo kids and we've been together for\nlike almost 20 years at this point and\nso how does that work because there's\nthis idea that if there's a red flag in\na relationship you should just dump them\nand run if you're ready to take the next\nstep on your mental health Journey check\nout Dr K's guide it's an immersive\nresource that distills over 20 years of\nmy experience laid out in a way that is\ntailored to your needs so if you're\nready to better understand your mind and\ntake control of it check out the the\nlink in the description below so it\nturns out that when there's a red flag\nearly on in a relationship it leads to\nproblems and generally speaking we think\nproblems and relationships are bad right\nbut if you look at what leads to\nsuccessful relationships over time it is\nthe ability to navigate through problems\nand so one really interesting thing\nhappens in Red Flags in early\nrelationships if you voice this problem\nto your partner one month in two months\nin three months in\nthen you get to know something that's\nvery very important that will indicate\nthe long-term health or illness of a\nrelationship which is how do we navigate\nproblems and what I've seen in just\nabout all of my patients is when there\nwas a problem early on the in the\nrelationship these two people either\ndecide then and there okay are we like\nwilling to work through this do we have\nthe skills to work through it do we have\nthe desire to work through it and then\nyou kind of navigate in that\nrelationship you're sort of stress\ntesting the relationship with the red\nflag really early on and then that leads\nto actually very good prognostic signs\nyou know in my case I sort of got my\nlife together when my my wife girlfriend\nwas like you know hey like this is not\nworking this is the way I can support\nyou this is what I need to do and could\nI swallow my pride and actually make an\neffort to change for the sake of this\nperson and so the really interesting\nthing is that red flags basically stress\ntests are problem solving capability\nwhich is a really really good prognostic\nfactor for a successful relationship\nlong term because if you've got someone\nwho's got a red flag and they're willing\nto actually change that's someone that\nyou may actually want to spend the rest\nof your life with\nnow let's talk a little bit about green\nflags because there's also this idea\nthat oh you know like the better this\nperson is I'm looking for the perfect\npartner the more perfect they are the\nmore successful the relationship will be\nbut I want y'all to just like pay\nattention to this for a second right and\nthink about data think about the people\nthat you know who are happily married\nand the people that you know that are\nunhappily single or whatever or in\nunhappy relationships and think about\nwhat their standards are right so when\nsomeone's looking for the perfect person\nthey need to do this they need to do\nthis they need to do this they need to\ndo this what does that actually do to\ntheir relationship prospects it has\nreally interesting sort of implications\nfor what they end up with the first\nproblem is that sometimes they find what\nthey're looking for\nand why is that a problem well so if I'm\nlooking for like these six things and\nthese check my Criterion you lucky\nperson out there you check my criteria\nyou're perfect enough for me right\nyou're perfect enough therefore I should\nbestow upon you the grace of being able\nto take me out on a date and buy me\nthings\nright and so this is what happens and\nthis person is perfect enough and if\nthat person is perfect enough sometimes\nwhat happens is we are willing to like\nbypass a lot of these conflicts if this\nperson does everything that I want them\nto do there isn't a whole lot of\nconflict early on so we get into the\nrelationship six months later seven\nmonths later eight months later a year\nlater two years later and then the\ncracks start to show in the relationship\nthis person is perfect but they do this\nstuff\nbut they do this stuff and this creates\na problem because sometimes what then\nwhat that creates is some kind of\nconflict which then either since you've\ninvested so much time in the\nrelationship you're willing to like\nyou know like kind of let that slide and\nlet some of that red flag Behavior slide\nbecause this person is so perfect anyway\nor what happens is you'll end up in\nConflict you'll end up breaking up\nyou'll end up separating in some way\nbecause you all didn't sort of navigate\nthat conflict because this person is\nperfect in so many ways they're a doctor\nand they're tall and they're rich or\nthey're beautiful and they've got big\ntits whatever maybe all of the above\nright and then since they have all of\nthese things they're not willing to\ncompromise because they are worth so\nmuch that hey it's take it or leave it\nif you can't handle me at my worst you\ndon't deserve me at my best so all this\nkinds these kinds of attitudes start to\nto emerge when people sort of like check\na bunch of boxes and it really delays\nthis idea of conflict to later in the\nrelationship which then means that\npeople will sink in a lot of time and\nthen this person ends up being not\nperfect and so if you're someone who\nloves all these green flags and you end\nup with breaking up with someone after\ntwo years because they're not perfect in\nsome way what do you end up doing you\nend up adding one more thing to the list\nright the problem wasn't that I can't\nhandle conflict resolution or that we\ncouldn't navigate things or I couldn't\ncompromise and maybe lower my standards\noh my God that sounds so bad the\ninternet is telling me that I never have\nto compromise or lower my senses anyway\nthat's not the problem the problem is\nthat this person was perfect in six out\nof six but I missed number seven and so\nnow what I'm going to do is look for\nseven out of seven and I really want\nsomeone who does this and then the whole\ncycle repeats this person is even more\nperfect you know how do you handle\nconflict oh I handle conflict great\ngreat and then you go three years in and\nthen everything falls apart and now\nyou're running out of time because\nyou're getting older and now you really\nneed to find the perfect person because\nyou don't have time to wait around and\nscrew around\nthis is a problem the second big problem\nwith green flags and people who are\nlooking for the perfect person is that\nwe're oftentimes looking for that person\nto fix something in our lives we're\nlooking for that person to be the\nantidote to a problem that we've got so\na simple example of this is like you\nknow let's say finances right so I'm\nlooking for a partner who can support me\nwhich is totally fine like I think it's\ntotally fine for one partner to\nfinancially support another but one of\nthe biggest mistakes that I've seen in\nrelationships and if you want to know\nwhat leads to toxic relationships it's\nwhen one person is deriving something\nout of the relationship that is beyond\nwhat the relationship should give so I\nshould get some amount of love and\nesteem from my relationship but if I\nhave core self-esteem problems and can't\nsit by myself or have really crippling\nloneliness and I latch on to this person\nin relationship to fix all of my\nloneliness problems or self-esteem\nproblems then that relationship is\ndoomed does doesn't mean that it can't\nget undoomed right because those\nproblems can be worked on but this is\nsomething I mean maybe I'll have like\nworked with someone or dated someone\nwho's very clingy right and what's going\non with clingy this is someone who\nrequires you for their own self-esteem\nand these people will really drain you\nand drain you and drain you because you\ndon't have to demonstrate just your love\nright you don't have to demonstrate to\nthem that you love them you have to make\nup for the lack of love from every other\ncorner of the world and that's too much\nfor one person to handle\nand so what I've started to see more and\nmore is as people get these really\nlaundry list of requirements what people\nare starting to do is almost say like\nhey I'm not going to fix this for myself\nI'm just going to find a partner who can\nfix it for me and so whether it's\nFinancial Independence or it's like you\nknow I need someone who's going to be\navailable 24 7 and it you know refuses\nto go out at night or like is always\ngoing to hang out with me first I need\nsomeone who's going to meet all of my\nemotional needs all the time these\nrelationships are doomed to fail even if\nyou find what you're looking for there's\none last really interesting thing about\nemotionally turbulent relationships and\nwhy human beings are more attracted to\nthem this kind of explains why you can't\nget away from your toxic ex right you\nknow your toxic ex is bad for you in a\nlot of different ways and so you\nsometimes we're confused like why don't\nI just like stop seeing this person why\ndo I respond to their texts I know it's\nbad for me but I can't help myself so it\nturns out that there's a lot of really\ninteresting neuroscience and Physiology\nabout what attracts us to our toxic exes\nso it's a really fascinating study that\nwas done where they had people dating\nand the the only difference between\ndates was that one was on a bridge that\nwas made of stone and the other is on a\nbridge that was like rickety and what\nthey sort of found is that the emotional\nfear of the rickety bridge made people\nfall in love with each other more that\nanytime you're in an emotionally\nunstable environment it causes people to\nbond and so one really interesting thing\nabout red flag relationships I know this\nwas true of my relationship it's true of\njust about all my patients is that early\nlike turbulence in the relationship\ncreates actually a lot of negative\nemotion and then you'll kind of bind\ntogether and work through it and then\nyou've learned something really really\ninteresting which is like okay when I'm\nfeeling bad and when they're feeling bad\nwe're actually a team and we can work\nthrough this problem together it's also\nreally fascinating because the same\nprinciple is why like in that\nemotionally turbulent relationship it\nactually provokes attraction which is\nsort of why like you know there's this\nidea that oh like sometimes like you're\nattracted to dangerous people and like\noh like that person's like a bad boy or\nbad girl or like you know like avoid\ncrazy ladies all right so Bros will say\nthis kind of stuff in like locker rooms\nand things like that\nthey'll use other words which I'm not\ngoing to use here today and there's some\ntruth to that because there's actually\nreally cool studies that show that\nemotional turbulence leads to bonding\nbetween people this is also why we see\nthings like trauma bonding this is also\nwhy people fall in love so easily at\nrehab I've seen this time and time and\ntime again and the one rule that I\nencourage all of my patients to do in\nrehab is don't fall in love\nand at the same time the number of\npatients that I've seen oh yeah what was\nyour the beginning of your relationship\nlike well my partner was addicted to IV\nheroin was shooting up every week and\nwas stealing money from me and I was\nlike why didn't you leave them well now\nthey're sober y'all have been married\nfor 20 years so 25 years you've got a 20\nyear old kid an 18 year old kid and a 14\nyear old kid oldest is often College\nsecond one's applying they have like\nthis awesome marriage right so at the\nend of the day I know it's kind of weird\nbut I encourage you to really think\nabout the impact of red flags on your\nrelationship I want you to think about\nthe impact of green flags on your\nrelationship is this the kind of\nsituation where I'm looking for perfect\nI'm looking for perfect I'm looking for\nperfect and something all always falls\napart are you discounting a large part\nof the population because they meet some\ncriteria and if you really think about\nit you're losing out on something that's\nreally important which is finding a\npartner who's willing to change who's\nwilling to compromise who cares about\nyou enough to change range of\nfundamental aspect of their life and\nthat's probably the kind of person you\nwant to end up with\nas a disclaimer I'm not saying that\ny'all should Chase red flags I'm not\nsaying that y'all should like you know\nif there's someone who's like physically\nabusive or emotionally abusive that you\nshould continue to date them I'm not\nsaying that red flags are good and the\nmore that you have the better off your\nrelationship is going to be what I'm\nsaying is that I'm noticing an\nincreasing trend of people looking for\nperfect and the more that they looked\nfor perfect the more that they delay\nconflict resolution and if you really\nlook at what leads to prognostically's\nvery successful relationships it's the\nability to navigate conflict and\ncompromise and oftentimes as we discount\npeople with red flags we don't give\npeople a chance to change and to grow\nand to whatever that's actually shooting\nUs in the foot so it's just something\nfor you all to think about and hopefully\nbalance a little bit\nif y'all are interested in more we\nactually have a whole resource pack on\ncommunication in relationships and we\nalso have a couple of really solid\nYouTube videos that sort of dive into a\ncouple of these things a little bit more\nso check them out\n[Music]"
