    "transcript": "are we here hello okay\nsorry about that chat\nlet's get started chat okay\nsuper excited today\nwelcome to another healthy gamer GG\nstream my name is Dr alok canoja just a\nreminder that although I am a doctor\nnothing we discuss on stream today is\nintended to be taken as medical advice\neverything is for educational and\nentertainment purposes only if you all\nhave a medical question or concern\nplease go see licensed professional\nhello everybody okay I'm super hyped\nactually this is fun\num so today we've got a couple of cool\nthings to talk about\num so first of all on Friday we're going\nto have Dr Mark Horowitz and we're going\nto do an interview with him it's going\nto be great it's going to be lit Dr\nHorowitz is an expert on depression and\nwe have frequently talked about Dr\nhorowitz's research in our various HG\nthings\nso we're going to be if y'all are\ninterested in learning more about\ndepression definitely check out the\nstream with Dr Horowitz this Friday\num I think he's uh so we'll be talking\nabout depression medication serotonin\nhypothesis is my guess\nso\nwe are also we have a special So today\nwe're going to be doing a stream about\ntrauma so I don't know if you all caught\nour Deep dive into trauma it is one of\nmy most favorite lectures that I have\ngiven\na lot of people have said it is really\nreally good so y'all can check that out\nand today we're gonna go kind of one\nstep further\nso in our Deep dive to trauma we covered\na lot of basics of how to understand\ntrauma there's about like I think the\nvideo is like 36 minutes okay\nso today what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to talk about various\nmanifestations of trauma and particular\nthings so it's like we're going to look\nat uh posts and people asking questions\nand we're going to understand some\nadditional principles about trauma\nso that's super cool\nbut the other cool thing that we're\ntrying for the first time in four years\nI am going to be teaching a live\nWorkshop\nso this is not something that we have\ndone yet at healthygamer\num but we are doing it for the first\ntime and so we're going to be doing a\nworkshop on trauma and the main thing is\nthat this is going to be a kind of\nsolution oriented workshop on how to\novercome various impacts of trauma so\nwhat I've done is taken about\n15 years of work on trauma both from a\nspiritual perspective and about now wow\nI think it's actually 12 years of\nmedical work\nand distilled that into very concrete\nways to fix problems that are related to\ntrauma so there are a couple of\nimportant things to understand\nwhen you go to a psychotherapist for\ntrauma they're good at helping you deal\nwith the pathology of it but one of the\nkey things that I've sort of found as a\npsychiatrist and also as a coach is that\ntrauma affects a lot of dimensions in\nour life that are not fixed by medical\ntreatment right so it's like we can\ntreat PTSD but trauma will have\nmanifestations in our physiology so how\ncan you rewire some of your physiology\nit has manifestations in terms of our\nemotions so how can we sort of\nunderstand from a neuroscience\nperspective what happens to our emotions\nand how we can get reconnected with our\nemotions that in turn leads to things\nlike motivation and behavior\nand there are some aspects of trauma\nthat\nwe don't really deal with in therapy so\nfor example as people go through trauma\nthey start to lose the dimension of the\nfuture now I know that sounds weird but\nbasically when you grow up in a\ntraumatic environment\nwhat you want in planning for the future\nis useless\nbecause someone else has a lot of\ncontrol over your life so there's no\npoint in making plans because you may\nhave a parent who even if you were\nsupposed to go to a slumber party if\nyour parent is abusive and doesn't you\nknow care about what you want there's no\npoint in wanting things in the future\nand what that does over time is\natrophies your ability to plan and\nexecute tasks\nso we're going to talk about that we're\ngoing to talk about how to sort of\nReform your identity after trauma and\nthen we're going to talk about how to\ndevelop a narrative and make meaning\nfrom your experience so some of these\nthings if we look at evidence-based\ntreatment protocols those are fantastic\nright so we have things like EMDR and\nstuff like that those are to treat\nspecific things like PTSD but what we're\ngoing to be covering in the workshop is\nbasically it's an eight-hour Workshop\nover two days a Saturday and a Sunday\nand it's at the end of this month by the\nway\nand it's basically like when I work with\npatients and we we're kind of post PTSD\ntreatment I go through sort of like a\nprotocol a trauma protocol to help them\nrebuild their lives repair their\nrelationships discover who they are find\nmotivation rewire their physiology so\nit's all this other stuff that we've\nsort of distilled down into a live eight\nhour Workshop\num if you all are interested I think let\nme see if there's a command or something\nI don't know if the command is going to\nwork on YouTube\num but y'all can type exclamation point\ntrauma that may work at some point\nand so spots are limited so there are a\ncouple of other things that are unique\nabout this the first is that it is a\nlive Workshop that I'm personally\nteaching so there'll be time for Q a and\naudience interaction and stuff like that\nthe workshop is also not like\nentertainment focused so a lot of our\nstreams and YouTube videos and stuff\nlike that have to be crafted not for\nlike if I do a six hour or eight hour\nthing about you know how to overcome\nthese various impacts caused by trauma\nthat's like people aren't going to stick\naround for that right so this is going\nto be very very Solutions focused it's\ngoing to be very very practical and it's\nbasically a distillation of all of the\nthings that I help people that I work\nwith do and this isn't necessarily\npeople who have diagnosed these of PTSD\nthis is also people like Executives who\nstruggle with forming relationships\nbecause they grew up in households where\ntheir parents were like very very like\nconditionally loving so we'll love you\nand we want you to be the best and we\nneed you to go to Harvard and we need\nyou to become a CEO and we need all\nthese things you need to be number one\nyou need to be number one you need to be\nnumber one\nsixty percent of people\nin the world have adverse childhood\nexperiences that can be almost\nclassified as traumatic and those have\nlingering effects even if they don't\nrise to the level of diagnosis\nand so we're trying to help people how\nto understand the physiology\nunderstand the emotions get reconnected\nwith yourself\num once you can get reconnected with\nyourself you can start to cultivate\nmotivation and plan for the future you\ncan repair a sense of identity because a\nlot of people after they're like you\nknow after they've been shaped by\nsomeone so I also see this in like Asian\nkids but other kids too where I was\ntaught that everything that I wanted is\nworthless and I need to conform to some\nkind of standard and then these kids may\nbe successful but then their their life\nfeels empty and they're like burnt out\nbecause they don't actually care about\nwhat they're doing so how do you\nreconnect with yourself and there's also\ngoing to be an element of spirituality\ninvolved where we talk a little bit\nabout narrative and Karma\nso one thing that we know is that\nscientifically healing from trauma\ninvolves forming some kind of narrative\nover it so why did this happen to me how\ncan I sort of instead of just thinking\nabout this life that has fallen apart\nhow can I start to look forward and plan\nfor life and so it's kind of a stepwise\napproach it's an eight-hour workshop and\nit's live so definitely check it out\num we're giving this a shot you know a\nlot of people have questions are we\ngoing to do it more than one stuff like\nthat and the answer is it all depends\nokay\nso if you guys are interested definitely\ncheck out the trauma Workshop we're\ngiving it you know it's going to be live\nwith Dr K over the course of eight hours\nand if you all are interested in various\nproblems that like I'll kind of run\nthrough them so if you're kind of\nphysiologically hyperactive so what that\nmeans is you experience a lot of anxiety\na lot of stress you can't calm down\nyou're always retreating to like numbing\nthings because otherwise you're anxious\nso you spend time like gaming and maybe\nusing drugs and stuff like that spending\ntime on social media we're going to talk\nabout that we're going to talk about\nreconnecting with your emotions\nso this is a big thing to understand\nwhen people go through traumatic\nexperiences they dissociate and in the\nworst cases this dissociation is a\nclinical dissociation where you lose\ntrack of where you are but in the much\nmore common and milder and\nnon-diagnosable level it comes it\nmanifests emotional numbness so we know\nfor example that trauma causes decreased\nactivity in the corpus callosum so you\nhave your left hemisphere which is\nanalytical and logical you have your\nright hemisphere which is emotional and\nwhen we get traumatized we disconnect\nthe two and when we disconnect the two\nwhen they're emotionally triggering\nexperiences we're very numb with them\nso we can be like called the analytical\nthe problem is when we do that we lose\naccess to the Flow State we lose access\nto emotional motivation and so as we\nnumb ourselves we actually become a\nmotivational so how do you sort of\nreverse that process we're going to dive\ninto all those kinds of things okay\nthere are 200 spots in the workshop\nokay\num\nyeah so if you all are interested and\nand you know I think that like basically\nwhat I've tried to do is distill the\nmost Salient points when I work with\nindividuals and kind of package it for\ny'all and it is eight hours because\nthere's a lot of stuff involved so\ndefinitely check it out\num\nokay should we dive in chat\nokay\nlet's Dive In\ntrauma Workshop has no plans of being on\nYouTube at the moment\nso we have like our Deep dive into\ntrauma and stuff like that but this is\nreally a workshop\nso it's like more Interactive\num and is also like Solutions focused so\ngenerally speaking eight hour marathons\ndo not do well on YouTube\nokay all right let's dive in great\nquestion\nbeing more emotionally aware has has\nmade me sadder what's the deal with that\nI'm just going to keep this short and\nsimple and exactly what the title\nsuggests being more aware and reflective\nof my emotions trauma mental state Etc\nmade me realize I'm a lot sadder than\nwhen I had no clue what was going on in\nthe first place\nbecause I'm thinking about it more and\nfixating on the hows and the whys my\nmental circuitry adapts to hold on to\nthat fixation is if that'll fix it but\nit will keep doing that until I'm tired\nand exhausted and way sadder than when I\nwas blissfully ignorant\nI'm sure many have realized this\nthemselves and I'm also sure that\nrealistically our minds very slowly\nadapt to it enough to end up better than\nbefore\nwe were emotionally aware as long as we\npower through the chaos but I'm just\ncurious about what Reddit thinks Etc\nokay\nso this is a case of someone\nwho is\nmore emotionally aware\nas they become more emotionally aware\nthey become sadder and they feel worse\nand how do we manage that\nso this person says for example that\num\nmade me realize I'm a lot sadder than\nwhen I had no clue what was going on in\nthe first place I'm thinking about it\nmore I'm fixating on it\nand it'll keep going until I'm tired and\nexhausted and way sadder than when I was\nblissfully ignorant\nokay so let's understand something\nso a lot of times we are blissfully\nignorant\nand then we do some kind of emotional\nwork some kind of introspection and we\nbecome sadder\nand then we think like okay this is a\npart of the healing process but this is\nkind of a scam\nbecause I become sadder and now my mind\nis fixating on the sadness and the\nproblem is not fixing itself it's like\nyou progress into a bad zone of sadness\nand then you kind of stall there and\nthen you're like now what actually this\nis worse because even though I've\nuncovered the sadness it's not fixing\nitself and my mind is looping so what's\ngoing on here and how do we understand\nthis\nthe first thing to understand is that if\nyou are not aware of your sadness that\ndoes mean that you are not sad and that\ndoes not mean that the sadness is not\naffecting you\ngenerally speaking when we numb\nourselves to our emotions those emotions\nare still active we just lack awareness\nof them right so if we look at the body\nand the mind\nthe body has all kinds of things that\nare active all the time that we're just\nnot aware of for example\nmy body can be\nuh you know digesting food but I may not\nbe aware that I'm digesting food all the\ntime I may not I'm constantly producing\nurine but my body only lets me know hey\nwe're producing urine when our bladder\nis pretty full\nso even emotions are active all the time\nwhether we're aware of them or not\nespecially in the case when we have\nnumbed our emotions so when we numb our\nemotions we do not process them when we\ndo not process them they end up getting\nstored in some way in our brain and that\nstored emotion will still act so for\nexample one of the ways that numbed\nemotion interferes with us is that it\nrequires some amount of Ram or\nprocessing power to actively suppress\nemotions so when you're someone who\nnumbs yourself out to your emotions\nthe amount of anesthetic that you need\nto numb yourself grows over time right\nso as you get sadder and sadder and\nsadders you get stuck and stuck and\nstuck in life your brain needs more\npower to like run the propaganda in your\nhead so that you don't feel sad and then\neventually all your brain is doing is\nlike suppressing the sadness and this is\nwhen we feel tired all the time we feel\nburnt out we feel like I don't feel like\ndoing anything I have no motivation and\nwhy is that I get curious about stuff I\nget excited about stuff I have goals but\nI have no energy that's because your\nbrain is using all the energy to numb\nthe emotion literally\nwhat happens is you have active emotions\nin the amygdala and in the limbic system\nbut your frontal lobe is expending all\nof its energy to suppress those emotions\nin the most taxing part of our brain is\nactually the frontal lobes our frontal\nlobe is what willpower comes from it's\nwhere planning comes from it's when task\nexecution comes from so when we drain\nour frontal lobes we can't motivate\nourselves to do anything\nso even though you don't feel sad the\nsadness is absolutely affecting you the\nsecond thing is that the sadness affects\nyou in other ways right so when I feel\nsad and I don't realize it when I don't\nfeel the sadness I will get engage in\nbehaviors that I do not understand to\nalleviate the sadness like I will start\nbinge eating or I will reach out to\npeople who are kind of toxic and abusive\nbecause I feel so lonely that I need\nsome kind of connection but since I'm\nnumb to the loneliness since I'm numb to\nthe sadness I'm not aware of what I'm\ndoing and then you wake up one day and\nyou're like why do I keep on doing the\nsame same stupid stuff over and over and\nover again I know it is bad for me but I\ncan't stop if you are in that situation\nthat is a case of suppressed emotions\ncontrolling you from behind this the\nscenes\nsuppress of oceans are like puppets\nthey're like the puppet master and you\nbecome the puppet\nwhere the suppressed emotions are active\nand you're not aware of it and they\ncause you to do all kinds of things\nlower your energy level and make you\nchase weird things that you know are bad\nfor you\nso the first thing that I'd like to say\nis even if you have discovered your\nsadness\nthat's actually a step in the right\ndirection for sure because when you're\nignorant you may be Blissful but you're\nnot in control\nright so this is the other thing to\nunderstand is that we tend to think oh\nignorance is bliss yeah ignorance is\nbliss but ignorance sucks for outcomes\nright if you if you're ignorant of\nthings you can't fix any problems and\nyou can't control your destiny you may\nbe happy but you're going to be stuck\nand so you have to really decide am I\nwilling to pay the price of bliss in\norder to gain control in my life and\nthis is the core problem that happens\nwith human beings all the time\nso even though you may feel Blissful in\nsome way and it's not Bliss it's numb so\nthe other problem with ignorance is\nbliss and emotional suppression is that\nyou're not actually blissful\nwhat's going on is you're numb to the\nnegativity but that numbness also makes\nit hard for you to engage in joy and\nhappiness in life\nokay because some part of you is aware\nthat you're sad so you're not going to\nbe Blissful you're going to numb\neverything down including the Bliss and\nthe joy and then life just kind of\nbecomes like a a dopaminergic Pursuit\nbecause you're not really like content\nor fulfilled\nso now let's talk about okay so now that\nyou become emotionally aware now your\nmind is fixated on this sadness it's\nkind of like it's spinning it over\nyou're not really fixing it what do you\ndo about that\nso yeah to a certain degree\nthe mind will naturally heal it as long\nas you're aware of it but there are a\ncouple of pitfalls we have to watch out\nabout\none thing is that when you engage with\nyour sadness\none thing you've got to be careful about\nis that if you're not careful you'll\nrepeat the same stuff in your head and\nthat is not actually like healing\nanything\nso when we perseverate on an emotion the\nemotion does not go away so\nperseveration means just focusing on the\nemotion without processing it in any way\nand so like repeating the same stuff in\nyour head over and over and over again\ndoes it does not fix the problem so I've\nhad patients for example that will have\nsome kind of breakup like in high school\nand they'll fixate on that breakup and\nhow this is the one that got away and\nnow like their lives would be so\ndifferent and they just think about that\nLoop over and over and over again 10\nyears go by 20 years go by and they\nnever move Beyond it they stay stuck in\nthat place so instead what we need to\nreally do is emotionally process\nso emotional processing is tricky for a\ncouple of reasons the first is that what\nour mind naturally feels like doing with\nthe sadness is not necessarily\nprocessing there's a certain like\naddictiveness to being sad where our\nmind like really likes to feel that\nsadness and that hurt this is sometimes\nthe reason that we stock exes on social\nmedia right like we see them and we see\nthem being happy we see our friends\nbeing happy and we're like oh it hurts\nso much but I can't stop it it sort of\nlike brings out that emotion and really\nmakes it feel valid in some ways\nbut really emotional processing has a\ncouple of different parts\nthe first is to think about things in a\nnew way so generally speaking when we\nlook at trauma and we look at persistent\nsadness unless we start changing the way\nthat we see our situation we'll stay\nstuck in that way\nso even if you can kind of acknowledge\nokay I'm sad because I missed out on\nthese three opportunities\nthere's any you say to yourself like\nokay this also means that I'm screwed\nbecause I've missed out on these\nopportunities I'll never be able to\ncatch up as long as you cognitively\nframe things that way\nthen\nyou'll never actually improve or maybe\nyou'll improve very slowly what's a lot\nmore helpful is we if we start to\ncognitively reflame how can I start\nlooking at this in a slightly different\nway so for example let's say I didn't\ndate anyone in high school or college\nand now I've graduated from college I've\nnever had a boyfriend or girlfriend and\nnow I feel like okay I missed the boat\nso you can look at that and you can say\nI've missed the boat therefore I'm\nscrewed or you can say well at least\nI've acknowledged that this is a problem\nand even if I'm behind I have to\nacknowledge that this is a problem in\norder to catch up\nboth of those are reasonable conclusions\nI've got to make up for lost time or I'm\nscrewed because I missed an opportunity\nboth of those are actually valid\nconclusions but unless we start thinking\nin a new way we're not actually going to\nprocess the emotion or come out of that\nslump\nthere are a couple of other things that\nare very good for processing emotions\nthere are certain forms of meditation we\nhave a whole video about processing\nemotions that you all can check out the\nother thing that you can do is see\nsomeone like a therapist or a coach and\nwork through this stuff right so I have\nanother human being help you cognitively\nreframe that's very helpful as well\nand then the last thing in terms of like\nemotional processing and especially\nsadness let me think about this so we've\ntalked about meditation we talked about\ncognitive reframes yeah then there's the\nother thing that you can do to sort of\nprocess sadness is physical in nature\nso we know that there is a connection\nbetween the body and the mind and we\nknow for example that there are\nmind-body practices like yoga and Tai\nChi which when they're done lead to\nimprovements in mood and will help\npeople kind of come out of that slump\nso there are actually some physical\nthings and we understand this really\nwell in trauma so for example\nthere's a treatment called EMDR which is\neye movement desensitization I forget\nwhat the r is\nmaybe recovery I don't know rewiring who\nknows so in EMDR what we do is there's\nnormally a traumatic memory and normally\nwhat happens is that traumatic memory\ntriggers a physiologic response\nso what we do in EMDR is we talk about\nour trauma but we are mentally focused\non you doing a particular type of eye\nmovement\nand the interesting thing is that when\nyou're focused on the eye movement\ntalking about the trauma engaging with\nthe trigger does not cause the\ntriggering response so if we sort of\nthink about a trigger\nthere is a trigger and the whole reason\nwe call it a trigger is because there is\nan automatic response so when we do EMDR\nwe're drawing we're building a wall\nbetween the trigger and the physiologic\nresponse and so if you sort of think\nabout it that's the whole point right so\nthe problem with triggers is that they\ntrigger us we can't handle the exposure\nand then we start to physiologically\nspiral\nso when we do something like EMDR we're\npreventing that physiologic response\nwhich is actually the thing that\ncripples us it's not the trigger that's\nthe problem if I've been bitten by a dog\nthe goal is not to ignore dogs for the\nrest of my life and tell everyone around\nme hey I get triggered by dogs please\nremove your dogs from the house hey I'm\ngoing to a concert I need to tell\neveryone to leave their dogs at home\nbecause I get triggered by it we end up\ngetting controlled by our triggers\ninstead what we want is we want to\ncontrol ourselves we want to regain\ncontrol from the trigger and the way\nthat we do that is through\ndesensitization and deconditioning and\nthings like EMDR are very good at that\nbecause since I'm mentally occupied my\ncognitive Ram is filled with this\nactivity I don't have any cognitive\nspace left to respond to the trigger in\nthe way that I I used to and then what\nhappens is the more that I expose myself\nto the trigger it's basically like\nexposure therapy\nthe more I expose myself to the trigger\nwithout the physiologic response\nsuddenly the trigger is no longer a\ntrigger so even if we talk about these\ntriggers for sadness and getting caught\ninto this spiral of sadness this is why\nwhat we really want to do is decondition\nthat response so how can I engage with\nthe material\nof sadness\nwithout feeling physiologically sad so\nthis is where there's something really\ncool that you can do this is why I love\nhiking for introspection so if you want\nto understand the mechanism through\nwhich hiking and especially trekking so\nwe're talking about like going out by\nyourself for a couple of days you want\nto be safe\nbut what happens is that as you start to\nthink those sad thoughts you're also\nphysiologically active so it's not like\nyou you have pent up anxiety or pent up\nsadness and as you sort of are\nphysiologically active it'll rewire you\nfrom a physiologic standpoint and then\nonce you get rewired from a physiologic\nstandpoint\nthen those triggers will no longer\ntrigger the same degree of sadness or\nanxiety\nso I absolutely think that if y'all have\nare no longer emotionally numb that's a\nstep in the right direction and even\nthough you can feel like this is worse\nbecause you get fixated on the thoughts\nthe thoughts repeat themselves they\ndon't make any progress the good news is\nthat there are several things that you\ncan do to get out of that hump and the\nproblem is if you look at society today\neveryone is telling you oh you should\ntalk about your emotions\nyou should like we should validate\nfeelings and we should support each\nother right and so we all talk about\nlike you do journaling to uncover what\nyou feel\nbut we tell you how to like uncover the\nproblem but we don't tell you how to fix\nit then what do you do Journal more well\nlike it doesn't seem to be working the\nsame Venom seems to be coming out over\nand over and over again every time I\njournal and that's because we don't\nreally know as a society how to process\nemotions we don't teach these skills so\ntry this stuff and see if it helps right\nso uncover the sadness which you\nabsolutely need to because it's screwing\nyou up anyway\nand then use these techniques to kind of\ncome out of it whether it's working with\na therapist or a coach whether it is\ndoing something that sort of\nremoves the trigger from the physiologic\nresponse all that stuff is is good stuff\nquestions\nyeah so when cat is saying walking\nthrough nature is magically helpful\nThings fall into perspective\nso the reason that so here's why nature\nis good for the brain\nso normally when we're not in nature\nand we feel negative emotions those\nnegative emotions release hormones so\nfor example when I'm feeling anxious\nPanic sad that'll activate things like\ncortisol and adrenaline and this is what\na lot of people don't understand\ncortisol and adrenaline go to your brain\nand take things out of perspective that\nis literally what adrenaline does it\ntries to remove all of the perspective\nbecause it wants you to make a instant\nsurvival decision this is not a complex\nnuanced topic with lots of different\nperspectives this is Do or Die\nand when we're at home in these four\nwalls and we have that physiologic\nresponse it shapes our thoughts\nso the anxiety keeps us from having\nperspective right and this is why we go\nto therapists to help us with our\nanxiety the therapist does the work for\nyou of helping you regain that\nperspective\nnow the cool thing is when we're in\nnature\nnature helps us regain perspective by\ncountering the effects of cortisol and\nadrenaline and the way that nature\ncounter these effects is fascinating\nnumber one there are literally plant\ncompounds called aerosols so these are\nchemical compounds which they release\ninto the air\nwhich when they stimulate our olfactory\nreceptors\ninduce relaxation\nso they will literally lower your\nanxiety from a chemical perspective okay\nsecond thing is normally when we get\nsuper anxious we're filled up with that\nenergy and the energy doesn't go\nanywhere so it goes into our mind and\nthen our mind runs a mile a minute and\nwe're kind of running things in here and\neventually we get exhausted and we kind\nof mentally check out\nwhen we get that sympathetic response\nwhen we get that anxiety adrenaline\ncortisol and we're hiking that energy\ngets used up and so what ends up\nhappening is instead of the energy\nbouncing around in my mind my mind calms\ndown my emotions calm down my physiology\ncalms down right because I have all\nkinds of physiologic signals when I'm\nhiking when I'm hiking I'm sending\nsignals to my respiratory system we need\nlong deep breaths stop this\nhyperventilation crap that anxiety\ncauses so we counter the physiologic\neffects of anxiety\ncounter those those hormonal actions\neven induce plant aerosols to to\nchemically calm us down and then the\nbrain is able to get perspective\nbeautiful now you can see things clearly\nand it's because the anxiety itself is\ninterfering with your ability to see\nthings clearly so it's beautiful\nhike very good for you\nhow are the plant aerosols different\nfrom the canned aerosol very different\ncompletely different canned aerosols are\nusually I think made in Labs they're\ndifferent chemical compounds right so a\nsmell\nis not the same thing as something\nthat's effective so you get all kinds of\ncompounds that may not have smell but\nthey still will activate your neurons in\nsome way and will trigger responses\nokay there's a good question about\ndo you have any tips on how to cry\nhaven't been able to cry for 15 years\noh that's a good question\num let's talk about\nokay\nif you haven't cried in 15 years let's\ntalk about how to learn how to cry\nso the first thing that you can do to to\nhelp yourself cry is to have a\nconversation with someone who will help\nyou cry\nso frequently the reason that it's hard\nto cry is because when we get close to\ncrying\nwe will Retreat from it and here are the\ndifferent ways that we Retreat the first\nthing that we do to retreat from crying\nis we intellectualize we start to\nrationalize we start to become resigned\nso we'll say things like it is what it\nis\nand once you say it is what it is what\ncan I do about it you move away from the\nemotion right you move into a space of\nresignation and acceptance\nand you're kind of like then there's no\nemotion to it it kind of disarms the\nwhole thing\nso if you have a conversation with\nsomeone who's really good at validating\nlet them validate you and try to avoid\nall of your intellectual answers so if\nyou pay attention to your conversations\nwith people what you'll find is that you\nshut down\nthe lines of conversation that make you\nfeel emotional you'll rationalize them\naway you'll change the subject or it'll\nget curious about things all kinds of\nstuff will happen so the first thing\nthat you've got to do is start stop\nrunning away from the emotions that will\nlead to sadness\nthe second thing that you can do is\nwatch something or listen to sad music\nget some kind of exposure to something\nthat's very sad\nand while you're watching it or\nlistening to the music or whatever\npay attention to yourself\nand how you are reacting because chances\nare that you will find something within\nyourself that is suppressing the natural\nempathic sad response so when we listen\nto sad music and we watch it like you\nknow a sad movie at the end like\neveryone's crying and that's that's what\nthe movie creators like that's what the\nfilm people like know how to do they can\nmake you cry but we block it ourselves\nso pay attention to that\nand then what I would say is once you\nnotice that block I would let yourself\nkind of breathe and relax into it so\njust breathe and relax like into that\nsadness just let it come out it helps if\nyou're by yourself here right so you can\ntalk try talking to someone but the\nother thing you can do is like you can\ncry in privacy\nand that's the other thing to remember\nis that a lot of the reason that we\ndon't cry is because we're ashamed to\ncry\nand the last thing that I would sort of\ntell you is if you're having trouble\ncrying\nthink about when you learned not to cry\nokay so take a moment to think about you\nknow the last time you cried and what\nwere the lessons that you learned about\ncrying what did you learn about what\ncrying does to you or doesn't do to you\nhow people respond to you when you're\ncrying\nand then I want you to because it's\ngoing to be bad right so it's going to\nbe like someone made fun of you or\nsomeone chances are it'll be something\nlike that and then what I want you to do\nis think about how sad it is\nthat the younger version of you\nwas surrounded by people who would not\nlet them cry that this poor kid was so\nsad and all they wanted to do was cry\nand they're hurting\nand the world shamed them for it the\nworld punished them for it and like wow\nthat's like really sad that you had to\ngo through that right that it's bad\nenough that you're hurting but when\npeople punish you for hurting\nthat's even sadder because how are this\nis the exact time when you should have\ngotten help people should have supported\nyou\nand they punished you instead\nand so just dwell on that for a little\nbit and see if you can feel that sadness\nand let it come it's a process right so\nBuild It Up over time\nand then hopefully with a little bit of\nluck you'll be able to cry again\nyeah so someone's saying what if I feel\nno empathy\nfor the past me very good\nso if you have trouble feeling empathy\nfor your former self and if you struggle\nwith self-compassion\nthe number one reason that it's hard to\nhave compassion for yourself\nis because you're pissed at yourself\nright so when you screw up\nwhen you make a mistake you can do two\nthings you can be have compassion like\noh like you know people make mistakes\nand you were learning and you were young\nyou could say that kind of stuff but\nthat's not what you say to yourself you\nget angry at yourself\nstupid dumbass\nother people figure that out why\ncouldn't you if you just fixed this a\nlong time ago we wouldn't be in this\nsituation in the first place if you had\ngotten over yourself and your anxiety\nand you'd asked that person out then you\nwould have dated someone in high school\nthen you would have dated someone in\ncollege you would have been fine we\nwouldn't be in this problem right now\nbecause here's the reason why it's hard\nto have self-compassion because you have\nproblems in your life today and who is\nto blame\nyou were to blame\nit's all your fault\nand if it's your fault if you're the one\nwho did this to you why the hell would\nyou have compassion you're pissed at\nyourself\nso the number one block for\nself-compassion is being angry with\nyourself\nbecause you're the one to blame\nself-blame and self-compassion come at\nopposite ends of the spectrum\nthen you may say okay well like how do I\ndevelop self-compassion then first\nstart by noticing\nhow you treat yourself\nlike be like wow because it's automatic\nright we don't even realize we don't\nconceptualize it as I am abusive towards\nmyself\nthat's not the way we see it I deserve\nit\nit's not abusive I deserve it\nbe like wow holy crap I am really hard\non myself\nthis is very different from other people\nget to mistakes I don't let myself get\nmistakes we're not saying you need to\nhave compassion and hug yourself just\nnotice what you do\nand the second thing is then ask\nyourself is this the relationship that I\nwant with me\nis this really what I want\ndo I want to blame myself and you may\nfind that the answer is yes yes screw\nthis guy he deserves it\nright and then the the issue is okay\nit's not an issue of whether they\ndeserve it or not now you have to ask\nyourself can I cut this guy a break\nanyway or this girl a break\nlike it's not about what they deserve\ncan I be kind to this person even though\nthey don't deserve it\nbecause kindness is not about what you\ndeserve right that's transactional\nthat's even that's not kindness kindness\nis going beyond what people deserve\nand so this is the way that we think\nabout ourselves and think through these\nquestions and look at your relationship\nwith yourself\nand then you'll understand why\nself-compassion is hard for you because\nyou don't deserve it\nbig surprise\ny'all get that\nit's so hard to feel worthy and feel\ndeserving of good\nso this is my point if you are toxic\ntowards yourself\nyou don't have to deserve to be good you\ndon't have to deserve feeling good you\njust have to have kindness for yourself\nright and that's the whole point is that\nyou don't deserve goodness I mean you do\nbut in in this mindset it doesn't work\nlike that instead what you really want\nto do is take a look at yourself and say\nlike wow even though I don't deserve\nthis self-compassion I'm going to go the\nextra mile and be kind to myself even\nthough I screwed up\nthat's what real compassion is\ncompassion isn't giving people what they\ndeserve it's giving people beyond what\nthey deserve\nright so you can debate with yourself\nabout and that's the problem is you\nnever win right I do deserve it and if I\ntell you no like you deserve to love\nyourself man you deserve to like\neveryone deserves a second chance and\nyou're like\nscrew you I don't deserve a second\nchance everybody else does but I don't\nso like I can argue with you all day but\nit's not going to get anywhere you don't\nyou don't feel like you deserve it so me\ntelling you that is not gonna work\nso instead go one level above it and ask\nyourself okay what kind of relationship\ndo I want to be someone\nwho holds myself accountable\nand Dooms me to a life sentence of\nself-hatred because I made mistakes\neight years ago or four years ago or two\nyears ago do I do I want to give myself\na life sentence it's not about whether I\ndeserve it's like do I want to cut this\nperson some slack do I want to relegate\nthem to a life sentence of self-hatred\nlack of compassion and just to be broken\nor do I want something better for my\nlife and then the crazy thing is you are\nthe one who can give it\nno one else can give it you have to give\nit to yourself\nyou're just so caught up on what you\ndeserve that you're not willing to do\nyourself a favor\nit's crazy\nokay how do you worry how do you prevent\ncompassion turning into oh poor me I\nhave it so hard I worry about that a lot\nwhat a great question so let's\nunderstand\nthat too is self-hatred\nso how to so if I'm compassionate to\nmyself I'm gonna be like oh my God Cry\nMe a River I had it so hard\n[Music]\nand you're like screw that I'm not going\nto be that loser\nI'm not going to be one of those people\nwho like blames their circumstances like\nthat's not what I want to be I'm going\nto be stronger I'm going to be better\nI'm not going to turn into some pity\nseeking POS\nsum like trauma hoarding\nlike Spotlight taking no I don't want to\nbe that\nso there's a lot of self-judgment\nright that prevents you from\nacknowledging that you've had it hard in\nsome way\nand the reason that we think that I will\ngo if I if I open the floodgates a tiny\nbit I'll go all the way right so right\nnow I don't give myself any\nself-compassion if I give myself an\nounce of self-compassion I'm terrified\nthat I'm going to become pathetic and\nlike oh like woe is me\nand why is that it's because there's so\nmuch\nlike water that's damned up right\nthere's so much like emotional energy\nthere that you think that if you let a\nlittle bit out it'll it'll flood through\nyour mind and it'll like wipe everything\naway\nbut that's not how it is that's just how\nit feels because you keep it damned up\nall the time you may feel pathetic about\nyourself for a little while but\neventually the emotional energy will\ndissipate\nthere'll be a flood but a flood doesn't\nstay flooded forever\nand the same is true when we Dam things\nup in our mind and so a lot of times\nwe're afraid of opening the floodgates\nto sadness or anger or whatever because\nwe think there's a lot of it stored up\nthere and why do we think there's a lot\nof it stored up because it takes a lot\nof energy to keep stored up\nbut the only reason that there's so much\nthere is because we never let it out\nright you got to drain it\nand there'll be some emotions that come\nout and that's the whole point\nbut the nature of the human mind is to\nequilibriate from emotional from motions\nso Joy will go away sadness will go away\nit'll always go away that's what it does\nokay great questions\nis this are we doing okay chat y'all\nenjoying this\nokay\nyeah so everyone's okay a lot of great\nquestions let's just talk about so how\ndo I know if I'm sabotaging myself due\nto trauma I'm just bad\nwhat about emotional numbness how do we\ndeal with that I've had a lifelong\nhealth issues it doesn't feel like\ntrauma but I know it sometimes affects\nme how do you stop dissociating it's\nbeen months okay\nso this is why we're doing that trauma\nWorkshop right so definitely check out\nwe're doing a trauma workshop at the end\nof the month where we're going to go\ninto a lot of these practicals\nand so if you all are interested in more\npractical Solutions definitely check\nthat out but there are also some of\nthese answers are to be found elsewhere\nwe're doing a I don't know if you all\nsaw the the person who's asking about\nself-sabotaging y'all should definitely\nwatch our interview with xqc we're\nthinking about doing a standalone video\non the subject but\nxqc describes it beautifully like where\nself-sabotage comes from\nand basically like\nthe way he describes it is\nyeah you all should watch it but he kind\nof talks about how\nyou know he's like trying really hard to\nnot drop this plate because he doesn't\nwant to break the plate but even though\nhe tries really really hard\nto not drop it right he's really anxious\ndon't drop the plate don't drop the\nplate don't drop the plate and then he\nends up screwing up anyway and he drops\nthe plate because maybe he's got ADHD\nand it breaks anyway so his mind then\nlearns like okay even if we try not to\ndrop the plate\nwe're going to be super stressed out\nabout not dropping the plate and we're\ngoing to screw up anyway\nso instead what I can do is sabotage\nright away I can just break break the\nplate because it's going to break either\nway I just have two choices I can break\nthe plate\nand I can be anxious and stressed before\nI break the plate or I can break the\nplate right now\nand then I don't I relieve myself of the\nstress right it's done\ngot it\nseems kind of hard to believe that a\nperson making millions of dollars per\nmonth has relatable issues though yeah\nit does seem hard to believe\nI completely agree but here's the thing\nno amount of money makes you not human\nright this is the crazy thing is that\nyour brain and your body like most of us\nhave two eyes one nose one mouth\nyou know our brain works the same\nwhether you're rich oh actually that's\nnot technically true brain actually does\nwork differently if you're rich or poor\nright so the lack of security leads to\nhigher stress and all kinds of other\nthings like accelerates cardiovascular\ndisease so it's not exactly the same\nbut it's wild that we're all human and I\nknow it's hard to imagine that you can\nrelate to people but I think one thing\nthat we've we've shown I think\nis that you know all human beings are to\na certain degree relatable\nokay\nbefore we go too far down the the rabbit\nhole of xqc\num\nlet me think about\nokay\nso\nI see a lot of questions about how to\nprocess emotions\nso let's do this one okay\n[Music]\nwhat's the best way to release trauma\nand or repressed emotions I Harbor\nrepressed emotions of Shame anger\nembarrassment how should I go about\nreleasing them potentially recalling the\nevent probably deep in subconscious what\ntype of meditation should I do any\nsuggestions would help these emotions\ntraumas are actually causing physical\nailments\nwhen some of these emotions arise it\nbegins to exacerbate one of my ailments\nif someone can help me find the root\ncause of these how do I go about\ndismantling them and permanently moving\non Is A Healer is a healthier individual\nso let's understand something about\ntrauma and emotions\nand physicality\ngive me a second\nhold on a second chat\nno\nokay give me a moment\num\nokay\nso let's understand how to release\nrepressed emotions\nokay\nso\nlet's first understand how emotions\nenter\nour brain and our body\nso we have an event\nokay\nokay so we have an event oh\nwe have an event\nokay and that event gets interpreted by\nour sensory organs\nand then that triggers an emotional\nresponse\nand that triggers a physiologic response\nokay now if we kind of are aware of all\nof this stuff and process all of this\nstuff over time the emotional response\ndecreases the physiologic response\ndecreases and we're fine\nbut there's a problem when we're dealing\nwith trauma\nwhich is that when we're dealing with\ntrauma\nwe have numbness\nso in order to protect ourselves so what\nhappens in trauma is that this right\nhere\nis so overwhelming\nand this is so overwhelming that we\ncan't deal with it like we can't deal\nwith it physically physiologically\nmentally so what trauma does instead is\nwe become numb\nso we do is we block this and we block\nthis so now it's no longer overwhelming\nokay\nnow this creates a problem though\nbecause now that we're blocking stuff\nif we block it this doesn't actually get\nprocessed and the emotions start to\nbuild up the more that we block it the\nmore that our emotions start to build up\nokay and then we also see that there is\na stress response that also starts to\nbuild up and is actually dormant\nI mean it it's suppressed but it's not\ndormant actually or dormant is the wrong\nword it's active but we're not aware of\nit so this is why people who have PTSD\nfor example have different kinds of like\nphysiologic parameters so one example is\ntheir heart rate variability is low so\nheart rate variability is the\nfluctuation in our heart rate so let's\nsay our heart rate normally\nhas a high number and a low number and\nfor most people maybe this is the\nmidline but most people throughout their\nday their heart rate will go up and down\nwhen you have trauma what happens is\nyour heart rate variability is lower so\npeople's heart rate just stays like this\nand why is this\nit's because when we get traumatized\nthere's a physiologic response that\nmakes us elevates our heart rate across\nthe Baseline so we're on a constant high\nalert and if you're on a constant high\nalert\nthen the variability in your heart rate\nis going to be very low right because\nnormally I go through life and I'm not\non constant high alert so sometimes I'm\non high alert up here and then sometimes\nI'm chilling\nbut when I'm on a constant high alert\nafter trauma I'm always sitting up here\nabove the Baseline all the time\nokay so numbness prevents emotional\nprocessing so this is what we kind of\nknow about how to process emotions and\nhow to get rid of this stuff what we\nneed to do\nis something called counter conditioning\nokay so normally what happens is there's\nan event and then the event\nbecomes the trigger\nright if I've been traumatized by\nI don't know hot beverages every time I\nsee the hot beverage\nI will trigger a physiologic response\nso what we need to do is condition our\nphysiology to be different\nand so what we're going to do instead is\nthis is where techniques like EMDR come\nin right so then what I'm going to do is\nI'm going to expose myself to the\ntrigger\nbut right here I'm going to add a\nphysiology\nrewiring\nintervention\nso while I'm exposing myself to the\ntrigger I will do something else that\nprevents this physiological response\nso EMDR is one example of this\nthis is eye movement desensitization\nhiking is another example of this\nokay and then there's also some other\ninteresting things like tapping so EFT\nso we're going to talk about EFT for a\nsecond\nso EFT is something that I thought was\npseudoscience bluntly\nten years ago I was like this is BS\nso emotional Freedom technique is\nsomething that people will use it's\ncalled tapping and they sort of believe\nthat trauma is stored in the body and\nthere's some evidence of this so for\nexample if you look at like epigenetic\nchanges of trauma survivors we know\ntheir physiologic things\nnow there's enough research to suggest\nthat EFT probably helps people in some\nway and let's take a quick look at the\nmechanisms\nso\num\nlet me show you all a good example so\nso EFT protocol breaks the cycle of\nsympathetic nervous hyperarousal more\nrapidly they claim than other forms of\ndesensitization so for example they'll\nlook at uh progressive muscle relaxer\nrelaxation versus\nstimulation at certain acupressure\npoints and what they find is like just\ninducing muscle relaxation is not as\neffective is like focusing on certain\nacupressure points and essentially\nprovide providing acupressure to those\npoints and something about the way that\nit activates the body is like different\nso\num\nso there are there's evidence that\ncertain parts of our brain are\ndeactivated by accupoint generating\nsignals so the main thing here is that\nwe know that there's some kind of like\nweird stuff going on with our body in\nour mind and the cool thing about\ntapping and I think this is what people\nwith acupressure sort of figured out is\nthat there's some way to focally\nactivate some parts or deactivate some\nparts of the brain by focusing on the\nbody in some ways and that sounds\nludicrous like the biological mechanism\nto this doesn't make any sense\nbut we also know for example that\naccupoint stimulation is used in EFT\nreleases serotonin in the amygdala as\nwell as the prefrontal cortex\nso that's kind of interesting right they\nhave studies that show that this focally\nreleases serotonin and if we're thinking\nabout how do we calm down our physiology\nand anxiety or panic disorder we\nactually take medications that boost the\nserotonin in the brain\num and then we also know that accupoint\nstimulation releases things like opioids\nserotonin Gaba\nshutting off the fight flight freeze\nresponse right so this is what's also\ninteresting\nwe get neurotransmitter release like\nGaba and what Gaba does is\nphysiologically shuts off that response\nso when we're talking about okay I get\ntriggered by something how do I process\nthat trauma\nand the big issue is that we think about\ntrauma processing as purely a mental\nthing I have to go talk about my\nproblems\nbut I think part of the reason that\ntrauma is so damn hard to treat\nis because we have assumed that it is\nmental in origin it is because as\npsychotherapists\nwe are not trained in physiology I'm a\nmedical doctor so a psychiatrist is but\nthe majority of psychotherapists are not\nright it's not a knock on their training\nit's just true they don't study the body\nand so then what happens is when we try\nto think about emotionally processing\ntrauma we think about I have to talk\nabout my feelings or I have to journal\nbut especially if you're a dude there's\nsome evidence that vocalizing your\nemotions is not the primary way in which\nmen process their emotions they do it\nusing their body\nand so one of the things if you're\ninterested in like processing your\ntrauma and kind of getting this stuff\nout there it turns out that physicality\nis a big part of it there's also studies\nthat show that hyperbaric oxygen\nChambers\nplus Psychotherapy for trauma helps\npeople reprocess their emotions faster\nthan just Psychotherapy for trauma\nso I would recommend something like\ntriphasic breathing\nright this is a technique that\nis really about taking the deepest\nbreath possible and when you do these\nkinds of techniques bronium and things\nlike that or you do yoga postures or do\nsomething like tapping or go for a walk\nall of these things will affect your\nphysiology\nand as they affect your physiology they\nwill actually help you process your\nemotions because emotions are not purely\nmental they are also physiological\nand so what we want to end up doing is\ndo this counter conditioning where we\nhave a trigger and then we trigger some\nkind of emotional response but there's a\nphysiology somewhere in there and if we\nshut off the physiology we'll fix that\nemotional response once we fix the\nemotional response in the physiologic\nresponse then we can reframe interpret\nand change the narrative around our\ntrauma and that's really when it gets\nhealed the problem is that our mind gets\nso out of whack by our triggers that we\ncan't even leverage our mind to fix the\nproblem\nso focus on the physiology\nokay we've also got videos on how to\nprocess emotions you all can check out\nthings like Dr K's guide if you're\ninterested in triphasic breathing and\nwe're going to go into detail exactly\nstuff like this but in more detail in\nour trauma Workshop\nokay\nquestions\nhow much do you think trauma is\nself-inflicted\nso trauma\nso how much do I think trauma is\nself-inflicted\ntrauma is not usually self-inflicted\nusually the nature of trauma is that\nsomeone else does it to you\nthe tragedy of trauma is that what other\npeople do to you is what you learn to do\nto yourself\nso while the trauma itself is not\nself-inflicted the problem is that once\nsomeone does it to you this is what you\nlearn about yourself and this is what\nyou do to yourself\nso the propagation of trauma is\nself-inflicted\nthe inability to heal from trauma is\npartially self-inflicted\nthe consequences of trauma are\noftentimes self-inflicted and this may\nsound like it's damning right because\nI'm saying oh it's your fault but let's\nlike look at it scientifically\npeople who are abused growing up are\nmore likely to wind up in abusive\nrelationships this is a statistical fact\nand why is this it's because when I get\nabused I think of myself as worthless\nand then if I ever start dating someone\nwho thinks of me as having value it\nconfuses me I don't know how to function\nwith people who actually treat me with\ncompassion it makes me feel\nuncomfortable\na good example of this is if you have\nlow self-esteem and someone compliments\nyou one of two things is going to happen\neither your ego is Gonna Love it or\nyou're going to feel deeply deeply\nuncomfortable if it's like an authentic\nexpression of like\nyou're a decent human being you're going\nto feel deeply uncomfortable and you're\ngoing to run away from it good feelings\nare scary\nand so the way that we stay stuck after\nour trauma is self-inflicted because we\nfigure out okay this is what I'm worth\nand then anything anyone who tells me\notherwise is confusing or trying to\ntrick me\nand everyone who treats me like crap ah\nyes they treat me like crap I treat me\nlike crap this fits\nit feels right\neven though it hurts\nso what we really self-inflict\nis\nthe propagation of the pattern of trauma\nit's not the trauma itself it's the way\nthat we stay stuck in the cycle\nand this also is not to blame y'all but\nwe have to understand that okay like\neither we have power over it or we don't\nhave power over it if we assume that I\nhave no power over the cycle then I'm\nscrewed\nbecause I'm not I don't get blamed but I\nalso\nI'm fine it's you know\nI don't get blamed but I can't fix it so\nyou have to choose and this is what's\nhard this is why people stay stuck\nbecause if you want to fix your problems\nthen you have to accept responsibility\nfor them\nyou have to accept that you had a hand\nin this especially when it comes to\ntrauma and that's the only way that we\ncan Empower you to change your future\ngood question\nyeah so Matthew white Bay is saying I'm\nnot at fault and I'm responsible to fix\nit absolutely\nso mental illness isn't your fault but\nit is your responsibility\nokay this is a good question\nwhy does it feel good to think about\nSuicidal Thoughts what a great question\nso\nyou know as a disclaimer I think if\ny'all are having suicidal thoughts you\nshould absolutely go get help for them\nokay so go see a professional if y'all\nare really worried about hurting\nyourself really call Emergency Services\nor go to the nearest hospital talk to a\nmedical professional I really do believe\nthat\nbut what we don't understand is that\nSuicidal Thoughts can be very comforting\nright we think about them as bad things\nand from a medical standpoint it's a bad\nthing but let's understand that Suicidal\nThoughts are not\na bug they're a feature like our brains\nhave evolved to have Suicidal Thoughts\nwe even have some cultures in which\nsuicide is like ritual suicide is a part\nof the culture right so in in Japan you\nhave things like sapuku right where\nyou're like committing suicide to regain\nyour family honor and then even in\nIndian culture you had this practice\ncalled Sati\nwhich is when oh\nwhen usually a husband dies and is\nburned on a funeral pyre one or more of\ntheir wives will commit suicide along\nwith them so that they can travel with\nthem to the next life right so we're not\ngoing to talk about the misogyny and\nstuff like that I'm just saying that\nsuicide is a cultural phenomenon okay\nso the question is why so this is where\nwhat's appealing about suicide\nthe first is that it's an out\nright so oftentimes why do people think\nabout suicide they think about suicide\nbecause they're suffering\nand so why is it comforting it's because\nhey\nI can\nquit this cycle of suffering whenever I\nwant\nthat's really what it is right that's a\nhuge part of it\nis like hey I have some amount of\ncontrol\nso I had a patient once who kept a noose\nin their house\nand I we got to the point where they\nwere able to give it up but when they\ntold me this most people will think that\nthankfully mental health professionals\nare pretty good good mental health\nprofessionals in my opinion Would Not\nfreak out right so we want to address\nsafety for sure but I want to talk to\nhim about why do you keep it there what\ndoes it do for you let's understand why\nyou're so attached to keeping this\nnuisance and he's like well I know I've\nalways got\na Lifeline of sorts right that's what it\nreally is\nbecause suicide for some people is not\nan end to life it's an end to suffering\nit's an Escape from all the things that\nare painful that's why it's comforting\nnow I think the reason that you should\nget help and the reason that I don't\nthink you should take that escape is\nfirst of all my personal beliefs are\nthat karmically you just passed the buck\nright so committing suicide in this life\ndoesn't\nfix things\neven from a Buddhist perspective if you\ndon't believe in karma and reincarnation\nwith the Buddhist kind of believe is\nthat\nthe harm\nfrom your suicide will simply distribute\nthe suffering out to other people and\nmaybe even increase it across the whole\nso on a net positive from a human\nperspective it is not a good thing which\nI agree with both of those perspectives\nand the real reason that I think that it\nshouldn't be an escape is because I\nbelieve you can fix your problems in\nthis life\nand I have done it I've helped a ton of\npeople do it right I think this is the\nreal tragedy is that you want the Escape\nwhy do you need to escape why do you\nneed a Lifeboat because the ship is\ngoing down and there's nothing you can\ndo\nthe good news is that if you are\nsuicidal there is a overwhelming\nstatistical chance\nthat the ship is actually not sinking or\neven if it's sinking it can be patched\nup you don't even need a dry dock you\ncan just fix it\nand this is what we know from like\nscientific treatment right\nthat like even if you think that things\nare hopeless getting some help\ncan drastically change the way that your\nShip Sails\nso it's very comforting to have suicidal\nthoughts for sure that's why people have\nthem\nand at the same time just because it's\ncomforting doesn't mean that the premise\nof your situation that okay Escape is\nthe only option or Escape is\nattractive I'm with you it's attractive\nbut there are two ways to escape your\nsituation you can fix it or you can\npeace out\nand that's where people feel like oh\nfixing it feels impossible I'm with you\nit feels impossible that's why you need\nsome help that's why you should go get\nto see a professional that's the real\nthing is seeing a professional allows\nyou to make the impossible possible\nthat's the real value\nwhat if you just don't like living even\nthe happy moments are not sad ones yeah\nso that really sounds consistent with\nsomething that a therapist can help you\nwith\nso if you're not able to enjoy the happy\nmoments in life\nthat's a problem\nbut that's usually me that's usually\nsomething that is more along the lines\nof pathologic right so if we have people\nwho like are anhedonic which is a\nfeature of depression major depressive\ndisorder is the inability to derive\npleasure from things that you normally\nfind pleasurable\nso the good news is like that's\ntreatable\nand then you can like start enjoying\nlife again but it's very common\num okay so many good questions\nuh thoughts on Sadler's view on trauma\nthat it doesn't exist and we make\nthe past the line with goals I mean\nthere may be some truth to that I'm not\nparticularly I think I've read some\nstuff by Sadler but I think there's good\nphysiologic evidence that trauma is real\nlike very good physiologic evidence\nright we have all these studies that\nshow changes to our autonomic nervous\nsystem and stuff like that so I think\nit's absolutely real\nso someone's asking what a professional\nis not an option I know this sounds kind\nof like that's tough right so the first\nthing is that the real sad thing is that\nwe can say you know professional\ntreatment is helpful but a lot of people\nit's not an option\nso I I and that that doesn't change for\nother things right so if I have like\ncancer\nthe right answer is like you should go\nsee a doctor and then people like well\nwhat if I don't have access to a doctor\nand so then I would say the problem that\nyou need to solve is is how do you get\naccess that can be a problem that is\nsolvable absolutely\nright and it just depends on where you\nare and what your circumstances are\nokay\nlet's move on man so many good questions\nare you all having fun is this working\nfor you all we've got about 30 minutes\nleft\num\nokay\nokay\nall right can emotional trauma cause a\nhigher sex drive in order to cope\nso for some this might be an obvious\nquestion but I'm curious I was diagnosed\nwith cptsd recently due to years of\nemotional and verbal abuse and other\nevents that messed up my mental\nstability however I've never dealt with\nsexual trauma at least not that I\nremember and I did notice over the years\nmy sex drive just gets higher when I'm\nextremely stressed or triggered I crave\nintimacy and sexual release I almost\nfeel like a little too much it kind of\nfreaks me out I've heard of people\ndevelop this due to sexual trauma but I\nhaven't got gone through that anyone\nelse\nso\nany form of trauma\ncan result in hypersexuality or\nhyposexuality\nso it's a very common misnomer that if I\nwas sexually abused in some way that\nwill mess with me\nin a sexual way\nbut\nif I wasn't sexually abused it's weird\nright so like\nno so actually\nhypersexuality and hyposexuality both of\nthose can come from any form of trauma\nso let's understand the hypersexuality\nfirst\nso when we get traumatized\nwe start the process of numbness\nemotional numbness and dissociation\nokay when we start to numb and\ndissociate dissociate from ourselves our\nability to manage our emotions becomes\nweaker because we're using the numbness\ncard right so instead of cleaning up a\nmess we're just covering it up so I'm\njust shutting the door on it so I don't\nlearn how to process emotions\nand then what happens\nis when I get stressed or triggered\nthese result in a rise of emotions\nand life eventually numbness doesn't\nwork because they pot the emotions pile\nup and pile up and pile up and\neventually they become overwhelming so\nat some point if you've been traumatized\nsome amount of motion will break through\nthe numbness and now you're in trouble\nbecause the way that you manage emotions\nis by numbing them\nyou haven't learned how to deal with\nthem in other ways so now you need some\nother way\nto take those emotions away this is why\npeople with a history of trauma are more\nlikely to have addictions right because\nthat's one way to do it and the other\nreally cool thing is that you can have\nsex\nright so what does sex do sex leads to a\nrush of oxytocin which makes you feel\ngood\nleads to dopaminergic release which\nmakes you feel good\nsex also shuts off the negative\nemotional circuitry of the brain\nso that feels good so sex becomes an\nemotional regulation technique\nthere's another interesting thing about\nsex\nwhich is that compared to other drugs it\nengages another physiologic mechanism\nthat helps us calm down if we've been in\nhave a history of trauma\nso anytime our hype a sympathetic\nnervous system our stress system gets\nactivated like let's say I'm feeling\nsuper stressed\nthere is a really interesting way to\nshut down that stress system which is\nactually extreme physical activity\nso anytime I do extreme physical\nactivity\nas my heart rate shoots up\nmy body starts to prepare itself to cool\ndown\nright so if you kind of think about like\nif I like Sprint for 60 seconds my body\nis like okay we're Full Speed Ahead but\nas soon as we're done full speeding\nahead we need to sit down and breathe\nright so you run for 60 seconds and you\nget on your knees and you're like\nso your body automatically triggers a\nrelaxing response when you hyper\nactivate your stress system from\nphysical exercise\nso when you get mentally stressed we get\na hyperactivity of our stress system but\nthere's no automatic turning on of our\nrelaxation system\nwhich physical exercise does so when we\nhave sex it's a hyperactive physical\nexperience which then triggers a calming\nresponse right and let's like think\nabout the calming response post not\nclarity now I can think clearly you're\nchilling you're relaxing it helps people\nfall asleep\nsex also releases endogenous endorphins\nwhich kind of chill you out\nso sex does a couple things it\nphysiologically shuts off the triggering\nresponse shuts off the stress and\nregulates her emotions\nthere's a third reason why people get\naddicted to sex\nit's because when we get traumatized\noftentimes we feel lonely\nthe reason we feel lonely is because we\ndo not have a well-developed sense of\nself\nso people who are traumatized feel like\nchameleons they don't really know what\nthey want they hang out with people and\nthey get excited by what their friends\nare getting excited about\nand then oftentimes what happens is when\nI'm by myself the emotions come roaring\nback and I need some kind of distraction\nso let me go hang out with someone else\ndepending on what kind of trauma you've\ngone through if it's like even emotional\nabuse\nright you can have a messed up\nattachment Style\nso you crave the affection and attention\nof others if someone else loves you then\nyou feel loved because if you've been\ntraumatized you don't know how to love\nyourself\nand going through life without love\nfeels awful\nand so what's way that one way that I\ncan make people love me and what's one\nway that I can feel loved\nI can have sex with them\nright because then I oxytocin gets\nreleased I bond with this person I feel\nloved they're accepting me they came\nover they're now here with me they value\nme there's something I can offer them to\nmake this person love me\nthis is the third reason why people get\naddicted to sex or it can be hypersexual\nso there's an emotional eye a regulation\nstandpoint\nthere's a physiologic standpoint there's\nan identity attachment and relationship\nstandpoint\nnow let's talk about hyposexuality\nbecause trauma can cause hyposexuality\nas well\nso one way that trauma causes\nhyposexuality is that it does lead to\nnumbness\nand if we sort of think about sexuality\nsexuality is oftentimes emotional right\nand it's not just love we're talking\nabout like\nyou know like let's go\nthere's emotion there I'm not even sure\nwhat it conveys but there's some emotion\nthere like flirtation\nyou know mystery\na sense of Conquest a challenge love\nthere's all kinds of emotions that\nenter into the sexual relationship and\nif we've been numbed by trauma we don't\nhave access to those right so then it\ncould like even if we have sex like\nsex can feel good but all of that\nplayfulness is hard to access the\nflirtation is hard to access\nyou know all that stuff can be hard\nthe second thing is that especially in\nsome cases of of trauma so definitely\ntrue of sexual abuse could but can also\nbe true of physical abuse or even\nemotional abuse\nis that we our body can learn that in\nthe case of sexual abuse that\nsex is painful and dangerous it doesn't\nactually feel good it is it hurts us\nright so you'll have some cases of\npeople who will have like\nyou know the fear like\nit's hard to be sexually aroused when\nyou're being like hunted by aliens on a\nforeign planet right like the the\nsympathetic nervous response of fear and\nsurvival is like very different and\nshuts down all sexual drive so when\nintimacy vulnerability or sexuality and\ncan be all three it can be something as\nsimple as vulnerability\nbecause when you're sexual with someone\nthere's some amount of vulnerability\nright\nand if you learn because someone was\nemotionally or physically abusive that\nyou should never be vulnerable\nnow anytime You're vulnerable you\ntrigger a fear response which shuts down\nyour sexual drive and in some cases I've\nalso seen things like vaginismus or\nother kinds of like you know vaginal\nspasm where like literally it becomes\nphysiologically difficult to have\nintercourse\nbecause\na patient of mine their body learned\nthat like sex hurts me so that can\nresult in hyposexuality as well so it's\nsome amount of numbness that leads to a\nlack of the emotions that lead to\nsexuality\nit can be a physiologic response just\nfrom trauma from things like sexual\nabuse and it can even be something a\nlittle bit more abstract like I don't\nlike to be vulnerable\nand then sexuality comes with some\ndegree of vulnerability\nand especially if you're one of these\npeople that for you sexuality requires\nan emotional connection then you're like\ndoubly screwed so trauma can absolutely\nlead to hypersexuality and hyposexuality\nand there are a lot of mechanisms at\nPlay\nquestions\nokay you've helped me a lot with\nconnecting with people I kind of lost\nthat totally before I found you thanks\nfor helping my life man you're very\nwelcome\nhow do you build a sense of self after\ntrauma okay\nso we're going to cover this in detail\nin the workshop okay\num but I'll do my best to answer\nso\nif you've been traumatized and you don't\nhave a good sense of self\nlet's talk about how you can actually\nrebuild that sense of self\nso the first thing is that part of the\nreason that we don't have a good sense\nof self\nis that oh no\nso let's start with understanding the\nproblem a little bit\nwhen we do not develop a good sense of\nself we're kind of like empty on the\ninside and we kind of become chameleons\nand then what happens is we start\ninternalizing\nthe senses of self that other people\ngive us\nso if someone treats me well and loves\nme then I feel good about myself but if\nsomeone doesn't respond to my texts then\nI feel like a waste of a human being\nso the way that I feel about myself\nis shaped by the actions of others\nso history of trauma can lead to\nsomething like borderline personality\ndisorder\ncan also lead to things like narcissism\nor sociopathy\nwhere in the case of narcissism it's\nlike I want everyone to love me and then\nI'll feel good about myself but if\nanyone points out my insecurities I'm\ngoing to get really angry at them I'm\ngoing to teach them a lesson\nand all of these things share one\nproblem which is a lack of a cohesive\nsense of self\nso where does the sense of self come\nfrom\nhow do you know who you are\nsense of self comes from an integration\nof experiences and the development of a\nnarrative these two things\nso the first thing is when I think about\nwho I am\nhow do I discover who I am\nso I'll give you all an example for a\nlittle while I was in a military school\nand I had gone to put my life together\nand I was afraid of heights\nand so like I was terrified but like by\nthe end of my time there I could climb\nyou know a 30-foot rope\nand like ring a bell at the top\nand so even though there's a lot of\nnegative emotions that go into that so\nmy sense of self is I'm afraid of\nheights this is really scary I can't do\nit followed by progress followed by a\nsense of Triumph where there's still the\nphysiologic fear of heights\nso if we think about that's an identity\nforming\nexperience for me an identity forming\nexperiences require emotion\nnumber one thing so if you think about\nwhen did you discover who you are and if\nyou watch like an anime when does\nsomeone discover who they are it's when\nthey're emotionally tested\nso emotions and identity are come hand\nin hand\nand if you kind of think about what\ndetermines your identity it's not the\ndrab experiences yeah I took out the\ntrash yesterday that\nmakes me feel like who I am no it's the\nemotions that those are the experiences\nyou remember and those are the\nexperiences that form you being bullied\non the playground I'm a loser emotional\nenergy even taking out the trash\npatients who've been depressed for 60\ndays haven't taken out the trash in two\nmonths\ntaking out the trash is a formative\nexperience for my identity I put my life\ntogether because that what's the\ndifference taking out the trash in two\ncases is the same the only difference is\nthe emotional engagement\nso when we get traumatized we become\nnumb\nour brain suppresses our emotions we\nstart to dissociate when we dissociate\nwe lose the capacity to form identity\nliterally right you dissociate you\nseparate from yourself\nso you have to stop dissociating\nstart recognizing your emotions start\nfeeling your emotions because that's\nwhat's going to give you the character\nof the self\nthe second thing that forms our identity\nis narrative\nso when we put when we tell a story\nabout ourselves\nso we we kind of say I was a loser and\nnow I'm a good person I used to be\noverweight and now I'm in shape I used\nto eat like crap and now I'm healthy\nthere's a sense of narrative there's the\nstory of your life\nand oftentimes if we think about what\nare the what are the pieces what are the\nchapters of the story of your life\nthey're the emotional ones\nright I woke up for the 422nd day and\nplayed Diablo again\nand then I woke up on the 423rd day and\nI played Diablo again that's not The\nNarrative of your life The Narrative of\nyour life is I wasted two years of my\nlife playing Diablo it emotionally hurts\nso you have to have narrative\nwhere did you come from where are you\ngoing\nand we know from tons of research on\ntrauma that\nhealing from trauma involves making\nnarrative from it\nso there are even people who will say I\ndon't regret being sexually abused\nand as you talk to them about what\nhappened well I was sexually abused and\nit really ruined a part of my life but\nthen I went through therapy I got healed\nand now I support other sexual abuse\nsurvivors\nI'm a peer counselor\nthis is an example of someone forming\nnarrative from their life and they look\nat their past and they say this sucked\nbut now it has made me who I am\nand this is also the concept of uh\nthere's something really\nlet me see if I can find it\nokay so I don't know if you guys are\nfamiliar with the concept of kinsugi\nso this is super cool\nso the Japanese have a really good\nway of kind of talking about this\nso oh sorry\nso if you want to understand narrative\nlook at something called kinsugi\nwhich is\nthe art of repairing broken pottery\nand\nthere's sort of this idea that something\nis something that gets repaired is\nactually more beautiful than something\nthat was never broken in the first place\nand they turn it into a whole art form\nof like you know putting things together\nand there's even like scientific uh\nstudies or or papers about this concept\nand really thinking about that is how to\nhow to help people with trauma\nthat when you put the pieces of yourself\nback together that's when you will\ndiscover Who You Are\nso I know it sounds kind of weird but\nthe answer is really first of all that\nyou being broken is part of your\nidentity\nbut it's only one piece of who you are\nright it's like a broken it's like a\npiece of pottery a cup that's shattered\ninto three pieces and one part of your\nidentity is being broken\nand that'll lead to a crappy life if\nthat's the only piece of pottery that\nyou have but you can build that into a\ncomplete sense of self once you combine\nthe other pieces and that's really\nwhat's missing in narrative\nright what's really missing in your\nidentity is is that you are just broken\nyou don't have the other things involved\nyou don't have that you're a survivor\nyou don't have that you're resilient you\ndon't have that this is part of your\njourney and you've made yourself whole\nagain\nand so that identity really comes from\nnarrative\nso one last example I'll share with you\nall is I talk about karma karma a lot\nwith my patients\nif they're interested in it right so\nI'll say to them look I have this\nbackground I studied for seven years to\nbecome a monk I found this perspective\nis useful for some of my patients would\nyou like to explore it with me\nand then I'll ask them you know I'll\nshare with them that this is a concept\nthat comes from Hindu and Buddhist\nreligions I'm not trying to be religious\nhere but I think it's a useful concept\nand one interesting thing about the\naspect of karma is that\nthis is all part of your life\nand that these things happen to you for\na reason it's not that you deserved it\nor didn't deserve it it's that it\nhappened and how can we make sense of it\nhow can we understand this so I'll give\nyou all just an example from my own life\nso I graduated from college with a 2.5\nGPA\nand there is no scenario in which I\nthought a 2.5 GPA is better than a 4.0\nbut then I ended up going to med school\ntrained at Harvard for a Psychiatry was\nfaculty there and then suddenly\nsomething weird happened\nbecause I was surrounded by kids who had\n4.0 when I started streaming on Twitch\nand when I started like doing media\ninterviews and stuff like that what\npeople were interested in was I'm the\nkid with a 2.5 who wound up at Harvard\nif I had been a 4.0 no one would have\ncared just like everybody else and\nbelieve me that's that's who I was\nsurrounded by I was surrounded by people\nwho were like really really solid in a\nlot of ways\nin some ways I felt like I didn't belong\nbut I did\nand so even then you sort of think to\nyourself well is there any scenario yeah\nI mean so like you can't have a\nRedemption Arc without being broken\nand Redemption Arc is really what makes\nyou who you are\nand so instead of focusing on how broken\nyou are and how you got this way start\nto really think about okay what's one\nway that I can add another piece back\nwhat's one thing that I can work on as\nyou start adding those pieces back as\nyou start becoming emotionally aware and\nacknowledging your emotional experiences\nyour identity will start to heal\ngreat question\nerror IQ not found\ngood name 2.5 is low you are correct\nit's not above average\nFYI at least not in the US I think the\naverage GPA like in college is like a\n3.0 or 3.1 or 3.2 is my guess\nyeah so\num\nyeah can you talk about the relationship\nbetween Weed addiction and porn\naddiction\nand the possible feedback loop yeah\nso weed addiction and porn addiction are\na match made in hell\nbecause one addiction solves the\nproblems created by the other addiction\nso for example if I'm addicted to\npornography over time\nthe enjoyment from pornography goes away\nbecause what we know about pornography\naddiction is that it's like more about\nemotional regulation than it actually is\nabout sexual pleasure it's a switch that\nyou can flip in your brain to make\nyourself kind of just feel better right\nand make the negative emotions go away\nand then\nwhen you're addicted to porn for a while\nit stops becoming fun\nuntil you get high\nand then colors are more Vivid\norgasms are more intense\nand so marijuana addiction solves the\nproblems of porn addiction\nnow the interesting thing is that it\ngoes both ways so when I start using pot\na lot I start to have difficulty with\nmotivation\nmy life like starts to kind of blur\ntogether\nwhen I'm not high the way that I'm\nscrewing up my life or other kinds of\nemotions and stuff start showing up\nand then like it causes me problems\nand so when I'm feeling bad about my\nlife because maybe I'm a pothead I can\nuse porn to make those feelings go away\nso the two really go hand in hand in a\nlot of ways\nright\nmarijuana can also increase like sexual\ndesire and stuff like that so they\nreally just they're a match made in hell\nto be honest\nyeah so someone's saying I'm sad when\nI'm not high and then like porn takes\nthe sadness away right so as you watch\npornography it suppresses your emotional\ncircuitry\nas you orgasm which sometimes happens\nwhen people are addicted to pornography\nthat's not a meme by the way I mean like\nliterally sometimes people who are\naddicted to pornography will watch\npornography without masturbating or\nachieving orgasm\nyou know but when you do that you get a\nlittle bit of dopamine and you get some\nrelaxation and you're kind of chilling\nand it feels good and the sadness kind\nof goes away\nokay\ncool let me see if we've got time for\none more\num\nokay so just to remind you all we are we\ndo have a new thing that we're doing\nI am running my first Workshop\nfor y'all\nand I'm doing it at the end of the month\nand it's all about trauma so we're going\nto be covering more detail and really\nmore of like what to do to fix some of\nthese problems so how can you get\nreconnected with your emotions how can\nyou develop a sense of identity how can\nyou develop a narrative what are\nexercises you can do how can you rewire\na physiology we're going to be covering\nall that stuff in more detail and really\nbeing more like Solutions focused so the\nworkshop is about eight hours four hours\non Saturday four hours on Sunday taught\nlive\nwith time for things like q a and stuff\nlike that\nand what I've tried to do is distill\nbasically what I offer people that I'm\nworking with who are struggling with\nthis so how do you put together your\nlife after trauma it's not a substitute\nfor clinical treatment like PTSD\ntreatment or anything like that it's\nactually all the other stuff so when I\nwhen I'm doing PTSD treatment when I'm\ndone with a patient\nthen we start to really think about okay\nhow is how is trauma affecting your\nrelationships\nhow is it affecting your physiology how\ncan we start to work on those kinds of\nthings\nso it's kind of like a brain dump of all\nof the problems that all right what I\nthink are the six most important\nproblems caused by trauma and how to fix\nthem which is emo dissociation and\nemotional numbness\nphysiologic rewiring\nsense of identity\nuh problems with motivation and\ninability to see the future so this is\nanother really big one where when we're\nwhen we get traumatized oftentimes\nthere's no point in planning for the\nfuture because the nature of trauma is\nthat we lack control over our life if\nyou lack control over your life there's\nno point in thinking about the future\nand then once you leave the traumatic\nsituation let's say you leave the house\nthe problem is that your brain doesn't\nknow how to think about the future now\nbecause it never learned because it\ndidn't need to because the future didn't\nmatter it's just about survival today\nso how can we train our brain to start\nthinking about the future and start\nmoving towards goals that's another big\npart then covering identity narrative\nand even some degree of spirituality\nheal my life organize me sir we are\nworking on it we have another thing that\nwe're also working on which by the way\nhopefully the the trauma Workshop will\nfund\nso the other challenge that we Face by\nthe way and thank you to everyone who's\ndonating and stuff is that\nin order to build stuff like sometimes\nbuilding stuff is expensive\nand uh\nyou know\nwe've done everything that we can with\nthe stuff that you all have offered but\nwe're actually really hoping to\ngenerate some capital from this Workshop\nso that we can actually build things\nthat are more accessible so I was asking\npeople recently\nyou know we have some ideas around an\napp that's kind of around skills\nbuilding and structure\nand the majority of people were like I\nwant to use it but I don't want to pay\nfor it or I can't afford it which means\nthat the money has to come from\nsomewhere else so we're working on that\ntoo\num\nexclamation point trauma should work\nyeah\nand the the workshop is going to be live\nokay\nand we can't raid people on YouTube\nright\nokay so the I'm gonna host it live from\n12 to 4 pm CT on September 30th and\nOctober 1st okay\nso definitely check it out and thank you\nto all of the\num thank you for all the financial\nsupport y'all we really appreciate it\num okay\nall right let's see\nuh\nhow do I I don't know how to\nI don't know how to raid someone on\nYouTube\nis there some way to do it\ntired of restless oh my God\nYouTube is showing me an ad\nokay I don't know how to raid\nthis is terrible\nis there raid functionality\nlive redirect\nokay let me see if I can figure out how\nto do that\num\num okay\nthere's nothing more more ads\nI don't know how to okay I can't figure\nout how to do this\nall right\num\nokay the person has to pre-approve okay\nso then like who where do you all want\nto go\nhmm\nwe can just go organically\nwho's streaming right now\nthat you all want to see\nlet's go to YouTube live\nspam Lincoln comments okay\nwhy\nI haven't enough people seeing yeah so\ndefinitely check it out we're doing a\nworkshop we're trying this right so I've\nbeen streaming for four years we always\ndo this like on YouTube and stuff but I\nthink that\nto really get into more of the solutions\nand like how to fix some of this stuff\nwe need I need like more y'all's time\nand then we also need to make sure that\npeople we can like regulate the\nquestions that are asked in the sense of\nso that people can you know worked on a\nparticular topic that people ask about\nthat particular topic which I love that\nyou guys ask all kinds of random\nquestions it's fun it's it's part of\nwhat makes it fun okay why don't y'all\nraid Destiny just go hang out with\nDestiny for a little while\num and take care y'all have a good day\nit's great to see you all on Friday\nwe're streaming with Dr Mark Horowitz\nwho's an expert on depression serotonin\npharmacology so"
