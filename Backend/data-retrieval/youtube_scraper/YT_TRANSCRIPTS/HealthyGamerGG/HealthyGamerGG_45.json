    "transcript": "a lot of times people who want an easy\nlife lack confidence in themselves so a\nlot of people will ask me Dr K how do I\nboost my confidence and the way to boost\nyour confidence is not through success\nit's through difficulty so there's this\nreally great story about a young girl\nnamed sumati who is a disciple of the\nBuddha one day she goes up to the Buddha\nand she asks him how does someone become\nhappy and the Buddha gives her 10 tenets\nto become happy and this is one of the\nthings that he says when working you\nwish to do what is hard when living with\nothers you wish to live with those who\nare difficult if a task is difficult do\nit without hesitation doing so shows\nwhat we are capable of undertaking see\nwe don't know what we're capable of as\nlong as we're living easy lives and so\nif we don't know what we're capable of\nwe will be filled with self-doubt\nconfidence comes from understanding and\nbelieving in yourself but how can you\nunderstand who you are"
