    "transcript": "this is a core tenant by the way of\nstoicism in Sanskrit that's called\nvairagya to detach from your life right\nto recognize that you as a human being\nare independent of all that crap out\nthere because the moment that your\nemotions and your worth gets tied into\nit you surrender the control of like\nyour effort and your ability to like set\nlimits on things then what happens is\nyou end up burning out right because now\nyou're like devoting a hundred percent\neffort for like a promotion that comes\nwith a 10 raise and then you don't get\nit and now you're like well screw it why\ndid I do all that crap anyway and then\nyou feel bad about yourself and then you\nvow to yourself that you should quit and\nnever again and now I'm going to join\nthe anti-work movement and then you\nbecome resentful but even that is the\nsame problem because you are still\nletting your resentment dictate your\nactions as long as your emotions are\ndictating your actions you're in big\ntrouble"
