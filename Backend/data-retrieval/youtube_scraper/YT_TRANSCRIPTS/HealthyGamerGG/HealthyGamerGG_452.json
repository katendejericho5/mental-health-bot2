    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nuse emotion to cultivate discipline\nbecause when it comes to discipline we\nall know we need it but we don't really\nknow how to get more of it I remember\nwhen I was growing up my mom would\nalways get on my case for being\nundisciplined you're always going to\nsleep too late you are waking up too\nlate you're not doing your things on\ntime or like you need more discipline\nand I was like all right I hear you I\nsort of get that I should be waking up\nevery day on time I should be eating\nhealthy exercising studying all that\ngood stuff I'm game how do I become more\ndisciplined and then she's like well you\nneed to wake up every day at the same\ntime then you will be disciplined and I\ngot kind of confused because I was like\nwait a second don't I need discipline\nfirst to wake up every day at the same\ntime if you're ready to take the next\nstep on your mental health Journey check\nout Dr K's guide it's an immersive\nresource that distills over 20 years of\nmy experience laid out in a way that is\ntailored to your needs so if you're\nready to better understand your mind and\ntake control of it check out the link in\nthe description below and so if we sort\nof think about discipline part of the\nreason it's so hard to cultivate is\nbecause we do don't really understand\nwhat it is we think of discipline as the\nexertion of willpower but you can exert\nwillpower for a day or maybe two but\nover time at some point you're going to\nstart failing right you can wake up\nevery day or you can wake up at 7 A.M\nthe first day the second day the third\nday you can make a New Year's resolution\nwhere you're like I'm gonna eat healthy\nand you exert willpower for a time and\neventually willpower runs out and this\nis why everyone's so focused on habits\nright because okay if you can build a\nhabit it's all about building habits\nthen I don't need willpower but a habit\nis about automatic Behavior it's about\nsort of being reflexive but what about\ndiscipline what about these people who\nare like focused over time and can\ncultivate this discipline and it turns\nout the reason it's so hard to cultivate\nis because we don't understand what it\nis discipline is actually an emotion now\nthat may sound really confusing because\nwe don't think about discipline as an\nemotion but this is something that I\nsort of figured out when I was working\nas an addiction psychiatrist I was\nworking with all these people who were\naddicted to substances stuff like heroin\nand Cohen pain and adderall and alcohol\nmarijuana and I really was trying to\nfigure out like okay how do we help this\nperson how can I help this person\novercome this addiction and we sort of\nteach meditation right we teach\nmindfulness we teach them how to sort of\nincrease their willpower and resist\nimpulses but I got kind of fundamentally\nconfused because what an addict needs is\ndiscipline but if you look at the\nscience of psychotherapy what are we\ntalking about with addicts all the time\nwe're not sending them to boot camp to\nsort of train really hard and become\ndisciplined we're talking to them about\ntheir feelings so how does that work how\nis it that because if you think about\novercoming an addiction someone needs a\nlot of discipline to overcome an\naddiction and yet at the same time when\nwe sort of think a little bit about okay\nhow do you help someone become sober\nyou're doing emotional work and the\nanswer is actually pretty surprising\nthat common Neuroscience has actually\nled us astray and we don't really\nunderstand what emotion is so what's\nhappened in Neuroscience is we've\nfigured out that there are emotional\nstructures in the brain and it's kind of\ncommon knowledge now that if you look at\nthings like the amygdala and limbic\nsystem you have these centers of the\nbrain these anatomical structures where\nemotion exists like fear and anxiety and\nthings like that we have all these brain\nscans that show that these are the\nemotional centers of the brain but this\nis actually a huge misconception so we\nhave a anxiety Center and that's\nabsolutely in the amygdala we have a\nfear Center and that's absolutely in the\namygdala but what about the positive\nemotions where is the humor center of\nthe brain where is the joy center of the\nbrain where is the love center of the\nbrain and this is where we really have\nto get out into the specifics of the\nNeuroscience but we've actually all been\nLED astray because negative emotions are\nlocalized to anatomical structures but\nas we move into the positive emotions\npeople are kind of confused about where\nthey are right you can go to a\npsychotherapist and they can teach you\nhow to be less anxious we're really good\nat working on that but can you go to a\npsychotherapist to be more funny can you\ngo to a psychotherapist to actually\nlearn Joy and that's not where we\nactually go right and where are the\nTraditions that we sort of find this\nknowledge it's actually in yoga and\nmeditation in places like Zen Buddhism\nso if you look at sort of the what Zen\nBuddhists are really good at they're\nreally great at understanding humor they\nactually use humor as a path to\nEnlightenment and I'd love to share with\nyou all a story that kind of exemplifies\nthis so when I was studying in the\nashram I had a teacher who sort of told\nme the story that was brilliant so there\nwas a master\nwho's teaching people to meditate and he\nhad a lot of disciples so they would\nwake up every morning at 4 30 in the\nmorning and they'd go to the meditation\nHall to meditate the problem is as the\nmonks were sitting there trying to\nmeditate there was a cat that lived in\nthe ashram or the monastery and the cat\nwould get pretty excited because now\neveryone's awake and everyone's kind of\nsitting down and trying to meditate and\nthe cat starts messing with people right\nit gets excited it starts walking on one\nmonk starts walking on another Monk just\ninterferes with their meditation and so\nthe master looks at this and realizes\nokay this cat is interfering with\neveryone's meditation so he tells his\nhis disciples he says okay when the cat\nshows up the first thing we need to do\nis put a bucket on top of the cat for\nlike 45 minutes while we meditate then\nwe're gonna lift the bucket and then the\ncat can do whatever it wants so the the\nmonks start doing this the disciples\nstart doing this but they put a cat\nunder the bucket and then everyone's\nable to meditate so over time the master\nteaches this lesson and says okay before\nwe start to meditate the most important\nthing to do is to put the bucket on the\ncat and everyone's like okay Master we\ngot it and if anyone screwed up and\nforgot to put the bucket on the cat the\ncat would interfere with everyone's\nmeditation so the master taught this\nprinciple to one disciple after another\nafter another make sure before you start\nto meditate you put a bucket on the cat\nso then the master dies and everyone's\nlike okay that's you know that's okay\nwe're gonna mourn the master but the\nmaster taught all this stuff so we're\ngoing to continue doing it and so they\ncontinue to get up every day they\ncontinue to put the bucket on the cat\nand then one day something weird happens\na couple years later the cat dies and\nnow suddenly all the monks are in a\npanic they're like what do we do what do\nwe do what do we do there's no there's\nno we can't put the bucket on the cat\nand the master taught us the first thing\nyou should do anytime you meditate is\nput the bucket on the cat what do we do\nand someone else is like I know let's go\nfind a new cat and that's exactly what\nthey did\nso this is what I love about the\ntradition of meditation when it comes to\nsort of the cultivation of positive\nemotions how do we find joy how do we\nfind humor this is where the yogis and\nZen Masters really figured something out\nand when I was struggling as an\naddiction psychiatrist to try to figure\nout how can I help my patients be more\ndisciplined I actually went to an\nancient yogic text it's one of the\nupanishads that sort of blew my mind as\nI tried to understand where in the mind\ndiscipline comes from so I'm going to\nshare with that with you all now\nso let's start with one basic\nobservation that the yogis made the\nfirst observation that they made is that\nopposites are in the same category right\nso we can say that red and blue let's\nsay are opposite colors but they're both\ncolors hot and cold are both within the\nsame category of temperature heavy and\nlight are in the same category of weight\nand so then that when they looked at\ndiscipline they tried to figure out okay\nwhat is it that causes a lack of\ndiscipline and what they concluded is\nthat doubt or a wavering mind is the\nopposite of discipline and so they kind\nof looked at people and they said okay\nwhat is it why is it that someone stops\nbeing disciplined well what they doubt\nright so if I think about a marriage\nwhere I'm starting to like be\nuncommitted to my partner I'm not\ndisciplined in terms of the marriage\nwhat's at the root of that it's doubt I\ndon't know if this person is right for\nme I know that maybe like I felt this\nand maybe you'll feel this too where if\nyou sort of think about what causes what\nkeeps you from being disciplined with\nstudies right so if you're if you kind\nof think about it like maybe you chose\nto major in like engineering or some\nsome stem field and you want to be super\ndisciplined about it but you're not\nreally sure that you like it you're not\nreally sure if it's right for you so you\nwake up every day and you try really\nhard and you kind of end up getting B's\nand A's and maybe an occasional C but\nyou just don't have that fire or that\ndiscipline to really work the way that\nyou need to and why is that it's because\nin the back your mind you're not sure\nyou're not sure that this is what you\nwant to do you're not sure that this is\nthe right thing and so the doubt gets in\nthe way of discipline the next thing\nthat the yogi sort of discovered is that\nokay if doubt gets in the way of\ndiscipline what is the opposite of doubt\nand they used a slightly different word\nI this is all in Sanskrit but they\ntranslated that not as disciplined but\nas resolve so what is the opposite of\nDoubt well the opposite is resolve and\nas I started to look at that I kind of\nstumbled into this thing that really\nhelped me help my patients a lot which\nis that I don't need to cultivate\ndiscipline what I really need to do is\ncultivate resolve because when someone\nis resolved internally\nthen what they end up behaving like is\ndisciplined right so when I wake up\nlet's say on New Year's Day and I have a\nNew Year's resolution and it's even\nbaked into the language what is that New\nYear's resolution it is a resolve the\nproblem is that we are never taught how\nto cultivate resolve right we make them\nall the time but then we don't keep it\ngoing and that too is consistent with\nemotion because if we look at which\nparts of our body change or which parts\nof our brain change habits are pretty\nfixed our willpower even as sort of a\nbattery that has a certain amount of\nenergy in it but what is it that\nfluctuates on a day-to-day basis in the\nmind the most it is actually emotions if\nyou're angry today you won't necessarily\nbe angry tomorrow Falling in Love Today\ndoesn't necessarily mean that you're\ngoing to be in love 10 years from now so\nwhat resolve really is is actually an\nemotion and if you've been resolved at\nsome point in your life you know what I\nmean when you kind of think about those\nmoments where you get resolved right\nyou're like I'm gonna pass this class or\nI'm going to be at the top in my class\nor I'm gonna get a 4.0 or I'm done with\nthis person I am never texting this\nperson again I'm never playing another\ngame of League of Legends or I'm never\nplaying another game of DOTA I'm done\nwith video games what is that right\nthat's a resolve It's actually an\nemotional kind of thing and this is\nwhat's really interesting is once I sort\nof stumbled on this through yoga I\nstarted to wonder well hold on a second\nis resolve actually an emotion and I\nwent back to actually more recent and\nsophisticated Neuroscience where it's\nkind of shocking but if we sort of look\nat this together\nwe look at this table what we'll see is\ncore and extended emotional brain\ncircuitry components and if you all are\namateur neuroscientists you know that\nthe amygdala in the limbic system or\nwhere we sort of think about where\nemotions exist but if you look at all\nthis this is complicated right this is\nparts of our frontal lobes this is Parts\nlike our anterior cingulate cortex and\nif we look at these emotional circuits\nin the brain what you sort of discover\nis that a lot of positive emotion\nactually comes from circuits not\nanatomical structures so this is where\nwe have to get a little bit technical\nbut one of the things that we a lot of\npeople kind of don't get is that\nfunctions in the brain can come from two\nplaces they can sometimes come from an\nanatomical structure like an amygdala\nthat is kind of like surrounded it's a\nchunk of tissue that emotion comes from\nbut the other place that's that that\nlike stuff can come from in the brain\nisn't a structure it's actually a\ncircuit it's a series of connections\nfrom different parts of the brain and\nthe really interesting thing is that\npositive emotions come from circuits so\nif we look at something like love there\nis not a love Center in the brain there\nis not a part of the brain where if you\nget a stroke or you get some kind of\nproblem you will never be able to love\nagain I mean there may be multiple areas\nthat you can get strokes that will sort\nof interfere with love but there are\nsome of these more positive emotions\nthat come from the harmony or the the\ncommunication between different parts of\nthe brain and resolve is absolutely one\nof those things so if we look at the\nbrain of someone who is resolved there's\nstuff going on in the frontal lobes\nthere's going on in the limbic system\nthere's stuff going on in places like\nthe anterior cingulate cortex and so\nthis is where Neuroscience kind of falls\nshort because we're not really good at\nsort of activating those circuits and if\nyou want to cultivate discipline what\nyou actually need to do is not cultivate\nwillpower that's a different function in\nthe brain not cultivate habit but\nactually cultivate resolve on a daily\nbasis and the cool thing is just like\nthe Zen Masters figured out where the\nnature of humor is and they sort of tell\nall these hilarious stories they were\nthe original comedians\nwe can actually turn to yoga to teach us\nhow to cultivate resolve so the first\nthing that I'm going to tell you all to\ndo is notice when you feel resolved\nright so the next time that you feel\nresolved just take a snapshot of it\nclose your eyes and try to sort of\nnotice what is the experience of resolve\nand what you'll discover is that resolve\nfuels your willpower right when you get\nresolved in something and then you start\nto do it the doubts and other kind of\nideas and distractions will pop into\nyour head but there's this like there's\nthis thermonuclear engine within you\nthat is fueling that willpower so you're\nable to say no no no I'm resolved no\ngames today no distractions today I'm\nfocused I'm resolved it's actually\nemotional so the first step is to\nactually notice what it is the second\nthing that we're going to talk about is\nsomething called a sankalpa which is\nsomething that literally translates to\nresolve but what Yogi's actually figured\nout is that there is a practice to\ndevelop a sankarpa and we're going to\ntalk about that now\nso what I I strongly recommend that\ny'all do is pick one thing that you want\nto be resolved towards and there are\nkind of two versions that we're going to\ndo one is sort of a very specific thing\nand one is kind of a broad thing so you\ncan pick any kind of resolve so I for\nexample gave up ice cream for a decade\nand this was part of my yogic practice\nthat my teacher was teaching me how to\ndevelop resolve so I didn't pick\nsomething that was hard I picked\nsomething that was like relatively easy\nit was like kind of like medium\ndifficulty because you don't want to if\nsomeone's learning how to swim you don't\nwant to dump them in the ocean you want\nto start them in the kiddie pool so the\nfirst mistake that we oftentimes make\nwhen sort of trying to become\ndisciplined is we pick something that's\nreally really important to us the\nproblem is that the things that are\nreally really important to us usually\nare hard and that's why that's important\nto us right because we haven't been able\nto do it they have a lot of emotional\nenergy so we're not practicing we're\ngoing right up on stage and Performing\nso I gave up ice cream for a period of\nabout 10 years so you can pick one one\nthing that I would say is kind of medium\ndifficulty and ideally every day which I\nknow is going to be hard but what you\ncan hopefully do is every day when you\nwake up somewhere within the first hour\nor hour and a half of your day close\nyour eyes sit down somewhere and just\nthink about that resolve right so try to\nkind of stoke up that fire resolve\nwithin you and okay this is going to be\nthe thing that like you know this is\nwhat I'm focused on I'm going to give up\nice cream that's what I did so I think\nit's fine to pick some kind of food or\nsomething that's not like too hard to\nresist right because we don't want to\nrely on a ton of willpower for our\nsuccess we want to focus on the\nconsistency of the resolve and spend\nabout five to ten minutes in the morning\njust focusing on that resolve and try to\nfeel whatever that internal emotional\nstate is that you kind of took a\nsnapshot of in step one try to feel that\ncoming up again let yourself kind of\nopen yourself to it hard to describe you\nknow it's kind of weird like you just\nhave to practice and you'll figure out\nwhat I mean and sort of start to stoke\nthat resolve okay so like no ice cream\ntoday I can do this I feel good about it\nyou know like this is going to help me\nin my long-term goal so sort of think\nthrough that resolve and just give that\nresolve a calm space in your mind that\nwill cause the resolve to kind of grow\nthe second kind of resolve that you can\ndo is something that's a little bit more\nGlobal and something that's a little bit\nmore emotionally charged so if there is\nsomething that is really important to\nyou in life I would say sit down and\nspend a little bit longer this usually\ntakes 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes\nand think about that resolve so one\nexample of resolve that I've used with a\npatient is I deserve to be whole it's\nnot that I am whole it's not that I will\nbe whole it's that I deserve to be whole\nand it can take some time to try to\nfigure out what's the right resolve for\nyou you know really think about like\nwhat you can resonate with that is\nsomething that you want to move towards\nand resolve that towards yourself\ndevelop that sangulpa and for about 10\nto 20 minutes as many days as you can\nmanage start with just today try to do\ntomorrow try to do the next day\nthink about that resolve and let those\nemotions come up we want to cultivate\nthose emotions kind of like a fire and\nif you practice these three steps the\nfirst is take a snapshot of it the\nsecond is you can start with something\nsmall that is not actually that\nemotionally engaging so that you can\npractice Fanning the flames and the\nthird thing is to pick a resolve that is\nmore important I'd say you can move on\nto step three after about 30 days of\nstep two then you want to start\ncultivating that emotion on a daily\nbasis and the cool thing about that is\nthat as we cultivate literally sit down\nand for 20 minutes cultivate that\npositive emotion through that sungalpa\non a daily basis\nthat emotional energy will carry over\nthrough discipline we don't have fmri\nstudies of people doing sunkulpas and\nmeditative techniques but it is my firm\nbelief that when you do this you will be\nactivating that positive emotional\ncircuitry in every part of your brain\nthe last thing to think a little bit\nabout is what are some of the things\nthat get in the way of this so I made\none really interesting observation\nclinically which is that people who are\nundisciplined are numb and you may have\nsort of noticed this that if you crave\ndiscipline\nyou're emotionally kind of numb right\nlike you really want this thing you\nreally want this thing but every day\nkind of feels like a drab gray kind of\nlike not super high highs not super low\nlows or maybe you're getting completely\noverwhelmed by emotion and if we sort of\nthink about the the connection between\nbeing undisciplined and being numb\nwhat's going on there is if discipline\nis an emotion and we're feeling numb all\nthe time we don't have the capacity to\nreally cultivate or Stoke that positive\nemotion and so even though we use this\nnumbness as a protection against\nnegative emotions because my life isn't\ngoing anywhere I'm screwing up I'm not\ngoing anywhere or I'm just doing average\nI can't really give it my all and I want\nto give it my all and what what do you\ndo with those kind of thoughts and those\nemotions you numb and numb them out you\nnumb them out through technology you\nnumb them out through marijuana you numb\nthem out by just pushing them to the\nsides but the problem is that when we\nnumb our emotions out we numb the\npositive stuff too right so if you kind\nof think about it you can't just numb\nyour negative emotions we can't just\nnumb the anxiety and feel happiness and\njoy and love and excitement all the time\neither we feel everything or we feel\nnothing at all so one of the problems\nwith this technique that sometimes\npeople run into is that they're Alexa\nthymic so we've got a whole video about\nthat and some of these other aspects\nthat relate to the sort of cultivation\nof positive emotion so definitely check\nthose videos out my hope is that at the\nend of this video you will have gained a\nnew understanding on why you cannot be\ndisciplined and the core reason you\ncan't be disciplined is because we don't\nreally understand what it is it's not\nwillpower and it's not habit it's\nactually emotion but common Neuroscience\nin the way that like sophisticated\nNeuroscience gets buried by simple\nNeuroscience gives us this idea that\ndiscipline actually isn't an emotion but\nit absolutely is and once you understand\nthat you have a whole new dimension to\nactually work on cultivating your\ndiscipline\n[Music]\nforeign"
