    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about why\nsmart kids end up lonely and one of the\nmost important lessons I learned as a\npsychiatrist is that the solutions of\ntoday become the problems of\n[Music]\ntomorrow and if you're a smart kid you\nmay sort of understand what I'm talking\nabout because as a smart kid you faced\ncertain problems when you were growing\nup and since you're so smart you came up\nwith solutions that worked really well\nbut despite the fact that you've come up\nwith with lots of successful Solutions\noften times smart kids find themselves\nto be sort of stuck and Incredibly\nlonely so in order to understand this we\nhave to start by understanding how\nidentity develops so when we're young\nkids let's say 5 years old 6 years old 7\nyears old we tend to look at the world\nin a one-dimensional way so if I'm a kid\nlike I like trucks and I like Spider-Man\nor I like wrestling or I like gii Jo's\nor ninjas we tend to be like pretty\nonedimensional right I like ponies and\nso what happens when we're kind of\none-dimensional kids is that we sort of\ndevelop these one-dimensional identities\nso if you look at school right and if\nyou think back to your school days what\nwere the different kids known for there\nwere some kids who were nerds and some\nkids who were jocks and some kids who\nwere like the cool kids some kids who\nwere like the the teachers pets so if\nyou sort of think about the sense of\nidentity early on the sense of identity\nis very very one-dimensional and so\nsince it's one-dimensional what tends to\nhappen is some of us will adopt the\nmantle of being being a smart kid right\nso our parents will tell us hey you're\nso smart our teachers will tell us wow\nyou're so smart the other kids will push\nyou around on the playground because\ndamn it you're so smart so the first\nthing that happens is we that we start\nto develop an identity as a smart kid\nparenting in the digital age is becoming\nincreasingly complicated and we've\nhelped tons of parents and even more of\ntheir kids develop healthy relationships\nwith technology at healthy gamer we\nbelieve that there are three steps that\nwill help solve this problem the first\nis you as a parent need to understand\nhow technology is affecting your child's\nbrain and psychology because it's really\nclear that it's doing something but\nwe're not really taught what it's doing\nto our kids the second is learning how\nto communicate with your children\nbecause even though you're saying all\nthe right stuff it's not really sinking\nin and the third is how to actually\nsuccessfully set limits and set healthy\nboundaries because our experience is\nthat a lot of parents are trying really\nhard but things are moving in the wrong\ndirection so if yall are interested\nplease check out the link in the\ndescription below and one-dimensional\nidentities are actually completely\nnormal for kids the problem is that if\nyour one-dimensional identity is that\nyou're smart that starts to sabotage\nthings later in life in a way that other\none-dimensional identities usually don't\nlike if I love Spider-Man and that's my\nidentity it doesn't really cause me\nproblems necessarily later in life and\nif we want to understand why the\nidentity of being smart causes problems\nwe have to understand what it means to\nbe smart so when someone calls you smart\nor when you call someone else smart or\nyou say oh my God this person is\nbrilliant like hi I'm Dr K I'm so\nbrilliant right everyone thinks I'm so\nsmart why do they think I'm smart like\nwhat have you all seen an IQ test for Dr\nK you have no idea right I could just be\naverage intelligence what we equate with\nsmartness is really effortless success\nand so when you take a child and you say\nwow you are really great at effortless\nsuccess when all the other kids are\nsweating and trying hard You Waltz\nthrough here and because you're so\nbrilliant it's easy for you when\neveryone else needs to study for a test\nyou don't need to study for a test\nbecause you are so brilliant and so this\nchild starts to this adopt this identity\nthat intelligence means effortless\nsuccess and that results in a narrowing\nof possibilities and a narrowing of\nidentity so if the source of my identity\nif I'm a smart kid then I can't do\nanything that requires effort right\nbecause if I do something that requires\neffort that makes makes me feel dumb so\nif I do really well in school but my\nteacher comes to me and says hey you're\nso good at math you should compete on\nyou know for our school in as sort of a\nmathlete and then suddenly like that may\nsound like a good idea right cuz I'm a\nsmart kid and that's what smart kids do\nbut then suddenly if I start competing\nagainst other smart kids I have to start\nputting forth effort and if I start\nputting forth effort I don't feel smart\nanymore no one if I start competing in\nmath competitions no one calls me\nbrilliant anymore I can't Walt and be at\nthe top of my class and so suddenly what\nhappens is that becomes a threat to your\nsense of identity and so what smart kids\nstart to do is they stop doing things\nthat require effort and this is really\nwhen they get screwed because that's a\nsolution that works really well\nimpresses a ton of people when you're\nyoung but as you start to grow older you\nstart to move away from other activities\nso there's sort of a narrowing of your\nlife and this is what I've seen working\nwith tons of smart kids that you're not\nable to do things that other kids are\nable to do is that other kid actually\ndoesn't have the burden of being smart\nso they're sort of allowed to practice\ndo poorly and then eventually get better\nbut as a smart kid that's not an option\nfor you so as this narrowing of identity\nstarts to happen as you start to move\naway or Retreat from things that are\ndifficult and require effort and the\nother problem with that is as you grow\nolder your raw intelligence can no\nlonger like get you to the top of the\nclass right eventually you're going to\nbe learning you know pre-algebra and\nthen algebra and then calculus and then\nlike calculus 2 and then whatever\nAdvanced number Theory crap and then\nlike eventually you've got to start\nworking but the problem as a smart kit\nis that the second you start working you\nstop being smart and this kind of\nbecomes a vicious cycle because the less\nI start doing the more I'm left with the\nidentity of being a smart kid because\nnow I'm not multi-dimensional I'm not\nalso a graceful dancer I'm not also very\ncharismatic right all I am is smart and\nso that if as that becomes all I am it\nbecomes harder and harder to put my\nmyself in places that threatens that so\nthis results in a a very very sharp\nnarrowing of hobbies of exposures and\neventually leads to social isolation\nbecause let's think about it right so if\nI don't end up joining this team and I\ndon't become a athlete and I don't start\ndoing SP Sports what I'm going to sort\nof be left with is like a lack of\nopportunity to like socially engage with\nkids and this is where being smart also\nkind of sabotages kids because as I\nstart to reduce my social activity how\ndo I solve that problem I use it with my\nintelligence so there are studies that\nshow that kids who are pretty smart will\nstart to develop something called\ncognitive empathy and that may sound\nkind of weird because isn't empathy like\nemotional isn't the whole point of\nempathy that you can feel what someone\nelse is feeling but as you reduce your\nsocial activity and your social exposure\nthe empathic circuits of your brain\nstart to shut off they start to become\nRusty and so what a smart kid does is\nthey've got this one awesome tool in\ntheir tool belt which is their\nintelligence and so then they leverage\ntheir intelligence towards social\ninteractions so now social interactions\nbecome puzzles to be solved I'm feeling\nlonely how can I say the perfect thing\nhow can I run through a thousand\ndifferent scenarios to make sure that I\nget invited to this thing or that kids\ndon't make fun of you and so we start to\nreally lean into this intelligence to\nstart to manage social interactions the\nproblem is that that becomes very very\nenergy intensive so you can run a\nthousand different calculations but at\nthe end of the day like if you're\nshutting off half of your brain that's\nused for social interactions there's no\nway that your intelligence will be able\nto like fill in for other parts of your\nbrain the problem with being a smart kid\nis that that actually worked for a while\nright you were so damn smart that you\ndidn't need empathy for the first 13\nyears of your life because you could\ncalculate social interactions and so\nwhen everyone else is sort of relying or\ntheir intelligence doesn't solve the\nwhole problem for them in terms of\nloneliness they have to lean into things\nlike like empathy and their empathic\ncircuits start waking up in the brain\nbut for you you were allowed to keep\nthem dormant because your intelligence\ncould do all of it and what this ends up\nin is sort of social isolation because\ncognitive empathy is not a sustainable\nway to maintain relationships it becomes\ncognitively exhausting right so then you\ndon't even have fun it feels like social\nactivity is a chore and is incredibly\ndraining and then half y all diagnose\nyourselves as introverts because social\nactivity is draining social it isn't\ndraining for introverts anymore than it\nis draining for extroverts which I know\nsounds really bizarre but even\nextroverts feel drained after 3 hours of\nsocial activity what's draining is your\ncognitive load or things like social\nanxiety because every minute that you\nare engaging people socially your mind\nis actually running on overtime so you\nrun yourself ragged so as your social\nskills start to atrophy you start to\nfeel lonely and then what happens is\nyour intelligence kind of comes in and\nyour ego comes in your identity comes in\nand you start to develop something\ncalled Defensive arrogance and you'll\nnotice this on with smart kids on the\ninternet so like if you try to talk to\nyou know anyone on the internet there's\na thousand of there's a,1 140 IQ people\nwho are going absolutely nowhere in life\nwho learned quantum mechanics on their\nown and are like expert philosophers and\nand know more about medicine than the\nexperts and all this kind of stuff and\nthey're happy to engage with you with\narguments on the internet right and so\nwhat this sort of starts to become is\nthis defensive arrogance so as you start\nto feel Lon what do you have left oh I'm\na I'm a quiet genius my intelligence is\nso great that I cannot interact with the\nnormal humans I have difficulty\nconnecting with people because they're\nso dumb so this is that defense of\narrogance and even if you're not that\nbad you'll still sort of notice that\nthere are times in your life where\nyou're you kind of feel very very\nreluctant to engage with other people\nand so as you're as you start to become\nmore lonely this defensive arrogance\ncomes with a a correlating low\nself-esteem so anyone who's defensively\narrogant really doesn't feel confident\nin them in the themselves right and you\nmay have sort of noticed that that as\nyou feel lonely you start to have low\nself-esteem but you've got one bright\npoint left which is your intelligence\neven though every other part of your\nlife you may not be you may be lazy you\nmay be kind of socially isolated you may\nbe lonely but at least you're smart You'\ngot that left and so then what happens\nis we we run into another problem which\nis that we start to use intelligence to\nboost up our ego and self-esteem right\nwe try to use rationality to buffer\nagainst our self-esteem but there's a\nfundamental problem with that which is\nthat intelligence from an evolutionary\nstandpoint is not a defensive tool it is\nnot a self-esteem tool it is a problem\nsolving tool so if you literally look at\nthis the research on IQ why do we even\nhave IQ why are some people on the whole\nactually smarter than other people and\nit's because IQ is a problemsolving tool\nright it's the way that our brain fixes\nproblems on the outside and as smart\nkids start to feel more lonely and as\nthey start to have self-esteem problems\nthey really have one thing left which is\nthat I'm a smart kid the other\ndimensions of my life may be crap I may\nbe lazy I may be socially inept but at\nleast I'm smart so they kind of hang\ntheir hold identity on that hat the\nother problem that happens is that you\nall have actually one Major Tool that's\nreally really good right which is your\nintelligence and so then you start\ntrying to fix your self-esteem with your\nintelligence but the basic problem is\nthat IQ did not develop to address\nself-esteem that's not what it's for IQ\nis a general problemsolving capability\nthat we evolve to fix problems on the\noutside it's not a tool that was\ndesigned to buffer our self-esteem\nwhat's designed to buffer our\nself-esteem is actually emotions right\nso just think about this for a second\nyou can't logic your way to self-esteem\nif you could logic your way to\nself-esteem your 140 IQ ass\nwould have already done it and you would\nbe filled with confidence cuz if anyone\ncan figure out how to logic their way to\nself-esteem it would be you but that's\nnot actually how it works because when\nyou were 6 years old and you scraped\nyour knee and you went to mommy or daddy\nor any sort of adult how did they make\nyou feel better about yourself did they\nsay well logically the injury that you\nhave is a small scrape so it's nothing\nto worry about you have not been damaged\nyou're not going to be disabled there's\nno problem there's no there's no harm\nreally it's a small scrape it'll heal on\nits own so you should be okay that's not\nwhat helps right logic in your way when\nyou're feeling bad doesn't work what\nworks is oh let me see that oh my god\ndid you get a little boo boo oh I'm\nsorry it's not a little boo boo oh my\nGod look at those three scrapes wow does\nthat hurt a lot okay well should we put\nsome ice on that right okay like do you\nneed a hug oh baby let me hug hold you\nlet me hug you right this is what\nactually works so this is another thing\nthat we don't quite understand which is\nthat IQ is an offensive weapon people\nwho are super smart are like Wizards and\nDPS Mages IQ is like flinging fireballs\nand lightning bolts to fix problems on\nthe outside I can take a high IQ kid\ndrop him into my private practice and\nsay hey help me optimize patient flow\nthrough my work room like I I can do\nthat and y'all can solve those problems\nI've literally done that before on the\nflip side when it comes to buffering\nyour self-esteem a wizard is like not\nreally great at casting healing spells\nor defens of magic right that's really\nwhat a healer is for and that's kind of\nthat emotional capability that's kind of\nwhat healers are is they they're really\nbuilt into that that emotional\ncapability and so what starts to happen\nis we start dumping our whole Mana pool\ninstead of solving problems on the\noutside trying to buffer up our\nself-esteem because if our self-esteem\nis en shambles we can't even leave leave\nthe house and this is the core trap that\npeople with high IQ fall into is that\nthey've had sort of emotional stunting\nbecause they've leaned so much on their\ntheir cognitive development they start\nto develop these things like cognitive\nempathy they start to become lonely and\nhave low self-esteem and then they puff\nthemselves up using their logic this is\nwhy I'm still a good person I will logic\nit out but fundamentally that's like a\nwizard dumping their whole Mana bar into\ntrying trying to heal something instead\nof actually using the right kind of\nmagic to actually heal yourself which is\nemotions and so now the question becomes\nokay if we're in this situation what do\nwe do about it so the first thing that\nwe've got to do is abandon our identity\nas a smart kit now this may sound really\nterrifying because it's all I've got\nleft this is the only source of my\nself-esteem but my friend your\nself-esteem is already in the trash\nright if we stop and think about it it\nain't doing a whole lot for you anyway\nso get rid of it and here's the reason\nwhy so the the fundamental problem with\nhaving self-esteem based on your\nintelligence is that it teaches you that\nyour self-esteem has nothing to do with\nyour actions if you really think about\nit being proud of being smart is the\nstupidest thing on the planet to be\nproud of because what did you do to\ndeserve that right did you work hard no\nIQ is primarily dependent on genetics\nand maybe some amount of upbringing and\nwhether you're smoked a ton of pot\nwhen you were in your teenage years\nright that's really all it depends on\nit's something that people are born with\nwhich is why a lot of IQ testing happens\nwith like fouryear olds so the basic\nproblem is that your identity is based\non something that you don't even need to\ntake credit for like you don't deserve\nto take credit for that you didn't do\nanything so now this becomes a huge\nproblem because if your sense of\nidentity is based on things that are\noutside of your control that you don't\nactually do anything to deserve it\nbecomes really hard once you learn that\nokay my identity is based on stuff that\nis out of my control actions have no\nimpact on your self-esteem so when I\nwork with smart kids and I ask them well\ndid you try your best they can't take\nany pride in that what matters is the\nresult right well like it doesn't matter\nif I tried my best if I tried my best\nand I fell short I actually feel worse\nabout myself well hold on a second why\nis that well if I tried my best and I\ndidn't get it that means I'm stupid that\nmeans that I'm not good enough that\nmeans that failure is inevitable so now\nhold on a second let me understand this\nright you're telling me that if you try\nyour best and it doesn't work out you\nview that as a failure instead of a\nsuccess right obviously because it\ndidn't work out but think about what\nthat does for the strategy of your life\nyou're not allowed to try your best\nyou're not allowed to fail and if you\ntry you even have to\nself-sabotage because if you try your\nbest and you fail then you're absolutely\nscrewed but if I half asset then there's\na part of my ego that's like aha the\nreason I didn't get it is because I half\nasked it it's not because I'm stupid and\nso now you develop this strategy of\neither you half asset or you don't try\nat all you developed the strategy where\ntrying your hardest become something to\navoid at all costs and no wonder you're\nstuck no wonder you're lonely because\nyou will not let yourself give 100% And\nthat is the core problem that kids who\nare smart run into the second thing that\nwe need to do is catch that sense of\nidentity in the present when you try to\ndo something so your smart intelligent\nbrain has figured out that okay in order\nto put together my life I need to do\ncertain things but when you try to do\nthose things pay attention to what\nsabotages you what sabotages you is that\ndefensive arrogance oh I can't do that\nbecause I'm not like that I can't do\nthat because other people are like that\nI can't do that because I won't seem\nsmart I'll feel embarrassed to have to\ngo into training where there are noobs\nwho are teaching me how to use\nPowerPoint I know how to use PowerPoint\nI can figure it out on my own I don't\nneed someone to train me I don't need to\nsit in a class for 2 weeks to learn how\nto use PowerPoint I could watch YouTube\nin 2 hours and figure it out using my\nown like building watching tutorials and\nstuff I don't need this but the question\nis do you end up learning how to use\nPowerPoint do you actually do that of\ncourse not you may start to watch one\ntutorial but then you click onto\nsomething else and then you actually\ndon't acquire the skills two weeks go by\nand you should have sat in the class but\nyou can't because it's humiliating and\nso catch that in the moment and go to\nthe class anyway say wow this is me\nsabotaging this is me not wanting to be\nhumiliated by going to the class and so\nthen you have to ask yourself I have a\nchoice I can make progress and feel\nhumiliated or I can feel proud and stay\nstuck and if you're the person that I\nthink you are chances are you've chosen\nthe lad many many many many times over\nanything but be humiliated right I will\nstay stuck on my ass for a long time\nrather than grow as a human being\nbecause I can feel good about myself so\nthat identity has to go the second thing\nthat we've got to do is start working on\nyour emotions so this is where you can\nabsolutely check out out stuff that we\nhave on alexiy and all that kind of\nstuff but I'm going to start super super\nsuper small so generally speaking when\nsmart kids are lonely one of the things\nthat happens with loneliness is that\nit's like okay how do you fix that do\nyou spend time with someone does that is\nthat sufficient to fix loneliness\nbecause you've tried that before and\nthis is where another thing I've noticed\nwith a lot of smart kids who are lonely\nis that there's a lack of physical touch\nin their life and if we sort of look at\nhow human beings feel less alone if we\nlook at activating those emotions human\ntouch is one of the simplest ways in\nwhich we activate our emotions and\nactivate a sense of connection so the\nthe simple thing that you've got to do\nis I know this sounds kind of weird\nengage in human touch now I don't mean\ngo out there and start like touching\npeople like oh Dr K told me that I need\nto engage in human touch and so you go\nand you just like touch someone don't do\nthat right so what I would say is very\nsimply offer someone who needs a hug a\nhug so it's can feel really embarrassing\nto ask for a hug it can feel really\ncreepy to to ask for a hug but as you go\nabout your day you may notice that there\nare people who are not having the best\ntime and you can say hey it sounds like\nyou're not having the best day do you\nneed a hug just offer them a hug and\njust give them a simple hug that's it\nnothing more nothing less remember we\ngot to start small and you're like well\nwhat do I do after that right so there's\nyour intelligence again saying that's\nnot enough that's not going to fix my\nproblems I don't want to take the first\nstep unless I can figure out how to do\nthe last step what comes next and that's\nthe problem you can't always know what\ncomes next you have to start taking\nsimple steps to start making progress\nright that's the strategy the strategy\nis not I need to figure out one to 100\nbefore I take step number one that's\nwhat got you here the strategy if you\nwant to get to 100 is you got to take\none step and then you got to figure out\nthe second one and you got to figure out\nthe third one and then you got to figure\nout the fourth one but you can take one\nstep at a time that's the only way you\ncan do it you can't climb a mountain in\nany other way than taking one step at a\ntime so what I encourage you all to do\nis try to engage in some human contact\nright and I know that everyone's going\nto meme about that but I'm serious like\nwe we know that hugging people leads to\na release of oxytocin now the the common\npediatric recommendation is that when\nyou have a newborn child that you do\nsomething called skin-to-skin Contact\nand there are some physiologic reasons\nfor this babies have really thin skin\nand they like you know can't maintain\ntheir own body temperature so their skin\nis actually really absorbent for your\nbody heat so that's one reason but the\nother thing is that we know that this\nactually facilitates bonding with with\nkids right so human beings are wired to\nbond through touch and even though it\ncan feel kind of embarrassing and that's\nwhy I'm saying don't go out there and\nask for a hug right so how can we make\nit easy for you you can offer a hug and\nit may hurt to get rejected but that\ndoesn't necessarily mean they're\nrejecting you that means that they may\nnot want a hug right there and so just\noffer people a hug if they need it\nthat's all I'm asking and so if you're\nsomeone who's ended up being kind of\nthis lonely genius I don't blame you at\nall chances are you're in this situation\nbecause you've had to adapt to a lot of\ncircumstances in life and the basic\nproblem is that all of your adaptations\ntend to be cognitive in nature\nand cognition just simply can't solve\nall of our problems that's why our\nbrains have emotional circuits instead\nof CPUs right a computer is a fully\ncognitive machine sort of I don't know\nit's AI stuff I guess or Theory Of\nConsciousness or whatever but the whole\npoint is that if you're smart you've\nprobably let certain things like social\nskills empathy emotions atrophy and we\nhave to start engaging some of those if\nyou want to develop self-esteem and get\nconnected to both yourself and other\npeople in\nlife"
