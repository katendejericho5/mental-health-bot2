    "transcript": "in the East they think that if you want\nto be happy in life you need to do four\nthings Dharma\nMoksha okay Dharma means Duty so like be\nlike a decent human being like do what\nyou're supposed to do get a job get\nmarried have kids whatever if that's\nwhat you want second thing they say\nthat's important to be happy in life is\nartha which means wealth so if you're an\naverage person are you financially\nsecure you should check that box the\nthird thing that you should do to be\nhappy in life is gamma or pleasure so\nare you having fun on a day-to-day basis\nlike are you enjoying life do you eat a\ngood taco from time to time do you go\nfor like a middling vacation where\nyou're renting a car and eating at\nbudget places but then have one nice\nmeal and the four things is Moksha or\nEnlightenment and the key thing that I\nlike about this philosophy is that as\nthey sort of assume that you don't have\nto fix all of your problems right at the\nbeginning you can work on one thing you\ncan work on the second thing you can\nwork on the third thing and then once\nyou have all those things settled later\nin life you will be more it's okay to be\ndiscontent"
