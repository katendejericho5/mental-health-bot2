    "transcript": "so one of the simplest things that you\nyou can do if you really want to start\nto get a handle on your ego is anytime\nyou make a conclusion about yourself\ntake a step back and says my mind says\ninstead of I am so my mind says I am a\nfailure instead of I am a failure and\neven creating that little bit of\ndistance if you chip away at it over\ntime will start to change your\nperspective the second thing that you\ncan do is as you start to do this notice\nwhat your mind is saying because that\nsense of failure is not it's coming from\nthe mind right is a inclusion it is a\nmental construction and so you can see\nthe mental construction over here but\nyou're going to be over here and then\nwhat you should ask yourself is if the\nthe sense of failure is within the mind\nwhat is it that's doing the looking and\nis the thing that is doing the looking\nis that a failure that's the question\nyou should ask yourself and that is how\nyou will discover what exist what you\nare which is outside of ego"
