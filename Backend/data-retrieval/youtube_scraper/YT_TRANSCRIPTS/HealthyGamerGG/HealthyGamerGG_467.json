    "transcript": "today we're going to learn about the\nNeuroscience of how to live life Without\nRegrets and we're going to learn this\nfrom a very interesting Source people\nwho have died\nwhen I was working as a psychiatrist I\nnoticed that a lot of my patients\nstruggled with regret they may have\nwhatever diagnosis but when I actually\ntalk to them what I noticed is that they\nwere filled with regret and this looked\nlike a lot of different things so for\nsome of y'all this will look like actual\nregret about the past where you're kind\nof thinking about your past and you're\nsaying man I really screwed up I let\nthat relationship get away from me that\nwas the best relationship breaking up\nwith that person was the biggest mistake\nI made or I can't believe that I didn't\nstudy harder in school and so your mind\nis kind of occupied in the past and\nyou're filled with regret and then what\nhappens is your mind is so occupied in\nthe past about the mistakes that you\nmade that you can't even think about\nfixing them or improving your future so\nhere's my situation I just got back from\nvacation I want to eat food that's\nnutritious and I want to eat foods that\nthat's tasty and that's where Factor\ncomes in the cool thing about all these\nmeals is that they're actually dietitian\napproved and they're already in less\nthan two minutes so we've got jalapeno\nlime chicken we've got Indian butter\nchicken oh my goodness Chipotle rubbed\npork chop turkey chili and zucchini\nvegan mushroom marsala and vegetarian\ntamale Bowl we make a couple of slits\nand then we're gonna go ahead and pop it\nin the microwave so we get a microwave\nDan I don't know I can start to smell it\nit actually smells pretty good let's go\nand open this bad boy up here is our\nvegetarian tamale Bowl Moment of Truth\nI think this is what I really like about\nfactor is that it's really easy to eat\nnutritious on a day-to-day basis without\nsacrificing variety without sacrificing\nconvenience the food is actually quite\ndelicious like I can absolutely eat this\nwhole thing right now head to\nfactor75.com or click the link below and\nuse code healthygamer50 to get 50 off\nyour first Factor box for some of y'all\nthis actually looks like inaction in the\npresent and how does that relate to\nregret well you're sort of thinking well\nI don't know what to major in should I\nmajor in this or should I study this\nshould I take this job should I not take\nthis job and so sometimes the fear of\nregret looks like paralysis in the\npresent because you're so worried about\nmaking the wrong choice if I date the\nwrong person or heaven forbid I marry\nthe wrong person then it'll ruin my life\nand I will be filled with regret so\nwe're paralyzed to act in the present\nbecause we don't know what to do the\nThird Way that this looks and this is\nthe most unusual is maybe you're someone\nwho's very very efficiency oriented and\nanything that you do has to be perfect\nand even when you do a good job there's\na part of your mind that doesn't even\nlet you enjoy it and is kind of beating\nyou up and saying hey you could have\ndone this better you could have done\nthis better you could have done this\nbetter and if you really tunnel down\ninto that that's regret too and so\npeople who are so interested in\noptimizing every corner of their life\nwhy does your life need to be optimized\nwhat are you looking for you're looking\nto wake up tomorrow and not regret the\nactions of today so it's really bizarre\nbut the fear of regret in trying to\navoid regret can keep you stuck in the\npast keep you paralyzed in the present\nand even keep you beating yourself up as\nyou chase a particular future and so\nlet's understand what is the fear of\nregret and where does it really come\nfrom and so the key thing about regret\nis that it relates to time so if you\nsort of think about okay what should I\nmajor in what should I study in college\nif you had an infinite number of years\nthen you could pick one thing and then\nif that didn't work out you could pick\nsomething else\nso if you don't have to worry about this\ndimension of time then you don't have to\nworry about picking the wrong thing if\nyou have an infinite number of\npossibilities for relationships if any\nparticular relationship gets away from\nyou it doesn't really matter right\nbecause you're going to have infinite\nopportunities in the future and so if we\nsort of think about it what is it that\nforces us to regret it's the limitation\nof time and if we think take it one step\nfurther why is our time limited on this\nEarth because we die so there's this\nfantastic text called the Tibetan book\nof living and dying where this group of\nTibetan Monks sort of figured this out\nthey figured out that the fundamental\nproblem with attachment of life and\nregret is the fear of death because\nsince we're going to die one day our\ntime is limited obvious right if our\ntime is limited we have to use time\nefficiently we can't afford to make\nmistakes and if we screw up that time is\nnever coming back so regret has to do\nwith limited time limited time has to do\nwith the fear of death how do we tackle\nthis problem them and start to learn how\nto live life Without Regrets this is\nwhere we're going to turn to\nneuroscience and this is where there's a\nfascinating case that I want to share\nwith you all generally speaking when we\nlook at what happens to the brain when\nwe die we're not actually watching the\nbrain someone has died and then we'll do\nan autopsy or we can sort of do a brain\nscan or something like that we can\nmeasure the anatomical structures and we\ncan see what happens to the brain after\ndeath but we don't actually see what\nhappens to the brain when we die and so\nthere's a really awesome case report\nthat had an EEG which is an\nelectroencephalogram which is something\nthat's measuring the electrical activity\nof the brain and we've had a couple of\ncases now in science where we've\nliterally watched the brain die and what\nwe've learned is incredibly fascinating\nthe first thing to understand is that\nwhen people die there is a synchronicity\nof all parts of our brain and that if\nyou sort of look at what happens is\nthere's this midline cortical structure\nthere's this one kind of area of the\nbrain that seems to be be affected by\nthe process of death and what we sort of\nknow is that we've seen a bunch of\nelectrical activity but then we'll have\npeople who go into brain death we'll see\nthis change in midline cortical activity\nwe'll see the synchronicity across all\nthe brain and then if we bring that\nperson back to life we can actually ask\nthem what was being dead what did it\nfeel like what was it like to actually\nbe dead and we can actually get answers\nto what is going on in the brain so when\nthis goes on in the brain what is this\nperson's subjective experience and what\nwe tend to find and now we've got tons\nof cases of this kind of stuff is that\nwhen people die their sense of self kind\nof dissolves so they sort of feel this\nlike loss of the barrier of self so I'm\nnot me anymore I'm just kind of this\nformless presence and I feel really\nconnected to everyone for some people\nlife flashes but before their eyes in\nevery moment of your life kind of like\nruns through your mind and that could be\nthat synchronous synchronicity across\nall the brains so you've got this\nhyperactivation of the brain right\nbefore you die but the subjective\nexperience is that I lose my sense of\nself I feel like the personhood within\nme has died and so the interesting thing\nis if you ask people like what was it\nlike to be dead they actually say it's\nreally great so there are lots of cases\nwhere people really enjoy being dead I\nknow it's kind of weird but that's\nreally literally what they say that when\nI sort of lose my sense of self I feel\nvery peaceful I feel very connected it\nfeels amazing it feels like I'm in a\nwomb I'm not advocating that you'll go\nkill yourselves please don't do that\nwe're going to teach you how to get all\nthe benefits of that without actually\ndying what it comes down to and what\npeople have sort of called This is ego\ndeath so scientists have studied this\nand even psychologists have studied this\ntherapists have studied this they've\nconcluded that patients go through this\nexperience of ego death when they die in\naddition to bodily functions there's a\nsubjective experience that the sense of\nself dissolves and so then the question\nkind of becomes okay if the sense of\nself dissolves when we die which makes\nsense right then and that makes us feel\nhappy and Blissful then the opposite\nshould be true as well right the set as\nthe sense sense of self increases does\nthat increase our pain and suffering of\nlife and that's what we actually know to\nbe scientifically true as well and this\nis where if you look at someone like who\nhas schizophrenia someone who has\nschizophrenia has an overactive sense of\nself now that may sound kind of weird\nI'm not talking about narcissism\nliterally what happens in schizophrenia\nis the part of our brain that Associates\nourselves with external stimuli is\nhyperactive so I'll give you all a\nreally simple example because I know\nthat sounds confusing so if I'm walking\ndown the street and I walk past someone\nwho's sitting on a park bench the part\nof my brain that sort of governed itself\ndoesn't connect those two things so I\ndon't think that the person sitting on\nthe Park Bench is in any way connected\nto me the events that happen like other\npeople are living their own lives\nthere's random events going on in the\nworld it doesn't all tie back to me I'm\nover here and there's random crap going\non out there but when you take someone\nwho has something like paranoid\nschizophrenia literally what we know\nfrom brain scans and tons of scientific\nstudies is that the part of their brain\nthat governs self ties themselves to all\nkinds of stimuli in the environment so\nsuddenly two people sitting on a park\nbench are monitoring me there's a car\nthat drove past and then I saw it\nreverse and park holy crap that that\nperson parked because of me so all of\nthese stimuli all around us suddenly get\ntied into our sense of self and this is\nsomething that is incredibly incredibly\nI don't know how to it's like terrible\nto live through these people suffer\nevery day because all of these benign\nstimuli that have nothing to do with me\nget associated with me and so we even\nhave evidence that ego death leads to\npeace and that hyperactivation of the\nego leads to suffering we also see this\nin cases of depression so this is what's\nreally cool is we can look at studies on\npsychedelics and if we look at studies\non psychedelics we know that\npsychedelics can have a profound\npositive fact for people who are\ndepressed and if we look at the\nmechanism how do does a psychedelic\naffect and help a person with depression\nit turns out that the more ego death\nthey experience during their psychedelic\nexperience determines how much their\ndepression improves and there are even\nstudies that have looked at the\ntherapeutic value of psychedelics and\nthey've looked at people who haven't\nbenefited and then they've asked them\nwhat was your psychedelic experience\nlike and it turns out that the people\nwho had more of an ego death experience\ntheir depression improves and people who\nhave a psychedelic experience without\nego death their depression actually\nstays relatively the same and this is\nanother reason why I don't recommend\npeople go out and just do psychedelics\nbecause it's not that the Psychedelic\nitself magically transforms and gets rid\nof depression there seems to be some way\nto kind of activate that ego death and\nthat's really what we're looking for\nsubjectively what this feels like is\npeople will say I feel connected to\neveryone else the barriers of self kind\nof break down and I'm connected to my\nother human beings and this sort of\nleads to a sense of compassion and stuff\nlike that and even on the Neuroscience\nstandpoint we kind of know this we know\nthat when people are depressed there's a\npart of their brain that's hyperactive\nwhich is called the default mode Network\nand the default mode network is the part\nof our brain that governs our sense of\nself and we know that psychedelics\ndisable this ketamine which is a\ndissociative agent disables this and the\nthird thing that's really interesting is\nmeditation disables the default mode\nNetwork so now we've reached a point\nwhere we kind of have talked to people\nwho have died we've studied their\nelectrical activity and we kind of know\nthat as people die they sort of feel\nreally peaceful there's this sense of\nego death and the opposite of ego death\nleads to suffering so how does the\nNeuroscience of ego death tie into\nliving a life Without Regrets and this\nis where we kind of come back to that\nTibetan book of living and dying where\nthey sort of figured out that what is\nthe cause of the fear of death how do we\nas monks conquer the fear of death and\nwhat they concluded is that\nmisidentification with our ego is where\nthe fear of death actually comes from\nand this is kind of fascinating right\nbecause this is exactly what the\nNeuroscience showed us when we\ndisidentify from our ego through ego\ndeath then we enter a blissed out State\nand the Tibetan Monks figured this out\nthousands of years ago and so they sort\nof figured out is that if you want to\nlive a life of joy and Bliss and Without\nRegrets and you want to conquer that\nfear of death the way that you do it is\nby de-identifying with the ego the\nSanskrit term for this is a humgar and\nwe're going to dive into this a little\nbit more so let's understand how the\naham God leads to suffering so when I\nsort of think about so now like I I was\nborn alok right but at some point I\nbecame Dr K and the interesting thing is\nthat once I become Dr k i open myself up\nto all kinds of joy and suffering so now\nthat I am Dr K I'm a big guy and that\npumps up my ego right and I sort of feel\nlike I'm a somebody but the interesting\nthat happens is the moment I start\npumping up my ego all these other\nthoughts kind of come in well what\nhappens if there's going to be a doctor\none day who's who's better than I am\nwho's more handsome and more beautiful\nthan I am oh my God I'm now 40 years old\nI'm getting older Dr K is going to be\nolder there's going to be someone sexier\nand more beautiful and more\nknowledgeable and knows more than I do\noh my God Dr K is not going to be so\ngreat in the future or someone will\nstart talking me on the internet\nright and now suddenly like Dr K like\nthat hurts me because I I identify with\nDr K so the moment that I put on the\nmantle of this ego identification I\nactually open myself up to a lot of\nPride but Pride doesn't really feel good\nright even if it feels good for a little\nwhile like any time you feel prideful\nthat's not going to last forever and\npride and insecurity go hand in hand and\nso I open myself up to a lot of\ndifferent hurt and so this is what's\nkind of weird the Yogi's kind of figured\nout that what I think think I am is not\nreally what I am and you may have\nexperienced this if you sort of thought\noh my God my life is falling apart I am\nscrewed but if you sort of think about I\nam screwed the only way you can be\nscrewed is if you are identified with\nthat eye and maybe it's a breakup or\nmaybe it's failing a single class and\nthen you think your life is over but\nyou're unable to take a step back and at\nsome point as you grow older you learn\nhow to take a step back right you start\nto learn oh the world doesn't revolve\naround me even though everything with my\nego based life I thought this was\neverything in my life falls apart it\ndoesn't mean that my life is actually\nover so even everyone sort of learns\nsome degree of that distance of\nidentification with the self and if you\nreally want to conquer this we're going\nto teach you a technique that will sort\nof train you in the process of\ndisidentifying with yourself and that is\nsomething that I call the mech pilot\nmeditation so when we sort of sit down\nand think think about ourselves I think\nof this as part of me so if you do\nstudies on people and you ask them if\nyou lost both of your hands what would\nyou do and a lot of people were would\nsay things like okay if I lost both of\nmy hands I wouldn't even want to be\nalive I would kill myself I would rather\nbe dead than lose both of my lives this\nis the way that people think because\nthey think I am mean oh my god without\nmy my hands I wouldn't be able to live\nthe interesting thing is when you\nactually have accidents with people who\nlose limbs ahead of time they think that\nthey don't want to live but afterwards\nbasically everyone adapts like 95 I\ndon't have specific statistics but I\nwant to say 95 to 99 of people actually\nadapt to losing a laminar actually\ntotally fine with it so it's that idea\nof who they are in the life that they\nthey can live that sort of gets changed\nand then human beings learn to adapt so\nthat's not really who you are and your\nthe sense of self changes right your\nthoughts change your identity changes\ntoday I'm a doctor but I wasn't born a\ndoctor but I'm still me I was me when\nI'm born and I'm me now but doctor isn't\nnecessarily a part of it right because\nif doctor is a core part of my identity\nthen it had to be there when I was born\nso there's kind of this weird thing that\nthe yogis kind of figured out which is\nthat there's a Transcendent sense of\nself your emotions change on a\nday-to-day basis what you identify\nchanges on a day-to-day basis hell even\nyour gender for some people changes over\nthe course of their life so there's a\nlot of stuff about our ego that we think\nwe are we're really none of those things\nand the yogis actually figured out a way\nto teach you who you truly are and\nthat's the mech pilot meditation and so\nis it possible to achieve dissolution of\nthe ego or separation from the ego\nwithout dying or using psychedelics and\nthe answer is absolutely thankfully\nthese Tibetan Monks and people in\nancient India actually figured this out\nso I'm going to teach y'all something\ncalled the mech pilot meditation that's\nnot the original Sanskrit that's just\nsort of my adaptation okay so we have to\nstart by understanding a little bit\nabout what the ego is from a yogic\nperspective and what the true self is\nfrom the yogic perspective so with the\nyogis and monks in Ancient India China\nTibet basically figured out is that\nthere's one part of us that is constant\nand that is really what we really truly\nare so if you sort of think about your\nbody and mind the observation that they\nmade is that the body and mind changes\nover time and so for example who I am\ncan't be my body because I'm always me\nbut my body is different so when I'm\nfirst born I you know I'm very small\nlike I'm maybe like a foot tall and then\nas I go on throughout my life my body\nwill change but I'm always me and they\nsort of tunnel down even further and\nrealize that even these things in the\nmind which we normally identify with\neven if we don't identify with the body\nbecause even if you lose a limb like\nlet's say something happens and I lose a\nhand or I lose a foot I'm still me and\nso the next thing that they kind of\nlooked at is okay is is me or does me\ncome from the mind and they sort of\nconcluded that similarly me does not\ncome from the mind so the ego comes from\nthe mind but who you truly are is\noutside of the mind as well and the way\nthat they kind of observe this is that\nthey notice that once again the Mind\nfluctuates so all the activities of the\nMind are never permanent all of our\nemotions all of our thoughts even our\nsense of ego or identity will change\nover time I used to be a winner and now\nI'm a loser therefore that's not really\nconstant what they tunnel down into and\nwhat they discovered is the one thing\nthat is constant\nis your capacity to experience observe\nor witness so I know this sounds kind of\nweird but if you think about any\nexperience that you've had in life\nwhether it's good or bad whether it's\npainful or pleasurable the one common\nelement the one thing that ties together\nevery part of your life is the fact that\nyou experienced it and even Descartes\nkind of tunnel down into this or\ndiscovered this with kajito ergo sum\nwhich means I think therefore I am and\nwhat Descartes sort of looked at is he\nsaid that okay I can't trust my mind\nmaybe my mind has hallucinations\nsometimes people think wrong things so\neven sensory perceptions can be wrong\nbut the one thing that is is Descartes\nFoundation as well is no matter whether\nI'm hallucinating or not there is at\nleast something that is experiencing the\nhallucinations and the yogis discovered\nthe exact same thing so if we want to\ndisidentify from the ego and the ego is\ngoing to be sort of the way that we\nattach ourselves to our body and our\nmind the way to do that is the mech\npilot meditation and this meditation is\nvery very simple but it's not actually\nquite difficult and you have to do it\nfor a long period of time to really see\nresults so all you have to do for the\nmech pilot meditation just close your\neyes and all of the parts of you that\nyou think are you imagine that you are a\npilot controlling a Mech and so if I\ntell my arm so this is this is my arm\nright so I think that this is part of me\nbut if I kind of just wave it through\nthe air with my eyes closed which you'll\nkind of notice is that you can send a\ncommand from somewhere up here and that\nthe body will hopefully listen you can\nalso send a command from somewhere up\nhere and the mind will hopefully listen\nand y'all may have sort of realized this\nthat sometimes you get your you try to\nget your mind to do stuff but the mind\ndoesn't actually listen and so the\nquestion becomes okay if I'm trying to\nforce my mind to focus which part of me\nis forcing the mind to focus because\nit's clearly not like I'm trying to\nforce my mind right so in that moment my\nmind is outside of me at some something\nthat I'm trying to con exert control\nover so the Yogi's basically figured out\nand this is what I encourage you all to\ndo the mech pilot meditation is notice\nthat the things that you normally think\nare you are actually objects for you to\nact on so whether it's flexing my hand\nright or it's directing my mind to do\nsomething and then something interesting\nhappens as you all sort of notice that\nthese things are outside of you you can\nalso ground yourself kind of in this\nawareness and it's kind of hard to\ndescribe but if you close your eyes and\nyou sort of notice where do you witness\nthings where do you sort of feel that\ninterpretation of body signals like\nwhere's that Center where all of this\nsensory information comes from it\nactually comes from like somewhere up\nhere so what I want you all to do in the\nmech pilot meditation is first of all\njust observe that all of the things that\nare you are actually things that you can\nlook down on as a Mech pilot and the\nsecond step to the meditation is to\nactually start to sit in that place when\nyou feel identified with the body or the\nmind so I recently did this I got food\npoisoning recently and this is one of\nthe challenges that I used to have where\neven with food poisoning I feel like I'm\nsuffering but the more that I sit inside\nthe mech pilot the more tolerable the\nsuffering becomes and my original\nresearch when I was doing this work at\nHarvard Medical School was actually on\npatients with chronic pain and I would\nteach them to meditate and then I would\nkind of ask them\nhey what is your pain score when you\nlearn how to meditate and the\ninteresting thing about this study was\nthat they found that the pain scores did\nnot actually improve so if you teach\nsomeone to meditate who's got metastatic\ncancer their pain doesn't actually get\nbetter but as I talked to them I said\nbut you are feeling better why is that\nand they said well it feels like there's\na window between me and the pain the\npain hasn't actually gotten better it's\njust it affects me less so this this\nprinciple is actually tied into this\nidea of the mech pilot meditation and\nthe more that you can take distance from\nyourself and sort of just sit and notice\nthe experience notice the witness the\nmore that you can take a step back from\nyour life the more chill your life will\nbecome and as you get stronger in this\ntechnique as you learn how to witness\nand just sit with your experience what\nyou'll start to discover is that your\nlife will have fewer and fewer regrets\nthank you"
