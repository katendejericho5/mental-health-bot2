    "transcript": "what you give people is what they're\ngoing to want so we see this a lot with\nlike streamers and parasocial\nrelationships but this is true of like\neveryday relationships too that if you\ngive people complete access to your life\nthat's what they're going to come to\nexpect and they'll start to get really\nreally upset if you ever try to take\nthat away but this is also true of like\nour everyday relationships where I know\nso many people who will allow others to\nviolate their boundaries and then I get\nstuck in this really really interesting\ntrap which is if I ever tell them no\nthey start to leave and this was the\nvery thing that I was afraid of to begin\nwith and now all of my fears are coming\ntrue by setting boundaries but the\nreally tricky thing is that this is a\nproblem of my own creation when I\ntolerated it in the first place when I\nset a particular standard then people\nbecome entitled to violating my\nboundaries and the whole reason I let\nthem do that in the first place is\nbecause I'm afraid of them leaving and\nso it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy\nwhich is why people get stuck"
