    "transcript": "but I would say the majority of people\nare actually like you and this is the\npart that we never talk about it's like\nhow is it actually affecting your life\nlike is it even if it's not a huge\nproblem should you use should you not\nuse as a good as a bad like the truth is\nthat 80 of people are just like you and\nprobably somewhere in the middle\n[Music]\nhow are you today\nuh I'm good I had I had my final exams\ntoday for my for my classes awesome\nright and got any plans for later today\nuh none at all okay awesome and what do\nyou go by uh I I go by Rogan mainly that\nis my my name okay nice to meet you\nRogan so talk to me about marijuana dude\nso I actually had haven't been doing it\nfor that long so I can't I moved up to\nCanada for schooling\nfrom uh from from the southern half of\nthe states and uh then when I turned 19\nit's like you know okay cool I can I can\nget all the stuff legally now so it's\nlike you know why not try it you know I\ntried it and then I did it the next day\nand then I and then a few days later did\nit again and then it just became more\noften and then and now it's like like I\nI I'm doing it every day but I'm\nmanaging to keep it within like times\nwhere I know I'm not doing anything I\ndon't have any responsibilities going on\nwhen when I start to get a little\noverwhelmed it's like okay let me let me\nlet me have a little bit\nsee if I can unwind okay if you're ready\nto take the next step on your mental\nhealth Journey check out Dr K's guide\nit's an immersive resource that distills\nover 20 years of my experience laid out\nin a way that is tailored to your needs\nso if you're ready to better understand\nyour mind and take control of it check\nout the link in the description below\nhow far along are you in in college so\nit's only a one year long program it's\nmore like a trade school type thing okay\nand I just finished my final exams this\nmorning and graduations next Friday wow\ndude congratulations thank you sounds\nlike you first used marijuana I'm\nassuming that you started in the fall\nuh yeah uh about like like uh November\nDecember okay so so and that's when you\nfirst started using marijuana when you\ntried it yes yes and can you tell us a\nlittle bit about what was in your head\nwhen you tried it for the first time\nso when I first tried it I was with one\nof my housemates uh out back and it's\nlike you know uh I took uh at that time\nuh we were just using his bong and it's\nlike first hit it's like you know 30\nminutes go by nothing happens second\nnothing happens third and then you know\n15 minutes after it all hits you\nuh but uh it's like that first time it's\nlike you know it was fun it was it was\nreally fun it was um\nbecause because you know it was\nsomething I had never experienced before\nso it was like like it was just like\nwhoa this is cool\nit just kind of kind of satisfying that\nCuriosity okay and and what was when you\nsay it hits you what does that feel like\nwell when it hit me it's like everything\nZoom it like like at least what I felt\nit felt like everything just kind of\nzoomed out just a little bit hmm\nokay and then and and like my face\nmuscles just kind of got tighter that\nwas early\nthat's what I felt personally okay I've\nhad I've had a lot of people have\ndifferent reactions and and what what\nwas fun about it\nI guess the most fun thing was you know\njust kind of like the the sort of\nrelaxing feeling it brought and it's\nlike you know it just you just kind of\nsit down and let it take over\nand what does it do when it takes over\nwell\nuh I often just end up sitting sitting\ndown like listening to music uh and I'll\nlike notice more in the music like like\nsay I I didn't notice before or it just\nfeels different to listen to it\nyeah so I think it's very common for\npeople to find that\nsensory experiences are far richer when\nthey're high would you say that that's\nthe case with you\nyes in both good and bad ways how so\nso like like the good ways of course was\nlike like music movies any sort of stuff\nlike that and but uh what I found\nrecently is it kind of like amplifies\nwhatever feeling I had before\nyou know it's kind of like oh I'm having\na shitty day let me let me see if this\nhelps and then like it'll help like 15\nminutes and after that it's like you\nknow I feel worse\nokay so it sounds like it does help\ntemporarily but then like you're saying\nit kind of amplifies so if you're in a\nbad space it makes you go into a worse\nspace for me it does I like I know\npeople who will go into it in like the\nworst mind state but you know feel\namazing the entire time\nokay I I like I I don't know if that's\nsomething with like different strains or\njust like body compositions or what but\nyeah it seems to some people it kind of\ntakes away the negativity but for you it\nseems to enhance it now it does yes they\nused to not well and and what did it\nused to do I I used to just not you know\nthink about anything while I was high\nit's like you know I would I would I\nwould get high brain would shut off and\nyou know just like you know just just do\nthings but you're not thinking about\nanything except for what is happening\nright then presently okay so it sort of\nreally helps you be kind of absorbed in\nthe present moment\nokay so you find that things from the\npast kind of come into your mind and\ndisrupt your ability to be in the\npresent yes okay\nand so so it seems like marijuana used\nto kind of make that go away\nyes\nand what was like the first let's say\nweek or month of use like for you I\nwouldn't I wouldn't uh do it on like\nschool nights because I'm I'm like just\nin case anything anything happens I\ndon't wanna uh\nmiss anything but then as it as we've\ngot into like the further terms it's\nlike it's like it's like it's a Tuesday\nit's like four o'clock I'll be fine by\nthe time I go to bed\nso what I'm sort of noticing is that\nokay so originally it was like Fridays\nand Saturdays right because like there's\nlike there's the work week and then\nwe're gonna like to party on the\nweekends right yeah there's a there's a\ntime for fun and there's a time for for\nwork and also we you kind of are aware\nthat marijuana potentially this is a\nhotly debated topic interferes with your\ncapacity to do work\nright and and so I'm noticing that you\nkind of thought well I shouldn't use\nduring the week did you used to think\nthat way yes and then your mind started\nto say like well I think I can kind of\nget away with it\nI guess it was like it was it was like\nI'm bored and I can't figure out what to\ndo so I'm gonna get high and then see\nsee if I find something to do and so you\nmentioned earlier that sometimes you\nwould feel overwhelmed or you would\nstart to get overwhelmed and then you\nwould start to use marijuana can you\ntell us about that like what is that\nwhat is that experience like\nlike I I use an example\num so for some for one of my final\nprojects I had to like design and put on\na show\num and the first time I went through it\nuh the video did not record and the live\nstream of it did not go live\nso I like afterwards that was you know\ntrying to figure out how like\nrescheduling it you know I was super\nstressed because I'm like okay this is\nmy project I could I could flunk out\nbecause of this\nand you know it's just that sort of\noverthinking and getting\ntoo into what could go wrong\nokay and then and then it's like okay I\nneed to I need to slow down I need to I\nneed to just I I need to put everything\nat a manageable pace so like I'll then\nI'll go have have uh just smoke a little\nbit and then come back inside sit down\nbreathe let it take effect and then\nresume whatever I was doing\nso what I'm hearing is that it may not\nhave actually improved your performance\nbut it made it easier for you to do like\ninternally yes right so it's like you're\nnot stressing as much you're kind of\nchill about it but you may be like\nslightly disorganized you're kind of\nlike you're able to focus on one thing\nbut so it's helping you kind of\ninternally do the work but it's not\nactually helping the work itself\nyes okay and and so what it sounded like\nyou started using it every every day at\nsome point so when I started using it\nevery day it's like I would I would wake\nup go to class uh then come back and I'm\nlike okay cool I don't have anything to\ndo for the next three four hours\nlet's let let smoke I'll come down by\nthe time I have to do anything\nuh and that became every day\nand it just started to kind of almost\nlose that magic it had\nbut you know it's like but at some point\nyou're like well why not\nyeah so so it's it's it sort of becomes\nan activity that you sort of use to fill\ngaps in your day yes\nyeah so tell tell me about you know\nwhat's what's your marijuana use like\nnow how do you feel about it how does it\nmake you feel\num\nI would say it's like\num beforehand it's like okay you know\nI'm I'm bored I'm gonna I'll be like\nwatch a movie watch the videos it's like\nyou know what why not get high while I\ndo it just to see if it enhances it a\nlittle bit\num\nbut usually it's like it's like like\nI'll be distracted watching something\nelse and then you know something I don't\nwant to think about just you know Pops\nPops out of nowhere and it's like okay\ncool now now now it's ruined\nand this is what happens when you get\nhigh\nuh yeah\ncan you tell us about that yeah like uh\nI think a day or two ago\num I was I was just watching a movie and\nthen and then it's and then like the\nmemory pops into my head of hey remember\nremember that that that girl that left\nyou purely because you weren't like\nphysically close enough yeah uh uh you\ndidn't get a fair chance you know you\nknow it's like it's like a sort of echo\nchamber type stuff where it's like okay\nsomething something I thought thought\nyears ago comes back and this happens\nmore when you get high now\nyes\nand you still get high every day\nyeah why\nI guess I guess it's really\num\nuh\nto to uh kind of have that sort of\na\nI don't know how to like say it\num\nit is\nit's almost like it's a it's like okay\nhere's a here's something that that can\nbe a constant\nhere's something that you know can be\ncan be always in the background or or\nsomething it's it's it it's some sort of\nconsistency\nalmost like a safety mat\nyes\nhmm\nand what is it consistently give you\nlike when it first starts happening and\nthen you know it it but like it so like\nif I'm if I'm high or if I'm getting\nhigh and I'm like playing a stupid game\nwith some friends you know for that like\nfirst bit of me being high it's like\nit's like okay cool I'm I'm having fun\nI'm doing I'm just you know hanging out\nwith my friends then you know as as as\nthings do you know you know eventually\nyou stop playing the game\nand then I sit down and it's just me\nalone with my thoughts\nand then and then once I realize that's\njust me\nit it just kind of starts to derail\nso it sounds like it's a ticket to fun\nbut like at some point you get off the\ntrain\nyes you know and then you're just left\nwith your own thoughts and and how long\ndoes that linger like how long does it\ntake you to sober up depending on on the\nstrength that I get it's it's anywhere\nfrom like maybe an hour and a half\nsometimes two three or or or if I just\nkeep going it can be all day got it so\nso it sounds like your mind will kind of\nlike churn up\nthese old things but I'm not getting the\nsense that you get resolution but maybe\nsometimes you get progress when you're\nthis way or no\nsometimes yes\nso I'm hearing that it doesn't cause\nproblems in your life like it hasn't\nimpaired my function for anything okay\nit's like but it's like I still work\nperfectly fine I still go to school\nperfectly fine how do you feel about\nusing it I don't know if I really know\nhow I feel about it\nand that's another thing it's like it's\nlike okay keep you know keep keep doing\nit it's it's it's it's\nit's almost like okay I I had fun these\ntimes let's let's see if it's fun this\ntime\nyou know recently what is the longest\namount of time you have gone without\nusing\nfour or five days\nand when was the last time you went four\nor five days without using\nlast last week two weeks ago and how do\nyou feel when you're doing that\nI mean it's it's not like a hard thing\nto do\nit's just it's it's it's like it's like\nman\nif if it's like it's like it's like I'm\nso bored if I if if I got high I could\nfigure out what to do\nyou know or or or if it's or it's like\nif I got high maybe what I'm doing would\nbe just a little bit more entertaining\nokay\nI'm gonna try to stitch some things\ntogether and I'm gonna ask you like a\ncouple questions and try to like lay\nstuff out so I'm gonna go grab my iPad\nif that's cool so let's start by\nunderstanding clinical perspectives so\nwhen we think about clinical addiction\nwhat we think about is impairment of\nfunction\nso if you can look at all substances or\nall addictions and basically like\nin Psychiatry what we do is if it is\nmessing with your life it is negatively\nimpacting you in some significant way\nthat's what we sort of think about as an\naddiction\nnow I'm hearing that it's not impairing\nyour function but I also haven't\nassessed you clinically for it so when\nwe do clinical assessments on addiction\nwe'll sort of talk about you know like\nwe'll ask people like hey you know is it\ncausing problems in school is it causing\nproblems with your relationships is it\ncausing problems with your parents is it\naltering your mood is it altering your\nphysical health there's all kinds of\nthings do you experience withdrawal\nthere's all kinds of features that we\nwill assess that's not really what this\nconversation is about\nand I really actually appreciate that\nand the first thing that I want to say\nuh Rogan is thank you very much for\nhaving this conversation because if I\nwhen I think about people who use\nmarijuana\nlet's say this is the portion that maybe\nis clinically addicted\nthis is the portion that is totally okay\nwith their usage\nbut I would say the majority of people\nare actually like you and this is the\npart that we never talk about it's like\nhow is it actually affecting your life\nlike is it even if it's not a huge\nproblem should you use should you not\nuse as a good as a bad like the truth is\nthat eighty percent of people are just\nlike you and probably somewhere in the\nmiddle and these are the people that you\nknow we really need to talk to because I\nthink there's a lot going on in the\ntrajectory of your life that is being\naffected by marijuana but since these\npeople are not clinically addicted and\nmaybe you you are who knows\nlike all of the attention that we give\npeople is the is the people over here\nright and sometimes we get into beef\nwith people over here and we argue with\nthem but this is actually like this is\nthe majority of where the people who use\nmarijuana live and this is the majority\nof where like the impact in your life is\nand it's like not addiction then the\nanswer is simple but here's a huge\nquestion mark so I'd like to talk to you\nabout this does that work yeah okay\nso I'm going to start off with a bias\nwhich is that I think that this is a\nproblem\nso I'm stating that you know straight up\nI I like I said I don't know I have no\nidea if you're addicted or not but I see\nproblems in the trajectory of your life\nand I'm laying that out front and center\nso that\nI could be wrong so you can disagree\nwith that judgment and but everything\nthat I'm saying is going to be colored\nthrough that lens okay does that make\nsense yes so let's understand something\nabout marijuana\num so\nI think the basic the basic issue that I\nsee is that I believe it is stunting\nyour growth\nnow this is important to understand\nbecause it doesn't mean that it is\ncreating it's not lighting something on\nfire\nit seems to me like marijuana is leading\nto you stalling some in the trajectory\nof your life this is this is the thing\nthat I am the most concerned about for\nyou does that make sense yes so I'm not\nsaying it it is true I'm not saying that\nit is stunting your growth it's that\nwhen I listen to your story I see yellow\nflags about it's stalling like you feel\nlike you're stalling to me I feel like\nI'm not ready to move on to move right\nlike I'm not ready to to to make these\nbig life choices but it's like you know\nI'm going through with it I'm doing it\nyep it's like it's like it's it's like\nit's almost mentally stunting but you\nknow I'm still I'm still doing it yep\nthat's exactly what I I completely agree\n100 right so what I think it's actually\ninterfering with is your progression\ntowards Readiness not the actual action\nor or not in action\nso like I'm with you that you're not\nready but that's where I think the\nproblem is and that's where I think it's\ncontributing so I think we're sort of on\nthe same page but so so let's start off\nwhen someone starts using marijuana the\nfirst thing is that it's fun\nso what marijuana does is it allows us\nto extract\nmore pleasure\nfrom\na given\nactivity\nwhen you get high do you get the\nmunchies Rogan\num I used to I've uh but uh I I I\nstarted eating a lot\nand I've just I've generally like it's\nlike okay I want to eat right now but\nI'm not going to sure but how does food\ntaste when you're high\noh it always tastes amazing right oh\nit's always it's always so fun and and\nso that that's what it does like so in\nlife we have all these experiences like\neating things and listening to music and\nother usually like physical Sensations\nwill feel like looking at things like\nyou know looking at a tree branch like\nyou mentioned so this is how it starts\nout being fun\nand then what starts to happen is that\nafter a while this is a very consistent\npattern then what the cool thing is that\nif anything can be more fun on marijuana\nwhat that means is that boring\nactivities\ncan turn into fun activities like you\nare you said you were staring at a tree\nbranch for a while right and like that's\nsuper cool so even simple things like\neating food and existing and having\nconversations they're they're like low\ndopaminergic activities\nlike conversations\nnature these like low dopaminergic\nactivities and we as a society are\nstarting to struggle because as our\nbrains get more and more dopamine our\ntolerance for low dopaminergic\nactivities goes down\nand so marijuana almost fixes this\nproblem because for some people will say\nlike yeah video games are more fun when\nI play when I get high but if you look\nat how much so a video game will move\nfrom a seven to a nine in terms of\nenjoyment but sitting outside will move\nfrom a two to a nine and so what happens\nin our dopaminergic society is that\nthis becomes harder and harder to do\nand now marijuana makes it easier to do\nthings that are not dopaminergic\nand so now we have this choice of like\nwe're kind of dopaminergically dependent\nbut like now marijuana lets us do other\nstuff like be with nature eat things\nthen something tricky happens because\nonce we once boring activities become\nfun with marijuana then what starts\nhappening is marijuana starts being used\nto alleviate boredom right because like\nanything becomes like what am I going to\ndo today well I I don't have a hundred\ndollars to go out and drink I don't have\nanything else to do so I might as well\nget high\nand so what what kind of happens is that\nlike you're kind of fast forwarding\nthrough a day when you're high does that\nmake sense there's also like impairments\nin time perception and stuff like that\nso instead of being bored a whole\nweekend where you've got nothing to do\nyou can get high and then before you\nknow it the weekend's kind of over and\nlike you didn't get bored you kind of\nhad fun you really enjoyed things moment\nto moment you were in the present moment\nwhich marijuana also helps with\nbut now we've transitioned from it being\nstraight fun\nto alleviating boredom and making\nboredom tolerable\nbut as we start to use marijuana to make\nboredom tolerable\nwe become inherently\nincapable\nof tolerating boredom\nand then what we end up doing is we\ndevelop some amount of Tolerance which\nis it sounds like what you've started to\ndevelop and now what we end up doing is\nusing marijuana to keep boredom at Bay\nand even then it even if we sort of\nlisten to you it sounds like you're not\nhaving a whole lot of fun anymore\nand so like you used to have like a nine\nyou know it used to make things like a\nnine but now like marijuana is barely\nkeeping things at a four to five and\nwithout it we're like kind of dropping\ndown to it too and now you're kind of\nswimming around here\nhow does that sound yep right and so now\nit's like well we originally did this to\nturn a seven into a really a two into a\nnine we used to get a plus seven\nfor marijuana and over here we start to\nget like maybe a plus four and now it's\nlike at this point when we when this\nhappens now we have a a chronic debuff\nof like a minus five\nand then now we use marijuana to get a\nplus four but we're at minus five\nchronic debuff and then plus four and so\nour net is negative one\nand this is kind of where I see you\nthen there are a couple of other angles\nhere so this is why I think that like if\nyou have an extended period of sobriety\nwhere you reduce your physiologic\ntolerance what will happen is what we\nreally want to do is Cleanse This debuff\nand this is what sobriety gets you\nI'm not saying that it's like like you\nknow the rest of the stuff is you can\nstill enjoy it like that's fine but what\nI noticed with a lot of people who use\nmarijuana somewhat chronically is they\nenter into this like chronic debuff\nstate and then you kind of have to use\nit just to keep stuff at Bay\nthat's one angle so the second angle\nthat I think is pretty concerning is if\nyou look at human development\nyou're like in a very like important\nphase of your life right so you're\ntalking about\nand it's true of all kids who are kind\nof your age right you're moving away\nfrom home and this is hard so you're\nfeeling lonely\nisolated\nwithout a safety net\nthese are negative emotions\nwithout marijuana what do you think\nhappens to these feelings\nthey're still there\nand what do they do do you know how do\nthey affect you they they just kind of\nsit there in the back of my head it's\nlike it's like they're not prominent but\nthey don't really go away at all okay\nright they're just kind of like almost\nlike a like a nuisance and it is in the\nback of my head they're a nuisance in\nthe back your head this is what is\nstunting your growth is that they are in\nthe back of your head not in the front\nof your head something that's very\nimportant to understand are negative\nemotions\nare our most powerful motivators\nand this is why negative emotions exist\nnegative emotions aren't a bug they're a\nfeature and they're conserved amongst\nthe entire human race and even outside\nof the human species like dogs have\nnegative emotions like mammals have\nnegative emotions and why is that\nso when we have a negative emotion it is\na signal\nto other parts of your brain so if you\nlook at your hippocampus\nwhich is where we learn from our\nmistakes\nand we start to create new behaviors all\nin the hippocampus the hippocampus is\nvery very tightly connected to our\nnegative emotional circuitry\nso if you look at why do people with\naddictions and I'm not saying you have\nan addiction for talking generally here\nyeah why don't people with addictions\nlearn from their mistakes we see this a\nlot with video game addiction as well\nit's because in order to learn from your\nmistake that negative emotional\ncircuitry has to activate\nand influence your learning circuitry it\nhas to turn on your learning circuitry\nand then you will learn your lesson\nso normally what happens with a 19 year\nold\nwho goes to college right this is\ndevelopmentally appropriate everybody\nfeels lonely and isolated in my case I\nplayed a ton of video games and so\npushed that loneliness and isolation to\nthe back of my mind it came roaring back\nevery every night when I went to sleep\nand then I would suppress it with video\ngames and then I would play so many\nvideo game store when I hit the pillow I\nwould pass out I would stay up to like 6\na.m in the morning I would play games\nuntil I was so exhausted that I knew I\nwould pass out the second my head hit\nthe pillow so I never gave a chance for\nthese negative emotions to come forward\nnow when you push these to the back you\ndon't actually do anything about them\nright so you kind of continue existing\nwhen these emotions are front and center\nyou go down the route of being a PC you\nstart to make changes in your life they\nbecome in you be they hurt you so much\nthat it prompts you to change\nit prompts you to do something different\nwhen we push them towards the back we\nmove down the route of becoming an NPC\nand we start to like it starts to\nnegatively impact our motivation\nand why does it negatively impact our\nmotivation we may think that negative\nemotions It's Tricky it's not just like\none way where negative emotions can kill\nour motivation they can also be fuel for\nour motivation and so like this is the\nthing that you're missing this is what\nI'm worried about I actually don't know\nif you're missing this but this is what\nconcerns me hearing your story and this\nis the primary problem for like all of\nthese people that I've worked with\nanyway and what I tend to see is that\nthey push their negative emotions away\nand then like they start to stall in\nterms of motivation because they're not\nlike learning or growing from that\nnegative emotion they're not taking that\nloneliness and isolation and they're not\nusing that energy to really reach out so\nif we think about what is the feeling of\nloneliness like any time our body needs\nsomething\nit punishes us until we go get it\nbut the problem is that this is going\ninto the background\nwhich is exactly what marijuana does\nright it makes negative emotions go to\nthe background\nwe're running into a couple of other\nproblems the first is that these\nnegative emotions can go into the\nbackground\nbut\nthey're also piling up\nand at some point the suppressive power\nof marijuana is no longer sufficient and\nI think that's what we're kind of seeing\npotentially with you which is that even\nwhen you get high like as long as your\nmind is occupied that's fine but this\nchronic like loneliness that has been\nbuilding up slowly and I love the way\nthat you said it there's no shared\nexperience it's like this vapid shallow\nNPC\nrecycled dialogue [ __ ] at a party\nright yeah and and so as this starts to\npile up it starts to break through\nand now the problem is like so marijuana\ncan you know let's say this is your\nnegative emotional state\nand if we look at marijuana what\nmarijuana does let's say here's your\nnegative emotions what marijuana does is\ngives you a minus five which is a good\nthing right so it lowers it and so it\neffectively becomes let's say a one\nbut the problem is unless you actually\nemotionally process this is going to\ncontinue building and at some point the\nminus five isn't sufficient so even with\na minus five we're still sitting at six\nthe last thing that I want to share with\nyou is I've noticed this as well where\nif we kind of think about this piece\nright if we go back here we extract more\npleasure from life\nwhen we use marijuana so life is like a\nlemon and so normally like we can\nsqueeze like some amount of juice out of\nthe lemon\nand then if we use marijuana we like\ndouble it\nbut at some point like we've squeezed\nall of the juice out and then additional\nmarijuana like the the lemon has run dry\nand so marijuana can give us more\npleasure from food and it can give us\nmore pleasure from music but like\nit can't ever put you into that 12-hour\nconcert where you were standing with\nyour dad\nright if we really think about the\ntransformative experiences marijuana\ncan't give you that and the problem is\nwe get stuck like squeezing this same\nold orange and so there's another orange\nover here which is the orange of life\nexperience\nwhich sure marijuana can can if we're\ngetting let's say three drops out of\nthis even if we get high when we do this\nwe can maybe get a couple more drops or\nmaybe even four\nbut like what what it does is it takes\nwhere we are and it allows us to extract\nmore out of it instead of actually\nmoving us forward\nto these bigger lemons in life that we\ncan get like they just have way more\njuice because you've squeezed all this\n[ __ ] dry dude\nand that's what I get the sense of is\nlike when you use marijuana there's\nnothing left to squeeze\nbut now that you've squeezed this Orange\nDry\nor lemon so now it's like it's dry right\nso it's all shriveled and [ __ ] and so\nnow when you try to squeeze it normally\nall you get is one drop and so if you\nget high maybe you can get a second drop\nout of it but we're still sitting at two\ndrops whereas if you like move forward\nin your life and let's say you engage in\na healthy romantic relationship or you\nfind a fulfilling job or you join a band\nor something like that then we're gonna\nget a whole bigger thing that's gonna\nlike make you enjoy yourself so much\nmore\nI think this is the lens that I would\nencourage people to really think about\nis like what is it doing to the way that\nhow is it shaping your trajectory\nand what I tend to see a lot of is\nintolerance to boredom\nsome kind of some kind of like\npsychological dependence and it's not\nthat one weekend like you know you can\nuse it for a week and not that big of a\ndeal but it's like when every weekend\nyou're just kind of getting high and\nlike aren't doing anything like over two\nof the course of two months you haven't\nmoved forward at all and so what I\nreally noticed is that it it stalls\npeople over time when you were talking\nabout like like like the the completed\nthe borderman and like the progress It's\nalmost like like I'm too busy fighting a\nlosing battle to just run away\nyes [ __ ] hey you should definitely\nwrite lyrics bro\nabsolutely that's it's so well yeah\n[ __ ] brilliant\nit's been it's been like really nice to\nactually be able to talk about this\nstuff though\nand I I'm hoping that you know it kind\nof helps other people who maybe you know\nlike because like like the main reason I\nhad never you know reached out to\nanybody for any mental health reasons\nlike like I I didn't even like I don't\neven reach out to my parents for it\nbecause it's like it's like you know I I\ndon't know what the reaction is gonna be\nI don't I don't know what what what\nother people are gonna think when I ask\nfor help it's like am I going to be seen\nam I going to be seen as weak you know\nand is that going to be used against me\nyou know there's there are other angles\nto this too which we haven't really\ngotten into but um I I've been doing a\nlot of\nreading on male mental health recently\nand I think there's also like there's a\nreason why the majority of people who\nstruggle with marijuana are men\nand and I think that a big part of it is\nlike a lot of stuff that you said which\nis that you know so you're you're\ngrowing up and you're like not allowed\nto express negative emotion you're not\nallowed to process negative emotion\nyou know people manipulate you and you\ndon't even know how to advocate for\nyourself and so then what happens is\nlike as emotion as you lose control of\nemotion\nthe world punishes you for it\nand so then you develop a fear of\nemotion emotion becomes a negative thing\nto be avoided at all costs\nand then you find yourself in a\nsituation that is inducing a negative\nemotion like you move out of the country\nand you're isolated and you're alone and\nyou have no safety net but your whole\nlife you've been taught to fear emotion\nand that emotion has gotten like out of\ncontrol no one's going to teach you\nright because they're going to tell you\nto man up and be quiet and and you got\nto learn how to handle it you got to\nlearn right the onus is on you we're not\ngoing to teach you by the way\nyou got to learn you got to figure it\nout yeah right\nand so we have a very negative\nrelationship and then what happens is\nsomething comes along like like\nmarijuana and if you look at the studies\nwe notice that men especially are more\nprone to substance use than women are\nand I think it has to do with our\nrelationship with our emotions and how\nwe're actually actively punished for\neven engaging in them or expressing them\nor even reaching out for help and then\nwho are you going to reach out with\nyou're going to reach out to a bro right\nand then that guy has Google gone\nthrough the same [ __ ] you've gone\nthrough they don't know what to do with\nthat\nso then they're gonna make a dick joke\nand then y'all laugh about it and then\nyou never talk about it again\nand then Along Comes marijuana\nwhich makes you feel normal\nnow you get to live life the way that\neverybody else appears to be living life\nand then but the problem is that those\nemotions keep piling up and then like\nyou don't ever actually like make\nprogress right because you're fighting\nthis losing battle which is like\nso you're not fighting the battle that\nyou should be the one that you can\nactually win and the one that has the\nprize worth winning\nso I see a lot of like\nthere's a story I hear a lot from Men\nand it's not that women can't go through\nthis story as well basically for all\naddictions they take away some of\nelement of pain but I do think there's a\nepidemiologically manner more more\npeople are addicted who are men than\nwomen\nand I think there's a reason for that it\nmay be biological could be testosterone\nand scrotums but I think it has\nsomething to do with this I just want to\nsay thank you very much Rogan for coming\non thank you yeah for what it's worth I\nthink you're you you strike me as like\nan incredibly strong person I don't know\nif you view yourself that way but\nI mean in in some ways I believe I am in\nother ways it's like you know I still\nfeel like I'm I'm that little kid just\nyeah I think that little kid is within\nyou somewhere for sure\nand and being strong doesn't mean\ngetting rid of the little kid it means\nactually giving that kid a space to\nexist within you and not you know not\ntrying to kick it out and but I mean\nthere's just so much like you know\nyou've overcome a lot I think you've\nreally found something that you truly\nlove which is like something that a lot\nof people struggle with\nyou know I it doesn't sound like you're\nan addict and the problem is that when\nwe talk about substance use we're so\nfocused on the addicts that we don't\nrealize there's a gigantic population of\npeople who are like I don't know how to\nfeel about this\nit's like yeah yeah it's like it's like\nit's like people are focusing on on on\nthose who've already gone over that\nslope rather than preventing people from\ngoing over that slope yeah and and\nhopefully we can alter your course a\nlittle bit but who knows maybe it\ndoesn't even need altering so good luck\nto you man and thank you for coming on\nthank you for the opportunity take care\neverybody\nthank you\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]"
