    "transcript": "so we use this term life syndrome to\nbasically describe this group of people\nwhose lives are so bad as they are\ntrying to survive in life they run into\nmental health challenges they go\nsomewhere they get diagnosed with a\nparticular thing and they just rack up\nthese diagnosis I remember seeing this\nmentioned in an HG video a while ago but\nI don't remember which one it was I'm\nsure it's not an empirical medical\nphenomenon or anything but whatever it\nresembles I'm curious about the outcomes\nof the people who suffer from it is\nthere such thing in living in living in\na situation that is systemically\nunhealthy to the point that there isn't\nany viable path to good mental health\ncan people overcome shitlife syndrome\nsome time ago I talked about this term\n[ __ ] life syndrome so when I was a\nseconde resident at the maybe intern at\nMassachusetts General Hospital I was\nworking with a very very talented Nur\nnurse practitioner she would go see\npatients and then I would ask her you\nknow what's what's the diagnosis of the\npatient and then sometimes she would say\nthat this patient has [ __ ] life syndrome\nand so I was really intrigued by the\nterm and I would ask her like what does\nthat mean and she would basically say\nlike okay so you have these people who\ncome into the emergency room and if you\nlook at what their diagnosis is they\nhave like 15 they have ADHD PTSD\nOppositional Defiant Disorder these were\noften times like children or adolescence\nmajor depressive disorder bipolar\ndisorder and poly substance use so they\nhave all of these different diagnosis\nand the thing about these diagnostic\nconstructs is that the idea that that\nsomeone has six different independent\nbrain pathologies or mental health\npathologies that are all concurrent is\nexceedingly rare and so we use this term\n[ __ ] life syndrome to basically describe\nthis group of people whose lives are so\nbad that as they are trying to survive\nin life they run into mental health\nchallenges they go somewhere they get\ndiagnosed with a particular thing and\nthen just rack up these diagnoses so\nthis is where the term [ __ ] life\nsyndrome comes from so how did tell the\ndifference between mental disorders and\n[ __ ] life syndrome I've been trying to\nanswer this question for a while how do\nI know what's the cause and what's the\neffect when it comes to mental state am\nI depressed and suicidal because of how\nmy life turned out or am I perceiving\nlife to be more shitty than it is\nbecause of underlying mental disorders\nI've never been to a psychiatrist so\nI've never been diagnosed but I've been\ndealing with OCD since I was six I\nexperience a lot of MDD anxiety social\nphobia and ADHD symptoms I've also been\nsuicidal for more than 6 years the thing\nis most of those things appear so small\nwhen put next to seven figures in the\nbank account most of my issues would\nimmediately disappear only then would I\nbe able to do the things because I can\nnot because I have to I experienced what\nI'd call a money induced paralysis it's\nvery unlikely that I'll ever be\nfinancially independent and it's\nunlikely I'll ever find something\ninteresting enough I deem worth pursuing\nfor hours on end those realizations\nalone are enough to make me apathetic\nprocrastinate on all matters and\nbasically give up on life and wait for\nthe right opportunity to kill myself I'd\nrather be dead than live a life I don't\nconsider to be worth the effort I've\nbeen thinking about seeing a\npsychiatrist for the past few months but\nI have my doubts I procrastinate on\nmaking an appointment because it feels\nlike my problems stem from money and\nit's not like they'll make me Rich over\nthere that is enough justification for\nme not to go I also can't get myself to\nschedule other appointments blood tests\nphysio dentist because in my if my life\nwill remain the same despite improving\nin some areas then why bother I'll kill\nmyself anyway without some magical\nEpiphany occurring in my mind I suspect\nthere could be something wrong with my\nbrain because plenty of other people\nhave lives objectively worse than me yet\nthey see survival as something of value\nand of itself that could be the result\nof them being ignorant me being\nungrateful or my brain being disabled so\nsome of us look at our lives and we say\nthat things are objectively bad and we\nlook at our lives and we think okay so\nlike modifying my internal instrument is\nuseless\nif my circumstances are bad right so we\ncan say like okay I'm short I'm bald my\nchances of ending up with someone seem\nvery very very very low so what's the\npoint in trying like the my life is\nobjectively bad and so then like the\nquestion is like okay is this mental\nillness like is this an appropriate\nadaptation to negative\ncircumstances or is this a mental\nillness that is misinterpreting what my\nchances are how do I know which one it\nis the short answer is that it is a\nfalse dichotomy and that even if your\ncircumstances are bad I believe that you\ncan do drastic things to drastically\nimprove your circumstances and if you're\nrebelling against that that is part of\n[ __ ] life syndrome which we'll kind of\nget to right so the first thing that I\nwant you all to notice is that if I say\nthat this is possible your mind will\nautomatically have a reaction and so the\nproblem with [ __ ] life syndrome is that\nyou have objective problems and you have\ninternal problems and the problem is\nthat your object\nproblems you may not be able to fix but\neven when you're subjectively hampering\nyourself it is very difficult to to fix\nyour situation hey all' if you're\ninterested in applying some of the\nprinciples that we share to actually\ncreate change in your life check out Dr\nK's guide to mental health it combines\nover two decades of my experience of\nboth being a monk and a psychiatrist and\ndistills all of the most important\nthings I've learned into a Choose Your\nOwn Adventure format so check out the\nlink in the bio and start your journey\ntoday\nso what is the difference between a\nsetback and a failure so in both cases\nthe objective reality can be the same I\ntried something and I failed the\ndifference between a setback and a\nfailure is whether I decide to try again\nand if I try again and then I succeed\nthen the failure becomes a setback and\nif I decide to stop at that point the\nfailure becomes a failure it is very\nunlikely that I'll ever be financially\nindependent and it's unlikely I'll ever\nfind something interesting enough I deem\nworth pursuing those those realizations\nalone are enough to make me apathetic\nprocrastinate on all matters and\nbasically give up on life right so this\nis where we have to be very very very\ncareful because now what we see is that\nthere is a objective circumstance on the\noutside which results in a realization\nand then that realization creates apathy\nprocrastination and people giving up and\nthen what is responsible for you staying\nstuck it is actually a combination of\nall of these things it is a false dichot\nso let's talk a little bit about [ __ ]\nlife syndrome so this is a psychodynamic\narticle that someone kind of talks about\n[ __ ] life syndrome so uh this is like so\nso this is what's really interesting the\n[ __ ] life syndrome is something that\nclinicians came up with so let's read\nthis case okay in the letter from the\ndoctor we learned that she had\nexperienced a number of problems since\nearly childhood she had initially been\nraised in foster care bad thing number\none abused by a neighbor bad thing\nnumber two left home at only 17 Bad\nThing number three subsequently engaged\nin a series of emotionally and sex\nsexually abusive relationships with men\nbad thing number four this is [ __ ] life\nsyndrome this person it appears does not\nhave a chance bad thing after bad thing\nafter bad thing and there is a lot of\ndata that supports that this is what\nhappens right so we have a lot of\nstudies on something called adverse\nchildhood experiences which is that if\nyou have a bad upbringing what tends to\nhappen is that this correlates with\nworse mental health outcomes worse life\noutcomes this is very common so I've\nsince become very curious about this\nexpression [ __ ] life syndrome not the\nleast because of the implicit consensus\nby everyone in the meeting including\nmyself as to what it meant everyone\nknows what it means even though it's\nnever been defined the phrase seemed to\ndenote a level of long-standing poverty\nfamily breakdown lack of stability\nunemployment and potential risk factors\ncommon to many of the predominantly\nyoung working class patients referred to\nthe service for [ __ ] of course is\nsomething that we generally prefer not\nto think about something we continually\nre get rid of or hide at the same time\nit is something that we cannot\ncompletely repudiate it is part of us\nsomething we need something that is in\nin ineluctably ineluctably I don't even\nknow what that means part of our status\nas human beings is subjects those\nsuffering from [ __ ] life syndrome then\nwould be would seem to be those\nindividuals whose problems are deemed to\nbe so terrible so untouchable that they\nquite literally cannot be thought about\nand cannot be handled by the service no\namount of you coming to my office one\nhour a week for therapy is going to fix\nyour history of abuse your problems with\nemployment your foster care background\nyour history of trauma the ADHD the OCD\nthere's no amount of therapy that will\nfix this objectively bad thing and so we\ncall this [ __ ] life syndrome right\nbecause it's like it's it's too much to\nhandle the question is can we do\nsomething about it and my belief is yes\nso there is this this construct that we\nhave discovered in mental health called\ndeaths of Despair I think this was\noriginally discovered actually in the UK\nso there were these old fishing villages\nthat used to have very robust economies\nand then once like the fishing industry\nleft the town became like a ghost town\nThere's No economy people started\ndrinking people started committing\nsuicide and as we tunnel down into why\nare people commit killing themselves\nwhat we discovered is that there's a lot\nof systemic factors that are causing\nthis what we find is everyone in this\ntown is an alcoholic and is suicidal not\neveryone but the rates are way higher\nand then in this neighboring town where\nthings are socioeconomically better like\nthe climate is the same the water is the\nsame but like the economic situation is\ndifferent we see way less suicide and\nalcoholic liver disease among other\nthings so systemic and problems have\nsystemic Solutions I 100% believe this\nthis is part of the reason we started\nhealthy gamer in the first place so I I\nwant yall to really think about this why\ndid we start this because I saw a\nsystemic problem I realized no amount of\nlike talking to people in my office is\ngoing to fix what I saw in my office was\nan increasing number of people who did\nnot know how to live life they didn't\nknow how they work and since you don't\nknow how you work you can't figure out\nhow to live life so this is what I want\nyouall to understand you are a living\norganism and the whole point of a living\norganism is that it interacts and is\nshaped by its environment we are in a\nhome ostatic relationship with our\nenvironment we adapt to our environment\nwe shape our environment so it goes both\nways so if it's hot outside I will start\nto sweat if it is cold outside that's\ncalled diaphoresis if it's cold outside\nI will have pyo erection which means I\nwill have Goosebumps and my hair will\nstand on end my physical body adapts to\nthe circumstances around me in order to\ntry to succeed in this scenario so when\nwe say that people with with [ __ ] life\nsyndrome is this [ __ ] life syndrome is\nthis mental illness the answer is both\nmental illness is often times the\nconsequence or the\nadaptation to negative\ncircumstances okay so I'll give you all\nsimple example we consider PTSD a mental\nillness and why is it a mental illness\nbecause it does not allow human beings\nto live their life normally but what we\nalso know about PTSD is that it is an\nadaptation is a mechanism of survival\nthat the organism goes through so as a\nsimple example of this if I've been\ntraumatized in some way my body is on\nhigh alert my heart rate goes up my\nblood pressure goes up I start to think\nmore catastrophically which is not a bug\nit's a feature it's an adaptation when\nthe brain is faced with danger we need\nto focus on the worst case scenarios not\nthe middle of the road scenario the\nproblem is that these adaptations which\nallow us to\nsurvive prevent us from thriving because\nthese two goals are fundamentally\ndifferent so the problem in [ __ ] life\nsyndrome is that the way that you wire\nis not to succeed it is to survive now I\nwant yall to think about the\nimplications of that really think about\nthat for example like I'll give you all\njust a couple of examples so one thing\nthat we develop is something like low\nself-esteem or we talk about this in the\ntrauma guide one of the things that we\nsee in [ __ ] life syndrome is the\ninability to consider the future so if\nwe look at this post and you read it\nthis person is not future oriented they\nare not planning for the future they are\nnot doing steps 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nthey are simply existing and responding\nto the environment they are apathetic\nthey procrastinate and they're not like\nthey're not exerting an influence to\nchange their their situation now people\ncan call this laziness but it's not\nlaziness it's an adaptation so let's\nunderstand this I'll give you all just\none example so when someone grows up in\na deficient environment an environment\nthat does not have stimulation what\nhappens is our if we grow up in an\nenvironment where we are not allowed to\nplan for the future if we grow up in an\nenvironment where our circumstances\ncontrol our future our brain loses sight\nof the ability to plan for the future\nokay so I'll give you all a simple\nexample let's say I'm a kid and I want\nto have a birthday party because all my\nfriends have a birthday party so I go to\nmy mom and my dad and I say hey Mom and\nDad can I have a birthday party this\nweekend with my friends and your mom and\ndad say sure then what happens is if you\nthink about being a seven-year-old you\ncan't plan your own birthday party you\ndon't know how to order cake you don't\nknow how to invite friends you don't\nknow how to do any of that so it is your\nparents responsibility to do all of\nthose things but if your parents if you\nhave a single parent household and your\nparent is working three jobs if you have\nparents who struggle with substance use\nif you have parents who don't know how\nto operationalize their own problems\nbecause they have a history of trauma\nthey don't know how to make your\nbirthday party and so what happens is\nyou have or in the worst case scenario\nyour parents say yeah we can have a\nbirthday party and then the day before\nthe birthday party one of your parents\nis drunk and angry and they arbitrarily\npunish you for nothing that you did\nwrong and they say you don't get a\nbirthday party because you're making too\nmuch noise you don't understand how to\nbe respectful unrespectful kids\ndisrespectful kids don't deserve\nbirthday parties now when you grow up in\nan environment like this what is the\ncost of thinking about the future just\npain you told all your friends hey I'm\ngoing to have a birthday party and what\nhappens your birthday party gets\ncanceled now you're ashamed now you feel\ndisappointed now you feel like your\nexpectations have been let down so what\nwe see on Research from complex PTSD\nespecially is that the capacity for your\nbrain to think about the future requires\nthat when you were a child and you think\nabout the future that is rewarded but if\nthinking about the future leads to a\npunishment leads to expectations that\nget dashed lead to suffering then your\nbrain is like this is a waste of time\nthinking about the future is only\nresults in pain and nothing good ever\ncomes of it so we're going to stop\nthinking about the future then the\nproblem is that these\nadaptations cause future problems\nbecause you don't know how to craft a\nlife that like is fulfilling right so\nthis person may not even know like they\nsay like pursuing a passion I don't know\nhow to pursue a passion so the\nadaptations that we use to survive are\nthe very things that prevent us from\nthriving now here's the really tricky\nthing is it turns out that these\nadaptations that you make will be\ndeterministically bad for you in the\nfuture okay so remember that the\norganism is in homeostasis with the\nenvironment we're trying to survive so\nwe're forming certain kinds of\nadaptations so if we look at some of\nthese adaptations what we find is that\nthese adaptations will become\nproblematic in the future so what we\nknow is that when people have a history\nof trauma and when they suffer from\ndepression which by the way can be an\nappropriate U like almost like an\nadaptation or maladaptation from your\ncircumstances so here's the chain of\nreasoning okay adverse childhood\nexperiences increase the risk of\ndepression so if you've had a [ __ ] life\nyou are more likely to have depression\nonce you add depression into the mix\nthat creates perspective problems so\nthere are multiple the I behind this but\nthey're basically all agree that there's\nsome kind of bias in our mind so we have\nmemory biases this is wild so what we\nknow is that there are memory biases in\ndepression so a memory bias for negative\nmaterial found that individuals\ndiagnosed with depression recalled more\ngeneric or overgeneral memories that\nthan did their non-depressed\ncounterparts okay so this is kind of\nweird but what this means is that people\nwith depression do not remember like\npositive details importantly the\ntendency to elaborate negative emotional\ninformation memory bias for this\ninformation and recall of overgeneral\nmemories maybe associated with other\ncognitive aspects of depression so these\nare the three biases is this mental\nillness or is this [ __ ] life syndrome\nillness is a consequence of two things a\ngenetic predisposition plus an\nenvironmental exposure so there is\nsomething that is part of you plus some\nenvironmental shaping results in\nsomething called a mental illness and\nthis is really consistent with our\nstudies of things like depression and\nadverse childhood experiences so if I\nhave a crappy life my mind starts to get\ndepressed the depression is a\nconsequence of my past but it very\nactively and negatively shapes my future\nso we know that once you have some\nnegative view of yourself it changes the\nway you perceive the world you pay\nattention to more negative stimuli so if\nwe look at this p uh paper what we\nbasically find is that if you're looking\nat a neutral face you will pick up\nnegativity even within neutrality so\nwhat we know about cognitive bias and\ndepression is let's say that I have\nmultiple interactions throughout the day\n25% of my interactions are positive 25%\nof my interactions are negative and 50%\nof my interactions are neutral once I\nhave a cognitive bias from depression\nwhat this means is that I tend to\novergeneralize the positive parts of my\nmemory so the positive parts of my\nmemory become vague and fuzzy the\nnegative parts of my memory are negative\nand then the neutral Parts become\nnegative so now in a life that is 25%\ngood 25% bad and 50% in the middle my\nbrain interprets that this is 75% bad\nand 25% neutral and this is where I know\nit sounds crazy but like the reason that\nI think [ __ ] life syndrome can get\nbetter is because there are three steps\nto this there is circumstances which are\noutside of control create an adaptation\nthis adaptation creates your destiny now\nthis you can't control but this you can\nfix and when you fix this this changes\nso that's what we're going to talk about\ntoday so now the question is how so I'm\ngoing to give you all just a couple of\nreally simple examples of how you can\nchange your thinking and what I see in\npeople who have [ __ ] life syndrome and\npeople who don't so first is when people\ndon't grow up with adverse childhood\nexperiences or in high socioeconomic\nstatus the first thing that's different\nis that people in [ __ ] life syndrome do\nnot think that they can shape their\nfuture if I have [ __ ] life syndrome I\ngrow up in an environment where my\nintentions do not shape my circumstances\nI'm so neglected in my household that my\ndesires become worthless they have no\nbearing on the environment so once our\nbrain realizes that our desire has no\ndifferential impact on the environment\nit decides let's forget about desire\ncompare that to what we see in the worst\ncases as entitlement people who have\nhigh socioeconomic status where the\nworld says hey you don't get to jump to\nthe front of the line and their\ncognitive bias is so robust that they\nsay everyone else needs to move out of\nthe way they believe that they are\nallowed to shape the environment right\nso this is a huge difference and it\nleads to a huge difference in outcomes\nwhat shitlife syndrome teaches you is\nthat what you do does not matter this is\nthe lesson that you learn and once you\nlearn this lesson then your future is\ndetermined the beautiful thing is that\nyou can unlearn this lesson and when you\nunlearn this lesson and you discover\nthat you can shape your circumstances\nthen a lot of things will go well so I\nwant you all to just think about two\npeople when faced with some set of\nchallenges one person believes that if\nI'm challenged there's nothing I can do\nabout it and the other person believes\nthere is something I can do about it I\ndon't have to take it laying down what\nimpact do you think those two attitudes\nwill have on these people's lives so\nthat's the first adaptation is simply\nbelieving that you can affect your your\nlife or you can't can I shape my\ncircumstances or can I not shape my\ncircumstances and I'm not saying that\npeople are are stupid for believing they\ncan't shape their circumstances remember\nthat if they believe this they believe\nthis for a good reason it is because\nthey haven't shaped their circumstances\nso this is the other thing about the\nhuman organism the human organism learns\nfrom the past and it carries that\nforward into the future now the problem\nis that sometimes the learning that we\ndo is maladaptive so I'll give you all a\ngreat example of this so I don't know if\nyall played Dark Souls 1 but in Dark\nSouls 1 there's this like cheat kind of\nthing that you can do there's this\ndragon and you can shoot the dragon in\nthe tail and if you shoot it enough\ntimes the tail falls off and you get\nthis thing called The Dragon Tail sword\nnow the dragon tail sword is op you can\none-hot a lot of enemies so when I first\nplayed Dark Souls 1 I got the dragon\ntail sword cuz someone told me about it\nand I was one-shotting all the enemies\nand then I gave up on the game because\nit became too hard cuz at some point the\ndragon tail sword stops scaling and you\ncan't One-Shot anything so later a\nfriend I was talking to a friend of mine\nand he said you know what the dragon\ntail sword is the biggest scam in the\ngame it is the biggest Noob trap in the\ngame no wonder you gave up and I said\nwhat do you mean and he said if you get\nthe dragon tail sword you never learn\nhow to play the game you don't need to\nroll you don't need to Parry you don't\nneed to like Zone people out you don't\nneed to pay attention it is such a\ncrutch so the way that I learned to play\nthe game based on my circumstances set\nme up for a failure in the future now if\nI ask you okay so if I play with the\nDragon taale Sword does this mean that I\ncan't beat Dark Souls of course not but\nit requires you to adapt your general\napproach to the game and this is exactly\nwhat [ __ ] life syndrome is like it's\nvery unlikely that I'll ever be\nFinancial independent and it's unlikely\nI'll ever find something interesting\ninteresting enough I deem worthy worth\npursuing these real realizations make me\njump to a conclusion so the way that I\nwould like you know I've had patients\nlike this before and there there are\nthings that you can do to change this\nright so what I'd say is oh that's so\ninteresting so unlikely Oliver find\nsomething interesting enough I deem\nworth pursuing so then I would talk to\nthis person this like What I've Done\nRight is I'd ask him what is the nature\nof Interest what determines how\ninterested you are is there anything\nthat you can do to change your level of\ninterest in something realizations are\nalone alone or enough to make me\napathetic okay so let's talk about being\napathetic if you are apathetic does that\nmean that you cannot act what is the\nrelationship between feeling like acting\nand being able to act so as you start to\ndig into a lot of these nuances you\nstart to see a lot of positive change\nbecause it's this stuff that is truly\ndeterministic but my point is that the\nadaptations to survive will often times\nkeep you from thriving and so you need\nto unlearn those adaptations and one of\nthe most most important things that I\nwant y'all to pay attention to is how\nquickly your mind jumps to a conclusion\nI can bet y'all money because I've seen\nthis before anytime I talk about super\nchallenging things what inevitably\nhappens is someone will respond Dr K was\nsaying this and they will jump to some\nkind of conclusion are they saying I'm\nscrewed so think about even how you were\nreceiving what I'm saying are you\nlooking at it critically or is some part\nof your mind jumping up and saying this\nis wrong there are a thousand different\nthings that mind will jump to so quickly\nand look at where all of those thoughts\ngo all of th those thoughts result in\ninaction that's the problem look at\nwhere your mind goes this is a paper\nthat shows that when you have a low\nperceived control when you don't believe\nyou are in control of your of your life\nthat creates stressful situations so our\nperception and results indicated that\ndependent interpersonal stress mediated\nthe relationship between low perceived\ncontrol and higher levels of social\nanxiety in in girls conversely boys who\nexhibited low perceived control\nexperienced a greater occurrence of\ndependent interpersonal stressors so\nthis is really important to understand\nwhen you believe you are out of control\nthis creates stressors what this paper\nreally shows us is that it is the\nperception of low perceived control that\ncreates problems in your life and I'll\ngive give you all an example if you're\nskeptical of that so let's say that I\nhave a family emergency and I have a big\npdue in one week and I need to email my\nprofessor to let them know there's a\nvoice in my head that says hey let your\nprofessor know that you have a family\nemergency but then what happens is I\nprocrastinate or I think maybe I can get\nthe paper done or maybe I think I don't\nwant I don't I don't feel good it makes\nme feel ashamed to ask for an extension\nthere is a right action to take in this\nsituation but you procrastinate\nin doing the right action and then what\nhappens is a week goes by you haven't\nworked on the paper now it's the night\nbefore the paper is due and now you\nbegin to question yourself because\nyou're like now if I ask like if I tell\nthem oh there was a family emergency a\nweek ago but now I'm asking for an\nextension on the paper the professor\nisn't going to believe me they're going\nto think I'm making it up I really\nshould have done it a week ago this\nanxiety creates a negative situation if\nyou had not been anxious in the first\nplace you would have sent the email\nyou'd have said hey I have a family\nemergency I'm not quite sure if I'm\ngoing to be able to get to the paper\njust wanted to let you know we all know\nthat is the right answer and if you look\nat your life you're [ __ ]\nprocrastinating you know what the right\nanswer is the problem is you can't do it\nand it is not that your life is randomly\nout of control it's because you [ __ ]\nneglect it you procrastinate that\ncreates your situations we see this so\nmuch in our life I'm not saying bad\nthings don't happen to us absolutely\nthere's bad RNG and now we get to really\nthe Crocs of [ __ ] life syndrome which is\nthat in this life there are things that\nare outside of your control and things\nthat are inside of your control and the\nbeautiful thing about the homeostatic\nnature of life this isn't just humans\nthis like even amoeba when amoeba detect\nthe wrong chemical gradient they will\nmove in the opposite direction they are\nresponding to life and the problem that\nwe have in [ __ ] life syndrome is that we\ncannot respond appropriately to life I\nneed to send my professor an email\nasking for an extension that is what the\nsituation demands there is a answer here\nwhat is it that gets in the way of me\nengaging the right answer this is what\ngets in the way interpretation bias\nattentional bias oh my God my professor\nwill think I'm pathetic oh my God he'll\ndislike me oh my God this hasn't worked\nin the past I've asked for help in the\npast and it hasn't worked there is a\nmemory bias there but it doesn't mean\nthat it's all false so another big thing\nthat people with [ __ ] life syndrome\nlearn and think about how devastating\nthis is to learn asking for help doesn't\nhelp two kinds of people in life those\nwho ask for help and those who don't and\nwhy does someone stop asking for help\nbecause they learn it's useless all of\nthe thoughts and beliefs that you have\nin your mind if you have [ __ ] life\nsyndrome are warranted they are\nJustified that does not make them right\nthis is a very important Nuance to\nunderstand you can have a lot of logic\nfor believing what you believe but that\ndoes it the construct that you have in\nyour brain does not dictate what happens\nin the future so the first is even the\nbelie belief of self-determination the\nsecond is jumping to conclusions the\nthird is not asking for help and the\nfourth thing that we also talked about\nis the loss of future orientation this\none is very hard so if you look at some\npeople like you look at some of these\npeople and they're like living a life\nand part of living their life is like a\ndimension of future this is so simple\nthat it's like I don't even know if this\nmakes sense you look at some people and\nthey're doing [ __ ] in order you guys\nknow what I mean they're like today I'm\ngoing to I'm training for a marathon in\nAugust of 2025 and I look at these\npeople I'm like what the [ __ ] man I'm\ntrying to get through the week and\nthey're like yeah I have a bucket list\nI'm like bro I'm trying to survive the\nday I'm just waiting for the next DOTA\npatch to drop how do you have a bucket\nlike I don't have a bucket list someone\nrecently asked me and they were like\nwhat have you done on your bucket list\nand I'm like I don't have a bucket list\nand then I was like kind of like is this\nbecause I'm yogic detached from my life\nand I'm like content with my life or is\nit because like when I was a [ __ ]\ndegenerate gamer and I was just like\n[ __ ] waking up every day and playing\nvideo games for 20 hours a day I stopped\nthinking about the future I think it's a\nlittle bit of both the concept that I\ncan accomplish goals in my life is\nforeign to me this idea and think about\nthe hubris of having a bucket list this\nidea that if you set these random ass\ngoals that are so far away that you will\none day achieve even a portion of them\nlike what the [ __ ] do you all get how\nthat's a their brain is is working\ndifferently it is thinking about the\nfuture Dimension as something that can\nbe realized and literally half of the\npeople that I work with and I mean half\nokay I think this a pretty good estimate\nbecause I work with losers and I work\nwith winners and the winners I work with\nhave all these goals and the losers that\nI work with don't have any and it's like\ntheir mind operates in a different way\nthis too relates to trauma so we know\nthat once again surviving in a prisoner\nof war camp thinking about the future is\na waste of time so our brain on learns\nthinking about the future so when we\nhave [ __ ] life syndrome is it bad\nabsolutely is the deck stacked against\nyou absolutely but there is hope because\nwhat is really holding you back is not\nthe circumstances that is what has held\nyou back that I completely agree and\nthis is a Nuance that's important but\nwhat holds you back what's held you back\nfor the last 5 years is different from\nwhat will hold you back from the next 5\nyears and even remember there's no\nfuture orientation so even the capacity\nto realize that is impaired that the\nfuture will be different from the past\nwhen all you are trying to do is survive\nevery day is the same and we see this so\nmuch it's so sad in our community I'm\nproud of this in a weird way because\nthis is a place where I want youall to\ncome and feel this it's okay to feel\nthis we don't want to we don't want you\nto feel ashamed of feeling this way but\npeople come here and they're like I'm\nexisting I'm not living so that's what\nwe want to help you with and the really\nsad thing about this is not fair forget\nabout Fair we can get caught up in Fair\nas much as you want to I don't know\nabout Fair it makes me sad I don't think\nlife is fair right I can't I haven't\nseen that I mean I decided on this my\nfirst rotation as a third-year medical\nstudent I was one week in the third year\nand I decided fairness is [ __ ] all you\nhave to do is spend one week in the\nPediatric ICU and you'll realize\nfairness is a waste of I don't even know\nhow this works there's a six-year-old\nkid with glioblastoma multi fori\nactually not a six-year-old patient with\nGast multiform me was a couple years\nlater that happens closer between 25 and\n45 years old with a kid it was like a\nblood cancer leukemia or something right\nyou look at this and you're like how\nthere's no fairness here this is dumb\nright and I'm thinking about this\npatient with gastor well they just do\ngreat dude had kids was happily married\nand it's like boom one day you got a\nterminal cancer you've got three months\nto live like that's how gastor gasta\nmultiform he hits you it's a rapidly\nProgressive very debilitating doesn't\nhappen when you're old happens when\nyou're young when you're in the prime of\nyour life there's no fairness here but\nthere doesn't need to be fairness that's\nthe crazy thing right there is what you\ncan control and when you're looking for\nthe world to fix your problems like I\njust have lost faith in the world like I\nhate to say it and now this is where you\nall have to be careful right because\nyour negative bias if you're depressed\nwill be Dr K has lost faith in the world\nwhich means I should give up no I'm\nsaying the exact opposite I've lost\nfaith in the world but I've not lost\nfaith in you there's a huge difference I\ndon't count on the World to fix anything\nthat's why I'm here because I saw a\ngeneration of people whose lives were\ngetting screwed and I was like I I don't\nknow if anyone's going to fix that in\nfact I went to people so many smart\npeople so many compassionate people so\nmany dedicated people who are doing\nnothing about technology addiction who\ndoing nothing to address Rising suicide\nrates Rising unemployment rates in young\nmen who are doing nothing to address\ntoxicity towards women online stalking\nand dickpics I have no faith in the\nworld but I have faith in you because\nthis is all we can control so if you see\nsome problem in the world there's once\nagain two options right either I can't\ndo something about this or I can try\nthat's it those are your two options and\nthat's why I think [ __ ] life syndrome\ncan get better because I have worked\nwith people to address these cognitive\nbiases and we have moved from there is\nnothing I can do about this to I can try\nand the really sad thing is that even\nwhen circumstances improve it doesn't\nalways lead to better outcomes so if you\nlook at women who are abused in the\nhousehold they're more likely to be\nabused in romantic relationships I think\nsomething like one in Six Women will be\nsexually or raped actually so even\nsexual assault could be higher intimate\npartner violence 30.7% of women with\nADHD are likely to have intimate partner\nviolence this is a staggering number and\nif you look at this like this is bad and\nthe problem why does this happen why is\nit that if you were abused once you are\nlikely to be abused again is it because\nthe world is rigged against you no this\nis the really crazy thing it is because\nof the way that you engage in\nrelationships see when you have a high\nself-esteem and someone mistreats you\nyou leave the relationship but but when\nyou are dependent when your goal is\nsurvival not thriving then you are\nwilling to tolerate abuse it's a\ncompletely different way of looking at\nthe world what's the goal and in [ __ ]\nlife syndrome the goal is survival not\nthriving that creates all kinds of\nproblems it keeps our life in this weird\nlimbo zone of not actually ending right\nlike we're struggling along we're kind\nof chugging along but we're never\ngetting anywhere we're not quitting the\nrace because once again I had a\nbrilliant Pati who who taught me this\nwho tried to commit suicide seven times\nand I was like do I need to be worried\nabout you and he's like no I was like\nhelp me understand brilliant guy and he\nsaid well the seventh time I realized\nthat like some part of me does not want\nto die I've been trying to kill myself\nand something within me is fighting for\nlife so I'm going to stop fighting that\nthing and that's all it took for him no\nmore suicidality right so there's\nsomething within you even if you feel\nlike everything is like lost and\nwhatever there is something within you\nthat strives we look at this post and\nhere I am [ __ ] bashing this person\nright I'm saying oh look at this\ncognitive bias but I want youall to\npoint out pay attention to something\nthis person posted this person is trying\nto change this person is saying my my\nlife is unsolvable nothing's ever going\nto end up anywhere and they're not\ntaking it laying down this is a huge\nprognostic sign in the right direction\nthis is a win the post may be full of\nnegativity but the fact that there is a\npost is a win and this is our bias right\nso now what I want youall to do is if\nyou're listening to this if you've been\nlistening to this did you consider\nconsider that and if the answer is no\nwhy not this is bias so [ __ ] life\nsyndrome is not deterministic I do not\nbelieve that is the deck stacked against\nyou absolutely can we count on the World\nto fix things I don't know big question\nmark the world isn't all bad by the way\nit's a lot of good in the world right\nbut what I have faith in is y'all I have\nfaith that if you understand the way\nthat you function if you understand what\nyour biases are if you understand the\nway that you view the world determine\nsome of the way that the world is then\nyou can change your life can change\n[Music]"
