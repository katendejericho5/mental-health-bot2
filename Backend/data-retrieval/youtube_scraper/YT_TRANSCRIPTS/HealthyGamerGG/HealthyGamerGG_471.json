stream my name is Olive\nkenoja just a reminder that although I'm\na psychiatrist nothing we discussed on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly\num\nif you all have a cons a concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional so hello and welcome to an\nevening healthy gamer GG stream\na couple of quick announcements before\nwe get to talking about our guests today\nso the first thing is um we're gonna be\nover at the Streamys this weekend so we\nrecently discovered that we were\nnominated for a streamy in the health\nand wellness category and we're grateful\nto everyone who thinks that we're doing\nsomething good on the internet we are\nhere to try to do good things on the\ninternet and we are grateful to everyone\nwho has helped us make this possible the\nnomination is an honor enough I looked\nat other people in the category I really\ndon't think that we are the best health\nand wellness streamer out there uh\nthey're just some amazing content\ncreators out there and it's an honor to\njust be in that same category\nat the same time\num you know we'll see\nwhat what happens with that and it's\nawesome to be considered\nso\nbefore we jump into our interview which\nshould be starting in just a minute or\ntwo\num first of all I'd like to remind you\nall a little bit about why we do what we\ndo so we're here\nto talk to people about their\nexperiences of life and sometimes the\npeople that we talk to are some more\nsympathetic or less sympathetic and\nthat's okay right so one of the key\nthings that I've learned as a\npsychiatrist is that communication and\ndialogue is like really really important\nfor\nfacilitating growth and change in\nanyone's life and that's what really\nwe're really here to do we're here to\nwe've talked to\nand had conversations with people who\nhave been convicted of crimes we've\ntalked to people who are very\npolitically oriented we've talked to\npeople who are parts of minority\ncommunities we've talked to people who\nare parts of majority communities we are\nhere to have conversations\nand the reason I think that's important\nis because once again based primarily on\nmy clinical experience but also like you\nknow years of studying to become a monk\none of the biggest things that I\nrealized is we're all human\nand one of the things that I choose to\nbelieve which probably is going to be\nwrong at some point is that generally\nspeaking as humans the more we\nunderstand each other's perspectives and\nthe more that we try to have compassion\ntowards one another the better off in\ngeneral we're going to be\nnow I'm sure that at some point I will\nmeet someone or have a conversation with\nsomeone that disproves that and then I\nwill eat my words but up until that\npoint that day hasn't come yet I'm sure\nit'll come at some point and so the main\nthing that I ask of y'all is to remember\na couple of things the first is that\ncoming on stream isn't necessarily Easy\nLike A lot of times it's fun and easy\nbut not necessarily\num people come on here because they want\nto come on here generally speak speaking\npeople come on here to try to help other\npeople that is the number one reason why\npeople come onto this stream by sharing\ntheir experience of life we hope to\nlearn something about them and we hope\nto also learn something about ourselves\nthat's what we're about and irrespective\nof who we talk to\nI think that that Still Remains true so\nI I really ask you all to try to treat\nall of our guests with respect and\ncompassion it doesn't mean that you you\ndon't have to like what they say you're\nallowed to disagree you're allowed to\nform judgments that's actually okay but\nwe ask you all to try to remember that\nthat coming on here is not necessarily\neasy and that people choose to do this\nand that we're grateful to every single\nguest that we've had on stream for\nhelping us understand a little bit more\nabout what it means to be human and I\ndon't consider this interview to be any\ndifferent\nany questions about that\nokay\nlet's hop into the interview\nalrighty\num\nlet's do Discord oh oh here we go\nwhat's up dude\nhey what's up um doctor uh give me one\nsecond to try to configure this I'm a\nlittle bit I'm a tiny bit of a boomer\nso you gotta bear with me for one second\nmy dude oh good I got you if you need\nhelp um miraculous\nhello\nhow you doing I'm doing well man how are\nyou\nI'm good I'm good man I honestly um I I\nI saw uh well honestly I'm not gonna be\nfake about it I haven't seen anything\nthat you've done or anything but my\nmoderators are telling me to how uh\nthey're gonna plan this for me so I\ndon't really know what we're doing today\nbut they just said it's gonna be good\nokay so\num to be complete that's first of all\ndude I love your honesty man I'm super\nhyped about this\num so let me just explain a couple of\nthings uh\nsimilar first of all what do you go by\nAiden you can just call me Aiden Aiden\nokay\num so let me explain to you a little bit\nabout what we usually do\num I'm super excited I similarly I know\nit sounds kind of weird I've seen very\nlittle of your stuff I know you have a\nreputation on the internet I'm not even\nsure exactly what it is but I try very\nhard not to watch people's content\num just because anytime I have a\nconversation with them I don't want to\nbe biased by a character on the screen\nyeah yeah so let me explain to you what\nwe do I'm a psychiatrist but one thing\nthat it's important for you to\nunderstand is that this is not therapy\nso I'm not going to be diagnosing you\ntreating you prescribing any medications\nis that clear\nyes sir so what I try to do with people\num I started streaming to have\nconversations with people just to\nunderstand a little bit about what their\nlife is like\num that's basically it sometimes we'll\ntalk about stuff which is totally cool\nlike sometimes we can talk about\nparticular topics that may be\ninteresting to you or interesting to me\nbut generally speaking we're here\nbecause I believe that\nthe internet is a judgmental space and\nthat having a conversation with a human\nbeing can help us learn more about each\nother and learn more about ourselves\nsometimes and I'm happy to go into more\nof my background if you want people have\nquestions about something related to\nscience health or mental health and\nwhile I don't provide medical advice\nlike for example I think you have\nCrohn's disease and you should start on\na biologic agent I won't do that I'm\nhappy to guide People based on my varied\nexperience and the kind of work that\nI've done if people are interested in\nlearning about things and that's\nreciprocal so if you want to teach me\nabout stuff too and it's kind of where\nthe conversation goes like that's\ntotally fine okay how does that sound\nyeah it sounds great man that sounds\ngreat\num everything you're saying is it's\nperfect it's music to my ears you know\nwhat I'm saying awesome dude so can you\ntell me a little bit about yourself\nyeah my name is Aiden I uh a lot of\npeople that don't know me they call me\nAiden Ross you know what I'm saying but\nI mean that is my name but I like to be\ncalled Aiden\num I'm a streamer I've been streaming\nfor a few years now I've been streaming\nfor\nI would say honestly four years coming\nup on five you know what I'm saying\num let's see I I enjoy streaming I used\nto enjoy it way more when my Hunger was\nwas more you know what I'm saying was\nwhen I was more hungry okay but I feel\nlike I've really kind of not beat the\nstreaming game but kind of like\naccomplished what I my goals that I set\nbeforehand so now it's harder for me to\nkind of make and appreciate streaming\nmore sometimes\num but lately I've been doing some new\nstuff like I've been switching it up and\nI've actually been enjoying it lately as\nof like this month particularly so you\nknow it's been really good okay um can\nyou tell me a little bit about why how\ndid you become a streamer man\nso I've always kind of like played video\ngames and throughout my whole life like\neveryone I used to like kind of be\nbuddies with back in the day when I used\nto play like games like I used to play\nmy first game I ever streamed was NBA\n2K14 but I had like no viewers but I\njust streamed it because which was like\nwhen I was 13 years old I would just\nstream it because like I was 13 like\nliterally just cursing and just playing\nand stuff like that and just kind of\nlike making content my boy was like\nyou'd actually be like a really good\nstreamer and I would like see other\nstreamers that I would I would watch and\nI'd be like all right you know I'm gonna\nget ahead of the game and I did it and I\njust I have ADHD man I just move a lot I\nspeak a lot I just my mind is just\nnot normal I feel like sometimes and uh\nI don't know I just\nI just really really like got into it\nfrom having like passion for for NBA 2K\nand then just talking a lot and while\nI'm playing and stuff and entertaining\nokay so it sounds like you liked NBA 2K\na lot you so you started streaming when\nyou were like 13. yeah but I got no\nviewers and I quit for like a three four\nyears and then I started up up again\nlike when I was like 17 18ish and what\num so if you've been streaming for four\nor five years that means you're like 22\n23. I'm 22. yeah I'm about to be 23 in\nOctober okay\num and so the second time around what\nkind of got you into it\nsecond time around I I was a senior in\nhigh school and I like knew that like I\ndidn't want to go to college man like I\nhad I had family members like tell me\nlike you're gonna be homeless you're\ngonna be like if you don't go to college\nlike if you don't become a lawyer and\nlike they want to become like a lawyer\nlike something that like somebody that\nwas like suit and tie super professional\nclassy and I just knew it wasn't for me\nlike I was just always different I was\nalways like super to myself in school I\njust never really wanted to do what\neveryone wanted me to do I always wanted\nto go like around the like I always want\nto do the opposite like if you like if\nif a human being in my life that wasn't\nmy father my mother told me to do\nsomething I just went through the\nopposite of it just should be like haha\nlike I I I I I you told me that and\nI and I did the opposite just because I\ncould do it okay wow yeah it sounds like\num\nyou you really like had\na lot of it sounds like family members\nwere almost like trying to scare you\ninto going to college\nuh I got a lot of pressure because I I I\ncame from I come from a fan from a\nfamily that nobody ever went to school\nlike the only people that have been\nthrough I have sisters the only person\nthat uh was in school or my wasn't like\nmy one aunts and then uh my mom like my\ndad didn't even go to college like it's\nlike nobody in my my whole family went\nto once I went to college like nobody\nbecause they never went to college why\nwould they pressure you so much into\ngoing to college because at the point of\nmy life when I was a senior about to\nlike make what I wanted to do we weren't\nreally financially stable there was a\nlot of problems in my home so like they\nwere just like well if you go to college\nyou have a good head under shoulders and\nstuff and uh I think it'll be different\nbecause it'd be switching up like the\nfamily tradition type of thing type of\nthing you know wow so it sounds like\nthings were a little bit rough and and\nthey sounds like they they were\nrecommending stuff based on what they\nthought was good for you my senior year\nit was really hard for my family I was I\nwas super skinny I didn't eat every\nnight people think that like I had it\nvery easy my whole life we were\nfinancially stable medium class\nup until about senior year it got really\nhard for us\num and you know it's I would vote\nliterally some nights without eating\ndinner like I would just have like a bag\nof chips for dinner and stuff yeah why\nis that\nbecause\nthere was a point in time where\nsomething happened\nwhere everyone like in my family my mom\ndidn't work she was she was she does\nyoga and stuff like she's like an\ninstructor now she does like yoga for\nfun wow I retired my mom like a couple\nyears ago\num but she just does yoga and chocolatey\nfor fun I'm sorry what does that mean\nyou retired your mom a couple of years\nago\nlike she would work with like mentally\ndisabled people and like help them out\nlike people like autism and like down\nsyndrome and bipolar she would like help\nthem and stuff and like not a nurse but\nkind of just like somebody who would\njust like be really like like an a\nbasically yeah so I retired my mom from\ndoing that and um she just does yoga for\nfun because it's like she's like very\ninto Namaste like peaceful stuff and\nstuff so she's super at peace and\nspiritual\num but what I mean by retirement is I\njust basically like was like Hey Mom Dad\nyou guys never have to worry about money\never again like you guys are good I got\nthem a house I paid it off everything\ngot them cars so that's that's my Empire\ntime yeah that's impressive man\nyeah that's the best feeling I've ever\nout of everything I've ever done in my\ncareer out of anything I've ever spent\nthat's the best thing I think anyone\ncould ever say especially me like that\nlike any anybody that's in a position\nlike I am I I pray that you guys all get\nin this position where you can retire\nyour parents the best feeling in the\nworld was nothing nothing like it sounds\nlike you're a good son Aiden\nI'll try to be I try to be\num maybe if we if we get to know each\nother a little bit better we can hear\nabout some of your less good things that\nyou do from as being a son but yeah\num so wow so so that sounds like you're\nyou're kind of very self-driven can you\nhelp me understand a little bit about\nthis kind of like if someone tells you\nthat you shouldn't do something you kind\nof like you're like screw you I'm gonna\ndo it anyway\nwell my mind has always been different\nlike I tell you when I was like four\nyears old five years old I've always\ngrew up different when I was five or six\nin first grade I was wearing pull-ups\nthough I was wearing diapers because I\nwas I was a late bloomer to where I was\npeeing and wetting the bed until I was\nlike six or seven years old\nand I've always seem to be rebellious\nand I've always seemed to be doing\nthings that like\nit late and just what other kids weren't\ndoing I would have weird ticks growing\nup I was just super like I wouldn't say\nI was like socially awkward I was very\nsocial I made a lot of friends I moved\naround a lot I moved I've had like four\ndifferent I moved to like four different\ntowns kind of three different towns and\nmaking new friends\nI've always been very social I've always\nfit in with people and stuff I've never\nhad a hard time doing that but I would\njust say growing up listening to people\nI was very I just I was I guess you\ncould say rebellious in a way not in a\nbad way just in a way if somebody was\nlike Hey Aiden do that and this I would\ndo it my own way like I'd like to just\nfigure it out my own like for example I\nhad to learn this a lot but I've had\nmany\nthings in my life where I messed up\nwhere people are like eight and like\ndon't do this like Aiden don't jump on\nthe table for example but I would have\nto do it to learn the consequence I\nwould just like to see what would happen\nI would I would want to see it people in\nlife that can catch it and like if like\nfor example doctor if you were like\nAiden if you jump on a table you're\ngonna get hurt\nthey I think those people that can\nactually just listen just not do it\nthose are lucky people there's a lot of\npeople that are that that that genuinely\nlike they have to actually go through it\nfigure it out for themselves and I was\none of those kids that just like wanted\nto just know what it was like so I'm\nsort of hearing that not necessarily\nthat you were like rebellious but that\nyou just needed to learn things from\nyourselves for yourself\nyeah but again like I just think it's\nnot fair I get it I get why but I just\nthink it's not fair for family members\nanybody to be pressuring their children\nto be doing something like I think\ncollege is extremely outdated for\nexample I'm not bashed in college I\nthink college is necessary for a lot of\npeople I think if you know what you want\nto do if I and if I know I want what I'm\npassionate about if I want to be a\nlawyer a doctor if I want to do\nsomething I think college is worth it\nfor me if I know what I'm doing if I\nthink if people are going into college\nwithout any train of thought what they\nwant to do\nlike any like if for example if I'm like\nI want a career in business go to\ncollege or business if you if you don't\nknow what it is yet just go to college\nfor business you know you want to major\nin business but if you don't know what\nyou want to do what's the point that's\nmy opinion I'd recommend try finding a\nway to make money stock up you know what\nI mean and and figure it out then I just\nthink being pressured and forced into\ndoing that and that's what I had my\nsenior year like I was already being\ntold my family members you need to be an\naccountant\nyou know what I mean you need to be an\naccount you need to be a lawyer you know\nwhat I mean I'm like I don't even know\nwhat I want to do it's my life you know\nand I'm at an age where I just want to\nknow I'm at an age where I just wanna\nI wanna figure it out my own when I was\n18 I just wanted to figure out my own\nyeah and and so what's it like to be\nunder that pressure\num I think I felt a lot of pressure\nbecause at this point my sisters weren't\nreally doing anything no offense them I\nlove them I they're doing they're doing\ntheir own things now but I just think\nI I was really\ngoing through it because I feel like\neverything was crumbling in my family\nnobody was really you know what I'm\nsaying doing it man yeah and I just felt\nlike I was in a way The Golden Child I\nhad to resurrect and help my my parents\nout and find a way so I had just yeah so\nI'm almost hearing that like the\npressure you were under was not just\nabout your own life it's sort of like\nthey were putting all their eggs in your\nbasket yeah I would say so I would say\nlike I I was kind of like I felt\npressure from everybody because I I had\nI had to succeed and if I didn't succeed\nthat I was gonna feel like a failure\nprobably like I don't know and honestly\nI still have this pressure to this day I\nknow we're against that later but the\npressure it's never went away I've had\nit ever since I was a senior what do you\nmean we're going to get into that later\nhelp me understand that well we're\nstarting you're you we're talking right\nnow about like before all this which is\ngood and I wanna I wanna stand this for\na little bit if you have any more topics\nor questions to talk about because I'm\nsaying I still have this pressure to\nthis day okay\nof like basically like carrying my\nfamily tree if that makes sense it's\nweird I'll get into it I don't mean it\nanytime like egotistical way or anything\nlike that but I'm not I'm not getting\nany ego from you\nokay you want to talk about it now\nI'm saying like was there not because I\nknow we're talking about like the\nbeginning like before all this like do\nyou want to skip right into that I don't\ncare I don't care what we do I mean I\nhave a I have like a thousand questions\nfor you but sure maybe we can get into a\nlittle bit later\nokay so you mentioned that you were a\nhunger so you you said that you said a\ncouple times that your mind has always\nbeen different like what else have you\nnoticed\nevery single charm I've ever had in my\nlife I've always put it away and stored\nit and I never dealt with it like I\nwould I've only cried a few times in my\nlife I've cried before and and sometimes\nit hits me\nbut like ice cry a lot when I was a kid\nbut like every time I have trauma I put\nit in my back of my brain I'm very\ndesensitized my brain is very\ndesensitized you know what I'm saying\nit's like I almost\nit's just like\nhow do I put this my brain works really\nweird like I don't feel feeling\nsometimes because I'm I'm not soulless I\nhave a soul and whenever I like\ndisconnect myself I feel things and I\nand I can feel love and I can feel\npassion I can feel stuff whenever you\ndisconnect yourself you feel things\ndisconnect from the internet mainly like\ngo go basically like like go somewhere\nokay you know what I'm saying yeah get\naway from all of this get away from\neverything take a little break go travel\nsomewhere without having to work take\ntime off of streaming it really helps me\nfind myself again connect myself to\nreality\num but um where where was I sorry oh the\ndesensitization of my brain that's my\nbiggest issue I have today it's like\nit's super hard for me to sometimes feel\nthings\nand and and and and and and and\njust kind of like\num\nI don't know it's almost like I'm\nemotionless and like I feel like I beat\nthe game\nwhat do you mean by beat the game\nwhat's my name\nwhen I was when I was coming in to like\nyou know entering the streaming game\nI had goals in the back of my head and\nthe goals in the back of my head were\nset your parents up for Life put some\nmoney in your bank account meet some of\nyour Heroes and idols\nand you did it\nand the excitement and hunger I had when\nconquering this like the grind part the\ncrime aspect\nwas honestly\nI couldn't realize it but when I was\ngrinding that was the that was like the\nthe peak feeling of me when I was\naccomplishing all this stuff I've talked\nto a lot of the people that I've looked\nup to throughout my life and I met them\nand I've had conversations with them and\nI got this and I got that and I did that\nand I did this and\nI just feel like I've kind of already\nconquered a lot of things like at a\nreally young age\nsure and what does it feel like to\nconquer things at a young age\nlike I beat the game\nand how does that feel\nI don't know I I honestly man it's\nreally it's up because honestly\nlike that's what drives me crazy\nsometimes like what do I what what do I\nwhat do I do now like what what it what\ndo I do\nyou know what I mean sure\noh and I'm hearing that you really\nalmost enjoyed grinding\nof course when I was in the grind and I\nhave a hunger and I was\nboom boom boom getting all my my goals\nand results and stuff it's like\nthat was everything to me like that\nwas like that was you could see the\nhunger the hunger right now that I had\nwhen I I'm sorry I'll never have that\nhunger again it's true\nthat's scary well I think I don't\nbelieve I will I wish I wish I wish I\nwould but I just\nI don't think that hunger exists anymore\nlike I'm hungry other ways like now\nsometimes when I when I when I when I\nwhen I want to make like amazing content\nlike I wanna I wanna do new things I\njust think about my community and what\ngot me here today like my community has\nbeen here through the shitty moments the\ngood moments the good concept the bad\ncontent it's like now all I care about\nis just doing for that my core I\ndon't care about anything else but my\ncore I want to make good content for my\ncore because my core has been here\nthrough everything for me so it sounds\nlike you had some goals that were and\nyou know let me know if this word rubs\nyou the wrong way a little bit more\nselfish before\ndefinitely no no no no no my main set\ngoal was to just get rich take care of\nmy family and have some money to put\naside for me and that was it\nyeah so I would say my goal is never\nselfish like once once I my first my\nfirst purchase was a Lamborghini at 19 I\nthink but like you're right I guess you\nare right my first\nmy first goal what yeah I would say was\nselfish yeah and I mean I I was thinking\nabout a better word you know because I\nthink it's like okay to have selfish\ngoals like you know like it's okay to\nwant stuff from Life yeah I I I didn't\nmean it to be derogatory that's why I\nwas like I couldn't I just couldn't find\na better word I think I think sorry I\ndidn't mean\nI think when you're in Grind Mode like\nanyone that's grinding towards something\nlike I don't really know too much about\nyou but\nlike when you're grinding for like let's\njust say what you you went to Harvard\nright sure when you were grinding to get\nto Harvard when I was grounded to become\na streamer you kind of have to be\nselfish because like let's just say like\nlike in a way in a way like you're\ngrinding to like to you in a selfish way\nlike where you have to just do\nyou basically\nbefore you can really Aid and take care\nof others you know what I'm saying like\nyeah I I think that's a very very\nreasonable way to look at things\num interestingly enough I would say in\nmy case it was sort of the opposite\nthere was a time in my life where I was\ngrinding to get into Harvard and I was\nnowhere near and then there was a time\nin my life where I gave that up and\nwasn't interested in being the best or\naccomplishing anything really\num and paradoxically that's what ended\nup getting me there but\nyou know I I think that what you're\nsaying makes perfect sense\num\nand so I'm kind of curious like when you\nwere grinding and accomplishing stuff\nwhen you got it sounds like you got a\nLamborghini at the age of 19 which is\nlike that's rare man\nwant it's like below one it's like well\nlike point something percent of just\ndoing that there's people that don't\neven have houses and food bro\nand I'm over here buying a Lamborghini\nat 19 years old you go what I'm saying\nlike it's like super desensitizing\nwhat's what's desensitizing about it\nI think in general at 19 having a load\nof money and not knowing what to do with\nit never being taught what to do with\nmoney never being taught how to use it\nhow to utilize it\nand I'm 19 I buy a Lamborghini it's like\nit doesn't make sense I don't even have\na house yet I don't even have my parents\naren't even good yet I just think it's\nsuper detent sizing making money to buy\na a Lamborghini\nat 19 I just think having a lot of money\nwould not know what to do with it at 19\nis crazy you know what I mean so I I\nthink there's something really\nthat sounds like an important Discovery\nbut I don't understand it so how does\nbuying a Lamborghini at 19 how does that\nconnect to desensitizing can you help me\nunderstand that\num\nI think you're on to something I just\ndon't\nyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think what\nI'm trying to say is like\nmaybe it's the long word I'm using\nlike\nI don't think so man\nEtsy sense how's he buying a Lamborghini\n19 in general because it's like you're\nnot I don't know I just feel like\nnot every 19 year old's doing that sure\nwhat I'm saying so when you come into\nthat\nlike the that little like I don't know\nlike when you come in and you go buy a\nLamborghini 19 without having houses and\nall these things and stuff it's like\nI never knew how to manage money like I\nnever knew how to like do that and if I\nand right now if I go back at 19 I had\nthe funds I had I would tell myself\ndon't buy Lamborghini right now and then\nwhat would you have done if you told\nyourself if Aiden Ross from the future\nshowed up to 19 year old Aiden Ross and\nwas like brah don't buy Lambo what what\n19 year old Aiden Ross have done\nI think what I think I would have\nliterally said\ngive it to your parents because they\nknow they know what to do you know what\nI mean that's what the older you would\nhave said what would the younger you\nhave done\noh you're saying younger than younger\nthan now no no so like if you were 19\nright let's say you could travel back in\ntime you could talk to your 19 year old\nself\nand 22 year old Aiden was like don't buy\na Lambo give it to your parents what\nwould 19 year old you have done\n you I'm buying a Lamborghini right\ninteresting huh\nyeah and so when you say desensitize\nmaybe I can offer something and let me\nknow so I'm getting the sense that you\nwhen you're grinding you feel really\ngood right because you're putting in\neffort and then you're seeing those\nnumbers or whatever those metrics are\nand then after you get it\nthere's like you feel nothing\nnot nothing so I'll explain it when\nyou're gaining when you're grinding\ntowards something you get a high after I\nwould do a viral stream or a viral\nmoment I would get high off of it it\nwould give me it would give me some type\nof like release of chemicals in my brain\nto make me like okay keep going this is\namazing I love I love the attention the\nthe what I'm gaining from this I love\nthe money I love the the dopamine\nrelease I love it I want more of it I\nwant to keep what's next how do I go\nviral again how do I do it again how do\nI go again how do I gain more followers\nhow do I get more how do I gain out of\nthis the cloud it's an addiction it's\nit's addicting it's a drug because\nyou're gaining\nwhen you keep gaining and gaining and\ngaining it's it's it's a high you know\nso\nI wouldn't say I feel nothing now I just\ndon't care anymore like I don't care as\nmuch as I did before like if I was stuck\non a very very small poor community that\njust loves me and cares for me and will\nwatch me do anything\nand I I don't really care about the\ncrazy numbers anymore I don't really\ncare about doing crazy power stuff\nanymore like I just don't like I I care\nto go I care to make good content but\nlike the crazy crazy viral moments and\nstuff that I was doing back in the day I\ndon't want to put my I don't need to put\nmyself in that position anymore what's\nchanged\nI would say growing up a little more\num going through\na lot doing a lot I would say\num having more money now\num\nI would just say\nhonestly\nyeah I would just say more experience in\nthis as well\nand in what ways have you grown up Aiden\nexperience I think um\nI'm not 100 mature yet I'm not I still\nhave a lot to learn I'm still super\nyoung and I make dumb decisions all the\ntime\num\nI don't know man I think\nI think I still got a lot more growing\nup too but I think I'm in a better place\nuh now than I was when I was\nback in 21 20 you know how are you\ndifferent one or two years ago what was\nthe place you were in\nless money uh different different living\nsituation\num\nyou know\nI would say less like like just less\nexperience in general in my in my career\nas well\nyou know I don't really speak with\nanymore we're gonna say I'm sorry so no\nno it's totally cool dude I um I was\njust kind of so I'm a little bit\nconfused because like on the one hand\nI'm sort of hearing that back in the day\nwhen your head was in the game you felt\ngood\nyou're grinding you're getting that\ndopamine rush you use the word Addiction\nwhich is I mean that's that's a powerful\nword man and at the same time it sounds\nlike you felt really good\nand and I'm sort of almost hearing you\nkind of say that you're in a better\nplace now but you like don't feel as\ngood in some way like does that kind of\nmake sense I'm sort of hearing two\ndifferent threats I don't feel I don't\nfeel fulfillment and high anymore after\nhaving a viral moment does that make\nsense like if I see about if I see a\nviral moment or viral clip now I'll just\nlaugh about it and scroll right past it\nI don't care anymore as I would care\nback in 2021 I would be super super like\noh my God oh my God I gotta do more of\nthis I gotta do that I gotta do this\nI I just don't really care for it\nanymore\nwhich one do you prefer the way you are\nnow or the way you used to be now all\nabout pleasing a core that cares about\nme then a trendy audience that doesn't\nreally care do to give two shits\nabout me for sure okay\nand it's being fulfilled and and being\nhigh the same thing\nwhat do you mean so you said like you\ndon't get the sense of fulfillment you\ndon't feel as high anymore I don't mean\nlike drugs I mean like what you're\ntalking about I feel at peace I feel I'm\ncool with what I have like I feel\ncomfortable you feel good at peace now\nat peace because back in back when I was\nin that 2021 mode I was nervous and\nwhole and horribly going like mentally\ndestroyed because I would always have to\nthink about what I got to do the next\nday to go viral otherwise I'm gonna fall\noff you know what I'm saying like I I\nwas I was on a mission still trying to\ngrind and trying to\nfigure things out and try to just going\ndown this little upscale of a blow up\nyou know I'm kind of hearing that like\nit's quite a roller coaster dude so like\non the one hand there's like the Thrills\nand it's like hell yeah you feel that\nenergy what's next baby but at the same\ntime maybe there's like\nanxiety like maybe I can't do it like\nyeah you know doubt\nliterally yes self-doubt self\num just a lot of a lot of like\nlike overthinking men just like straight\nup just you know what kind of what do\nyou mean by overthinking what kind of\nthings if I didn't talk this stream I\nwas gonna fall off and everyone would\nleave me and I just thought like I\ndidn't do this right or or you know if I\ndidn't you know\nfigure out a way to do this stream\nbetter and figure it out and my whole\nCommunity was going to leave me I really\ndid I thought I thought I won't leave\nand\nwhat what so you mentioned that like\nyou're who you hang out with or\nsomething has changed what what's\nhappened uh your community your\nconnections\nI had a different living Arrangement you\nknow back on my name in 2021 I was first\nblowing up a lot of people hit me up had\na lot of fake people\num in my life at that time I had a lot\nof people who were were just straight up\num\njust not I had a lot of people in my\nlife that weren't there like my living\nversion was I was in a whole Concert\nHouse okay I was in a house full of\npeople\num who do concentration as well the\ninternet and\num it was just it was a different\nenvironment I was living in work if that\nmakes sense like I was living yeah I was\nI would wake up to a messy ass room to a\nstream I did the day before\nand I would you know what I'm saying I\nwould wake up to that like if I like was\nin my streaming room the other day\nand I and I completely broke like um\nthis one stream I did I broke like this\nconcrete stuff with a hammer\num and and I slept in that like I was\nsleeping in work so my living\narrangement in general was just\ncompletely different like it was just I\nwas living in work I felt too much work\nwork work work work work you know and\nand how are you living now\nhappier for sure I I now um\nand I don't live and work if I want to\ntake a day off and lay in bed and watch\nTV and and just take one thing at a time\nand not live and work and go outside and\nit's it's a lot better\nyeah\nI do I do I do sometimes get lonely\nthough I'm not gonna lie\nbut\nuh what you're writing down there doctor\nI mean I've written a ton of why\nare you so focused on what I'm writing\nnow\nI'm just kidding I'm just I know I know\nyou're right I don't think you're\nkidding\nwell no I'm saying like I know you've\nbeen riding this whole time like I I\ndon't really care you've been writing I\nmean I know you're just taking notes\nis there something about\ncan I ask you a question\num and I know I've been asking you it's\nkind of silly so what I'm signaling to\nyou is I I think\nwhat was it like to say you get lonely\nsometimes\nI've always lived with work so I've\nalways had people around and now that I\nlive alone\nit's different because now I live alone\nI don't live with family I don't live\nwith parents I used to have girlfriend\nlike a girlfriend excuse me I used to\nlive over there I don't live with her\nobviously we broke up\nI don't I live alone right so it's like\nfor me\nit's like\nit's different you know I get lonely\nsometimes\nsounds lonely\nyeah it is but I have friends and I have\nyou know my parents close by and stuff\nso it is what it is\ncan I think for a second\nthink\nI'm gonna need a second okay take your\ntime\nis it okay to be lonely\nyes it is I used to think it wasn't but\nit is help me understand that\nit's okay to be lonely it's okay to not\nhave to rely on somebody for happiness\nit's okay to find yourself\num find happiness within yourself like\nyou don't need to be\nyou don't need to be always with\nsomebody you're allowed to be lonely and\nfind happiness and\nsleep alone and\nyou know\nyou're allowed to do that stuff I think\nI think I think doing that sometimes can\nbe good for people I think I think\npeople need to find themselves by being\nalone you know okay\num\nI'm gonna just share a couple thoughts\nlet me know like it's kind of like a\nshot in the dark like normally I talk to\npeople a little bit more but you let me\nknow what\nwhat sits with you and what doesn't so\nfirst thing is you kind of mentioned you\nknow early on that you sort of feel numb\num and or desensitized I think was the\nword that you used and and I just heard\nI was because you see you know I I don't\nget that from you\nso you seem pretty animated you seem\nactually pretty in touch with your\nfeelings like you got a really like\npoetic description of of you know the\ngrind and how it's like addictive and it\nmakes you feel good but it like comes at\na cost right like there are the high\nhighs they're the low lows and the scary\nthing about the grind is even when\nyou're flying at the top in the back of\nyour mind there's like okay is this\nplane gonna crash\nand and then it can feel really good to\nlike have those thoughts and beat them\nback with like something growing bigger\nand getting more viral and like you know\nso it's it's almost like you're\nconquering your demons because you have\nall these doubts and stuff and like\nyou're going higher and you're going\nhigher and you're going higher and as\nyou as you put it you beat the game\nand then I you know I saw a couple\nthings from you that I I just haven't\nseen before except when you mentioned\nthe loneliness so like the first thing\nis you called attention to me writing\nwhich which I know I mean you know I've\nbeen writing the whole time and like I\nknow I've been writing the whole time\nbut there seemed to be something like\nwhat I actually felt in that moment is\nlike a little bit of uh\nlike a little bit of uh\nsensitivity like\nlike you know like what are you writing\nlike there's like like what what what\ndid I just show you that you\ncaught is like honestly what it felt\nlike to me\num and then you also said like it and\nthen I asked you like hey like is it\nokay to be lonely and you kind of said\nyeah right which I I think you're a\nsmart guy and I I think that you\nuse your mind to\ndeal with a lot of your stuff I don't\nknow how else to put it and then you you\ngave like a really positive answer right\nlike it's okay to be lonely it's okay to\nlike feel these things\nand then you kind of said it is what it\nis\nwhich is something that people say when\nsomething is not good\nyou know like well there's perks there's\npros and cons of everything right\num I think\nthere's times I'm like damn I wish I had\nsomebody with me I wish I couldn't enjoy\nlife with somebody I wish I can you know\nwhat I'm saying I think I think\nyou know there's there's there's pros\nand cons of everything I think um\nyou know when when you saw me I knew you\nwere writing this entire time when you\nsaw me talk to the loneliness part\nI yeah yeah I mean like look man I'm\ngonna be honest like\nit's good to be lonely but there's times\nwhere I also wish I wasn't lonely of\ncourse I'll admit it yeah\nyou know yeah I mean so\nthat too it's kind of like there's pros\nand cons right so like I'm I'm with you\nthere's pros and cons to being loneliest\npros and cons to being married uh I'm\nwith you I think intellectually it's\nspot on but but I'm kind of noticing\nthat like anytime you kind of come up on\nemotion your mind kind of steps in and\nand sort of says like oh there are pros\nand cons right it's okay to kind of feel\nthis way but something interesting\nhappens is that you actually move away\nfrom the Feeling by saying that\ndoes that make sense yeah it does I I\nlike I said\nmy emotions are like I feel like\nI don't feel sometimes I try to step\naway I try to move away I try to get\naway from the feeling part of things\nsometimes yeah and and why do you think\nyour emotions are\nthroughout my whole life I've always had\ntrauma and I've always not really\nlike went through it I've always kind of\njust like put it put it to the side\num\ndo you feel comfortable sharing I mean I\ndon't think this is the place to really\nair out all your traumas but can you\nhelp me understand huh yeah yeah so the\nmost traumatic thing that ever happened\nto me was\ncheck this out right this is a uh story\nwhen I was 12.\nI was sleeping\nmy uh\nmy uncle came in\nstabbed me with a knife in my sleep see\nthe mark right there it's a scar for\nlife\nand he thought I worked for the FBI he\nwas on some meth\nholy yeah yeah yeah I was 12 years\nold and um in my sleep and I woke up to\na knife and I pulled it out and I went\nto the hospital\nyeah how does it feel to say that\nhe said I don't care they make jokes\nabout it with me they've actually helped\nme out a lot you know who's they\nMy Stream\nmy chat my audience I think my viewers\nwhat joke I'm confused well they just\nmake me like I think sometimes humor\nkills voids in a way like sick Dark\nTwisted jokes you know what I mean like\nI think my my audience my viewers\nsometimes helped me like they make jokes\nabout it so it's like it makes it like a\nlittle bit you try to add light to the\ndarkness of it you know\nyeah I mean I think that that's sounds I\nmean humor is a way that human beings\ncope with stuff all the time yeah and I\nmean so even though that was kind of\nphysically traumatic did it how did you\nunderstand that\ndid it bother you at a young age I\ndidn't at a young age I didn't and my\nparents told me they said you don't have\nto go to school for however long you\nwant\nwe're gonna put you in therapy we're\ngonna do all these things and all that\nand I said nah I want to go to school it\nwas it happened on a Friday I said I\nwant a Friday Friday uh night after\nschool I said nah I'm going to school\nMonday they got me a cast I went to\nschool I made up a lot of everybody in\nmy class I said that I tripped on a rust\nlike a rusty nail I was\nthat's not what I said\nand um I remembered it are you\nI mean that's impressive\nyeah\nlike that's a hard 12 year old dude\nthank you I appreciate that yeah yeah\nand I think um\nI left out something as well\nI I I I also witnessed my grandparents\nhaving sex at eight years old as well\nkind of witness in a way shadows and\nnoises and stuff\nwell so so it's kind of interesting\nbecause you know you call that trauma\nand like it's definitely trauma yeah for\nsure it is for sure it is and that and\nyet like what I'm actually getting the\nmost of you from or what I'm feeling the\nmost of from you is actually like Pride\nnot right I just try to bring it pride I\nprobably bring light to it it is dark\ndon't get me wrong doctor it is dark\nit's up\nI just try to bring light to the\nsituation\nlike I think adding a piece and the\nscent of dark humor to stuff is in my\nopinion the best way to kind of put\nlight over it like it's like\nI I\njust like that's how I guess I've been\ndealing with them always just crack dark\ncrazy dark jokes absolutely man I mean I\nI think um literally like um\nwe can talk about this if you if you\nwant to at some point but literally\nearlier today\nlet's see if I can find this\nhere it is\nuh no I'm I'm actually reading a bunch\nof papers about coping mechanisms and\nTrauma yeah and just how they they kind\nof change and stuff but it it's kind of\ninteresting so I'm noticing that\nyou bring a lot of positive to the\nnegative and that's what I try to do man\nyou know what I'm saying like\nI look at it like this and people always\nsometimes are like damn I wish when I\nwas growing up I didn't have it like\nthat and I wish sometimes like it would\nbe easier and stuff and I don't want to\nsound ignorant there's definitely people\nthat have had it way worse than me but\nI've been through some stuff you know\nwhat I mean not probably there's people\nthat are that are to see hear this that\nhave been through way way worse than me\nyou Etc right so I don't want to sound\nignorant but I think that you got to\ntake sometimes take the cards you're\ndealt with\nand just\ntry your hardest in life and give it all\nyou got and I think part of that is\nfinding a way to literally\nkind of make your mind strong so I think\nwhen you go through these traumatic\nthings in in life\nyou want to try to add some type of like\nlight to it you know what I mean yeah\nabsolutely so I'm hearing that\nyeah I I hear you dude so like what I'm\ngetting from you is that you've you're a\nsurvivor you're a thriver despite your\ncircumstances\nyeah yeah I would believe so yeah I mean\nI think there's plenty of evidence for\nthat yeah\nso what bothers you about\nso so when you kind of say like\nyou know you didn't feel much when you\nwere traumatized like help me understand\nthat a little bit I just so\nwhen I was when I was a kid I just never\nliked talking about my feelings I always\njust kept it in like even though I would\nsomething bad would happen to me I would\nalways just find a way to just kind of\nlike change topic and just not want to\ntalk about it and just not want to let\nit out and just really just keep it in\nand put in the back of my head and think\nabout it later what kind of stuff would\nyou keep in\nanything in general you know what I'm\nsaying going up\num just with any type of trauma any type\nof like my whatever my parents fighting\nor you know whether it just be my\ngrandparents having sex in front of me\nor whether it be you know getting\nstabbed in the knife in my sleep\nwhatever it was any type of trauma like\nthat I would just always try to not\nreally talk about it put in the back of\nmy head and forget about it well I mean\nit sounds like you're actually doing\nsomething similar even today it sounds\nlike you learned a different way of\ndoing that which is looking at the\npositive trying to put light on it\ncracking jokes yeah but I'm hearing that\nmaybe at one point you were like\navoiding it or or whatever and now\nyou've learned a different way to like\nmove away from it yeah definitely\nso let me ask you what's what's the\nproblem with like\nnot feeling a whole lot\nscary\nit's scary because like\nI'm wondering one day is this gonna\ncatch up to me am I am I gonna one day\none day wake up alone at 40 years old\nand not have any feeling at all any type\nof\nany type of like\nI don't know any type of like ambition\nany type of like feeling and admiration\num if I said that right sorry\num if I any type of love any type of\njust happiness in general like am I\ngonna be this empty\num having like this void like am I gonna\nI don't know I'm scared what what what\nwhat am I gonna feel in the next 10\nyears\nwhat do you think you're gonna feel in\nthe next 10 years\nI don't know hopefully hopefully good\nhas has your fear of this grown or\nshrunk over the last four years\nof what being scared about my future\nyeah yeah I would just say living in the\nmoment more and I think just not really\ntrying to think about it because I'm\nscared I just listen I think nobody\nwants to be alone when they're older bro\nyou you have are you married yeah\nlike that's your person you know I mean\nlike that's your best friend that's your\ncompanion that's like your rock so like\nyou're good right how old are you if you\ndon't want me asking 40. you're good\nbrother you're good I'm worried at 40\nyears old I'm not gonna be able to find\nsomeone genuine enough to love me for me\nI I wear that stuff sometimes man I I\nworry you know\num\nI just worry about that yeah I mean I\nthink it's a super legit word dude like\nI think uh\num\nyou said earlier that you're known on\nthe Internet is Aiden Ross\nyeah you were Aiden and I absolutely\nlike there's a decent chance you'll end\nup with a string of people who are not\ninterested in Aiden but are interested\nin Aiden Ross 99 of people that's right\nit's scary man it sounds like\nthe odds are stacked against you\nyeah but I saw myself all for it Ben and\nI used to feel bad about it and I used\nto hate hate it in a way but it's like\nI'm blessed at the end of the day man\nlike they're doing it again what are you\ndoing\nwhat am I doing oh adding positive to\nthe negative yeah\ndamn that's crazy you're right I did\njust do that\nright so so the interesting thing is\nlike\nlike I'm with you man yeah but like\nI'm gonna say something\nplease\nI'm really curious and and you gotta\ncan you do me a solid can I ask you for\nsomething\ngo ahead I just want you to tell me what\nyour response is good bad whatever yeah\nAiden how would you feel if I said I'm\nsad for you\nright now you just said Ian I'm sad for\nyou yeah I would ask well and be like\nwhy are you sad for me\nbecause I I mean you just told me that\nthere's a 99 chance that people are\ngoing to be with you for the wrong\nreason you just you're worried about\nbeing lonely\nmy initial response was like yeah man it\nsucks but what can I do\nthe truth I mean like what could I do\nabout it you know what I'm saying like I\nmean I I I I I I it would be like yeah\nit does suck but I mean like what can I\ndo about it it is what it is it is what\nit is that's the type of bug literally\nyeah\nbut then but then but then when I'm but\nthen when I'm alone in my bed I'ma cry\ntonight\nand I'll be like damn doctor is right\nbut damn\nI can't tell if that's a joke or not\num\nI get my feelings sometimes man\nit depends like it depends what type of\nday I'm having\nand what kind of day are you having\ntoday\ngood day\ndoes that make it more or less likely\nthat you'll cry at night\nI well I was adding a little bit of joke\nto that to that to that statement I\ndon't I'll never cry at night alone you\nknow I mean like I I just sometimes get\nmy thoughts\nthe sad thoughts that come in and it's\njust more thoughts that are just like\nthink about my future it happens every\nso often but it just depends on time\ndamn have it that's all\nokay any how's this going\nI like this what do you like about it\nI like having an actual conversation\nwith somebody that's a good conversation\nuh a serious conversation\nI don't get a lot of these unless it's\nwith my parents or close friends and I\nthink meeting is like you're a stranger\nto me I'm a stranger to you I think\nmeeting is stranger and having like an\nintellectual conversation like this is\nit's nice I like it it's something\ndifferent that I usually don't do well\nno wonder you're lonely\ndamn\nI mean I tried\nno I'll tell you what I'll tell you I\nknow I know I know what did you hear\nthere\nI was like damn like what damn dog like\nwhy'd you say it like that\nhelp me understand how what you heard me\nsay\nI said it's like it's rare if you have\nintellectual conversations with\nstrangers you said no that's wonder why\nyou're lonely yeah I mean I mean I mean\nyeah you're right but it's hard to have\nintellectual conversation with strangers\nthat want to leech off me and use me for\nthings it's harder to see the real\npeople\nyou know yeah\nso like\nI wasn't it wasn't like it wasn't a dig\nat you\nI don't know I know you're good I know\nright because like dude it's like it's\nhard like like you don't even get to\nhave regular conversations with people\nbro yeah so like in person when somebody\nrecognizes me they'll come up to me and\nask for a picture they won't even want\nto have a conversation it's the same\nscript every time hey until I get a\npicture they walk away it's no how's\nyour day going it's no I'm good man what\ndo you do what's your name it's no hey\nman\num what you I TR I try to conversate\nsometimes I do but it's\nit's like I would love to have a\nconversation with people who know me I'd\nlove to get to know them as well you\nknow I'm hearing Aiden that you\nsometimes get treated almost like an\nobject\nyeah\nfor sure\nand all and let me like by the way you\nyou got to tell me if I overstep or\nsomething okay\num but like and I'm just saying like you\nknow if you just think about it for a\nsecond and anyone who's gets treated\nlike an object gets treated like Aiden\nRoss instead of Aiden like like they're\ngonna be lonely\nmy point my man it's very it's gonna be\nvery hard for me to find the one\nall right\nyeah well I I I'm a little bit more\noptimistic I I I think I think you think\nI will\nI think so\nthank you I think you absolutely can so\ncan I tell you why\ntell me why\num I think you're good at growing\nlike I think you're good at growing like\nlike you put your mind to something and\nyou work on it like you're a resilient\nguy\nuh I I think you had to learn\ncertain ways to survive\nand you paid the price for that in a\nweird way\nso like the weird thing is if you look\nat our brain like our brain can't\nselectively suppress emotions so what it\nlearns how to do is shut them like you\ncan turn down the volume but it's not\nlike you can just turn down the volume\non some instruments there's a song point\nyou either turn down the volume or you\nturn it up\nand what I'm hearing from you is that\nyou turn down the volume a lot and over\ntime you've actually learned healthier\nways to turn down the volume\nand so what you used to do is like I'm\nnot quite quite sure what not really I\nmean we can if you want to at the end I\ncan pull out an iPad and walk you\nthrough like\nyou know almost like lecture style like\nwhat traumatic coping mechanisms look I\nlike in the evolution of coping\nmechanisms and stuff but and then now\nI'm hearing like a lot of you know\nsomething that is on the ver so a lot of\nhumor but also like a lot of like\nfatalistic acceptance\nand almost like resignation\nyeah right so is that is that a good or\nbad thing it's neither\nit's a strategy so I think that on the\none hand if you don't like because\nhere's the thing if you were alone at\nthe age of 40 how would you feel about\nthat\nI was one of the age of 40. I don't know\ndoctor I don't know how my brain's gonna\nbe I don't know you know what I mean let\nme toss something out you see if if it\nsits with you okay okay I think you\nwould be like kinda okay with it because\nyou knew that this would happen right\nyou always knew that the deck was\nstacked against you 99 of people are\ngonna see Aiden Ross and not Aiden like\nyou saw it coming like you see\nit coming even today\nyeah and so like you're not going to be\nsurprised\nyou have a Doctor Who Wants to be 40\nMalone bro\nI mean I I think no one\nI I mean I I'm hearing\nwhat are you what where's what are you\nfeeling when you say that\nwants to be 40 years old and alone you\nknow it's just like when you when I\nthink about it it's like damn like it's\na realization it's like who actually\nwants to be 40 years old and alone\nwaking up alone I could have a billion\ndollars in my big account doctor\nI still would not want to be 40 and\nalone I'd rather have\nless than a billion\nyou would trade that much money for what\na real one\na best friend a companion\nwhat's it like to want that\nI just think like right now it's like\nI'm chilling\nbut I just think like\nlater on\nit's gonna be harder\nI think it hurts\nright now no\nbecause I'm so distracted right now\nthere's so much going on I'm like\ndistracted I'm doing a lot when I'm not\nstreaming I'm still you know what I'm\nsaying yeah but so when you say it's\ngonna be hard like what does that mean I\nthink it I think I'm like 30 most of my\nfriends are going to be married with\nkids\nand they're gonna be doing their own\nVibes and they're not really gonna have\ntime to be kicking on me anymore\nand I don't know what I'm gonna be doing\nwith this stuff anymore hopefully I'm\nstill doing who knows\nbut if I'm sitting there I got nothing\ngoing on no career at that point I don't\neven think that far like as far as like\ncareer-wise but I mean like I I like to\nthink because I don't know this game I\ndon't know I don't know what I'm I don't\nknow what they're doing but\nI just wanna I wanna figure out it's\nokay to be scared dude\nyeah I think that's what makes me human\nyeah and I think when you don't let\nyourself be scared that's what makes you\nnot human\nyeah that's what makes you a robot\ntrue\nright and I think that there's like I\nmean by the way am I like beating you up\nhere you're not you're making me think\nactually I like thinking okay\nhow do you feel about feeling\nI love feeling I love feeling feelings\nare you feeling feelings now I am\nfeeling feelings with you what are you\nfeeling\nI'm feeling very curious I'm feeling\nvery like open-minded I'm feeling\nvery um\ninterested in this conversation for real\nI really am I I like it a lot okay\nOkay so\nlet me toss some stuff at you okay we\ndoing all right can I can I keep going I\nlove it yeah of course bro of course\num I mean so here's here's kind of like\nI I think it's like it so so it's really\ninteresting because I think you\nintellectually understand what you feel\nI think you just won't let yourself feel\nit\nright so like you recognize you're\nyou're scared\nyou recognize you're lonely\nyou know you use these words that are\nlike emotionally Bland so you say it's\ngonna be hard\nbut like and I I get that and you're\nright it's a hundred percent accurate\nbut it's also like\nyou're turning off the color on the TV\nright like true like okay doctor can I\ntell you something yeah like have you\nokay have you ever obviously I'm not\ntrying to bring this up if you're like\nif you don't want to talk about it\nthat's fine I completely understand when\nyou before your wife like you were with\nmany women right that you probably have\nno connection with\nsure\nwhat I'm trying to get at is like when\nyou when I if you get with a lot of\ngirls there's no connection or anything\nit's called like in my generation I\ndon't know what's called your boomer\ngeneration for me it's called\nhoes it gets old like nobody wants to\nkeep hoes I don't be 30 40 year\nold I want to be 40\nyears old with a wife and kids that's\nthe goal correct right like that like\nthat's like the Fulfillment but I think\nlike when you're when you're when you're\nif you if you do that for your whole\nlife it's like depressing and avoid and\nyou're not fulfilling anything it's just\nlike you're a a bunch of hoes\nsee you realize that you're about home\nlike you're the one that's doing that\n these that's how it is now my\ngeneration is up doctor you know\nhow bad like these girls doctor are so\n bro it's bad very bad it's been\nvery hard as it is being me and I'm\ntalking about asking hard in general\nbecause these girls nowadays doctor\nthey're\nbad bro all right I might just go gay\n it all right I had a joke that was\na joke I'm sorry sure sure all right so\nlet me let me tell you what I heard yeah\nyeah yeah\num I think there was a really important\nCommunication in there I just don't know\nif my Boomer ass can decipher it so yeah\nbro okay so so what I'm hearing is that\nlike there's a certain amount of\npleasure in sexual activity\nyes but there's a lack of fulfillment of\ncourse after I not I want the to\nnot talk do it I'm not sorry I'm just\nsorry I want the girl the female the\nqueen to not speak to me look at me\nleave why yes that's unfulfillment sex\nit doesn't make sense why am I having\nunfulfillment sex\nbut I'd rather why do you want those\nthings why don't you want them to talk\nto you afterward there's no point\nwhat\nbut so this is what I'm confused about\nso you're engaging in this behavior and\nthere's some rules to the behavior and\nthen you feel unfulfilled and then as\nyou get in your words Aiden you become\nthe hoe so like I I think somewhere\nsomewhere in there like\nyou end up in a like I don't know what\nthat means but I don't think it's good\nit's not it's not good that's why it's\nnot getting with girls for no\nreason like I stopped doing that right\nyeah there's no point like it's\ndefinitely not good it's post about\nClarity you know what that is obviously\nright sure\nafter i nut like in the moment like yeah\nlike so what are you looking for before\nto get my nut off\nokay but like and then how do you but\npost not you're telling me post not\nClarity is unfulfilling and makes you\nfeel like a hoe yeah but in the moment\ndoctor feels good I mean like what I\nmean yeah yeah but I mean so so sure so\nlike sex is fun I'm with you okay but\nlike like what I'm kind of pointing out\nis like you're engaging in behavior that\nmakes you feel cheap\nthat makes you feel unfulfilled yes yes\ncorrect that's why I'm telling you like\nI don't see the point it gets old like I\nfeel like when you when you when you get\nwith girls for unfulfillment post not\nClarity it's pointless it gets it gets\nold after a while you know what I mean\nyes so maybe this is a whole\nconversation for a different day I'm\njust gonna toss this out there there is\na connection between the way you treat\nyourself and the way that you treat\nother people\n100 right so yeah\nyou hearing what I'm saying\nno can you break it down please yeah\nsure so like I hear you use a particular\nkind of language and also engage in a\nparticular kind of relationship with\npeople that you're sexually active with\nyeah because doctor there's a difference\nbetween a girl like a genuine like okay\ngirls are girls but doctors the\ndifference between a girl and a whole\nlike like it's different it's different\nlike a queen and a hoe it's two\ndifferent girls like I'm trying to tell\nyou like I want to find a queen the\nhoes the hoes got it they can you know\nwhat I'm saying like there's no\nwhat's the difference doctor you're not\ngonna marry a hoe you're gonna marry a\nqueen\nwhat's the difference\na hoe is a girl that if I literally DM\nright now\num she'll she'll she'll literally come\nover first night give it up like\nI don't gotta take her out I don't gotta\nconversate with her it's just like\nyou know what I'm trying to say\nso\nthat is a hoe I don't want to wipe that\nyou wouldn't want either\nyou wouldn't trust me\nyou wouldn't because\nyou're soulless you you know nothing\nabout my relationship right well no I'm\njust assuming nobody wants the wife a\nhoe doc so here's here's what I'm\nhearing to be honest Aiden I think I\nthink a lot of it's in your head like so\nI've seen relationships where that start\noff with sexual promiscuity that end up\nin that are happily married yeah yeah\nand I've seen relationships that\nthey wait until marriage that end up in\ndivorce\nyeah but yeah no you're not wrong that's\nwhy like 70 of there's like isn't a\ndivorce rate like higher than it's ever\nbeen right now I don't know I don't it's\nit's been a while it's written high for\na while yeah it's about 50 like sub 50.\ncrazy and you know people that aren't\neven divorced they probably some of them\nnot all of them I'm not gonna assume but\nmost of them they're unhappy and they\nwant to get divorced but they won't\nbecause of financial support because\nthey have kids Etc so like a lot of\npeople are unhappy in their marriages\nthat are still actively in their\nmarriages you know so\nsure\nI I mean I I think I think we're this is\ngetting to because I I think the a lot\nof this has to do with the way that you\nperceive these people so like I know\nthis sounds kind of weird but like it\nsounds like you're you're determination\nof whether someone is\nworthy or not worthy of marriage has to\ndo with their behavior that's what I'm\nhearing\n100 definitely right so so I know it\nsounds kind of weird but like whether\nsomeone is worthy or not\nmay have to do with your attitude too\n100 but you have to understand like\nyou're not wrong what you just said\nthat's why I stopped doing it like if a\ngirl if I damn a girl what are you doing\ntonight\ncome over whatever she comes over and\nlike I put on a movie I know it's about\nto happen it's like I don't have like\nit's like it doesn't feel like it's like\nhow do I put this\nafter I'm done with what I want to do\nI want her out\nit's not about being a bad person like\nI'm not a bad person for that I promise\nyou I'm not no I mean I think I think if\nlike people are if it's consensual and\npeople are not interested in romantic\nattachments and like two people want to\nget together and have sex I don't think\nthere's anything wrong with that right\nas long as you're not disrespectful and\nit's concerned I would say there's not\nbut like actually I agree with you on\nthat there's like nothing wrong with you\nknow I mean like two people coming\ntogether and do what they want to do and\npart of ways 100 but like\nI'm a sapiosexual you know what that is\nattracted to intelligence\nno I mean demisexual like I like I'm\nattracted to like someone that like I\nhave feelings for I can only now I'm at\nthe point my life where I can only have\nsexual stuff with somebody I actually\nlike\nlike I have feelings for I can't I can't\ndo stuff with girls I have no sure so so\nlet's but like what determines whether\nyou have feelings for someone\nif I like them and they like me and we\ncompensate and I feel good energy and I\nfeel really good around them and they\nfeel really good about around me\nokay\nso I'm gonna toss something out there\nsure\ncan I think for a second yeah doctor let\nme pee real quick is that okay\nabsolutely man\ngo go go go\nthis may take longer than two hours\nhe's a he's like he's like\nhonest guy you got to give him that he's\nvery authentic tries you got a lot of\ngenuineness very genuine\num\nforeign\nokay\nyou doing good yeah I'm all right how\nyou doing good I didn't wash my hands so\nwhatever man it's your place you live\nalone\num\nso\nokay how how confident are you\nin the stuff that you're explaining to\nme that there's like two kinds of women\nin this world\npretty confident okay\nand help me understand where that\nconfidence comes from\nuh being with hoes and being with Queens\nthere's two differences okay so what's\nit what is it\nwhat does it feel like to be with one\nversus the other\noh you want to have sex with and then\nyou want her to get out the queen you\ncould have sex with this guy called\nmaking love okay because you're you guys\nboth like each other it's different it's\nmore it's better it feels better you\nknow what I'm saying and then and then\nafter after you're done with the with\nthe queen sex you guys cuddle you you\nrub each other you watch it you watch TV\nyou watch some more TV so so I know it\nsounds kind of weird Aiden but what I'm\nhearing is that the difference isn't in\nthe person the difference is in your\nreaction to the person\nyeah definitely\nright so so I know it sounds kind of\nweird but if if the difference is in you\nnot necessarily okay so check this out\nright let me give you an example let's\nsay there's a girl named Tasha Tasha\nOklahoma\nsorry Tasha Fox Larry and then she\nJoseph and then she Aiden back to\nback to back Knights that is a hope\nokay what what what is that what are you\nsaying I'm trying to break it down like\nthat's that's\nthat's like a hoe that's that's you know\nwhat I'm saying so a queen it's it's\nyeah it's about my death the finding of\nthe behavior of these women but a queen\nis someone who\nhow do I say this it's like in their own\nlike they're they're\nokay forget about everything you're\nexplaining for a second okay and listen\nto you\nso when I ask you what's the difference\nyou say that the way that that you feel\nwith them is different\nyes right like that's it because with\nboth of them\nyou know there's intercourse but in one\ncase it's and in one case it's\nmaking love what's the difference Aiden\nbetween and making love making\nlove is better you know what I'm saying\nfine one is better I don't know if I\nentirely agree with you there but you\nhave a wife you know I mean like so you\nknow what it's like like you do notice\nlike though\nokay the conversation for a different\nday but\nwhat I'm what what else is different\nwhen you're in love with somebody and\nyou make love to them\nit's way better\nthan sure it's better but what\nmakes it better\nbecause when you the hoe and you\nnot you don't want you don't want\nnothing to do with them anymore you\ndon't want to you don't want any you\ndon't want to talk look you want them\nout of your room okay so let me explain\nlet me just point out but the difference\nis in you it's not in the person you're\nsaying you don't want to it's the\nconnection or lack okay so the\ndifference between and making\nlove is your emotional\nconnection to the person\nyeah okay so the first thing is like\nthat's not their behavior now we're\ngonna get to behavior in a second that's\ncoming from you oh yeah technically yeah\nokay so\nI don't know if I'm gonna get banned for\nusing this word ho but\nso I'm not going to use that word\nalso I consider it disrespectful\nbut that's fine I mean you use the\nwhatever language you want to so let me\nask you this\nis it possible\nto fall in love with someone with whom\nyou have\nyou start off by having meaningless sex\nyes it is\nokay right so then then like love is not\ndetermined by them it's still something\nwithin you\ncorrect but following the level of the\nhoe is a no-num\nokay\nwhy\nbad they got whole Tendencies they're\ngonna end up you over they're\ngonna have divorcing you once they get\nonce a baby pops out and they're gonna\nget some child support money so no no\nhow do you know what they're gonna do\nstop I'm just like they have Tendencies\nbrother they they they they they to\nget to the top they to for money\nthey fought where are you getting this\nto a host do my generation it's\ndifferent brother you're 40. I'm 20. I'm\nit's split in half I'm telling you my\ngeneration is bad bro you should see\nwhat these women do it's very up\nno I\nI I'm asking so just please think about\nthe question for a second where are you\ngetting your information my experience\nyour personal experience yes and and my\nmy peers my other people my space my\nbase like work buddies\num um I would say so this is what you I\nI'm not I'm not deny I'm not saying\nyou're wrong I'm just genuinely trying\nto understand right because I I know it\nsounds kind of weird but like I know\nyour regeneration really well\nare you doing my generation 100 man it's\nbad so you can admit it's bad right\nI think there are parts that are bad for\nsure but my generation is full bunch of\ntick-tock low attention span brain\nchildren and and and and and and and and\num like literally I said children but\nobviously like the 20s like 18 19 year\nolds that's what I meant by that like\nit's it's very bad I'm gonna say talk\nbring myself doctor and this may sound\nweird like and we I'm not right here\nokay yeah your generation is full of\nhuman beings trying to make it in this\nworld just like every generation before\nthe world has changed I agree yes right\nI'm with you but like I still think it's\nlike\nyou know this is the kind of thing where\nI wonder a little bit about like when\nyou engage in a transactional\nrelationship with someone from the\nget-go\nand you treat them transactionally\nI think it's reasonable that you're\ngonna get that in return\nright right\nand so like when when you say like these\npeople are gonna behave like this like I\nknow it sounds kind of silly but I'm\nreally not trying to be a dick here you\nunderstand that people's behavior is not\nsolely based on them\nit also is influenced by you\nso a girl acting and behaving like a hoe\nis influenced by me 100 percent\nright so like I'm a human being and\nyou're a human being right if I came to\nyou and I said Aiden you nut you\ndon't know what you're talking about\nyou're all up in the head I'm\ngoing to I've gone to Harvard Medical\nSchool I am doctor I am psychiatrist\nAiden you don't know what you are doing\nyou need to get married I will find you\nwife we'll go find you nice girl\nshe will be good\nshe'll be good girl not these people you\nare dating on the Tinder and the Bumble\nand the hinge and all of this like you\nwill you need to settle down now better\ncome on bro this is great\nthis is great right so like if I\napproached you like that how would you\nrespond laugh\nokay right so so the way I interact with\nyou\nis gonna determine how you interact with\nme that's correct I actually get what\nyou're saying thank you for that putting\nit like that I right so so like my point\nhere is that I I mean I\nI don't know what I I'm even talking\nabout here or where this is going but\nlike I I don't doubt that your\nexperience is the way that it is but my\npoint is that like you know so I work\nwith patients who are narcissists\nam I narcissist by the way you're\nspeaking with me or no\nI don't know\nit's too early to tell yet\ndefinitely too early to tell so so like\nfrom a diagnostic perspective the the\ndiagnosis of narcissistic personality\ndisorder requires like a very long\nhistory of like understanding a lot more\nstuff\nI think the other thing that's\ncomplicated is that\ncontent creators by definition become\nmore narcissistic because that's the\nonly way you can survive content\ncreation thank you for actually saying\nthat you're not wrong I've changed I\nthink I am I definitely give up\nnarcissistic Tendencies you're actually\n100 incredible you just said when you're\na concentrated you've been in it for a\nlong time like it's like you look at\nview count your money all these things\nthere's so many yeah yeah views and so\nso I I'm not going to label you a\nnarcissist or not and if there's\nnarcissistic behavior here I think it's\nlike defensive in nature is my gut check\nfor most content creators okay so what\ndo you diagnose me as is there anything\nyou can do I would not diagnose you with\n bro really yeah well like literally\nI wouldn't diagnose you with anything\nbecause that's this is not medical care\nand if you want to understand the\nprocess of diagnosis sorry to disappoint\nno don't worry you're up and say\nI just won't say anything\nreally what it is is that the the\nquestions that determine a diagnosis are\nvery different from what we're doing\nwait doctor can you can you diet can you\nprescribe me lean\nwhat is lean\nnumber four\nwhat\na four\nI don't understand the question cough\nsyrup promethazine Cody like you know\nwhat I'm saying yeah yeah no\num but let's can I go back to this thing\nabout the way so so like your behavior\ninfluences someone else's Behavior right\nand their behavior influences your\nbehavior\nand so I I think that like what I'm\nworried about\nis is that so you don't want to end up\nalone so like\nI don't want you to end up alone Aiden I\nwant you to be happy you seem like a\ngood dude you seem like a dude who's\njust doing your best and yet you\ndo some things really well and and\nsomewhere along the way you've conceived\nof a world view which I don't think is\nthe best\nwhat do you mean\nI'll get to that in a second\nso because I'm trying I'm challenging\nyour beliefs right\nyeah I I yeah yeah I just I I I I agree\nwith the part where you're doing the\nbest I just I didn't know what you meant\nby the other part yeah I'm getting to\nthat okay so like like first thing to\nunderstand is that your relationships\nwith women are not like it's not like\nthere's two camps of women\nyeah there is\nyou can choose to judge people that way\nyes but like that's me being being\nignorant then if you want to say that\nbut yes I I will yeah you could choose\nto judge people but I'm telling you like\nscientifically it's just not it it's not\nlike there's two kinds like so human\nbeings are complex creatures so like\nyou're not you're not a dick or a hoe or\nanything like that you're you're just a\nhuman being who has gone through life\nand your brain has wired your psychology\nhas wired so that you have a consolation\nof stuff like you're a complex guy right\nthere are times where you feel like a\nhoe because you've had a lot of\nmeaningless sex and there are times\nwhere you feel in love and there are\ntimes where the scariest thing of all\nyou fall in love with someone who you\njudge as being not a queen yes and\nthen what happens is you your mind does\nthe same it does with all these\nother emotions where it's like would you\nlet yourself fall in love with someone\nwho's not a queen\n no absolutely right so in comes the\nhumor in comes the suppression income so\nI never feel anything incomes so like\nall that other because somewhere\nalong the way so then you won't let\nyourself love\nand then from the outside that's not\ntrue though doctor listen because it's\nnot it's not because doctor nobody wants\nto marry a well not nobody I'm speaking\nyou're right I'm ignorantly speaking\nfrom my based on my perspective I don't\nwant I don't know let me finish I'm just\ntalking hypothetically here okay okay\nall right so my point is like if we put\nourselves in the shoes of the women that\nyou interact with they can label you as\none of two things right I don't even\nknow what the they are but forget\nabout it they can judge you oh this\nguy's an or this guy's a prince\nwhatever right yeah and and there are\ncertainly people that are going to do\nthat my point is that you are a complex\nhuman being that has a lot of going\non\nand that your interactions with women\nmay be easily judged as this guy texted\nme and now he's whatever he's a player\nlike whatever he's an whatever\nhe's toxic whatever they can label you\nwith that but my point is that\nthere's a whole complicated like\ninternal like stuff going on you're like\na whole universe in there man yeah\nyou're not wrong\num I'll give you an example right\ndoctor\nI want to ask you a question okay and\nyou'll be honest and everyone can answer\nthis the honest way possible\nwould you rather you're already married\nso just pretend you're not married\npretend you're an 18 year old doctor\nokay\nwell what were you doing when you were\n18.\nmostly playing video games and what game\nuh\nuh maybe Diablo uh Starcraft\nokay\nyou're 18 years old playing Starcraft\nright yeah\nthere's a girl on Instagram at the time\nlet's just say there's Instagram there's\na girl on Instagram\nwho's got hella followers shows her ass\noff all over Instagram all this stuff or\ntexts everything right\nyou invite her over she comes over doc\nright away you you text her hey what are\nyou doing tonight want to pull up she's\nlike sure let's watch a movie tonight\nthe new the news uh uh uh stranger\nthings came out season let's watch it\ntonight she pulls up she put on for five\nminutes she starts rubbing your dick you\nstart kissing you her okay you want\nher to leave right away because come on\nlook how easy that was you want a\nchallenge you don't you don't want that\nlisten to this you go to Europe for\nvacation\nyou meet a girl\nyou meet a girl over in Europe\ncheese maybe had one or two guys\nshe she's fully close it doesn't really\nmatter the clothing part but she just\nhas\nshe's has she has that intellectual\nconversation to do about stuff you guys\ngo on a couple dates you really are\nstarting to like this girl she's\nstarting to like you as well\ndoes it matter\nI'm sorry which one would you rather go\nwith\ngoeth for what\nlike what's wrong would you rather marry\nI'm sorry\nI don't think that the variables that\nyou described would be very important\nfor I I completely said that wrong I'm\nsorry I should have explained it and got\nit\nbut you got to get what I'm saying so so\nyeah I here's what I hear you say you're\ntrying to put it put me in a\nhypothetical example in which you paint\nsomeone who's like got this extreme and\nthen you paint someone who's got this\nextreme and you're kind of pointing out\nto me hey nuts it's not that\ncomplicated there's two types of women\nin this world which one would you rather\nmarry bro and then and then if I say I\nwould rather marry this one right let's\nsay I'd rather marry the European\nthen how would you feel\nlike good doctor you're smart and\nif I said the other one\ndoctor no brother that's not that's the\none you don't want to marry go marry the\nother girl she's got it for you bro\nall right\ndoctor\noh I got you\nlet me let me let me let me bring it up\nthis this Instagram girl\nshe has two baby daddies two different\nguys she has uh 500 bodies\nand um\nshe uh\nI told you she's like half naked on\nInstagram\nokay okay this this other girl the\nEuropean girl no social media you know\nwhat I'm saying\num she has two bodies\nand she just you guys headed off\nintellectually like you guys are like it\njust feels so good it feels like you\ngotta connect\nokay who drives Mary\nso let's assume let's say that I marry\nthe European I'd rather European right\nbut but I think there's a big difference\nbecause you're presupposing that one of\nthem has an emotional connection the\nreal question is if you so like because\nyou're saying that the emotional\nconnection so what what are you hearing\nme say Aiden\nI'm happy I'm happy to say what I like\nyou can construct the scenario in\nwhatever way like you get that you can\nconstruct the scenario in whatever way\nif one of them has a year to live has\ncancer has HIV has all this and and\nthis the other thing is what you it's\nsubtle right because you're doing\nsomething really interesting you're\nadding promiscuity to a set of other\nnegative traits\nsorry what's promiscated I'm sorry I'm\nhaving sex with a lot of people\nright you're not saying the scenario\nyou're giving me is rigged right because\nit's not like you meet this person she's\nonly been she's she's intellectual she's\nbeautiful she's amazing she's a saint\nshe's awesome she's European because\napparently that has some extra appeal\nand she slept with 500 dudes\nright like so like you're sort of\ncreating this scenario where like\nthere's promiscuity on one side or like\nhaving sex with a lot of dudes but\nthere's also a shitload of other things\nand then if I keep on saying no what are\nyou gonna keep doing You're Gonna Keep\nOn adding other\nyou're actually politically correct the\nway you're wording things you're right\ntechnically there's so many different\nbreakdowns you give me and stuff you're\nyou're not wrong what I'm trying to say\nis broke if I have a boy who is dating a\nhoe I think everyone yeah you guys want\nif you have a boy who is with a hoe with\na girl who is just wrong to him all\nthese things like what do you mean by\nwrong to him\nsorry not wrong specifically just wrong\nlike a girl that has her morals all\n up right and Nobody's Perfect by\nthe way I'm just saying like it's as my\nboy if my boy's in that situation be\nlike yo bro no no no no no get another\none that ain't it\nokay so let me ask you something do you\nthink people who are very sexually\nactive can end up in happy fulfilled\nmarriages\nyes there's these things called whole\nphases in my generation everyone goes\nthrough a whole phase doctor okay\nanymore\nnow\nI'm allowed to go through a whole face\nbut if a goes through a whole face\n no send her ass to the curb\nso women everyone's allowed to go\nthrough a whole face\nokay can I be honest with you a girl's\nallowed to go through a whole face and\nshe's upfront honest about it I think\nnot a girl in general I think everyone\nis if you're upfront honest about your\nwhole past and tell them like everything\nwhat you've done and you're very direct\nand you don't find anything out like\nthat's hidden stuff I'm okay with that I\nthink when you're older people realize\nthat like it's cool like yeah I mean I\nthink I think Honesty and transparency\nand authenticity are important parts of\na relationship\nI think so too right so a lot of a lot\nof girls lie about their body counts a\nlot of girls lie about their past and\nstuff in my generation why do you think\nthat is\ninsecurity\nwhat does that mean women if a woman has\na lot of bodies she's known as whole my\ngeneration\nand whose fault is that\nthe girl\nI don't think so\nright because what the girl is trying to\ndo is avoid your judgment\nyeah but you should be honest\nmy mom said you should why you lie\nyou're gonna know what we're talking\nabout okay Andrew let me take a step\nback is this is this useful do you think\nthis is a good conversation\nno why don't we go into something that\nmakes more sense it's like a stupid\ntopic what makes this stupid\nit just doesn't really it's just like\ndumb it's like you you and I see\ndifferent you know I mean like it's like\nthere's no point to really talk about it\nI agree I agree with you that there is\nless point to talk about this yeah I'm\njust a little bit curious what did you\nhear me say about like this whole like\nwhat determines whether someone is a hoe\nor a queen\nnot gonna lie doctor I'm not gonna be\nignorant but I think like my perspective\nand experience on life makes me like I\nalready have this like in my head\nlike it it is ignorant it is like super\nlike judgmental and stuff like and I'm\nadmitting that but like it's it's like I\nalready have like I already kind of like\nknow like what I want in a woman I\nalready kind of know what I well I told\nyou doc I mean I might not even\nget what I want who knows\nyeah so I'm I'm hearing that you're not\nopen-minded on this topic\nshould move on\nokay it's pointless it's like it doesn't\nseem like it's not that it's pointless\nit's just like it's just like there's a\nlot more topics we can have it are way\nmore interesting okay\nwhat's pointless about this\nbecause you and I see different like\nmostly different yeah I think we see\ndifferent and I think you're correct\nwith a lot you're saying in in the way\nyou're speaking but like I have I have a\ndifferent perspective I think than you\nyou do like I think like my perspective\nlike I I've already like experienced\nwhat I've experienced so like I'm\nautomatically gonna think the way I\nthink does that make sense like I\nalready have like yeah so so uh so that\nI we don't have to talk about it more\nbut I just want to share one last thing\nwith you is like so I think that's what\nmakes it worth talking about is that you\nhave an automatic perspective\nyeah right definitely yeah yeah yeah for\nsure and so I think one of the really\ninteresting things is like as we go\nthrough life it is very normal for us to\nform conclusions about how life Works\nhow people work\nright\nand then the interesting thing is that\nif we stop and re-examine our life we\ncan come to different conclusions\nyeah I agree\nwe're not we don't have to continue Okay\nthe reason I brought some of this stuff\nup in the first place I don't even know\nwhere this came from but I know I know I\nthink the one thing that I'm I'm trying\nto signal to you is a couple of things\none is that\nit seems like having sex and making love\nhas more to do with what's in the inside\nof you than it does I agree okay so\nthat's the first thing\nthe second thing is that and I'll tell\nyou why I'm even talking about this now\nbecause I mean I I have a reason why I\nthink this is important is that I'm\nconcerned Aiden that\nso I want to help you not be alone at\nthe age of 30 let alone 40 whatever okay\nand the thing is just based on once\nagain my experience and the whole point\nof having conversations is that we're\ngonna have different experiences of life\nwe're going to come to different\nconclusions right totally cool\nand then the neat thing is that\nmaybe I'm trying to tell you to get on a\nchair and you're just saying you or\nsorry what you're saying like don't\nclimb on the table and you're like no I\nWhen someone tells me to climb on the\ntable I got to climb on the table so I'm\nwondering if that's going on here but my\npoint is that I I think first of all\nyou're the way that you relate to women\nhas more to do with\nI feel like I'm getting a disconnection\nso sometimes when you talk about it it\nseems like your interactions with women\nare determined by them\nlike this person is this way because of\ntheir behavior this person is this way\nbecause of their behavior I don't judge\nI don't judge anybody based on their\npast I come from a up past I had\na whole face myself\nyou're just saying like right like go\nahead go ahead yeah I'm not necessarily\nsaying that you my point is that it's\ndetermined out there like women are\nthere are two types of women right\nthere's hoes in Queens 100 yes in my\ngeneration dog whatever whatever I'm I'm\nnot gonna that's not what I promise you\nand my point is that like you something\nwithin you determines whether you're\n or making love\nit's not just them right yeah and the\nreason that's important to me is because\nyou want to end up with someone that you\nwant to make love with\nthat's correct right and so then the\nquestion becomes if you want to end up\nwith someone that you want to make love\nwith\nand you can have feelings\nfor\nI'm trying to think of a word that's not\nhoe but I just can't think of anything\nall right so you so and my point is that\nthere could be a group of people like\nlike like\nthere could be someone out there that\nyou fall in love with that could be a\nsuccessful relationship\nand I say this as someone who's worked\nwith just to give you an example we\ndon't have to get more into this I don't\neven I just want you to understand one\nthing and you don't have to understand\nif you disagree is that you have a\ncontribution there's something in here\nthat determines the way that you relate\nto people\nwomen\nthat's all I want you to take away from\nthis and if we can agree on that we can\nmove on\num wait so say that last part again\nsomething in here\ndetermines your relationship with a\nwoman that's it\nthat's all I'm asking it's actually\nright here in my brain yes not my heart\nmy brain\nnothing in here changes your\nrelationship to women oh my penis no no\nyour heart I mean sure your penis your\nbrain\nI can't tell if you're joking or you\nreally don't think that they're like bro\ndoctor I get what you're saying you're\ncorrect I'm like everything you're\nsaying I get it I I told you I'm\nignorant based on perspectives in my\nlife I'm ignorant you're probably right\nthere's probably girls out there that\nhave had a whole past that are queens\nnow great but my perspective My\nGeneration there's some up girls\nwho up things and I and I try to\nnot put myself in that position so sure\nso so I I think that that like my point\nis that the way you all I'm get what are\nyou hearing me what do you hearing me\nconclude\nthat it's my heart\nthat basically is the reason why dear\nfuture women the the you what the first\ndivide them enough to clean the nose no\nno no no no yes so no no actually not\nexactly so here's what I'm saying all I\nwant you to just really think about yeah\nis that in a relationship with another\nhuman being that relationship is not\ndetermined by who they are it is\ndetermined what I feel\nthey bring a piece of it to the table\nand you bring a piece of it to the table\nokay yes okay and now we're gonna get to\nlike the stuff that we were talking\nabout earlier which is like the lack of\nsensitivity that you have so you feel\nnumb in some way\ncorrect Okay so\nit feels weird to go back here\nso what I'm cool with this bro we can go\nback to the other topic go ahead but but\nso so\nI'm just so derailed give me why why\nderailed\nthere's a whole different energy and\ndynamic to this Con the conversation we\njust had about relationships so the\nconversation we were having before I\nagree the energy definitely shifted doc\nI agree right right so it just takes me\na second to like\nmove away from that I was also\nthe language that you used changed the\nway that I felt in the conversation\nwell yeah I used follow and I use Queen\nyes yeah yeah so it's just that affects\nme yeah yeah why does it affect you\nwhy does it affect me or how does it\naffect me\nboth why and how does it affect you why\ndid that the first thing is that I feel\nuncomfortable and defensive being in a\nconversation where that language is\nbeing used\nthat's just our generation how we speak\nlike it's like you you said it when you\nfirst joined I'm a boomer I don't need I\ndon't need a reason I'm just sharing\nwith you why it's hard for me to make\nthe shift\nokay I'm just I know I'm just trying to\nleave that out there that's yeah that's\nthat's like you know you use that\nlanguage and and whatever you can call\nit generational if you want to\num I think it isn't huh I said I believe\nit's generational most people that yeah\nyou know and so that's just that that's\njust why it's hard for me to shift back\ninto like where we were before\nyeah\nit takes me a second yeah hell yeah so\nyou know because like here\nyou're schooling me about dating in your\ngeneration and that's a different feel\nfrom like let's talk about sadness\nloneliness I think that they're both\nactually really productive conversations\nI really appreciate you for having both\nof them with me like I feel honored to\nbe a part of both of those conversations\nalso scared to be a part of the last one\nbut like I can hold two feelings at the\nsame time right no don't don't be scared\nman it's just like I want people got to\nrealize like there's really modern day\npimping going on in the world like for\nexample these guys are now sounding only\nfans girls you know what I'm saying and\nit's like modern day pimping in a way\nyou know what I'm saying so it's like\nwhat's wrong with me being scared\nI guess you're right scared is good it's\na feeling yeah right I can be scared\nyeah I'm just saying my generation I\nappreciate you looking out for me so\nwhat I heard when you said that was that\nyou're like you're looking out for me\nand I like I felt the love there that\nwas that was nice of you thank you I got\nyou\ndoctor yeah\nno you're gonna ask I want to actually\nhear you ask\nI I was gonna ask you to remind me of\nwhat we were talking about and what\nfeels relevant to you\num I forgot we were talking about before\nI think the desensitized uh yeah\nso when we were talking about\nrelationships how did you feel\nit was honestly just interesting\nso interesting is I know it sounds kind\nof weird it's not really a very good\nword for a feeling I'm not trying to be\njudgmental there right sorry it's very\nbasic I agree right right so so like\nwhat do you think you were feeling in\nthat conversation\num\nI liked having that conversation because\nI like it's like\nI enjoyed it because\nit's\nit felt good well not good but it's just\nlike I I knew well yeah I mean it's just\nlike I I know I know the difference\nbetween well my perspective on life how\nI feel about certain women now that\nmight change when I'm older doctor that\nmight change when I'm 25 or 30. you know\nwhat I'm saying as of right now I just\nknow the difference between\nwhat I you know what I'm saying so let\ncan I share with you go ahead sorry no I\njust know the difference in my\ngeneration when between a hall and a\nqueen so here's what I felt from you\nemotionally I felt confidence\nI felt certainty\nI felt you being on sure-footing\nokay\nwhat do you think about that\nwhat's the last word you used sure\nfooting like you're on Solid Ground\nyeah yeah I'm standing on it for sure\nis that how you felt\nyeah\nright so so I like I think that there's\nsomething\nvery attractive about all of that\nbecause\nit makes you feel good\noh thank you you call me attractive\nI mean I'm unattractive for you\nokay right so like like do you see how\nlike emotionally there's no numbness\nwhen you're talking about that\nI do the numbness isn't in really\nconversation I like having conversations\nI feel from conversations\nlike\nthe numbness comes from\nI guess\ndaily life outside of conversations the\ndesensitization comes from that okay so\nI've detected numbness in you in our\nconversations but when we're talking\nabout other things so for example when\nyou say it is what it is\nI think that's you actually like numbing\nyourself out a little bit right because\nlike what are you gonna do about it\nright like that like there's no point in\nhaving the feeling\ncorrect and then the feeling goes away\nthat's right right so I think there's\nthere's numbness and like what I'm kind\nof noticing is that that that\nconversation about relationships was\nlike really Lively right it's like super\nenergetic I'm feeling uncomfortable\nyou're feeling on solid footing and so\nthat was like a little bit of reverse\nUno here where here I am talking about\nsadness and loneliness and I'm like\n I can swim in that all day\nand it was kind of like a it was like a\nreverse of our positions suddenly you're\na school and me\nI'm not trying to school you I just want\nto inform you I'm gonna say this and I\nmean this in like the kindest don't take\nit the wrong way please\nand I'm gonna say let's just let\nsomebody say it and I gotta say it and\nall right\nwhen I'm okay\nwhen I was 20 or not even me I'm not\nusing these in the sample I don't know\nwho's 20 years old in here\nsound ignorant\n20 20 year old in my generation is\nsmarter than a 20 year old than your\nguys generation\nokay\nand I'll explain why\nthey're more\nhow do I say it enhanced\nin a way like\nwe got this\nmy uncle doesn't know how to use a\n phone you know what I'm saying\nso it's like\nI don't want to say anything wrong way\nit's gonna sound so dumb I I really\ndon't want to like you gotta really\nunderstand I'm really bad at explaining\nthings but like\na 20 year old in my generation I feel\nlike in a way\nis more experienced\nthan a 20 year old and your generation\nso I think that like\ndoes that make sense\nso here's what I'm hearing\nso this conversation has the same energy\nto me as the last conversation that we\nhad which is sure-footing confidence\nyou really have a clear view of the\nworld and everything makes sense\nyes\nso I see a lot of excitement from you\nbut I I don't think that this is having\nthis conversation like you can school me\nall I don't mind being schooled by you\nby the way I'm not trying to spoil you\nI'm not trying to spoil you at all I'm\nnot I think I'm I'm gonna stop using\nthat word because that's I whatever my\npoint is that this conversation is going\nto be the same as before\nwhere I can ask you about your opinion\nit's going to go back and forth it\ndoesn't even matter the other thing it's\nnot about not even not agreeing whatever\nsure but I think the other thing is that\nin these conversations we're not talking\nabout you anymore\nyou're talking about Society you're\ntalking about Generations there's no\nroom in there for your experiences and\nyour personal feelings or mine\ndoes that make sense because we're\ncommenting about that over there\nwhat you're saying it doesn't make sense\nbut\nat the same time\nit's like that's why I kept saying it's\nmy perspective on the other on the other\ntopic I kept saying like I might sound\nignorant it might be ignorant I'm just\nsaying how I feel based off my\nexperiences sure sure so what would you\nlike to talk about Aiden\n[Music]\noh no\nuh well\nI was doing great this year lifting\nweights and losing weight and stuff\nand then I went through something\ntraumatic and then I started sipping\nlean\nyou started what sipping leaves sipping\ncoding in a promethazine promethazine\ncodeine and yeah\nand and what what makes that\nwhat what feels important about that to\nyou to talk about today\num because it's bad\nwhat's bad about it\nit's just like\nit's a fix that I did when I was going\nthrough something dramatic and I was\ndoing super good in the gym and it kind\nof like ruined a lot of things around me\nand uh\nit's just like a super super bad Reliant\nfix\nyou know what I mean\nit's just drugs it's like liquid heroin\nthat's what they call it so\nhave you considered seeing a\nprofessional about something like that\nI don't need so I haven't done it in a\ncouple months I stopped I wasn't highly\nhighly addicted but I was I was on it\nfor a while\nis it okay if I ask you a little bit\nabout seeing professionals like\nprofessional mental health people\nyeah whatever you want\nso I'm hearing that you it's not a\nproblem anymore so you don't need to see\na professional\nyeah I don't I don't think about it on\ncrave it at all I don't you know what I\nmean\nthen why talk about it\nI'm just giving you an update what I did\nthis year I was in the gym yeah yeah\nyeah yeah yeah yeah so just just kind of\nlike like this is what you went through\nyeah yeah and then I was on this path of\nkind of like in this I guess people\ncalled it the controversial era where\npeople that really don't know me that\naren't a part of my community that just\ndon't know me they would see these\narticles and things and just assume I\nwas an\num I would say things like there are two\ngenders in this world\num I made a tweet saying there are two\ngenders\nokay I won't be like this controversial\nera and that was labeled controversial\nso when I made a tweet saying there was\ntwo genders my talent agency dropped me\nfrom it they said you look what he\ntweeted this morning he said something\nsuper controversial\nand what what was what do you understand\ntell me about that what's what's going\non with that so I mean I I slow down I\nstepped out for making like tweets like\nthat and stuff but\nwhen I when I tweeted that out it hurt a\nlot of people I didn't do it to hurt\npeople\nI did it because a week before that\nTwitter was on my ass about something\nold my motive was like cool you guys\nwant to Target me for this\nI'm gonna make a tweet Twitter and show\nyou guys that because they were trying\nto cancel me for something cancel on\nTwitter so I was like okay watch I'm\nabout to make a controversial tweet try\nto cancel me now and it went it was my\ncrazy sweeping I was like\n600 000 likes of like millions and\nmillions of views\nand what what were you kind of is that\nkind of the same sort of like thing\nwhere it's like if someone tells you\ndon't do something you're like you\nI'm gonna do it not really I did it\nbecause I did a tweet because I knew it\nwould stir I knew people would like talk\nabout it I knew it would be\ncontroversial in my generation even\nthough it's not\num but I made a tweet because I wanted\nto show cancer culture you cancer\nculture watch and I did I tweet and now\npeople still\nI think it's like yeah\nlike people like it didn't matter like I\ndidn't get canceled what what makes you\nwant to do that\nI wanted to show people cancer\nculture it doesn't matter I'm gonna\ntweet out there's two genders they're\ngonna try to cancel me I didn't get\ncanceled\nI I understand that you wanted to show\npeople something what was driving you to\nprove your point\nthe Tweet when I tweeted it I knew it\nwas gonna stir so like I cancer culture\nwas trying to be on my ass oh what drove\nme to make that tweet was so like a week\nbefore cancer culture is on my ass\ntrying to cancel me on Twitter\nand I was like you can't sculpture\nI'm not gonna go for that so I'm gonna\ntweet out there's two genders and\nthey're even more mad\nokay so I'll I'll this is this is great\nmaybe we've hit our limit for the day\nbut maybe not so let me point something\nout to you so I'm asking you you engaged\nin a behavior right you tweeted\nsomething out\nyeah I'm asking you why did you do that\nand then the answer that you give me is\nsomething else outside of you right they\nwere trying to cancel you\nyeah okay so\nwhat I'm curious about\nis stuff in the outside world happens\nand then stuff in the outside world\nenters you\nand then something else happens\nand then you feel like doing something\nelse\nright like there's there's a\nthere's a stimulus from the outside\nworld and then there's a response from\nyou\nto the outside world with me yes I'm\nwith you what goes on in the middle like\nwhat happens within you when they try to\ncancel you like does that like that's\nwhat I'm asking I'm curious about what\nhow does one action that is done to you\nresult in a response from you why did\nyou do that instead of\napologizing or any other of the thousand\nthings that you could have done\nI think maybe just the table thing we\ntalk about like I like doing the\nopposite I I like people most people\nwould fold and apologize I didn't I\ndidn't care I got banned from twitch\nthat's soft\none-sided platform you know what I'm\nsaying so I was like twitch\n up the this and that led to\nmore more stuff you know what I'm\nsaying so\num in my opinion I just think why would\nI apologize for saying there's two\ngenders there are two genders so it's\nlike I did it yeah yeah so so like when\nyou say why would you do that do you do\nI feel emotional energy when you make\nthat statement\nbut why though I'm saying like you you\nsaid like Logic No I'm just trying to\nask you like why why did you why why\nthough when I when you asked like why\ndidn't you just apologize or do another\nroute it's because they're like what\nwould I be apologizing for sure I'm not\nsuggesting that you should apologize\nwhat I'm kind of pointing out is that so\nthis is where I think the emotional\nnumbness comes in so generally speaking\nwhen when someone says something to me\nit affects me in some way\nand then my drive to act\nand the way in which I act\nis shaped by my internal environment\nright so someone says you all Oak\nyou're an and then I S and then\nI can feel one of two different things I\ncan feel ashamed and if I feel ashamed I\nwill apologize\nor I can feel angry I can feel affronted\nI can feel territorial\nand then if I feel angry affronted in\nterritorial I will turn around and I\nwill say screw you\ndoes that make sense it does make sense\nthe behavior and and the weird thing is\nthat the Mind actually the logic follows\nthe emotion not the other way around\nI just think yeah yeah I actually agree\nwith that right so so if we're talking\nabout emotional numbness I I mean I'm\njust picking this as a random I don't\ncare what happened on Twitter honestly I\ndon't yeah you know but I think that\nlike what I'm kind of pointing out to\nyou is that\nthe earlier you talked about being\naddicted to the high of grinding\nand we're talking a little bit about how\nyou have some of these feelings and\nyou're not quite sure what to do with\nthem and you you sort of like you you do\na good job actually right so you learn\nhow to crack jokes you learn how to like\naccept it is what it is you can't\nnecessarily change it there's no kind of\nno point in worrying but the worry is\nstill there at the back of your mind\nand what I'm pointing out to you is that\na lot of your behaviors even jumping up\non the table\nI'm not sure how much in control of that\nyou are\nwhat do you mean so like if someone says\nAiden don't jump on the table\nI don't know that you can control\nwhether you jump on the table or not\nno I I definitely could show a doctor\nthat's like why like my whole life is\nlike where I am today I think not\nlistening to what everyone's doing have\nyou ever seen a picture of it's like but\ncan you listen\nso what to what other people tell you to\ndo\nof course but like I have to I have to\nexperience it myself like that's how I\nso then I'm hearing that you can't until\nyou experience it\nyeah I mean I can listen but I mean I'm\nstill going to probably want to do it\nmyself yeah right so so when you want to\ndo something most people are like that\nthough like for example like\nwhen you grow up when I grew up as a kid\nsorry when I grew up I'm gonna start I'm\ngonna stop over generalizing when I grew\nup as a kid\nI was curious right like I when I was in\nhigh school I would sneak out and I\nwould go to a party like that's just me\nbeing curious even though my dad was\nlike yo don't do that like you don't\nhave to you know what I'm saying like I\njust think\nit's about when you're when you're when\nI'm curious so let me ask you something\ndo you control the Curiosity or does the\nCuriosity control you\nit's a good question I think the\nCuriosity controls me\nwhat do you think about that\nit's not good doc but I mean a lot of\npeople have that you know a lot of it's\nlike it's 50 50. I think I think it's\ncuriosity controls you or you control\ncuriosity so everyone's different I\nthink I don't know what I don't know why\nI think it's perspective how you grew up\nbut I think yeah so so if I can share\nsomething yeah go ahead\nso I want to try to catch a couple\nthings that you say so other people like\nthat are generalizations I'm gonna\nactually move in the opposite direction\nI don't care about how other people I\ndon't give a okay what I'm\ninterested in in this conversation is\nyou and what your experience is so\nwhether other people or whatever happy\nunhappy good bad whatever right\nwe're just talking about you and I yeah\nyeah\nand and I think that some of what this\nemotional numbness I think that this is\nconnected because generally speaking we\ncan't control something unless we're\naware of it\nyes right so all you have to do is go to\nthe dentist and if you can't feel your\nmouth\nright so numbness\nand lack of awareness leads to a lack of\ncontrol\ncorrect\nand so what I'm kind of noticing is that\nyou engage in behaviors that\nfeel righteous right like in your mind\nthey're logical and stuff I'm not saying\nthey're not logical it's not my place to\nbe the Arbiter of logic and determine\nwhat is right or wrong whether it has to\ndo with relationships whether queens and\nhoes like whatever I'm not the Arbiter\nof Truth\nwhat I'm hearing from you though is that\nthere is a internal dimension\nthat doesn't get a whole lot of play in\nthe way that you interact with the world\nright these people did this so I'ma do\nthis this person said don't do this so\nI'm gonna tell I'm gonna do the exact\nopposite sounds like some people that\nrelationships that you feel emotionally\nconnected to you can actually listen to\nthem if your dad tells you hey Aiden\ndon't do this mom says don't do this you\ncan like set that aside yeah I can't I\nconsider the side but I still kind of I\nget curious you know what I mean like\nit's like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so so\nI mean I think curiosity is beautiful\nbut my point is that like\nI I don't the thing that I'm worried the\nmost about is that I don't know if\nyou're in control of your life\nI think you have a lot of power\nand I think you've managed to probably\ncontrol all of these external Dimensions\nso it sounds like you've got Financial\nSecurity it sounds like you have freedom\nit sounds like you have a lot of stuff\nout there\nbut I still get the sense that you are a\npuppet to yourself\n100 I agree with you on that I'm a\npuppet to my to my career literally I'm\na puppet to my chat I swear to God I am\nwhat do you wanna is that okay how do\nyou feel about it no I don't like it at\nall\nI hate it but\nit is what it is Doc what'd you just do\nthere I I did it I did a doctor right\nyeah yeah yeah what'd you do\nI I try to avoiding I tried like\navoiding the the the feeling of it by\nputting a pause like a little is it is\nwhat it is on the on the so what what\ndid you push away\nI pushed away the truth when what is the\ntruth\nthat I'm a puppet how does that feel it\nsucks\nsucks in what way\nit hurts dog\nso let me toss some stuff out okay all\nright what I'm hearing there is\npowerlessness\ntrue\nand when I hear you at the age of 40 you\ndon't know\nif you're going to be alone or not\npowerlessness there too\noh no I mean you're not going to know\nwhat you're doing by 45 doctor to be to\nbe honest nobody nobody knows what what\nyou know what I'm saying logically no\none can predict the future I\nagree with you Aiden when I'm saying the\nemotional energy okay okay is\npowerlessness right because you're like\n 99 of people treat me as Aiden Ross\nthere's one percent and let me ask you\nsomething what's more common Aiden\nqueens or hoes\nand what does that mean for your future\nI'm\nwhat is the emotion that goes with I'm\nit is what it is\n[Laughter]\nright\nit's powerlessness yeah and so here's\nthe crazy thing okay now I'm gonna kind\nof like\nI'm gonna try to say this okay and\nreject it if you want to reject it so\nit's my belief\nthat your like all of these things that\nyou're scared of\nyou got to stop running away from them\nyeah\nright so like if you admit to yourself\nI am powerless then you can do something\nabout it right you gotta meet yourself\nwhere you're at gotcha right like you\ngotta say like when people you know the\npeople who get divorced are the ones who\ndon't think that their marriage has a\nproblem the people who say this marriage\nis on its last legs we gotta either bust\nit or try to save it you have to admit\nyou have to accept the truth of what you\nfeel God even even though if it's the\nhard truth you still gotta accept it\nabsolutely right and I see you doing\nthat I don't see you running away from\nit in a way yeah I can accept it like if\nit's in my face and I feel it I I'm not\nscared to accept the truth I'm really\nnot yeah so I hear you kind of saying it\nis what it is but then you're still\nmoving away from it you're not actually\nmoving towards it and and that's where\nlike as you start to feel that\npowerlessness I think you're gonna find\nright and now I'm\n making a mistake here but I'm\ngonna I think you're gonna find as you\nget in touch with your feelings that a\nlot of this stuff is active when you\nbecause like when you're talking to a\ngirl\nI think there's a lot going on inside\nyou and the thing is like if you kind of\nthink about it like you've got you've\ngot one really good trump card I could\nbe wrong right so you can tell me hey\nthis is the generation you're wrong Dr K\nyou don't know what it's like so you can\ntell me I'm wrong I'm going to admit\nthat all I want you to do is think and\npay attention to yourself because once\nyou start labeling people\nas this or this you suddenly become\nreally protected right because the\nsecond you label someone a hoe if you\nfall in love with her that love ain't\nnever gonna hurt you\nit allows you to push her away it allows\nyou to like set yourself apart it allows\nyou to avoid connections and\nvulnerability\nyes you're right\nand and so like the thing is and so the\ncrazy thing is that if your mind\nhas an ulterior motive to protect you\nfrom your emotions\nit'll like screw something else up\nthat's good though it's just it's\ndefense you're right it's defense but\nthe question is who's in control\nare you clear-headed or are these things\nworking behind the scenes\nI mean\ngood way to put it I guess I just think\nthat like\nno I mean that is that is really good\nway to put it because I don't know if\nI'm fully in control or not you're right\nright and and so all I want for you to\ndo this like I want you to have whatever\nyou want\nthank you doctor I appreciate that\nreally like yeah you know and and I\nthink like dude you've accomplished so\nmuch at the age of 22.\nand so like this is where like what\nyou're kind of saying you don't have any\npassion for what's left because I think\nyou're right you beat the game you\nfigured out how to succeed\nmaterialistically\nthat's now what\nnow you're where you know who got them\nBuddha is nope you know who what\nBuddhism is\nthat's the guys with the bellies right\nyeah it's the guys with the bellies so\nI'm gonna tell you a story okay okay\nso there's once a prince in India\nand his name was Gotham his name was\nGotham okay and Gotham had it all so\nwhen he was actually about your age\nhe was the prince of a powerful Kingdom\nhe was loved he was respected he had a\nqueen like a real queen who had given\nhim a healthy son\noh shoot okay and so he every everything\nin life we had heard\neverything in life that he had heard was\nlike okay if you're unhappy the problem\nis that you're dating hoes not Queens\nthe problem is if you're unhappy it\nmeans you don't have enough power if\nyou're unhappy you need more money you\nneed more Financial Security you need a\nLambo you can't be driving no\nToyota you need a Lambo all of these\nthings will make you happy\nand then that worked for everybody else\nright because if I'm trying to drive in\na Toyota and I don't have a Lambo I have\nsomething to reach towards I have\nsomething that gives me a sense of\nprogress right there's some way of\nkeeping score and that feels really good\npsychologically to feel like you're\nmaking progress but then he had\neverything\nand one day he woke up and he was\nunhappy\nand then he's\nbecause what does he do now\nright like how do I find happiness if I\nhave the lambo I I have a queen I have a\nchild I'm a prince of a powerful Kingdom\nI'm like what everyone else craves in\nthe world is what I already have and I'm\nstill unhappy\nso he did something really weird he gave\nit all up and he's like I gotta figure\nthis out and so then he went to\nthese spiritual teachers and gurus and\nall this kind of stuff like looking for\nanswers and then what they basically\nwhat he kind of discovered was that\nthere's a lot of like internal work done\nif you tell me that you've beaten the\ngame I think you beat your external game\nbeating that show again the\nmaterialistic yeah but they're still\nemotional and they're still like a\nthey're still like that type of thing I\nhave to master I think I think that's\nthe game that like and this is what\nhappens is there's also this really\ninteresting kind of\num\nsaying which is that you can't meditate\non an empty stomach\nand that if you really look at it\nthere's other stories I can tell you but\nconquering them so I tried to become a\nmonk when I was 21. oh nice and I went\nto my teachers and I said I'm ready to\ngive up my life and become a monk and I\nwant to devote myself to spirituality in\nthis internal game okay what happened my\nteacher said\nwhat do you mean give up you've got\n nothing you have nothing to give\nup you're a failure at life\nyo you have nothing worth giving up so\nthey said get your ass back to and this\ngoes back to Harvard okay so now we're\ngonna come full circle so when I was 18\nyears old I decided I was going to be\npre-med and I wanted to go to Harvard\nMedical School just like all the Indian\nkids and I was gonna be the smartest\n doctor and I was gonna have the\nbiggest swinging dick and I was\ngonna be a Chad and all that kind of\nstuff and I ended up failing a bunch of\nclasses because I didn't know what the\n I was doing\nthen I go to India\nand my teachers tell me you have nothing\nworth giving up get your ass back to\nAmerica finish your studies and do the\nbest that you can finish a doctoral\ndegree and then at the age of 30 if you\nwant to give all that up and you\nwant to take your vows we'll take you\nand so on that day Aiden I was like you\nand I said these these\ndon't think I can do it I'ma show them\nso I went back I didn't give a\nabout Harvard\nI just wanted to be able to give up the\nbiggest thing and so I put my put myself\nfully into my studies\nlike went to med school I didn't even\nshow up at my award ceremony because it\nnever dawned on my mind that I would get\nan award for being at the top of one of\nthe classes I love Batman that's amazing\nand like\nthey were all so smart because they\nrealized like being a monkey ain't for\nme because they're good at that kind of\n and I think that where you are\nright now is like you've got to start\nthis journey\nand like it's the journey to be happy\nand no amount I hate to break it to you\nbut finding this magical human being out\nthere it'll bring you happiness of the\ntime but then you're going to beat that\ngame too you're still gonna wake up\nunhappy wow you're right damn so that I\nmean the happiness comes from so the\nhappiness does come from being alone\nokay well no not being alone but I would\nsay happiness comes within\nlike you're like you could be you could\nbe alone and be happy like you could be\nlike you don't have to be with somebody\nto rely on happiness or anything like\nthat you could you could do it yourself\nyeah yeah I mean and I think that's what\nyou're going to discover and I think\neven if you look at your own life you're\ngonna discover that there are two kinds\nof happiness that you've experienced\ncorrect one is gonna be like this\ndopaminergic happiness and one is like a\nquieter kind of thing\nright\nand this numbness that you've got is\nlike getting in the way of feeling that\ndamn\nall right I gotta find the spiritualness\nI was spiritual at one point I was I was\nvery spiritual I lost it I gotta get it\nback I need light I need to find it\nyeah I think you're gonna be fine the\none thing I would recommend for you is\njust catch yourself anytime you say it\nis what it is and whatever you feel just\nlike let yourself feel it it doesn't\nhave to have any implication it doesn't\nneed to be logiced out just close your\neyes and just let it be there without\npushing it away without doing anything\nwith it just sit with it okay\nI'm gonna do that doctor I mean like any\ntime it is what it is I'm just gonna be\nlike no it's not it is what it is face\nit\nsharp yeah yeah\nthat's a step in the right direction\nbut even then there's a cultivation of\nemotion there right because you're like\nER I'm gonna conquer it I can see you're\nmoving around quite a bit you don't like\nwe're done I'm ADHD do you want to leave\nme already\nuh\nI thought that I was getting I'm getting\nphysical signals from you that you've\nprobably hit some kind of limit I just\nhave ADHD doctor let me stand up a\nlittle bit no\nI mean I I think it's okay to be done\nwhat do you think\nabout it\num my head is okay I just enjoyed it\num yeah so how do you feel when I'm\nyou're leaving me already doctor\nit's a joke sure I I completely agree\nthat you are using humor as a defense\nmechanism related no I mean I mean like\nit doesn't matter if you leave it or not\nit's like whatever I move on I'm gonna\nhave Spain okay but I mean like it's\nlike I meant that as a joke sorry my bad\nmaybe I'm over interpreting\nI like to in terms of uh stepping away\nso Aiden I find that like two hours is a\nlike I feel like we're in a good pausing\npoint and opening up a new chapter would\nbe a commitment to like another hour or\ntwo okay I'm down to do this again\nwhat um can you help me understand what\nyour experience of this conversation was\na lot I think you're actually starting\nto change my perspective on how I feel\nuh the the most important thing I gain\nout of this whole thing is it is what it\nis is unacceptable stop accepting stop\nsaying it is what it is and I think it's\ntime to really just\njust let it do its thing it's okay\nyeah\nyeah\nand and um what I got from this\nconversation first of all Aiden I think\nyou're just\nyou're a remarkable human being who's\nbeen dealt a really good and really\nshitty hand at the same time it's rare\nto see nice so if we're playing you know\nif we're playing some poker I got a nice\nmaybe like a two pair like a you know\nwhat I'm saying yeah I I think I think\nyour life defies poker analogies like I\ncan't if I I was thinking about poker\nspecifically you know it's like one of\nthese hands that like is really strong\nand really weak at the same time like\nthere's there's a lot of stuff that a\nlot of you've been through man yeah\na lot of hurt and also like a lot of\nexceptionalism yeah a lot of growth\nyeah and and I think that\nI've also learned about what it's like\nto be a part of your generation I'm\nyou're you know you're teaching me about\nwhat gender Dynamics and stuff are like\nfor for some people like like doctor\nthere's my generation is so cooked bro\nyou can now like kids in school they're\nlearning about like they didn't push\nlike weird agendas and it's like\n up\nit's\nyeah I know it's yeah you know what I'm\ntalking about it's like I just\nhate like my generation is just ass\nsad I\nI I I think that you're I I don't feel\nthat way but I I think it's totally fine\nfor you to feel that way I think your\ngeneration is getting crushed honestly\nyeah yeah yes so I I think they're just\ntrying to do the best they can with the\nhand that they were dealt and I was\naddicted to video games and like video\ngames weren't even that addictive when I\nwas growing up it's way worse now\nso nah nah nah doctor the best games\nwere Call of Duty Black Ops 2\nall them now it's ass\nall right so so another place where we\nagreed to disagree\nbut Call of Duty Black Ops man\nthat's the best game of all time Black\nOps 2.\nyou should check out a game called have\nyou played bg3\nno Alders gate three okay well it's it's\nokay for people to like different kinds\nof food and different kinds of games we\ndon't I don't know that we need to argue\nabout it but maybe one day if we really\nwant to throw down we can what's your\nfavorite food\nI love Indian food by the way Mata\npaneer is so good with non garlic naan\nit's amazing yeah it's good stuff it's\njust one I can't I never have leftovers\nI put my fridge it stinks up the whole\nhouse for like three days but I love it\nit'll do that stink up the armpits too\nyeah but I love Indian food by the way\nbut what's your favorite food though\nwhat do you mean by favorite the food\nthat I enjoy eating the most yeah yeah I\nmean that's my favorite is right we\nparticularly like to eat\num so back when I was a monk I detested\nthis particular kind of food that not I\nmean I wasn't a monk but back in my\ntraining days I started to fall in love\nwith like a rice and lentil this dish\ncalled khichdi and it's the kind of\nthing that like it's weird it's like the\nreal super Bland but by the end of\neating that stuff every single day I\nabsolutely loved it it's some of the\nmost enjoyable\nfood that I've eaten\num but I'm a big fan of like Tex-Mex\nso I've got a couple of favorites so I\nreally like like tacos I really like uh\nBonnie Puris and other Indian food it's\none of my favorite Indian foods\num have you ever had have you ever had\nwhat I'm talking about the veneer\nI I don't know what the first word is\nbut I'm pretty sure I've had it\nmocked up come here it's like\nit's like this dish m-a-t-a\nwhere are you from Aiden\nFlorida okay\nokay where are you from Doctor Texas\nwhat part of Texas I'm in Houston\nbasically H-Town yeah Houston's cool I\nthink Austin's really fun too have you\never been to Austin I have I went to\nschool there\nreally yeah\nsweet I was actually gonna go to college\nthere doctor that's like where they\nwanted me to go to college UT they want\nto go to the UT yeah I think you would\nhave been great there well the community\ncollege first and then UT I would\ntransfer sure\noh my God I didn't do it right oh you\nwant to leave now yes\nall right is that okay that's okay I\ngive you permission yeah I appreciate it\nI I I don't I'm not trying to pull out\nbut I also like if the point where we're\ntalking about what's my favorite food\nand stuff I'm totally down to like hang\nout sometime I'll take you out for\nIndian food like that's totally cool I'm\nnot trying to\num\nI don't want to reject you\nand at the same time\nI'm married with two kids and it's a\nweekday so I do have concerns on my time\nyeah I completely understand\num all right doctor I'll let you get to\nyour family and your normal life thank\nyou so much I like to do this again you\nknow you had me sign a form I usually\nhate girls with NBAs you hit me with\nlike a consensual form and stuff what's\ngoing on there last question totally\nfine um I think we were doing some back\nand forth but then you all ended up\nbeing okay with it\num so the main thing is that we just\nwant people to really understand that\nthis is not therapy right so we'll we'll\nthere's something called informed\nconsent and that's really the most\nimportant part of the form and then\nthere's also some legal stuff so like\nfor example\nthis may get uploaded to uploaded to\nYouTube uh what's your channel by the\nway what's your camera GG healthy gamer\nokay so this may get uploaded to YouTube\nand so just that you consent for that to\nhappen and stuff like that so and then\nwe also have a policy where if you want\nsomething taken down you just message us\nand we'll take it down I think generally\nspeaking people we've had we've\ninterviewed a couple hundred people and\nyou know most of them are pretty happy\nyeah wait are you a lot of talk about\nthe other clients\nI don't\nI'm saying like allowed to no no I'm\nsaying like who have you interviewed\nthat I would know Myspace if you\ninterviewed anybody in Myspace before I\ndon't know what what your space is what\ndo you mean by your space streamer like\na streamer yes we've interviewed many\nstreamers train wrecks I've had several\nconversations with train wrecks train is\nfantastic he's amazing I love training\nhe's such a good guy\nis that me or him\nchat\nwas that him\nAiden\nbrah\nI can't hear you bro\nI'm hearing robot voice\nhold on a second\nlet me see if I can go to oh there we go\nwe're back okay Doctor go to sleep okay\nyour family this is the universe's way\nof telling us that this is a good\nstopping point good luck to you Aiden\nyou too we could do this again we'll do\nit again yeah sure let's let our our\npeople talk okay all right thank you so\nmuch man all right have a good time\nokay\nall right so\num\nokay so let's talk about a couple things\nso I want you all to be careful about a\ncouple of things okay\nso the first is like\nthis cooked and you got him like it's\nnot a contest there isn't a winner and\nthere isn't a loser\nright like we do this to have\nconversations with people\nand like I want y'all to really\nunderstand that this is\nI I really hope that watching this will\nhelp y'all although if you choose not to\nhave a little bit more compassion I\nwon't blame you to be honest I really\nwon't\nbut like\nyou know Behavior happens for a reason\nso we didn't really get into this with\nAiden because I don't think it's the\ntime yet but if we talk about let's say\npromiscuity right so I've worked with\npeople who are like sex and love addicts\nand I think that there's just a lack of\nunderstanding that human beings are like\ncomplex organisms\nand you can have a behavior like\npromiscuity\nwhich can have all kinds of reasons for\nit\nright so like just let's just run\nthrough top reasons why people are\npromiscuous number one they have low\nself-esteem\nand so\nit's a badge of honor to be able to get\nlaid in some way right there's an\nobjective\nsense of like Oh I'm a better human\nbeing because I got laid\nand so like your sense of self-worth\ngets determined by engaging this in this\nBehavior\nright number two reason that people have\nsex is because they're afraid of being\nalone\nright so if there's like abandonment\nfears and this is what I really see in a\nlot of like my my patients that I've\nworked with who had sex and love\naddiction that sex begins to mean\nadditional things I can't get people to\nlove me and in the past when people have\nloved me they've abandoned me or they've\nhurt me but I've got one trump card I\ncan play to get people to stay\nright which is why your toxic ex is\nhappy to put out when you guys haven't\ntalked to each other for six months\nbecause it's how y'all get\nentangled again\nand and so this is the the big thing and\nI don't know if Aiden's paying attention\ntotally cool if you are bro loved it\nright but your internal environment is\nsomething that a lot of us are blind to\nand so then we sort of develop some of\nthese coping mechanisms where I know it\nsounds kind of weird but there's\nactually research that shows that coping\nmechanisms lead to poor outcomes\ncoping mechanisms can make your life\nworse and why is that it sounds really\nweird right because everyone's like\nlearn to cope like you meditate like oh\nlike meditate more like meditate your\nproblems away\nbut the reason for that is that when we\ncope when something's bothering me in\nlife and I learn how to cope I no longer\nneed to fix it because it's not\nbothering me anymore\nthis is why people in abusive\nrelationships end up addicted to\nsubstances\nbecause this person hurts me and I can\nmake the hurt go away by using drugs or\nsubstances or Tick Tock whatever\nand then as I make those feelings go\naway I tolerate the relationship coping\nis not fixing\nnow coping mechanisms healthy the\nhealthy use of judicious use of healthy\ncoping mechanisms leads to positive\noutcomes so there's like it's more to it\nokay\nbut for like you know I I just really\nask y'all\nthat there are going to be people out\nthere who will piss you off have very\nstrong World Views and we can kind of\nsee it right like what is the what is\nengaging in the world view do\nyou can try to logic and argue and like\nboth of us realize hey like no one's\n learning anything here\nbut think about how it feels to engage\nin that I love it too\nI love it\nbecause there's a part of me that's like\nthis guy doesn't know what the he's\ntalking about\nhe has no clue but what is that that's\narrogance on my part it feels good to be\narrogant who am I to say that this kid\nhas no clue\nso don't get into stupid arguments with\npeople and if you get into stupid\narguments with people start to think a\nlittle bit about what this does for you\nwhen I get to into arguments with idiots\nI feel better about myself\nand since I'm feeling crap about myself\nI can do two things I can go bully\nsomeone or I can get some dumbass on the\ninternet into an argument that is\nindefensible and Bully them and then I'm\ngonna see all my stuff get upvoted I'm\ngonna see um their stuff get downvoted\nand then I'm gonna feel good about\nmyself and once I feel good about myself\nI'm not gonna make any changes in my\nlife because my life is and instead\nof fixing that I can school noobs on the\ninternet\nthis is what happens on the internet\nso think a little bit about your\ninternal environment\nand what drives you to do the things\nthat you do\nand it's not my place to say that the\nworld is one way or isn't one way like I\nreally don't know like literally I do\nnot know\nthere's all kinds of conflicting\nresearch all kinds of conflicting\nperspectives\nall you can really know is what's in\nhere this is the only place that you can\nhave perfect information the rest of it\nis like questionable\nand so don't worry about all that crap I\nmean I think you should try to do good\nin the world right so I'm not saying\nlike abandon the world but for\nsake start with yourself\nstart by trying to be happy start by\ntrying to understand yourself start by\ncrafting your own destiny instead of\nbeing a puppet to your internal drives\nif if Aiden was a puppet to anyone else\nhe'd be fine he can handle anyone\nexcept himself\nand that's like\nThat's The Human Condition\nand and please y'all don't look I'm not\nsaying people shouldn't be held\naccountable for their actions I have no\nidea you know\nlike I don't know like I don't follow\nthe guy on Twitter\nit's not my place to pass a judgment\nthat's not what we're here for\nand for those of y'all that think that\nthis interview was like a mistake or\nwhatever like you're allowed to say that\nand if you all don't want us to\ninterview certain kinds of people like\nthat's fine like I'm not saying that's\nfine as in like you're led to have your\nI mean like please let us know and like\ntell us right hey I think this is\nharmful for these these these we're not\nhere to hurt people we're here to help\npeople\nbut one thing that like we're just here\nto talk to human beings\nand like I believe\nthat there's a decent human inside\n99.9 of people I've met a couple people\nin my clinical work that just there's I\njust don't think there's a decent human\nin there I gotta say that right not\nI'm not such a dumb idealist that I\nthink everyone can be saved but for\n sake we we could do way better\nthan we're doing\nright some people are just so\nneurologically like\nimpaired in their lives is just I mean\nwe're talking about like severe trauma\nor brain injuries or all kinds of other\nstuff there's all kinds of stuff that\nlike maybe people can't change\nbut\nyou know like\npeople like me people like Aiden we can\nchange\nand y'all can change too\nright and it's it's like it's not my\nplace to say that you should change in\nthis way like if you believe that there\nare only two Sexes or genders or\nwhatever like that's false and here's\nthe signs and we can have that\nconversation one day if y'all want to\nbut it's useless I mean it's not useless\nI'd take that back it's that's dumb it\nis not the conversation that I am gifted\nat having\nand what I want you all to do more than\nanything else\nis think about yourselves and think\nabout like what's going on inside me\nbecause if you want freedom in this\nworld it's not going to come from the\nworld it's going to come from you\nyou can't control anything outside of\nyou and boy if you want to lose freedom\nin your life the quickest way to lose\ncontrol of your life is to try to\ncontrol another human being\nbecause when you try to control another\nI don't want this person to break up\nwith me you compromise yourself I will\ndo whatever I need to to stop this\nperson from breaking up with me and\nthat's when they control your life\nlet people do what they want I'm not\nsaying you should tolerate\nabuse\nright but also I've worked with people\nwho have had to tolerate abuse for a\nTime\nand the whole problem with abuse is that\nwe try to get people to stop instead of\nleaving\nanyway\nso like learn about yourselves y'all\nthere's so much power in this world that\nyou can find in here and I'm not talking\nabout like\nlike finding your inner Qi I'm talking\nabout like literally if you just\nunderstand the effect of your emotions\non your behaviors this whole thing where\nit's like you know stuff comes into\nAiden and stuff just flows right out\nthere's no like modification internally\nthe capacity to internally modify the\ncapacity to respond instead of react\nthat's what you all should focus on\nlet whatever comes in comes in we can't\nreally control that I can do some magic\nin here and then what comes out can be\ndifferent\nand when you start controlling what\ncomes out of you then your life will\nchange\nbecause that's all you can control\nand we waste so much energy\ntrying to control everything else\nyeah I still meditate\nnot yoga every day but\nokay\nall right y'all so I want to thank y'all\nI and I I mean I wasn't watching\ncomments too carefully but I really hope\nthat you all were kind and compassionate\nthat's what we're really here for\num\nI don't know if this is against TOs\nI'm not quite sure what to do about that\nbut I mean I guess if we get you know\nanyway the cat's out of the bag now\num and I I think that like\nsometimes people will use language that\nwe don't agree with or appreciate with\nand like we can sort of let them know\nthat but\nyou know I don't know and and I\napologize if anyone's been hurt by you\nknow the language that Aiden used or I\nused for that matter I mean who knows I\nmay have used toxic language that's not\nreally my intention at all and so I\nhonestly I'm like sorry if anyone's been\nhurt by anything in stream today\nincluding including me ranting at you\nright\num so I really appreciate everybody\ncoming today my Hope from the bottom of\nmy heart is that we've been able to\nincrease awareness and understand\nourselves a little bit better I really\nhope that someone has benefited from\nthis I've certainly benefited from it I\nhope Aiden benefits some from it I hope\nall y'all benefit from it as well and\nthat's what we do here so if you all are\nnew\nthis is what we do we talk to people and\nwe have Frank conversations with people\nand like\nyou know it's my belief that like\nengaging people in dialogue is like\nreally a really positive way forward I\nmean that's what I do in my day job and\nit works pretty well\nand so I know that the internet is\njudgmental and I'm not saying that there\nshouldn't be accountability but that's\njust not I'm not a judge it's not my\nplace to cancel someone or not cancel\nsomeone\nso that's like outside of my purview\nlet the smart people who know more about\nthe difference between right and wrong\nfigure that out\nand um I have no idea when we're going\nto be streaming next I'm sure that it's\nsomewhere but frankly chat I'm fried\nlike just fried\nand it's not that's not a bad thing it's\njust I've hit my limit\nfor what I can do today\nthank you all very much for coming\nand uh\nwe hope to see you again\nthank you"
