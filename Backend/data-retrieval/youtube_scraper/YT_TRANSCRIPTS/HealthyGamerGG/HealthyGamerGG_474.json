    "transcript": "so let's understand what is ego when you\nsay I am dot dot dot anything that comes\nafter the I am dot dot dot is part of\nyour ego anything on your resume is part\nof your ego so ego is a construct it is\nnot actually who you are or what you are\nso I can say that I am a doctor but that\nis not a real thing you can't biopsy me\nand find a doctor you can't like x-ray\nme and find a doctor I was me before I\nwas a doctor and I'm me after I was a\ndoctor so how can being a doctor be a\npart of who I truly am what it is is a\npart of ego right it is a construction\nthat I wrap around myself and the really\ninteresting thing about this is like\nonce you discover that you are not I'm\nnot really a doctor like I wasn't born a\ndoctor and it has value don't get me\nwrong so the ego serves a purpose but\nit's not truly who you are so then the\nquestion becomes okay well who am I and\nthe cool thing about that is if anything\nthat is related to Ego is not who you\nare it's incredibly liberating"
