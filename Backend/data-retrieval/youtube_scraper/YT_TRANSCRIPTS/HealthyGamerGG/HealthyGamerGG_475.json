    "transcript": "from a yogic perspective someone who\nbelieves that they are a failure has a\nbig ego and you may say well hold on a\nsecond what is that like I thought\npeople who are failures have small egos\nno their sense of self is very strong I\nam a failure and that's a defining part\nof who they are so their ego is actually\nquite large it is the ego of failure or\nsuccess or whatever I am a like I am a\ndoctor I am a failure it's still I am\nand then a very big thing and then think\nabout how that shapes their thoughts\ntheir emotions and their actions when an\nopportunity arises hey I really think\nthat you'd be a great fit for like this\njob or hey I heard that so-and-so has a\ncrush on you you should really think\nabout asking them out and even if you're\nattracted to that person and you want\nthat job your ego will step in and it\nwill say they wouldn't take you you'll\nscrew it up anyway they're not\ninterested in dating you so your sense\nof self\ndefines the way that you interact with\nthe world"
