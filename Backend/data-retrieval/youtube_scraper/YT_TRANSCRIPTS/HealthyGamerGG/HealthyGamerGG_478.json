    "transcript": "the biggest problem that most streamers\nmake since sacrifice has caused you to\ngrow you assume that it is sacrifice\nthat will continue to grow yeah whereas\nthe big Revelation that we've had and I\nthink this is what you would also agree\nwith because most consumers agree with\nthis is that when you're actually like\nnot tired and exhausted and you feel\npretty good about yourself your streams\nare actually like higher energy more\nenjoyable and you actually do like\nbetter in the numbers there's that fear\ndriver that if I stop doing this then\npeople will slip away but that's the big\nParadox is that actually being well\nrested will bring more people in but the\nproblem is that that fear that if I take\na break like everyone will disappear if\nyou take extended breaks and like\nconsistency is important so there's\nabsolutely like a big part of like\nconsistency is a huge part in taking\nbreaks extended breaks is very damaging\nfor streaming and even if some people\nare able to successfully do it those\npeople are outliers the majority of\nstreamers need to stream consistently in\norder to keep their numbers or grow\nthat's absolutely true"
