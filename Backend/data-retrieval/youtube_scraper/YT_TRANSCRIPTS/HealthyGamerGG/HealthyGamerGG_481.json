    "transcript": "why do you think it's easier for you to\nemotionally connect to anime I think\njust because to me it feels like a safe\nspace when you're watching a fictional\npiece of work because it's fictional it\nfeels like there won't be any judgments\nor anything like that maybe you know\nlike I said I you know grew up in a\nculture where you know showing emotions\nwas like not like kind of like frowned\nupon maybe not frowned upon but\ndefinitely definitely not openly\naccepted as much as it is today\num so I guess like fiction and Anime in\nparticular just became like my safe\nhaven just to be like hey this is the\nplace where you can show emotions you\ncan feel emotions and you don't have to\nfeel guilty or worry about judgment from\nit why not what makes that safe because\nit's not real right it's it's fiction it\nsounds counterintuitive but because it's\nnot real you can to me it felt more real\nthan a lot of you know a lot of real\nlife events so it's a weird\ncounter-intuitive uh way that my\nemotions worked"
