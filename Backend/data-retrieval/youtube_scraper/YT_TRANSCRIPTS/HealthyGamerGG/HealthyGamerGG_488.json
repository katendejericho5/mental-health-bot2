    "transcript": "how do we stop waking up tilted the\nfirst thing that you can do is literally\nsleep more so of the people that I've\nworked with who wake up tilted very very\nchronically they usually sleep for about\nseven hours a night so you gotta sleep\nmore don't use pot don't use marijuana\ndon't use alcohol or even sleeping\nmedication to help you sleep what you\nwant to do is block out curtains\nweighted blanket these are the two\nthings that you want to do lower the\nthermostat make it cold and snuggle into\nthat blanket you want to force yourself\ninto a physiologic hibernation first\nthing you need to do is just sleep more\nthere's a lot of evidence that shows\nthat waking up tilted actually\ncorrelates with sleeping insufficiently"
