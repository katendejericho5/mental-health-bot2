    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nstop waking up tilted\nbecause waking up tilted\ntilt is right you wake up you're already\nangry you're full of negative emotion\nand it kind of informs the rest of your\nday sometimes you can sort of bring\nyourself out of it but for the first\nhour or two of the day like you have to\nlike spend that hour digging yourself\nout of the hole instead of actually\ndoing stuff and so you're kind of like\nexhausted by 10 a.m or 11 A.M and you\nhaven't even done anything yet so waking\nup tilted is something that actually\ncosts us a lot in terms of productivity\nin terms of mental health in terms of\nlike actually living the life that you\nwant hey just a quick note a lot of\npeople will ask us what do I do next and\nthat's why we built Dr K's guide It's a\ncomprehensive resource that distills\nover 20 years of my experience both as a\nmonk and as a psychiatrist and it's\ndesigned in a way that's tailored to fit\nyour needs so if you're interested in\nbetter understanding your mind and\ntaking control of your life check out\nthe link below in order to understand\nhow to avoid waking up tilted we have to\nintegrate a lot of information from\nNeuroscience clinical Psychiatry dreams\nall kinds of crap okay so we're going to\ntalk about sleep we're going to talk\nabout stress and we're going to talk\nabout emotions and once you understand\nthe relationship between these three\nthings it will help you so much in life\nso let's start with emotions so one of\nthe things that we know about mood\ndisorders is that people who are\nclinically depressed have something\ncalled early morning Awakening so we\nsort of know is that there are a lot of\nthings that can look like depression so\nif we look at like the features of\ndepression low energy level not being\nable to have fun difficulty sleeping but\nthose three things can be caused by all\nkinds of stuff like if you've got cancer\nif you've got hypothyroidism both of\nthose diagnoses can cause low energy\nlevels difficulty sleeping and a lack of\npleasure in life but there is one thing\nor three things really that is very\nspecific to mood disorders and that is\nearly morning Awakening so a lot of\npeople who are clinically depressed will\ndescribe a really interesting feature\nwhich is that they wake up at like four\nto five in the morning and their mind is\ngoing like a mile a minute and it's also\nlike in a very negative headspace and so\nthey spend the first couple hours of the\nday crawling out to that negative\nemotional pit now the cool thing is that\neven if you wake up tilted we can take\nthis case of clinical depression and\nunderstand a lot about what's going on\nin the brain and essentially what we\nknow in clinical depression is that\nthere is an overabundance of negative\nemotion so when we have an overabundance\nof negative emotion let's see how it\naffects our sleep and our brain and what\nour brain has kind of evolved for so\nlet's think about the circumstances in\nwhich our brains experience a ton of\nnegative emotion it's usually when\nthings are going bad right that's what\nwe've evolved for it's like okay so like\nif our tribe is being attacked by\nanother tribe we have to flee and as we\nflee we're filled with negative emotions\nand what is adaptively useful in these\nkinds of situations the more negative\nemotion we have we actually want to be\nvery very light sleepers and we don't\nwant to sleep a full night so there's\ndata that shows for example that\ncortisol which is a stress hormone\naffects the part of our brain which\ngoverns sleeping and waking this is a\npart of our brain called the reticular\nactivating formation\nso in our cortisol our stress levels are\nhigh think about evolutionarily like\nwhat does our brain want to do our brain\nwants to sleep very lightly right right\nwe don't want to be deep sleepers if\nwe're if our tribe is being hunted by\nanother tribe I want to wake up at four\nin the morning absolutely like I don't\nwant to sleep till noon and also I want\nmy sleep to not be very deep or very\nrestful because if there's they're\nhunting me and I hear a twig snap my\nbrain needs to wake up right away right\nI can't afford to sleep restfully\nso stress in your life and negative\nemotion so negative emotions will induce\nstress and cortisol production and\ncortisol production will interfere with\nour ability to sleep for extended\nperiods of time and so then we will wake\nup early in the morning with our mind\nfilled with negative emotions go with me\nso far okay so we're waking up tilted\nright so stress has something to do with\nit\nso the other thing to keep in mind is\nthat\nin depression what causes that early\nmorning Awakening is that over abundance\nof emotions so why is everyone waking up\ntilted now is something has something\nchanged fundamentally and whether we\nwake up tilted remember it has to do\nwith an overabundance of emotion so\nthere are two things that have changed a\nlot in our world today the first is the\nway that we absorb emotions and the\nsecond is the way that we process or\nreally fail to process emotions\nso the first thing to understand is that\nwhen we have emotional problems right\nnow what do we usually do so in the past\nlike let's say a hundred years ago if I\nhad a fight with my brother what would I\nI do like let's say I like live on a\nfarm somewhere right so I have a fight\nwith my brother and I go do some rote\nwork like I'm gonna go like milk a cow\nor I'm gonna go you know get some hay or\nlike weed the Garden or something like\nthat and as I go and engage in this like\nsort of kind of simple physical labor\nright because for the majority of human\nevolution like we've engaged in like\nsimple Behavior like we're not doing\ncognitive stuff like 5 000 years ago\nit's not like everyone was a scholar in\nwriting like poetry right we like spend\nour time hunting and Gathering and like\nweaving stuff and like milking cows and\nwhatever\nand so when I'm doing that what does my\nbrain actually doing it's taking that\nemotional insult and it's actually\nprocessing that emotion\nthere's studies that show and I've seen\nthis kind of when I'm working on\ninpatient Psychiatry that if I have a\ngroup of kids who's been traumatized and\nwe are doing a trauma processing group\none of the healthiest things to do in\nthe trauma processing group is to give\nevery kid especially adolescents\nneedlework\nneedlework actually facilitates trauma\nprocessing so something weird with our\nbrain this is probably the way that it\nevolved right because we were in this\nrote activity that when we're doing like\nneedle work or we're like weeding the\ngarden we're like processing emotions at\nthe same time it's just how it works and\nwe've observed this in clinical settings\nand if you're trying to like think\nthrough your problems by all means pick\nup needlework or go gardening or\nwhatever there's all kind of studies\nthat show that like so that's good for\nyour mental and it's because something\nabout the way that our body works is\nwhen we're like moving a little bit our\nemotions start to get processed\nso now let's think for a second what do\nwe do now when we get into a fight\nthat's right let's look at cat videos or\nsee what my least favorite politician is\nsaying that's going to piss me off we\nturn to these devices now right when you\nhave a fight with a friend when you get\ndumped by someone what do you end up\ndoing you're going to browse Reddit\nyou're going to browse YouTube You're\nGoing to browse Tick Tock you're gonna\nbrowse all kinds of crap and so what\nhappens to the emotions that we\naccumulate throughout the day they get\nsuppressed through technological devices\nwhat does that mean when we go to bed at\nnight that means that the emotional load\nthat we have is greater and remember\nwhat leads to early morning Awakening\nover abundance of emotions usually\nnegative emotions okay\nbut also positive emotions I don't know\nif y'all were ever like this but like\nwhen you're on vacation you're going to\nDisney World like you wake up at 5am\nevery day and you're super excited\nbecause you're at Disney World and kids\ndon't [ __ ] sleep at Disney World so\nany kind of overabundance of emotion but\nespecially negative emotions will lead\nto early morning Awakening and we're\npiling up our emotions instead of\nprocessing them the way that we have for\nthousands of years\nso next up let's understand a couple of\nother things so in addition to piling up\nemotions that we used to process we're\nincreasing our total emotional load\nthere's something else that has changed\na lot in society which is sleeping and\ndreaming so the other cool thing about\nour brain is it has one other really\nawesome technique to deal with negative\nemotions and that has to do with sleep\nso sleep is filled with a couple of\ndifferent stages okay so there's like\nstage one stage two stage three stage\nfour sleep and then there's something\ncalled REM sleep and during REM sleep is\nwhen we actually dream a lot and what we\nsort of know is that one of the\nfunctions of sleep is emotional\nprocessing and so what we also know is\nthat dreaming is one way that we\nemotionally process\nand so basically when I'm doing like\ndream work with our my patients and\ny'all can do this too we'll talk about\nit for a second\nis this how dreams work so when you've\ngot a bunch of emotions\nwhen you stop and dream what happens is\nyou feel those emotions right like so\nthe emotions that you feel in dreaming\nare real like if someone's chasing you\nin a dream you're actually really scared\nright like that fear is 100 real like if\nthere's lust in a dream like I don't\nknow if you've had those kind of dreams\nbut like you know what I'm saying like\nthat that's some that's some good\ndreaming right there and even to the\npoint where people want to do lucid\ndreaming where they want to experience\nall these like really like Lusty\nfantasies in their dreams [ __ ]\nperverts but so really what happens when\nwe dream is the emotions that we feel\nare real and Freud sort of made this\ndiscovery and this is how we do like\nPsychotherapy around dreams is what I'll\nusually do with my patients is I'll ask\nthem like it's it's not about like the\ncircumstances of the dream so there was\nlike I was driving a car and then a\ngiant tooth came and smashed my car and\nthen once I was smashed in the car I\nturned into a rabbit and then I flew up\ninto the sky and I saw the eye of God\nand the eye of God was crying\nall that like imagery crap I don't think\nthere's a whole lot of very solid\nscientific evidence that like the tooth\nmeans something and the eye of God means\nsomething but what we do know more\nscientifically is that the emotions that\nyou've stored up throughout your time\nduring the day or your life will come\nout in dreams and we know that because\nlike if you if someone's been\ntraumatized right so what happens is\nwhen they get traumatized they\ndissociate when they dissociate they\ndon't feel any of those emotions and\nwhere do those emotions go what is one\nof the most common symptoms of PTSD\nnightmares emotional dissociation during\nthe day correlates with nightmares at\nnight and what do you find as you do\nPsychotherapy and you process those\nemotions for traumatized individuals the\nnightmares go away and it's not any\nrandom nightmare right it's the\nemotional energy of the nightmare that's\nreally important so it's not whether\nit's a horse or a tooth or a car or\nwhatever it's how did you feel during\nthe dream\nand as you experience those emotions\nit's kind of the opposite of\ndissociation right so if I dissociate\nand I store emotions up when I feel them\nduring the dream I'm kind of like\nprocessing them and then I felt that\nemotion and then it's gone so that's the\nother thing to keep in mind about\nemotion so when we feel negative\nemotions we feel them for some time and\nthen they go away that's like how it\nworks right so if I'm gonna get pissed\nbut over time after I feel enough anger\nthat anger will start to fade if I\nsuppress it the anger will come out but\nif I let myself channel the anger if I\ngo to therapy if I talk about it and I\nlet that I feel that emotion coming out\nthen it's out of me and I'm Gucci okay\nso next thing that happens is we have to\nunderstand overabundance of emotion\nbuilding up through technological\nsuppression of emotions and dreaming is\none of the major things that we do to\nprocess emotion now what does that have\nto do with everything else that we've\ntalked about\nin our society today we do not dream\nenough let's understand why\nthe first thing is if I have cortisol if\nI have an overabundance of emotion then\nI'm going to do an early morning\nAwakening when do we do most of our\ndreaming we do most of our dreaming at\nthe end of our sleep cycle so at the\nvery beginning of our sleep cycle stage\none sleep is really really big and we\nonly get like 10 to 15 minutes of a rem\nREM sleep in our like first two hours of\nsleep the next two hours of sleep we get\nhalf an hour of REM sleep half an hour\nof dreaming the next two hours of our\nsleep we get 45 minutes of REM sleep the\nlast two hours of our sleep we will get\nlike an hour of REM sleep those aren't\nreally perfect figures but one thing\nthat is very scientifically known is\nthat our REM sleep slowly increases\nthroughout the night\nso if cortisol or an overabundance of\nemotion is waking me up six hours after\nsleep I'm actually missing out on the\nREM sleep and the emotional processing\npart right so the actual place that I\nprocess emotions I'm actually getting\nrid of and if you sort of think about it\nthat's kind of adaptive too why would\nour brain want to do that well because\nif another tribe is hunting me I don't\nwant to wake up in the morning and be\nlike oh man today's such a beautiful day\nman it's gorgeous today oh [ __ ] I\ncompletely forgot that these people are\nhunting My Tribe maybe oh [ __ ] oh crap\nright so we actually want to wake up\nwith negative emotion if we are in\ndanger so now we start to see all kinds\nof things cascading in there are a\ncouple of other really fascinating\nthings technology use probably\ninterferes with REM sleep overnight\nthis is where we also find something\nelse that's really interesting people\nwho use a lot of psychoactive substances\nlike marijuana alcohol\nstimulants even\ndrinking Red Bull and stuff like that it\nmesses with your sleep architecture and\nso this is the real problem if you use\nmarijuana to like help you sleep at\nnight marijuana will knock you out right\nit'll help you quiet your anxious\nthoughts so that you can fall asleep but\nit interferes with your sleep\narchitecture and your emotional\nprocessing people who get high or drink\na lot of alcohol before they go to sleep\ndon't dream as much if they don't dream\nas much they don't process emotions so\nyou're accumulating all these emotions\nthroughout the day you're not getting\nrid of them and you're gonna wake up\ntilted\nso how do we fix this how do we stop\nwaking up tilted the first thing that\nyou can do is literally sleep more\nso of the people that I've worked with\nwho wake up tilted very very chronically\nthey usually sleep for about seven hours\na night so you gotta sleep more don't\nuse pot don't use marijuana don't use\nalcohol or even sleeping medication to\nhelp you sleep what you want to do is\nblock out curtains weighted blanket\nright these are the two things that you\nwant to do lower the thermostat make it\ncold and snuggle into that that blanket\nyou want to force yourself into a\nphysiologic hibernation first thing you\nneed to do is just sleep more there's a\nlot of evidence that shows that waking\nup tilted actually correlates\nwith sleeping insufficiently so this is\nsome really interesting research as well\nhow do we regulate our emotions we\nregulate our emotions with our frontal\nlobes our frontal lobes when we're\nfeeling too emotional our frontal lobes\nwill be like yo amygdala calm down brah\nit's okay we'll be fine don't worry\nabout it just relax when our frontal\nlobes are capable of doing that that's\nwhen we sort of feel emotionally better\nso what leads to what sort of short\ncircuits are frontal lobes a lack of\nrest so as our as we get fatigued\nthroughout the day as fatigue builds up\nat the end of the night like we get\npissed right we start making really\nstupid decisions we make impulsive\ndecisions you don't text your ex who's\ntoxic for you at like 11 A.M on a Sunday\nwhen you're well rested and you played\nfrisbee golf all morning you text your\ntoxic X at two in the morning when your\nfrontal lobe stop working and you can't\ncontrol your emotions that's when you\nstop them on social media as well so\nthis is why first thing we got to do is\nwe gotta sleep more strengthen our\nfrontal lobes and do so in a non-farm\npharmacologic means if you can\nsecond thing we've got to understand\nover abundance of emotion leads to early\nmorning Awakening early morning\nAwakening means we miss out on our REM\nsleep missing out on our REM sleep means\nthat we don't process emotions hence we\nwake up tilted okay so second thing that\nwe want to do process emotions before\nyou go to bed\nall right so if you want to journal\nthat's fine you can go for a walk and I\nI like this really simple exercise which\nis\ndo this reverse analysis of your day so\nstart with the end of your day and kind\nof ask yourself okay what did I do this\nlast hour this is what happened and this\nis the key thing ask yourself what\nemotion did I feel over the last hour\nand then go to this the second hour\nbefore bed and the third hour before bed\nand unwind your mind so you can say okay\ndinner like oh yeah like I I wanted to\norder this thing but they screwed up my\norder and I got kind of pissed off at\nthe waiter oh yeah I felt that anger so\nprocess that for a second okay I got\nreally upset that's okay what happened\nthe hour before that oh and then I got\ndisappointed and then the hour before\nthat I felt really anxious I was going\nto go to meet my friends for happy hour\nbut I haven't seen them in five years\nand I've gained some weight and I was\nafraid that they would think that I'm\npathetic right and what actually happens\nwhen you go to the happy hour when\nyou're on your way to the happy hour\nyou're scrolling through your phone to\nsuppress those emotions you go to the\nhappy hour and you start pounding the\ndrinks to suppress the emotions so you\ngotta unwind your day and think through\nall of the emotions that you felt that\nday even doing that for half an hour or\n15 minutes or one hour can be very very\nhelpful\nokay so we want to try to sleep more we\nwant to unwind some emotions next couple\nthings that we can do are pretty like\ncommon advice that are hard to do but\nlet's mention them anyway second thing\nis if you use technology chances are\nit's going to suppress your emotions\nso this is where if you're feeling upset\nabout something the one thing I would\nencourage you to do do some kind of rote\nactivity for 15 minutes before you pick\nup your phone right go for a walk go\ngardening fold laundry do something\nstupid with your hands for about 15\nminutes if you want to do needlework do\nneedlework literally this is stuff that\nthey do like I worked in an inpatient\nhospital where on day one when you're\nchecking in\nwe take away all of your shoelaces so\nyou don't hang yourself and we hand you\nneedlework\nright but like that's literally what we\nwould do anyway\nwe also check you for razor blades and\nhere's a blunt needle so what you want\nto do is do some like let your mind\nemotionally process for a little bit\nokay\nand the last piece of advice that I'll\ngive you is dream more so pay attention\nI know it's kind of weird how on Earth\ndo you dream more pay attention to what\nyou can do throughout your day that\nresults in you dreaming more and the\nmore that you're able to dream so try to\nfigure out okay like what do I need to\neat what do I need you know do I need to\navoid alcohol do I need to avoid\nmarijuana try to dream is like like try\nto figure out like what can I do to\ndream more does that mean sleeping an\nhour long an hour later because\nliterally that emotional processing part\nof your brain functions through dreaming\nso what I found with a lot of people\nthat I've worked with is I'll just ask\nthem what are the things that you can do\nthat will allow you to dream more and\nit's not like a perfect science right\nyou can't say like okay if I do this\nbefore I go to bed I'll definitely have\ndreams but y'all will sort of know and\nthe main thing to understand is what the\nvalue of that dreaming is so if you get\nbetter quality sleep if you sleep for\nlonger periods of time so we really\nenter into that REM phase if you reduce\nyour stress cortisol through things like\nmeditating and most of importantly if\nyou have emotions that happen throughout\nthe day do not turn straight to\ntechnology to suppress them and instead\nprocess them if you do these four things\nthere is a very very very good chance\nthat you will wake up less tilted\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]"
