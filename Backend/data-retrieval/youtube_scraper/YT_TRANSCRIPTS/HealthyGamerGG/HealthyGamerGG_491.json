    "transcript": "if you are vulnerable to manipulation\nwhat that literally means is that your\nemotions will induce your actions so\nsome human beings go through life\nthinking that the way to solve emotional\nproblems is through action if my\nsignificant other is mad at me I need to\nbuy them a gift the way to resolve that\nemotion is by paying some price or\ninducing a behavior and if I get them\nthe gift then the emotion goes away I\nfeel better about myself because thank\nGod they're not mad at me anymore but\nthink about that right what's happening\nnow what you've done is you've\nreinforced this idea that the way that\nI'm going to fix my emotions is by\nengaging in some kind of behavior and so\nI want you all to really realize that\nyour ability to be manipulated is tied\nentirely to emotions and actions being\ntied in your mind"
