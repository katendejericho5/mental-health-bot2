    "transcript": "if you struggle with psychosomatic\nillness or if you know someone with\npsychosomatic illness oftentimes we have\nthis idea that you're they're doing it\nfor attention or people will judge you\nand say you are doing it for attention\nyou keep on having a stomach ache and\nyou're doing it for attention and it's\nnot real and it pisses off people around\nyou they're super judgmental or if\nyou're on the receiving end of having a\nloved one the psychosomatic illness you\nget pissed at them and you're like\n[ __ ] a like on my wedding day you\nhave to have your GI problems again\nthere's this idea that we do it for\nattention\nokay that is also basically not there's\nsome truth to that but it's not the way\nthat we think\nso what we've learned over the past 20\nor 30 years about psychosismatic illness\nis revolutionary and the basic problem\nis that Physicians are not trained in\nthis okay so what do we mean by\npsychosomatic that means there is a\npsychological component and there is a\nphysical component\nand what we're going to learn today is\nthat the way that our system of medicine\nas like Western medicine is set up is\nvery very bad at treating psychosomatic\nillness so I'll give you all a simple\nexample so if you've got a psychosomatic\nillness called pots postural orthostatic\ntachycardic syndrome you may get\nreferred by your general practitioner or\nprimary care physicians to a\nCardiologist and a cardiologist is like\nyeah maybe I can give you some medicine\nbut what you need to do is you need to\ngo see a therapist and then you get\nreferred by a psychologist and a\npsychologist will do Psychotherapy on\nyou but the psychologist doesn't\nunderstand the\nlike the cardiovascular component of it\nso what we've happened what we've\nmanaged to do in our system of medicine\nis we send you to two different\nSpecialists each of whom knows their\nparticular thing but doesn't understand\nhow these things are all connected\nso we do a very bad job in Western\nMedicine of treating psychosomatic\nillness because\nlike for example pots is associated 44\nof people with pots in one study have a\nhistory of sexual abuse or physical\nabuse okay now if the car if you go to\nthe cardiologist what is the\ncardiologist going to say they're going\nto say okay like go see a therapist for\nthat piece and I will handle this stuff\nso if you go to a psychologist we also\nknow that there are dysregulations we'll\ngo into what pot is with your like\ncardiovascular system right and the\npsychologist doesn't know anything about\nthat so then they send you the\ncardiologist so these are both parts of\nthe disease\nbut like you can't treat them in\nisolation so today what we're going to\ndo is we're going to explain to you all\nwhere psychosomatic illness comes from\nwe're going to like understand how our\nmind and our body is a homeostatic unit\nwhat does that mean\nso if my blood pressure drops\nit is detected by receptors in my throat\nbasically you know like when people do\nlike choke holds and they like make\npeople pass out during like these like\nspy movies they're not they're not\nactually cutting off oxygen flow they're\nactually squeezing both of your carotid\nBarrel receptors and inducing a blood\npressure drop which makes you pass out\nokay\nso we detect blood pressure up here and\nwhen our blood pressure drops these\nthings send signals to our heart let's\npump harder baby they also send signals\nto our kidneys let's absorb more volume\nlet's absorb water because if you have a\nclosed circuit like a pipe right like a\nblood vessel and the pressure is low\nwhat can we do to increase the pressure\nwe can squeeze\nokay we can go from here to here this\nwill increase the pressure and we can\nincrease the volume on the inside both\nof these things will increase our blood\npressure\nso the body works as a whole system\nthe biggest problem that we have in\nWestern medicine is we've separated the\nMind from all the other organs\nSo today we're going to understand that\nthe mind is no different from any of the\nother organs and if you really want to\nget a good handle on psychosomatic\nillness you have to understand how all\nthese things combine\nnow this is very important for y'all to\nunderstand because I hate to break it to\nyou but very few even medical doctors or\npsychologists will understand this level\nof like think about psychosomatic\nillness because what do we do in our\nsystem of medicine we have Specialists\nright so I'm going to become an expert\nin the heart\nbut as I learn more and more about the\nheart like I don't know so much about\nhealing trauma and if I'm a psychologist\nlike I don't even get like a single hour\nof Medical Training on how the heart\nfunctions\nso what happens when there is a disease\nthat is not\nlocalized to one organ system what\nhappens when you have a disease that the\ndisease is not in one piece but is in\nthe way that all of the units of your\nbody connect to each other and that's\nwhere psychosomatic illness exists\nso unfortunately\nyou're gonna have to become an expert in\nthis if you have a psychosomatic illness\nyou have to be the expert because very\nfew medical doctors or psychologists or\ntherapists will like have the\nmulti-disciplinary perspective that it\ntakes and my goal today is over the next\nhour I want to make you an expert in\nyour own psychosomatic illness so let's\nstart by understanding what do I mean by\npsychosomatic illness\nso we're talking about illnesses like\nirritable bowel syndrome or IBS\nfibromyalgia which is like a pain\nsyndrome\npots which is postural orthostatic\ntachycardic syndrome okay we're gonna go\nover the basics of psychosomatic illness\nand then we're going to use these three\nexamples to illustrate certain points\nbut there are all kinds of other\npsychosomatic illnesses functional GI\ndisorders like functional dyspepsia you\nknow gastric dysmotility disorder\nthere's all kinds of other stuff like\nchronic fatigue syndrome reflex\nsympathetic dystrophy there's just like\nall kinds of like GI stuff skin stuff\nit's like whole body kind of stuff okay\nso there's a ton of diseases that this\nlecture applies to and we're going to\ndive into three of them to illustrate\nthose general concepts so let's start\nwith the origins of psychosomatic\nillness so what causes a psychosomatic\nillness\nso back in the day\nFreud made a observation in Janae I\nthink also made this observation on a\npsychosomatic illness and what they\nessentially discovered is that there\nappears to be a psychological component\nto someone's physical manifestations so\nFreud was looking specifically at Menses\nand menstruation and really bad like\nmenstrual pain\nJanae was looking at other things but\nwith these two people basically\ndiscovered is that\npeople who are have a psychosomatic\nillness\nbypass a part of their mind and and what\nthey sort of discovered is that the mind\nis capable of splitting itself into\nand then like the more we bypass our\nmind the more somatic problems we tend\nto have okay now this has been borne out\nlater in in other kinds of research like\ntrauma so we know for example that\npeople who are traumatized early in life\none of the six domains of their body\nmind life that is affected is increased\nsomatic complaints so if you go through\na psychological trauma like even\nsomething like emotional abuse you are\nmore likely to have random problems in\nyour body so Freud and Janae both sort\nof discovered this kind of principle\nnow they also made a couple of different\nthey had a couple of different ideas\nbehind it so Freud thought that\nthe nature of the subconscious problem\nsymbolically manifests in the body so\nfor example like the kind of\npsychological thing that happened\nresults in a certain like bodily\ncomplaint so if for example I feel like\nmy parents are suffocating me because\nthey don't let me pursue my dreams then\nI'll have some kind of like lung\ncomplaint and I can't breathe so that's\nwhat Freud thought I don't really put\ntoo much stock into that but Janae also\nsort of figured out that like there's\nsome problem with emotional suppression\nand the increase in our somatic\ncomplaints\nand what we basically discovered is that\nAlexa thymia\nwhich is the inability to determine your\ninternal emotional state\ncorrelates with somatic problems in life\nand let's understand how that works so\nhere's what happens anytime we have a\nstress\nthe stress first hits our mind\nand then our mind activates in\nparticular ways so we will release\ncortisol\nwe will activate our immune system\nwe will activate our nervous system\nso this is things like adrenaline\nright\nand then these all will Cascade into the\nbody\nand we will experience symptoms\nso here's what\nthe early like kind of psychoanalysts\nand later on we sort of discovered this\nif you numb this so let's say I put this\ninto a black box where I have no\nawareness no emotional awareness of\nwhat's going on this basically goes\nstraight into cortisol whatever and it\nkind of gets it like passes straight\nthrough right so we're not aware so the\nfirst thing is that the first thing to\nunderstand about psychosomatic illness\nis in my experience people with\npsychosomatic somatic illness do not\nhave a weak mind they actually have a\nvery strong mind even to the point that\ntheir mind is able to persevere\nand continue pushing you to the point\nwhere your body starts to break down so\nif we think about you know how does\nillness emerge in the body it's\nbasically the weakest link\nand when someone's mind is stronger than\ntheir body you can force your body to\nkeep moving forward even though it is\nsending you signals hey we're hurting\nhey this is a problem hey we're getting\nscrewed and your mind is like so strong\nthat you power through\nand when you power through you actually\nresult in some part of your body\nstarting to get screwed up because your\nmind is like a Taskmaster and it whips\nforward whip whip whip whip whip\nso I became somewhat of an expert in\npsychosomatic illness and how did I\nbecome an expert in psychosomatic\nillness well when I was on my fourth\nyear of training at Mass General\nHospital in Harvard Medical School I\nstarted a consult service that was a\ncomplimentary and alternative medicine\nevidence-based consult service so I\nstarted getting patients originally from\npsychiatrists but then what happened is\nprimary care physicians or GPS started\nsending me patients\nand they're like hey this person has IBS\nor this other crap that I can't give\nthem a medication and make it go away so\nlet me send them to you and then I\nstarted doing really well with those\npatients I got more and more referrals\nfor like IBS and pots and fibromyalgia\nand all this kind of crap\nand then as I started working with these\npeople I started figuring out so the\nfirst thing that I realized is I know\nwhat mental illness is right I'm a\nfreaking psychiatrist\nand since I know what Melton says the\nfirst thing that I realized working with\nIBS patients is these people are not\nmentally ill I know what that looks like\nright that even if I treat their anxiety\nthat I can treat their anxiety and I\nknow I'm doing a good job because\nthere's tons of evidence for it and\ntheir symptoms are still continuing Ergo\nthis is not something in their mind and\nwhat I actually discovered is that these\npeople are actually very mentally strong\nthey're not mentally weak in fact they\nare too mentally strong\nso what they end up doing is powering\nthrough overcoming some physical signals\nand are not as emotionally aware as they\nneed to be\nokay so now let's understand something\nelse\nso this is normally how stress happens\nright\nwe get\nit goes through our mind\nand then it gets passed through our body\nand we also know that these people are\nAlexa thymic\npsychosomatic illness has an association\nwith trauma\nokay some studies show up to 44 percent\nof people have been physically or\nsexually abused\nso what's happening in the mind with\ntrauma these both both of these things\nare going to be similar to dissociation\nokay\nso when we don't have awareness in our\nmind either from our emotions and being\nalexithymic or trauma and dissociation\nwhich this means is that the the stress\njust passes through now let's look at\nwhat happens in a normal situation\nokay\nnow our mind is a really good filtering\nmechanism so if I get some kind of\nstress someone says hey uh like you know\nI'm sorry I can't pick you up from the\nairport I got a flat tire\nnow normally\nwhat the mind can do anytime there's a\nstress is we can modulate that stress\nwe can use coping mechanisms we can\nthink things through we can take a deep\nbreath and we can say okay hold on a\nsecond am I actually as screwed as I\nthink I am let me utilize my mind\nto modulate our stress and so even if\nthere is a big stress signal coming in\nbig ass stress signal\nI can use my mind to tone it down and\nthen the stress experienced by my body\nis smaller\ndoes this make sense\nyou all get this\nso this is normally what happens when\nyou get stressed out right if you're\nlike if you're in a healthy state of\nmind you can modulate the stress that\ngoes into your body the problem with\npsychosomatic illness is that this step\nis taken out\nnow does this mean\nthat\nthe Mind controls the illness no there's\nactually all kinds of stuff going on\nhere that is completely legit and real\nit is not in your mind but the problem\nin psychosomatic illness is that where\nwe kind of Pat We bypass the mind in\nsome way there's a part of our mind that\nkeeps on whipping us forward and\nactually increases the stress on the\nbody but there's real stress in the body\nas well we'll kind of get to that okay\nso the first thing that we've got to do\nand we'll get to this later is we have\nto sort of fix our minds ability to\nmodulate the outside stress which is\nreal and the physiologic response which\nis real\nthe second thing that we kind of know\nfrom people with psychosomatic illness\nis that they are very externalizing\nnow what does this mean\nso if you're struggling with\npsychosomatic illness and there is a\nproblem\nwhere do problems get fixed\ndo they get fixed within you or do they\nget fixed outside of you now if I ask\nthis question\nthis is going to be a stupid question\nfor most of y'all Or happy all half of\ny'all are going to say well like\nobviously if there's a problem on the\noutside the solution is on the outside\nthis means that you're externalizing\nI know it sounds kind of crazy and what\nI'm about to say to you is not going to\nmake any sense\nbecause the entirety of your experience\nhas taught you that this is not true\nwhich is external problems do not have\ninternal solutions that needs to change\nI know it's crazy but you're saying but\nDr K aren't you saying that there is\nsome real physiology at play I'm saying\nyes there is real physiology at play and\nthat solution actually exists within you\nI know it sounds weird but this is what\nwe know\nwhen people grow up in a social\nsituation sometimes they grow up in a\nsocial situation where parents\nteach them that problems\nrequire\nexternal Solutions\nokay this is just how how you were\nraised so when Mom and Dad had a problem\ndid they fix it by like doing something\nexternal so there's a good evidence for\nexample that shows that when a child has\na GI complaint\nand some some parents\ntake them to the doctor let's say 10 of\nthe time some parents take him to the\ndoctor 50 of the time and some parents\ntake them to the doctor 90 of the time\nthis is the category that ends up with\nchildren with psychosomatic illness\nnow what does this mean does this mean\nthat it's in your head no\nthis means that your parents taught you\nthat when you feel bad on the inside\nthe solution is to go fix something on\nthe outside\nGI is gastrointestinal okay\nit's like when a kid it says like my\nstomach my tummy hurts right and so like\nif you think about what a lot of parents\nwill do a lot of parents will say well\nyou know I know it's the first day of\nschool I know your tummy hurts maybe\nthere's a psychological component to it\nthere's a physiological component to it\nas well by the way\nbut the way that they manage that is\nthey kind of like emotionally support\nyou so another thing that we tend to\nfind from a social standpoint\nis that\npeople who are socially supported\nhave improvements\nin psychosomatic illness\nokay now people will also reverse\nengineer this they say well if you're\nsocially supported doesn't that mean\nthat it's all in your head once again no\nyou can have patients with metastatic\ncancer whose survival rate I'm sure some\nstudy out there will show I haven't\nlooked at this like stage four cancer\nand social support but social support\nhelps people recover from Strokes it\nhelps people recover from myocardial\ninfarctions it helps people survive\ncancer\nso once again just because social\nsupport is important doesn't mean that\nit is all in your head but what we know\nfrom people with psychosomatic illness\nis that when they grow up they are\ntaught\nthat if I have an internal problem it\nrequires an external solution\nokay they also have parents who will be\nlike you know if you're if you get\nfrustrated like if you try to share your\nemotions with your parents\nwhat do your parents do\nyour parents will tell you to do\nsomething about it right the kids are\nbullying me at school go sign up for\nmartial arts class and kick their ass\nthe next time they bully you that an\ninternal problem requires an\nexternalizing solution\nso what does this mean this is but the\nparent doesn't say you know sit down and\nsay hey like I'm sorry they're bullying\nyou I love you you're a great person\nyou'll be okay do you want to sign up\nfor martial arts class would that help\nyou feel more confident do you all\nunderstand how those are two very\ndifferent things\nlike in one case parents will literally\ntell you that any problem that you have\nif you feel a certain way you need to\nchange something outside of you and if\nyou change something outside of you that\nwill change the way that you feel\nokay so this is what happens with kids\nwho grow up they have parents like this\nthat are very externalizing okay so this\nis a core part of psychosomatic illness\nso main thing to keep in mind is that\nour mind has the ability to modulate\nstress on our body and that people who\ngrow up with psychosomatic illness\nare raised in a particular environment\nwhere this step is actually removed for\nthem in some kind of way and this is not\njust removed from them\nthis is not just removed from them from\nfrom uh\njust an emotional support standpoint\nthere are also issues of trauma and\ndissociation where you're like kind of\nnot you're literally dissociating you're\nfracturing your Consciousness into two\nparts and you're burying one and the\nresult is that the stress bypasses your\nmind and goes straight into the body so\nwe're going to talk about IBS all right\nso in IBS which is known as irritable\nbowel syndrome\nwhat this means is that your bowels are\nirritable it's characterized by\nalternating\ndiarrhea constipation nausea bloating\nnot too much vomiting usually usually\nit's just like nausea and bloating but\nit's really confusing because when we\nthink about it from like a western\nmedicine standpoint we know that there\nare some things that are constipating\nand some things that cause diarrhea\nright they're absolutely like an\ninfection can cause diarrhea and if you\nare hopped up on opiates you'll get\nconstipated\nwe'll also know that diet for example\ncan cause constipation\nbut the thing about IBS is that like\ntheir GI system is just kind of screwed\nlike sometimes they're constipated\nsometimes they have diarrhea they're\nkind of bloated all the time and there's\nnot like a medication that we can give\nthat will like fix that right we have\nmedications for diarrhea you can give\nlike loperamide and we have medications\nfor constipation right so you can give\npeople things that are like we'll have\nthem poop\nand you can even do things like animism\nwhatever you can increase their fiber\nincrease their fluid intake but we don't\nknow like when the when the bowel is\ndoing both like we're not sure what\nmedication to give\nso what happens in IBS so this is what\nIBS is okay so it's like just all these\nweird GI problems that don't have a\nparticular Smoking Gun\nso what do we know about IBS\nso first thing that we know is that 15\nto 30 percent of people with IBS have a\nhistory of abuse\none study showed that 44 of people have\nbeen sexually or physically abused who\nhave IBS\nnow let's understand what is that does\nthat mean it's psychological no not at\nall so we also know is that people with\nIBS\nhave a hypersensitivity or over uh sorry\nan increased amount of adrenaline or\nnoradrenaline\nso even if you look at their genetics\nthese are people that have a\nhypersensitivity or have too much\nadrenaline basically in their body okay\nso what does this mean how does this fit\ntogether\nso if you get traumatized early in life\nyour body rewires and how does it rewire\nso if you get traumatized early in life\nwhen you get traumatized your your body\nexperiences a lot of danger\nright so since it experiences a lot of\ndanger\nthe danger Machinery in your body gets\nleveled up right so if I go and I like\nlift weights I'm going to grow my\nmuscles if I go and like you know if I\nhave to memorize a bunch of stuff for\nmedical school then like my memory\ncapacity will increase\nif I get [ __ ] abused\nthen my\nsympathetic nervous system my fight or\nflight system my adrenaline system will\nactually level up and we will get more\nsensitive to Adrenaline\nso there are studies that show that\npeople with IBS have a hyperactive\nadrenaline and stress system\nand so what that means is that things\nthat would normally\nnot stress people out since you have a\nhyperactive stress system normal things\nwill create a disproportionate\nphysiologic response\nso we get adrenaline secreted way more\noften\nwe get a secreted way earlier and why is\nthat it's because we've been hyper\nsensitized right because we grew up in\ntraumatic environments and we're like\nfor danger our ability to detect danger\nincreases\nour response to Danger increases why\nbecause that's a survival mechanism\nbut at this point we fully we've jumped\nbeyond the mind it has nothing to do\nwith your mind this has to do with the\nwiring of your nervous system has\naltered at this point and by the way\nwhich psychiatric illness is associated\nwith Hyper activation of our danger\ncircuitry can anyone guess\nanxiety\nand guess which mental illness is most\ncommon in people with\nIBS it is anxiety so these are cases\nwhere if we look at what happens in\nanxiety we you have a hypersensitivity\nto your stress system\nokay\nnow another thing that we know in people\nwith IBS is that they also have this\nemotional numbing going on so how do we\nput these two pieces together if my body\nhas been wired\nto be very sensitive to stress and\nrelease way too much adrenaline and by\nthe way really what it is is reductions\nin re-uptake of adrenaline so that's not\nway too much what that means is that the\nadrenaline signal lasts way longer in\nIBS than it does in a healthy person\nand this is why they have these like\nweird kind of symptoms okay so it's not\nthat they like go into panic attacks\nit's that their body is in a high stress\nstate for a very long period of time\nwhich can even do things like result in\nin diarrhea okay\nso you have a hyperactivation\nof your\nnervous system so let's go back to this\nso what do we know about people with IBS\nthey have a hyper activation\nof\nsympathetic\nnervous system so this is adrenaline\nand noradrenaline\nand specifically what this is\na reduction in re-uptake\nof noradrenaline\nand what does that mean okay so I know\nI'm throwing a lot of technical stuff\nbut I hate to say this like y'all got to\nlearn this right so like stick with us\nfor a while we're going to reinforce\nthese Concepts a couple of times but\nit's very important to understand so\nthis isn't too much adrenaline what this\nmeans is that when we release adrenaline\nre-uptake is slowed down so this is our\nstress experience for someone who has\nIBS this is how we're physiologically\nwired\nokay\nso then the other thing that happens is\nif we have large amounts of adrenaline\nin our body for prolonged periods of\ntime what do you think that does\nto our mind\nit makes us more anxious\nand then the other thing that it does is\nit causes us to catastrophize\nso this is something that's very\nimportant\nto understand about all psychosomatic\nillnesses\nso when we feel something in our body\nand when we learn to externalize\nwhat this ends up as and if you've got\npsychosomatic somatic illness you\nunderstand this you will catastrophize\nthe impact of this so what that means is\nI'm starting to feel rumbling in my\nstomach this means I need to leave the\nparty because I'm about to get [ __ ]\nthe rumbling in the stomach means I'm\ngg'd out and why do they do this what's\ngoing on here there's all kinds of\nreally interesting things so when we\nhave adrenaline in the brain\none function of adrenaline in the brain\nis that it makes hypothetical problems\nfeel more real okay now let's understand\nthis for a second\nif I'm walking in my house and I see I\ndon't know a [ __ ] garden hose\nin my laundry room and I don't see it\nvery clearly and adrenaline is pumping\nI'm gonna see a garden hose and I'm\ngoing to think it is a snake that\npossibility of danger feels more real\nand I jump and I scream\nand I go jump into my wife's arms and\nshe holds me and Pats me and comforts me\nright so what adrenaline literally does\nin the brain is it makes possible things\nfeel more real\nokay so now let's let's if we have\nadrenaline in the brain which by the way\nwe know that genetically people with IBS\nhave more adrenaline floating around all\nover the place we'll get to why their\nadrenal is even higher for other reasons\nin a minute\nand then that adrenaline goes to our\nbody what does that mean that that\ncauses us to catastrophize okay as we\ncatastrophize and there's also some good\ndata for this right so internally like\nI've I had a patient once that had IBS\nthat\nliterally like shot themselves on their\nhoneymoon\nand like that's not a psychological cry\nfor attention or any of that other crap\ndoesn't mean that they're mentally weak\nor whatever they're like Yay I'm getting\nmarried this is gonna be great\nand I shot myself and now this is\nembarrassing and I'm married to this\nperson and like what they get they like\nhelp their spouse help clean themselves\nup like there's no you cannot tell me\nthat this is some [ __ ] psychological\ncry for help or attention or whatever\nright so I worked with this person I'm\nlike that's not what's going on that\nthat's just it's just not what's going\non okay\nso what happens with people with IBS is\nthat they have genuine bad outcomes plus\nthis adrenaline thing which causes them\nto catastrophize as they catastrophize\nthey start doing something called\nbehavioral amplification\nwhich is\nthe second I feel something in my body\nI'm going to alter my behavior so the\nsecond I feel a rumbling I'm going to\nleave dinner the second I feel a\nrumbling I'm going to walk out of the\nmovie theater because bad things can\nhappen okay\nso this is a psychological consequence\nthis in turn leads to social isolation\nand then it all kind of fits back\ntogether and it becomes a [ __ ]\nso there's also a couple of other things\nthat we know in IBS so this is\nhyperactivation this is number one\ny'all with me or is that like two all\nover the place\ngive up time well said\nsecond thing that happens in IBS is that\nwe have changes to our immune system\nokay\nso we get an increase in\nenterochromophin activity\nwe also see increased mast cell activity\nso what this basically means is like our\nallergy response like the the part of\nour immune system that governs allergies\nis basically hyperactive so we basically\nhave like our gut becomes\ngut has an allergic response\nand that's why we get like diary and\nbloating and all this like non-specific\nstuff it's not that we have an infection\nthat can be localized to one area it's\nnot like there's one part of our you\nknow gut that's messed up we don't have\nlike a loose gastroesophageal sphincter\nwhich causes reflux there's not one\nproblem our whole gut is like\nhypersensitive due to a couple of these\nchanges which means that like it's easy\nto trigger it into like going down a\nCascade of crap okay\nthird thing\nis that there is a brain gut connection\nthere's like way more than three there's\nlike 15 but we're going to explain a\ncouple of the others later okay I'm\ngonna spoon feed y'all\nso what we know\nis that gut microbiome\nand this\nallergic GI system\ncauses immune activation\nokay\nand then the other thing that starts to\nhappen is that we also see changes from\nthis kind of stuff in visceral\nsensory\ninput\nokay\nso now what does this mean\nso we have nerves in our belly that tell\nus stuff about our belly this is when we\nlike you know when you feel full after\neating a lot like what's going on there\nyou've got a nerve that detects the\nstretch of like your stomach\nyou have all kinds of nerves down there\nand what we see in people with IBS is\nthat there is a hypersensitivity to\nvisceral sensory input so there is like\nlet's say there's some let's say here's\nyour stomach and after I eat whatever\nI'm gonna have for lunch this is my\nstomach if I'm a healthy human being\nthis wide stomach makes me feel content\noh man I'm gonna unbutton that top\nbutton I'ma slap my Billy I'm gonna eat\none more piece of pie I'm gonna squeeze\nin that pie man that's some good eating\nlet me tell you what that is some goody\ndelicious give me some of that peach\nCobble is a scoop of that that a la mode\nvanilla ice cream\nI can do one more\nthis makes us feel good if you have a\nhypersensitivity to visceral sensory\ninput\nthen this feels bad\noh crap\nimma throw up\noh crap oh my God I ate too much\nsomething's wrong something's wrong I'm\ngonna throw up oh [ __ ] this feels so bad\nlike oh my God something's something's\nnot right\nthis feels bad\nso the way that your nerves are wired\nfeels bad now why are your nerves wired\nin this different way if you had a\nparent who had GI problems\nthey were like constantly like talking\nabout their own stomach my stomach is\nmessed up or whatever maybe there was\nsome psychological need right when you\nwhen your stomach if you have a parent\nwith GI problems and you complain\nmy stomach hurts and your parent takes\nthat very seriously\nit's not about just psychological needs\nreinforcement it's like your parent is\nlike okay so tell me does it hurt is it\nbloated are you nauseous do you feel\ndistended\nis it irritable and so then they hyper\nfocus on that and just like any parent\nwill teach their child what they know\nthis is what happens\nright so if I like I like I like to\nmeditate and I'm a psychiatrist so when\nmy kids tell me that they're not feeling\nwell I ask them all kinds of questions\nabout it and I'm sort of leveling up\ntheir awareness about emotions\nand if I ask all kinds of physical\nquestions then the kid is like if I ask\na six-year-old do you feel distended or\nbloated do you feel nauseous do you feel\ngassy do you have this problem do you\nhave this problem literally what that's\ngoing to do is that six-year-old brain\nis gonna the attention is gonna go into\nthe gut\nand their visceral sensory afferent\nnerves which is the stuff that detects\nstuff in the gut is going to become\nhypersensitive\nthis is the same way that you know if I\nteach a child how to cook their palate\nis going to be sensitive right\nsame thing is going on in the gut\nso what we know with kids with IBS is\nthat they're visceral internal input has\nbecome hypersensitive this is because of\nthe way that their parents treat them\nthis is because they do have some kind\nof real GI problem this can also be\nbecause there's some kind of Behavioral\nreinforcement where the only time my\nparents love me is when I like like the\nonly like my parents ignore me they're\nworking really hard unless I get sick\nand if I get sick I get my parents\nattention now some people will interpret\nthat as oh that means that this they're\ndoing it for intention what I'm saying\nis that there's just one piece of the\npuzzle\nbut at the end of the day what ends up\nhappening is our visceral sensory input\nincreases it changes the way that we\nexperience ordinary things ordinary\nthings become unpleasant\nokay now combine that with\nactive immune system and an allergic GI\ntract and there's more crap going on\nthe more crap there is going on if I\namplify the signal the worse everything\ngets\ny'all with me I like all this stuff like\nfits together there isn't like a linear\nit's not a linear problem it's like a\nsystem problem\nand if y'all are curious about you know\nwhat is this this is the system\nlike look at this\nwhat the [ __ ]\nthis is literally how it works people\nhave mapped this out this is not in your\nhead\nthis is not psychological there is a GI\nspecific anxiety absolutely there's a\npersonality component but there's an\nattentional component there is\ninteroceptive conditioning there's GI\nimmune function mechanoreceptors\nafferent nerves mechanical GI\nstimulation there are hormones that are\nacting here this is like literally what\nwe know it is not in your head\nokay so what I'm going to try to do is\nwe're going to explain all this crap so\nstrap in folks we're just getting\nstarted\nokay y'all with me so far\ndo you have any insight into idiopathic\npost-pandreal syndo no but by the end of\nthis lecture you will\nokay\nI know it sounds kind of weird\nall right so this is IBS all right so\nwhat happens in IBS let's summarize\nsomething goes on early in life that\nprimes are adrenaline and sympathetic\nnervous system\ngoes on in life that increases our\nsensory awareness of the GI system\nthat combined with stuff like\ncatastrophizing from too much\nnoradrenaline and bad things actually\nhappening results in we get too much\nsignal\nand we amplify the danger of the signal\nand we get screwed every time anything\nhappens so what does this mean this\nmeans that an IBS person can\nsit in some posture that makes their\nstomach feel slightly uncomfortable and\nwhereas a normal person would just shift\nand they'd be fine the IBS person has\nall of this experience\nand their brain is functioning in a\nparticular way to where this thing is\nnot a benign problem this ain't just\ngonna go away it's going to screw the\nrest of my day\nokay that's IBS\nnext thing we're going to talk about\npots\nwhen I'm laying down\nI have about 300 to 800 milliliters of\nblood in my thorax in my central chest\nright so when I'm laying down there's no\ngravitational effect and blood actually\npools in my chest and abdomen\nwhen I sit up\ngravity has an effect on blood\npulls towards the bottom\nthen what happens is my body\nsqueezes my blood pressure blood vessels\nespecially at the bottom of my feet okay\nso here's our body when we're laying\nflat\nhere's blood equally distributed\nthen when I sit up\nhere's my blood vessel\nso what happens\ngravity makes it pool over here\nhow do I get the blood to move up\nI clamp down this way\nright so then what I'm going to do is\nI'm going to make a tube like this\nand if I make a tube like this what's\ngoing to happen with the blood it's\ngoing to go up\nwith me\nso there's another thing\nso anytime we sit up\nor stand up\nokay we'll talk about well pot says Port\npostural orthostatic tachycardic\nsyndrome we'll talk about that in a\nsecond all right so you all have to\nunderstand this the other thing that\nhappens is notice that what I did here I\ndidn't just compress this I also dilated\nthis\nso this is wider than this\nand this is narrower than this that's\nexactly what we want so normally when we\nsit up\nthe blood flow to our brain we get\ndilation of the blood vessels that go\ninto our brain and we get constriction\nof the blood vessels at the bottom of\nour feet and so what that means is that\nwe're decreasing the resistance up here\nhey blood\ncome on up to the head bro\ncome on girl like come up to the head\nand like give us cerebral blood flow so\nthat we don't [ __ ] pass out\nand y'all feet now that y'all have\ngravity working for you y'all don't need\nas much blood so we're going to\nconstrict the blood vessels\nokay this is the homeostasis that we\nsort of get with blood pressure now what\nhappens in pots in pots when people\nstand up their blood pressure drops and\nthey become tachycardic\nso what happens is that when when this\nhappens with people with pots this does\nnot actually happen instead the blood\nvessels stay like this\nand when the blood vessels stay like\nthis\nour brain which is over here is like yo\nI ain't\ngetting\nno blood\nI ain't getting no blood so that goes\nover to our heart and our heart is like\noh crap\nour brain ain't getting no blood\nI'm gonna start\nthat's a lightning bolt\nI'm gonna start beating really fast so\nnow I'm going to beat at 130 beats per\nminute\nokay\nwhy why am I beating at 130 beats per\nminute because if I ain't get no blood I\ngot to start pumping right the heart's\ngot a pump because that's what maintains\nyour vascular pressure is your heart\nif your heart starts pumping the\npressure in your system basically drops\nto zero I mean that's not technically\ncorrect because there's fluid in there\nbut it's basically what maintains blood\npressure right so this is what happens\nin pots people stand up and they feel\ndizzy\nso\nwhat causes this\nso the first thing that I want to point\nout to y'all\nso here is the symptoms associated with\npots and the relative frequency in 152\npatients now y'all may be asking\nyourselves but Dr K you're talking about\nthis is very physiologic like there's no\nthere's no mind stuff here\nright so holy crap pots is associated\nwith nausea and 38 percent of people\nwhat the hell does that have to do with\nblood pressure\ndiarrhea and 17 of people fatigue and 48\nof people sleep disturbance and 31\npercent of people\nweakness right like low MMR and 50 of\npeople holy crap bronze Rank and 50 of\npeople\npalpitations like that makes sense\nthat's heart stuff lightheadedness\ndizziness chest pain\nI also wonder does this look like\nsymptoms and anxiety\ninteresting\nright\nbut if we look at\nevidence-based treatment\nwater and salt fluidrocortisone exercise\nmidodrene beta blockers\noctreotide erythropoietin Central\nSymphony so Lim\nsympatholytic agents\nright so if we look at like treatments\nfor pots like no one is like what but\nwhat about all this crap\nwhat are we doing about this\nwhat is the doctor going to do about\nthis and this is why patients have such\nfrustrating experiences with doctors\nbecause when you get pots they send you\na cardiologist and cardiologist is like\ngreat\nI'm not trying to crap on cardiologists\nhere it's not their fault they're like\nimma give you midadrine and\nfluidrocortisone\nright because that's what cardiologist\nI'm going to give you a beta blocker\nwe're going to give you octreotide\nbut like they don't know anything about\nprocessing trauma\nso what's up with that so let's talk\nabout trauma and stuff you guys with me\nso this is first we have to understand\nhow pots works that's basic\nunderstanding of pots all right now\nwe're going to go into more details\nwe're going to go back to this\nwe're filling this out okay\nall right\nso let's understand a couple of things\nso\nif we look at oh and by the way pots\nalso has a comorbidity with chronic\nfatigue syndrome of 48 percent\nall right so that's kind of interesting\nlike what does chronic fatigue have to\ndo with this stuff\nso let's understand a couple of things\nabout impaired blood flow\nso what we know in pots is that there is\na paradoxical\nvasoconstriction\nI know I'm tossing terms at you we're\ngoing to explain it okay\nof cerebral\nblood flow\nnow what does that mean\nthis is the normal situation when we\nstand up this is what we want right so\nhere's normal\nhere's what we want\nand what happens in pots\nthis\nright so this is where the blood flow is\nnormally when we sit up\nwe get this\nand what happens in people with thoughts\nthis\nso paradoxical why do we call it a\nparadox because it's the opposite of\nwhat's supposed to happen\nvasoconstriction\nso this is vasoconstriction we are\nconstricting the blood vessel\ntowards the brain\nso when their brain should be getting\nblood\nthey don't get blood in fact they get\neven less blood\nand now we see why\nPrecinct means almost passing out is\nsixty percent of people they're right\nbefore passing out they also pass out by\nthe way\nbut like sixty percent of people\nregularly almost pass out or feel\nlight-headed or dizzy because there's no\nblood flow\nnow you may say but Dr K what the f does\nthis have to do with the mind\nso what causes this\nparadoxical vasoconstriction\nwhat do we know about people with pots\nis they have a disregulation\nof their\nsympathetic\nnervous system\nand this is adrenaline\nand nor adrenaline\nand have we heard of that before chat\nhuh that's interesting\nso even GI stuff\nthat is completely unrelated\nwe will see in all of these\npsychosomatic illnesses are going to\nhave changes where is this where did I I\nput this somewhere right yeah they're\ngonna have a hyperactivation of the\nsympathetic a problem with reuptake of\nnoradrenaline and IBS\nand we get a problem with our\nsympathetic nervous system in pots which\nis responsible for a lot of that crap so\nthat's interesting Dr K you're telling\nme that dysregulation of the sympathetic\nnervous system is responsible for IBS\nand this is a problem in pots if that\nwere true then that would mean that\nsomeone with pots may have problems with\ntheir GI tract\nholy crap\n40 percent of people with pots have\nproblems with their GI tract I wonder if\nthere is a common mechanism\nyes yes there is oh that's [ __ ] weird\nit's almost like pots is not a\ncardiovascular problem and as actually\nrelates to GI issues and IBS may not be\na GI issue and may relate to your\ncardiovascular system it's almost as if\nthe body is connected\nyes that is precisely correct\nokay now what else do we have with pots\nwe have abnormal\nvisceral\nsensory\ninput\nso people with pots are hypersensitive\nnot to their GI tract although they may\ndo that too because they experience\nbloating and all that crap they are\nhypersensitive to the the signals from\ntheir heart\nso these think about it this way the\nneurons that connect to the heart have\nthe volume jacked all the way up so even\na tiny little signal gets Amplified in\nour brain and we're going to get to this\nmore with fibromyalgia in a second\nokay\nso\nnow here's a question for you\nso there's also one other thing\nso this paradoxical vasoconstriction\nis caused by hypo\nIA\nlow CO2\nokay now this is now we're going to get\nkind of crazy and we're going to get\ninto a really interesting detail\nso when we've got a blood vessel\nwhat determines whether it dilates\nor what determines whether it constricts\nactually I want to redo that\nlet me do this\nokay\nso\nhere's our blood vessel this is a\ndilated blood vessel this is a\nconstricted blood vessel\nwhen we have\nhigh CO2\nor low O2 are blood vessels will expand\nright because we're not getting enough\nblood what does blood do it carries\noxygen and it gets rid of CO2\nso when we've got high CO2 I.E\nand low oxygen that's when our blood\nvessels are like hey let's dilate\nwe need more blood\nwhen we have\nlow CO2 or high O2 then our blood\nvessels constrict so this is our body's\nway of so I'll give you all just a\nsimple example of this okay so let's say\nI'm running now what happens to my blood\nvessels when I'm running it's not\nuniform\nso my GI system\nis like our skeletal muscles are you\ndoing a lot of activity my legs are\npounding as my legs contract as the\nmuscles in my legs contract they're\ndoing work right so they're consuming a\nlot of oxygen so that O2 level by the\nthe legs drops as the O2 level by the\nlegs drops our blood vessels expand\nnear the legs\nso that's how we get more blood flow to\nthe legs right get the heart pumping now\nwhat's happening in your GI system when\nyou go running GI system ain't doing\ncrap it's not digesting anything so it's\nlike hey like the the skeletal muscle is\nlike hey we need a bunch of oxygen we\nneed more blood our GI system is like\nwe're running on an empty stomach we're\nnot digesting anything we don't need any\nblood so they constrict\nnow what happens in pots is a\nparadoxical vasoconstriction\nso even though the tissue in the blood\nin the brain\ndoesn't have enough oxygen\nright we're not getting enough blood for\nsome reason there's vasoconstriction\nand so what we know\nin people with pots\nis that if you can induce hypercapnia\nif you can increase CO2 levels it will\nactually fix this screwed up\nvasoconstriction in your brain so people\nwith pots are hypocapnic which means\nthat they cause there's some kind of\nweird paradoxical hypocapnia which\ncauses vasoconstriction\nso one of the treatments for pots I know\nthis sounds kind of weird is actually to\nincrease your CO2 level\nokay because remember when we increase\nour CO2 level what happens we vasodilate\nwhat do we want to blood what what do we\nwant for blood flow in the brain we want\nto vasodilate our blood to the brain we\nwant to go from here to here and what is\nthe signal that goes from this to this\nit has increased CO2\nI know I kind of stumbled through that\ndo y'all\nget me\ny'all with me now\nso when CO2 increases\nwe're going to vasodilate\nokay\nnow\nif only\nthere was a practice that we could do\nthat would induce high levels of CO2\ndo you all know of any such practice\nwhich is weird right because we don't\nusually think about it as high levels of\nCO2 making out actually works yes I'm\nsure that would work\nmeditation yes 100 right so we're going\nto get to that in a second when we talk\nabout how to fix this stuff\nand why people kept on coming to me\nto fix their psychosomatic illnesses\nokay\nso in pots we've got basically all the\nsame stuff right so we've got abnormal\nsensory processing\nwe've got\nhyperactivation of the sympathetic\nnervous system and there's some weird\nspecific physiologic stuff that is we're\ntunneling way down into okay we got to\nunderstand how nerves work this is\nreally important to understand for\npsychosomatic illness okay\nso\ny'all ever heard of phantom limb\nso Phantom limb is when someone has an\namputation\nand for the limb that has been amputated\nthey still feel pain in the amputated\nlimb even though there's no nerve there\nto feel pain\nand this is a problem right because I am\na medical doctor and I can give someone\nsome kind of treatment to\nprovide analgesia to the pain analgesia\nmeans the movement of removing pain okay\nso I can like give you a medicine to\nlike dull the nerves\nor I can give you something like\nlidocaine so lidocaine numbs nerves it\nshuts off nerves and if I give you\nlidocaine then you won't feel any pain\nbecause I've shut off the nerve but how\non Earth is a doctor what do I do if\nthere's no nerve to begin with and\nyou're feeling pain it's like wait what\nhow do I what what's going on there so\nlet's understand here's my hand\nokay\nmy hand has receptors so I want you all\nto do this with me poke yourself\nwhen you poke yourself you feel\nsomething\nright so when you feel this what's\nhappening is there's a nerve over here\nthat's detecting that that nerve travels\nall the way up your arm and enters into\nthe side of your spinal cord\njoins with a bunch of other nerves so it\nlike there's a new nerve over here so\nI'm going to send a signal over here\nand then I transmit that signal to a\nnerve over here a second on a connected\nnerve but it's a different nerve goes\ninto my brain makes a second connection\nand then travels to another part of my\nbrain and then in that third nerve is\nwhere I experience pain\nokay the central the subjective\nexperience of pain doesn't come from\nyour hand it comes from your brain okay\nso here's nerve number one\nnerve number two\nand nerve number three so if I get a\nsignal\nthat travels down here and then\nactivates over here and travels down\nhere and activates over here then I feel\npain\nnow when we have Phantom limb\nthere's nothing over here\nbut what can sometimes happen is this\ncan get stuck in the on position and if\nthis gets stuck in the on position or\nthis gets stuck in the on position then\nwe will subjectively feel pain because\nour switch up here is stuck on even\nthough there's no it's not coming from\nanywhere\ndoes that make sense it can get stuck on\nso even if you look at things like\ntinnitus or tinnitus what happens in\ntinnitus we are hearing something but\nthere's no noise\nso normally when we hear things there's\nauditory nerve number one auditory nerve\nnumber two and auditory nerve number\nthree but there's no sound so this thing\nisn't activating\nbut this guy over here in tinnitus this\nis probably what it is somehow still\nlike screws up and turns on\nso what is fibromyalgia\nfibromyalgia is something over here\nwhere we're not quite sure but there's a\npart of it that's peripheral and there's\na part of it that's Central\nso in fibromyalgia people feel pain all\nover the place\nokay\nso some of that is coming from the out\nlike some of that is coming from the\nperipheral nerve some of it is actually\ncoming from my hands but some of it is\nalso coming from my brain\nso there is a\nabnormal\nsignal\nand Central\nprocessing\nnow what are some of the things that\ncontribute to this\nso we know that people with fibromyalgia\noftentimes have some low level of\ninflammatory activity\nnow what is\ninflammation do you all know what the\nrelationship between inflammation and\npain is\nso inflammation\nmakes our pain receptors\nhypersensitive\nso when I have an injury\nI don't want to re-traumatize the injury\nright like if I have a broken bone\nI don't want to screw up the healing of\nthe bone so evolutionarily what am I\ngoing to do\nI'm going to send signals to my brain\nhey don't touch this and anytime even a\nlight touch on a broken bone will hurt a\nlot and that's adaptive because if I\ndon't if any touch hurts then I'm not\ngoing to move it and if I don't move it\nthen it has a better chance to heal\nproperly whereas if I've got a cut on my\nhand and I keep on if I have no pain\nsignals then like that cut is going to\nkeep getting infected and I'm going to\nlike use it it's going to open up more\nit's going to be more damaging\nso it is adaptive for inflammation to\nincrease pain\nin fibromyalgia there's some\nsome level of inflammation that is like\nlow grade going on in the body\nand by the way\nwhat are some of the things that\ncontribute to whole brain I mean whole\nbody inflammation\ngut microbiome\nokay so what contributes to whole body\ninflammation\nour allergic load\nright so if we've got hypersensitive\nthings like mast cells and crap like\nthat that's going to increase\ninflammation what are allergies\nallergies are inappropriate activation\nof immune system\nand I don't know if you all know this\nbut inflammation is caused by the immune\nsystem the two are basically\ninterchangeable inflammation is the\nactivity of the immune system\nand gut microbiome\nis one of the biggest sources\nof\num\nwhat kind of whole body low level\ninflammation there are even studies that\nshow that low level inflammation in the\nbrain leads to mood disorders\nokay so we're really really excited\nabout this and we're like oh\ninflammation leads to mood disorders so\nlet's give people who are depressed\nanti-inflammatory\nmedications\nbut doesn't really help much\nunfortunately and this is and hopefully\nI'll understand why because you can't\njust Target one part of this do you all\nget this it's all freaking connected and\nit's not like there's one problem\nokay\nso in the case of fibromyalgia we have\nabnormal nervous input we have low level\ninflammation there are even studies that\nshow that gut brain interventions will\nbe helpful for fibromyalgia\nso let's go to\nso here's a just a good a better\ngraphical representation than me so\nhere's the trauma here's the peripheral\nnerve\ntravels to the spinal cord\nhas ascending input into the brain\nand then we have we have a transmission\nof pain signal into the brain I'm going\nto pause for a second and ask y'all what\nquestions do you all have about what\nwe've covered so far so next up is like\nwhat the hell to do about it and we're\ngoing to pull it all together but before\nwe do that I want to oh I want to make\nsure that y'all oh crap\nI want to make sure that you all have a\nchance to ask\nquestions so the first question that I\nthat people ask so now we're going to\npull it together y'all ready\nbringing it all together\nas well as like how I approach patients\nwho have this problem\nso the first thing to understand about\nWestern medicine\nis that Western medicine is based on\nlinear idiopathogenic\nprinciples what does that mean linear\na leads to B ediopathogenic the source\nof the problem is linear\nso in Western medicine what causes a\nheart attack it implies that there's\nthis thing called a heart attack\nand it has a cause so what causes a\nheart attack is the basically absolute\nocclusion\nof a coronary artery this is the problem\nthat causes this thing\nwhat causes covid a virus causes covet\nright what causes depression\nmajor depressive disorder is caused by a\nserotonin deficiency now that's not\nnecessarily true but my point is if you\nlook at Western medicine it is like a\nleads to B which is how our system of\nscience works so in science what we try\nto do in medicine we do these things\ncalled randomized controlled trials\nwhich is we're going to remove all of\nthe other factors and we're going to try\nto isolate the relationship between a\nand z this is literally how we build our\nscientific infrastructure\nso the more complicated it is we try to\nactually remove all of that crap\nand so what we've done in Western\nmedicine is get really really good\nat treating things\nwhere an a leads to a z\nwe get really really good at the\ntreatment of a specific diagnosis and\nthat's how our system of medicine is\nstructured you get a diagnosis and you\ngo to the expert that deals with that\ndiagnosis\nnow this creates all kinds of problems\none of my favorite quotes from an anime\nis over specialize and breed in weakness\nfrom Ghost in the Shell\nand so now for example we know that gut\nhealth is very important for mood\ndisorders we know that there's some kind\nof gut bacteria that endogenously\nproduce serotonin and when people have a\nmood disorder those kinds of gut\nbacteria are low in number\nso we have the wrong gut bacteria to\nproduce serotonin\nso we have a serotonin and endogenous\nserotonin deficiency\nif we send you to a psychologist who has\nhad a total of zero hours of training on\nanything related to the gut they are not\ngoing to be able to help you with that\nwe can send you to a psychiatrist we\nknow some of the stuff right so one of\nthe reasons that we're decent is we know\nsome of the medical stuff but even our\nsystem of Psychiatry we don't really\nlike apply it if we send you to a\nCardiologist like they're going to know\nthe cardiac stop but they're not going\nto know about trauma\nbut trauma and pots are related\nand this has to do with our Lineo\nidiopathogenic perspective in medicine\none thing causes one problem\nas our system of medicine has evolved we\nhave started to discover other things so\ncardiac disease sure is what causes a\nheart attack is a clogged artery but\nwhat we also know is that your\ncholesterol level over the course of\nyour lifespan will lead to occlusion of\nthe artery that this thing matters more\nand this things matters more and this\nthing matters more right so then what\nhappens in our Western system of\nmedicine so here is a heart attack\ncaused by a occlusion\nof a coronary artery\nand then what are the risk factors that\nlead to coronary occlusion\ncholesterol\ninflammation\nokay well what is what determines\ncholesterol\nexercise\ndiet\ngenetics\nokay what leads to inflammation\nlike everything\ndiet\ngenetics\ngut microbiome\ny'all with me\nand so Western medicine is just an\nabsolute Beast for some things\nlike cystic fibrosis man this is\nfreaking amazing\ncystic fibrosis is caused by\na\nsingle\nGene\nmutation\nthere ain't risk factors and stuff if\nyou've got two copies of the recessive\ngene you're screwed\nand so if we replace this Gene the\ncystic fibrosis goes away there are some\nkinds of cancer\nlike CML for example\nthink this is right right we sort of\nfigured out like an antibody we figured\nout one thing where we can like\nbasically this is CML I feel like I'm\nblanking here but there's all kinds of\nstuff there's like her2\nnew positive cancers in her2 new\nnegative cancers\nand then we're really good at stuff like\nmicrobiology\nand infectious disease\nwe let Crush all of the systems of\nmedicine when it comes to this you've\ngot a bug in you the bug causes a\nproblem\nwe're going to give you an antibiotic\nthat's going to kill the bug and the\nproblem will literally disappear you\nwill be cured\nwe can\nhopefully soon we can cure cystic\nfibrosis there's some diseases in\nmedicine that we can cure\nwhich of the diseases we can cure the\nones that have a linear\nEdo pathogenesis\nwe can't cure all of them but we sort of\nfigure it out now the more that a\ndisease moves away from this concept the\nworse we get at Western medicine\nif you have IBS your PCP is going to\nsend you to a Cardiologist or GI doctor\nand a psychotherapist and they're going\nto each Act independently\nokay\nbut there's no uniform thing and why\nisn't there a uniform thing because\nthere's so much crap to learn over here\nso when I literally have a patient\nwith psychosomatic illness\nthis is what I do with them okay\nso the first thing is we know that\nthere's some genetic predispositions\nwhat do we do about it nothing\ncan't really do much about it right so I\ndon't do gene therapy in my office but\nfor you to understand\nthat part of this is genetic but then\nyou may say but Dr K like then what's\nthe point of talking about it so this is\nwhy I talk to my patients about Karma\nwe'll get to this later all right but to\nunderstand that as a human being there\nis a narrative and a reason\nfor you being the way that you are and\nthere is a therapeutic modality to kind\nof like talk to people about this stuff\nand when I talk to my patients about\ntheir karma it helps them make sense of\ntheir real of their life it gives them a\nsense of narrative narrative\nso karma leads to narrative\nand narrative\nheals trauma\nthis is scientific\nthis is not\nsecond thing social factors so there's a\ncouple of things that we have to keep in\nmind\nthe first is I know it's kind of weird\nbut what is your relationship\nwith illness\nand this may sound kind of weird because\nhow is that like a social Factor like I\ndon't know how else to put this but when\nyou were raised\nit helps to understand how you were\nsocialized\nso like if your stomach hurts what did\nyou learn about life how did other\npeople treat you\nwhat was reinforced and not reinforced\nbecause what's happening is that\noftentimes the wrong things are\nreinforced in our upbringing and then we\npropagate those things so one example of\nthis is overvalued\nideas\nand catastrophizing\nso what this means is that and there's\nalso like social consequences so if my\nstomach rumbles that means that I'm\nscrewed\nthat means that I can't have fun today\nthat means that I need to leave which\nthen leads to social isolation\nso this all this crap is like you have\nto unpack right because every time\nbecause you have to understand that your\nyour body is has visceral afferents that\nare hypersensitive which means that you\nmay technically be completely fine\nbut the way that you were wired is to\namplify a normal signal Into the Danger\nZone and then you have behaviors once\nyou enter the danger zone\nso this is something that I also have to\nhelp people with who are like actively\npsychotic\nwhen you're actively psychotic and there\nis a devil trying to break down your\ndoor you are getting a danger signal\nthat leads to a behavior\nsince the devil is trying to break down\nthe door I better jump out the window\nproblem is you're on a third story of a\nbuilding I literally had a patient who\nthat broke both of their legs so part of\nmy treatment for this patient is the\nsignals that you are receiving there\nneeds to be space between the signals\nthat you receive and what you do\nokay this goes back to this\nwhere do we create that space this is\nwhere we create that space between the\nstressor and the response there needs to\nbe space\nokay so if you're someone who struggles\nwith psychosomatic illness and this is\nwhat CBT does as well so if we look at\nthis this is going to be CBT CBT will\nteach you train you\nto create a space between your visceral\nafferent information in your behaviors\nand all this kind of stuff in the middle\nso the other thing that we need to do\nand this is all okay so upbringing\nFactor so this is where\nyou know this is where we kind of think\nabout parental reinforcement\nwhen you were sick what did it do for\nvarious parts of your life\nright you need to think about that\ndid it\ndid it give you\nwere you excused from duties\nand if that's the case then some part of\nyour mind is going to have figured that\nout right and then what's going to\nhappen is when you feel stressed and\nthings are overwhelming\nand you need you wish stuff would go\naway\nyou will get sick\nnow why are you getting sick are you\ntrying to get out of responsibility a\npart of you is but that doesn't mean\nthat what you feel is not real\nright that also means that when you're\nstressed your cortisol levels are going\nto increase the inflammation is going to\nincrease we're going to see nor\nadrenaline dumping into your system and\nit's going to physiologically create all\nthese problems as well it is neither\neither or it is psychosomatic\nand this is what we know so people who\nhave psychogenic seizures which are like\nfake seizures\nfifty percent of them or more have real\nseizures as well so our mind is going to\nlearn to use whatever [ __ ] tools it\nhas at its disposal\nand that can include your own illness\nyour very real physiologic illness to\nget excuses from stress because your\nmind it's not even a getting excuse\nthat's the wrong way it's a way to\nremove stress our brain is like hey\nwe've got too much stress we can play\nthis card and it'll make the stress go\naway we're going to play that card\nbecause it's too overwhelming trauma\nso when we get traumatized\nwe become lexothermic\nwe dissociate\nand then we have a problem\nbecause we've got a stressor\nwhich by the way\nis a Amplified visceral afferent\nright we've got a hypersensitive nerve\nwhich then travels to our brain\nand then is perceived by our mind\nand then induces\nphysiologic changes\nincrease adrenaline\nincrease cortisol\nand by the way I don't know if you all\nknow this but cortisol increases\ninflammation\nand as we've learned\nwhat do these things do\nwe have visceral afferent\nhypersensitivity so our tissues react to\nthat our heart starts pumping faster\ninflammation in the gut right so\nremember that IBS is caused by allergy\nof the gut hyperactivation of\ninflammation so when we get inflammation\nin the gut our gut starts to feel weird\nwe get inflammation increases visceral\nafferent we stress ourselves out goes\nback to the brain it's a cycle\nnow remember this goes back to Freud so\nwe've got to thank the dude for a couple\nof things\none of the things that he discovered is\nthat once we make the unconscious\nconscious we can act upon it\nso as we become less Alexa thymic so\nright now what's going on is that this\nis just passing straight through\nbut once we raise awareness of this we\ncan utilize our mind to dampen the\nsignal\nso as you become emotionally aware\nliterally that stress does not pass\nstraight through to your physiology\nthis is why Psychotherapy helps with\npsychosomatic illness it is not that I\nhopefully I've convinced y'all at this\npoint\nthe problem is all of this\nwhy does psychosomatic why does\nPsychotherapy works it's because we can\ninterrupt the cycle in one place but\nPsychotherapy does not cure\npsychosomatic illness it just helps\nbecause we're utilizing this\nand someone else like let's say\na cardio a cardiologist may give you\nsomething to reduce the effect of\nadrenaline like a beta blocker\nokay so we can intervene at every one of\nthese places and it just happens that\nPsychotherapy is one of them the problem\nis that our physiologic understanding of\nall of this stuff sucks\nand so our medical doctors are not able\nto intervene in these Global holistic\nways\nand so like since this sucks we don't\nhave a good treatment for it which is\nwhy they get sent to a psychologist and\na psychologist can consistently help\nthis people therefore we concluded a\npsychological in nature it is not\npsychological in nature\nbut your mind is a tool that you can use\nto modulate the signals between your\nstressors and your responses\ndo we understand this\nis psychosomatic the same as autoimmune\nit's really freaking close but it is not\nthe same\nokay what the hell is this how do we get\nrid of this I don't even know what is\nthis\noh God\nokay great\nnext up reducing inflammation\nright so anti-inflammatory diet\nokay\nso actually we're going to move that\nI'll talk about this at the end let's\ntalk about inflammation and got together\nnow we're going to teach you some cool\nstuff\nthe other thing that we've got to do is\nreprogram our physiology and nervous\nsystem\nhow are we going to do this\nMind Body practices\nthings like meditation and especially\nyoga so how do you reprogram your brain\nyour physiology and your nervous system\nyoga and Tai Chi are like the best so\nlet's understand this so in patanjali's\nyoga sutras which is sort of like the\nseminal text on yoga the Bible of yoga\ncall it whatever you want\nwhen he talks about yoga posture yoga\nasan he doesn't write like a whole book\nright there are whole books on yoga\npostures\nlike can I find it on my shelf yes\nokay actually organized this bookshelf\nyou have books like the hata yoga\npradipika\nwhich is a text on yoga it's all about\nthe different postures all the different\nascens that you've got right let's see\nif there's pictures there's like this\nkind of crap where this dude is candle\ngazing there's this kind of crap where\nthere's like dude pouring water in his\nnose there's like\nthis kind of crap this posture\nlet's find another picture\nmy God pictures where there's this kind\nof crap right this is Hatha Yoga\npredipika all of these are awesome\nbut all of these things come from\npatanjali saying that there are two\nthings that make a yoga asan yoga\nposture it should be stable and it\nshould bring your awareness to the\npresent so when you do yoga what's\nliterally happening in your brain and\nthe original research that I did was in\na somatra sensory in the Neuroscience\nlab studying the somatosensory cortex on\nTai Chi at Harvard\nand what we basically discovered is that\nwhen you do yoga you enter this human\npretzel why do you turn in this human\npretzel it's not about flexibility\neveryone's like oh I want to do yoga for\nflexibility that's not why anyone does I\nmean that's why it's stupid no not\nstupid that's judgmental that's not what\nyoga is designed for\nthe purpose of yoga is to bring your\nsensory awareness to your body in the\npresent\nso the reason that I do this for a long\ntime why do we hold postures is that the\nlonger you hold a posture and if you get\nthat right kind of stretch your\nattention goes to a particular part of\nyour body\nso literally what are you remapping this\nvisceral sensory afferent right this is\nthe term that we use the nerves that\ndetect things in your gut or in your\nheart\nthat are hypersensitized when we do yoga\nin Tai Chi we recalibrate those because\nwhat are you literally doing with your\nbrain what you're doing with your brain\nis focusing your attention on a\nparticular thing away from a particular\nthing\nyou're literally and this is what we\nsort of found in our lab was you are\nremapping like that part of your brain\nthe somatosensory afferent partner it\nlooks like a\ngoing on there whatever\nright I'm activated\nI had coffee on an empty stomach today\nthat's probably why I have this going on\nhypersensitivity\nskin reaction y'all are seeing it happen\nlive because of my diet\nthat's funny\nso yoga and Tai Chi what they're going\nto do is re sort of recalibrate that\nsort of like sensory mapping okay and\nwhat I've sort of found when I have\npatients that consistently do yoga their\nrelationship to their body changes\nand something just weird happens with\nyour somatosensory cortex it kind of\nrewires and that signal of like after\nnerve into the brain changes so the the\nlab that I was in was studying chronic\npain and Tai Chi\nand what we sort of discovered was this\nthing that the in chronic pain\nour brain is sort of locked into pain in\na particular way in that Tai Chi\nactually like increases neuroplasticity\nin that part of our brain and reduces\nThe Chronic pain via neuroplasticity so\nthis is why if you look at studies on\nyoga and Tai Chi they're Superior to\nexercise\nwhen it comes to some of these things in\nterms of outcomes the question is why\nbecause it's not just about pumping your\nbrain it is about your I mean start\npumping your heart it's about brain\nsensory attention and like rewiring that\ncrap\nwhich is what yoga and Tai Chi do now\nthere are a couple of other really\ninteresting things with yoga and Tai Chi\nwhich is that they also work on some of\nthis this business so this stuff over\nhere right remember like our business\nabout like the vasoconstriction and\nbaroreceptors and all this kind of stuff\nwhen we do yoga postures like handstands\nand when we do these different kinds of\npostures what happens is like we dilate\nand constrict different parts of our\nvasculature and breathing and like all\nthat kind of stuff like rolls in there\nand it's somehow like recalibrates that\nstuff in the positive direction\nso what I've observed clinically is that\nyoga and Tai Chi work on all of these\ndifferent levels so there's a sensory\nattentional component there is a\nphysiologic component like literally if\nyou think about\ndoing a headstand what do you think\nthat's doing to your cerebral blood flow\nit is changing the way that it is\nchanging the load of cerebral blood flow\nand it's changing the way that your\nvasculature response responds to now\nyou've got gravity moving in the\nopposite direction if you've got gravity\nmoving in the opposite direction now\nyour your blood vessels need to adapt\nonce your blood vessels adapt\nyou are changing this fixed pattern once\nyou change this fixed pattern we are\nbreaking this cycle\ndo you all get that so one of the things\nthat we know is that the key to Healing\nthis is my belief the key to Healing\npsychosomatic illness is re-engaging the\nadaptive systems of our body and brain\nour body is locked into a cycle and we\nneed to break that cycle\nwe can do it mentally\nthrough psychotherapy\nand we can do it physiologically\nand stuff like a physiologic\nreprogramming exercise helps too\nthe last thing that we're going to talk\nabout is diet\nor brain gut and whole body inflammation\nso what we know is that this leads to\nthis\nand this also leads to things like\nneurotransmitter precursors\nand so by adapting our diets to be low\ninflammation and eat\nthe right kind of things and I actually\nthink that\nso this is going to be a less\nevidence-based recommendation\nbut I love ayurvedic diet for this kind\nof stuff so I think if you look at it's\nkind of interesting earlier I was a big\nbig fan of ayurveda and I said ayurveda\nwas great and I pointed to a couple of\nscientific studies which were actually\nvery weak in their effect size and\npeople from our community were like hey\nthis this study isn't very good so I\nreread the studies and I think the\nscience behind ayurveda is not there but\nwhy do I believe in ayurveda so a couple\nof things the first is that remember\nwe're talking about the linear\nidiopathogenic\nidea from Western medicine one thing\ncauses one problem causes one disease\nayurveda is different\nayurveda believes in systems so ayurveda\nand Chinese medicine do not think that\none thing causes one disease in fact\nthey think the exact opposite that any\nproblem is connected to all other\nproblems and that all these things over\nhere connect to all of this stuff over\nhere\nso that's why for mental illness they\ngive things for\nthe the first line uh first line\nayurvedic treatment is dietary change\nthat's why if you look at ayurvedic\nmedicine\nit's not medicine aimed to treat a\ndisease it is stuff like ashwagandha so\nashwagandha is in in ayurveda what's\ncalled a brain tonic what does that mean\nthey're not trying to cure some problem\nin the brain what they're trying to do\nis provide the brain with certain herbs\nthat encourage healing or they just\npromote the health of the brain so what\ndo we know about scientific studies of\nashwagandha\nscientific studies of ashwagandha\ndemonstrate that ashwagandha induces\nneuroplasticity\nit allows your brain to rewire\nnow it doesn't fix a particular thing it\njust allows you to rewire your brain now\nin what way it rewires\nit just it removes something from read\nonly to edit mode that's what\nashwagandha does in the brain\nand if you do that what kind of benefits\nwill you get will it help for trauma\nyeah\nwill it help for chronic pain\nyeah will it help for anxiety yeah\nbut it is not a treatment for any of\nthose things\nand so the problem is that the way that\nwe study Eastern medicine\nis from this linear idiopathogenic model\nand the treatment so if you go to an\nayurvedic doctor and you say if a\npatient has anxiety what would you give\nthem they'll say I'll give them if\nthey've got dementia what would you give\nthem I'll give him ashwagandha if\nthey've got chronic pain what would you\ngive them I'll give him martial Gunther\nbut it's not a treatment for any of\nthose things\nbecause in their model their whole\nsystem is different they think in terms\nof systems\nand so from a diet standpoint\nright so you can use whatever\nevidence-based diet you want high fiber\nmoderate amount of protein I know a lot\nof people are intermittent fasting and\nketosis and stuff like that jury's still\nout on that stuff TBH right I think\nthere's like a part of that that's a fad\nbut ayurvedic diet I think is the best\npersonally so this is not and this is\nwhat I I explained to my patients that\nthis is a recommendation here's the\nbiological plausibility there's an\nethical component to recommending\ncomplementary alternative medicine\nand it is to let people know hey there\nare not studies on this this is why I\nbelieve it here's the biological\nplausibility here's what the science\nshows here's what the science doesn't\nshow it is your choice whether you want\nto engage in it or not and generally\nspeaking the recommendations that I make\nfrom ayurveda are more diet related\nbecause there are some medicines in\nayurveda that are toxic\nlike they'll give people Arsenic and\nMercury as a part of their\nmedical treatment so I do not advocate\nfor that\nthat's why I'm talking about dietary\nchange right because that's where like\nalso there's like evidence-based reasons\nto recommend it so usually ayurvedic\ndiets are also higher in fiber than the\nbasic like American diet for example so\nthey there's a lot of evidence-based\ncomponents to it when I make recommend\nmake diet recommendations but the key\nthing about ayurvedic diet is they won't\nsay three servings of fruits and\nvegetables they'll say that an apple is\ndifferent from a mango in terms of what\nit'll do for your body or brain but I\ncan make that recommendation I feel\nreally comfortable as a medical doctor\nbecause I explained to my patients that\nI say either way you're getting fruit\nand here's the scientific benefits of\nfruit there just may be an additional\nbenefit to eating mangoes instead of\napples you want to give it a shot or not\nlet's see whether it works for you or\ndoesn't work for you\nso when it comes to brain gut and\ninflammation I think ayurvedic diet is\nthe best thing to do personally\nright and that's what I use clinically\nnow if y'all are thinking about\ninstituting dietary changes you should\nabsolutely talk to your doctor about it\nbecause there are other things to\nconsider as well\nthis is a long way of talking about if\nyou've got psychosomatic illness let's\nwrap up\nfirst thing to understand is that as\npsycho and somatic there's all kinds of\nstuff going on in the nervous system\nwith inflammation with your particular\ntissues\nthere's absolutely a\nupbringing component\nand when there is an upbringing\ncomponent we send you to Psychiatry or\npsychology\nright because we're the only ones that\nreally deal without bringing\nso you absolutely need to understand the\nrelationship between your body's signals\nand your life as a whole\nwhen my body sends the signal what does\nit mean to me how do I make conclusions\nabout it\nsecond thing we really need to do is\nimprove alexithymia and integrate really\nour mind into this process because for\nmost people who are who have\npsychosomatic problems\ntheir mind is removed from the process\nit's not that it's weak It's that or\neven that their mind is like we blind\nourselves to a part of it and then we\npush the rest through\nand then that means that a stressor\ndirectly impacts our physiology without\nthe mind being able to modulate it so\nthat's something you need to fix\nso whether you want to work on Alexa\nthymia we've got YouTube videos about\nthat we've got right in the fields about\nthat you want to see a psychotherapist\nthere's a lot of good benefits to\npsychotherapy for this kind of stuff\nbut then the next thing is literally\nlike neuroplasticity kind of stuff it's\nre restructuring your physiology\nrestructuring your your neuroplasticity\nso that this cycle gets affected\nand mind-body practices there's like you\nknow studies that show that Tai Chi is\neffective for fibromyalgia right so you\ncan make that recommendation like pretty\nsquarely\nand we know that yoga and fibromyalgia\nand stuff are going to help I mean sorry\nyoga and meditation are going to help so\nmeditation will help too\nexercise will help too diet will help\ntoo\nand now some of y'all may be saying and\nwhat kind of diet so you know y'all can\ncheck out Dr K's guide we go into more\ndetail about a lot of like if y'all are\ninterested in in\na lot of these systems\nyou'll get more understanding of it\nthrough things like Dr K's guide but we\ndon't necessarily focus on that it's\njust our perspective on Mental Health in\nthe mind involves these perspectives\nright so when we have for example like\nwhen we talk about anxiety and our\nanxiety guide there's a whole lecture on\nthe physiology of anxiety and meditation\npractices that harness that physiology\nso that if you're trying to conquer\nanxiety it is not purely to be conquered\nin the mind it is to be conquered\nthrough inflammation it is to be\nconquered through the brain is through\nto be conquered through physiology and\nit is to be conquered through the mind\nso the other difference is that when I\nlook at mental illness I do not think of\nit as mental\nall mental illness is psychosomatic\nall physical illness is psychosomatic\nall illness is psychosomatic if if all\nillness was not psychosomatic Placebo\nwould not exist\nthe mind has the capacity in 1873\nthere was a French\npsychiatrist I believe who wrote this\nbook called\nessays the physiology philosophic\nbutcher de France pronunciation\nin this he had a ward of like 80\npatients or something 83 patients\nsomething like that I forgot exact\nnumber\nbra goes in there and gives them all\nsome medicine\ngives them whatever medicine they have\nthen he goes back 15 minutes later and\nhe says oh my God I have given you the\nwrong medicine I don't I can't do a\nFrench accent\nhe says I've given you something that\nwill induce vomiting and is to be given\nto patients after they ingest poison to\nget the poison out of their body\nthis was back before the days where we\nhad ethical boards where you can't do\nthis kind of crap to people\neighty percent of them started vomiting\noh no there's a problem with our camera\nso he so this this French doctor\ntells them that it's going to induce\nvomiting and 80 off of vomit so all\nillness is psychosomatic because the\nmind is integrated into the rest of the\nbody\nand so if you all really want to conquer\nthis stuff you must educate yourself in\nall of these systems because the basic\nweakness in our system of medicine there\nare some pcps by the way that are really\ngood at this stuff they've basically\nbecome psychosomatic specialists\nis that there's like it's like trans\norgan system\nso it's like lots of different organ\nsystems rolled into one and why did I\nget good at it because everyone's like\nPsychotherapy works\nbut just because Psychotherapy Works\ndoesn't mean that it's mental\nit just means that\nthe mind can have an effect\nso what I strongly recommend that you'll\ndo first of all don't give up hope\nthe reason that crap doesn't work is\nbecause we haven't understood this stuff\nit doesn't mean that the disease is not\ntreatable or that even you can\ntheoretically be cured so instead what\nyou really got to do is Leverage\neverything that you've got\nright you have to work on all of these\nlevels on the gut microbiome level and\nI've had patients by the way that have\nhad really great pcps that did really\nweird stuff\nlike I don't recommend this but you know\nthe guy did something off label which is\nhe gave a course of antibiotics busted\nup my patients gut bacteria and then\ngave them a very specific course of\nprobiotics\nand basically went like nuclear on the\ngut bacteria and then repopulated rapid\nexpanded into the space\nand this patient had IBS for like 15\nyears and has not had symptoms since\nright but then you also have to maintain\ngood diet and stuff to keep your gut\nbacteria healthy but there's all kinds\nof stuff out there so don't give up hope\nand use as many of these mechanisms as\nyou can\nwhether it's mental and going going to\nsee a psychotherapist and by the way we\ndidn't talk about psycho for I mean\npharmacology but Pharmacology can\nabsolutely be helpful as well right so\nwe showed for example that nature review\nwhich showed that beta blockers can help\noctreotide can help like all these\ndifferent kinds of medicines can help\nthe problem is that they're going to fix\none piece of that\nso all that stuff is good\nand it's not even like this is what I'm\nsaying is that there's a fundamental\nproblem with the way that we practice\nWestern medicine which doesn't make it\nthe cardiologist's fault\nright it's not that your cardiologist is\nbad or anything they're great but\nthey're really good at doing what\nthey're good at\nlike it's what it's like we may not be\nvery good at psychosomatic Illness but\nyou can literally like\nand we can take your heart out of your\nbody and give you a new one\nyou can have completely non-functioning\nkidneys and we can hook up you up to a\nartificial kidney\nthree times a week and keep you alive\nfor like 15 years so we're really good\nat what we're good at\nit's in these non-linear idiopathogenic\ndiseases that Western medicine really\nstruggles but the other thing that I\nwant you all to think about is\neverything that I've been able to teach\nyou today I'm not talking to you about\ndorschas and energy and you know Prana\nand all this kind of stuff everything\nI'm talking to you all about today is\nscience\nright where did I learn all this stuff\nthis is this is all like this is good\nstuff man like we have lots of cool\nstudies we're finally figuring out\nWestern Sciences figuring all this stuff\nout that it's more complicated than we\nthought and this is what you're going to\nsay but Dr K you're just basically\nsaying yoga meditation diet go see your\ndoctor and exercise is the answer\nyes but that's what everyone says to do\nthat's what everyone says to do because\nit works the problem what I sort of find\nwhen I explain this stuff is people\ndon't understand how it works right\nthey're like exercise feels bad and\neveryone's trying to exercise because\nyou all want to exercise so that you can\nlook fit\nno one's exercising to reprogram your\ninternal physiology and fix paradoxical\nvasoconstriction if you want to [ __ ]\nlook fit and impress people take a\npicture and apply a filter the rest of\nthe internet is doing it anyway\nif you want to rewire your your brain\nand your physiology then do exercise\nyoga and meditation not for [ __ ]\nlikes on Instagram\nunderstand that if you want to heal your\nbody you have to heal your body what\nkind of answer are you looking for are\nyou looking for a pill to take looking\nfor a pill to take are one thing to do\nto fix all of your problems is what\nwestern medicine excels at and what got\nus into this problem in the first place\nit's not your fault that you were abused\nor traumatized or become Alexa thymaker\nyour karma or whatever but this is the\nbody and mind and brain that you live\nwith today\nthe question is what are you going to do\nabout it because unfortunately my\nprofession has dropped the ball\nwe have tons of patients who go to\ndoctors and doctors don't take them\nseriously\nmy symptoms are real I feel bloated all\nthe time the doctor's like I don't know\nwhat to do about that go see a therapist\nit's very demeaning\nand also\nwe don't know what to do about that\nbecause that's not how we're trained we\ncan try this medicine we can try this\nmedicine well medicine ain't gonna fix\nit\nthe stuff this I mean hopefully that'll\nchange one day I'm optimistic medicines\ncan help\nbut it ain't like cystic fibrosis where\nyou can replace the Gene and everything\nwill happen\nright there's some it's not like\nantibiotics like there's some stuff that\nis whole body and as doctors some like I\nsaid there's some pcps that are really\ngood at this but generally speaking\nwe're not good at whole body medicine\nso good luck\nforeign"
