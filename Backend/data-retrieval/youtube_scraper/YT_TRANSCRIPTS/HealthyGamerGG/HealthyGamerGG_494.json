    "transcript": "even problems like procrastination can\nbe influenced by inability to regulate\nour emotions so like when we're\nprocrastinating like we want to do\nsomething but we're not really able to\ndo it and sometimes like what we use to\nprocrastinate so let's say I\nprocrastinate by watching YouTube or\ntwitch and when I procrastinate what\nthat actually does when I watch YouTube\nor twitch what it actually does is\ndestroys my motivation but soothes my\nemotions because when you watch like\nstuff on the internet and like look at\nmemes and stuff you kind of get some\ndopamine you kind of like stop you\nforget about all the problems in your\nlife and stuff like that but the problem\nis it destroys your motivation so in\norder to cope with our negative emotions\nwe sacrifice our motivation and what\nthat looks like is procrastination"
