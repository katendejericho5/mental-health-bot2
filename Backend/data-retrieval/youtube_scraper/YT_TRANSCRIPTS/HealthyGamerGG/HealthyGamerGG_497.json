    "transcript": "this is how dreams work so when you've\ngot a bunch of emotions when you stop\nand dream what happens is you feel those\nemotions if someone's chasing you in a\ndream you're actually really scared\nright like that fear is 100 real if\nthere's lust in a dream like I don't\nknow if you've had those kind of dreams\nbut like you know what I'm saying like\nthat that's some that's some good\ndreaming right there but so really what\nhappens when we dream is the emotions\nthat we feel are real it's not about\nlike the circumstances of the dream so\nthere was like I was driving a car and\nthen a giant tooth came and smashed my\ncar and then once I was smashed in the\ncar I turned into a rabbit and then I\nflew up into the sky and I saw the eye\nof God and the eye of God was crying all\nthat like imagery crap I don't think\nthere's a whole lot of very solid\nscientific evidence that like the tooth\nmeans something and the eye of God means\nsomething but what we do know more\nscientifically is that the emotions that\nyou've stored up throughout your time\nduring the day or your life will come\nout in dreams"
