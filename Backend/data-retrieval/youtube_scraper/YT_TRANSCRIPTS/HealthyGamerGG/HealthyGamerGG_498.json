right the people\nwho are traumatized and addicted and oh\nmy God and like we're gonna help you\nlike fix your life right and there's\nalso a group of us that are like all\nabout optimizing performance and like\nfinding like your best inner self and\nlike I did some work at like Harvard\nBusiness School where we're like oh my\nGod like let's help you like achieve\nlike your dreams and all this kind of\nstuff right it's about like becoming\namazing or calling out of the pit we're\nreally good at helping people get away\nfrom bad stuff or go to really good\nstuff\nbut we don't have a whole lot of advice\nfor people that are just kind of like\nchilling in the parking lot of life\nright you're not really going anywhere\nyou're not really running away from\nanything just kind of chilling so what\nshould y'all do if you're ready to take\nthe next step on your mental health\nJourney check out Dr K's guide it's an\nimmersive resource that distills over 20\nyears of my experience laid out in a way\nthat is tailored to your needs so if\nyou're ready to better understand your\nmind and take control of it check out\nthe link in the description below and\ntoday we're going to talk a little bit\nabout if you're kind of an average\nperson which let's be honest is like the\nmajority of people out there\nwhat you should be thinking through and\nwe're going to share a couple of things\nthat you need to think through because\nfor average people what I've found and\nthat's actually the majority of people\nthat I've worked with at some time when\nI was working like you know outpatient\nmedicine at a hospital you get average\npeople they're not CEOs they're not all\naddicts they're like people who are like\nmarried with two kids and have pensions\nand mortgages and like whatever they're\njust average people and even with\nworking with them I've sort of found\nthat there are two things that are\nreally really important to think through\nif you're average so the first thing\nthat I noticed working with average\npeople is that they are both risk averse\nand passion averse and this is what this\nkind of looks like right so if you think\nabout your life and how you made your\ndecisions you had this internal voice\ninside you that was kind of saying like\nhey bro we should get a job and then\nthere's another part of you that's like\nas a rock star and what you do with that\ninternal voice is you're like yes yes\nyes we shouldn't get a job but like not\nas a rock star and so when I work with\naverage people what I sort of find is\nthat they have a lot of their behaviors\nare kind of like avoiding risk and this\nis probably the way that they were\nconditioned where you sort of think\nthrough how you want to live your life\nand like how did you pick your job or\npick your major you probably pick\nsomething that like is safe right like\nyou're like an accounting major or you\ndecided to become a web developer and\nyou're not someone who's gonna like drop\nout of college to like start a company\nbecause that's crazy we're not going to\ndo that and at the same time they're\noftentimes passions that these people\nhave like if you're kind of like an\naverage person who's an exceptional at\nanything chances are you have been\npassionate about something like you've\nbeen like super excited about maybe\nlearning how to play guitar or becoming\na rock star or something like that but\nthen you do something really interesting\nwhich is that you are very\nself-critical or judgmental towards your\npassions there's some voice inside you\nthat's like that's silly right there's\nsomething about risk aversion and\npassion aversion where you're not\nactually like very open to your passions\nyou don't do things because that would\nbe silly and so if we sort of think a\nlittle bit about if you do this in life\nwhere is that going to end up so if your\nrisk averse like that's good in a lot of\nways and if you're passion averse that's\ngood in a lot of ways because if we\nthink about who drops out of school\nthose people are like Pro risk and pro\npassion right I'm gonna drop out I'm\ngonna start a company because I believe\nin myself but some of us just aren't\nwired that way and we're more\nrisk-averse some passion averse\nso how do you address this first of all\nnotice if you do this this is the first\nthing to do right is there an inner\nvoice that you sort of say like hey\nthat's silly We're not gonna do that\nright do you do that and if the answer\nto that question is yes then if you want\nto be like a little bit more passionate\nexceptional whatever in life we need to\nactually Stoke that flame a little bit\nwe can no longer keep suppressing it and\nso this is what I'd recommend that you\ndo and this is the kind of work that I\ndo with people I'll ask people who are\naverage who come into my office\ntell me about things that you wanted to\ndo but that you thought were like kind\nof silly or idiotic to do and what ended\nup happening and so what happens is when\nyou sort of quiet that voice or you\nsquash that voice or you're critical of\nit and maybe your parents did the same\nthing by the way did you have some like\ninteresting desire or passion with your\nparents like oh that is you can't major\nin arts alok you should do medicine or\nengineering that's your options right\nlaw Finance computer you can do computer\nthat's so that one is okay\nthere's a limited set of options you\ncan't do anything else\nthe second thing is if you sort of find\nthat you have done that to yourself now\nthe question becomes how do you change\nthat and that's where what I'll really\nencourage people to do is move towards\ntheir passion and especially move\ntowards a little bit of risk now this is\nwhere things get a little bit tricky\nbecause I'm not suggesting that you do\nrisky things so don't do things that are\ndangerous but as I'll work with people\nlike in my office I'll ask them what is\nsomething that you've always wanted to\ndo that you thought was silly and so I\nhad one patient who was like you know\nI've always wanted to go skydiving or\nI've always wanted to do karaoke but I\nfeel like an idiot doing karaoke I've\nalways wanted to learn how to sing like\nI think singers are the coolest things\nand the coolest people in the world but\nlike I've never known how to sing I'm\ntone deaf they make all these kinds of\nexcuses they're this kind of rational\npart of them that is risk averse is\nactually telling them all the reasons\nwhy this is a bad idea\nand so I know it sounds kind of weird\nbut from an emotional standpoint what\nI'll sort of advocate for these people\nis that they start to actually tolerate\nsome of that risk and even embrace it\nnot do things that are stupid but hey if\nyou've always wanted to go skydiving\nyour life look into it if it's safe go\nskydiving\non the flip side if there's some part of\nyou that like has always wanted to\nacquire a skill but you felt too silly\ndoing it like sign up for singing\nlessons or voice lessons and like by all\nmeans learn how to sing start really\npaying attention to that critical voice\nand use start to think a little bit\nabout what you want to do and then also\ncatch it in the ACT that's the third\nthing so as I'm making these suggestions\nto you if you're an average person that\nthis applies to Chances Are you're\nfeeling a tiny bit uncomfortable because\nyou're like yeah like but who would\nactually do that right that's silly\nthat's crazy I wouldn't do that\nso notice that self-critical part and\nyou don't even need to fight it or\novercome it or combat it or anything\nlike that you can if you want to but the\nmost important thing is notice that you\nhave all these little impulses in your\nlife that the smarter more logical more\nrisk-averse part of you is squashing so\nthis is a situation where internally\nyou want to do something but externally\nthe world is telling you that this is\nsilly this is dumb this is whatever so\nthis is a discrepancy between the\ninternal and the external it turns out\nthat the reverse of that is also true\nwhere there's still a discrepancy but\nthe other crop of people that I've\nworked with who are average actually\nfeel internally content but the external\nworld is telling them that they need to\nbe doing more so maybe you're someone\nwho's saying to yourself like actually\nI'm okay like I'm a web developer and a\nmid-sized company you know I'm a paper\nsalesman in a mid-size company from\nPennsylvania and I'm actually pretty\nhappy with my life like I know that\nthere are a lot of people out there who\nare always talking about grinding and\nalways talking about this and people\nhave problems but like I'm actually kind\nof okay\nbut then there's usually a part of you\nthat is not okay with being okay that's\nkind of worried they're like but what if\nI like I should be grinding right like\nif I don't grind right now am I going to\nbe unhappy later in life like I you know\nI'm 26 I'm kind of chilling I I go on\none vacation or a year you know I can't\nafford first class I'm dating someone\nwho's like kind of okay like everything\nseems I'm actually like I don't feel\nlike I need to be grinding but maybe I\nshould be grinding the rest of the world\nis telling you that you should be more\npassionate and you should be like better\nand you should be hungrier and you\nshould be like creating passive income\nand you should be working at Google\ninstead of like whatever mid-size like\nweb development company you're working\nat and the external world is telling you\nthat you should be unhappy\nbecause people who are content with less\nthan everything are idiots and this is a\nhuge problem in our society we don't\nallow people to be content with average\nand so the second thing that I'll help\npeople work through is like they're\nactually okay with being average but\nthey're not okay with being okay with\nbeing average so they come to me looking\nfor permission or license or for me to\nsay hey it's actually okay for you to be\naverage so this is the second thing that\nyou need to worry about or think through\nwhich is that are you not okay with\nbeing average and if the answer is I'm\nnot okay then where does your doubt come\nfrom is it because you're afraid that in\nthe future if you don't grind right now\nyou could wind up in a situation where\nyou're filled with regret and you should\nhave grinded but here's the problem is\nthat like if you're some if just think\nabout that like if you're afraid of\nfuture regret that isn't even guaranteed\nbecause you're pretty content today that\ndoesn't actually create the motivation\nfor you to actually go out and grind and\nI've worked with average people who will\ntry that for a little while right\nthey're like well maybe one day I'll\nregret there's a possibility of regret\nso therefore let me grind today but\nthink about that like the possibility of\nfuture regret it's not even that you're\ngonna regret right like you could\nactually be totally fine for 40 years 50\nyears the rest of your life you could be\ncompletely happy but you're afraid that\nmaybe you won't be happy and so you end\nup trying to force yourself into\ngrinding when internally you're content\nand why does that happen because the\nrest of the world tells you that you\nshouldn't be content it is silly to be\ncontent where you are you're not dating\nsomeone who's a 10 out of 10 you don't\nhave a chiseled physique you're not one\nof the most beautiful people on the\nplanet you're not one of the richest\npeople of the planet how dare you be\ncontent\nand let's look at the flip side on the\nother hand we have people like\ncelebrities right who are some of the\nmost beautiful people on the planet who\nare some of the most successful people\non the planet who are some of the\nrichest people of the planet and are\nthey sitting there content every single\nday there are a couple of them that are\nactually like that and they rise to\nprominence because they're the exception\n50 of them are in [ __ ] rehab because\nthey've got addiction problems because\nthey're internally unhappy with\nthemselves so here is life telling you\nto chase all of this crap which like\nwhen everyone gets it leads them to\nrehab\nso the second problem that I find with\npeople who are average is that they do\nnot allow themselves to be content and\nnot grind because the external world is\ntelling them you shouldn't feel that way\nso if you're average I think first of\nall it's okay for you to be content it's\nokay for you to be content when you're\npoor it's okay for you to be content\nwhen you're rich it's okay for you to be\ncontent when you're average and now I'm\ngoing to draw on some of this Eastern\nstuff a little bit so like in the East\nthey think that if you want to be happy\nin life you need to do four things\nokay Dharma means Duty so like be like a\ndecent human being like do what you're\nsupposed to do get a job get married\nhave kids whatever okay if that's if\nthat's what you want second thing they\nsaid that's important to be happy in\nlife is artha which means wealth so if\nyou're an average person are you\nfinancially secure you should check that\nbox the third thing that you should do\nto be happy in life is gamma or pleasure\nso are you having fun on a day-to-day\nbasis like are you enjoying life do you\neat a good taco from time to time do you\ngo for a walk on the beach do you go for\nlike a middling vacation where you're\nrenting a car and eating at budget\nplaces but then have one nice meal so do\nthose three things and the four things\nis Moksha or Enlightenment and the key\nthing that I like about this philosophy\nis that in the East and this is\nbasically like Indian or Hindu\nphilosophy is they sort of assume that\nyou don't have to fix all of your\nproblems right at the beginning you can\nwork on one thing you can work on the\nsecond thing you can work on the third\nthing and then once you have all those\nthings settled later in life you will be\nmore it's okay to be discontent you\ndon't have to fix all of your\ncontentment in the first 25 years of\nlife it's actually totally fine for for\nyou to have a midlife crisis and then\nspeaks seek spiritual satisfaction it's\nactually normal for you when you're at\nthe age of 60 or 65 to start to worry\nabout what you're doing in this world to\nbecome discontent at the age of 60 and\nthen start your spiritual growth and\nthis is mirrored by the way in Western\npsychology as well if you look at the\nwork of someone like Eric Erickson\nand Eric Erickson basically said that at\ndifferent points in life there are\ndifferent things that are going to make\nyou unhappy and at the end of your life\nyou're going to take you're going to\nlike look at the whole life you've lived\nand you're going to be filled with some\namount of regret and the natural thing\nto do when you're 70 is to work through\nthat regret but the problem is in\ntoday's society we think that we have to\nlive perfectly today so that we avoid\nall regrets in the future and this is\nwhat tortures the average people that I\nwork with they're like how do I even if\nI'm content today how do I avoid regret\nin the future don't I need to be doing\nmore or meditating more or making more\nmoney and the answer is no if you're\ncontent today let yourself be content\ntoday will you have problems tomorrow\nyes\nand you don't need to do anything about\nit today you can let that problem arise\nwhen you're having your midlife crisis\nyou can let that problem arise when\nyou're 60 and you can actually work\nthrough it then you don't need to\ntorture yourself today make sacrifices\nto avoid hypothetical problems in the\nfuture this is actually how the worst\nway to live your life because now you're\nsolving for problems that you don't even\nknow that are happening and may not ever\nexist and you are sacrificing your\ncontentment today to avoid a\nhypothetical problem in the future and\nyou can live your entire life doing that\nand I have worked with people who are 70\nyears old who live their entire life\navoiding future problems and then what\nis the problem that they have they\nwasted their [ __ ] life solving\nproblems that never arised\norigin arose\nso if you're average first of all\ntotally cool no big deal\nmain thing you need to think about is\nfirst of all internally\nhave has there been a voice inside you\nhas there been some kind of passion are\nyou risk averse and passion averse and\nthe rest of the world told you hey don't\ndo that stuff because it's silly if it\ndid start to Tunnel down into that and\nstart to awaken that voice a little bit\nas you awaken that voice as you lean\ninto your passion you may One Day become\nexceptional\non the flip side if you're average and\nyou're actually okay with it you don't\nneed to be [ __ ] exceptional not\neveryone in life needs to be exceptional\nyou can chase it if you want to but if\nyou're happy it's okay to be happy and\nyou don't have to anticipate all the\nproblems in the future and start\ngrinding the day if you're in your 20s\nand you are actually enjoying the life\nthat you're living making a moderate\namount of money with moderate\nrelationships with a moderate amount of\nfun you do not need to sacrifice the\nbest years of your life to avoid some\nhypothetical problem down the road if\nthe rest of the world is telling you\nthat you need to be grinding but\ninternally your kind of content lean\ninto that baby\nand have some faith that if you've\ngotten this far and you learned how to\nbe content and you're kind of like you\nlean into that that'll actually protect\nyou against all the crap to come\nso I know it's kind of weird\nbut we spend most of our time helping\nthis as a society\ntwo poles of people the people who are\ndoing the worst in life and the people\nwho are doing the best in life and we\nactually ignore the most important chunk\nof people which are average people and\nso if you fall into that camp here's\nsome stuff that I hope will help you so\ngive it a shot think through it and let\nus know like if you're an average person\nyou've got some kind of other problem\npost on Reddit or like you know Post in\nthe comments or something like that and\nwe'll try to help you more because y'all\nare the people that we should be helping\nthe most the last thing to consider is\nthat if you want help getting through\nsome of this stuff I think working with\nlike a coach or a therapist is like a\nreally good idea if you're really\nquashing a lot of stuff and very\nself-critical then by all means like\ntherapy is like kind of a better thing\nbut the whole problem is that the system\nof psychotherapy was designed to help\npeople with pathology\nand then we have all this like positive\npsychology Optimal Performance like\nbusiness coaching kind of crap too but\nwhat about like all the average people\nand that's kind of what our coaching\nprogram is for it's sort of to help\npeople who are at all spectrums so we\nhave engineers at Google and we have\npeople who are like 24 and like have\ntheir first job and they're not really\nsure whether they want to be ambitious\nor not at the end of the day the\nmajority of people in the world are\naverage and that's perfectly okay\nbecause that doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you will be unhappy so think\nthrough some of the stuff and let us\nknow how it goes for you\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]"
