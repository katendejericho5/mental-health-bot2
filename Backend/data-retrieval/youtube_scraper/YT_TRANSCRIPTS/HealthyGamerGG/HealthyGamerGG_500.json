    "transcript": "the whole point of manipulation is\nthey're not going to ask you for\nanything they're going to induce\nemotions that makes you do it anyway\nthere's no space for recognition there's\nno space for appreciation it's always\nfixing problems so what you really need\nto learn how to do is separate out\nemotions from actions go through that\nprocess right and say like okay what\ndoes it feel like to not engage in the\nbehavior what would happen if I just\nride this emotion out and then your mind\nis going to tell you no no you need to\ndo it you need to do because it's your\nfault and hold on a second the most\nimportant thing is if you feel like you\nneed to do something the one thing that\nI would recommend is that you do it with\na clear head so wait until you are of\ncompletely clear head and then tell your\nmind we can do this thing no problem we\ncan absolutely do it I'm just going to\nwait till I'm calm wait till tomorrow\ntake a deep breath wake up fresh in the\nmorning go for a walk and then decide\nwhat you need to do you will be amazed\nat how that changes your behavior so\njust delay delay giving into the emotion\nokay"
