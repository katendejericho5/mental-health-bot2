    "transcript": "hello my friend hey how's it going there\nwe go we're good we're good\num yeah apologies for that I've my\ncamera died yesterday\nwhen I was streaming and um I had to\nlike fix some things\nabout it you know how it is\nI know how it is oh God like half the\nstreams I do is like tech support yeah\nand it's like okay what's wrong\num and what what would you like to how\nwould you like me to address you today\nah go with Daniel honestly all right you\nknow I feel it's more appropriate\nawesome and can you um just so so I have\nno idea what we're talking about today\num yeah sure I mean\num I mean I'm happy to talk about like\nkind of anxiety just mental health in\ngeneral kind of being a performer on a\nstage but also social anxiety is always\nthis weird juxtaposition in my life\num I I'm very introverted and I'm very\nshy and yet I have chosen this line of\nwork yeah a lot of a lot of introverts\ndo that we may learn there's some really\ninteresting statistics on on that but\nit's weird though isn't it because like\nbecause we're all so public and\noutspoken and that when we're hiding\nbehind a desk\num and I know that even being on camera\ntoday and kind of face to face with you\nit's like I'm shy even about that and I\nknow even getting ready for this I was\nlike adjusting my hair like for like\nfull 15 minutes and I was like oh God I\ngotta look nice\nand uh Daniel do you want to just start\nby telling us where we can find you I\nknow you're a huge content creator but\nwhat kind of content you're too kind\nyeah uh I'm RT game on Twitch and\nYouTube play video games live stream\nvideo highlights\num\nclues of the name game\nand anything in particular that you like\nto stream in terms of gaming like what\nkind of stuff can people find if they\ncome and watch everything they expect\nI mean we've been torturing people in\nCity skylines\num and we've also been the entire Earth\nin Minecraft so a bit of a mixed bag you\nknow yeah it's like murder but also a\nnice creative nice passion projects you\nknow yeah how is that you're playing the\nnew one I assume City skylines too no\nit's not out yet but I'm excited for it\nis here okay uh just kind of reliving\nthe first one yeah kind of gear it on up\nfor it yeah\nit's a game that I never really got into\nlike I like but oh you're missing out\nno it's a good fun one like honestly\nit's just like it's just sandbox and\njust kind of having fun and design shows\nawesome I love it and and I noticed you\nhave an accent where are you from\nuh Dublin uh um Irish uh so it's like I\nalways it's weird because like whenever\npeople pick up in the accent I always\nfeel like I have to give a disclaimer\nbecause this isn't really a Dublin\naccent\num just compared to like my peers that I\nknow here I'm Irish Canadian technically\num and I got just a lot of influence\nfrom my mum there lived in Ireland my\nentire life but my accent's always been\na bit scuffed interesting okay cool yeah\nyeah it's always like a weird disclaimer\nwhen people pick up on that because I\ndon't want to say I'm Irish because then\nthe Irish will be upset\nlaughs\nso it sounds like you think a lot about\nhow to say say things that don't I I do\nyes that's that's the old social anxiety\nyou know we got to spend a lot of time\nFraming and making sure we communicated\nokay yeah a lot of stuff on any toes of\ncourse and so there's there's a lot of\nuh\nyeah it's interesting right what is it\nwhat is it like when I point that out to\nyou is that\ndoes that make that I mean it's no it's\nit's just pretty accurate because that's\nsomething I I I mean I like to think I'm\nquite self-aware of stuff like that and\nI tried to pay attention to it\num but I mean no you're right I I like\nthat's just how I am I'm the kind of\nperson who I have to rehearse a phone\ncall before I have it\num you know and that's just social\nanxiety you know that's kind of how it\nmanifests sometimes\num I know that even for streaming as a\ncareer like something I'll always go\nover is like if I have like a bit or\nsomething I want to do on the stream for\nlike a while before the stream goes live\nI'm like mentally preparing it mentally\npreparing it mentally preparing it kind\nof going over and over\num and I just can't help it like that's\njust how my brain operates and it's\nalmost like reassuring to do that for me\nagain I know that's just kind of like a\nbit of the old social anxiety that's how\nthat's it manifesting\num but it's just how my brain operates\nand I'm just trying to be aware of it uh\nmore than anything is it\nwhat is it like for your brain to\noperate that way\nit's a bit panicked until I kind of calm\nmyself down is how it feels a lot of the\ntime\num I try to just practice a lot like\nmindfulness and kind of just almost like\nawareness uh for like the given moment\nand the situation because sometimes I'll\nstress about something like that when\nit's like I just need to say to myself\nyou're fine\njust stop you know and it's like and\nthen I'm fine and then I kind of get a\nhold of myself\num\nyeah it it it's just something I've kind\nof always had like it's just kind of how\nit manifests like\nyeah but I I noticed that you make a lot\nof statements like you know it's\nsomething I've always had it's just the\nway that I am it's the way that my yeah\nyeah I mean I I'm just yeah I always\nfeel like the need to say that as well\nit's just kind of being self-aware to it\nyou know I I\nknow these habits myself yeah um\nso I just try to pay attention to them\nit's like I know some of them I'll try\nand like kind of correct or catch myself\non to try and\nundo like kind of a mental trap and if\nthat makes sense\num\nwell I mean because sometimes I'm just\nanxious for the sake of it and there's\nnothing to really be anxious about you\nknow it's like my brain just overworked\noverworks itself and it's turned in a\nmile a minute and sometimes I'm just\nhave to be like cap on like yeah and you\nknow and and uh it's almost like kind of\na stern word with myself though but it\nis oddly reassuring uh to kind of have\nthat because I just catch myself on it\nyou know like sometimes I just kind of\nneed that uh\nwhat do you mean by oddly reassuring\num because I'm calling myself out of my\nhabit you know and it's like it's\nsomething that I know that's like that's\njust part of how my brain operates\nbut address I reminded myself of that\nfact\nkind of helps because uh it's not so\nmuch that like I'm doing something wrong\nhere or it's like no it's more so that\nthis is the way my brain is kind of just\nfunctions\num and has always been you know it's\njust acknowledging it for what it is\nrather than just kind of like because\nsometimes like if I'm getting anxious in\nthat I'll like also Guilt Trip myself\nlike how dare you be anxious in this\nmoment you know and stuff like that\nwhich is like you know I wanna and I\njust want to avoid that because that's\nnot productive that doesn't help\nanything\num so just acknowledge and\nthat my brain is wired this way and has\nalways been wired this way you know I\njust kind of learning to live with that\nand manage that rather than kind of be\nin harsh or negative towards myself\num about my own person you know because\nI think that's just healthier in general\nyou know there's no point beating myself\nup\nbut yeah so I'm noticing that when you\nfeel anxious which is a given by the way\nright\nabsolutely like unfortunately for our\nsake here uh being on camera always\nmakes me anxious uh okay it's just it's\nalways been a thing there's a weird\nirony in it just from doing this\npublicly and also I know that just\nrecently I had a big stream where I was\nliterally in front of a camera for like\nfive hours in front of like just a\nmassive green screen studio and\nrecording effects and stuff no anxiety\nthere confidence was fine uh for the\nmost part but it's like just sitting\ndown in front of like my desk and almost\nchatting it's like I feel I feel a\nlittle more anxious about that but I'm\ndoing okay what about confidence you\nmentioned that green screen your\nconfidence was okay is confidence not\nokay in situations like this\nsometimes it's a bit shaky it's just\nkind of reassuring myself like I can\nfeel it sometimes like it kind of Wells\nup like um when I get anxiety it's kind\nof like in my chest and it kind of like\nBrews up a bit and it feels like a\nbottle overflowing it's how I would\ndescribe it but it's just kind of calmed\nmyself down and it's like actually no\nyou're fine it's like nothing's really\noverflown it's just kind of steady and\nyou just kind of like\nit's common\nyeah it's weird so so it sounds like you\nreassure yourself a lot I do reassure\nmyself a lot yeah um I mean it helps me\nquite a bit apologies if you can hear an\nice cream fan uh by the way at the\nmoment he always comes around at this\nhour\nyeah\nis it okay if we hear an ice cream van I\ncan move them like closer to the window\nif you want I've never been able to\ncatch him because like the bastard\nalways comes around every time I'm like\nsat down to stream and it's like I'll\njust go live and it's like there he is\nagain I've never caught him once do you\nwant to do you want ice cream from him\nI wouldn't say no\nyeah sounds cool I I think we don't see\ntoo many ice cream trucks nowadays but\noccasionally they're there\noh no they're they're all fours here in\nIreland like it is I think it was\nraining like half an hour ago as well so\nI'm surprised the fucker's here but here\nwe are am I allowed to swear sorry yeah\nI should have checked that okay\nsorry no I I because I've watched some\npast ones like I know what Michael\nReeves and that like you know he he\nswore like a sailor a [ __ ]\num yeah but just making sure that's\nstill the case before uh you know I mean\nstart cursing violently yeah it's it's\nwhatever whatever you want to do I mean\nas long as you don't violate terms of\nservice or to you know yes no we should\nbe fine we should be fine\num yeah so so uh Daniel you've already\ngiven us so much stuff it's like so rich\nso I'm I'm hearing you know there's a\nlot of of what what was that what do you\nwhat is oh Jesus\nno no just like say that like I've\nalready given so much it's like oh God\nyou know just kind of exclaiming on it\nand what sorry\nthe Irish mannerisms are coming out a\nbit we're always like that we kind of\njust feel the needs of America on a lot\nof stuff okay ah Jesus oh wow you know\ncan you help me understand what is the\ndirection of that remark is that concern\nor positivity or just I just think it's\nkind of funny because like I I I it's\njust like because I'm here like I've\nbeen chatting about like and you know\nwe're trying to unpick my brain a bit\nand it's like we're 10 minutes in it's\nlike well there's a lot clearly here and\nit's like oh no I mean and and the the\nreason I think there's a lot is because\nyou are very self-aware\nAbby is too kind right and so I think\nit's like you've already figured a lot\nof this stuff out you figured out that\nyou have sort of a baseline function\nyou figured out that you can react to\nthat anxiety in a couple of ways so\nbefore we get to react we can talk about\nyou you figured out that there's certain\nenvironments that will evoke it or\ncertain environments that won't evoke it\nyou figured out that you can react\ntowards it in two different ways\nsometimes you're judgmental right and\nthis is where you can feel guilty and\nbeat yourself up or you can acknowledge\nit and you found that acknowledgment\nleads to sort of reassurance and calming\nof the anxiety and you kind of just talk\nto yourself\nyes and it sounds like you've gotten\npretty good at that\nI'd like to think so yeah I mean it's\njust it's trying to be more aware of it\nlike especially in more recent years\nthan that because like I oh God when did\nI first start therapy\nlike it would have been I want to say\n2017 but for like most of my life like\nit was kind of just like nah I'm not\ndoing that you know like it couldn't\npossibly mean it needs it\num it's very much like even the comment\non some of that just for some of the\nbackground like stigmas in Ireland\nunfortunately we're always a bit behind\nwith mental health and kind of just like\nbeing more public and open about it like\nwe've come a long way in recent years in\nparticular but even like 10 years ago\nlike it was like almost like the answer\nto most like kind of mental health\nproblems would just be but you're not\nman up you know which is not very\nproductive and doesn't help much\num you know so it takes us all a bit to\nget there I would say in this country\ncompared to most just because it's not\nreally been a conversation interesting\num I know yeah like I I like it it's\ndefinitely a bit of a change like I know\neven kind of talking to my parents about\nmental health and stuff like that like\nI've only been able to approach that in\nrecent years and before then it's just\nlike it's almost like it's a pressure\nthat's like can't talk about it just\ngotta deal with it and again not healthy\nnot productive in the slightest anyone\num\nI think that's almost like a product of\nan Irish Cultural thing though\num I'm fascinated by that\nokay really okay comfortable talking\nabout that in in can I ask you some\nquestions about that sure I mean go for\nit yeah let's go the culture and so uh\nDaniel can you tell us just a little bit\nabout like what growing up was like for\nyou like in you so you grew up in\nIreland right grew up in Ireland yeah\num I mean I was a very shy kid I had\nvery little confidence in person I had a\nfew close friends\num\nbut it was like very quiet I was deathly\nafraid of talking almost all the time I\nkind of just kept my head down and\nstudied all the time like when I was\njust kind of studying for school and\n[ __ ]\num\nlike it was very kind of uneventful and\nI would say that like I used to be very\nquiet and very and deathly shy to the\nextent I really wouldn't do anything and\nit I knew it always kind of made me\nunhappy too because I kind of felt like\neven as a kid that life is kind of\npassing me by at grandiose Notions to be\nhaving when you're like you know a\nlittle kid\num but I eventually kind of snapped out\nof that and I kind of had a bit more of\na realization that hey life's short so\nlet's try and undo some of those habits\num would kind of be some of the\nupbringing like like for a more wider\nlike Irish Cultural sense\num uh\nslagging is very much a thing there uh\nkind of just like making fun of each\nother uh and it it it's rampant and kind\nof just like especially like just going\nto Growing Up in Ireland it's kind of\nwhat we do because like we learn to\nlaugh at life as part of like kind of\nour culture and just our people because\nI mean for the Irish under history\nthat's what they've kind of had to do\nbecause it's all a bit depressing\num\nwell I mean I just Irish history in\ngeneral\num just like Colonial history and [ __ ]\nlike I kind of going like kind of quite\nfar back you know and just the Irish\nhaving a bit of a bad time\num through the years so I know like I I\nnoticed just from my granddad and my\nkind of my dad and that because he would\nhave got it from him and so on and so\nforth It's like you you kind of have to\nalmost laugh a bit at life to be able to\nprocess it in some capacity and I think\nthat is just part of our culture that's\nkind of gone on through the years I feel\nlike it's still prevalent even now and I\nthink it's still a good thing to have to\nlaugh at life a bit but then sometimes\nalso to treat it with a bit more kind of\nseriousness and gravitas is also kind of\nimportant and we're kind of stuck at\nthat bit because of this whole cultural\nthing hmm\num so it's a bit harder but we're\ngetting there we're getting there it's a\nlot better than it was say the least\nuh and so it sounds like you had uh you\nsaid that life was kind of passing you\nby what were you what were you noticing\nyou weren't taking what parts of life\nwere you missing out on oh God I mean I\nfelt like all I would do is just play\nvideo games and nothing else\num I would play video games I would\nstudy for school\num I don't know I went into uni as well\nlike um I could tell like I had\npassion for certain subjects but I had\nno idea what to do with any of it so it\nkind of just felt like\nwhat am I doing I'm kind of just\nexisting\num\nthe wake-up call for I guess to go into\nit a bit as well it might help but\npicking a pair at the old brain and that\num but in 2015 I suffered from a\ncollapsed lung of all things yeah it was\nlike scary it happened out of the blue\num apparently quite common if you're\njust a task and he led yeah\num the right body type for a close lung\nspontaneous yeah thorax\nyep and it was a bit shy\num\nand it was it was pretty rough as far as\nthe collapsed on goes because it\nactually had collapsed for four days\nuntil it was treated\num so it was actually gradually being\noxygen starved which was quite\nunfortunate to learn\num because they distracted me from the\nhospital almost immediately because the\nguy said oh yeah you're fine you can go\nhome when I really shouldn't have been\nlet home and I got like a frantic car\nwhen I was in college for my dad saying\nyou're supposed to be operated on now\nyou know it's like what\nand it was like almost shocking and I\nwas with all my friends at the time and\nI remember like because we had like a\nmeet-up for our College society and I\nwas just like casually I'm sorry I'm\nsupposed to be in hospital right now I\ngotta go\nwhich was wild\num you know so I mean that they patched\nme up that they fixed it uh but ever\nsince that I was like [ __ ] that was kind\nof scary and that was kind of harrowing\non my physical health that could have\nbeen really bad if they didn't weren't\nable to treat me as quick as they were\nultimately\num so from that on point on it was kind\nof like right I'm gonna try and live a\nbit more and I got a lot more confidence\nfrom that and it was like a very\nnoticeable change after that like I\nstarted being way more social\num I could just tell that like I kind of\nclicked better with people in person too\num social anxiety like is still very\nmuch there but it was significantly\nworse before that moment\nand it was kind of like almost like life\nis short that kind of came from that\nkind of moment of pain\num that really did it for me and really\nhelped me a lot\nlike in retrospect like it's\nit's weird thing to say in retrospect\nit's the best thing that probably ever\nhappened to me is having that long\ncollapse because it really did a 180 on\nme and my life\nyeah how does that work I know right\nbecause like what I know because because\nyou think like well maybe you could\nmaybe you could do the 180 without the\nlong given out you know and you'd hope\nso\num but it's just what it took for me in\nthe moment because it was just kind of\nGod like\nthis was actually really bad and it kind\nof just got me thinking about larger\nsome of life and my own shyness and\nstuff like that where it's like God I\ncould have just it got me the fix in on\nlike passions and stuff like that maybe\nthe best better way to put it can you\ncan you help us understand like what\nhappened in your mind so like so I get\nthat there's some vague sense of yeah my\nmortality\nyes right but like how does that\ntranslate into like what what are the\nsteps that improved your anxiety\nI mean from that from that being social\nwas a huge thing so like I was involved\nwith a college Society but I was very\nshy and reserved even in that Society\nimmediately after the lung collapse I\nthrew myself into it\num I made a shitload of new friends\num just like it was almost immediately\nand like you know they were all scared\nshitless for my well-being at the time\nand I remember so I was kind of playing\nit off still because I could be like\nstill trying to come into college like a\nfew weeks after like yeah I'm fine just\nlike walking incredibly slowly down the\nhallway because I can't go faster than\nthat\num but it just it really changed it it\njust I don't know it was something about\nthe whole life is short and something\nbad could have happened here thinking\nabout my own mortality that was a very\ngood and healthy thing for me because\nbecause I could always tell that I was\nkind of just unhappy up until that point\nI knew like uh you know so kind of just\nbeing quiet all the time I don't really\nknow what I'm doing after that moment it\nwas like [ __ ] it I'm tossing myself into\nit I'm gonna give it an honest shot and\nmy confidence just like soared through\nthe roof\num like it helped a lot uh and again\nit's a weird thing because normally if\nyou're thinking about mortality and that\nthe old existential dreads on the brain\nand it's normally a patch thing\num but I know for myself that it's\nalmost kind of like a more positive\nthing because it kind of helps motivate\nme weirdly\num\nwell because life is short\num it's how I try and like think about\nit so you know if if you're gonna like\nyou want to try and make the most of it\nuh you want to try and make the most of\nyour time uh and you know and so for me\nfor a lot of the times I'll be kind of\ncrippled with anxiety so indecision\nWould Rain quite heavily on me so I\nwouldn't be able to decide to do\nsomething because oh but what this but\nwhat that but what of all these possible\nconsequences kind of playing out\nscenarios my brain\nbut with the almost mortality like kind\nof placed in front of you it's like [ __ ]\nit you don't have time to think about\nall these you might as well just give it\na shot and so I just start giving things\na shot more and it helped uh and so\ninstead of kind of like being trapped in\nlike anxious lupins in my mind I would\njust be like [ __ ] it we're doing this\nand just giving things an honest go and\nit just did wonders for me\num since then like like\nuh yeah it's it's weird just even in\nretrospect now it would have been like\neight years ago but because I don't even\nremember like most of like my life in\nthe university and [ __ ] like that before\nthen\num it just feels alien and different uh\nbut I remember everything past that my\nthird year on was just wonderful and\nfantastic\nhmm\nfast\ncan I just think for a second yeah work\naway\ndo you still have existential dread\nabsolutely oh God all the time tell us\nabout that\nI mean just thinking about life and\nthinking about Direction and where it's\nall going am I making the most of like\ntime in that but like it's it's a bit\ndifferent now it's not so much\nexistential Terror where it's like oh my\nGod we're all gonna die it's more so\nyou know yeah we're gonna die but we can\ndo something in that time we've got a\nlong while here\nand there's a lot of good stuff worth\ndoing in that time too it's kind of how\nI look at it like I know I know from\nsome of my chat um that I just crossing\nover I can see the emote we have like an\nexistential dread of moat in my twitch\nchat the little sweat in Shamrock with a\nsmile that's what that's from\num you know like I know even on stream\nI'll kind of like even joke about that\nand like I'll joke about how old I'm\ngetting and stuff like that\num but I I'm fine with that as well I'll\nstill get like kind of a little bouts of\nit where it's kind of bad for the most\npart it's it's\ngood and it's almost reassuring is how I\nwould look at it what happens you about\ndeath\nsuch a mortgage way to ask oh God\num\nI mean\nit's like an end in sight at some point\nI I want to make sure I phrase this\nright as well phrase it wrong because\nbecause I don't want this to be anxiety\ninducing but I mean it's a drawing kind\nof getting older and kind of living life\non that you know and you learn to kind\nof look back at things and you learn to\nappreciate things in that moment a lot\nmore\num because rather than kind of stressing\nabout it's like oh God I didn't do this\nI didn't do that you kind of feel with a\nsense of I did this today and I had a\ngood time with it and it's like you know\nI enjoyed the time I spent today and\nit's like and also with that existential\ndread there's a sense of like right what\nam I gonna do tomorrow so I can make the\nmost of this\nyou know and there's always something\nkind of comforting and kind of\norganizing yourself along that way\num and kind of the feedback loop is\nalmost like you make some plans you\nfulfill those plans and then it feeds\nback in your brains like that was a good\nday\nyou know whereas before it was just like\nnothing is organized everything is chaos\noh God what do I do it's kind of how it\nfelt and then anxiety what made it hard\nfor you to pick something to do before\nindecision anxiety\num like so what what made it hard for\nyou to make that decision\nit's almost like having I mean\nit's like having several different\noptions on like a restaurant menu and\njust having to pick one and knowing that\nyou're going to miss out on all the\nother ones and you spend so long trying\nto actually decide and pick a damn meal\nthat you end up forgetting to order\nis how I would maybe describe it I I\nhope that kind of makes sense I'm trying\nto find the right way to kind of phrase\nit and like kind of voice it It's Tricky\num\nbut I I it\nit definitely has helped um yeah oh yeah\nso Daniel I I love this dude so okay\ndon't don't\nI want to try to reassure you if that's\nokay\noh yeah no you're oh God so I think what\nyou're giving us is pure gold and I\nthink it is going to\nthis is maybe a little bit highfalutin\nbut that's gonna revolutionize people's\nperspectives on anxiety\nso here's the problem right so we think\nthat like conquering anxiety is through\nlike good stuff\nbut but I I think that what what so\nthere's something really transformative\nso like there are a couple things so\nthis is where\nI kind of don't want to blow my load too\nearly but this is kind of where I am so\nokay let's go so\num\nbecause here's the thing you say that\nthis is this is the way my brain is\nright this is how I am but\nthat's changed drastically you get that\nI mean I I do like in comparison like\nbefore and after the whole collapsed\nlung scenario like yes I know I know\nthat's adjusted a lot yeah right so so\nlike the first thing is that you assume\nso this is man this is so great Daniel\nthere's so many things that you do that\nare both good\nand paradoxically like I think kind of\nhold you back in some ways because we\nsort of more than likely we think about\nyou know the progression of anxiety to\nbe like this kind of upward thing but if\nwe really like listen to your story and\nwe think about what has helped you right\nwe don't medically recommend go get a\nspontaneous pneumothorax if you've got\nan anxiety disorder right just go go\nhave your lung deflate go on but what I\nthink we can really learn if we pay\nattention is if we understand it's not\nthe experience itself it's how the\nexperience interfaced with you yeah and\nwhat we can sort of elucidate is like\nhow did it affect you and then if we\nunderstand what those pieces are we can\nhelp other people do that without having\na spontaneous pneumothorax does that\nmake sense which is which is preferable\nwhich is absolutely preferable\num and then I think there's just so much\ngood stuff here because this there's\nalso this sort of this idea that you've\naccepted\nthat your this is the way that you are\nand that helps you get through a\ntemporary crisis right by reassuring\nyourself but\nparadoxically I think you could be\nalmost shooting yourself in the foot\nbecause we actually have good data that\nshows that you were a certain way and\nthat that can drastically change\nso\ncan you actually drastically change\nagain and what would that look like well\nit's not even drastic change though I\nmean living is just constant state of\nchange more than anything you know we're\nalways kind of growing and developing\nbut yeah I see what you mean like kind\nof paying attention more to that is\ndefinitely uh definitely will do me good\nrather than just kind of accepting the\nstatus codes like this is just how it is\nyeah so I'll just let it happen and\nwrite it out so it's like trying to\nchange like the the process of and the\nresult outcome yeah um so so I'd say\nfirst of all living life has changed\nlike you weren't living life before you\nwere existing yeah more or less right\nyeah you were over here life was living\npeople were living life over here\nand you were over here and then you\nstepped in the flow\nof life and then everything's bumpy\nright yes something about being able to\njump into the river\nsort of like made the anxiety go away\nand or you had to have the anxiety go\naway before you jumped in the river\nwhich is what's tricky right\nno for sure\nand then there was one other thing oh\nyeah so I recently saw a study that I\nthought was really fascinating\nthat people who develop very strong\nemotional coping mechanisms tend to not\nprogress in life\nokay it's kind of weird right because\nyou think like ingrained and ingrained\nin the habit almost is it\nwell so I think what happens is if I'm\nin a bad situation let's say I'm in an\nabusive relationship and I get really\nreally good at coping\nyeah\nam I more likely to stay in the\nrelationship or less likely to stay in\nthe relationship\nyeah I mean that that's actually a fair\npoint in here because if you're just\ntrying to cope all the time then you're\njust going to fall in almost that habit\nLoop and it's like where is staring in\nthe face is like hey maybe you should\nget out of this you know maybe maybe\nit's better like yeah absolutely it's\nreally bizarre like I I was stunned when\nI saw the study but like there's there's\nreally they were talking about how\nthe better you are at coping the more\nstuck the more likely you are to stay\nstuck yeah and I've seen this with\npatients of mine where like you know\nthey'll come in and and you know after a\ncouple of years we're like they're like\nhey I need more coping skills and I'm\nI'm like you know I don't know if I\ndon't know if that's the right choice\nlike I don't think you need more coping\nskills I think you know your life needs\nto be different like I don't I don't\nthink my I mean I if that's what you\nwant that's what I'll help you with but\nI don't think my job here is to allow\nyou to level up your coping to the point\nthat you can handle any situation I\nthink it's to help you no longer need to\ncope right yeah yeah with some of those\nsituations or the mental traffics that\nare leading into those uh situations\nmore so yeah\num no like it's just maybe something to\nbring in here um I'm not sure if it's\nsomething you'd be familiar with but\nlike um\na book I've actually been reading\nrecently uh Dr Judson Brewer I think uh\nunwind and anxiety\num has been fantastic because he's kind\nof presenting a lot of that argument\nwhere it's like he's trying to undo the\nhabit and he's like kind of like um I'm\nnot gonna be able to do it justice here\nbut it's just like it's an example like\nit's what you said there and so trying\nto almost pay awareness to it and kind\nof of that situation rather than just\ntrying to manage it best you can almost\nengineer it so that mentally you're in a\nlot better prepared and in better\nsituations for yourself yeah Johnson was\nfantastic yeah yeah\num I haven't read the book myself but\nI'm sure it's great I've very oh it's\nbeen fantastic\num\nso is it okay if I ask a couple more I'm\ngoing to get a couple some more do you\nhave any questions for me\nno fire away okay I'm happy to chat let\nme um you doing okay\nI'm good yeah you feeling like nervous\nor whatever\na little bit but it's kind of it's kind\nof like it's settling now that's the\nthing because that thing is I'm always a\nbit anxious and on age whenever I sit\ndown to do anything like this\nbut once I get into it I'm fine okay\nI'll just write it out a bit\nman that whole thing with the\nspontaneous pneumothorax is fascinating\ndude like it's like that's I know right\nyeah\num\nI still can't sleep in my left side to\nthis day\num just from it\num I definitely need to get some\nphysiotherapy at some point because I\nkind of just started putting up with\nthat after a certain point\nI can't do it because I feel like I'm\nsuffocating which is weird never been\nable to\neight years on\nthat's what's that like\nit's not great sometimes I roll over in\nthe night and I feel like I'm choking\nthat's hilarious yeah I I definitely I\nI've some physio ahead of me I'm very\nmuch aware\num but I've also knowed that like\nwhenever I sleep I've gotten very used\nto just sleep in a particular way which\nagain is kind of like almost like it\nit's just what you're saying like\nmentally almost cope and that's like a\nphysical example of it there's me coping\nphysically so I don't just you know\nsuffocate in my sleep\njust get it checked out you know be\neasier\nhow does that do you Ryan if I ask a\npersonal question go for it\num how does that affect like\nrelationships\nwell not being able to sleep on my left\nside does that make\nsleeping with people weird\nI mean do you just positions on the bed\nlike you make sure you can face them or\nyou're facing the edge of the bed if\nthat's what you're going for well I'm\njust I'm curious right because it seems\nlike it's kind of uh it's like it's like\na pretty big it's like you're playing\nthat game with a handicap you know what\nI'm saying it's like you can't\nlaughs\noh god oh Chad's reaction to this is\n[ __ ] great yeah so you mind if I ask\nyou a personal question\nno I mean I'm just curious because like\nyou know these are the kinds of things\nyeah yeah I mean so this is what you\nlearn like so be being a doctor like\nwhat I learned is that the impact so\nwhen we think about something like a\nspontaneous pneumothorax we can\nre-inflate your lung but I've noticed\nthat one of the biggest problems in\nmedicine is we don't really understand\nhow conditions I'm 100 serious how\nconditions like impact people's like\nlike other parts of their life like it\nis never crossed my mind that someone of\nthe spontaneous pneumothorax could\nactually have problems like in their\nromantic relationships because you know\nthe and like that's that's like a huge\npart right like being able to like move\naround while you sleep and forget about\nromantic just just being able to like\nsleep comfortably is like huge yeah no\nfor sure\num and I have to be very particular with\nthat like I know even like on a physical\nhealth and that for exercising\num it's always an issue lifting weights\nuh what I do more than anything is\nmainly just lift weights because I'm\nalways just trying to like make sure I\nhave some upper body strength more than\nanything uh so it's just in particular I\ncan't live [ __ ] with this arm\nit's like above my head now it it it is\nthat because of this\nI mean I think I think it's because I I\nthink it's like a mix of things because\nlike it's weird because if I exercise\ntoo much I always feel pressure in my\nlung huh is how I would describe it and\nagain I always wonder about that and I I\ndefinitely have no I have some physio\nahead of me like my doctor has\nrecommended that too I just need to go\nand actually organize it at some point\nI've kind of just got a bit too\ncomfortable just kind of putting up and\naccepting that again as well but it's\nlike maybe maybe I should just check\nthat out and not be in pain like\nyeah yeah\nwell I'm sorry was that did I overstep\nwith that personal question like no\nyou're grand no your grandson or it was\njust it was just quite funny you know\nwhat phrase it in that you know your\ngrand I wasn't asking questions about\nyour penis you know\nlike you don't have to be specific\nno but I'm saying like I thought that\nwas\nso my next dream after this is gonna be\nlike my chat's gonna be it's like hey I\nsaw you on Dr Dr K I saw he was asking\nabout your dick\nno\nyou know I'm just talking about sleeping\npositions you know what I'm saying like\nyeah yeah of course of course\nyeah anyway so\nit's Grand it's Grand\nanxiety and the existential debt of yeah\naggressive sorry fear of death yes let's\ngo okay\num\nyou have questions for me Daniel\nanything about this kind of like\nresonate with you or that you're kind of\ncurious about like what do you want to\ntalk about\num I mean I'm happy to kind of unpick\nsort of like what you think of like the\nwhole Irish Cultural thing on like kind\nof even mental health and that through\nthe years and how it's again we have a\nphilosophy that's kind of helpful but\nthen also kind of not because I think\nlaughing at life is quite a valuable\nthing to do they're almost like a good\nway of processing emotions you know but\nobviously\num I mean the way Ireland has kind of\ndone it and it says weird even saying\nthat because it's not like yes Mr\nIreland taught us this but no it's like\na societal way of handling it\num so it it's kind of difficult with\nmental health in some capacities like\nmen's mental health is in the [ __ ] in\nthis country like it just is\num you know and that's just a cultural\nthing uh it's getting better but it's\nit's it's it's been very bad\ncan you tell me more about men's mental\nhealth in Ireland\nI mean people just don't talk about it\nuh like it's hired even with like kind\nof like close genuine friends to open up\nabout that kind of thing or even be\nvulnerable because I mean it's like\nthere's very much a sense like oh no I'm\ncrying I'm grind don't don't need to\ntalk about that no don't worry about it\nit's like we almost all like repress it\nand I I know I know that even like\nspeaking to some of my close friends in\nthat window clearly going through [ __ ]\nit's hard to kind of just get through\nthem and be like like you know have them\nbe vulnerable or kind of be there for\nthem because we all just isolate\nourselves\nso I'm gonna ask you some\nstupid questions\ndidn't say personal that time I didn't\num so\nbut why do you need to talk about it why\ndo you correlate not talking about it or\nbeing vulnerable with things or bad\nbecause it's healthy ain't just to kind\nof talk about it you know\num or like especially when like shit's\nhitting the fan it's nice to be able to\nhave someone lean on them and be like\nlisten I'm actually not doing that well\nin the head\nyou know and I I know I'm thankful for\nmy friends and that you know because I\ndo like I I do feel like I can do that\nwith them but I know that sometimes I\neven feel in myself I'm like no I don't\nwant to bother them don't want to bother\nthem and the closest form of kind of\nalmost talking about it I will get is\nkind of like a a friend group or culture\nwould be like joking about this or\nslagging about it\nyeah I was like Jesus wasn't that\nterrible like like\nit's like here's one that I know right\nand it's like like it kind of says it\num my dad and his grandmother uh when\nhis mother passed away my grandmother\npassed away I I mean he kind of\nprocessed it in that almost jokey way\nand I remember we were just out of the\nfuneral and then like I asked like Dad\nhow are you feeling and it's like and\nhis response was Jesus she's not looking\nwell in there\n[Laughter]\nyou know I just\nhonestly all right\num you know but but that kind of says it\nthough doesn't it it's like yeah you\ncan't like even then that's quite a\nserious one it's like maybe we should\nchat you know\nbut like it says it was your dad so this\nis what I'm kind of I'm gonna kind of\npush you on this for a second\nso how what are the signs that things\naren't going well\noh now what uh like just so so like so\nso I'm with you right so that's drastic\nseems Seems crazy\nyou know like\nyour mom just passed away and you're\nlike wow she's not looking great you\nknow I I can't it's like bloody hell\nlike you know because I because I\nunderstand you know laugh at a life of\ncope with it was like Jesus you know\nyeah so but but how do you know that\nmen's mental health isn't good how do\nyou know that that's not sufficient\nwell because because I mean I see I just\nsee like friends and family just\nstruggling more than anything and a lot\nof the time it's just because they don't\ntalk about it what do you see\nwith just like stress kind of isolated\nnot getting a whole like I I I not\ncommunicating or like not reaching out\nyou know it's like like it'll be times\nwhere like a friend is just clearly in a\nlot of trouble and just oh he's not\ngoing too well and you can kind of see\nit\num but you can't really be there for\nlike emotionally unavailable and it's\njust like ah yeah I'm just gonna toughen\nup and I'll be grand and it's like you\nknow maybe you don't always need to\ntoughen up you know maybe it's good to\njust cap at it sometimes you know\nbecause I mean I know from experience\nthe times I chat about that stuff my\nfriends it's [ __ ] miles better than\njust not saying anything you know so\nit's from experience there that I would\nknow like yes it really helps to just\nchat about [ __ ] you know and even things\nlike I know some friends like God love\nthem where they'll be like oh no I don't\nwant to go to a therapist\nand I've never been the one in their\nlife and it's like\nwhat are you doing you know like that\nyou you'd go to the doctor if your leg\nwas hurt you know like\nthat kind of scenario I know it's a bit\nof irony there me with my old lung and\nI'm still having [ __ ] treason but\nbut you said when did you first go see a\ntherapist\nuh it would have been 2017 or 2018. I\ncan't remember when exactly okay\nI just need to think about if it was\nbefore or after 2015.\nyeah it was after it was after because\nbeing much more aware of that and kind\nof just live and it was just like huh\nmaybe I should like kind of try and\nunpack some of this baggage that\nsometimes eats away at me you know I was\nlike yeah I'm gonna go talk to someone\nwho's professionally trade to handle my\n[ __ ] you know yeah like listen\nSo Daniel can you tell me about\ntoughening up you've mentioned that you\nknow people will say man up toughen up\nwhat yeah well tell me about that\nI mean it's just the expectation that\nlike be fine and dandy otherwise you're\nbothering people I I I I don't know like\nit's the sense that like\nit's a sense that you I just you kind of\nget here what you did before now I've\ngrown up a bit since then\num\nbut it's just like if you have an issue\nyou just gotta deal with it you know and\nyou're not allowed to be emotional about\nor anything like that you just have to\nget stronger overcome problem\nand be normal again which is not healthy\nat all it's really toxic uh where does\nthat pressure come from like what what\ndo like\nI mean I know it yeah because it's not\nanyone in particular like that's the\nthing\num like it it is a cultural thing like\nsomeone's even saying in chat I sure\nit'll be ground it's Grand which is like\none of our most beloved phrases in\nIreland that that'll be grand oh that's\nterrible but Abby Grand and that's how\nwe just kind of process it right it's\nactually kind of unpack it and trying to\nactually more appropriately deal with\nlike a situation that's unfolded like\nAbby Grant don't worry about it and and\nwhat what makes it what is the negative\nconsequence like so what do people when\npeople are sort of like\ntelling themselves or each other that I\nshould toughen up I should man up\nwhat is the consequence if they don't do\nthat what are people trying to avoid by\ntoughening up\nI mean I think I think for a lot of us\nis just afraid of feeling weak or\ninsecure you know it's like God I was\nemotional about that and I didn't\nprocess it well that's embarrassing you\nknow I think it's some of that sense so\nI think that's like the fear was like if\nI don't Tough Enough I'm going to be\nemotional about this\num you know I'm I'm have to deal with it\nthen and like God I just can't handle\nthat\num you know whereas like sometimes if\nyou just kind of if you're a bit more\naware and you have a good old cry then\nyou can always get it some of it out\nyour system almost you know or like you\ncould all just chat with a friend so\nexpressing emotion\nthat is not positive means you're yes\nyes\num that's how I would kind of describe\nit where it's a bit of a shame again\nwe've come a long way with it um since\nin Ireland I would like to think uh I\nknow in more recent years than that like\neven the idea of having those\nconversations with friends and family is\nlike they're much more open to it you\nknow which is great you know like\nactually confide in them about stuff\nthere too now\num but it was it was very rough uh I\nknow in my Opera uh like just in like\nschool days and stuff like that can you\ntell me a little bit more about that\nI mean sure I mean I I mean I know just\nfor a lot of the time I mean a lot of it\nfor manifesting school like people who\ngot to be like bullied or just troubling\nuh like having difficulties with\njust education system in general and\njust have literally no support for it\nand they'd just be like well you're on\nyour own and if you don't get the grades\nyou're [ __ ] and you know parents\ndisappointed in you all that jazz\nbasically\num and like not actually providing that\nkind of like more healthy support where\nit's like hey you know let's just help\nyou process this a bit better like\nwhat's wrong you know no one ever really\nasks in that question it's just more of\na concern it's like ah you'll be grand\njust figure it out and you'll be grand\nyou know\na lot of Grants yeah\nand which is not great what's the\ndownside of being emotional\nlike why do people think that that is\nbad do you have a sense of that again I\nmean I think some of it is just\nit's coming out like just being\na bit insecure what your feelings or\nlike not having yourself put together\nI mean we still have those you know we\nhave those things in our world with like\nthe well put together individual you\nknow and it's like and you're almost not\nallowed to have that kind of weakness\nagain miles better in recent years we've\nmade a lot of progress there it's okay\nit's more and more okay being more\nnormalized\num but definitely like 10 years ago like\nno that was not the case\nso I know I mean public about that was\nvery hard I'm gonna tie together a\ncouple things that I heard Daniel and\nlet me know if you think this is good or\nnot good so I'm kind of noticing that if\nyou don't handle your own stuff and you\nshow it to other people\nit becomes their responsibility\nand then you're kind of burdening them I\nmean that's the feeling of it yeah\nand and so so I I also notice you\nmentioned like you know you don't want\nto be a burden to anyone yeah yeah I I\nthink that is just a cultural thing here\nunfortunately like no one wants to\nbother anyone and is that is that\nparticularly true of men\nah I mean\nyeah I mean it has to be I mean I think\nit's it's just true for everyone but I\nmean men always struggle with that in\ngeneral you know I don't think that's a\nmystery why do you think that is\nMaine\nit's just kind of like\nculture upbringing sure so which is\nMedia you know when you think of a man\nwhat do you see\nso uh you know you know the Chad meme\nwhere it's the guy with like the\nchiseled beard and then the rock hard\nabs and it's like just staring intently\noff in the distance like that's it\nthat's what we're all striving for\nyeah so I I noticed one thing that's\ninteresting about the Chad mean is the\nChad meme is always alone\nyes he is that's very appropriate\nit's kind of interesting because like\nyeah there's like the beard and the\nmusculature in in the smile\nor this is no one there and then there's\nthere's no there's no one around them\nand so I'm I also wonder a little bit\nabout\nso Irish culture I I kind of Wonder and\nnow I'm you know I'm sure there's\nthousands of people out there who have\nphds and understand this stuff way\nbetter than we do but what I'm kind of\nhearing from you is that Ireland has a\nculture of resilience\nof coping of survival\nyeah uh and you know and it makes sense\nwhen you look at almost a historical\ncontext for the Irish you know they've\nbeen through a lot of [ __ ] through the\nyears you know so it's like learn to\nlaugh at life is almost part of that\ncoping mechanism you know yeah because\nwe don't laugh at it we're just gonna\ncry and you know and you know Jesus you\nknow it's already got enough on our\nplate\nand and so I'm kind of noticing that I\ncould imagine that when your culture\nhas is subordinate to some like a\ndifferent culture right so that that's\nwhat's happened a lot in Ireland\nyeah um and you know happened in India\nand stuff too that that sort of\nsurviving and pulling your own weight\nbecomes important because you don't want\nto burden other people because it's not\nyes everyone has to get through it and\neveryone has to care like we all have to\ncarry our weight right yeah basically\nand if you don't I don't want to give\nyou more to carry when you've already\ngot all your own [ __ ] going on and\nthere's almost like the things cannot\nget better they just have to be\ntolerated right that's why we laugh at\nlife it's like there's no there's no way\nto improve things\nwe just have to take it as best as\npossible\nyeah\nand it's just a coping mechanism for\nthat when it's like but maybe some I\nmean maybe we don't always just have to\ntake it maybe it's a bit healthier for\nthe old brain to actually untangle a\nlittle bit you know confide in someone\nand actually discuss that\num you know it's like like\nit's just better for everyone like we\ndon't have to have this mentality like\nwell everyone's suffering so I can't\nburden them with my suffering it's like\neveryone's suffering to degree in life\nyeah so like but we don't have to suffer\nalone I think that's way healthier than\njust kind of isolating yourself from the\nworld you know yeah they're all in it\ntogether really fascinating that you\nstumbled into that so there's um there's\na really there are a couple of really\ninteresting studies that if you have\nsomeone who has a mood disorder someone\nwho's depressed one of the best things\nthat you can do to improve your mental\nhealth if you were depressed is to\nactually help someone else\nso somewhere\nseriously like somewhere along the way\nwe we started to think that people who\nwere suffering the way to help them is\nfor someone from the outside to\nalleviate their suffering\nbut if you look at it statistically or\nscientifically that person helping\nsomeone else has a very positive impact\non their own mood and so we don't really\nthink about helping other people as a\nway to improve your own mental health\nit's not because you're right because\nthere's like there's the helper and\nthere's the helpy there's like yeah\nthose are two things and if you fall\ninto one bucket we don't think about\nthat as being one bucket but it kind of\nis it's interesting\nno it's fascinating yeah because instead\nit's much more of almost like an\nisolationist Behavior where it's like\nwell I'm depressed time to Bunker away\nfrom the world you know until I can\nfigure out my [ __ ] right because you\ndon't want to burn on someone well\nthat's the thing yeah yeah yeah that\nsounds that sounds rough how did you\ndecide to go to therapy\n[Music]\nI mean it would have been\ntrying to think like when about it was\nbecause I was in it\nI was tail end of 2017.\nI think\num\nI'm trying to remember what exactly it\nwas sorry\num it's okay\nI can we also talk about something else\nif nothing's clicking no no it's good\nlike um\nlike I don't know because like it's I I\nwas a lot more kind of confident I guess\nself-aware at that point and I could\ntell there's some things really\nbothering me here and there's just some\nstuff that unpack and it's just like you\nknow it was kind of like a [ __ ] it I've\nnever tried this\nit could be a good shot you know\num and it was kind of just that was what\nkind of led me into it and you know and\nI had like a godsend of a therapist in\nDublin for a while there\num\nlike an online therapy past that as well\nwhat made the therapist to godsend\noh it's just I just felt sane you know\nbecause it's like because like you know\nyou're talking to someone in that\nprofessional environment you can talk to\nalmost like a sounding board and that\nlike kind of voice your mind and kind of\nget some insights into yourself and they\nhelp you know tease that out of you as\nyou go along and like you just help\nunderstand your own brain better so\ninstead of like torturing yourself or\nyour brain it's like you kind of have a\nbetter idea of how it's working and why\nyou're thinking the way you do\nand that help that just makes you better\nequipped to just\nI mean understand yourself better but be\njust being a better mental state\nultimately you know yeah yeah I think\nit's it's beautiful what you said that\nthey you feel sane so that's the thing\nyeah you do oh I'm not losing my mind\nthank God like yeah so the big irony is\nis people\nwhen you start losing your mind\nyou were afraid that if you go to a\ntherapist you will confirm that you have\nlost your mind because who goes to\ntherapists people who are crazy yeah\nwhich is just\nunfortunate so that's the stigma like\nyou know you're losing your mind\nyou don't want to be losing your mind\ncrazy people go to therapy and the big\nirony is that when you go to therapy\nwhat you discover is that you're\nactually sane\nyeah that you've been saying all along\nyeah it's bad but you wouldn't know that\nuntil you go there and you're resistant\nto go there because you don't want to\nadmit it and oh sorry it's really\nbizarre but I I've never heard it\nphrased that way but it's beautiful that\nthat therapy is actually where you\ndiscover how sane you are not when you\ndiscover how crazy you are and the big\nirony the really sad thing is that\npeople feel crazy but they're actually\nway more sane and and that's what\nyeah like you know you just you know\nit's like mentally like the stuff going\non there you need to unpack it's like\ngoing to your doctor ultimately you know\nyou just need to go to the doctor to try\nand work something out you know\nyeah I I like that analogy too because I\nthink what we're sort of seeing is in\ntoday's world like the level of mental\nstress outweighs the level of physical\nstress that most human beings experience\nI mean I mean absolutely I mean we\nwanted to use them to do uh existential\ndread again as well uh there's a lot of\nso it's been pretty hot this last week I\ndon't know if you've been feeling it\noh yeah so tell me about that yeah well\nI mean no I mean just I mean like you\nknow I think like the climate that we're\nin and just like you know there's a lot\nof almost existential Terror there like\nyou just look at the state of the world\nand like oh God everything's on fire and\nscreaming\num you know and it's like I'm just\ntrying to like kind of get by my own\nlife on top of that as well and then all\nthis and it's like it's overwhelming the\namount that's going on you know how do\nyou manage that\nbest you can\nI honestly I mean like you have to know\nwhen to untangle yourself I guess from a\nlarger World sometimes and take the\ndowntime for yourself\nI think we're only Built to kind of\nmentally process so much\num you know like disconnect from the old\nphone social media I find that helps a\nlot\nI think we need that more than ever\nbecause I I ironic that we're saying\nit's not an interactive twitch live\nstream where everyone's tuned in you\nknow but but it helps it like it just\nknow when to kind of just tune out and\njust get away from it uh and just like\nI'm gonna do something kind of common\nfor myself yeah no it's it's funny that\nyou mentioned that we're doing this on\nTwitch because yeah so so I was at the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association\nconference and someone asked me so it\nsounds like what you do is almost like\nhold an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in\na bar\nand then I said well actually yeah\nand people may think that that's a\nterrible idea but if you really think\nabout where should you hold a meeting so\nbar is the best place to hold an AAA\nmeeting\nand and I know it sounds really bizarre\nbut I think that the internet has\nscrewed up our mental health and also is\nexactly where we need to be discussing\nmental health and we can use this tool\nfor good too\nright I mean that's I mean absolutely\nyou know I mean you know speaking of\nsomeone with social anxiety just in\nfront of everyone right now you know\nlike it definitely helps\num to kind of almost be public with\nstuff like this\num because I know like like we're\ntalking about like no one wants to talk\nabout any of these issues we're all just\nstuck in our own heads here is us\ntalking about it you know like uh like\nif that can help push someone to like\ntherapy or just like you know like a\nbetter mental state like that is very\nvaluable you know having that kind of\npublic forum\nyeah I think very well said Daniel I\nthink one of the really interesting\nthings is that\nas especially mental health became one\nof the most private parts of medicine so\nif you kind of think about like you know\ncancer\nlike we the whole world was wearing\nthese yellow armbands at some point to\nsignal to the rest of the world that\nthey had cancer it was something that we\nadvertised there was a whole like\nindustry there still is of like\ncosmetics in merch around cancer and\nsignaling to the rest of the world that\nwe have cancer\nand then on the opposite end of that we\nhave mental health where if you go to a\ntherapist the last thing that you ever\nwant to do is tell anyone that you've\nbeen to a therapist even if you're\nbetter and it helped you it has to be\nkept secret\nand so it's really interesting because\nthe the private nature of therapy I\nthink has propagated the stigma\nyeah like\nit's an odd one yeah because it's like\nbecause you wouldn't you wouldn't just\nhide from your family I've been to the\ndoctor like you know that again checking\nmy leg or something you know like it\ndoesn't really make sense I I viewing it\nas a kind of like a private thing is an\ninteresting way of putting it yeah\num because I've been I mean\nunfortunately with the state of therapy\nfor a lot of places it's still kind of\nexclusive so like there are barriers to\nentry like cost would be I know quite a\nsignificant one\num you know and like even getting our\ninsurance plans and that is like very\nrare to say the least yeah\num\nwhich is unfortunate yeah because it\ndoes just make it a bit tougher and then\nit\nit makes it harder to kind of just get\nmental health issues out in the open\nbecause it is such a private thing and\nand I I think it's you know it's private\nfor a good reason well yeah I mean\nsometimes in conversations that are not\nlive streamed on the internet you know\nwe discuss things that are\nunderstandably very private and that's\ngood yes no of course it's just uh you\nknow I think it's an interesting\ndouble-edged sword\nit is no I I I absolutely\num\n[ __ ] up people are talking about\ndepression merchandise and chat at the\nmoment I mean there are t-shirts I see\nthese days where it's just like how are\nyou feeling today it's just a cartoon\ncharacter it's caption ah I think yeah\nyeah me too yeah I think we get it in\nsome capacity\nthat's it's interesting I wonder if we\nshould have armbands merch\num what color what color if we had a I'm\ndepressed if we had a I'm in treatment\nor I've been in therapy before armband\nyou know like cancer survivors\nhuh it's got to be blue I'm feeling blue\nand blue it's got to be blue I like it\ngreen Shamrock icon with the sweat thank\nyou that was I could have him as well\nhe's just very anxious yeah\nanxious Shamrock t-shirt\nsummarizes it oh God\nyeah\num did you want to explore more about\nlike Irish culture like I I feel like we\nsort of uh I I I'm happy to talk about\nexistential dread I'm happy to talk\nabout Irish culture I can whip out the\nold iPad and we can try to Stitch things\ntogether and just kind of what I heard\nfrom you and maybe we can share\nsomething\nuh for everyone what do you think we\nshould be doing I mean I'm happy to dive\ninto the old dread that might be an\ninteresting one to talk about because I\nthink like you know there's so much to\nunpack with culture I think there\num but I mean it might might be a nice\none to go into because I know I know\nthat my experience with it as like it's\nprobably a bit different to most yeah so\ntell me about what what's your\nexperience with Dread\num well I mean I mean\nwell I mean touching on some of like the\nlung stuff I mean that would be some of\nit obviously\num it's like I was always like a feeling\nof anxiety before but now it's just it's\nalmost like a reassuring thing because\nI'm very much aware of the dread but\nalso I feel like I'm living life a lot\nmore so\nwhen I feel that way it's it's a lot\nmore reassuring versus just\nanxiety-inducing all the time\num I know I'm someone like almost\nbecause I find it hard to kind of switch\noff my brain sometimes\nfrom like well where's it I'll lead you\nknow what are you doing with life and\nstuff like that you know like I I still\nhave days even now where like I'll wake\nup in a cold sweat in the middle of the\nnight it's like I'm 28 and life is over\nand I've done nothing and it's like no\nyou're fine sometimes I get that feeling\nwith Dread you know which I think I mean\nthat I think that would be a more common\nkind of feeling with it\num only get that occasionally but for\nthe most part it's a weirdly almost\nreassuring thing because I can remind\nmyself like stop that you know and it's\nlike you've done more than you thought\nand things like that it's almost like a\nlike um curiosity is kind of like the\nlead scenes to God's help of it because\nit's like you just start picking it\napart and then you kind of realize where\nit's coming from it's not quite as\nanxiety-inducing as it initially was so\nit's like so why am I feeling this dread\nand how did this feeling come about and\nyou kind of like tease it out pick it\napart where is it coming from\nuh about here\nuh physically\num but I don't know like um I I know\nthat just from whenever whenever I was\num a kid\nI I had it very like drilled into me\nfrom a very early age just the concept\nof time and just mortality and that like\nlike I want to talk like\nI would have been like\nI think when I was like about 10 years\nold like like so quite early on and it's\nlike kind of thinking about stuff like\nthat\num and just being aware of our mortality\nI know something that I kind of Set It\nOff was again grandparents passing away\non my mom's side of the family I know\nother things that kind of Set It Off\nwe've been reading stuff like um would\nhave been reading stuff like Dubliners\nuh I would have been reading like The\nCatcher in the Raw at like quite an\nearly age and stuff like that very much\nin Paris that same feeling where it's\nlike what if everything's just not okay\nyou know and it's like what if time is\nlimited and it's like it's like heavy\nhired it in Concepts when you're just\nlike [ __ ] 10 and watching like\nYu-Gi-Oh on the side and [ __ ] yeah you\nknow like it's weird what they have us\nread like yeah no it's a lot like\nthere's a lot to unpack there you know\num\nbut ever since then it's kind of just\nclick to where it's like you know be\naware of the time you're spending and\nfor a lot of life like you know I was\nlike kind of more so\num restricted by that sense because I\nwas almost anxious the entire time where\nit's like oh God oh God oh God the time\nis passing the time is passing\num but again post long it's more so okay\nwe're gonna start doing stuff for that\ntime\nand so that's where it like it very much\nchanged and became way more reassuring\nrather than just anxiety inducing\nyeah um\nso again it's weird because again like I\nmean for a long part like just\nexistential dread and Terror it's like I\nI think it's something I'll just\neveryone kind of when you who doesn't go\nthrough it in this day and age you know\num for a lot of time it's just quite\nrestrictive but now it's like a weirdly\nkind of liberating thing because trying\nto be self-aware about it I know how to\nlike almost process it and deal with it\nuh is how it kind of feels how is\nexistential dread liberating for you\num\nI'm trying to find the right way to say\nit like\nit's\nharder to express\nbut\nthere's it's it's almost like a laugh\nthat it kind of a sense in life because\nlike I'm kind of aware of like my age\nand kind of mortality and stuff like\nthat and like kind of spending time it's\nlike it makes me appreciate the good\nthings happen in my life and also when\nthere is something bad kind of going on\nit kind of helps you put it in the\nlarger sum where maybe it's not as bad\nas it seems initially\nis maybe a good way to phrase it not\nstrictly The Dread that's doing that but\nit's the dread that's kind of leading to\nsome of that change and just more mental\nwell-being I would argue\nthis is great\nI'm uh\nso what would you when you said let's\nlet's talk about the existential dread\nwhat part of it what would you like me\nto\nyou want me to just kind of keep going\nor is there something in particular you\nwanted to share\nor you want to focus on\nI'm not entirely sure I mean I'm happy\nfor you to keep going a bit like it it\nit's hard to express unfortunately so\nlet me hear Let me let me share with you\nwhat I've heard so far sure so you still\nhave existential dread yes but your\nrelationship so what do you mean by\nexistential dread let's actually start\nthere what is existential dread\nuh\nuh life is short time is Fleet and we\nhave a limited time on this planet and\nwe should make the most of it okay\nthat's kind of like that yeah so I kind\nof almost like a personal just what are\nyou doing with your time kind of dread\nokay\nand and there are times where that dread\nfeels Dreadful\nyes and there are times where that dread\nfeels liberating\nyes there is like some sometimes it it\ncan be oddly helpful I don't know and\nand well let's talk about the Dreadful\ndread okay for a second and we will\nexplain to everyone else how to get to\nthe liberating dread okay we will catch\nall that it's great so you say I'm 28\nyou wake up in a cold sweat in the\nmiddle of the night because you slept on\nyour left side yes I have it I forgot to\ncheck out the lung again and then\nyou're 28 and you've done nothing\nthe nothing\nabout that\noh it's just like it's a cold sweat it's\nblind panic it's just like oh my like\nthe home alone like face from Kevin\nwhere it's like ah\num it's just it's it's just panic and I\ndon't know it just hits you sometimes\nyou know\nit's the kind of thing that comes in a\nwave and it's just like we almost need a\nbit like where does it come from\nI wish I knew like sometimes yeah\nbecause like sometimes it just hits you\nyou know it's like you don't really plan\non it but it's like something gets you\nthinking about life or the larger\npicture and it's like I think there's\nalmost like there's some self-doubt that\nprobably where it comes from it seems\nmost plausible I would say okay you know\nbecause uh because I would like to think\nthat I'm pretty confident in what I'm\ndoing and and life and that but then\nsometimes it'll just hit me if it's like\nbut what if you didn't make the most of\nit what if you didn't do your best uh\nsometimes I'll hit it'll hit me like say\nmaybe even after a stream or something\nlike that where it's just like that\ncould have been better and you know and\nI like you know and I feel like for the\ncrowd that's here it's like I've kind of\nlet them down\num I know some of that will be mixed up\nwith social anxiety as well uh we have a\nnice little cocktail going on here of\nlike several things\num but like sometimes it'll just be like\na dread there because it's like no I\nfeel like I didn't do my best at stream\nand I feel like that was a waste and\nthat could have been better and I feel\nlike it was just like you know I wasted\nthat evening\nuh\nmore often than not it's not as bad as I\nthought it was\num there's there's like a lot of streams\nwhere like I'll have them where I'll go\nthrough them it's like that could have\nbeen better and then uh my editor Chloe\nwill send me on the edited stream and\nit's [ __ ] hilarious and it's like\nwhere did this come from you know did\nyou like where did you find this\num and it it like sometimes I just\nself-doubt I I think is where it comes\nfrom yeah so so let's talk about that\nhow when was the first time that you got\nthat you can remember that like how long\nhave you been feeling existential dread\nthat you're not making the most of your\nlife that\nit I it would be about\n10 or 11.\nand so I mean you were 10 or 11.\nI can't remember anything in particular\nI\nokay well the\nI'm trying I'm trying to pick it apart\nmyself I've not looked at this myself in\na while\num\nI think it would be related to school\nmore than anything is where I would\nprobably pick it out\num because I because I always knew that\nlike for school on that and I kind of\nlike I was always good at school you\nknow I like buckle down do my homework\nstudy and that you know I got like good\ngrades and that you know like there's no\ntrouble with my parents there or\nanything\num but I think some of the earliest ones\nwould be like what if there's more to\nlife than just getting good grades you\nknow\nwhich I I like for child me like that\nwas kind of like a big thing it's like\nwhat do you mean there's more than just\ndoing well at maths\num but like that kind of manifested\nitself then more so in secondary school\num because I was still kind of\nstruggling that train but I remember\nthere was one thing I did that really\nhelped me kind of Veer away from it a\nbit again\num Fred secondary school or high school\num I was actually studying to be an\nengineer\nand all up until my final year I picked\nall of my subjects in relation to\nengineer and like designing\ncommunication Graphics uh applied maths\nI did everything in relation to that and\nthen I realized I actually don't want to\ndo this forever and I jump ship to\nEnglish uh because I just knew that like\nI really like reading books and I don't\nknow if there's anything from this but I\nknow I'm more passionate for this so I'm\nnot gonna do it my parents were like I\nremember like you know they were kind of\nlike shocked and confused by it because\nI'd spent like you know five years at\nthat point just preparing for this and\nmy final year it's like I'm jumping ship\nit would have been like about six months\nbefore I had my final exams\num out of existential dread\nnot out of dread it was kind of more so\nwell it was like passion mostly passion\nbecause I I could tell it's like my\nheart's not in this and I don't want to\nbe an engineer for the rest of my life\nyou know I I not don't think I'm going\nto enjoy doing this forever but part of\nthat was kind of came about from The\nDread of realizing oh God I might be\ndoing this my entire hold on a second so\nI think we got to go be before secondary\nschool because what you're describing to\nme is a manifestation of the dread in\nsecondary school does that make sense it\nwas already there yes no it's already\nthere yeah right so the dread was\ntelling you hey you're about to make a\nmistake bro\nthis is scary concept so here's the\nthing is there more to life\nis that a question that you had\nuh I mean back then yes so I'm gonna go\nout on a limb I think you had an answer\nI think I had an answer before\noh yeah when you were a 10 or 11 you had\nan answer\nbecause you were good at grades right\nI'm good at school yeah\nwhen you're 10 yes yes absolutely what\nelse is there\nthere's you know there's just travel\nthere's Ash there's people not when\nyou're 10.\nbesides grades\nthere's video games sure uh there's\nfriends\nyeah\num very local sense there's\nah\nthere's movies there's having fun yeah\nand you were doing all of those things\nright\nI mean I was doing them when I was when\nI was a kid too yeah what were you not\ndoing when you were 10 or 11\n. see it's weird because it still felt\nlike it wasn't really living which is\nquite dramatic for you know 10 year old\nme to kind of claim it's like I don't\nyes you know I guess I haven't\nexperienced this world oh always me it's\nlike dude go watch Scooby-Doo don't\ndevalue\nthe way that you felt you see what\nyou're doing there this is why you don't\nknow where it comes from because anytime\nyou get close to where it comes from\nwhat do you do you say it's sad to feel\nthat way\nso you're shutting off conversation with\nyourself when you do that yes no I I I\nagain I can see that yeah right like\njust kind of saying it's like I'm just\nbeing dramatic and silly in that yeah no\nbut 10 year old you\nwhat were they missing\nbecause life was passing you by what was\nwhat was passing you by\nmore of a sense of purpose\nthan grades\nyeah\nyeah\nsorry let me let me try to so I'm I'm\ncurious I'm struggling between asking\nyou an open-ended question and just kind\nof going with my hypothesis\nokay so like when you were 10\nyes I'm guessing that like on a week to\nweek basis there were some things that\nyou did that were fun you had a couple\nfriends you were good I had a couple\nfriends video video games but then there\nwas like stuff that was happening that\nyou were not doing\nwhat was happening when you were 10 do\nyou remember\nwere there any times in your life where\nyou felt like\nthere's something happening in life that\nI want to live and I can't\nso I actually I actually do think I know\nwhat part of it is and I haven't\nactually thought about this in a long\ntime\na lot of my friends were involved in\nclubs and stuff like that back in the\nday when I was 10 and they would do all\nthese extra things outside of school\nthat I simply was not involved in\nbecause I had my friends I had video\ngames but that was it for the most part\nlike books as well but I would always\nsee people going in clubs and going on\nthese like kind of wild adventures like\nGale tucks like the Irish language\nschools that we'd have and I wouldn't do\nany of that it would just be school\ngames school games school games friends\nyou know but there's a bit of the spice\nit up there\num but that was some of it that would\nhave been some of us like like you know\nGod like all these people around me it\nfeels like they're doing more\nand how did it feel to be doing less\npretty bad pretty bad uh pretty anxious\ninduced and it's like God I should be\ndoing more of my time it's kind of how\nit felt you know but I was still also\nstruggling to do that\num for quite some time you know like I I\nagain like in secondary school I would\nhave came out into my own a bit more it\nwouldn't have been until college that I\nreally got there I would say you know so\nit was a long time not only were you\nmissing out on life\nbut\nyou probably why were you not involved\nin clubs\nwhy weren't you doing what they were\ndoing\njust kind of scared that's it yeah I\nmean I think I think because I didn't\nreally think about social anxiety or\nending back then or even the concept of\nme having anxiety was\nunknown to me at that point\num and you know I mean being kind of\nclosed off in reserved like you know I\ncouldn't be open with anyone about that\nyou know like lust of all my parents\num\nyeah it just it just kind of felt like\nit sucked a bit uh it just felt like\nlife was passing me by and that's that's\nactually probably where it comes from\nGod I haven't thought about that in a\nlong time\noh my therapist is gonna have a field\nday after this Daniel we're just getting\nstarted bro oh God I'll I'll pass on the\nnotes to him so now the next question\nbecomes\nwhat's it like to inhabit someone\nin The Game of Life who can't play it\nhow does it feel to be an NPC yeah right\nlike there's all this like okay who's\nwho's responsible for not being a part\nof the club why aren't you part of the\nclub\nagain I was just socially anxious I was\nkind of scared yeah there was no reason\nand I I did actually try even at one\npoint and I remember trying I joined a\nSailing Club when I was about 10. and\nand uh like we live in like a coastal\ntown and I was out in a boat for a few\nweeks and I stopped because I just got\nreally anxious and scared being around\npeople at that time\nI just like completely dipped out of it\nagain and that kind of led into it too\nit's like oh God now I tried the club\nbut I couldn't do the club well enough\nand so that kind of fed into it too\nthinking about it yeah so if you're\nsomeone who life is there to be lived\nyeah but you're not capable of living it\nit's how it felt yeah you know when I\nwas a kid I know it's just it's pretty\ntough going and it's like\nyou know I I I think the like the media\nthat I had would have kind of helped me\nbe a bit more aware of it but also kind\nof\nit still felt powerless to do something\nabout it like again reading Dubliners\nreading Catcher in the Rye like Catcher\nin the Rye hugely is like that whole\nidea of paralysis and feeling like you\njust can't do what you need to do\num you know going through that hole and\ntouches on it so much of the time like\nwhat he needs and he identifies will be\ngood for him but he just can't do it you\nknow because he's you know uh he's just\nstruggling\nand what do you think happens to someone\nwho is living life and is paralyzed\nto be able to take advantage of it\nwho can't live it because\nit feels like it just pass you by yeah\nyou know and that that's anxiety\ninducing you know and what do you\nbecause it's just they think about their\nexistence\nwhat does existence hold for them\nanxiety you know like more than anything\nI would say yeah it's like you just look\nat it as like oh God like what am I\ndoing when everyone else is off in their\nown adventures and stories yep you know\nand you wouldn't you wouldn't be too\nkind to yourself\nuh more than anything because you'd be\ncomparing yourself to others a lot\nyou know yeah I I think that they would\ndread their existence yeah you know\nessential dread yeah yeah that's\nprobably where some of it comes from you\nknow like no I haven't thought about\nthat in a very long time\nit's mad\nso what do you how do you understand the\nspecificity of your memories from the\nage of 10. why does your mind remember\nthat you went to Sailing Club for like\nfour weeks and then dipped out I think\nsomewhere it's held on to that like I've\nnot thought about this in a number of\nyears you know yeah um and it's probably\njust because it's a bit of trauma\nassociated with it if I had to guess\nit's because I mean the trauma not So\nMuch from the club directly itself but\nthe experience in the club of me trying\nto connect and be there it's like yes\nI'm going to have my own story too\nbut then being an anxious wreck about it\nand it's just not working out and the\ndread of that not working out absolutely\nright here's the thing\nlet's go when you can't rely on yourself\nthen existence becomes dread\nbecause like all of these things could\nlike you know like 28 years old you wake\nup in a cold sweat life is passing you\nby why is life passing you by because\nyou're [ __ ] afraid that you can't\nactually live it because in the past you\ntried to live it and you weren't able to\nlive it so existence is not a joy it\nbecomes terrible terrifying\nlike how do I mean yeah I mean just to\nsay that at 28 much better equipped for\nprocessing all of that mental baggage\nand emotional baggage too of course you\nknow as I wake up in the cold sweat but\nI'll go back to sleep 100 so so this is\nthat's a really good point right so the\nother thing that we're going to notice\nis that there's fluctuation of this part\nof you and that when you were 28\nyou're fine\nyou have survived death Daniel yes I did\nit right we made it out of the Sailing\nClub\nthe problem is the problem is when you\nwake up in a cold sweat you're not 28.\nthe 28 year old you is the one who talks\nto yourself\nhow old are you when you wake up in a\ncold sweat and oh my God you're a kid\nagain yeah it's like it's like waking up\nit's like oh God there's an exam\ntomorrow it's like wait I've been out of\nschool for 10 years you know it's fine\nit's like\nso this is really important to\nunderstand\num okay do you have any uh actually I\nwant to think for a second and try to\ntie this together but any thoughts\nquestions anything else you want to say\nI've been interrupting you a little bit\nso no you're good\num\nyou're all good honestly it's just it's\nfascinating to just kind of unpack some\nof this and like\nyeah I I never really thought about\nthings in relation to when I was 10 in\nthat like I've not looked back on that\ntime in a long while\nfor things like Dread and that like the\nfurthest I ever go back would be\nI mean like just being aware and like\neven some of the books I was reading\nthat which like you know presented a lot\nof heavy Concepts and that you know\num it's just kind of fascinating because\nlike I even forgot about the Sailing\nClub and [ __ ] like that you know I\nhaven't thought about that how old are\nyou when you read Catcher in the Rye\nbut then 11 or 12. so here's the thing\nyou weren't presented those Concepts at\n11 or 12. they already existed within\nyou and that book resonated with you\nyeah I mean and that's what it is yeah\nand it kind of like helped me understand\nit a bit more which is my own awareness\nthere yeah and also in a terrifying way\nbecause you saw a story about a kid who\nwas you and you saw that kid get [ __ ]\nright left and Center because they could\nnot develop they couldn't control their\nown destiny and you're like oh [ __ ]\nbut at the age yeah you're not aware of\nthis right yeah yeah it's like oh God\nI'm holding\nright it's and so it's really\nfascinating because from a timeline\nperspective it [ __ ] it's like\ntextbook dude 10 to 11 development of\nexistential dread right okay in the Rye\nyeah two thousands of adolescents since\nin a mix there too you know yeah so then\nsome amount of reinforcement some amount\nof growth actually switching to English\nI think was a good move actually for you\nyou felt a lot I think you talk about it\nbecause you felt a lot of existential\ndread but that's actually you taking\ncontrol of your life because you're a\nlittle bit older right you're in\nsecondary school so you're not you're\nnot controlled by like the 10 year old\nterrified kid who is like watching life\npass them by and has tried to live it\nthat's the really damaging thing\nas you even when you were 10 or 11\nyou're like [ __ ] this I'm not going to\nbe that way and then you get four weeks\nof Sailing Club and then you wash out\noh Jesus\noh just picture a like 10 year old like\na little chubby me it's just like oh God\nare you chubby oh no I so like I weigh\nas much now as I did when I was 10. so\nthat like I just stretched out as time\nwent on yeah right so that's that's a\nconversation for your therapist but I\nwould dig into because even when it's\nit's fascinating right because when do\nyou mention your chubby\nnow is at this point in the conversation\nlike now is when you think about 10 year\nold chubby failure you right just\nthinking of it yeah just thinking about\nkid me and uh yeah\na bit nervous bit scared yeah more than\na bit that's your old Irish resilience\nit is yeah no I mean I can't help us\nI fall back into it I I know I I don't I\ndon't think you should change that I'm\njust I'm pointing it out right so that's\nwe can translate your Irish speak and it\ndoesn't need to change because we both\nknow translated from Irish this is some\nspeaking English yeah right we just\ncan't understand them like no but I mean\nliterally the the translation is when\nsomeone is smiling what they're really\ndoing is crying\nand that's how we translate Irish and if\nthey say a little bit what they mean is\na lot\nyes that's fair that's how you translate\nIrish\nand and um I think here's let me see if\nI got this one right it's all Grand is\nthat what y'all say is that it's all\nGrand yeah it's all shite\nyeah it's like we're just trying to\nprocess and say it will be fine it'll be\nfine right and and if we say if we want\nto translate it's all fine what that\nmeans is oh God I'm terrified about the\nfuture but I don't know how to change it\nso I hope it'll be fine please God let\nit be fine yeah so it's just a bit\nshorthand to say it's fine right we can\ntranslate Irish into English it's just a\nbit easier and faster conversation it's\ngreat yeah\num oh gosh\nhow are you doing Daniel I'm great I'm\nI'm laughing and smiling a lot right now\nyeah you can translate that for Irish\noh God no but it's fascinating yeah oh\nthis is I mean like\nI mean Irish perspective you learn to\nlaugh at yourself you know I'm like this\nis even part of that where like I can\njust kind of play and see it as day it's\nlike God that makes sense and in\nretrospect like just being where I am\nnow it's just like\nit's funny you know I I mean that's just\nme processing it 100 man\num\nquestions otherwise I'm gonna think\noh have a good think if you want I I've\njust been catching some bits from chat\nas we've been going they had a great\nacronym for what an NPC was which was I\nthink not part of the club which is\n[ __ ] great\nI love it Oh no you're all right\nyeah I'm okay\noh God\nchat is brilliant yeah God almighty\nno but it's fascinating because I've not\nthought about some of that like\ndefinitely whenever I go back to see\nlike my therapist like I'm gonna\nactually have to address some of that\nthere's a lot of the conversation with\nyou like more sticking points about the\nold lung and that you know kind of like\nthe mental change there I never thought\nabout that when I was like 10 in that\nbecause I just never thought it was\nimportant\nyou know\nyeah I knew I could tell like things\nwhere it's like something doesn't feel\nquite right and you know and the\ntimeline just kind of makes sense too\nwith catcher in the wrong [ __ ] like that\nyou know just resonating with it\nyeah I think the tricky thing is when\nwe're trying to dig into\num\nyou know our psychology\nthere's certainly like a so the the\nperspective that I shared with you is\nmore from yoga than than\nPsychotherapy or Psychiatry it's it's\nmore about understanding how our mind\nlearns so it's not even about pathology\nor anxiety or anything like that it's\njust what is the process of learning and\nthen what happens is once you have a\nseed of something then you have\nsubsequent experiences that will\nresonate with the seed and cause it to\ngrow into a tree\nso Catcher in the Rye was like giving\nfertilizer some of this other stuff like\nwas like watering that plant and then\nthey're like certain times in your life\nwhere the pneumothorax for example was\nlike chopping down half the tree\nand and so yeah it's so you'll and what\nyou kind of see is that just the way\nthat our mind functions so what the\nyogis sort of discovered is that we\nthink of our mind and our identity as\nstatic\nbut it's not static everything in the\nmind is literally a fluctuation\nso a thought comes and goes an emotion\ncomes and goes even States Of\nConsciousness will come and go\nso these are things that they called\nvritis so they sort of realize there's\nno nothing is permanent in the mind huh\nsorry could you could you just pronounce\nthat word again because it's just very\npleasant sound in vriti\nritzy that's sorry that's just lovely\ncarry on so these are vritis or vrtis\nbut and so everything is just\nfluctuations in the mind and once you\nunderstand that okay like so your\nresonance with Catcher in the Rye there\nwas there had to be something to\nresonate with\nyes right and and so that's kind of what\nhappens with riti is that once we have a\nfluctuation in the mind depending on our\nwhat we encounter in life that vithi\nwill shrink or grow so if I tell you\nthat I love you you will feel a tiny bit\nof love and if I tell I you I love you\nagain you will feel a greater amount of\nlove that riddhi will grow in your mind\nif you tell me that you've failed or did\nsomething bad or whatever and I tell you\nI love you then then the vriti will grow\na lot\ndoes that make sense right so if you\ndon't feel lovable and I tell you I love\nyou anyway that will create a very\npowerful sense of Love inside you\nthis is why it's so damaging when like\nyou have like toxic people in your life\nand you come to them with pride\nyou're like hey I did something and if\nthey're like screw you you're worthless\nit's not good enough that's why it's so\ndamn yeah\nright yeah you never want to be open\nagain absolutely\nso\nyeah I wanted to think so I guess I'll\njust keep going so let me know if you\nwant me to draw this out but let's talk\nabout anxiety\nsure\nso when you're so there's this whole\nexistential dread crap which maybe I'll\nCircle back to but sure\nlet's understand a couple things so when\nyou're anxious\nthere's lots of possibilities and what\nare you trying to do when you're anxious\nI am trying to map out those\npossibilities so that like I'm mentally\nprepared absolutely right so anxiety is\nabout optimization literally that's what\nthe function in our mind of anxiety is\ndesigned to do so what anxiety does is\nit projects a lot of scenarios and then\nif we can think a lot about a lot of\nscenarios we can pick the best one\nand the more that we if we don't know\nwhat the best one is right because when\nyou're anxious it's like hard to pick\nsomething so then what does your mind do\nit just keeps on generating more\npossibilities working through it over\nand over again you start to loop it's\nkind of unproductive right\nyeah you just burn yourself out with\nwhat's potential absolutely possible so\noptimization is the goal and you're\nlooking for perfect if you can find a\nperfect solution are you going to be\nanxious\nlike I mean mentally you'd be like no I\nwon't be anxious again but you're\nprobably still going to be anxious\nbecause you worked yourself up into such\na stupor you know yeah so I I think that\nyou're precisely so theoretically\nhypothetically you will no longer be\nanxious if you have a perfect solution\nbut practically that's impossible yeah\nbecause you've worked yourself into a\ninto Super and also because perfect is\nnot a thing right like in reality\nabsolutely except for your smile\noh okay too sweet so you just told me\nyou love me as well just a moment ago\nyou know so I was going on strong now so\nnow something interesting so when when\nyou had the pneumothorax what I would\nventure\nis that\noptimization became impossible\nyou realize that oh [ __ ] there's no way\nto fix this like I'm gonna die because\nif you sort of think about it\noptimization doesn't\ndeath doesn't really factor into that\nright when we're trying to optimize\nsomething we're not like well [ __ ]\neverything's gonna like it's gonna end\nat some point like so if you sort of\nthink about it death makes Perfection of\nLife impossible\nyeah okay because like that that makes\nsense yeah because it's like you can't\nI'm really around right like especially\nlike you you [ __ ] you're supposed to\nbe in the hospital and you're sitting\nthere like in some Club in in your your\nuni or whatever right and it's like well\nlike wow I could just like die to borrow\nand then like what's the use of\noptimizing all this crap if it's like if\nif I'm gonna die I'm just dead yeah so\nthis is what's really bizarre is anxiety\nis the search for optimization in the\nsearch for perfection\nand sometimes and this happens something\nlike cancer or a spontaneous\npneumothorax will shatter the\npossibility of optimization or\nperfection\nand if you can shatter the possibility\nof perfection like the perfection's just\noff the table optimization is off the\ntable\nthen what it does is shatters the\nanxiety with it because if it's if\nanxiety is trying to do something that\nis impossible and there's like you're\ndone we might as well just do something\nbecause it's not like I can pick the\nperfect choice anyway\nand so I see this a lot where people\nwill sort of say like okay like I almost\ndied and it's the best thing that\nhappened to me people have told me about\nthat about cancer people have told me\nthat about bipolar disorder I'm like\nwhat are y'all talking about\nbut what happens when we start to do\nthat is that it sort of shatters some of\nthese preconceptions and now that\nPerfection is off the table now you're\nkind of free of anxiety right because\nit's like well might as well just do it\nbecause it's not like I can do it\nperfectly anyway and even if I develop\nthe perfect plan everything could be\ntaken away from me at a moment's notice\nyeah so this is the second thing that a\nkind of near-death experience does for\nanxiety is that anxiety is about\nplanning it's about the future it's\nabout I gotta think about step 14 and if\nI can figure out step 14 then I can\nfigure out 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2\n1.\nbut\nif like if you're playing a game and\nlike the internet can go out at any\nminute like you're not playing the long\ngame anymore like if you can Short\nCircuit the dimension of time\nthen anxiety gets way better\nright so like now you've realized that\nlike there's no point in planning for\nthe future because I could die in any\nmoment so might as well do something\nright now\nit's the second thing to understand\nabout anxiety this is also why if we\nlook at evidence-based treatments for\nanxiety things like mindfulness how does\nmindfulness help anxiety it brings us to\nthe present\nanxiety okay\njust better for like mental well-being\nyeah like\num so here's the other cool thing that\nyou have stumbled on\nso you've said that there's a lot of bad\nstuff\nthat is actually good in a weird way\nlike you speak in a lot of\ncontradictions right you're like yes\nhonestly having a spontaneous\npneumothorax I can't sleep on my left I\nI can't exercise with my left arm and\nyet this is this is one of the best\nthings in my life and everyone's like\nyeah like and and you know there are\ngoing to be people who are listening to\nthis who are actually going to be\ncoveting this and I coveted this kind of\nstuff too when I was kind of like\nscrewed up in life I'd heard these\nstories of people like you that almost\ndied and they were like tested right\nthey're like either you're gonna be\nshattered or you're gonna be a Chad and\nI longed for those transformative\nexperiences where I was tired of being\nlike watching life pass me by and I\nwould take being completely shattered\nand broken and at least it's over or be\ntested and be found to be strong enough\nand then I become a different human\nbeing and just like you everything in my\nlife becomes easier I've conquered\nanxiety because I've conquered death\nlike I had these kinds of ideas where I\nwas chasing things like what you were\nkind of you know what happened to you\ngotcha right but one thing that's kind\nof interesting is that when you kind of\nlike had this pneumothorax thing I think\none thing that's really interesting is\nthat good and bad\nyou transcended good and bad\nso there's this concept in in the East\ncalled advait vedanta which is\nnon-dualism\nthrough a bunch of stuff at you but\nbasically like when we think about okay\nalmost you know so having a spontaneous\npneumothorax is objectively bad right\nyeah oh no I mean absolutely would not\nrecommend and and do you think that your\nlife is better because you had that\nspontaneous pneumothorax\nnot specifically because of spontaneous\npneumothorax but what came after that\nsure right but it's all got a bit mixed\nup and and so let me ask you a question\nif I could wave a magic wand and go back\nin time and take that experience away\nfrom you would you want me to do it\n[ __ ]\nI don't know if I would just say like\nthat's the thing because if that was the\ncase\nthen all the mental good that kind of\ncame from it may not necessarily happen\nnow I I imagine it could by a different\nmeans but that is the one that it was\nfor me so I don't know okay I genuinely\ndon't know so that's the right answer\nokay and here's why so you're I'm kind\nof asking you is it better or worse if\nit didn't happen and you're saying I\ndon't know and the answer is is that\nbecause it can't be better or worse it's\nneither better nor worse it is it it's\njust that's what it is\nyeah so I know it sounds kind of weird\nbut the experiences neither good nor bad\nit is both good and bad\nyeah now here's the other problem with\nanxiety anxiety\nrequires a judgmental approach\nso a core part of anxiety is that some\nthings are good and some things are bad\nright because that's what you're\noptimizing yeah because you're trying to\noptimize it so you cannot be anxious\nabout anything that is not good or bad\ndoes that make sense\nyeah like the fact that I'm I'm using a\nclear glass as opposed to a non-clear\nglass when I drink my water is that good\nor bad for you\nit doesn't matter are you anxious about\nthis\nno\nright if it were if I was you know right\nexactly right so so but what what do you\nget anxious about you get anxious about\nbad things so judgment\nin the separation of things in this\nworld into good and bad is a requirement\nfor anxiety\nokay so I think one of the coolest\nthings that happened with you is this\nnear-death experience taught you one\nreally important to tell you all kinds\nof lessons\nbut maybe it wasn't near death\nbut one of the key things that it is it\nchanged your view on good and bad and\nthat allows you to [ __ ] it because if\nthings are like neither good nor bad or\nthere's gonna be some pros and some cons\nit's going to be everything is going to\nbe good and bad then you're freed from\nanxiety because it's like might as well\njust do it like you ought to just do it\nand then you will figure out if that was\ngood or bad as by process more than\nanything you know and here's the crazy\nthing anything that you've done is it\ngood or bad\nlook so just pick something that you did\nthat you were like screw it I'm just\ngonna do it\num\nI I like\njust pick anything like sorry the last\ntime you just like you're like you\nshowed up on stream today\nright I think that's a good thing right\nit but I mean it could have been bad\nI I couldn't offend that I was pretty\nconfident of that going in you're lovely\nyou know so maybe the wrong wrong\nexample kind of the point that I'm\nshooting for is that as you start to\njust do it things are not like good nor\nbad like there's good stuff and bad\nstuff yeah right everything like there's\ngonna be some stuff I'm sure your\nanxiety will be like oh I should have\ndone this\nyou know or maybe I could have talked\nmore about this or maybe I mean who\nknows it sounds like you're actually\npretty good about that kind of stuff so\nyou probably won't do that but and and\nthis so this is the third really\ninteresting thing is that I think you\nhad an experience that really\nshaped they're changed the way that you\nsaw things as good or bad because it's\nkind of weird like this you know it is a\nmixed one yeah I I reckon that's me even\ntalking about dreading that where it's\nlike a weird liberating thing and it's\nlike well what are you talking about you\nknow right imagine towards that yeah and\nthen I kind of ask you is is it a good\nthing and you're like well right so so\nit's liberating and it's bad at the same\ntime and so the more that you see things\nas mixed the the less anxiety that\nyou're gonna have because if there\naren't judgments between good and bad\nthere's no way to optimize if there's no\nway to optimize you might as well just\ndo it\nyeah I mean it makes sense and then just\ndoing things I mean you still hope you\ndo good thing obviously you know or\nso so there's a lot of fundamentals to\nanxiety that I think your story like you\nbeautifully illustrate right so the\nfirst is this kind of Dimension the\nfirst is that anxiety is about\noptimization\nyeah and once you have an experience\nthat sort of teaches you that like\noptimizing like for some [ __ ] perfect\nend game is just like an impossible way\nto live yeah it's not gonna work yeah\nyou know like life is what happens when\nyou've got what what is it the best laid\nplans life is what happens when it ruins\nyour plans or something about that right\nyeah yeah it's when you don't have plans\nor something like that life gets in the\nway when you've got good plans or\nsomething I don't know so so that that's\na really important thing so now\noptimization is off the table the second\nthing is the dimension of time and sort\nof recognizing that time is very limited\nand this is what's really interesting if\nyou go back and you listen to your talk\ntime is limited is dread inducing\nand Dread liberating\nlike oh my God there's only a limited\namount of time so I have to make the\nright choice because if I don't have the\nright choice I will be filled with a\nregret and at the same time time is\nlimited who knows how long we're going\nto be on this Earth so I might as well\npick something\nI'll pick something and then also just\nthe retrospective way would just be it's\nlike I feel like I made good use of my\ntime there and that's almost reassured\nand just good for the brain absolutely\nyou know if you look in the mind of an\nanxious person the problem is that they\nthink that since time is limited I have\nto make the right choice they think that\ntheir anxiety is tied to the fact that\nthey that time is limited but what they\ndon't realize is that your attitude\ntowards how limited time is can result\nit can can push you into opposite\ndirections one is paralysis and one is\nsudden complete action\ntime is limited in either case but for\nsome of us it cripples us and for some\nof us it's like [ __ ] it I might as well\nact today let's go yeah just the amount\nof action at that point yeah and that's\nthe problem with being anxious is you\npeople think that their anxiety is\ndetermined by the fact that time is\nlimited but it's their attitude towards\nthat that actually results in the\nanxiety it's actually in your control\nwhich is what a lot of people don't get\nthey think it's the other way around\nthey feel controlled by the fact that\nthey don't have infinite time and they\ncan't play every game on the universe\nand they can't watch every movie in\nexistence and they can't do everything\nright time's limited oh my God it's your\nattitude towards it that is actually\ncreates anxiety and this is what's super\ncool is that when it comes to anxiety\nnow we're going to kind of come full\ncircle this is the way that I am this is\nthe way that I'm wired no\nthis is the way that you have been wired\nup until this point but you've shown us\nthat drastic change is possible\nand if you dig into [ __ ] the sources\nof your existential dread which still\ncause you to wake up at the age of 28 in\na cold sweat and you heal that you will\nchange\nif you start to really lean into you've\nalready figured this stuff out\nbut if you lean into this idea that\nanxiety is born of optimization and\noptimization requires judgment requires\nthe demarcation between good and bad\nand as you start to live in more advait\nlife\na device means non-dual that there is\nneither good nor bad which you're\nalready doing\nyour anxiety will get even better\nthat's good I mean that that sounds good\nyeah like I mean it's just handle an\nanxiety at her you know\nnot handling no well I'm phrasing\num yeah no and that's why I'm\nso this is important so this is like\nwhat's really cool is the yogis believe\nthat anxiety can be conquered\nnot handled\nso I do think that it is good to handle\nanxiety but I also have found something\nreally interesting when I work with\npatients which is that if you look at\nthings like the placebo effect if I have\na patient and we both believe that the\nboth the best that they can do is cope\nI sometimes wonder if I'm doing my\npatients a disservice by not opening the\npossibility in their mind of a more\ncomplete healing\nokay no yeah that that makes sense\nactually yeah right and sometimes you\ngot to be the opposite where you gotta\nmoderate your expectations and you got\nto say hey this is what the answer well\nno of course because I I mean you know\neven with anxiety and that like I'm very\nmuch aware I you know I've got it for\nlife as is anxiety yep\num but you know so um\nso I think that's why I just keep saying\nthings like handling on that but even\nlike the positive mental attitude of\nsaying things like conquer and that like\nthere is more reassuring because it's\nyou're doing way more than handling\nthere at that point you know\num and so what I would kind of say is\nwhen I when I work with people what I've\nsort of settled on is okay this is what\nthe science tells us is likely\nand I'm gonna hope for more\nyeah\nright so we're going to teach you coping\nmechanisms we're going to teach you how\nto cope you're gonna be you're gonna get\nyour oxygen mask that has copium on in\nit you know\nlife support but then also off it\neventually yeah because coping gets\nexhausting after a while and we really\nshould shoot for like change and I I'm\nhopeful for that for you because you've\nalready come so far like it's amazing\ndude thank you you're so kind\num I mean I I just know that like I\ncompared to where I was like I know like\nmy mental habits have gotten a lot\nbetter I know mindfulness is just a huge\nthing um you know even just exercise and\ntrying to exercise on the regular helps\na lot just because again you're\nthrown into the present moment with\nstuff like that you know can't really\nconcentrate on anything else they kind\nof just settles your brain yeah\num I'm wondering if like like what would\nbe like the most practical\nrecommendation or or like that you could\ngive for like chat or something like\nkind of almost imagine anxiety or like\ninitial steps like we talked about\nmindfulness and stuff like that is there\nlike a particular like\nresource or thing that you could Point\npeople towards\nI like a book even yeah so so I mean we\nhave so I we built a guide to anxiety\nwhich is oh yeah no I I know in the\nprogram actually yeah yeah so so I mean\nthat's why we built it because people\nyeah have these kinds of conversations\nwhere we'll illustrate Concepts and and\nyeah so like we have an anxiety guide\nwhich someone just messaged me about and\nwas you know they had a very good\nexperience with but so I think it works\nreally well there's a bunch of\nmeditation techniques in there we also\nwill optimize all kinds of other stuff\nlike we'll talk about diet and even like\ngut health and and things like that\nthere's all kinds of like fascinating\nlike scientific interventions\num yeah also explain things from a\nclinical perspective so that's our\nresource so the the resources that we\nbuild are the ones that you know if\npeople want like you know 15 hours of\nstuff on anxiety that kind of walks you\nthrough start to finish that's what I\nwould recommend\nin your case\nI think you need to get Physiotherapy\nyeah that's fair my doctor said the same\nthing\nright and and because I I just need to\ndo it yeah yeah no excuse\nand it's okay but you know I I think I\ndon't like I'm just honest with myself\nthere it's like yeah I just gotta do\nthat at some point yeah when when do you\nthink that Point's gonna be\nsoon it needs to be soon yeah good I\nneed to start looking at it that way\nrather than just even put it off because\nI think that's even part of it I'm like\nI'll do it later like no I need to just\ncall tomorrow or some [ __ ] you know like\nget the ball rolling as much as they\npossibly can yeah and and so I invite\neveryone who's watching to take their\ninspiration from you\nand you're saying what are their\nresources sure you guys check out Dr K's\nguide to anxiety it really is great but\nalso\nlike I think there's there's things that\nwe all think about doing that we don't\nactually do and then there's no like\nresource\nfor that yeah no that's that's you know\nand so I would say like by all means\ncheck out the resource but also\nyou got to be super careful the\nresources will help you\nbut they won't ever do the work for you\nyeah no that that makes complete sense\nyeah probably a bit naive for me to say\nit's like what could we read to fix it\nno no no no no no I I didn't interpret\nit that way I I I really do think it's\nit's good I mean I think it's a it's the\nit's arguably the most helpful question\nthat has been asked over the last two\nhours\nand at the same time I think sometimes\nespecially if we're talking to anxious\npeople right they're like okay if I get\n15 resources and I optimize it at some\npoint yeah I won't have to overcome that\nhump\nyeah so we can help you get 99 of the\nway there but it's that last one percent\nthat you gotta jump\nright you gotta you gotta overcome it\nyourself so\ntake an inspiration from your therapy\nsession no but it's good though it's\ngood stuff honestly yeah\nany last uh thoughts or questions before\nwe wrap up for the day\num honestly just thanks very much for\nhaving me and just you know having a\nchat in that like it's just it it's it's\ngenuinely nice like\num you know and just like even talking\nmental health in the public space like I\nI just love the concept of that\num you know and I know you've done a lot\nof advocacy work there of course like\nkind of true to streams and that's just\nyou know thank you very much because it\nit is very important yeah you're very\nwelcome and thank you\num because you know we can't do this\nwork alone like this like this work\nrequires you right it really I mean I I\nthink the reason we're here is not\nactually because of I mean like I'm a\npart of it right so maybe 50 at tops but\nthe reason we're here is because people\ncome on and like share their stories and\nso seriously like thank you\nno problem at all I have one last thing\nthat I wanted to say which I thought was\nkind of interesting so because we were\ntalking about male Mental Health\nso you know one thing that's really\ninteresting about male mental health and\nyou were talking a lot about\nvulnerability and talking\nyeah so I think that stuff is really\nimportant and like I am a psychiatrist I\nhave conversations with people talking\nis great\nbut if you look at emotional healing one\nof the really interesting things is that\nour system of emotional healing is based\non talking\nand that system of emotional healing we\nassume that what we need to do is talk\nright but the whole point is that it's\nhard for men to talk\nand so then what we say is you as a man\nneed to learn how to talk\nright\nyeah so there's a interesting thing so\nif you really look at research what we\nkind of discover is a couple of very\ninteresting things about emotional\nhealing in men the first is that\nthe majority of I think Freud's patients\nI think were women\nyes two-thirds of therapists are women\ntwo-thirds of people in therapy are\nwomen\na lot of our studies are done on equal\nnumbers of gender ratios so we usually\ncontrol for that kind of thing but if\nyou look at how did we design the study\nin the first place it is predominantly\nPsychotherapy done on women so that's\njust the majority of what clients have\nbeen\nand so there's one really interesting\nthing if you look at studies on couples\ncounseling\nmen are more reluctant to engage in\ncouples counseling and if you ask them\nwhy they feel like they are at a\ndisadvantage\nbecause if they were talking about\nheteronormative relationships so women\nand their therapists are more versed in\nemotional vocabulary whereas men have\ndifficulty with it\ndisadvantage you know even like the\nlanguage of it there it's like it's\nalmost like hostility and resistant to\nit right and so there's something I I\nsaw something really weird recently I\nwas witness to something called an anger\nceremony so a bunch of dudes\nwent out into the woods\nand they like got into a circle and then\nthey each went off like let's say a\nkilometer out into the woods and then\nthey yelled really loud and they sort of\nlike picked up sticks and threw things\nand smacked things around and then they\nall came back in the middle\nand then they cried and hugged and it\nwas very healing\nso one of the things that I sometimes\nwonder about I don't know what the hell\nhappened there I don't know what the\nscience is behind it I don't know if\nit's effective to treat something but\none of the things that I'm starting to\nrealize is that\nour assumptions about how to heal mental\nhurt being tied to language I think\ncould be biased\nwhen Freud sat down with his patients\nright he was saying okay how do I heal\nthe mind but I don't know that he really\nunderstood that there was a bias to his\nanswer there because he was working with\na particular population\nand one of the things that I really\nwonder about and I've been sort of like\nthinking about this more there's a lot\nof research on something called Norman\nof male alexithymia which is that men\nare colorblind to their emotional state\nand have difficulty describing it now we\nsort of assume that this is a\ncultural thing that is bad that men are\ndeficient in this way but one of the\nthings that I'm starting to wonder is\nsince it's normative and like all men\nhave it\nare the relationships that men have with\ntheir emotions fundamentally different\nand the way the most natural way for a\nman to heal their emotions may not be\nthrough words and I'm a big fan of words\nI'm not saying words are bad yeah\nbecause I mean no I mean words are\ndefinitely like they they work and\nthey're effective in that but yeah maybe\nthere is just other avenues in that you\nknow like so I've never heard of that\nyeah like\nI think I think men are very somatic\nright so if I ask you like what is\nexistence tell me about existential\ndread if I asked you where you felt it\nin your body and what it feels like\nyou'd be very good at describing that\nright so this existential dread so I\nwould even ask you when you were 10\nyears old and you decided to quit the\nSailing Club what did you feel in your\nbody I would bet money that you felt\nsomething here and it was really really\nstrong and this thing got control of you\nand so the really fascinating thing is\nif we look at some of these things and\nI'll do this with my male patients who\nare Alexa thymic I don't actually talk\nto them I mean I do talk to them but\nwhat really is healing is that all help\nthem work on their emotions in a\nphysical way and that seems to work\nreally well\nusually you want to tie it all together\nI think words are really powerful\nthere's a lot of good news yeah yeah but\nI think we don't have to be exclusive\nyou know yeah right like but yeah I mean\nthe physical like actually just\nmanifested in a physical way and just\ntrying to\npay attention to that as well like\ndefinitely yeah because like I mean I I\nbecause I I can like pinpoint it where\nit's like it's here that's where it is\nyou know and I almost understanding that\nit could be helpful and and there's some\ninteresting science that sort of shows\nthat are body and brain are like\nhomeostatic which means that if you\nmentally feel a certain way you're gonna\nphysically feel a certain way if you\ntake away the mental emotion the\nphysical feeling will get better make\nsense\nyeah the interesting thing is that the\nreverse is true\nif we change the physical sensation the\nemotion will get better it's a two-way\nstreet everything in our body is a\ntwo-way street and so I think especially\nyeah okay yeah especially for men I'm\nbeginning to wonder about\nother methods of treating mental burdens\nand utilizing the body more\nI just wanted to share that because\nwe're talking about Ireland and dudes\nand yeah yeah no your grand I mean\nsomething I mean something that probably\nties that's very much a stigma where\nit's like sometimes with mental health\nespecially if like post relationship\nyou've had a breakup or something what\nwhat is a map what are you gonna do I'm\ngonna go hit the gym you know and it's\nlike the physical activity and that and\nthat can almost be a healing process for\nsome folks\nyou could even tie that into looking at\nit for like just mental health and like\nwhat's actually going on there you know\nyeah so I I think that's a beautiful\nexample so I think one interesting thing\nis if you talk to people about breakups\nright dudes can't say\nuh how do you feel after a breakup you\ncan't say well I feel unlovable I feel\nafraid for my future I feel like\num you know I'm I'm not worthy as a\nhuman being they don't say that but what\nyou can absolutely say is I feel like\nsomeone kicked me in the balls and\neveryone knows exactly what you're\ntalking about\nright right she like she kicked me in\nthe balls and she ripped this out and\nlike I feel like like you know like\nthey'll use this very physical language\nand I've also seen that with people that\nI work with when they\nare able to like when they do hit the\ngym and they can literally carry weight\nthey get better at carrying weight they\nseem to get care better at carrying\ntheir emotional burdens too which is why\nthere's such a big emphasis on this even\nin some of these toxic masculine uh\nclassically toxic masculine communities\nyeah\nbut I think there's there's something\nthere so yeah I just wanted to share\nthat because I I really appreciated the\nconversation about Irish mental health\nand Irish perspectives and yeah no I\nmean that yeah it's just a fascinating\nway of looking at it like I never really\nthought about that too much but\nyeah it's like it's like just actual\nphysical activity almost to bring out\nsome of that and as a way of processing\nthat I've never heard of people just\nscreaming in the field and that which is\nlike yes wild as a concept yes I mean\nthere isn't data on that so I don't I I\nit seemed to be healing that's the word\nI would use I don't know if it's\nclinically better if it works\nI didn't scare you know the local\nCountryside I mean it was scary too that\nwas weird it was like you know this it\nwas scary but anyway oh God we don't\nknow\num okay so thank you very much Daniel\nthank you yeah no thank you so much for\nhaving me yeah and good luck
