    "transcript": "when you start to believe something\nabout yourself it starts to shape what\nyou choose to do or not do so if I say\nsomething like I am socially anxious I\nam socially awkward that belief in\nmyself is going to prevent me from\nengaging in whatever that activity is so\nI'm not going to go to parties because\nI'm socially anxious and so the beliefs\nthat you have about yourself start to\nshape your actions and determine your\nfuture and what always happens with the\nbeliefs that you have about yourself is\nthey become self-fulfilling prophecies\nif I believe I'm socially awkward and I\nhave all this evidence by the way Dr K\nit's not you know the reason you're\nsaying that is because like bro you\ndon't know me you don't know how\nsocially awkward I am I'm absolutely\nsocially awkward Okay cool so you're\nsocially awkward so then what so you're\nnot going to go to a party if you're not\ngoing to go to a party then what you're\ngoing to your social skills will atrophy\nand then you will become socially\nawkward it's a vicious cycle in the\nwrong direction the key thing to\nunderstand is these are all ego based\nstatements they're statements of I am\nand this may sound weird but all that\ncrap is BS because who you are is\ndetermined by your actions right"
