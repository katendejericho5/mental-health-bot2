    "transcript": "so when I'm reading a textbook I have to\nforce my mind to pay attention which\nmeans that I'm actually strengthening\nthis capability in the mind so the Mind\nwhatever you stretch and whatever you\nexercise is what gets better so if I\nspend a lot of time listening to music\nmy brain will actually do\nneuroplasticity we'll get better at\nlistening to music the more we practice\nfocusing our attention the better we\nwill be at focusing now what happens is\nwith things like short form content they\ndo all the hard work for you because if\nsomething doesn't hold your attention\nfor 15 seconds you scroll past it right\nso everyone is engineering content so\nthat you are just like you're sitting\nand someone else is driving so what\nstarted to happen with our attention is\ninstead of taking the stairs we're\ntaking the elevator all the time so we\nare deconditioning our minds and then it\nbecomes harder to focus which is why you\nwill stand in a grocery store line and\ninstead of just enjoying a moment you\nhave to look at your phone"
