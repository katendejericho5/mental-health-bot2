    "transcript": "the reason that video games and gambling\nthe reason they're so addictive is\nactually the denial of a reward I feel\nthat because you're just like you said\nlike I actually can stop on a win but I\ncannot stop on a loss that is that is\nwhere the compulsion is uh one more my\neyes will be watering and it's just I I\ncannot walk away with that absolutely\nbecause I think we sort of know that if\nyou look at the human brain and and what\nthe brain likes so we as a society value\nthings that are difficult now this is\nkind of at the cultural level and at the\nNeuroscience level so if you even think\nabout something as simple as a child\nthat's learning how to walk or even pick\nup an object a child who's trying to\npick up a ball will fail thousands of\ntimes and yet there's something in our\nbrain that impels them to keep trying so\nanytime we have difficulty and we're\ndenied a reward and then we get the\nreward that's what actually releases\nlike a very high amount of dopamine yes"
