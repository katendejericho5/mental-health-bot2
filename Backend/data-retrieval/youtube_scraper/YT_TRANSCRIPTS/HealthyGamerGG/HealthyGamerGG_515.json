    "video_title": "This Is How Therapy Helps Traumatized People",
    "transcript": "so if we look at doing therapy with\npeople who are traumatized what we sort\nof discover is that if someone has been\ntraumatized like let's say they were\nabused they carry that trauma within\nthem and what we know clinically is if\nwe can get them to vent that trauma the\nenergy within diminishes so as someone\ngoes to psychotherapy and as they talk\nabout their trauma essentially there's\nstuff that's stored in here which gets\nvented out and as we vent our negative\nemotions as we talk about that trauma is\nwe're honest and authentic and as our\ntherapist creates a non-judgmental space\nwhere they're compassionate with us and\nwe can share our shame and our negative\nemotions what starts to happen to the\ntraumatic individuals that shame and\nthat negativity that used to control\ntheir life stops controlling their life\nthis is literally the evidence-based\napproach of psychotherapy that what\nPsychotherapy tries to do is take\nnegativity within you and have you\nvocalize it externally and when you\nvocalize it externally the power of it\ndiminishes"
