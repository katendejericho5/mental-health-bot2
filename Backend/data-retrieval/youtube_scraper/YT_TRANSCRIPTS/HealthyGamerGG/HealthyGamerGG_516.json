    "transcript": "hello sir\nHi how are you I'm doing well it's a\npleasure to meet you I'm all Oak I'm\nknown as Dr k\noloke yeah what do you guys uh well my\nname's Dantes okay and yeah\nand so I don't know exactly what we're\ngoing to be talking about today but just\nto make sure we're clear I'm not your\npsychiatrist I'm not going to be\ndiagnosing you or treating you for\nanything but I'd love to have a\nconversation with you about whatever the\nhell you want to talk about all right\nperfect\num what do you yeah\nwhat do you want to talk about today so\nI feel like for a very long time I've\nhad like problems with insecurity okay\nwell I always feel like no matter what I\ndo it's never enough and no matter like\nhow much I'll grow or how much I'll\ninvest my time into like my grinds or my\ngoals or whatever it might be that not\nonly is it never enough but that it will\nalso never be enough for anyone\nand because of that it's always been a\nthing where I like always push myself to\nlike my literal limit because of you I\nguess like my body I was just like a way\nfor me to like grow and to progress my\ngoals so that's why I always like push\nmyself past my boundaries and all these\nthings because it's almost like\nthe only thing that really matters to me\nis achieving something\nokay\nso it sounds like your body is a as a\nvehicle or a tool for your Ambitions\nexactly and what are your ambitions\nto be the best at everything I do\nokay so just like in every sense of the\nword like let's say when it comes to the\ngym right it's like to get the best body\nthat I can possibly have\num when it comes to shimming to become\nthe best Shimmer I can possibly be when\nit comes to my game becoming the best\nplayer that I can possibly be and it's\njust to like literally become the best\nat everything okay\num\nthe okay give me one second I just\nrealized I may need my iPad\nyep\nokay because we're gonna map some things\nout for you all right and okay so best\nat everything you do so tell me what\ngame do you play or games League of\nLegends oh damn okay so yeah and how's\nhow's that going\num I mean it's good like I'm a\nconsistently Challenger player which is\nthe highest rank\num my goal is to get like the literal\nhighest rank which should be rank one so\nthat's why every every so often I'll\nhave like coaches come to my shame who\nwill like kind of teach me more things\nabout the game and then I'll also like\nplay like 12 hours a day stream like 12\nto 13 hours a day just like grind as\nmuch as I possibly can to improve okay\nand\nwhy do you want to be the best\nI don't know it's just it's just one of\nthose things where I guess it was\nbecause when I was younger I grew up as\nkind of like the the the fat kid right\nand I remember I was also like there was\nalso a time where I first started\nplaying the game and back then I used to\nbe like the lowest rank right so it was\nbronze and as time went on and I noticed\nthat my I guess like my physique would\nimprove or my rank would improve that it\nwould seem that more people would I\nguess want to interact with me more\npeople would want to be I guess like\nfriendlier with me Selena just got to a\npoint where I kind of found it\nsynonymous with like growth and then\nalso like per people's perception of you\nalso becoming better if that makes sense\nso then it just always made it so I was\nlike well if I don't necessarily\ninteract with all these people and\ninstead I just keep focusing on growing\nand growing and growing then\nI guess normally in like a Revenge way\nthat you take away your ability to\ninteract with them which is what they\nwant in pursuit of like your goals and\nother things but just more so the thing\nwhere you always make yourself the\npriority\nokay\nso so so I'm hearing\ncan I think for a second yeah\nyou're very good with words\num you're very insightful I'm guessing\nyou've thought a lot about this yeah\nbecause so back in the day um whenever I\nwould end my streams uh what I would do\nis I would just sit there and I would do\nintrospection for like hours every day\nso I would have a thought like let's say\nlet's say it's all like an apple right\nand I would think like what is my\nreaction to the word apple and then\nlet's say it was negative then I would\nthink of like all the individual\nconstituents of like what an apple is\nright so like it's color it's shape its\nsize its taste and then I would try to\nthink back to all my I guess\ninteractions with everything\nin the past that could have led me to\nhaving that negative perception of an\napple now right so I would always do\nthis for like hours every night until I\ngot to a point where I'd become very I\nguess\nnot really knowledgeable about myself\nbut just more so have a very in-depth\nunderstanding of like why I am the way I\nam\nbro that is fascinating\nthanks can I just process for a second\nyeah sure okay\nso many questions okay hold on a second\ngive me give me give me a sec because\nyou're so introspective it's interesting\nbecause just in your opening statements\nthere's like so much there so I'm just\ntrying to organize like how we're gonna\nunderstand what the hell is going on\nyeah\nokay let me start with this so you said\nyou used to do this every day\nhow\nthis I mean like thinking for hours\nevery every night you said yeah how long\nwere you doing that\nyes because so it started when I was uh\n16 because I'm not sure if you're\nfamiliar with Destiny yeah\nthe Creator okay both yeah so it's\nbecause at the time I used to watch him\na lot and one of his big things is like\nunderstanding why you hold the views\nthat you have so every night what I\nwould do is I would listen to like three\nto four hours of his debates and after\nlistening to his debates I would just\nkind of like ask myself what do I think\nabout the things he's debating and then\nI try to understand why I've come to\nthose like beliefs so I was just trying\nto find out all like my foundational\nbeliefs for the views I had and then\nafterwards\num when I had like more time I guess\nlike becoming a content creator that's\nwhen I translated that and instead of\njust understanding my beliefs I tried it\nusing that but for My Views instead so\nlike my views on everything my views on\nlife in general on like relationships\num friendship stuff like that and then\nthat's how I just kind of got that like\nunderstanding okay\nand can you tell me a little bit about\nyour views on life\nuh and what sounds\nwhat are you doing here bro\nI don't know I mean that that's the\nweird thing it's just some of those\nthings right so I kind of view Life as a\nvideo game right okay and I view myself\nas like a video game character where\nlet's say right now I'm like level 21\nand I have all these stats like strength\nintelligence\num speed right and my only goal is to\nmake it so that I can upgrade my\ncharacter\nas much as I possibly can so that's one\nof the reasons why I'll like play league\nas much as I do or I'll sit there and\nI'll like work out as much as I do is\nbecause every time I work out I view it\nas like I'm upgrading my strength right\nevery time I play league I was like I'm\nupgrading my gameplay my intelligence\nand I just want to kind of like max out\nmy stats okay\nso\num awesome man\nokay\nand you mentioned that you grew up as a\nfat kid\nyeah can you tell me a little bit about\nthat\nso actually quick question so you're\nsure you're using your headset mic right\num let me just make sure with Discord\nhold on\nuh\nvoice on video dude this is gonna be\ngreat\nI'm so excited yeah everything should be\ngood okay it says head semi yeah okay\nperfect\nokay so um my upbringing was a little\nbit weird because\nI grew up on a boat so uh when I was\nfive my parents had taken me out of\nschool for two years and we had lived on\na boat for two years and we're just kind\nof like sailing the Caribbean\nand it was there that\nI mean I never really viewed my weight\nas any kind of thing\num but I did gain a better weight like\nthere but then it was kind of like when\nI got back that I I was not that I was\nlike super obese right but I remember\nbeing in grade school and having people\nask like oh guys how much do you weigh\nand then you'd have a kid that would say\n70 and then another kid would be like oh\nI weigh 60 right and then I would sit\nthere and like lie because I knew that\nmy weight was the only one in the triple\ndigits so instead of saying 100 I'd sit\nthere and I'd say like oh yeah like I'm\n90. you know\nso my weight was always something that\nwas like a bit insecure about\num\nand\nit was like that for a few years until\nwhen I was 15\n. I remember that there was this time\nwhere\nI just sat there and been like I I want\nto make a change just like\nfor attention or whatever else it might\nbe like just have a better body in\ngeneral have a better view of myself so\nthat's when I was 15 and I know it was\nlike bad but at the time I had starved\nmyself for a few months and then I had\none vegetarian for a few months and then\nafter that is when I started like my\nweightlifting Journey\nso when you said that you\num\nwanted a better see when you were 15 you\ndecided you want a better view of\nyourself yep what was your view of\nyourself when you were 15.\nwell it was just one of those things\nwhere\nlike my high school experience right I\nwasn't the popular kid like people knew\nme but they knew me I was like the weird\nkid that would ask weird questions right\num\nwhat what kind of questions would you\nask\noh um well so\nso for example right\num we'd be in like a science class and\nthen the teacher would talk about like\nlet's say how as you age your DNA like\nshortens and that's the reason why like\npeople die\nso I would ask the kind of question\nwhere I'd say if you were to like end\ngame make a weapon of mass destruction\nwhere you could like shorten people's\nDNA with like electromagnetic\nfrequencies could that be a possible\nweapon you know and they would always\nlike look at me kind of weird\num but it was just like that's the way\nmy mind worked like I would always kind\nof like think of the absolute extremes\nof everything and then try to like\nreally figure out stuff\nand how did people respond to you when\nyou were trying to figure out stuff\nthey would laugh a lot of the time like\nthey would sit there they would be like\noh here he is asking his dumb questions\nagain\num and things like that but my mom was\nalways like super supportive of it\nbecause she would always tell me how\nlike there was one guy when she was in\nhigh school who everyone thought would\nalways ask the dumbest questions but\nthen he grew up to be like a\nneurosurgeon making more than all of\nthem so she was always like if you're\ncurious about everything just like\nalways ask always inquire never like\nhold yourself back and whatever others\nmight think is dumb just like\nyou like\nif it's pertinent to you then you\nunderstand that right yeah okay so it\nsounds like your mom was supportive of\nyou asking dumb questions yeah and can\nyou tell me a little bit more about your\nmom\nuh\nmy mom very\nvery driven\num she would always like she has because\nmy mom and dad they're still together\nand she like worked as a police officer\nand even working like full time she\nwould still always like cook meals at\nhome for me and my brother\num so I grew up with like a very kind of\nlike normal family like there was never\nreally any issues never really any\nproblems\num obviously we'd have like our\narguments my mom was my mom was always\nmore of like the stubborn parent\num or else my dad was more like laid\nback one so there'd be that but it was\nlike a very normal upbringing okay and\ncan you tell me a little bit about your\ndad\nyeah so my dad uh we have a very close\nrelationship too\num I view both my parents as like\nfriends\nuh so me and him like will watch shows\ntogether uh\nhe also worked as a police officer for\nlike years that's how he had met my mom\nand yeah he's a very like\nvery as well a kind of driven guy he\nwould always do\num humanitarian missions like in Rwanda\nor Haiti\num as a peacekeeper so it would it would\nbe like a lot of stuff like that okay\nwow dude and how did y'all end up on a\nboat for two years\nso it was because when my dad had read\nmy mom they had made this for some\nreason I think it was like my dad had\nlet my mom in on his idea and then my\nmom kind of was like okay where she had\nalways wanted to like go on an adventure\nand live on a boat so when we were in\nkindergarten or when I was in\nkindergarten and my brother was in\nsecond grade that's where my parents\nsaid you know it's now or never so my\ndad took his early retirement uh he was\nin his early 40s\nuh no I think late 40s because he turned\n50 on the boat so he was in his late 40s\nso he took an early retirement and then\nwe uh took out a second mortgage on the\nhouse and we rented it out for that year\nand then he bought a boat and we sailed\nfor two years from\nFlorida to Grenada\nand how old were you when that happened\nI was five\nwhat what did you what was that like for\nyou\nso it was an extreme like I mean it's\nnot the kind of experience you'd ever\nlike have normally at that age right so\nfor me it was very cool because I was\nable to experience many different\ncultures I was able to experience many\ndifferent like walks of life like I\nwould visit some cities or some places\nand you know there would be some kids\nwho wouldn't even have shoes right and\num so I was exposed to like a lot of\nthese things and a lot of these like\nkind of like Concepts um at that age\nbut the one thing that it also\nintroduced me to is the sense that\neverything was like temporary because\nnormally when you're a kid right uh\nyou'll have like your friends and then\nyou'll have your school and every day\nit's the same kind of routine the same\nkind of like environment but when you're\nliving on a boat it's a bit different\nbecause what happens is that\nyou'll be there and you'll make a friend\nwith a guy and you'll become best\nfriends with this guy right\nand you'll sit there and he'll be your\nbest friend for like two weeks and then\nafter that you'll never see him again so\nyou kind of need to come to terms with\nthe fact that not everything is\npermanent at a very young age\nI'm gonna need another second to think\nyeah\nwhat do you think about that that life\nis temporary\nwell\nI wouldn't necessarily say life is\ntemporary so much I would say that\neverything that you do is temporary\nand\nI kind of like that idea in the sense\nthat it means that you always have the\ncapability for growth or change\num but at the same time the one kind of\nthing about it and I guess this is the\nissue that I have like with\nrelationships is that it makes you view\neverything as temporary so then you\nalways need to be constantly improving\nbecause if everything's changing and\nyou're saying the same then everyone\nelse is improving around you you're not\nso then there's a high chance that you\nget left if that makes sense and what\nyeah makes a lot of sense so it's it's\nalmost like a\nan endless competition\nyeah or like a race yeah and help me\nunderstand what's what happens for the\npeople who win\nwhat do you get\nwell I mean ideally for me right one day\nit would be that you have like a family\nthat you would have kids right you'd\nhave a very nice circle around you stuff\nlike that\nwhat about League of Legends or physical\nyou know chadness\noh oh so I got it okay if I remember\nlike the the absolute angle yeah I\ndidn't mean the absolute end goal\nyeah so I mean so like that's the kind\nof issue with that is that you can't\nreally become the best right so you're\nit always keeps you in the state where\nyou always have to constantly improve\nyou always have to sit there and you\nalways have to improve your physique you\nalways have to improve like your\ngameplay you always have to get better\nand there never really is a point where\nit stops because it can't stop since\nit's an Ever evolving thing\nyeah so that's what's what kind of\nconfuses me is like I ask you like what\nwhat's the point of winning the game of\nlife you're like having a family and\nhaving kids and having friends and then\nyeah but it sounds like the way you're\nliving your day to day which I'm not\ntrying to criticize in any way so please\ndon't take I'm just trying to understand\nit seems like that's not what you're\nthinking about or how are those two\nthings tied together\nso I guess the way that I see it is I\nview it as a thing where now that I'm in\nmy early 20s and I have this like drive\nthis motivation this passion that I can\nuse all of these attributes to really\njust like sacrifice in the short term\nand like just put my everything on my\ngrinds and all these things so that one\nday I can come to a point where I feel\nlike okay if I want to take time off to\nconnect with my family or to maybe\npursue something then I'll be able to\nbecause I already went through that\ngrind\nand what are you sacrificing in the\nshort term\nwell I mean so for example like my\nday-to-day life is I'll wake up I'll\nshower I'll work out I'll stream for\nabout 12 hours I'll sit in my chair for\na bit and then I go to sleep and the\nonly thing that I really do is like I\nmight respond to um my response like\nfriends right on messages because I\nalways like respond to messages but I\nmean I'm living with my family I don't\nreally like hang out with them that much\nI live in the same city I was like my\nfriends don't really like meet up with\nthem that often I don't really like do\nanything apart from I guess grind\nokay thank you for explaining what your\nday-to-day is like I'm still going to\nstick with the same question what are\nyou sacrificing\nI guess I mean I guess that's a good\nquestion because it's not really so much\nof a sacrifice as it is that you're\nprioritizing one thing over another\nright\num so I don't I guess I wouldn't really\nsay that I'm sacrificing anything\nbecause at the end of the day\nyou're just making a short-term not\nnecessarily sacrifice but a short-term\ninvestment is what I guess I would call\nit and then in the hopes that later on\nit pays off and what kind of payoff are\nyou looking for\nwell I'm just hoping that like one day I\ncan sit there and be 30 and if I wanted\nto take off a few years right to\nlike uh just spend time with like the\nfamily that I'll have right with my wife\nkids stuff like that that I'll be able\nto and I'll be in like I guess a secure\nenough position that anything like that\nwould be a possibility\nokay\ndid you like being on a boat with your\nfamily for two years yeah I mean it was\ncool because\nso that was like one of the times where\nI would always kind of use my\nimagination right because since you\nnormally have other kids to play with I\nplay with my brother sometimes but most\nof the time would just be spent like me\nmaking up these like make-believe\nbattles with my toys or stuff like that\nor there would be times where my brother\nwould play on the GameCube we'd play\nvideo games stuff like that every night\nuh us and our parents we'd watch like\nshows on the little TV we had so it was\nvery like um it made our family very I\nguess tight-knit and very close is that\nsomething you want for the family that\nyou're gonna have one day\nyeah and and if you're 30 years old and\nyou wanted to take a couple years off\nwhat do you what would you want to do\njust be able to really sit there and I\nguess like appreciate the moment because\nlike let's say when you do have kids\nright they're not gonna be in that like\nyoung developmental State forever so I\nguess being able to spend as much time\nwith them while they're in that state\nand being able to I guess create as many\nmemories as possible would be\nlike a pretty\ngood experience okay so it sounds like\nyou're making you're prioritizing\ngrinding success\nso that you'll have freedom\nto spend time with your children so it's\nkind of like it sounds like really\nfreedom is what you're looking for yeah\nexactly yep and that's one of the\nreasons too I love streaming so much\nbecause when I was in school the thing\nthat I hated was feeling like I had to\nstudy right so I just didn't or I hated\nfeeling like I had to do homework so I\njust didn't so that's why the cool thing\nabout streaming is that it's one of\nthose things where you can kind of like\nchoose your hours you can choose like\nwhat you want to do so it gives you the\noption to really have that freedom even\nthough you're still like I guess working\nhaving this job right it gives you I\nguess a little bit of leeway that makes\nit feel like okay I like I could do what\nI want when I want\nso I'm hearing that you\nso I'm guessing that you don't feel\nShackled to the stream right you don't\nfeel like you have to stream every day\nno because so the thing about me is that\nthe thing that I love about streaming is\nthat I've always loved the idea of like\nsharing experiences with others like I\nwas the kind of kid where let's say when\nI was younger me and my dad were to\nwatch Family Guy right or something like\nthat\num we would sit there and if my dad\nwould go to the bathroom I'd pause the\nshow because if anything funny happened\nand he wasn't there to experience that\nmoment it's almost like that funny thing\nnever really happened so the cool thing\nabout trimming is that if I'm able to\nlike share a thought or share an idea or\nmake a cool play then it's almost like\nthat play is alive because there were\nother people around to experience it\nyeah wow that's really are you like a\nlike what are you like on stream when\nyou play LOL are you like positive and\nPMA are you like a\num toxic Challenger player or what\nI'm like a raging schizo okay I guess so\nyeah so I guess like my thing is that\nno no chat can you guys chat yeah okay\nso like what I would say is I'm very\nlike psychotic\num because the thing about me is like\nI'll say crazy things right and\nso I don't really have like a filter\nwhen it comes league and the thing is\nthat I'll just say like whatever comes\nto mind\nand it's kind of like given me this I\nguess view within the community that I'm\njust like this like really crazed guy\nlike uh\nmost of my Clips right that get the most\namount of views are the ones where they\nmake fun of me being the most mentally\nstable League player because the\nperception is I'm the most like monthly\nunstable one\nand and what what kind of stuff gives\nthem that perception like I'm I'm having\ntrouble imagining um\nso\na few days ago I had a guy who was like\nplaying really badly in my games\nso I said that if given the option from\nGod between saving 5.5 billion people or\njust making it so that this guy never\nhad access to the internet again he\nwould never cost me game again right so\nit's just things like that so very\nextreme stuff yeah exactly and as you're\nsaying this Dantes are you noticing\nemotions arise within you\nlike what kind like are you feeling\nanything right now\nuh\nmaybe a bit of like nervousness I guess\nbut besides sad not really did you feel\nnervous like five minutes ago\num I mean whenever I'm so like that's\nthe thing about me so now that I'm in a\nnew setting talking to like a new person\nor in this case like interacting with a\nnew Shimmer who has a new community I\nalways feel like a little bit nervous\nbecause I'm not really like a super\noutgoing guy\num but once I start to feel comfortable\nthat's when I start to like open up more\nand feel like a lot better right so I\nwas like the minutes go by I feel like\nless and less nervous but at the\nbeginning it was just like a little okay\nyeah because I I think that you know\nand you're okay with being whatever like\nwhat would you call it a a schizo site\nyeah okay look so that's okay with you\nright\nyes but okay I'll explain it it's\nbecause\nmy dad told me this one thing many years\nago\nwhere he said Dantes at the end of the\nday people will forget what you say\nthey'll forgot the things you talk about\nthey'll forget the promises you make\nthey'll forget everything but they'll\nnever forget how you make them feel so\nthat's why it's just one of those things\nwhere I don't necessarily care what my\nview is in the scene so long as I can\nmake people laugh because I realize at\nthe end of the day being an Entertainer\nthe number one thing that I have to do\nor the number one like obligation that I\nhave is in my community to entertain so\nthat's why like one of the biggest\nthings that I got a lot of traction for\nuh when I was like a very small Shimmer\nwas that in the game I play there are\nthese like three foot tall characters\nalmost like dwarves and I would always\ntalk about how I wanted to like\nimpregnate or sleep with them so\nwhen I started talking about that people\nstarted like being like Oh you know like\nthat's crazy but then it's funny because\nover time lots and less people remember\nthem they just remember the more like\nrelevant things so you're able to make\npeople off while also realizing that\nwhatever view they're gonna have of you\nas long as your content is continually\nprogressing that view is always ever\nchanging and ever shifting as well\nokay\nso I'm getting the sense that a lot of\nthings that you say have a\nI don't get the sense that you're like\nout of control\nand that you're like because you seem to\nme is a super kind of like\ngenuine positive guy loves your family\npauses Family Guy so your dad doesn't\nmiss a joke\nabout makes friends with kids in Grenada\nwho don't have shoes\nso that's the thing is um\nSo what had happened actually is when I\nwas a very small streamer think like\nmaybe 22 up until I was about 100\nviewers I always was very toxic on shim\nand there was this point about I think\nit was two years ago now where I was\ne-dating this girl online\nfor about five months and after five\nmonths she decided to break up with me\nand one of the reasons why she did was\nbecause she said that she felt like the\nway I act online isn't really who I am\nand she was like I don't know why you\npretend to be this like tough guy why\nyou always like well make threats or\nlike say all these things when that\nisn't you and after she had told me that\nthat's when I started to really take a\nstep back and realize that\nI was acting in a way that wasn't really\nme and ever since then I've always tried\nto like stick true to I guess like who I\nam\nokay\nand can you tell me a little bit more\nabout dating and relationships if you're\ncomfortable talking about that yeah\nyeah\num so my first ever okay so in high\nschool I didn't even so much as like\nkiss a girl right\num I had my first kiss when I think I\nwas\n18 or like 19 something like that and\nthe first actual relationship that I had\nwas three years ago with a catfish so at\nthe time my name was Stono and this\nperson came to my chat tier three sub\nchanged their name to do Anella and\npretend to be a girl so I would get in\ncalls with them for like six seven hours\na day\num we would like message each other for\nlike hours and hours a day and\nthen I realized after a month of it\nhappening that it was like a dude with a\nvoice changer\nso that was a bit shitty because I was\nlike supposed to flout and everything I\ntook like the next semester off as well\nit's like like uh take time off to like\ngo and visit that person\nuh because it was like this weird\nsituation where they were giving me a\nlot of money and they also had this\nother person that was corroborating\neverything they were saying so I thought\nit was real but then I found out later\nthat that other person corroborating\neverything was just them on the second\naccount and like when we'd get in\nDiscord calls us three of us it would be\nlike them with two Pusher talk headsets\nlike talking has two different people\nholy [ __ ] that's sophisticated yeah so\nthat was three years ago and then two\nyears ago how did you figure that out\num so it's because I was supposed to\nleave to go uh visit them in early\nSeptember\nand in late August my mom said okay look\nI don't mind if you go but I need to\nlike know what's happening because I\ndon't like if anything ever happens to I\nneed to know like who to contact so she\nwas asking for like phones parents names\nparents phones company names like\neverything that could possibly be I\nguess like tied down with this person\nand then since she was like a cop at the\ntime she was able to like verify a few\nthings so she called me like one day\nafter I gave her all the information and\nshe said the phone numbers are burner\nphones the addresses are houses for sale\nthe names don't exist right the\napartment they said the pre-op never\nheard of them so after that I entered\nthis kind of like depressive cycle or\ndepressive Arc I guess for a few months\nbecause at the time no one in the\ncommunity really liked me and I didn't\nreally have any friends so then I felt\nlike the one thing that I did have which\nwas this girl I didn't have this either\nanymore so it just made me very down for\nlike many many months until I reapplied\nto go back into school\nuh in November and then when I got\naccepted I felt like okay nice like\nI actually have like my future gun so it\nI'm to my mood up a bit and then it was\na lot better for me what were you what\nwas it like to talk to someone for like\nsix or seven hours a day\nso\nit just felt like there was someone that\nwas there that you could always like\nshare things with you know and the thing\nis that\nI share a lot of the the ways I feel or\nlike the ideas I'll have with my stream\nbut having like an individual person\nwhere you sit there and like you share\nthings with them and then they share\nthings with you and you have this like\nMutual exchange it's a different kind of\nfeeling\nso it felt nice and it felt like I was\ncomforting\num so that was cool\nso I I'm getting the sense that you know\nreally authentic connections are very\nimportant to you\nyes\nyeah so like that's the thing about me\nis that\nnowadays I'm the kind of guy\num where I could be talking to someone\nfor like three months right and if\nthey'll tell me a single lie I'll block\nthem the next day and never look back so\nbecause it's just one of those things\nwhere\nI just can't stand dishonesty like\ndishonesty is just one of the things\nwhere\nI've been lied to so many times in the\npast by so many different people and\nhave had my hopes up so many times that\nnow I'm just at a point where if I\nidentify even like a single red flag or\nanything like that I'm just willing to\nimmediately suffer the connection\nbecause I know it's not worth pursuing\nhow do you know it's not worth pursuing\nwell because if it was worth pursuing\nthey wouldn't feel the need to lie\nbecause they value I guess me having an\naccurate view of things over me having a\nperfect view of them\nso if they lie to me it just shows that\nthey're completely self-interested\nin whatever they're doing and because of\nthat I just realized that it's not worth\nit\nI think for a second yeah\nso so you're saying that it's you'd much\nrather people be authentic and flawed\nthan perfect and dishonest\nyeah because I'm just it's just like the\nwhole dishonest thing is really overdone\nfor me because so like my first ever\nintroduction with any kind of like\nrelationship was the catfish and then\nafter that it was um\na few talking stages I had that ended\nbecause again like just like lying about\na bunch of things and then there was the\nnext person that I dated which was two\nyears ago who was like the person I\ndated for a few months and then with her\nlike I was very willing to give anything\nand after like five or six months I\nrealized that she never really viewed\nher with the same seriousness that I did\nso then that was like more months like\nthat was I guess like what he said and\nthen after that it was more of things\nwhere it's like you know you talk to a\ngirl for a month and then you realize a\nmonth and oh she has five different\nDiscord accounts where she's appearing\noffline on the one she's talking to on\nto go online on the other one until like\nfive different guys the same thing she's\ntelling you right so then there was like\nthat and then my relationship last year\nwas like the nail in the coffin for me\nwhere I'd go out and cheated on because\nI had like introduced this girl to like\nmy family like my\nparents grandparents everyone and then\nafter she cheated on me that's when I\njust said all right I'm not doing any\nonline ever again so then that's when I\njust kind of like stopped at the whole\num talking stages online and since then\nI've just been kind of like completely\nfocused on like the grind and like I\ndon't I haven't really had like a person\nthat will sit there and talk to for\nhours a day since my ex\nlike\nI mean it sucks but it is what it is\nbecause at the end of the day the amount\nof growth that I was able to make and\nthe amount of like\nthe way I was able to I guess get to a\npoint now where I can entertain more\npeople and brighten more people's days\nand also become a better player it's\nworth the trade-off that I'm losing by\ntalking to people that aren't authentic\nauthentic to begin with\nthat's one hell of a silver lining\nyeah\ndo you do that a lot\nI tried to why\nbecause I mean I realize that you can\nnever really control like the things\nthat happen to you\num like right now I forgot where they're\nbusting through my window right and chop\nmy head off with an ax right like\nthere's all I can really do about that\nbut the cool thing is that I can\nI guess change how I react to it you\nknow so that's why it's just like a nice\nthing that when you're able to control I\nguess like how you react to different\nsituations you can maximize the amounts\nof\nI got stuff that you can learn or ways\nthat you can grow from it\neven if the situation itself is bad\nokay because I've noticed this thing\nwith like League streamers especially\nwhere there would be like League\nshimmers right who they used to be a\nvery high rank and then after years of\nsitting there and blaming others for\ntheir mistakes nowadays they're a lower\nRank and the only person that suffers\nfor it is done because they'll sit there\nand now they'll have like lower viewer\naccounts however lower rank they'll have\na lower I guess way of people viewing\nthem in the scene so that's one of the\nreasons as well why when it comes to\nLeague I try to take as much\naccountability as possible with my games\nand my performances because it's when I\ntake complete accountability for my\nsituation in life that I feel like I've\nbeen able to progress the most and when\nI get in these like victim mentalities\nwhere I feel like people are out to get\nme or like\noh you know this guy's playing bad that\nguy's playing bad and all that stuff\nthen my streams suffer my gameplay\nsuffers my rank suffers right so that's\nwhy I always try to keep myself as\nat the end day I'm the only one I could\ncontrol so because of that I always try\nto I guess control how I react every\nsituation\ncontrol seems very important to you yeah\nextremely I like I've never even gotten\nlike\nI've gotten I guess like kind of drunk\nbut never to the point that I like lose\ncontrol of my actions I've never done\ndrugs or anything like that either\nbecause like\ncontrol is very important to me and also\nlike self-control is very important so\nthat's why it's like losing control over\nmy body and my own actions and my own\nmind is the one thing that I would never\nwant so I stay away from all those kinds\nof substances\nwhere did you learn to fear loss of\ncontrol\nthat's a good question\num\nI guess\nI'd have to think about it more but I\nguess the one thing that I could look at\nwould be maybe like when I lived on a\nboat on the boat right occasionally the\nthing about the boat is that it's not\nlike living online it's not like if\nyou're in trouble you can just call\nsomeone or if you're in danger you can\ncall the police right when you're on a\nboat it's you against the elements and\nthere's nothing else right so when\nthere's a storm when there's some kind\nof like when there are waves are\nthreatening to capsize your boat and\nthese kinds of things it really is that\nlike\nyou can die and you can like\nlike you can suffer right like it's not\njust like there are safety nets right so\nmaybe that was the first time that I\nencountered like an issue with control\nwhere it's like you can't really control\nthe elements outside and the elements\nwill impact you\num\nI guess that's the only thing that I\ncould really think of though because\nwhen you were do you remember storms on\nthe boat\num yeah most of the time I would sleep\nthrough them uh but I remember that\nthere were times that like my mom would\nget me and my brother in the like\ncockpit and we would have to like we\nwould pray right uh while my dad was out\nthere like searing and so there were\nlike a few times it was very very like\nserious stuff\nand so\nwas that scary for you\num not really because I've always had\nthis\nI mean I don't think it's about you but\nI've always kind of like found myself as\nimmortal\nuh because it's just one of those things\nwhere let's say I die tomorrow right I\nwon't be conscious of the fact that I'm\ndead therefore for every second that I'm\nalive I am alive so I am always Immortal\nin my Consciousness right so it's one of\nthose things where\nsince I'm always Immortal I've never\nreally I guess like feared anything like\nthat because it was just one of those\nthings where I mean I'll live anyways\nokay so I want to point something out to\nyou yeah like where did you learn how to\nfear loss of control and you're like\nwell we could die on a boat and I was\nlike what was it like to almost die on a\nboat and you're like eh I'm okay with it\nyeah so that doesn't line up to me does\nthat make sense\nno I get that I mean it's I guess so\nthat's why it's\nbecause I've been fearing loss of\ncontrol for a very very long time now\nand I I don't I don't know like where it\nwas when I was younger where was your\nloss of control when you were younger\nyeah yeah okay we're gonna yeah I don't\nthink it's the boat right because like\nprobably that scares normal people like\ndying but does it scare you\nright\nso when did you start getting worried\nabout control like how old were you when\nyou remembered were you like so it\nsounds like you weren't scared of it on\nthe boat\nwell actually okay so there was this one\nthing so back then me and my so my\nparents would always watch shows with me\nand my brother right and some other\nshows would cover like mature I guess\ncontent\num so one of the shows that we watched\nwas the unit\nand it was a show about like I guess\nthese military guys that would\num that would go overseas and like fight\nand then it would also show like the\nmilitary wives back home\nand I remember that one of the military\nwives was a cheater\nand it always made me very like paranoid\nwhere\nat that point I was like I was always\nthinking like is my mom cheating right\nand\nthere was this one time where uh I\nremember that she because she would\nalways do like yoga and stuff like that\nand at one point she had one into her\nroom with like the yoga instructor to\npractice meditations\nand I remember grabbing a knife and then\ntelling my mom that I was gonna like cut\nmyself if she didn't open the door\nbecause I wanted to make sure she wasn't\ncheating and then I just like cut my\nthumb but it hurt really bad so I never\ndid it again\nhow do you understand that\nwhat do you mean\nhow do you understand what the hell that\nwas\nunderstand what exactly\nlet me think about how to answer that\nquestion okay\nso you're\nanalytical your introspective yeah what\ndo you think was going on with you in\nthat moment\nwell I guess I thought that I didn't\nhave any control over opening the door\nsince it was locked so I did have\ncontrol over the fact that maybe I could\npressure my mom into opening the door if\nI threaten my own well-being\nokay\nso yeah you were engaging in behaviors\nto\nexert control\nyeah\nhow old were you when this happened\nfive or six\nso pre-boat post vote uh this was during\nthe boat during the boat okay\nand how did your how did your mom\nrespond\nI don't even think she realized so what\nhappened was she didn't open the door\nand then I was just there and I was like\noh that could actually really hurt so\nthen I got a Band-Aid\nand do you know what happened to your\nfear\num I mean\nthe fear of what of someone cheating or\nlike stuff like that I mean it's always\nbeen there yeah it's always been there\nokay\nyeah so like after that it's always been\nand that's like again one of the reasons\nwhy I always feel like I have to\ncontinually improve because it's one of\nthose things where if you are always\ncontinually improving then people I\nguess don't have a reason to leave or to\nfind others because you are the best\noption right like let's say you're\nyou're rank one you know\num then why would they leave you for\nRank 10 you know\nand I guess this is the insecurity\nbecause I think the first thing that you\nsaid is something about insecurity yep\ncan you tell me a little bit about that\nyeah I mean I've always been like a\nreally insecure guy\num just because it is one of those\nthings where\nuh being younger right so it's like when\nyou're a one viewer streamer right you\ndon't really have anyone that wants\ninteract interacts with you when you're\nBrawn Stone monster interact with you\nwhen you're overweight people don't\nreally want to interact with you\nand it's not because of who you are but\nbecause of like the characteristics that\nyou show show right like the surface\nlevel characteristics\nso\nthe thing about me is that then when I\nmanaged to propel myself in every sense\nand I started to realize that oh now\npeople want to interact with me when I\nhave 100 viewers or when I'm diamond or\nwhen my physique is getting better then\nthey're not really interacting with me\nfor me they're interacting with me for\nthose characteristics right\nand how how do you feel about that\nI mean I guess like to a certain extent\nit's like\nyou can't really blame most people for\nbeing shallow right because it's just\nlike how people I guess are\num all you can really do is try to find\nthe ones that are genuine even though\nit's like a small percentage but they're\nstill around and then when you do find\nthose ones then you keep them close\nokay\nhow's this uh talk going for you\nit's going low I mean okay I like\ntalking about myself so it's fun I I\nlove listening to you dontass thanks I\nthink you're just an amazing human being\num\nis it okay that I said that\nI\nyeah I mean it's just one of those\nthings where I don't like thinking that\nI'm like an amazing person or I think\nthat because at the end of the day I do\nstill have like flaws and things like\nthat and I do still have things I need\nto work on so\nthat's why uh whenever like people will\ngive me compliments all the time I'll\njust say oh I could be better you know\nlike people will tell me like oh you're\nentertaining and I could be like oh I\ncould be more entertaining people say oh\nyou're handsome I say oh I could be\nbetter you know like oh you're muscular\nI could be bigger right you're high low\nI could be High real\nokay\ndo you want to be less insecure\nI don't know\nbecause so the problem is that\nmy insecurity is part of the reason why\nI feel like I have to grind as hard as I\ndo yeah and the issue is that if I lose\nthat insecurity then would I also lose\nthat fire that forces me\nto push myself\nso that's why it's one of those things\nwhere if finding out how I would be able\nto be more insecure or less insecure\nwould be good for me so I could unlock\nit later down the line but as things are\nright now with everything going as well\nas it is for like my career and things\nlike that\nit's almost like I'd rather keep that\ntrade because it is like\npretty essential for why even got to\nwhere I am to begin with\nyeah I've never heard about anyone\nunlocking insecurity is like a positive\nTalent trait or something like that you\nknow yeah I mean it's like the video\ngame thing right where it's like you\nunlock the tree but then let's say you\nneed to spend 300 gold to actually use\nit well just spend that 200 gold like\ntwo years from now right but at least\nhaving that option will always be there\ncan I think for a second yeah sure\nI've written a lot\nso I'm gonna just try to\nyou said something about\nit's not quite Revenge when people\nso like people didn't give you the time\nof day right they didn't like care about\nyou and didn't give you respect or\nattention and then as you became more\nsuccessful you started to get attention\nand then I I got this you said something\nlike it's not quite Revenge\nyeah um can you help me understand that\nconcept\nyeah so it's just one of those things\nwhere\num imagine there's a person who sits\nthere and he only interacts with me\nbecause of my pure account right\nthen by me not I guess developing an\ninterpersonal relationship with him that\nis my revenge because I realize that I'm\nonly a what to him not a who so instead\nof spending my time developing I guess\nthat fake relationship I instead spend\nmy time pushing myself further and\nfurther and further\nand it just gets to a point where that\nperson never like\nthey're never I guess like gratified for\ntrying to put on this front like they're\ninterested\nhow do you feel about that\nI don't mind it because it's just one of\nthose things where\num\nlike in life you're gonna have very few\nlike real friends right like people who\nwill actually care most of the time it's\njust people who are acquaintances or who\nwill view you as like something that\nthey could benefit from so for example\nright\num let's say you have a friend group and\nin this fun group there are 10 people\nI'm not say two people actually really\nview you as like a person as a friend\nand they really care there could be one\nguy that calls himself for your friend\nbut he only likes to keep you around\nbecause you make him laugh right and\nyour comedic relief for him there could\nbe another guy that only keeps you\naround because you have access like a\ncar and you're able to like bring in\nplaces another guy could only keep you\naround because like for whatever other\nreason right maybe it's because you have\naccess to Big Social Circle and the fact\nthat he could be exposed to bigger\nSocial Circle just by being around you\nis something that interests him right so\nin any like I guess like big group\nsetting you'll only really ever have a\nfew people that genuinely truly care and\nthe rest is just kind of like the view\nas a tool right so I guess my revenge is\nnot making myself a tool that can be\nused if that makes sense\nso how how do you feel when you do that\nwhen I do it when I don't like when you\ndon't let people take advantage of you\nand you\nyou leave those [ __ ] behind like you\nleave them back in bronze League yeah so\nI mean it's just one of those things\nright it doesn't really make me feel\nanything because\nit's almost like let's say you're the\nmain character and they're just like an\nNPC that's like waving at you and\nthey're like hey you know like please\nstop my house is on fire but you're\nthere and you're doing the main quest so\nyou're like you know I don't care if\nyour house burns I'm chilling right\nsuddenly just leave them and you're\ndoing your own thing right you're not\ngoing to think back on the NPC you're\njust gonna be like it was an NPC so it's\nthe same kind of thing where it's like\npeople who only ever view me as a tool\nit's just like all right well I mean\njust kind of leave it behind never look\nback kind of thing how do you know they\nview you as a tool\num\nand\nbecause so the way that I analyze my own\nway of acting and my own way of being I\napply that same introspection when it\ncomes to any kind of like interaction or\nany relationship or thing like that and\nthat's one of the reasons why I'm able\nto avoid so many bad interactions is\nbecause I can sit there and identify\nevery single little thing whether it be\na tonality in a person's voice a thing\nthat they'll say a way that they'll try\nto Broach something or even just like a\nway that the post and word or certain\nthing right because I've always been a\nvery firm believer that the language\nthat people use will give away how they\ntruly feel right so that was one of the\nways I was able to actually realize that\nmy last two relationships weren't going\nto work out was because a few weeks\nbefore they ended\num the the girls that I was dating they\nwould start saying I me instead of us we\nso just picking up on these little like\nnuances I was able to like really\nunderstand like okay so now in their\nmind they don't view us as a pair it's\njust us it's just me and me on one side\nand them on another right so picking up\non all these little things are just ways\nI'm able to like I guess sift through\nall of these things\nmakes a lot of sense\nor do you is it is it your belief\nperception experience that kind of the\nrules of Life are fixed\nnot necessarily okay because I think\nyeah go ahead yeah so I mean I think\nthere are always exceptions to the role\nand that's the reason why\num\nI actually I guess love my own story so\nmuch was\nwhen I was younger I would always read\nbooks right I'd always read these like\nfantasy novels about these like little\nthese little like boys I would grow up\nin these like Villages and then they\nwould end up growing up to be the like\nuh the king of the place or like the guy\nwho would save the day right and the\ncool thing about me is that I feel like\nI was able to kind of emulate the\nprotagonists I used to read about\nbecause in every kind of facet of my\nlife I would always have to start out\nfrom the bottom and just through like\nwork dedication and drive I would be\nable to bring my way to the top\nso that's why it's one of those things\nwhere if the rules of Life were fixed\nthen how could I have done that I'm not\nsure to say that if you're dedicated and\nmotivated enough for something then\nyou'll be able to always succeed right\nokay\nwhat do you think about me\nabout you yeah\nyou pay attention to tone\nyou know voice I mean I think what's\ngoing on between us I think you're\nintrigued\num I don't think that you're putting on\nlike a facade that you find me\ninteresting I think that there are like\nthings about me that uh you do like\ngenuinely find it interesting and it's\nlike\nI guess not like a normal talk because I\nfeel like a lot of people that you do\ntalk to they don't really have these\nkind of understandings so you help them\nget to that understanding but then since\nI've already like reached most of these\nit kind of like brings on a new layer\nfor you\nokay yeah\nand and our\nare you interested in help\nokay so the thing so the reason why I\nkind of like reach out right was because\nthere will be some nights like last\nnight for example where I'll sit there\nand I'll do a 12 hour stream and\neverything will go good right\num I'll have no issues nothing will\nhappen but then I'll just kind of end\nthe stream and I'll just stare at my\nwall and I'll feel empty and there's\njust like nothing there and I won't want\nto talk to anyone I won't want to like\nengage with anyone and then I'll just\nlike go to bed and that's actually what\nit feels it's felt like\num for the majority of the time so I'll\nend my stream for years now you know\nwhere it's just like end stream and then\ninstead of like going out and meeting up\nwith friends right or doing all these\nthings I'll just kind of sit there think\nand like listen to music or stare at my\nlike ceiling around my wall right\nso I guess just\nI I don't know why it happens\num I don't know like what it is like\nthat feeling of being emptiness I'm not\nsure if it's like something that is\nbecause of all these insecurities and\nit's just like this stream is just like\na distraction or if it's just one of\nthose things where being able to share\nso many experiences with so many\nthousands of people that now that it's\nover it feels like I'm empty compared to\nwhere I was just a few minutes prior\nbut\nit's never really like a good feeling to\nhave you know\nso you described an experience that you\nhave with stream after stream I asked\nyou if you want some kind of help I'm\nnot sure that those are so do you want\nhelp with that\nyeah just yeah so it's one of those\nthings where I guess just that feeling\nof like emptiness and finding ways to\nnot feel that emptiness and to still\nlike\nbecause even when I'll like let's say\nI'm out with friends right or something\nlike that I'll always feel like okay\nwell being out with friends is cool but\nI could be grinding right and I'm never\nable to actually live in the moment I'm\nalways kind of like\nthinking what else I could be doing or\nwhat I should be doing in the future and\nit kind of like limits my I guess\nenjoyment\num from a lot of things so finding a way\nto I guess counteract that would be like\npretty good\nOkay so\ncan I think for a second\nsure\nI feel like I'm in a challenger level\ngame I've been dropped into a\nChallenger level conversation\nI have to I have to pause and pretend\nI've got some sort of keyboard\nmalfunction so I can figure out\nyeah what moves I want to make on the\nmap when we unpause\nI'll figure it out as a compliment\n[Laughter]\num\nI think your camera just got a little\nbit blurry if there's anything you can\ndo about that but\nyeah\nokay\nso you're not able to really live fully\nin the moment still a little bit blurry\nif you can try to the hand swipe I know\nit's kind of thing it's just okay\num yeah there we go I think that's\nbetter\nI don't know\nwhatever okay all right it's not\nimportant\num\nokay let me let me try to understand I'm\ngonna just like kind of think out loud\nokay yeah\nso it's not great to stream for 12 hours\nand be empty at the end\nyep\nat the same time streaming for 12 hours\neven if it causes Emptiness is worth it\nwell it's just one of those things where\nthe the problem is is that my mind works\nin a way where I'll always think what I\nwhat could have gone better right so\nI'll sit there on auction for 12 hours\nand I'll think like you know I won 20\ngames today but I could have won 21. and\njust the fact that I could have won that\n21st game and I didn't will leave this\nlike permanent burning like Mark in my\nmind that I should have won that 21st\ngame and I just didn't and I'm not able\nto actually enjoy the fact that I won\nthe other 20 because that 21st was bad\nokay\nyeah so like there have been times in my\nlife where I'll stream and I'll plan on\nstreaming for like 10 hours and then\nI'll just stream for 17 hours because\nyou know I can't end on a loss and the\nfact that I've just lost like six games\nin a row would mean that the shim ended\non a bad note and I can't allow for it\nright\nuh\nokay\nI'm still hearing that that surprised\nyou're okay paying\nright\nit is but it's just one of those things\nwhere I don't think it's necessary so\nsomething to be optimized yeah yeah so\nit's like it's just one of those things\nwhere\nlike being able to identify that things\ncould have gone better is like a good\nthing and I'll always have that but I\njust say to find a way to make it so\nthat it doesn't I guess impact the\nentire rest of the day and the entire\nrest of the time that I'm awake the fact\nthat that could have gone better like if\nI could find a way to just identify it\nbut not allow it to completely overtake\nme to the point where I feel like I'm in\nthis emotional Whirlpool where\neverything went bad then that's what I\nwould need what are the emotions in the\nemotional whirlpool\nso okay so what will happen\num is that when things are going like a\nbit better like let's say I'm\noverthinking\nthe problem is that I get to the point\nwhere I'll think and then I'll think\nabout the thoughts I'm having and then\nI'll think about the thoughts of the\nthoughts and all these kinds of things\nuntil it gets to a point where it feels\nlike my mind is my head is literally\nspinning and\nthat sometimes lasts for like 20 minutes\nsometimes like hours and it'll just like\nbe that way until I decide to go to bed\nokay\nokay\nthank you for sharing that yeah\nokay\nso\nthen the other thing is that you have\ndifficulty being present when you're\nwith your friends\nuh friends family things like that in\ngeneral yeah and what keeps it makes it\nhard oh because you're thinking about\nhow you could be grinding or or yeah so\nI mean it's just one of those things as\nwell where the thing about being like a\nlive streamer is that it's different\nfrom being a YouTuber right because if\nyou're a YouTuber you just upload\nyou could set that record for five hours\nhave content for the next five days and\nthen for four days you'll be chilling\nand it doesn't really matter right but\nalso live streamer\nfor every hour that you're not live\nsomeone else's life for every hour that\nyou're not engaging with your community\nsomeone else is engaging with your\ncommunity so it's just one of those\nthings where in order to I guess like be\nthe best streamer that's one of the\nreasons why the people that are the best\nthey're the people who swim for us many\nhours as they do because they're always\nable to I guess like\num hardness that connection with their\naudience always able to like build upon\nit and all that kind of stuff\nokay\num and do you have any kind of\nexperience or opinion with religion or\nspirituality\nuh\nI mean okay so\ncan I stand up and walk around for this\nyeah sure nice okay so\num my mom was always like really\nspiritual right and the thing is that uh\nshe would always like talk to me about\nlike religion when I was younger we\nwould always do prayers but I would\nnever really like go to church or any of\nthese things right\num\nand one of the crazy things right I\nguess like the most notable experience\nI've had with spirituality was this one\ntime two years ago uh before the girl\nthat I was like dating online broke up\nwith me I had started seeing the number\n222 everywhere and at this time I was\nlike trying to find a way to come into\nthe scene as like much as I possibly\ncould\nand what happened was is I would start\nseeing this number everywhere and I\nsearched it up and it meant good things\nuh to come right so then what happened\nwas is I just kept streaming as I\nnormally did and I started like hyping\non my shims on Twitter because I was\ndoing this like new thing and in the\nspan of a month my viewer count went\nfrom like two to like 800. so ever since\nthen right every time I see the number\n222 it always precedes good events like\nthe other time that it happened was um\nlast year uh because\nwhat happened to me it wasn't\nnecessarily just that I had gotten\ncheated on it was because I'd also had\nuh heart issues and those heart issues\nhad almost like killed me so\nit was one of those things where I had\nto like come to terms with my mortality\nand then also had to deal with the fact\nI was getting cheated on that left me\nlike in a really bad State and my viewer\naccounts went from anywhere from about\nlike a thousand to like 1300 to about\nlike five to six hundred\nand that's when I thought about like\ngoing back to school and I thought about\nlike oh well I probably have to like\nre-enroll\nand then I started saying the number two\nto two again I went to Europe and then\nwhile in Europe I was able to spike my\nrear count from like 600 to like\nthousands and it like revived My Stream\nso that's why it's just one of those\nthings where\n222 is just like one of those numbers or\nwhen I see it I I always feel like that\nconnection with it and also because my\nbirth date is also like 222 because it's\nthe February 2nd February 2nd of 2002.\nall right so how do you like how does\nthat work\nso I like look at a viewer accounts of\nlet's say a shimmer and I'll see two two\nor I'll go outside I'll see the price of\nsomething 222 or I'll sit there I'll\nlook at a license plate two to two or\njust like it'll be like literally\neverywhere or I'll be playing my game\nright and then I'll look at my end game\nuh like timer and it'll be two two and\nthe result even this one time uh\nsometime recently where I had done this\nstream and the stream had had ended at\nexactly like two hours 22 minutes you\nknow so just always sing this like\nsequence of numbers\nyeah yeah so it's just like stuff like\nthat so so do you have a sense of like\nhow that works like in the universe\nlike is that like God or is that like is\nit some weird so when I was younger uh\naround 16 I used to always browse 4chan\nyeah and when I was like browse Fortune\num one of the uh boards that I would go\non was the Paranormal one so they had\nrecommended this one book called The\ncabalian which kind of talks about the\nthe the the seven Like rules of the\nuniverse right and one of the things I\ntalked about the universe was that when\nyou're dreaming you create a universe\nwithin your mind right and the teaching\nof the cabalian was that what we are\nactually experiencing the universe that\nwe are in it's not actually like a\nphysical universe so much as it is this\nmental creation of a greater being so\nbecause of that we're all living in this\nlike mental state which means that if\nyou will something into existence enough\nyou are able to have it since you aren't\nliving in a physical place but rather a\nmental place right so that's why it's\nsomething that I've always kind of\napplied to my own life as well with like\nmy grinds and it's one of the reasons as\nwell I don't think anything is\nimpossible right because if you're\nwilling to bullet into existence enough\nand you're willing to work hard enough\nfor it right then how can you not create\nit when\neverything is mental\nsure\nI I've had a very similar experience in\nconclusion\noh yeah yeah\num but thank you for sharing that I I\nthink it helps me\nput some things into context\nyeah\num\nso let me just toss some stuff at you\nokay and and let me know\num\nwhere to begin\nokay yeah\nso I'm noticing that there there's so so\nI'm noticing that you're you have to\nmake a lot of kind of trade-offs earlier\nwe talked about sacrifice maybe it's not\nreally a sacrifice but what I'm sort of\nnoticing is that when you put a talent\npoint in one part of the skill tree\nyou're not putting it in a different\npart of the skill tree yeah exactly\nright so there's like I mean everything\nthat I'm hearing about your life is very\nlike opportunity costs so for example\nwe're gonna grind in our 20s right I'm\ngonna spend 12 hours a day streaming\nmost days of the week so that I can have\nfreedom in my 30s that's the price right\nand it's one of those things as well\nwhere another reason why I further feel\nlike\num I guess\nuh that like that claim is a real thing\nis because when I was 16 I always told\nmyself you know I might not look good\nnow but if I work out every day then I\nknow that by the time I'm like 20 21\nI'll look good you know and when I was a\nsmaller streamer I said you know like\neven though my streams might have three\nviewers now if I grind it every day and\nI give my all for this then there will\ncome a day where it pays off right\nso it's just one of those things where\nyou know you have those like momentary\nthings where you are doing those things\nevery day and then you're down the line\nyou look back and you're like oh all\nthose infinitely small progressions that\nyou made actually ended up in the this\nbig progression right do you want your\nlife to be different Dantes\num\nI mean I think right now it's in a very\ngood State like I don't really have any\ncomplaints at all with my career uh my\nfamily life I think is good\num the only thing I guess I would say\nwould be I guess being able to like\ntrust again would be a good thing but\nthen it's one of those things where you\nknow if you trust someone and then you\nget [ __ ] on Fred well GG you know\nbecause the problem is that it's it's\none of those things where I have like a\nI feel like I have a greater\nresponsibility for myself not only\nbecause of myself but also my audience\nright it's like if I get involved with\nsomeone that isn't good for me mentally\nthen the issue is that not only do I\nhave to suffer but then if my behavior\nis worse on stream now and I have a\nlower energy than all the people who\nwould look to me to I guess like\nbrighten their days now they suffer as a\nresult because of the actions of this\none person so that's like another thing\nwhere it's like why would I give anyone\nthat opportunity right\nokay\nso\num any questions for me\nuh I'm just going to show you how to say\nand then after that what would you what\nwould you like me to talk about like is\nthere something in particular that\nyou're curious about my thoughts on\nuh\nwhat's your view on me\ngreat give me a second I'll give you an\nidea\nokay so I'm gonna try to I I can I I'd\nlike permission to take\ntwo cracks at that answer\nso what I'm gonna do I think is I'm\ngonna kind of just dump a lot of stuff\nout okay and then in that process\nit'll get kind of organized and then I\nmay pull out the iPad and then I may\ndump it at you again all right perfect\nis that cool yeah\nyou're welcome to interrupt at any point\num if anything I say makes you\nuncomfortable or you're like hey I\nactually don't want to talk about this\nit may be very hard for you to interrupt\nme but please interrupt me can I yeah I\nmean yeah sure\nit's not fine if it's not fine\nno that's always fun\nthat's a problem\nokay no it's it's not always fine that's\nwhat needs to change\ntldr\nokay\nokay\nso first thing is I noticed that like\nyou touch your hair a lot\nyeah\nwhat's up with that\njust because like\nI don't like when it looks bad so I want\nit to look good so I always have to\nreadjust it so it looks good because I\njust CBA using like hair products you're\nwhat uh icba CBA means I can't be asked\nso I like I can't be asked us using hair\nproducts because it's too much like\neffort so instead I just like we'll do\nthat why is it important that your hair\nlook good\nI don't know just because I don't want\nto look like bad and what's the\nconsequence of looking bad\nI don't know maybe people think I'm ugly\nokay\nso here's the challenge okay what are\nyou feeling right now as I point this\nout to you putting you under a micro\nmicroscope\nI feel okay with it I like being\nanalyzed\nthat I understand I know you're okay\nwith it close your eyes\nwhat are the things you detect within\nyou\nthe things I detect within me yeah\nokay you know when you're like drawing\nlike a thing and then you have the\nskeleton uh-huh\nit's like right now I view my skeleton\nbut the little like particle in my\nstomach is flashing really brightly okay\nI don't know why is that a good feeling\nor bad feeling\nit's okay I mean not subsiding like not\ngood okay good so open your eyes let's\nget back into it so here's what I'm\nhearing somewhere along the way you\nrealized that\nyou will be judged\nyep\nthe other thing is that being judged\nfirst impressions are like really\nimportant right\nlike very very important what you\ndisplay is very very important because\n[ __ ] is temporary yep best friends for\ntwo weeks and then on to something else\nexactly so like\nyou gotta knock it out of the park like\nthe first five minutes of the game that\nyou play every interaction like at the\nbeginning everything is super important\nyep and you've been on the receiving end\nof people like treating you like crap\nbecause of what you look like or\nwhatever right\nwell it was never so much that I was\ntreated like crap so much as it was I\nwas never given the time of day\nright so\nI think that's people didn't give you\nattention like they ignored you like you\nweren't worth spending time on\nyep right\nand and so like\nat some point you were like [ __ ] that\nthat ain't I'm not gonna be that anymore\nI'm gonna be the king\nright like ain't no one I'm never gonna\nhave to lie about my weight again like\nwhat's gonna happen is you had to lie\nabout your weight to avoid\nbeing made fun of and feeling\nembarrassed and it's not even clear that\nsomeone was even gonna make fun of you\nbut what you're gonna do is you're gonna\nyou're gonna some next time someone\n[ __ ] asks you you're gonna tell them\nwhat your weight is it's gonna be the\ntruth and they're gonna shut the [ __ ] up\nthey're gonna understand who's\nChallenger league and who's bronze\nLeague\nright yeah it's going to be completely\nauthentic it's going to be completely\ncorrect and ain't no one gonna complain\nabout you and as you've succeeded as\nyou've grown as you've grinded and\nsacrificed did you really sacrifice who\nthe [ __ ] knows because maybe you didn't\nsacrifice it's all it's all good right\nit's a it's a trade it's opportunity\ncost all that kind of stuff so as you've\ngotten better and better and better\nyou started people are like oh Dantes oh\nmy God you're so great bruh talk to me\ngive me attention and you're like uh\nperfect\nI'm moving past yeah\nyou [ __ ]\nwhen I was streaming and I had two\nviewers where the [ __ ] were you and now\nthat I'm big now you want to be my\nfriend\nit's not and I I don't get the sense\nthat you have any malice right you don't\nactually it wish any ill on that person\nbut it's like yeah\nright and even uh you could say that I\ncould fall into that because it's not\nlike I was talking to you like two years\nago or whatever right like here we are\nnow like now that you're big like now\nwe're gonna talk to Dr K yeah right so\nso this is this is interesting right\nbecause this is how life works\nit's about the performance you put on\nthere's a very tiered system of like the\npeople who deserve respect and the\npeople who don't deserve respect and\nyou're you're damned if you're ever\ngoing to be at the bottom\nso [ __ ] that right we're gonna like\nwe're gonna grind to the top we're gonna\nbe we're gonna be someone once we we'll\nget into the whole control and fear of\nuncertainty and crap like that hopefully\nin a second I don't know how I'm gonna\nget there but we'll get there so this is\nlike the first thing okay\nhow does that sound to you\nyeah it sounds I would say pretty\naccurate yeah okay\nis that a problem\nI don't think so okay\nso I think it could be a problem\nand here's the reason why okay so I I\nthink that\nso you're trying to perform\nright like like it's very important that\nyou project the right thing and\nauthenticity is really important to you\nbut I just want to kind of like point\nout a different perspective so I think\npart of the reason that people could lie\nto you is because\nI don't know if this is going to make\nsense you may disagree with it but I'm\ngonna just invite you to be\njust consider it is that because like\nthey do really care about you right so\nlet's say someone has an authentic\nrelationship and you equate lying to you\nas\nan inauthenticity in the relationship\ncan I interject first yeah please okay\nso\nthe problem is that I do agree with you\nso the the issue is right let's say I\ntell someone I've been lied to very many\ntimes right\nand they understand this and then\nthey're gonna sit there and they care\nabout me so much that they want to have\nwhat's Best in mind for me but they know\nthat I'll view them differently if they\ntell me the truth about something so\nthen they lie right in that case the\nperson is prioritizing their that\nthey're prioritizing me having a good\nview of them over the truth of the\nsituation which shows that it comes out\nof a place of self-interest so them\ncaring about me is only because they're\nself-interested to begin with because if\nthey truly did care of them they'd\nunderstand that me not wanting to\ninteract with them anymore because of\nthe truth is something that is at my\ndiscretion\nso I'm I'm with you I think that's a\nvery valid set of rules right that's the\nset of rules I think the key thing that\nthat I think it's very\nhope I'm I think it's important but I'm\nI'm gonna make a pitch to you that it's\nimportant is that based on the\nexperiences that people have in life\nthey come up with their own set of rules\nand you were very clear that like these\nare this is the way that I interpret\nsomeone's Behavior based on\nmy strategic thinking\nthe key thing that I think\nthere are things that I think you're\ndoing that may not be optimal and and\none is like so I get that honesty is\nimportant I'm not saying that you should\ntolerate lying or anything like that but\nmy point is that\neveryone has a different set of rules\nright and those are the truths of their\nlife because those are the experiences\nthat they grew up with and there may be\npeople who for example like I've worked\nwith patients that whose parents have\nlied to them about having terminal\ncancer\nand the kid is like I've had patients\nwho are like I know something is wrong\ntell me what's wrong and the kid is\nseven and the parents are like no\nnothing is wrong no nothing is wrong no\nnothing is wrong and I don't think that\nthose parents were lying\nout of self-interest I think they were\nlying Out of Love Is it a mistake in\nsome ways is it does it cause problems\nabsolutely that's why they're my patient\nto begin with that's what I ended up as\nmy patient so I'm not saying it's the\nright thing to do I'm saying that\nI think that some of the conclusion so\nthe conclusions that you have are based\non your experiences and your\nperspectives on life yep\nother people\ncan lie for all kinds of reasons it\ndoesn't necessarily mean what it means\nfor you does that make sense yeah now\nhere's the reason that I'm even bringing\nit up in the first place\nyou want a family one day yep sounds\nlike 30 years old presumably there's a\npartner involved yeah\num and when we think about that partner\nI think that there's a very real chance\nthat because\nit's like strike one and you're out\nright it's not three strikes in your out\nnot with Dantes and so the problem is\nthat like what you're doing is you're\nyou're cutting out you know 100 of the\npopulation\nin terms of finding a partner because no\none's perfect\nwell I understand not being perfect but\nit's just one of those things where\nso here's the problem\nis that when someone does you wrong\nokay\nI understand I don't I know you know\nthat no one's perfect yep the problem is\nthat I think what could be health and\nthat's why I'm stumbling to find it is\nthat hearing the other person's\nperspective\ncould be a step that will help you a lot\nin the wrong long run\nbecause what's going on is you're making\na judgment and you're forming a\nconclusion and then you're asking on\nthat I'm not hearing\nthat there's space for the other person\nto explain or Justify or even correct\nwell it's one of those things where\nokay so when I have a connection with\nsomeone right think of it like there's\nthis line that's tethered between me and\nthem right\nand that's a line of let's say pure\nintention right where it's like there's\na sign it's pure intention and it's\nmutually like bound okay\nand the second that that person will do\nanything that line gets severed and I I\nwouldn't have any I guess like problems\ninteracting with that person again right\nor hearing them out or whatever it might\nbe but that line could never be repaired\nwhy not\nbecause it's just one of those things\nwhere maybe it's just because where I'm\nin my career or it might it might just\nbe that but I view it as a thing where\neventually right you'll find someone who\nwon't do that and right now my priority\nshould be on like my career my focus all\nthat kind of stuff that giving someone a\nsecond chance why would I even bother\nwith it when I don't even kind of like\nprioritize that at the moment sure sure\nsure so if you decide that hey like I'm\nnot interested in relationship I'm not\nI'm not saying you should give people\nSecond Chances because of that what I'm\nsaying is that you're playing a game of\nLeague of Legends where\none death equals your whatever the base\nis gone right okay because you're like\nthat like one like there's no respawning\nand so what's happening is you're\nplaying a game where like\nthe second a single person on your team\ndies you lose the game it's like\nthis connection is severed can you hear\nme out for something though yeah of\ncourse okay so let's say we sit there\nand we say that like okay how many\nacquaintances versus friends would you\nsay you have like acquaintances versus\nlike real friends just a percentage\nprobably point one percent of okay\nperfect perfect that's all I need to\nknow so you would say 0.1 percent of\nyour acquaintances are real friends\ncorrect yes okay so or even less or even\nless okay you're just saying it better\nyeah I know so it's one of those things\nwhere then I would ask you I would say\nokay\nif I were to apply that same kind of\nthinking to relationships now right\nwhere people who would have genuine\ncapacity to care and genuine capacity to\nlike do all these things they're a part\nof such a minuscule percentage right\nthat even though 99 of them might not\nfill that criteria that 99 would just be\nthose fake friends right and what I'd be\nlooking for would be that point one\npoint zero one percent where it is\nactually genuine because I wouldn't want\nto waste my time would that make sense\nhere it makes sense yeah\nso there's an important question\nthat you need to ask me\nyep which is how does someone become a\nfriend\nI guess you're like talking with you\nengaging with you\num\nbut so why did someone become a friend\nright so so if you think about like\nthe relationships so so I think a big\npart of that is that you're assuming\nthat there's a there's an assumption\nbaked in there whereas in my experience\na big part of becoming a true friend is\nfrequently having disagreements and then\nrepairing them\nyes but I think that\nI think that there's a difference\nbetween having a disagreement and\nsomething like lying about a serious\nthing right yeah you're right yeah so\nit's like it's one of those things right\nwhere like\num\nimagine that a girl tells me like you\nknow\nI really like goat cheese and I hate\ngoat cheese I'm not going to look at\nthat girl and be like well you're dead\nto me now I never want to talk to you\nagain right but it's one of those things\nwhere it's like I think lying is just I\nthink lying is at the same level as\ncheating in the sense of like dishonesty\nand like let's get okay so I'm I'm with\nyou I'm not disagreeing with anything\nyou're saying so now the question is why\nis lying at the same level as cheating\nbecause in both of those things that\nperson is pro putting themselves as a\npriority over I guess the Union as a\nwhole\ncould you envision scenarios in which\nlying benefits the Union as opposed to\nthe individual\nI would but on the\nsee I mean\nI could because imagine yeah but\nso I guess then I would rephrase and\nwhat I would say is it has to do with\nlike the person would be willing to put\nyou before them\nrather than the union so I'm curious\nDantes if we continue talking about this\nwhere do you think we would end up\nany idea\nwith a solution\nI don't think so I think this is uh this\nis a dead end conversation I'll explain\nto you why in a second okay so we can\nabsolutely have it\nso what I want next thing we're going to\ntalk about is how cognitive you are\nyeah right so you approach everything\ncognitively and so you're trying to\nfigure out like I can debate logic with\nyou all day long yeah but one of the\nthings that I kind of want to point out\nto you I don't know if this is going to\nmake sense I'm not trying to engage with\nyou logically I'm just making an\nobservation I'm not trying to trap you\nbut\nso like\none thing that a lot of people don't\nknow is that the logic of your mind is\nactually controlled by your emotions\nokay so what I've noticed I'm not sure I\ncould be wrong is that sometimes I'll\nask you questions about kind of how you\nfeel and I'll get very like cognitive\nanswers like you'll tell me a story that\nillustrates the feeling but sometimes\nyou're really confused\nand so for example like why is lying so\nimportant to you has nothing to do I\nmean not nothing that is the way that\nyou're Cog so when you have an emotion\nyour cognition will\ninterpret it if that makes sense like\nour emotions are like radio signals that\nthen get translated into words but the\nsignal in the word is different does\nthat make sense yeah so I guess like my\nanswer then would be like why is lying\nso important to me is because I think a\nlie would put me in danger right or in\npotential danger and then I would just\nwant to escape that situation because\neven though I might not come to bodily\nharm right if my career down the line is\nlike future harm by it then that is like\na harm to me so as a result I feel\nthat's like a dangerous situation yeah\nabsolutely and that makes perfect sense\nso I think this is why lying is is like\none and done for you I'm not talking\nabout goat cheese okay good example\nright so I I see what you're saying\nthere yeah but I I think it's like let's\nbe honest why are you terrified and will\nhave no second chances for people lying\nto you in relationships it's because you\ngot [ __ ] catfished it's because\npeople have lied to you over and over\nand over again and boy have you gotten\nburned burned burned burned burned yeah\nright it's like hey let's five five man\nall down mid let's go this is the\nwinning strategy no you're not going to\ndo that anymore it's [ __ ] dumb we've\ndone we've played that game before it's\ngonna lead to losing it's gonna lead to\nall this kinds of [ __ ] it's just bad\nmakes perfect sense\nstill it's problematic\nin my opinion this is my I'm and I'm not\nthe speaker of Truth by the way no of\ncourse yeah so so I I think here's what\nI'm sort of hearing is it's kind of like\nit's traumatic\ndoes that make sense yeah and I think a\nbig part of of what you're struggling\nwith so like I'll I'll go into something\nelse\nso you've figured out this strategy of\nlife which is like I'm gonna be a Chad\nI'm gonna be the best right and as you\nbecome more and closer and closer to the\nbest like how do you feel about yourself\nlike I could be better\nso what do you think about that like so\nwhy be best in the first place\nI think that becoming the best isn't\nsomething that you can never truly\nachieve so much as it is and mentality\nthat you're in\nit has nothing to do with my question\nwhy become best in the first place\nbecause it gives you purpose\nwhat's the point to purpose\ngives you a reason\nto look forward to something and what\nare you looking forward to\nsomething that only you can control\nwhich is things that you grind for\nokay so I'm not hearing happiness I'm\nnot hearing contentment I'm not hearing\npeace I'm not hearing going to bed every\nnight and feeling full of joy I'm not\nhearing\nbeing able to be present I know you want\nthose things\nbut I think you're right with everything\nthat you've said\nso it's giving you a reason to wake up\nit's giving you the capacity for control\nand what does control give you gives you\nsecurity if you have security it gives\nyou freedom and if you have security no\none's going to get to hurt you yes you\nare invincible\nand so your whole life is about the\navoidance of hurt\nwhat do you think about that\ntell me how I'm wrong\nI don't think you're wrong I think that\nit's I think that for somebody that\nwants to become one of the greatest of\nwhat he does\nit's I'm entirely that you almost have\nto Foster for at least a few years\num so you can actually pursue everything\nfully yes you're a hundred percent right\nand you're completely missing the point\nand sorry for being so condescending no\nno\nbecause why become the best right so I I\nget that that's the mental so this is\nwhat's happening like I'm talking to you\nabout this over here I'm like bro\ntheir jungler keeps on ganking top\nand you're like [ __ ] sit in the\njungle and you're like hey I'm like\ngrinding creeps because I need my item\nI'm like no no look over here and you're\nlike no no I'm with you you're 100 right\neverything you're saying is 100 right\nthat there is a strategy to become\nsuccessful and number one in life you\nhave figured it out you are devoting\nyourself to it and you are [ __ ]\ncrushing it my bro\nright thank you yeah and\nthat's not the game that I'm talking\nabout\nbecause as you become more successful\nwhat happens to the emptiness within you\nwhen you stop playing\nyour numbers have gone up to 800\nthousands\nwhat happens to the emptiness\nstays stays\nnow you have this assumption that at\nsome point you're going to circle around\na family right\nyeah\ngotta be careful there I've worked with\na lot of people that 20s become 30s\nbecome 40s I don't think you're one of\nthose people I think you're going to\ncircle around to it I really do okay\nsomething about you is a little bit\ndifferent\nat the same time do you see kind of what\nI'm saying because when you're never\ngoing to be the best but you're chasing\nthe best and why are you chasing the\nbest because it gives you a reason to\nget up in the morning why do you want to\nbe the best because you don't want to\n[ __ ] be the fat kid anymore\nyou're like tired of people like\ntreating you like not treating you like\n[ __ ] because they didn't treat treating\nyou like you don't exist\nyeah\nand it's also a thing as well though\nwhere it isn't necessarily only from a\nplace of I guess like uh disliking what\nI once was so much so as it is also that\nyou know growing up with the I guess\nlike having a lot of my role models be\nthose like Book characters the fact that\nnow I can push myself every day to a\npoint where it's like\nI look in the mirror and I look like the\nthe mental image that I used to conjure\nin my mind when I'd read these stories\nright like\nit's I guess a good feeling for me yeah\nyou know so so I think it's it there's\ndefinitely a lot of positive stuff right\nbut I I'm still like\nno matter how swole you look and no\nmatter how sexy you are in your tank top\nyou're still adjusting your hair right\nwhen is it enough\nyeah no lots of things so it's one of\nthose things where even though I might\nlook the way I do I don't think I look\ngood right like I'll sit here so that's\nmy [ __ ] point right so you're living\na strategy where you are succeeding\neverything that you want but it's not\nactually helping you feel better about\nyourself yes\nthat's what do you think about that\nis what it is\ndo you want it to be different\nwell\nwould it be possible if it's one of\nthose things where\nif I'd only have to deal with that\nemptiness right for like a few years and\nthen I'd be able to have I guess like\nthe future life that I Envision then\nit's worth it\nif that's one hell of an if yeah and\nhere's my experience you don't have to\nwait until you're 30 to start feeling\nfulfilled today because the problem is\nthat the strategies that you're engaging\nin aren't actually moving the needle\nright you've become swole but you still\nlook at yourself in the mirror and it's\nnot enough\nyeah right like logically\nyou've made progress you've made a ton\nof progress you were in the top one\npercent of fat kids in the way that they\nlook\nTen Years Later\ntop point one percent\nand does it do anything\nI I think it does does something to your\nself-esteem right like you feel good\nlike you you like like a piece of it\nyou're like yeah\nwell\nyeah I mean it gives me less to\ncriticize but I mean I could be leaner I\ncould be bigger right\nyeah right so so it gives you less to\ncriticize and that's kind of what I'm\nsaying is that like\nI'm not hearing fulfillment\nI'm hearing less things to criticize\nabout\nbut is there a difference between\nhappiness and fulfillment\nare you happy\nwell no but that's what I'm trying to\nget at right like let's say like would\nit be possible that even having all\nthese things that I can push for\nfulfillment and all that stuff without\nnecessarily feeling happy but I would\nstill be\nbecause I think that fulfillment is the\nsense that you can work towards\nsomething every day and say today I work\ntowards that and even if you have\ncriticisms those criticisms will leave\nyou unhappy but it won't necessarily\nleave you unfulfilled are you fulfilled\nokay\nI don't know maybe maybe if I hit rank\non Korea we'll see okay so like I'm not\ndisagreeing with anything that you're\nsaying but this it doesn't [ __ ]\nmatter if there's a different you're\nright there is a difference between\nthose two things you're 100 right deeply\nspiritual dude you're like it's great\nyou're you're doing awesome by the way\num we'll get to all that\nI'm not disputing but the question is\nare is that the issue that you face\num I mean the issue is just like the\nemptiness yeah yeah so it's like here\nyou are and this is what I mean about\nthe cognitive Reliance you're like\n[ __ ] talking to me about the\nphilosophy of happiness and familiar you\nabsolutely got a point there but that's\nI mean\nlike that's not what you're dealing with\ntoday yeah\nright and and I get that you're planning\nfor the future and you want to figure\nout how happiness and fulfillment works\nso that you can if once you figure it\nout right once we answer all these\nquestions then you're going to figure\nout your plan you're gonna figure out\nyour 10-year plan you're gonna do this\nyou can do this you're gonna do this\nyou're gonna end up happy right because\nonce you so I think those are all useful\nstuff you are by far one of the most\ninteresting people I've talked to\nbecause\nyou're like\nit's like you're so good at League of\nLegends but you're not playing with a\nmouse like you're using just the\nkeyboard it's really bizarre that's the\nbest analogy that I've got there's just\nwhole like this is just a dimension of\nstuff that you're not even touching and\nyet you're doing so good\nyeah I don't know if that makes any\nsense\nI I mean I can kind of say I guess\nyou're saying that you're only living\nlife kind of like half the way you\nshould be but it's almost like you're\ndoubling where you would normally be\nright yeah so what I'm saying is that\neven though you're making lots of\nprogress and there's lots of good stuff\nhappening you're not actually moving the\nneedle very much at the things that you\nwant to\nthere is a dimension of things that you\nwant to move which you're not touching\nat all and you have the assumption that\nif You Get Swole you will like the way\nthat you when you see yourself in the\nmirror you're gonna like it\nand there is absolutely an objective\nlevel an intellectual level of\nsatisfaction\nyeah but there is something within you\nthat is hungry which no matter how many\nreps you do at the gym how many [ __ ]\nprotein shakes you you make what's\nhappening to that hunger\nthat's always there\nso will wraps at the gym logic Chad make\nthe hunger go away no\ntwo viewers 800 viewers thousands of\nviewers bronze silver gold diamond\nplatinum whatever the [ __ ] Challenger\nare you good enough\nno\ncan you take a couple years off yet\nno what has to happen before you can\ntake a couple years off\nyou have to feel secure\nand yet all of your progress does not\nincrease your security\nyeah\nso let's understand\nhow to increase your security with me so\nfar wanna tell me to go [ __ ] myself no\nno am I am I missing something here oh\ndid I misunderstand you\nno not at all okay because I mean you\ncan say that is this okay that I'm\nsaying this stuff to you yeah no I mean\nlike I'm complete so that's one of the\nthings is that um one of the things that\nactually made me I was a group of League\nplayer as I am is I'm willing to put I\nguess like my ego aside and really like\nunderstand outside views to be able to\nfurther make myself better than I am\nbecause if I get criticized right\ninstead of initially having this like\nemotional reaction and said I'll take\nthe criticism and I'll say I can use\nthat criticism to upgrade myself right\nyeah so we're gonna have to get rid of\nthat too okay all right could you just\ncome inside to your bathroom yeah go for\nit\nokay I think I think I got something for\nyou okay Dantes give me just one second\nwe're gonna start with a couple of\nexamples okay so I'm gonna try to I\ngotta figure out I'm gonna screen share\nwith you\nokay\nso bear with me bro uh okay so that's\nthere there's beautiful Dantes okay all\nright so Dante's here's the thing yep\nokay so what I'm you've made tons of\nprogress right so there's hunger\nhunger fuels ambition\nambition fuels effort\neffort fuels progress\nyes progress gives you the idea\nof future security\nyep now if we're going to be fair\nthere's some\nreal security already right\nthere's also like some amount of like\nPride\nright yeah like you can feel good like\nyou can feel like authentically I don't\nthink you've got low self-esteem does\nthat make sense\nuh no I wouldn't say this either right\nbut what it is is it's like in your mind\nokay\nhere is your esteem\nwhich is pretty much healthy but I don't\nknow if this is going to make much sense\nthere's some corner of it\nthat no matter like how much this grows\nthere's like some Corner that kind of\nstays the same\ndoes that represent your experience yeah\nokay so like you can you can keep on\nmaking this [ __ ] bigger and this is what\nwe sort of mean about progress but this\nstuff kind of stays the same\nso what we're talking about is like how\ndo you make this go away and by\nextension once you figure out how to\nmake this go away you will also figure\nout how to do this\nwhich is create like whatever the [ __ ]\nfulfillment means\nthis emptiness and stuff like that this\nis going to be filled does this make\nsense yeah but the key thing to\nunderstand is that this process\nand this process are separate\nand we can agree on that\nyou can logically argue with me later\nbut just as it understandable enough to\nwhere you can presume my hypotheses yeah\nokay so what we're going to talk about\nis how to fix this okay\nso\nrule number one\nemotional\nwounds\nrequire\nemotional healing\ndoes this make sense to you\nit makes sense to me okay so if we kind\nof think about\nso where did the hunger come from where\ndid the insecurity about your appearance\ncome from\num I guess it would just come from like\nthe feelings that I would get when\nI wouldn't necessarily get noticed or\nnot even just that but then also when I\nwould start to make progress and I would\nsee good reactions then that would also\nadd on to it as well beautiful so that's\nweird right okay so it's weird because\nwhen you make progress how do you feel\nabout the way that you look\nthe same it's weird right so okay let's\nunderstand this so you grew up here is\nI'm trying to figure out how to do this\ncompassionately here's you as a factor\nyou don't have to be compassion it's\nfine yes I do no it's shell I don't mind\nthat's the problem we're gonna get to\nthat okay\nright so so I understand that you don't\nfeel hurt by it but you were getting\nhurt by it\nyeah okay so here's you as a fat kid so\nfat kid learns what\nappearances\nequals worth\nright\nyes now here's the question\nwhen you become\nthis is my attempt at muscles\nyou've got these muscles right\nand everyone's like oh Dantes oh my God\nwhat does this do does this reinforce\nthis idea\nyeah absolutely so do you see nothing is\nchanging\nYep this is why like you can get as well\nas you want to you can get more muscles\nright you can get a bigger dick whatever\ndoesn't matter\nbut more and more muscles actually goes\nto reinforce this idea\nyeah\nso where does this come from this comes\nfrom judgment around your appearance now\nhere's the reason people get stuck in\nthis because what do you think\nwhat do you think heals this wound do\nyou have any idea\nI guess being shown that you do have\nworth apart from your appearance\nabsofucking lutely\nright so appearance\ndoes not equal worth\nthat your worth is intrinsic of who you\nare and that if people are judging you\nfor your appearance\nthat does not mean you're a bad person\nthat means they are a bad person see the\nthing is I understand and I completely\nagree the thing is so that I don't think\nit's that your appearance gives you\nworth so much so as it is that it will\ngive you worth in like some people's\neyes does that make sense yes and so\nit's not that I would necessarily be\nmyself as worthless because of the way\nthat I feel like I look so much so as it\nis that well if less people would want\nto engage with you then that's like a\nconsequence\nright that's wonderful logical stuff\nthat is completely tangential to what\nI'm trying to say okay because remember\nwhat we're talking about so remember\nwhat you just said comes from this part\nof you\nyeah it doesn't come from this part of\nyou\nyeah so what we're trying to heal is\nthis part of you and this part of you\nobviously yes that's correct you're a\nhundred percent logically correct I yeah\nthat's how the [ __ ] world is right\npeople treat you differently depending\non how you look\nright and that's just how it is but you\ncarry within you some level of hurt\nyeah and that hurt is not getting solved\nby this\neven though people treat you differently\nlike you're going to find more sponsors\nand you're going to do this and you're\ngoing to do that and people love you\nbecause your league League of Legends\nplayer who's actually swole so people\ncan watch your stream and they can\naspire to be good at League of Legends\nand swole right there's a lot of good\nstuff there I'm not disputing any of\nthat what I'm saying is that this [ __ ]\nis stuff that you carry with you\nso now the question becomes okay like\nhow do you\nfeel good again and I think you know\nthis too because it sounds like your\nparents have routinely showed you and\nthis is why I think yourself this is why\nI think it's a corner instead of the\nmajority\nis because it sounds like your parents\nwere actually very like loving and\nsupportive and even when the world\ntreated you like [ __ ] they were sort of\na pillar and believed in you yeah like\nmy dad would always tell me that wasn't\nfat I was just big boned yeah right and\ndid you believe him no okay so he's\nlying to you\nwell I'm taking you feel good okay right\nwhat do you think about that\nI mean I understand he had a good\nintention with it so it's okay\nokay hold on a second but I thought are\nwe not severing the chord with dad\nbecause he lied to you\nuh I mean like because the chord got\nsevered because of intention if his like\nif he only had pure intention and\nthere's no like malice behind it then\nit's okay right but let's remember when\nsomeone lies to you what do you assume\nabout their intention\nbut it's malicious absolutely and why do\nyou assume it's malicious but then again\nit depends on the why well because then\nthen the danger right like the danger of\neverything all that [ __ ] but my point is\nsorry for logically trapping you you can\ntell me to go [ __ ] myself but my point\nis that so this is the reason I'm\nmentioned this to you I'm not saying\nyou're wrong by the way okay so I don't\nmean to logically trap you but I realize\nthat's just what I did it's unfair of me\nthat's okay\nI don't think it's okay\nokay\nyeah\nokay so what I'm actually playing out\nbetween us is that I have a perspective\nwhich is different from yours\nand the only thing I would encourage you\nto do is if there is someone who you're\nin love with\nbecause I'm terrified that one day\nyou're gonna get in love with some fall\nin love with someone who's gonna make a\nmistake and because you're in love with\nthem\nthe thought of the hurt is going to be\nso much more when they lie to you\nyes and because the heart is so much\nmore you are going to retreat and\nprotect yourself and the more in love\nyou are with someone the less likely you\nare to give them a second chance what do\nyou think you're 100 right and that's\nwhat [ __ ] scares me because I care\nabout you my dude\nand if you find that perfect person and\nyou never give them a second chance the\nonly person you're [ __ ] is yourself\nokay that's why I'm saying this to you\ndoes that make sense\nyeah okay and I know it's gonna hurt\nlike that's the hard thing about being\nin love and having a happy family is\nthat like sometimes there's hurt\ninvolved\nokay anyway I'm getting off on tangent\nokay so let's talk about fixing your\nappearance I mean sorry fixing your\nself-worth so\nnow we there's this kind of thing okay\nso then like but now the problem is the\nmore you move down here the harder it is\nfor society to go in this direction yes\nright because more and more people like\nyou said with your [ __ ] 99.99 example\nand this is something that I see a lot\nespecially\nin men that I work with and women that I\nwork with for the men the more\nfinancially successful they become the\nharder it is to find an authentic\nrelationship does that make sense yep\nand the women that I work with for them\nit can also be the same but is more\ncommonly different which is the more\nphysically attractive they are the\nharder it is to find an authentic\nrelationship yep explain that to us\nwell because what I would think is that\na lot of the time someone would only\ndate a a girl let's say that he would\nfind attractive not necessarily but\nbecause he likes her but because he\ncould show her off you know and be like\nlook this is the person who I'm with and\nthen he feels like it would give him\nhigher value\nand as a result it wouldn't necessarily\nmatter what that person looks like so\nmuch so as it gives him a better\nregarding within Society\nabsolutely right and so when there is a\nrelationship based on appearances\nso the more your appearance is high the\nmore people will engage with you around\nyour appearance right you attract the\nshallow people yep and then the problem\nis the more people who around you there\nare who are judging you based on your\nappearances the harder it is to be\njudged on something that is not your\nappearance\nwhich is why authentic friendships are\nso rare for pretty and rich people it's\nkind of weird\nthey can also be very rare for people\nwho are less pretty and less rich but\nthere's a whole other host of problems\nfor those people as well but okay so now\nthe question is okay like what do we do\nabout this right because this strategy\nain't working\nso I got to figure out what we're going\nto do about this okay\nlet me think about this\nokay\nso here's number three\nokay you ready for this okay so here's\nyou\nswole\nthese are your quads not your scrotum\nand I guess\nokay yeah okay so here's your Grapevine\nright that's how big your muscles are\nthey're like grapes\num so\nnow I'm going to tell you something okay\nnow pay attention to your your reaction\nokay okay\num Dantes I think you are an awesome\nhuman being\nwho has been hurt a fair amount and I'm\nreally amazed and proud of what you've\nbeen able to make out of your life\nhow do you feel when I say that\nuncomfortable\nin what way\nbecause I don't like\nit's just one of those things where like\nI don't like being complimented okay why\nwhat what what happens when I compliment\nyou\nbecause it's like you're complimenting\nwhat I've become\nand I want to stay stuck in the\nmentality at the base which is I'm not\nanywhere near that\nokay so when I compliment you you say I\nam not near that\nso the first question\nwe're going to learn a couple things\nyou ready for something else\nokay\nboy are you great at League of Legends\nhow do you feel about that\nlike I make a lot of mistakes and I mean\nI feel like\nagain it's the same thing where I feel\nlike I could be better I feel like I'm\nnot nearly as good as what I should be\nokay\nnow let me ask you something which one\nmakes you more uncomfortable the first\nthing that I said or the later thing\nthat I said the first one yeah right\nokay so I'm gonna give you another one\nwow dude you really look like you're in\nshape\nokay\nhow does that make you feel\nthat's not as bad it's not as bad what's\nthe difference when I complement law or\nphysical appearance because when you say\nsomething like I'm in shape right it's\nalmost like you're making a note on my\nbody as a completely different entity\nfrom me yes but then when you say that\nyou think I'm a certain thing then the\nproblem is that then that's me and\nthat's like all the hurt that I guess I\ncarry\nbeautiful you see one of those things I\nam valuing you as a person but if I\nvalue you if I'm like oh Dantes hey man\nwe should stream sometime you are Big\nLeague of Legends streamer like let's\nstream it will be good for my numbers\nyou are so good at League of Legends you\nare so successful streamer which side is\nit on left side or right side\nright it's completely over here oh [ __ ]\nthis guy\ngets something\nfrom\nmy good attributes\nyep\nand I would say you're not even\nuncomfortable with that one iota\nthis you can [ __ ] swim in this [ __ ]\nall day long yep you're gonna be feel\nfine right how do you feel about\nyourself when I'm like oh Dantes you're\nso like good at League of Legends like\nwe should collab sometime man\nhow would you feel\nI mean it's just one of those things\nwhere I'd be able to instantly see\nthrough it and it doesn't make me\nuncomfortable you're right clout Chasers\nand those [ __ ] that you look down on\nlike then I become one of them you can\nhandle that [ __ ] all day long\nyeah because they're chasing a shallow\npart of you they're chasing your clout\nthey're not chasing this kid\nyou see that yeah now here's the problem\nwhen I say bro I think you're a great\ndude like I really do I think you're\nthere's so many things I like about you\nand it has nothing to do I I didn't I\nmean I didn't\nyou know I I I don't even know you sort\nof but I think you're a great human\nbeing but the problem is the so the more\nwe're over here the more your mind is\nokay with it but the more as we move\nthis direction I could be better and as\nI move this direction\nyou know\nlike I'm gonna try something else which\nis like gonna sound weird\nlet's try this one Dantes\nI really hope you're able to find\nhappiness in life because I think you\ndeserve it\nno I don't like that\nbecause the way that I always sit is\nthat I don't necessarily deserve\nhappiness so much I don't I don't care\nabout how you see it that's logic I'm\nsure you have a good logical reason for\nit sorry for shutting you down and\ninterrupting you how does it feel when I\nsay that\nthat's not an idea that I accept you\nreject it yeah and it's not a logical\nrejection do you see this the rejection\ncomes first then I can art I can\ndismantle your argument and what are you\ngonna do you're gonna believe me then\n[ __ ] no is the answer\nyeah and then you're gonna give me\nanother reason and you're gonna give me\nanother reason and you're gonna give me\nanother reason\nand I can try to dismantle it as long as\nI want to I can be a master debater I\ncan train with Destiny for six months\nand I can come at you bro\nand I can dismantle your arguments with\nall of the skills that I learned argue\nwith people on 4chan\nand you're going to say [ __ ] no\nyeah did I even compliment you at all\nno\nso here's the person I'm talking to\nthis is the fat kid\nand the fat kid rejects that because the\nfat kid this is not true for the fat kid\nand if that is like I don't know how to\nsay this it's not gonna make much sense\nbut\nit's such a tragedy if that was the\ntruth and the fat kid went through what\nthey went through\ndoes that make sense there's no Silver\nLining it's just like all bad\nthat if the world was a place where\nsomeone's value is actually not\ndetermined by their appearance then why\non Earth and all of that suffering is\njust like it's it's it's\nflawed that's not the way the world is\nsupposed to work and I think that's\nwhere the emptiness stems from\nhow so\nwell because everything else is kind of\njust like a distraction right but then\nwhen you don't have that distraction\nanymore then you're just confronted with\nthe reality yes if you don't yeah in\nwhat is your reality\nno the you can be better but people will\nvalue based on how much better you\nbecome right you always have things that\nyou have to work towards so your value\nin this world has nothing to do within\nhere it has to do with your performance\nyeah and as you start to perform and\nperform and perform and you give people\nwhat they want and you become this thing\nyou even have some resentment\nbecause I think you actually feel a\nlittle bit good every time you turn\nsomeone down\nbecause the fat kid wants vengeance\nmaybe maybe yeah I mean like it might be\nlike a little good feeling but it's like\nit's not done to feel good I'm with you\nso remember so now we go to this and\nthis is another key thing which I hope\nyou're picking up this part of you feels\ngood but ninety percent of you is like\nwhatever does that make sense yes\nthere's like this\nthere's like a kid inside you where\nthese feelings are coming from which is\nwhy they're so confusing because they're\nnot your whole experience it's just a\npiece of you but I mean if you tell me\nthat's where the emptiness comes from I\ndidn't really understand that but like\nif you say so\nyeah that's the answer that I want you\nto say but even I can't quite connect\nthose dots\nbut you want me to like explain it a bit\nmore then sure I've got one one or two\nmore things for you but yeah I'd love to\nhear okay so what exactly do you want me\nto like clarify then yeah what is where\nis the source of your emptiness\nso I think it's just because\num\nso it was kind of like when I was uh\naround 16 that I would also browse a lot\nof like red pill forms and stuff like\nthat and I remember that at the time I\nused to feel very very very like\nI used to feel bad because I would say\nlike oh damn I guess you can't really\nfind like an actual true genuine\nconnection because you always have to\nlike put up this pretense put up this\nlike mask always work towards maximizing\nall these things\nand\nI think it's just like when you don't\nhave that distraction like I've never\nreally gotten rid of that view\nand then it's when you don't have that\ndistraction anymore then all you really\nhave left is that view that leaves you\nfeeling empty\nbecause it's like it's almost like\nyou're chasing something\nlike my dad told me this whole one time\nright where he said nowadays people will\nbuy things they don't need with money\nthey don't have to impress people that\nthey don't even like right and it's\nalmost like you're there and you're\ngrinding every day to appear better in\nlike 99 of I guess like the\nacquaintances are going to find the eyes\nbut at the end of the day\nyou know like they don't really care\nabout you and it's like vice versa so\nwhy are you letting them dictate so much\nof your life\nwhy are you letting them dictate so much\nof your life\nbecause\nthere are there are actual like real\nworld good consequences fit right like\nif I can sit there and I can become a\nbetter player if I can become a better\nstreamer if I can become a better\nEntertainer\nright so so you're right and and so now\nwe get to another thing which is\nthe problem is right now the only fuel\nyou can put in your tank is the fuel of\ninsecurity and there are very real world\nbenefits of from the fuel of insecurity\ndoes that make sense yeah and so I\ntotally get that you're not ready to\ngive it up because you don't know how\nwhat else to put your foot in your tank\nfair enough yeah\nyeah\nokay one one last thing that I want to\nshare with you Okay so\nyou do this thing that I would call\ntoxic positivity\nthis is a judgment that I'm making\nyou're welcome to reject that judgment\nokay\nso anytime bad stuff happens to you what\ndo you do you Silver Line it\nyou use it for growth\nand the tricky thing about this is that\nthese are both these are good right like\nevery time you lose a game you can learn\nsomething from it\nand that will help you win the next game\nagreed yeah\nso this is what's really bizarre but\nthat works on like I don't even know how\nto do this that's objectively true but\nthat does not heal the emotional hurt so\nevery time you you do that you kind of\nlike suppress or let go of your emotions\nyeah can I tell you like a quote that I\nactually had yes so like something that\nI wouldn't say is that\nit's fine because it has to be fine\nbecause if it's not fine\nthen you allow it not being fine to\nimpact you but if it's always fine then\nyou can always like push forward right\nyes and so here's the last thing I'm\ngoing to leave you with\nyou are not in control of allowing\nthings to impact you\nyou fight so hard to let nothing impact\nyou because you have to be impervious\nand therein lies why you're actually not\nin control\nokay\nletting yourself be hurt\nthat's like the next level of control\nokay\nyeah I swear you're getting out\nand that's what's hard so this is why\nlike all of the success Chads\nend up learning about like yoga and\nmeditation and stoicism and all this\nkind of crap because like you have to\nthere's like there's like three levels\nokay\nand I'm gonna go to\nI'm gonna switch back to this hold on\nokay so there's like three levels\nthere's like I suck at life\nI'm insecure\nthen what happens to use that insecurity\nto fuel\nambition\nambition leads to objective success but\ndoesn't fix the insecurity then some\npeople get stuck so some people get\nstuck on phase one because they they\nhave such low self-esteem that they're\nnot able to like use that as fuel for\nProgress that's where some people get\nstuck okay the insecurity overwhelms\nthem some people channel the insecurity\nbecome to become successful those people\nget stuck because\nthey they have two choices in life I can\nbe insecure and unsuccessful or insecure\nand successful\nand\nif I give up the insecurity will I end\nup as secure and unsuccessful that's\nwhat they think is going to happen\nyou're going to slip back but that's not\nyou've never been there right that's\nactually what\nEnlightenment is\nis like when you're actually completely\nchill and the funny thing about that is\nthat The Closer you get to that the\neasier it becomes to actually work\nreally hard it becomes even easier and\nthen you actually get to have your cake\nand eat it too you can work for eight\nhours then you can say to yourself you\nknow what I actually don't need to\nstream for four more sure it would be\nbetter if I did but there are other\nthings that you're not a slave to that\nthing\nand right now you are a slave to being\nin control\nyou're a slave to being invincible\nand so that next Transcendent thing it's\ngoing to be hard and I don't think you\nneed to do it now\nit'll happen because two two\nwhen the universe wants you to it'll\nhappen in this conversation is a part of\nthat karmic path\nso I'm catching you at 21 so you don't\nhave to end up in a psychiatrist office\nat the age of 40. at that point you need\na psychiatrist\nokay okay because at that point it like\nturns into mental illness\nyeah\nand I've worked with people who are\nmillionaires\nhundreds of millions of dollars very\nsuccessful\nprioritize things like you did\nand then like\nworked 12 14 hours a day for 10 years of\ntheir life felt empty at the end of\neverything\nand then they still like you can't you\njust can't\nyeah because that's like a realization I\ncome to our I I already I said you know\nthat at the end of the day when you have\neverything that there is to have right\nlike when you have everything that money\ncan buy you realize that the only things\nthat matter are those which I can't\nyes that's brilliant\nyeah\ndo you read that somewhere you came up\nwith that [ __ ] yourself\nno it's just like in the airport and I\nwas I wanted to write it to it longer so\nthen I just put that at the end of it\nbecause it just came to mind\nand how does it feel when I say that\nthat's brilliant\nit feels good\nI mean okay to be fair though listen to\nme though that's because my intelligence\nwas always like okay you know like it\nwas never something that was super\ninsecure about\nyeah okay because because you can't you\ncan't [ __ ] take a call to be fair\nright you got to discount it even now\nyou can't just [ __ ] take it\nyeah\nright so so what I saw is something that\nwas authentic and something that I\nappreciated it's not a rank it's not\nit's like you made a good play right\nlike it doesn't mean that you're better\nor worse than anyone else it just means\nin that moment that's brilliant that's\nit by the way exactly what happened to\nthe Buddha I don't know if you know the\nstory but he's basically a king was good\nlooking had tons of money had tons of\nrespect was married to someone who I\npresume was very respected and hot or\nwhatever had a healthy kid and he's like\nwait a second I'm still not happy what\nthe hell I have everything so this is\nthe problem is that as long as you don't\nhave something your mind gives you the\nillusion to chase something and it says\nto you\nhey if you get this you'll be happy hey\nif you get this you'll be happy hey if\nyou get this you'll be happy but once\nyou hit the end of the road there's\nnowhere to go\nexcept for Within\nyeah exactly\nthat's one of the reasons as well I\nthink that it's one of those things\nwhere people who are unlike the higher\nincome end of things are more I wouldn't\nsay they're like more prone to like um\nhaving all these like mental things that\nhappen to them but when you take away\nlike Financial insecurity then the only\nthing you have left is like yourself\nright sometimes just constant\nintrospection like asking yourself\nquestions and what do you really want\nand stuff like that absolutely\nwhat sorry I was distracted for a second\nbecause I may have an appointment but\num\nI'm sorry I missed that last sentence\ncan you say it again I apologize yes I\nwas saying that um people who are on\nlike the higher income thing right like\ncelebrities and stuff even though they\nlike people who have everything that you\ncould ever want that are still prone to\nlike\num having all these like thoughts and\nstuff like that because when you take\naway the all like the financial\ninsecurity then all that's left is like\nyou as a person right and then you kind\nof like have to understand like yourself\num okay\nso uh okay sorry you're right\num sorry I'm trying to push my my next\nthing so what questions do you have any\num\nwhat do you think the next step would be\nlike for me like let's say you were to\nlook at me right and you wanted to see\nme right now\nwhat do you think that the path I'm\ngoing down is a good one what do you\nthink like I want your judgment or do\nyou think that I maybe should take a\nstep back that I should ease up or do\nyou think that these are things I should\naddress these are things that could like\nwait a while like what would you think\nokay great question so my question to\nyou is do you want the next step or you\nwant the last step\nboth\nso the last step is you need to stop\ntaking steps\nokay\njust be where you are\nstop chasing\nso here's what's going to happen when\nyou stop chasing you will be present\nbecause there's nowhere to go\nyeah when you're not going somewhere\nyou're present\nso it's going to be hard\nvery practically what this means is\nabsolutely nothing bro 222 the world\nwill let you know when it's time you\nwill feel when it's time start listening\nto yourself\nokay hey this is actually what I want to\nbe doing right now or hey like this is\nactually starting to feel like I really\ndo want to change this you can learn how\nto meditate get in touch with your\nfeelings we have this video about Alexa\nthymia which I think you should check\nout\nI'll send you a link\num but I think just more emotional\nawareness because I think what I'm\nseeing is you're just overly cognitive\nand there's this whole other dimension\nof you that I think you're aware of but\nyou don't quite engage in so you just\nneed to bump up your EQ so you need to\nlike grind that for a little while and\nget in touch with get in touch with your\nfeelings yeah okay\na couple of other things that I'm\nworried about the only thing that I'm\nworried about is if you fall in love\ndon't cut that off because they made a\nmistake\nthat's the one thing like give them a\nsecond chance\nand it doesn't mean that you have to\ngive like and the reason I say give a\nsecond chance is because I suspect that\nthey may do something which because you\nactually mentalize like what's going on\nin their head like you interpret it\nusing your set of rules like talk to\nthem get you don't have to give them a\nsecond chance but at least give them the\nchance if you really love them like if\nyou're in in love\nyou know like if you're like if you're\nlike man this is the one this is the one\nthat like 30 years when I'm 30 years old\nand I've made it and I have my kids and\nI want to take three years off this is\nthe person I really want to spend my\ntime with do yourself the favor of\nhaving a conversation and do your best\nto listen to them notice what kind of\n[ __ ] feelings you're having go talk\nto a therapist work through your\nfeelings and then make a decision do not\nbe controlled by your traumatic\nexperiences of catfishing desire for\nprotection this person hurt me I will\nnever let them hurt me again because\nthat's why you cut them off\nyeah and you're not wrong with any of\nthat that's just how you survived right\nonce we get bit by a snake our brain is\ndesigned to be like get the [ __ ] away\nfrom snakes\nyeah right I'm gonna avoid this player\nbecause this player [ __ ] feeds and I\ndon't ever want to cue with them ever\nagain\nokay you know who I'm talking about you\nknow there's some people who don't\nbelong in Challenger that you queue up\nwith or you run into your games right\nthat they don't belong there yep\n[ __ ] them\nand the real thing that I'm worried the\nonly thing that I'm really worried for\nyou about is that you're going to meet\nthe one and you're going to love the\nguys girls both none of the above are\ngirls you're going to meet her and\nyou're going to love her so much and\nit's gonna be so [ __ ] scary because\nwhen you're in love you are not in\ncontrol\nwhen you're in love you have to be\nwilling to be hurt and those are the two\nthings that you don't want to give up\nyou don't know where you're going to be\nin 30 years you don't know if it's going\nto be worth it you don't know if she's\ngoing to cheat on you you don't know if\nshe's going to break up with you you\ndon't know if she's with you because\nyou're so sexy and because you're so\ngood at League of Legends\nyou don't know why she's with you you\nknow all those [ __ ] thoughts which\nhave gotten you here and kept you alive\nand made you successful\nare now going to be working against you\nokay\nand then if you let them take control of\nyou\nyou're going to end up regretting and\nall this other kind of [ __ ] and you're\ngonna start\nhaving lots of meaningless sex and doing\nlots of drugs or whatever and then\nyou're going to wind up in my office\nso that's what I would say I think\nyou're I honestly Dantes I think you're\na good dude\nthanks I think what you've accomplished\nis amazing\nI don't think you should have done\nanything differently\nand I don't think that the life that you\nhad was fair in some ways I think it's\nunfair and I don't think just because\nyou turn it into a silver lining does\nnot mean that like it didn't suck\nthat you didn't deserve it\nyeah and it means that there's there's\nan alternate reality where there's a fat\nkid who was accepted by his peers and\nyou're not nearly as successful you're\nnot nearly as ripped but\nyou feel like you go to bed every night\nand you're happy you're one of these\npeople who plays League of Legends is\nhappy when they're done these rare\ncreatures\nyeah I understand that\ndoes that answer your question\nI think so\nyeah\nI think I think the main thing that you\nbrought up with you have to be like I\nguess in control of allowing yourself to\nnot be in control\nlike\nit does make sense\nand even though there is like a risk\nreward and it's one of those things\nwhere it's like now since I am younger\nright and I\nI guess I can prioritize like my career\nand stuff like that that maybe a little\nbit down the line I can I should also be\nopen to the idea of an alternate way of\napproaching things too absolutely so you\nknow what's at the top\nthe final unlock\nonce you max out all of the other talent\ntrees the final unlock is the power of\nsurrender\nokay\nokay\nyeah\ninteresting\nI don't know if you're you still need to\nput some points into the tree does that\nyou get what I'm saying yeah no it's\nhere going out where\nyeah because I mean to be able to\nsurrender and to be able to like really\nput yourself at the mercy of something\nelse is the ultimate form of saying like\nthat's the ultimate form of being in\ncontrol because like that's where you do\nhave no control\nso so the reason it's not the ultimate\nform of being in control it's\ntranscending the axis of control and not\ncontrol\nit's saying that\nso be it\nand if this person wants to dislike me\nthey can dislike me\nyeah\nif this person wants to judge me for\nthis they can judge me\nokay\nlet them\nand if even if they say things that hurt\nme it will hurt\nso be it I do not need the avoidance of\nhurt to be able to control my life\nso this is why when we use this term\nMoksha which is sanskrit for\nenlightenment it is translated as both\nBliss and freedom\nbecause you are happy\nwith pleasure or pain\nyou are happy with acceptance or\nrejection because it is just the way of\nthings\nit is what it is\nokay\ninteresting\nyeah I mean it makes sense like\nyeah I can stop\nI'm very very happy for you\nand I'm rooting for you\nand I'm excited for what the next 10\nyears of your life are going to bring\nyeah\nthank you yeah I mean that's the thing\nit's just like\nI mean the cool thing is that\none of the things I like doing is like\nsegmenting my life into arcs\num because it's like easier to like\ncompartmentalize them so yeah I mean I\nthink\nI think that the future has good things\ncoming so\nI think maybe we'll talk again like a\nfew months from now and then sure\nyeah if you fall in love\nand you're in that spot okay may want to\nsee a therapist but you can always DM me\nall right thank you I appreciate that\nokay take care you want to just tell\npeople where they can find you\num yeah sure so uh I mean my twitch is\njust on test so that's d-a-n-t-e-s or\neverywhere else it's just oh no so\nthat's\nd-o-a-e-n-e-l and uh for you you like\nyour Twitch or YouTube\noh it's a healthygamer underscore GG I\nthink for uh twitch and YouTube and then\nTwitter I think is like healthygamer GG\nwithout an underscore I don't even I'm\nnot quite sure but yeah all right yeah\nperfect yeah and so you play League of\nLegends for like 12 hours a day and you\ndumpster Noobs\nand so first yeah yeah okay awesome\nthank you so much for coming on and good\nluck and have a good weekend yeah thank\nyou for having me all right enjoy your\nday bye\nforeign"
