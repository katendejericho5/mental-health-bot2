    "transcript": "emotions can Bounce Around inside you\nand be really overwhelming and affect\nyou for a very long period of time\nunless you deal with them in some way so\nsometimes we deal with them by like\nunhealthy coping mechanisms like playing\nvideo games or using drugs we can also\ndo healthy things like maybe exercise or\nmeditate or journal or whatever but a\nreally important thing that we can do is\ntalk to other people about our emotions\nand when we talk to them it can help us\nfeel better but the other cool thing is\nthat we can actually improve our\nrelationships either at work or like\nfriendships or romantic Relationships by\nvocalizing our feelings the challenge is\nthat most of us are not taught how to\nvocalize our feelings how to understand\nour feelings so since we're not taught\nthat when we try to communicate our\nfeelings to other people they respond in\nways that are kind of hurtful and we\nkind of feel like this isn't really\nworking I'm burdening other people it's\nnot helping at all"
