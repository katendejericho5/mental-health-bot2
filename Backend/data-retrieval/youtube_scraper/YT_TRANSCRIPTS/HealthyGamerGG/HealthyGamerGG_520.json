    "transcript": "I recently saw a study that I thought\nwas really fascinating that people who\ndevelop very strong emotional coping\nmechanisms tend to not progress in life\nokay it's kind of weird right because\nyou think like ingrained and ingrained\nin the habit almost is it well so I\nthink what happens is if I'm in a bad\nsituation let's say I'm in an abusive\nrelationship and I get really really\ngood at coping yeah am I more likely to\nstay in the relationship or less likely\nto stay in the relationship yeah I mean\nthat that's actually a fair point than\nyeah because if you're just trying to\ncope all the time then you're just going\nto fall in almost that habit Loop and\nit's like whereas staring in the face is\nlike hey maybe you should get out of\nthis you know maybe maybe it's better\nlike yeah absolutely it's really bizarre\nI was stunned when I saw the study but\nlike there's there's really they were\ntalking about how the better you are at\ncoping the more stuck the more likely\nyou are to stay stuck"
