    "transcript": "so if you really want to understand how\nto overcome an insecurity what you need\nto do is starve it so anything that we\ngive into in the mind grows so if I'm\nfeeling insecure about my appearance and\nI text a friend of mine and I send them\na selfie and I say hey will you look at\nthis do I look okay in that moment when\nyou have an emotion what is your\nsolution to the emotion it is to engage\nin a behavior that reassures you and\nmakes the emotions go down but what\nyou're actually doing in that moment is\nfeeding the insecurity because you're\ngiving the insecurity what it wants the\ninsecurity wants reassurance it's the\nmore that we give the insecurity what it\nwants the stronger it becomes if I'm\ninsecure about my appearance and my\ninsecurity is saying hey you don't look\ngood and I say okay fine then I will\ncancel my social plans so that I don't\nhave to worry about feeling\nugly then I've just fed my insecurity\nand it will grow so anything that you\nfeed in the mind grows"
