    "transcript": "negative emotion is actually the most\npowerful source of motivation and when\nwe run away from it when we fear it when\nwe suppress it we're actually\nhamstringing ourselves in terms of our\ncapacity to like drive forward and get\nthrough other stuff because the other\nthing that we sometimes don't realize is\nthat negative emotion is the best way to\novercome other negative emotion you know\nI'm I'm socially anxious what makes me\nfinally leave the house being so lonely\nlove and compassion is not is never\ngoing to conquer social anxiety I mean\nthat's not true it can't but well what\nwill conquer anger is like what will\nconquer fear is anger and I don't think\nwe really understand that a lot of\npeople that I work with are stuck\nbetween two negative emotions and they\ntry to suppress everything instead of\nchanneling one to overcome the other"
