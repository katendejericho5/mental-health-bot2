    "transcript": "so first we've got to understand that a\npanic attack is an over activation of\nour sympathetic nervous system which is\nour like survival mechanisms so our body\nis going to be filled with adrenaline\nit's going to be filled with cortisol\nour heart rate is going to be through\nthe roof our blood pressure is going to\nbe super high our respiratory rate is\ngoing to be very high we're going to be\nbreathing very very rapidly respiration\nor breathing is a two-way street if you\nfeel a certain way it will change your\nbreathing so if I breathe like this\nthat's like an angry pattern of\nbreathing and if I keep breathing like\nthat there are actually studies that\nshow that people were sort of like\nexperimenting with this stuff and\nresearchers would Breathe that way and\nthen they would start to feel angry even\nif they weren't upset about anything so\nyour breathing can control your emotions\nso that's why we really recommend slow\ndeep breaths and actually exhalation is\nmore important than inhalation so you\nreally want to extend out that\nexhalation as much as possible"
