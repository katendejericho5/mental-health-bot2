    "transcript": "it is amazing what you can accomplish if\nyou just get a little bit of support\nright and the best analogy that I have I\ndon't know if y'all weight lift but like\nif you're doing like let's say a barbell\npress right and like you're pushing the\nthe bar and you can't push it up anymore\nyou're on that last rep how much help do\nyou need from a spotter just a little\nbit right they just need a little bit of\nhelp and then you can get positive\nmomentum and that's what I've seen with\nsuicidality so absolutely get help it is\nabout tolerating and managing your\ninternal emotional state learning how to\ndo that because right now if we think\nabout it that internal emotional state\nprevents you from actually fixing the\nproblems in your life so you have to get\nthe skills to master the self and once\nyou can do that then life becomes way\neasier and I've seen it done"
