    "transcript": "hey y'all today we're going to talk\nabout brain rot and how to fix it\nso when I was working full-time as a\npsychiatrist I noticed that people would\ncome into my office and they would be\nlike cognitively not in the best\nheadspace they would be sort of very\nlethargic they would have difficulty\nfocusing difficulty motivating\nthemselves they couldn't really find\ndirection and anything was kind of hard\nfor them to do\nso when I was working with these people\nI would develop what's called a\ndifferential diagnosis which is let's\nsee if we can figure out why there's a\nlack of focus why there's a lack of\nmotivation why there's so much lethargy\nand a lack of energy and sometimes this\nwould be due to something like a\nphysical or a mental illness and we've\ncovered that elsewhere in the channel\nincreasingly I saw more and more what's\ncalled brain fog so brain fog is like a\nneuro-inflammatory condition that causes\nlike cognitive problems so people who\nwill have really bad covid will\nsometimes have this post-covid syndrome\nthat's characterized by brain fog but\nthat was sort of a another sort of thing\nthat we've also covered elsewhere and by\nthe way apparently is one of our best\nYouTube videos so check it out if you\nthink that that could be happening with\nyou hey just a quick note a lot of\npeople will ask us what do I do next and\nthat's why we built Dr K's guide It's a\ncomprehensive resource that distills\nover 20 years of my experience both as a\nmonk and as a psychiatrist and it's\ndesigned in a way that's tailored to fit\nyour needs so if you're interested in\nbetter understanding your mind and\ntaking control of your life check out\nthe link below for the third it's sort\nof devastating thing\ntimes\ncouldn't blame brain fog and you\ncouldn't blame a mental illness and\nthese were people whose brains had just\nkind of like rotted from like engaging\nin the wrong kinds of crap for like\nyears or even decades and this is kind\nof what I call Brain rot and what I sort\nof discovered is that these were people\nwhose Minds had essentially become\nincredibly Rusty so one thing to\nunderstand is that the mind doesn't wear\nout with use it actually rusts with\ndisuse so oftentimes the people that I\nwould be working with were people who\nlike didn't have an infectious condition\nor something like that don't didn't have\nlike celiac disease but these were\npeople who were just kind of like degens\nand they had stopped using their mind in\na productive way over long periods of\ntime\nor sometimes they weren't degens and\nthey were just not controlling certain\naspects of their life where they were\npolluting their mind with sort of\nexternal negative things\nand so as I started working with these\npeople I sort of realized okay like\nmedical training isn't really going to\nhelp even like Frontier of Medical\nTraining like brain fog which is like a\nnew condition isn't really going to help\nwhat these people really need is a way\nto unrust their mind and really tune it\nup and get it back to functioning and so\nwhat I drew on is more of my yogic\ntraining because what I kind of realized\nis if you think about what a yogi is\nwhat is a yogi there's someone who\nactually overclocks their brain they're\nsomeone who understands how to use their\nmind in a very functional way and then\nthey optimize their mental function and\nonce they do that they can have all\nthese like weird Enlightenment\nexperiences and like you know have\nvisions of their past life and all this\nother weird psychedelic crap so these\nare essentially people who overclocked\ntheir brain and what these people needed\nwhat the brain rot people needed was\nessentially that is an antidote\nso we're going to start off by using an\nanalogy of what an actual infection is\nlike because I think that actually\nreally explains what happens in our mind\nso when we get a physical infection the\nfirst thing that happens is we have a\nbreakdown of a particular barrier and\nthen bacteria cross over where you're\nassuming a bacterial infection for a\nsecond so bacteria kind of cross over\nand then they invade Us in some way\nright so there's some kind of invasion\nof the mind with brain rot the second\nthing that we're going to talk about is\nonce bacteria cross the barrier then\nthey start to colonize that particular\nspace right so you can start with an\ninfection that's just one small cut but\nover time the cut will become inflamed\nit'll swell it'll spread and if you\ndon't treat it properly the bacteria\nstart gobbling up your Healthy tissue\nand start replacing it with bacterial\ncolonies and this is also what happens\nin the mind of people who have brain rot\nis certain thoughts will start to\ncolonize your mind so the experience of\npeople with brain rot is that anytime\nthey try to do something their mind\nkeeps on telling them to do something\nelse so if I'm trying to sit down and\nstudy my mind is like starting to think\nabout video games and it's like oh why\ndon't we do this or why don't we do this\nI don't want to study let's think about\nthis let's think about this so literally\nanytime you try to do something you have\nto overcome the thoughts that are in\nyour mind\nso that's colonization and the third\nthing and this is actually what's kind\nof terrifyingly devastating is\nadaptation so in an infection some of\nthe worst things that happen are not the\ninfection itself but your body's\nadaptation to the infection so in the\nmost dire circumstances when we're\ntalking about young kids like kids that\nare a year old when they get an\ninfection their immune cells\nhyperactivate so much that they will get\nfevers that will climb to 104 105 106.\nand at that point the human brain does\nnot function properly so young kids who\nget viral infections can actually have\nfebrile seizures which means that they\ntheir brain they have a seizure because\nthe temperature in their body is so high\nand why is the temperature in their body\nso high It's actually an overreaction of\nthe body themselves so half the time if\nwe're talking about things like sepsis\nand stuff like that when we're treating\ninfections we're not just treating the\ninfection we are trying to prevent a\nparticular adaptive response from the\nbody from causing more damage and this\nis exactly what we see in brain rot as\nwell when you're sort of bombarded with\nnegative thoughts and your mind is\ncolonized your mind will start to do\nthings to try to fix this and those can\nactually be more damaging\nso let's run through these three things\nin sequence let's start with infection\nso the first thing to understand is that\nin our current Society we have stopped\nfiltering our perceptions so people who\nhave brain rot are people who don't\nfilter what comes in so let's start with\na simple example of someone who wants to\nget a job so they work really hard right\nthey struggle against themselves they\novercome their anxiety and they apply\nfor a job and they end up getting\nrejected now if we really pay attention\nif we sort of think about it objectively\nlike a rejection isn't that big of a\ndeal like it's a normal part of the\nprocess generally speaking people will\nhave to get rejected from a dozen or two\ndozen or even three dozen jobs before\nfinding a job and even more for the\nright ones I personally got rejected\nfrom 120 medical schools before I got\ninto med school so rejection is actually\na normal part of life but for people who\nhave brain rot a single rejection gets\ntranslated into something else right so\nyou get one rejection and then your mind\nstarts thinking oh like there's no point\nin trying like there's no way I'm going\nto get a job right it starts to populate\nor respond with some of these thoughts\nand so we don't really pause and think a\nlittle bit about the actual factual\ninformation which is I got rejected from\na job to our reaction to it there's no\ngap between those two things the moment\nsomeone gets a rejection they\nautomatically start to believe and think\nthat there is no way that they will get\na job so we kind of see this all\nthroughout our society we also see it\nwith things like trigger warnings where\nwhat's starting to happen is instead of\nbeing able to handle information\ninternally what we're starting to see is\npeople will become increasingly avoidant\nright so what's happening is if I'm\nsocially anxious I'm not going to go to\na party so what's sort of happening is\nI'm starting to control the\ncircumstances which lead to particular\nsensory inputs but I can't control my\nreaction to those inputs\nthis is the exact opposite of what a\nyogi does so Yogi is someone who can\nrecognize that if there is sensory input\nfrom the outside that my reaction to it\nis actually something that I can control\nand if I if I can control my reaction to\nnegative things then I don't need to let\nnegative things control me so simple\nexample of this from my clinical\nexperience is like when I was working in\nthe emergency room let's say on an\novernight shift and at 2 A.M in the\nmorning someone comes in\nHigh out of their mind on like cocaine\nor methamphetamines\nand I walk in the room and the first\nthing that they tell me is how I'm a\nfascist how I'm an how I'm a\nterrible human being I'm the worst\ndoctor on the planet these are all very\nobjectively hurtful things to say\nand do I get hurt by them at the\nbeginning I did but eventually I learned\nhow to filter my perception instead of\nthose letting those words directly into\nmy mind and letting them shape my truth\nwhat I learned how to do is create a\nbarrier between those two kinds of\nthings so I'm not going to let the\ninfection sink all the way in right so\ninstead what I start to do is I start to\nrealize okay this is what this person is\nsaying let me pause for a second and\nthink about why would this person be\nsaying this do they actually have they\nthink I'm the worst doctor on the planet\nwhat do they know about my medical\nexpertise how long have they were they\nhaven't even worked with me I walked in\nand the deck was stacked against me\nright so as I start to create distance\nas I start to recreate that barrier\nbetween the outside perception\nperceptions and my reactions to those\nthings those words hurt me less and\neventually what can happen is something\nreally cool which is that you can\nactually develop positivity\nand compassion towards someone who is\ntreating you like crap which is\nliterally what you learn how to do in\nPsychiatry residency right you pause and\nyou start to think oh wow like you know\nI know we just met and I'm sorry to hear\nthat you think I'm a terrible doctor\nreally curious what you base that on but\nit sounds like you're really struggling\nright now and you really think about me\nas the enemy like I can totally\nunderstand where you're coming from\nbecause I can imagine you don't want to\nbe trapped in an emergency room right\nnow and you're restrained to the bed and\nI can get that that's really terrible\nwhat's your understanding of like what\nmy job is so if we sort of think about\nwhat we get trained as as medical\nprofessionals is not to react to what\nthings what happens to us and I've seen\nmedical students that are good at this\nand bad at this right so the medical\nstudents that are bad at this kind of\nstuff any kind of feedback will send\nthem crumbling like it'll it'll just\nmake them fall apart so even if you're\nin medical school to learn for example\nbut if in attending tells them hey like\nby the way you did this thing wrong\nit will be such a bruise to their ego\nthey're like oh my God I'm such a\nterrible medical student they don't even\nrealize that making mistakes is\nliterally your job as a medical student\nthat's why you're a student because\nyou're not supposed to know everything\nand you're in med school for four years\nbecause you're supposed to make a ton of\nmistakes and it's my job or the\nattending's job to teach you how to\ncorrect those mistakes it's not about\nbeing perfect when you step into the\nhospital for the first time it's being\ncompetent enough when you leave for the\nlast time\nso this is a huge problem that people\nfall into where if you are struggling\nwith brain rot I strongly recommend you\nthink a lot about what is the actual\nfactual truth of the situation and what\nyour reaction to it is and what you'll\nfind is that people with brain rot the\nreason they're so lethargic is because\nthey do not filter their perceptions so\nif someone if I get one Rejection it\nbecomes really really really hard to\napply again I I can't focus on it I feel\nunmotivated I'm really lethargic and\nthat's because there's no gap between\nthe actual objective world and your\nreaction to it so what you need to do is\nincrease that Gap and the way that you\ndo that is by a simple but difficult\nyogic practice which is okay what was\nactually said and what is my\ninterpretation of it and what you'll\nnotice is that in the brain rotted mind\nthere's no distance between those two\nthings and you will think that\nparticular things are true but the more\nthat you pay attention notice okay what\nis objectively correct what is by\ninterpretation or what is my conclusion\nand stretch those two things apart\nthe second thing that we're going to\ntalk about is colonization so this is\nwhere if we look at it in the mind one\nof the key ways that yogis overclock\ntheir mind is by being very careful what\ncolonizes their mind so here's how the\nmind works the sensory inputs we have\nwill determine which thoughts arise in\nour mind and like game developers\nunderstand this really really really\nwell because what do they do the three\ndays before a game releases they\nadvertise heavily they have a bunch of\nsponsored streams where streamers are\nplaying the game everyone's talking\nabout it they have teasers they have\nthis trailer they have that trailer and\nwhat why are they doing that what are\nthey doing the more sensory input that\nthey can bombard you with the more\nthoughts will arise in your head about\nthat particular thing and this is why\nhow they get people to pre-order crap\nright which pre-ordering is a terrible\nidea because we keep on pre-ordering\nhalf made games that end up being like\ndefunct at launch but like there's no it\ndoesn't cost the company any Financial\nit doesn't do anything because you've\nalready given the money and why do we\npre-order because our mind is so\noverpopulated with thoughts of a\nparticular game\nso this is what you have to understand\nif you have brain rot is that when you\ntry to motivate yourself towards\nsomething what you'll notice is that\nyour mind is colonized by all kinds of\nother thoughts so instead of just being\nable to do a task the task is made 10\ntimes harder because of all the random\nthoughts that crop up in your brain so\nwhen I sit down to study I can't focus\nmy mind on this because my mind is\nthinking about this particular video\ngame it's thinking about playing tears\nof the Kingdom or Diablo 4 or this\nparticular thing or this movie is going\non and my mind can be populated by other\nthings as well right so if I had a call\nlast night with my parents who are like\nmildly toxic and they're like\nmarried yet what are you doing blah blah\nblah blah blah blah blah if I let those\nthoughts into my mind they will colonize\nit and as I talk to my parents every\nsingle day and they bludgeon me then I\nhave to overcome those kinds of thoughts\nanytime I try to do something\nso the yogis are very good at preventing\ncolonization this is literally why they\nlive in caves in the Himalayas because\nwhat they sort of discovered is that if\nI want to achieve optimal brain function\nI cannot have a single distracting\nthought\nand the best place to have zero\ndistracting thoughts is literally in a\ncave in the Himalayas because in there I\nhave no sensory input I'm in a cave it's\ndark there's no noise there are no\npeople around I'm completely free from\nexternally colonizing influences\nnow what does this mean for you\nnow the real problem the real rise\nreason we're seeing a rise in brain rot\nis because our society today is very\ninvasively colonizing we have\nnotifications constantly right we have\nnotifications from Steam notifications\nfrom our apps people are texting us all\nthe time right because communication is\nnow a 24 7 thing you're getting emails\nfrom your boss all of this kind of crap\nis continually invading your mind and I\nknow this sounds very cliche\nbut this is where you've got to limit\nyour technology use and you're saying\nbut oh my God this is overwhelming I\ncan't stop using technology I'm not\nsaying stop using technology what I'm\nsaying is notice that the more you get\nbombarded by this\nthe worse off your brain rot will be and\nwe sort of see this right because when I\nwork with people with brain rot and I\nask them how do you spend your days\nthey're like I spend the whole day binge\nwatching YouTube or on Twitch or playing\nvideo games or things like that\nand this is where if you kind of think\nabout it why do you think about a\nparticular game you play five hours of\nit you watch streams of two hours of it\nwhile you're eating your food and you're\nlistening to a podcast where popular\nstreamers are talking about the game\nwhile you're cleaning up and so what are\nyou doing during all of those times\nyou're colonizing your mind with this\nstuff okay so the more that you can trim\nit down and this is where it's like it's\na scale so if you do even cut out a\nsingle one of those activities like eat\nwhile not watching streams or clean\nstuff while listening to music instead\nof listening to whatever right any\nprogress that you make will decrease the\nburden on the mind we'll reduce the the\nbacterial load in your mind and will\nmean that you have to overcome smaller\nhurdles in order to do what you need to\ndo not saying you need to go all the way\nto the Himalayas and cut out all things\nbut that's why people love doing that\ncrap by the way because if you kind of\nthink about Retreats right why are\nRetreats so restful it's because you\nintentionally cut yourself off from all\nthat kind of stuff and then your mind\ncan actually like clean itself out the\nthird thing that we got to talk about is\nthe adaptation so remember that when we\nget an infection our body will respond\nin particular ways like we'll form scar\ntissue or other things like that we have\nto somehow try to fix the damage the\nproblem is that in the process of fixing\nthe damage we can sometimes lose\nflexibility or set ourselves up for\nother problems and what does this mean\nfrom the yogic perspective this is where\nwe get to the ahamkara or the ego\nso when I don't filter my perceptions\nand when someone tells me when I'm in\nthe seventh grade and someone tells me\nI'm a loser\nthat thought sinks in right the\nseven-year-old doesn't stop and think\nabout okay hold on a second this person\nis just mean it doesn't mean that I'm a\nloser so what happens with the\nseven-year-old is the perception doesn't\nget filtered or adjusted in any way the\nperception becomes a true reaction or\nyour reaction to it becomes truth so\nthen seven-year-olds start to believe\nthat they are losers\nso what ends up happening is when you\ndon't filter your perceptions and your\nmind is over colonized by sensory crap\nyou end up adapting by forming an ego so\nyou start to have beliefs about yourself\nas a consequence of number one and\nnumber two\nso when you apply for a job and you\ndon't get it and when you apply first\nand you're like man I'm a loser I\nshouldn't apply there's no point and\nthen what do you do you struggle right\nyou work with a lot of willpower your\nbrain is very like rotted right so it's\nkind of like scoffed and it's really\nhard you can't just pick yourself up\ndust yourself off and apply again it\ntakes up two months for you to apply for\na second job and then you get rejected\nagain and then you take two more months\nand apply for a third job and then you\nget rejected again\nwhat ends up happening is you form a\nconclusion about yourself I'm lazy I'm\nundisciplined jobs just aren't for me\nthe corporate world is not for me other\npeople are successful I suck at school I\nhave ADHD you discover lots of I\nstatements\nthe second you start having I statements\nlike I am dot dot dot\nyou also your mind starts doing\nsomething else which is making\ncomparisons so then what happens is\nthere's stuff that you want to do\nbut when you think about doing it your\nmind tells you you can't do that because\nyou're not like this other person right\nyou look at other people and you say\nthat person is different from me they\ncan succeed at it but I can't these are\nall egotistical statements and so how do\nthe yogis overclock their brain they\noverclock their brain by eliminating\ncomparisons and eliminating their ego\nnow this is really hard to understand\nbut I really want you all to try because\nit's transformative\nso who are you right so who you are is\ndetermined by your actions\nso you can say that okay I'm afraid of\nheights therefore I cannot climb right\nthese are very common things something\nthat I've struggled with and still\nstruggle with\nso if we sort of think about it once you\nsay I'm afraid of heights I cannot climb\na mountain you will not climb the\nmountain this results in a lack of\nmotivation not fulfilling your dreams\nmissing out on opportunities fomo\nwhatever all that crap\nbut the problem here is that you are\nletting your identity of yourself\ndetermine what you actually do whereas\nthe real tragedy is what you do\ndetermines who you are right so if I'm\nafraid of heights and I end up climbing\na mountain anyway how do I feel about\nmyself I feel amazing I feel like wow\neven though I'm afraid of heights I am\nso awesome I'm so proud of myself that I\nwas able to conquer that and once you're\nsomeone who starts conquering your\ndeficits you become a whole different\nperson because then once you know you\ncan conquer your deficits then some you\nhave another thought in your mind which\nis I'm lazy or I'm not musically\ntalented but if you've conquered the\nfear of heights now your mind can say\nyou know what I can still learn how to\nplay an instrument even though I was\nafraid of heights I climbed at the top\nof that mountain and even if I'm not\nmusically inclined I can still do it\nso this is where we see another aspect\nreally really important aspect of the\nadaptation that results in brain rot the\nfirst is that once I determine things\nabout myself those I statements shape\nwhat I am willing to do and not willing\nto do\nand once I let those things shape my\nactions I let it determine my future and\nthis is why people who have brain rot\ndo not have control over their life what\nthey essentially do is live their life\nincredibly reactively so if something\nfrom the outside comes and demands that\nI do something like if I've got a test\non Friday then I can study but the\nsecond the test is over one Saturday\nSaturday rolls around I cannot bring\nmyself to read a book for the sake of\nlearning and then once I can't do that I\nmake conclusions about myself I am lazy\nand once I start to believe that I'm\nlazy if I try to start doing something\nin life that thought will crop up oh\nyou're lazy you can't succeed at that\ndon't bother\nand so what we see is that actually our\nego or our humko creates this idea of\nsort of like I can't do what I want to\nin life and I have to start living very\nreactively this is why people with brain\nrot cannot actually move towards a goal\ntheir life feels purposeless or\ndirectionless and you're kind of living\nfrom day to day without any sense of\nlike picking a goal and actually moving\ntowards it and as we tunnel down into\nwhy you can't move towards the goals\nit's because your mind has certain\nconclusions about you and the second\nthat your mind makes that kind of\nconclusion or makes a comparison it\ntanks your motivation and then you're\ngg'd\nso what do we do about this what we end\nup doing is beware of those two\nstatements so anytime your mind says\nanytime you feel like doing something\nright you have some kind of tiny impulse\nfor motivation what does your mind do\nsmacks it down says hey you can't do\nthat you're a loser and then you're like\noh wow okay then you don't end up doing\nit right because overcoming that\ninternal lack of self-esteem is hard\nenough on its own and then even if you\ncan do that you have so little energy\nfor the task itself\nso here's what y'all got what you got to\ndo notice that anytime your mind says I\nam dot dot dot do your best to\nabsolutely ignore it and how do you do\nthat because it's hard right because\nit's really powerful you recognize that\nthe conclusions that I have about myself\nare also based on unfiltered perceptions\nwhen I was seven years old and I sort of\nwhen someone told me was I was a loser I\nformed that belief and I carried it with\nme but it's not necessarily true\nso anytime you notice I statements try\nto actually move in the opposite\ndirection notice the statement and set\nit aside and say you know what we're\ngoing to try this even if it's destined\nto fail even if we're lazy we're gonna\ngive it a shot the second thing that you\nreally need to be careful about is\ncomparative statements so the ego is\nwhat makes you compare that's the two go\nhand in hand and this is what the Yogi's\nkind of figured out so anytime you\nnotice yourself making a comparative\nstatement what is the effect of that\ncomparison the effect of that comparison\nis to discourage you from acting notice\nthat right this person is better than me\ntherefore I should not act therefore I\nneed to remain unmotivated therefore I'm\ngoing to sit at home and then I'm just\ngoing to browse YouTube so these two\nadaptations that your mind uses\nto sort of respond to these events are\nactually what really devastates you\nat the end of the day when I work with\npeople who come in and say I'm lethargic\nI have no direction I have no motivation\nI can't focus some of these people have\nwhat I call Brain rot now this is not a\nmedical condition it's not a\nneuroinflammation it is simply a\ndeconditioning or rusting of the mind\nand in order to overcome this what we\nreally need to do is tune up our mind\nand thankfully the yogis have figured\nout how to do that and I would sort of\nsay that the core feature\nof someone who has Great Brain rot is\nthat they live their life reactively\nright so my motivation is determined by\nexternal circumstances if I've got a\ndeadline I can react to that deadline\nand I can sort of take care of it but if\nI'm living my life reactively and by the\nway hey I was doing this thing I went to\nthree classes where I was learning how\nto break dance and then my friend showed\nup for class four and it was his or her\nfirst class and they did better than me\nand it was so freaking embarrassing that\nthey are natural and I'm not a natural\nso then I give it up I never go to class\nfive\nyou are living your life reactively what\nother people do determines your\nmotivation and this is why there is a\ncomplete loss of control you're always\nreacting responding reacting responding\nyou can't pick a direction and move\ntowards it\nhow do you fix this you take the yogic\napproach of preventing infection by\nfiltering your perceptions create a gap\nbetween what your actual sensory\nperception is and what your reaction to\nit is notice that a sensory perception\nis not the same as a reality the second\nthing you need to do is control what\ncolonizes your mind and literally\nrestrict as much as you can the sensory\ninputs so what kind of sensory inputs\ncreate motivation and what kind of\nsensory mode inputs create distractions\nfrom motivation and you can start small\nyou can start as small as five minutes a\nday 15 minutes a day 30 minutes a day\none hour a day of Simply being\ncompletely unplugged go for a walk right\nor go to some sort of like\nentrepreneurship we have our Discord for\nexample as an entrepreneurship Community\ngo to a drop into like their you know\nhour-long voice calls and see what other\npeople are up to start to colonize your\nmind with positive influences in the\nthird and hardest thing to deal with is\nthe ahamgara or the ego because as a\nresult of number one and number two we\nform identities and those identities\nstart determining what we do they start\ncontrolling and shaping our actions and\nthis is really when we get truly stuck\nbecause the big irony is our actions\ndetermine who we are not the other way\naround but when we start letting our ego\ndetermine what we're capable of or not\ncapable of that's when we sort of really\nget stuck in this cycle\nso use this yogic approach of filtering\nperception\ndecolonizing your mind and paying\nattention to egotistical statements and\nyou will start to reverse brain rot\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]"
