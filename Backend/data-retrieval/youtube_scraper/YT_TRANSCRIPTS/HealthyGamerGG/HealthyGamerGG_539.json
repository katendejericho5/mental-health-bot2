    "transcript": "so here's how the mind works the sensory\ninputs we have will determine which\nthoughts arise in our mind and like game\ndevelopers understand this really really\nreally well because what do they do the\nthree days before a game releases they\nadvertise heavily they have a bunch of\nsponsored streams where streamers are\nplaying the game everyone's talking\nabout it they have teasers they have\nthis trailer they have that trailer why\nare they doing that what are they doing\nthe more sensory input that they can\nbombard you with the more thoughts will\narise in your head about that particular\nthing and this is why how they get\npeople to pre-order crap pre-ordering is\na terrible idea because we keep on\npre-ordering half-made games that end up\nbeing like defunct at launch but like\nthere's no it doesn't cost the company\nany Financial it doesn't do anything\nbecause you've already given the money\nand why do we pre-order because our mind\nis so overpopulated with thoughts of a\nparticular game"
