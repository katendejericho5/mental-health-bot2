    "transcript": "hey y'all today we're going to talk\nabout how dreams can sabotage your\nfuture\nso generally speaking we don't think\nabout wanting something or chasing\nsomething or having some kind of fantasy\nor dream is actively harmful we\ngenerally think about it as something\nthat okay like yeah I have particular\ndreams everyone has dreams that's how we\nsort of find direction right we have to\nlike move towards our fantasies or goals\nor dreams but we don't realize that for\nevery dream that we have it can actually\ncreate a cognitive strain on us and\nactually prevent us from accomplishing\nit if you're ready to take the next step\non your mental health Journey check out\nDr K's guide it's an immersive resource\nthat distills over 20 years of my\nexperience laid out in a way that is\ntailored to your needs so if you're\nready to better understand your mind and\ntake control of it check out the link in\nthe description below this is what's\nreally bizarre when we think about\ndreams we think about them as being\nnecessary for accomplishment but if\nwe're not careful the more dreams we\nhave the more stuck we will be and you\nmay have noticed that in life there are\ntwo kinds of people right there are the\ndreamers and they're the doers and so if\nwe want to understand this principle and\nhow to apply it to your life we have to\nstart with 12-step programs in addiction\nso in recovery or in overcoming an\naddiction a lot of patients will benefit\nfrom something called a 12-step program\nthe most famous one is Alcoholics\nAnonymous so they kind of give you like\n12 steps that you have to go through and\nif you work through the steps by the end\nof it you will be much much much more\nlikely to overcome your addiction\nnow this is really interesting from a\nscientific standpoint because if we sort\nof think about an addiction\nit is like literally your body or your\nbrain demanding a substance and they're\npatients that I worked with who have\ngone through things like opioid\nwithdrawal who have also had metastatic\ncancer so this is stage four cancer and\nthey have told me that opioid withdrawal\nis worse than childbirth which is really\nfreaking painful and actually worse than\nhaving stage four cancer it is so\npainful I would much rather die so if\nyou kind of think about when you're\nexperiencing that much pain as an addict\nevery fiber of your being wants relief\nevery fiber of your being wants that\nsubstance right and so somehow these\npeople are able to develop the willpower\nor strength to overcome\na complete set of signals that their\nbody is sending them that hey you're\ndying you need this you need this you\nneed this you need this and so how were\nthey able to do that and once we\nunderstand that hopefully we can harness\nit too\nso I think one of the key steps for the\n12-step process is Step nine which is\nmake amends what these people actually\ndo is over the course of their substance\nuse they've usually screwed up a lot of\nthings they've messed up relationships\nthey've like stolen money they've like\ngone through divorce they've like\nalienated their kids they've ruptured\ntheir relationship with their parents\nwho like mortgage their house and they\nend up stealing from them so they just\nhave a lot of people with addictions\njust have absolute train wrecks of lives\nbehind them\nand so this is also filled with lots of\nguilt and shame and denial and\nsuppression all kinds of crap\nso one of the really interesting things\nis what I noticed as a clinician is that\nwhen people get through step nine things\nbecome a lot easier so what they do in\nStep nine is they go and make amend so\nliterally what they do is they make a\nlist of all the people that they've\nwronged and then they will call up all\nthose people or do their best to get in\ntouch with them and own up to their\nmistakes apologize and then you know\nother people will yell at them some\npeople will thank them whatever you kind\nof have to like go through that process\nand then once you're done with that it\nfeels really liberating and then\nsobriety becomes way easier\nso what's happening in the brain how is\nit possible that apologizing to a bunch\nof people actually helps you develop the\nwillpower to resist that addiction\nso it turns out that our brain has\nsomething called a cognitive load so you\ncan kind of think about this as RAM so\nyour brain can only handle so much stuff\nat the same time and if you kind of\nthink about all these people that you've\nwronged if I ask you if you're an addict\nlet's say or I would ask my patients hey\nwho have you screwed over and they can\nimmediately the brain can come up with\nall kinds of answers I screwed up this I\nscrewed up this I screwed up this I\nscrewed up this so if you stop and think\nabout it for a second what that means is\nthat all the mistakes that these people\nhave made\nthey're actually keeping track of their\nbrain is actually has it's like these\nold days I don't know if you work with\nlike old people who use computers and\nthey have like a thousand different tabs\nopen and it really slows down their\nmachine this is literally what happens\nin an addict's mind every time they've\nwronged someone it's like one you know\nwindow of Internet Explorer is running\nin the background and taking up a little\nbit of RAM and clogging up their machine\nso anytime they try to do something or\novercome an addiction their brain is so\nlagged that they can't actually leverage\ncognitive resources to overcome the\naddiction\nso this process of Step nine is actually\ngoing back and closing off all those\nwindows\nas we close off all those windows our\nbrain no longer needs to remember it\nbecause it's checked off it's done right\nand if you stop and think about what are\nthe things that your brain remembers\nyour thing your brain will keep track of\nthings that are not complete so if you\nneed to pick up milk for example there's\nsome part of your brain that will use a\ntiny bit of ram to keep track of that\ntask and so we sort of discover from\naddiction Psychiatry is when our brain\nstarts closing off all those windows\nthat's when we increase our cognitive\nload and we can overcome the addiction\nnow what does this have to do with\ndreams and how they sabotage your future\nand this is where we kind of lean into a\nlittle bit of yogic philosophy because\nthe yogis actually discovered this as\nwell and they discovered a layer even\nBeyond cognition which is maybe like\nspiritual cognitive I mean energy or\nwhatever\nand so what they sort of discovered is\nthat every dream that you have is\nsomething that they call an incomplete\nKarma every person that you've wronged\nis an incomplete Karma so anytime you\nhave a desire even if you don't satisfy\nthat desire there is a part of your mind\nthat still wants that thing and y'all\nmay have friends or maybe you've gone\nthrough this as well where you think\nabout the one that got away right you\nfell in love in high school or maybe\nlike first year of college and you met\nthis girl and like she was amazing and\nor met this dude and he was amazing and\nthen you kind of like go through life\nand then they things didn't work out but\nthere's a part of your mind that holds\non to that right\nand so if you kind of think about as you\ngo through life how many of these\nincomplete things does your mind hold\nremember how much does it hold on to and\nthen at inconvenient moments you will\nremember them right because you sort of\nstop and think about it how is it that\nyour mind is able to remember that stuff\nit's only able to remember that stuff if\nit is keeping track subconsciously in\nsome way\nand the more incomplete karmas you have\nthe more times that you said you wanted\nto do something nice oh yeah I was\nsupposed to get that person a birthday\ncard incomplete Karma something that\nadds to your cognitive load you screwed\nsomeone over man I really should have\nsaid sorry incomplete Karma cognitive\nload weighs down your mind\nall of these tasks that we have will\nweigh down our mind as our Ram actually\nshrinks and our cognitive load is\nactually heavy our ability to actually\ncomplete tasks actually decreases right\nso this is the wild thing the more\nincomplete dreams that you have the more\nthings that you have dreamed for and\nfantasized about that you have not\nachieved your mind stores all of those\nin your RAM and the real devastating\nthing is as I have a bunch of crap over\nhere cluttering up my mind my ability to\nactually realize a dream becomes\nsabotaged because now my mind is\nburdened by all this other crap so when\nI actually try to make something out of\nmy dream\nI'm unable to because my mind is not\nfree to do so so this is kind of a\nreally interesting concept that a lot of\npeople don't realize and when I work\nwith people what I really try to help\nthem do to accomplish their dreams is to\nhelp them unburden their mind and this\nstarts with a very very simple principle\nso what I'd ask my patients to do is\ntake a list of to grab a piece of paper\nand write down all of your regrets and\nall of your dreams okay and then make a\nhuge list of stuff and then our goal\nsometimes they'd feel really scared\nbecause they're like there's no way I\ncan do all these things at this point in\nmy life there's no way that I can be an\nastronaut and you know an entrepreneur\nand this and that like I can't do all of\nthese things and they'd feel overwhelmed\nand they'd Retreat from it and they'd\nlike fall into some kind of weird you\nknow distraction like Netflix binge or\nwhatever\nso the first thing that we've got to do\nto free up our our cognitive load is to\ncheck it off or Strike It Off so if you\ntake that list try to figure out okay\nwhich of these do I actually want to do\nand which of these will never be done\nand strike it through so put a line\nthrough it if you were going to give up\non something and even that process of\ngiving up can be emotionally painful but\nwill actually free you up cognitively\nand this is exactly why people get stuck\nbecause we don't want to give up on our\ndreams we're taught to chase our dreams\nnot give up on them we don't realize\nthat chasing a Thousand Dreams sabotages\nyour ability to achieve any single one\nbut if you know what I'm talking about\nyou'll realize this is exactly what's\ngoing on in your life which that you\nwant so much that you don't even know\nwhere to get started and even when you\ntry to start even if you try to get\nstarted your mind will tell you but what\nabout all of these other things and so\nit's incredibly paralyzing so we have to\ndo is start by checking it off or\nstriking it off and each of these is\nemotionally painful which is why we\nhaven't done them right this is what you\nreally have to do if you want to free up\nthat cognitive load is start by Crossing\nthings off your list right GG noob and\nthis is where for me a big one was\nfalling in love and what I actually\ndecided to do was become celibate so I\nwas going to become a monk so I was like\nyou know what that and I grieved that\npart of myself I was like man I was\nattracted to all these ladies and like I\nwanted to get with them and like I\nwanted to be like such a alpha and I\nwanted to be like a pickup artist and I\nwanted to get laid I wanted to do all\nthis stuff and I had to cross all that\ncrap off I was like you know what not\ngonna happen in this life GG man no re\nand so I decided to become celibate and\nthe Really bizarre thing is the moment I\ndecided to become celibate it freed up\nmy mind to actually be with people so\nthen when I was talking to a girl I\nwasn't worried about getting weighed I\nwasn't worried about am I saying this\nright or saying this wrong I could\nactually just be with the person right\nbecause all the pressure is off my mind\nis free and then something really weird\nhappened women started getting super\ninterested in me and ever since I sort\nof figured that out like I didn't figure\nit out but ever since I started doing\nthat I was like wait where's all this\nfemale attention coming from this is\nreally bizarre so as I freed up my\ncognitive load and people say this about\nrelationships right they're just like\nget to know the person like don't be so\nin your head bruh or don't be so in your\nhead girl like just just get to know\njust get to know the person but we can't\ndo that because we all this crap in our\nhead\nso we got to free that cognitive load\nand Crossing things off of your list is\none way to do it now for the things that\nyou're left with right so take an hour\nto like go through that list and really\ncross off as much stuff as you can but\nif you want to hang on to a lot of it\nyou can hang on to a portion of it it's\ngoing to be emotionally painful that's\nokay but in the back your mind if you go\nthrough this process reassure yourself\nthat your ability to achieve your dreams\nwill actually increase right that's why\nwe got to go through it\nfor the things that are left I'm going\nto leave y'all with one other thing\nthat's very helpful which is the one\nFive and Twenty rule so for the thing\nthat is left every single day you're\ngoing to do your best to do three things\ncomplete three tasks\none task that takes less than one minute\none task that takes less than five\nminutes and work on one task that takes\nmore than 20 minutes\nso now with some of this cognitive load\nfreed up what we want to do is focus our\nenergy on these tasks so cross one\nreally simple thing off cross one thing\noff that's like or check off one thing\nthat's really really simple check off\none thing that maybe takes a little bit\nmore work and work on one other goal and\nwhen I sort of find that people are able\nto do this when they cross things off\ntheir list when they let go of their\ndreams they can actually start working\ntowards the existing ones and as they\nsacrifice stuff off they're actually\nable to move forward and there was\nsomething really beautiful happens in\nthe same way that having too many dreams\nleads to you being overwhelmed and being\nunable to start when you do these two\nthings the opposite will happen you will\nstart to actually gain momentum it'll\nactually be kind of like dominoes\nfalling over where you complete one task\nwhich gives you a little bit of\nconfidence then you can complete the\nnext one and you can complete the next\none you can complete the next one you\ndon't have to do the three tasks the one\nFive and Twenty rule every single day I\nwould say actually start with five days\na week so don't do it every day give\nyourself time to rest otherwise you'll\nget over taxed and it'll you'll just\nstart over\nand as you do this you'll start to gain\nthat positive momentum and the most\nbeautiful thing is that as you start to\ndiscover that your incomplete karmas the\nthings that you were supposed to do and\nby the way those can be parts of the\ntasks right so go back and apologize to\nsomeone from three years ago that you\nsaid you were going to show up at their\nbirthday party and they booked a spot\nfor you and you didn't actually show up\ncross that off of your list either give\nup on it or check it off call that\nperson say hey I know it may seem small\nbut three years ago I said I was going\nto be there and I didn't show up I'm\nreally sorry about that\nyour mind will feel liberated because\neven now if you pay attention\na little bit of cringe right you feel\nthat tiny bit of cringe and what does\nthat tiny bit of cringe do it causes you\nto reach towards unhealthy coping\nmechanisms and if you're like me\nfirst decade of your like teenage years\nto Young adulthood we're filled with\ncringe and you're so burdened by cringe\nthat you can never produce move towards\nyour dreams because how can someone who\nis so [ __ ] cringe ever accomplish\nthose dreams you absolutely cannot so 1\n5 and 20. five days a week cross one\nthing off your list that's one minute\none thing off your list that's five\nminutes and move towards something that\ntakes more than 20 minutes you don't\nhave to accomplish it as you start to do\nthis you will notice that your cognitive\nload is freeing and that you are\nactually making progress towards your\ngoals and once you do that the whole\nsituation starts to change you will feel\nbetter you will be more productive it'll\nbe like the complete opposite of being\noverwhelmed and stuck so good luck with\nit and it's going to be kind of cringe\nbut it'll absolutely be worth it I say\nthis is someone who has had catastrophic\ndate after catastrophic date who is now\nhalf happily married\nif it worked for me it'll work for you\nforeign\n[Music]"
