    "transcript": "there's one key to understand whether\nyour mind is functioning properly or\nimproperly and that is whether there is\nthe presence of emotion or ego if you\nhave emotions that are active then your\nlogic will be flawed and this is where\npeople will say no but I am perfectly\nlogical if you cannot feel emotions that\nmeans that they are active that means\nthat they are active and suppressed tons\nof fmri studies that show that our\nemotional circuits of the brain are\nactive all day and all night you always\nhave emotions so if you can't feel the\nemotion that just means it's active and\nyou're unaware of it blindness and\ninactivity are two different things so\nif you are aware of your emotions and\nthey don't control you then your\nthoughts will be good the second sign\nthat mind is the your logic is flawed is\nthe presence of ego and what is ego I\nstatements or comparisons anytime your\nmind says I am dot dot dot therefore I\ncan or cannot do this that is flawed\nanytime your mind says this person can\ndo this but I can't do it because I'm\nthis that is ego your logic will be\nflawed"
