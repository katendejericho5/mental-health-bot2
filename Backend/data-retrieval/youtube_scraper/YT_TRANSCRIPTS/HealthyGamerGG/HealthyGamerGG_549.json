    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about the\nscience of how to catch up in life\nand you may be one of these people\nthat's kind of wondering is it too late\nfor me to start or you're thinking like\noh my God I should have started a long\ntime ago there's no way I'll catch up\nand you sort of recognize that people in\nlife Who start early are the ones that\nget ahead right because it's like\ngetting a like 4.0 in high school lets\nyou get into a good college if you get\ninto a good college then you do well\nthere and then you can sort of get into\na good grad school or you can get a good\njob and then if you're like working at a\nprestigious company or you go to a fancy\nlike medical school like Harvard Oriel\nthen you'll sort of get more advantages\nand then you get better training and\nsort of we kind of feel like if you miss\nthe boat at some point you're sort of\nscrewed if you're ready to take the next\nstep on your mental health Journey check\nout Dr K's guide it's an immersive\nresource that distills over 20 years of\nmy experience laid out in a way that is\ntailored to your needs so if you're\nready to better understand your mind and\ntake control of it check out the link in\nthe description below so this is a video\nabout how that is absolutely not true\nand we're going to start by giving you\nevidence that you can absolutely catch\nup and then chances are what's going to\nhappen is you're not going to believe me\nwhich is totally fine\nthen what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to teach you the science of how to\ncatch up and we're going to sort of\nexplore the science of growth and how\nhuman beings actually grow we're going\nto lay it out for you really good and at\nthat point you still may not believe me\nand then we're going to get to the best\npart of the video which is how the mind\nsabotages your ability to catch up and\nI've worked with a ton of people as a\npsychiatrist who are behind in life\nThese are d-gen Gamers these are people\nlike who are alcoholics and they've\nfallen so far behind that they think\nthat they can't catch up but it turns\nout that the one thing that gets in the\nway more than anything else is\nthemselves\nso let's dive in let's start with sort\nof the science of catching up okay\nso we're going to start by looking at\nthings called something called catch-up\ngrowth so if you take infants between\nthe ages of six months and two years and\nthey sort of miss out on nutrition\nit turns out that they're kind of like\nsmall right so they're kind of their\ngrowth is stunted but if you start\nfeeding them normally after two years if\nthey miss this critical period of growth\nit turns out that they actually\ncompletely catch up to normal and they\ncan actually be a completely normal size\nso we sort of know that biologically\ncatching up on growth is actually built\ninto our genetic structure and our\nphysiology and if you sort of think\nabout this this makes evolutionary sense\nright let's say that I'm like a monkey\nand then there's a period of like\ndrought and so I sort of Miss like a one\nyear of like eating really good and so\nI'm smaller than all the other monkeys\nbut then evolutionarily like as soon as\nI get food it is an advantage for my\nbody to learn how to catch up for lost\nwith lost time right so I want to still\ncontinue to grow so that I can fight and\nmate and all that kind of good stuff so\nthe moment that I get food my body is\nactually going to be more optimized to\nabsorb those nutrients and catch up\nbut if you're someone who's fallen\nbehind you're going to say something\nlike oh but Dr K that may be true but\nthat's the body like the body is\ndifferent and the mind is different Dr K\nit doesn't work for the Mind turns out\nthat that is false it absolutely works\nfor the mind so there's another area of\nresearch called attachment and\nbehavioral catch-up right which is kind\nof weird it's called the ABCs and what\nattachment and behavioral catch-up is\nabout is about the formation of\nrelationships so we also know is that\nthere are critical periods in our\ndevelopment where we form relationships\nif y'all are kind of familiar with\nattachment Theory it sort of helps us be\nsecure in the world if we're kind of\nlike if we grow up in a secure\nenvironment where we feel safe it leads\nto our confidence as we become confident\nwe can trust other human beings as we\ncan trust other human beings we can\nconnect with them we can sort of apply\nfor job interviews and we can believe in\nourselves and like all that other good\ncrap there's so much stuff that comes\ndown to our core relationships\nand so what people may think is that\nokay but like what if I had a screwed up\nchildhood on like I'm behind I don't\nknow how to make friends I don't believe\nin myself well that's what's so cool\nabout the the research behind ABC or\nattachment and behavioral catch-up is we\nactually know that there are ways that\nyou can catch up in all of that stuff\ntoo you can develop confidence in\nyourself you can start to feel safe in\nthe world and you can develop like\nlasting and meaningful and impactful\nrelationships instead of just being you\nknow a bundle of anxiety all day long\nand so we actually have research on the\noutcomes of the ABCs which work well\nso we have good evidence that catch up\nis actually baked into our genes our\nphysiology and even our neurochemistry\nthat evolutionarily the body and brain\nare designed to catch up after a period\nof like you know things not working well\nor things not being ideal\nso the next thing that we're going to\nget into is how what do we know about\nthe science of growth in the science of\nketchup we're going to start with a\nreally simple analogy of like working\nout okay so let's say that I'm doing\nbench pressing right because like I'm\ngoing to be a chair Dr Gay like let's\nget big man let's Get Swole so if we're\ngonna do that let's say I bench press\nand I do 10 reps so what is our\nexperience of like what do we know about\nthe science of like where the growth\nhappens the first five reps I get very\nlittle growth next three reps I get a\nlittle bit of growth it's really during\nthe last two reps when the strain is the\nhighest that I actually get the most\num kind of growth and stress on the\nmuscle fiber and as I stress that muscle\nfiber for the last two reps that's\nactually what's responsible for the most\ngrowth so if you kind of think about\neven people who work out let's kind of\nthink about that for a second right so\nif there's someone who works out for 30\nyears and someone who works out for\nthree years is the person who works out\nfor 30 years going to be necessarily\nmore swole or in shape than the person\nwho's been working out for three years\nand the answer is absolutely not what\ndetermines which one of those people is\nactually in better shape it has to do\nwith the way that they work out right so\nif someone does eight reps for 30 years\nthey will not be as physically strong as\nsomeone who does 10 Reps for three years\nbecause it's in that last window of time\nthat we actually see the most growth and\nwhen I worked with people who are behind\nwhat we essentially optimize for is that\nlast 10 to 20 percent of effort where\nthe real growth happens and the big\nproblem with people who kind of struggle\nwith catching up in life is that they'll\nkind of half ass it right so you'll do\nlike five reps you'll do six reps but\nyou won't actually push yourself\nlike completely to the Limit and there's\na good reason for that and that's\nbecause if you really look at the last\ntwo reps those are the hardest to do so\nwhat do we know about the science of\ngrowth in the science of catching up\nthat you need a small amount of help to\nmake it successful\nnow this is where immediately half the\npeople that I've worked with or more\nthan half of the people that I've worked\nwith have a reaction to that they say oh\nmy God Dr K you're saying I can't catch\nup without help and what they\nautomatically start doing and you may be\ndoing this as well is they start\nthinking like oh my God I have fallen so\nfar behind I'm going to need so much\nhelp to catch up right it's not fair for\nsomeone I'm 10 years behind is someone\nsupposed to help me like redo those 10\nyears the answer is absolutely not you\ndo not need help for the whole journey\nyou just need help for 10 to 20 percent\nof the journey so let's go back to our\nworking out analogy and think about this\nright so when I have a workout buddy\nwhat does the workout buddy help me with\nthey don't help me with the first five\nreps they don't help me necessarily with\nthe next three reps they help me usually\nwith their last rep and that's really\nall we need help for so what we sort of\nknow from people who are like trying to\ncatch up in life if you look at people\nwho are like alcoholics or you look at\nsomething like psychotherapy be so if\nI'm working with a d gen gamer how much\nof my help do they actually need they\ndon't need me to help them like 24 hours\na day they don't even need me to help\nthem 16 hours a day they don't even need\nme to help them every day all they need\nis one hour of support either coaching\nor Psychotherapy once a week and that's\nthat tiny amount that really leads to\nthat like exponential growth\nso if you're struggling to catch up in\nlife one of the things that you really\nneed to do is is get some help but you\ndon't need that help to help you with\nthe whole journey you can still do most\nof it on your own it's in those little\nmoments where you feel like you can't do\nwhat you need to do that I strongly\nencourage you to ask for help so that\ncan be something as simple as working\nwith a coach or a psychotherapist for\nonce a week it can be finding a workout\nbuddy to try to help you like work out a\nlittle bit it can be recruiting a friend\nto help you like cook twice a week right\nor teach you how to cook you need\nactually a very small amount of effort\nor help to actually get you into that\nmaximal growth phase okay so that's the\nfirst thing to understand\nsecond thing you need to understand\nabout the science of catching up is if\nyou want to catch up you've got to\nchange your environment some so we sort\nof know about the science of addiction\nis when people have a particular friend\ngroup\nthose people that friend group will lead\nto particular behaviors okay so if I\nhave friends that\nI don't know like drink all the time and\nI hang out with them it'll make it\neasier for me to drink all the time if I\nhave friends who are potheads or Gamers\nand those are the people that I hang out\nwith on Discord or IRL that's the\nbehavior that I'm going to end up\nengaging in so generally speaking if you\nfall behind in life chances are the\nreason you fell behind is because you\nwere with other people who are generally\nkeeping you behind so that can even be\nthings like parents or siblings who are\na little bit abusive or don't like\nsupport you in the way that you need or\nit can be a friend group of like fellow\ndegenerates and I was one right like so\nthe thing that we love as degenerates is\nwhen like everyone else is degenerate\nwith us because if everyone else is like\nout there living their life then I'm\ngoing to feel really bad about myself so\nI actually end up avoiding those people\nthat make me feel bad about myself and I\njoin my tribe which is the degenerates\nand we're all going to be degenerates\ntogether we're going to be\nanti-capitalism anti-work anti the man\nanti everything and we're gonna sit here\nwe're gonna smoke our pot and we're\ngonna play our games or we're gonna be\nit's gonna be great I'm not saying that\ncapitalism isn't bad in some ways but\nwhat I'm encouraging you to think a\nlittle bit about The Company You Keep\nand what we know from like the science\nof things like addiction recovery is\nthat changing your company is really\nimportant\nnow the question is okay how do I do\nthat Dr K how do I just change my\ncompany so I'm going to teach all a\ncouple of really simple techniques okay\nso here is how you expand your Social\nCircle\nyou go to a place where hopefully it's\nnot the same people that you know so you\ncan go to like a networking event you\ncan go to a party you can go to a\nmeet-up you can go to like you know\neverything like an escape room like just\nfind a group of people it doesn't really\nmatter and you've got opportunities just\ngo there and then you're like but I\ndon't know anyone so I'm going to teach\nall a really simple way to talk to\npeople so that you can join people it's\nreally simple so you can walk up to\npeople like let's say you're at a\nconference or party you can say hi so\nlook at them make eye contact smile okay\nso you want to go like this actually you\ndon't want to go like that's\nweird if you're like look here I am\ndon't do that don't do the hand emotions\nokay just look at them in the smile like\nso nod and make eye contact and then\nthey know you're coming over this Dodges\nthe problem that a lot of people who\nstruggle with social activity struggle\nwith which is like how do you insert\nyourself into the conversation you walk\nup to a crowd of people they're just\nstanding there and then you're like just\nstanding there awkwardly you're not\nparticipating in anything you're not\nlike saying anything you can't get a\nword in so like how do you avoid that\nyou make eye contact with someone in the\ngroup and you smile at them you nod or\nsomething like that and then you walk\nover so this person now knows that you\nare coming in okay\nnext thing that you you can do is you\ncan just say hi my name is alok I'm\nlooking to expand my Social Circle or\nget into new things\nit's nice to meet you that's it because\na lot of times we wonder okay what's my\nexcuse for like entering into a group of\npeople I need some kind of reason do I\nneed to explain to them that I have no\nfriends and I'm social up no you can\njust say hi my name is Alex I'm looking\nto learn more about whatever this is or\nI'm looking to expand my Social Circle\nit's a pleasure to meet you and then you\nshake hands with everybody now you're a\npart of the conversation okay that's\nsimple so then the other thing that you\ncan do is once you're part of the\nconversation you can just ask people\nopen-ended questions about whatever\nthey're talking about but you want to\nask like one to two questions and then\nlike let other people ask questions as\nwell so you don't want to hammer them\nwith question after question after\nquestion but if people are talking about\nI don't know they're talking about their\nfavorite place to go scuba diving you\ncan say oh that's really awesome can you\nhelp me understand like how you got into\nscuba diving so you can just ask an\nopen-ended question about whatever\nthey're talking about and then you'll be\ntotally fine okay so that's how to\ninsert yourself into a group of people\nso this is what we need to do we need to\nchange our social environment because\nthe social environment will inform our\nBehavior the second thing that we need\nto do to catch up is to change our\nphysical environment so when I was\ntrying to put my life together I\nactually had two desks\nand one of them I picked up on the\nstreet and I was poor and stuff so I had\none laptop I had an I have space for two\ncomputers but what I would do is I take\nthe same laptop that I would game with\nI'd log out of the laptop I'd move over\nto my other desk and I would stick the\nlaptop there and I'd log into my work\nlogin\neven that kind of cognitive shift or\nthat environment shift will shape the\nway that your brain thinks so if you can\ngo to a library if you can go to a\ncoffee shop if you can even just log out\nof your computer and switch to a\ndifferent space like taking your laptop\nto a couch\nwhatever you can do to shift your\nenvironment will shift your thinking\nokay so get a little bit of help it's\nokay to ask for help by the way and\ny'all may be wondering like hey like how\ndo I ask for help it depends on what\nyou're trying to catch up with so if\nyou're trying to catch up with\nsocializing you can walk up to people\nyou can say hey I'm looking to expand my\nSocial Circle you know are you all down\nto I've learned to love more I'd love to\nlearn more about what y'all are talking\nabout and then at the end of the\nconversation you can be like hey it was\nlike really cool hanging out with y'all\nare y'all down to hang out sometime just\nask right the worst that they can say is\nno and that's okay so you want to expand\nyour Social Circle you need some amount\nof help whether that's a psychiatrist\ntherapist coach friend workout buddy\nwhatever get some kind of help change\nyour Social Circle and change your\nenvironment\nso now if you've gotten this far\nyou may be wondering a little bit about\nokay Dr K like this sounds great but\nlike I still don't think it'll work for\nme right you make it sound so easy\nthere's no way brah you don't understand\nDr K like I'm 15 years behind in life\nthere's no way that walking up to a\ngroup of people and telling them hey I\nwant to expand my Social Circle is going\nto make up for all the crap that I'm\nbehind on\nyou are absolutely correct and this is\nwhere we get to how the mind sabotages\nyou when you try to catch up\nthere are two things that sabotage us\nwhen we try to catch up and this is the\nreal reason that people don't catch up\nit's because there's like tons of data\nright and like I'm a psychiatrist that\ntrained at Harvard and I was faculty\nthere I know what I'm talking about but\nwhat is your mind telling you right now\nit's not going to work for me that's not\nhow it works we have evidence from\nphysiology and nutrition we have\nevidence about attachment Theory and\nconfidence we even have like a nice plan\nthat's been laid out it's not everything\nright won't get you 100 of the way there\nbut those are that's where to start but\nwhat is your mind doing your mind is\nsaying no it's not going to work or that\nwon't work for this reason because now\nwe need to understand what really\nsabotages us when we need to catch up\ntwo things\nthe first thing that sabotages us are\nour emotions\nso when you try to catch up in life your\nmind will give you reasons to not catch\nup right so it'll say don't go to that\nparty no one will like you or it won't\nbe enough these are really Classics that\nI've worked with tons of people who are\nbehind it won't be enough it won't be\nenough and if you've been thinking that\npay attention okay it won't be enough\nit's not going to work it'll work for\nother people which we'll get to\nso now if we pay attention to what's\nhappening in your mind what is the\ndirection of all of these thoughts the\ndirection of all of these thoughts is to\nnot do it okay now this is what we have\nto understand about the mind the Mind\nmay present you with things that seem\nlogical but generally speaking if you're\nbehind in life chances are your emotions\nare controlling you the biggest\nmisunderstanding in our society today is\nthat even if we're logical our logical\ncircuitry in the brain is literally\ncontrolled by our emotions our emotions\nhave a controller where they're hitting\nbuttons and they're controlling our\nlogic and this is why when someone is\nbehaving when someone is emotional you\ncan argue with them as much as you want\nto but they will keep on coming up with\nreasons to logically disagree with you\nyou can see this in political arguments\nyou can see it with arguments with\nidiots on the internet it doesn't matter\nhow logical you are they have plenty of\nlogic to refute your logic and this is\nthe real problem where people get\ntripped up is because when you have a\nlot logical reason to not do something\nwhat do you try to fix you try to fix\nthat reason right you try to solve that\nproblem okay how can I go there and make\nit worthwhile how can I be sure that\nthis will work because it'll be a waste\nof time and then I'll be further behind\nso I can't afford to do this sounding\nfamiliar but what is the direction of\nall of these thoughts these direction of\nall of these thoughts is to not get you\nto do something\nand that's how you know that it's\nemotional in nature because if it's\ntruly logical any logical thought should\nend up you know they shouldn't all end\nup in the same place when our emotions\ncontrol our thoughts the direction of\nall of the thoughts leads to the same\nplace and that's how you know that\nyou're not even thinking logically\nso what do we do about this first of all\njust acknowledge that there's some\nemotion here and try to decompress that\nemotion as best as you can you can do\neverything from meditation to\npsychotherapy to even noticing that wow\nno matter what I do my mind is giving me\nreasons to not try and once you notice\nthat what you'll sort of discover is\nthat shame is behind this and why does\nshame get people to stop doing stuff so\nthis is important to understand why does\nyour mind even do this in the first\nplace\nso if we think about shame\nif you are ashamed of yourself because\nyou're behind you don't believe in\nyourself okay if you don't believe in\nyourself your mind calculates your\nattempts as failure so like your mind is\nthinking okay we're pathetic we're\nbehind you need to be ahead to get ahead\nin life right and we miss that boat so\nwe're screwed so if we try we are\ndestined to fail if we're destined to\nfail then that hurts right because we're\ngoing to put forth all this effort and\nwe're not going to get anything from it\nthat sounds like a bad deal imagine I\ncame up to you and I said boy do I have\nan opportunity for you you can give me\nten thousand dollars and you're gonna\nget all for it right I'm launching\nmy new crypto coin and you can buy it\ntoday for 10 grand and you will get one\nHG Dr K coin and the HG Dr K coin will\ngive you nothing in return would you\never take that no of course not right I\nguess we're going to start our own\ncryptocurrency now and this is what your\nmind is thinking if you are ashamed of\nyourself and if you don't believe in\nyourself it believes that all efforts\nwill lead to failure and if all efforts\nlead to failure it is going to try to\nconvince you to not buy that\ncryptocurrency it is going to do\neverything within its power to protect\nyou from that failure which is precisely\nwhy it tries to sabotage your attempts\nto move forward\nthe second thing that the Mind does you\nhave to watch out for I statements so\nthis is also something that's very\nimportant to understand\nso if I'm behind in life I start to form\nopinions of who I am and if you're\nlistening to this talk and you're saying\nI can't do this Dr K the people that you\nworked with are different or the reason\nthey were able to catch up is because\nthey worked with you right your mind is\ngoing to generate all kinds of\nstatements about how other people are\ndifferent but I can't do this and it's\nalso going to generate lots of logic\nright I didn't have those opportunities\nI'm not as tall I'm not as attractive\nI'm not as wealthy I'm not as smart I'm\nnot as as disciplined I'm not as lucky\nI'm not\nall kinds of things and so here's the\nreally weird thing when you start to\nbelieve something about yourself it\nstarts to shape what you choose to do or\nnot do so if I say something like okay I\nam socially anxious I am socially\nawkward that belief in myself is going\nto prevent me from engaging in whatever\nthat activity is so I'm not going to go\nto parties because I'm so socially\nanxious\nand so the beliefs that you have about\nyourself start to shape your actions and\ndetermine your future and what always\nhappens with the beliefs that you have\nabout yourself is they become\nself-fulfilling prophecies so if I\nbelieve I'm socially awkward and I have\nall this evidence by the way Dr K it's\nnot you know the reason you're saying\nthat is because like bro you don't know\nme you don't know how socially awkward I\nam I'm absolutely socially awkward Okay\ncool so you're socially awkward so then\nwhat so you're not going to go to a\nparty if you're not going to go to a\nparty then what you're going to your\nsocial skills will atrophy and then what\nand then you will become socially\nawkward it's a vicious cycle in the\nwrong direction\nthe key thing to understand is these are\nall ego based statements they're\nstatements of I am\nand this may sound weird but all that\ncrap is BS because who you are is\ndetermined by your actions right the\nreason you're socially awkward is\nbecause you don't go to parties and then\nyour social skills atrophy what happens\nif you force yourself to go to a party\nit's gonna be painful but then you will\nstart to accumulate social skills as you\nstart to accumulate social skills your\nidentity of being socially awkward will\nstart to decrease and what I've seen\nwith tons of people and myself as well\nis then your identity will change into\nI'm someone who used to be socially\nawkward and I'm telling you that as\nsomeone who used to be socially awkward\nI was on The Struggle Bus with that a\nwhile ago but now I've gotten better and\nthis is the really devastating thing\nabout catching up is once we start\nmaking these ego-based statements and\nletting them control what we do that is\nwhat we become\nbecause just think about it right so if\nI'm afraid of heights it prevents me\nfrom climbing a mountain versus I\nacknowledge hey I'm afraid of heights\nbut I'm not going to let it control me\nI'm going to climb a mountain anyway how\ndo I feel once I've climbed the mountain\nam I still afraid of heights yeah but I\ndid it anyway and once you start doing\nthat something revolutionary will happen\nwho you are no longer dictates what you\ndo\nand as who you are and your emotions no\nlonger dictate what you do\nthis is when you will start catching up\nthis is the key thing what keeps people\nstuck for 15 years is that they they\nsabotage their efforts because their\nsense of ego identity and emotions get\nin the way of them even making progress\nthat's the real problem it's not that\ncatching up is actually hard to do or it\nmay be hard but we know from all these\nstudies about growth and like you know\nmuscle development and stuff like that\nthat you can absolutely catch up I've\ndone it I started med school at the age\nof 28 and here I am today like I started\nyou know late in life\nand you can absolutely do it but what\nreally gets in the way is the way that\nyour mind tells you it's a waste of time\nit's hopeless it's not enough this is\nnot who you are since you are this way\nyou cannot do this thing but the beauty\nbeautiful thing is that once you crack\nthat once you really realize that start\ndoing the things that are in the\nopposite direction of what your mind\ntells you notice that all of the logic\nin my mind is leading to one conclusion\nmy mind is actually trying to convince\nyou why is your mind using logic it's\ntrying to convince you it recognizes\nthat this may not be true but if it\nconvinces you it protects you from pain\nbut leaves you stuck\nso if you want to catch up in life\nunderstand this principle of growth and\nthat the last 10 to 20 percent of effort\nis actually where most of the growth\nhappens try to get a little bit of help\nyou don't need a ton of help and by the\nway now that we've sort of understood\nthese emotions in this ego we can also\nsee that even the way that you react to\nme telling you you need help oh you see\nthose reactions the reaction is like no\nno no no no no it's too much no one's\ngoing to be able to help me it won't\nwork you see that\nget a little bit of help change your\nenvironment change your Social Circle\nand most importantly pay attention to\nthe way that your mind sabotages you and\nif you can do these things you will\nabsolutely catch up foreign\n[Music]"
