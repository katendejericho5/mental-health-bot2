    "transcript": "socially anxious people\nstruggle with socially oblivious people\nthis is what creates your anxiety like a\nsocially anxious person is hyper aware\nand the socially oblivious person is\nhypo aware and these two things fit\nreally together because if someone is\nsocially aware they're going to\nacknowledge they're going to recognize\nthat hey I should stop talking at some\npoint so that this other person can jump\nin the problem is that socially anxious\npeople think that they're screwing up\nbut that's because they're socially\noblivious person you're talking to who\ndoesn't like think about when you should\nspeak and that a conversation is between\ntwo people so stop beating yourselves up\nif someone else doesn't know how to talk\nand it's not something that we don't\nacknowledge right so like right now when\nwe think about social anxiety we're like\noh my God it's a problem in me fix me\nfix me fix me but any social interaction\ninvolves two people and oftentimes\nsocially anxious people grew up with\noblivious communicators"
