    "transcript": "hey y'all today I want to talk about how\nchasing success leads to failure and\neven unhappiness\n[Music]\nwhen I was still of practicing full-time\npsychiatrist I noticed that I worked\nwith a couple of groups of patients who\nwould come in and sort of Chase\nparticular things and despite getting\nthose things they would still be unhappy\nso one of these groups was the success\nChad so these were people that you know\nwould Chase different kinds of stuff on\nthe sigma grind set so I got to get\npromoted I gotta make more I gotta do\none passive income stream second passive\nincome stream and I noticed that these\npeople were almost on this success\ntreadmill where they would strive for\nsomething they would actually achieve it\nbut they wouldn't actually be content\nafterward and there was always something\nnext and on the flip side I would work\nwith people who were degenerate Gamers\nso these were people that weren't really\nstriving for success but they were still\nchasing something they were sort of on\nthis concept of the hedonistic treadmill\nwhere they would chase a particular\nthing like I want to have fun or I want\nto get high or I want to like eat good\nfood and despite the fact that they\nwould like play video games over and\nover and over again they would never\nreally be satisfied so despite the fact\nthat they were chasing this they weren't\nactually becoming happy because of it\nhey y'all I want to take a moment to\nthank the sponsor of today's video\nblinkist blinkist is an awesome app that\nhelps you digest the most important\ninformation from over 5 500 non-fiction\nbooks and podcasts into 15 minutes I'm\ncurrently using blinkist to get through\nSigmund Freud's interpretation of dreams\nnow the interpretation of Dreams is a\nTome that anyone who's interested in\nmental health has to read and I've tried\nto read it three times but it's\nincredibly boring and what I love about\nblinkist is that it takes the Tome and\nit distills it into blinks and each\nblink is about a page long and so it\noffers enough depth and context for me\nto really understand what Freud was\ntrying to say there's also another\nreally cool feature which they just\nadded called blinkist spaces this is a\nplace where you can invite other people\nto give you recommendations about which\nbooks you should check out and I really\nlike this because I've noticed that\nthere's more and more fake reviews on\nthe inner internet so even five star\nreviews don't necessarily lead to things\nlike good books and I really like\ngetting recommendations from people who\nknow what I'm interested in which is\nexactly what spaces allows you to do so\nit helps me be more efficient at\nselecting the right books and getting\nthrough those key points in a much more\nefficient manner so if you all are\ninterested they have an awesome\npromotion right now where you can get 20\noff your monthly subscription so please\ncheck out the link in the description\nbelow and sign up for blinkist today and\nthank you once again to blinkist for\nsponsoring this video and making mental\nhealth content on the internet free and\nwhen we sort of think about this like\neven as a psychiatrist I used to think\nabout these two groups of people is very\ndifferent right the degenerate gamer\nwho's chasing God knows what every day\nwhen they're like on the computer or the\nsigma grind set person this person who's\nlike working at an investment bank or\neven like a physician at Harvard Medical\nSchool these were the people that I was\nworking with and we sort of think about\nthese groups of people is different but\nthe more that I started working with\nthem the more that I realized there is\nactually like this common shared pathway\nbetween both of these people so when I\nstarted working with these people\nespecially the sigma grind set folks I\nsort of Drew on my monk training right\nso they would come in and say Dr K Dr K\nlike I'm really unhappy with my life\nlike I got promoted and I'm doing this\nand like no matter how much I achieve\nlike I want more and then I'd sort of\nlike Channel monk mode right and I'm\nlike okay let us understand that the\nproblem with your life is that you want\nthings so you might just give up your\ndesires all right give it up and then\nyou will be content your desires are\ncontrolling you so this is like pretty\nstandard like mindfulness sort of wisdom\nright like stop wanting and you will be\nhappy and frankly these people were like\nf that bro I don't want to actually give\nup my desires I actually want to\naccomplish stuff but I just wish that\nwhen I accomplished stuff I would\nactually be content and on the flip side\nwith the degenerate Gamers I tell them\nokay the problem is that you are playing\nvideo games you are playing too much you\nneed to stop it is polluting your mind\nand ruining your brain and all these\nkind of just stop bro and there they\nwere like yeah I sort of get that right\nlike I know I should stop I've tried to\nstop it doesn't really work like\nsomething just doesn't work I can't just\nstop so even the standard mindfulness\napproach of hey like stop wanting things\nand you will be happy that was\nunacceptable for those people and if\nsacrificing your desires for the sake of\nyour happiness which you sort of like\ntheoretically know should work is not\nsomething that you want to do then this\nvideo is actually for you because\nworking with these people what I figured\nout is how can you actually continue to\nchase things but actually be satisfied\nfrom them in order to understand this\nlet's kind of go through a general\nscenario and then dive into some\nneuroscience and then talk about some\nyogic or meditative principles then\neverything will become clear so to begin\nwith we have this sort of concept of a\ntreadmill where I want something whether\nlet's say like I want a promotion so I\nwork really really really really really\nhard and I get that promotion and then\nfor some amount of time I feel content\nbut then eventually that desire comes\nback where I like I want more like I\ncrossed let's say six figures I'm making\na hundred thousand dollars a year now I\nwant 120 I want 140 I want 160. and you\ncan turn to those people and you can say\nhey bro you should be content with 100\nbut like who doesn't want 120 if you're\nmaking one 100 right who doesn't want 20\ngrand more 30 grand more 40 Grand more\nlike your life is just going to be\nbetter if you have a little bit more\nmoney right and so we don't actually\ndon't want to give that stuff up because\nwe have these goals and we don't want to\ngive up our goals on the flip side we\nhave these people who are like the\ndegenerate Gamers or the people who are\npursuing sort of worldly pleasures right\nand these people too it's not like you\nhave a lot of fun playing video games\nbut even if you play video games for a\nwhile like you still have to play more\nand you have to play more and you have\nto play more and even people who for\nexample when I was working with people\nwho like have problems with disordered\neating they really do enjoy the food to\na certain extent it's just stuff gets\nkind of out of control so this is the\ncore problem is that your mind wants\nsomething you chase it and then after\nachieving it the the joy that you get is\n10 temporary and we wish there was a way\nto make that Joy permanent and so the\nstandard yogic kind of thinking is like\nokay like give up those desires but\ninstead what I'm actually going to teach\ny'all how to do is make that Joy\npermanent which is bizarre I know but\njust bear with me okay the first thing\nto understand is that the brain has not\nevolved for happiness or contentment it\nhas evolved for survival which is\nprecisely why it keeps things sort of\ntemporary in terms of enjoyment so if we\nsort of think about two different people\nright one person who is content after\nachieving a single thing and someone\nelse who is never content with\nachievement which person do you think\nactually does better in life so if we\nlook at people who are at places like\nHarvard Medical School and investment\nBanks and Goldman Sachs and stuff like\nthat when I work with these people what\nI sort of found is that the way that\nthey beat themselves up after\naccomplishing something or after\nsucceeding the way that they are\ndissatisfied with their success is\nactually an Adaptive advantage in\ntoday's world I got into HMS and now\nlike I want to like rise right now I\nwant to be chief resident then I want to\nget promoted then I want to climb the\nacademic ladder I want to be chief of\nPsychiatry so they always want more so\nthe people who are never satisfied\nactually do better objectively in life\nso this is absolutely adaptive and let's\nkind of think through it so I was\nworking with one content creator and\nthey were sort of telling me that like\nyou know they went to a particular\nconference and they gave like a huge\npresentation and the presentation did\nreally really really well and so what\nwhat happened in their mind is like the\nthe second the presentation ended they\nweren't like everyone clapped and\neveryone seemed happy but they were not\ncontent immediately what they started\nthinking is like what could I have done\nbetter and then they went to their\nfriends and their colleagues and stuff\nlike that and they said hey like how'd\nyou think the presentation went and\neveryone was like it did it went great\nman like you did awesome and they're\nlike wait but hold on a second do you\nthink I could have done anything better\nand they're like no you did fantastic\nand in that moment did they actually\nlisten to their friends of course not\nthey were like well these people are my\nfriends and you know they wouldn't tell\nme if I was actually doing something\nwrong so despite this person working\nreally hard and being really successful\nand getting lots of feedback that is\nlike positive in nature they were still\nunhappy right they accomplished pretty\nmuch everything they set out to\naccomplish and they are still unhappy\nand so if we think about that what does\nthat result in next time around so if\nthey can't relax right because they did\na good job because if you did a good job\nthen you can finally chill out but if\nyou convince yourself that you didn't do\na good job then you don't relax and you\nwork even harder and you try even more\nand the next presentation you give will\nbe objectively better right because\ninstead of chilling you figure out okay\nwhat can I do better what can I do\nbetter five percent better ten percent\nbetter 13 better six percent better I\nwould need to be better I need to be\nbetter I need to be better and so what\nwe discover is that this part of our\nbrain that is never satisfied is\nactually adaptive towards Improvement\nand the more successful you are the more\nlikely you are to do these kinds of\nthings so this is where what a lot of\ntraditional mindfulness people will say\nis that yes you are chasing something\nthat you will never become satisfied\nwith no amount of external achievement\nwill ever make you happy right happiness\ncomes from within and so what you need\nto do is give up your desire let go of\nall of your worldly Ambitions and then\nyou will find contentment that strategy\nworks great if you were a monk right so\nif I'm living in the Himalayas it makes\nperfect sense to give up all my desires\nbecause I'm not going to be chasing them\nanyway the problem is that kind of\nattitude simply did not work for a lot\nof my patients they were like I don't\nwant to give up my desires I like my\ndesires I'm attached to them so after\nyou chase something and you achieve it\nwhat is the reflex in your mind the\nreflex in your mind is to think about\nwhat you can do better but what we never\ndo is reflect on what we did well right\nwe never actually stopped up and pause\nand think about how did this experience\ngo and this is true of the hedonistic\npeople as well and this is what's\nhappening in our society is the second\nthat you play a single video game or you\nwatch something let's say like on\nwhatever short form content you like to\nconsume the second you're done with that\ncontent you never stop and reflect and\nthink about okay like I watched a 30\nsecond short or 60 seconds short how do\nI feel about that did that actually help\ndid that not help we never pause and\nreflect and in fact our whole society is\ngeared towards stopping us from pausing\nand reflecting right so the second that\none short finishes what happens there's\nan immediate short that starts playing\nagain the second you finish one video\ngame there's something that says queue\nup right here right on the end game\nscreen the ability to queue up for the\nnext game is actually there and ready to\ngo so even on the hedonistic side\nanytime you do something like when you\nspend money in a game like let's say I\nbuy a loot box the game like the second\nthat I open the loot box and I don't get\nwhat I want the game is like hey you can\nbuy another one\nso if we sort of stop and think about it\nwhat technology is actually doing to us\nis they're trying to stop us from\nreflecting and even if we go to the\nsigma grind set folks what do they do\nthey never pause to reflect they never\npause to reflect on what they did well\nthey're always jumping to what's next\nwhat's next what's next and if we really\nwant to conquer this what we need to do\nis stop that what's next so very simply\nif you have this problem of chasing\nthings even achieving them and still\nbeing unhappy with it and beating\nyourself up and needing to do more what\nyou really need to do is increase the\nspace between completing one task and\nstarting the next task you need to\nincrease the space in which you reflect\nand this is sort of a more advanced\nyogic technique whereas working with\nsome people who are called agori Babas\nokay so these are like super famous\npeople like you've probably seen\npictures of them and stuff like that\nthey're they're kind of like these like\nyoga hippies that live in cemeteries\nand they live in cemeteries and they\nlike sort of like will eat things\nthey'll drink stuff they'll like they'll\neat meat and stuff like that they'll\ndrink alcohol they'll get high and\npeople are like wow that sounds\nfantastic like they don't have jobs they\njust like live in cemeteries they also\ndon't wear any clothes and they smear\nAsh all over their bodies so you may\nhave seen these have got like huge\ndreadlocks and stuff like that so\nmeans fear and the agori sadhus are\npeople who lack fear so they live this\nphilosophy of no fear okay that's ah\nmeans not so Agora means the absence of\nfear and when you work with the igori\nBabas what I kind of learned is that\nthey sort of really reflect on their\nnegative experiences so how do they\nconquer fear how do they go and bathe in\na river where there are literally\ncorpses floating by and the way that\nthey do this they pause and they reflect\nabout their reactions to things and so\nthis like agorisadhana is like pretty\nhardcore and so what they actually do is\nthe more that they sort of create this\nwindow between I'm going to take an\naction between this action and the next\naction I'm going to pause and reflect\nand pay attention to my reactions and\nthe more that they do that the more they\nstart to conquer all of these different\nkinds of fears and they do some pretty\nwild crazy stuff that I would not\nrecommend that you do and so having\nspent time with them I started to\nrealize okay these people don't want to\ngive this stuff up right even if you're\na degenerate gamer you don't want to\ngive your gaming up I didn't want to\ngive my gaming up if you're a sigma\ngrind set Chad you don't want to give up\nyour goals and you don't need to in fact\nall you need to do is increase the\nwindow of reflection now what does this\nlook like so let's go back to the person\nwho you know did a good job with their\npresentation and so what we sort of find\nis that if you did a good job your mind\nis immediately like notice like okay hey\nhold on a second my mind is actually\ndisregarding everything positive so\npause for a second after you actually\nachieve a goal and reflect how do you\nfeel about this was it worth all the\neffort that you put in what did you\nsacrifice to get here and how long does\nthe contentment last if you just pause\nto reflect afterward you will discover\nthat your mind will start to absorb a\nlot of lessons from this kind of stuff\nand this also works really well on the\nhedonistic side so if you stop and eat a\ncookie and then you pause and you\nreflect and you start to ask yourself\nokay like what was the enjoyment from\nthis cookie what is the price of eating\nthis cookie well before I ate the cookie\nI was unhappy as I ate the cookie I was\nenjoying myself but I started to feel\nguilty because I shouldn't eat cookies\nand then when I was done eating a cookie\nI wasn't even happy even though I\nenjoyed it I wasn't happy because I\nwanted a second one and I ate the second\ncookie and then I started to feel even\nguiltier because the second cookie was\nreally enjoyable so even though I\nenjoyed it there was like suffering\nbefore guilt during and like now I'm\neven kind of pissed at myself afterwards\nand the really interesting thing is that\nwhen you stop to pause and reflect\ninstead of skipping past things your\nbrain actually starts to learn lessons\nwhen you don't pause and reflect on what\nyou've actually done and how you feel\nabout it you end up staying stuck in the\nsame cycle and this is kind of funny but\nthis is exactly why people can play ten\nthousand hours of a video game and get\nhard stuck at bronze right if you kind\nof think about it how can you play the\nsame [ __ ] game over and over and over\nagain and never get better and I can\nguarantee you that if those people are\nhard stuck at bronze what they\nimmediately do after finishing one game\nis queue up for the next one they never\nstop to watch a replay they never stop\nand ask themselves okay what actually\nwent right here or what went wrong here\noh the reason that I lost this game is\nbecause my teammates were noobs let me\njust queue up again and then I lose\nagain all my teammates are noobs why am\nI hard stuck at bronze it's because I'm\nstuck in the trench and there's so many\nnoobs fear that like I can never escape\nthis trench but if I buy a new account\nthat is at Diamond then I start winning\ngames right like it's this kind of weird\nlogic if you stop and think about it\nthis explains everything the absence of\npausing and reflecting is what keeps you\nhard stuck and so going back to the\npeople that I worked with what we sort\nof discovered is that when these people\nwanted to chase something they didn't\nwant to give up their desires I said\nokay fine don't give up your desires you\ndon't want to give them up totally cool\nyou want to continue to chase stuff\ntotally fine but the moment you achieve\nsomething pause and reflect and what I\nwould do once they came in after a\npromotion or whatever right because we'd\nbe like working on that and they had\nanxiety and all this kind of crap they'd\ncome in they say Dr K I did it and I was\nlike great how do you feel about it and\nif I didn't ask that question what they\nwould do is immediately go on to other\nproblems I achieved it I got the\npromotion by the way and now this thing\nis going on and they never paused to\nreflect and the more that I force them\nin my office to pause and reflect they\nwere like well I guess it kind of worked\nout okay like this is what I'm happy\nabout and then I'd kind of invite them\nto notice wow so you actually worked\nreally hard for six months you got this\npromotion you come into my office and\nyou're already talking about something\nelse what do you think about that and\nthey're like holy crap I never realized\nand once you're able to actually pause\nand reflect and what I would recommend\nthat you do is literally ask yourself\nthese questions number one what was the\nbuild up up to the event actually like\nhow did you feel before you did the\nthing the second thing is how did you\nfeel when you were doing the thing how\ndid you feel after you did the thing and\nthe last thing is how long did the\ncontentment last as you ask these four\nquestions you will start to actually\nwalk the pathway of the agori Babas this\nis these are the exact same four\nquestions they asked themselves when I\nfind something revolting what is my work\nup to the revolting thing what is it\nlike to experience the revolting thing\nand how long does the fear last\nafterward how do I I feel afterward and\nthe more you start to reflect something\nweird will start to happen first of all\nyou'll start to like be more content\nwith who you are you will stop chasing\nthe thing quite as much and the most\nbizarre thing is you will actually\nbecome like better at life even if you\nchoose to chase something else you will\nbe more tranquil when you choose to\nchase it if you're chasing something\nelse instead of it being like fulfilling\nsome kind of void within you you're\ngoing to be like okay this is a goal\nthat I've set for myself and my\nself-worth as a human being is not tied\nup into its success I know it sounds\nkind of bizarre but this is literally\nwhat will happen so if y'all are\nstruggling with chasing something\nachieving it or getting it and then like\nthat achievement not leading to any\nsense of contentment and you just need\nmore more more I strongly encourage you\nall to pause and reflect because the\nmore that you increase the window\nbetween one achievement and chasing\nsomething else that's actually where the\nhappiness and contentment is to be found\nso give this a shot I know it's a lot\nand good luck\nforeign"
