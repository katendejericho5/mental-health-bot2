    "transcript": "when you talk about something you will\nend up diminishing your internal energy\nso when I was like a kid like I was like\n17 years old I would tell people I\nwanted to become a doctor and then they\nwould get impressed by that right it's\nkind of bizarre it's like if you tell\npeople when you're 16 like yeah I'm\ngonna be a doctor one day and everyone's\nlike oh my God you're going to be a\ndoctor look at you you're so great and\nso what we sort of discover is that when\nyou talk about what you're going to do\nyou actually get a positive\nreinforcement externally so people are\nlike impressed with what you're going to\ndo and then something really subtle\nhappens the moment that you get a reward\nby talking about something what are you\nactually reinforcing the first is that\nyou're reinforcing that talking about\nstuff gets you reward and the second\nthing is that you're getting the reward\nwithout actually doing anything so what\nends up happening is as you talk about\nstuff your motivation to actually follow\nthrough starts to leak away"
