    "transcript": "hey y'all I'm Dr K I spent years\nstudying to become a monk but wound up\nbecoming a psychiatrist and today I want\nto teach you about how to keep your\nmotivation from leaking away\n[Music]\nin the society that we live in today we\noftentimes think that introverts are at\na disadvantage and a lot of the\nintroverts that I've worked with\nstruggle to try to become extroverts but\nthe cool thing about this is that they\nactually have a very natural Advantage\nat sort of cultivating motivation and\nwe're going to teach you that principle\ntoday if you're ready to take the next\nstep on your mental health Journey check\nout Dr K's guide it's an immersive\nresource that distills over 20 years of\nmy experience laid out in a way that is\ntailored to your needs so if you're\nready to better understand your mind and\ntake control of it check out the link in\nthe description below if we want to\nunderstand how to cultivate motivation\nwe're actually going to start in India\nso I was studying with a tantric Guru\nwho initiated me into a secret Mantra or\nMantra and one of the key things that\nthey sort of did when they initiated me\nis they said keep this secret and they\nsaid that if you ever tell anyone what\nyour Mantra is the power of the Mantra\nwill diminish but as you keep chanting\nand you sort of cultivate the Mantra\nwithin you its power will grow and you\nwill start to see a lot of material\nsuccess and spiritual success so at the\ntime I was failing out of college had\nlike less than a 2.0 GPA had no money at\nall and over time I sort of noticed that\nI kind of became more and more\nsuccessful and even today I wonder about\nwhether that month or was actually\nresponsible for this for the record I\nstill chant the mantra today and I\nhaven't really told anyone what it is so\nwhether the mother is real or whether\nI'm harnessing the energies of the\nuniverse whatever today what I'm going\nto share with you is that principle\ntranslated into science because this is\nactually scientifically true as well so\nif we look at doing therapy with people\nwho are traumatized what we sort of\ndiscover is that if someone has been\ntraumatized like let's say they were\nabused they carry that trauma within\nthem and what we know clinically is if\nwe can get them to vent that trauma the\nenergy within diminishes so as someone\ngoes to psychotherapy and as they talk\nabout their trauma essentially there's\nstuff that's stored in here which gets\nvented out and as we vent our negative\nemotions as we talk about that trauma is\nwe're honest and authentic and as our\ntherapist creates a non-judgmental space\nwhere they're compassionate with us and\nwe can share our shame and our negative\nemotions what starts to happen to the\ntraumatic individuals that shame and\nthat negativity that used to control\ntheir life stops controlling their life\nthis is literally the evidence-based\napproach of psychotherapy that what\nPsychotherapy tries to do is take\nnegativity within you and have you\nvocalize it externally and when you\nvocalize it externally the power of it\ndiminishes so what does that have to do\nwith a mantra so Mantra is actually the\nexact opposite so in a month though what\nwe're doing is we're cultivating\nsomething positive but we are not\nventing it at all right so all we're\ndoing is compounding that internal\nenergy that's positive in nature and\nthen Theory radically it starts to make\npositive changes in our life so what\ndoes this have to do with motivation\nleaking out so I want you all to pay\nattention to the people around you and\nespecially if you look at things like\nsocial media what you'll have is these\nlike entrepreneur Bros right who are\nlike always talking about what they're\ngonna do I'ma start a company I'm a\nsigma grind set I'm a passive income I'm\ngonna do this I'm gonna do this I'm\ngonna do this I'm gonna do this and why\nare those people like posting so much on\nsocial media right like on the flip side\nif we actually look at successful\nentrepreneurs they may have like a\nsocial media strategy but they're not\nout there like posting all their random\ncrap the people who are actually\nstarting and running successful\ncompanies aren't talking about it all\nthe time and what this sort of leads\ninto is this core principle that when\nyou talk about something you will end up\ndiminishing your internal energy and\nthere's more scientific evidence to kind\nof back this up so when I was like a kid\nlike I was like 17 years old I would\ntell people I wanted to become a doctor\nand then they would get impressed by\nthat right it's kind of bizarre it's\nlike if you tell people when you're 16\nlike yeah I'm gonna be a doctor one day\nand everyone's like oh my God you're\ngoing to be a doctor look at you you're\nso great and so what we sort of discover\nis that when you talk about what you're\ngoing to do you actually get a positive\nreinforcement externally so people are\nlike impressed with what you're going to\ndo and then something really subtle\nhappens the moment that you get a reward\nby talking about something what are you\nactually reinforcing the first is that\nyou're reinforcing that talking about\nstuff gets you a reward and the second\nthing is that you're getting the reward\nwithout actually doing anything so what\nends up happening is as you talk about\nstuff your motivation to actually follow\nthrough through starts to leak away and\nyou may have also seen this like in\ngaming right there are people who are\nlike posting about Theory crafting and\nlike yeah like I'm so good at this game\nand I'm gonna do this and I'm getting\ninto arguments with you I'm spending all\nmy time in energy like on the internet\nand they're like 1v1 me Noob like I'm\ngonna Crush you right if you like\ndisagree with them they get like all\nhyped up and they're like yeah I'm gonna\ndestroy you and I'm so good and the\npeople who can actually Crush you 1v1\nare the ones who are playing the game\ninstead of posting about it on Reddit\nand so this is a really really common\nprinciple that we see at play which is\nthat the more that you vent what you're\ngonna do the less motivated and\nsuccessful you will become and so this\nis the cool thing is if you're an\nintrovert you're less inclined to talk\nto people about what you do and this is\nprecisely why I think that the introvert\nentrepreneurs that I work with are so\nsuccessful because when they have that\ninternal energy they're just storing it\ninternally and they're using it to drive\nactions instead of language so the last\npiece of kind of scientific evidence\nabout this that I'm going to share with\nyou all is a discovery that Freud\nactually made so what Freud sort of\ndiscovered is that language can be a\nsubstitute for action and this may sound\nreally weird because we sort of think\nabout language and action is like not\nbeing tied together and I may have\nhopefully given you like an argument to\nthink that these two things are tied\ntogether but this is what's really\ninteresting is the two are intrinsically\ntied together and so if we sort of think\nabout you know if I'm grief processing\nand I didn't get a chance to tell\nsomeone that I love them before they\npassed away I can still go to their\ngrave and talk to them then I can share\nwith them I wish I could have done this\nwith you I wish I could have done this\nwith you I wish I could have done this\nwith you and we don't actually have to\ndo those things somehow talking about\nthe thing serves as a substitute for\naction and this is a discovery that\nFreud made which we sort of borne out in\nlots of studies on Psychotherapy that\nlanguage and action are intrinsically\nlinked and what the yogi sort of figured\nout is that both of these things come\nfrom the same pool of energy which is\nprecisely why you have two kinds of\npeople in life you have the talkers and\nyou have the doers right you have the\nentrepreneurs who are out there running\ncompanies and then you have the\nprofessors of Entrepreneurship who are\nteaching courses and talking all day\nabout starting companies now they still\nserve a valuable purpose and you could\neven argue that this is the the camp\nthat I fall into because I'm talking to\nyou now right but it's really\nfascinating because we have so many\nsources that suggest to us that language\nin action are intrinsically tied so what\ndoes this mean for you what this means\nfor you is first of all pay attention to\nwhat you say how often do you talk to\npeople about what you want to do and\nwhat is the relationship between talking\nto people about what you want to do imma\ndo this I'm gonna do this I want to do\nthis I want to do this I have this\nstream I have this fantasy I have this\nhope and we go on articulating it all\nthe time and the more that you talk what\nactually happens to your actions the\nsecond thing that I want you to do is to\nthink a little bit about when you have\nactually done stuff how much did you\ntalk to people about it before you did\nit chances are that there is an an\ninverse correlation between talking\nabout something and doing something you\nwoke up one day and you just started\ngoing to the gym instead of talking to a\nthousand people about how you want to go\nto the gym and how you're researching\ngoing to the gym and how you're going to\ngo to the gym one day right so that's\nthe second thing to pay attention to and\nthe third thing that you need to do is\nshut the hell up especially on social\nmedia so when we think about social\nmedia we think about all the negative\neffects of things like Doom scrolling\nbut if you post a lot of crap on social\nmedia instead of doing it or talk to\npeople about what your hopes and dreams\nare literally all you need to do is shut\nthe hell up now I'm not saying that you\nshouldn't talk to people if there's a\nparticular goal in mind we'll talk about\nthat in a second but what I really want\nyou all to do is if you have a\nparticular goal do not tell a soul if\nyou want to write a book do not tell\nanyone that you're writing a book keep\nthat energy within you don't vent a\nsingle ounce of it don't vent a single\nmilliliter of that energy if you have a\na goal let it compound within you now\nthe last thing to consider is okay but\nwhat about talking to people what about\nthings like journaling so this is the\nother thing to keep in mind if you want\nto vent something you need to\nre-internalize it so if you Journal you\nsure as hell better read the journal\nafterward because the point of\njournaling is to vent that energy this\nis why a psychotherapists and\npsychiatrists we tell patients to\njournal right so you get that crap out\non the page and then you're done with it\nit's out of you so if you're journaling\nabout positive stuff you absolutely need\nto read it again to try to bring that\nstuff back okay and even when it comes\nto Mantra you can listen to Mantra as\nbeing chanted for some amount of the\neffect which is like a big part of\nspiritual Traditions so if you're going\nto vent something you better\nre-internalize it and the second thing\nthat a lot of people may wonder is like\nokay but how am I supposed to am I\nsupposed to keep this secret forever you\ncan absolutely talk to people but this\nis where you have to be very intentional\nabout the scope and length of who you're\ngoing to talk to and how much you're\ngoing to talk to people about it and\nthis is something that I've learned at\nHG the more random ass meetings that I\nhave where I like there's a circle jerk\nof like yeah we want to do this and we\nwant to do this and like there are\npeople that I meet with that like have\nno idea what they're doing but they're\njust like talking about all these ideas\nand I used to engage in those\nconversations too it's like hey let's\nget together and like talk about what we\nwant to build and use Ai and use VR and\ndo all this digital mental health crap\nand gamification and the more people\nthat like they're just talking about\nrandom crap they don't actually do\nanything so now when I have a\nconversation I am engaging in a very\nscoped conversation I'm talking to this\nperson about this thing for this purpose\nI try to keep the conversation at a\nminimum and in the back of my mind I\nknow that every word I say in this\nconversation is going to deplete my\nmotivation so the conversation comes at\na cost and the more that you start to\nrealize that your Communications will be\nfocused now the only time I'm going to\nmeet with people and talk to people is\nwhen the benefit is clear and outweighs\nthe cost of venting my motivation so if\nyou all find that your motivation is\nleaking away you should use this\nthonthric principle of keeping the\npositive stuff within you let it\ncompound let it build up let that\npressure of positivity build up and then\nChannel it into action instead of words\nand on the flip side recognize that\nthere is a shared pool of energy between\ntalk and action which is precisely why\nthere are talkers or doers you never\nhave both and this is why if you just\nsimply stop talking which is naturally\nwhat introverts want to do lean into\nthat right and the less you talk the\nmore you will be able to accomplish\nforeign"
