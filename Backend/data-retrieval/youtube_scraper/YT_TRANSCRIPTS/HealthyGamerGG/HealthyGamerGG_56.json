    "transcript": "so when I was in college this was like\nearly 2000s and I was studying I would\nget distracted when I was reading a\ntextbook and my distraction would last\nmaybe 2 minutes and then since I didn't\nhave a phone at the time that\ndistraction only cost me 2 minutes then\nmy mind wanders away and then it focuses\nback on the task at hand right now if\nyou get distracted it will cost you an\nhour so all you have to do is catch that\nimpulse if you just look at your phone\nand you have face ID enabled Boom app\ndevelopers are reducing the barrier\nbetween impulse and action and they know\nthat once you look at one post you're\nstuck for 45 minutes so now what they're\ntrying to do is figure out how can if\nthis person has a single impulse how can\nI get them to the first video because\nthen we're you've got them hooked the\nfish has taken the bait they're on the\nline now the price of an impulsive\ndistraction is becoming way higher\nteenagers spend somewhere between 4 and\n6 hours a day on their cell phone it's\ncrazy and how more honestly yeah how\nthat's average how does that happen it's\nbecause they hook you for a few minutes\nand then you lose an hour"
