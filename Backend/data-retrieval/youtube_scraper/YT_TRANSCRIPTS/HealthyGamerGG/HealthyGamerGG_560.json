    "transcript": "the real crazy thing about trauma is\nthat trauma is not really a malfunction\nof the brain it is an adaptation it's\nthe Adaptive circuitry of the brain\nfunctioning properly so when we get\ntraumatized When We're Young our brain\nlearns a certain set of rules for life\nit learns certain coping mechanisms to\nsurvive and since those are the coping\nmechanisms that allow you to survive so\nfor example dissociation is a good\nexample where anytime we feel negative\nemotion we suppress that negative\nemotion and if we feel a ton of negative\nemotion all the time or physical pain we\nwill actually dissociate we unplug our\nsubjective ability to feel things from\nlike all of these pain receptors in our\nbody we like unplug we detach ourself\nfrom our body and our mind and so now\nthe brain has learned how to do that and\nthat's not it's not pathology it's an\nadaptation"
