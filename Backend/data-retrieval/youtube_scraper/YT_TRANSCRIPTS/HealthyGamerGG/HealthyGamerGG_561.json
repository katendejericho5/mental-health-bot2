    "transcript": "so let's say I walk into a party and I'm\nfeeling really anxious what are the\nsignals that I could perceive that would\nmake me feel relaxed if I saw other\npeople looking at me and smiling at me\nand like waving me over they're like hey\nlook it's Dr K Dr K's here awesome like\nhey man thanks for coming they can say\nall those things but I don't even need\nthem to say it if I walk in and I see\nother people and they smile and they\nwave me over that will be socially\nreassuring I may feel like I'm on the\nspotlight for a split second but it'll\nfeel very reassuring and this is the\nproblem is what do we do when we walk\ninto a party and we feel socially\nanxious we pull out our phones and we\nstart looking at our phone and now our\nperceptions are locked into here and if\nmy perception is locked into here how am\nI going to get all of those socially\nreassuring signals how am I going to see\nthat people despite being near me their\nbody language is relaxed or excited or\nthat they're smiling or they're trying\nto make eye contact what all I'm gonna\ndo is I'm going to be kind of locked in\nover here"
