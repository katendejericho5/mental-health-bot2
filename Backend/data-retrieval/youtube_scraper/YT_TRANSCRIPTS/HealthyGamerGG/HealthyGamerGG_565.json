    "transcript": "what are some coping strategies that you\nrecommend for those struggling with\ndepression and anxiety\nit's a great question so I'm laughing a\nlot because I think that oftentimes\npeople who are struggling with\ndepression and anxiety are actually like\nexperts at coping right they're maxed\nout on their coping skills I get that\nyou're coping yeah let's do mindfulness\nso that you can cope more but honestly\nit makes me super sad that like people\nhave to cope so much I almost want to\nencourage people to get help because\neveryone wants to optimize coping\nstrategies and it's a good thing to do\nwe know that there's good scientific\nevidence behind them but also like\nsometimes people will avoid going into\ntreatment because they're like okay if I\nlike learn one more coping skill I'll be\nable to cope and when what I really want\nto tell the people who are listening to\nthis is that I think one thing to\nunderstand is that when you get like\nreally solid in terms of treatment or\nhealth with these things you no longer\nneed to cope and that's really what the\ntarget should be coping is a temporary\nmechanism that should be used\ntemporarily"
