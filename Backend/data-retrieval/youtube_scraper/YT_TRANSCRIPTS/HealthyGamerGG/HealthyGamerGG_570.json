    "transcript": "what could you do to actually make it\neasier on yourself yeah it's a good\nquestion one is the time that it was\nhardest for me was in building up to\nactually reaching out but the time where\nit started to feel better was about 15\nto 20 seconds into like their response\nbecause I realized after that that I had\nopened the door and that uh someone else\nwas walking through it that it wasn't\njust like opening it and there was no\none there people ran the other way\nyou're putting something out and then\nyou're waiting for a response if you\nassume that the other person is going to\nhave a positive response to you that\nactually changes how you show up in the\nconversation so if you and I are meeting\nfor the first time I look and we just\ndid a few minutes ago and if I assume\nthat alok is going to like me then that\nactually turns out makes me warmer in my\ninteractions toward you and that warmth\nis perceived by the other person and\nincreases the likelihood that they will\nlike me and it becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy"
