    "transcript": "when you reach out to other people even\nthough it might feel a little weird or\nunusual if you're not used to doing that\njust know that you will almost always\nfeel better having done it and the\nperson you reached out to will feel\nbetter too even more so because it's\nbecome a more unusual thing for people\nto do you know in Modern Life but if I\nwrite someone a letter aren't they going\nto think I'm weird like isn't that a\nweird thing to do well you don't have to\nwrite them a letter you can call them if\nyou want but but if you did choose to\nwrite them a letter they would probably\nthink it's very unusual my guess or my\nown experience is that it would probably\nbe touched that hey you thought enough\nof them to actually write them a letter\nI think they're doing something super\ncool here which I think is subtle so I\nasked you do you think it's weird and\nyou said it's probably unusual and I\nthink even the way that you're talking\nabout it is really interesting because\nmy word choice is loaded with judgment\nwhich I think is actually a huge part of\nwhat people nowadays struggle with\nthey're like if I just pick up the phone\nand call I was thinking about you that\ncan seem creepy you know"
