    "transcript": "today we're going to show you how to\nteach your body that stress is designed\nfor life or death situations and not\ndoing simple stuff like opening emails\n[Music]\nso let's start by understanding what our\nstress system was designed for so if you\nlook at the animal kingdom through which\nwe evolve like our stress system is\ndesigned for short term life or death\nsituations so if we're like human beings\nin a jungle and we see a tiger that's\nwhat our stress system is designed for\nyou can look at things like deer or\nImpala or even mice or snakes and all of\nthese organisms have stress systems and\nthey're designed for sort of immediate\nand severe threats the problem if you\ncall it a problem it's kind of not\nreally a problem right I think it's a\nwin for the human race most of the time\nin society today we're not faced with\nlife or death situations right like\nwe're not we're pretty secure like we've\ngot a place to sleep hopefully we have\nfood and stuff like that and so what we\ntend to see is that our stress system is\ninappropriately activated the kinds of\nstress that we deal with today are more\nlong-term so on the first of the month\nI'm already thinking about how am I\ngoing to pay my rent at the end of the\nmonth how am I going to find a job how\nam I going to find a partner what's\ngoing to happen with climate change\nwhat's going to happen with inflation so\nthe stressors that we face today are\nmore chronic and long-term and the\nproblem is that our body has one system\nto deal with stress and that system is\ndesigned for short-term stress so in a\nweird way our body inappropriately\nactivates our stress system to deal with\nthese problems and this creates an even\nbigger issue so if you're stressed out\nyou're probably sort of in this cycle of\nlike okay I'm feeling stressed I'm\nfeeling overwhelmed let me engage in\navoidance behaviors to make the stress\ngo away so I'm going to distract myself\nor things like that and then as I\ndistract myself and engage in avoidance\nthe problems that are causing me stress\ndon't actually go away and so as those\nproblems build up and build up and build\nup I start to feel even more overwhelmed\nand more stressed out and so the\nproblems tend to pile up and then\neventually you cross this very important\nthreshold where your stress\noutweighs your feeling of overwhelming\nand then like at the last second you\nprocrastinate to the last minute and\nthen in a burst of stress driven\nactivity you do something about your\nproblem if you're ready to take the next\nstep on your mental health Journey check\nout Dr K's guide it's an immersive\nresource that distills over 20 years of\nmy experience laid out in a way that is\ntailored to your needs so if you're\nready to better understand your mind and\ntake control of it check out the link in\nthe description below but your\nperformance in that point isn't very\ngood right you're kind of exhausted\nyou're sort of stressed out you're doing\neverything all at once everything is\nrushed and then you end up kind of doing\na crappy job anyway and then you beat\nyourself up and then the cycle just\nrepeats itself so today we're going to\nteach y'all how to Short Circuit that\nentire process how to really understand\nhow stress works so that you can\noptimally solve your problems so let's\nstart by understanding how our body\nkeeps stress in check so normally let's\nsay I'm walking through the jungle and I\nsee a tiger I start to run there's a\nburst of crh and then ACTH and then that\nleads to cortisol adrenaline gets\nactivated as all these systems get\nactivated I also have a physical\ncomponent so since I'm running my heart\nstarts beating really fast my blood\npressure increases and then something\nreally really interesting happens as all\nof these things activate and I start\nrunning away what I actually my body\ndetects all of these things so there are\nthese things called your carotid\nbaroreceptors which are blood pressure\nsensors in your neck and this is kind of\ninteresting you know in like in movies\nand stuff when there's like a ninja and\nthey like choke someone out they're not\nactually cutting off their oxygen flow\nwhat they're actually doing is squeezing\non both sides of your carotid Barrel\nreceptors and this is what's really\ninteresting when they squeeze on both\nsides of the Carotid Barrel receptors\nour body thinks oh my God the blood\npressure is way too high our blood\npressure is huge right because you're\nsqueezing on those parts so it increases\nthe pressure and as we increase the\npressure there it actually causes our\nheart rate to slow down and our blood\npressure to drop which causes people to\npass out in the movies but if we sort of\nstop and think about that what we\nactually discover is this is the natural\nway that our body compensates with a\nhigh stress situation when our blood\npressure goes up and our heart rate goes\nup our body recruits other things to\nslow our heart rate down to decrease our\nblood pressure and to stop the\nproduction of cortisol now the problem\nin today's world is that when we feel\nstressed out there is not that physical\ncomponent right so we get cortisol\nrelease but we don't actually increase\nour heart rate we don't increase our\nblood pressure we don't start\nhyperventilating because we're not\nphysically running away from it\neverything the other thing that happens\nwhen we physically run away from things\nis that we release endorphins and\nendorphins will help us literally relax\nso basically what happens in the natural\nworld and through millions of years of\nevolution is any time my body gets\nstressed it automatically starts Parts\nthe circuitry to de-stress endorphins\nparasympathetic nervous system\nactivation and you'll kind of understand\nthis if you go for a very brisk run like\nif you exercise a lot what does your\nbody want to do afterward it wants to do\nabsolutely nothing I'm going to sit down\nI need to relax you don't feel like\ndoing anything you're not even mentally\nstressed you're just kind of vegging out\nand so this is the really interesting\nthing our stress system today does not\nrecruit any of those things because we\nfeel this chronic stress with no\nhomeostatic activation there's no\nbalancing of the stress response in\ntoday's world so interestingly enough if\nwe want to actually de-stress what we\nneed to do is recruit those systems so\nif you're feeling super stressed out\nabout something what you need to do is\nthe most vigorous exercise you can do\nfor as short of a time period is you can\nkind of tolerate so we're not talking\nabout 20 minutes a day we're not talking\nabout wake up every day and exercise\nwhat we're talking about is literally if\nyou are feeling stressed out try to run\nas if something a monster is chasing you\nand your life depends on it run as hard\nas you can for a short of a time period\nas you can like you don't have to run\nfor a long time you could literally do a\ndead ass Sprint for like 90 seconds and\nif you you feel absolutely exhausted and\nyou can't run 91 seconds then you're\ndoing it right now this is the really\ninteresting thing a lot of people may\nsay does this mean that I need to\nexercise no so this is what's really\ncool so if you run it 50 of Your\nCapacity you do not shut off your stress\nsystem if you run it 70 of Your Capacity\nyou shut off your stress system more if\nyou run it 90 or 100 of your capacity\nthat recruits the greatest shut off of\nyour stress system so think about it\nvery simply right so the more the harder\nyou exercise and the more difficult your\nexercise is the more that it stresses\nyour body the more that it stresses your\nbody the more that your body has to\ncompensate as soon as the stress ends to\neven release more and more endorphins\nand calm you down even more so the\nbeautiful thing about this technique is\nthat if you are not in shape if you are\nnot used to exercising you will actually\nget a greater stress reduction than some\nsomeone who is in shape and the really\ncool thing about that is that once we\nshut off our stress system then\nsomething beautiful happens once we're\nno longer stressed out and our CRA a CRF\nlevel drops then you will stop engaging\nin avoidance behaviors your cravings for\navoidance will literally go shut down or\ndecrease because our body is using\nendorphins to shut off CRF production\nonce we shut off CRF production our\ndesire for Cravings distraction and\navoidance actually decreases which then\nallows you makes it more easier to\nactually do the task that is stressing\nyou out in the first place so if you're\nin a situation where the thought of\nopening up your email triggers a stress\nresponse or sending a message to someone\nor needing to cancel social plans if\nyou're stressed out about that engage in\nas vigorous exercises you can for as\nlong as you can it doesn't have to be\nlong and then you'll start to slow down\nyou'll start to stop avoiding things and\nand then you'll actually be able to\nfocus on the task at hand and do\nsomething about it and the Beautiful\nThing is as you do things about it your\noverall Global stress will start to get\nbetter because you have fewer things to\nbe stressed out about so the problem in\ntoday's society is that our stress\nsystem gets inappropriately activated by\nmental tasks but our stress system is\nactually designed for physical survival\nand the beautiful thing is that the\nstress system has a built-in off switch\nthe problem is the stresses that we feel\ndeal with today don't actually shut off\nthe off switch even if you think about\ncompleting the task what does that do to\nyour stress level it's sort of a relief\nbut you don't actually feel fully\nrelaxed afterward and why is that it's\nbecause when you complete the mental\ntask you're not recruiting the endorphin\nsystem you're not recruiting your\nparasympathetic nervous system you're\nnot actually shutting off CRF production\nso as soon as we're done with our task\nwhat do we go back into we give in the\nCravings so if you want to master your\nstress in today's society you've got to\nrecruit your stress system in the right\nway so hopefully this is helpful give\nthis a shot and kind of let us know does\nthis work for you not work for you we'd\nlove to hear from you so go ahead and\ncomment like or subscribe\nforeign"
