    "transcript": "when people struggle with a problem they\nhear about solutions from the self-help\nspace if I struggle with anxiety like if\nI can learn to be a stoic then my\nanxiety will be fixed right and so then\ninstead of actually fixing your anxiety\nwhat you try to do is become a good\nstoic it's a better stoic you can become\neventually if you keep on leveling up\nstoicism anxiety will be conquered so\nit's almost like you're using stoicism\nis a distraction away from fixing your\nproblems exactly that's exactly right\nand so weirdly enough self-help is a way\nto not help yourself that's so well put\nthat's exactly what I was thinking it's\nalmost as if it's like shining a\nspotlight away from your true problems\nbecause I was struggling with like\nburnout and anxiety and the best\nself-help I ever got was to quit my job"
