    "transcript": "you can have people who politically\ndisagree mhm what creates a fight is not\nlike a fist fight but what creates a\nfight is like when you have a set of\npolitical beliefs I think you are stupid\nor I attach a personal devaluation along\nwith the disagreement when we've argued\nI guess we I'm sure there's times where\nwe have used like a a personal thing\nlike a negative personal thing to\nfurther our argument and and whatever so\nI guess we have thought but I think I\nthink you have to it sounds weird think\nyou to have like a a next level of\nfriendship and and and relationship with\npeople that you have to in my opinion\nyou have to go through everything to\nknow that you can go through everything\nto have that level of like oh yeah we\nfought before but like we ended up still\nbeing friends and I feel comfortable and\nI feel comfortable that if we do get in\na fight in the future that it'll be fine\nyou have to go through an argument you\ngot to go through a fight you got to go\nthrough a big fight you got to go\nthrough this and that and the other at\nleast for me to know that like oh yeah\nour friendship is secure and that I know\nif we will fight again or we do have a\nhuge big fight that it's going to be\nfine because it had it previously in the\npast"
