    "transcript": "can you guys hear me yeah I try not to\nlook at chat too much I'm just a boomer\noh you're okay I'm a boom I'm a boomer\ntoo\num but\nso yeah I do I do True Crime on Twitch\nI've been doing it I would say for about\nfive or six years\num I don't know if you know this Dr K\nbut it started with like I would just\nplay league and after I lost like three\nor four rounds I'd be like do you guys\nwant to like hear a murder story and my\nchat would be like I guess\nI would just tell them some crazy story\nthat stuck with me that week\num and then sometime in the last two\nyears I just started doing True Crime\nfull-time on Twitch like it's all we do\nnow and I find that most violent acts\nlike I mean murder overall because\nthat's what we talk about a lot in True\nCrime\num it comes from like repressed trauma\nand unregulated emotion that like if\nthey just knew that this is how they\nhandled things with violence or hitting\na boiling point this would have never\nhappened and\num so I I dive a lot into people's\nstories and like what happened to them\num I find I don't know I think that's\npretty interesting I'm also a person\nthat uh\nI think I got diagnosed with PTSD like\nthree years ago or so and I think that's\nso interesting\num I feel like all too often people\nthink that PTSD is for like War veterans\nor you know people that have been\nthrough a lot of crazy stuff and\nsometimes we devalue our trauma and how\nmuch things hurt us and we're like I\ndon't have PTSD it wasn't that bad I'm\nokay but you don't realize you're living\nin this memory or these moments over and\nover and over again and it's it's\naffecting you\num anyways that's a whole bunch of stuff\nyou pick you tell me where yeah so so I\nI love it all so I think we're gonna\nkind of meander for a while and and just\nto kind of you know lay a couple\nboundaries or you know clarify or\nreinforce a couple boundaries so while\nwe may be talking about the link between\ntrauma and crime while you may be\nsharing some of your experiences around\nsort of\nthe process of being diagnosed and maybe\nwhat your life is like we're not going\nto dive into the details of your drama\nwe're not going to diagnose you we're\nnot going to treat you or anything like\nthat right or is that clear yeah that's\ngreat but it's definitely PTSD like it's\nbad sure sure so so so yeah I mean I\nthink part of what we try to do um here\non this channel is have people share\ntheir experiences of living in the world\nwhatever that may be and sometimes that\ninvolves a diagnosis sometimes it\ndoesn't but we'd really love to just\nlearn about you and and kind of what you\nhave to offer\num you know what you want to share\nso why don't we start with just like so\nit sounds like you've become quite Adept\nat understanding True Crime talking\nabout True Crime can you just tell us a\nlittle bit about that and what you've\nlearned about\num you know true crime in the link with\ntrauma oh yeah man there's so much there\nit's like where to start right\num you know have you ever heard of those\ncases before where\num they you know somebody somebody\ncommits a crime they kill somebody and\npeople say I never saw him like that he\nwas so quiet how could this have\nhappened such a good boy\num you know sometimes I see cases and I\ncan't there's so many at this point\nwhere we have like a really quiet guy or\ngirl and they have a parent that's\nconstantly berating them um like a super\nsuper narcissistic parent that is always\nyou know me me like devaluing your\nemotions invalidating every single thing\nand really training that person to not\nspeak up to not fight for themselves\num to bully them into submission well\nthen that person has all this repressed\nand just stored anger that is never\nvalidated never expressed because you\nhave to express that and then they end\nup going to the most Primal form of\nexpressing that anger which is violence\num and they didn't have a parent they\ngave them the tools to look at other\noptions and it's like truly with this\nstuff the first step is identifying how\ndo you handle anger how do you handle\nbeing overwhelmed because every human\nexperience is that you want to be\nprepared for those emotions that are\ncoming up and if you don't know where\nthey are in your body if you're in\ndenial that you're angry if you're in\ndenial that you've been hurt because of\nthe people denied that you were hurting\num then you're not even going to be able\nto\nfeel that emotion and figure out what to\ndo next in a healthy way right so so\nmany cases that's just the bottom line\nthey don't know the emotion they feel it\nit Wells up they go to the most Primal\nInstinct and it's destroy the thing\nthat's hurting me\num and I see that a lot into your crime\nI see\num I don't know do you have thoughts on\nthat I can keep going for years keep\ngoing\nI'm taking notes one that I haven't\ntalked about too much is a really heavy\nconnection with like mass shootings and\npublic humiliation like a lot of these\npeople have an interesting story of\npublic humiliation where a lot of people\nwatched something bad happen to them and\nthey have this misanthropy they have\nthis retribution on humankind\num if you've seriously look up the\nconnection between like public\nhumiliation and what it does to the\nbrain\num that's a really big one\ninteresting can you tell us a little bit\nmore about that\num\nwhen a lot of times\num vengeance is a common theme in\nrepressed anger\num Revenge fantasies that's also like\nanother one of the Baseline ones because\nwhen one person or a lot of people hurt\nyou at once\num\nwhat are you supposed to do you know\nlike what like what are you supposed to\ndo and this takes uh it takes a lot of\nreally unique tools to work through Mass\nhumiliation which I find fascinating you\nknow back in the day a lot of these\npeople they might have been humiliated\nby a parent I see all the time\nembarrassment is something that we kind\nof do to ourselves or it happened like\nhappens but humiliation is done to you\num and you get very upset at this one\nperson but then you also get upset at\nthis Mass body of people and then we\ndon't give that child any tools for\nworking through that in fact usually the\nhumiliator is apparent and they don't\nwant to deal with what they did to you\nso they deny it right so we have this\ndenial of what happened this denial of\nyour pain and it turns into I'm gonna\nshow everyone how bad that I'm hurting\nand everyone's gonna pay\num and that's that is one of the most\ncommon themes I see in mass shootings\nbut\nI am on my channel I never talk about\nmass shootings I don't talk about\num I don't talk about these people\nbecause if you kill for attention\nespecially when these people write their\nstupid [ __ ] manifestos\num I will pay you no mind I'll kind of\nstudy the story like on the side but I\ndon't give it any type of platform like\non my channel yeah I know that there's\nyou know evidence of of like things like\nsuicide clusters this was like a lot of\nThis research was originally done in\nJapan where\num media glorification of violent acts\ntends to lead to Violent acts I wonder\nif that's part of what we're seeing in\nthe United States where\nabsolutely back in the 70s they were\ndoing interviews of serial killers\ngiving them scary names giving them\nscary headlines and it teaches all of\nthese people hey if you're in pain and\nyou have violent tendencies but you feel\nlike you're a nobody you can be a\nsomebody if you go do something really\nreally bad every single I have said this\nso many times the way that New Zealand\ntreated the Christ Church shooting which\nhorrific I the next level like I can't\neven the way that they treated it was\nafterwards they banned the guy's name\nfrom media they blurred his face on\neverything and he's just been in the\nhole for years they've wiped everything\noff of the internet and there's no\nmention of him but here in America we're\nlike the so-and-so shooter here's the\nnext because the Articles get clicks and\nthey just keep doing it and it drives me\nnuts\num so that's why I on my channel and I\nknow\nsome people probably have different\nopinions about this but I instead of\nglorifying those people and talking\nabout how scary they are I tell them\nthat they're dumb [ __ ] and they're\npieces of [ __ ] because like why are we\ngiving them scary names like it's yeah\nyeah that that's really interesting yeah\nI know\nso so I I\nI'm hearing that there's this kind of\nidea that people become nobodies and\nthat they want to be somebody's I wonder\nif that kind of ties into humiliation\nand public humiliation\num can you tell us like just stories of\nI'm kind of curious like what do you\nwhen you say public humiliation like\nwhat kind of stuff are you talking about\nhmm\nit's I've got to be honest it's\ndifficult for me like a story pops up\ninto my head but I am always hesitant to\nhumanize some of these people even if I\ndo know their stories\num but I mean the the Baseline of one is\njust like a parent that humiliates their\nchild to show who's in control and it\nhappens over and over and over again\nthat's like a type but I also find it\ninteresting now that we're dealing with\npublic humiliation on a mass scale\nthrough social media and we have no idea\nhow that's affecting people that's\nreally interesting\nso what I'm kind of hearing you say is\nthat in your kind of observations of\nTrue Crime there's a difference between\neven one-on-one humility humiliation or\none-on-one\ninvalidation bullying whatever and then\nthis idea of humiliation I think\nalmost implies public right it implies\non a mass scale to be humiliated is to\nbe\nlike your identity or who you are has\nbecome devalued almost like globally yes\nand and then you know you've probably\nseen this a lot in trauma people will\nrepeat their trauma over and over and\nover again until they can take it back\nin another way and sometimes in these\nscenarios these people are like well I'm\ngoing to show you how much pain I'm in\nand I'm in control now and I'm in\ncontrol of all of you\nyeah so can you tell us a little bit\nabout that principle\nRose\nhuh\nyou know\nI would need him\nsure so so I mean\nokay let's talk about something else for\na second maybe we can get back to it\nanother major theme that you've talked\nabout is kind of the denial of anger\neither denial of anger by others or\ndenial of anger for yourself can you\ntell us a little bit about that\nsure\num God this comes in so many different\nforms\num everyone gets angry about something\nat some point maybe it's something that\nhappened in school maybe it's something\nthat a parent did to you and let's say\nyou go to your parent well if the parent\ndid that thing they they're just gonna\ndownplay it you know they don't want to\nfeel bad about any of that and now let's\nsay something happened to you in school\nyou go to the parent again and the\nparents um maybe a they had bad things\nhappen to them in school so they don't\nfeel any empathy for you and then maybe\nalso they just don't care or maybe\nthey're on drugs like there's so many\nways that denial of a child's emotions\ncan happen and they're kind of expected\nto just keep going\num oh I you know what I have a I have a\npersonal example of this\num when I was a kid I was raised in a\nvery very religious home and I had a lot\nof religious trauma around them when\nsomething bad would happen to me and I\nwould go to my parents and my\ngrandparents\num they would tell me to go to God or to\npray and and then they would tell me\nthey would pray for me or something and\nso in my household it was always God\nfirst maybe me second\num and and putting a kid on the back\nburner like that so much and just\ntelling them oh prayed away it'll be\nokay\num is a complete denial of things and to\nan extent I feel like it I have\ngratitude for it because I do think it\ncreated some resilience in me\num but overall it was not the best\ncourse of action but a lot of kids get\nthat kind of treatment\nand so so when when you were kind of uh\nand let me know if things get too\npersonal but so so what impact does that\ndid that have on you to sort of\nbe told to hey pray it away\nuh it made me feel like for my entire\nlife that I didn't matter and then my\nneeds didn't matter because every time I\nexpressed my needs clearly and my God\nsome people aren't able to express their\nneeds clearly but when I did they were\nnot met and so when that happens over\nand over and over a child rationalizes\nwith the best tools that they have\navailable in this world and it kind of\nworks backwards to this point of what\nhappened again it happened again well I\nmust not matter so I should stop and\nthat really is something that manifested\ninto my teens and my 20s and I lived my\nlife through that lens for a long time\nreinforcing that narrative and then you\nturn 30 and you have to undo it and it's\na lot of work and quite often you can't\ndo that work alone because when the\nworld has defined you in such a way and\nyou believe it\nyou can't undo that on your own\nyeah that's one of the biggest things\nthat kind of frightens me I've um been\ndoing more and more research on\nthe Mental Health crisis for lack of a\nbetter term it is a crisis and um you\nknow one of the things that I I think we\nkind of I'm starting to really\nappreciate that we sort of made a\nfundamental mistake in the way that we\nview the human mind\nso in medicine we think about\nillness is existing within you right so\nlike if I've got a kidney problem like\nit's a problem in my kidney if I've got\nheart heart let's say high blood\npressure hypertension\nthat's a problem in my blood vessels so\nwe sort of think about illness as\nsomething that exists within you and\nthen what we did in Psychiatry is we\nsort of said the same thing right we're\nlike okay so you can have a problem with\nyour heart you can have a problem with\nyour liver you can have a problem with\nyour GI system you can have a problem\nwith your brain that's neurology you can\nhave a problem with your mind that's\npsychiatry\nbut I think the more that we're\nlearning I think the more I'm realizing\nthat a healthy mind does not exist\nsimply within one body a healthy mind is\nreally built through relationships\nand if we sort of look at Humanity like\nwe're kind of tribal right so a lot of\nour mental well-being comes from outside\nof us and one of the more social\ncreatures absolutely and one of the most\ndevastating things is that even when I\nmake kind of content right where people\nlike how do I fix this the really scary\nthing is that I'm not sure that\nthe way that problems are fixed can\nsolely be done by you and in fact I\nwonder if we've actually done people a\nhuge disservice by telling them hey if\nyou are mentally ill this is something\nfor you to fix because then what happens\nis that it sort of places the\nresponsibility on them and I think\neveryone has some degree of\nresponsibility but then if you fall\nshort\nthen it becomes your fault again which\ncan then you know repeat the cycle and\nand push the narrative that you believe\neven further into you right which is\nthat you're to blame yes and and so it's\nreally interesting but I I think a lot\nof what we're seeing and we're sort of\nseeing epidemiologic data as well that\nas human beings become disconnected\nmental problems get worse\nand and the real challenge there and I\nthink what's really kind of paralyzing\nand devastating about this is that\nI don't know that people themselves can\nfix everything on their own\nand what I'm really starting to really\nwonder about is how can we encourage\nsociety as a whole or other people to be\nresponsible for your mental health\nbecause I think that's really what it\ntakes and a big part of therapy I think\na big part of the value of therapy is\nthat you have another human being who's\nsaying okay your mental well-being is\nnow actually partially my responsibility\ntoo and that's I think half the\ntherapeutic value of of seeing a\ntherapist is that you've got someone\nelse who's like hey like I'm supposed to\nhelp you with this this isn't all on you\nyeah absolutely and you know and it's\nhard it's hard for some people to find\nthose friendships too especially now in\nsocial media when everyone's preaching\nlike oh that's his problem or you know\nyou go fix yourself I don't have the\nenergy for this or anything I'm a firm\nbeliever that you know as you expand\nyour friend group or maybe you're close\nwith people in your family take on three\nor four people that you're gonna\ndedicate yourself to caring about like\ntruly and it can go as simple as like\nreally understanding a friend if you\nhave a friend that had a long history of\nneglect like just responding to their\ntext messages now and then or even\ngiving them an update like hey I'm super\nbusy right now but I'd love to chat with\nyou later or a person that is very like\ntouch starved or never was told like I\nlove you give them a hug tell them I\nlove you know how those four people\noperate and\njust a couple friends can really really\nheal somebody I'm I'm I love telling my\nfriends I love them so much because\nthose emotionally detached [ __ ] need\nit so bad\nalso I'm so sorry for cursing\nit's we're on we're on Twitch I think\nwe're it's fair game\nhey so so that's really great I really\nlike your kind of guide to being a good\nfriend so it is respond to texts texts\nor even give them a heads up if you're\nnot responding\ngive them a hug\nyeah what were the other things what do\nyou think makes a good friend how do we\nbe good friends today\num how do we be good friends I love that\nwell one understand your friend that's\nthe first thing really listen and not\nonly don't understand don't be scared\nokay like\nplan to tackle this friendship\nfearlessly the interesting thing is\nyou're really traumatized friends they\nwill tell you exactly what their biggest\ntrauma is people that are super\ntraumatized they just they just like\ndump it you know they trauma dump it and\noh man you know\na tool that we're not given enough is\ntelling that person so often when\nsomebody tells you something really bad\nyou just want to be like\num I'm sorry that happened and change\nthe subject or something or it's like\nthese surface level things\num I'm trying to think of some specific\nones when somebody tells you something\nreally traumatic or something really\nreally bad that happened you should say\nsomething like\nI bet in that moment you were really\nscared or I bet in that moment you felt\nextremely betrayed and a lot of times\nthat person doesn't feel as alone in\nthat pain anymore that's what trauma\nfeels like you feel like you're alone in\nthis emotion in this bubble that no one\ncan understand and if one person can\njust articulate like oh my God it must\nhave been so horrible that they ignored\nyou like that the other person finally\nfeels validated for the first time and\nthey say oh my God yeah that was messed\nup and it's it's so much better than I'm\nso sorry that happened you know like\nthat almost does nothing for that person\nso I think listening to them\nunderstanding what they're hurt by\nrepeating it back to them and then being\nthere for them and continuing to listen\nand repeat stuff back to them as you\nlisten\nthat is one of the biggest healing\nthings that you can do for people\num and then from there as you're able to\nidentify where their pain lies because\nwhen you repeat it back you say I'm\nsorry you were betrayed I'm sorry you\nwere ignored you're saying exactly where\nthat hurt is right and if you can find a\npart of yourself that can nourish that\nlike don't stab them in the back and\nmake sure they know that you're gonna\ntake care of them\num listen to them if they were always\nmisunderstood like as a kid or pay\nattention to them when you can if they\nwere always neglected like in just\nit's okay to give a little piece of\nyourself to people that you care about\nlike it's it's okay like we don't all\nhave to be selfish all the time\nyeah that's I sounds like you're an\namazing friend Bose\num I'm an annoying friend I call my\nfriends all the time another big thing\nthat I have is that I wish more people\ndid is like when you're in like your\nteens or your 20s you should make an\neffort to connect with people that you\nlike like text them randomly call them\nbuild a relationship because when you're\nin your 30s you're gonna be so happy you\nhave that friend\num I have a group of like I would say\ndude I have like\nseven best friends or something and\nthese are relationships that I've built\nup over like seven or ten years by\nputting in the effort by being there for\nthem and also communicating with them\nand showing them that I care about them\nand not taking it personally if they\ndon't pick up the phone or answer a text\nI'll just keep coming back\nit sounds wonderful sounds like you've\nbuilt some really nice friendships that\nreally sustain you and that you've\nsustained other people over the last\ndecade or so\ndo you have a sense of how you got\nstarted with that right so I can\nunderstand that like you're talking\nabout you know seven to ten years but a\nlot of people nowadays just have\nstruggle struggle to get started\nyeah that's true a lot of these were\na lot of them were um internet\nfriendships almost all of them every\nsingle one and I'm pretty emotionally\ndetached person or I was a lot in my 20s\nand so I would\num often connect with other emotionally\ndetached people and so the internet was\nlike our barrier where we didn't get too\nclose but over time\num by like always talking we wanted to\nbe closer to each other and then um\nwe the best way to describe it was\nwe never let I never let moments of\ndiscomfort ruin an entire friendship I\nsee those as an opportunity to make the\nfriendship even stronger and\nI don't know I feel like I'm always I\nfeel like I'm still all over the place\nin this I can just no no I asked this\nstuff Dr Kane I love talking about it no\nthat's that's great so so let's let's is\nit okay if we talk about like\nfriendships and in relationships for a\nminute\nso in those moments of discomfort our\nnatural inclination is to like retreat\nfrom them right because we don't like\nbeing uncomfortable\nand um\nhow do you manage those moments of\ndiscomfort\num\nwhen I feel uncomfortable\nI used to just be like ah shut it down\nI'm going to turn this other way\num\nand instead what I do is I tell myself\nthat I'm uncomfortable I try to feel it\nin my body and under and become okay\nwith feeling uncomfortable because that\njust happens\nand I think about what I want and what I\nI want at the end of this so like if my\nfriend and I are having a disagreement\nand it makes me uncomfortable I let it\nhappen I feel it and I say like do I\nwant to continue a friendship with this\nperson if the answer is yes it's how do\nI do that you know and chances are that\nperson is also feeling uncomfortable too\num and if two people are uncomfortable\nyou're both going to run away but if one\nof you can fight for the Friendship\num it shows the other person how much\nyou care about them and it if you can\nwork through it it really builds\nsomething and that's also how you get\nthese unbreakable friendships that's\nreally important\nyeah\ncan I just process that for a second\nyeah absolutely I love it by the way I\nthink it's brilliant okay so here's what\nI love about that\nso if we kind of look at it we have two\nkinds of relationships the relationships\nwhere they're going to be moments of\ndiscomfort and relationships where there\naren't going to be moments of discomfort\nthe wall of the internet and if you have\na relationship with someone where\nthere's a wall between you\nit's always going to stay shallow\nbecause it's getting through those\nmoments of discomfort that allows you to\ndeepen a relationship so I see a lot of\npeople have this problem where it's like\nall of my relationships feel shallow so\nwhat can you do about that\nthat's the tricky thing is that you're\ngoing to have these moments of\ndiscomfort and the Very things that\ngive you the opportunity to deepen the\nrelationship you feel uncomfortable they\nfeel uncomfortable and both you all want\nto retreat\nso in order to get through that I think\nyou've laid it out really well so the\nfirst thing is to acknowledge and be\naware of the fact that you are\nuncomfortable so oftentimes discomfort\nwe just react to it or we're controlled\nby it we don't even realize that it's\nhappening the discomfort makes us think\nabout leaving so all we're focused on is\nleaving we don't even realize okay why\ndo I want to leave in the first place\nbecause I'm uncomfortable yeah and even\ngoing back to what you were saying\nearlier\nif we think about what helps people with\ntheir emotions validating their emotions\nhelps naming the emotion helps right so\nin that moment if you say to yourself\nI'm uncomfortable what you're actually\ndoing is naming the emotion validating\nthe emotion and supporting yourself\nthrough it\nyeah and if you're a person that had a\nparent that either didn't validate your\nemotions because they didn't want to or\nhonestly some parents didn't know how to\nvalidate their own emotions because they\nweren't taught to right so now you're a\nhuman being that has never been\nvalidated before you don't know how to\nyou don't even feel like you're worthy\nof validating your emotions\nthird that's that's hard and I try to\ntell people all the time like you were a\nhuman you are going to have emotions and\nyou need to figure out your top three\nemotions that you have all the time and\nfigure out an action plan for those\nbecause otherwise you're gonna struggle\nlike in in in in it's it's okay to take\ncare of yourself just because somebody\ndidn't take care of you and your\nemotions in the past doesn't mean that\nyou're not worthy of it and you should\njust lay there and freeze you know\num and and that that's a that's a deep\ncut and the thing is it's just it's so\nhard for some people to get to that\npoint and\nyou're right we have a mental health\ncrisis and it makes me so sad\nwhat makes you sad about it\num\nit makes me\nit makes me sad because I think about\nhow much I struggled with my emotions\nwhen I was in my early 20s\nand just not knowing what was going on\nbut I was in the thick of it like the\ndespair the immense pain the the fear\nthe everything and I'm not like that\nanymore\nand um I mean of course there's still\npangs of it right like that's that's how\nI grew up but um I I feel so sad for my\npast self\num and I when I think about other people\nlike not being able to identify those\nemotions and climb through them and get\nto the other side because it's so\nbeautiful on the other side it makes me\nsad I think I'm I'm sad for my former\nself too because that that girl was\ngoing through it she was she was she was\ngetting it and she was putting herself\nin bad situations all because she\nthought she deserved it and there's so\nmany people that walk the earth that\nfeel that way and um they don't deserve\nit they just they everyone deserves to\nbe treated well\ndo you feel comfortable sharing a little\nbit more about 20 year old you and how\nshe wound up in situations\noh my gosh probably a lot of drinking\na lot of a lot a lot of drinking to like\nnumb it away or like uh number waste\nsocial anxiety\num that was the thing I think also\num\nbeing angry and like not knowing what I\nwas angry about\num\nI told you I told you this briefly that\nlike I won't get into like the specific\nthing but\num giving you a little like backstory on\nme a couple years ago about five years\nago I had a therapist where I'm I'm\ntalking to this guy and also this guy\nended up being mad weird because he\neventually closed down his practice and\nhe opened up a modeling agency inside of\nthem\nand you're yeah and so the guy ended up\nbeing really weird I didn't love him and\nsometimes you have a crappy therapist\nokay I you know what can I ask you a\nchat a question one in the chat if\nyou've ever had a not great therapist\nbefore I think it's important to\nunderstand that that's a common\nexperience and it's that's not the bulk\nof therapy right but so this guy there\nit is there's the woods so this guy he\ntold me at one point he was like it\nsounds like you have PTSD and he just\nsaid it like that and I was like\nI don't like I said earlier that's for\nWar veterans that's for that's not for\nme I I didn't accept this diagnosis you\nknow and I just I went on and eventually\nwent to like another therapist and um\nyou know I just I just did talk therapy\nwith her and in retrospect it was a lady\nthat I went through insurance it was\ntwenty dollars per visit real nice lady\nfelt nice to talk about my day I didn't\nget much out of it I'm sure a lot of you\nguys have also had therapists like that\ntoo right and then I get to like the\nnext lady okay and\nI you know accepted that I had PTSD I\nyou know we started working through that\nwith a lot of tools a lot of\nre-parenting your inner child some EMDR\nda da da and then one [ __ ] day okay\nDr K I\num\nfor lack of a better term I had a I had\na a like a\nman I had a I had a Dark Night of the\nSoul with a friend I'll call it that and\num I I really had connected with her and\nI did the thing where I said something\nabout like trauma dumping and I randomly\ntold her about a story that\njust I don't know I just I just randomly\ntold it and then she said to me like\nthat's really [ __ ] up and it slowly\nstarted to uncover this\num horrifying to say the very least\nmemory that has defined my entire life\nand my brain as a child could not\nprocess that this happened to me and so\nit locked it away in a little tiny box\nbecause eight-year-old me couldn't\nhandle that and uh I realized how\nhorrible this thing was and this was\nabout maybe two or three years ago and I\nstarted to comb through it and I just\nthink this is really interesting to\nshare and\nwhat happens with repressed memories\nlike that or at least what happened for\nme was after this really terrible thing\nhappened and I'm a child about an hour\nlater something else really really bad\nhappened and so I took all the it but it\nwasn't quite as bad but I took all of\nthe emotion from the major event and I\nchalked it up to it must have been this\nother thing and for many many years I\nfelt like this this thing that had\nhappened was so much worse than it was\nand I could never pinpoint it but it's\nbecause of what had happened prior and\nso after I uncovered that memory\num and I started working through with\nthrough that with a therapist through\nEMDR redoing the memory having it\nuncharged I realized what I was really\nmad about and what I was really so upset\nabout my entire [ __ ] life\nlike my entire life I was waking up in\nthis room and reacting to this emotion\nwhenever I would feel little pings\nbecause what PTSD does is you you think\nthat it takes you into a flashback of a\nmemory but it takes you back into the\nemotions of that memory so I would have\nrandom times through my day where they\nwould be because I had multiple triggers\naround this memory maybe four or five so\nif one of those would happen I would\nhave all of the intensity of everything\nthat I felt like that day happen all\nover again and I didn't know why I was\njust reacting to that emotion all over\nagain and it was crazy and so\num well I say all of this to say the\nmajor thing that has changed my entire\nlife is figuring out how that memory has\ndefined my life I believe that everyone\nhas a major inciting trauma whether it's\nthe death of a parent whether it could\nbe an assault it could be a it could be\na bad relationship with a parent that\ncauses severe C PTSD but you have to\nfigure out what your major defining and\nciting thing is and stop living through\nthat narrative and treat it and release\nthat anger release that fear release all\nof those emotions\nbecause otherwise it's almost like your\nbrain is trying to remind you of the\nmemory constantly in random ways because\nit hasn't forgotten what's your take on\nthat\noh I love everything that you have to\nsay can I just think for a second yeah\nabsolutely\nokay\nso let's understand a couple of things I\nthink you got I mean I don't disagree\nwith a single thing you said I'm just\ngonna try to put it together in a\nslightly different way\nso first of all I'm I'm with you 100\nthat a lot of people don't realize that\ntrauma is\nnot specific to even a single event\nright so if we think about the war\nveteran we think something really bad\nhas to happen to you in order for you to\nbe traumatized and that's true but they\ndon't it doesn't have to be a single\nevent it can be something like a\nrelationship that's built over time\nother thing just simple statistic\n30 of 36 percent of the population\nhas not had something called an adverse\nchildhood experience\nso if we take a step back there was\nrecently a study that suggested that\ndepression is not caused by serotonin\nimbalance there isn't a neurochemical\nimbalance that causes something like a\nmood disorder\nso the question becomes okay what causes\nthings like chronic depression and it\nturns out that chances are it's\nsomething like these adverse childhood\nexperiences which over sixty percent of\nthe population has had so first thing to\nunderstand is that this bad stuff is way\nmore common we're talking two-thirds of\npeople have experienced it and I think\nthey go through similar things that you\nwent through where you denied your\ntrauma right you were like oh like it's\nnot that bad\nother people have it worse I'm not a war\nveteran therefore I can't be traumatized\nother people have it worse is the worst\nthing that anyone can say to us and\nanything we can say to ourselves it's\nthe worst yeah\nand and so then I think you also said it\nreally well that that what when you get\ntriggered it's really confusing for\npeople because people assume that the\ntrigger is an event that matches the\nprior event but really the experience of\na trigger doesn't have to be a flashback\nthat's what we saw with War veterans\nwhat you're really really triggering I\nlove the way that you said it is the\nemotional experience\nso the experience for a lot of people\nwith trauma is that they go through life\ngetting these like\nrandom emotional experiences injected\ninto benign normal circumstances\nI'm going\nI was gonna say and then what ends up\nhappening is you have this really\nemotional person and then the person on\nthe other end is scared of you or like\nthinks that you're being too much I\nalways try to talk about the too much\nwound we could talk about that after\nthis or something but they make you feel\nlike you're too much and so then the\nperson like represses everything and\nthen they deny themselves even more\nbecause the the person that they're\ntalking to in the current moment they\ndon't realize the person somewhere else\nand ugh yeah it makes me so sad\nabsolutely I mean yeah so I'm I'm gonna\nkind of go back to this um this uh\ntaking I mean why we repeat things so so\nthen what happens is you're carrying\naround all this emotion you've got to\nfix it right so like let's understand\nthe brain for a second and the brain has\nthis function called counter factual\nthinking which is one of the most\nimportant functions that we have when we\nmake a mistake our brain is able to go\nback in time and think to ourselves okay\nwhat could we have done differently so\nthat we did not make this mistake if our\nbrain did not have this capacity human\nbeings would not be where we are today\nso we can like hypothesize and fix\nproblems so we don't mistake do them\nagain so now what we've got to think\nabout is okay\nthe more traumatic the experience is the\nmore important it is for us to learn how\nto not have that happen again we need to\nmake sure for survival reasons that we\ncan fix this problem\nand so how does the brain assure itself\nthat we can fix this if it comes around\na second time we just keep on recreating\nit right that's what we do because this\nis the most important thing so okay like\nI'll give you just a simple example I\nwas abandoned\nit is a bad idea to be abandoned it was\nit was very painful [ __ ] me up\nwe got to make sure that we're not going\nto get abandoned again\nso you know what we're gonna do we're\ngoing to find the person who is the most\nlikely to abandon us\nand if we can conquer them if we can\nfigure out this perfect situation where\nthey will never abandon us that's right\nthen we don't have to fear abandonment\nanymore\nthat's right if I can fix it once and\nfor all they stay and we use everything\nwe've learned if if I can climb Mount\nEverest I never have to worry about\nclimbing Another Mountain so what I'm\ngonna do is I'm gonna instead of\nclimbing these four thousand foot hills\nI'm gonna find Everest after Everest\nafter Evers\nand if I can climb them then I don't\nhave to worry about anything and so\nthere's this bundle of random emotions\nthere's this bundle of like deep in your\nmind the whole point is you also\nmentioned how memories are repressed so\nit's really confusing to the person\nwho's living through this because all\nthis circuitry is working in your brain\nwithout your knowledge there's random\nass emotions random ass suppression and\njust repetition of the same behaviors\nover and over and people just feel so\nout of control\nand also but to an extent they kind of\nfeel good because this person is\nfamiliar to them but I always talk about\nwe have to decide is this person good\nfamiliar or are they bad familiar often\nwe're very attracted to the bad familiar\nbecause we want to redo it but we feel\nsafe because and I'm going to put it\nbluntly it's like this person neglected\nme almost like my mom did this person uh\ngaslit me almost the way my dad did and\nit feels it feels like you deserve it so\nyou continue it even though it hurts it\nalso feels comfortable and it feels\nfamiliar you're not and these are the\nsame people that are uncomfortable with\nsomeone saying I love you or hugging you\nbecause they never got that so they\ndon't know how to process it\num can I say a little something about\nabandonment issues my favorite\num okay wait can I ask your chat a\nquestion again sure okay sorry Dr K okay\ncan I wait okay one in the chat if you\nhave abandonment issues if you don't I\nwant to see the twos because I have a\nfeeling that we'll have an overwhelming\nnumber of ones and I think this is like\na real like almost\nlike almost so many people do but it's\nlike the real question is do you have\nthe hyper vigilance of the abandonment\nissues where you're self-sabotaging\nbeforehand to avoid it right\num one thing that I had to learn and I\nkind of talked about this before is I\nwas terrified of Abandonment because it\nhappened over and over and over again\nand it hurt more every time and every\ntime it said to me I'm not worth it I'm\nnot\njust so many different things right\nthere's a lot of things that we tell\nourselves\num\nwhen I when I identify a situation where\nI'm being abandoned because often it's\neasier to identify that they've left\nbefore the feeling like they both kind\nof come at once and it's really intense\nand we just want to shut it down and get\naway sometimes take the power back leave\nfirst\nwhat I kind of have to do is\nonce again I would take that deep breath\nand I would say this is abandonment and\nI let it flow through my body and like\neven now I can feel it like it's in my\nchest it's somewhere here in my stomach\nand when you let yourself feel it it\ngoes through your shoulders and it goes\nall through your body and just kind of\ndown to your stomach\nand what happens is when we kind of\nstart to feel it here we want to push it\naway we want it to stop\num like and we try to stop it anyway but\nif you let it flow through you\nand you just take deep breaths and you\ntell yourself like this is abandonment\nand you sit in the feeling\num that's really what you have to do\nbecause you have to learn to be Fearless\nabout the things that hurt you and you\nhave to accept that they're part of the\nhuman experience and you just have to\nlet it be and and be comfortable with\nevery emotion that scares you because\notherwise you'll live your life reacting\nto them\num and that gets you in a lot of trouble\nyeah but Bose\nI don't I want to run away from it right\nisn't running away from bad things good\nuh well\nso there's a couple there's a couple\nlayers in decision making right there's\nthe inciting event then there's the\nemotion you feel\nand then the emotion actually tells you\nwhat decision you want to make and so if\nyou can't work through the emotion\nyou're not able to get to the decision\npart so you end up missing a lot of\nopportunities in life in in doing things\nor having connections with people or\ngoing after things that you want because\nthe emotion is so overwhelming you push\nit away\nand so you have to ask yourself\nif you really want to it sounds corny\nbut live the life you want because\notherwise if you're constantly reacting\nto the emotions you'll never make the\ndecision and you have to feel the\nemotion to make the right decision\nbecause you know what you want does that\nexpense Dr K it makes perfect sense I\nthink I always feel like I'm just like a\nwoman in a box rambling and that's\nwhat if you feel like you're a woman how\nare you feeling right now\num okay well you know what I mentioned\nthe too much wound I can go in a rant\nabout that\ndon't stop going on rants why the [ __ ]\ndo you keep on invalidating the value\nthat you bring to this conversation\nbecause because I I'm a woman rambling\nit up in a box better you're not a woman\nrambling in a box you're spitting truth\nseriously\nit's funny that's funny you say that\nthank you thank you yeah\nright\num yeah I have the uh I have the the too\nmuch wound where uh I don't know if\nanyone else has ever felt like they're\ndoing too much they're saying it too\nmuch they're being too much they're\nthinking too much\num I've had that for a very long time\nand clearly I still struggle with it a\nbit and I think that comes from you know\nlike having once again a parent all this\n[ __ ] is our parents like really you know\nand or the people that raise you or\nwhatever\num\nI would like talk or I would be myself\nand you know if you have like a very\ntired mother and they just they can't\nhandle it right now they go away and it\nmakes you think like I need to be calm\nand I need to repress myself if I want\nto be in the presence of others\num and I yeah I definitely have that and\nand I I hope you guys if anyone else has\nthat wound you should know that you're\nyou're not too much as a person you're\ndefinitely not too much just that person\ncouldn't handle it and they kind of set\nthe narrative and you should know you\nare like you're you're you're\nI I always tell people they have that\nlike I can't get enough of you I love it\nI want more like you're not too much\num but yeah I have that and I still work\nthrough it and it's difficult I I'm\ndetecting a lot of Happiness from you\nright now\nI'm happy that I don't think about\nmyself that way as much anymore because\nit was um I didn't deserve that and it\nwas I was very hard on myself\nyeah I think the wound of too much comes\nfrom and I love the way that you name\nthese by the way these are great I can\ndo a lecture on each and every one of\nthese\num but the the wound of too much I think\ncomes from when children are taught to\nbe small\nchildren are to be seen and not heard\nright so you need to be and and there's\nthere's like you said there's too much\nof you so like what are you you're\nsupposed to be smaller you're supposed\nto be like you know in a box and and now\npose you're you're smiling and laughing\nand and talking and that's not what\nyou're supposed to be doing you're\nsupposed to be listening\nyeah and and I seriously I think that\nthere's there's\num\nyeah I mean just so much about what\nyou're saying sounds like wisdom\nyou're wise\nI don't I okay I'm listen I'm better Dr\nK but I'm not good I'm I'm not mentally\nwell enough to accept that like I still\nyeah so see I mean I I hate to break it\nto you but you're kind of digging\nyourself into a hole here Bose because\nlook at how well you articulated your\ninsecurities and you're saying hey like\nI'm not ready to accept that I have\ngained wisdom and like that in and of\nitself is like do you see\nyou're like you're not just reflexively\npushing it away You're owning your\ninability to accept it\num\ntoo I think I listened I didn't okay I\nthink I also have a wound where I felt\nlike I wasn't allowed to be confident\nand I fear confidence I think that's a\nthing too\num so but I will thank you\nthank you what do you what do you fear\nabout confidence\nwhat's scary about confidence that's\ninteresting\num this the feeling is almost the fear\nis almost similar to abandonment where I\nfear if I'm too confident then someone\nwill knock me down\nand and when people try to knock you\ndown they knock you down hard real hard\nand they think they try to make sure\nthat you don't get back up and that um\nthat's scary you know I have a I'm of\ncourse you know all the trauma responses\nfight flight freeze I have a collapse\nand submit response and so when I'm\nbeing hurt too much I I get I get down\non the floor and\num I stay there\nI play dead\nthat that's you know it's unfortunate\nbut very true that\nhmm\nhow do I respond to that can I think for\na second\nhow would you think\nhmm\nI mean so I guess we can start with you\nknow the idea of collapsing is actually\na survival mechanism\nright so when someone is trying to knock\nyou down if you stand up\nthey're gonna try as you said harder\nright because getting knocked down hurts\nso what is the one thing you can do\nto minimize the pain of someone trying\nto put you in your place is to go there\non your own\nyou're trying to knock me down I'm just\ngoing to lay down on the floor I was\njust lay down right so I'm Gonna Knock\nmyself down because at least when I'm\nknocking myself down I can control the\nfall\nI'm still in control of it I\nI rest back some control you can't hurt\nme if I if I hurt myself\nright right right and\nyou know it this is this is still a\ntrait that I work through I I believe um\nI believe that we all have tools growing\nup that get us to a point and slowly\nthrough life we trade out our old rusty\ntools for new ones and you know we get\nthe new ones we put them in our tool kit\nbut then we slowly have to learn when to\nuse them and like when to pull them out\nyou know and\num the collapse and submit has been my\nresponse since childhood because it was\nlike if you resist we will persist you\nknow and so I had to do that but what I\nfind now as an adult you know all\nthrough my 20s and I'm 31 now I learned\nthat I was missing opportunities to gain\nrespect and to stand up for myself\nbecause I was collapsing and submitting\nall too often and so um now I'm really\nworking through\nthose emotions so I can learn when to\nstand up for myself when to advocate for\nmyself and when to let things pass and I\ndo this by always asking\nlet me use this emotion that I'm feeling\nin this scenario to tell me what I want\nand then I will try to make that happen\nI don't know if this makes sense\nyeah it makes it makes a lot of sense\ndoes it help when I say it makes a lot\nof sense\nbecause it's very validating I\nappreciate you know it really does so\nthe one thing that I would sort of shift\naround a little bit I love your tool\nbelt analogy and uh but you know I think\nso one of my supervisors once told me\nthat the process of growing up is the\nprocess of discarding what works\nso in my experience working with people\nyou're saying okay we're tossing out\nthis Rusty tool for a shiny new one I\nwould actually say it's the other way\naround we have a very well-functioning\nwell-oiled lubricated tool that is at\nthe top of the line of peak efficiency\nand we have to get rid of it for\nsomething that's Rusty and deconditioned\nso the collapse response getting rid of\nthat is hard that you're not upgrading\nyou're actually the process of growing\nup is downgrading because now you have\nto learn something that you don't know\nhow to use\nand the efficiency of your upgrade tool\nis actually really inefficient\nand so it's really bizarre but I mean I\nthink that's why it's so hard to\novercome these things not because\nthey're non-functional the exact\nopposite they're very functional that's\nwhy people keep [ __ ] drinking and\ngetting high if they feel socially\nanxious because it works really well not\nbecause it works poorly I love your\nanalogy of saying that they're actually\nshiny wonderful tools because when I\nthink about it like back in the day well\nright now the collapse and submit tool\nit's at the top of the hierarchy the\nhandle is clean it's smooth it's even\nwell defined it fits perfectly in my\nhand the blade is shiny and sharp like\nit's so beautiful that's the way that\nalcohol and cigarettes used to look\num\nso yeah it's like why not grab the\nsecret weapon that solves all right\nand it's it's hard it's hard to put her\ndown and then when you stop using it as\nmuch it does get rusty and it does get\nold yeah and that's what we want right\nso as we start using new tools so I've\nnoticed that you've developed a really\ngood shiny articulation of your internal\nemotional state and body awareness of\nhow emotions affect your physiology\nwhich is also great because\npart of the reason that emotions are so\noverwhelming is they exist in the mind\nand the body but in the west we try to\nhandle them exclusively with the mind\nand so what we're actually doing is\nwe're trying to conquer these emotions\nwith one hand tied behind our back\nbecause we're working fully in in the\nmental Realm\nit blows my mind uh one one of the best\nforms of therapy I had was\num what is it the somatic kind of body\nsystematic experiencing or tapping or\nEFT or whatever I couldn't believe how\nmuch when remember when I said I would\ngo back to like the memory and the\nfeeling and all that my body posture\nwould go back to the way that I felt\nthere making myself small it would be in\nmy shoulders and I had to consciously\nwhen I felt that emotion oh my God and\nit's hard to release the shoulders and\nfeel like I deserve to release the\nshoulders and let myself be open and\nvulnerable my God was it hard it was\ndisgusting I was screaming the whole way\nthrough like just thinking like just to\nrelease my shoulders when I'm feeling\nthat emotion so when you start to train\nyour body to do the opposite of what\nit's been sinking with your brain for so\nlong that's actually the first step to\nreleasing a lot of those emotions\nactually I forgot about that but that\none is so [ __ ] that one's so\ncomplicated dude that you need to you\nneed a specialist for that well Oh you\nmean about the the emotional freeing\nstuff like exactly yeah like letting it\nout of your body um there's a lot of it\nyou know and there's a lot of people\nthat have survived like assault that\ndon't realize how because how that's\naffected your posture and the way you\nhold yourself and how you carry that and\nhow those postures are connected to the\nbrain constantly constantly and when\nyour body goes into that state your mind\ngoes into that state too\num I think that that's a great therapy\nfor like assault survivors but it pisses\nme off that so often we send them to a\ntherapist that's on the insurance plan\nthat's just going to talk to them and\nnot do any EMDR no somatic work no\nnothing dude oh yes okay can you can you\nshare a little bit about what you found\nto be helpful and in what ways you found\nit to be helpful because it sounds like\nyou've tried a lot of different stuff so\ncan we just talk about those\nabsolutely\num so\na lot of you guys have probably\nexperienced when you decide to finally\nget help you go through your insurance\nand you you know pay twenty dollars per\nappointment and you start talking to\nsomebody and it's not really for you I'm\ngonna be honest I don't know what you\nthink Dr cable a lot of times I think\nsome of those people just aren't paid\nenough to you know deal with a large\nroster of people that have a lot of big\nissues and then once again that person\nis left feeling like they're not\nhelpable like the person doesn't care\nand um it's tough but then we have this\nother tier of Specialists and\nunfortunately the worst part is they\ncost more money they just do some of\nthem don't take insurance some do but\nyou really have to dig for them\num but when you get to these people we\nnow have trauma Specialists we have\nSpecialists that deal with like identity\nlgbtq issues we have Specialists that\ndeal with OCD totally different beats we\nhave Specialists that deal with\ndepression all of these things are\ntreated with different things like\num sorry there's so many different\nthings I I apologize do you recall with\na treatment for OCD is it's like ORD or\nor something\nsorry let me investigate this oh it's\nErp it's exposure and response\nprevention so they expose them to the to\nthe OCD thing and you know try to\ncontrol the responses this is a totally\ndifferent thing than just talking to\nsomebody about their day and for\nsomebody that's tortured by cycling OCD\nthoughts\num you really have to put a stop to that\ncycle and it's a different type of\ntherapy then we get to people that have\nsevere trauma with emotionally charged\nmemories there's EMDR where you can\nreplay the memory and charge it down and\nfinally also be validated for those\ntypes of things\num you have oh my gosh like you have\nidentity issues where people need to you\nknow go back to what the world told them\nand figure out for themselves like who\nthey are and they're Specialists that\ndeal with each part of these areas and I\nfeel like nobody talks about finding\nthem or like seeking out something\nspecific for what you're dealing with or\noh my God even something like grief like\nas a child losing a parent losing both\nparents and then not having a parent\nthat can give you the tools to work\nthrough that like so all all four of\nthese things I'm talking about are\ncompletely different than the 20 talking\ntherapists and we need specialized help\nfor everybody do you have questions for\nme I was just thinking that I was\nliterally just a good mask if I'm\nallowed to ask you questions yeah of\ncourse\num\nman\ndude what's the is there is there a\nparticular wound that you see most often\nin like Gamers like is there a\nconnecting force between us\num\nlike there's probably the you know like\nthe too much one probably isn't here is\nit like the confidence is it the social\nanxiety is it the you know so so I I\nthink that if we look at gaming\nthere are so not all gamers are the same\nI know it's insane\nbut there's a difference I mean there's\ngood Research into even showing that the\nkind of person who plays in fps is\ndifferent from the kind of person who\nplays a MOBA it's different from someone\nwho like\num plays stardew Valley we're just\nthey're different personalities one\nthing I would say is really common\namongst Gamers though is something that\nI would call The Logical red herring\nwhich is why they fail in therapy so\nsometimes if Gamers go to therapy what\nthey kind of discover that they'll\nthey'll do something that kind of like\nwhat you did\nso Gamers will go in they'll have some\ntraumatic event\nand then they'll have some other event\nthat they have logically deduced is the\nsource of their problems\nand so they'll come into therapy and\nthey'll say this is my problem\nand they'll talk about it and talk about\nit and talk about it and you don't ever\nget anywhere\nyou don't get to the big boulder that\nwas behind exactly so like what ends up\nhappening is they're like misdirecting\nit's like some kind of illusion magic\nwe're like I'm gonna like I'm gonna take\nmy repression and I'm gonna like make it\na problem and this is what determines my\nlife oh I like this happened or this\nhappened and so we end up getting stuck\nbecause they keep on pointing all of the\ntherapeutic energy at the wrong thing\nand the reason they do that is because\nthis hurts\nand I don't want anyone to know about\nthis so instead what I'm gonna do is\nconstruct a narrative because I'm so\n[ __ ] smart that fits what people go\nto therapy for\nand so you end up with this it's really\ninteresting but when I work with a lot\nof Gamers it sounds scripted\nit's like [ __ ] NPC dialogue level\nlike same thing over and oh yeah I'm so\ntired I'm so depressed I'm so I can't\nget out of bed I'm I'm A Gifted kid you\nknow like this and like\nand then it's it's like the same thing\nover and over and over again\nand it's all like this veil of [ __ ]\nand there's something else that is\nactually bothering them but the problem\nis that they're so smart\nand sometimes the therapists love it\nso I once had a patient\nwho was seen by like four or five\ntherapists\nand the person\nhad this act of being a repressed\nhomosexual\nhe's a really manly man\nand then all these therapists were like\noh my God he's just gay on the inside\nand that's the source of all I was\nsupposed it's all [ __ ]\nhe was just playing them like a fiddle\nlike he was just like and as long as\nthey kept on focusing on that the dude\nnever made progress\nhe wasn't even gay\nwhat was the thing did he ever oh you\nprobably can't say I I you know but it\nwas like it was a lot more bread and\nbutter\nit was like a lot more like hey I just\ndon't feel good about the person that I\nam so I have to pretend to be something\nelse and what I pretend to be which is a\nrepressed homosexual is something that\nall my therapists love\nright and so then now going back to this\nidea of like being a somebody\nbecause like plain old straight me ain't\ninteresting enough for the rest of the\nworld\nyeah or they feel like their problems\naren't valid you know they they feel\nlike nobody's gonna think this is a big\nissue right because it was so normal in\ntheir life I'm sorry I always go back to\nparents because this is like the easiest\nthing to go back to but it was so normal\nfor your parents to argue or for you to\nget treated like [ __ ] or to be treated\nlike you don't matter that you've\nnormalized it and you don't think it's a\nbig deal and then you find out other\npeople didn't have that experience and\nyou're like well wait but then you\ncompare your problems to other peoples I\nalways say though that it matters how\nthat problem affected you like if it was\na nine or a 10 in your world that's your\nnine or ten you don't need to compare\nyour nine or ten to somebody else's 10.\na 10 is a damn 10 you know so if it hurt\nit hurt and you're allowed to hurt dog\nno so I mean that that's that's exactly\nI've seen this with Gamers and this is\nkind of what happens right is I have a\nproblem that I don't think deserves a\n10. so instead what I'm gonna do is\nconstruct a problem that is worth a 10.\nand then what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to try to fix that problem because\nthere's no way that my life should be so\n[ __ ] up by this little thing that I\nwas unable to do and then everyone tries\nto end up fixing a fake problem\nthat feels like a 10. and so instead\nwhat you really got to do is get beneath\nall of that and start to realize hey\nthere's something else which is\na lot more mundane which is something\nthat you don't even think is a problem\nbecause it's something you should be\nable to do or should be able to fix\n[Music]\nyeah right and so that's that's like\nit's like this big red herring thing\nthat I see all the time because the\nproblem is they're so smart they do\ntheir research and this isn't just\nGamers it's like everyone nowadays it's\nlike kids of the information age are\ncoming in with like you know all of this\ninformation and sometimes that can be\nreally good like it's awesome to have\npatients who are very educated and can\ndo half the work for me\nbut sometimes they're also really wrong\nyeah they're going pulling stuff from\nsocial media and yeah and I mean and\nthis is this is and the reason for that\nis because if you think about like how\ndoes mental health content succeed by\nbeing widely relatable\nand so people will say like these are\nthe 16 signs or here are the six signs\nof autism and it's like six of those\nsigns are also they can exist in autism\nbut they also exist for normal people\nand so we're seeing an over\npathologization if that's a word\nof like generally like normal human\nexperience and you know what's killing\nme about it is that then especially from\nan early age a person takes on a certain\ntitle and then they make that title part\nof their identity your mental health\nissue is actually not a part of your\nlike a full-fledged part of your\nidentity like you are so much more than\nthis thing that makes you quirky or\nemotional or upset or something and then\nthey just fully pull that into their\nidentity and lean more into that instead\nof finding out who they are and what\nthey like and what they want to do\num oh it makes it bums me out so much\nI'm I've always been\num I I do accept that I have a PTSD\ndiagnosis but I always look at the\nsymptoms like almost line by line and I\ntry to treat the symptoms rather than\nidentifying with the whole shebang and\njust taking that in you know\num but you know sometimes I will say too\nat the same time putting a title to that\npain actually alleviates a lot of it too\nit's just I don't think you should go\ntoo far with it yeah I think I'd\nI'd Echo that basically 100 so what I've\nseen is that\nsometimes we go through life and\nlife is hard\nand you look around and it's easy for\neverybody else\nand then one day you discover oh crap\nthere is a whole pile of people who\nactually struggle in exactly the same\nway that I do and there's a word for it\nholy crap it can be eye-opening yes I\nsee this the most often with diagnoses\nlike ADHD and autism spectrum where it's\nlike other people just know how to\nempathize I don't know how to do that\nwhen I go into social situations it's\nlike a puzzle that has to be solved if\nthey move this chess piece over here I\nhave to move this chest piece over here\nit becomes so burdensome because I can't\nfeel it\num so sometimes it can be absolutely\nliberating to understand oh okay like\nI'm maybe I'm not neurotypical but I\nalso see the exact thing that that\nyou're kind of talking about where I see\nthis a lot with with teenagers\nespecially who have\ngender identity or sexuality issues\nwhere they don't quite know who they are\nand so then what they do is if I don't\nknow who I am I go and look for some\nkind of compass so I will go and adopt a\nlabel and I say okay like it looks like\nthese people are\nyou know let's say that I I don't have a\nwhole lot of sexual feelings then I\ndiscover okay there's this thing called\nthe ace Community or asexual and then\nyou decide okay like this seems like it\nfits me and just like you said they take\nthat Ace identity and then they make it\na part of themselves and then instead of\nthem instead of the label fitting them\nthen they start to mold themselves to\nfit the label right I get what you mean\nI super get what you mean and then they\nstart defining aspects of their\ncharacter uh their character or their\npersonality based on this label and the\nreal tragedy there is that I think a\nwhole the whole point of a lot of this\ngender exploration sexuality exploration\nis that labels have led a lot of people\nto the wrong place\nand what I tend to find is also with\nthat sense of community you feel like\nyou have to go all in on it and you\ncan't walk back from it too yeah I mean\nit can be any Community I've seen I've\nseen so much\nanyway I don't want to go into it but\nand and so then I think ultimately what\nhappens is sometimes then people like\nshoot themselves in the foot like I I\nyou know we're having people who hit\npuberty a little bit late now\nidentifying as Ace Because by the time\nthey're 13 they just haven't hit puberty\nso like developmentally hormonally\nthey're like a 10 year old but now that\nI've become Ace now this is something\nthat defines me and then it's hard to\nmaintain that fluidity so I really found\nthat the best thing to do is like if\nsomething feels right go for it but you\ndon't have to let that thing Define you\nthe whole point of this whole\nexploration at least in my opinion this\nis is a CIS hat male okay so maybe it's\nnot as valid but is that the whole point\nis that you don't have to like we've\ndone so much damage with labels and you\njust be you\nand you don't have to own what other\npeople with that label own you're\nallowed you know play Hogwarts Legacy\neven if you're trans\nHere's a thought so I I've I've thought\nabout this before but I haven't fleshed\nit out too hard I think that there's\npeople that I think there's okay there's\nbigger groups but let's say there's two\ntypes of people just for the sake of\nthis conversation people that grew up\nhyper independent and without a\ncommunity and a commune like you just\nthey're just complete loners that are\nalways by themselves they tend to\ndevelop this extreme like very personal\nidentity they're usually very much\nthemselves because they spend a lot of\ntime alone but then we have these people\nthat are more social maybe they grew up\nin a big family maybe they were part of\na church they were always part of band\ngroup something like that so some people\nfeel a lot better being in a community\nespecially one that fits pretty well\nright and so if you're one of those\npeople that's hyper independent I feel\nlike you should know that or if you're\nsomeone that feels better having a coven\nyou know you should know that too and I\nI think that's I don't know if that\nmakes sense okay I did it again\nno I think it makes sense I just I just\nloved your use of the word coven\nI'm I'm I'm a covenless person I've\nalways been that way but I am not upset\nwhen I meet people that prefer to be in\na coven you know and I realize that\ndifference between ourselves and I don't\nknock them for feeling comfortable\ninside their coven I'm like yeah I'm\nlike go do your thing love that\nI like covens I don't know if I'm a\ncoven person but if I could reinvent if\nI could respawn and and pick a different\nclass I would definitely pick which\n[Laughter]\nthat's funny\num\nyeah I mean I I think uh yeah so you\nwere asking about Gamers and I think the\nthe simplest thing is I see this weird\nred herring Shenanigans you were gonna\nyou know what I would have thought the\nunderlying or one of the more common\nones would have been the addiction\naspect right\nso I I mean so yes and no so I think the\nthing about gaming addiction and we may\ndo a stream on Addiction on Friday\noh my God can you call me one day for an\naddiction stream because I got some\nstuff to say about that uh sure\nwe did a trauma stream last Friday and I\nthink you're a great it's lovely to have\nyour perspective but\nI think the basic problem with games is\nthat they\nfulfill our psychological needs in a way\nthat is more convenient than reality the\nproblem is that they fulfill them in a\nless complete way than reality\nso like we're sort of left with kind of\nthis like zombification of the\nFulfillment of our desires where it's\nnot like a full fulfillment it's like a\nhalf kind of fulfillment so I can feel\ngood about myself if I make a comeback\nin League of Legends but\nyou know I'm never going to be able to\nwalk into a room and people are like\nwhat do you do and I'm like I'm someone\nwho occasionally makes comebacks in\nLeague of Legends and feel good about\nyourself\nyou know like you're dating someone and\nyou meet their family or you meet their\nfriends they're like what do you do and\nit's like yeah I'm someone who\noccasionally makes comebacks in in this\nparticular game or occasionally I'm\nreally good at head shotting in CS go I\nthink we also get a little addicted to\nthe the confidence that we get from\nvideo games because we're not getting it\nfrom anywhere else absolutely we can\njust ignore the ignore the bad games\nblame someone else and then get to the\ngame where we're the starred and we're\nlike yeah yeah\nit's so easy to blame other people when\nwe play video games but so easy to blame\nourselves in real life oh yeah we're you\nknow it's like when we're playing games\nwe're we're just completely different\npeople we're a we're a version of\nourselves that we wish we were but we're\nnot doing a thing that we really wish we\nwere doing absolutely it's easy to be\nthe best version of ourselves when\nplaying game and the sad thing is it's\nalso easy\nwell I find it also like with the\ninternet and it was probably this way\nmore before there were so many people\nhere but if you're a person that\nconstantly feels powerless in your\nday-to-day life you get to go online and\ncreate your own little world where\nyou're in control of everything you\nclick what you want to click on you do\nwhat you want you you talk crap to\nwhoever you want you get to create the\nreality that you want in your own little\ninternet World\num and it gives people a little sense of\npower for a period of time that they may\nnot have in their Waking Life\nso people with trauma are actually very\nvulnerable to that\nit's me\nso this is kind of interesting but one\nof the earliest things you learn in\ntrauma is that\nanger\nis risky\nso insubordination\ncauses potential problems with your\nsurvival so what you see in in trauma\nresponses is that people learn to\ndisplace their anger into safe\nenvironments this is why kids who are\ntraumatized at school will bully the\nsmallest kid I mean sorry kids who are\ntraumatized at home will bully the\nsmallest kid in the class because I have\nall this anger\nwhat am I supposed to do with it I can\nsafely express it if I'm picking on a\nlittle kid\nyeah whereas if I get angry at my\nparents for being mean to me then I get\npunished\nthere's one place\nwhere I can safely Express anger and\nthere's basically no consequences which\nis the internet\nso I can rage on the internet all day\nlong I can rage about all these\ninjustices\nI can even rage at people I can get\nbanned and I can just make another\naccount I can get banned from one place\nI can go somewhere else and so I can go\non expressing this impotent rage\nand when I really stop and think about\nit\nokay so sixty percent of people have\nadverse childhood experiences and you\nhave so many angry people on the\ninternet who aren't doing anything with\nthat anger what is it I wonder if it's\njust this displacement of this classic\ntrauma response\nI mean truly and it you know I think\nsome people think that it's\nthey feel better releasing it but I\nthink it actually turns into just a\nbigger rolling ball I think that\nactivating that angry part of yourself\nand putting it out there it actually\ncreates a bigger anger that you almost\ndidn't have before like a bitterness too\nabsolutely I think the other problem\nthat we see is that kind of like how\nyou're talking about naming your\nemotions and owning your emotions\nanger is the most motivating emotion so\nif we kind of think about if someone\ndoes something bad to me and I feel\nashamed of myself how do I conquer that\nshame I use anger how dare you I'm gonna\nmake sure that this never happens to me\nagain this person thinks they're better\nthan me I'm gonna show them and it\nmotivates us and so what do we see right\nnow we're seeing all of the energy of\nanger curiosity can get you a little bit\nfor a little time but then it Fizzles\nout\nlove can get you pretty far but this is\na challenge because we don't have people\nthat we love today right\nand so instead there's one emotion that\nwe use to carve out our territory which\nwe're just displacing on random [ __ ] on\nthe internet and this is why everyone is\nstuck\nbecause they're not harnessing the anger\nwell I find dude one of the most one of\nthe another one of the biggest like\nlife-changing like therapy kind of\nthings that I had for myself was um I\nfound I would get angry quite often and\nwhat I found was underneath the anger\nthere was always another emotion it's\nnever anger anger there's always\nsomething underneath it and so when I\nwould feel anger I would let it flow\nthrough me it sounds so corny I know but\nyeah like I would let it flow through me\nand I would try to dig for whatever\nfeeling was underneath that anger and\nmaybe it was I was attention starved\nmaybe it was that I was feeling lonely\nmaybe it was that I felt like I didn't\nmatter maybe it felt like I was upset\nmaybe it felt like I was neglected it's\nanger is so fascinating because it's\nreally just a shield for our vulnerable\nemotions and if you dig if you dig deep\nenough through anger and you find out\nwhat's underneath there you'll find out\nso much about yourself\nbecause you're actually\nyou're actually probably reacting in a\nway that you don't want to react it's\njust like all you know\nyeah I mean I think there's there's good\nwe talk about that a fair amount I think\nit's a big part of also male mental\nhealth it's true of anger in general\nbut there's this uh term called\nnormative male alexithymia so\nalexithymia's inability to understand\nyour internal emotional state it's being\ncolorblind to your emotions man and the\nreason we call it normative male\nalexithymia is because men are\nculturally shaped to be colorblind to\nall emotions except for anger\nwow it's the only emotion we're allowed\nto express you can't cry but you're\nallowed to get pissed off right and so\nwhat we tend to find is I'm with you\nthat we call anger we do a lot of this\nkind of work around motivation and stuff\nin our coaching program\nwhere we work with anger as an umbrella\nmotion so it covers other emotions yes\nso if I'm afraid when someone breaks up\nwith me\nI get pissed man like oh like oh like\nyou know I say a lot of I'm assuming I'm\na male here for a second but in\nheterosexual so I'm mad at all these\nwomen right women can't be trusted in\nall this kind of stuff there's a whole\nsocietal movement there\nand really what's kind of underneath\nthat is like why do you get mad well\nwhat other feelings do you have well if\nthis person broke up with me like does\nthat mean that other people will break\nup with me does this mean I'm going to\nbe alone there's fear of loneliness\nthere's shame there's feelings of\nunworthiness if I was better would this\nperson not have dumped me there are all\nthese kinds of feelings but we don't\nknow all we know is we know how to get\npissed as long as we're pissed we don't\nhave to feel any of those things\nas long as we're pissed at someone\nelse's fault as long as we're pissed\nI don't have to change\nI think the other thing that's so\ninteresting is you mentioned this like\nso we have the anger we have the breakup\nand the breakup brings a lot of things\nabandonment fear insecurity and I don't\nknow what you would call this but for me\npersonally when I started working\nthrough this stuff is I would call these\ncomplex emotions where you have like\nfour different things working at once\nand how are you supposed to get anything\ndone when you're feeling for severe\nemotions at once I'm actually curious\nwhat what does fruit I'll tell you what\nI did but I'm curious what you think\nsomebody does when you're filling all of\nthese intense things at once what what\nthey do or what they should do what they\nshould do\nor do you want to say what they do first\nand then what they should do I mean what\nthey do is they get high they play video\ngames they watch stuff they scroll they\ndo scroll that literally right yeah so\nif we look at social media if we look at\nvideo games all of these things suppress\nour limbic system and amygdala so they\nliterally shot off the circuits of our\nbrain that experience negative emotion\nyeah that's what people do and that's\nwhy they do them because we're going\nback to our tool belt analogy this is a\nreally really good tool right it's like\nI queue up and then I'm not thinking\nabout anything except for how bad my mid\nplayer is\nman no I mean what people should do\num\nI mean I've helped tons of people with\nthis but I honestly think that\ndo you think that's a reaction that\nturning everything off is a reaction to\nsomething in their childhood like that's\nhow they handled it before just turn\neverything off even before they had the\nvideo games yes and no so I think what\ntends to happen because when you say\nbefore they had video games\nthere isn't a before video games time\nperiod anymore there's yeah they're\nthere from day one\num it's really scary I remember like my\ntwo-year-old was better at using an\nelect even 18 month year old was better\nat using an electronic device than my\nmom was oh my god\num but I think that one of the biggest\nthing the biggest thing that has to\nchange if you want to stop these\navoidance behaviors\nis you need to have a single experience\nwhere feeling the emotion does not\npunish you\nand that's why therapy is so important\nwhen I think about all of my patients so\nI I did I was a solid like addiction\npsychiatrist for like two or three years\nwhere that was a majority of what I was\ndoing\nso I worked at two rehabs had you know\nan office and stuff where I did\noutpatient\nand basically for each of these people\nthe one foundational experience is they\nhave to feel that negative emotion and\nnot be punished for it and the whole\nproblem is that we live in a society\nwhere people punish you for your\nnegative emotions you have all these\nlike you know postings of Karen's losing\ntheir [ __ ]\nright and that's a person who like we\nlove to demonize these people who\nexperience negative emotions I demonize\nKaren's all the time we like demonize\nparents\nright and is that what Karen's need like\nheaven forbid we acknowledge for a\nmoment that maybe Karen's need\ncompassion too\nbut we don't like to do that no right\nand so a lot of us go through life and\nwe feel like a Karen\nbecause Everywhere I Go\npeople aren't giving me the respect that\nI deserve\nright they're not treating me with\ncompassion no one is sort of considering\nhow I could have a hard day and then the\nother problem is that when we experience\nthis kind of stuff going back to True\nCrime and mass murderers when we have\nall these negative emotions\nthey come out in some way\nand this is why we don't like Karen's\nright because they don't make themselves\nvery likable\nthey say and do a lot of things that\nengender the opposite of compassion very\nhard to be compassionate it's also that\nthat little I think there's that that\nbit of shot and fraud too for people\nwhere they're like well I would never do\nthis so in this moment I feel better\nknowing I must not be as bad as I think\nbecause this person's so much worse and\nit's like we're we use those people to\nan extent people usually make themselves\nfeel better yeah like and this this\nKaren thing is like you're right they're\nschadenfreude because [ __ ] that Karen\nLOL and where does that come from\nbecause one day when we were emotionally\nhurting someone was like [ __ ] you\nyeah yeah right\nI I get it I get it Dr CAD you do a lot\nof Karen content okay\noh that's fine\nI I think it's\nI think that's okay I just want you to\nknow I just want you to know otherwise\nthere's an elephant in the room it's\ngood [ __ ] right\nthat's okay but I get where you're\ncoming from and I mean even when I'm\ndoing this stuff I've even said before\nlike there's you know what there's this\nperson the the formula is this person\nthat doesn't know how to deal with their\nemotions I think what most people hate\nthe most is the entitlement aspect of it\nbecause a lot of us that hate ourselves\nand want to die we don't have that like\nentitlement to that extreme and then now\nthis person something has made them\nupset in that day\nand then they run into a situation where\nthey feel an opportunity to feel\npowerful and then somebody whips out the\ncamera right which also bleeds back into\nthat public humiliation thing I mean\npublic shaming will bring somebody out\nof some bad behavior real fast and it's\nand it's crazy but it's like are we over\nusing them you know so I think public\nshaming will cause I think it it'll\nbring people out of Behavior real fast\nor it'll cause them to Double Down\nyes that is true too and I think what we\nsee with Karens is that we're selecting\nso like we have to remember that we\ndon't see an objective representation of\nwhat's out there on the internet we're\nselecting for the people who are\nparticularly entitled or narcissistic\nwhich evokes a lot of impotent rage on\nthe part of us right because now we get\nto be mad at something else and then we\nspend all of our days watching Karen\ncontent and we're seriously I'm not\ntrying to throw any shade on you I think\nif you like doing Karen content do care\nin content\nright\nbut I mean I think that's it's like it\nspeaks to what we're dealing with\nyeah and then we end up getting mad at\nthis person instead of getting mad at\nthe people that we should be getting mad\nat and then we have that rolling ball\nthat just keeps on rolling but the you\nknow also I feel like the other question\nis too like when we have this big\ninternet anger ball that we're just\nmaking bigger and bigger and bigger how\ndoes that even stop I don't I I don't\nthink we've seen it stop we don't know\nthat it does stop\nyeah because I think what ends up\nhappening is it only stops when\nsomething really really big stops\nsomebody's ball from pushing and then\nthey eventually stop and they say whoa\nlike that hurt this stuff isn't supposed\nto hurt online nothing's supposed to\nhurt but then they get back up and they\nmake an even bigger ball and it just\nkeeps rolling yeah I don't know what's\ngoing on with the internet I think it's\nlike we've created this monster\neveryone's worried about AI I don't\nthink we're\nI mean I think we should be worried\nabout AI but I think what we're dealing\nwith now is actually way worse than we\ngive it credit for\nI think what usually happens I don't\nknow about you but sometimes what I I\nliterally have to do is just check out\nof whatever the influences\nlike just like just not stop using it\nlike basically yeah I deleted my Twitter\nyeah over a year ago I think you just\nhave to you have to just get off the\nride I don't I mean it's a loop that I I\ndon't know where it ends I don't think\nit does end I think you just have to get\noff\nI agree I think I think it's hard for\nI think you know one thing that I find\nis like really interesting is that like\nother content creators I know um some\npeople I know they'll read every single\ncomment like negative comments good bad\nand my friends that do that I don't know\nwhat they're looking for like especially\nwhen you're reading Tick Tock comments\nabout yourself and there's like two\nthousand three thousand comments they'll\nread every single one I you know they\nhey there's like a Tyler Creator tweet\nwhere he said just how are you getting\nbullied online just close your eyes like\nwalk away from the computer like that's\nwhat I do like if I'm getting upset or\nlike angry or something with that I\ndon't engage with it anymore I just I\njust walk away and it's a uh I feel like\nit's a more mature collapse and submit\nbut it's just me saying like I'm gonna\ngo over here I don't think it's the\ncollapse and submit I think it's setting\na boundary okay okay I like that right\nso it collapse and submit is letting it\nright so you're subjecting yourself to\nit\nand walking away is like completely\ndifferent yeah you're right there's so\nmuch stuff that we can walk away from\nbut we choose not to and I think\nsometimes when I've done that in the\npast sometimes it's just because I don't\nhave anything else going on and I'm just\nlike yeah let's [ __ ] do this let's\nhit the gas\num I try to distract myself these days\nyeah I think uh that's very wise\nbecause I I think we we oftentimes\nespecially as therapists we don't really\nwe sometimes come up with these super\ncomplicated formulations of like why is\nthis person like oh my God it's\nabandonment issues and it certainly can\nbe for a lot of people I'm not trying to\ndevalue that\nbut I think sometimes I I think we just\nforget especially as therapists that\njust helping someone like build like a\npretty decent life is some of the best\nstuff that you can do\nyou know just helping them find\nrelationships helping them form\nrelationships helping them be\nprofessionally successful and it's kind\nof like here we are kind of working on\nall these like negative self-esteem\nissues but\ndoes this person have a reason to be\nproud in their life to begin with yeah\nand there's a certain amount of chicken\nor egg and I think that if you don't\nhave if you devalue yourself\nit sabotages your ability to develop\nthings that you can be proud of\nabsolutely\nbut I think it's kind of interesting\nbecause if you look at the data the\nmajority of people who have mental\nhealth struggles\ndo better on their own without any kind\nof professional help\nso I want to say that something like I'm\nnot perfect on these statistics and the\nstudies are not 100 but\nsomething like over 50 percent maybe\ntwo-thirds of people with addictions\nactually attain sobriety without ever\nseeing a medical professional\nso the majority of people handle it on\ntheir own or recovery is maybe a better\nword girl\nhow that that\nlike you give me a drink you're gonna\nhave to give me four but I'm better now\nDr k\num yeah right so so you're you're but\nlike like the I'm with you I'm not\nsaying that I'm not saying you shouldn't\nget mental health support you should\nabsolutely do that I'm a big advocate of\nit but I think they must have something\nin their life that makes that the thing\nthat made me slow down with my drinking\na lot was when I got into a stable\nrelationship we started creating a\nsecure partnership which is something I\nnever had before we get we have a nice\nhouse I work in the mornings I've got to\nbe up at nine or ten a.m and I couldn't\nhave that drink like I physically\ncouldn't have that drink because I know\nI get hangovers in the morning and I\nslowly make the choice to choose the\ngood side and not the old ways and oh my\nGod it's also so boring because my rowdy\ngirl she's dying she is dying she my\nlittle troublemaker\num I I don't know and it's it's weird I\nfeel like a different person but I'm I'm\nbetter now better I'm better but I'm\nboring\nhow do you feel about that\num\nI think the biggest struggle with it is\nthat uh my creative was the Rowdy girl\nlike she just had crazy idea and I talk\nabout this as like almost like a past\nversion of myself but she just had big\nIdeas wanted to prove herself lots of\nthat anger was you know channeled into\nwanting to prove myself and\num you know sometimes I would drink a\nlot and then I'd be hungover for a whole\nday and I would be so bored that I would\ncome up with new ideas just like a lot\nof weird stuff like that but now I need\nto still do those things but maintain my\ngood life and it's uh at times it's\nboring now things were a lot more funner\na lot more a lot more dopamine a lot\nmore drama\num but it's\nI don't know if this answers your\nquestion it's just better now and I\nprefer this I'm much happier and the\npeople around me are much happier too\nwhich means a lot to me\nso I I think it sounds like you've\ncrafted a life with a lot of\nintentionality which sounds awesome\nyou're asking me how do people do it I\nmean it sounds like you just mentioned a\nlot of reasons why you can become sober\nthat have I'm sure that you know therapy\nand stuff was a part of it but I think\nthat's the experience of a lot of people\nis that they kind of grow up right yeah\nbecause you just said well like I had to\nwork in the morning I I had a disabled\nrelationship I've got a place to live\nlike these are all things that help me\nstay sober or have a good relationship\nwith substances\nreally interesting because before when\nyou said like oh most people end up\ndoing their that on their own as much as\nI talked to my therapist about like you\nknow I'm drinking or this that and the\nthird\num you know her answer was always just\nlike stop\njust stop doing it you know and it\ndidn't do much for me but it wasn't\nuntil I uh I decided to I'm sorry what\nthey just told you to stop and it didn't\nand you didn't stop and I didn't stop it\nwas crazy\nwow that's insane yeah and like did they\ndid they tell you to stop more than once\ndid they remind you that you should be\nstopping yeah it's like she kept saying\nstop for two years and I'm like stop\nstop what like okay\nbut um yeah so I think what honestly\nchanged for me go ahead sir sorry I\ncan't I'm gonna let you finish in just a\nsecond and then people wonder oh how is\nit that so many people are able to to\nstop without this awesome contribution\nfrom therapy dude\nman dealing with uh dealing with us\naddicts I feel I empathize for the\nfamily members and the friends because\nlike they just don't get it we're like\nbut it's so good\num but uh yeah would actually change\nthings for me was\num having a period where I had to get up\nand go to work in the morning and my\nlife changed like a lot it really was\nthe life circumstances and then the big\nkicker was uh my boyfriend and I decided\nto go sober for three months and about a\nmonth into it I also like stopped\nsmoking weed so for three months of my\nlife I had this intense Clarity that I\nhadn't had before\num and I was able I had been muting my\nemotions for you you know seven or eight\nyears with drugs and alcoholic Weed and\nAlcohol\num and I didn't feel them but when I\nfinally went sober for a while and I\ncame out of it I realized I was strong\nenough to deal with everything that I\nhad been running from\num and I had to have that three months\nof clarity and so now I still drink like\nI still do but um I'll go through like\ntwo weeks of soap I'll go through two\nweeks sober I'll do a week or I'll just\nlike you know I I find it I still have\nan issue where like if I drink one night\nI'll be like oh let's drink the next\nnight oh let's drink the next night oh\nthe next one like we're having a good\ntime and then I'll do a week or two off\nand that's that's what works for me a\nlittle harm reduction and it's yeah\noh boys I've never met because I've\nnever met the Troublemaker but I miss\nher too\ndude she was so fun\nbut yeah I'm I'm much I'm much happier\nnow I'm so I'm much much happier\ngood for you I guess\nliving a productive life God what a\nloser that's how I feel like\nputting on my makeup going to like my\ncool job and I'm like God you're so this\nis so lame let's go Day drink let's like\ngo out to West Hollywood and get [ __ ]\nup at 11 A.M like let's just see what\nhappens\nokay no but I mean I think going back to\nso here's what I found with people who\nbecome sober much like yourself they\nfeel like they've lost a part of\nthemselves\nI think honestly it's back to the it's\njust a rusty tool right so so accessing\ncreativity\nis something that you have to work on\nbut I I think generally speaking the net\nis absolutely positive and I think I\ndon't know that people will ever get\nback to quite the same type of fun\nbut I think you can get way closer so so\nI mean I I've seen this this has been\nthe hardest actually in in the patients\nthat I've worked with not with\nsubstances but with bipolar disorder\nand there's actually there's studies we\nhave a whole video about it on YouTube\nabout it's really interesting but one of\nthe\nbipolar disorder probably the people who\nhave bipolar disorder or by definition\nstudy like objectively more creative\nthan people who don't have bipolar\ndisorder and when you're when you're in\nthat hypomanic or manic State your\ncreativity is actually like more is\nobjectively higher yeah so you're like\nchanneling all these weird creative\nideas the really tricky thing is if you\nlook at outcomes\npeople who have untreated bipolar\ndisorder have higher levels of\ncreativity but their actual output is\nway lower so while you may have a bunch\nof ideas you can never turn it into\nsomething yeah I have a feeling I'm sure\nthat they those folks also feel very\ninspired too or creatively inspired when\nthey're depressed maybe not inspired but\nthey have new Creative Concepts but they\ncan't put them into motion absolutely\nand then months pass because bipolar is\nusually like a few months and then they\nare back into the Mania but they have\nnew ideas and it's just yeah so I I I\nthink just as you you know as you\ncontinue to stay sober and stuff and and\ndo what you're doing I think the the\ntrouble I'm drinking tonight okay okay\nwhat whatever it's been eight days\n[Laughter]\nall right the week is up we're on day\neight it's good time\n[Music]\nlisten I'm honest I'm not listening\nwhere I'm not ready to kill her yet okay\nwe still need her I'm not saying you\nshould kill her it's just\nyou know\nfelt like a little bit too much of\nwatching that sand in The Hourglass\ntickle down yeah we took it down and\nthen we pushed over\nhey it sounds like you're doing well and\neveryone's on their own journey and you\nknow truly yeah you know I mean a lot of\npeople are able to and this is also a\nreally common misconception that people\nassume that sobriety is the only way to\nbe in recovery there's actually a lot\ndata coming out that you can actually\nlike still continue to use substances\nthis is the other thing that we're sort\nof discovering is that everyone thinks\nit's like oh like you have a genetic\nthing and your brain is wired\ndifferently but\num the prevailing Theory right now that\nis that most addiction professionals\nwill\nbelieve or will put forth is that\naddiction is a consequence of genetic\nvulnerability plus environment\nand so being in the right environment\ncan can really is is really an important\npart you know personally I I plan to\nreally begin a sobriety Journey when I\nhave kids because drinking was\nnormalized around me\num which I think is a huge thing my they\nwere drinking every single day and\nsometimes it wouldn't even be what the\nthing was with my parents I didn't see\narguments fights or anything I would\njust constantly see them drinking their\nwine and then going to bed so it got\nnormalized to me but because of a lot of\nthe trauma that I endured I didn't\nalways handle my alcohol well you know\nbut I don't know if you've seen this\ntheme too often what I um what I\nrealized that was really making me drink\nso freak a big part of it was when I was\ngrowing up I really I was one of those\nkids that had to like raise themselves\nlike I had to take on a lot of adult\nresponsibilities and when I drink and\nsmoke cigarettes I get to go to this\nshitty version of myself that has no\nresponsibilities and I loved the\nalleviation it was like I got to be a\npiece of [ __ ] that was in the bar\nsmoking cigarettes taking shots with\neverybody and there were no\nresponsibilities and then the next day\nwhen I'm hungover oh no responsibilities\nbecause I'm hungover drinking for me was\na break from having to be responsible\nand then you know I mentioned before\nthat what really changed it for me was\nhaving day-to-day responsibilities and\njust taking ownership that I'm a [ __ ]\nadult now and I can't have three days\noff of cleaning the house or eating well\nor doing work like I have to show up\nespecially at the age I'm in now\nwhat are your thoughts\nno you don't\nI would like to\nbecause I think this is just this is\njust your I you're on a journey Bose and\nit's not I'm not trying to be arrogant\nor condescending here but I love this\ngive me I I think so we have this idea\nso so okay let's talk about alcohol for\na second or any kind of drugs right\nso when you use it\nyou get freedom from your\nresponsibilities\nright so like when normally when we go\nthrough our day I'm trying to figure out\nhow to say this\nwe have responsibilities that weigh on\nus I have to do this and I have to do\nthis and I have to do this and I have to\ndo this\nand when I drink or get high or whatever\nplay video games\nthe things that you have to do don't go\naway\nwhat really goes away is the pressure on\nyour mind\nokay so let's think about this\ndrinking doesn't actually reduce your\nresponsibilities at all in fact it\nincreases your responsibilities because\nnow two days later two days later you\nhave more stuff to do so first of all\nit's not actually fixing anything it's\nmaking things worse and it's\nintensifying\nwhen you deal with it good [ __ ] okay\npreach okay so the next thing is why do\nwe want to intensify the [ __ ] that we\ndeal with because that's how we function\nbecause when do we study for the exam\nwhen it's two days away and it's too\nmuch for me to handle so our primary\nmotivational Drive comes from being\noverwhelmed I I perform very well under\npressure you put me under pressure\nyou've got a choice okay you can have\nthree days of slogging through your [ __ ]\nor you can have one day of partying one\nday of hungover and one day of oh [ __ ]\nwe gotta do everything today\nokay no no I don't need to make you\nchoose you've chosen you know what\nyou're gonna take the alcohol okay I'll\ntake a drink but but but but we're not\ndone okay so here's the wild thing\nthough here's what we all miss\nis that the letting go of mental\nresponse because remember the feeling\nmentally weighed down has nothing to do\nwith actually your responsibilities\nbecause those don't change when you\ndrink you can actually let go\nof the feeling of responsibilities every\nsingle day\nso it's the it's the uh gosh I'm trying\nto think\nthe the the drinking it's the\nself-medication it's just the button you\npress that makes it easy to turn\neverything off for the moment when it\nsounds like the the next best step for\nme is like even without the alcohol to\nbe like I'm just gonna chill today and\nfigure this out tomorrow here's my\ndeadline I don't have the capacity for\nit right now even though I feel stressed\nI'm gonna yeah I meditate sometimes I\ntry but you know what it's so boring I'm\ngonna say it I do it but I sit there in\nthe first two minutes I'm like God I\ncould be doing anything else I could be\nscrolling Tick Tock right now yeah\nsorry no yeah no we're getting into this\nyeah but but I would even say like\ngo at your own pace but this is really\nwhen I work with people with with\naddictions right so this is this is like\nwhat we discover\nis that you actually like you can be\nfree of those responsibilities\nwithout the alcohol you can just be like\nand this is where you say I can't do\nthis today no that's not what you need\nto tell yourself you need to tell\nyourself I can do this today I have the\ncapacity to do this day and you know\nwhat I'm not going to\nbecause I'm just gonna take a day for\nmyself\nI think also there's a fun little tool\nthere where knowing yourself and even\nknowing myself I know that I work well\nunder pressure and so not being afraid\nthat I'm getting down to the deadline\nand just knowing like well it's the same\nthing like I'm taking today off whether\nI'm drinking or not and just relaxing\nand then I know myself and I'm gonna get\nthis done because when the pressure hits\nlike I'm on you know I\nand so what I say what I think is you\njust need one experience of not maybe\nmaybe more than one but you know you\nneed like at least one experience where\nyou take a day off for no reason you\njust do it and once your brain realizes\noh you know what I don't need the\nalcohol to take a day off and and free\nmy mind of those responsibilities then\nyou won't need it anymore and well you\nknow but you're also dealing with it and\nI I want to say again I am significantly\nbetter now like I'll take weeks or a few\nmonths off of drinking and I love it I\nlove when I kind of like fall into that\nbut you know also sometimes you know we\ngot the day off it's 10 o'clock I'm just\nkidding I'm not a 10 o'clock drinker but\nI'm like oh it's 4 59 because we'll\nstart walking in the store right now you\nknow what I mean like and but it's fun\nfor me like I get like and then and then\nlike two drinks in I [ __ ] hate it\num I I mean God I'm sure Chad has this\ntoo like how many times have you said\nI'm never drinking again I would say I'm\nsomewhere in the hundreds\nlike 900s\nyeah I I mean I think it everyone's on\ntheir journey and I think you're you're\ndoing great dude really thank you also I\nlove I love how like this start off\nwhere you're like WOW bows good job with\nthe trauma stuff like you're doing great\nlike wow you're wise and I'm like can I\nget a drink\nlike the end of it\nyeah I I think it's great\nso this is what I'm saying is is that I\ndon't think that this speaks any less of\nyou\nyou haven't become any less wise\nthere's the whole point is like if you\nkind of think about you know like I\ndon't know if you've ever tried DBT but\nthis whole idea of the dialectic that\ntwo things we we think that okay like oh\nlike in order for both to be wise like\nshe can't get a drink like that destroys\nThe credibility like oh my God like how\ncould this degenerate be wise like oh my\nGod\nlike no like you you get to crush it at\nsome stuff\nand still be working on the other stuff\nthat's life I think I think allowing it\nto be a process too is really important\num I would say only in the past like man\nyou know what else too I would say about\nlike three years ago I was really hard\non myself about drinking because I\ndidn't like who I was when I was\ndrinking and I felt like I was telling\nall these people around me I want to\nquit drinking I want to stop I need to\nquit drinking I don't like it and people\naround me would be like oh you're fine\noh you don't drink that much but I\ndidn't like when I was drinking why I\nwas drinking and how I felt\num\nyeah I mean so that that that's I was\ngoing to kind of say the same thing when\nI say like this is a process like I I\ndon't want to apply a value judgment\nto you or for you about what your\nrelationship with alcohol is\nright and if it's it's been day eight\ndays whatever like you get to decide\nright you're saying here I am at the\nbeginning being wise and then here I am\nnow being in the judge no\nright this could be healthy you this\ncould be the right balance for you this\nisn't this doesn't make you inferior at\nall yeah no it's full it's full circle\nme but I I like that I like that and I\nI like who I am now even you get all the\nlike the dark Parts I think they're fun\nI embrace them and and then I I think\nthis is also where just like you said I\nthink the next question for you is just\nand you've I think you've already kind\nof answered it\nis you know at what point do you want\nyour life to be a little bit different\nso right now like it's been eight days\nyou're good we're gonna have a good time\ntoday it's you know whatever go for it\nright be safe obviously but yeah but\nthen at some point you may have to and\nthis is what I I think with just anyone\nwho's trying to make a change in their\nlife you have to decide what kind of\nLife do you want is the current balance\nof things what you're looking for and\nare you happy with it yeah\nand if the answer that question is yes\nyou just keep living your life don't let\nthe judgments of other people whatever\nbut if you're kind of waking up and\nyou're realizing hey I actually don't\nlike being hungover hey like it is more\nimportant to me to be able to work five\ndays a week because the value that I\nderive the way that I feel about myself\nand the impact that I'm making in the\nworld like makes me proud and that is\nmore important to me than this\nyeah and I\nI think I think also figuring out like\nwhat's best for you too because so many\npeople will like come to addicts and\nthey'll say like stop stop drinking stop\ndoing drugs stop doing whatever that\nperson's not gonna cut cold turkey\nbecause that's their coping mechanism\nand if you don't replace that coping\nmechanism with something they're just\ngonna like fall apart or they're not\ngonna do it\num I think like harm reduction stuff has\nworked really well for me it's been a\nit's been a it's been a good journey\nover the past year and a half and the\nfunnest thing too is that you know I\nmake a lot of jokes about it but you\nrealize that you'll never be that person\nthat you were again because you've\nlearned way too much about yourself like\num and why you do those things and\nyou're like\nwow okay I was doing that because of XYZ\nand now that you're aware you just can't\ngo back to it\num but yeah like now I'll take like a\nfew weeks off or so I never and also I\nnever drink more than like\nthree drinks um because that's just my\nharm reduction limit because three\ndrinks I'm having a good [ __ ] time\nI'm like\nbut then once we get to four I'm\nhungover I'm grumpy the next day my the\nnext day I feel depressed for no reason\nlike even if I can get up and I I don't\nlike losing days anymore I hate that I\ncan't stand that\num because I'm getting older and it\nfeels like my my time I value my time\nand I value my days\nbut yeah it's it's so fascinating to me\nthat you are actually right it really\ndoesn't come from outside help sometimes\nit helps from creating the life that you\nwant and then holding on to maintain\nthat because you value it so much\nholding on what a good way to put it\num I had one other thought and I don't\nknow how much longer my voice is Gonna\nKeep up but\num\ndamn it you said something that I\nthought was so good\nthat's very nice of you\ngive me just a second I don't want to\nmiss it\nyou were talking about\noh yeah\nthis I thought is beautiful so there's\nthis uh you said that\nmy days are too valuable to me\nso if we talk about you know what I see\nin people who are addicted this is true\nof Gamers as well\nis that their days are not worth much to\nthem and it's kind of like uh\ncircular trap so if all I do is play\nvideo games all day what's the value of\na day the value of a day is low\nmm-hmm\nand so what is the cost of me wasting a\nday what can I accomplish in that day\nanyway can't accomplish much so what's\nthe harm in wasting it\nright it's like what's the value of a\npenny you can't buy anything for a penny\nso you can waste them all day long and\nthis is the Trap that people create is\nsince my day is not worth much because I\ndon't do much with it I can afford to\nwaste it and I waste it and I waste it\nand I waste it and the more days that\nyou waste the less valuable they become\nthe less valuable they become the less\nit hurts to waste them\nand what I'm really seeing from you and\nI think you've really put it well is\nthat a day is worth more to you and\npeople think that oh this is because I'm\nolder and now the sand of The Hourglass\nno it's just you've really learned how\nvaluable of a human being you are and\nthis is where the self-esteem comes in\nbecause when you learn that you're a\nvaluable person then your time is worth\nmore if it time is worth more it is not\nworth wasting if it's not worth wasting\nthen I'm going to live life to the\nfullest yeah and try I think this sounds\nso silly but a really big turning point\nfor me and hard agree with everything\nyou said and a lot of times people don't\nthink that's possible to ever be able to\ncare about yourself but it comes on\nslowly and when you see it coming you\ngot to grab it and and work on it work\nwith it you know\num don't self-destruct folks but um I\nthink sometime in my 20s I was watching\nthis show and I saw this thing where\nthey said the most unhappy age like this\ndecade is your 40s because for a lot of\npeople that's when all of your life\ndecisions culminate into like this is\nwhat it is your career whether you've\nhad children or not whether you're\nmarried or not the way that you deal\nwith your you know mental things the way\nthe relationships you have with friends\nfamily like it really starts to solidify\nat 40 and people see like this this is\nwhat I've built and it gets very\ndifficult to climb your way out of that\nif you haven't set yourself up and I'm\nin my 20s and I'm like I don't have over\nhere I have heart palpitations I'm like\nthis [ __ ] sucks now you're telling me\nthat it gets worse so I've actually\nsince I heard that been working towards\nfostering relationships finding a happy\nlike partner like trying to like care\nabout my job because I'm literally\ntrying to set myself up for four days\nmiserable so you know I hear that kind\nof stuff I think it maybe used to be\ntrue but I don't think like the midlife\ncrisis is the thing that it used to be\nwhat I see is that people so that we\nhave this idea that the 20s or your\nteenage years or the best years of your\nlife for like half the population\nteenage years and 20s suck you don't\nknow what the [ __ ] you're doing people\nare living life\nand like you don't know how to live that\nlife right because you can't you don't\nfit in\nand then and then like you you know and\nthen what happens is you end up turning\n30 one day and then you're like well\n[ __ ] I just lost the best years of my\nlife the 20s are supposed to be the best\nyears and now that's gone GG there's no\nre there\nand then some people are like 30 so the\ntime to enjoy and then some people like\nno 30s are the worst years of your life\nbecause your 20s are gone I think all\nthis kind of crap is is is just it's\njust a journey\ntrue I see I see a lot of people having\nwhat I call an early life crisis it hits\nway earlier like 15 25 22 the the best\nyears of your life are not restricted to\na particular age\nthey're restricted to when you\nunderstand what the [ __ ] is going on and\nyou enjoy yourself from day to day and\nyou're kind of living life to the\nfullest that can be in the 20s it can be\nin your teenage years when you're so\nclueless about the future and that's\nwhat changed by the way\nbecause in your teenager when I was a\nteenager I was allowed to be clueless\nlike the world the internet didn't exist\nand now with the internet like we don't\nlet kids be clueless anymore\nwe're like worrying them and making them\n[ __ ] paranoid from day one\nit's like dating is a crisis Tinder is\n[ __ ] the environment is going to hell\nthere's like inflation covid all this\nkind of stuff you can't and do you have\na generation of people robbed of their\nteenage years\nno you're absolutely right but I I would\nnever redo my teenage years because also\nlike I said I didn't have any tools then\nlike now at least I have a good Armory\nto deal with a lot of that stuff when\nyou're a kid you're just you're just\nthere\num and I think everything you're saying\nis absolutely right I think when I first\nheard that you know it is a good fear\nmotivator like oh my God I gotta set it\nup before you know 40 but I think in\ngeneral choosing to set your life up to\nlive a happy future like regardless of\nyou know fear a certain age whatever I\nthink that's really important so like\nlike I said like the friends you have\nlike trying to really Forge that\nconnection with them so that they're\nthere when you're in your 30s\num putting yourself out there for\nrelationships if you can sometimes we're\nnot happy\nlike having good relationships with\nfamily members that we do care about\nsetting up your finances all that stuff\nlike I dude I'm trying finally things\nare things are good they're good yeah I\nI think that's\nI think it's wonderful and in a weird\nway I think there's a the complete\nopposite is also true\nwhere so I I know it's kind of weird but\nI I get that you had\nthe scenic route in life so I it sounds\nvery healthy where you are but I've also\nseen the opposite where people are like\nokay I'm gonna you know I'm setting up\nfor 40.\nand what they actually end up doing is\nsacrificing so much during quote unquote\nthe best years of their life because\nyou're saying I don't regret my 20s good\nbut there are a lot of people out there\nwho will sacrifice their 20s for the\nsake of their 40s oh no and this blows\nmy mind because like I'll work with\nthese kids who are in these like\naccelerated programs to go to med school\nand it's like that way I can finish I\nstarted med school at the age of 28 I\nwas a degenerate in my 20s and it was\ngreat I loved it\nand and now it's like if I it's kind of\nweird because then they're like okay\nyeah if I start earlier right if I\nbecome if I finish all my school at the\nage of like 24 instead of 28 and then I\nstart you know working really hard and\nthen I get I start making a lot of money\nin my like 30s and 40s and then I can\nretire early so it's like wait a second\nbro let me understand this you're gonna\ntrade five years in your 20s for five\nyears in your 60s does that sound like a\ngood trade to you dedicating your whole\nthe with your the funnest times or what\ncould be yeah just for security at 40\nand 50. yeah so lame yeah I had also can\nI just once again reiterate I had a\nblast in my 20s good times good times\nwell you gotta you gotta\nokay\nso you got to let me know if you ever\nenter a second adolescence because then\nwe we gotta hang out sometime\nI get to know the troublemaker\nyeah dude you got it oh it's talking to\nyou likewise it's super fun I enjoyed it\nI mean I knew it was gonna be fun\nbecause I know what you do but like I'm\nlike Ah that's great yeah I really\nappreciate I'm sorry my you know the\nvoice is just given out and I I think uh\nbut I I really appreciate everything\nthat we shared I mean just everything\nyou've shared bows it's like you're
