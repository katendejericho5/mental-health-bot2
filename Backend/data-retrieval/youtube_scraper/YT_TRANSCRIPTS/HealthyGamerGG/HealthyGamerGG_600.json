    "transcript": "you know the avoidance of pain is\nfrequently what gets us into the most\ntrouble I know one thing I've sort of\nnoticed as a psychiatrist is that people\ntend to avoid pain first of all which\nmakes perfect sense but honestly I've\nseen just as many lives ruined by\npositive emotions and being out of\ncontrol with your positive emotions and\nI'm not just talking about Mania I'm\ntalking about falling in love with\nsomeone I'm talking about you know\nreally love is destroyed just as many\nlives that I've seen that you know hate\nhas which sounds really bizarre to say\nbut I've kind of seen it in terms of\nwhat people will tolerate because they\nlove someone what people will inflict on\nsomeone because they love someone and\nit's sort of like this possessive sort\nof love and also the other people that\nyou are willing to hurt if you are in\nlove with a particular person"
