    "transcript": "how do you want to defeat a particular\nboss in a video game the solution is not\nendless Theory crafting and you all may\nhave even seen arguments with like noobs\non the internet who are low MMR and will\nTheory craft their way into arguments\nwith people who are way better than them\nat the game and the thing is that you\ncan argue about against this Noob on the\ninternet you can be way better than them\nbut no amount of intellectual\nmasturbation is going to ever convince\nthem what's the only way that they are\ngoing to learn by actually doing\nsomething so if you're crippled with\noverthinking acknowledge that some kind\nof attempt is going to be anxiety\nprovoking maybe breathe into it a little\nbit you know check out some of the\nYouTube videos that we have on\nmeditation check out Dr K's guide to\nanxiety and things like that and really\nkind of acknowledge your fear and then\ntry to actually learn instead of solve\nthe problem"
