    "transcript": "hello hello hello Dr K nice to meet you\nnice to meet you too is it okay if I\ncall you Emily yes that'd be great\nand um\nI I watched your instructions on how to\neat a soup dumpling recently you did did\nyou agree that is not how I eat them\nreally\nso so what I do is I I put them in the\nspoon and I bite off the top okay the\nvolcano method oh they're they're names\nfor these things yes yes so I do the\nnibble method but that's the volcano\nmethod right and then you pour the soy\nsauce in or the sauce well I usually\njust blow and then then I will I'll blow\ninto the top to cool it down so I don't\nburn myself and then I eat with the soup\nin the dumpling\nyeah okay\nwell yeah I mean that's but you know to\nto each their own and it was interesting\nto see that there was that technique I\nshall try that the next time I go out\nfor dumplings with my kids\nso funny uh\nuh like I clicked on my stream at that\nmoment\num it was a I realized I'm interviewing\nthis person and I'm sure I was curious\nabout the content that you make and uh\nfell down the rabbit hole of your\nawesome awesome content\num do you want to just tell us a little\nbit about where people can find you and\nwhat kind of content you do definitely\nuh so hello everyone my name is extra\nEmily I stream only on Twitch and I\nusually do uh just streams that's like\nmy main focus so uh twitch.tv extra\nEmily and my streams are like IRL\nchallenges so I love going in public and\nmaking a big fool out of myself and uh\nso recently I did Urban kayaking which\nis I took a kayak to a skate park and I\nwas like\nrowing my vote down the slopes and\nwhatnot so uh stuff like that yeah okay\nthat sounds very hard yeah I got a I got\nlike a little scuff here and but it's\nyeah how do you kayak without water\noh yes you just have to have really good\nbalance so uh you just kind of row\nthis sounds like a profound spiritual\ntechnique\nyou know it's like it's like squeezing\nwater from a stone or you know what is\nthe sound of one hand clapping or how\ndoes one how does one kayak in a skate\npark without water yes you must be one\nwith the kayak or something like that\nyes yeah cool so thank you so much and\nand so what what is there something in\nparticular you wanted to talk about\ntoday\num when I was asked to do the interview\na few things came to my mind so it'd be\ngreat to like talk about dealing with\nburnout for example\num and uh not having like ways to cope\nwith stress I think would also be really\nhelpful sure and yeah because that's\nlike kind of the biggest things that I\nuh have to deal with right now is like\nI'm worried uh like there's a lot of\npressure I feel like so I just like want\nto be able to navigate my stress a\nlittle better sure so um what are you\ndealing with right now\nuh well I'm I'm like very analytics\nfolks\nfolks so I'm\nI'm so that's like my biggest fear so uh\nI'm kind of entering and I realize that\nI'm entering the start of like this uh\nkind of unhealthy cycle where I have to\none up my content every week or else I\nfeel like oh maybe my streams aren't as\ngood anymore\num but I'm trying to balance it out\nslowly so I don't burn out too quick\nokay you don't burn out too quick so\nit's okay to burn out just as long as\nyou burn out and at an acceptable pace\nfive years then that'll be be good for\nme yeah so because you'll you'll have\nmade it by then right exactly yeah\nthat'll be good like I want to\nsend uh yeah so I just want to make sure\nI have enough longevity until then what\nwhat what why the five years\nI don't know 30 seems like a nice number\nso I'm like oh 30 be like a great\nmilestone to hit and then uh I would\nprefer to do it like more like 30 32 but\nI don't know I feel like doing the\nthings that I do as like a 35 year old\nmight be a little strange so we'll have\nto maybe pivot content at that point\nlike doing breastfeeding streams or\nsomething\nokay well I'm sure you will\nthat will be a pivot wouldn't that be\ncrazy yeah\num you know it's interesting though\nbecause actually breastfeeding is\nsomething that\num really can be taught so that they're\nactually like lactation consultants and\nnurses and this is actually it's\nactually a huge public health problem\nthat uh we just assume that people will\nknow how to breastfeed but it's actually\nlike really really hard and can be\nreally really traumatic for moms and\nkids because then if you can't\nbreastfeed properly like you feel like\nyou're not a good mom you know and then\nif you have to like resort to bottle\nfeeding and then there's all like the\narmy of people who are like bottle\nfeeding make makes you a bad mother yeah\nand and it's funny but yeah that's\ninteresting I assume you were joking or\nmaybe you weren't but that's actually\nlike a pretty big Public Health need and\nlike messes up a lot of like mobs and\nthe hormones post pregnancy immune Post\ndelivery don't help\nwell wait that that sounds inspirational\nI think I was saying it as a joke but\nthat's like a great idea now no I mean\nseriously like I I you know I don't know\nif I don't know how to make that work\nbut like like I'd never thought about\nteaching that but it's it's actually\nlike a gigantic problem like a massive\nproblem that makes so much a postpartum\ndepression is linked to like the\ninability to breastfeed and then if\nyou're depressed then like you don't\nproduce enough milk and then the kid\ndoesn't latch and then you feel stressed\nout and then you stop producing milk and\nit's hard to bond it's like actually\nreally bad and people don't talk about\nit enough\num\nbut you know I\nyeah anyway so I feel like if we spent a\ncouple hours talking about breastfeeding\nthat would probably be in the wrong\ndirection\nso I'm gonna change gears back to what\nyou were talking about so uh you said\nyou you're always looking at analytics\num do you feel like you have a lifespan\nas a streamer uh I think as a female\nstreamer I definitely do uh I just I\nguess it's like maybe I just put in my\nmind but I feel like 32 is might be like\nthe peak for me but I don't know it's\njust like uh based off streamers that\nexist now so I know there are a lot of\nlike really successful female streamers\nuh 32 and older so I'm like oh like if\nthey can do it I feel like I can do it\nso that's how I kind of get my basis for\nthat number okay so you said\nespecially as a woman can you tell us a\nlittle bit about that yeah so I just\nfeel like I don't know I feel like my\nlooks will fade or something and then\nI'm worried that uh there'll be you know\nlike as I grow older maybe I feel like\npeople like to watch the hot new things\nyou know like the hot new the hot new\ncome on when it's not so bad but I don't\nknow I just feel like my core Community\nwill stick around but I feel like as a\nfemale on on Twitch it's like a little\nbit harder to like I feel like it's good\nto be young on Twitch\nyeah\nso um\nyou ready to dive in\nyeah let's dive in okay so I want to\njust\nI noticed something and I'm curious\nif you are okay with me pointing this\nout\nso in that answer you started out saying\nsomething real\nand then you pulled back from it and\nthen you ended up saying something more\nPC did you notice that\nyeah I always try to go for like a PC\nanswer yeah sure and and what do you\nwhat happens when you do that do you\nhave any it's kind of a hard question to\nanswer but uh so I think like one of my\nbiggest fears is like getting canceled\nso then like that kind of just kicks in\nand I'm like oh make sure not to say\nanything that it's too offensive or\nanything and so then I think that's like\nwhere the the shift kicks in yeah so I I\nmean but do you think that I'm I'm with\nyou and I I've talked to a lot of\nstreamers about\ncanceling PTSD or canceling anxiety like\nyou're just like constantly anxious\nabout getting canceled like you know\nit's something I felt myself but I'm I'm\nhmm\ncan I think for a second\ncourse\nyeah\nokay so if we want to understand burnout\nfundamentally the way to not get burnt\nout is to be\nreally kind of confident and secure in\nyourself and we'll we'll explain how how\nto get there but I I think you know as\nlong as you have this anxiety of like\nand it may be real right and like this\nis where like a lot of what we do is we\nlike kind of speak the truth here which\nis that I mean what what do you think\nabout female streamers and their\nlifespans\nlike what do you think\nuh uh I think\npersonally that they're\nshorter than men streamer lifespans okay\nright so so nice that you added\npersonally that's another anti-canceling\ndon't cancel me yeah right yeah right so\nyou don't want to offend people\nbut what does it feel like to you\nuh so females lifespans versus like how\nwhat is it like being a 25 year old\nfemale streamer and looking at your\nanalytics and thinking you've got five\nyears\num it is uh a little scary but I think\nlike\nthat's why I want to like try to be as\ngood as I can be like during my Prime\nTime age so from uh 25 to 30. it's like\noh I should really try to grind it out\nand try my best for the next five years\nso then hopefully I'm not like at a very\nstable and comfortable position by the\ntime I get 30 so I think that's part of\nwhere the stress comes from for sure\nbecause I have like this belief that I\ncan only stream until I'm like 30 or 32.\nyeah so so I I think well said so let's\nlike take a look at that right so if\nyou've got a five-year window what does\nthat do to your stress level\num yeah it makes it pretty high for sure\nit's like oh uh it's like\noh if I don't really make it by the time\nthat I'm 30 it's like oh then I feel\nlike I can't really be a streamer\nanymore so then it just puts like a lot\nof unnecessary pressure on myself why is\nit unnecessary\num because I feel like uh I'll be good\nif no matter what\nhopefully because I kind of I do have\nbelief in my like content that it'll be\npretty uh interesting and entertaining\nbut I don't know I just like whenever\nI'm like not thinking whenever I'm not\nstreaming I'm always like thinking about\nstream and like how to make the next one\nbetter and how to improve as a content\ncreator which is good for sure it's just\na lot of pressure on myself\nso I'm noticing that you kind of have\nboth sides of a lot of these issues that\non the one hand you have faith in the\ncontent that you create you make really\ngood content you're kind of proud of it\num there's a part of you that really\nthinks that you may have a lifespan\nBeyond like you know five years that you\ncan go beyond 30 other people are doing\nit and at the same time\nthere's a lot of pressure\nyou called some of it kind of\nunnecessary right so so and it also\nsounds like I'm gonna kind of toss out\nan interpretation here that\nthere's almost like I'm feeling like a\nsense of a optimism\nfighting with a desperation\nthat's really good yeah can you tell us\nabout that uh yeah so I am optimistic\nbecause uh I I have a really great\nbacking behind me so I have like the\nsupport of otk who will always support\nme as a content creator and then it's\nalso like the desperation to make sure\nthat it was a good choice to to sign me\nand I am a good content creator and I\njust want to like prove myself a little\nbit you know so it's kind of just like\nthe mix of those two but I think uh with\nthe help of otk for sure they're like\nsuper kind and then they'll always help\nme like grow as a content creator so\nit's like oh I'll be fine no matter what\nokay and what about the desperation the\ndesperation is like looking at the\nnumbers and making sure that uh people\nare still interested in my streams and I\njust want to make sure like every stream\nis high quality so then\nI yeah I prove myself basically and then\nI'm like oh desperate to get good good\nuh good streams out and whatnot and yeah\ncan I ask you Emily a little bit about\nyour upbringing yeah for sure so uh I'm\nan only child born and raised in Omaha\nNebraska and uh growing up it was a very\ntraditional path for me so I was like\nalways forced to not first but I was\nlike really pressured to get there's\nthat what'd you just do the PC the PC\nI was forced to gain Straight A's or\nelse my cards would be very mad at me or\nso then uh it was just like always get\ngood grades always do a bunch of\nextracurriculars to get into a good\ncollege so\num I got into I went to Columbia for my\nundergrad and then graduated uh magna\n[ __ ] laude I was just like always yeah\nalways focused on grades and um that's\nhow I kind of like measured my success\nback then was through numbers as well\nwhich I think carries over to me as a\nstreamer now\nit's just like I always wanted to get\nA's and like if I ever got a B I would\nlike start crying it was so bad it was\nvery it was very toxic\nso yeah I was just like always growing\nup uh to focus on getting good grades\nand being like a great student because\nmy parents wanted me to be like a smart\nengineer or whatever but I didn't really\nfind any passion in it so I streamed\num I streamed as a hobby uh during my\nfull-time job at Citibank but then I got\nfive from Citibank for streaming at work\nand then now I'm a streamer\nwow yeah great\nwhat did it feel like to get fired\num I was like I was like sobbing a lot\nbecause uh I've never really been fired\nbefore and I take like it looks like a\nfailure in my eyes and I'm really oh my\nGod why is my\nlife I'm sorry I take failure like\npretty hard like I don't like\nfailing so then uh oh can I have a\nsecond sorry yeah I okay\none second do we need to snipe you can\ntake this is so shaky\noh my gosh is it okay for your voice to\nbe shaky\nuh yeah that's okay it's just like I\nfeel like it's hard to listen to It's\njust so shaky\nexcuse me okay it feels like I'm like on\nthe on the brink of Tears so let me uh\nI'll get it out\nI\nguess get Dr Keith you don't need to get\nit out\nso\noh I'm getting it out so then my voice\nwon't be as uh shaky\nbut why does your voice not need to be\nshaky\noh so then not people have a better\nlistening experience\nEmily who are you here for today\nuh\nmyself and a lot of people from my\ncommunity are also here so that's really\ncool\nand they were like I was really excited\nto have the converse conversation with\nyou because I've never done this before\nand I don't know it's like also my my\ncommunity was really excited too so uh\nyeah\nokay\num\nI'm not here for your community I'm not\nhere for my community I'm not here for\nme I'm here for you\nand and you do this thing where you're\nlike you smile and you've got an amazing\nsmile you're like thanks Dr K and then\nit's like back to the tears bro yeah and\nand so so like if we're talking about\nburnout like oh my God like you're so\nhard on yourself\nand\nyou know if you don't articulate\nproperly\nlike there's no grade there's no like\nyou know\nI I\nI'll stutter for a while will that help\nyou feel better\nokay yeah I'm okay\nokay\nwhat what just what happened in your\nmind over the last 60 Seconds\nuh so my I realized that my voice was\nshaking like maybe like five minutes ago\nI'm like oh gosh the tears are coming\nI think just talking more about\num\nI don't know like my past and it's just\nnice to get it all out I I don't really\nlike talk about this stuff a lot so it's\nnice being able to share it with you and\nthen just like kind of like\ncathartic tears coming out but okay so\nwe're gonna say I'm gonna say something\nI'm gonna say that was right underneath\nthe surface we didn't have to dig very\nfar okay yeah okay true so let's kind of\ntake a step back I think that if you're\num if you want to focus on burnout I\nthink this is going to be related and\nwe'll kind of map all this stuff out for\nyou in a way that your magna [ __ ] laude\nColumbia brain can process your\nanalytics brain can process but I want\nto just like stop for a second and just\nask you like I mean do you know like so\nI noticed the pressure in you to\nI can't have a shaky voice\nwhere does that what's that like oh\nuh uh I think my main issue is I I care\na lot about what other people think and\num I think that's where a lot of the\nissues stem from is that I am a huge\nhuge people pleaser like I was kind of\njust brought up like that and I\nrecognize that so I just want to make\nsure that my voice sounds good for\npeople\nhow do you understand being a people\npleaser like what goes on what what do\nyou think is happening there\num it's just like uh I'm really bad with\nconflict so I try to avoid conflict at\nall costs and I just I like to make sure\nthat people are feeling comfortable and\nI really like bringing smiles to\npeople's faces\num but yeah and I just like being really\nenergetic and happy I see that it sounds\nlike it's a lot of work\noh no it's okay it's not too bad like I\nfeel like I've done it so much my entire\nlife it's just like who I am at this\npoint I'm like always\nreally happy and\nenergetic a lot that honestly makes me\nsad really yeah\nit's just like I realized that I think\nI'm really happy when I'm like not happy\nlike really energetic when I'm around\npeople and then when I'm alone I just\nkind of like lay there and marinate in\nmy juices like on the bed or whatever\num but then when I'm like surrounded\naround people I I'm like always super\nexcited and I don't really know what\nthat means\nhow does it feel to not make people\nhappy\noh then I then I feel really bad yeah\nyeah in what does what does feeling bad\nlook like or feel like to you what is\nyourself\nif I make someone feel upset I feel like\ndisappointed in myself or something or\nlike maybe uh\nlike I get a little concerned and then\num\nusually it's not for too long though I\njust kind of keep going it depends on\nthe situation I I suppose and when\nyou're marinating in your own juices\nyeah yeah so that's what I love to sleep\nand like lay in bed and just read or\nlike go on my phone or whatnot like\nthat's like uh like some nice personal\ntime that I have\nso that's a good thing\nI love to just lay there and relax okay\nso do you do because the way that you\ndescribed it was almost like as an\nopposite of like getting this extrovert\nenergy and so I almost was reading\nbetween the lines that that's like you\nmarinate in like some negative space Oh\nOh no\nokay good juices okay so it's like a\ntasty marinade yes yes like a marinara\nsauce or something yeah okay\num and and how do you understand this\nconflict avoidance\nuh oh you say that again how do you\nunderstand conflict avoidance so you\nsaid you avoid conflict uh-huh uh so\nwell like whenever\nsomeone's mad at me like I had some a\nfew experiences uh in college with like\na roommate who was upset with me and I\nwould just get really scared and just\navoid avoid her\num so that was that was kind of\nunhealthy\num but I would just try to like\nnot talk talk about it until they bring\nit up first\nokay\nokay I'm gonna is it okay if I share a\ncouple thoughts and that guy I'm a\nlittle bit um honestly\nsee okay I'm gonna just think out loud\nokay so I was about to say\nI'm a little bit lost because when\nthere's something right underneath the\nsurface I don't know if I should ask\nmore about that because you want I I'm\nhearing that you want to put on a good\nface here\nand that you're trying\nyou can you can ask that as as deep\nquestions as you'd like as you'd like so\nokay good to know and and um\nokay let me ask you a question why\nwhy is it okay for me to ask deep\nquestions\nuh why it's because I want you to do\nwhatever you want to do and I don't want\nyou to stop yourself from what you want\nto do so\nyeah so that's like kind of going back\nto the people pleaser thing good I'm\nglad you pointed it out yes so I'm gonna\nfinish my train of thought and then\nwe're gonna\nman this is tricky okay because here's\nthe thing so like so I'm I'm sitting\nhere right and I'm like okay so here's\nthis girl and and it's really important\nfor her to prove herself\nshe wants to be a Bastion of joy and\npositivity and so she's gonna show up\nhere with like safe things to talk about\nways to cope with stress everyone feels\nstress that's relatable you're allowed\nto feel stress you're a streamer we can\ntalk about analytics and numbers okay\nit's like very safe\nthen I ask you about and that now the\nchallenge is that if we really want to\nlearn how to deal with burnout you can't\ndo it the way you're doing it now which\nis like living for other people so you\nwill be one of the most successful\nstreamers on the planet if you keep\ndoing what you're doing and at this\npoint we've got a really interesting\nhopefully we'll release a report\nrecently but we're collaborating with a\ncompany that analyzes streamer\nlike performance and streamers who have\ngone through our creator coaching\nprogram and it's the performance is\nobjectively gone up quite a bit\nthe challenge though is that if you look\nat streamers who sacrifice everything of\nthemselves they become really successful\nyou're tuned into analytics you know\nwhat people want and you will give it to\nthem no matter the cost to you because\nyou've got five years\nand in that window unless you succeed\nit's GG right\nso here you are\nnow here's the challenge that I face is\nthat\nif you really want to understand burnout\nyou've got to understand this it's not\nabout pleasing other people out there\nbecause that's what's going to lead you\nto burn out like if we think about\nfundamentally what is burnout it's\npeople pleasing to the point of\nself-harm that's what burnout is in a\nnutshell\nI'm gonna do what makes this person\nhappy at the cost of myself and I'm\ngonna do it again and I'm gonna do it\nagain and I'm gonna do it again until my\ntank is empty and then I am unable to do\nit\nand then what's gonna happen is I'm\ngonna feel bad about myself I'm gonna\ndisappoint them anyway and now I've\nsacrificed all this [ __ ] and I end up\ndisappointing them\nand then I'm mad at myself\nand then self-loathing comes in why\ncan't I do better\nand then I have to wake up tomorrow and\nI have to make content I have to put on\na [ __ ] happy face which you would do\nsuch a good job of it it's a compliment\nbut it's also it makes me sad\njust seeing how much you turn it on\nlike you know\nand I so now I I'm kind of stuck because\nI I don't know if you really want\nto talk about this stuff or and that's\nwhy I asked I was like wait you ask as\ndeep as questions and I'm like hold on a\nsecond you sure about that because when\nI actually asked a deep question it\nseemed like it was hard for you\nand you don't want to disappoint me and\nyou want to prove yourself as strong and\nwilling to touch on anything\nbut if there's one thing that I would\nlove it if you could walk away from it's\nthat you don't have to\nmm-hmm\nthat you get to say\nyou know what you can be disappointed\nbecause I don't want to do that and that\nactually is hard for me and I don't feel\nlike doing it\nand I'm gonna be okay\nI'm gonna be proud of you\nI'm gonna be happy that you're learning\nhow to set boundaries and that you're\nputting yourself first not even first\nmaybe not last\nthank you\nso now we're gonna sit here we're just\ngonna be teary for a second\nyou look panicked\noh no I'm trying to find my uh my\ntissues okay\noh that looks like a not very good\ntissue\nyeah I ran out of tissues because I blow\nmy nose on stream a lot but uh I have\nthis\ncool\nit's interesting um when you said like\nthat you can see me turn it on a lot\ncan you explain what that means\nyeah\num\nso it like what did you call the\npullback PC easy pullback yeah right so\nso you do this thing where like you're\ncrying and then you smile\nand it's such a beautiful smile and it's\nso genuine right\nand like\nif you're if if you're not really paying\nattention that seems great\nbut it's like wait where's the Croc like\nwhere did the crying girl go\nfor like a second\nI'm good I'm leaving tissue thank you\nlooks like the old wife is watching\n[Music]\nam I not being nice\nyeah\nI'm trying\nokay well that she's not ready for that\nmy wife said teach her how to send her\norder back in restaurants if she's not\nhappy with it and I said you're not\nready for that yeah I'm not ready for\nthat so that's an exercise that I give\npeople who like need to learn how to\nyeah like set boundaries and avoid\nconflict\nyeah it works really well but it's\nreally hard for people to do I don't\nthink you're there yet yeah I don't\nthink I could do it\nanyway so I'm sorry what you were asking\nabout the turning it on yeah so I just\nand and it's like\nand what I see in that moment is like a\nthis is going to be a strong word but a\ndisintegration of Who You Are and if you\nwant to like not burn out you can't keep\nseparating and like sacrificing one\npiece for like to make everybody else\nhappy and even on some level that makes\nyou happy too so it's not just other\npeople right\nyeah\num I think this kind of also ties back\nto a issue that I have is like a lot of\npeople\num not a lot of people but uh like\npeople on the internet like I read all\nthe comments on on like lsf and\neverything and they all like a lot of\npeople call me fake and which I I really\ndislike but now I'm like I don't even\nknow anymore like like I can't really\nlike is that like a symptom of fakeness\nwhat do you what'd you say\nto you if you were fake\nuh say that again what would it mean to\nyou if I said yes this is a symptom of\nfakeness\nI pronounce you fake\nthen I would be like\nI'm not fake because that's just who I\nam and then I would I would just like\ngo into defensive mode\nI guess yeah do you feel how do you feel\nabout being fake\nI don't like it because I would like to\nthink of that I I'm genuine myself\nbut\nI like I don't know all right so here\nhere's my take on it I don't think\nyou're fake I think it's disintegration\nso I think that you take the authentic\nyou can't fake it this far\nright you just can't like I think even\nwhen it goes back to the dumpling\nwatching Netflix like you can't\nyour curiosity your passion your genuine\nlike love of life I think comes through\nbut I I don't think it's the whole you\nand I think what some people may be\npicking up on is this\nback and forth does that yeah yeah that\ncan mix it like\nuh\nyeah I don't know like the whole fake\nfake discussion is like really confusing\nto me because I I'm always like oh but\nlike I'm just acting how I would act so\nthen but they're like oh she's like way\ntoo happy or like she there's no way\nthat she can always be so happy and I'm\nlike oh I just feel like I am I don't\nknow it's like\nand then if I if when you said like oh\nyou can see me like turn it on I'm like\noh then\nMaybe\nmaybe it's just like how\nI am to just be like always happy but\nthat's like the disintegration part\nwhere I do want to be sad but I feel\nlike a pressure on myself to always be\nhappy\nmm-hmm\nand so what is what does it mean to not\nbe happy\n[Music]\nuh\nuh to not be happy or is it okay to not\nbe happy\noh for sure yeah definitely like\num\nuh stream or yeah when I'm on stream\nit's important to me that I want to\nalways seem really happy and bubbly and\npositive because when I'm not on stream\nI'm not always happily bubbly and\npositive I'm like stressed a lot from\nthe from the burnout feeling right so\nit's like a two it is very like two\ndifferent dichotomies of what I deal\nwith every day it's just like I enjoy\nbeing really happy on stream because\nthat's like my happy place and like I\nlove doing IRL stuff and then when I'm\nnot on stream it's just like oh stress\noh what do I do next oh stuff like that\nso\nI don't know if I answer your question\nis it okay if you didn't\nit is okay\ndo you really feel that are you just\nsaying that because that's the right\nanswer\nuh\nI feel that yeah yeah it's okay if I\ndon't if I don't answer it properly\nbecause if you're if we'll we'll peel\nback the layers of the onion until we\nfind the right answer I mean the\nauthentic answer yeah\nyeah okay so I'll I'm not gonna let you\nslide\ngood with that's great okay\nyeah so I mean Emily here's what I'm\nkind of hearing and we can\nI don't know exactly where to go with\nthis but here's what I'm sort of I'm\nseeing one theme emerge which is I'm\ngonna call it the theme of\ndisintegration and I don't mean like\ndisintegrate like\nyou know the spell that makes things\ndisappear I mean literally is splitting\nup of the self\nand and so I kind of mentioned this\nearly on when I sort of said like oh it\nseems like you kind of hold both sides\nand then we sort of talk a little bit\nabout like being happy on stream and\nthen sad and and I think it makes a lot\nof sense to me that people can look at\nyou and think how can she be so happy\nbut I think it's like if you genuinely\nenjoy streaming and what you do in your\nlife is you take all of your negativity\nand you push it to the side and you let\nthat authentic positivity come out I\nthink that's probably part of the reason\nthat you've grown and you're successful\nand stuff like that because I think\npeople who fake being happy like we\nusually can pick up on it but I think\nsome people may be able to detect that\nthere is a that you're taking a neutron\nand you're splitting it into a proton\nand an electron and we're only getting\nthe proton\nokay yeah right and and I think we see\nthis in a microscopic way too even in\nterms of your like facial expressions\nand it's like you know it's like\nflipping the heart over it's like on the\nback it looks one way and then it's like\noh magic trick and it's like oh like now\nit's like the Ace of Spades and then\nit's like boom and now it's like oh look\nit's the back of the card and now it's a\ndifferent you know and so I I think we\nsee that and and I I don't and here's\nthe important thing to understand is\nthat I don't necessarily think you\nshould stop doing that that's for you to\ndecide but I think it's really important\nto understand that we all human beings\nwill separate things out like that's\njust how we cope with life we can't feel\neverything all the time but it's\nprobably going to be healthy for you as\nmy gas and from a burnout perspective\nbecause when I help people with burnout\nit's usually that the patterns that they\nengage in\nare driven by that separation because if\nyou're fully integrated with yourself\nyou would not engage in those behaviors\nin the same way and then the real\nconsequence of that is people don't want\nto integrate\nbecause they want to want to engage in\nthose behaviors\nbecause if you let the negativity in\nwhat would happen Emily\nbut then uh oh then I'm negative on\nstream\nuh I feel like\nas a streamer one of my main goals is to\nmake people laugh and stuff and like if\nI'm negative I don't want it to show\nthrough or not not yeah I'll say show\nthrough and then\nI don't know it's just like\nI want me to make people happy okay if\nI'm negative I feel like I can't make\npeople happy so I I detect a I'm maybe I\ndon't detect I'm hypothesizing so that's\na little bit unfair that there there is\na piece that's a PC answer is there more\nto it\nwhat's the question again what's the\nconsequence what's the problem of not\nbeing\nbubbly on stream what if you were\nnegative on stream what would happen\nwhat are you afraid of\nuh well\num\nlike is it negative all the time because\nI definitely have been negative but I\njust kind of like brush it off or I just\nsay like ah [ __ ] or like you know some\nexplicitive words uh and then uh I just\nlike move on yeah so so fair but what\nI'm sort of wondering about is you try\nnot to be negative right\nyou try to be positive\nuh\n[Music]\nlike if\nin a negative way I expressed it okay\nyeah\nso like if if I'm like annoyed by\nsomething like I've expressed that or I\nguess I don't really express it because\nI just I just fall silent whenever I'm\nannoyed I'm just like or like when I'm\ntired or something\nOkay so\nyeah I'm not but\nI'm like happy a lot on stream\nbecause it's fun to stream so yeah but\nif something does not happen negatively\nthen I I don't like try to push it down\nI just kind of like mention it and then\nmove on I I understand so let me just\nsee if I I kind of get this so like yeah\nyou're able to authentic authentically\nown negativity yeah\nas random events during streaming\nyeah right yeah with you yeah so so I I\nthink that that makes a lot of sense\nwhat I'm talking about is like you know\nthe part of you that's off stream and is\nterrified of analytics and stuff like\nthat like if that part infected\nthe stream Emily what would happen\num I just feel like it wouldn't be\nenjoyable to watch or listen to\num if I'm always like\ncomplaining or stressed I'm like oh chat\nI don't know what to do tomorrow oh and\nthen I just feel like it's something\nthat I should figure out on my own\ninstead of uh publicizing it to to chat\nokay and what is the consequence\nof\nnot being what chat wants\num\nthat's interesting uh so if I were to\nbring that negative enter like the\nnegative\nmindset into like my normal stream\nuh the consequence would be like\nI guess it would I don't know because\nyeah I've never done it I I I'm thinking\nlike maybe I would lose viewers but I\ndon't know if I actually would so now\nyou're actually thinking about it but\nyeah but I think there's a pretty loud\nvoice inside you that is saying don't\never [ __ ] do that\nyeah\nor like I just think it's just like so\nlike not needed to talk about on stream\nthat I I should never bring it up yeah I\nthink that kind of makes sense yeah it's\njust like a personal but I don't know I\nI'm noticing that when you sort of talk\nabout the consequences you're talking\nabout disappointing your viewers\nyeah yeah\nis that is there anything else that\nyou're worried about besides\ndisappointing your viewers\num\nI guess like just like the normal like\nfalling off or getting canceled is\nanother big worry\nor yeah people being like Oh her content\nisn't as good or she's getting\nstale or whatever\nso yeah\nyeah so\nokay so I you ask I'm asking questions a\ncouple of different ways yeah yeah and\nthis time I asked a question and what\ndid you notice in yourself\nuh I put on my smile again yep but\nbefore you put on your smile what did\nyou do\nuh my voice shaked yep yeah and what do\nyou know what you were feeling\nuh\nI was just like a\nI was either like nervous to answer or\nI'm like yeah yeah I think it's\nnervousness and what are you nervous\nabout like what do you think is going on\nthere what were we talking about do you\nremember\nuh we're talking about what\nuh\nlike what consequences I'm\nI'm scared of yep or I think and let me\nask that again okay is are you you're\ndoing great by the way\nand you got to let me know if I'm if\nthis is on I mean\nhard for me to tell what you actually\nwant from this so I'm I'm trying my best\nhere okay when it's not your fault it's\nnot you know you're you don't have to\nperfectly know what you want so\nlet's just under so like what are the\nconsequences that have you know so sure\nlike people may be disappointed but what\nwhat what's the consequence of that what\ndoes that mean for you\num the consequence of people\nuh\nuh uh you use the word stale\nyeah\nit's like oh her streams are getting\nboring or stale what happens when the\nviewership starts to drop\nthen I get into panic mode\nfor sure and then what happens\nand then I feel the pressure to do a\nbetter stream the next day\nand then if it's\nstill low I'm like oh gosh what do I do\neverything's falling apart uh\nbut then\nI kind of just asked for help oh that's\nthat's so healthy\nyeah I'm so happy that you do that yes I\nasked for help yeah so I mean I'm\nbecause I like\nI'm gonna come out come out and say it\nbecause I\nI don't know if we're beating around the\nbush or not or I don't know if I'm wrong\nhere I don't know if you're avoiding I\ndon't know what's going on but I I mean\nI think I think you fail\nright it all comes crumbling down\nand then you're now you're 27 and you've\ntried to be a streamer for a couple\nyears and it's it's Fallen apart around\nyou and then where are you what do your\nparents think what do people think you\nknow how do you how do you\nimpress people anymore got fired once\nthat sounded unpleasant\nyou know uh oh yeah that would not be\ngood\num if if it all falls apart but I have\ntold myself that if streaming doesn't\nwork out I'm gonna go get an MBA and\njust go back to corporate life so at\nleast I have a backup plan\nyes yes you do yes that's very\nhave you discussed that backup plan with\nyour parents uh they've always wanted me\nto get an MBA but I'm like parents let\nme do let me do my my passion I'm\nstreaming and they're like okay Emily so\nthey're supportive of me now but they\nthey are supportive of me before like\nwhen I first started streaming how did\nthat how did that how did they how did\nyou win them over how did they come uh\nbecause they saw I was actually making\nmoney so they're like okay great and and\nthen they're like good with it\nhow does that feel\num\nI wouldn't say I'm surprised but\nso I'm like not surprised that's how\nthey reacted but I'm happy that they\nsupport me now\nand it's kind of just like uh haha I\ntold you I would be able to be a good\nstreamer because they didn't believe in\nme for like the first few months or like\nyear\nso it's kind of like I told you so\nmoment\nwhat is it like to have parents that\ntheir support seems conditional\nwhat's that like\num\nI've gotten kind of used to it now it's\nkind of like\nuh like they're proud of me if I get\ngood grades and whatnot and they're\nproud of me if I am like a big streamer\nand I'm like thanks Mom and Dad so at\nthis point I'm I'm uh I'm used to it but\nI also like how my parents raised me\nI think yeah because I'm like oh I'm\nvery achievement driven\num\nbut sometimes I feel like that's where a\nlot of my stress comes from\nis uh\nmaking sure that I\nI think that's where a lot of my\npeople-pleasing aspects comes from it's\nfrom is from pleasing my parents okay\ncan you say a little bit more help us\nunderstand that a little bit\num so growing up it was like oh I always\nwant to get good grades and be uh be the\nfirst place in my piano competition so\nthen my parents will be happy with me\nand pleased and then\num then they'll be like great job Emily\nand I'm like okay great so\nthat's like a lot of my childhood is\nmaking sure I don't let them down\nyeah\nif that's like too strict or anything uh\nthat's just what I went through growing\nup a lot\nI'm not sure if that's\ncommon\nI'm just gonna think for a second okay\nokay yeah go ahead\nare you proud of yourself\nI'm proud of myself for sure\num I'm happy with uh my streaming career\nright now it's like oh everything's\ngoing great so I'm proud of how far I\nmade it as a streamer\nand graduating from college and doing\nthat stuff\nwhat are you feeling as you answer that\nquestion\nuh\nI feel really confident in that answer\nthat I'm proud of myself\nso so it seemed to me like your voice\nstarted shaking a little bit oh really\nyeah\nthis is\nso I don't know\num I I do I do feel very proud of myself\nthough I I think so too I think there's\na lot of genuine Pride there\nso when I asked you a little bit about\nyou know what what it was like sort of\nbeing very performance oriented with\nyour parents your answer was I've gotten\nused to it\nright think about that answer\nI've gotten used to it\num I think\nit sounds bad but it's just like how\nI've been raised my entire life so I\ndon't see any other\nway of being raised and it's just like\noh if you have good performance that's\nvery good stuff\nso were you jealous of other kids\ngrowing up\num\na lot of my childhood friends uh had\nvery similar upbringings especially so I\nwas in Nebraska right and then a lot of\nthe Chinese kids uh just knew each other\nbecause there's not a lot of Chinese\npeople in Nebraska so I I noticed that a\nlot of my Chinese friends had very\nsimilar upbringings and then\nuh when I would go to school I'd get\njealous of the kids that would have 10\npets because I wanted pets too so like\nso that was what I was jealous of but\nbecause I saw that a lot of people a lot\nof childhood friends of Chinese\nupbringing were similar to me I wasn't\nreally I like I was like oh this must be\nnormal\nI wasn't really that jealous\nthat we've talked about Emily what what\nseems interesting to you or what do you\nwant to talk more about\num I\nlike talking about\nthe disintegration part is really cool\nbecause I I definitely do\nI do I do exhibit that where it's like\noff stream I I never bring my off stream\ntroubles like I don't only talk about\nthem on stream\num like I'm wondering if that's healthy\nor not\nokay\nso I'm gonna give you a choice and you\ncan pick anything outside of the options\nthat I give you okay okay\nso we can approach that in one of two\nways I'm a little bit concerned about\nyou can do it the cathartic way\nwhich is I ask you questions\nthat make you cry\nokay and then you'll learn something\nabout yourself but I don't know exactly\nwhat you'll learn\nI'm a little bit hesitant to go down\nthat road because there's a part of me\nthat actually is sort of like I don't\nknow how ready for this you are and I\nalso don't know if that discussion\nshould be like live on stream TBH\nand I'm not trying and I even have to be\nI'm [ __ ] playing 5D chess in my head\nbecause if I say that to you are you\ngonna feel like oh my God like I've come\nacross this so weak that now I'm like\ndisappointing him and that's what he\nwants and so like I I you know because\nlike if I say oh we like I I don't\nyou're gonna have to help me out here\nbecause I yeah yeah I can't predict that\nfar right so it's got to be just like\nwe've got to figure this out and you're\nnot going to disappoint me at all I\ndon't think you're gonna disappoint\nanybody and here's the Wild Thing\nif you do [ __ ] them yeah [ __ ] them okay\nexactly so like right and so then the\nother option is that I can pull out the\niPad I can screen share with you and we\ncan understand disintegration\nI'm gonna do the first one okay [ __ ]\nbe cool\nall right\nI'm just okay I hope I can I can answer\nit properly\nI feel like answers are like so\nthink about me is that\nas as I should not should be but like\nI'm just not very self-aware yeah like\nlike going through life la la just doing\nwhat I can like doing streams talking\nabout stream and then that's it yeah\nyeah so okay so so let's So when you say\nyou've gotten used to it yeah\nwhat did you not say\nuh\nuh that\nuh I didn't say that it was a pretty\nstrict upbringing\nand\nI\nI didn't like it in the moment but in\nretrospect\nI think it was\ngood okay yeah so what you're doing is\nyou're taking chicken [ __ ] and you're\nturning it into chicken salad\nyum so so here's what's going on so when\nyou say I got that was your first answer\nokay I've got I got used to it\nwhat do you need what kinds of things do\nwe get used to Emily\nwe get used to taking hot showers\nokay okay\nso we get we get it's kind of like a\nread my mind question so like you don't\nget used to like do you ever get used to\ngetting hugs from a loved one you don't\nget used to that\noh right you don't get used to eating\nyour favorite food you get used to bad\nthings\noh\nyou see that yes okay yes yes okay that\nmakes sense so so and so like it's kind\nof interesting because like I I see you\ndoing this thing and this is the\ndisintegration so you're like dude\nyou're really good at gymnastics man\nyou're like I I got used to it\nuh-huh and now what you do and you're\nnot wrong this is you have a lot to be\ngrateful for from like the traditional\nAsian parent upbringing I mean like I\nkind of had it similar my parents were\nmore AFK so like I got away with a lot\nbut they were like my dad when I was\nnine years old was like I have an older\nbrother and he's like one one of you is\ngoing to be doctored and one of you is\ngoing to be loyal because he decided\nthat within the family if like one of us\nwas a doctor and one of us was a lawyer\nwe could handle most of the things and\nyou know that was like my upbringing\nbut like I think this is where kind of\nthis disintegration comes in is you you\njust can't [ __ ] own\nthat when things are bad\nright and it's like and I'm not blaming\nyou for that so let me know if I I'm\nafraid I'm gonna beat you up but you\nsaid you want to go for it so yeah I\ndon't even know if that's performative\nor not which is like\nokay so so you know and then you do this\nthing where it's like well now I'm\ngrateful\nuh-huh\nand it's like so let me ask you this\nuh-huh if you had a kid and I'm\npresuming you don't have kids who knows\nmaybe you've got kids\nbut if you had a kid how would you race\nthem\noh gosh yeah so like this is a\na debate that I go into my head like all\nthe time it's like oh do I be a tiger\nmom or do I be like really lenient\nbecause I don't know how I'm gonna be as\na mom I\nwould want them to get good grades\nkind of similar to how I was raised but\nnot as like and all be-all\nI would say but I do I would like be\nlike make sure to get good grades if\nyour kid got a B what would you say\nI would be like\nwhat happened here bucko and then they\nwould probably explain themselves and\nthen I'll be like okay well uh try\nharder next time\nyeah I think I would say that if your\nkid asks for a pet\nI'll be like are you ready for that\nand then probably like yes yes and I'll\nbe like no you're not I don't know about\nthat and then uh well I hope they'll\nhave a dog by then because I kind of\nwant a dog but uh if they want their own\npet I mean I give them like a hamster or\nsomething\nif they get all A's that's that semester\nas a reward\nand so what I'm hearing is that that\nthere's a lot of good stuff you've\nlearned from your parents\nand that there are some adjustments you\nwould make\nlike growing up without those\nadjustments\nuh\nit was like I had to do anything to\nsucceed so it\noh it like kind of made me into like a a\nlittle cheater oh my gosh oh I have this\nstory on on I told it on stream how um I\nwas doing like a practice ACT test and\nthen my dad was like oh my gosh you got\na 35 in English on your practice test\ngreat job but the reality is as I was\nlooking at the answer key because I was\nnervous that I would get a bad grade and\nand so then uh he like caught me looking\nat the answer key like the next time and\nthen he was really mad he tore up the he\nripped out the answer key and put it at\nthe neighbor's house\nto make sure I wouldn't cheat again so\nit was kind of like I would do anything\nto make it seem good in my parents eyes\nso\nokay yeah that was kind of unhealthy\nand yes how do you\nyou're telling the story like it's a\nfunny story\nOkay so\nit's funny that he put it to the gave it\nto the neighbor's house\nare there any other emotions that are\ntied to the story that\noh yeah fear from being caught uh\nwas it uh nervousness taking the while\nlooking\nand then\nuh just like\nyeah sadness\nafter\nokay\nso do you remember what it why can you\ntell us about why you started using the\nanswer key in the first place like do\nyou remember what you were thinking\nfeeling oh it's just like oh if I get a\nbad score they're they're gonna either\nmake me like study a lot more or they're\ngoing to be mad at me so I'm like I'll\njust guarantee my good score on the\npractice test by cheating\nokay so yeah so\nthat's not funny oh yes yes\nright and so I I see actually a lot of\ngenuine humor here so what I think is\nactually delightful and makes me really\nlike you\nis that when you are being admonished\nyou're a little mischievous\nso so it's almost weird because I feel\nlike you're back in school and I'm\ntrying to teach you about emotions and\nyou're like\nyeah so I I get a lot of genuine\npositivity from you when you're telling\nthe story but\nit's [ __ ] up yeah\nso if we're talking about reintegrating\nwe have to be able to feel those things\nand acknowledge the whole Spectrum\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nI just saw you go into to 4.0 student\nmode\nwait so\nuh can you see that last last sentence\nagain the 4.0 student mode oh the\nreintegrating yeah so you told a bad\nstory you told the story yes about\nhow you were so terrified of your\nparents that you were pushed to cheat\nand then\nwhen you cheated your parents really\nrewarded you\nright which was like awesome and relief\nbut also like kind of [ __ ] up and then\nthey eventually found out and then they\ntore it up which I imagine you were not\nlaughing about then yeah that was right\nright so you were probably crying and\nall that kind of stuff and then they\ntook it to the neighbor's house which I\nagree is like a really funny sort of you\nknow what's going on there but it's sort\nof like\nyou know it's like if I have a gigantic\npile of [ __ ] and I put a cherry on top\nit's like\nwhat we're eating here right the cherry\non top is like not really\nand and so it's interesting because\nbecause really this kind of emotional\nseparation is a well-known\num\nconsequence of of actually like sort of\nthe science of trauma so I'm not\ndiagnosing you with anything right you\nmay not really be diagnosable with\nanything it's completely fair but 60 of\npeople have traumatic experiences\ngrowing up and what our mind learns how\nto do is divide stuff so this is what's\nreally interesting when people are grow\nup in traumatic upbringing what they\nactually do is this is part of our brain\ncalled the corpus callosum which\nconnects our right hemisphere to our\nleft hemisphere left hemisphere is like\nanalysis\nright hemisphere is emotions\nand the corpus callosum the part that\nconnects the two actually becomes\nlike I mean it doesn't get severed or\nanything but the neuronal activity\nacross the corpus callosum drops oh okay\nif you grow up in like traumatic\nexperiences\nbecause what our brain literally learns\nhow to do is we have these emotions over\nhere and by the way language comes from\nthe left side as well\nso literally what happens is we cannot\nthe talking and the emotions become\ncompletely separate\ndoes that\nsound familiar to you\nyeah it does it's interesting I never\nthought of it like that so I'm learning\na lot how and so we should applaud you\nfor learning a lot right because that's\nwhat you're here to do\nyay how does that feel yeah see that's\nwe don't want to go there\nyou're not I mean I mean it's okay but\nnow so now I'm stuck with schoolgirl and\nif I say you're doing good then you're\nlike that opens up that thing and if I\nsay you're doing bad then it's like okay\nI'm now I'm admonished so uh I just\nnever thought of it like uh like trauma\nor anything yeah is that that word\ncarries like such heavy weight in my\nmind\nfor sure but it does make sense like the\nthe disintegration from yeah emotion and\nand so I I think when it comes to\nburnout like this is where there's like\na lot of other like really common stuff\nand I guess we're going into the lecture\nmode anyway but\nyou know I I think that really what\npeople make the best content when\nthey're emotionally integrated\nand they also are able to set limits\nbecause the other consequence that I see\nis that if you're not in tune with your\nnegativity\nhow do you know when it's getting out of\ncontrol\nso that's why people burn out\nbecause\nit's kind of like imagine you know I\ngive you numbing medication and you have\nlike a wound you're gonna keep using\nlet's say like you you're pulled muscle\nand I numb it up you're gonna keep\nwalking and you're going to keep\ndamaging the muscle and that's what ends\nup with burnout is lack of emotional\nintegration\num\nand I mean if so I'm gonna try this\nagain and we'll see what happens if\nthat's okay what was it like getting\nfired from Citibank\nuh\nI was\nreally\nshocked I first first I was shocked and\nI was like because\nI thought I was gonna get like uh\npromoted which is crazy because they\nthey told me that they found me\num streaming like in J in December but\nthen I found out that I was getting\nfired in June so I'm like oh it's\nalready June like like it's fine like\nthey probably forgot about it by then so\nthen when I found out that I was I got\nfired I was shocked I was like wait\nactually and then uh but I was also not\ntoo worried because I had streaming as\nmy\num backup plan it was like going really\nwell at that point\nso I was shocked and then I cried about\nit for\ntwo days after because I because I got\nfired and I'm like oh my God that's\ngonna look so bad on my record if I ever\ngo back to the corporate world or\nwhatever and it just doesn't look that\ngood so that's how I felt I think we're\njust those two emotions but also like oh\nI'll just full sense streaming then\nokay so I've asked you this question\ntwice and we got two very different\nanswers yeah yeah that's true how do you\nunderstand that\num it's like I think the first time I\nsaid like oh I was uh I was like really\nsad right and then I think now I'm able\nto\nthink more closely about my emotions and\nwhat I felt in the moment and\nkind of articulated a little better\nyes right so so so\nhere's the thing\nyou were feeling emotion\nor you are articulating\num\nright so like last time I don't know if\nyou remember but you literally sank into\nthe chair\nright you got emotional you were feeling\nthose emotions and so I I think that and\nnow as I'm reminding you of it what are\nyou feeling\noh right oh yeah that's I was I was\nI was crying\nmy one word on like oh God talk about\nfailure and then it's like oh I don't\nlike feeling like a failure and then I\njust like start melting right and if you\nstart crying on stream what's gonna\nhappen your numbers are gonna go down\nand then you're going to\ncry failure and fail yes and stress\nright all of that because I I think this\nthis is what it kind of comes down to is\nis understanding like sure I mean you're\ncrying stuff but I think you're\nterrified of failure for sure yeah and\nthat's something but is it okay to fail\nI just\nI think I know it's okay to fail but if\nI feel I'll be really sad right so so\nwhich part of your brain knows that it's\nthis is so this is the problem right and\nthis is where I think people sort of\nthink you're fake I don't think you're\nfake I think it's just you're just like\nyou're disintegrated\nbecause if you had a friend who failed\nreally it's okay yeah right you know you\ncan you can do better next time and it\ncould be a blessing in disguise and it\nseems like actually getting fired is one\nof the best things that could happen to\nyou TBH yeah for sure and and so you\nunderstand all that stuff but then apart\nfrom that there's like\nterrified Emily\ndo you know who I'm talking about\ncan you tell us a little bit about her\nterrified Emily uh she's the one who's\nlike\npretty insecure and she's nervous about\nfalling off and getting canceled\neveryone hating her that's the that's a\nterrified Emily who makes the PC Emily\ncome out because he's like don't get\ncanceled you know so it's like all these\ndifferent parts yeah in my brain for\nsure and and what what do you do with\nterrified Emily\n[Music]\num\nyour fight Emily\nuh\nhmm I'm not really like\nterrified outside of stream but it's\nlike kind of that aspect like that\nversion of her when I'm not streaming is\njust like the nervous Emily like the the\nscared Emily and then I'm just like I\njust try to figure out what to stream\nand whatnot\nand make sure that I have good content\nso I see her like\nkind of a lot when I'm stressed about\nstreaming yeah so I think you've you've\ndiscovered a couple of really important\nthings the first is that\nI'm gonna use the phrase State of\nConsciousness okay so terrified Emily is\na state of consciousness and you can\nsink further into that state or you can\ncome out of that state does that make\nsense yeah she's kind of there you can\nvisit her yeah now here's another really\ninteresting thing if she's terrified of\nsomething how do you deal with that you\nkind of said it already but I'm sort of\nasking you to re-articulate it uh\nwhat's the antidote to Terror if you're\nfeeling afraid of being a failure what\ndo you do\num I uh am I afraid of being a\nI just try\nto sit and think about\nhow to get better or like improve or I\njust just yeah just be like\nokay just think of something else okay\nso so let's let's understand this so\nright brain is feeling fear of failure\nlet me just think about whether I want\nto go on a tangent\nso you failed before right yeah yeah and\nthat's painful yes it's so painful I'm\ngonna kind of ask a leading question\nhere read my mind question you don't\nhave to end but like what did you decide\nwhen you failed like when you\nyou know did you have any like\nresolutions that you made or anything\nlike that uh I was like okay I want to\ntry to avoid This Feeling Again and so\nthen I was like okay just try not to\nfail so you don't have to feel this\nagain all right so so then so you made a\nresolution that never again\nit's hard for me to tell I would guess\nthat there's a lot of emotion when you\nmade that decision I would guess that\nyou said to yourself never again never\nagain never again I'm not hearing that\nfrom you so I don't know if I'm off\nwhich I very well could be because I\nwasn't there and I certainly can't read\nyour mind or whether there's some amount\nof emotional like turning down the\nvolume on the way that you represent it\ndoes that make sense which one do you\nthink it is do you think you're turning\ndown the volume or do you think I'm off\nI think it's the volume yeah yeah so so\nbecause because then what happened is\nyou were like okay so but now what's\nreally interesting is when you get an\nemotion\nyou don't fix it on the right hemisphere\nyou jump over to the left hemisphere and\nyou say to yourself\nwhat are the things that I can do\noutside of here right that can assure\ncan protect me from failure yeah exactly\nexactly is it okay to fail\nyes no it's not what the [ __ ]\nit's not for yeah for me it's not\nyeah\nbut so I was like I just hate I hate the\nfeeling of failure so then I'm like okay\ndo not fail\nright and then is it okay\nto feel terrified of failure\nno\nit is not okay I have to be you have to\nbe positive Emily is failing I'll ask\nyou again\nand let me know if I terrify you too\nmuch from a school girl standpoint okay\nis it okay to fail\nno\nnot for me how does it feel to say that\nlike\nI'm like coming to to I'm like I'm like\nrealizing like oh how\nhigh of an expectation that is on myself\nand what does it do to you to have that\nto carry that expectation around\nI just like have so much more stress I\nthink with that expectation\nhow how would you feel about\nI'm trying to figure out how to ask this\nhow this could be hard so we'll try a\ncouple times okay okay how do you feel\nif you were to like step outside of\nyourself and you were to look at\nyourself how would you feel about this\nperson and the way that they're living\ntheir life\num I would think that they're being\nreally hard on themselves\nand\nlike they're doing great like stepstream\nis going well they have a lot of great\nfriends surrounded by a lot of great\npeople I'm like why is she why is she\nfeeling like that like she's doing great\nand she shouldn't be too yeah too hard\non herself that's what I would think\nokay so let's notice a couple of other\nthings\ngreat she has so many friends are you\nsmiling Emily yep\nno you're not you're crying what oh but\nI'm smiling through the tears right yeah\nyeah yeah I mean yeah so so earlier\nwe're telling traumatic stories and\nwe're grinning right because they're\nfunny because it's [ __ ] sandwich with a\ncherry on top\nand now we're talking about how you're\ndoing so well and how do you feel about\nher\num I feel like\nuh she should just relax a little more\nokay so now we're seeing some some\ndifficulty because she should relax\nthat's what you [ __ ] tell yourself\nand I think why does she feel this way\nbut what I'm hearing is that you feel\nsad for her like what I see in your\nemotions I don't know if you feel sad\nyeah yeah there's also\nit's tragic\noh tragic oh gosh yes that's very very\nsad yes yeah yes can something about you\nbe tragic that because think about it\nright because that's what you're sort of\nsaying you were like wow she's like God\nso like she's like young and she's\nsuccessful and she's bounced back and\nshe's so capable and she's got so many\nfriends and she's got her whole life\nahead of her and this poor girl it's\ntragic that she can't even enjoy it\nthat every day that goes by she's not\nable to relax and enjoy what she's\nworked so hard for\nthat she's doing everything right and\nshe doesn't deserve this\nyeah that that sounds about right it\nreminds me of like when I have like a\nreally good stream I'm like I like I'm\nlike oh it was it was all right like\nafter it but then when I have a like a\nnot as good stream I'm like oh that was\nhorrible but I don't really celebrate\nthe the wins as much as I should\nyeah\nlike yeah so it's a little tragic right\nyeah a little tragic a little tragic\nright so so I I'm\nI'm trying to kind of we're co-op in\nhere\nokay so like I'm using heavier words but\nokay what I notice in your emotional\nresponse is I think resonance\nunless you're\nfaking it and the little cheater is\nmanipulating me which I maybe I mean you\nknow you're smarter than I am for sure I\nsure as hell didn't graduate from\nColumbia magna [ __ ] laude but\ndoes that make sense yeah it's\ndefinitely resonating\nfor sure so\nyou know\nwhere are you now\nlike we've been at this for about an\nhour and a half just like where are you\nuh yeah\nfast\nstream versus off stream for sure and\num\nI I don't know I've had a lot of great\ntakeaways like it's okay to fail and and\nthis recent discussion it's like\nlike it is really tragic how hard I am\non myself and it really puts things into\nperspective\nand and do you have any thoughts\nI know we've been kind of all over the\nplace but I'm curious about is there\nanything that you think you can take\nforward from this conversation\nif not I'm going to lay it out I'm going\nto lay it out either way but I'm just\ncurious you know what to include and\nwhat not to include and if the answer is\nnothing that's totally fine\n[Music]\nokay to be\nside on Street\nthat's fine yeah that's not a takeaway\noh okay okay uh takeaway is just uh\ndon't\noh but it's so hard I can't stop doing\nthat you're not gonna be able to stop\nthat either okay good gosh okay so yeah\nso neither of those are uh\nyeah okay good thank you so much so now\nso here's here's the here's a takeaway\nthat I think may be more digestible for\nyou okay okay so both of those are\nthings that you should do right\nbut\nI say this with love you're not capable\nyet how does it feel to not be capable\nof what you should do\nuh it's a\na little unfortunate I feel like it's\nlike oh kind of back to the failure\nfeeling like I can't even do that but I\nI can just see in myself that I can't\nstop doing those two things yeah so so\nthis is something that's really\nimportant to understand\nwhen we're faced with failure what we\nwant to do is no longer be a failure\nand what you you've been taught your\nwhole life which parents and now\nanalytics is teaching you the same thing\nis that your value as a human being can\nbe measured by a grade by a concurrent\nviewer account by all kinds of stuff\nis your value as a person yeah it's sad\nI'm a hundred percent sure that you know\nthat your value there's a part of you\nthat knows that your value as a person\ngoes Way Beyond and is completely\nindependent of any metric I can see that\nbecause if you didn't have that you'd be\ndifferent\nthe problem is that the moments that\nit's like one person's in the driver's\nseat right either like\nthere's like Emily who loves herself and\nEmily whose love is conditional\nso what you probably need to do I I\ndon't think you can be sad on stream yet\nit's going to be way too terrified\nterrifying the failure part of you is\ntoo strong\ntotally fine totally fine so the first\nthing is that if you're a failure that's\nokay\nmost people deal with being a failure as\nI need to succeed\nif you really want to conquer the\nfeeling of failure the problem is that\nif you succeed you are just reinforcing\nthe idea that failure and success\ndetermines your worth so when I ask you\nhow when you feel like you're failure\nwhat do you do you say you fix it\nthat's what good little kids do they fix\nit right right right\nso what that sort of reinforces is once\nagain this idea that your value is tied\nto a particular metric so oddly enough\nand I'm I kind of TD up and hopefully\nyou can hear this if you can't that's\nokay too\nif you can't do what I'm asking of you\nthat's okay\nwhatever you can do is okay\nyou don't have to do everything now\nyou're not going to Peak by the age of\n30 trust me\nyou'll do great like I have so much\nfaith in you and no matter what you do I\nthink that if you get fired that's\nyou're going to be fine if you get\ncanceled you're going to be fine\nyou're gonna be fine\nso try to understand that as a failure\nlike it's actually okay to fail\nsecond thing is that just pay attention\nto any moment of disintegration\nwhich is like it's not about stream it's\nnot about failure or anything like that\nit's just like notice those moments in\nyour life where you smile\nand it's not that you have to change\nit's just that you have to notice and\nthen ask yourself okay like what else\ncould I be feeling\nthird thing\nis\nthink about so it didn't really work\nwith the kid sometimes it works with the\nkid you can write these down I can do\nyou afterwards\num\noftentimes if I ask people about their\nkids they're able to like sort of start\ncrying and realize like okay like I\ndon't want to raise my kids the way that\nI was raised it seems like the tiger\nparent is genetically\nyou know\nadjustments but we didn't quite get\nthere the way that I was shooting for\nbut when I asked you about your\nexternalizing yourself\nokay looks like it there's some someone\nworking outside\nso I think I would encourage you to do\nthat externalizing yourself exercise\nso this is where think about okay like\nhow would I think about this person like\nshe's feeling this way she's beating\nherself up and I think you did something\nthat's actually really important so this\nis you stumbled upon a very important\nrealization if you look at people who\nare burnt out\nthere's one cognitive thing that they do\nwhich is they move their W's into the L\ncolumn\nso they do not celebrate their wins\nokay there's something else that's\nreally interesting and you may notice\nwe'll see if you do this or not when\nthings go well for you what's\nresponsible\nuh not me\nand when things go well for other people\nwhat's responsible them when things go\nwrong for you whose fault is it mine\nwhen things don't go well for other\npeople whose fault is it\nthings they can't control\nbeautiful have you studied this before I\nhave not but that makes a lot of sense\noh my God I literally could not have\nsaid it better myself literally I could\nnot I've never said it might that well\nmyself\nyeah so so this is also really important\nto understand\num can you hold on just one second I'm\ngonna see if we can get whoever is doing\nthis work to\nso if we talk about literally burnout\nokay\na big part of that is like these\ncognitive things it's hard to believe\nbut as you engage in these cognitive\npatterns it changes the way that\nyou like move through life\nso if you can change these couple of\nthings first is that when you win when\nyou have a win\nyou're going to naturally think about\nall the reasons you got lucky you don't\nhave to dismiss those we don't have to\nconvince you that those it's just can\nyou add is there anything you can take\ncredit for\nuh it was a good idea that I could that\nI thought of exactly right so it was a\ngood idea like hey like I woke up today\nI went through my morning routine\nyou know I like picked a good restaurant\nlike there's a lot of things that like I\nlike I did something to deserve this too\nand you don't have to make a laundry\nlist just try to add one thing yeah on\nthe flip side when you lose all my fault\nis there anything any kind of RNG\nbecause you play some games on stream\nright yeah yeah so is there any kind of\nRNG here that is out of my control\nso like literally go through that when\nyou have a win and a loss you could also\napply it to other people if you want to\nin the reverse of like okay what did\nthey do to just like you know how do\nthey get lucky if they win how did they\nhow are they responsible if they screwed\nup\num that's also\nthis is a conversation maybe for a\ndifferent day or never but when it comes\nto relationships if you're a people\npleaser that's going to be really\nimportant because if if the fault is\nalways yours\nand they never do anything wrong and\nyou're a people pleaser you can create a\nlot of unhealthy Dynamics over time\nso holding people accountable can be\nhard for people Pleasers and is related\nto this this thing you see how it's like\nbecause you treat yourself differently\nfrom other people yeah\nso in terms of like concrete stuff\nI would say just like change that a\nlittle bit and then just just feel your\nemotions like it's okay\nyeah you know and and just like and I it\nsounds like you do\nactually that's that's not right so it\nsounds like you actually feel your\nemotions a lot you let yourself feel\nyour emotions a lot you'll call your cry\nfor two days and then you kind of pick\nyourself up\num\nI'm not quite sure but I'd say just so\nmaybe just stick with that awareness of\ncan I see the flip side of this emotion\nor can I see the flip side of this\nscenario and acknowledge like what is\nthe other side of this because it comes\nback down to this the statement of\nI've gotten used to it\nyou're not ready to say it sucked\nbecause if you say it sucked that means\nyou're blaming your parents and you are\nnot allowed to do that because you're so\ngrateful for them because they did\ngenuinely give you lots of stuff right\nright you wouldn't be where you are\nwithout them so how can you blame them\nexactly yeah\ntextbook\nright so so but as you go through this\nyou'll be able to hopefully one day say\nthere's a lot of stuff that I'm grateful\nfor\nthere's a lot of stuff that they\nactually like did that hurt me a lot\nmy upbringing was actually like really\nsad in a lot of ways and I missed out on\nbeing a child in a lot of ways\nand I'm never going to get those years\nback\nand I love them they kind of did the\nbest that they could\nyou don't have to blame them for\nacknowledging that something hurt\nand you can also this is the other\ntricky thing we're not going to get into\nthis today but\nthe other problem is that unless you\nblame them you can't forgive them\nand that can cause a big problem\nso this is something I've seen time and\ntime again where if you don't blame your\nparents and you can't forgive them and\nthen you're carrying around resentment\nand you suppress it and deny it and all\nthis kind of other crap\nbut that's\nend game content\nquestions thoughts\nuh so when you said like not really\ncelebrating your W's but moving them to\nthe L is that a is that like with\nburnout is that what you said so it\nhappens in Burnout and imposter syndrome\nokay got it we haven't talked about\nimposter syndrome with you right yeah\nokay yeah I just wanted to make sure so\nokay so that\nso the noticing like oh what I was\nresponsible for for the W can kind of\nhelp with the whole burnout thing and\njust being more aware of my successes\nyep absolutely right so you're you're\nplaying a game where\nyour\nyour Q like you just don't get to win\nand so like literally you're gonna burn\nout\nand then I think the other thing that\nhappens is that when you don't celebrate\nyour W's\nso when you have a win you double down\nand you work harder\nwhether you have a lose you double down\nyou work harder no matter what happens\nyou're working harder you're working\nharder you're working harder and then\nwhat we tend to see is that that's very\nadaptive for streamers but very few of\nthem\ncan sustain that so some can and the\nmost successful ones manage to find\ntheir own equilibrium they kind of\nDiscover it but what we found is we\nworked with about 400 content creators\nat this point and what we found is that\ntheir lives get better and their actual\nperformance improves\nso like their concurrent view counts\nthings like that like they're even if\nstreaming hours go down their\nperformance goes on\nI will send you the report once it's\nfinalized yeah be a great read thank\nyou other questions\nuh that's it for me just thank you again\nyou're very welcome it was it was really\neye-opening for sure it's good I had a\ngreat time you want one final test\nbecause you're being such a good student\ntoday\nbetter\nI\nI I\num I like the flow of the conversation\nso uh like the open-ended endedness is\nis really nice like being able to just\nfollow whatever\nuh\nI think something that could improve\nthe experience\nuh wait are you sitting like a like a\nsummary of it at the end\nlike am I gonna DM you a summary of what\nwe talked about\nyeah\nI wasn't planning on it then that's how\nyou can\nokay\nsure yes because I thought this was a\nreally great a really great talk I'll\ndefinitely be re-watching the VOD for\nsure give it a week okay don't watch it\nfor a week okay give it a week get get\nout of your own head first okay that\nthat sounds good so that'll be my my\nImprovement uh Improvement I'm I'm very\nproud and impressed because I was\nterrified that you were going to say oh\nno you can't do anything better and it\nwas great thank you so much and all this\nkind of stuff\nI came up with something yeah you did I\nwas like it sounds like it would be good\nso I'll also I'll collect I'll share\nsome thoughts and we'll try to summarize\ncool any other thoughts questions\nI feel like we're at a good stopping\npoint yeah and this is perfect uh no\nthank you again it's been a great uh\ngreat time being a guest here yeah thank\nyou so much for coming on and sharing\neverything that you have to share\nof course it was great so have a great\nday for your day you
