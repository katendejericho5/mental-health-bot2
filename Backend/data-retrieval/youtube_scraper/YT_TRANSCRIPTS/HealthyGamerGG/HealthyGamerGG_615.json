    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nstop overthinking\nthe biggest problem with overthinking\nisn't simply that we do it it's that\ndespite thinking about things over and\nover and over again it doesn't actually\nhelp us solve our problems in fact if\nyou really pay attention the more you\noverthink the more you actually end up\nscrewing up and chances are if you\noverthink and it still causes you\nproblems you've actually been scammed\nand you may Wonder scammed by who turns\nout scammed by all of society so in\nsociety we have this belief that IQ are\nthinking leads to success we're taught\nthis kind of story that the smarter you\nare oh if you're in gifted and talented\nclasses you're in honors classes or\nwhatever if your IQ is high and you're\ngood at thinking you will be successful\nin fact we actually assume that thinking\nleads to improvements in performance but\nif you actually look at the data\nsometimes thinking actually makes things\nharder for us and leads to decreases in\nperformance hey just a quick note a lot\nof people will ask us what do I do next\nand that's why we built Dr K's guide\nIt's a comprehensive resource that\ndistills over 20 years of my experience\nboth as a monk and as a psychiatrist and\nit's designed in a way that's tailored\nto fit your needs so if you're\ninterested in better understanding your\nmind and taking control of your life\ncheck out the link below so this is the\ncore scam of overthinking that we've\nbeen taught that thinking is actually a\nsolution to a problem which is why we\nkeep doing it right we think okay if I\ncan think my way if I can think about it\nagain and again and again eventually I\nwill figure out a solution but we don't\nreally realize that if you really look\nat the data thinking is not actually the\nbest way to get to a solution and in\nfact thinking can actually be a problem\nin and of itself which is precisely why\ndespite all this overthinking we still\nscrew up so the First Data that we're\ngoing to look at actually comes from\nMensa so Mensa is an organization of\nworldwide Geniuses in order to join\nMensa you have to have an IQ in the top\ntwo percent of the population so you got\nto be super super smart\nit turns out that if you look at the\nactual income of Mensa earners things\nseem to get a little bit tricky so the\ntop point five percent of earners in\nMensa this means the richest people in\nMensa have a median income of two\nhundred and fifty thousand dollars a\nyear or more if you look at the top\npoint five percent of earners in the\nUnited States who aren't necessarily\nGeniuses their income is about two\nmillion dollars a year or more so this\nis kind of shocking because we're\ntalking about the half percent of the\nbest earners of the smartest people in\nthe world and they make 250k a year and\nyou're looking at the half percent of\nbest earners in the general U.S\npopulation and they're making millions\nof dollars a year and so this is kind of\nconfusing right because I thought IQ and\nthe ability of thought led to success\nand it turns out that that's simply not\ntrue we can also see this in communities\nwhere people Theory crack after their\nway to conclusions in a ridiculous place\nthat you kind of see this is if you ever\ngo to 4chan and you listen to what they\nsay about relationships and sex you'll\ndiscover that they have thought\nthemselves into all kinds of idiocy so\nmy favorite example of this is I was\nreading 4chan one day because God knows\nwhy\nand and what I've sort of discovered is\nthere's a community of people on the\ninternet who have concluded that if a\nwoman has sex with multiple men it leads\nto a loosening of the vagina right so\nthese are people who have Theory crafted\ntheir way into this they think about it\na lot and they discuss a lot and they\nkind of discover this kind of truism\nwhich they all believe because it's\nlogically correct that sex with a lot of\nmen leads to loose vaginas and it's kind\nof like if you stop and think about it\nfor a second right if you use any actual\ndata to examine this you'll discover\nthat it's absolute BS the first question\nis how does the vagina know if it's\nmultiple penises or one penis like being\ninserted over and over and over again\nhow does a monogamous relationship with\nlots of sexual intercourse not lead to a\nloosening of the vagina and there's even\nmore simple data that we can can kind of\nlook at which is like if I take really\nbig bites of stuff right if I eat lots\nof different food like hot dogs and\nhamburgers and burritos and I'm taking\nbig bites of things it's not like my\nmouth gets all like like Lucid like\nstuff is leaking out like it's\nabsolutely absurd that's not actually\nhow the elasticity of human body parts\nwork at all and so what are we kind of\ntaking away from this what we should\nreally understand is that IQ our\nthinking cannot be a substitute for\nother things that just thinking about\nstuff doesn't necessarily improve our\nperformance in various areas\nand we kind of understand this from\nsituations like social anxiety so if you\nlook at it from a more clinical\nperspective people with social anxiety\nwill overthink right so when they enter\nsocial situations they'll think about\nsomething they'll think about it again\nthey'll think about it ahead of time\nthey'll think about it you know\nafterwards and even while they're there\nthey're so absorbed in their thoughts\nthat not only does the thinking not help\nthe thinking actually hurts it actually\nnegatively improves performance and you\ncan understand this really well with a\nvery simple example so if you walk do\nyou think about walking and if you ever\ntry to walk while thinking about walking\nlike if you actually think about okay\nnow I'm gonna move this foot and now I'm\ngoing to pick up this foot and now I'm\ngoing to contract this muscle and then\nI'm going to relax this muscle and I'm\ngoing to lift my toes here the more that\nyou think about walking the actually\nharder it becomes and so this is the big\nproblem with people who are overthinkers\nis that we use thought as a substitute\nfor learning if we really look at the\noptimal way in which the Mind solves\nproblems it's not actually with Theory\ncrafting it's with learning and\nexperience\nand so if you're someone who's in a\nsocial anxiety kind of situation or you\nhave social anxiety one of the\ntreatments of social anxiety is to\nactually give this person data I'm not\ntalking about doing research about\nreading about theories of social anxiety\non the internet what I'm saying is that\nif you actually want to perform well in\nlife what you need to do is give your\nbrain data give it experience that it\ncan actually learn from and adapt to and\nif you sort of think a little bit about\nokay when does my brain perform\noptimally it's not when I Theory craft\nmy way all the way to the moon it's\nactually when I give my brain data sets\nand we sort of know this from like\nplaying games like you can Theory craft\nas much as you want to but a thousand\nhours of theory crafting is not a\nsubstitute for a thousand hours of\ngameplay right and this is kind of what\nwe see in social anxiety is that when\npeople are sort of stuck in their own\nheads one of the best treatments for it\nis some amount of exposure therapy some\namount of actually getting out there and\nit's experiencing different kinds of\nthings and when we experience these\nsorts of things it activates other parts\nof our brain so we'll sort of activate\nour empathy circuitry we'll activate our\nlearning circuitry and if you kind of\nthink about challenges that you face the\nmore experience you get with them the\neasier they become and that's not\nbecause you've thought your way to\nsuccess it's actually because you're\nutilizing all of these other parts of\nthe brain\nand here's the real tragedy of people\nwho overthink is that the more that you\nthink the more that the other parts of\nyour brain become Rusty and this is\nespecially true of kids with high IQ\nbecause early on what do we learn if\nwe've got high IQ we learn that there's\none tool which can work really really\nwell for all kinds of different things\nand the more that we start relying on\nour IQ the more that we start relying on\nour thought process the more atrophied\nother parts of our brain become\nand so if you're struggling with\noverthinking and you're kind of\nwondering okay how do I think my way to\na solution the first thing that you need\nto understand is that you can't really\nthink your way to a solution and not\nonly can you not necessarily think your\nway to a solution that thinking may\nactually impede your chances of success\nthat the more that you try to think your\nway to a solution the worse the solution\nis going to be or the worse your actual\nperformance is going to be and how do\nyou fix this problem you actually just\nneed to give your brain data you need to\ngive it the opportunity to learn and so\nI'm going to leave y'all with a little\nbit of wisdom from the realm of go so go\nis an ancient board game also applies to\nthings like chess which is that if you\nwant to be good at go what you need to\ndo is lose your first hundred games as\nfast as you can because all the people\nwho are learning go sort of figured out\nthat okay there's no substitute for\nactually playing the game and so if\nyou're struggling with a particular\nproblem that you're overthinking I know\nit sounds kind of scary but probably\nwhat you need to do is learn instead of\nthink give your brain data and this is\nwhat's so crippling and paralyzing is\nthat when we think about okay how do I\nlearn we think that that process of\nlearning is going to be incredibly\npainful how do I get this person to\nagree to come to my birthday party how\ndo I get this person to like me and so\nwe think about this over and over and\nover again but we can't ever come to a\nreal solution instead if you really want\nto learn how to socialize with someone\nand how to be accepted the real solution\nis that you try something right you\ndon't sit at home and think about it you\ntry something and you kind of\nacknowledge that this may not work out\nbut on the upside the next time around\nthat I meet someone I will have more\ndata and I will actually get better at\nthis\nand so just to summarize if you even\nthink about you know how do you want to\ndefeat a particular boss in a video game\nthe solution is not endless Theory\ncrafting and you all may have even seen\narguments with like noobs on the\ninternet who are low MMR and will Theory\ncraft their way into arguments with\npeople who are way better than them at\nthe game and the thing is that you can\nargue about against this Noob on the\ninternet you can be way better than them\nbut no amount of intellectual\nmasturbation is going to ever convince\nthem what's the only way that they are\ngoing to learn by actually doing\nsomething so if you're crippled with\noverthinking acknowledge that some kind\nof attempt is going to be anxiety\nprovoking maybe breathe into it a little\nbit you know check out some of the\nYouTube videos that we have on\nmeditation check out Dr K's guide to\nanxiety and things like that and really\nkind of acknowledge your fear and then\ntry to actually learn instead of solve\nthe problem\n[Music]\nthank you"
