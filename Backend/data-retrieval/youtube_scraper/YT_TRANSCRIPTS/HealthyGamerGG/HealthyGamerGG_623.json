    "transcript": "and I'll see this a lot because I'll\nadvise people who want to go to med\nschool and I'll ask them why do you want\nto go to med school and they give me\nsome BS answer about helping people and\nthey're like I want to help people and\nit's like why don't you go work in a\nsoup kitchen you have to go to school\nfor four years for that and help people\ntoday they're like uh and then it's like\nwhy do you want to go to med school like\nI don't know you want to do it for the\nprestige and the money and to make your\nparents proud let's be honest and\nthey're like yeah and then you can work\nfrom there right okay so like that's not\ngonna work dude you're gonna burn out so\nI think why it's hard to find purpose is\nliterally this is more from a yogic\nperspective but our attention is no\nlonger directed internally so what we\nend up with is a life of shoulds and\nwhere does a should come from a should\ncomes from the outside it comes from the\nexpectation of other people and then our\npurpose actually comes from within and\nso the more that we spend the more our\nattention gets pulled into things\noutside of us the more we lose sight of\nlike what we want"
