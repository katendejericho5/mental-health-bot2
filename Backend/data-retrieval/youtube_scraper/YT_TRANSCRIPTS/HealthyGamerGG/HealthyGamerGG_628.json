    "transcript": "one of the earliest things you learn in\ntrauma is that anger is risky so what\nyou see in trauma responses is that\npeople learn to displace their anger\ninto safe environments kids who are\ntraumatized at home will bully the\nsmallest kid in the class because I have\nall this anger what am I supposed to do\nwith it I can safely express it if I'm\npicking on a little kid yeah whereas if\nI get angry at my parents for being mean\nto me then I get punished because\nthere's one place where I can safely\nExpress anger and there's basically no\nconsequences which is the internet so I\ncan rage on the internet all day long I\ncan rage about all these injustices I\ncan even rage at people I can get banned\nand I can just make another account and\nso I can go on expressing this impotent\nrage you know I think some people think\nthat they feel better releasing it but I\nthink it actually turns into just a\nbigger rolling ball I think that\nactivating that angry part of yourself\nand putting it out there it actually\ncreates a bigger anger the two almost\ndidn't have before like a bitterness too\nabsolutely"
