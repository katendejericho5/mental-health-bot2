    "transcript": "one thing I would say is really common\namongst Gamers though is something that\nI would call The Logical red herring\nwhich is why they fail in therapy Gamers\nwill go in they'll have some traumatic\nevent and then they'll have some other\nevent that they have logically deduced\nis the source of their problems and so\nthey'll come into therapy and they'll\nsay this is my problem and they'll talk\nabout it and talk about it and talk\nabout it and you don't ever get anywhere\nyou don't get to the big boulder that\nwas behind exactly so like what ends up\nhappening is they're like misdirecting\nit's like some kind of illusion magic\nI'm gonna take my repression and I'm\ngonna like make it a problem and this is\nwhat determines my life oh I like this\nhappened or this happened and so we end\nup getting stuck because they keep on\npointing all of the therapeutic energy\nat the wrong thing and the reason they\ndo that is because this hurts and I\ndon't want anyone to know about this so\ninstead what I'm gonna do is construct a\nnarrative because I'm so smart\nthat fits what people go to therapy for"
