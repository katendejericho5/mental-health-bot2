    "video_title": "Let's Talk about Brain Cells",
    "transcript": "generally speaking when we are born most\nof the neurogenesis which is the\ndevelopment of brain cells is already\ndone so we don't really grow a whole lot\nof new brain cells this is why patients\nwho have strokes kind of like that part\nof your brain doesn't really regenerate\nso sometimes Strokes will lead to\npermanent deficits it turns out that\nthere's one part of the brain in which\nwe see neurogenesis and that's in the\nhippocampus the hippocampus is the part\nof our brain that governs learning and\nmemory and so it would make sense that\nif we're going to create new neurons the\none part of our brain where we would do\nthat is where we learn new things and\nform new memories if I learn to play an\ninstrument at the age of 20 or you know\nI go on vacation at the age of 30 or if\nI have my first child I'm constantly\nforming new memories and learning new\nthings and so it also makes sense that\nif that neurogenesis in the hippocampus\nis inhibited in some way then we may not\nbe able to learn from our mistakes"
