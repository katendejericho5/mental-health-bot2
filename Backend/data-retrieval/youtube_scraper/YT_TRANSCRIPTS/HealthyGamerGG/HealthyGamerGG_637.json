    "transcript": "if we think about caffeine for example\nthe first time you have caffeine it'll\ncompletely wire you but if you have\ncaffeine every day your body develops\ntolerance to it and then you kind of\nbecome dependent on it that means that\nin the absence of caffeine you will\nexperience withdrawal because your body\nis used to that substance floating\naround and when it's no longer there\nyour body kind of like craves that\nsubstance so in some cases this\nphysiologic dependence can be like very\nprofound and very damaging so in the\ncase of alcohol use dependence or\nbenzodiazepine which are these drugs\nlike Lorazepam or Valium Xanax Pam\nthings like that this tolerance that we\ncan develop can be so profound that in\nthe absence of the substance it can\nactually induce seizures so what tends\nto happen is that once we use a lot of\nsubstance like we're getting a high\nsignal so what our brain kind of does is\nturns down the volume on that signal and\nthen in the absence of that there's sort\nof like a withdrawal experience that you\nhave"
