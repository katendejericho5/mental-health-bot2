    "transcript": "sometimes in life we sort of feel like\nwe're an NPC we're not living Our Lives\nas player characters right so a player\ncharacter decides what they're going to\ndo they're going to be pursuing main\nquests they're going to be going here\nand going there and there's some degree\nof advancement but some of us feel like\nwe're NPCs and what we're sort of doing\nis we're just existing in our little\ncorner of the world and we're not even\nsaying anything or doing anything until\nsomeone else comes along and when they\ninteract with us when they right click\nus that's when we start to go through\nthis dialogue and we become active and\nthis is exactly what happens in this\ntrauma response because you can't live a\nlife with intention you're living life\nvery reactively and it requires external\nstimuli to motivate you to action so if\nyou're someone who's sort of living life\nas an NPC it may not be due to lack of\nwillpower or discipline it may simply be\ndue to this sort of stealth and very\ncommon trauma response that affects up\nto 50 percent of people"
