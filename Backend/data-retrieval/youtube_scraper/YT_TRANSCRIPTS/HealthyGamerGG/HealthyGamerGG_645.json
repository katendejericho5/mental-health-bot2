    "transcript": "a lot of people out there who struggle\nwith depression or even subclinical\ndepression where they don't necessarily\nhave a diagnosis will struggle to pull\nthemselves out of it they'll analyze\ntheir situation and they'll recognize\nokay I need to do this or I need to do\nthis but they can't seem to despite all\nthe logic bring themselves out of it and\non the flip side we also have something\nincredibly scary which is that sometimes\nwhen people are really really depressed\nor even things like suicidal they're\nactually really logical about it and\nthis is what's really challenging is if\nyou try to talk to these people you'll\noftentimes find that they their logic is\nactually really sound and even in the\ncases when it's not really sound you can\ntry to convince them otherwise but it\nseems like you sometimes hit a brick\nwall and if you're struggling in this\nway you may have noticed that you may\ntry to argue against yourself but your\nmind always comes to the same conclusion"
