    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nstop living life on autopilot\nin my Psychiatry practice I would get\ntons of patients who would come in with\nessentially this complaint and they\nwould look slightly differently so\npeople would come in with something like\nchronic depression or people who've been\ndepressed their whole life other times\nit would be people like students who\nthey could study for a test but\ntheoretically they know they should be\nnetworking or they should be doing\nextracurriculars and they couldn't seem\nto motivate themselves towards actually\nmoving towards something\nand so it seemed like there were almost\ntwo groups of people there's this group\nof people out there who sort of thinks\nabout the future acknowledges that\nmoving towards the future is going to\nrequire intention and Direction and\neffort and they successfully sort of\nmove towards it and there's this other\ngroup of people who sort of just lives\nlife reactively if something happens to\nthem they can respond to it if there's\nsome sort of external deadline they can\nfind some degree of motivation but they\nusually procrastinate and wait till the\nlast second but they can't seem to find\nthe motivation discipline or willpower\nto actually craft a life with Direction\nhey there thanks for watching and I'm\nglad these videos have been helpful a\nlot of times I'll read the comments and\nsee people asking well what do I\nactually do about it which is such a\ngreat question and unfortunately my\nexperience has been that the resources\nout there aren't actually that good at\nhelping people create sustainable change\nwhich is why I started HG in the first\nplace he coaches are trained on a\ncurriculum that integrates all of my\nunders standing into what is motivation\nwhat paralyzes Us and how to create\nlasting behavioral change so if you're\nready to take the next step he coaches\nare ready to build the life that you\nwant they've helped people build careers\nfind relationships build networks of\nfriends discover what their passions are\nand pursue their Hobbies so if this\nsounds like something that you'd be\ninterested in check out the link in the\ndescription below and it turns out that\nthis is actually a trauma response which\nmay sound kind of surprising because we\ntend to think about okay if I'm living\nmy life on autopilot isn't that an issue\nof like lack of discipline or motivation\nor whatever I'm not a self-starter but\nit actually turns out that due to a lot\nof recent research we've discovered this\nis actually a very common trauma\nresponse in a large portion of the\npopulation\nso the research with this actually\nstarts like maybe in the 60s when there\nwere trauma researchers who discovered\nthat people who experienced trauma have\nthis problem called the paralysis of\ninitiation and so what that sort of\nmeans is they notice that pows prisoners\nof war from places like the Vietnam War\nhad difficulty sort of setting some kind\nof intention or Direction in their life\nand following through with it that these\nprisoners of War essentially lived life\nin sort of a survival or reactive mode\nessentially what they're doing is just\ngoing through life every single day and\nif something happens to them they can\nrespond to it but they can't seem to\nkind of formulate a plan for the future\nand you may be listening to this and\nsort of thinking well okay that makes\nsense for people who are prisoners of\nwar and we'll explain what the principle\nis but as we did more and more research\non trauma we started to discover is up\nto even 50 or 60 percent of the\npopulation has this kind of response and\nwe looked at people like kids who grew\nup even in non-abusive households who\ncan sometimes Manifest this paralysis of\ninitiation so what causes the paralysis\nof initiation it comes down to something\ncalled being raised in an environment of\ncoercive control so if we look at the\nprisoner of war camp what happens there\nthis is a situation in which you have no\ncontrol over your life you wake up every\nday you do what the guards tell you to\ndo you eat what they tell you to eat and\nreally your brain can't plan for the\nfuture because you have no idea are you\ngoing to be here for a day are you going\nto be here for a year are you going to\nbe here for a decade so there's no point\nin thinking about the future if you have\nno control over the future and no agency\nin your life how does that environment\nof coercive control translate to even\nregular kids who are not prisoners of\nWar well it turns out that a lot of us\ngrew up in situations where we also were\nraised in an environment of coercive\ncontrol and so think a little bit about\nyour parents in the environment that you\ngrew up in was this a situation where\nyou could sort of set the direction of\nyour life when you were seven years old\neight years old 10 years old 12 years\nold 15 16 17. could you go to your\nparents and say hey I want to learn how\nto play this instrument or I want to\nstop learning how to play this\ninstrument or did you grow up in an\nenvironment where if you sort of\nexpressed your desires or needs those\nwere constantly overridden there are a\ncouple of other features that we sort of\nsee from Child Development in this kind\nof paralysis of initiation so these were\nalso kids that were not allowed to\nexpress thoughts or emotions so another\nreally interesting diagnostic kind of\ntest that I would do with my patients is\nthat I would ask them when you\nexperienced emotions in your household\nhow were those emotions responded to so\nif you got pissed off were you punished\nfor it if you got scared what are you\npunished for it if you started crying at\nhome did your parents get mad at you for\ncrying and call you ungrateful so if we\nsort of look at these situations what\nwe're starting to realize is that the\nthings that happen within you\nstart to become problematic so let's\nkind of go back to the prisoner of war\nexample for a second so if I get pissed\nat the guards what happens the guards\naren't going to apologize they're going\nto actually punish me for it if I get\npissed at my parents what's going to\nhappen if I start yelling at my parents\nthey're going to punish me for it right\nand so then if you sort of stop and\nthink about it what's happening in your\nbrain what is the lesson that your brain\nlearns your brain learns the lesson that\nexpressing emotions feeling emotions and\neven trying to build some kind of plan\nfor the future is an absolute waste of\ntime at best and it's actually something\nthat hurts and punishes us at worst and\nso literally what happens in these kids\nas well as the pows is our brain starts\nto suppress those thoughts and emotions\nand something really devastating happens\nwhen we start to do this emotional\nsuppression\nso in the mild cases what we sort of\nresult in is thought suppression\nsuppression or emotional suppression\nright because our brain learns hey when\nwe get pissed off it actually damages us\nso we're gonna stop feeling anger we're\ngonna stop feeling fear we're going to\nstop feeling shame and then in the worst\ncase scenarios when we get into really\ntraumatic situations this ends up as\nFrank dissociation so dissociation is\nwhen we completely separate ourselves\nfrom our emotions so even though there\nare negative things happening to us we\ndon't really feel those emotions at all\nbecause the suppression has gotten to\nsuch a high level that we're actually\nmentally checking out completely it\nturns out that there's actually some\nreally fascinating Neuroscience research\nthat explains how suppressing our\nthoughts and emotions literally leads us\nto living a life on autopilot now a lot\nof This research was done by by Van Der\nkolk who did literally brain scans of\npeople who grew up with some kind of\ntraumatic diagnosis and what they\ndiscovered is essentially there's this\ncool neuroscientific phenomenon which is\ndamaging but it's really fascinating\ncalled hemispheric lateralization now\nwhat does that mean so we got to take a\nstep back and understand hemispheric\nlateralization\nso some time ago we sort of came up with\nthis idea that our right brain is\ncreative and emotional and our left\nbrain is sort of analytical planning and\nthis is where language also kind of is\ndominated by the the left hemisphere\nwhat trauma researchers discovered is\nthat this old concept actually turns out\nto be true and that what would happen in\nthese people who did a lot of thought\nsuppression and emotional suppression is\nthey actually had a corpus callosum that\ndid not allow the two parts of their\nbrain to connect the corpus callosum is\nsort of in the middle of our brain that\nconnects our right and left hemisphere\nand so what Van Der kolt discovered is\nthat there's this hemispheric\nlateralization which means I'm going to\nseparate all of my emotional experiences\nand creativity from analysis\norganization planning execution and even\nlanguage and so what they sort of\ndiscovered is that when you dissociate\nwhat happens is you take all these\nfeelings but they don't affect you in\nthe moment so you're able to kind of\nstill go through tasks and kind of like\nalmost live life on autopilot keeping\nall these emotions left to the side and\nnow what we sort of discovered is that\neven kids who were growing up in this\nenvironment of course of control have\nsome degree of this going on\nso when we have this hemispheric\nlateralization and we essentially\nseparate out our emotions from our\nability to plan and execute tasks which\nby the way is absolutely necessary right\nbecause in the traumatic experience we\ncan't afford to have our emotions affect\nour actions we have to be completely\nseparate I can't let my anger result in\nme actually yelling at my parents\nbecause I'm pissed off or blaming them\nor holding them accountable because I'm\ngoing to get punished so in order to\nsurvive our brain decides to do this\nthing where it's like hey we're going to\nseparate these two parts of ourselves\norganization planning and action are\ngoing to be over here and emotions are\ngoing to be over here\nnow in that moment it helps us survive\nin that that kind of environment but it\ncauses us a huge problem long term this\nadaptation which supports our survival\nbecomes a maladaptation as we begin to\ngrow up because it turns out that a lot\nof our ability to initiate tasks and\nsort of plan for the future to live a\nlife with intentionality requires\nintegration across both hemispheres so\nif we look at research on things like\nmeditation what we kind of discover is\nthat when we enter these meditative\nStates we have a lot of synchronicity\nacross both sides of our brain and when\nwe meditate a lot we start to like get\ninto these flow States we start planning\nfor the future we start living our life\nto its fullest and literally this trauma\nresponse does the exact opposite of that\nby separating these two parts of our\nbrain\nand there's actually good clinical\nevidence to support this as well because\none of the things that we've sort of\ndiscovered is that one of the reasons\nPsychotherapy heals trauma is because it\nactually Bridges these two things so\nremember that the right hemisphere is\nwhere we experience emotion and the left\nhemisphere is where where our language\ncomes from and so if you work with\npeople who sort of have this traumatic\nupbringing they have a lot of difficulty\nvocalizing their emotions and so it\nturns out that even in Psychotherapy\nwhen you sit down with someone and you\njust get them to talk about their\nfeelings it turns out that that sort of\nstrengthens the synchronicity across\nboth parts of the brain so what we're\nsort of doing is I've got all these\nemotions over here which normally I\nseparate and without any sort of emotion\nI can't kind of plan or like live life\nto the fullest and even if we sort of\nthink about\num you know like these movies that we\nwatch whether there's a hero or heroine\nwho like digs really deep and like\nconquers all their fears what are they\ndriven by it's usually driven by some\nkind of ocean\nand so what what's sort of happening in\nthese people who are traumatic is that\nthese parts are separated and they can't\nharness that emotion to kind of plan for\nthe future and their left brain is\nactually sort of shut off so one way\nthat we can sort of reinvigorate that\nleft brain is actually through the\nprocess of psychotherapy where we sort\nof get people to articulate their\nemotions and this is what's also really\nconfusing for people because a lot of\npeople will say I don't understand\nhow talking about my feelings is going\nto fix anything right my problems are my\nproblems and talking about my feelings\nis over here but I can't do anything\nabout it right I need to fix the\nproblems and it's that that's precisely\nthe problem is that right now even\nthough you know you have a problem your\nbrain isn't able to actually execute on\nthose tasks and this is what's really\nbizarre is that the way that we're able\nto execute it the way that you can\nalmost turn on your brain to execute on\nthat task is by reducing this\nhemispheric lateralization which can be\ndone through things like talking\nso if you're kind of living your life on\nautopilot there are a couple of things\nthat we can do to help integrate our\nbrain as we've already mentioned even\narticulation of your emotional state\nwill sort of lead to this synchronicity\nand well I know it sounds kind of\nbizarre but we'll get you to actually\nstart doing stuff for the future the\nsecond thing that you can do is stop\nretreating from your emotions so in the\nminds of people who have grown up with\nthis kind of environment of coercive\ncontrol remember that your brain has\nlearned that when I experience negative\nemotions this results in bad things so\nanytime you start to experience negative\nemotions your brain will cope by\nretreating from those emotions or\ndistracting yourself\nand this process needs to be stopped and\nthe tricky thing about this is that if\nyou grew up with a lot of emotional\nsuppression you may not even detect the\nemotion all you're going to experience\nis the retreat Behavior so I don't know\nwhy but today I'm going to get up and\ninstead of doing anything that I'm\nsupposed to be doing I'm just going to\ndistract myself with stuff and if you\nreally pay attention to yourself what\nyou'll discover is that the amount of\ndistraction that you do is not the same\non a day-to-day basis even though your\ncircumstances are broadly the same there\nare certain things that will trigger the\nretreat so you really have to pay\nattention and pay attention to when you\nfeel like retreating when you feel like\nprocrastinating there's one question you\ncan ask yourself which is okay am I\nactually feeling some kind of emotion\nhere is there something going on where\nsomeone has said something or someone\nhas done something or there's a deadline\ncoming up or something is going on that\nis triggering or in a normal person\nwould trigger some kind of anxiety or\nfear or something like that and if the\nanswer to that is yes just stop for a\nsecond and try to pay attention to okay\nwhat am I feeling right now\nyou can take a look at some of these\nvery simple things like your heart rate\num you know your respiratory rate why is\nit that it's so hard for you to be able\nto focus in this moment and this is\nwhere a lot of people slip up because\nthey think that the goal is to force\nthemselves to focus but the goal is not\nto force yourself to focus that's what's\nreally bizarre the goal is simply to\nacknowledge the emotion and to not\nRetreat from it so as we acknowledge the\nemotion and not Retreat from it what\nthat'll sort of do is train our brain to\nokay we no longer need to do thought\nsuppression and emotional suppression\nthese are things that are no longer\ndangerous and will cause us pain and as\nwe take a step forward into that\ndirection and hopefully we can even\narticulate it by journaling or something\nlike that the more integration we're\ngoing to get across our hemispheres and\nthis is what we sort of see clinically\nwith patients with trauma is when you do\nPsychotherapy on trauma and they start\nto articulate all their emotions their\nlife starts to improve even though the\ntherapist is not helping them you know\nget a job or apply for a promotion or\nform relationships or anything like that\nall we're doing is sort of getting the\nbrain to function the way that it's\nsupposed to\nI want to just leave you all with kind\nof one last kind of analogy which is\nthat sometimes in life we sort of feel\nlike we're an NPC we're not living Our\nLives as player characters right so a\nplayer character decides what they're\ngonna do they're going to be pursuing\nmain quests they're going to be going\nhere and going there and there's some\ndegree of advancement but some of us\nfeel like we're NPCs and what we're sort\nof doing is we're just existing in our\nlittle corner of the world and we're not\neven saying anything or doing anything\nuntil someone else comes along and when\nthey interact with us when they right\nclick us that's when we start to go\nthrough this dialogue and we become\nactive and this is exactly what happens\nin this trauma response because you\ncan't live a life with intention you're\nliving life very reactively and it\nrequires external stimuli to motivate\nyou to action\nso if you're someone who's sort of\nliving life as an NPC it may not be due\nto lack of willpower or discipline it\nmay simply be due to this sort of\nstealth and very common trauma response\nthat affects up to 50 of people\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]"
