    "transcript": "[Music]\n[Music]\nalrighty chat let's get started so um\nsorry for the delay we had of course\nsomething go wrong in terms of the\nstream uh give me a second let me\ndisconnect from this and let me\ndisconnect from this I just want to make\nsure we're live everywhere oh the joys\nof updating software okay we're live\nokay cool great great all right so\nwelcome to another healthy gamer GG\nstream my name is Dr Alo kenoi just to\nreminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if yall have a medical concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional also we're going to be\ntalking to Ali doll today who is also a\ndoctor but he's not going to be\ndispensing medical advice I'm pretty\nsure that I can say that on his behalf\num so if yall want medical advice go see\nan actual doctor and have a conversation\nwith them super excited today we are\ngoing to be talking to the one the only\nthe ali abdal um massive productivity\nexpert wrote an awesome awesome awesome\nbook on productivity which is just you\nall should really check it out if you\nhaven't seen it before um really great\nbook and uh we have the opportunity to\ntalk to him and he's he's super cool\ndude super excited I have no idea what\nwe're going to be talking about um so\nwe're just going to actually hop\nstraight into the\ninterview\nokay\num all right let me okay so we're we're\nwe're good to go dude okay can you see\nme okay great now let's make sure that\nthis works yes we can see you\nawesome welcome Ali thanks so much for\nhaving me this is exciting it's kind of\nweird cuz I'm watching the live stream\non here and I'm talking to you on here\nbut I guess there's a little bit of a\ndelay I don't really do this streaming\nstuff very often but very very inspired\nby this so I I I would not watch the\nlive stream if I were you I try not to\nwatch it like sometimes we can interact\nwith chat and stuff but it's going to be\nweird if you're seeing a version of me\nand then a delayed version of me um and\nand we just try to have a\nconversation um but do you want to just\nstart by telling us I I'm sure a lot of\npeople know who you are but uh you want\nto just tell us a little bit about who\nyou are and what you do yeah absolutely\num this almost feels like a trick\nquestion given the conversations we've\nhad in the past but how I might\nintroduce myself is that I'm a doctor\nturned entrepreneur okay so I practice\nmedicine here in the UK for two years\nand then you know accidentally became a\nfull-time YouTuber thanks to the\npandemic and I've been making videos\nhere on YouTube for on YouTube for the\nlast seven years uh mostly themed around\nhelping students get better at their\nexams and stuff and now it's become\nabout productivity so now I make videos\nabout productivity I've got a team got a\nbit of a business around it and I\nrecently wrote a book called Feelgood\nproductivity by the way I've started\nreading yours how to raise a healthy\ngamer it's I'm not a parent yet but it's\nweirdly helpful just in general to\nunderstand like addiction and all this\nsort of stuff and I'm like oh there's so\nmany ideas for things that I can weave\ninto my own content anyway that's that's\nme Dr turn entrepreneur and now author\nand YouTuber about productivity yeah so\nI I've heard like amazing things about\nyour book um like people say it's very\ngood I know it's got like Stellar\nStellar reviews on like book review\nwebsites um yeah it's been going right\nwhat what's what's in the book what's in\nthe book basically it's a practical\nguide on how to be productive in a way\nthat feels good um it's like the whole\nsecret secret to productivity if there\nis one is that if you find a way to\nenjoy your work God forbid then\neverything else takes care of itself you\nbecome more productive you become more\ncreative you become less stressed and\nyou have more energy to give to the\nother important areas of your life and\nso the book is sort of like a practical\nguide on how to actually do that how do\nyou take something that is boring and\nhow do you make it fun using the\nprinciple using evidence-based\nscientific back principles and then\nyou'll find that you'll just be able to\nbe more productive beat procrastination\nand hopefully never burn out that's the\ntheory anyway that yeah so that's\nbecause you know we'll talk in our\ncommunity there was a a concept that\nresonated a lot with people which is\nlike this concept of toxic fuel so if\nyou look at like emotion\nso we experience negative emotions these\nare evolutionary features so even things\nlike shame and fear are actually very\npowerful\nmotivators and often times what will\nhappen is people will like rely on these\nmotivators to achieve things right so I\nhave to like I feel ashamed of myself so\nI'm going to work extra hard and try to\nwin everybody's approval and all this\ngood stuff and then like you end up in\nthis cycle where you have a choice\nbetween feeling good or being productive\nand that's what I think is really cool\nabout your book is like you and we we\ntry to say this over here too that it\ndoesn't have to be like that um and then\nsometimes though we're we're a little\nbit short on practical tips of how to\nimplement so I I you know I think it's\nreally cool that your book has all that\nstuff so it's very practical and you're\nalso doctor no\nexactly so that's cool um so anything in\nparticular you want to talk about today\nor anything um come to mind good\nquestion\nwell comes to\nmind and I\nguess just while you're so I I also just\nwanted to let people know that Ali and I\nmet uh maybe about a year ago and we\nlike hung out a fair amount like at a\nconference so so that's we we sort of\nknow each other a little bit just so\npeople are aware of that nice um yeah so\nI\nthink one thing I always like to hear\nyou because I've i' I've seen a couple\nof your streams the one with Pokey man\nthe one with lwig um a couple of others\nover the years it's always interesting\nhearing the relationship between the\nCreator and their like creative output\nand you and I have sort of talked about\nthis in the past uh briefly around sort\nof as a fairly big Creator the uh\ncompulsion to post stuff um the sort of\nNeed for social status and approval from\nthe audience um things\nlike oh one thing that would be\ninteresting to explore um is you\nknow my relationship with negative\nreviews okay because I really started to\nfeel that more so as the books come out\num there was there was advice I heard\nfrom other authors which is that you\nshould never look at your own book\nreviews because if they're positive then\nlike whatev but in particular because\nthe negative ones can really affect you\nand I haven't really tried to look at\nnegative book reviews but I'm sure if\nand when I do it'll bring up some\ninteresting feelings that might reveal\nwhere I'm not truly free or things like\nthat so yeah yeah data seeking approval\nseeking where does money fit into this\nwhole equation um how do I think about\nmy identity I guess it's now no longer\ndoctor it's now this sort of YouTuber\nguy who does productivity type stuff is\nthat the identity I'm G to have forever\nwhat about if I want to have a family\nand stuff what's going to be my\nrelationship with work as it relates to\nlife work life balance I'm just throwing\na lot of stuff at you I'm sure you're\nyou'll we'll find a way to talk about\nyeah no I mean I I think my my first\nreaction to this is I I miss talking to\nyou because you're so you know I think\nyou're you're very engaged you're very\ncurious um you're not you're willing to\nlook at parts of yourself that may not\nbe\nideal um how do you feel about not\nlooking at your negative reviews how do\nI feel about it\num how do I feel about anything is is a\nbit of a hard question to to figure out\nbecause I very rarely know how how I\nfeel about things um\nhow do I feel about not looking at my\nnegative reviews okay I just sort of I\nfeel like I just sort of took that\nadvice from that someone else I can't\nremember who it was but I I think I\nprobably read it online or heard it in a\npodcast and just sort of latched onto it\nin a sense of like Oh yay that means I\ncan just focus on doing the work and\nputting it out there and in a very stmy\nway it is completely outside of my\ncontrol how other people perceive that\nthing but I don't know like there's like\nthis website that that this uh celebrity\ngossip Forum that also has like mean\nthings about me\nwhere I made the mistake of looking at\nit once or twice over the last few years\nand I always found that it sort of\nbrought up lots of feelings that I\ndidn't particularly want to confront and\njust sort of generally made me feel bad\nokay um and\nso having spoken to a lot of other\npeople who get online criticism they've\nall basically said yeah just don't look\nat it and so I'm like okay fair enough\nbut it's something that would be\ninteresting to explore what's what's\nyour take on it um so I think uh\nI'm going to answer your question then\nI'm going to ask you one if that's okay\nso I I think uh you have to be super\ncareful about online criticism for a\ncouple of reasons the first is that\npeople who are critical of you online\nare rarely fair so we also have content\ncreators whose content is to be critical\nof other people right so in the worst\ncases this is like hate farming but\nfrequently when you get you know when\nyou get an even someone who has an\narticle like someone on on a newspaper\nlike they have a vested interest\nto attract eyes right so the way that\nthey tell the story is like very very\nshaped so I I I think a lot of times you\nknow you'll also see things like people\nwill say like we invited this person to\ncomment like the reason that a lot of\npeople don't comment is because it's a\nlose lose situation I think a lot of\npeople uh don't really understand like\nsometimes it's useful to comment I'm not\nsaying one way or the other but I think\nthat so that's that's something you just\nhave to know going in right this person\nis usually not interested in giving you\na fair\nShake um and that's okay so just because\nthey're not giving you a fair Shake\ndoesn't mean that they don't have\ncriticism that is\nworthwhile right so that's the other\nthing is that just because they're not\nfair doesn't mean that they're wrong so\nthat's something that sometimes people\nwill do they'll say like oh like this is\nunfair this is crazy there but I mean if\nif people are writing things I think\nit's sometimes worthwhile to look at\ncriticism um I I\nthink so that that's kind of like the\nthe the start off of it right and and I\nI find that when I look at online\ncriticism and we'll get to this in a\nsecond or maybe down the road but I\noften times find myself responding in my\nhead adding context and things like that\nlike if that kind of makes sense right\nand this isn't just us looking at online\ncriticism this is like even in real life\nif you're just not a content creator and\nsomeone criticizes you or sends you some\nsuper long text you're going to be\nthinking about the context that they're\nignoring so I think that that's kind of\nlike I think you should be careful with\nit um it can be useful to look at I\nthink it's really important to think\nabout what are\nthe goals of the person who is doing the\ncriticism uh I think there's also a\ncouple of like really important Concepts\nthat we can learn to better tolerate\ncriticism the first is the removal of\nthe ego so when I look at criticism the\nmore ego I have the harder it is to\nhandle and the less I learn from it but\neven from an egoless State it's pretty\neasy to actually tell that this is not a\nfair shake and then you can actually\ndismiss it more easily so you can like\nlook at something right and you can\nrecognize that this person\num you know th this person is injecting\ntheir or they're projecting their view\nof you into like their criticism so\npeople will make a lot of assumptions\nabout what you do or what you don't do\num and so like the more that you're able\nto kind of be egoless I think the better\nit is to handle I I think in general\nit's really good\nto uh look at I mean to to receive\ncriticism but I think the other thing to\nconsider especially as you become a\ncontent creator is that the bigger you\ngrow you can't make everybody happy\nhappy and so the large and we've seen\nthis ourselves like you know the bigger\nyou grow the more the more just\nstatistically you're going to get like\nyou know let's say 1% of the people who\nwatch your content are really not going\nto be happy with you and the only\ndifference is that if you have you know\n5 million subscribers versus 1 million\nsubscribers versus 100,000 subscribers\nthe total number of people changes and\nthe interesting thing about the internet\nis you really only need a vocal minority\nso if you're sitting at like 5 million\nsubs and 1% of people don't like you\nthat's 50,000 people and 50,000 people\nwho don't like you can generate a lot of\nnegativity like on the internet so\nthere's also some interesting biases at\nplay so our brain we're biased towards\nnegative information even the way that\nyou're talking about things and now\nwe're going to get to my question um the\nway that you're talking about things\nmakes me think that you probably have\nthat bias despite the fact that you're\nreally positive and stuff like that\nright so you use the word latch onto\nlike there's a part of you that latched\nonto this advice and even that language\npresumes that you're kind of floating\naround in the ocean like looking for\nsomething to grab\nonto you know so so it it doesn't that\nthat implies some emotion like like you\nwere looking for something that is an\nexcuse to not look at this stuff because\nmaybe you're afraid of looking at it\nyeah yeah hence why I used the word lat\nonto because I'm pretty sure that that's\nwhat was going on yeah so so what do you\nthink is going on I guess that was not\nreally a question but yeah what do I\nthink is going on I think um putting\nsomething like a book out there into the\nworld through throughout the whole\nprocess I felt a lot of imposter\nsyndrome I felt a lot of you know what\nyou know who who am I to be writing a\nbook about\nproductivity and the fact that it was a\nbook um with like a legit publisher and\nit's like in bookstores and it's on\nAmazon and stuff and I I I sort of built\nup the gravitas of a book with the sort\nof capital B in my mind such that\ncriticism about the book\nfeels I I suspect would feel feels more\nbad than criticism about a YouTube video\nIf only because of the fact that I took\nthree and a half years to write to write\nthe book and um you know take under\nthree and a half days to create a\nYouTube video and so I poured a lot of\nmy myself I want to say a a lot of\nmyself a lot of work into the process of\nwriting the book and so I worry I so\nsort of I think I want to sort of ego\nprotect it more so than I would for like\na YouTube video or a random blog post or\nsomething like that that takes a lot\nless work okay so you're saying that the\namount of work that you put in is what\nmakes the book feel different it's the\namount of work I think it's also the\num I'd probably say this sort of a book\nhas some level of real world Prestige\nand or credibility compared to YouTube\nvideos for example and so it's almost\nlike I've got the audacity to sort of\nstick my neck out there and actually put\nmy name to a book um which also makes it\nfeel\nmore heavy than for example a YouTube\nvideo or an Instagram post or something\nlike that who are you to write a book\nthat's a question isn't it am I to write\na\nbook what happens when I\nsorry H how do you what what happens\nwhen I ask that\nquestion\nH when you asked that question there\nis a part of me\nthat\nthinks I could make a case for why I am\na I am a good a reasonable person to\nwrite this sort of book there's another\npart of me that's like yeah but I don't\nwant to make that case because then it\nsort of comes across as I'm like\ndefending myself or\nsomething um and then and then there's\nanother part by the way oh nice and then\nthere's another part of me that's like\ndamn who am I to write a\nbook and so that's why when you asked\nthe question I was I sort of felt a bit\nlike there's like these different\nyeah yeah it's sort of like uh the\ndialogue choices in a in a game there's\nlike these different options it's like\nwhich one do we go with yeah right so so\nI think uh really insightful that you\nnotice that even if we say make a\ncase that language speaks to\ndefensiveness right so you you notice\nthat yeah right and and so you you can\nmake a case but you only need to make a\ncase\nlike if there isn't a presumption of\nlike innocence you know what I mean like\nlike so now let's ask a different\nquestion who are you to make a YouTube\nvideo I'm a random guy who chooses to\nmake YouTube videos right so like and\nand so that's not a hard answer that's\nnot a hard answer yeah and I don't feel\nany defensiveness or like well actually\ndid you know I went to medical school\n[ __ ] you or whatever right so that's\nlike so interesting right so so so\nwhat's the difference between those two\nthings\nI don't know what is the difference\nbetween those two things um a book is\nsomething that has more feels more legit\nokay about it feels legit compared to a\nYouTube video what's more legit about a\nbook what's more legit about a\nbook the fact that it is a\nokay what's more legit about a book If I\nWas self-publishing an ebook I wouldn't\nI wouldn't I don't think I'd feel any\ndefensiveness about that interesting\nright so it's not the product it's not\nthe product it's traditional publishing\nand physical book like the act of\nputting something to paper and then it\nbeing in bookstores with a legit\npublisher behind it I think it's like\nthose things that make it feel more\nlegit feel feel like it what what what\ndo you mean by\nlegit do I mean by legit I don't know\nlike it has some sense\nof I want I want to say sort of like\nreal world credibility okay where it's\nsort of it's a thing that's not on the\ninternet whereas the Internet isn't\nquite like it doesn't feel like it's the\nreal world it feels like oh anyone can\njust put stuff out on the internet and\nit's like great you know Open Season all\nthis sort of stuff but something about\ncreating an creating a physical object\nin the real world where people have the\noption of buying that\nthing that feels different to creating a\nYouTube video where people have the\noption to watch their thing what kind of\npeople write\nbooks people\nwho people who have useful things to say\npeople who maybe who are maybe experts\npeople who have some sort of credibility\nto be able to write the\nbook are are you a expert do you have\ncredibility I mean it says on the book\nyou know the world's most followed\nproductivity expert but I I I felt kind\nof weird about that when when the\npublisher suggested that as like a thing\nbecause yeah I mean what even is an\nexpert I I I I sort of flip-flop around\nthese around this stuff some of the time\num where there there are times where I\nlean into it be like yeah I am a\nproductivity expert like what is an\nexpert someone who's studied and feels\nlike they have useful things to to share\nand the fact that people find my stuff\nuseful blah blah blah blah blah blah\nsure I can lean into the idea of being\nan expert\num if I did I don't know a PhD in\norganizational psychology with an\ninteresting productivity then maybe I\nmight consider myself more of an expert\num yeah how do you feel about not\npracticing medicine\nanymore how do I feel about not\npracticing medicine anymore broadly very\ngood CU I much prefer my life now than I\ndid when I was practicing medicine yeah\nNHS is a brutal place man\nyep um you said broadly good what what\nabout\nanything that doesn't feel good about it\nI I'm sure you know we're not I'm just\nkind of curious if this resonates or not\nyeah there's a residual part of me that\nstill sort of feels feels bad about it\num because there is a residual part of\nme\nthat thinks\nthat back when I was a doctor working\nfull-time and also doing stuff on the\nside that gave me the quote credibility\nto then be able to speak about\nproductivity but now I'm not I don't\nhave a real job I am quote just an\nentrepreneur where I can basically do\nwhatever I want and stuff and so\nit me then giving advice about\nproductivity sort of touches on an old\ninsecurity that I had which is what kept\nme in medicine for like a year longer\nthan I probably should have been which\nwas\nthat unless I'm a practicing doctor my\nwork has no value or has a lot less\nvalue like if I'm trying to help people\nbe more productive or whatever yeah so\nthat's interesting right so use\ncredibility use legit you talk\nabout so tell tell me about that what\nwhat made you feel like being cred like\nyou know like you're real job Ali's\ndoctor no so like like you know it feels\nlike a real job and and what does that\nkind of make sense is that am I kind of\nbouncing back what you're telling me\nabout this\ninsecurity yeah it feels like a real job\nand it feels like a job that is famously\ndemanding and therefore the fact that I\ncan build a business while being a\ndoctor full-time is impressive but the\nfact that I can just build a business is\nlike it's not that impressive because\nloads of people are doing it kind of\nthing and so\nlike you\nknow\nwhat the old the old insecurity is like\nwhat value does my productivity advice\nhave if I actually have full control\nover my schedule because not many people\ndo and like am I just the guy whose job\nit is to make videos about\nproductivity and the way that he talks\nabout productivity is all about like how\nhe makes videos about productivity more\nproductively and and you get this weird\nkind of circular circular Loop thing\nyeah\num it's not it's not something that\nremotely keeps me up at night but there\nis a kernel of that fear still there\nwhen you ask that question of like how\ndid it feel to as a feel to not practice\nmedicine are you impressive\num depends on who's asking but probably\nfor most people who might ask that\nquestion what what do you think about\nyou oh I think I'm impressive yeah okay\nand and do are you how do you is it okay\nto be impressive yeah okay does it make\nyou uncomfortable to be oppressive\nimpressive no not really uh it feels a\nlittle uncomfortable to say that out\nloud because it sounds bigheaded yeah um\nbut it is what it is okay I I agree I\nthink you're very impressive I also\nthink you're a random guy right so I\nthink there's there's a couple of things\ngoing on here um\nyeah do you want more questions or do\nyou want\nlike\nhypothesis um hypothesis would be good\nat this point although happy happy to\nanswer questions yeah so so like I I\nthink like a couple of things to keep in\nmind the first is that if we listen to\nyou what we see is that there's an old\nversion of you who had certain trials\nand\ntribulations right you like um and I I I\ndon't know if people kind of know your\nyour background but you were very\nsuccessful in medical school you went to\nOxford right you worked at the NHS um so\nyou were like at the top of your game\nyou were objectively very impressive\nyeah I went to Cambridge rather than\nOxford for the record because Cambridge\nis obviously the better one there's all\nthis rivalry between the two my\nbad um so so you you were you were kind\nof very successful and you went to\nmedicine and and you kind of felt like\nyou had like medicine was legit it's\ncredible it has gravitas it has physical\nsubstance you're like saving lives\nyou're doing real work you know it's\nit's not just making [ __ ] on the\ninternet yeah it's not screwing around\non a live stream and calling it work\nyeah absolutely right so so so and and\nso you have this\nconception and you also have this like\ndesire to be\nsomething right like so so if you kind\nof think about it when we have an\ninsecurity about\nourselves one of the worst things that\nwe can do is to do something to fix the\ninsecurity oh\ninteresting right why is that one the\nworst thing we can we can do a lot of\nhuman behavior motivated by the desire\nto fix an insecurity yeah absolutely and\nand it it explains why people are\nsuccessful and\nunhappy um so so if we like I know it\nsounds kind of weird but like I'll give\nyou a a more extreme example and then we\ncan kind of like move back towards the\ncenter but let's say like someone has\nbody dysmorphia so I'm insecure about my\nappearance so I'm going to get a little\nbit of surgery and then I'm still\ninsecure about my appearance so I'm\ngoing to get a little bit of surgery\nright so so a lot of times when we are\nlet's say I'm insecure so that's like an\nextreme example where there's\npotentially a clinical pathology but\nlet's say a more reasonable example\nlet's say I'm insecure about about my\nworth as a as a human so like I'm I'm a\nloser so I'm going to become a winner so\nI'm going to make a lot of money I'm\ngoing to get a fancy job and then I feel\ngood about myself right cuz I was a\nloser who made no money and now I make a\nton of money and now I feel really good\nabout myself but if you really pause and\nthink about it you haven't really fixed\nthe insecurity you've actually fed it\nbecause if you lose your job if you lose\nthe money you go back to square one so\nyou're of selfworth the insecurity is\nstill there it's just been masked by\ncircumstances okay so another simple\nexample I'm insecure about my body so\nI'm going to leave my shirt on when I go\nto the beach I haven't solved the\ninsecurity I've just changed the\ncircumstances to make my insecurity\nhidden and\ndormant and then what happens is so so\nthat like like that's like the first\nthing right so you you you overachieved\nand you end end up being good doctor and\nall this good stuff right and then you\nrecognize now like you're okay with\nleaving it fair enough and there's some\nweird there's some weirdness going on\nhere but um and I know that doesn't mean\nmuch right now but but then I I think\nwhen we talk about like sort of writing\na book like it's almost like you've\ncrafted a life for yourself that you\nyourself are happy with but there is an\nolder version of you that looks at this\nguy and was like this is not who we set\nout to be\nright we set out to be credible and now\nyou you gave up the path of credibility\nyou stopped being a doctor now you're\ntrying to do credible things\nFaker right so like if you were a doctor\nworking for the NHS like you could write\na book yeah absolutely absolutely right\nand then and then even when you look at\nsome of these things which you know\nobjectively or true and you feel good\nwith in some ways cuz they you're like\nthat job sucked like sometimes like\nmedicine is like a wonderful profession\nin a lot of ways but sometimes it sucks\nlike the the the act of doing it which\nthen also by the way feeds our\nego because now I'm\nsacrificing now I'm not taking the easy\nRoad right there's there's a ego\ngratifying sense of like\nmartyrdom so it makes you legit right if\nyou really stop and think about it like\nwhat's more impressive working 5 hours a\nweek and making a million dollars or\nworking 50 hours a week and making a\nmillion\ndollars but if we if we're not careful\nthis is the ego and this is how the ego\nmanifests it has this idea of who you\nshould be and that idea is born of a\nparticular insecurity so that idea is\nborn of I don't believe that I am this\nthing and and so this manifests in a\ncouple of different ways when you look\nat world's number one productivity\nexpert or whatever right like you\nacknowledge that on an analytics\nperspective Ive or whatever like that's\ntrue it's still kind of cringe cuz it's\nsort of egotistical but but you know\nPublishers need to sell books yeah sure\nright so you're kind of like okay but\nlike I I think it's like this thing and\nthat's also why you kind of latch on to\nit because I think that that insecurity\nis still\nthere and so now what happens is like\nyou're afraid that you're not\ncredible and then now if you go read\nsomething on the Internet and what if\nthey say who the [ __ ] is this guy to be\nwriting book like oh it's going to be\nlike a sniper yeah\nexactly oh one of these one of these\nhappened the other day um I gave a talk\nat Google and they put it up on their\ntalks at Google YouTube channel that has\nlike whatever five million subscribers\nor something and I remember seeing the\nnotification pop up and I clicked on the\nvideo and the very first comment was\nsomething to the effect of you know I\nremember back in the day when talks at\nGoogle would bring in academics and\nexperts now all they do is bring in\ncelebrities and influencers God this\nchannel has gone to the dogs or\nsomething to that effect and I was like\noh damn this guy's right I have no\ncredibility because that was my fear\nabout doing this talk at Google and\nespecially the fact that it was going to\nbe published online I was like you know\nfreaking Nobel Prize winners have done\ntalks at Google and now this freaking\nYouTuber guy is also sharing sharing the\nproverbial stage with those legit people\nand so that kind of was something that\nwas like oh hello there's something\nthere like yeah right so so it's like\nit's interesting because if if we look\nat the availability so we can make\npredictions about what kinds of comments\nwill be hurtful for for you and then\nwhen we share that prediction you're\nlike yes right so so now it's like we\nhave a hypothesis and we have data now\nthis is important to understand just\nbecause it's hurtful doesn't mean it's\ntrue and we're going to talk a little\nbit about how to overcome that right so\nso and this kind of goes back to this\nidea that like you've developed\ncredibility not in here you've developed\ncredibility by giving yourself trappings\nlike I'm a doctor working in the NHS and\nthe moment that you lose that the fear\nof The credibility the gravitas the\nlegitimacy and then the really confusing\nthing is that you actually don't need it\nright cuz you're comfortable being a\nrandom guy making videos on the internet\nlike that's okay like you're happy with\nthat like that's fun yeah right and I\nthink you can also I I imagine or I\nguess we can find out like do you think\nyour videos are helpful to people yeah\ndo you think your book is helpful to\npeople\nyes is there a difference between the\ntwo not really yeah the videos are\nhelpful to some people the book's\nhelpful to some\npeople right so so then then the\nquestion kind of becomes like I don't\nknow if this kind of makes sense but now\nwe see that this is not you are not one\nthing these are\nstates so there are times where like\nwhen when I you know after you watch\nthat after you read that comment of like\nGoogle used to invite real people you\nknow now they just invite celebrities um\nif I were to ask you like you know does\nyour book help people like do you think\nyour answer would be\ndifferent no it's still it still helps\npeople yeah okay that's that's that's\ngood so so I I think that this is like\nimportant to understand that who like\nyou know the the ego vulnerability or\nthe insecurity of the lack of legitimacy\nis still there m yeah and it's\ninteresting because how did how did you\nnot how do you not feel illegitimate\nmaking videos on the\ninternet like do you have a sense of\nlike how you feel different because\nyou're like I'm just a random guy so\nlike why is that okay is that kind of\nmake sense like you don't you don't say\nyou're a someone yeah you don't say\nyou're a no one you actually say like\nI'm a random guy yeah I'm just a dude\nmaking videos on the internet um\nthe the reason that feels totally fine\nto say and I feel very comfortable in\nthat identity of random dude making\nvideos on the Internet is because any\nanyone can make videos on the internet\nand if they are useful and people watch\nthem then that person gets views on\ntheir videos and can make a cur out of\nit if they're not useful and people\ndon't watch them then the opposite is\ntrue so in my case yeah a random I'm a\nrandom guy making videos on the internet\npeople seem to find them helpful people\nseem to keep watching 7 years down the\nline so it's like cool I'll keep making\nI I'll keep being this random guy making\nvideos on the internet as long as it's\nfun and helpful and at least profitable\nand a random guy can't write a\nbook honestly a random guy can write a\nbook as\nwell yeah I'm just a random dude who\nwrote a\nbook and people can buy it if they want\nand of the people that buy it if they\nread it they might get some value out of\nit I hope they get some value out of\nit yeah thinking of myself as a random\ndude who wrote who who wrote a book and\nwants to write more feels very very\ncomfortable thinking of myself as like o\nthis doctor turned productivity expert\nwho has written a book feels more more\nuncomfortable yeah right yeah just\nrandom dude like that's what you\nare yeah like you happen to be maybe a\ndoctor in a productivity but honestly\nlike you're just a\ndude yeah I'm a dude who just decided to\nyou you piss at [ __ ] just like the rest\nof us man\nand I think I think this is this is the\ncrazy thing right so this is like where\nthe way that we view ourselves and and I\nthink this is like what I see is a lot\nof conditioning here that you've\nactually discovered who you are and\nwe'll get to Identity and and things\nlike that but like you know you you kind\nof discovered who you are who are you by\nthe\nway I am me a random dude on the\ninternet right right so so like and it's\ncool because if you're a random dude on\nthe internet there's like what are the\nwhat are the\nexpectations oh yeah none there's no\nexpectations right so you know you don't\nhave to live up to some hypothetical\nidea of credibility you get to be\nyou right and and then if you really\nlook at it like a lot of the challenges\nthat people face are when they construct\nidentities for themselves or or even\nthey yeah they construct identities for\nthemselves or they construct identities\nto strive\nto yep and and this is the problem with\nlike the whole insecurity thing and body\ndysmorphia when you strive to be\nsuccessful that can't exist unless you\nhave a view of yourself that is\nunsuccessful right so like in order to\ngo there I have to start\nhere and\nthen and so the the weird thing though\nis that we assume that the mechanism of\naction of the change in s is the\naccomplishment of a goal so we think\nlike I'm a loser once I win then I will\nbe a\nwinner um and then we think once I'm a\nwinner I will no longer feel like a\nloser but if you really look at it I I\nthink I don't know if there's like\nstraight studies about this there have\nto be this is more of a clinical\nperspective but if you really look at\ndissolution of the identity of loser it\ndoesn't come from\nwinning oh what does it come from so\nactually winning can reinforce the\nidentity of a loser it can lead to\nimposter syndrome so when you have\npeople who are insecure who accomplish\nthings they don't develop\nconfidence they the insecurity becomes\ndormant or hidden and then they're\nafraid that people are going to find out\nthat I don't I'm not actually legit oh\nmy God I'm giving a talk at Google and\nlike what if I open my mouth and and you\nknow gamer slurs come out and then\nthey're going to realize that it's all\nfake and this one guy noticed he noticed\nhe saw he was like oh my God this person\nisn't an academic oh my God so it's just\nthere yeah so the interesting thing is\nif you look at what what really like\nlet's say like someone who goes to the\nyou know I have patients who have\nstarted to work out and when they go to\nthe gym it's not getting into shape that\nactually gives them confidence it is\ngoing into the gym and recognizing that\nit's okay to be out of\nshape right so it's like it's like the\nthe Turning moment so I I had one\npatient who went to the gym and didn't\nknow how to use certain equipment and so\nsomeone who\nwas basically looked like a bodybuilder\nlike walked over to them one day and was\nlike Hey I'm going to do a set Can you\nspot\nme and so they asked this person who was\nobese for help and then they like\nspotted them and I don't think they\nneeded much help and then they're they\nwere like hey do you want to do a set\nyou know and he's like I I don't know\nhow to do this and he's like okay like\ndo you want to learn and then like there\nwas like a very like and in that moment\nlike that's what\nit wasn't I've\ngotten it wasn't like I've become I've\ngotten into shape it's like it's okay to\nbe this way and I'm\nprogressing so this is this is also like\nsomething important to understand when\nwe accomplish a goal we're like the goal\nis over there and we're over here but\nreally being okay with who you are\nyou're a random guy like what are you\ngoing to do in the next year I'm sure\nyou have some plans but you're not going\nto stop you're going to still be a\nrandom guy you may have maybe a million\nmore YouTube subscribers or maybe you\nwrite a second book but you're still\ngoing to be a random guy the Unice\ndoesn't change does that see does that\nmake sense yeah and even if we\nrecalibrate the book you're just a\nrandom guy who who wrote a book you\nhappen to have a following so you\nconvince these Publishers to publish a\nbook that was written by a random\nguy right yeah yeah exactly you tricked\nthem fair\nenough fair enough right and and so so\nthe more you kind of and this is where\nwe get to this like idea of acceptance\nbut acceptance is very confusing for a\nlot of people because they're like wait\nI don't want to be this but that's the\nwhole point is like you have to\naccept um and then things can get better\nand then there's also like research that\nshows that confidence doesn't come from\nsuccess it comes from surviving\nfailure so and even in those moments\nwhen you're working out it's like going\nthere and accepting that you're not in\nshape is what leads to\nconfidence does that make sense\nquestions yeah no that makes sense yeah\nyeah I just wrote down on my little\nlittle thing because you know I like to\nwrite things down I'm a random dude on\nthe internet this is going to be my I I\nfeel\nlike this is\nalmost this is almost better than a\npositive affirmation a positive\naffirmation on the surface would be I'm\na I'm I'm impressive I'm a legend you\nknow blah blah blah blah blah blah but\nactually me just reading this I'm a\nrandom dude on the internet\nlike just sort of really feels like it's\nt it takes the pressure off it's like\nwant to make YouTube videos yeah I'm a\nrandom dude on the internet cool someone\nasked me a question I'm going to make a\nvideo about it and hit publish on\nYouTube I'm a random dude on the\ninternet gonna write a book cool I'm a\nrandom dude on the internet I'm G to\nrelease an online product because why\nnot I'm G to build an app because why\nnot I'm a random dude on the internet\nfeel so empowering to be just a random\ndude on the internet so what does it\nfree you\nfrom H expectation pressure um having to\nuh live up to a particular kind of\nidentity and it gives me permission to\njust uh en enjoy the journey and try and\nbe as helpful as I can be yeah right so\nso I I I think that that's like that's a\nbeautiful reframe and I'm with you like\nI don't I don't like positive I mean I\nthink there's certain cases where\npositive affirmations are good but I\noften times uh find that positive\naffirmations are just reinforcing our\nown like delusional belief belie about\nour they're like I'm going to try to\nconvince\nmyself by repeating this to my conscious\nmind and that doesn't work because I I\ndon't know if you kind of if you go back\nand you watch this I think even people\nwho were watching will see when you\nchange right so like we talked a little\nbit about like when we talk about the\ninsecurity we can see the change in your\nand it's lovely how how emotive you are\nlike we we can see like you're like you\nkind of clam up and it it hurts a little\nbit and then like the liberation of like\noh like I'm just I'm just a dude who\nwrote a book and it so happens that in\nin the circumstance of the world like\nthis is what people are looking for now\nwhich is fine right it's not that I am\nsomething or I am you know all those\nideas expectations that's not really who\nyou are and this is where we kind of\nlike talk think a little bit about ego\nwhich is like ego is a\nconstruction it's an abstraction right\nit's not a thing thing it's like an\nidentity a winner or a loser you can't\nbiopsy a winner you can't biopsy a loser\nyou can't x-ray it you're not going to\nfind success on an X-ray or even in your\nbrain right these are all conceptions\nand so freeing oursel from our\nconception allows us to I'm I'm sure\nthis is in some vein and feel good\nproductivity it's got to be um you know\nthat when you free yourself of your\nconception allows you to hey I'm going\nto make an app because why not and does\nit need to be successful Elite\nno are you going to try to make it\nsuccessful yeah sure right right and and\nand and I I think like sure is such a\ngreat\nword why\nnot doesn't need to be GNA do something\nto pass the time yeah and you know even\nfor me like I use sure a lot and it's\nsome sometimes confusing for people\nbecause people will ask me like are you\na doctor and I'm like\nsure it's like how do you define it like\ndo I practice medicine for a few hours a\nweek sure but am I a doctor I don't know\nI have a medical degree I know some\nstuff about Medicine sure why not\nyeah um okay I I have a question on this\nyeah\num\nhow how would I how should I well with\nall the caveats of the word should aside\nhow should I think of my Instagram bio\nfor example like my internal identity\ncan be I'm a random dude on the internet\nbut I sort of feel like you know the\nfront page of my website or the freaking\nInstagram buy or whatever it's like hey\nI'm Ali I'm a doctor to an entrepreneur\nYouTuber podcaster author of The New\nYork Times bestselling book blah blah\nblah all all of those things do you have\nlike\nuh I guess something that comes to mind\nI I was recently reading spiritual\nenlightenment by Jed McKenna I don't\nknow if you've read that it's really\ngood I think you'd enjoy it um but he's\nsort of like\num once once you become enlightened you\nwear your ego as if it's just like uh a\nset of clothes you walk back into it\nbecause it's it's helpful in some ways\nto navigate the world yeah but you keep\nin mind that it's it's just a set of\nclothes that I can walk out of whenever\nI want and so I was sort of this set of\nclothes metaphor came to mind when it\ncame to I'm Ali abdal the doct to\nentrepreneur blah blah blah blah blah\nblah all that BS it's just a change of\nclothes it's just the thing that makes\nsense to have on an Instagram\nbio yeah so I I I would agree with that\nso let's like understand what the ego is\nand like even to a certain degree like\nthere's 's\nactually I recently put together a\nparadigm for like the Neuroscience of\nEnlightenment so there're actually like\na couple of\ndiscreet so we have we have some really\ninteresting studies from like brain\nscans and um neuronal activity and even\nchanges and things like trauma and stuff\nlike that to where I think we've sort of\nfigured out actually like\nneuroscientifically I mean I don't know\nwe figured out I think if you understand\nthe concept and you understand the\nNeuroscience you can try to hypothesize\nhow to fit these two things together\nand I think this is a really good\nexample so here's the first thing if you\nwant to be free of all the stuff we can\nthat's what we're going to talk about so\nhow and in the how I think we'll\nunderstand what what the deal is so the\nfirst thing to understand is like if you\nclose your eyes right now close your\neyes what do you\nfeel feel the desk in front of me I feel\nmy feet on the\ncarpet okay right so this this is your\nmoment of existence like you you have\nsome thoughts maybe you notice the\nthoughts you have some physical\nSensations right so like if all of your\nexperience of life was this moment would\nyou have a chronological\nage\nNo like is it Monday or Tuesday\ntoday right so like so so now open your\neyes for a second so here's the crazy\nthing is that if you really pay\nattention to your life all your life is\nis those moments strung together in any\nparticular moment in life you do not\nhave an identity you just have an\nexperience of\nyourself the identity is an abstraction\nthat gets stitched together yep okay\nwhich is why the identity can change\nlike your experience that what what you\nexperience can change but the fact that\nyou experience cannot change sure so if\nwe look at an Instagram bio it's a tool\nwhat's the purpose of an Instagram bio\nit is to offer people on Instagram a\nperception of who you are should you\ninflate it to a reasonable to the\nappropriate amount absolutely because\nit's an Instagram bio Instagram bios\nwere not the major tool that yogis in\nthe Himalayas used to attain\nEnlightenment that's not what they used\nto discover themselves it's an Instagram\nbio is used to sell [ __ ] yeah pretty\nmuch right and and so so this is like\nit's a trapping that you wear and you\nshould craft it you should play the game\nthat the game is played that's what I\nthink so I think that you should be and\nsome people will say like oh like the\nInstagram bio is like egotistical so you\nshouldn't do it no that's actually\negotistical because now who am I I am\nabove this Instagram bio these noobs who\nmake Instagram bios I am better than\nthat I'm superior I'm more egist than\nall of these idiots\nwho are so vapid and require Instagram\nbios look at those losers I'm better\nthan\nthat that's\nego two kinds of ego in the world\nregular ego and the ego of having no\nego okay so the Instagram bio is just a\ntrapping now the basic problem that we\nthe basic problem everyone gets into is\nthat we confuse our experience of\nourselves with like who who we are so we\nwe attach the Val we attach our value to\na particular trapping we connect these\ntwo but who you are to the outside world\nis not who you are to yourself and as\nlong as these things are disconnected\nyou can do whatever you you know I mean\nthat that's I so I I agree with this\nperson there's even studies on on things\nlike psychedelics and the default mode\nNetwork and stuff like that where we\nknow that\ndeactivation of our the part of our\nbrain that has a sense of our identity\ncorrelates with mental health\nImprovement so if you look at someone\nwho's depressed they are very their\ndefault mode Network which is our where\nwe get our sense of our identity is\nhyperactive they're thinking about me\nI'm a loser I'm this I'm this I'm this\nI'm this this person would be better off\nwithout me the world would be better off\nwithout me I you know they're always\nthinking negatively about themselves so\nyou you literally the the fastest\ntreatment for depression is ketamine\nwhich is a dissociative agent we\nliterally unplug them from their sense\nof self and then the depression improves\nrapidly so meditation also decreases the\nactivity of the default mode\nNetwork when you meditate for a long\ntime it becomes more like\ninactive psychedelics can sometimes lead\nto these things called ego death or you\ncan have transcendental experiences in\nmeditation where you have ego death ego\ndeath is very liberating because you\nrealize you're not actually any of that\n[ __ ] that you think you are you're just\nyou you're random guy yeah right I too\nam just a random guy and everyone will\nsay and we we'll use the trappings of\nour life because the trappings of our\nlife are necessary to communicate to\nother people you want to write a book so\nyou can put number one product sure you\ncan put it on there right will it sell\nmore books yeah we're trying to sell\nbooks why are we trying to sell books\nare you trying to make money that's fine\nif that's what you want but if you're\ntrying to help people I think it's\nfine right so there's a big difference\nbetween acknowledging that the external\nWorld uses a particular kind of\ncommunication has a value system that is\nimportant to them you're going to play\nthat\ngame like I shaved today I didn't want\nto shave today but it looks better when\nI shave so I'm going to play that game\nyeah I have a meeting next week I'm\ngoing to wear a suit I don't care to\nwear suits but I'm going to wear a suit\nI'm going to do the things that the\nworld demands me to do because like you\nknow there's me on the inside and then\nthere's all the trappings that I have to\nhave on the\noutside and when you adopt it that way\nthe other cool thing is that the attacks\nthat people have will stop working on\nyou the only reason that it hurts when\nsomeone says they used to invite real\nacademics is because you don't think\nyou're a real\nacademic right yeah I'm a random dude on\nthe internet yeah and and and I mean\nthere's all kinds of problems with\nAcademia more than 50% of studies can't\nbe reproduced\nright and academics have their own set\nof biases and and things like that so\nit's not like in and often times the the\nreal tragedy is sometimes academics are\nare not that you know there's a\ndifference between a successful\nentrepreneur and a professor of\nEntrepreneurship sometimes the two can\nbe one and the same but sometimes\nthey're\nnot so that's what I would kind of say I\nthink it's it's a good I think it's just\nyou know and if you anytime you stop and\nyou really think about am I this or am I\nthat or if you just stop and notice your\nmomentto moment experience you'll\nrealize that that's entirely\nabsurd nice I'm R I'm going on the\ninternet yep that's all you are that's\ngreat that's a liberating it really\nis great good\nsession did you want to talk about um\nbecause because you meant something you\nmentioned something about okay hold on a\nsecond so you talked about social\nstatus compulsion like do you think\nwe've touched on that\nyeah yeah I think we've touched on it\num the thing I want to talk about so\nuh I'm thinking of settling down and\nhaving a family and stuff in the\nsomewhat near future and there is this\nblog post that you might have seen that\nTim Ferris wrote called 11 reasons not\nto get famous and in it he sort of break\nbasically breaks down how Fame even the\nsort of Fairly Niche sort of Fame that\nsomeone like Tim Ferris has that sort of\nFame comes with all sorts of downsides\nsecurity risks and threats to friends\nand family and all of this sort of stuff\nand I was having a conversation with a\nfriend around like you know I've got\nlike five and a half million subscribers\non YouTube if I you know when I think\nabout what I want to do with my life\nit's he Rand I'm going on the internet\nand I want to share stuff and I want to\nkeep sharing stuff because it's nice to\nmake videos about things and write books\nevery now and then then but that will\nprobably mean that the subscriber count\ngoes up hopefully mean the subscriber\ncount goes up which will increase my\nlevels of Fame and right now I feel like\nI've got a good level of Fame in that\nyou know I might get recognized once or\ntwice on the streets when I'm walking\naround London it's kind of cute it's\nnice but it's not so much Fame that so\nlike some people you and I know who\nwould have for example threats to their\nsafety and random dudes showing up to\ntheir houses or\nwhatever and so there's part of me\nthat's one\nit's like I want to continue doing this\ncareer that I'm doing I know that it's\nprobably going to get to a point where\njust 1% of any large number is like a\nlarge number of people who might be off\ntheir meds or might might have some\nissues so there's real risks to my life\nand my future family's life and yet I\nkeep wanting to do this career thing and\nso a question that I I haven't yet found\nthe answer to when thinking about this\nmyself is to what extent do I just want\nto do this stuff for the sake of a\nrequiring more and more and more social\nstatus and like the follower counts to\ngo to go up you know I made enough money\nand all blah blah blah blah blah blah I\nwon say no to more of it because it's\njust playing the game of\nEntrepreneurship but this thing around\nsocial status and wanting the followers\nto sort of a side effect of doing the\nwork that that you and I do is that the\nfollower account goes up therefore we\nbecome more famous therefore there are\npotential security risks to our\nfamilies what's up with that\nso that's interesting so it sounds like\nyou have not encountered safety risks at\nyour level I had\na I had a small stalker uh a few years\nago okay beyond that not really\nso do do you do you want social\nstatus\nsure is it a desire of yours that you\nwish to be fulfilled is it something you\nstrive\nfor not\ndirectly\num indirectly perhaps because I continue\nto make videos on the\ninternet yeah so I I would also be I'm\nI'm sometimes a little bit different\nfrom some of my colleagues who are\npsychiatrists and mental health\nprofessionals because I sometimes\nattribute like I don't think that there\nhas to be a subconscious motivation for\neverything so I think that the language\nwe use basically Clues us into what it\nis but but I really get the sense from\nyou that you're a guy on the internet\nand the reason that your subscriber\ncount grows is because the more you tap\ninto not trying to make your subscriber\ncount grow and not trying to be famous\nand really get excited about a\nparticular idea and that you try to help\npeople um you know I I just did an\ninterview with sapnap a couple of days\nago and he was kind of talking about how\nauthenticity is really important for the\ncontent that he makes if him and his\nfriends are very excited about it then\nit goes really well I find the same\nthing I think you're going to find the\nsame thing I I I think that some people\nwill crave more numbers I don't get the\nsense that a random guy in the internet\ndoesn't make much\ndifference but there's also this kind of\nidea that like in a dispassionate way\nyou can want to grow and do more and\ncontinue to do more and help more people\nand like that's fine I think that's\nokay so I think there are a couple of\nweird things when it comes to family the\nfirst is that I mean the way that I\nresolve this is is somewhat different I\nthink\num so I and we can talk about that if\nyou want but like I I think uh I I think\nit's okay so I think that sometimes\npeople are worried about the\nhypothetical consequences of their\nactions but that too is based on like a\nhypothetical it's not coming from a\nrandom guy right so it's something you\nhave to be careful about so you need to\nbe careful about safety and stuff like\nthat if you have kids um and something\nyou need to be mindful of but I I don't\nthink that you need to choose one or the\nother\num and and if if you do I mean maybe\nfamous last words on my part but like I\nhave a couple of kids and I think we're\nfine like we recently discovered that\ntheir friends discovered their friend\nlike they have friends that they they\nknow kids that watch like my YouTube\nvideos which is weird right and and for\nthem it was normal like so they would\nwhen they log on to YouTube they see\ndaddy's face so they didn't realize that\nthat was strange so now we've had some\nconversations about that and things like\nthat but then the other really\ninteresting thing is that I mean I sort\nof resolve it from like a karmic\nperspective so I think this is where you\nhave to figure out your own spiritual\ncompass and the importance of this if we\nlook at studies on post-traumatic\ngrowth what we find is that you need\nsome kind of compass to navigate life\nit's not that one Compass is right and\nyou can believe in Jesus or you can be a\nyogi like it doesn't it's not that one\nis better than the other MH it's just\nthat human beings require some\nmetaphysical understanding in order to\norganize and make decisions in their\nlife and that can include atheism and\nbiological\nreductionism that's totally fine it's\njust like this is how the world works\nthere is nothing greater that in and of\nitself is a metaphysical view sure so\nyou just need some way to like guide\nyourself in life like do you want to\nhave kids do you want to have kids yeah\nso then I think it's just about how not\nlike and you may be exposing them to\nsome danger I I I don't know right so\nthere's an objective concern there but I\nI think there's also like the way that I\nkind of resolve it is recognizing that\ntheir souls chose to be incarnated into\ntheir bodies and they get to pick who\ndad and mom are so this is a karmic debt\nand I kind of see that even in my\nrelationship with them where like I I I\nsee many content creators like inside\nthem and so the the bigger challenge is\nlike do we suppress that do we encourage\nthat what do we do with that like that's\na whole different thing but even if you\nlook at like you know there's like\nlineages and you have your parents I'm a\ndoctor my parents were doctors there's\nsomething there that you give your\nkids um and and so they're not making\ncontent or anything but but it's just\ninteresting um but but I I I don't I\ndon't think that I I think as long as\nyou feel good about like the compass\nthat you're using once again it's not a\ngoal there's no there there's not like\nthis thing to be achieved it's like does\nthis feel right in this moment are we\ntaking all the reasonable precautions\nand there's no doubt in my mind that if\nthings tip into the wrong way you'll\nquit like\nthat right so so if you remove ego from\nthe equation then you can go from 5\nmillion or 6 million or 8 million to\nzero in a heartbeat because it doesn't\nmean anything to you\nyeah so if\nyou're you know and and and that's where\nlike it it removing you like that that\nfreedom that you feel is not going to\nchange just because you have kids I\ndon't know if this makes sense but the\nfreedom comes from your attitude not\nyour\ncircumstances right because the book is\nthe book if it's a Wann toe expert\nwriting it then you're stuck if it's a\nrandom guy writing it then you're free\nright so you're just a random guy who\nchose to have kids who happens to have\nthis profession you need to be a little\nbit careful\nyou know with where you go and what you\nadvertise and and things like that but\nlike that's it's just going to be part\nof your life and it feels wrong to you\nat some point as long as you're centered\nthen you'll\nact like if if I really thought it was a\nproblem for my kids I would quit\ntomorrow yeah and\njust and that's part of the reason that\nI work pretty hard is because I\nrecognize that all manner of things\ncould happen that would make me quit\ntomorrow including I could\ndie right so you could die so you make\nit as much as you can you try to do as\nmuch as you can while you\ncan and then if you have to stop you\nhave to stop and I think that's how\neveryone should live for their life like\neveryone's like oh like should I do this\nor should I do this or should I do this\nlike get a good Compass get a good\nplaybook and don't worry so much about\nwhere you end up focus on like what your\nyou know what's your strategy and then\nthe world will give you supportive\ninformation or unsupportive information\nand that you have to\nincorporate nice\nokay yeah that makes a lot of sense\num yeah because I don't around the\nsocial status thing I don't I don't\nreally feel any sort of unhealthy\nattachment to the Social Status part of\nit but there was part of me that was\nlike am I just bullshitting myself about\nthat I don't think I am I think I'm just\nyeah dude on the internet who makes\nvideos and as long as people continue to\nfind them useful great if not that's\nalso fine that sort of thing yeah and\nand find that the more that I I lean\ninto that too like that works really\nwell and I think that's not just on the\ninternet I think this is true of\neverything so like even when I was\ntrying to decide to become a\npsychiatrist I was going to do oncology\noriginally and then when I wanted to do\nPsychiatry I had to deal with ego so I\nwas like that's not a real doctor oh\nright yeah and then I was like okay\nthat's okay I didn't have to convince\nmyself that that was a real doctor I\ndecided if I'm not a real doctor I'm not\na real doctor like that's okay\nyeah nice\nOkay so we've established that I'm a\nrandom dude on the internet which frees\nme from the burden of expectations and\ntrying to live up to some sort of\nidentity but really that identity is an\nabstraction it's a bit of an illusion\nmade up of the trappings and I can use\nthe trappings as like a set of clothes\nbut fundamentally I'm a random dude on\nthe internet who happens to be doing\nthis this sort of thing yeah I mean I I\nand I I think you have to play the game\nso I I think that this is something that\nI've learned learn too where there's a\ncertain amount of ego dissolution that\nis required to own your\naccomplishments right so if I like so\nfor me it was a struggle when I ended up\nat Harvard about like how much do I and\nthere's this weird thing that people at\nHarvard do where they don't say they\nthey're at\nHarvard so we kind of like oh yeah like\nI'm where are you doing residency oh I'm\nin the Northeast I'm in Boston there's\nthis weird thing that people do where\nit's like it's arant to say you're at\nHarvard so you do this weird humble brag\nwhere you don't say it and then you get\nthem to ask like where in Boston oh you\nknow a place and then you like get them\nto ask and ask and then then you finally\nsay oh I'm at Harvard and then they're\nlike oh look at how humble he\nis he's at hard and he's humble he's not\none of the anant ons and then I was like\nthat's dumb right so if I was at the\nUniversity of Texas I would say I'm the\nat the University of Texas you just own\nit so in that same way like you just own\nand you play the game of life if you're\nsuccessful in some way you own it\nI own that I was successful and I own\nthat I was a failure like they're both\nme there's just some random guy you know\none bad game and one good game you have\na w and you have an L like that's life\nyeah yeah great love\nthat\ncool I I I don't have more questions for\nyou I I know we've talked some in the\npast but you know I think like this is\nthis is great dude I think\nit's I think you've you've really come a\nlong way in the last couple of years\nlike thanks yeah and thank you for your\nvarious uh help and support along the\nway\num and I think a lot of the stuff that\nwe talked about is I think is quite\ntransferable to other people too so I I\nthink that there's a lot about ego and\ninsecurity and and it's really hard but\nlike recognizing that you're just a\nrandom dude I think is important for\neverybody yeah or do that\nright cool good stuff thank you very\nmuch you're very welcome so take care\ngood luck um I I strongly recommend yall\ncheck out Ali's book like it is really\nreally good so I I I think it's there's\na reason why it is successful um and\nthen you know Ali mentioned that you\ndon't have kids yet and our book about\npar like parenting video game addiction\nthat one's pretty good too and I think\nthere's a lot of good communication\nstuff in there so if you guys like want\nto learn basic communication techniques\nlike that's that's a good place to get\nthem we don't have like a communication\nguide or anything but I think definitely\ncheck out Alise's channel do you want to\ntell us where we can find you oh yeah um\ncheck out Ali abdal on YouTube or if you\nsearch for Feelgood productivity on\nAmazon or wherever books is sold you\nwill find it and if you enjoy this\nconversation and you've read the book\nthen nice Amazon reviews are my love\nlanguage so I'd really appreciate a nice\nAmazon\nreview yeah so I think we'll try to do\nyou a solid by making sure that those\nnegative reviews are not hidden and\nhopefully people don't troll you but\nanyway so thanks a lot Ali good luck\nwith everything um you know anything\nexciting coming up that we should be\nlike aware of or is it just going to be\nI know you just came out with a book so\nI'm sure you're resting some chilling\njust doing I'm just doing the random\ndude on the internet things like you\njust making videos and enjoying the\njourney along the way cool well\ndefinitely check out Al's content Ali\nthank you so much for coming take care\nbuddy yeah you too\nbye okay so yeah I mean I think we\ncovered a lot of ground pretty quickly I\nknow we usually talk for a little bit\nlonger but I mean did y'all feel like\nwe um did y'all feel like we needed to\nsay more\nstuff I think we kind of wrapped it\nright\num yeah that was good we're good right\nso I I I think this is important to\nunderstand so you know often times we'll\nspend a couple hours with people like\ntwo hours\nbut there's a big diff like so so I\ndon't know if yall notice this but Ali\nis very he does like half the work so I\ndon't know if yall caught this but when\nhe was saying um I forget what it was oh\nyeah he was\nlike I asked him some question and he\nwas like you know I I felt like I had to\nmake a case for myself but then I\nnoticed that I was defending like I was\nlike there was defensiveness there and\nthen I noticed this so often times when\nwe talk to people who are a little bit\nless practiced at this we have to do\nthat back and forth but what I don't\nknow if yall noticed this but he like he\nwould you know he would like chapter\nskip from chapter 2 to chapter five\nwhich makes things way more efficient um\nand and like I like I mean we we've hung\nout in the past and and talked about\nsome of this stuff more just as as peers\nbut um you know and I I think like he's\ndone a lot of work on himself and I\nthink it shows so he's if if you really\npay attention\nwhen I ask him some questions he also\npauses quite a bit and thinks about what\nhis answer is so I think he runs through\nthings whereas many people like we just\ndo a lot of back and forth but I I think\nwe just got there\nfaster um and I think he had his kind of\naha moment a little bit easier which I I\nstrongly encourage yall to really think\nabout like this is\ncrazy but like so many of the problems\nthat we have in our life are actually\ndriven by our\nmind and and it's weird right because\nyou think that as you become more\nsuccessful you become more confident but\noften times what happens is this\ninsecurities only\nincrease and you can look at people who\nare famous and see this many of them\nhave all kinds of different unhealthy\nbehaviors kind of like and I'm honestly\nnot trying to call anyone out I'm I'm\njust saying we should use our powers of\nobservation to understand what we see\naround us and it's not just famous\npeople right that when you're content\nwith with yourself and you stop trying\nto live up to other people's\nexpectations when you stop trying to\nlive up to your own expectations Ali is\na great case of how trying to live up to\nyour own expectations will never\nwork he's like books are written\ngravitas legitimacy it's like what more\ndo you need dude you went to Cambridge\nyou worked at the NHS you're a doctor\nyou got 5 million subscribers on YouTube\nwhat more do you need to be\nlegitimate now people may say like and\nif you actually ask the ego the ego will\nsay oh I need this this and\nthis I do need a PhD in organizational\npsychology here's the scam when you get\na PhD in organizational psychology your\nmind will tell you you need something\nelse yall see that it moves the\ngoalposts on you so\nquickly because the insecurity is there\nso it will manifest in whatever way it\nwants to right so if I if I think I am a\nloser and I do something well my mind\nwill say that's not\nenough you need to be more of a winner\nyou need to be more more more more\nmore and generally speaking that's how\ninsecurity works because the parts of\nour brain that feel insecurity are not\ndriven by Logic they're driven by\nemotion and I I didn't read this this\nblog post by Tim Ferris but it's like\nreally interesting right because what we\nalso see is that as you become more\nfinancially free I've seen this a lot\nwhere people start to become more\nparanoid and I see this a lot with like\npeople who I work with who are very\nfinancially successful and then try to\ndate because now you don't know like\nwhat is this person interested in are\nthey interested in me or are they\ninterested in my\nmoney so there are all kinds of problems\nthat come when we feel insecure\nso as you become secure in yourself you\nwill be able to judge what other people\nsend your\nway I don't know if this kind of makes\nsense\nbut see when I'm secure my mind does not\nadd things to the\nequation so I'll give you all an example\nso I got made fun of a lot when I was\nyoung for all kinds of things bullied\nand things like that some of it was\nracist some of it was religion some of\nit was I sucked at football some of it\nwas I was smarter than the other kids\nsome of it was I was\nugly and so what happens is if you have\na kid who thinks they're ugly and\nsomeone compliments their appearance\nthey will reject that compliment so\nthere is the real\nworld and then there is the way that\nyour mind responds to the real world and\nshapes the real\nworld so now we create a very dangerous\nsituation because if someone complement\nmy appearance and I believe I am ugly I\nam shaping the world the data from the\nworld through the lens of my\nbeliefs and this happens when you're\ninsecure there are also studies that\nshow that people who develop imposter\nsyndrome do so because they do not\ncredit themselves for their\nvictories if they do well they attribute\nit to luck circumstance teammates Etc\ntheir mind does a very specific thing\nwhere it discounts their effort\nthe other interesting thing is when they\nlook at other people's success the Mind\ndiscounts their luck their circumstances\ntheir teammates and when someone else\ndoes something good it's because of\ntheir hard work but when I do something\ngood it's because I get\nlucky so if we really look at an\ninsecurity it filters the information\nthere's a ton of research on this\ncognitive bias and depression we've kind\nof talked about this you know we've had\nseveral lectures about this\nbut now we have to be now we understand\nwhy fixing an insecurity doesn't\nnecessarily come from accomplishment\nbecause even when you accomplish it\nwon't address the underlying insecurity\nbecause your mind will shape the\naccomplishment you'll come up with some\nexcuse oh yeah I got an A but it was\njust\nonce one person said that I was\ngood-looking but maybe they're making\nfun of they're just trying to be nice\nthis is my favorite favorite thing that\nan insecure person says they're trying\nto be nice they don't really believe it\nhow the [ __ ] do you know what they\nbelieve like what when did you become\ntelepathic wow that's\ncrazy\nright you're not telepathic but that's\nwhat the Mind\ndoes you automatically reject it so this\nis the problem is you go on trying to\nfix your\ninsecurity by fixing things in your life\nbut the problem is with you you carry it\naround and what it takes is to resolve\nthe insecurity\ninternally and we can even see when Ali\ndid that there was like a a sh shift\nwhere he said why can't you be a guy\nwriting a book right so it's so happens\nthat the publisher likes this this and\nthis but that's just the game of life\nthat's just the trappings those are\nthat's the clothes we wear it doesn't\nmatter who you are oh I'm successful\nlike what what is\nthat it's not a thing\nyou can say no but success like how do\nyou define success like you know people\nask that\nquestion and the reason there isn't an\nanswer is because people ask the\nquestion no one asks you know how do you\ndefine a\nchair like everyone knows how to define\na chair a chair is a chair success is\nSuccess like we don't we don't know it's\nlike is it a certain amount of money is\nit this is it this is it this it's an\nabstraction of the\nmind so the really interesting thing is\nthat if you want to fix your insec\nsecurity you don't need to fix anything\nabout your outside life and in fact\nfixing your outside life will make the\ninsecurity go dormant sometimes increase\nit which is what we see in clinical\npathology of things like body dysmorphia\nor\nanorexia where I objectively change my\ncircumstances but I continue believing\nwhat I\nbelieve and then what happens is long as\nthe insecurity is there you can attain\nall the success in the world and all it\ntakes is one YouTube comment and it's\nnot one YouTube comment I'm sure there's\nbazillion YouTube comments but which one\nsticks in your\nmind the one that resonates with your\nfears and so the real way to overcome an\ninsecurity is to\naccept this could be\ntrue I am a loser I'm just a random guy\nI don't have gravitas and that's okay\nand if you really pay attention what\nyou'll find is that in your mind there's\nthis idea that it is not okay in some\nway to not be what you are or to be what\nyou are we attach something you have to\nreally pay attention because you say are\nyou a loser what's the problem with\nbeing a loser and if you really pay\nattention you don't have a good answer\nyour mind will come up with answers\nthey'll say that means that I won't have\nsuccess and I won't have a relationship\nand I'll never have kids and I'll never\ndo this and I'll oh can you see the\nfuture that's so interesting no losers\ndon't do those things well hold on a sec\nwhat does that even mean CU there are a\nlot of people who were in your situation\nwho are able to do those things even you\ncan do those things what you end up\ndoing is dependent on your actions not\nwho you\nare what's the difference between\nsomeone who has a relationship and\nsomeone who doesn't have a relationship\nnow a lot of people will say it's\nbecause of their height or their\nphysical appearance and I'm not saying\nthat those things aren't legitimate\nright we did this huge lecture on\nbaldness and there are absolutely\nobjective disadvantages in life but if\nyou pay attention you will find that\namongst a population of that objective\ndisadvantage many people are able to\nachieve what they want to if we look at\nthe span of people who are bald is being\nbald does it give you a disadvantage\n100%\nyes are bald people unable to find\nrelationships 100% no\nI tried to look this up and I couldn't\nfind an answer I tried to figure out\nwhat percentage of people who are bald\nare in relationships I couldn't find\nstatistics on\nit so this is the really important thing\nto understand in life you're dealt a\ngood hand of cards or a bad hand of\ncards no disputing\nthat some of us are lucky some of us are\nunlucky fair\nenough but your luck doesn't determine\nwhat happens it's the way that that you\nplay your hand that ultimately\ndetermines your\nfuture now I tend to believe that there\nis a lot more control over our lives\nthan maybe the average person on the\ninternet I've got good reasons for that\nyou're allowed to also not believe that\nright so this is based on my experience\nand my understanding of Neuroscience and\nclinical Psychiatry and I've worked with\npeople and I've seen them consistently\ngo from Zero to\nHero we've seen it we see posts in our\ncommunity all the time people are making\nprogress things like that right it\nhappens and so the main thing that we've\ngot to really think about is the way\nthat our\ninsecurities shape the way that we live\nthe world and that's the real\ndevastating thing so there's a cool\npaper that I I've cited a couple of\ntimes I can pull it up if you guys want\nto but there's this paper about\nhow a perception of a low perception of\nyour control in your life so if you per\nif you\nperceive or believe that you are not in\ncontrol of your life this creates\nstressful\nsituations it is the belief that you are\nout of control that creates chaos in\nyour life this is a dependent causal\nrelationship that has been\ndemonstrated there's a great paper by\nRandy arbach I think from mlan\nhospital I was lucky enough to train\nthere beautiful paper on\nthis that when we are anxious we create\nbad situations we are worried about the\nwe are terrified of what our professor\nis going to do if we ask for an\nextension so we don't ask for an\nextension and that creates the problem\nI'm terrified of how this person will\nreact if I say no I'm sorry I can't pick\nyou up at the airport so then I end up\ntrying to juggle too many things and\nthen I end up disappointing both people\nbecause I took on too\nmuch so instead of disappointing one\nperson now I've disappointed two people\nand what is the reason for that it's\nbecause I was not willing to set a\nboundary or I believed I didn't have a\nchoice so this is really\ncrazy right and like so insecurities\nlike we we carry them around but and the\nreason that often times it's so hard to\nfix them is because we don't try to\ndissolve the insecurity directly we try\nto fix the circumstances that We Believe\ncreate the insecurity but when we do\nthat all we do is make our\nselfworth tied to our\ncircumstances you're not actually\nconquering anything you are VI you're\nnot victimizing is not the right word\nyou're tying these two things together\nand the whole point is to sever your\nself sense of selfworth with the outside\nworld that's the goal to be independent\nof the world around you to be stable\nbalanced it doesn't mean that the world\ndoesn't affect you in some way but that\nyou should be\ngrounded now people may wonder how do I\ndo that that's where you have to address\nthe insecurity\ndirectly where did this idea come from\nwhy do I believe this and your mind will\ngive you lots of\nevidence and then there's a beautiful\nquestion you can ask what is the\nevidence that I\nignore and it is not why you ignore it\nyou're going to be justified and\nignoring it your mind will tell you oh\nthere's a thousand reasons why this is\nthis this doesn't count doesn't count\nthey're just being nice they don't\nreally believe\nit so just list out the stuff that you\nchoose to ignore the stuff that you\ndiscount and then it's interesting right\nwhy does it get discounted because\nyou're\ninsecure and so now we create a vicious\ncycle and this is why things like\ndepression get worse over time\nbecause we're we are abandoning the\ncontrary evidence which then reinforces\nour\nbelief right and there are a couple of\nother things that we can do to work\nthrough an insecurity often times\ninsecurities happen in the presence of\nothers so this is also what's really\ninteresting we have two different parts\nof our brain that emotion comes from we\nhave our primitive brain which is where\nfear anxiety anger come from but things\nlike insecurity shame and other things\nlike that come from the part of our\nbrain that is fundamentally social so\nthere's social emotions and non-social\nemotions nonsocial emotions are are uh\nare exist in animals social emotions\nexist in some\nanimals and so the interesting thing if\nyou have a problem with a social emotion\nis to spend time with yourself and like\nthat tends to\nhelp so go for walks go spend time in\nnature that stuff works really really\nwell\nokay\num so someone saying dissociation\noverpowered everything for me yeah so\nlike we we just came out with a trauma\nguide we know dissociation is a huge\nproblem uh so two things if if\ndissociation is an issue we did an\nawesome Deep dive into dissociation I\nmean maybe yall think it's maybe it's\nawesome I don't know I really enjoyed\ndoing it let me say that right so I\nthink people enjoyed it too\nso I think it's great strongly recommend\nyall check that out that should be uh a\nstream that y'all can watch it happened\nthis month so if youall all want to\nlearn more about dissociation incredibly\npowerful powerful thing to understand we\nalso have a whole guide to trauma which\nwe've heard really really good things\nabout we made it with a lot of love\ndefinitely check it out I think people\nare saying it's very good so that's what\nwe we made it for yall right so when we\nmake a guide it's not this is what Dr K\nthinks is a good idea what I literally\ndo is for four years years we've been\npaying attention to the experiences and\nmanifestation of trauma in y'all's lives\nand it's taken us time to figure out\nwhat to include what not to include and\nthe way the reason we find stuff to\ninclude is because we pay attention to\nwhat y'all's problems are and then we\nbuild a guide for\nthat is dissociation when you don't feel\nlike yourself for some reason that's\ndepersonalization but the two are\nconnected dissociation is when you feel\ndisconnected\nfrom the world around\nyou depersonalization is when you feel\ndisconnected from\nyourself it's all in the same vein\nthough I think it's a little bit Dr K's\nguide to spiritual spirituality or\nEnlightenment when we have a guide to\nmeditation which covers a lot of it we\ncover a lot of this stuff on the\nmembership side but guide to\nEnlightenment I got to get enlightened\nfirst\nright um\ndissociation is trippy sometimes people\nwill take drugs to trip and\ndissociate is the retreat idea\ncompletely dead absolutely not the\nretreat idea is being stoked and kept\nsafe until we can karmically accomplish\nit will it happen in this life I have no\nidea right so this is one of the things\nwhere the hand that I was dealt\nunfortunately does not make me a\nspiritual Guru with a cult\ncompound sag I am a doctor I'm a loser I\nam a\ngamer no spiritual Guru to be found here\nand so one day if if it happens I think\nit'll be fun we did a healthy gamer\nRetreat back in like 2020 or something\nit was insane and awesome and one of the\nbest experiences of my life eight or\nnine strangers from across the internet\nwe showed up and we lived together in a\ncabin for like 4 days it was\ngreat\num and uh yeah it was\ncool and then like so so you know that\nthat was more doable and it was scary\nright because we didn't know like we\ndidn't know who was going to show up\nlike do\npeople you know do they do they\nunderstand hygiene like you know is\nsomeone going to be\nlike use slurs like we you don't know\nwho's going to show\nup\num and so and and back then it was also\nfine like I mean people were like you\nknow I I paid for it but I that's doable\nwhen there's like eight people showing\nup like now I don't know like if we do a\nretreat like how many people are going\nto show up like I don't think I can pay\nfor\nthat um so it's\nchallenging yeah I mean I'd love to do a\nretreat but it's it's logistically it's\nvery difficult the the finances are\nproblematic the Optics are problematic\nthere's risks it's going to move us one\nstep closer to being a\ncult you know like it's\nchallenging can you talk about your\ndecision to change from oncology to\nPsychiatry\nabsolutely so my desire to be oh so I I\ngenuinely\nliked treating cancer so I thought it\nwas a cool concept so there's this\nconcept that cancer is when a cell\nforgets to die that's all it is and I\nwas always fascinated by Things That Go\nfundamentally wrong in the human body\nand how one small thing a cell has\nforgotten how to die can create such big\nproblems and so the other thing that was\nreally attractive to me about it is like\nthis concept that like this can be cured\nlike this can do we can do this as the\nhuman race we can teach a cell how to\ndie\nagain I thought cancer was also really\nfascinating because it wasn't localized\nto one part of the body right so it's\nnot like you're a cardiologist or a\npsychiatrist you actually get to deal\nwith all the organ\nsystems so it was like kind of like a\nspecialized generalist which is what I\nreally like\ndoing and it was also like curing cancer\nright there was a lot of ego involved\nwhere I was like I'm going to be a real\ndoctor and I'm going to like save lives\nand stuff like that like I wanted to be\nsomething and then what I sort of found\nin med school is I you know i' done some\ninternal work and learned how to pay\nattention to myself and what I started\nto find is that I really enjoyed\nspending time with people so I had a\ngreat mentor who said if you can't\ndecide what so I was like I'm torn I\nkind of like Psychiatry I know it's\ninsane I kind of like Psychiatry I went\nto my family and they're like that's\ncrazy dude you can't do Psychiatry I was\nlike okay fine so I went to one of my\nmentors and I was like I don't know what\nto do and they were like okay you do\nthis you do something called a sub\ninternship which is like a one month\nintensive rotation in both Fields so you\ndo one month of internal medicine one\nmonth of Psychiatry and at the end of\nevery day you sit down and you write\nwhat you liked about the day and what\nyou didn't like about the\nday and then what I realized is I liked\nthe days in Psychiatry way more what I\nrealized is that the practice of\nmedicine today is primarily in front of\na computer ordering lab tests reviewing\nlab tests ordering x-rays reviewing\nx-rays reading consult notes talking on\nthe phone communicating with insurance\nthis is how we practice a\nlot very little in terms of physical\ndiagnosis because we have all these\ninstruments now and I thought physical\ndiagnosis is super cool I still think\nit's super cool I'm teaching it to my\nkids very cool I don't know how good at\nit I am because I don't do it very much\nnow but it's like super cool I also had\na a senior resident who from India and\nshe was awesome at physical diagnosis\nbecause she she went to med school where\nthere wasn't a whole lot of\ninstrumentation so they really had to\nuse like all kinds of cool physical\ndiagnostic techniques to figure out\nwhat's going\non so I I found that the practice of\nmedicine dayto day and also oncology is\nvery like protocolized so it's like\nwe're going to do this kind of thing and\nthere all these binders and charts and\nyou do this dosage for this kind of\nthing and you stage the cancer and you\ndo this and you do this it it felt more\nformulaic I don't think it practically\nit's not as formulaic as I'm describing\nin right so there's a lot of nuance and\nart in in\noncology that's what separates good\noncologists from Bad oncologist because\nit's not just about the\nprotocols but I found that I just liked\nspending time with\npeople and so when I was doing oncology\nit was like 8 hours a day in front of a\ncomputer 2 hours a day with my patients\nand in Psychiatry it was like 2 hours a\nday in front of a computer and like\neight hours a day with my patients and I\njust liked that\nmore I also thought it was cool because\nwe don't have instrumentation in\nPsychiatry so I felt like I had\nto my understanding was way more\nimportant there's no map hack x-ray is\nlike a map hack so for me it was\npersonally more gratifying and I really\ndevoted myself to like trying to\nunderstand how much can you figure out\nfrom a human being based on the words\nthat they\nuse stuff like that so I loved that\nso that's how I\ndecided right and and and so so this\nthis to we were talking you know with\nAli about like your existence is dayto\nday and so what I sort of noticed and\nthat that's one of the places I learned\nthis right so I sort of theoretically\nlearned this stuff in India learned it\nsomewhat practically but when it came\ndown to Choosing My\nCareer it came down to moment to\nmoment if I was you know if I worked on\na particular day and then there was some\ncatastrophic accident heaven forbid and\nI was on death's door the next day and I\nlooked at my previous 24 hours would I\nhave been happy with how I spent that\nday that's the way that I\nthink and even in terms of how we've\nspent this last month am I happy with\nthe way that we've spent the last month\nabsolutely we've streamed a ton we've\nmade a ton of content we do a bunch of\nQ&A we've done a lot of stuff this month\nwe're traveling for work next week we're\nnot going to say what we're doing or\nwhere but y'all will see it if y'all pay\nP attention to our socials like that's\ngoing to be pretty cool hopefully we're\ndoing a lot of work and why because it's\nimportant to do right you should feel\ngood about what you do day to\nday and the biggest problem that I see\nwith so many people is we feel so burnt\nout about what we do dayt\nday and then we like when we feel burnt\nout we learn\navoidance is a coping\nmechanism right so literally when I burn\nmyself what does my hand do I retract my\nhand and so we're being programmed to be\navoidant in life and once we start being\navoidant we can't change our\ncircumstances I hate going to work every\nday why is it hard for me to find a\ndifferent job because H I don't have the\nenergy I'm so burnt out so when there's\nsomething difficult we avoid it so we\nbecome like\nturtles if you really pay attention to\nwhat's happening in life people are\nstuck between devices pulling their\nattention out and then getting burned by\nthe real world and going back in\neveryone's stuck in Cycles social\nanxiety\nloneliness feeling alone trying to date\nuninstalling dating apps reinstalling\ndating\napps quitting this platform joining this\nplatform uninstalling this game\ninstalling this other\ngame right so we bounce back and forth\nbetween so many different things and if\nwe look at what's the bouncing it's\nbecause we avoid we can't sit with\nnegativity right and the real challenge\nis that\nlike making a positive life is not about\nthe avoidance of negativity it's about\nmoving towards\nnegativity and once you start and this\nis the real weird Paradox when I try to\navoid the negative I lose control of my\nlife and life becomes more negative when\nI move towards the negative my life\nactually becomes more positive usually\nyou don't want to you you want to be\ncareful with it right so you don't want\nto like surround yourself with toxic\npeople who are\nabusive but like generally speaking like\nlean into discomfort more lean into\ndifficulty don't run away from it and I\nthink it'll be better for\nyou what do you do when what what would\nmake you happy dayto day is not\nachievable now and require strength to\nreach it this is a great question\nwhat would you do when what makes you\nhappy day to day is not achievable this\nthe reason that this is a problem is\nbecause the assumptions are\nincorrect the idea that achieving\nsomething would make you happy day to\nday I think is theoretically\nincorrect so what I would strongly\nrecommend that youall do is ask yourself\nfor my happiness what percentage of this\ndo I control and what percentage of this\nis the outside world\ncontrol so let's say you go to a movie\nthat is\nboring can you increase your enjoyment\nof the movie by even\n1% let's say you're eating something\nthat you don't like can you increase\nyour enjoyment of the the food by at\nleast\n1% and so we have a very big problem in\nour society today which we've been\nconditioned to think which is that we've\nbeen conditioned to think that achieving\nsomething externally will make us Happ\nhappy side hustle entrepreneur achieve\nthis date this buy this bag wear this\nbag look like this wear this perfume get\nthis video game get this get this like\ncollector's edition\n$145 version of this video game that by\nthe way is bugged and really shouldn't\nhave been released to begin with get\nthis cosmetic DLC and then you'll be\nhappier and do this and you'll be\nhappier we've been conditioned by\nSociety to think that happiness comes\nfrom the outside\nwhy is society conditioned this way\ngreat because they're creating a problem\nand they are selling you the\nsolution of course makes sense\nadvertisers figured out a long time ago\nthat creating insecurities in US was a\ngreat way to sell\nthings this is why models are\nattractive because when you look at a\nmodel some part of your brain is like oh\nthis person is better looking than I am\nI don't feel good about my appearance\nand what do models sell do they sell\nvideo games no they sell\nclothing and then what happens is we\nassociate this beauty with this clothing\nand we feel insecure because they're\nmore attractive than us so let me get\nthe let me get the clothing right so\nthey're over here and I'm over\nhere and if I get the clothing at least\nI can move this this way I'm halfway\nthere they figured that\nout right if you look at beer\ncommercials this is another a great\nexample people in beer commercials are\nlike on the beach and they're surfing\nand they're splashing and everyone's in\nbikinis and then this is what I want\nyall to do go to a grocery store that\nsells beer and watch who buys the beer\ntell me how many bikinis you see tell me\nhow many people are going to go to the\nbeach this is what\nhappens and so then we think oh I would\nbe happy if this I'm not saying that you\nshouldn't strive for things by all mean\nstrive for things and accomplish things\nbut recognize that half of it comes from\nthe outside and half of it comes from\nthe\ninside and a lot of people will say\nmoney doesn't buy happiness money gives\nyou security security is protective\nagainst unhappiness and\nstress that's absolutely true there's\nNuance here but also more many more\nproblems less money even more problems\nright so there's an internal component\nand an external component and don't\nconfuse the two that's what we're\nadvocating\nfor don't give up on the stuff that you\ncan control just because there's stuff\nthat you can't control so we're going to\ntalk about a couple things so we did\nsome cool\nstuff before we wrap up\ntoday so we had a community\nchallenge make it\nmay so it look looks like we ended up\nwith 1 1\nmillion no yeah\n1,247 660\npoints okay\nso um through gamified activities across\nfour weekly themes participants earn\npoints and unlock Community Awards so it\nlooks\nlike we are going to get a Dr K pickup\nArtist review stream but it looks like\nyou guys missed the boat on this stretch\ngoal and we missed the boat on this\nstretch goal fair enough we hit a\nmillion that's pretty good right this is\nsort of this was like the first stretch\ngoal so what we did over the as a\ncommunity over the month of\nMay we focused one week on making\nconcrete plans goal setting and time\nmanagement week two was on making\nconnections building healthy\nrelationships forming communities and\nnetworks using our creative skills and\nself-expression to enhance our mental\nhealth Journeys is what we did week\nthree and then the last week was focuses\non using skills and passions to make\npositive actual change in the lives of\nothers so good job\nchat um we\nalso I don't know what this is we oh we\nalso had\na so we'll show you all this um we also\ndid a super cool like hackathon so we\nhad a creative jam and a hackathon so\npeople in our community like built stuff\nso emotional link organizing our\nemotions this is cool so fu to zad meu\nand shita sorry for butchering your name\nmade this the app helps improve mental\nhealth by making emotional patterns\nvisible and\nmanageable connecting our life events\nvisual representations so emotional link\nis a web app designed to help users\norganize and understand their emotions\nit provides a visual representation of\nLife events and\ninteractions app helps improve mental\nhealth by making emotional patterns\nvisible and manageable this is a pitch\nthey put together okay so like this is\ncool like we're talking about oh like\nhow do I do this how do I do this like\npeople are doing it in our community\nwe're like learning these skills and\nthey're actually building this um\nthere's questionnaires for detailed\ndescriptions of events visual\nrepresentation of events in life right\nso each node in the graph represents an\nevent nodes are colored based on the\nemotions that they felt you can filter\nthings so this is like cool so what\nwe're actually going to do is just show\ny'all\nokay so let's\nsee\nevent myself event name streamed event\ndate\nemotion I\nfelt\nJoy I felt you need to get level two oh\n[ __ ]\nenjoy show more options this is cool\nphysical\nfeelings tickle in my pickle\nwhat have you\ndone tickled my\npickle what would you have wished to do\ntickled your\npickle\nokay cool what does that emotion tell\nyou\ndank all right so we created an event so\nthis is cool right there's a joy so now\nlet's add something create related\nevent got\ncancelled\nemotions sad impact\nnine right so then I got cancelled\ncool so like this is neat right so we're\ngoing to do like different then we got\ncancelled and then\nI updated\nresume and then\nthis came with\nfear not so much so I guess we're\ncreating and so this is cool like they\nbuilt\nthis and I guess there are levels that\nyou can unlock complete daily tasks to\nimprove your mental health like this is\nawesome right so we're like building\nthis one step at a time and these people\nactually built it like how cool is\nthat um there's another thing we also\nhad a creative Jam so I'm going to go\nahead and mute or I can do\nthis so I think I think uh let me see\nwho is\nthe\num so a love letter to third\nspaces we're going to try to show some\nof this stuff so here's some music that\npeople made I think this is made by is\nthis art official let me\nsee um\nokay uh so let's let's take a look at\nthis\nofficial Lon one night Loveless fright\nFrozen in mind the Kindred kind Jam the\nsnake found my lap T tle to see no\nlonger human only\nGlee relinquished tether power Unbound\nit promise was made for set a blaze\nthrough the jittery\n[Music]\nsome World in your hand all it demands\nyour heart and\nsoul disconnected\ndiscontent soes the toll of your cyber\nfriend so\nterminal\n10,000\npixels blink back SED life B their\nlashes hwk for time\na pulsing deep a cry pumps our hearts\nthrough Tangled wires this is cool it's\nlike the doctor says to p a plug like I\ncan't talk your ver will fade you're\njust a husk I mean I think it's like a\ncreative expression right there's\nthere's extend dring glass there's\nvisuals even storm Road waves can break\nupon the\nshores not\n[Music]\nagain a well wien nest reused theyed\nfine by smooth warn\nGres your monitors shine through\ncataracts blinding old portraits of\nsplined\nMs where would I wash up if I pulled\nyour plug a sheltered Beach a fading\nhusk it's been we're going to show so\nlike I definitely recommend youall check\nthat out I want to make sure that we\nhave time for a couple of other things\nso I'm going to pause for a second um\nyou know so like this is cool like this\nis a love letter to the third spaces a\ncollection of thoughts and feelings on\nour favorite spaces so made by Jared\nmatcha only tiny\nowl eag KK and\nFrills\num right so this is like it's just\ncreative\nexpression not work not\nhome and so like this is cool like\npeople in our community like together\nand just made\nstuff and it's cool like they made like\npeople programmed things they made apps\nthat may make help may help people they\nmade artistic Creations that are kind of\nlike\ntrippy right that like this seems to be\nfun to look at depending on what's going\non in your\nbrain and then there's also like\ncommentary and artistic expression like\nI I think the main thing that I really\nwant yall to understand is like this is\ndoing\nstuff people are doing stuff and we get\nso caught up about doing particular\nthings we have to do the right things\nwhat's the point of writing a book if\nyou can't publish it what's the point of\nmaking art if it's not going to make you\nmoney what's the point of developing an\napp if it doesn't have\nmicrotransactions see we all get hung up\non doing stuff for a reason we can't do\ndo stuff for no\nreason and so if you really want to be\nin control of your life you must learn\nhow to do something for no\nreason if you require a reason to do\nsomething you will your actions will\nalways be beholden to the outside\nworld true control comes from no\nreason Joy comes from no reason\nwhen children play they don't not trying\nto accomplish anything and it is through\ntheir play that they become more\ncompetent that's how we level up we\nlevel up through\npractice not through\nreason and there's a big bottleneck of a\ngeneration of people now where we can't\nact because we've all been conditioned\nto act because of something go to J\ncollege so that you can get a good job\nand make more money if you're in the\nUnited States going to college is the\nfirst step to being in\ndebt the whole world told us hey you\nshould do this for this reason and then\nwhat happened is people figured out that\nif we're people are doing things for a\nreason if the reason is strong enough we\ncan insert [ __ ] into it and they'll\nstill do it because the reason is good\nenough so we can make College more\nexpensive we can do shrink\nflation because we're advertising some\nkind of\nbenefit and so then we feel blocked oh I\ndon't have\nmotivation and that's the problem then\nwe think we have to have motivation but\nthen imagine how free you will be if you\ndon't need motivation to act and that's\nwhat's so awesome about this is like\npeople are actually building stuff what\nis this for I have no\nidea but it's worth a lot so I I don't\nknow if youall know this but I wrote a\nbook 5 years ago was never published I\nwrote a book about technology\naddiction and so is there value to\nwriting a book that never sees the light\nof day it's an absolute piece of [ __ ]\nwork it's like Arcane and dense\nand preachy it's like all the things\nlike how to raise a healthy gamer is a\nway better book right but I don't think\nI could have written how to raise a\nhealthy gamer or write the book that I'm\nworking on now or even stream the way\nthat I do unless I had written that\nfirst\nbook the problem in life is that we\ndon't know what the consequences of our\nactions are and so sometimes we are\nparalyzed to act without knowing what\nthe consequences are sometimes we have\nto act first and then learn about the\nconsequences that's how children learn\neven if you're playing a video game you\nknow people say the best thing to do if\nyou're trying to learn go or chess is to\nlose your first 100 games as quickly as\npossible it's the best way to learn but\nwhat's happened in our society is we've\nstopped losing any games we just want to\nwin we're afraid to lose so we're afraid\nto act and that's what I think is so\nawesome about this is people like got\ntogether they collaborated I assume they\nfigured out some working Dynamic I'm\nsure they leveled up their social skills\nthey leveled up their motivation they\nleveled up their work ethic their\nconscientiousness and they built stuff\nand then they got better at building\nstuff so the next thing that they will\nbuild will be\nbetter and the next thing that they will\nbuild will be\nbetter it's about leveling up\nIRL last thing is that we want to shout\nout some uh give a huge shout out to\nsome creators that have been fundraising\nfor the healthy gamer Foundation\nthroughout mental health May so we have\na foundation that's dedicated towards\nmental health research and advocacy we\nuse the proceeds for grants for some of\ny'all donations to mental health\norganizations and things like that y'all\nwill hopefully see some of the effects\nof some of the work that the foundation\nhas been doing within the next
