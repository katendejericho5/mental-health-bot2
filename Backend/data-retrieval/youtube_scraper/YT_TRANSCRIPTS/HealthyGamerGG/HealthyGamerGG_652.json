    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about the\nsurprising link between getting pissed\non the internet and being kind of stuck\nIRL\n[Music]\nso the first thing is that a lot of\npeople think that these two things\naren't linked and that's how I thought\nabout it too when we sort of think about\nbeing pissed off online we kind of think\nabout things like rage bait right\nthere's all kinds of stuff that gets\nkind of passed around the internet\nthings rise to the top because some CEO\nsaid something that pisses everyone off\nor some popular figure did something\nthat is really upsetting people or we're\nkind of learning about like all these\ninjustices in the world and all the\nKarens out there and we feel really\nreally angry and on the flip side we\nhave problems with motivation everyone's\nstruggling with motivation and ADHD is\non the rise and I can't kind of control\nwhat I want to do and even though\nthere's a lot of stuff I should be doing\nI can't bring myself to do it and we\nsort of think that that second thing is\nalso related to stuff like dopamine and\nTechnology addiction and video game\naddiction and we sort of think about\nboth of these as kind of individual or\nindependent manifestations of the world\nwe live in hey there thanks for watching\nand I'm glad these videos have been\nhelpful a lot of times I'll read the\ncomments and see people asking well what\ndo I actually do about it which is a\ngreat question and unfortunately the\nresources out there haven't been that\ngreat which is precisely why I started\nHD in the first place HG coaches are\ntrained on a curriculum that integrates\nmy understanding of what motivates us\nwhat paralyzes us and most importantly\nwhat leads to Lasting behavioral change\nif you're ready to take the next step HG\ncoaches can help you build the life that\nyou want they've helped people build\ncareers help people find relationships\nbuild networks of friends and even do\nthings like discover their passions or\npursue Hobbies so if this sounds like\nsomething that you'd be interested in\ncheck out the link in the description\nbelow as I started to work with more and\nmore people who struggle with motivation\nIRL and I started to assess their\ntechnology use I started to pick up a\nreally interesting signal that there\nseemed to be a direct correlation\nbetween how stuck someone is IRL and how\noften they get pissed online and what I\nsort of realized is that this is\nactually a really classic trauma\nresponse that has a new manifestation in\nthe digital age and so that may confuse\nyou for a couple of reasons first of all\nlike how on Earth is this a trauma\nresponse sounds like a stretch and\nsecondly I haven't really been\ntraumatized so this probably doesn't\napply to me but once I explain it\nhopefully it'll make a little bit more\nsense so let's start with how is this a\nclassic trauma response is there a lot\nof studies that have been done on trauma\nand we've looked at studies for example\nof like prisoners like prisoners of war\nthat are in concentration camps and\nwe've also looked at people like kids in\nchildhood abuse situations and what we\nsort of discovered is that in these\nsituations the person who is kind of\ntraumatized is in a situation where\nthere is an inherent power Dynamic and\nthey're generally speaking powerless so\nsome figure in their life that exercises\ncomplete control over their life and\nwhen you're in a situation where you\ncan't exert any control being angry\nbecomes completely useless so even\nthough injustices are being perpetrated\non you let's say you're a prisoner of\nwar and and the guards are treating you\nlike crap or even abusing you or you're\nin a home situation where your parent\ndoesn't care what you think doesn't care\nwhat you say doesn't care how you feel\nand is controlling aspects of your life\ngetting pissed is actually damaging to\nyou because if you get pissed at the\nguards they will punish you if you get\nangry and talk back to your parents they\nwill teach you the meaning of respect\nand so what happens in these situations\nwhere someone is controlling your life\nand you're not allowed to express anger\nyou start to express that anger in safe\nplaces because the anger's in here it's\ngot to be expressed in some way and so\nwhat these kids and adults end up\nlearning how to do is they discover this\none really important rule which is that\nI'm not allowed to be angry unless it's\nin a safe space and what do those safe\nspaces look like in some cases this is\nkind of why we see kids who are in\nabusive households start to bully other\nkids so I'm pissed at home because my\nparents are treating me like crap but I\ncan't do anything thing about that if I\nstart talking back to them the abuse is\ngoing to increase the toxicity is going\nto increase so where can I safely\nExpress anger I can't express it to\nadults right I can't get mad at teachers\nbecause teachers will punish me but what\nI can do what is the safest expression\nof anger is I can find the smallest kid\nin class the least threatening kid and I\ncan start to bully him and what we sort\nof see in in adults and prisoners of war\nis that they will oftentimes displace\nthat anger in safe places and what does\nit mean to safely displace anger or\nsafely Express that anger that means\nthat you can express anger sort of as\nmuch as you want and there's a\nnever-ending outlet for your anger and\nthat there's no consequence to\nexpressing the anger so when I express\nanger I don't get punished in some way\nso I wonder if there is any situation\nthat exists today where I can get as mad\nas I want to and there are never any\nconsequences hmm I wonder if the\ninternet that allows me to do that\nbecause the internet is full of Rage\nbait and I can get pissed about this and\nI can get pissed about this and I can\nget pissed about this I can even type\nthese really really devastating comments\nwhere I'm putting people in their place\nand teaching them how facts don't care\nabout your feelings and all this kind of\nstuff and I can express and induce a lot\nof rage and there's really no\nconsequence right because what's the\nconsequence of getting mad on the\ninternet maybe I get banned from one\ncommunity and I can just make another\naccount and post there anyway or I can\njust move to a different community so I\nstarted to realize that the internet is\nactually like one of these spaces where\npeople can safely displace anger now the\nnext thing that you may be wondering\nabout is okay fine I get pissed off on\nthe internet maybe some of it is Rage\nbait and maybe I'm displacing some of my\nanger but I wasn't really traumatized\nand this is where we have to think a\nlittle bit about these trauma responses\nare not necessarily due to someone being\na prisoner of war or being physically\nabused in the household really the a\nthreshold for this trauma response is\nbasically you growing up in an\nenvironment where it was not safe to\nexpress anger and you ended up\ndisplacing it in other ways so if you\nhad super controlling parents if you had\nparents or other caregivers that really\ndidn't care about what you think and you\nweren't safely able to express your\nfeelings and the number for you know the\nnumber of people who fall under that\nthat category is actually way higher I\nstarted to see this in a lot of people\nthat were struggling with motivation and\nso the second thing to consider is that\nthis trauma response doesn't really\nrequire someone to have you know a\ndiagnosis of PTSD you don't have to be a\nprisoner of war or even have like\nphysically abusive parents really what\nengages this particular facet of trauma\nis simply growing up in an environment\nor being in an environment even today\nwhere you are not safely allowed to\nexpress your anger so it could mean\nhaving really controlling parents that\nif you talk back to them or you get\nangry three they punish you for anger it\ncould even be something like a work\nsituation where if someone treats you\nunfairly you're not allowed to talk back\nto them you're not allowed to even\ncontradict them you can even do it in a\nrespectful way but you still kind of get\npunished for it and the number of people\npeople that fall into this category is\nway higher and now what does this have\nto do with motivation if you look at the\ntrauma literature what you actually\ndiscover is that these people who are\nnot safely allowed to express anger also\nstruggle with motivation in the\nliterature specifically there's a term\ncalled the paralysis of initiation which\ntalks about how these people struggle to\nget tasks started and are motivated\ntowards completion and if we sort of\nthink about it and we start to\nunderstand okay what does anger do for\nus what does anger do to our brain this\nwill start to make a lot more sense so\nif we think about different emotions\nthere are some emotions that will lead\nto things like avoidance like fear and\nshame and there are some emotions that\nare actually motivating emotions and\nanger is kind of at the top of the list\nthere and you'll see this even if you\nlook at like media representations right\nso when you've got like the hero or\nheroine who's in this situation of\nInjustice where they're the good guy and\nthere's a bad guy and things are unfair\nwhat is their emotion that causes them\nto rise to the challenge what is the\nemotion that motivates them right I'm\nnever going to let this stand this is\nnever going to happen again I'm not\ngoing to take it laying down I'm gonna\nget pissed and so if we think about\nthese classically negative emotions\nwhich ones do the people who are heroes\nor heroines actually experience the most\nthey experience anger and that's exactly\nwhat anger is designed to do right so if\nwe think about it from an evolutionary\nperspective when I get pissed I'm\nwilling to put myself in dangerous\nsituations and the anger is what sort of\nconquers that fear and conquers that\nshame conquers that danger that's what\nreally allows me to be focused and sort\nof even fight with a tiger or a lion or\nengage in physical combat right because\nwhen do human beings fight they fight\nwhen they get pissed and so the really\ninteresting thing is that once we take\nthat anger and we're not able to channel\nit towards motivation and we're kind of\ndisplacing it to random strangers on the\ninternet we sort of lose that\nmotivational drive and you may sort of\nnotice this where where there are\nperiods in your life or situations in\nyour life where you know you should be\ndoing something right and you kind of\nfeel pissed off about it that you feel\nso incapable or you can't really stand\nup for yourself or you're unable to set\na boundary with someone and for some\nreason you're just anytime there's kind\nof this power Dynamic situation or\nyou're kind of struggling to like work\nup that internal motivation you don't\nreally know what to do and so what\npeople end up doing is they think that\nthis is related to willpower or I need\nto wake up earlier or I need to start\nthis new Tropic but fundamentally what's\ngoing on is this is actually a trauma\nresponse and so what I discovered\nworking with these people who you know\nget pissed off on the internet and\nstruggle with motivation is that\nfocusing on that trauma and letting them\nsort of healthily reintegrate anger into\ntheir lives allowed them to actually\nmove forward so the first thing to\nunderstand is whether you actually fit\ninto this pattern or not so ask yourself\na couple of questions like first\nquestion is you know do I feel angry at\ntimes in my life and I don't actually do\nanything about it if you sort of\nrecognize that that's the case there's\nanother interesting kind of diagnostic\nquestion that you can ask when I feel\nangry is there a part of my mind that\ntells me getting angry at this person is\ndangerous anger only causes you to mess\nthings up even further do you have a\nnatural reaction to anger that is\nactually fear so oftentimes with these\npeople experiences there's a spike of\nanger followed by a bigger Spike of fear\nand the fear kind of conquers the anger\nand then sort of tells you hey don't do\nanything about it right it warns it sort\nof creates some anxiety and then what\nyou end up doing is getting pissed at\nsomething on the Internet you open up\nyour phone you start scrolling through\nstuff and then you sort of click on the\nrage bait inducing stuff and if you\nreally pay attention to that pattern\nwhat you may find is that this time when\nyou're browsing the internet or social\nmedia your mind gravitates not towards\ncute cat videos but things that piss you\noff and so the next thing to kind of\nconsider is that if this sort of fits\nyou you can absolutely see a\ntrauma-informed therapist or someone\nwho's trauma informed and kind of work\non those motivational issues but the\nother thing that I would strongly\nencourage you to do is sort of start to\ndevelop that healthy relationship with\nanger and start by just noticing okay I\nfeel anger and I feel fear what is the\nfear telling me not to do and then take\na step back from those things maybe\nmeditate for a second and then ask\nyourself okay if someone else were in\nthis situation what would I advise them\nto do and then what you want to try to\ndo is come up with a plan that's sort of\nstatus classifies the anger but also\nsatisfies the fear and we don't really\ndo this because we just jump to\navoidance right but there may be some\nway to respectfully tell someone hey\nwhat you're doing is like actually a\nlittle bit unfair and the problem is\nthat your mind is going to be scared of\neven these situations because it learned\na long time ago that even respectful\ndisagreement leads to punishment but if\nyou're 10 years older 15 years older and\nyour situation is different you're not\nin that abusive household you're\nactually in a job where you know there's\nmore respect hopefully then you can\nactually try to Pilot some of those\ninterventions and this is exactly the\nkind of stuff that we try to teach\npeople when they come into coaching and\nstuff is how do you understand you know\nyour emotions and how can you sort of\nfigure out this middle path that is not\ngiving into your initial reactions but\nalso helps you move forward so I know it\nsounds kind of bizarre but we sort of\nthink about anger and as being in do by\nrage bait on the internet which is\nabsolutely the case there is a piece of\nRage bait there and we also think about\nmotivation is being related to dopamine\nand sort of Technology addiction and\nthere's absolutely a piece of that as\nwell but what I really discovered is\nthat there's a hidden link between these\ntwo things and it's actually a novel\nmanifestation of a classic trauma\nresponse\nforeign"
