    "transcript": "so if you're not ready to get\ndisciplined it's never going to work as\nlong as you're developing the discipline\nfor someone else and some of y'all may\nhave even grown up in situations where\nyour parents were very controlling right\nand they tried to instill discipline but\nif someone is forcing you to study or\nforcing you to work or forcing you to do\nanything that's not actually discipline\nit's actually the exact opposite because\nthese are external forces that are\ncontrolling your behavior the point of\ndiscipline is that it's an internal\nforce that overcomes your barriers and\nso this can be really confusing for a\nlot of people because even if they've\nbeen pressured and they've been\nsuccessful they can sometimes have no\ndiscipline at all and anytime they're\nleft to kind of self-start they struggle\nwith it"
