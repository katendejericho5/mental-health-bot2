    "transcript": "so the problem with the millennial\ngeneration is that we were sold a\nformula for Success that did not work so\nwhen I was growing up they all said go\nto college get a degree go to graduate\nschool you'll be special and then with\nthis thing behind you don't worry about\nstudent debt by the way with all the\nstuff behind you you're going to be\nsuccessful but what had happened is\neveryone had sort of figured out at\nleast in the U.S that everyone's going\nto college and everyone's taken out\nloans and 18 year olds don't understand\nthe value of a dollar so we're just\ngoing to keep on jacking up loans and\neducation prices and loans and education\nprices and they even passed legislation\nin the United States that you cannot\ndeclare bankruptcy and get rid of your\nstudent loans corporate malfeasance you\nran your bank into the ground you can\ndeclare bankruptcy commercial real\nestate you can wipe that debt clean baby\nlet's go you can wipe all the debt clean\nyou want except for student loans that's\nthe one thing we're going to saddle you\nwith no matter what and so this\ngeneration My Generation got screwed"
