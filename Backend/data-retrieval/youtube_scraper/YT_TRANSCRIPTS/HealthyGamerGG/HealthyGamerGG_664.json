    "transcript": "today we're going to talk a little bit\nabout wanting to become disciplined but\nnot being ready to\n[Music]\nI enjoy video games YouTube staying up\nlate and scrolling but I wish I was more\nresponsible and self-disciplined\nwhenever I think about changing myself I\nstart to think in a very serious mindset\nand I start to feel like I might lose\nall the fun and goofiness that I feel\nright now I know I have to change\nsomeday but I never feel ready and so\nthis is a really common problem that a\nlot of people face it's absolutely\nsomething that I struggled with myself\nand if we really stop and think about it\nwhy should we change right if you're\nliving a life today where you're\nenjoying yourself you're having lots of\nfun you're like waking up every day\nplaying video games I remember in my\ncase I was failing out of college but\nboy did I love every single second of it\nI'm waking up every day I'm playing\nvideo games I used to order fried rice\ntwo pounds at a time to save on delivery\ncosts and then I could fuel myself for a\n24-hour gaming binge and I was just\nhaving such a blast and so sometimes we\nkind of look at life and we start to\nthink to ourselves okay I should be\ndoing more right like at some point I\nneed to get disciplined I need to start\nworking I need to start exercising I\nshould be doing all this stuff but I'm\njust not ready to right I actually kind\nof enjoy my life and that can be so\nfrustrating but if we really sort of\nthink about it what's going on why is it\nso hard to become disciplined in the\nfirst place so let's play that tape\nthrough to the end so in your mind\nwhat's going on okay I should exercise I\nshould put my life together I should get\na job I should gun for promotion I\nshould go to graduate school why what's\nthe point of all that stuff so let's\nkind of think about it right okay so if\nI get a job then okay I'm gonna make\nmore money if I make more money I'm\ngonna work really hard I'm going to\ngrind I'm gonna spend all these years\nI'm gonna work 60 hours a week I'm gonna\nmake more and more money I'm gonna get\nmore and more promoted for what reason\nso I can retire early and then once you\nretire early what are you gonna do I'm\ngonna have fun well what do you enjoy\nwhat do you enjoy doing what's fun for\nyou it's playing video games and\nwatching YouTube and scrolling and just\nlike relaxing and chilling and not doing\nanything and this is a really common\nproblem we all struggle with sort of\nhaving things that we want but feeling\nlike we should be more disciplined so\nthis is the really wild thing thing\nright is we like kind of know we should\nget disciplined we know we should be\nstudying harder maybe applying for more\njobs gunning for promotion whatever but\nthe truth of the matter is that\noftentimes we're just not ready for it\nright we actually really enjoy our life\nright now so let's say that okay you did\nget disciplined right let's say you did\nit hey I'm gonna like wake up every day\nI'm gonna work out I'm gonna go to work\nearly I'm gonna be like grinding for\nlike you know I'm grinding at school I'm\ngonna get straight A's I'm gonna get\npromoted I'm gonna go graduate school\nwhatever you do that for a while you get\npaid more money right you get paid more\nmoney you grind you get promoted again\nand again and again and what's the point\nof working so hard so that you can\nretire early and let's say you make so\nmuch bank that you can retire early and\nthen what are you going to do with your\ntime well then I'm gonna have fun like\nokay so what do you what do you enjoy\ndoing well I enjoy playing video games I\nenjoy watching YouTube I enjoy like\nsitting around and scrolling on my phone\nand so then your brain is kind of\nthinking well hold on a second like if\nthe goal of grinding really hard is so\nthat you can retire early and have a\ngood time but what you do enjoy doing is\nlike actually sitting at home and\nplaying video games like why on Earth\nwould you go through all that trouble\nwhen you can actually do that right now\nbecause our brain has this like circuit\nthat constantly calculates the cost and\nbenefit of our actions so this is the\ncircuit that sort of tells us okay hey\nwe need to go to the bathroom now\nbecause we're going to be in the car for\nthree hours and going to the bathroom\nnow even though I don't feel like it\nit's going to cost me more down the road\nto go to the bathroom later than it\nwould to do go to the bathroom now so\nthis is a really basic circuit that like\nis integrated with all kinds of\nphysiologic signals like hunger and\nthirst and needing to use the restroom\nbut it also does things like abstract\ntasks right so it thinks about okay\nwhat's the cost of studying versus the\nbenefit of playing video games today and\nanytime you you're looking at that cost\nbenefit analysis that part of your brain\nis like why would one I want to grind\nwhen I and enjoy the rest of my life\nwhen I can just enjoy my life today I\ncan just have dopamine today I can enjoy\nmyself and it's going to be great and so\nthis is the really tricky thing is that\nyour brain is actually kind of saying\nand if you run really kind of think\nabout it right you say you're not ready\nto change yet which is a really really\ngood self-aware kind of statement and\nwhy because what's the point because at\nthe end of the day we're going to end up\njust doing this anyway and so how do\nhuman beings actually get disciplined\nright because when you've got the joy of\nDoom scrolling watching YouTube and\nplaying video games versus all of its\nhard work like what's it for and what we\nsort of discover is that there's one\nreally important thing that actually\ncauses human beings to be disciplined\nand that's something called a competing\ninterest and we know this because we've\ndone lots of research on people with\naddictions and I'd love to tell you all\njust a simple example of this okay and\nso I had this patient who had had a\nskiing injury and then started on opiate\nmedication and they had a genetic\nvulnerability to it so they got addicted\nto it super high functioning person\nreally really capable and so I kind of\ntold him I was like hey you know if you\nneed to withdraw if you need to get off\nof opiates like we probably need to like\nhospitalize you and like give you pain\nmedications and things like that but\nthey were in a situation where they\ncouldn't afford to do that if people\nfound out that they were getting\nsubstance use treatment their job would\nhave all kinds of problems and stuff so\nthey're like you know what I'm gonna do\nit cold turkey I'm going to do at home\nand the nice thing about opioid\nwithdrawal is that it's not as\nlife-threatening or medically dangerous\nas something like withdrawing from\nalcohol which can actually be lethal so\nthey just decided that they wanted to\nquit cold turkey\nand it was one of the most painful\nexperiences of their life and so if you\nkind of think about it how is a human\nbeing able to do that so if you think\nabout the discipline that's required to\nwithdraw off of opiates cold turkey or\nquit smoking or all these other kinds of\nthings right because if you think about\nall that stuff all these addictive\nsubstances what do they do they increase\nour enjoyment right they give us\ndopamine they give us all the stuff so\nhow is it that human beings are able to\npay that price and that's the problem\nwith not being ready for discipline is\nwe're not ready to pay the price for\ndiscipline we're not ready to pay the\nprice to get promoted to go to graduate\nschool to get in shape right we're just\nnot ready yet and so how do you become\nready you develop something called a\ncompeting interest and so what we learn\nfrom getting off of substances is people\nhave to have a good reason to do it so\nthey have to have something called a\ncompeting interest which is that I have\nto want something more than the pain of\ngetting off of this substance and so in\nyour life if you're not ready for\ndiscipline which you really need to\nfigure out is what is worth the pain to\nyou right and this is where we fall into\nanother trap this is why this problem is\nso common right now because right now\nwhere do our wants come from our wants\nand our desires come from the outside\nand if you're someone who's struggling\nto get disciplined because you're not\nready or you do it like kind of\nhalf-heartedly and then you give up\nwhere is your desire for discipline\ncoming from is it coming from in here or\nis it coming from societal expectations\nI should do this I should do this my\nparents are doing this my friends are\ndoing this and this is the problem is\nthat all that crap from the outside and\nour world is becoming more and more\nfocused on fulfilling like external\ndesires right now it's like we have\nadvertisements we have personalized\nadvertisements all these websites are\ntracking you right so they're telling\nyou all the time what you want so this\nthis game company is like hey you really\nwant this game and now if you kind of\nthink about it we have these like big\nlaunches for video games where like\nwe've got three trailer and there's so\nmuch hype and we have conventions and\nthey're like hey you want this game hey\nyou want this game and now all these\nlike streamers get early access codes to\ngames right so for like a year before\nthe game comes out the world is telling\nyou hey you want the stuff hey you want\nthis stuff and your parents are telling\nyou you should do this you should do\nthis your friends are telling you you\nshould do this you should do this you\nlook at everyone else around you and\neveryone's telling what you should do\nwhat you should want but none of that\nstuff is a competing interest because it\nall comes from the outside and so we as\na society have forgotten how to find\nwhat we care about so if you're not\nready to get disciplined it's never\ngoing to work as long as you're\ndeveloping the discipline for someone\nelse and some of y'all may have even\ngrown up in situations where your\nparents were very controlling right and\nthey tried to instill discipline but if\nsomeone is forcing you to study or\nforcing you to work or forcing you to do\nanything that's not actually discipline\nit's actually the exact opposite because\nthese are external forces that are\ncontrolling your behavior the point of\ndiscipline is that it's an internal\nforce that overcomes your barriers and\nso this can be really confusing for a\nlot of people because even if they've\nbeen pressured and they've been\nsuccessful they can sometimes have no\ndiscipline at all and anytime they're\nleft to kind of self-start they struggle\nwith it so what do we do about this the\nfirst thing is like I said acknowledge\nfor a moment that a lot of what you want\nright not not the games and stuff\nbecause that's actually what you want\nthat's how you want to spend your time\nwhich is why you move towards it right\nand that's also why you're willing to\nsacrifice things like external respect\nor money because you're actually\nfulfilling your own desires there so how\ncan we start to cultivate healthier\ndesires that sort of qualifies this\ncompeting interest that allow us to pay\nthe price to develop discipline so the\nfirst question that I have for you is\nwhat do you want and if your answer to\nthat question is I don't know then\nthat's a diagnostic sign that your mind\nhas been so clouded by external desires\nyou've been so influenced by advertising\nand personalized cookies that you don't\neven know what you want the world is\ntelling you what you want okay so then\nthe next question that we've got to ask\nyou is do you want to change and if you\nreally pay attention to yourself what\nyou may find there is actually you're\ngoing to say no I don't want to change\nyet I don't want to change now and then\nyou may sort of say well okay if I don't\nwant to change then I'm screwed right no\nno don't worry about it we're going to\nhelp you out so then there's one more\nquestion you can ask yourself do you\nwant to want to change do you wish you\ndid want to change and then you may find\na slightly different answer right\nchances are we're moving closer to yes\nand if the answer that question is yes I\nwish I was different I wish I wanted to\nchange so now we found something\nactually really really important even\nthough you don't want to change you wish\nthat you wanted to change and now we\nfound something the world is not telling\nyou that right the world is not telling\nyou hey you like need to change maybe\nthey are but they're not sort of going\none level above do you wish you were a\ndifferent person and that you wanted to\nchange and if the answer to that\nquestion is yes now we've got something\nreally important so usually when we\nthink about the person that we want to\nbe there's a laundry list of stuff I\nwant to exercise I want to eat healthy I\nwant to put more money in my savings\naccount I want to go to graduate school\nI want to grind more I want to write a\nbook there's this laundry list of crap\nokay that we come up with and what you\nwant to do is write that stuff down on a\npiece of paper and then go through it\nand then ask yourself okay is this\nsomething that I actually want or is\nthis some something that was instilled\nWithin Me is this a want that was\ntransplanted from advertising or\nparental expectations or societal\nexpectations or does this really come\nfrom me and what you'll find is that\nninety percent of the stuff on your list\ndoesn't actually come from you what\nyou're going to end up with is hopefully\none thing just start with one thing that\nyou actually want and if you can find\nthat one thing that you actually want\nstop and just like sit with that for a\nsecond and then what I really want you\nto focus on is try to do whatever you\ncan to start that thing in the smallest\nway possible think for a moment about\nthe person that you want to be not the\nperson that Society wants you to be how\ndo you want to be different and I'm not\nsaying giving up video games or YouTube\nor any of that stuff I'm saying like\nOkay so if you want to be a little bit\nphysically healthier then go for a walk\nevery day start with the smallest thing\ndo five push-ups do two push-ups do one\npush-up whatever that smallest thing is\ndo something pick something that you can\ndo and that you can actually be like\nsort of satisfied with yourself at the\nend right because now you're actually\nmoving towards something that you\ngenuinely want now if you try to do this\nyou're going to run into a pitfall and\nmaybe you're running into it already and\nthat Pitfall is but it's not enough so\nthis is where your mind is going to be\nsuper sneaky and it's going to tell you\nlike this doesn't make a difference\nbecause what difference does two\npush-ups make right we have all this\nlaundry list of things to do and so we\nhave to be really careful here and this\nis like so kind of twisty and sneaky\nthat it's easy to lose y'all so really\ntry to pay attention to this okay when\nyour mind tells you that the first thing\nis what is your mind telling you to do\nyour mind is telling you is trying to\nconvince you that you should want all of\nthis stuff because all of those habits\nor all those desires have been implanted\nwithin you right so it's kind of trick\nyou into telling you that this isn't\nenough the other thing that's really\ninteresting though is that when it tells\nyou those things what is it actually\ngonna trying to convince you to do it's\ntrying to tell you oh you can't just do\none percent you need to go a hundred\npercent or nothing because your mind\nknows you're not going to go 100 so what\nyour mind is actually doing in that\nmoment is trying to convince you to do\nnothing and just continue doing exactly\nwhat you're doing because it's doing the\ncost benefit analysis and it's kind of\nsaying hey actually we can get a ton of\nbenefit by just watching YouTube and\nplaying video games every day so don't\nbother with that other crap it never\nworks we've tried it before right and so\nwe know it's not worth it so you've got\nto be super careful about that Pitfall\njust notice what it's kind of trying to\naccomplish notice that it's kind of\ntrying to keep you stuck and the reason\nthat's kind of trying to keep you stuck\nbecause the mind does this really\ninteresting trick is that it convinces\nyou that you don't want to change that's\nwhat it's trying to do right saying it's\nnot worth it and if it's not worth it\nthen we don't want to do it and if we\ndon't want to do it we can continue\ndoing what we're doing so this is what's\nso tricky is that that that sort of lack\nof Readiness actually comes from the\nmind there's one Pitfall that we have to\nworry about though if you pick one thing\nand you start to do a tiny little amount\nthat is aligned with what you want your\nmind is actually going to try to pull a\nreally interesting trick on you the\nsecond you start to move forward with\nsomething that you want your mind is\ngoing to remind you of all the stuff\nthat you should be doing because it's\ngoing to get all tangled up and it's\ngoing to say you should be doing this\nyou should be doing this you should be\ndoing this so doing two push-ups a day\nor walking 15 minutes a day isn't going\nto be enough so it's interesting because\nthe second you start to develop forward\nmomentum the mind will actually trick\nyou by sort of telling you hey it's not\nenough and what your mind is going to\ntell you is that it has to be all or\nnothing and we can kind of see that in\nthe post and if you pay attention to\nyourself usually when you try to make a\nchange you try to overhaul your life so\nwhy does the Mind do this why does the\nmind tell you that it's all or nothing\nbecause the mind knows hey if I make it\nall or nothing this dumb ass is going to\nchoose nothing and if this person\nchooses nothing remember it's got that\ncost benefit analysis running if we\ndon't bother with all this crap what do\nwe end up doing instead we end up\nplaying video games we end up watching\nYouTube we end up scrolling we end up\nhaving a great time getting a ton of\ndopamine and by the way because we've\nalready done the calculation right so if\nwe start to do all of this catastrophic\namazing change we're going to end up in\nthis place anyway so I'm gonna I'm\nlooking out for you that's what your\nmind is saying I'm Gonna Save you all\nthe trouble and we're gonna jump right\nto the end of the movie right now we're\ngonna just retire right here right\nbecause if you're a degenerate who's\nplaying tons of video games and you\ndon't want to change what are you\nactually doing you're retiring at the\nage of 22 and who wouldn't want to\nretire at the age of 22. everyone wants\nto retire at the age of 22 and your mind\nis like hey you don't need to actually\nmake any money because this stuff is\ncheap there's free to play games we're\nactually set I'm going to help be retire\nright now all you need to do to retire\nright now is don't worry about all that\ncrap that you should do so I'm going to\nconvince you that you don't need to do\nany of it so you've got to watch out for\nthat Pitfall because it's waiting for\nyou and it's what's kept you stuck this\nentire time so just to kind of summarize\nit's really normal for us to enjoy the\nlife that we have right now because our\nsociety is designed that way right games\nare getting like more interesting when I\nwas growing up when I was like seven\nyears old eight years old you couldn't\ngame 24 hours a day because you had\nlimited access to games you had to go\nand buy a cartridge and put it into your\nNintendo Entertainment System you could\nplay that game for 20 30 hours and then\nyou're done and then there aren't more\ngames to play nowadays we have an\nendless amount of entertainment and then\nwhat we sort of tell ourselves is okay\nlike I should do all of this stuff right\nbut then there's a part of your brain\nthat's actually playing that tape\nthrough the end even if you haven't and\nit's saying okay why should we do that\nstuff so we can get more money why do we\nwant more money so we can retire early\nwhy do we want to retire early so we can\ndo what we want what do we want to do we\nwant to play video games why on Earth\nwhat I waste 30 years when I can\nactually jump straight to that right now\nand this is why we're not ready to\nchange the other thing to consider is\nthat if we really do want to develop\ndiscipline that comes at a cost right\nexercising eating healthy working hard\nthose come at very high costs so how is\nit that human beings develop the\ncapacity to pay those costs develop the\nwillingness to pay those costs that\ncomes from a competing interest and this\nis why things are so hard right now\nbecause it's so hard to know what you\nwant why is it hard to know what you\nwant because the world is brainwashing\nyou to want other things right but when\na video game company is trying to sell\nyou stuff they're thinking about their\nown interests they don't care about\nwhether you stay at home and you know\nbecome degenerate so our society has\nmade it so that we've forgotten or lost\nthe capacity to even know what we want\nand so start with that list of shoulds\nand parents can kind of do that kind of\nstuff too right where they tell you you\nshould look a certain way you should\nhave this kind of job in society\nInstagram and like all these other\nsocial media things magazines movies\nthey're telling you you should look a\ncertain way or dress a certain way so\nthey're shoving what you want at you but\nit's not really what you want it's what\nthey want you to want and so how do you\nget around that there's a really\nimportant question you can ask yourself\nis even if you don't want to change\ntoday so be honest with yourself do I\nwant to change no am I ready to change\nno do I want to become disciplined no so\nbe it do you wish you were someone that\nwanted to change and if the answer to\nthat question is yes then come up with a\nlist of all the crap that you should do\nand try to find a single thing that you\nactually care about and move one step\ntowards it but be careful because your\nmind will create a pitfall because it'll\ntell you it's not enough we have to do\neverything so be super careful about\nthat Pitfall of your mind really focus\non what you want and try to implement\nthe tiniest change possible\nthank you"
