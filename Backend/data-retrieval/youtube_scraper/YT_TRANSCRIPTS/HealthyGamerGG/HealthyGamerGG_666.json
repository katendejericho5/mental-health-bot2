    "transcript": "chat\nwelcome to another healthy gamer GG\nstream my name is alok kenoji just a\nreminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discussed on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if you all have a medical\nconcern or question please go see a\nlicensed professional\nso welcome everybody to uh another HG\nstream hope you all are doing well today\nhello hello hello\nso super hyped\num for not only today but this month\nwe're going to hop into a conversation\nwith Destiny in just a couple minutes so\num I really respect a lot of the work\nDestiny does I think uh he\nBoomer Echo\nhold on a second\nis that better\ntesting\nokay\nyeah I think it's better now okay\nfor some reason there was a a new source\nwhich should not have been there\num so a huge respect for Destiny and\njust I I appreciate the way he analyzes\nthings and his opinion on stuff\num it's not my place to pass judgment on\nwhether he is right or wrong but I\npersonally learn a lot from the way that\nhe thinks and the way that he represents\nhis views so we're honored to talk to\nDestiny today\num just a little bit about what's been\ngoing on and especially his thoughts on\nmental health and what's going on across\nthe world with mental health\nuh other things just to uh tune y'all\ninto so every year we do mental health\nMay uh is a way to try to help people\nwho are struggling with their mental\nhealth we try to raise awareness about\nparticular issues we try to understand\nokay what is the stuff that y'all are\ndealing with that is kind of Novel and\nthat you may not be able to get support\nelsewhere about so we tend to cover a\nlot of topics that\num\nthere aren't for example diagnoses about\nso like we talk a lot about burnout and\nimposter syndrome and things like that\nand this year we're going to actually be\nfocused on making uh about 12 to 14\nhard-hitting videos on topics that are\nreally really important to talk about so\nwe've already done a couple about trauma\num I think we're going to have a stream\non Friday that is going to be sort of a\ndeep dive into trauma so super\ninterested in doing this this is\nsomething that's been a little bit\ntricky because\na lot of times people will ask about\ntrauma in our community\nand Trauma is the kind of thing that I\njust don't think you can do like if I\nmean you can sort of do a 15-minute\nvideo on that and we can try to do that\nand we will be doing some of that but I\nthink trauma is definitely one of these\ntopics where a more comprehensive\nunderstanding is really important\num and then other things that we tend to\ndo you know we also will be innovating a\ncouple of things which is kind of what\nwe do so as problems that we face in the\nworld begin to change uh we think that\nwe need to adapt a change with them\nit's part of the reason that we have a\nstream right where we talk to people\nlike Destiny and we have things like a\nYouTube channel that has videos on\neverything from you know why do you get\nhigh and watch motivational videos on\nYouTube to why do I only why do I get\nthis burst of energy and motivation at\ntwo in the morning\nto more simple stuff like\num like more classic kind of mental\nhealth sort of stuff like what is\nborderline personality disorder how can\nI understand anxiety uh we should have a\nvideo coming out about like internet\nrage and motivation and how those two\nthings are actually linked and it's\nreally interesting what kind of science\nthere is behind that\nand then of course we have things like\nour coaching program and Dr K's guide\num so if y'all are interested in more\nComprehensive Mental Health resources\nthat are a little bit more uh\nlongitudinal and build on each other and\ndon't really fit the attention span of\nthe internet today definitely check out\nDr K's guide I explain a lot about how I\nthink about illness when I'm sitting\nwith a patient\num and then we've got\na coaching program that has now helped\nover 12 000 people in 119 countries and\nwhat we tend to focus on is things like\nfinding direction finding purpose\nfinding motivation overcoming some of\nyour bad habits and really trying to\nbuild a life that is worth living\nso uh yeah and the other thing is we're\ngoing to be kind of all over the place\nso we're not focused on one particular\nplatform or place I'm going to be doing\na fair amount of traveling for example\nover the month of May and we're going to\nsort of be trying trying to spread our\nmessage and raise awareness of the\nproblems that people face we'll be going\non everything from you know streaming on\nYouTube streaming on Twitch to going on\nvarious podcasts\num and even doing things like uh uh\ngoing to the National Conference of the\nAmerican Psychiatric association towards\nthe end of May where we'll be doing a\npiece over there\num so\nstay tuned and try to follow us around\nif you can and stay tuned to all of our\nstuff because we're not going to be like\nfocused on we're just going to do this\nthing this you know here all the time so\nyeah\nlet's see if we can hop in with Destiny\nI am going to\num does that\nlet me see if I can get this to work\nokay I have a new\nthing\nthat I'm trying to figure out how to use\nand let's see if I can get this to work\nso we're gonna do this\nyo dude can I have just one second to\nmake sure my overlays are functional\nokay you're still muted and I'm gonna\njust do that thank you so much so kind\nlet's see no no okay let me see if I can\nfigure out how to\num\noh no\n[Music]\num\nyeah I'm live but for some reason I\ncan't uh\nI can't show your video oh there we go\nokay I got it\nokay\nare you live\nokay\nso I'm gonna transition I think we're\ngood can you just count to ten for me\none two three perfect\ncool how you been man\nuh busy you know I see that yeah I've\nseen that you're out and about and doing\nall kinds of things and talking to all\nsorts of interesting people\num absolutely yeah I and I I really I\nlove the work that you've been doing man\nI I love listening to you the way that\nyou think about things the way that you\nframe things\num also the way that you stay on track\nwhen you're talking to people who may\nget off track\nthat I think is particularly impressive\nthank you yeah so a lot of a lot of\ndeliberate work and practices quantity\ntrying to keep conversations on track\nyeah yeah\num do you want to just tell us a little\nbit about what you've been up to and and\nuh\nyeah like how things are going for you\num\nI just it's everything I don't know I\nguess like in I guess for example when\nI'm doing in two weeks I'm going on some\n10 million Instagram crypto podcasts I\nthink in Vegas then I'm probably gonna\ndo a podcast today after Lily Pichu then\nI'm probably gonna do a podcast with\nchankweiger from The Young Turks and\nthen I'm probably gonna do um the\nwhatever podcast so it's just like\neverything I'm just yeah all over the\nworld right now that's what I'm doing\nyeah yeah awesome man\nyeah I think um\nyeah I don't know where you want to go\nwith this I can talk about a million\nthings for yeah so I'd love to hear just\nyour take on what's going on with mental\nhealth uh in America is a microcosm and\nalso across the world as a whole like if\nyou just have any thoughts about that\num\num yeah okay sure yeah um for mental\nhealth stuff\num there's always like four well hold on\nhow have you been doing I've been out of\nthe twitch world for a little bit so uh\nyeah so um I also you got like a new you\ngot a new background right now did you\nmove or yeah what's going on yeah so so\nuh we've been pretty busy and overall\nthings are going pretty well for the\nmost part I think um we've grown quite a\nbit I think one of the things that we\nsort of\nleaned into recently over the last year\nor two is like what is actually our\nmission and we're trying to help as many\npeople as possible with the emerging\nmental health problems that like people\nare facing\nand so uh over the last year year and a\nhalf I think interestingly enough a lot\nof what we've done has been offline so\ndoing a lot of stuff with different\norganizations\num like collaborating with with uh\ndifferent orgs kind of like Nami or\num even doing some stuff with the office\nof the U.S Surgeon General or uh doing\nstuff with the American Psychiatric\nassociation\num giving talks at places like\nuniversities in Spain and and places\nlike that so there's been a fair amount\nof travel as well and I think that and\nthen we've also sort of focused a little\nbit more on making content that's a\nlittle bit more like Library focused in\nthe sense that people can access it in\nthe future so I was running into this\nbig problem with live streaming where if\nI do a live stream today the people\ntomorrow may not learn from it right so\nI was we were getting the same questions\nover and over and over again so uh\nthat's sort of in a sense unsatisfying\nfrom a Content creation standpoint but I\nthink the bigger problem is that if we\nexplained something really well it was\nvery hard for people to find and so what\nthat sort of means is that we're always\naddressing the surface level issues\nwhich don't always help people\ngotcha and so for dirt stuff yeah\nno go ahead for deeper stuff for for\ndeeper stuff we kind of um\nso we've been a little bit more focused\non on making sure that our YouTube stuff\nis like more organized that people can\naccess things and then we've also been\nbuilding like different kinds of\ncommunity-based interventions\nso we're noticing for example that\npeople are having more difficulty\nsocializing and so if you're having\ndifficulty socializing\nwhat can you do about that this is the\nkind of thing where one solution is you\ncan go see a therapist and they can help\nyou with social anxiety but the other\nsolution is that you can like literally\npractice socialization\nso we had an event on Valentine's Day\nwhere like 300 people showed up and we\njust practiced asking each other out on\ndates\nbecause that's hard and one of the\ntrickiest things is that if you like\nsomeone\nand you ask them out on a date and\nyou're Rusty at asking people out on\ndates you kind of shoot your shot and\nyou're not\nwell practiced at it and then that\ncauses all kinds of consequences\ntrue can you um real quick just because\na lot of people spam this before we get\ntoo deep into this a lot of my people\nare saying that you have a weird echo on\nyour stream\nI have a weird act oh yeah you're right\nthank you\nI don't know why that happened but it\nshould be fixed now okay cool\num one of the things I was going to\ninteract with earlier is that uh it's\nkind of one thing that do you mind\nsaying how old are you real quick I'm\n40. you're okay I'm 34. um I never\nwanted to be this person and I hate that\nI'm becoming this person but I think I'm\nalmost full of this person suddenly I've\ngotten black pilled on on a lot of Life\ndevelopment is I'm starting to see the\nworld through the lens of age a lot more\nwhat do you mean it's in that like a lot\nof the energy that I get from people\neven from me earlier in my life was like\noh my God like I'm totally hearing you\nright now you're like a 23 year old male\nand a lot of what you're saying is like\nfiltered through that\num it's funny that you talk about how\nlike you're always addressing service\nlevel issues um and that you kind of get\nstuck in that sometimes but if you look\nat like probably the Advent of like hell\nhuman helping people\num so like the Tony Robinsons or back in\nthe days of [ __ ] Roman everything\nelse um like when people are trying to\nhelp help young men and everything it's\nprobably been like the same advice\nthroughout all of human history and it's\nnot like it's ever been like so old you\nknow like there hasn't been like this is\nthe master key of like how to develop\nand how to live your life perfectly and\nhow to figure all of your stuff out\nwe're still like you know thousands of\nyears into human development and it's\nlike how do I talk to a girl without\nfeeling shame of rejection or like\nwhat's an appropriate relationship to\nhave with a parent that like I don't get\nalong with like we have all of these\nfundamental questions that we're always\ndealing with through all of human\nhistory and it yeah it just seems like a\nlot of it is kind of the thing where\nit's like this is what you are you're\nborn as this person and you kind of deal\nwith these things as you get older and\num sometimes I wonder if we've like\nprogressed in terms of or it's just like\nfunny to to observe that like we kind of\nhave all the same issues we've been\nstruggling with like all people since I\nguess uh the Advent of like modern human\ncivilization\nyeah so uh do you think we've made\nprogress\num\nI don't think we focus on progress\nsomething we care about it too much\num I think we should but like um I think\nthat when you ask people like if we\nprogress to society usually the first\nthings people bring up are like well\nmedicine has gone a lot better\ntechnology has gone a lot better you\nknow we are microchips you know the\nnanometer fabrication process blah blah\nblah but then we have somebody what\nabout progress in terms of like having\nhealthy relationships or being able to\nresolve conflict with loved ones or how\nmany average friends do we have nobody\never marks progress that way and since\nSociety doesn't keep track of it and\nsince there's not like a paycheck for it\nI feel like sometimes no we don't\nactually care about it I mean it affects\nus but we don't seem to care about it\nlike we should you know that's so\ninteresting so I I kind of see why\nthat's black pilled sort of\num but you know my sense is that we\nactually have solved a lot of those\nissues you think so yeah\nlike what like what have we solved all\nof the things that you said\nso I know it sounds kind of weird but I\nI think this this this comes from maybe\nkind of a clinical perspective but I\nthink that you know when we're talking\nabout solving issues on a societal level\nI think one of the biggest things that\nwe sort of miss out on is that human\nbeings are individuals right and it's\nkind of like you can't just because\nsomeone ate a meal a thousand years ago\ndoesn't mean that a human being born\ntoday won't be hungry like in terms of\nhow to form healthy relationships how to\nfind purpose in life I think we actually\nhave a lot of really good Solutions\num it's almost like a biased way of\nthinking where in the west we tend to\nfocus on populations as our unit of\nstudy\nso from a population level have things\ngotten better and this is where I think\na lot of people will make arguments\naround medicine and stuff like that but\nI mean I think that you can look at you\nknow stoicism in the Roman era you can\nlook at\num stuff like uh\nyou know yoga and meditation and and\nEnlightenment and Buddhism and all this\nkind of stuff and I think even in terms\nof like forming healthy relationships I\nthink\nit's the progress is not on the human\nlevel although I think there is progress\nat the human level my experience has\nbeen that progress is actually like on\nthe individual level\nand so I guess when I was when I was\nthinking of that what I was more\nthinking of when I mentioned it through\nthe lens of age is it feels like\nregardless of how much progress we've\nmade as a society there's a lot of stuff\nthat you still have to like experience\nand then once you've had those\nexperiences it seems really hard to\nshortcut uh the learning thing without\nhaving the negative experiences first so\nI when I think back to I see there's a\nlot of young men online\num and I see it with myself a lot the\nidea that it's like you against the\nworld as an early person you don't care\nabout Connections you don't care about\nnetworking you don't care about bridges\nyou don't care about what people have\ndone before you're going to trailblaze\nyour own way and then through the\nexperience of doing that and making\nmistakes like eventually you kind of\nsettle in and you're like oh wait things\nare that way for a certain reason and\nmaybe it's better to kind of like\nunderstand how Society works and like\nkind of you know I can push a little bit\nbut like I need to have a better\nunderstanding of why things are the way\nthey are that like seems to be an early\nadventure for a lot of young men and I\ndon't know if there's like a way to\nshortcut that where it's like hold on\nwait you don't have to make all these\nmistakes just read this and then you\ndon't have to do this you know what's\nwhat's the value of shortcutting it\num well\nUnfortunately today the value is very\nhard to learn online because your\nmistakes are now immortalized uh in in\nin in a tangible fixed medium right so\nlike there are a lot of like if I would\nhave had the same growth I think I'm a\npretty good person I think I become a\nreally good person but if I would have\nhad that same growth 10 years yeah if I\nwould have the same girl 10 years later\nI would have never gotten to this point\nbecause I would have been destroyed\nmaking mistakes the mistakes that I made\n10 years ago would have been enough to\nlike be immortalized and that would be\nit that'd be my whole character\num I think we're very much judged by our\nworst moments online as like public\nfigures at least or even as like\nquasi-public reasons we have social\nmedia just unlucky and your particular\npost gets blown up it's really hard to\nhave those learning experiences\nyeah I mean it's weird but I I think in\na sense I think I sort of agree with you\nbut I kind of have a different kind of\ntake on it so first of all I think\nthat's the way it is\nyeah like I think there's something\nfundamental about being an individual\nhuman and the other thing that I I don't\nknow if this is going to make a whole\nlot of sense is that\nI think it doesn't matter how many\nmistakes you shortcut there's going to\nbe a barrier that you're going to make\nmistakes and have to overcome for sure\nright and like the\nif 23 year old Destiny was alive and as\na content creator today you would get\ncanceled so hard that you would never be\nyou know and I get that but I think\nthat's where like I personally like some\nof these lenses like Karma to sort of\nthink through that because I think it\nhelps me make sense of things from a\nnarrative perspective but the cool thing\nis that as a result of that you are able\nto do something unique today that no one\nelse can do which is you can sit here as\na 34 year old learn those lessons and\nthen pass that along to other people\nyeah yeah I try to yeah and I think that\nthis is where I'm with you that\ngenerally speaking we think about\nshortcuts or bypassing some kind of pain\nis like a good thing\num but I think no matter how many\nshortcuts you take you're going to hit\nsome kind of barrier and then at that\npoint there's going to be some amount of\nsuffering or mistakes or whatever\nand and that's where like I think at the\nend of the day the way to live life is\njust how do I manage being\nin how do I manage being imperfect when\nthe world expects success and Perfection\nand whatever yeah I mean I have one\nmillion percent agree like I wouldn't\ntrade my experiences for the world\nbecause I think that um there are just\nthere have been some things that have\nbeen granted to me through experience\nthat are so invaluable and I don't know\nif listening to other people without\nliving that would have given me the same\ntype of perspective so yeah because it's\nfunny because it reminds me of like I\nknow that growing up I had like my\nparents were kind of helicoptery you\nknow like they were always like don't do\nthat don't eat that no blah blah blah\nthankfully they were busy doing other\n[ __ ] so I could do crazy stuff but then\nas I got older I would always hear about\ncrazy stuff that they did as kids and\nlike man you guys are doing some wild\nstuff uh do you probably swear don't\nswear on this I'm sorry okay okay uh\nyeah they were all they were doing wild\n[ __ ] as kids and I hear about all these\ncrazy stories about him crashing you\nknow it was dad's motorcycle and you\nknow my mom you know running away at\nlike 18 to joined the Air Force Academy\nlike all these like crazy things like oh\nmy God and then as I grow up I see like\nall the crazy things that I did and like\nJesus and then even like when I'm\nrecounting some of these stories to\nfriends and we're like talking to show\nI'm like this is [ __ ] well like if my\nson was doing this I would kill him like\nwhat like what are you what am I even\ndoing\num but it's so much different now\nbecause now it's like there we it almost\nfeels like there's I don't know if it's\nlike a collective delusion but we all\nkind of like look at each other and\nwe're like we didn't do anything too\ncrazy uh but now that kids have like a\ncamera and a phone in front of every\nsingle thing now it's like oh my god get\nin that thing it's so horrible and it's\nlike yeah kind of but I mean like didn't\nwe all kind of do like really crazy\nstupid things you know like I had a man\nI had a thing I think it was like I want\nto see it was about a year ago where\nthese two people were writing a they\nwere writing a a kind of like a me too\nthing trying to take out some dude and\nit was like a 15 year old and a 17 year\nold and I was like oh my God like what\ndo you got like and it was because of\nlike messages that exchange it wasn't\neven anything sexual and I'm just like\nreading this and I'm like you guys are\nwriting like word docs on each other in\nhigh school what's happening right now\nlike and oh my God it's just yeah I\ndon't know sometimes it seems insane um\nthis is going to tie into our mental\nhealth stuff because I think social\nmedia is a huge part of what is like\nruining our minds today but like yeah\ncheese\nyeah dude that's a lot but I'm kind of\ncurious do you think that\nthe scale of mistakes that your parents\nmade versus what you made versus what\nyour your kids are going to make do you\nthink that scale has changed\nI think that there is a um\nI think there's like an and have you\never heard of the term Overton window\nit's like it's used to express like how\nlike what is the range of acceptable\npolitical beliefs in a country right so\nthe further right you are you'd say the\nOverton window goes over here for the\nleft yard goes over here I feel like\nthere's like an overted window of like\nmistakes and it feels like it's gotten\nnarrower and narrower and narrower to\nwhere like when I think of the types of\nmistakes like my grandparents made it\nmight be like they tried cocaine when\nthey were 17.\num or they were like in you know my\ngrandpa was in Vietnam and now when I\nthink the mistakes my parents made you\nknow it was like they crashed a car\nwhile drunk driving at 19 and the only\nthing I'm mistakes that I made it was\nlike trying to get a friend to push my\ncar with his car to like a repair shop\nlike and then when I think the mistakes\nlike kids today make it's like um like\nyou looked at like an Andrew Tate video\non your Tick Tock in class and it feels\nlike the range of mistakes is getting\nnarrower and narrower which I think\nprobably doesn't accurately account for\nthe totally like human experiences like\nyou want to have like this range but it\nfeels like the acceptable range of\nbehaviors has gotten a lot narrower and\nthere's less room for mistakes what it\nfeels like you know not to say when I\nsay these things also is a real thing\nI'm not excusing those things they're\nsaying it's okay but like so for\ninstance when I hear like there was a\nreally big thing I think that in getting\nAndrew Tate banned was a teacher saying\nlittle boys are making fun of little\ngirls in class because of Andrew Tate\nstuff and I see that and I think little\nboys shouldn't be making fun of little\ngirls that's wrong but little boys when\nI grew up always made fun of little\ngirls and you're not supposed to and you\nget in trouble for it but then like we\nsee that I think people like oh my God\nis this like a new thing I'm like well\nno probably not like I went to grade\nschool we all made fun of each other\nsaid horrible deplorable things about\neach other but I was like part of like\ngrowing up and learning what you can and\ncan't do you know yeah so I I love\ntalking to you man sure so so I would\nagree that I think society as a whole is\nbecoming less tolerant\nso I've noticed something that I I think\nis related to a lot of the mental health\nproblems that that we have today which\nmaybe is a hot take or unpopular opinion\nbut one thing that I'm noticing and this\nmaybe has to do with some of the the\nyoga training and stuff like that is\nthat\nI've noticed that even in in the window\nof my clinical practice so I probably\nsaw my first patient in 2010 2011 is a\nmedical student and in the last 13 years\nwhat I've noticed is that\nwe as a society are seeding control of\nour mental well-being to other people\noh\nand and what I'm noticing is that if\nsomething upsets me the default position\nwhen I was growing up was\nhow to take care of yourself how to\ndefend yourself whereas now I think what\nwe're seeing more and more of is if\nsomething is hurtful to me that person\nneeds to stop which I'm also with you\nthat I I don't think that they're\nthey're good reasons to impose\nboundaries on people who are abusive and\nstuff like that and I think that's like\na big thing that I work on with patients\nand stuff like that but I think in\ngeneral it's kind of interesting because\nwhat we've almost done is when when we\nsort of say okay like you need to stop\nsaying these things because I find them\nhurtful what we're actually doing is\ngiving that that person power over our\ninternal tranquility\neven like as a formal part of our\ntraining as psychiatrists is to\nacknowledge that okay if you're dealing\nwith someone who says something that\nhurts you that could be a consequence of\nlet's say them being high on K2 or in\nthe midst of a manic episode so we\nliterally train ourselves to be somewhat\nresistant to\nxicity like it's a part of the job and\nwhat I'm noticing is that that skill is\nuseful for all human beings how can I be\nsecure in who I am how can I develop\nself-esteem to where if someone says\nsomething negative about me\nthere can be things that they're saying\nthat are toxic and abusive and need they\nneed to be held accountable for but just\nbecause they need to be held accountable\nthere's a there's a gap between that and\nhow much I am able to\nbe sort of protected or defended against\nthat toxicity and Society is definitely\nmoving in the direction of if someone is\ndoing something wrong we need to get\nthem to stop it as opposed to I need to\nbe better at handling it\nyeah there's\num this ties in I think really well I\nwas just on a podcast with a guy called\nChris Williamson have you ever heard of\nhim yeah I was on this podcast recently\ntoo okay awesome cool okay yeah\num cool they just had it talk and I I\ntalk about one of the challenges of\nthere are two concepts that I try to\nmarry personally and then when I talk to\nother people and these two concepts are\none is the analysis of classes and\npeople at a societal level and then two\nis the analysis of an individual\nwhen I'm giving prescriptions or if I'm\ntalking about like what do we need to\nchange in society you know it's going to\nbe things like what kind of government\nAid is available what kind of programs\nare available to help children stay out\nof trouble you know what it's it's it's\nlike class-based things for large groups\nof people because that's for at the\nsocietal level that's all we can really\nanalyze you know I can't give you a\ndifferent prescription for 340 million\npeople\nbut when I talk to an individual my\nadvice is going to come off as like I'm\nthe most Libertarian anarcho-capitalist\nperson ever my advice is going to be\nfigure out what you need to do you're\nthe only one that cares about yourself\nas much as you do you can advocate for\nyourself better than anybody else can\nand you know you know yourself about\nanybody else and you have to figure out\nwhat you can do to make the most of like\nany bad situation and it seems really\ndifficult for people to marry either of\nthese points without getting totally\nlost down one side\num to tie in oh I I think I can make\nthese analogies for you because you're\nyou're the gamer guy\num in League of Legends okay which I\nthink unfortunately you have personal\nexperience with right or she played\ndonut yeah but I played League okay sure\nall right it's all the same toxic\nhorrible stuff okay in League of Legends\nokay one of the worst and most horrible\nthings you can do when you get into a\ngame and you're losing is to always\nblame your teammates right you can't\ngive up all of your agency to your\nteammates even if it was the case even\nif it was the case that it was an\nunwinnable game what a good player will\ntell you is they'll say listen even a\ncase of unwinnable games just control\nwhat you can right if your team is\nlosing you know try not to die as much\nif you're a partner in Lane stocks try\nto see us well and you know don't get\nganked um you know if you're a carry you\nknow try to at least have a positive KDA\nright you try to control what you can\nbecause that at the end of the day\nthat's all you can do\nand we know that for games if you blame\nyour teammates constantly of course\nyou're you're never going to improve as\na player\nbut then we step off the rift and then\nwe come into real life and there's value\nin analyzing things as being white\nsupremacists or as being uh patriarchal\nbut like if you inundate somebody\nthroughout their entire life with this\nidea that everybody's racist against you\neverybody's sexist against you\neverybody's bigoted against you if you\nlose that in Opportunities because of\nyour skin color it's because of your\nrace because of your backgrounds of your\nclass how are you not destroying that\nperson's ability to develop any sort of\num tenacity to deal with adversity in\nthe world or to take responsibility and\nand fight against things even if it is\nunfair you know because I think that\nonce you put a person in that in that\nmindset you know they're going to spend\ntheir entire life thinking like well why\ndidn't I get a gank well why didn't my\nsupport do this well why didn't I get\nhired for that job well why didn't the\nteacher give me the same grade as him\nwell why is my carry always right you\nend up like blaming everything around\nyou yeah and that trying to marry those\ntwo concepts together is really really\ndifficult for most people and then when\nI start giving advice on one out of the\nother people always attacking their\nSaddles like listen free meals for kids\nin schools is a no-brainer in the United\nStates people say oh you don't think\nparents should take any responsibility\nfor their kids like I never said that or\nif I say things like yeah if you're a\nparent and you got to work two jobs and\ntake care of kids work two jobs have\nlike oh so you don't think food stamps\nare okay I was like well no of course\nthey are but like uh it's such a\nfrustrating thing to deal on on both\nends of that issue it's been on such a\nhard time dealing and and marrying both\nthose Concepts yeah yeah I mean I I\ncompletely agree with you I think my\nexperience has been a little bit\ndifferent just I think this may have to\ndo with the nature of interactions that\nwe have but you know there's a there's a\nreally interesting I think marriage of\nthat that we sort of do routinely in in\nPsychiatry which is\nmental health mental illness is not your\nfault but it is your responsibility\nyeah that's a hard one yep right so this\nis where kind of the acknowledgment and\nthis is so hard and this is it's so\nchallenging because sometimes what will\nhappen is I'll have you know a patient\nwho's in a relationship\nand and the patient may have let's let's\nsay something like bipolar disorder or\nsomething that's a little bit more on\nthe severe end\nwhere the bipolar disorder does make the\nrelationship objectively harder there\nare factors there are factors outside of\nindividual control that stack the deck\nagainst you\nand at the same time just because you\nhave bipolar disorder or you have an\naddiction or something like that there\nare some things that are stacked against\nyou but what I find is that the people\nwho ultimately get healthy\nare the ones who are able to acknowledge\nthat the deck is stacked against me and\nalso that I have some degree of control\nbecause I think what we sort of do when\nwe say societally like there's all kinds\nof discrimination and call it whatever\nyou want to that exists that's real\nand at the same time as an individual\nyou have to live within this world and\nas you kind of said I don't know that\nSociety is looking out for you so the\nsad thing is that you have to kind of\nlook out for yourself and I think\nthere's a really important kind of like\ngrieving process and stuff like that\nacceptance process where I've worked\nwith people who have been\nyou know just filled with regret that\nthat the deck was not stacked in their\nfavor or that there are people who get\nyou know the Dex act in their favor in\nparticular ways and and I've seen people\nwho kind of stay stuck there and they're\nthe ones that don't accept and I've seen\npeople who are able to accept and sort\nof acknowledge that okay even though\nit's not fair that I ended up with\nbipolar disorder it's not my fault\nthere's a genetic predisposition at the\nsame time if I want to live the kind of\nlife that I I want to live I have to\ntake some responsibility over it\nand usually so I I would almost say that\nmy day job is oftentimes trying to get\npeople to like marry those two concepts\nyeah which is really hard\num because people tend to think in terms\nof black and white and I tend to find\nthat it's hard to get people to accept\npersonal responsibility when they are\nfilled with negative emotion for sure\nyeah actually there's a sequence of\ndecompressing emotion leading to\nacceptance and then you can start moving\nforward yeah that's like a it's a that's\na debate strategy it's a relationship\nstrategy it's probably a therapist\nstrategy that if somebody's in a\ncompromised state of mind you're past\nthe point of ever getting them to agree\nwith you I I can't do it I'm even aware\nof it and I can't do it if I'm heated I\nknow I'm not going to listen to reason\nand I'll usually say listen can we yeah\nlet's reconnect or let's talk about TV\nshows because like if I'm heated right\nnow you can tell me two plus two equals\nfour and I'm gonna die on the hill that\nis five you know\num one of the uh do you know Brittany\nSimon is a YouTuber nope oh okay she\ndoes like um kind of like life coaching\nstuff sometimes she she's the only\nperson I've met who is such a rare thing\nI'll hear people say things like I can't\ndo this because of my ADHD or I have um\nI've got borderline so I can't do this\nshe's one of the only people I've heard\nsay I have this thing and because of\nthat I do this to like alleviate it or\nbecause of that I do this I like it when\npeople like have a recognition of like I\nhave like instead of saying like I have\nADHD I can't do that so I'm also like oh\nI have ADHD so if I'm gonna do that I\nneed to make sure that like I you know I\ndon't have a computer next to me or I\nneed to leave my phone in the other room\nright um it's that like you recognize\nthat you have some mental thing going on\nand then because you recognize it like a\nmedical diagnosis you don't just use\nthat as an excuse to do nothing you use\nthat as like a path forward to like\nbecause I have this thing I'm going to\nchange my behavior accordingly yeah so I\nthink that that's great\nin theory and I advocate for that as\nwell but I think there's a there's a\nthere's an element there that I\npersonally think could be missing in\nsome of those cases so especially if you\nlook at something like ADHD the reason\npeople say I have ADHD therefore I can't\ndo it is not actually a shortcoming on\ntheir response on their part it's\nactually a learned behavior so when you\nhave ADHD\num\nand you exist within a system that\nassumes neurotypical kids you discover\nvery quickly like this is a truth that\nADHD makes things impossible for me\nthat's a lesson so if you look at this\nreally interesting research if you look\nat a comorbid population of people who\nhave depression and ADHD so if we take a\nsubset of people who have both diagnoses\nif you're if you get diagnosed with\ndepression first\nyou have a three percent chance of\ndeveloping ADHD okay\nif you get diagnosed with ADHD first you\nhave a 70 chance of developing\ndepression so there are studies that\nshow that by the second grade the\nmajority of kids with ADHD will not get\ninvited to a single birthday party so\nwhat happens with these kids is that\nthey go to school and they recognize\nthat I am just as smart as my friends\nbut they are not able to perform in\nschool in a way that is anywhere near\nthem and so what tends to happen is that\npeople will sort of discover this truth\nthat and and this is almost protective\nright because if I have ADHD and I\npretend like I don't I'm just gonna get\nburned\nand so oddly enough the helplessness and\nthis is there's a ton of research on\nthis\nthat you know I think that helplessness\ncomes out of that and I think if someone\nis saying I have ADHD\ntherefore I do it this way\nthat person has had a life in which they\nwere able to learn or someone supported\nthem in learning and this is a really\nwild thing about ADHD is that those\npeople who feel they're helpless I think\nit's completely correct and completely\nwrong because once they're given because\nbecause you can't figure it out or very\nfew people are able to figure it out on\ntheir own when there's a system that is\naligned with one way and you you don't\nfit into it like it's really hard to\nfigure that out you have to be\nincredibly resilient incredibly lucky\nhave someone who really like shows you\nthe way\num and then usually what we tend to find\nis that if you actually do like\nPsychotherapy for people with ADHD they\ncan get substantially better and even be\nin remission the interesting thing is\nthey're not really in remission their\nADHD is completely active and is\nactually sort of the same they've just\nlearned all the compensatory mechanisms\nto which they have no more impairment to\nfunction or completely functional within\nSociety\nso I'm with you that you know I I think\nthat having bipolar disorder or\num having ADHD or any kind of you know\naddiction or trauma or whatever\nnecessitates\na different strategy of how to live your\nlife and I'd even go as far as to say\nthat you don't even need a mental\nillness for that I think that every\nhuman being has a unique cognitive\nfingerprint and success and happiness in\nlife is in figuring out okay what is my\nunique cognitive fingerprint and how do\nI play this game of life\nyeah have you ever heard of the phrases\num or the term stress versus eustress\nyeah yeah I think it's kind of like that\nit's the idea that um it took me a long\ntime to figure out why stress was such a\nmotivating factor for me but it's always\nbecause I felt like when I'm when I'm\nconfronted with a stressful thing it's\nlike a challenge and I feel like I got\nthe tools to overcome it uh for whatever\nreason so these things end up becoming\nuh you know like an impetus for me to\neither improve or succeed but for a lot\nof people to feel like they don't have\nthose tools those types of stressful\nthings just become kind of a horrifying\npit of despair that they feel like they\ncan't do anything about and they're just\nkind of like you know put their head\ndown and they have nowhere to like work\ntheir way through it yeah there's a\nreally great uh exploration I forget who\nthe the psychiatrist is who kind of\ndeveloped this concept but he talks\nabout active challenges versus passive\nchallenges and how that relates to you\nstress versus distress so just to kind\nof take a step back we sort of know if\nyou look at like scientific studies of\nthe Flow State\nif something if the challenges that you\nface are too easy you will get bored and\nyour performance will drop if the\nchallenges that you face are\noverwhelming\nyou will get overwhelmed so it at the\ntop end of the challenge curve and at\nthe bottom end of the challenge curve\nboth of those cause a decrease in\nperformance and in that middle Zone that\nis the zone of you stress where you're\nyou're kind of challenged sufficiently\nto where you actually perform the best\nthe really interesting thing is that\nwhat oftentimes overwhelms people is\nwhen the challenges that they face are\nnot challenges that they choose so an\nactive challenge is something that you\nchoose to engage in which is difficult a\npassive challenge is something that is\nthrust upon you which is difficult\nand when your life is one where passive\nchallenges outweigh active challenges it\ntends to lead to overwhelming uh feeling\noverwhelmed and like stopping action\nit's very hard to motivate yourself\nyou're kind of getting bodied by life\nwhereas so it's really interesting but\none sort of solution to anxiety or\nfeeling overwhelmed in life is to\nactually challenge yourself more and\nthen there's really an interesting\nequation where once active challenges\noutweigh passive challenges once the\nhard things that you do in life\nthe hard things that you do in life are\nmore based on your choice the more\nmotivated and successful you become\nyeah and that makes a lot of sense I\nguess when I compare like um your life\nas a streamer or YouTuber compared to\nyour life working like at McDonald's\nlike technically my life now is way\nharder than the service jobs that I\nworked in the past but like the\ndifficulties are welcome right I would\nrather be thinking of like what are the\n15 different challenges I've got today\non stream rather than like the more\nsimple and less arguably less\nchallenging level like today is my 700\n100th day you know working at McDonald's\nor a carpet cleaning job or Casino\nservice job or whatever so yeah\nyeah I mean I think it's kind of bizarre\nbut you know I'm very lucky to have the\njob that I have today and people usually\ntalk about medical residency is like a\nvery very difficult period because\nyou're working a lot of hours and and\nyou're kind of at the bottom of the\ntotem pole and things like that but I\nfind it's really bizarre but but I I\nreally think that in some ways my my job\ntoday and this may get me canceled is in\na lot of ways like much harder than it\nis in residency\nand and I think there are just some\nthings about being responsible where the\nnice thing at least about residency are\nthings that are objectively more\ndifficult is that we had certain safety\nnets which I feel like we don't have\nright so when you're by yourself kind of\nlike you're sort of alluding to if you\nscrew up there's no one there to pick\nyou up and consequences or Consequences\nand there's no safety net and so I I\nthink I'm with you 100 that and this is\nwhat we see in residency as well which\nis why like people are so burnt out is\nbecause they have tons of passive\nchallenges they have all these things\nthat they have to do that are completely\nout of their control yeah and since [ __ ]\nrolls downhill people in residency are\nsuper burnt out because they're the ones\nthat have to deal with it\nyeah that makes sense yeah\num I think you would say you had said\nsomething is going to relate to well I'm\na little bit curious let's talk about uh\nyou said something about as you're older\nyou've gotten a bit black pilled can you\ntell me what you mean by that I wasn't\nquite sure it was like a half ironic\nstatement what I'm saying is best that\nlike it feels like there is I hate this\nbecause there's still like a younger 20\nyear old guy in me that's screaming not\nto be a solid loser but it feels like as\nyou get older there really are a lot of\nthings that you learn with age in terms\nof like your temperament changes\num the importance of\num I guess synergizing with the social\nsystems around you becomes more apparent\num and there's kind of this like\nespecially me as a streamer especially\non the Forefront of whatever the hell it\nis I do um there's like this balance of\nlike like how much am I trying to push\nagainst societal Norms versus how much\nam I trying to appeal to societal norms\nand like what's the correct balance of\nthat\num and then what is like am I making a\nworthy decision that is like\nresembling some inner value system I\nhave or am I just doing something\nbecause I'm like being lazy or spiteful\nor like it's very very hard to start and\nthen while you're doing all of this\nthere's no like there's not like a\nblueprint right there's not like uh this\nis how you become a influential\nsuccessful because it's like not it's\nnot I think very many people do um and I\nimagine even for individuals in their\nlives it's always hard to figure out\nlike how much is being true to yourself\nversus what's being a sellout you know\nhow much do you want to keep it real\nversus how much do you want to suck it\nup and you know whatever\num yeah that's just like a it's a\nprocess that I'm finding more and more\nas you get older like when I talk to\nother people that are 30 plus I'm like\nokay we're on the same page for this and\nthen when I talk to a lot of people that\nare like 22-23 I'm like okay I\nunderstand what you're saying and I'm\nhearing you and I don't think I can\ncommunicate with you right now but I\nthink in like 10 years you're going to\ncome back to this conversation and go oh\n[ __ ] I should have realized this thing\nit feels like age is like a pretty\nimportant thing in like getting enough\nexperience and maturing you in certain\nways what I'm saying what kinds of\nthings would you in this kind of\nhypothetical I'm just curious what kind\nof thing would you hear from let's say a\n23 year old that you think that\nthey wouldn't be able to\nlisten to what you're saying\num I feel like when you're younger I\nfeel like there's a goal to reinvent the\nwheel on everything so it might be\nsimple right now you hear a lot from\ncertain communities for instance that\nlike college is a horrible idea don't go\nto school that's for losers work on\ne-commerce and Drop Shipping and I think\nit's attractive because it's like the\ninternet is still kind of new like I can\ncarve my own way like school is for\nlosers it's a lot of debt\num and then maybe you know over some\ntime you realize like okay well maybe I\nshould have spent some time building a\nreliable skill that's marketable that I\ncan get paid for and maybe this was a\nmistake and I didn't realize it and\nthere was a reason why you know the\nmeeting earnings for somebody with a\nfour year degree or Twenty Thousand a\nyear higher than the meeting earned\nsystem with only a high school degree\nand I just didn't really realize it at\nthe time because I felt like I was ready\nto fight the world and everything didn't\neverything was dumb the way that we saw\nbefore\num so like maybe feelings of college\nmight be one thing\num maybe uh approach to relationships\nmight be another thing\num some people early on can have\nstandards that are way too high for\nrelationships I'm gonna find a guy or\ngirl that only does exactly what I want\nthem to do and I'm not going to accept\nanything less than that sometimes\npeople's standards are way too low I've\nhad a lot of abusive Partners but maybe\nit's my fault because of the way that I\nam and I just kind of like you know my\nparents were nice to me you know this\nguy's a nice man it's just life right so\nlike balancing out those things\num so School relationships uh\nprofessional courtesy like how we treat\nbosses and co-workers like I do better\nwork than them so I don't care if I\ntreat my coworkers like [ __ ] I'm better\nthan them who cares versus getting older\nyou're like okay well regardless of how\nI feel about my co-workers I see them\nevery day and my boss is going to see\nhow I treat co-workers and how I work\nwith people might be the determining\nFactor on if I get a raise or a\npromotion not how well I do my job\num those are like three things I guess\nyou kind of like learn we can focus in\non any area you want but yeah there's\nlike a lot of things that as you get\nolder like okay I understand why this is\nwhy why it is and I wish I would have\nlearned this a little bit earlier but\nyou kind of realize as you get older\nyeah yeah I mean that all sounds like\nlearning the lessons of life and growing\nup yeah yeah yeah yeah you know I guess\nwhat I'm thinking is I wish it's like oh\ncool I'm 20 can I just like absorb this\nknowledge from somebody so I don't have\nto be a dick to my co-workers be in\nshitty relationships and you know do\nstupid things with school like um it's\nso funny like I tell people and I I\nthink most other successful people real\nsuccessful people not crypto\nmillionaires most other successful\npeople I talk to realize this like one\nof the it's such a stupid like almost\nthrowaway piece of advice but like if I\ncould if I could impart one piece of\nwisdom under myself as a young person\njust one thing that I can share my whole\nlife just spend 30 minutes a day more\nstudying that's it just the one thing\nprobably would have changed my whole\nlife well probably in the worst because\nI got lucky but like I would have done\nso much better at school so much better\nin college so much better like\nprofessionally for just 30 minutes a day\nstudying in school like that would be\nlike one super simple thing but it feels\nlike it took me a lot of life experience\nto learn something like that you know\nI'm I'm tempted to ask you a personal\nquestion I go knock yourself out\nwhatever you want I mean so so you know\nI'm just curious about how you you're\nyou're thinking about this thing and I'm\nwondering like are you terrified that\nyou're gonna have to oh 40 year old\nStephen or 45 year old Stephen is going\nto be looking back and thinking\noh like what are the mistakes that I\nmade now\num yeah kind of but like this is a this\nis one of those uh balancing acts so on\none sense you know people ask me\nsometimes my fans will be like oh like\nyou should write a book on something\nit's like why would I put anything I\nbelieve right now onto paper when in\nthree years I'm probably gonna think\nabout everything I was you know stupid\nso in one sense yeah I kind of think\nabout that\num but then in another sense I would\nthink if I looked back five years from\nnow and I was the exact same person I'd\nbe worried that I'd stop growing you\nknow that would be a concern of mine so\nwhat I what I the way that I try to\nthink right now is I I only want to take\na strong position on something that I\nfeel incredibly grounded in and for\neverything else I just want to leave\nmyself open to change so there are there\nare like I think there are like four or\nfive like things politically where it's\nlike these are things that are true and\nI'm probably never gonna move off these\nand I never have\num but for everything else I I try not\nto be so merry like I'll try to Cavite\neven I feel like you know socialized\nmedicine is very important in the United\nStates we need this you know unless\ntheir studies showing otherwise right I\njust I try to try to get my mind open so\nI'm like open to change in the future\nyeah\nbut what's what's the Dow I mean so\nit sounds like you're reluctant to write\na book because something will be set in\nstone\nI feel like a lot of people when I see\nso I've existed on the internet for like\n13 years now\num and and I think part of my continued\nsuccess is that I'm able to kind of like\nadapt and change it's like society and\ntime goes on while still holding on to\nsomething that is important or something\nthat makes me me I'm not just like new\narea totally new person but there's\nstill like that core thing of me there\nand then there's moving through time\num something that gets scary for me is\nI'll see especially because I do\npolitical stuff right I'll see political\nfigures that have been in a polit like\nif you joined a political org and then\nyou've got a stake on that political org\nand then you start doing content without\npolitical org you have it feels like\nyou've robbed yourself of the ability to\ngrow right like let's say tomorrow\num Ben Shapiro wakes up and he has an\nepiphany and he's like you know what I\nactually think that government\nentitlement programs and Welfare are\nprobably one of the most important\nthings in the United States could he\neven say that publicly it would probably\ndestroy him to do it\num would he even be able to feel that\nthere's probably some degree of\nideological and audience capture going\non where it's like well I'm a\nconservative I don't know if I should\nthink that this is probably wrong I'm\nstupid like my audience is going to hate\nme for it\num so yeah that's that's something that\nI kind of I see some people who will\nlike I am the Socialist I am the\ncapitalist I am the libertarian and then\nthey get so locked into that phase that\nthey've robbed themselves of even have\nthe opportunity to grow change as I get\nolder\nuh so I politics is not my area of\nexpertise but I'm really curious so I\nheard about this tweet that Ann Coulter\ndid where she was like talking about\nabortion rights or something I don't\neven know the details it's like third\nhand do you know what I'm talking about\nno but I've probably seen it as Ann coul\ntournaments about abortion what do you\nthink it says\num well I I mean she was like she was\nthe original staunch like lady kind of\nlike [ __ ] conservative lady so I\nimagine for a long period of life she\nwas Ultra super against it has that\nopinion changed recently or\nyeah\nI'm just I'm Googling this now to see\nwhat it is sorry I don't know why I'm\nGoogling you could just tell me yeah I\ndon't know the details of what she said\nbut she was talking about how like this\nis like where abortion the Restriction\nof abortion rights in America has like\ngone too far or something I don't know\nwhat the oh I just saw this on April 5th\nshe said please stop pushing strict\nlimits on abortion or there will be no\nRepublicans left is it this tweet yeah I\nthink I probably what do you think about\nthat\num I think it's absolutely true I've\nalways said that there are like I think\nthat there are two big issues that um\nthe political parties have right now\nwhere if they could just loosen up on\nthem they would get a whole bunch of\nfollowers for Republicans I feel like\nthey need to drop the ultra strict\nabortion thing and just concede that\nlike abortion from like first trimester\nat least is okay and it would just open\ntheir base up so much and for Democrats\nit's the obsession over guns they just\nneed to like leave the AR-15s alone\nthey're you they're very sparingly used\nin shootings and it would open them up\nto a whole bunch of like new people but\nthose are like two issues that both\nsides are really dug in on and they lose\nI think a lot of political Capital over\nboth of them yeah but the abortion thing\nis a really big one for republicans and\nit like motivates the hell out of\nDemocrats to go to the polls and vote\nall right so what do you think about her\nkind of saying well her more recent\ntweet\nwell I mean that just sounded like\npolitical strategy to me I don't know if\nthat was like reflecting like personal\ngrowth you know\nwell so because because what I'm kind of\ncurious about is why do you think that\npolitical parties can't grow right\nbecause you're sort of saying if you\njoin a\nif you join let's say like a a\npolitically oriented content creation\nengine\nthat that sort of staunches your growth\nwhereas one of the things that I've been\nsuper curious about is like why can't\npeople change their minds like we talk\nabout changing your mind as a politician\nas the biggest sin that you can you can\ncommit what do you think that is\nI feel like people\num this is something that I try to keep\nin mind\num I'm gonna play a little bit of a\nlanguage game here but it captures an\nidea\num I am a person that likes capitalism\nbut I'm not like a capitalist or I might\nbe a person that plays PC games but I'm\nnot a PC Gamer I think that people will\ntake the ideas and rather than them\nhaving a strong identity that like\nconnects to these ideas those ideas are\nkind of absorbed into the identity and\nthey become part of the identity and\nwhen something is part of your identity\nit becomes very very very hard to change\nthat without feeling really bad about\nyourself I I tend to believe that people\nhave almost completely binary opinions\nof themselves like you're either\ncompletely good or completely bad it's\nvery hard to accept any fault in\nyourself without it having a lot of\ncognitive dissonance\nI think that's where things like Health\nat every size comes from right like I\ncan't like love myself if I also accept\nthat there's like an issue with my\nweight so the weight thing actually\nisn't a big deal at all you know and I\nthink with um with politics I think it's\nsimilar where you you're not just like a\nperson who is a republican you are a\nrepublican that is who you are you don't\njust have Republican ideas you are this\nthing and so to change your mind on it\nbecomes very very difficult because it's\nlike recognizing and then expelling a\nfault within yourself I think that's my\nfeeling on it interesting yeah that\nmakes a lot of sense\num you know my the only thing I would\nadd to that is that I think that that\nquality is actually quite fluctuate\nso if you look at this is more from\nEastern psychology but the more black\nand white and identified with a\nparticular quality you are correlates\nwith the amount of emotion that you feel\nespecially negative emotion\nokay so even if you ask\npeople of Die Hard political parties if\nyou can engage them in a calm discussion\nor anyone who has strongly held beliefs\nokay this has been my experience anyway\nthat if you can engage them in a calm\ndiscussion they themselves so this is\nlike literally what we do in addiction\nPsychiatry and motivational interviewing\nis you've got someone who's in denial\nI'm not an alcoholic so this is an ego\nthing\nyou know they don't think about alcohol\naddiction as a disease or whatever they\nsay I am not a alcoholic so there's\nthere's an aspect of ego that arises and\nthis is the identification that you're\ntalking about and the really interesting\nthing about ego is ego arises anytime\nyou have negative emotion as a defensive\nmechanism to protect you from pain so\nwhen someone says hey you just wrecked\nour car or you were driving with the\nkids drunk they could have died\nthat thought is painful and thus the ego\narises and tries to protect you from it\nby denying the really interesting thing\nabout disarming that is that if you can\nremove the negative emotion from the\nequation people are actually able to\nadmit their mistakes\nand one of the things that I'm just you\nknow noticing is that in in our current\nSociety if you make a mistake anyone who\ndisagrees with you and this is kind of\nwhat you were saying about you know you\ncan't get away with what you did 10\nyears ago if you make a single mistake\nlike we don't let people make mistakes\nanymore we just you know I I think that\nfirstify them yeah absolutely and you\ncan't ever admit that you were wrong\nyeah real quick it's so funny something\nthat you said about this I'm sure a lot\nof the therapy techniques everything you\nlearn can probably be um uh can Pro you\ncan probably find them in police\ninterrogations too do you ever watch any\nof these interrogation videos I've seen\nsome of these yeah that thing you just\nsaid about removing negative emotion to\nget somebody to kind of admit a mistake\nit's a very important interrogation\ntactic if you've got a criminal that's\ndone something bad\num in your an interrogation you're not\ngoing to sit there and say didn't you\nkill him didn't you kill him didn't you\nkill him usually as their interrogator\nyou're going to try to build up a lot of\nlike they were really unfair to you\nweren't they like you know you probably\nwanted to hit that guy because like who\nwouldn't like anybody would want to hit\nhim in that circumstance like it was\ntotally unfair for you like I would\nprobably attack some right you're\nremoving the negative uh emotion related\nto like or rather like the Judgment from\nthem admitting something bad and it's\nlike you're kind of like building a\nrapport with them there and then it gets\npeople more freely in those\ninterrogation rooms to admit their\nmistakes it's just funny that you said\nit that way because I remember in the\nvideos where a cop will do that and then\nthe person will start volunteering\ninformation because they don't feel like\nthere's like any negative judgment there\nanymore so yeah yeah I mean I think it's\nabout a building in Alliance is the\nbroader idea of what we would talk about\nyou know and I saw there was a video\nrecently where there's someone who is\nbeing reviled by the internet because\nthey were in a DUI and people are just\nstunned by the level of denial and it's\nlike well when you're accusatory and\nstuff like that people are just going to\ndo weird psychological stuff but yeah I\nwish I it's so hard are you talking\nabout the woman that was in the room or\nsomething different I'm not sure but I\ntend not to comment on specific people I\njust know that's what this thing yeah I\nwould something that I try to I try to\nget people to understand this all the\ntime even when I'm arguing with people\nand I hang up a call and my chat will be\nlike oh why are they so stupid why\ndidn't they just admit they were wrong\nblah blah blah really really hard to\nadmit fault in the middle of a thing\num like I tell people like I'm probably\nnot going to do it and I really I don't\nexpect anybody to do it usually if I'm\nhaving a conversation with somebody I'm\njust there to kind of like plant the\nseeds but it's very very very rare and\nit takes an exceptional human to be like\nyou know what I think I was wrong in\nthis circumstance generally people need\nto cool off and then hopefully whatever\nwords you left them with will start to\nlike take hold and then like there's\nlike a quiet admission later and then at\nsome point maybe like yeah I think\nyou're right about this you know but um\ngetting people to change their mind In\nthe Heat of the Moment is almost\nimpossible and nobody ever seems to\nrecognize that even though we all have\nthat problem every human being has that\nproblem you know yeah I mean I I\nthink we sort of understand that in the\nclinical World pretty well right even\nwhen we've got\nand and I I just wonder a little bit\nabout just the antagonistic\nrelationships of especially like\npolitics where it's like\npeople are just so at each other's\nthroats there's something that I have\njust this Instinct I have no idea if\nthis is right or wrong and this could be\nthe height of dunning-kruger but that\nyou know if you kind of get people to\nsit down and like just have a Frank\ndiscussion with them where first of all\nyou try to understand their View\num which I think is is something that's\nvery very missing in today's society we\nall try to convince even then if you\nsort of think about it like we talk\nabout something you're good at right\ndebates debates are sort of the default\nway of discussing different views and\nthere's this idea that even in that\nframe there is a winner and a loser that\npeople don't\nI mean I guess this is hopefully a good\nexample I don't think I'm debating you\nabout anything but I think we're we're\num I don't think people of differing\nviews sit down and like have discussions\nfor the purpose of like learning\nsomething together or even trying to\nunderstand the other side it's about I'm\ngoing to poke holes in this other\nperson's argument because I'm right and\nthey're wrong as opposed to hey this\nperson believes something drastically\ndifferent from what I what I do\nmaybe I need to learn something because\nthis really makes no sense\num yeah I mean I I super agree\num one of the things that I kind of push\nfor a lot in in conversations is like to\njust understand why a person feels the\nway they do\num what like there's like one truth that\nI've kind of like stumbled upon that I\nfeel very strongly about I don't think\nI'll ever change my mind on it is um\npeople can be people's feelings\nsometimes can be very irrational but\npeople's feelings are never ever ever\nrandom like they always feel something\nfor a reason and I think it's important\nto figure out why they feel the way they\ndo right somebody might be incredibly\nracist or incredibly sexist or\nincredibly whatever and it might be like\neven the way they like well I think that\nanytime I run into this type of person\nit's going to be in trouble it's like\nthat's not a rational belief that's not\ntrue like we the data the stats blah\nblah blah but it's important to\nrecognize well why do you feel that way\nbecause that feeling didn't come from\nnowhere so it's either the type of media\nthey're consuming it's some experiences\nthey've had it's things they've been\ntold by family or friends and it's\nreally important to identify that\nparticular thing to understand why that\nperson feels that way because a lot of\npeople go into some of these\nconversations and send me like oh well\nthe reason why we disagree is obviously\nbecause this guy is evil and it's like\nwell no I mean it's probably not evil\nthere's probably a reason why he\ndisagrees with you you know so so I'm a\nlittle bit confused why do you say that\nemotions are rational\num I'm sorry when I'm saying rational I\nmean like in the uh like let's say\nsomebody says that um there's a minority\nthat they see on TV so they think well\nanytime I run into that person I'm\nprobably gonna get robbed we would say\nthat like that's in a way that's like\nirrational because statistically\nspeaking this is probably not going to\nhappen\num the the feeling itself I guess isn't\nirrational because it's built on some\nparticular thing but like the way that\nthat belief manifests in the world like\nthe outcome that you think is going to\nhappen that's not very rational yeah but\nthe feeling is the feeling is there for\na reason it's important to identify why\nthe feeling is there yeah so I mean I I\nwould I would kind of\nI think we're saying the same thing but\nI would I think it's a little bit more\nsemantics but I think even for what you\njust said if there's a reason for them\nto feel that way which can be deduced\nright that implies that there is\nrationality behind it and that's like\nliterally what we sort of know is that\nif people are experiencing an emotion if\nyou even look at something like a trauma\nresponse which is the textbook\ndefinition of an irrational response so\nif I hear a door slam I believe I am in\ndanger and that someone is trying to\nhurt me but that's not you may look at\nthat from an objective standpoint and\nsay that is irrational but actually like\nwhat we sort of know clinically is that\nthis is actually a completely rational\nbelief it has to do with the way that\nour brain processes information and the\nway that it attaches a certain\nassociations to particular stimuli and\neven when it comes to things like racism\nand stuff like that there's a really\ngood test which I think is publicly\navailable\num\nsome kind of perception test out of a\nlaboratory at Harvard that essentially\nmeasures how racist you are talking\nabout the implicit bias test yeah maybe\nit's implicit biased us the really\ninteresting thing is that you know even\neven people of ethnic minorities are\nracist towards ethnic minorities because\nit's some of the way that we're\nconditioned\nyeah yeah I agree yeah\nso you you made a comment about social\nmedia earlier and how it's how it's\nruining stuff yeah can I ask you about\nthat what do you think is going on\num this gets into a lot of woo-woo\nterritory but um yeah I imagine uh not\nyour kind of ayurvedic okay no I'm just\nkidding um no no yeah it's it's when I\nsay what I mean is like I don't think I\nhave like a study um to publish or\nanything\num but I feel like um\nit I feel like human beings the way that\nwe socialize there's probably a whole\nlot of evolutionary stuff that goes into\nthat like genetically biologically uh\nand then how we're conditioned socially\nand everything and I think that social\nmedia is doing things it's like plugging\ninto that system and it's abusing it in\na whole bunch of different ways and it's\nprobably destroying the way that our\nminds are developed to socialize with\npeople\num\nMaybe So like um\nyeah I can expand more on some part of\nthat if you want to dive into anything\nmore of that yeah so I'd like to play a\nfun game go for it how about you tell me\nwhat woo you believe you don't need the\nstudies I'll give you the studies sure\nso what do you think is going on because\nI I think you're spot on\num yeah I think I think there's a lot of\nthings going on I think that the um uh\npressure for appearance is obviously\ndetrimental to teenage girls especially\nbut um the you're you're seeing so many\nimages now telling you what you're\nsupposed to look like and social media\nhas allowed us to so social media and\ncosmetic surgery has like ramped this up\nto levels that previously were thought\nimpossible like before it was just\nyou're competing with like\ngirls with a lot of makeup okay fine now\nyou're then you're competing with girls\ndo a lot of makeup and Pamela Anderson's\nwith like you know big boobs and fake\nsurgery or whatever okay and now you're\ncompeting with like people on Instagram\nthat are using facetune for Perfect Skin\nthat even on videos have live filters\nthat are also getting a lot of cosmetic\nsurgery that are also wearing a ton of\nmakeup and at this point like there are\nI don't think anybody even knows like\nit's especially true for women I think\nmen are going to start to get there but\nit's especially true for women I don't\nthink people know what a real woman even\nlooks like anymore like the the default\nhas been so out of even women I don't\nknow if know what like a real women look\nlike anymore\num because the social media you're\ninundated with a billion images a day\nfor what a woman is supposed to look\nlike and almost none of it is real\nyeah so I would agree with you and\nhere's the research and I think it's\neven worse than what you think so let's\nunderstand a couple things body\ndysmorphia is there used to be a gender\ndifference between women and men in body\ndysmorphia that difference is shrinking\num and I even think that so if you look\nat in cells for example there's a subset\nof in cells that will really focus on\nactually body dysmorphia so they'll\nfocus on jawline or some physical\nfeature and they'll say because of this\nall of my problems are there so I wonder\nactually whether\nin cells are a modern manifestation of\nbody dysmorphia so we're absolutely\nseeing core psychological problems\nmanifest in slightly new ways because of\nthe way that technology is intersecting\nwith our mind\nas an aside incels are eight times as as\neight times more likely to be on the\nautism spectrum than uh the general\npopulation sure now when it comes to\nsocial media we don't know what a normal\nhuman being or normal woman or whatever\nis supposed to look like right now I\nthink it's actually way worse than that\nit's not that there are Instagram\nfilters and stuff like that for other\npeople now for the first time in the\nhistory of humanity\nthere is a good version of you out there\nand there is a bad version of you out\nthere so this is the first time that I\ncan be both simultaneously beautiful and\nsimultaneously ugly so it's not even\ncomparison so I think this is where\ntechnology has done something new\nhuman beings have been comparing\nthemselves to other human beings who are\nmore attractive than they are from the\ndawn of time today is the first day that\nyou can compare the person that you're\ncomparing yourself to is an idealized\nversion of yourself\nsure so when I apply filters on my\nselfies or whatever and upload them and\nI have this whole Persona that's like\nedited or whatever like this I suspect\nreally screws with people because now\nwhen I look in the mirror I'm not even\ncomparing myself to someone else I'm\ncomparing myself to a version of myself\nwhich I suspect is actually\npsychologically even more damaging\nthat's that wouldn't surprise me at all\nthere are people that I know and I joke\nabout this with a few friends they're\nlike there are girls that I know in real\nlife who are like you are the most\nbeautiful girl you're unbelievably\nbeautiful it's unreal and these people\nwill spend an ungodly amount of time\nlike editing their photos and stuff it's\nlike I and it's so funny because like\nyou bring up the insult thing like I'll\ntalk to people who are like oh like I\nwish I was more attractive I'd have more\nself-esteem and I would just I'd feel\nbetter about myself and it's like bro I\nknow people that you would kill to be\nhalf as attractive as and they don't\neven have self-esteem they don't even\nthink they look good like they're seeing\nflaws in their face and body that I in a\nmillion years wouldn't even not even\nknow people were concerned about like\nwhen they twist the way that there's\nlike a crease and there's I don't even\nknow people thought about this stuff\num and and people are like yeah dude\nthat face tune up all of that stuff is\njust it's so so psychologically damaging\num yeah and I think probably I said this\na long time ago um and I thought it was\nreally funny one of the genius of those\nvery early\nI don't know if these started with\nSnapchat or with Vine but those filters\nthat like gave you the dog ears the very\nvery primitive ones way back in the day\nthose are really smart because all of\nthose filters they not only gave you the\nfunny thing they also did like the face\nsmoothing stuff too and I think people\nactually started to like the way they\nsaw with all the plays stuff or whatever\nbecause it also made their face like\nvery smooth and very perfect it got rid\nof imperfections and stuff but um yeah\nyou're probably right in that like\ncomparing yourself to uh comparing\nyourself to other people worldwide who\nhave surgery on all that is\npsychologically damaging comparing\nyourself to the most perfect version of\nyourself that is literally unattainable\num is also probably even more\npsychologically damaging to some extent\nyeah yeah and I think there's even weird\nkind of subtle manifestations I mean\nwe're talking some about women which I\nthink\nI see more\ninstances of women using filter than men\nbut I think one really interesting\nmanifestation of this I don't know that\nthe problem is necessarily worse for\nwomen which may sound weird but one of\nthe things that I sometimes wonder about\nis so I'm kind of curious Stephen do you\ntake selfies of yourself\nI sometimes but not very very rarely\nyeah right so I think that if you if I\nreally tunnel down I think if you asked\na thousand men why don't you take\npictures of yourself I would suspect\nthat a high number of them don't take\npictures of themselves because of the\nway that they look\nhmm so I I think what we're starting to\nsee is is in generally if you look at\nthe epidemiology of mental illness the\ngender divides are starting to shrink\nand I think what's going on is that\nthere are core psychological challenges\nwhich manifest differently based on\nwhether you know you're a man or a woman\nwhich I I don't know how much of this is\nbiological I suspect that more of it is\ncultural and so we're starting to see\nthese divides shrink so like the the\ndifference between an anxiety between\nmen and women is decreasing\num I think there's a lot more awareness\nthat men have borderline personality\ndisorder now that women have\nnarcissistic personality disorder so I\nthink we're starting to see a lot of\nkind of evening out illness and then I\nthink that for especially for a lot of\nmen like just from a clinical\nperspective\nwomen are about two to three times more\nas likely to be diagnosed with anxiety\nthan men but what I sort of noticed is\nthat when I work with men in\nPsychotherapy they don't describe it as\nanxiety they describe it as pressure\nI feel pressure I feel pressure I feel\npressure and then I'd ask them okay what\ndo you mean by pressure and they're like\nwell what they would essentially say is\nI'm worried that this thing won't won't\nwork out I'm worried that I won't be\nable to I'm worried about this they're\nthinking about the future and they're\nthinking about falling short in some way\nwhere if you really tunnel down to what\nis anxiety anxiety is worries about the\nfuture sure and even to the point where\nwhere you know the pressure can be so\nprofound that people can sometimes\nbecome suicidal and things like that so\nI think we're sort of and there's even\nsome data that suggests that even our\nsystem of mental illness diagnosis is\nbiased in a sense not towards women but\nsince the majority of since women are\nmore likely to be diagnosed with mental\nillness there are more studies on women\nthe way that we conceptualize a\nparticular illness is based on primarily\nfemale patients and I'm not trying to\nlike get into a gender Dynamics thing I\nthink this is just a well acknowledged\nbias in in the research yeah there's a\nlot of criticism because early like\ncluster B uh personality disorders\nthings like histrionic personality\ndisorder stuff people are saying like oh\nwell you're just pathologizing what\nwould be like a normal woman Behavior\nwhatever this isn't fair that a lot of\nthe early psych stuff sometimes\ndemonizes women or whatever in some ways\nyeah oh absolutely and so there's just\nall kinds of biases about how we've\ndeveloped our classifications so\nhistrionic personality disorderly even\nhysteria as an example is like you know\njust a real\na real tragedy that even exists today\nwhere oftentimes people will disqualify\nspeaking earlier when you were sort of\ntalking about you know like emotions are\nirrational we have this idea that\nemotions are rational and if someone\nespecially a woman is behaving\nemotionally or expressing emotions that\nwe will attribute that to things related\nto their uterus Church there are some\nlinks between mood and and you know uh\nmenstrual cycle and things like that but\nnowhere does it rise to the level except\nif you're talking about Frank psychosis\nbut just because someone is more prone\nto a particular mood does not invalidate\ntheir experience or anything like that\nwhich is yeah\nmistake that we make something that I\nfight with a lot it's very funny kind of\nyou talk about how like men Express\nthings in different ways or a man might\nfeel anxiety but he calls it pressure\none thing's really funny about us I\nfight on a lot of podcasts with a lot of\nred pillar people who say things like oh\nemotionality is for women stoicism is\nfor men in general women are very\nemotional and men are not emotional and\nI always point out when I argue when I\nargue these people's like are you\nconsidering anger and emotion because\nmen can be very quick to anger and anger\nis correlated with things like\ntestosterone and it's very funny because\nwhen they'll say that like women are\nemotional and men aren't they never\nreally consider anger to be like an\nemotion that's not like a thing so if\nyou point out that like men could be\nquick to violence a quick anger like if\nyou've got like two women that are\nscreaming at each other people go oh\nwell these are very feminine emotional\nwomen if you've got a man that's\nscreaming at somebody people go oh\nthat's a very emotional effeminate man\nbut if two men want to fight and kill\neach other over some incredibly stupid\n[ __ ] outside of like a restaurant those\nare just like men being men and they\ndon't consider any emotionality there\nit's just kind of funny because it\nreminded me what you said earlier for\nlike the a mental have anxiety but call\nit pressure so he thinks he doesn't have\nanxiety and some men will be very quick\nor prone to anger or violence but they\ndon't consider themselves emotional\nbecause they don't consider that like an\nemotion it's kind of like a word game to\nhide things that we don't want to\nconfront I guess yeah and I I don't mean\nto I'm going to ask you a couple\nquestions but I'm I'd like to understand\nthis perspective that you're alluding to\nbut I don't mean to\ntry to put you in a place where you have\nto adopt that perspective so when they\nsay men are stupid go for it yeah what\ndoes that mean\nor emotional and men are stoic\nI'm gonna try okay okay I'm gonna use a\nlot of really triggering words I'm so\nsorry I don't know how to describe this\nwithout using triggering words okay yeah\nin my opinion there is a thing uh a\nbroad category of things that I would\ncall like toxically masculine okay that\ntoxic word triggers a hell of a lot of\npeople but basically it's the idea that\nlike a man's job is to basically shut up\ndeal with everything be uh cold\nemotionless a warrior provider protector\nanything that comes at him he just\ndeflects off with this cool aloof\nstoicistic way or whatever and he just\nworks through things like that and that\nworrying about stuff or being afraid or\nbeing scared or having doubts that's in\nthe domain of women but men are never\nsupposed to have those feelings that's\nlike essentially kind of the like the\nmanosphere or like red pill belief with\nthe difference between how men and women\nprocess emotions essentially\nokay so yeah I mean I think a couple\nthings to that I would kind of and I I\nrecognize you don't believe this but so\nthe first is that\num\nI think not feeling emotions does not\nmean that you are not emotional\nabsolutely yeah so what I tend to find\nis that when people use a lot of\nemotional suppression the emotion\nthey're just not aware of it but it\nabsolutely controls their behavior it\njust gets displaced or transmuted in\nsome particular way so you know we kind\nof know this somewhere if you look at\nfor example like people who have\naddictions so a lot of like addictive\nbehavior correlates with your internal\nemotional state which you may be\ncolorblind to so men are more likely to\nbe there's something called normative\nmale alexithymia so alexithymia is\ncolorblindness of emotions okay so you\nare unaware of your internal emotional\nstate okay and the reason we call it\nnormative male alexithymia is because it\nis it is culturally\nnormal not saying it's healthy but as a\ncultural standard for men to be Alexa\nthymic so we're not even aware when\nwe're feeling a particular way yeah the\nother thing about one thing the biggest\nway this manufacturing readers are a\nquick thing is I will be really angry\nbecause I haven't eaten but I won't\nnotice until I eat like I'll eat and\nthen I'll be like oh my God I was in\nsuch a horrible mood I didn't I wasn't\neven aware of it so I understand what\nyou said when you say that 100 yeah so\nso this is the other funny thing is that\nthe thing about anger is anger is an\numbrella emotion so what I tend to find\nis that when men say that they're angry\noftentimes they're feeling all kinds of\nother things but the only thing that\nwe've been culturally normalized to\nexpress is anger right so when someone\nbreaks up with you you say man screw\nthat person you know like you get angry\nat all kinds of things but underneath\nlike when you get broken up with what do\nyou feel you feel shame 100 because\nsomeone dumped you right but that's not\nwhat you express you're like oh screw\nthat person screw everybody screw all of\nthis class of people\nyou also feel fear right because this\nperson broke up with me like what does\nthat mean about other people breaking up\nwith me does this mean that I will be\nable to find love there's usually all\nkinds of emotions that\nlook like anger but it's really like the\nnumber one umbrella motion that covers\nall kinds of other stuff\nyeah I wish I saved this I feel like I\nread something or saw a graph at some or\na chart or something where it talked\nabout like first order second order like\nemotional states and that like some of\nthese are illusory and it kind of\nalluded to the point that you were\nmaking that like anger isn't actually\nlike a real emotion or it kind of is but\nit's usually flowing from something else\nso anger might be the way that you\num represent massive insecurity or it\nmight be a way that you represent like\nmassive frustration with something you\nmight call it anger but that anger\nemotion isn't actually that in itself\nyou don't just feel angry about a\nparticular thing usually there's\nsomething else that leads into it there\nare a couple different emotions and they\ndiscovered I actually remember where I\nread that from but yeah I understand\nwhat you're saying yeah and I mean even\nif we look at someone who's narcissistic\nright when there's someone when you\nchallenge someone and who's a\nnarcissistic they will get angry at you\nbut underlying it is like you know the\nfear that if you call someone stupid and\nthey're afraid that they're stupid they\nwill get pissed at you because you could\nbe right and that's what they're trying\nto avoid yeah and and so I think it\nmakes a lot of sense that you know\npeople sort of leave man or stoic I I\nbut I don't and I think that's that's\nalso the reason they believe that is\nprobably because that's their experience\nthey don't walk around feeling a whole\nlot of shame or even when they do feel\nshame that's they get angry with\nthemselves right you beat yourself up\nyou're a loser you're a beta you're\nwhatever because you you feel these\nnegative things and the only socially\nacceptable thing to feel is anger\nyeah I think um I think erudite I don't\nknow if you've heard of her or not um\nand maybe even you I might have talked\nabout this I've heard this repeated a\nlot that\num as children\num one of the social advantages for\nwomen is the way that little girls tend\nto express emotion is through like\ncrying and when somebody's crying you\nknow you want to help them cry and work\nout their emotions and as a result of\nthat women are kind of socialized to\ndeal with their emotional uh processing\nbetter\num whereas for boys boys tend to be a\nbit more physical and when we get\nemotional we want to like hit things or\nwhatever and you're very immediately\nlike shut down like don't hit that's\nwrong and you kind of have like this\ninward like okay well when I express\nemotion I get in big trouble for it\nnobody helps me work through it so\nyou're kind of socialized to never\nreally process a deal with those\nemotions or as little girls get a ton of\nhelp with it I don't know how true that\nis in terms of empirically background\nI've heard that repeated a lot I mean I\nthink there's a fair amount so that used\nto be way more true than it is today but\nit's not just that it's it's that we\nalso know that it's not just that kids\nhit things more I would even say there's\none layer before that which is that\ngenerally speaking young boys at least\nwhen I was growing up in like the 80s\nwe were not allowed to express any\nemotion besides anger yeah right so if I\ncry in a locker room like\nit's GG man they're sure and you would\nliterally the comparison would be you'd\nbe called a girl that was the insult\nlike you are a girl you're like a girl\nyou're like yeah right yeah so so it was\njust not so the only I think part of the\nreason that and this is what I think we\nhave to be a little bit careful because\nboys are more physical like that may be\ntrue but I think that could also be a\ncultural consequence it could be yeah of\ncourse that the only thing that we're\nallowed to do is be physical so that's\nwhat we lean into\nyeah and I think we're seeing like more\nfluctuation there where I saw something\nlike\n20 of\ngen Z or gen Alpha identifies\nas lgbtqia or something like that and\nand I think that there's a lot more\num variable expression of gender\nidentity now so like people you know\nI'll see dudes that have their nails\npainted and that's like fine\nso yeah\nyeah but I think everything you were\nsaying about social media is like spot\non I mean there's a lot of research to\nsupport that body dysmorphia is on the\nrise things like filters and then also\nwhat you said your your general thesis I\nthink is also spot on that essentially\nwe have these circuits in our brain\nwhich have evolved over millions of\nyears and what platforms have discovered\nis that when I take advantage of this\nparticular circuit people will use my\nplatform more\nso I noticed recently that there's a\nparticular app that I have that anytime\nyou take a picture the default is that\nit applies a filter oh geez you don't\neven have to turn them on uh\nyeah that's wild yeah and I think that\npeople realize oh okay like\nwhen people use my app they'll take\npictures on my app more\nbecause we apply filters\nyeah that's pretty scary yeah\num yeah yeah I don't disagree yeah so\nwhat else I mean any other thoughts\nabout like what's going on with mental\nhealth in the world today\num I think usually when I talk to people\nI usually say if you're having mental\nhealth issues there's like four pillars\nthat I think that people should focus on\num the first is diet and when I say diet\nI just mean like very broadly like\nhealthy macros and microbes like it does\nhave to mean like no fast food ever or\nyou're going completely green or\nwhatever but just like make sure you're\ngetting like a good mix of like you know\nlike fats protein carbs and make sure\nyou're like eating some type of like\nleafy green and not too much so like\nbasic dietary stuff\num it's the first pillar second pillar\nis some type of exercise man we truly\nlike have evolved to be the most like\nlong distance running mobile animals\nit's like so much of our biology goes\ninto like the ability to sweat and\ndissipate heat and all of that is\ncompletely tossed to the Wayside when we\nsit at a computer for 12 hours a day\num so like 30 minutes even of just like\nwalking a day I imagine would be a like\nan exponential bump to a lot of people's\nmental health one thing that I notice\num and this would be a tip that I give\nto friends with uh or people that have\nfriends that suffer with mental health\nissues is one of the most important one\nof the quickest shortcut ways to get\nsomebody's move to be improved that is\nhaving like a depressive episode or is\nstuck inside is to literally like pick\nthe person up and say hey we're gonna go\non a walk for five minutes come with me\nout of the [ __ ] sunlight let's go I\nhave never in my life met a person\nhaving a depressive episode or even a\nperson with depression\num that after a five minute walk their\nmood wasn't significantly improved I'm\nnot saying it's going to fix all their\nproblems or cure everything but that\njust like moving your body existing in\nthe sunlight very basic things that\nwe've like evolved over Millennia to be\nokay with are things that we kind of\nlike don't do anymore so the um\ndiet\num exercise just like 30 and yeah I\ndon't live like 30 minutes moving a day\num sleep again Jesus we spent like a\nthird of Our Lives sleeping making sure\nthat uh you have that in order like\nsleep hygiene don't go to bed with your\nphone you know the bed is only for sex\nand sleeping don't watch TV there don't\ndo anything just go to bed if you have a\npartner do your thing and then sleep get\nyour full like seven and a half to nine\nhours wake up\num and then the fourth one is like\nsocialization you have to be talking to\nother human beings you can't exist as\nyour own thing like we're social\ncreatures like cooperation and language\nis like probably the most important\nthing that humans have developed is like\nthe faculty for abstract Concepts and\nlanguage you have to be talking to\npeople that's usually the four things\nthat I say that like these things are\nprobably out of whack if something is\nmentally going wrong\num and and they're the things that\nprobably I think everybody needs to\nfocus on as much as they can yeah\nyeah I mean I I'd agree\num you know it's really interesting\nbecause I think we've made I'm beginning\nto realize we've made I think one major\nmistake in this country as a whole yeah\nI I think this is a potentially a\ncatastrophic mistake sure so back when\nmedicine was evolving\nwhat happened is that as we were\ndeveloping like instrumentation\nPsychiatry wanted to play along right so\nwe had like we just discovered the\nmicroscope in microbes and we started\ndoing biopsies and x-rays and like\nmedicine became real right prior to that\nit was It was ayurveda kind of stuff\nwhich by the way you're you're very in\nline with with your four pillars I\nrather would completely agree yeah\num\nand uh and so what happened is is we in\nPsychiatry decided we wanted to play\nalong so like everyone else had proof of\nthe realness of their illnesses as\nopposed to things like humors and so we\nin Psychiatry tried to play along and\nwhat we started to do is even now you\nhave you know companies with that I've\ndone this a couple of times the where\nI'll do Gene testing on my patients to\nsee which medications they'll metabolize\nwell and stuff like that and we can do\nlike things like MRIs and and we can\ntest an individual in a particular way\nbut I think out of all of the organs in\nour body the mind is the number one\norgan that in order for it to be healthy\nthere there is a relational component so\nwe think about mental health or mental\nillness is existing within one human\nbeing but especially when it comes to\nthe mind\nand this is what's so tragic about this\nis that we've sort of made it the\nindividual's responsibility or the\ntherapist or the psychiatrist's\nresponsibility to fix a mental illness\nwithin you whereas if you look at a lot\nof research what we really find for a\nlot of mental illness is that what even\nprevents mental illness is things like\nsocialization and human connection\nthere's a ton of research on things like\noxytocin\nwe also have all this stuff around\nattachment Theory where we sort of like\nfigured out that the healthiness of your\nmind has just as much to do with your\nrelationships or even more than\nwhatever's\ngoing on within your mind and the real\ntragedy is that we've sort of like\nmissed that part so even if you look at\nall of our interventions our\ninterventions\nare all about helping one person they're\nnot about helping that person or or\nplacing the responsibility on their\nfriends or spouses or whatever to like\nengage with them in a relationally\nhealthy way which is really what\nsupports mental health and it's a huge\nproblem because I think we've like\nmissed\nlike we've like horribly miscalculated\nyeah I think um uh it's not me if I get\ntoo crazy here I think that one the\nreason why it's so difficult when you\nlook at mental health is because I feel\nlike um mental health borrows a lot of\nprinciples from medicine in terms of\nlike diagnosis and treatment but the\ngoal is completely different like in my\nopinion\ngenerally speaking like 99 of the time\nwhen we're talking about like medicine\nor traditional hospitals when you're\ngoing to these places they're trying to\nsend you out not dead that's the point\nis to get you back to like a baseline\nlike not dead they're not turning you\ninto a healthy person they're not like\nhelping you exercise or making your\nheart better or stronger any of that\nthrough cardio they're giving you\nmedication to reduce your blood pressure\nthey're giving you a surgery to reset a\nbone that's all they're doing mental\nhealth practitioners though are tasked\nin my opinion with a far different\nstandard because if a mental health\npractitioner was compared to a hospital\nperson the goal is basically just to you\nknow make sure the person doesn't hurt\nthemselves I guess and that's it but\nthat's not the goal for mental the goal\nfor mental health doesn't mean you come\nout feeling like really good like give\nyou tools to like excel in life\num and I feel like with that different\nof a standard place to try to use the\nsame tools that that they use in\nmedicine it basically sets a lot of like\nmental health practitioning up for\nfailure you know because it's like a\ndoctor is never going to make you strong\nand muscular with a medication but a lot\nof mental health practitioners are\nalmost trying to get people like strong\nand healthy Minds with an SSRI and some\ntherapy and it's like that's like a\nwhole life journey to figure out how to\nlike fix a lot of this stuff and it's a\nI think that the bar is set way higher\nand people don't even realize how much\nmore difficult it is for mental health\npractitioners to to get people to where\nthey want to be if that makes sense yeah\nI mean I I think that there's some truth\nto that I would kind of so let I think\nwe have to compare apples to apples so\nthe first is that\nyou're right that our system of medicine\nis about not about health care is about\nsick care basically yeah so what we\nfocus on is the removal of pathology not\nthe building of Health that's true in\nPsychiatry as well so when you go to a\npsychiatric hospital these are not\nyou're not trying to help these people\nfind fulfillment in life I mean ideally\nyou do that kind of stuff and I find it\nto be very helpful but that's not what\nwe're trained to do what we're trained\nto do is safety and stabilization and\nand things like that when people are you\nknow like acutely psychotic or manic or\nthings like that they're you know you\nhave to help them in that way I think\nthe real tragedy is that in in\noutpatient mental health treatment we're\nkind of lost between that where if you\nlook at most of our formal training our\nformal training is still and actually\nthe removal of pathology yeah like it's\nnot in the building of Health\nnow this is where things get really\ntricky because a lot of therapists have\ndiscovered\nthat the most sustainable way to\nkeep pathology at Bay is to build health\nright in the same way that we know that\nif you want to prevent an MI diet and\nexercise are going to do well I don't\nknow if it's statistically correct or\nnot but I imagine it is that diet and\nexercise will overall help your health\nmore than any particular medication a\nblood pressure medic yeah for sure yeah\nno it reminds me of the there's like the\nyou've seen the meme where it's like the\nstupid guy and then like the medium\nintelligence guy and then like the\nreally smart guy right yeah it's like\nthe stupid guy is like bro like just go\nto the gym and talk to some friends and\nthe really smart guy is like well\nactually\num we need to use uh CBT plus these\nmedications plus this therapy every week\nand then the really smart guys like you\nprobably actually just need to get\noutside and talk to some friends right\nthat's what it feels like sometimes we\nget like a little bit lost to the sauce\nyeah for how to like give people healthy\nMinds you know and I think the real\ntragedy is that if you look at like I\nsaid so the good therapists that that at\nleast I I know and I've worked with are\nthe ones that help people build that\nkind of stuff but that also is not\nnecessarily there's all kinds of like\nShades of Gray in there where you know\nthere's hospitalized and there's post\nhospitalization where you you can't\nreally think about\npurpose and stuff like that you really\nhave to make sure that you don't kind of\ngo back in and you're getting out of bed\nevery day and things like that but and\nthis is the real interesting thing is\nthat there's this whole other branch of\ntherapy\nwhich is not pathological in orientation\nso this is where like psychoanalysis and\nthese kinds of things start to come in\nand there's kind of this Continuum and\nthis is also why I think we see a huge\ninjection of mindfulness into\nPsychotherapy because I think\nmindfulness is a good example meditation\nis actually the mental health practice\nthat is designed to go from zero to a\nhundred not negative 100 to zero and now\nwhat we're discovering is oh by the way\nif it takes you from zero to 100 we can\nuse it for people who are have some kind\nof pathology and this is the crisis it\nin that I see sort of in the field of\ntherapy is that like a lot of therapists\nwant to help people do that but that's\nactually not what we're trained to do\nwhich by the way which is why I think\nwe're seeing this field of coaching\nemerge because what people are\ndiscovering and even like so for example\nMcLean Hospital where I trained and\nworked has this Institute of coaching\nwhich is really interesting\nand and The Institute of coaching was\nstarted by a therapist\nand what they sort of discovered and\nthis is where you kind of get into\nthings like positive psychology is like\nsome group of therapists or\npsychologists discovered okay hold on a\nsecond there's this thing called\npositive psychology and we can kind of\nharness that and then what's really\ninteresting now is though if you look at\nas Things become kind of more diagnosis\nbased and protocol based as a field\nwe're actually moving away from\nsupporting mental health I don't think\nthat's what most therapists want to do\nit's it's what we're kind of being\nshuttled into because as mental illness\ngets worse across the globe now we need\nmore diagnosis more treatment more\npeople are suicidal more people have\nbody dysmorphia and so we're kind of\nmoving away from that but there's\nthere's all kinds of like really scary\ndata like the number one thing that\ncorrelates with pornography addiction is\nmeaninglessness the number one thing\nthat correlates with uh male suicide is\nthwarted belongingness\nand it may not even be due to mental\nillness like this is a huge thing that\nwe've got to be super careful about\nyeah yeah I don't disagree there was the\num I don't think I brought this up to\nyou before but something I bring up on\nstream a lot is it uh if you looked at\nthe people that were joining Isis uh you\nknow seven or eight or nine years ago um\nthat in Europe like Muslims that were in\nEurope that were joining Isis to fight\nin the Middle East if you watch the\nrecruitment videos and looked at the\npeople joining\num you know you're thinking like okay\nman it just must be like I guess like\nthe really poor financially [ __ ]\npeople that are looking for a paycheck\nor someplace to live that wasn't true\nthough it was middle class people and if\nyou watch the videos it wasn't like\nwe're gonna give you money the videos\nwere like we've got something for you to\nfight for here's like purpose and\nmeaning in life like that's what\neverything was geared towards\num and then funny enough if you look at\nlike any Colts like recruitment strategy\nor any large political movements\nrecruitment strategy which political\nmoments oftentimes are indistinguishable\nfrom Colts um oftentimes that's it it's\nlike here's meaning you know and\nespecially with not to Branch out to 50\nmillion things but especially as like\nreligious importance is kind of like\nsubsided in society we've kind of lost a\nlot of that overarching Narrative of Our\nLives that religion likes so easily gave\nus and without that overarching\nnarrative man it could be really hard to\npush through a lot of really difficult\nstuff in life uh because yeah like\nfighting fighting through life when you\ndon't know what the purpose is or what's\non the other end uh is is almost\nimpossible whereas if you feel like\nthere's something on the other end you\ncan fight through impossible odds you\nknow so yeah that that General loss of\nmeaning that doesn't surprise me that\nthat probably correlates with so many\ndifferent things in terms of negative\nmental health outcomes yeah I mean it's\nit's you know this is it's kind of\ninteresting because even if you look at\nHinduism and Buddhism and we call these\nthings religions but\nthe con the word religion is actually\nlike a western concept\nright so when we when we think in the\nwest about a religion like so it's kind\nof weird because people will ask you\nknow can you convert to Hinduism or can\nyou con or how do I convert people\nsometimes ask me how do I convert to\nHinduism how do I convert to Buddhism\nand I'm sure someone there's I'm sure\nthere's some kind of induction ceremony\nor diksha or something like that but\nit's not really conversion someone will\ndo a ceremony for you if you really want\nit but the the concept of conversion in\nthat there's people of this religion and\nnot of this religion is actually kind of\nforeign to like the Eastern religions or\nthose kind of what I would call the\nkarmic religions and what's really\ninteresting is what they sort of focus\non is is this idea of Dharma or Duty or\nresponsibility or purpose and and\nthere's a really core concept which I\nthink is sort of like I kind of think\nit's scientifically valid and this is\nwhy we're seeing in the Third Way of\npsychotherapy like these these therapies\nlike DBT and act they're basically\nincorporating some of these Eastern\nphilosophies to me that sort of speaks\nto their\nalmost like objective correctness but I\ncould be biased because I was raised in\nthese Traditions or saw a lot of value\nin them but I think if we're you know if\nthat's what the science shows that's\nwhat the science shows but I think the\nbig thing that we sort of discover\nis that when you have a purpose you can\ntolerate negativity yeah and in the\nabsence of purpose you're stuck seeking\nout pleasure and avoiding pain and if\nyou build a life that is seeking out\npleasure in avoiding pain that life will\nlead to unhappiness or a lack of\ncontentment and and so I think what's\nreally cool about these Eastern things\nand this is what we kind of try to teach\nright but without being religious I\ndon't think it's really a religious\nconcept it's just people sort of figured\nout they're like hey if you're\nstruggling you should do this stuff yeah\num and and I think on the global it\nmakes perfect sense to me that people\nwho are joining Isis are like lacking\npurpose in their life and that's what we\nsort of see why do people get addicted\nto pornography it's because they don't\nhave a reason not to yeah\nyeah it's actually now that you say that\nit's really funny because two things\nthat I didn't realize I just two things\njust super clicked in my head and I\nrealized now why I say one thing without\neven realizing before so that having\nthat purpose is really important\num anytime somebody comes up to me and\nthey ask me like I'm trying to figure\nout I had a friend recently who's like I\ndon't know if I should move to LA I\ndon't know if she's moving all right I\ndon't know if I should move Miami or a\nfriend is like I don't know if I should\nyou know stream for two more years I\ndon't know if you do this\num every single time a person comes to\nme for advice the first thing I always\nask is where do you want to be in one\nyear what do you want to be in five\nyears what do you want to be doing later\nand if they don't know then I always\ntell them like you're like you're\nwhatever the answer you come up with\nhere is meaningless because if you don't\nknow what you want to be in a year or\nfive years like who cares what you\ndecide now like but if you know what you\nwant to be in five years if you know\nwhat you're like aiming for all the\nother decisions are actually super easy\num there's very few conflicts in life\nthat are hard to solve uh they might be\num like or rather the solutions are\nusually simple they might not be easy\nbut usually simple if you know where you\nwant to be right that's why when you're\nin high school\num when you're picking classes as a\njunior usually say well what do you want\nto do College because that'll tell you\nwhat classes you need to take as a\nsenior and that'll tell you what you\nneed to take as a junior right and then\nsame thing with difficulties in life you\nknow if you want to be in five years at\nsome place financially well then you\nknow that you probably have to make\ndifficult decisions right now about how\nyou're going to increase your you know\nyour earning power but at least you know\nwhere you're headed so you have the\nability to suffer through and push\nthrough and do that and yeah the\ndecisions kind of fall in line but\npeople trying to figure out really\ncomplicated answers to questions now\nwhere they don't know where they want to\nbe even in like one or two years it's an\ninsurmountable task and whatever you\nchoose you're going to be like aimlessly\nwandering through life doing it yeah I\nthink what I tend to see completely\nagree with that is that even if you look\nat like dating right so people don't\nhave a North star and they get stuck in\nthis Loop of optimization so when I see\npeople who are paralyzed they're they're\ntrying to figure out okay what should I\ndo\nthey're usually trying to figure out\nokay what is the most efficient decision\nwhat is the best decision to make\nwhereas what I tend to find is that when\npeople have purpose you actually make a\nlot of inefficient or poor decisions but\nthose are the right decisions and\nthey're worth it in the simplest way I\nwould describe it is that you know\neveryone's trying to figure out okay how\ndo I find the right partner whereas like\nthe way to have a successful\nrelationship is to fall in love with\narguably the wrong person and then if\nyou're lucky enough you find a way to\nmake it work because there is a North\nstar or some kind of compass that moves\nyou there I don't think falling in love\nis sufficient but it's a huge part of it\nand then when people kind of go all in\non it there may be all kinds of reasons\nwhy this is not the right relationship\nand then I think the reason to stay or\ngo depends on whether that person is\nwilling to work with you to like make it\nwhat it needs to be\nbut I see it's far for far too long I\nmean I've seen so many people where I'd\nsay the core of their problem is like\nyou're trying to figure out what the\nmost efficient solution is but you've\ngot no Direction yeah and so you can\noptimize really well for like many\nthings in your life but like what are\nyou optimizing for you know right people\nalways ask yeah people will say things\nlike do you think it'd be good if I did\nthis and my answer is like well good\nwith respect to what I mean like it\ncould be or it could be the worst\ndecision ever it really depends on what\nyou're trying to do you know yeah\nyeah and I think another issue here is\nthat I think we've lost touch with what\nwe want\nbecause Society has gotten so good at\ntelling us what we want\num lost touch I'm thinking about that\nstatement I want to disagree\num but it's probably going to be\nsemantically we'll probably agree I\nthink that the problem is I think that\nwe go after what we want too much but\nour wants are very short-term oriented\nlike everybody like for instance like if\nI were to make a really edgy statement I\nwould say every single person that's\nobese wants to be obese and the reason\nwhy they want to is because they want to\nsit on the couch they want to watch TV\nwhile playing computers these days sorry\nthey want to eat foods that are high in\nsugar they want to avoid exercise at all\ncosts if you want all of those things\nwell then you want to be obese but\nnobody really wants to be obese but it's\nthat uh it's the time Horizon and\neverything the windows of like all the\nshort-term Pleasures are there and if\nyou're doing all of that you're always\nbuilding towards this thing that in the\nin the in the grand you might not want\nit like overall you might want something\ndifferent but um we make so many\ndecisions in such short time windows\nthat we seem to like lose sight of the\ngrandeur thing yeah so what do you think\nit is that makes us uh I'll I'll top\nyour edgy statement with a story in a\nsecond but okay um what do you think it\nis that makes us lose sight of the long\nterm\num oh man so here is uh I'll do more now\nI feel like uh I feel like in life\nI feel like there is uh I I know there's\nsome edgy loser [ __ ] philosopher that's\nprobably said this better than me but I\nactually I feel like friction in life is\nactually probably more important than I\never thought it was some amount of\nstruggle before pleasure is probably\npart of the whole pleasure like it's\nprobably a necessary part of a human\nexperience and I think that um like so\nfor example something I'll say I say\nthis to someone hasn't read a book in so\nlong but the feeling that you get when\nyou finish a book is incomparable to\nhowever many memes you can go through it\nfeels way more fulfilling but memes are\nlike more gratifying and you just do\nthat I think that for a lot of parts of\nour life we've stripped out all the\nfriction and we've found a way to get\nthe immediate pleasure in everything and\nin doing so we've lost the ability to\ndeal with any amount of adversity or\nfriction to get to a longer goal and I\nthink that that desire to reduce\nfriction in all areas of Our Lives has\ncompromised our ability to work towards\nthings even in the medium term I think\nit's that removal of friction\nyeah so I I I'm with you that I think we\nit's an issue of semantics and I think\nwe're saying the same thing so I I would\neven add one layer on top of that so I'm\nwith you that I think we remove friction\nright so we're in the age of of food\ndelivery grocery delivery uh you don't\neven you don't have to go to a game\nstore to buy a game anymore right like I\ncan get everything brought to my house\num I can make friends on Discord I can\ndo everything in a frictionless way and\nwe even get we get entitled it so fast\ntoo like like only today in 2023 like\nthis [ __ ] that just brought my food\nfrom another place in the city won't\neven come up to my [ __ ] door I'm\ngonna go downstairs to get it and it's\nlike bro holy [ __ ] I find myself doing\nshowings like Jesus Christ like when I\nwas a kid the internet even exists and\nI'm already this spoiled over everything\nyou know yeah yeah so I I would say that\nas a consequence of the frictionless I'm\nwith you in terms of of that friction is\nimportant but I'm gonna sort of take in\na slightly different direction but I\nthink this is where leaning on kind of\nthe Eastern stuff for a minute so I I\nthink we've lost the capacity to like\nintrospect and have awareness of our\ninternal drives which is what I would\nsay\nleads to a lack of long-term thinking so\nif we sort of think about internal\ndrives right purpose or the Harmar or\nsomething like that those tend to be\nlong-lasting right so it's like if it's\nsomething that you care about that can\nusually not be satisfied in a very short\namount of time whereas what we've done\nis as we become as our attention has\nbecome externalized the wants that we\nhave have become given to us by the\noutside play this new video game buy\nthis new thing watch this new movie\nyou know and this is where people can\ntalk about materialism I think it's even\ndeeper than material it's not about\nmaterialism not Material it's even like\nyou know take this new course on\nspirituality like and be more fulfilled\nright the five-minute body a five minute\nbody the five minutes to Enlightenment\nyou know like now do it faster the five\ntips that keep you from getting\nenlightened like it's all this kind of\nlike instant gratification stuff but the\nmain thing is that literally our mind is\nnot paying attention it's not looking\nthis way it's looking that way\nand when we do that I think we\nfundamentally lose sight of what we want\nand they're replaced by almost\nconditioning and I've seen this a lot in\nin some of the patients or clients that\nI've worked with where they've been\nconditioned to want to be successful and\nthey do a lot of stuff they make a lot\nof sacrifice but the sacrifice they're\ndoing is to make their parents happy\nand then they sort of end up successful\nwhere they should be happy and instead\ntheir life feels empty\nand I was really worried for a little\nwhile I went and talked to one of my\nsupervisors about this because\n30 of my patients within one year to 18\nmonths of joining my practice would make\na major career change and I started to\nlike be scared that I was like hold on a\nsecond am I imposing my value system on\npeople so that are like giving up the\ncareer that they've spent a decade or\ntwo\ndoing and I was I was really concerned\nthat I was like you know doing things\nmaybe I was biasing people or things\nlike that but it turns out I don't\nreally think I was\nit just turns out that when you start to\nask people questions about okay like\nwhat do you want\nand once you really do a thorough\nintrospective exploration people find\nout answers and then they start to\nchange the direction of their life\nand and so I'm with you I don't think we\nactually disagree but I think that's\nkind of the issue is that we don't\nwe're so caught up in this sort of\nfrictionless\ngratification that we lose sight of what\nwe actually care about yeah I think that\num it's funny because something you just\nsaid here actually wraps around\nsomething you said um close to the\nbeginning of our conversation is you\nsaid one of the issues with mental\nhealth is that it seems like we're\nseating control of our mental well-being\nto other people\nand in a way that's kind of what you\njust said here that we're externalizing\neven our drives to other people around\nus\num and it's so funny because I think of\nlike I'm I I'm borrowing a lot from like\nred pill stuff because that's what I've\nbeen fighting with recently but like\nwhen these people talk about like you've\nheard about like the grind set right\nyeah wake up at 4am take a cold shower\ngo like all these like crazy things\nright and it's like where does that is\nthat your drive or have you actually\nlike externalized that process and now\nsomebody else is giving you Dr you a\ndrive to be on the grinds if you don't\nwant to be on the ground what are you\neven grinding for you're like what do\nyou even care about yeah yeah what are\nyou saying yeah I mean I think it's\nabsolutely their drive so so I mean I I\ndon't you know I I'm I'm pulling stuff\nfrom offline conversations and stuff\nlike that and even Reliance or patience\nbut I I think that my experience with a\nlot of people who who espouse the\nphilosophy and it's not really fair if\nwe're not you know representing them\naccurately so let's just acknowledge\nthat is that oftentimes these people do\nvow they're like they value something\ndeep down on the inside like I want to\nfeel good about myself I want to feel\nproud of myself I want to be loved\nbut oftentimes\nwhat I find in most of the red pill\npeople I work with is like there's a\ndecent chunk of trauma involved\nyeah where and and then what happens is\nsomeone comes to you and says okay like\nif you want something in life it's been\nhard for you to achieve it right because\nyou've been trying really hard and so\nthere's almost this kind of like bias\ntowards the harder something is the more\nvaluable it is yeah and then what people\ndo is they sell you this idea that like\noh since you're suffering so hard like\nthey're a big problem requires a big\nsolution and if you are suffering really\nreally really bad something as simple as\nseeing a therapist for one hour a week\nfor eight months surely cannot fix your\nproblem you need a bigger solution to\nyour big problem and so you have to\nsacrifice everything you've got 4 am\ncold showers you have to slap yourself\non the nuts every single day to build up\nbecause pain is weakness leaving the\nbody\nand if you do all of these things you\nwill achieve that thing that you value\nbecause I do see a lot of sacrifice and\nand focus from these people\nbut I still think they're chasing\nsomething yeah but that the important\nthing is they never spend time figuring\nout what that something is so like I\nespecially look at this in relation to a\nlot of the advice and critiques they\ngive of like relationship stuff where I\nnoticed that when I listened to a lot of\nthese Red Bull people curiously none of\nthem talk about relationships they might\ntalk about like intersexual Marketplace\nDynamics or they might talk about like\nthe most effective ways to hook up with\npeople or they might talk about like\nreproductive strategies or whatever but\nI've never heard like a red pill I say\nlike if you're having a big argument\nwith your significant other like what's\nthe best way to resolve the conflict\nwhere both parties you know come away\nfeeling okay like I've never heard a\nconversation like this ever you know\nit's just like um the I guess it's like\nyou said like there's there's a lot of\nPusher drive to something but people\nlike I don't even know if people know\nwhat that something is other than being\nlike the top one percent richest guy\nlike whatever the most consumerist you\nknow hyper capitalists yeah God\nyeah I mean I I think that that that's\nwhat it correlates with but I suspect\nthat there's something you know deeper\npsychological about love and acceptance\nbecause usually in in this the trauma\nthat at least I've seen is\noftentimes very explicitly a lack of\nlove and acceptance yeah and I think the\nreason that I I don't in a weird way I\nkind of don't fault them for what you're\nsaying is that they don't talk about how\nto resolve a relationship with a\nsignificant other because I don't think\nthey think about their their unit and\nthis is where we could be unfair but my\nexperience of listening to these people\nand working with these people is they\ndon't\nthe fundamental unit through which you\ngo through life is an individual\nright because no one as you said earlier\nyou don't experience about your class\nyeah right oh sure yeah right so no one\nno one is going to care about you you\nhave to look out for yourself so they go\nthrough like life is a single player\ngame from them it's not a co-op game so\nif you kind of think about it you're not\nyou're not playing co-op with a partner\npartners are NPCs and they dehumanize\nthem so you can kind of see okay I'm\nplaying like life is a single player\ngame and like relationships are with\nNPCs\nand that's the way I'm gonna so why\nwould I care about an NPC's feelings\nit's just not the way that I\nconceptualize life yeah I agree for a\nlot of the dating advice it feels as a\ncritique I have a lot of a lot of it\nfeels very zero-sum and very adversarial\nlike if one side is winning it means the\nother side is losing so you've got to do\nyour best to get one over the other\nperson as much as you can yeah and I\nthink the reason they feel that way is\nbecause that's been their experience\nbecause they used to be the NPC which is\nwhat a beta is right and I'll be damned\nif I'm ever the NPC again\nso I'm gonna be I'm gonna be in control\nI'm gonna get this stuff\nand you know I think the real the\nthere's a lot of good stuff I think in\nred pill because they they advocate for\na lot of individual responsibility I've\nseen a lot of people who will make like\nobjective progress in their life\nright it's kind of weird because it's\nsort of like in my opinion kind of this\nmaladaptive strategy where it kind of\ngets you out of some problems but then\nkind of keeps you stuck and then you\nsort of have to grow out of that and\nsome people do and some people don't\nit's very hard to make people understand\nthat um maladaptive strategies are\nusually incredibly effective up to a\npoint\num and this is probably true of all as a\nmusician going through college you can\nlearn to play something in a bad way but\nit works really well but eventually you\nhit a wall where you can't improve your\nTechnique be on a point because you're\nnot really doing it correctly but then\nthe difficult thing about getting rid of\na maladaptive behavior is it always\nrequires you to regress in terms of\nwhatever skill you're doing before you\ncan make progress again which makes it\nso difficult to move people out of\nmaladaptive habits yeah one of my\nsupervisors once told me that the\nprocess of growing up is discarding\nthings that work\nsure\nthat have worked up until a point right\nexactly right so so it it's you know at\nthe age of 20 or at the age of 30\nit sounds like you're discovering that\nhey friction maybe isn't all that bad\nsure yeah right and and so I think it's\nI think it's oftentimes it's their\nexperience of things that got them out\nright and then the the problem is that\nif believing in a particular philosophy\nhelped you advance in so many objective\nways why are you going to give that\nphilosophy up yeah\nyeah for sure yeah if I stop doing this\nthen I'm going to go back to where I was\nand I certainly don't want to be there\nyeah yeah and like you said\nunfortunately well fortunately\nunfortunate like any any cult any red\npill any super left wing whatever like\neverything is probably going to improve\nyou in some way otherwise nobody would\njoin right even multi-level marketing\nschemes are going to have people super\nmotivated and probably picking up some\nkind of good habits in the beginning so\ntalking people down from those things\nespecially if people found those things\nbecause they were hurting they were in a\nbad place\num is is it's very very difficult to\nimpossible to talk somebody down from\nthat without them going through a lot of\nexperiences themselves uh to realize why\nit might not be the best way to\nto go through life yeah yeah\num\nI love it when you talk about woo stuff\nyeah me too\nthat's probably been a big change over\nthe past well I hate I'm gonna trigger\nyou now because this is my shortcut\nprobably doing a really big mushroom\ntrip like three or four years ago it has\nuh probably opened me up a little bit\nmore to uh more macro level analysis of\nthings\num to where sometimes\num almost in a way earlier how you said\nthat like the brain and mental health is\nlike relational to other people in some\nways like all parts of your life are\nprobably a bit relational and you can\ntake somebody that knows all the studies\nand has like the hyper discrete analysis\nof every single part of your life that's\ntrying to like min max everything versus\nsomebody who might believe in some you\nknow Silly religion or Karma blah blah\nblah and that person is actually doing\nway better because that overarching view\njust tends to connect things in such a\nsimple beautiful elegant way that works\nfor them rather than the guy who's like\nokay well I ate two more carbs today\nthan I was supposed to and I didn't blah\nblah blah blah you know so I'm getting I\nhave a much bigger appreciation now for\nthe macro level things and rather than\ntrying to view it as like a discrete\nversus macro what I try to do is like\nokay well here's like a big macro\nwoo-woo thing and it seems to work for a\nlot of people so instead of discarding\nthat and starting over why not find out\nlike well what are the things in here\nthat are probably working for everybody\nand like what can you learn from that\nand take from that and maybe apply it to\nyour own life or maybe like study\ndiscreetly you know\nwhat I'm curious about is why why would\nyou saying that be triggering for me\num\noh because we um oh because mushrooms\nwas probably a bit of a shortcut rather\nthan a whole bunch of introspection or\nI mean so so mushrooms So speaking of\nchanging my tune or changing Tunes so I\nthink there's a lot of very good\nsupportive data around\nthe use of psychedelics for all kinds of\nstuff and and we know that these are\nsubstances that have been used in\nspiritual traditions for like thousands\nof years\num and I I don't think that I mean I\nthink it's all part of your path yeah\nsure right and and\num do you think that is so so you\nmentioned earlier that you think you\nhave become a better person and I'm\nsorry if I'm misquoting you but that's\nwhat I thought I heard I hope I said\nthat yeah um I hope I'm always becoming\na better person yeah yeah I I see that\nin you I'm not quite sure how or why but\nI I see a lot of and I hope that's not\nlike condescending or arrogant to say\nbut I really respect a lot of the\na lot of what you've become I think you\nwere always a piece of it but something\nabout it seems more potent and more\ndriven and more helpful\nto the people around you\noh well thanks I appreciate it and I\nthink if if mushrooms the one thing to\njust be careful about is that I I don't\nknow exactly what your circumstances\nwere but I think one of the things that\nwe're starting to see in the data is\nthat\nit's not the substance itself\nnecessarily it's the circumstances\naround the substance that lead to a\npositive outcome or a bad outcome\num so there are you know bad outcomes\nfrom people tripping I've certainly seen\nthat a lot clinically where if you're in\na really dark place you want some kind\nof Revelation and then the trip goes the\nwrong way and then you kind of end up\nwith like PTSD or something like that\nsure or the birth of an anxiety disorder\nbut we also know that psychedelic\nassisted I mean psychedelic assisted\nPsychotherapy and even spiritual\nexperiences when couched in sort of safe\nspiritual Traditions seem to have\npositive and transformative experiences\nfor people\nguide rails around them I view I used to\nargue with my wife about this a lot of\nyou travel actually in the same way a\nlot of people say things like travel is\nso good for you it makes you a better\nperson psychedelics is so good for you\nto make you a better person it's like it\ncould or it couldn't just it's like a\ntool right sometimes people can travel\naround the world and become like way\nmore exposed to different cultures and\npeople and like really flesh out and\nwell-round their opinion about Humanity\nor you could like do the total opposite\nof that depending on how you utilize it\nbut it just kind of depends on yeah\neverything is like I have a very\ninstrumental approach to these types of\nthings you can use them to grow and\nlearn or you can just goof off and have\nfun or you can probably use them in a\nway that's detrimental to your uh you\nknow mental health or your progress as a\nperson yeah one of my friends who's a\npsychiatrist one of he's a he's a big\nproponent of the use of psychedelics and\none of the interesting things that he\nkind of mentioned that he's a little bit\nconcerned about is that\num at least in the U.S these are quickly\nbecoming medicalized\nhe thinks that while they have\ntherapeutic value in a medical setting\nthat they have value outside of a\nmedical setting as well in terms of like\ngrowth and spiritual traditions and\nthings like that which I thought was a\nreally interesting point yeah\num I definitely agree I do think that um\nto Loop a little bit back to the mental\nhealth thing\num I do think that our lifestyles are\nlike very incompatible with healthy\nMinds in general I think that our world\nis selecting is hyper selecting for a\nvery very very narrow group of a certain\ntype of mind and then everything else is\nbeing pathologized or left to the\nWayside and that as that narrows more\nand more I think we're probably going to\nsee more and more mental health issues\npop up I just said more like 30 times\nbut like sedentary like right now we're\nselecting for people like me I guess\nsedentary lifestyle can sit in front of\na monitor for a long time\num doesn't get RSI uh is happy and likes\nbeing in front of a computer screen uh\nand does that like all day and if you're\nif you're anybody that like if you'd\nlike to spend more time outside if you\nneed to move more if you do whatever it\nfeels like the world is becoming\nincreasingly incompatible for a large\nnumber of people and then we're seeing\nthat bleed out into a lot of different\nmental health things so it feels like a\nyou're fighting a really tough uphill\nbattle against really like all of\nsociety when you're trying to help\npeople like get into a healthy mental\nstate when you're living in this world\nwith social media and computers and\nsedentary Lifestyles and unhealthy food\nand everything it seems very difficult\nyeah I I sort of agree I mean I think\nthat I agree with sort of your premise\nbut I I don't think that the world so\nthe world is pushing people towards a\nsedentary lifestyle but I don't think\nthat a sedentary lifestyle makes people\nsuccessful\nso I I think even even this conversation\nI think is a good example of one thing\nthat we've got going for us is that the\nrate of change is rapidly increasing\nand so this is one of the reasons why\ntechnology has has infected every part\nof our life yeah but I also think that\nour ability to change back or tackle\ntechnology is faster than it's ever been\nbefore\nso if we kind of think about the Advent\nof streaming right streaming got big\nwhat like 10 15 years ago and we already\nhave whole scale appreciation in the\nfield about the mental health impacts of\nstreaming so we're going to twitchcon\nVidCon and all kinds of other cons where\nthese platforms are inviting us to speak\nabout\nlike Creator mental health and and how\nto build healthy relationships with\ntechnology and and things like that\nthat's why we're going to the American\nPsychiatric association so I think even\nif you look at things like covid I mean\nwe had a we had a novel illness rip\nthrough our world population and\nincrease the mortality in a way that\nwe've never seen before and within two\nyears we had a vaccine whereas we still\ndon't have vaccines for HIV or or herpes\nvirus or all kinds of other things that\nhave been around for a long time\nand so I I'm I'm a little bit optimistic\nbecause I think people just because it's\nhard the reason I think it's hard is\nbecause we have not taught human beings\nhow to resist the impulses of Technology\nyeah the thing that scares me the most\nis I think that um I think we're very\nvery very good at\nsolving problems that have like money\nbehind them we're so good at that\num you know a huge proponent of\ncapitalism we're very very good at\nallocating money to solving problems\nthat have Financial rewards\num and as individuals we get pretty good\nat optimizing for either Financial\nRewards or immediate happiness but um it\ndoesn't seem like there's very much\nreward for like teaching people how to\nhave better friendships or relationships\nor it's it's more tenuous to find that\nreward and so I guess I just worry that\nI don't know if Society is incentivized\nto solve those issues because it's\neasier to temporarily alleviate you know\nsomebody's unhappiness you know with\nanother Tick Tock video than it is to\nlike teach somebody how to like Truly\nfind happiness or fulfillment in life\nyeah I mean I I I I don't think you were\nI don't disagree with anything that you\nsaid but I come to a slightly different\nconclusion I think I'd guess the way I'd\nput it as I'm less pessimistic okay\num I mean so for example two days ago or\nyesterday the Surgeon General of the\nUnited States released a report on\nloneliness and connection as like a new\npublic health problem so I think that\nand this is just what we've seen is that\nso so for example we're doing an\nanalysis of of we worked with about 400\ncreators and what we found is that\nhelping people be mentally healthy\nimproves their stream performance\nroughly we're still analyzing the data\nand so I think what we're quickly\ndiscovering is a society so now mental\nillness has surpassed cardiovascular\ndisease and cancer in terms of being the\nmost costly to society it's a cost of\nmorbidity and mortality is like way\nhigher\nfor mental illness so I think what was\nfor good or For Worse even if I agree\nwith your premise that we're sensitive\nto things that make us money or create\nvalue is what I would say I think we're\nquickly discovering from an economic\nstandpoint that like\nhelping people be happy we sort of\ndiscovered this with remote work right\noh my God there's going to be\nproductivity costs no actually when you\ndon't have to commute an hour each way\nto work people are just as productive\nnow there are other forces that are\nmoving against that like commercial real\nestate apparently is about to collapse\nor is in the process of collapsing and\nthings like that so you have you have\nother kinds of interests where people\nare pushing to come back to work\nbut I mean I think that you know there's\nbeen a even if if people push to come\nback to work I think 20 of the the\npopulace is going to be you know\nworking from home something I'm kind of\ncurious about I don't know if you have\nstrong opinions on this um the way that\nI viewed work from home is I view work\nfrom home as a as an as a\nis like an augmenter to whatever\nDirection you were going so for instance\nif you are somebody that had like a\npretty decent social life and then work\nfrom home came out for you it's like\nimproved your life in so many different\nways now you've got more time for your\nfamily you've got more time for friends\nyou have to waste much time working you\ndon't have to commute thank God it's\nlike a godsend\num but if you're a work from home person\nand your life before was that kind of\nlonely and shitty now it's like even\nmore lonely and shitty now you don't\neven see like the Barista in the morning\nyou don't even see co-workers physically\nthat there might be people that live in\none to two rooms for weeks at a time of\ntheir life and the only person they see\nis maybe the doordash or Uber Eats guy\nif they catch them after they drop the\nfood off but otherwise it's just like a\ndark room with black curtains and no\nit's nothing\ngenerally good for everybody or do you\nthink there's like the good and the bad\ndepending on like the type of person\ngoing into it yeah I think\nthe exception of things like water and\nsleep\nI think there are very few things that\nare good for everybody so one of the\nbiggest problems I see in Western\nSociety is that we assume human beings\nare the same\nright so when we even when we come up\nwith stuff like okay how many calories\nshould you eat a day that's not any kind\nof scientific study of like individual\nhumans the way that we arrived at 2 000\ncalories a day is we surveyed a bunch of\npeople and we took all the people who\nwere not sick\nand then we asked them how many calories\ndid you eat we averaged that number and\nwe made a recommendation for everybody\nsure so I think work from home is sort\nof the same way where I'm with you that\nit's going to work for some people it's\nnot going to work for other people but I\nthink this is where on balance I think\nwork from home is a good thing but what\nit's uncovered is that there are some\npeople who relied on work to be a\nsubstitute for social interaction or or\neven like delivering value in the\nworkplace yeah there's a lot of panic\namongst the middle manager level whose\nprimary job it was was to keep people\nfocused and on task and some of them are\nlike fluff pieces where it turns out\nactually we may not need you yeah which\nis really terrifying for them like the\noffice space what exactly do you do here\nwhatever yeah exactly right and and so I\nI think we need to adapt and this is\nwhere\nyou know I think like this is where like\nwe make some adaptations that I'm not a\nhuge fan of like okay let's have like a\nzoom happy hour and and that's cool in\nsome ways and it's not you know I think\nit's like sort of a step in the right\ndirection but I think we need kind of an\noverhaul of first of all like education\nwe need to train people\nin how to understand control and protect\ntheir mind I think that should be a core\npart of Education\nyeah and then I think I wish yeah\noh yeah I was gonna say I I wish for\nEducation if I could throw like two\nclasses on like a basic philosophy class\nand like a basic uh psychology class\nlike one to understand how to just\nstructure like arguments and thoughts\nand then the other to kind of like\nunderstand the limitations of your own\nmind uh just like those two things there\nare a lot of other things I would if I\ncould but God I wish education like\nprepared you a little bit more to enter\nthe world like as a human being and not\njust a like a workplace machine you know\nyeah I mean I think it's it's what's\nreally bizarre is that we actually have\nsome really interesting data there was a\nstudy I think done in New York where\nthey uh took 12 000 kids and randomized\nthem to two groups one group has a\nsocial and emotional skills training\nclass\nand if I remember correctly what they\nfound is that social emotional skills\ntraining is worth 11 points on your\ngrades so it's worth a full ladder grade\nof performance\nand so I think we're there's there's\nbits of data\nthat really suggests that taking care of\npeople's mental health or physical\nhealth\nis worth it in a nutshell yeah and that\nthere's an Roi I think just institutions\nare you know a little bit slow to really\ncatch on yeah because again if you don't\nhave there's not like a direct benefit\neven individuals I'll notice will do\nthis individuals will burn their candle\nat both ends when it comes to their\nmental health because they don't\nactually see them losing dollars from it\nand they don't see like all the negative\nways that it manifests in their life\nthey just have no care whatsoever and\nit's like there was um I don't know if I\nbrought this up before there was a funny\nthought experiment I ran through with a\nfriend a long time ago\num she was debating between two\napartments and because she [ __ ] hated\nher current roommate but the problem is\nthe other apartment that she was gonna\nget was like 300 a month more than the\none that she was living in now but she\ndidn't know the money was worth it but\nshe hated her current limit and I\nremember asking her I was like imagine\nlike I think like an hour in those\nconversations like if if you could pay\nten dollars like a day to just like get\nrid of this person and not have to deal\nwith me and if she answers like before I\neven finished it like yeah obviously\nlike I would give you 70 bucks for\ntonight and I was like yeah why the [ __ ]\nwould you just moved into different\nplaces it's obviously worth the money\nbut um we have such a hard time\nconceptualizing like mental Agony or\nmental pain that we will just burn it\naway a in exchange for a little bit of\nlike physical tangible goods or value\nyeah it's hilarious there's a really\ninteresting study if you look at Asian\nAmericans who go into therapy\none of the most common thoughts I don't\nknow if I could say the most common\nthought is the cost per minute\nthat they're incurring\nin therapy so they're like okay how much\ndo especially if you look at adolescents\nand young adults they'll be like how\nmuch are my parents they're losing like\nfive dollars a minute\nfor a one-hour session and am I getting\nfive dollars a minute worth of value out\nof this therapy session\nand and there's there's really\nfascinating if you look at the heat of\nthe way you framed it there are actually\nstudies that show if you heard of this\nthing called a a quality life year\num no but it sounds similar to health\nspan versus lifespan if this is where\nyou're going to happen so you know like\ninsurance and actuaries when when like\nlet's say like you lose a leg okay yeah\nhow much money is Leg Worth\nand people will come up with numbers in\nthe way that they figure out how much a\nleg is worth is they'll ask people\nquestions like would you rather live to\n80 with two legs or 70 with one leg or\nsorry 80 with one leg or 70 with two\nlegs and and like what would you pick\nwould you rather live to 80 with one leg\nor 70 with two legs\nwhat do you think oh you're asking me\num\noh man how how is the rest of my health\nis this all else equal yeah all else\nequal all else equal I'd I'll give me\nthe one leg and the ten years more of\nlife okay assuming that but I'm\nincorporating that Health span versus\nassuming I'm having a healthy 10 years I\ndon't want to be on [ __ ] hospice for\nthe last decade of my life with one leg\nbut if somebody's healthy yeah I would\nsay I probably I'd probably do one like\nyeah are we saying losing the leg right\nnow or are we losing the leg when I'm 40\nor something no you're losing the light\nnow\noh [ __ ] okay right damn it okay you're\nputting me on the spot I'd have to think\nabout it more yeah I probably opt for\nthe 10 or two years okay 10x three years\nokay so what about 75 years with two\nlegs\nor 80 with one one leg\nyou know what man five years\nare we losing this leg all the way up to\nthe waist or we like knee down or how\nmuch of this leg are we losing so this\nis exactly the point so this is how they\ncalculate how much half of your leg is\nworth\nbecause if we ask enough of those\nquestions okay you lose the whole leg\nokay you just lose your ankle sure lose\nyour leg below the knee and it turns out\nthat if you ask human beings questions\nthe same way that you were asking that\nperson is this worth ten dollars a day\nthat's how you figure out how much your\nleg is worth and what's interesting is\nthe time discounting everything going on\nhere in our minds though I feel like it\nwould\nI feel like we wouldn't be able to\naccurately gauge it like we might say it\nnow but I'm sure at a different point in\ntime we'd probably have a different\nfeeling about it one of the things that\nI forgot no no I mean that's true but go\nahead I was going to say one of the big\nthings this comes up is\num constantly one thing that young\npeople say a lot is if I ever get\nAlzheimer's disease kill me immediately\ndon't ever I don't ever have other just\nkill me can we come here like people\nwill say that relentlessly is a younger\nperson but I no personally my mom is\nAlzheimer's disease her mom did and I my\ngram my other Grandma had dementia\num so I'm speaking from limited\nexperience but I've also never heard\nthis before I've never heard of a person\nI'm sure there are a few but in general\nAlzheimer's people seem to exist day to\nday they've got really good moments and\nunfortunately they have increasingly bad\nmoments but it's quite rare I think that\nsomebody like Midway into the disease\nlike just kill me I want to die right\nnow right even if it's a younger person\nthey might have said that I don't know\nif like when you're actually there you\nfeel the same way so I guess all of that\nto say that a 75 year old person with\ntwo legs who's now looking at five more\npotential years with grandchildren or\ngreat grandchild children are a cool new\nthing that just came out it's not like\n[ __ ] actually I wish I would have given\nup the leg I think I do want to live for\nfive more years this isn't worth it yeah\nthis is what I was getting at yeah yeah\nI mean I think that there's also good\ndata to support this idea that human\nbeings\ngrossly underestimate their ability\ntheir resilience and their ability to\nfind happiness in a particular\ncircumstance so that's there's strong\ndata to support that and then\nunfortunately I think there are a lot of\npeople with Alzheimer's who who you know\ndo\nwant to end it okay I think it's there's\na there's a variance right sure because\nwe also know that that especially it's\nstarting to get to the very late stages\nI'm sure it obviously it looks like\npretty horrifying yeah yeah I mean some\npeople and it depends on what what\ncauses the the form of dementia but\noftentimes because you're losing just\nyou know you have atrophy of the brain\nand then as you have atrophy of the\nbrain sometimes are more primitive\nnegative emotions actually dominate so\nour brain has a bias towards negative\nemotions over positive emotions so\nyou'll see some some very like\nneurologically oriented depression\nreally start to emerge sure\num one of the things you mentioned\nearlier before this that humans are very\nresilient is I think um even in the case\nof losing Limbs and stuff or becoming\nparalyzed I think that human General uh\nwell-being like it it stabilizes like\nvery quickly in a very surprising way I\nwant to say there's even a study that\nshows that people with locked in\nsyndrome can have like a decent quality\nof life which is like unfathomable to a\nperson with like the use of all their\nlimbs and everything so yeah yeah I\nhaven't seen things specifically on\nlockdown syndrome but that's you know\nquite severe and quite rare but yeah I\nthink we definitely know that\nyou know human beings who get paralyzed\nand stuff will oftentimes find\nthat they're okay with it and that\nthey're resilient\num and the other really interesting\nthing is\nthe the degree of insight correlates\nwith how okay you are so interestingly\nenough the highest risk of suicide is\nfor people who have really bad\nconditions that they understand very\nquickly\nso that they understand very quickly\nlike they understand how bad the\ncondition is or what do you mean yep so\nso so interestingly enough if you learn\nabout the ramifications of your illness\nslowly you are less likely to commit\nsuicide so it basically gives you kind\nof time to adjust as the simplest thing\nabout it whereas as people who so for\nexample if you look at like a\nneurologist who gets diagnosed with ALS\nor something like they may have the\ndegree of the degree of of insight seems\nto correlate with with\nhow much or how little you want to live\nand just if you hang out for a while if\nyou if time is on your side then people\nadjust\nwhich is generally speaking why we you\nknow tried really really really hard to\nhelp people with who have Suicidal\nTendencies because I know it sounds\nreally bizarre and people feel like this\nis going to last forever but it almost\nnever does\nyeah oh that's like why the thing for\nthe suicide hotline like people make fun\nof it because like who's gonna like fix\nyour whole life in a phone call I was\nlike oftentimes people just need like\ntwo minutes to just pause and think and\nusually they have like a change of heart\nyou know if they're given like a little\nbit of\num a little bit of time to just like\nstop and reconsider you know\nyeah there's a whole problem there about\none of the biggest mistakes that I think\npeople make is when there's a\ncircumstance that\nmakes you feel a certain way we assume\nthat the solution to that is to fix the\ncircumstance\nright so kind of like what you said how\nis a phone call to the suicide hotline\ngonna fix anything about my life and\nthis kind of goes back I was saying\nearlier where I think this is a\nconsequence of us seeding control of our\ninternal Tranquility to external\ncircumstances yeah\nyeah I think what we've almost like lost\nas a society is the acknowledgment that\neven if my life is bad there are ways to\ndevelop\nTranquility in the face of that\nadversity\nyeah if you if you hear a dog barking in\nan apartment complex and you want to\ngrab a machine gun and start killing\npeople and you're thinking like okay\nwell the solution to this problem is\nobviously to make the person get rid of\nthe dog well that's probably not the\nsolution the solution is probably you\nneed to find a better way to deal with\nthat external stimulus so that it\ndoesn't make you feel the way that it\ndoes right yeah\nand and and that that I think that uh\nthat example I think is Extreme in in\none way and I think the real tragedy is\nthat oftentimes when I work with people\nwho are like in abusive situations\nwhen I'm feeling terrible about myself\nbecause someone is abusing me I think\nthis is a maybe a slightly more\nprovocative statement but the way that\nyou feel about yourself this is what I\nreally see when I work with people with\ntrauma is the discovery that oh the way\nthat I feel about myself has nothing to\ndo with the way that other people treat\nme\nbut even if I'm abused I can feel good\nabout myself which is a really tricky\nthing to say because it almost puts the\nresponsibility on the person but what I\nreally noticed in in trauma therapy is\nthat empowering the patient is one of\nthe most important steps that actually\nthere are things in your life that you\ndo control\nand you can't control what people do to\nyou but you have some Iota some tiny\namount of control and the more that you\nbuild on that the more that you grow on\nthat and this is how people end up\nleaving abusive relationships because\nthey feel like they're not in control\nyeah you just have to thread that needle\nincredibly carefully yeah people that\nhave trauma or traumatic responses\nabsolutely yeah if you tell them they\ncan have any responsibility over their\nmind you can send them down to a\ndepressive spiral they're like oh well\n[ __ ] so not only do it not only is\nsomebody abusing me I'm also a [ __ ]\nidiot because I didn't realize that I\ncould just like think my way to write\nsomething like even more like mind\n[ __ ] on it yeah that's really yeah so\nthat's a really important needle the\nthread and I think a big part of how you\nwalk that tightrope is\nthis is true of tomorrow but was not\ntrue of yesterday you did not have the\ncapability to break free of this\nsituation but from this point forward\nthere is one moment maybe one grain of\nsand that you can move there's some tiny\namount of control so I'm with you that\nthat creates a pitfall where then people\nbecause because of the low self-esteem\nthey're going to blame themselves why\ncouldn't I figure this out earlier\nand then I think there's that reminds me\nthe binary thing I said earlier where\num and obviously there's huge\ndiscussions over personal responsibility\nrelated to like sexual assault or\nabusive situations or other types of\nthings where there's like it's very hard\nfor people to accept that like that like\none is you could take more\nresponsibility for yourself and there\nare things you can do to avoid negative\nsituations but two that doesn't mean\nit's your fault that something happened\nto you and it doesn't excuse the person\nthat did whatever thing they did to you\nyou know like you can lock your car door\nor you can forget to lock your car door\neither way it's not right for somebody\nto steal your [ __ ] but that doesn't mean\nthere aren't steps you can take to like\navoid it in the future and it doesn't\nmean that it was your fault that it\nhappened before because you didn't take\nthose steps on the past you know but um\nyeah all of that is those are very very\nvery very very careful conversations to\nwalk there without yeah I feel like\nyou're falling too hard on one side yeah\nI think it's it's especially hard\nbecause what we were talking about\nearlier when things are emotionally\ncharged it's hard to see those Shades of\nGray yeah but I I mean I think\nempowerment of victims is one of the\nmost important steps at least in my\nlimited clinical experience and just\nlike you said it doesn't it's not your\nfault if you grew up in an abusive\nsituation you have no power in that\nmoment you know and and I think so much\nof actually what we see\num we're thinking about doing a deep\ndive on trauma and one of the things\nthat I've started to really appreciate\nis so many of the problems that we see\nin today's society I think are actually\nlike stealth manifestations of trauma\neven even things like lack of motivation\nand stuff it's really fascinating if you\nlook into the trauma literature about\nhow\nif you grow up in an environment where\nyou were controlled by another human\nbeing\nyou stop your brain does not develop the\ncapacity to see the future which all the\nstuff we were talking about about you\nknow like a lack of a long term it's\nlike literally because what's the point\nof thinking about tomorrow when you\ndon't get to decide anything ever yeah\nyou don't get to decide what you eat you\ndon't get to decide what you wear you\ndon't get to decide what you do\nand so it's almost like that part of our\nbrain kind of like gets shut off and\nwe're not able to think about the future\nand so people end up living this very\nreactive life where it's like okay I\nfeel like eating something healthy today\nor sitting at home and playing a video\ngame and it's really challenging because\nI think they blame themselves for this\nlack of motivation they know they should\nbe doing something different\nbut they literally grew up in a\nsituation of coercive control where this\nhas been there's I read this paper\nthat's 60 years old about the paralysis\nof initiation is it really a term that\nlike old people who are studying like\npow\nfolks discovered\nand then what they also discovered is oh\nthis stuff that happens with prisoners\nof War because you don't know if you're\ngoing to be alive tomorrow so what's the\npoint of thinking about the future might\nas well live for today and then they\ndiscover that even kids in abusive\nrelationships have the same pattern and\nthat this pattern is actually pretty\npervasive in traumatic situations anyway\nI'm going off yeah but no yeah it makes\nsense yeah and there's probably a lot of\nGeneral stuff you can learn\num I don't know if I mentioned this in\nthe past but there was um a friend that\nI had that I was like helping her with\nsome of her therapy sessions to like\nhelp reinforce like positive behaviors\nand it's funny because there are some\nthings that\num she was learning in therapy that they\nwere giving her that I thought were\nincredibly helpful tools that I wish\npeople had told me I was like oh [ __ ]\nthis is actually a really good idea\nthat's actually where I got the force\nsomebody to go on a walk idea from was\nthat\num and then another thing had to do with\num uh one was the concept of radical\nacceptance which I thought was sounds\nstupid to me but then I tried it I was\nlike this isn't stupid at all this is\nactually pretty important yeah and then\nthe third one was keeping track of your\nemotional state and then not trying to\never resolve problems they used a one to\nseven scale and if you thought that you\nwere at like a four or higher you don't\nsolve any problems there you use a\ncoping strategy or something go on a\nwalk watch your face do whatever until\nyour emotional levels come down and then\nyou reapproach the problem but never try\nto solve like when you're like a five\nsix seven\num and those are things that I don't\nthink they teach normal people that was\nlike a mental health for\num other stuff but I thought it was\nfunny that like I feel like I'm learning\nreally important skills here and I\ndidn't even have like the mental health\nissue you know yeah yeah I mean I think\nthat's that's where we see that 11 Point\nbump for social and emotional skills\ntraining it's that kind of stuff yeah\nand there's also what's interesting is\nthat you know treatment I think some of\nthe best treatment for ADHD is actually\nlike organization and planning and\nproductivity kind of stuff which\nlike when I was learning how to help\npatients with it like it helped me a lot\ntoo in terms of staying organized and\nfocused and stuff but\nanyway I know we sort of talked about\ntalking for a couple hours how are you\nfeeling\nyeah I'm good I stream for 10 hours a\nday so okay as long as yeah my voice is\nstarting to go out a little bit so I was\nhoping we could wrap up in about five to\n15 minutes I love talking to you but\nyeah\num how do you stream for like 10 hours a\nday dude probably practice\nbecause I've been doing it for a long\ntime so I'm probably used to it right\nyeah\noh something you mentioned earlier that\nI thought is really cool you guys do\num when it comes to like picking up\ngirls or relationship stuff or because\nthat's like what a lot of the dating\nstuff talks about people always like\nwhat's like the best practice for it\num something kind of sucks is that like\nthe best practice for it is honestly\nit's having lots of friends that are\ngirls from like the ages of like 10 to\n18 because when you have a lot of that\nexperience you can develop it\norganically everybody's kind of like\nawkward and weird and you can make\nmistakes and it's all like this big\nlearning process and you get so much\nSocial practice growing up but once\nyou've left that Arena if you've left\nthat Arena without that practice poof\nlearning that past 18 or past 22 is very\nvery very challenging so earlier when\nyou mentioned that you had an event\nwhere it's like practicing like asking\npeople out or whatever yeah that's a\nreally positive like doing things like\nthat is I think a really good stepping\nstone to building that social Acumen or\nwhatever yeah\nyeah I mean I think that's that all\ncredit goes to our our Discord mods for\nlike organizing that event and stuff and\nso we have this event called Social\nSandbox which is exactly what it is it's\na Sandbox where you can practice social\nskills and what we tend to find is like\neven in in places like our career\ncoaching program and stuff like that\nwhat we found is that giving people the\nopportunity to role play conversations\nright so if you're asking for something\nlike a promotion or you know you want to\nwork from home one day\nwe don't practice those conversations\nyeah and so when you go into the\nconversation and even sort of doing\nwe'll try to do and on Discord and stuff\nlike these different kind of reverse\nrole plays and stuff like that where\nokay so now I'm gonna play you and I'm\ngonna ask for the promotion and you play\nyour boss and you see how it feels\nbecause you're so worried oh my God my\nboss is gonna get pissed if I ask for\nmore money well why don't you listen to\nwhat I say and then you see do you feel\npissed off that I'm asking or does it\nsound good not good people like practice\nit right and we sort of do this so like\nin some areas like where you'll practice\nfor Medical School interviews or you'll\npractice for residency and things like\nthat we have some of these places where\nthis is baked in but the more digital\nour society is becoming the more I'm\nfinding that you need intentional like\nmakeup times yeah\nwhere it's not organic and the\ninteresting thing is that if you really\nlook at it you may say and this is what\na lot of the the people who struggle\nwith like dating and have some of these\ninsult beliefs there's a core aspect of\nmissed Milestones where you think that\nokay I didn't date anyone in high school\ntherefore I can't have a girlfriend in\ncollege there for whatever but if you\nlook at human beings the cool thing is\nthat eight years of organic learning can\noftentimes be replaced by six months of\nintentional learning\nso I can grow up speaking language but\nif I sit if I do some kind of immersive\nlike language thing for six months like\nI can become fluent yeah\nyeah for sure because there's a there's\na saying that like it's not practice\nmakes perfect it's perfect practice\nmakes perfect so going into something\nwith like an intentional mindset and\npracticing with deliberate practice is\nprobably going to be more efficient even\nthan like the natural like 8 to 15 years\nof like social practice we get right\nthat's sloppy in yeah I mean that's so\ntrue that's why people can play League\nof Legends for 10 years and be at the\nsame rank\nokay I think we're done here is there\nanything else you need was that is that\na dig it wasn't today\nI'm like I'm getting worse than DOTA\nevery year so it's it's certainly that's\nour aging genetics okay or you just once\nyou hit 30 you're just pass over the\nwall you know\none last thing I did see this study\nreally interesting there's one cognitive\nflexibility is the only mental capacity\nit's not focus or attention or anything\nlike that that correlates with rank in\nLeague of Legends cognitive flexibility\ninteresting what does that mean\num\nthe ability to be cognitively flexible\nso if you have a Believer yeah being\nable to challenge that belief right so I\nlost this game because my teammates suck\nand being able to challenge that belief\nand asking yourself what could I do\ndifferently\nor even\nchallenging oh what could I have done\ndifferently actually I lost this game\nbecause honestly I played pretty well\nand\nuh my teammates really through\noh sure exactly the ability to be\ncognitively flexible no kind of makes\nsense yeah\none thing I like I feel like the general\ntrend of research is um I feel like even\ngrowing up in the 90s and 2000s I feel\nlike I was like there's so much\ninformation about brain plasticity and\nhow it basically stops when you're like\n27 and you can't learn new things and\nyou're if you don't learn a language at\nthat age you're basically completely\nscrewed I mean it feels like as I've\ngotten older it feels like we are\nradically changing our views of\nplasticity and it has more to do with\nlike how active your mind stays through\num like later stages of your life and\nthat somebody can have a lot of like\nplasticity in their 50s 60s 70s as long\nas you don't just like repeat the same\nroutine every single day never see any\nnew information and never pick up a new\ntask\nyeah so there's all kinds of new stuff\nso we actually I think I we have a video\nabout coming out about this or maybe\nit's already out but it's really\ninteresting why people don't learn from\ntheir mistakes\nso there's a really fascinating uh paper\nin nature where they were looking at\nrats and what they did is they\nso there's there's this experiment where\nyou have like a a bucket of water and\nsubmerged in the bucket of water is a\nplatform which you can't see but is\nthere so they drop a rat in a bucket of\nwater and the rat Panic starts swimming\naround and eventually figures out where\nthe platform is so the rat learns okay\nthis is where a safe spot is if you drop\ndrop the rat in the bucket again over\ntime it goes straight to the platform\nthen it doesn't even have a stress\nresponse it's like okay we're back here\nthis is where I'm chilling yeah so then\nwhat they do is they mix things up on\nthe wrap they move the location of the\nplatform\nand what they discover is that some rats\nkeep going to the old platform and they\npanic because it's no longer there some\nrats are cognitively flexible and can\nfigure out okay the old platform isn't\nthere this is where the new platform is\nand they learn quickly\nso really interesting so in terms of\nplasticity we used to think that\nplasticity was a function of age yeah\nwhat we now know is that the most\nimportant variable for those rats to\nlearn something new is their glucose\nlevel and whether they were in a fasting\nstate\nif you're in a caloric restriction the\nrats learned very quickly and if the\nrats were fed well they learned very\nvery slowly interesting and so one of\nthe biggest things that's really\ninteresting because if you think about\nthe brain when does the brain\nevolutionarily need to discard what it\nlearned\nwhen we're starving because when we're\nstarving the stuff that we used to do no\nlonger works\nand so if you kind of think about it why\ndo people today not learn from their\nmistakes why are people hard stuck on\nBronze in League of Legends because\nthere's no caloric consequence so the\nliterally the way that our brain is\nwired to learn new things and this has\nbeen correlated with neurogenesis in the\nhippocampus which is making new neurons\nis if we are in a starvation State and\nspecifically the most important signal\nfor that starvation state is glucose\nwhich is part of the reason why I think\nall these keto diets and all this crap\nis like being very very positive right\nnow because we're discovering that if I\nget to like eat carbohydrates and I play\nLeague of Legends every day I'm actually\nnot going to get better\nokay you even see this like league in\nthe future I need to do it while I'm\nfasting yeah so a fasting state will\ninduce neurogenesis literally fasting\ninduces neurogenesis neurogenesis is\ncorrelated with cognitive flexibility\nthose are kind of similar and cognitive\nflexibility literally there have been\nthere are studies that show or one study\nthat shows that that correlates with\nRank and law\ninteresting\nreally bizarre and this is why also if\nyou look at Esports teams like they'll\nhire chefs who will feed their players\nlike really healthy food because it\ncorrelates with performance Improvement\nyeah\nhuh yeah so you're right by the way this\nis why I mean so Stephen what I really\nrespect about you man is like so many of\nyour woo-woo ideas are like spot on\nit's really cool\nI appreciate it thank you very much I\nwould encourage you to to not be afraid\nto put them on paper and beholden to\nthem because you may be more you're kind\nof talking about okay well what if in\nthe future I changed my mind what I\nthink would be super cool is the\npredictive capability of what you put on\npaper\nyeah I agree yeah yeah there are some\nlike I said there are a few they're like\nfour or five things that I kind of like\nhold on to that I think have been\nrelatively true through time but um I'll\nhopefully keep adding to that list as\ntime goes on yeah yeah cool man\nwell thank you very much for talking\ntoday yeah thanks for having me good\nluck with all of your uh\nyour podcasts and stuff yeah hopefully\nin a\nhopefully in a month or two maybe I'm\nback on Twitch we'll see if they unban\nme my next appeal comes up\num but otherwise yeah if you ever want\nto do toxicos you can always shoot me a\ndamn and we can cut it up on or chop it\nup on YouTube and yeah yeah cool man\ntake care and thank you very much and\ngood luck with everything yeah thanks a\nlot I will talk to you sometime later\nhave fun adios man bye\nnope let's go well I'm trying to figure\nout\nthere we go\nalrighty\num actually let me just ask him if he's\nstreaming\nuh because then we can rate him\nthat was great so I love talking to\nDestiny super cool dude and I'm honestly\nI'm amazed at uh okay\num so we're gonna we're gonna go his way\nin a second but if you if y'all want to\nwe can take a look at this real quick\num let's see if I can find this\num\nnope\nhe literature\nyou guys want to see this real quick so\nwe've got a video coming out about this\nif you guys have not seen it already\num but\nuh\nlooks like\nyeah it looks like our our thing doesn't\nwork but there's a\nthere really is a paper so so y'all\ny'all will hopefully see this in in the\nvideo so we've got a video coming out\nbecause we were trying to figure out\nlike there's a basic problem of why\ndon't people learn from their mistakes\nright and and y'all May y'all may have\nseen this but like or you all may have\nexperienced this I know this certainly\nhappened with me we're like I knew I was\nscrewing up\nbut I couldn't do anything about it\nand I was like if this is a mistake but\nit's like something about\nunderstanding that up here would not\ntranslate into my brain and I'd make the\nsame damn mistake again\nthe buzzing is my\nfan\nthat I need to fix and I don't know how\nto fix it because I don't know which\none's making the noise\num yeah so the paper is this is the name\nof the paper\ncognitive flexibility and decision\nmaking predicts\nexpertise in the MOBA esport League of\nLegends\nwith the primary author being Carlos Val\nSerrano\nand is published in\nSage open access\nand is from the Department of psychology\nand Universidad catholica de Murcia\nEspana\ncool huh\num\nyeah so check that out and then we're\ngonna try to figure out uh\nso a couple of things\nso we're going to be streaming probably\non Friday I think we're gonna be\num I don't know so stay tuned to\ndifferent platforms because some days\nwe're streaming on Twitch some days\nwe're streaming on YouTube\num twitch streams may or may not be\nuploaded to YouTube not all of our live\nstreams are uploaded to YouTube so catch\nus live if you can and then we're also\ngoing to be popping up here and there on\nother people's channels so we're doing a\nlot of different podcasts and and stuff\nlike that we're going to American\nPsychiatric association May 20th to 27th\nmaybe not for that whole time but\nsomewhere in that window so we're gonna\nbe out and about\nso we're also going to be focused on\ngiving y'all a lot of really solid uh\nvideos on really common topics that\npeople struggle with for example how do\nyou learn from your mistakes\num and so stay tuned to all that a\ncouple of other things to keep in mind\nuh for those of y'all that have tried to\nsign up for coaching recently we've been\nat between 95 and 99 capacity for like\nuh almost a month and a half now so\nthere are a couple spots here or there\nbut we apologize for that\num but coaching does seem to really help\npeople in our community we see a lot of\ngood outcomes from it we presented last\nyear at APA we're going to be hopefully\ntalking about it some this year and I\nthink it goes back to a lot of the stuff\nthat Destiny was kind of talking about\nabout how\nyou know our system of of Health Care is\nreally focused on sick care you can get\nsomeone to give you a heart transplant\nbut you're not going to get a doctor to\nteach you how to exercise and what is\nthe mental correlation of that that's\nwhy we do coaching and coaching was\nsomething that I sort of discovered or I\ndidn't Discover it the chief of\nPsychiatry at McLean Hospital which is a\nHarvard Medical School teaching\naffiliate and the number one Psychiatric\nHospital in the country or number two is\na psychiatric hospital in the country\ndepending on the year\nwas listening to the work that I do and\nhe's like hey you should really check\nout coaching and what I discovered was\nsomething that I had kind of felt a lot\nwhen I was doing therapy is that okay so\ntherapy is really good at helping people\nwith pathology but it's pretty Hit or\nMiss I'm not saying that there aren't\ngood therapists at this there are a lot\nof really good therapists at this who\nare especially like trained in things\nlike positive psychology and stuff like\nthat who will help people build their\nlives\nand it's kind of the stuff that Destiny\nwas talking about about how do I get up\nand leave the house how do I form\nrelationships how do I\num\nuh you know how do I how do I build life\nand what I really found is that that was\nwhat was missing which is why we started\nthis coaching program and if you all are\ninterested in more deep dives into\nmental health topics so definitely you\ncan check out things like our YouTube\nchannel right so we've got about 400\nvideos on our YouTube channel\num and then we also have Dr K's guide to\nmental health which is sort of my deep\ndive into things like depression anxiety\nmeditation and ADHD\nand the thing about the Dr K's guide is\nit's not just focused on the pathology\nor the diagnosis but for example in the\nADHD guide about 60 of it is how to do\nstuff\nso like where does motivation come from\nhow can you control your environment to\nimprove your productivity so it's all\nthese skills that will oftentimes teach\npeople who have ADHD to bring them back\nto functional\nbut the cool thing is these are the very\nsame skills that if you're already at\nBaseline you can Implement these to\nbecome kind of like optimize your\nproductivity and functionality and even\nin stuff like the depression guide we'll\ntalk about things like you know how I\nthink about bipolar disorder or\ndepression but we'll also talk about\nthings like existential depression or\nidentity and how I form my identity of\nmyself and in the anxiety guide will\nteach you all kinds of different stuff\naround you know regulating your\nphysiology and things like that\nso if y'all are interested in that stuff\ncheck that out and we also try to do you\nknow a lot of stuff for free on YouTube\nand things like that so in that vein\nwe're gonna do a deep dive into trauma\nprobably on Friday where I'm going to\nexplain trauma and I wish that I could\ndo a 20-minute YouTube video on it or I\nwish I could do a meme react to it and\nwe could but if y'all really want to\nunderstand trauma trauma is the one\nthing that we've sort of in a sense\nsteered clear of just because I have not\nfor the last three years I've been\ntrying to figure out how to reduce this\nto like five tips\nthat you can do\nbut I think trauma is really the one\ntopic that you really have to do a deep\ndive so we're going to kind of do that\nmay not be quite as entertaining may not\nbe quite as short form may require a\nlittle bit more of an attention span but\nwe just can't do it justice without\ndoing it in depth\nso feel free to check us out for that\nand for those of y'all that are\nstruggling with that we hope it'll be\nhelpful\num just a reminder that everything that\nwe do is really not a substitute for\nmental health treatment and we're not\nsaying that just for medical legal\nreasons because if you're you know if\nyou're struggling with something like\nsuicidality or having difficulty getting\nout of bed things like that you should\nabsolutely see a therapist or\nprofessional and even a lot of the\npeople in our program so I want to say\nsomewhere between 10 and 30 percent of\npeople in coaching are concurrently in\ntherapy and the two are very\ncomplementary they're not substitutes\nso your coach will help you sort of plan\nyour day figure out what you want to do\nin life help you overcome motivational\nblocks and your therapist will help you\nwith things like you know depression or\nbipolar disorder or stuff like that and\nthere is\num where hopefully where I think we have\na manuscript that's being reviewed for\npublication where we do see good mental\nhealth outcomes in terms of our coaching\nprogram so while we see things like 25\nto 35 reductions in scientifically\nvalidated instruments that measure\nthings like mood and anxiety it's not a\ntreatment for that it just turns out\nthat\nwhen you start building a life that\nyou're excited about and you get up\nevery day and you're like you know you\nended up getting that promotion or you\nended up finding that relationship or\nthings like that when you when you start\nmaking progress in life we sort of see\nthat all boats rise together so we do\nsee positive outcomes in some of those\ndimensions\nso check it out if y'all want and then\num\ngatro is saying the positive impact\nyou've had is worth a million well I\nappreciate the dollar 99 and really\nthat's what we're here for right so we\nrecognize\nthat\nwe all need to learn about mental health\nand we all need to learn how to take\ncare of our Mental Health and we're we\nalso recognize that we have Biola is\npretty cool so we we've reached people\nin 132 countries\num and we recognize that not everyone is\nin a position where they can afford\ntherapy let alone coaching or even\nsomething like Dr K's guide and so we're\ngoing to do our best to try to do\nwhatever we can for y'all and if you\ncan't afford anything that's okay we're\ngoing to do the best that we can if you\nguys can contribute a little bit with a\ndonation here or there we're going to\ntake that money and we're going to turn\nit into stuff hopefully we'll have\nsomething cool that'll be completely\nfree that'll be launching by the end of\nthe month we're in our testing phase\nsometimes things take a little bit\nlonger but any money that you do send\nour way is stuff that we are going to\nuse to try to help you all more so we're\ngrateful for everything that you all\nhave to give\num so we're hopefully going to have a\ncool\nthing for y'all and and by the way our\nDiscord events are also completely free\nso things like Social Sandbox which we\nhave maybe twice a month ask a coach\nwhere if you all have questions that we\ncan't get to on stream or things like\nthat right because we you know we reach\nabout three to eight million people a\nmonth a lot of you all have questions I\ndon't have time for all of them\nI'm sorry that's why we have these\nevents on Discord and stuff like that\nthey're super cool and Discord also has\nall kinds of other features and stuff\nlike how to get healthy and and\num accountability tracking and things\nlike that\nso coach GPT Maybe\nright maybe we'll see maybe we'll have a\nconversation before the end of the month\nor a video about can chat GPT replace\ntherapists we'll see\num yeah so real the real Jacob 98 is\nsaying educational stuff about mental\nhealth if you can't afford mental health\ntreatment absolutely and this is what we\nreally believe is that\nmental health treatment and education\nabout Mental Health\nare two different things\nright so if you think about in class\nwe have PE at least in the United States\nphysical education we literally have a\nclass in physical education\nwhere we teach people how to run\nand play basketball in sports we\nactually intentionally teach people how\nto use their body\nand\nwhat we tend to find is that we don't\nhave that for mental health education so\nthat's really what we try to do here at\nnhg we're not trying to be a substitute\nfor mental health treatment what we're\nacknowledging is that everyone should\nunderstand their mind because you're\ngoing through your life\nusing this thing\nbut we don't understand how it works\nright like literally there's studies\nthat show that neurogenesis in the\nhippocampus\nwhich is where we learn\nis stimulated by caloric restriction\nand that's really interesting\nright and so there's all kinds of stuff\nabout how my mind works how do I process\nemotions\nhow do I do different stuff how do I how\ndo I optimize this thing we know how to\nuse this thing we have buttons that we\ncan program\nbut we don't know how to use this and\nthat's what we try to teach you\nthe positive impact is worth 20 US\nDollars thanks for the chat today thanks\nfor the the tip or the donation we\nreally appreciate it we will use that\nmoney to try to help more people more\nincluding you\num and someone's asking is 40 too old to\nsign up I don't know what you're\nreferring to but it ain't too old to\nsign up for anything Imo it's not too\nold to show up in Discord it's not too\nold to watch Dr K's guide it's not too\nold to do coaching\nnot at all\nnot enough Nails spam what does that\nmean Andrew you've given me nail spam\nthanks for the 50 pound\ndonation appreciate it\nI don't know what nails we're talking\nabout I don't know if I got debated I\njust get debated\nwill coaching help you build study\nhabits\nokay here's how coaching if you're a\nstudent\nI think what coaching so coach will not\nexplicitly tell you this is how you\nshould study we have YouTube videos for\nthat\nwhat a coach will help you do\nis clarify why you want to study in the\nfirst place here's why building study\nhabits is hard you all want to\nunderstand this in a nutshell someone's\nasking\nhow do I build study habits you know\nwhat to do the reason is you're not\nmotivated enough to actually do it\nbecause building study habits is an\nenergy investment\nand you're not willing to pay the price\nwhy\nbecause why do you want to study\nbecause I'm supposed to\nbecause I'm supposed to\nis not a good enough reason\nto beat this\nso how does coaching help coaching helps\nbecause it helps you figure out a reason\nthat is more important than this\nthat's what they're experts in\n58 Improvement in purpose or motivation\npurpose life purpose\nit's somewhere between 12 and 16 weeks\nyou all get that\nso a lot of people will come and be like\nare you going to teach me how to do this\nno we're not going to teach you coaching\nisn't about teaching it's about helping\nyou uncover things so that you can\nImplement what you need to learn the\nproblem in today's world is not that you\nneed to be taught\nthere is an abundance of information\nright\nyou can Google how do I study how do I\nbuild study habits\ngo to the library at the same time every\nday\nput your phone on silent mode\nuninstall all of your video games\neveryone has the information\nthe problem isn't the information\nand this is why it doesn't work because\nyou can look at that crap over and over\nand over again\nwe know what we need to do we just can't\nbring ourselves to do it\nthat's what we specialize in\nso understand what drives you it's not a\nlack of information problem maybe 500\nyears ago is a lack of information\nproblem\nnow it's a driver problem\nright so when I'm when like working as\nan addiction psychiatrist\nhow do I quit alcohol\nhow do I stop smoking pot\nhow do I get rid of my marijuana\naddiction\nyou have to have a good reason that's\nthe first place I start with why\nbecause my wife or my husband is making\nme not gonna work you can get three\nmonths of sobriety that way you can get\nmaybe even six not gonna work\nso like unlocking that motivation is\nreally the most important part\nthat's what we specialize in\num so are there plans to work directly\nwith teachers or working with schools or\nis this happening already\nwe would love to so we've done stuff\nwith schools in the past\nbut I think that what teachers schools\nneed mental health education curriculums\ncurricula\nbut teachers also need help\nso teachers are in an unprecedented rate\nof burnout and they need support too\nif y'all know anything about this let us\nknow like Post in our subreddit or\nsomething like that and we'd love like\nif you all know how to do that please\nlet us know\nbecause we'd love to support teachers at\nschools\num\nokay\nuh why don't y'all it seems like we have\nto\nwhere do attendees play into this\ndo you have anything on self-harm\nscattered in various places but we may\ncover it in our trauma Deep dive\non Friday\nyeah so we're so this is why like\neveryone's asking about did and\nself-harm and stuff like that we're\ngonna dig into all of it I don't know\nthat we're going to do

YouTube and in Dr K's guide Dr K's\nguide has like something like 30 to 40\nmeditation videos\num\nhow can I support you if I can't donate\nmoney directly the most important thing\nthat you can do for us is\nto take whatever help we're offering and\ndo something with it in your own life\nthat's the most important thing that's\nwhy we're here\nwe're here for you not for us\nbeyond that if you want to do something\nfor us share our stuff with your friends\nif you think something is useful to them\nright so that too should be the value\nshould be for the people that you give\nit to\ndon't share it I mean don't share it\njust because it would help us that does\nhelp\nright but like liking subscribing\nsharing our videos things like that like\nyou know if there's something that we do\nthat you think could be helpful to\nsomeone else let someone else know\nthat's helpful to us\nwe'll earn like\n0.02 cents\nfrom YouTube for every view that we get\nor whatever nominal amount and that\nhelps\nright\num\ndo you have do you all have anything\nabout overcoming racialized trauma not\nreally\nthat's why we're starting with this deep\ndive we're going to explain the basics\nof
