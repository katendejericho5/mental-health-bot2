    "transcript": "so the basic mistake that we make is\nthat we look at pros and cons and we\nmake a decision and we assume that our\ndecision is like beneficial right Pros\nover here we have cons over here and\nthen we're going to decide something\nbased on a net positive and we think\nwe're going to move in that direction\nbut the whole problem is that the\nequation changes as we implement it and\nsince the disadvantages become bigger\nand the advantages seem further away\nthen we move in the opposite direction\nwe need to break up this is crazy this\nis terrible I miss you right because\nonce you break up with someone then the\npain of them being absent is so much\nmore acute you begin to realize all the\nthings that you took for granted in the\nrelationship and then when you get back\ntogether with you're like oh my God I\nmissed this person so then you get back\ntogether and all the toxic behaviors are\nin your face again they're nagging you\nall the time putting you down in front\nof your friends they're cheap and all\nthis other crap so whichever direction\nwe go starts to feel more painful"
