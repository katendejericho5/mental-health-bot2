    "transcript": "I want to talk to you all today about\none of the biggest problems I see in the\nworld loneliness this is a problem that\nI think is getting worse and worse and\nwe're starting to see almost a silent\nepidemic of it the real challenge with\nloneliness is that a lot of people who\nare lonely will try really hard to no\nlonger be lonely they'll do everything\nfrom watching like YouTube videos and\nstuff like that right to stuff like\ntaking courses and they'll even try to\ndo things like just go out there and\nmeet people and the real troubling thing\nis that the more people that we work\nwith the more that we're actually\nlearning that people are putting in a\nton of effort but it doesn't seem to be\nyielding anything there are a lot of\npeople out there who will give advice to\nlonely people like just go out there and\nmeet people or why don't you do this or\nyou would be less lonely if you did this\nand so we sort of put the burden of\nfixing loneliness on the person\nthemselves because that's generally how\nwe approach problems right because like\nif something's broken with you let's say\nyou're out of shape or you need to be\nhealthier this is a problem that\nfundamentally like you need to fix the\nchallenge is that when it comes to loan\nloneliness it's not a problem that you\ncan fix on your own it requires another\nhuman being's effort and that's where we\nsort of see the Crux of the problem so\nlet's start by understanding what are\nsome of the macro level changes we're\nseeing in the world today the first\nthing is that we're a society that is\nincreasingly becoming dependent on\nIndependence and we see especially in\nthings like the anti-work movement that\npeople can't rely on other groups of\npeople anymore and that's the direction\nthat our society is moving in and so if\nwe really think about it what Society is\nsort of teaching us is to be independent\nand they're making it so easy to be\nindependent that we've stopped learning\nhow to function with other human beings\nand now it actually becomes difficult to\nbe connected to another human being\n[Music]\nthe next thing that I want to talk a\nlittle bit about is that the world is\nfundamentally becoming a more stressful\nplace and this is something that I don't\nhear acknowledged a whole lot now I'm\nnot saying that the world is getting\nworse after all we can get groceries\ndelivered to our house right but I think\nwhat people don't really acknowledge is\nthat the world is objectively becoming\nmore stressful so 30 years ago\ncardiovascular disease in cancer were\nthe two biggest sources of suffering and\nmortality amongst the human race mental\nhealth is now number one so the world is\nobjectively becoming a more stressful\nplace and we're sort of seeing why this\nis happening because as we can do more\nstuff at home people are demanding more\nstuff of us at home and so what is the\nnatural response how are human beings\nadapting to the stress we tend to\nretreat to Safe spaces so we see that\nalso that the internet is kind of\nencouraging toxicity what the internet\nrelies on is emotional engagement a lot\nof the content that you click on on the\ninternet makes you feel worse and so as\nthese these platforms are emotionally\nengaging us and stressing us out we have\nto retreat to Safe spaces and by the way\nsince now we can talk to everyone from\nthe internet I can find a thousand\npeople who agree with me a hundred\npercent and I can talk to a new person\nevery day for three years and I will\nonly hear stuff that I already believe\nthese are Echo Chambers\nand so what are we seeing as a\nconsequence of the formation of these\nEcho Chambers and safe spaces on the\ninternet which by the way I don't think\nare bad I'm just saying if we want to we\nneed to understand as a society like\nwhat impacts these are having what these\nessentially breed is intolerance right\nbecause that's the point of a safe space\nis that hey we're going to tolerate\nparticular Behavior but we're not going\nto tolerate this other stuff that we\ndisagree with and so this is a Croc the\nCrux of the problem with loneliness is\nthere a lot of people out there and we\nas a human society have started to say\nhey we acknowledge that you have\nproblems but it's not my responsibility\nto fix them it's someone else's\nresponsibility to fix them I'm not\nresponsible for this other human being\nwhich is completely correct and this is\nthe core problem is that loneliness is\nthe only problem that an individual\ncannot fix but the responsibility is\nfalling on everyone else when we have a\nproblem in society we put the\nresponsibility on the individual and we\nas individuals don't take responsibility\nfor anyone else us and that works for a\nlot of problems and it has a ton of\nadvantages because we have people who\nare learning how to change tires and\nlearning how to eat healthy and learning\nhow to do intermittent fasting and\nlearning how to bake bread and that's\nreally cool but there's one problem that\nyou can't solve by yourself on the\ninternet and that is loneliness and this\nis why if we continue moving in this\ndirection this is not going to get\nbetter because the fundamental issue\nhere the fundamental thing that has\nchanged is that human beings are no\nlonger responsible for each other and\nhow is someone who is lonely supposed to\nfix that it requires another human being\n[Music]\nso what do we do about this this is\nwhere we really need to decide as a\nsociety like whether we're okay with the\ndirection that things are going and I\nthink that there are a couple of things\nwe can absolutely do but they're things\nthat we don't want to do and they're\nthings that we're not going to like\ndoing the first is we need to be more\ntolerant\nso the internet once again is breeding\nintolerance there's this principle\ncalled online drift which sort of\nclearly demonstrates that if you say\nsomething contrarian you are likely to\nget banned from all the spaces except\nthe ones that agree with you and that's\nwhy we see a polarization across\nHumanity so just because someone\ndisagrees with you doesn't mean that you\nneed to ostracize them try to like\nlisten to other people the second thing\nthat we need to do is recognize that\nanother human being cannot fix\nloneliness\nlike they can't do it on their own and\nas long as our problem solving strategy\nis completely independent loneliness\nwill never get better and so what does\nthat mean for you that means that you\nmay have to think about other people you\nmay have to invite other people who you\nmay not think about inviting or may not\neven want to invite you are entitled to\ninvite whoever you want I'm not saying\nthat you're you should be forced to but\nwhat I'm saying is understand the\nimplication of going by what you're\nentitled to instead of what is like\nacting from compassion because the other\nthing is when we take what is rightfully\nours it's usually from a selfish\nperspective and why have we become\nincreasingly selfish is because we're\ngoing increasingly independent because\nwe can't rely on anyone else to take\ncare of us so we have to take care of\nourselves but practically this is a this\nis a recipe for disaster especially when\nit comes to loneliness so the second\nthing that you really have to think a\nlittle bit about is that you may not be\nable to fix your own loneliness but you\ncan absolutely help someone else's and\nloneliness is the one problem you cannot\nexpect someone to fix on their own and\nthe third thing\nis that even if you are lonely\nthere's one major thing that you can try\nto do differently\nwhich is reach out to someone else for\ntheir sake instead of your own so if we\nlook at the psychology of loneliness\nthere's a huge problem where usually\nthese people have some kind of internal\nWar I'm alone I don't want to be alone\ntherefore I'm going to reach out to\nsomeone else and when I reach out to\nsomeone else I'm also met with all kinds\nof emotional resistance sometimes we'll\neven like over analyze what people do or\nthink or say which is part of the reason\nwe're lonely in the first place but even\nwhen we're lonely we try to reach out to\nother people for our benefit and so in a\nweird way you're making the same mistake\nthat the people who aren't lonely are\nmaking which is that you're thinking\nabout yourself\nand when you're thinking about your own\nbest interest\nthat's when the anxiety becomes a real\nproblem because if we're thinking about\nyour best interest sure you're lonely\nbut if you go reach out to someone like\nthey're gonna dislike you or you'll be\nanxious so if you're protecting yourself\nwhat are you gonna do it's easier to\navoid the anxiety and Be Lonely by\nmyself and this is the tug of war that\npeople who are lonely fall into\nright one day I'm lonely once that\nloneliness Rises to a level that becomes\nintolerant I'm going to overcome my\nsocial anxiety and reach out to another\nhuman being but the second that that\nsocial anxiety Rises beyond my\nloneliness I will slip back and I will\nbe by myself and so if the goal\nis to make yourself feel better when you\nreach out to another human being you are\nultimately not going to be in control as\nthe loneliness starts to decrease\nbecause you're spending time with people\nthe anxiety starts to increase the we've\ntipped Beyond and now we switch right\nand then when I'm alone my anxiety is\nzero my loneliness starts to climb oh\nI'm going to reach out to people as I\nreach out to people now I'm sitting with\npeople at a restaurant this starts to\nhappen and the second I get here where\nmy anxiety is now higher than my\nloneliness I Retreat yeah I'm out guys\nI'll see y'all later and then you never\nrespond to any texts again so as long as\nyou are\ntrying to solve loneliness for your own\nsake you will always be the victim of\nyour own internal anxieties or\nintolerant emotional state so how do you\nget over this this is where when you\nreach out to someone else even if you\nyourself are lonely think about the\nother person\nthink about trying to alleviate their\nloneliness think about enriching their\nlife think about other human beings and\nthe beautiful thing is that if you take\npeople who have a lot of internal\nnegative emotion\ndoing something in service to others\nactually helps you conquer that emotion\nthis is something you learn a lot if you\npractice Psychiatry or you've worked\nwith a psychiatrist you're going to know\nthat you can experience all kinds of\nnegative emotions but you've got to have\na good enough reason to tolerate those\nnegative emotions and if the good enough\nreason is I want to make my life better\nand you're engaging in a situation that\nmakes you feel worse what are you gonna\ndo you're going to retreat from the\nsituation\nso if you want to solve your own\nloneliness I know it sounds bizarre but\nstop thinking about yourself which is so\ndamn hard because all of society is\ntelling us only think about yourself\nwe've become so hell-bent on\nIndependence and we become so\nresponsible for our own problems and\nmore importantly we've absolved\nourselves of responsibility for other\npeople's problems obviously right you're\ncorrect I'm not saying you're wrong but\nthen whose problem is it who's actually\ngoing to fix it well it's their problem\nwell fair enough except there's one\nproblem that they can't fix on their own\nwhich is loneliness\nand so as a whole\nwe need to start being more tolerant of\neach other try to be tolerant of other\npeople's views try to think about\nsomeone else try to really consider that\nhey loneliness is the one problem this\nperson cannot fix and if you yourself\nstruggle with loneliness chances are the\nreason you're lonely is because you ping\npong between negative emotions and one\nnegative emotion is controlling you at\nany given time because you are out there\ntrying to fix your own problems because\nthat's what everyone does and this is\nthe one situation where fixing your own\nproblems doesn't work and so even if you\nare struggling with this reach out to\nthree people\nirrespective of whether you're lonely or\nnot reach out to three people\nand engage them in conversation invite\nthem to something and this is where your\nmind may say a host of all other things\nlike your mind may say but like what if\nthey don't like me that's okay we're not\nsaying you have to pick the worst people\non the list right so pick like people in\nThe Gray Zone and say hey like hey how\nare you doing nowadays like you want to\nhang out sometime and this is where your\nmind may say all kinds of things to stop\nyou but just notice those for a second\ndon't give in to them right away I'm not\nsaying open the door to unending\ntoxicity seriously I'm not but there's a\ndecent chance that you know your mind\nwill say all kinds of things like oh\nlike but I haven't talked to this person\nin a long time\nthat's okay if you're lonely how does it\nfeel if someone you haven't heard from\nin a year reaches out to you says hey\nwhat's up you want to hang out sometime\nfeels amazing right so our watch out for\nthe things that your mind tells you to\ndo but seriously just reach out to three\npeople because this is the one problem\nthat like I hate to break it to y'all I\ncan't fix this\nI can do a lot of things healthy gamer\nHG we can do a lot of things and we do\nhelp a lot of people with a lot of\nthings but I can't be everyone's friend\nright and I'm gonna need y'all's help\nthis is why we started this because like\nwe can't do it on our own that's the\nwhole idea behind HG and we've come an\nincredibly long way\nwe have over a hundred people who've\ndecided hey you know what I want to help\nother people they're dedicated\nindividuals and they've helped now 12\n000 people in 119 countries and there's\na lot that we can do but there are some\nproblems that I hate to break it to you\nall the only person who can tackle it is\nyou\nand loneliness is the top of that list\nso reach out to someone else and try to\nmake someone else's life better"
