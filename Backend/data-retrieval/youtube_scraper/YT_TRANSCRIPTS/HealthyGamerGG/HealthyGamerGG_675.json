    "transcript": "perfectionism and procrastination are\nruining my life I'm at my wit's end with\nmy perfectionism it's taken over my life\nand is causing me to procrastinate on\nevery creative project I've ever wanted\nto pursue the Arts music animation\nwriting Video Games Etc I have so many\nideas and passions but I can never seem\nto follow through with them because I'm\ntoo afraid of not being able to execute\nthem perfectly I also have a hard time\nlearning new things quickly and\neffectively I put so much pressure on\nmyself to understand everything\nimmediately this has made it difficult\nfor me to progress in my personal and\nprofessional life I constantly feel like\nI'm not good enough it's not just\naffecting my hobbies it's affecting my\nwork and personal relationships too I'm\nconstantly self-guessing myself and\nfeeling like a failure because I'm not\nmeeting my own and possibly high\nstandards I'm struggling to find joy in\nanything anymore and it's all because of\nmy crippling perfectionism every task\nfeels like a defeat and if anything\nisn't perfect it's like I'm failing at\neverything I put every task on the back\nburner procrastinating on everything I\nneed to do because I'm too afraid of not\nbeing able to execute it perfectly I\nfeel like I'm stuck in a cycle of\nperfectionism and procrastination I\ndon't know how to break free I don't\nknow where to begin and what's worse I\ndon't know what to do if it doesn't work\nout have any of you experienced this\nlevel of perfectionism before how did\nyou overcome it are there any strategies\nor techniques that have worked for you\nI'm willing to try anything at this\npoint the first thing that I'm going to\nsay is someone says I'm willing to try\nanything and this is why I'm going to\nstart by pushing back a little bit are\nyou willing to try anything or are you\nonly willing to try things that work so\nif we look at this what's the first\nthing to understand the first thing to\nunderstand is that when someone says I'm\nwilling to try anything we're not\nactually willing to try anything that's\ncrazy I only want to try things that\nwork but let's understand perfectionism\nand procrastination okay so this person\nis brilliant insightful articulate love\nit so let's understand a couple things\nthe first is that the procrastination is\na symptom of the root of perfectionism\nright so why is it hard for them to get\nstarted they even laid this out so if I\nwant to be perfect I can't get started\nuntil I know it'll be perfect and so we\ncan't get started because we're setting\nan impossible standard for us all\nbecause we need to be perfect I need a\nplan that will achieve Perfection and\nI'm going to figure out the perfect Plan\nbefore I get started because what's the\npoint in starting without a perfect plan\nbecause then I'll do all this work and\nit won't be perfect and that won't be\ngood enough so why even bother getting\nstarted in the first place so the\nprocrastination comes out of the desire\nfor Perfection so if you want to disable\nthe procrastination you need to do one\none of two things either let go of the\nperfectionism entirely and be okay\nstarting without being perfect which\nthere's a path to we've done a video\nabout you know we've done multiple\nvideos about how to overcome\nprocrastination there's something in the\nADHD guide and guide doing stuff by the\nway but let's understand that\nprocrastination if your goal is\nperfection you can't get started until\nyou have a plan that is perfect so since\nthere's no such thing as a perfect plan\nbecause as a human being you can't\npredict the future it's impossible to\nget started so why do we say that this\nprocrastinates does this person never do\nanything no they do stuff but it's\nreally hard for them to get started and\nthat's because something else has to\novercome their need for procrastination\ndesperation last minute Panic it's due\ntomorrow someone else is mad at me and\nso experiencing life is this person is\nawful it's like European ping pong ball\nand you're getting swatted back and\nforth between perfectionism and what\nother negative emotion is required to\novercome the procrastination related to\nthe perfectionism so you have no control\nover your life you're being like swatted\naround by negative emotions and when\nyou're getting swatted around by\nnegative emotions and you have no\ncontrol your performance suffers you\ncertainly ain't behaving perfect let\nalone good so how do we tackle this so\nlet's understand the desire for\nperfectionism so we want to be perfect\nfor a couple of reasons the first is\nsometimes our performance\ncorrelates with our value as a human\nbeing so if you look at like a lot of\npeople grow up in situations where\nthey're taught you're not a good child\nyou're not a bad child oddly enough\npeople who are taught that they're good\nchildren or bad children this doesn't\napply to them there are some of us who\nare taught that whether we are good\nchildren or bad children depends so in a\nvery traumatic situation abusive\nsituation these people are not\nperfectionists they don't struggle with\nperfectionism because they're like I\nsuck to begin with I'm gonna suck no\nmatter what their problem is different\nand then there are people who are sort\nof brought up in a secure environment\nwhere like you know you're a good kid\nand it's okay to fail and like you you\nknow that's not us then there are those\nof us who are perfectionistic and what\nhappens with the perfectionistic people\nwhether I'm a good or a bad person\ndepends on my performance it depends and\nonce we fall into that then we're in big\ntrouble because our value as a human\nbeing and we want to make people happy\nwe're going to make people happy we want\nto be a good person these are important\nideals these are good things to want\nit's important to make other people\nhappy it's important to feel good about\nourselves like self-esteem is important\nthe problem is that depending on your\nwiring you started equating performance\nwith value as a human being and so what\ndo we want to do I want High self-esteem\nI want to be a great human being of\ncourse who doesn't want to be a great\nhuman being how do I become a great\nhuman being great human being equals\nperfect performance when do you see this\nyou see this in people whose value was\ndependent on their accomplishments\nthat's one reason or people are\nperfectionistic second reason why people\nare perfectionistic is they cannot\ntolerate the consequences of a\nnon-perfect solution so if I'm not\nperfect that means that stuff can happen\nokay and that stuff when that stuff\nhappens that is not perfect there is a\nresponse within me that is too painful\nto deal with so I'll give you all an\nexample I like someone I want to ask\nthem out on a date them saying no hurts\nso much I'm rejected I don't want to be\nrejected I don't want to be a POS I want\nto be a Chad and that rejection I've\nlearned to hurt to fear that rejection\nbecause I've been rejected or whatever\nin the past and so now what I'm going to\ndo is I'm going to come up with a\nperfect strategy because if I can come\nup with a perfect strategy I can control\nthe result and if I can control the\nresult then I don't need to suffer so\nthe desire for Perfection is a\nprotection against the consequences of a\nsub-optimal result if I get a b and\nsomeone else else gets an a they're\ngoing to get an award everyone's gonna\ncheer and clap and I'm gonna feel\njealous I hate feeling jealous I hate\nfeeling second best I don't want to feel\nsecond best so instead what I'm going to\ndo is I'm going to be perfect and then\nI'm going to be number one and then I'm\ngoing to clap for me and I'm gonna feel\nso good I hate that feeling of Envy I\nhate that feeling of jealousy especially\nbecause I know that person deserved it\nand I don't deserve it which makes it\nhurt even worse so we desire Perfection\nto protect ourselves from the\nconsequences of a lack of perfection so\nit usually has to do with intolerance of\nnegative emotion it has to do with our\nsense of ego or value so then how do we\ntackle these two things so let's start\nwith the second one so if we think about\nprocrastination oh I can't get started\nuntil I know I'm going to be perfect and\nif I'm perfect then everyone's going to\ncheer for me everyone's gonna clap for\nme I'm gonna feel good and I don't want\nto feel bad and so if we think about\nliterally what this will feel like for\nyou is when you think about getting\nstarted there will be an anticipation of\na particular feeling so what the\nprocrastination will look like is if I\nget started now and you can pay\nattention to yourself okay what this\nlooks like is if I get started now your\nmind will warn you of a particular a\nconsequence you'll start to feel fear or\njealousy or inferiority or something\nlike that and that's how you know that\nthat's what's going on even the thought\nof getting started is evokes that\nemotion and then that emotion is\nsomething you're so terrified from you\nrun away from it so you don't get\nstarted you procrastinate the other\nthing is that if you're trying to get\nstarted and you think about other people\nand this can be tricky because this can\nevoke an emotion as well but this person\nwill think this about me and this person\nwill think this about me and if I do it\nthis way they will think this about me\nif I do this they will love me and if\nwhat you're chasing is something from\nsomeone else that's that other kind of\nperfectionism because it's about ego\nit's about wanting to be seen a\nparticular way now the question becomes\nokay so like what do we do about it and\nthat's where each of these things is\nlike Monumental tasks on its own so now\nI'm left with the task of trying to\nfigure out how to help you out with it\nso let's start with the emotions so the\nfirst thing is when you try to when you\nfeel that procrastination coming on you\nwill respond to it you'll either quit\nthe task and beat yourself up or you'll\ncomplete the task and like kind of beat\nyourself up and push through it does\nthat kind of make sense like even if so\nI I think about okay I need to start\nstudying today and then I step away and\nthen I start thinking about I didn't\nstudy today I need to study blah blah\nblah blah blah blah and I'm going to\nbeat myself up but the interesting thing\nis once you start that cycle you're no\nlonger thinking about studying you're\nbeating yourself up for not studying so\nyou've actually stepped away from the\ntask or when that beating yourself up is\nstrong enough you push yourself through\nand you start engaging in the task but\nyou're not sitting in that middle Zone\nif that makes sense you've pushed\nthrough the procrastination or you've\nrun away from the procrastination and\nnow the problem has become you've never\nyou haven't really conquered the\nprocrastination you've let your guilt\ndespair or frustration or overcome it\nwhich means now you are becoming\ndependent on the frustration fear or\nguilt to overcome the procrastination\nthen you're screwed because you're\ndamned if you do damned if you don't so\nwhat we need to do is just sit with\nprocrastination just sit there in that\nmoment it's not about beating yourself\nup today I need to do some studying I'm\ngoing to try to study right now don't\nforce yourself into it notice the\nfrustration just sit there and don't do\nyour work sit with the procrastination\ndon't start it don't don't run away from\nit don't beat yourself up you'll notice\nthose things and move away from when you\nstart beating yourself up now I should\njust start it no no no we're just gonna\nsit there set a timer for five minutes\nwe are not going to start studying for\nfive minutes just gonna sit and do\nnothing so how do we stop playing ping\npong stop hitting the ball you're trying\nto get it knocked around just sit and\nthis is where your mind will start to\nRebel it'll say but if I just sit I'll\nnever get anything done and all those\nkinds of things and there there it is\nagain with the stick what is the ping\npong paddle pop nope she says five\nminutes we're gonna do gonna do anything\nno no you need to do stuff you need\nwe're just gonna chill five minutes\nbreathe you can do meditation if you\nwant to you got to be careful because if\nyou start meditating to start working\nthat's another ping pong paddle you need\nto meditate more if you meditated better\nyou'd be able to work nope we're just\ngonna set five minutes set a timer just\nfeel the tolerance and this is where you\nsay but it's not working I'm not being\nproductive yes you are what you are\ndoing for those five minutes is\ntolerating the emotion and not letting\nit control you you are literally\ntraining yourself to be resistant to the\nSWOT of the ping pong paddle your ball\nis becoming heavier it's no longer a\nping pong ball it's becoming Stone lead\nsome kind of super dense alloy and if\nyou become if you rise to the level of\nBuddha you're going to be like a\nsupernova or a black hole infinite\ndensity and nothing will be able to\ntouch you just tolerate don't do a damn\nthing and don't react to any of your\nemotions either way do you all get that\nnow what if you have the other one what\ndo people think this and think that\nabout you this is where it's kind of\ntricky but what you've got to do is\nrecognize there's two different things\nhere one is the task that you need to do\nand one is how people will respond to\nthe task which one do you really want\nbecause as long as the two are Tangled\ntogether your Sol you'll get that like\nyou're like trying to fight a war on two\nfronts you can't make people happy and\ndo work you can either do work you can't\neven really ever make people happy all\nyou can do is do the work so acknowledge\nthat in this work you are adding another\nVictory Condition it's like we're\nplaying this game and now there's the\nsecond Victory Condition it's like holy\ncrap that makes winning the game way\nharder and what are we actually trying\nto do we're trying to stop\nprocrastinating so we're trying to do is\nget started but when we layer in that\nsecond Victory condition if this needs\nto be perfect so that people will love\nme like that's really hard because you\ncan't get people to love you and now\nit's like I'm playing an RTS game or\nlet's say I'm playing an FPS game and\nthe Victory condition is like something\nthat doesn't exist in the game it's like\nthere's one Victory condition which is\nscore like 15 points by hitting 15\nbullseyes and the second Victory\ncondition is become president of the get\nelected president to the United States\nlike that's not even in the game that's\nwhat we're doing like if you're trying\nto like study and your mind is adding\nthis thing of if you don't get an A your\nparents won't love you like how are you\neven supposed to say like there's\nnothing in the textbook about making\nyour parents love you that's something\nyou're layering on top so separate those\ntwo things it's the only shot you've got\nto separate those two things and even\nthat it'll be a challenge it's not easy\nto separate them but then sort of ask\nyourself in that moment can I at least\nget started on the work and I'll worry\nabout making other people I know I want\nto make them happy I can worry about\nthat later so as best as you can\nprocrastinate on making other people\nhappy and just get started with the word\ncan I just do this for like 15 minutes\n20 minutes 30 minutes and if it's not\ngood I'll solve that problem talk to the\npart of your mind it's like oh it's not\ngoing to be enough and it's like okay\nfine but it'll be a start we always quit\nlater but let's get started in this kind\nof cognitive reframe this cognitive\nflexibility can be really hard to do and\nit's not going to work the first time\nyou do it but if you keep trying you'll\nstart to get some traction right it's\nkind of like learning how to do a\npush-up if you've never done a push-up\nbefore you can't even do a single\npush-up so even if you're like thinking\nabout pull-ups like if you can't do a\nsingle pull-up and failure is inevitable\nhow do you learn how to do one pull-up\nyou jump up you grab the bar and then\nyou train yourself on The Descent right\nyou let yourself you let the rate of\ndropping slow down and that'll\nstrengthen the muscles and then\neventually you'll be able to do one\npull-up so oddly enough trying to\nseparate it even if it doesn't work is\nstill strengthening those muscles and\nthe real way to overcome this whether\nyou're becoming you know a ping-pong\nball to a black hole or separating these\nthings out it's a painful process of\nrepeated failures and the Beautiful\nThing is once you start engaging with\nthat something will shift in your mind\nit's okay to fail and now the pendulum\nis slowing far far far away from\nperfectionism and then becomes easy\nforeign"
