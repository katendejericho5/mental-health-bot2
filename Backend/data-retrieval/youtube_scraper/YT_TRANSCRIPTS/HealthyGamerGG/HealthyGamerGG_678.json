    "transcript": "surf so urge surfing is a technique that\nwe use in addiction Psychiatry to help\npeople withstand the Cravings two\nsubstances that they're addicted to and\nthe general principle is that if we look\nat the Mind\nurges or Cravings arise but if we're\nable to tolerate that for some amount of\ntime if we're able to surf on top of the\nurge instead of give in to it over time\nthat urge will actually go away so what\nwe want you to do is just surf on top of\nthat urge notice the craving and just\ndon't give in to it right what we're\nasking you to do remember that following\nthrough is about doing something\nconsistently but what y'all may be way\nbetter at is doing nothing right that's\nso much easier to do it's not actually\nbecause resisting a craving is difficult\nbut some of us are pretty good at doing\nnothing we're pretty good at\nprocrastinating and that's what urge\nsurfing really is no Cravings will last\nforever that's a natural tendency of the\nMind"
