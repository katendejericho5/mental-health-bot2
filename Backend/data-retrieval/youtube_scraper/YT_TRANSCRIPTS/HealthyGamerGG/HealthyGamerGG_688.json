    "transcript": "I am really struggling with something I\ndon't want to talk about it but before I\ndo I need people if you are a parent\nwho was like touched out by your\nchildren\nI do not want to see you in the comments\nif you are someone with any kind of\nneurodivergency and it manifests or\nshows up as you not liking touch or\npeople touching you I do not want to see\nyou in the comments but I am I feel like\nI'm dying from like touch starvation\ny'all I don't this isn't I don't I don't\nget hugs\nI don't know I feel like if I were to\nget the kind of hug that I [ __ ]\nreally want I would crumble into pieces\nhow do you deal with that\nI really like need to be like touched\nand I know someone's gonna say like okay\ngo to the salon and get your hair done\nor get a massage or or get your nails\ndone right so someone could hold your\nhand and none of those people love me\nnone of those people none of those\nServices love me\nright but I am really I'm really\nstruggling I'm really struggling with\nlike I don't I don't get hugs that [ __ ]\nis\nit could be like maybe a hello\nyou know whatever maybe\num but it's not enough\nI don't know how\nI don't know how you\nhow am I gonna go\nthe rest of my life\nlike this I really I'm just really\nstruggling\nI'm really struggling\nlike I spent like last night just going\nlike this\nplay 20 minutes\noh yeah I'm just if anyone else is\nstruggling what are you what are you\ndoing okay that is some heavy stuff and\nI hate to say this but I think she is\nspot on\num I think she's really tapped into\nsomething that I think we've sort of\nstruggled with so let's like start by\nunderstanding a couple things the first\nis that this is not a isolated\nexperience I also think something that a\nlot of people don't realize is that this\nis also not like a gendered experience\nthere are other really interesting thing\nis even if you talk about some of the\nstuff around like neurodivergence and\npeople who don't like to be touched I've\nheard a lot of people who are\nneurodivergent and don't like to be\ntouched but are also starved for touch\nthey're still longing for it and they're\nin some ways like in an even trickier\nsituation because their body and we'll\ntalk about this in a second needs\nexactly what everybody else needs but\nthere's somatosensory cortex doesn't\neven allow them to engage in it so like\nwhat's going on here so I think what\nwe're seeing so we've seen that there's\na loneliness epidemic some indicators of\nmental illness are getting way worse\nthan they ever have before the\npercentage of people who have never\nUrban in a romantic relationship is\nrising astronomically the percentage of\npeople who have never had sexual\nrelations is also Rising astronomically\nthe number of people who have never had\na friend or have zero friends is also\nRising so I think this is going to be\nkind of weird like we're going to talk\nabout signs for a second but I think\nthis goes like way further than science\nso the first thing is let's talk about\nthe physiology of like touch starvation\nand there is a ton of physiology to it\nso and it's not just oxytocin so there's\none hormone that's kind of like our\nbonding hormone this is oxytocin so\noxytocin is what's released when we like\ncuddle with other people like when like\nwe look at parent-child bonding and when\nyou like cuddle with something like you\nget a spurt of oxytocin oxytocin does\nthings like calms down your nervous\nsystem reduces your stress hormone\nresponse it's kind of like inversely\nproportional and so like literally a hug\nmakes us feel better it's not just a\nsubjective experience it's a physiologic\nexperience these signals are also what\nallows us to be in love and to feel so\nwhen you cuddle with someone there's\noxytocin and you feel love it creates a\nloving bond between two people but it's\nway more than oxytocin so there are\nstudies on touch deprivation and the\nscary thing is that these studies used\nto be done in orphans we used to have to\ngo to an orphanage to find a group of\npeople who were starved for physical\ntouch and we'd study them these orphans\nin Romania now if we want to do a study\non touch deprivation where do we go the\naverage person we no longer need to go\nto orphanages to find people who are\nstarved for touch it's a society why\nit's become the norm so we see changes\nin cardiovascular outcomes we even see\nchanges in things like hemoglobin A1c so\npeople who are starved for touch their\ndiabetes is worse we see of course\nchanges with things like cortisol mental\nhealth parameters like depression and\nanxiety but when a human being gets\ntouched it does way more than oxytocin\nand this is what's also interesting\nthere was one study that took patience\nand and shocked them with electrical\nshocks we administered electrical shocks\nto patients there were three groups of\npeople one group was by themselves one\ngroup was holding hands with a stranger\nthird group was holding hands with a\nloved one and the perception of pain the\nway that the pain was traveled to the\nbrain the way it was interpreted by the\nbrain the brain's response to getting\nelectrically shocked changes and is\nblunted and attenuated by human contact\nand especially by human contact from a\nloved one it literally makes the\nexperience of Life less painful like\nliterally it's not like some like oh\nlike it like it's easy to be no like\nliterally there's like the the\nperception and response to a simple\nelectrical shock is attenuated by\nholding hands with a loved one and what\nare we seeing we're seeing worsening\nlike diabetes we're seeing worsening\ninflammatory issues everyone's going\ngluten free in keto diet like why what's\nhappening with Society why is everyone\nso prone to inflammation why is everyone\nso damn star for touch there are two\nthings that have happened the first is\nthat our society has become increasingly\nindependent we've decided that\nIndependence is king and the way the\nWhat We should strive for is\nIndependence Financial Independence\nemotional Independence the thought of\nbeing interdependent with someone else\nis something that we call weakness so if\nyou think about a problem in your life\nwhat does everyone tell you to do with\nproblems in your life fix them right you\nshould fix it it's your responsibility\nif you're broke it's your fault on the\nflip side what we'll also do is we'll\nblame society and so we'll say it's\nsociety's fault that you're broke and\nboth both angles are correct but both\nangles are missing something else which\nis that when I hear you complain about\noh you're homeless that's society's\nproblem or it's your problem you know\nwhose problem it isn't it's not mine\nit's not mine so in our strive for\nIndependence each individual in the\nworld has absorbed solved themselves of\nthe responsibility of caring for other\nhuman beings because it's society's\nproblem it's the government's problem or\nit's your problem you need to go to\ntherapy you need to get help you need to\nstart meditating and by the way if you\nneed to meditate guess what there's an\napp for that you can do it all on your\nown how is meditation how did it used to\nbe taught\npeople used to go to ashrams they used\nto sit in a gigantic Hall and meditate\ntogether so we've decided that\nIndependence is King we've decided that\nthe needs of the individual surpassed\nthe needs of the community and we've\noutsourced the needs of the community to\ninstitutions like governments the second\nthing that we've done is technology and\nwe've decided through technology that\nwe're going to meet all of your needs\nwithout needing to interact with another\nhuman being so you want to meet people\nthere's an app for that you can do it on\nyour phone you don't have to leave your\nfour walls you need food there's an app\nfor that you don't have to leave your\nfour walls you have to go talk to\nanother interact with another human\nbeing good God now even if you look at\nride sharing apps they have an option on\nride sharing apps we are so tired of\ninteracting with other human beings we\ncan't take a conversation so now I can\nselect something on my app that says\nDon't Talk To Me heaven forbid you're\ntalking to me is wrong with you you're\ntalking to me I did not invite you to\ntalk to me or interact with me in heaven\nforbid that you touch me in any way when\nI was training to be a psychiatrist we\nhad this whole segment on touching\npatients and it's a good segment right\nyou have to be super careful about when\nyou touch another human being and what\nthat means and one of my supervisors\ntold me never touch a patient it is not\nallowed within the psychoanalytics and\nit's like that was hard for me and I\nlistened to them right because there's\nsomeone who's crying in your office and\nlike what do I want to do I want to give\nhim a hug but we're not allowed to do\nthat right because they like they need\nto like manage those emotions on their\nown have and forbid you hug them and\nthere's good reasons for that okay so\nlike there's it's smart so I talk to\nother people right and I said hey this\nis like hard for me help me understand\nthey said a lot of brilliant things so\nthe first question is if it's hard for\nyou to hug a patient that's about you\nyou should never hug a patient because\nit's hard for you to not hug a patient\nbecause then you're putting yourself\nahead of the patient brilliant I\nshouldn't hug people to make me feel\nbetter and if I feel like an [ __ ] for\nnot hugging someone I should not do\nsomething to a patient that alleviates\nme feeling like an [ __ ] brilliant\nactually so a lot of good stuff in there\nwhen I also talk to people about is it\nokay to hug patients and sometimes I hug\nmy patients but there's a way to do it\nin therapy right you talk to them about\nit you say hey like what does it mean to\nyou what does it mean to me like what\ndoes this mean for us we explore what\nthat means but in the rest of society we\ndon't touch people anymore I'm not\nsaying go out there and touch people but\nlike you can invite someone right you\ncan ask people like hey you need a hug\ntoday like you can do that I think this\nis what's so challenging is then like\nthen we get into a whole other can of\nworms which is like a good can of worms\nlike in in the sense that it's valid\nbecause if you go around you're asking\npeople if they want hugs they're going\nto call you a creep they're gonna call\ncops and so somewhere along the way we\nbecome so independent that touching\nother people makes us uncomfortable like\nwe don't even know how to do that\nanymore and this is what you end up with\na society of people who are disconnected\nBecause by the way if you need friends\nthere's Discord if you want to talk to\nsomeone you can chat right and you know\nwhat I I hear you're feeling down let me\nsend you an emoji of two people hugging\nthat's what we've come to we've stopped\nhugging each other and we've started\nsending emojis of people hugging like\nwhat the [ __ ] we've created substitutes\nfor human needs it's not actually\nfulfilling the need it's a substitute I\nrecently learned that there's a virtual\ngirlfriend app don't have a girlfriend\nhere you go right and now we can get\nhuman-shaped pillows and we can even get\nsexual devices and we can we can\nsubstitute a relationship in so many\ndifferent ways and it's only a matter of\ntime before someone takes chat GPT and\noutsources an API to make a virtual\ngirlfriend who adapts to you and learns\nlike a human intelligence substitute\nsubstitute substitute substitutes and\nwhy because the individual humans today\ndon't want to give people what they need\nit's not Society it's like each and\nevery one of us this is what's happening\nright and there are a lot of people out\nthere who are you know as we're watching\nthis or like somewhat like give that\nlady a hug and that's what I felt too\nbut this is the other problem like it's\ngreat that we had that emotional\nreaction and that she was wrong she\nshared her experience that resonated\nwith a ton of people but just think for\na second that what it takes to get\nsomeone to hug that person she's\nliterally got to put something on Tick\nTock that explodes and that's the\nthreshold for human contact that's\nthat's the hurdle she has to jump to get\na hug we've got to lower the threshold\nto help other human beings and so like\nwhat do we do about this situation right\nI think it's like pretty simple we've\ngot to be careful about using technology\nas a substitute for human needs can\ntechnology be used as a tool to fulfill\nhuman needs absolutely but it's crossing\nthe line into substituting and trying to\nprovide the needs in and of themselves\nsecond thing that we've got to do is\nwe've got to start stop blaming people\nfor their problems and stop blaming\nSociety for their problems we've got to\nstart blaming ourselves for other\npeople's problems which runs completely\nalien right and that's like literally\nwhy I started streaming because I was\nlike you know what I can do more for\npeople it's not about like I got\nfrustrated with like certain\ninstitutions that are related to my\nprofession and I I thought they weren't\ndoing enough and they're like good\nreasons for that right they were like\nbig busy with other things like opioid\nepidemics that were literally killing\npeople and this is these like dormant\nproblems\nor subsurface not dormant and so y'all\ncan the only way this works I can't do\nit by myself\nI can't even do one percent of the work\nthat needs to be done because what\npeople need is hugs like I can't hug\neveryone on the planet I want to there's\na part of me that really wants to I\nthink it'd be cool but like I can't do\nthis on I can stream on Twitch I can\ntalk to y'all but like what how close\ncan you and I really get the only way\nthis works is if we start accepting\nresponsibility like we as individuals\nstart accepting responsibility for the\nneeds of the human beings around us and\nthat's hard because if you start doing\nthat it can be painful for you and so\nthat's just the that's the core of the\nproblem because what's happened in our\nsociety is we've decided we've moved\nfurther and further along the road of if\nit's painful for me and it benefits\nsomeone else I don't have to do it and I\nactually agree with you there you don't\nhave to do it no one else is entitled to\nyour sacrifice but that's the problem\nwith Society is like people are trying\nto there's a group of people that's\ntrying to it that feel entitled to the\nlove of others that's not right and on\nthe flip side if we're not entitled to\nthe love of others can we still give it\ncan we still receive it like that that's\nthe thing is like no one no one is\nforcing you I don't think it's fair to\nforce you but the only way this works is\nif we actually step up as a group of\npeople and we start caring about other\nhuman beings\nforeign"
