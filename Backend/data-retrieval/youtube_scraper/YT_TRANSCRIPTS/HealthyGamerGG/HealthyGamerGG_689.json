    "transcript": "what do video games do they cause us to\ndissociate right that's like that's the\nproblem is they cause us to forget life\nand push away all of our cares and\nworries and problems and as long as I'm\nplaying Dota or League of Legends or\nvalorant or whatever like I'm not\nworrying about any of my stuff so like\nno big deal so this is one of the\nsituations in which video games can\ntruly be therapeutic because they assist\nin the dissociative process and this is\nwhere people ask are video games healthy\nor not healthy no such thing every tool\nhas a place is a hammer a good tool or a\nbad tool it's a hammer if you use it\nimproperly you're gonna break a finger\nbut used in the right way it can be very\nhelpful video games are exactly the same\nso oddly enough I would encourage people\nto like follow you what your mind tells\nyou to do if you want to veg out and\nplay a video game you just want to play\nTerraria for like eight hours after a\ntraumatic event I'd say go for it let\nyour mind do what it needs to it's going\nto be subconsciously processing stuff\nand that's actually okay so what should\nyou do after a traumatic event play a\nvideo game there's actually data to\nsupport that"
