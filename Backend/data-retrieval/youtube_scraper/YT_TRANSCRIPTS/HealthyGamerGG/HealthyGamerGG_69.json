    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nadaptability and how to cultivate\n[Music]\nit so this is incredibly important\nbecause a lot of times we think that our\nsuccess in life is determined by our\ncircumstances if I'm born rich then I\nwill be successful and if I'm Bor born\npoor then I won't be successful but if\nyou look at these two groups of people\nthere are some people who are born rich\nwho end up kind of screwing up in life\nand then there are some people who are\nborn poor who end up being very\nsuccessful so what's the difference it\nturns out that one of the major things\nthat's different between success and\nfailure irrespective of your\ncircumstances is the ability to adapt\nand it turns out that we are getting\nworse at adaptation and many of the\nthings that we're doing which we think\nare moving Us in the right direction are\nactually harming us and at the top of\nthe list is finding the perfect solution\nso nowadays when I work with people\nEveryone is looking for the perfect\nsolution so people are looking for the\nright supplement some magical supplement\nthat will cure their anxiety or even the\nright kind of meditation to cure their\nanxiety they're trying to find the\nperfect partner despite the fact that we\nhave 400 games in our steam Library I'm\nlooking for that one perfect game that\nmakes me want to play and it turns out\nthat the more that we Chase Perfect\nSolutions the less adaptable we become\nhey y'all today we're going to talk\nabout something incredibly important\nyour personal data it turns out that\nthere are corporations called Data\nBrokers that will collect personally\nidentifiable information this is info\nlike your birth date where you were born\nwhere your family members actually live\nand even info like your social security\nnumber they'll package this up and sell\nit to third parties this isn't just\nabout privacy this is about safety and\nthat's where delete me comes in I first\nused delete me about 4 years ago when I\nbecame a content creator to scrub my\ninfo from the internet I submitted my\ninfo for removal and got a report back\nwithin 7 days not only that but Le me\nhas services that keep these companies\nfrom repopulating that record to keep\nyour information off of the internet so\ndefinitely check out delete me if you're\ninterested in protecting your privacy\nand safety get 20% off delete me US\nconsumer plans when you go to join delet\nme.com healthygamer and use the promo\ncode healthygamer at checkout that's\njoin delet me.com healthy gamer code\nhealthy gamer and thanks to delete me\nfor keeping mental health content on the\ninternet free\nso I'll illustrate this with a very\nquick example okay so let's say this is\nyou and this is what what you want to\nachieve and so what we go doing what we\ngo on doing in life is we're looking for\nthe right kind of solution so then we\nturn to places like the internet and\nwe're like okay how do I get from here\nto here and someone says this is the\nsolution that will will help you and\nsomeone else says this is the solution\nthat will help you but if we look at\nthese Solutions they're not perfect to\nus right so we try what this person says\nand we find that it doesn't quite fit so\nwe're like looking at someone else's\nsolution and then we sort of end up\nrealizing like this doesn't work for me\nand so what real adaptation is is the\nopposite of actually looking for the\nperfect solution real adaptation is\nchanging ourselves to fit the\ncircumstances so that things work out\nand if we look at society today what we\ntend to find is that Society is actually\ndiscouraging us from doing this the way\nthat Society exists it's making us less\nadaptable and more lazy so I'll give you\nlike a simple example right so if you\nlook at society today and you're you\nhave a particular goal you don't need to\nchange to accomplish that goal if you\nwant to eat something Society will send\nyou food to your doorstep if you want\ngroceries we'll send you things to your\ndoorstep if you want to play a video\ngame we have so many video games right\nnow that there's at least one video game\nthat will perfectly match your interests\nyou like vampires you like city building\nyou don't like competitive multiplayer\nhey here's a vampire City Builder single\nplayer game on the flip side I like FPS\nbut I don't really care about you know I\nsuck at aiming so I want some kind of\nFPS that gives me autotargeting and it's\nalso single player so let me go ahead\nand play this game the society that we\nexist in today is tailoring itself to us\nso much that we no longer need to adapt\nbut this creates a huge problem because\nif you look at life in general\nadaptation is what leads to success we\nknow from the theory of evolution and\nnatural selection that there's a lot of\ndifferent species out there and the ones\nthat are able to adapt are the ones that\nsurvive but adaptation doesn't just\nhappen at the species level it also\nhappens at the individual level we have\nthese mechanisms of things like\nneuroplasticity which is our brain's\nability to adapt to a circumstance and\nactually change Us in the moment we also\nhave um you know studies from the field\nof things like epigenetics where our our\nbody will literally change the\nmethylation state of our DNA and\nactivate particular genes or reduce the\nactivity of particular genes so\nadaptation is crucial for success and\nthis is what I see in the people that I\nwork with and I want you all to just\nthink about this for a second okay so\nthere are a lot of people in life who\nface challenges and for some reason we\ngot super caught up in this idea of\nresilience which is like when you face a\nsetback are you resilient but what I've\nreally seen is that people who are\nsuccessful are the ones that are able to\nadapt when they face a particular\nproblem they are able to change to\naddress that problem and what really\nsort of helps people advance in life is\ntheir ability to adapt so on the one\nhand you have people who don't adapt\nright they're the kind of people who\nwhen faced with a challenge I try things\none way and then I try it the same way\nand then the same way and then the same\nway and then the same way and then the\nsame way and then it never ends up\nworking out and then there are other\npeople who realize when they face an\nobstacle\nthey need to change but that's not what\nwe see nowadays right what we see\nnowadays is a society that tells you you\ndon't need to change at all if you're\nlooking to date someone you don't need\nto improve you just keep swiping until\nyou find the perfect person that's\nliterally what's going on right so you\ndon't need to change your preferences\nfor entertainment you don't need to\nlearn how to watch an enjoyable show you\nneed to keep looking through the\nmillions of shows that are available at\nyour disposal until you find the one\nthat's perfect for you think about how\nabsurd it is the concept of changing\nyourself to enjoy watching a piece of\ntelevision or some kind of TV show is so\nforeign except that is exactly what\nliving organisms need to do to be\nsuccessful So today we're going to teach\nyouall how to increase your adaptability\nthe first thing that we're going to do\nis talk about black and white thinking\nso if you look at clinical stuff right\nso you look at people who are depressed\npeople who have PTSD if you look at\nclinical illnesses what we tend to find\nis that the more black and white\nthinking you have the less adaptable you\nare and we know that the clinical\ninterventions that we have things like\ncognitive behavioral therapy or\nmentalization based therapy the goal of\nthese Therapies in some way is to reduce\nblack and white thinking so there's this\ndisease called borderline personality\ndisorder which sort of is very very\nchallenging for a lot of people and we\nknow that one of the features of\nborderline personality disorder is black\nand white thinking and literally in the\nprocess of therapy what we try to do is\nreduce this thinking so I'll give you\nall other examples of black and white\nthinking it's all or none right so all\nmen are bad or all women are bad or I I\nam a loser I will be alone for the rest\nof my life there is zero chance that I\nwill find a relationship I will never be\nsuccessful these are this is all or\nnothing or black and white thinking so\nit's either 100% or zero there's no\nShades of Gray and literally what we\nknow from the process of psychotherapy\nis when we have people who think like\nthis right so let's take the case of\nsomeone who has depression and is\nsuicidal and they walk into my office\nand they say there is no reason for me\nto continue living there is a 0% chance\nthat I will find joy in life this is the\nnature we call this like we call this\nlike illness right we call this mental\nillness when people is are so stuck in\ntheir black and white thinking we\nliterally call it mental illness and the\ngoal of things like Psychotherapy\ninterventions things like cognitive\nbehavioral therapy and mentalization\nbased therapy for BPD and things like\nthat is to actually reduce this kind of\nthinking we want to encourage people to\nsee Shades of Gray right so when I'm\nworking with someone who's depressed\nthey think in that moment that there is\na zero reason to be alive but as I work\nwith them they begin to increase the\nflexibility of their mind they start to\ncognitively adapt a little bit they're\nable to see Shades of Gray okay so even\nthough my life isn't great there are\nsome things that are going for me and I\nwant you to think about which one of\nthese two people do you think is more\nlikely to be successful there is no\nreason for me to live anymore or despite\nthe fact that there are many\ndisadvantages I still have some things\ngoing for me so what we want you to do\nis literally reduce the way that your\nmind works don't think in terms of black\nand white practically the way that that\nworks is that you can't really control\nyour thinking but you can at the\nbeginning notice it so notice anytime\nthat you have a black or white thought\nan All or Nothing thought I'll be alone\nfor the rest of my life I will never be\nsuccessful and your mind May feed you\nall kinds of evidence why this is true\nbut I hate to break it to you'all but no\nhuman being on the planet can predict\nthe future our mind likes to tell us\nthat we can predict the future but I\nhave never seen a human being who can\nactually see into the future so these\nthoughts are objectively wrong if we\nreally look at the world what we know\nfrom tons of scientific research is that\nmost things are something called\nmultifactorial which means that the\nreason that you failed is not because of\none issue it is because of a consequence\nof lots of different things put together\nso what we want you to do is literally\npay attention to all of your All or\nNothing thoughts right and the more that\nyou pay attention to those thoughts then\nwhat we want you to do is try to see the\nother side of it so we want you to take\na step back and notice ah this is Black\nor White thinking how can I add some\ngray to the equation even though I\nfeeling like I will be alone for the\nrest of my life what are some things\nthat may actually make it possible for\nme to be not alone for the rest of my\nlife try to add that shade of gray and\nwhat you'll find is that this is very\ndifficult for your mind to do and that's\nexactly the problem is that as people\nbecome less cognitively flexible they\nget locked into a particular way of of\nviewing the world and then they cannot\nadapt right that thought becomes fixed\nit becomes a reality and then if you\nthink you're going to be alone for the\nrest of your life anytime you go on a\ndate that will influence the enjoyment\nof the date and the enjoyment of the\npartner so it kind of becomes a\nself-fulfilling prophecy and we can fix\nthis by increasing that cognitive\nflexibility the second thing we're going\nto talk about is to not counter what you\nhear even if you disagree with it so you\nall will notice that this is happening\nso commonly on the internet where if\nsomeone shares a view your mind\nautomatically jumps to why that view is\nwrong right so if we look at the\ninternet today what we have is we have\nliberals and conservatives we have DOTA\nplayers and League of Legends players we\nhave you know men versus women we have a\nlot of people who automatically counter\nwhatever other people tell them so if a\nwoman says yeah I'm a woman and it's\nscary for me to I would rather be with a\nbear than with a man on a trail right\nand then automatically what happens is a\nbunch of dudes are like oh my God that's\nso bad that's so bad we don't even stop\nto try to consider someone else's\nperspective and so as we as people will\nsort of give us information we are not\nadaptable right we immediately reject it\nand the more that you immediately reject\nthings in instead of being flexible the\nless adaptable you will become it's kind\nof my way or the highway so we even see\nthis in gaming so this is really\nimportant to understand so some people\nare like hard stuck at bronze they can\nplay a game for 10,000 hours and they\nnever improve and these people will even\ngo on forums and they'll start asking\nfor help they'll say hey this hero is\noverpowered I'm having trouble like\nadvancing like I can't climb ranks you\nknow the matchmaking is rigged against\nme they'll think all these kinds of\nthings and people will counter them\nright I don't know if you guys have ever\nseen this but sometimes people will say\nhey I want help with something and then\nsomeone will offer help and they'll say\nno no no no no that doesn't work right\nthat doesn't work that doesn't work that\ndoesn't work this is cognitive\ninflexibility and it turns out that some\npeople can play 10,000 hours of a video\ngame and they actually get better over\ntime and some people can play 10,000\nhours of a video game and they will\nnever get better and this is true of\nLife some people will be 30 years old\nand will be incredibly successful they\nwill adapt they will change they will\nimprove and some people will be 30 years\nold and they will be behind what is the\nmain reason for this it is a lack of\ncognitive flexibility here is a study\nlooking at rank in League of Legends\ncognitive flexibility in decision-making\npredicts expertise in the MOBA esport\nLeague of Legends results showed that\ncognitive flexibility was positively\ncorrelated with rank percentile at a P\nvalue of\n.001 like this is insane okay I want\nyouall to realize what this study is\nshowing us this study is showing us that\nif you were hard stuck at bronze or in\nlife what this means is that if you\nbecome cognitively flexible then you\nwill actually improve in both of the\nthese Dimensions so we talked a little\nbit about clinical improvements right so\nwe also see that cognitive flexibility\npredicts PTSD symptoms so I'll show yall\nthis sentence right here individuals\nwith better cognitive flexibility at one\nmonth post trauma showed significantly\nless severe PTSD symptoms after 13\nmonths and then here's another study\nthat shows\nthis is looking at psychological\nflexibility as predictors of individual\noutcomes in hospital healthcare workers\nso this is not just in gaming or mental\nillness this is also in like studies of\njust people who are working in hospitals\nand what we find is that employees who\nshow psychological flexibility are more\nlikely to show greater openness to the\nacceptance of setbacks in the working\nenvironment and to carry on their valued\nliving and working path and this seems\nto correlate with individual well-being\nso now we've looked at three studies and\nI want yall to really pay attention to\nthis so like in the case of trauma this\nis something that is a traumatic setback\nso there are two individuals one of whom\nis not cognitively flexible and one of\nwhom is cognitively flexible or\nadaptable they both have bad stuff\nhappen to them because in life we cannot\ncontrol that sometimes bad happens\nbut there is a huge difference in how\nyou respond to that bad event and if we\nlook at healthcare workers we know that\nbad stuff will happen there will 100% be\nsetbacks but there are two types of\npeople for one person a single traumatic\nevent results in something called PTSD\nwhich means one event lingers in their\nbrain and continues to screw up their\nlife in another situation we have\nsomeone who has a setback at work\nthey're able to carry on their valued\nliving and working path right so some\npeople when they face a setback give up\nthey are not perseverant they can't\nadapt to their circumstances this is a\nlack of adaptability and it results in\nyou being hard stuck at bronze it\nresults in more mental illness right\nwhich then screws over your future\nprospects and it even results in things\nlike not following through at work\ngiving up on a career path that you\noriginally engaged in because you loved\nit in some way and on the flip side we\nhave the people who are highly adaptable\nand those people and this is crazy right\nlike you look at some of these people\nand I used to be both of these right\nthere was a version of me that no\n relationships no money failing\nout of college playing a ton of video\ngames and I still sucked at video games\nand today I have a career gratefully\nthat I enjoy a lot it's fun to be able\nto do this I'm arguably in a happily\nmarried relationship and I've got two\nkids I have relationships I'm and I'm\neven climbing rank in Dota right now\nlike my my has gone up like 1,000 points\nand this is not some way to Humble brag\nand say like oh like what I'm saying is\nthat I used to be both of these people\nlike literally like these are both me\nthe big difference is in one scenario I\nwas not adaptable right I kept on trying\nthe same things over and over and over\nagain and once I started adapting to my\ncircumstances my IQ was always the same\nit's not IQ it's about your ability to\nadapt to your circumstances so how can\nwe increase this adaptability it is to\nnot counter what we hear so people will\ntell you hey this kind of thing is true\nand then immediately in your mind you\nreject it immediately in your mind you\nreject it that is not adaptation there's\nno flexibility it is rigidity of the\nmind so when someone tells you something\nthat is contrary to your experience the\nnature of adaptability is to try to\nunderstand it right try to actually\nsteal man their argument instead of\nstraw man their argument recognize that\nin your life this is true for you in\nthis particular state but if you can\nunderstand how they can be right if you\ncan adapt your mind to that you will\nliterally improve the third thing that\nwe're going to talk about is somewhat\nrelated to that and that's the most\ndevastating statement that I hear which\nis that this does not work for me so a\nlot of people out there will offer\nsolutions to your problems and then you\nwill say this doesn't work for me oh\npeople say meditate first thing in the\nmorning but I'm not a morning person\nthat is a rigid statement it is a black\nand white statement Therefore your\nsolution does not work for me then you\nare stuck looking for the perfect\nsolution and this is the problem in life\nis no one out there will make a solution\njust for you right they will make\nGeneral Solutions so anytime you say\nthis thought pops into your mind where\nthis doesn't work for me socialization\ndoesn't work for me dating doesn't work\nfor me the gym doesn't work for me\neating healthy doesn't work for me\nworking first thing when I wake up in\nthe morning doesn't work for me you are\nabandoning all of those Solutions and\nyou are looking for the perfect solution\nand in doing so you are failing to adapt\nso instead what you should do and I've\nliterally seen this in my office so I'll\nhave some people who are highly\nadaptable and very successful and I'll\nsay okay this is the kind of meditation\nthat you should do or this is how you\nshould try to improve your relationship\nand what they do is what doesn't work\nfor them\nbecomes an obstacle to solve instead of\na reason to give up so if I tell them\nmeditate first thing in the morning half\nof the people I work with will say I'm\nnot a morning person so doesn't work for\nme the next person the opposite Camp\nsays okay even though I have trouble\nwaking up in the morning the first thing\nthat I need to do is wake up in the\nmorning so that I can meditate first\nthing in the morning an obstacle doesn't\nbecome a reason to quit it becomes a\nproblem to be solved so anytime in your\nmind you hear this thought oh this\ndoesn't work for me instead ask yourself\nhow can I make this work for me how can\nI adapt so that this solution can\nactually be successful and then suddenly\nthink about what that will do to your\nlife because there are a thousand\ndifferent solutions out there the\nproblem is they don't work for you but\nthe moment that you start adapting all\nof these thousand Solutions don't work\nfor you can suddenly start working for\nyou then you can rely on the wisdom and\nexperience of other people and this is\nliterally what I see in my practice this\nis the change that I made in my own life\nI start to make things work for me this\nis the nature of adaptation now as y'all\nare listening to this I'm going to bet\nyou money I don't know how much money\nthat someone listening to this even\npotentially the majority of y'all will\nsay but Dr K what about this Edge case\nare you saying that I should adapt to my\nabuse of relationship and learn how to\nbe happy even when the circumstances are\nbad but Dr K I have I'm on the autism\nspectrum or I struggle with social\nanxiety and this may not work for me and\nlook at what you are doing here I am\narguably someone who's somewhat\nknowledgeable in helping other human\nbeings attain success I've done\nNeuroscience research I'm a psychiatrist\nI'm a gamer and I've even shared with\ny'all peer reviewed scientific research\nabout how cognitive flexibility improves\nrank in League of Legends and there is\ngoing to be a group of y'all that are\nlistening to this that will reject my\nApproach about adaptability you will\nreject this in your mind and you will\nsay this doesn't work for me for these\nreasons oh you're saying this but that\ndoesn't I've tried it and it didn't work\nI've tried to adapt I've tried to adapt\nI'm not an adaptable person right think\nabout this and notice how reflexive it\nis in your mind the last thing to\nconsider is make it work for you so\nimagine that if you reject what I'm\nsaying fair enough there may be Reasons\nI'm wrong but can you make it work for\nyou because if you can make it work for\nyou if you can become more adaptable\nthen what would your life be like what\nif you could adapt to your circumstances\nand always do well right it's not\nnecessarily always there's black and\nwhite thinking and the last thing that\nlast example I'll give you is is one\nfrom relationships where everyone out\nthere is looking for the perfect partner\nbut I don't know that there is the\nperfect partner dating apps will tell\nyou keep swiping until you find the\nperfect person they're out there but in\nmy overwhelming experience as a\npsychiatrist who's worked with a ton of\npeople going through divorce done a\ntouch of marriage counseling not my\nforte what I found is that the most\nsuccessful way to create a successful\nrelationship is to adapt to the other\nperson don't try to find someone who's a\nperfect fit for you you need to learn\nhow to adapt to them and they need to\nlearn how to adapt to you that's not\nwhat's happening and that's why we have\na loneliness epidemic we have a dating\ncrisis all of these different things so\nlean into your adaptability stop\nthinking in terms of black and white\nreally listen when people say something\nthat you disagree with try your hardest\nto understand them and if someone says\nhey this will work and you say it\ndoesn't work for me you need to change\nB"
