    "transcript": "and how do I know how much power and\ncontrol I actually have over my life so\nthis is really simple to understand it's\nsimple I guess it's hard to understand\nthe power and control that you have is\nfundamentally only over one thing which\nis your actions you can't control what\nhappens you just control what you do so\nin the case of this depression it's very\nsimple what I control is whether I go to\ntherapy or not I don't control whether\ntherapy prevents me from becoming\ndepressed again I don't control whether\nI make a breakthrough in therapy or not\nwhat I control is whether I make an\nappointment with a psychiatrist and\nwhether I go I don't control whether the\nmedication they prescribe works like a\nmiracle or doesn't work at all I can't\ncontrol my own treatment resistance or\nmy own biology but I can control whether\nI try or not"
