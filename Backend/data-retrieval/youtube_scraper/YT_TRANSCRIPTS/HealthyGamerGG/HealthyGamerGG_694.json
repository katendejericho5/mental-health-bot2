    "transcript": "how do I develop healthy technology\nhabits I'll get this question from\nparents as well like how much screen\ntime is too much screen time and like\nall this kind of stuff and then I\nthought to myself well what if we just\ntook all the principles of intermittent\nfasting and apply them to Tech what if\nwe restricted our technology use to\neight hours a day because I think that\nsolves automatically a lot of problems\nso I decided to actually try it so for\nabout a two now it's been almost three\nweek period i implemented intermittent\nfasting for technology and what does\nthat mean that means that I restrict all\nof my Technologies to eight hours a day\nand you may say to yourself but hold on\na second like how is that possible like\nhow are you gonna have fun right because\nlike if I say something like that what's\nyour initial reaction I can't restrict\ntechnology usage to eight hours a day so\nyou really can't do that right because I\nhave to work for eight hours and work\nrequires technology right so it sounds\nimpossible but this is where actually\nit's like really really fantastic and it\nis way more manageable than you could\npossibly imagine"
