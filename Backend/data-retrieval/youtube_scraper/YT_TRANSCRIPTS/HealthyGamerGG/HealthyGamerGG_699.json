    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\novercome feeling intimidated\n[Music]\nand this is a big problem it's not\nsomething that people talk about a lot\nright because it's not like depression\nor bipolar disorder or suicidality but\nunfortunately it's like a really common\nexperience for a lot of people you're\nkind of going throughout your day and\nthen you run across someone who just\nfeels really intimidating this is\nsomeone that is kind of like maybe if\nthey're at work or if they're at school\nor maybe in even in a social setting\nwhere you meet someone who's just like\nbetter than you in some way and the way\nthat they're talking or the way that\nthey're acting or maybe they're giving a\npresentation they sort of evoke all of\nthese feelings of like kind of\ninferiority and then what happens is you\nkind of feel like you don't belong there\nyou look around and you start to see\nother people who are like better than\nyou at stuff hey y'all I want to take a\nmoment to talk about the sponsor of\ntoday's video Babble Babble is one of\nthe top language learning apps in the\nworld what I really love about Babel is\nthat instead of just wasting time on my\nphone I'm actually learning another\nlanguage it uses sounds it uses\ndifferent sorts of images and things\nlike that and it almost gamifies the\nlanguage learning process I also really\nlove that Babel is built by actual\nteachers so these are people that know\nwhat it's like to teach people and know\nwhat works and doesn't work the other\nreally cool thing is that their\nmethodology is scientifically validated\nso they've done studies that show that\nyou can gain a significant amount of\nproficiency in as little as three weeks\nand I've absolutely seen that so I love\nMexican food I live down here in Texas\nand I speak some Spanish but after using\nBabel for just a couple of weeks I found\nthat I can actually order in Spanish far\nmore proficiently so I'm learning\nphrases like Metro LA cuenta which means\ncan I have the check please which is\nlike really fantastic so it's really\neasy to learn so if y'all are interested\ncheck out the link in the description\nfor 60 off of your subscription and\nthank you to Babel for sponsoring\ntoday's video and what does it cause you\nto do it causes you to kind of like\nretreat right and then you have these\nkinds of thoughts like oh my God like I\ndon't belong here or these people are so\nmuch smarter than me better than me more\ncapable than me like I I don't know how\nI ended up there sometimes like you even\nfeel some degree of imposter syndrome I\nremember this happened to me when I was\ninterviewing for medical school and\nyou're like sitting in the waiting room\nwaiting for your interview with all\nthese other medical school applicants\nand you make small talk right and\nthey're telling you like oh yeah like hi\nmy name is so and so like what's your\nname oh okay like what are you\ninterested in I say I'm interested in\nthis and they say I'm interested in this\nand I did research in these labs and\nthen I worked for the United Nations and\nI I like did free surgeries for people\nin Africa and they start talking to you\nabout like how amazing they are and then\nI start to feel like terrible it's like\nI didn't do any of that stuff and then I\nstart to feel insecure and then I can't\nreally Retreat from it so sometimes I'm\nin my own head so now when I go into the\ninterview I'm not even thinking about\nmyself and how awesome I am all I'm\nthinking about is how this other person\nis better than me but in other\nsituations like social situations right\nyou meet someone and they feel\nintimidating and what do you do you kind\nof like retreat and so the real tragedy\nabout feeling intimidated is we have all\nof these thoughts and then we tend to\nretreat from those situations and every\ntime we Retreat life gets narrower right\nbecause now now I'm not able to go to\nthat party now I feel like I I don't\nbelong at that place I can't go hang out\nwith these people because there's this\nperson there who's better than me at\nsomething else and so what happens is\nour life becomes narrower and narrower\nand narrower in the worst cases we start\nspending more and more time in front of\nscreens we're spending more time at home\nand we're spending we feel safe with\npeople who don't really Inspire us right\nso what I sort of noticed in my own life\nis I started hanging out with people who\nnever intimidated me and the real\nchallenge is that a lot of the people\nthat didn't intimidate me were not the\npeople I needed to be spending my time\nwith and so the real tragedy of sort of\nletting intimidation control you is that\nit cuts you off from opportunities that\nyou should be engaging in because those\nare the people that you actually want as\nyour peers right those are the people\nthat you want to sort of be spending\ntime with that inspire you towards\npositive action but the problem is that\nthey don't inspire you they just\nintimidate you and as an aside we're not\ntalking about people who are trying to\nintimidate you that's a whole different\nthing right we're not talking about\nsomeone who's like walking up and\ngetting in your face and trying to like\ntell you to get the hell out of there\nand trying to make you feel unwelcome\nwhat I'm talking about is I think the\nfar more common experience of feeling\nintimidated with a group of people so\nlet's start by understanding a little\nbit about what does that actually look\nlike so sometimes people don't even\nrealize that they're feeling intimidated\nand what what that manifests as in the\nmind is you'll have all of these\nthoughts like you'll notice that okay\nthis person is so amazing I'm not as\ngood as they are I'm not as smart as\nthey are I'm not as articulate as they\nare I'm not as charismatic I'm not as\ngood looking so you'll kind of look at\nsomeone else and within yourself you\nwill notice thoughts of deficiencies the\nother way to sort of recognize\nintimidation is you will start to think\nabout what the other person thinks so\nyou'll think what will this person think\nwhen they see me this person is so put\ntogether and so articulate and so\nprofessional what are they going to see\nwhen they look at me they're going to\nsee someone who's a slob there's gonna\nthey're gonna see someone who's\nunprofessional and so you spend a lot of\ntime thinking about how other people\nwill perceive you in a negative light\nbut at its root this is a feeling of\nintimidation right because they're up\nthere and you're down here so if you\nhave those kinds of thoughts around\npeople hopefully we'll be able to help\nyou with that the second thing to\nunderstand is what is intimidation so\nintimidation is something that is\nactually has a very specific set of\nrequirements to trigger in your mind we\nactually don't get intimidated by\neveryone there's a lot of people out\nthere who are capable of doing things\nthat we're not capable of or not very\ngood at right there are people out there\nwho are good at cooking or good at\nplaying video games but it's not like\nevery person you encounter who is better\nthan eat you at something intimidates\nyou there are particular things that\nwe're sensitive to that make us feel\nintimidated and this is what's really\nwild is what makes us feel intimidated\nis actually identification with the\nperson when we see ourselves in another\nhuman being but that person does a\nbetter job of being us than we do that's\nwhen we feel intimidated when we look at\nsomeone else and we say I could do this\nif I were different if I was smarter I\nwould be like this person if I was more\ndisciplined I would be like this person\nit's they're just a version of me that's\nlike better than me right they're more\narticulate they're a little bit better\nlooking or this person made the right\nchoices when I made the wrong choices so\nif I had stayed in school or if I had\nchosen to become you know not switch\ninto pre-med and and stayed in computer\nscience or whatever if I decided not to\ngo to college and play pro League of\nLegends or valorent or whatever so what\nwe see what actually triggers the the\nsense of intimations is really important\nto understand is not that this person is\ndifferent from you it's that that for\nthe most part they're similar except for\none thing and that is the quality which\nyou feel is intimidating right so really\nthink about that for a second that what\ngets evoked as intimidation is actually\nthe way that you relate to the person\nand that you can see yourself in that\nperson except you were lacking in a\ncouple of different ways so intimidation\nis not about that person being different\nit's actually about that person being\nthe same and so the real problem with\nthis is when we see ourselves in someone\nelse and we think to ourselves wow I\ncould be that if I dot dot dot our\nnatural reaction is to beat ourselves up\nright because then you start to like\nlook at your life and you start to\nregret you're like oh I should have done\nthis differently or if I had woken up\nevery day or if I had studied harder or\nif I had you know spent some time like\nworking on my appearance or going to the\ngym then I could look like that person\nso as we beat ourselves up and we point\nout our shortcomings what does that do\npsychologically that makes us feel more\ninsecure it reinforces the insecurity\nand the more that we reinforce the\ninsecurity the more ammo there is for us\nto be intimidated because what is it\nthat's actually fueling that feeling of\nof intimidation it's actually our own\ninsecurities and this is why\nintimidation is so hard to overcome\nright and there may be some people out\nthere that give you answers like oh you\njust gotta you just got to do it you\ngotta like put yourself out there right\nand as you listen to these people who\nsay just put yourself out there you're\nlike bro or girl I don't think you\nunderstand what it's like when I put\nmyself out there you can put yourself\nout there because you're different from\nme that doesn't work for me and why is\nthat it's because when you put yourself\nout there you feel really bad you start\nto regret even more you start to beat\nyourself up and then it feeds the\ninsecurity and now you put yourself out\nthere once and now you're more insecure\nso what happens the next time you put\nyourself out there it's easier to feel\nintimidated and then you beat yourself\nup again and then you're like wow all\nthese other people can put themselves\nout there but I can't even put myself\nout there that feeds the insecurity even\nmore and then you try again because\neveryone's telling you just put yourself\nout there bro you try a third time and\neach time you go through the cycle it\ngets worse and now like now it makes\nsense why you can't put yourself out\nthere and why you think it's a bad idea\nand why it doesn't work for you because\nit literally doesn't work for you so\nlet's understand a couple of things\nfirst thing to really acknowledge if you\ncan but this may actually come at the\nend is that if you're there you deserve\nto be there if you get invited to a\nparty and you feel intimidated by other\npeople you still got invited to the\nparty so unless you're like literally\ntrespassing right or like somewhere\nwhere you really don't belong I'm not\nsaying like what your mind thinks you\ndon't belong unless you're trespassing\nor breaking a law you actually belong\nthere and that's something that I\nexperienced a ton when I started\nresidency at Harvard Medical Schools\nlike I felt really intimidated I was\nlike look at all these amazing people\nout there turns out I'm pretty amazing\ntoo and so are you and the second thing\nthat we're going to tell you to do maybe\na little bit scary but it's really\nreally effective okay so if we think a\nlittle bit about intimidation we\nrecognize equality in that person that\nwe think is good right otherwise you\nwouldn't be intimidated by it they're so\narticulate the other problem with\nintimidation is that we're in our own\nheads and you may notice that the more\nyou are in your own head the worse the\nsituation becomes oh my God what is this\nperson going to think what should I say\nI don't belong here I should go home I\nshould run away oh my God oh my God oh\nmy God you're all up in here so you're\nnot able to enjoy the experience\naudience at all you're not actually able\nto participate so what we need to do is\nexternalize your attention and the way\nthat we're going to do that is going to\nbe absolutely terrifying but it works\nreally well okay so we actually want to\ndo is Express appreciation for the thing\nthat we think is pretty cool so\nrecognize that when you feel\nintimidation the flip side of that coin\nis actually appreciation because you're\nseeing something in someone else that is\nlike a positive quality that's why you\nfeel intimidated because you don't have\nit so one thing that you can actually do\nwhich is really wild is walk up to that\nperson and say hey I really appreciate\ndot dot dot so if someone gives a good\npresentation in class and you feel like\nthat person's presentation is way better\nthan yours after class walk up to him\nand say hey I really I thought your\npresentation was fantastic I\nparticularly like the way that you did A\nB and C now this may sound absolutely\nterrifying and we're going to help you\nout with that but let's understand why\nit works so I recently saw a really\ninteresting study that if you look at\npeople who are depressed people have\nmood disorders and active depressive\nepisodes the idea is that normally like\nthey need help right so what we should\nreally do is try to help them a lot\nbecause they're depressed and they need\nhelp but there's a study that actually\nfound that when people who are depressed\nhelp other people it actually improves\ntheir symptoms so sometimes what we need\nto do is take that feeling of\nintimidation and recognize that you\ncan't be intimidated unless you\nappreciate or respect something about\nsomeone that's the only way that it can\nhappen unless they're trying to\nintimidate you obviously and so then\nwhat we actually want to do is instead\nof giving in to the negative\nmanifestation of this emotion what we\nactually want to do is kind of flip it\naround and express some appreciation and\nyou all may have heard about things like\nexpressing gratitude and like changing\nyour mindset and all this kind of crap\nthis is literally how you do it you walk\nup to that person and say hey I really\nappreciate the way that you presented\nthat that was a really cool presentation\nand now suddenly what you've done is\nyou've externalized it a little bit\nwe're going to help you all if you're\nall over thinking oh my God but then\nwhat I can't say that we're going to\nhelp you don't worry wait wait with me\nbear with me okay so first thing we've\ndone is externalize we've also engaged\nwith that person so instead of\nretreating from it which causes\nnarrowing of your life and closing of\ndoors and opportunities we're actually\nlike not being intimidated by it right\nyou may feel intimidation but you can go\nand you can express appreciation because\nthat's authentic that's what's really\ncool it's not actually being fake it's\nactually channeling something that you\nfeel towards this person okay but then\nthen what and that's where you can sort\nof follow it up with an open-ended\nquestion so you can walk up to someone\nyou can say hey I really appreciate\ninsert quality that I am intimidated by\ncan you tell me a little bit about why\nyou chose that as a topic or you know\nlet's say you're intimidated by\nsomeone's appearance I know this sounds\nkind of weird but this is something that\nI've done that works really well you can\nwalk up to someone at a party and say\nhey you're really rocking that jacket\nlike that looks lit right and just think\nabout that how would someone feel if you\nwalked up to them and you said that now\nif you sort of play it too far I'm\nsaying say one thing don't keep on oh\nand your hair is beautiful and I love\nyour skin and I love your shoes and I\nlove everything about you you're just so\nmagn don't do that that's terrifying\nokay so just say the one thing don't be\nlike verbal diary on them of\nappreciation so just say one thing hey I\nreally appreciate this thing and then\nfollow it up with some kind of question\nlike that's a rocking jacket how did you\ndecide to wear that today right or if\nsomeone's giving a presentation you can\nsay hey I really love the way that you\nsort of put together that table or that\nMeme at the end was brilliant you know\ncan you tell me a little bit about why\nyou chose this topic so ask an\nopen-ended question it shouldn't be a\nyes or no question that's really\nimportant and then just ask that and\nthen it doesn't have to be a long\ninteraction so here's the other thing\nbecause what people are oftentimes\nterrified is like what do they say then\nright and that's where it's like\nsometimes if you even go up to someone\nand compliment them who's embarrassed\nnow right because when you walk\nup to someone you say hey this is a\nreally fantastic presentation I love\nthat Meme at the end you just say it\nwith a smile and then they're like oh my\nGod\nright and suddenly they're feeling\nembarrassed and you've made them feel\ngood right which is pretty cool and so\nif you're worried about how to extract\nyourself from the conversation you can\neven just say hey so like they say oh\nthis is how I chose to to you know put\ntogether this presentation so you ask\nyour question and then they're going to\ncome back to you and maybe that it'll\nturn into a conversation but you're\nterrified how do I make it into a\nconversation you can't make it into a\nconversation you don't need to make it\ninto a conversation you went there to\nsay your piece if they engage with you\nengage back right so we're gonna hit the\ntennis ball across the court we're gonna\nwait for it to come back if it doesn't\ncome back you can say well I just wanted\nto share with that with you awesome\npresentation right and then you can just\nwalk away just extract yourself from the\ncon it's okay you just walk up and say\nhey I thought you did a fantastic job\npleasure to meet you my name is so and\nso I was curious about this thank you so\nmuch and then you just walk out and so\nwhat does this do this is really\nimportant because it does a couple of\nreally key things the first is it allows\nus to not Retreat right this is what's\nreally important and then we'll develop\nsome degree of Tolerance we're not\ngiving in to the intimidation the second\nis that it takes that authentic gap\nbetween you and the other person and\nsort of like that thing that you\nappreciate about them and you're\nactually like vocalizing it and you're\nowning it and like that's okay you're\nactually engaging with this person\nyou're also externalizing your attention\nand if you need a little bit of help\nextracting yourself from the\nconversation that's totally fine some of\ny'all may be thinking to yourselves I\ncould never do that you'd be surprised\nhave a little bit of faith in yourself\nI've got faith in you but the other\nthing that you can do if you're\nterrified of actually engaging with that\nperson or if the sense of intimidation\nis too strong okay I'm not going to tell\nyou to just do it I acknowledge that\nthere's an internal process that you can\nalso do in the safety of your own home\nokay with no one watching which is I\nwant you to think about okay what do I\nsee in this person because what you see\nin that person honestly if you really\npay attention you see a version of\nyourself and really tunnel down into\nthat and ask yourself what is really\ndifferent between this person and me and\nwhile your mind May generate a thousand\ndifferent answers I want you to kind of\npick the one that feels the most\nimportant to you even if your mind comes\nup with five answers you can write them\nall down and you can like say okay which\none is the biggest one because one of\nthem is going to be driving it and then\nnotice that quality and then just ask\nyourself right because you see the\npossibility of yourself in that person\nthat's why you feel intimidated and so\npick that one thing and then ask\nyourself a second question which is what\nis one thing that I can do to move\ntowards that goal how can I move one\nstep closer to being what this person\nhas and this is what's really important\nis oftentimes when we get intimidated by\nsomeone we want to be them so we don't\nthink about one thing we think about the\nthousand different things that I need to\ndo before I become what that person is\nand that's why you got to be a little\nbit careful don't worry about the\nthousand things your mind may tell you\noh there's no way you can ever get there\nbecause there's so many things that are\ndifferent instead pick one thing and ask\nyourself okay so this person was\narticulate what can I do to be more\narticulate maybe I should practice my\npresentations for 15 minutes before I\ngive them okay so you really try to\nTunnel it down into one thing and\nImplement that one thing the really cool\nthing is when you do that not only do\nyou become more articulate because\nyou're practicing and you're intentional\nbut the other really cool thing is\ninstead of just being like weighed down\nby this intimidation or treating from it\nyou're actually improving in some small\nway and as you start to improve in some\nsmall way we're going to start to see\nthe reverse cycle where now instead of\nlike feeding your insecurity and feeling\nmore intimidated you'll start to develop\na tiny bit of confidence as you start to\ndevelop a tiny bit of confidence as you\nre-engage with people you'll be more\ncomfortable being there as you're more\ncomfortable being there you start to\nenjoy it a little bit more because\nyou're comfortable and that's why we\ndon't like it because we're\nuncomfortable and then as you're able to\nbe there a little bit more you'll see\nthe reverse of the Vicious Cycle where\nnow you're more comfortable and you're\nhanging out with them you start to form\nrelationships now the next time you\nthink about going it isn't as scary to\ngo the second time and the third time\nand each time you kind of do this\nprocess you will get a little bit better\nso it's really unfortunate that\noftentimes we feel really intimidated by\npeople who aren't even trying we're\nwalking around going about our business\nand we enter into situations where we\nsee people who are smarter than us more\narticulate than us more attractive than\nus more physically in shape than us more\nknowledgeable than us we walk around the\nworld and our mind sees all kinds of\nthings and when we feel that\nintimidation it manifestes all these\nthoughts like oh my God like this person\nis so much better than me or whatever or\nyou start to think about what they will\nsee when they look at me oh my God what\nis this person gonna think I am so\npathetic I'm so not put together they're\nso put together and if you notice\nthere's a comparison and the reason that\nyou feel intimidated is actually because\nyou see a version of yourself in that\nperson this person has accomplished what\nyou could have done if you had made\ndifferent choices or wear slightly\ndifferent human being if you are more\ndisciplined and lived up to your\npotential then you could be that person\nand so when you see that person you see\nyour own regret and that's what your\nmind actually tries to retreat from\nbecause if you think about why does the\nMind Retreat when we feel intimidated\nit's to try to protect us from feeling\nthat regret that we see when when we\nencounter that other person and if we\nmove away from the other person then\nthere's no regret the challenge is that\nas we move away from that person we\nstart to narrow the scope of our life\ndoors start to close because now I can't\ngo to that entrepreneurship conference\nnow I can't go to this extracurricular\nactivity I can't go to this party I\ncan't apply for this job interview and\nso our life becomes smaller and smaller\nand smaller and then it becomes more and\nmore insecure right because we have\nfewer things to be proud of in the whole\ncycle repeats itself so instead\nrecognize that actually the reason that\nyou feel intimidated is because you are\ncapable of what the other person is you\njust need to make some changes and in\nthe short term one thing that you can\nreally do to avoid that Retreat and\navoid getting trapped in your own head\nis just Express appreciation towards\nthat person even if it's a little bit\nuncomfortable for you certainly makes\ntheir day right so like that's pretty\ncool and acknowledge that hey I really\nappreciate this thing that's why I feel\nintimidated you don't have to share that\nright so you just walk up and say hey I\nreally appreciate this followed up with\na question and if they choose not to\nengage with you because maybe they're\nembarrassed by the positive feedback and\nthey don't know what to say then you can\nsay hey I just wanted to share that\nthank you so much it was a great\npresentation it was nice to meet you and\nthen you walk away and even if that is\nscary you can go through this\nintrospective process of recognizing\nokay what do I see in this other person\nand how can I take one step towards that\ndon't try to become the other person but\nwhat can I do just one step forward\nthat'll help me move towards this goal\nbecause I know I'm capable if you didn't\nknow you were capable you wouldn't be\nintimidated by it in the first place\nforeign"
