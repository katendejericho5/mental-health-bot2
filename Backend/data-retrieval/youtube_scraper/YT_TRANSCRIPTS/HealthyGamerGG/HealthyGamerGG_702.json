    "transcript": "all right so today we're going to talk\nabout how to deal with people who are\nemotionally manipulative\n[Music]\nthis is like such a big problem because\nthere are some people out there who if\nyou're in a relationship with them\nalways make things your fault right like\neven when you criticize them or you're\nkind of like trying to tell them to hey\nstop doing this you really need to be\ndoing better if you say anything to them\nlike any kind of conflict or even\nremotely thing that's close to conflict\nsomehow becomes your fault so they\nengage in particular behaviors or like\nevoke certain feelings in you where they\nkind of make you feel like crap and then\nyou're in this weird sort of situation\nwhere like every moment that goes by or\nevery day that goes by they're kind of\nsitting there and you're feeling like\nworse and worse and worse and then you\neven see that they're doing this to you\nyou see that like hey I'm feeling\nmanipulated I'm being put into a corner\nbut you can't like deal with it right so\nthe guilt builds up or you feel like\nmore and more of an and\neventually you kind of give in and then\nthere's some degree of Harmony for some\namount of time but inside you there's\nlike some amount of resentment building\nup too right because you kind of you\nwere trying to tell them like hey this\nproblem in this relationship that we're\nhaving like you're somewhat responsible\nfor it too but if you ever open that\ndoor with them the emotional\nmanipulation begins again so they'll\nengage in particular behaviors or like\nmake you feel a particular way and then\nit's almost like they're like\nbludgeoning you or bullying you using\nyour own emotions and so you feel out of\ncontrol and you feel powerless and you\nfeel frustrated but this is the kind of\ntricky thing is like even if you ever\ntry to set a boundary with them they\nmake you feel like an\nand if advocating for yourself in a\nrelationship makes you feel like an\n or a piece of that is a\nproblem and today we're going to teach\nyou a little bit about how to deal with\nthat situation how to understand that\nsituation how to understand yourself how\nto understand them and literally what to\nsay to sort of level that playing field\nand help them take responsibility if\nyou're in a situation like this you\nreally encourage that person to seek at\nleast a mental health evaluation because\na lot of these things it's not that this\nperson is bad it's that the way that\nthey learned how to relate to their own\nemotions may be indicative of some kind\nof traumatic experience in childhood\nwhere a therapist could really help them\non the flip side if you're in one of\nthese situations you can absolutely get\ntherapy as well to sort of help you\nmanage the stress but this is sort of\nwhy we designed a coaching program to\nsort of help people understand these\nkinds of principles\nas you go through life what is it that\ncontrols your behavior what are the\nthings in your life that like\nyou know or wrong but you can't really\nfix because there's something internal\nthat gets in the way so if you really\nwant insight into like okay why do I\nprocrastinate or why do I end up in\nthese situations over and over and over\nagain or how do I better understand this\nbalance of okay this is what's an\nappropriate emotion and this is what's\ninappropriate and how can I balance\nthose things to move in the right\ndirection then definitely check out\ncoaching\nso let's start with this who are you you\nare a good person you are someone who\ndoes not like to feel negative emotion\nand you are someone who when you feel\nbad about something you tend to try to\ndo things to fix it this is what it\nusually takes to develop a relationship\nwith someone who emotionally manipulates\nyou right you have to be like when you\nfeel guilty or ashamed or angry or\nsomething like that you need to deal\nwith those negative emotions by fixing\nsomething in the situation so if I'm\nfeeling guilty I can't just sit and feel\nguilty I'm not like an who can\njust be like ah screw you right that\nactually bothers me I can't be a\nsociopath so I have to be like when I\nfeel negative emotions I have to do\nsomething to fix those negative emotions\nwhich means chances are you are a decent\nhuman being now let's talk about the\nperson that you're in the relationship\nwith now this person\nis not necessarily a bad human being by\nany means and I've worked with a lot of\npeople who are very emotionally\nmanipulative who have like psychiatric\ndiagnoses and so we'll talk about that\nin a second\nbut the most common thing for the person\nwho is emotionally manipulative is a\nhistory of trauma so they may have a\ndiagnosis may not have a diagnosis we're\ntalking about things like cptsd we're\ntalking about BPD we're talking about\ngrowing up with parents who are\nnarcissistic or abusive\nso chances are the person that you're in\nthe relationship with has some degree of\ntrauma\nthe other thing that we really have to\nconsider is that the way that they\nmanage their emotions is by offloading\nthem onto another human being so let's\ntake a look at how that works okay\nhere's you\nokay and here's the person you're in the\nrelationship with\nand when you're in a relationship with\nsomeone sometimes something happens\nthere's some kind of conflict or\nwhatever like it doesn't doesn't really\nmatter what it is but this person starts\nto feel some amount of negative emotion\nand so as their negative emotion starts\nto build up what is the way in which\nthey process or deal with that negative\nemotion now this is the key thing to\nunderstand about trauma when we have a\nhistory of trauma in our lives or even\nit's not like you have to be you know\nassaulted in some way or something like\nthat it can also be like in a neglectful\nhousehold the key thing here is these\nare people who when they were growing up\ndid not learn usually growing up did not\nlearn how to manage their emotions in a\nhealthy way\nso what does this mean for you this\nmeans as their negative emotions start\nto rise what a you know what a healthy\nhuman being would do is they'd start to\nlike manage these emotions through stuff\nlike meditation or therapy or you know\ngoing for exercise or maybe having a spa\nday you know like going out with friends\nand then you know like like sort of\noffloading those emotions in sort of a\nhealthy way maybe playing volleyball or\nvideo games or whatever but that's not\nwhat these people do what do these\npeople do\nthey transfer their emotions over to you\nso as they start to feel bad they engage\nin certain kinds of behaviors or they\nuse words or something like that that\nthen makes you start to feel bad\nright and so like a good example of this\nis like\nlet's say you're dating someone\nand you all get into an argument and\nyou're pissed off at them because\nwhatever whatever you guys get into some\nkind of argument and they do this kind\nof thing where they just like start\ncrying right and they don't like talk to\nyou they just start crying they start to\nfeel bad their negative emotions start\nto rise and they don't say anything to\nyou or they'll say like I wish that you\nunderstood me or I wish you would listen\nor like I just feel so unloved right now\nor like they'll just say like some\nrandom crap like they don't even\nnecessarily accuse you in some\nsituations it is absolutely like an\naccusation we'll get to those in a\nsecond but as this negative emotion\nstarts to build up like they start\ntransferring it over to you right\nthey're like some kind of I don't know\nlike some\nreverse energy vampire kind of thing\nwhere instead of like sucking your\nnegative emotion away they're like\ntransferring negative emotion to you\nit's like some kind of umbilical cord\nwhere then what happens is as you start\nto feel guilty\nright then this guilty becomes\nunmanageable and like why is and this\nalso kind of explains\nwhy I'm so excited about this so why\nlike every scenario ends up like this\nit's because even if both you all are\nfighting there's this umbilical cord\nwhere they are transferring their\nnegative emotion to you which explains\nwhy no matter what the conflict is you\nalways end up feeling like crap and\nthey're like kind of okay with it do you\nall get that like there are these\nscenarios where both y'all are fighting\nbut something is happening where like\nthe longer the fight goes\nthe more stable they seem to get and the\nmore unstable you're getting and that's\nbecause there's this emotional transfer\nof energy they'll engage in particular\nbehaviors they'll say certain things\nthat make you feel worse and worse and\nworse and now here's the key thing\nso since you are someone\nWho does these kinds of things right so\nyou manage that emotion through healthy\nbehaviors you don't just transfer it to\nsomeone else usually what you end up\ndoing is the this emotion gets so much\nto bear because not only is it like your\nown intrinsic guilt which is maybe like\nthis much of it right this is your own\nintrinsic guilt but then there's the\ntransferred guilt as well so that what\nthis sort of means is that you like\nthey'll kind of like it's almost like a\ngame of chicken where you will\nexperience more negative emotion in the\nrelationship before they do and then\neventually you'll it'll be too much for\nyou and then you'll cave right they're\nsitting there crying you feel like such\nan so then eventually you're\nlike I'm sorry fine and then like you do\nsomething like you get flowers or like\nyou make them a nice meal or you\napologize or you tell them that you love\nthem and then what you have to do is\ntake these negative emotions and you\ngotta bottle them up they get to keep\ncrying but you don't get to keep crime\nright or in a situation of like anger\nright if you're with someone who's like\nlike emotionally manipulative and is\nlike angry at you you don't get to feel\nangry with them right you just have to\ntake it and you have to say yeah you're\nright or you have to cave and be nice to\nthem or something like that like there's\nsomething that happens where you end up\nhaving to take this crap and you have to\nmanage it you have to change Behavior\nyou have to appease them in some way and\nthen you feel terrible about it\nso what do we do about this situation\nokay\nso a couple of things to understand\nthe first\nis what we need to do to fix the\nsituation fundamentally is we've got to\nstop this like transfer of emotion from\nthem to you you need to be able to\nequalize\nresponsibility of fixing the problem in\nthe relationship okay so how are we\ngoing to do that so the first thing that\nwe're going to do is vocalize our own\nemotions and then instead of us fixing\nthe problem we are going to try to\nencourage them to fix it with us and\nI'll give you all an example of what\nthat means let's say that I get into an\nargument and then my partner just starts\ncrying right and then I feel guilty and\nthey're like oh I can't believe you\ndon't understand me and then like\nthey're not like proactive about trying\nto fix it you all get that they're just\nexpressing a lot of emotion and kind of\ntransferring it to you and it's sort of\nyour responsibility to figure out how to\nmake this better that's what's so\nfrustrating about emotional manipulation\nso instead what we're going to do is\nwe're going to say hey I can see that\nyou're upset I'm feeling upset as well I\nknow this is important\nwhat do you think we can do to fix this\nand this is where they're going to come\nback with all kinds of other crap that\nwill be emotionally damaging because\nthey don't want to accept responsibility\nwhy do they need to accept\nresponsibility because thus far in the\nrelationship they've been feeling like\ncrap and they just transfer that crap to\nyou I'm gonna ship you all of my\nemotional crap and then you're gonna pay\noff that debt I haven't needed to fix it\nso far and that also is sort of not\ntheir fault because they probably grew\nup in a situation where that is exactly\nwhat happened to them so that's the\nrules of the game as they learn them\nthey haven't learned how to do like\nshared decision making or shared problem\nsolving\ninstead of what you're going to say is\nyou're going to say hey I can see that\nyou're really upset I'm feeling really\nupset too you vocalize your emotions and\nthen you can say what do you think we\ncan do to sort of move forward from here\nso what you're going to kind of do is\ndump it in their lap you can say what\ncan we do and this is where what you're\ngoing to see is an emotional escalation\nit's not fair problem it's your problem\nso they're going to say I can't believe\nyou don't understand me I've tried to\nexplain if you don't know this is one of\nmy favorites if you don't know what's\nwrong I don't know how to explain it to\nyou\nright they'll use phrases like that\nwhich is like that's so frustrating\nbecause like you know and so they're\ngoing to say things like that and then\nwhat you're going to do is you're gonna\nrepeat back them you don't want to get\nemotional you want to say I'm hearing\nyou say that you know you expect me to\nunderstand what is going on in your head\nand in your mind and you expect me to\nknow these things I'm sorry I don't are\nyou able to communicate that to me\nand if they say I they're not going to\nbe able to answer that question they're\ngoing to dodge so be prepared for the\nemotional manipulation they're going to\nsay look oh if you don't know what's\nwrong I don't know how to say it and\nthen it's like what you're going to do\nis just pause for a second okay so\nthere's some of this is internal you\ndon't even have to say it notice that\nhey\nthey're expecting you to know what's\ngoing on with them but they're the ones\nwho are living it and they can't even\narticulate it so why on Earth are they\nexpecting you to know what's going on\nwith them if they're the ones that are\nhave a hundred percent info and they\ncan't articulate it so then what you're\ngoing to do is you're going to say hey\nuntil you're able to articulate this I'm\nsorry I'm not telepathic\nI think in order to fix this problem I'm\ngoing to need your help if you're not\nable to articulate what's wrong I think\nI need to take a step back from this if\nat some point you're willing to have a\nconversation about it please let me know\nand then we're gonna step back then\nthey're gonna start crying over and over\nand over again and that's when like even\nif they cry if you leave the room right\nwhat's gonna happen they're gonna start\ncrying louder\nthis he's leaving the room and\nI'm crying I'ma show him I'm gonna start\ncrying I'm gonna start\nthere'll be an emotional escalation\nright and so that's where you can say\nhey I can see that you're getting more\nand more upset I don't know how to\nengage with you\nunless you're able to articulate what\nthe problems are I'm sorry you're\nfeeling upset I'm feeling really\nfrustrated as well when you've calmed\ndown if you're able to engage I really\nhope you're able to but the key thing\nthat must happen must must must must\nmust happen is they must take\nresponsibility for some of their own\nemotions and the problem solving in the\nrelationship\nthe key thing for you to understand is\nthat they are going to make you feel\nguilty and what we're going to do is\nwe're going to take that guilt that we\nfeel and we're going to pass half of it\nback to them we're not going to say all\nkinds of negative things to them that\ndoesn't really work well right we're not\ngonna say you don't love me and you do\nthis and you do this We're not gonna do\nthat we're going to say hey I need your\nhelp\nto fix this problem\nare you going to be my partner in this\nthat's the general approach and they can\nemotionally escalate as much as they\nwant to and then what you are going to\nsay you're going to articulate this to\nthem and articulate this to yourself I\ncannot fix this relationship by myself\nthere is no way you've been trying right\nyou've been trying to manage their\nemotions and your own but if this is a\nrelationship they've got to be\nparticipants\nand so as you tell yourself that just\nsay hey like this is what it's going to\ntake to fix the relationship I'm gonna\nneed their help you can articulate some\nof that to them but you don't have to\nshare all that but that's how you manage\nyour own emotions then you just notice\nthis pattern recognize that a lot of\nwhat you're feeling is actually being\noffloaded by them and is not yours to\nfix\nbecause the other thing that happens\nis that when these situations arise\nyou're left guessing how to fix it they\ndon't even articulate what they want you\nto do so you're just like left feeling\nguilty and then you're like trying to\nlike you know play darts with a\nblindfold and you're trying to hit the\nbullseye and like you don't even know\nwhat they want right and so then you're\njumping through a thousand Hoops whereas\nif they took some responsibility to tell\nyou hey here's what I need to feel\nbetter then it would be like so much\nless effort for you but you're left like\nspinning your wheels and and blind and\nstuff like that you don't know how to\nfix it but you keep trying you keep\ntrying you keep trying because you feel\nguilty you feel guilty you feel guilty\nand then what ends up happening is\noftentimes we'll get so frustrated that\nwe just have to break up with them or\nsomething like that and then that\ncreates a whole other thing where they\nlike start to you know escalate even\nfurther and because anytime they feel\nnegative emotion what are they going to\ndo they're going to use that emotional\numbilical cord to dump it back on you\njust recognize all of the stuff that's\ngoing on and if you want to engage in a\nrelationship with this person which I\nknow that the internet will say oh this\nperson is emotionally able to break up\nwith them the truth of the matter is\nthat like half the human beings on the\nplanet are in relationships with people\nwho are like emotionally manipulative in\nsome way right I don't even have\nstatistics about that that's just my gut\nokay\nkey thing though is that like a lot of\ntimes we don't want to break up with\nthis person because this person isn't\nlike a bad human being they just don't\nknow how to articulate their emotions\nthey don't know how to accept\nresponsibility for their emotions they\ndon't know how to be a partner in a\nrelationship so what we actually need to\ndo is if you want to try to maintain\nsome kind of relationship with them is\nuse this technique right first of all\nrecognize the emotional transfer and\nthen acknowledge their emotions and then\nwhat we're going to do is instead of\nlike us being omniscient we're going to\nadmit our failures and we're going to\nask for a help\nhey I need your help to figure out like\nhow to move forward from here how are we\ngoing to fix this so you want to use\nlike first person plural language if\nthey they're going to come back with all\nthis kind of crap and they're going to\nsay oh if you don't know then I don't\nknow how to tell you and you can say\nyeah that's really hard for me when I'm\nin a relief you just want to State\nwhat's happening\nI'm in a relationship with someone who\nis not able to articulate what they\nthink is wrong I don't know how to fix\nthat relationship\nperiod\nI can't fix relationships in which my\npartner can't articulate what's wrong\nperiod\nand then they'll start crying a lot and\nthen you can say like okay I can see\nthat I'm telling you I need help and I'm\nnot getting the help I'm not getting any\ncommunication I'm going to step away\nfrom this situation and then what you\nneed to do is like step away from a\nsensory standpoint you can say hey I'm\ngonna like step outside\nI love you very much I just can't\nfunction in this kind of situation\nif at some point you're able to\nparticipate in a conversation great I'm\nmore than happy to have it I don't see\nthat that's I can't fix this without you\nlove you and then you peace out\nright you step away so if y'all are\nlistening to this you may start to think\nwell I don't think this would actually\nwork with the relationship that I'm in\nthe emotional manipulation is so strong\nthat these this kind of limit setting\nmay not be successful and so what we're\ngoing to do is give you all a sort of\neasier option that moves things in the\nright direction so the core of the\nproblem right now is that when your\npartner or the person you're in the\nrelationship with parent child whatever\nfriend when they start to feel negative\nemotions they displace those emotions on\nyou your negative emotions pile up and\nthen you end up giving in in some way\nthat's why we use the phrase emotional\nmanipulation because they're changing\nyour behavior but it feels like you're\nkind of being pushed into a corner in\nthese these emotions like guilt or maybe\nthey're crying or they're sad or\nwhatever they're they're engaging in\ncertain ways where they're like forcing\nyour behavior\nand so this is the other really tricky\nthing is that a lot of times what we may\nsort of think is okay if they're forcing\nyou into a behavior just don't do it\nright use willpower and resist just\nresist set limits set boundaries but the\nwhole point is that we can't do that if\nwe were able to resist our emotions then\nwe wouldn't be in this situation in the\nfirst place so instead what we're going\nto do is teach all a slightly different\ntechnique to change the dynamic of the\nrelationship so the core of the problem\nhere is that you're engaging in\nbehaviors in the relationship without\nkind of getting credit for it right and\nif you really think about it they're not\nreally asking you what they want they\nstart crying and then you feel guilty\nand then you're left playing this kind\nof guessing game to try to fulfill their\nwants and even when you do something\npositive in the relationship it doesn't\nfeel like a win right it still feels\nlike a loss even if you do something to\nhelp them stop crying or demonstrate\nyour love or provide emotional support\nyou feel like you were kind of forced\ninto it instead of them like asking you\nfor something and you kind of like doing\nyour fair share\nso the tricky thing about this is that\neven when you do that kind of stuff it's\nreinforcing the behavior of emotional\nmanipulation because now when they\nexpress emotions and then make you feel\nguilty and then you do the quote unquote\nright thing what are you actually\nreinforcing in the relationship you're\nreinforcing them to emotionally\nmanipulate you more because this is how\nthey get their needs met and this is\nwhat's so infuriating for so many people\nis they don't realize like how do I get\nin this situation why does this keep\nhappening it's because you're\nreinforcing the behavior because if\nemotionally manipulating you gets you to\ndo what they want they're gonna keep\ndoing it so instead what we need to do\nis if you can't set a boundary or resist\nthen what we need to do is change the\nway that they get their needs met and\nwhat we're going to focus on is having\nthem articulate what they want so the\nkey thing is it's not that you don't\nhave to do it or you need to break up\nwith them or any of that stuff you know\nif you want to do that that's your\nchoice but a lot of people want to try\nto make these relationships work and if\nyou want to do that you the key thing is\ninstead of reinforcing their emotional\nmanipulation reinforce their\narticulation so this is where as they\nstart crying for example you don't want\nto give in to the crying but you can say\nhey I see that you're really hurt can\nyou help me understand what you need in\nthis moment to help you feel better can\nyou please let me know what you think\nI've done wrong or you know what can I\ndo it it hurts me so much so own that\nemotion to see you cry I'm really\nworried about you please let me know\nwhat I can do to help so there's\nsomething really tricky there you're not\nreally giving in per se but you're also\nnot saying hey like I'm not gonna I'm\nnot gonna help you and like this is your\nemotions and you need to handle it so\nyou want to be emotionally supportive\nbut this is the key thing you're not\ngoing to do anything until they ask for\nit because what really weighs on people\nwhat really Burns people out in\nemotional emotionally manipulative\nrelationships is that they're left\nguessing all the time the other person\ndoesn't even ask you to do anything they\njust sort of force you into doing stuff\nand so instead of what we want to do is\nyou say hey can you please let me know\nwhat I can do to help you feel better\nand then if they articulate it you can\nprovide it right presuming it's an\nappropriate kind of response and that's\nreally important because what we want to\ndo is shift their behavior we want to\nsort of encourage them to actually\narticulate what they want and then we\ncan do it for them the more that you're\nable to do that it's going to change the\ndynamic of your relationship so now\ninstead instead of hopefully emotionally\nmanipulating you as you do this more and\nmore they're able to actually articulate\nhey what you did the other day made me\nfeel collected and hurt and I really\nfeel like you should have spent more\ntime with me I think you should have\ndone this I think you should have done\nthis and then that's when you can say\nokay thank you for letting me know how\nyou feel and now instead of making you\nfeel guilty they're communicating with\nyou that still may make you feel guilty\nand they may ask you to do things that\nare a little bit unreasonable but it's a\nstep in the right direction so if you're\nnot able to like kind of take a step\nback and walk away from the conversation\nif your emotions get the better of you\nthis is a technique that can actually\nwork a little bit better\nso the tricky thing about being in a\nrelationship with an emotionally\nmanipulative person and this is the the\nkey problem is that they will like evoke\nemotions in you and then you are left\nmanaging those emotions and trying to\nfix the problem even if you try to\ncriticize them\nor you like sort of ask for their help\nor you point out to them things that\nthey're doing wrong they will somehow\nactivate their emotional circuitry turn\non your emotional circuitry and make\ntheir faults your problem to fix and\nthis is an unsustainable relationship\nand it's incredibly frustrating but the\nproblem is that we have this\nvulnerability right because they've\nlearned some really interesting\ntechnique which is this like emotional\noffloading so the more negative emotion\nthey experience they start offloading it\nto you which means that their boat isn't\nsinking they're taking on some water but\nwhat they're doing is they're taking all\nthe water that their boat is taking on\nthey're transferring it to you so you\nstart to sink faster than they sink so\nit's like a game of chicken where you\nhave to cave and you ultimately have to\nfix this problem and then the problem is\nthat even when you start to cave and you\nfix the problem what have you actually\nreinforced you've reinforced that when\nthere is a problem in our relationship\nthe right way to fix it is to make you\nfeel emotionally worse right because if\nthat person can make you feel\nemotionally bad and worse and worse and\nworse and worse until you they reach\nthat threshold then you'll fix it so\nthis is sort of like you know it's kind\nof like a roommate who like I'm not\ngoing to do the dishes and you get\npissed off about the dishes more than I\ndo so I never have to do the dishes all\nI have to do is wait until you get so\npissed off about the dishes that you'll\ndo them on your own and so this is the\nfrustrating thing about being in a\nrelationship with an emotionally\nmanipulative person is that you're in a\nrelationship but\nyou're the one who's kind of like doing\nall the work right it's not like a real\nrelationship where it's a partnership\nwith shared problem solving it's\nsomething where no matter like if you\nhave a problem they're gonna emotionally\nlet you know and if they have a problem\nyou try to tell them they're gonna flip\nit back around on you so literally what\nyou need to do is recognize this\ntransfer of energy invite them to\nparticipate and also be able to step\naway and kind of absolve yourself of\ntheir part of it you can't accept 100\nresponsibility for fixing the\nrelationship which is absolutely what\nhappens you have to accept at most fifty\npercent and put the other 50 on them and\nif they want to cry about it that's\ntheir choice you can't make a\nrelationship work for two people"
