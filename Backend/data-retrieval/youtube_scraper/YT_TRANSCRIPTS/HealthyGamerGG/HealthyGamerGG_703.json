    "transcript": "so this is what's really bizarre if you\nhave trouble waking up in the morning\nlike let's say you have trouble waking\nup at 7am try waking up earlier try\nwaking up one hour earlier or two hour\nearlier because what we all assume is\nthat oh I will wake up after eight hours\nof sleep and then it'll be easy for me\nto wake up not necessarily so sometimes\nyou need to wake up after six hours of\nsleep or five and a half hour or you\nknow wake up two hours earlier and then\nyou may be tired at the end of the day\nbut waking up will be easier and then if\nyou're tired at the end of the day you\ncan go to sleep and then you still wake\nup at like 5 30 or 6. so one really\ninteresting technique is if you're\nhaving trouble waking up and getting out\nof bed you may be waking up in the\nmiddle of your sleep cycle so instead\nand this is where oftentimes we can't\nshift it later right so you can wake up\nnaturally if you let it finish but since\nwe can't do that what we actually want\nto do is wake up even earlier and it'll\nbe easier to wake up and you'll feel\nthat more body fatigue as the day goes\non which is actually totally fine and\nthen you turn in early and then you get\na full eight and a half hours of sleep\nand you wake up at 5 30. so that's how\nyou reset your sleep schedule"
