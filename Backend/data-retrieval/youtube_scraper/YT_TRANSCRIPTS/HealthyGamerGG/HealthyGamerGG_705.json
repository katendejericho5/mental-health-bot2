    "transcript": "so when you force people to\nre-experience trauma before they are\nready and this is important as well for\ncertain techniques of meditation that's\nwhy I do not do open awareness\ntechniques and meditation with traumatic\nindividuals their mind is working really\nreally hard to pack away those those\nmemories they've worked really really\nhard to like bury them in the basement\nand put locks and chains and and weights\non top so that the trap door can never\nopen and so when you get clinicians that\nforce people to process their trauma or\nyou get meditation techniques that let\nthe trauma come up then you actually\nre-traumatize the person trigger all of\nthose physiologic disruptions which\nresult in Neuroscience changes those\nNeuroscience changes will in turn affect\nyour behaviors your patterns of thought\nEtc so don't do that don't force people\nto talk about things"
