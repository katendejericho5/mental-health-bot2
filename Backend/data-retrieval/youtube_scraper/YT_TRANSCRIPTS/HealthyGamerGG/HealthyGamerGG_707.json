    "transcript": "but there's a really interesting feature\nof the brain when we are highly\nemotional our emotions hijack our logic\nso if you look at a political debate\nthese people are emotionally charged and\nthey are both convinced that they are\nlogically correct a hundred percent of\nthe time and the more emotionally\ncharged the debate becomes the more sure\nsomeone is that they are thinking\nlogical you may have engaged in\narguments with people where the person\nthat you're arguing with is really\nreally emotional and not thinking\nclearly but if you ask them their\nperception is that they are perfectly\nlogical and let's be fair if you're\narguing you're probably emotional and\nyou're probably thinking that I am 100\nright and they are 100 wrong so we have\nto understand this really key\nrelationship between emotions and\nAnalysis which is that the more\nemotional we are the more likely we are\nto actually hijack our analytical\ncircuitry and then the emotions are\nactually in control and they're pulling\nthe strings of our logic and we\nabsolutely see this in depression as\nwell"
