    "transcript": "I want to talk to you all today about\nwhy logic is not effective at treating\ndepression\n[Music]\nand this is a really important problem\nbecause a lot of people out there who\nstruggle with depression or even\nsubclinical depression where they don't\nnecessarily have a diagnosis will\nstruggle to pull themselves out of it\nthey'll analyze their situation and\nthey'll recognize okay I need to do this\nor I need to do this but they can't seem\nto despite all the logic bring\nthemselves out of it and on the flip\nside we also have something incredibly\nscary which is that sometimes when\npeople are really really depressed or\neven things like suicidal they're\nactually really logical about it they\nsort of reach the logical conclusion\nthat actually there's no reason for me\nto live right now right because I've\ndone the analysis I don't have a bright\nfuture generally speaking day to day I\nsuffer a lot I'm in a lot of pain the\nonly bright points in my life are like\nthese dopaminergic activities like\ngaming or porn or whatever but like\nthere's objectively no reason for me to\nbe alive right now and this is what's\nreally challenging is if you try to talk\nto these people you'll oftentimes find\nthat they their logic is actually really\nsound and even in the cases when it's\nnot really sound you can try to convince\nthem otherwise but it seems like you\nsometimes hit a brick wall and if you're\nstruggling in this way you may have\nnoticed that you may try to argue\nagainst yourself but your mind always\ncomes to the same conclusion so we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about first\nof all understanding what the\nrelationship between depression and\nlogic is and also why it is that logic\nsort of doesn't work and what the real\nproblem is with depression hey there\nthanks for watching and I'm glad these\nvideos have been helpful a lot of times\nI'll read the comments and see people\nasking well what do I actually do about\nit which is such a great question and\nunfortunately my experience has been\nthat the resources out there aren't\nactually that good at helping people\ncreate sustainable change which is why I\nstarted HG in the first place he coaches\nare trained on a curriculum that\nintegrates all of my understanding into\nwhat is motivation what paralyzes Us and\nhow to create lasting behavioral change\nso if you're ready to take the next step\nhe coaches are ready to build the life\nthat you want they've helped people\nbuild careers find relationships build\nnetworks of friends discover what their\npassions are and pursue their Hobbies so\nif this sounds like something that you'd\nbe interested in check out the link in\nthe description below and so what we're\ngoing to talk about today is the\nrelationship between logic depression\nand even IQ and what we'll sort of\ndiscover is actually a little bit\nbizarre first of all not only is it that\nlogic doesn't really work for depression\nbut the more intelligent you are or the\nmore logical you are there's a good\nchance that your depression will\nactually get worse not only does it not\nwork it's actually fuel for the fire so\nlet's start by understanding the\nrelationship between IQ and depression\nbecause we tend to think about IQ as a\npositive thing right and this is sort of\na situation where like generally\nspeaking the higher your IQ is the\neasier life becomes that's the way we\nsort of think about it is that it's\nunilaterally a positive thing but if we\nlook at studies on IQ and depression we\ndiscover something that's actually\nreally bizarre which is the higher your\neye IQ is the more likely you are to be\ndepressed so if you look at the general\npopulation about 9.5 percent of people\nare depressed there are some studies\nwhere researchers have looked at the top\ntwo percent of people in terms of IQ so\nthey took the smartest two percent of\npeople in the world and they assessed\nhow depressed they are and if you're in\nthe top two percent of people you're\nactually you have a 36.6 chance to be\ndepressed we're talking about a\nfour-fold increase in risk of depression\nand that's like absolutely insane right\nlike how on Earth does that work even\nthough these Studies have some\nmethodological problems there's a\nthere's some really interesting\nsupporting evidence on sort of\nunderstanding why is it that smarter\npeople are more likely to be depressed\nthere's a series of trials that really\nlook at something called Insight which\nis your awareness of what your problems\nare it's what they sort of discovered is\nthat if you have a debilitating\nneurological disease like let's say\nyou've got like ALS right which is Lou\nGehrig's Disease or um it's like a\ndegenerative nerve disorder if you've\ngot Parkinson's or something like that\nif you get diagnosed with something\nthat's like really bad like cancer the\nawareness that you have your ability to\nanalyze and accurately assess your\nsituation correlates with suicidality so\nthe greater your Insight is the more\naware you are the more suicidal you are\nthere are also situations where they've\nlooked at diseases like schizophrenia\nand they've also found that like when\nyou have people with schizophrenia the\nmore aware of the problem they are the\nmore damaging the situation actually is\nand the more suicidal they become so\nthat sounds kind of weird but like let's\nkind of dive into a little bit of like\nwhy is that why is it that IQ can worsen\ndepression and kind of like worsen\nsuicidality and things like that so\nlet's start by understanding first of\nall what do we mean by Logic we start\nwith a set of assumptions and then we\ntake those assumptions and then we can\nrun some kind of analysis and then we\ncome to a conclusion and generally\nspeaking the smarter you are the more\nlogical you will be the more analytical\nyou will be and the more faith you will\nhave in your analytic process because if\nyou're smart and you are very good at\nlogic it becomes a useful tool right so\nwe use logic to solve problems in life\nand if logic comes to a particular\nconclusion we trust that conclusion\nbecause it tends to work so if I'm\ntrying to figure out okay how do I get a\nbetter grade this is what I need to do I\ncan kind of logic it out and figure out\nwhat the right move is if I'm having\ntrouble at work I can run through an\nanalytical process and I can figure\nthings out and the higher your IQ is the\nmore likely you are to become dependent\non logic now let's take a look at\ndepression so there's a lot of really\ninteresting Neuroscience which helps us\nunderstand like what goes on in the\nbrain of someone who's depressed and as\nwe understand what happens in the brain\nof someone who's depressed we'll start\nto see how that can impact logic and\neven hijack it so the first thing to\nunderstand about depression is I sort of\nthink about it as the autoimmunity of\nmental illness so if we look at\nautoimmune conditions we have this thing\ncalled the immune system and the purpose\nof the immune system is to fight off\ninfections right these are the soldiers\nof our body in autoimmunity what happens\nis these soldiers start attacking us so\nif you look at things like allergies\nthis is a situation where there's a\nbenign particle which we're inhaling and\nour immune system is like this is the\nenemy let's attack it in other cases of\nautoimmunity we will actually attack our\nown tissues and cause things like rashes\nor inflammation or things like that so\nwhat happens in depression what happens\nin depression is our brain gets turned\nagainst us so this is what's really\nterrifying is the stronger our brain is\nthe worse the depression is because if\nyou have a really powerful logical\nfallacy but something in your brain has\nchanged to always blame you or look at\nthe negative or feel guilt or shame or\nwhatever it's going to leverage that\nbrain against you and this is why it's\nso hard to kick so how does the brain\nactually do that let's understand a\ncouple of things the first thing in\ndepression is we see that there is\namygdala hyper reactivity what does that\nmean so we have this part of our brain\nthat senses through rats and and sort of\ndetect negative things when the amygdala\nis hyper-reactive it does a couple of\ninteresting things it changes our\nperceptions so if there is a benign\nstimulus if someone says hey I'm busy\ntoday sorry I can't meet in the\ndepressed brain the amygdala being\nhyper-reactive will interpret that in a\nnegative way so it Alters our\nperceptions we become hypersensitive to\nnegativity so even if someone says Hey\nthank you so much for inviting me I\nloved the meal that you cooked it turns\nout though I wasn't able to enjoy the\nalcohol because I don't drink because of\nmy religious beliefs but I loved the\nappetizers the the fish was delicious\nyou have a lovely place I had such an\namazing time and so if you look at that\nthat sort of experience this is a\nstatement where someone is saying you\nknow five or six positive things and one\nnegative thing they're not really\nblaming you for it they're like hey I'm\nsorry I wasn't able to enjoy this thing\nI just don't drink and in the brain of a\ndepressed person that person will\nhighlight that one piece of information\nthere actually is a cognitive filter\nthat will knock out neg positive\ninformation and will actually amplify\nnegative information and this is all due\nto literally amygdal or hyperreactivity\nas signals are coming into our body and\nour brain our brain is literally\nignoring like 90 of them and just\nfocusing on the 10 most negative the\nsecond thing that we have to understand\nabout the brain and this comes a little\nbit more from Eastern psychology it's\nvalidated by Western studies but I think\nthe Eastern perspective is easier to\nunderstand is we have to understand the\nrelationship between emotions and\nAnalysis so oftentimes when we're\nfeeling emotional we will try to logic\nourselves out of it we'll try to analyze\nour way out of it but there's a really\ninteresting feature of the brain which\nis that when we are highly emotional\nour emotions hijack our logic so if you\nlook at a political debate these people\nare emotionally charged and they are\nboth convinced that they are logically\ncorrect a hundred percent of the time\nright and the more emotionally charged\nthe debate becomes the more sure someone\nis that they are thinking logical you\nmay have engaged in arguments with\npeople where the person that you're\narguing with is really really emotional\nand not thinking clearly but if you ask\nthem their perception is that they are\nperfectly logical and let's be fair if\nyou're arguing you're probably emotional\nand you're probably thinking that I am\n100 right and they are 100 wrong so we\nhave to understand this really key\nrelationship between emotions and\nAnalysis which is that the more\nemotional we are the more likely we are\nto actually hijack our analytical\ncircuitry and then the emotions are\nactually in control and they're pulling\nthe strings of our logic and we\nabsolutely see this in depression as\nwell now that we've understood a little\nbit about okay what's logic we're sort\nof taking a set of assumptions we have\nto start with axioms we're doing some\nkind of analysis and then we arrive at a\nconclusion great in depression we've got\nsomething that filters the information\nthat we get so it filters our inputs and\nthen it we also see in depression that\nour emotions can hijack our analytical\ncircuitry what does this result in so\nlet's take the take a look at someone\nwho has high IQ who is very logical and\nwhat that means for them if they end up\ndepressed so the first thing to\nunderstand is that if someone is has a\nhigh IQ there's a developmental\ncomponent which we've got to dive into\nso when I'm smart am I if I'm a kid and\nI'm smart I start to lean on logic more\nand more and more so what we sort of see\nis that kids who are smart and are quite\nlogical will use logic to solve their\nproblems it makes sense right so if I'm\nlogical and if I'm smart I'm going to\nuse my intellect to solve problems what\nthat means though is that we tend to\nhave underdeveloped faculty when it\ncomes to emotional awareness and\nemotional processing so if you look at\nkids who are very logical they will use\ntheir logic to overcome their emotions\nthey will sort of set their emotions\naside they will sort of like suppress\ntheir emotions and they'll approach\nthings in a very cold and logical manner\nthat's just how we work and the way that\nyou can sort of think about this is if I\ngrow up and I'm right-handed\nand then what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to like learn oh this is a Sharpie\nso I don't want that to fall off and I\nstart writing with my left hand what is\ngoing to happen to my capacity to use my\nleft hand the better I am at writing\nwith my right hand the worse I will get\nat writing with my left hand so this is\nexactly what happens in development is\nthat if we have something that we're\ngood at we lean on that a lot to the\nexclusion of other things now let's\ncompare that to a child who does not\nhave super high IQ so if they can't use\ntheir intellect to solve every problem\nwhat do they have to do instead when\nthey approach problems they have to use\nsome of these other things like EQ or\nemotional quotient they develop more\nemotional awareness they sort of work\nwith other tools right so if I've got an\nan S-Class IQ I'm going to just be\nowning things right and left with my\nS-Class IQ I'm not going to use my B\nlevel emotional circuitry and so over\ntime I don't even level that stuff up so\nthe first thing to understand is that\nkids who have a high IQ will sometimes\nin a weird way have a low EQ because\nthey just don't have that emotional\ndevelopment this may also explain for\nexample like if you're a smart person\nwho's very logically oriented like you\nmay notice that you have like some\ndeficits like there are some things in\nlife that seem really harder to you\nwhich you know people who are not as\nsmart as you are and they seem to have\nno trouble with it and you're like kind\nof confused like why if I'm so smart why\nis this so easy for other people and so\nhard for me and then you sort of result\nin some kind of conclusion which is that\nlike IQ can be a curse but if you ever\nsay that to people they're like law Cry\nMe a River like IQ is a curse oh my God\nyou're so smart you think you're so\nsmart ah LOL right so like no one ever\nactually listens to that but that's\nactually the case it's really bizarre\nbut it's actually the case the second\nthing which you all may have already\nfigured out is if we are using logic but\nour amygdala is shaping our perceptions\nwhat that means is the the assumptions\nthat I start with are flawed and this is\nthe core of the problem in people who\nare depressed and why logic doesn't work\nit's because the assumptions are\nincorrect so you can run that analysis\nas much as you want to but the\nassumptions are where the problem is\nbecause analysis and logic is completely\nseparate from the faculty of perception\nright this is actually one of the things\nthat I think is sort of missing in\nWestern science we don't really know how\nto like fix cognitive biases or\nperceptions we sort of focus on once we\nhave a particular belief how do we work\nwith that belief we're sort of focused\non logic but we're not focused on\nperception so the biggest challenge with\npeople who are depressed they're\nlogically correct but they're operating\nfrom the wrong assumptions and that's\nnot something you can you can't logic\nyourself out of your assumptions or it's\nvery difficult what you really have to\ndo is change your perception so if you\nstart getting new inputs it will start\nto change some of your logic and that's\nreally what needs to happen but this is\nthe key problem with like logic and\ndepression is that the information that\nyou're starting with is fundamentally\nflawed and biased so you can try to\nlogic your way as many ways as you want\nbut I if I give you a set of building\nblocks that is busted and can never\nbuild a house there's no Arrangement\nthat you can put together that will\nresult in a house the last thing to keep\nin mind is we sort of talked a little\nbit about how emotions hijack logic and\nthis is the real problem of sort of the\nautoimmunity of depression so once you\nreach a conclusion internally and\nemotionally that I am a bad person or I\nwill never be successful in life once\nyou lose faith in yourself once you feel\nshame or guilt or hopeless once that\nthat energy is there it will hijack your\nlogical circuitry if someone feels\nhopeless you can try to argue with them\nas much as you want to about hey here\nare the reasons you can live here's why\nyou should believe in yourself you can\ntry to reassure them you can try to\nconvince it doesn't work because this is\nwhere the logic is actually being\ncontrolled by the emotion and so what we\nreally need to do is unpack that emotion\nor disarm that emotion and then the\nlogic will actually like normalize by\nitself and you'll feel a lot better and\nthis is the real tragedy of people who\nare smart who struggle with depression\nis that their ability to digest that\nemotion is underdeveloped right because\nthey've been smart their whole life so\nthey never developed emotional awareness\nand in fact half the people that I talk\nto who struggle with depression who are\nvery smart if I ask them why are you\ndepressed they don't even mention an\nemotion they don't say I feel ashamed\nabout myself that's never what they say\nthey say the reason that I'm depressed\nis because of this this this this this\nthis this this is why my life is\nhopeless I can logic it out to you I can\nargue I can convince you this is truth\nit's not emotion it's actually the exact\nopposite this is objective it's not\nsubjective and why do these people\nbelieve that because their emotional\nawareness has been underdeveloped\nbecause they've relied on IQ their whole\nlife now if you've reached this point\nyou may be a little bit concerned does\nthis mean I am screwed right so does\nthis mean like you were telling me Dr K\nholy crap so 9.5 of the population is\ndepressed normally and I use logic a lot\nand my depression rate is 36.6 percent\nthat's scary\num also that like the more I understand\nabout life the more suicidal I will\nbecome that scary does that mean I'm\nscrewed and this is the beautiful thing\nactually absolutely not in my experience\nas a clinician has been awesome because\nwhen I work with patients who are smart\nor I help people in general who are\nsmart so far the the biggest problem is\nthat their intelligence or logic is\nbeing leveraged against them and amazing\nstuff can happen when your logic starts\nworking in the right direction instead\nof trying to feed your hopelessness\nwhich is what the logic does it's\namazing when you can really use it to\ntackle the hopelessness instead and so\nwhat are the steps to that so the first\nthing that we've got to do is understand\nthat this is primarily driven by emotion\nso when I work with these kinds of\npeople what I really focus on is\nbuilding emotional awareness and so the\nmore that we build emotional awareness\nthen we can start tackling the emotions\non their own so we don't have to logic\nour way out of them that's not really\ngoing to work we really have to do is\nlike validate and process those emotions\nso this involves three steps so this is\nlike awareness of emotions so do you\nfeel ashamed about yourself what do you\ndo with that feeling I don't know what\nto do with it I can't fix it right so I\nignore it and then I try to logic my way\nto success so that's the exact problem\nis you can't logic your way out of\nemotion it's not really the way that the\nbrain works it's just not how we're\nwired in fact emotions can Trump logic\nit's usually not the other way around so\nwhat we have to do is first of all\nrecognize the emotions that we're\nfeeling the second thing that we have to\ndo is oftentimes name them and really\nunderstand when we're feeling them and\nthe third third and fourth things that\nwe can try to do is tolerate them and\nprocess process them so this is where\nwhen that emotional energy comes up if\nwe can tolerate it without reacting to\nit it'll start to feed our logic a\nlittle bit less okay the next thing is\nthere's a beautiful thing is if we can\ndo emotional processing then as the\nemotional energy decreases the amount\nthat it hijacks our logic will decrease\nand if we're no longer hijacking our\nlogic then we can use logic to start\nhelping us but as long as logic is\nserving the master of hopelessness it's\nnot going to work so how do you do this\nthis is where we've got some community\nevents like we did this right in the\nfields event where we sort of helped you\nknow thousands of people in our\ncommunity build emotional awareness our\ncoaches are also kind of familiar with\nthat but this is really where if you're\nstruggling with depression I'd strongly\nrecommend that you see a therapist right\nso because therapists are trained in\nthis sort of emotional processing kind\nof stuff the second thing that we can\nreally do and this is a little bit\ntrickier is work on our perceptions so\nthis is where when we sort of look at\nlike meditation mindfulness and yoga we\nknow that these things are effective at\ntreating depression and one of the key\nthings that meditation mindfulness and\nyoga really do psychologically that we\ndon't really do a whole lot in our West\nin the west is learn to purify our\nperception so we have for example in Dr\nK's guide we've got a whole section on\nyou know how to purify your sensory\norgans so how can you better receive\ninformation how can you remove the\ncognitive biases that you have by sort\nof like removing the filters through\nwhich you get information we also have\nDr K's guide to depression which y'all\ncan check out where we dive into a lot\nof this kind of stuff but this is what\nthe short answer is if you want to\npurify your perception meditation I\nthink honestly is like one of the best\nways to do it and if y'all can sort of\nadd these two elements what I've seen is\na lot of progress so when I've worked\nwith people and I've worked with\nhundreds of people who are depressed\nhundreds of people who are very capable\nand depressed which is what makes it so\nconfusing right so these are people like\nbankers at Goldman Sachs or CEOs of\nstartups that are incredibly Intel and\nIncredibly capable and struggle with\nlike crippling depression and the reason\nis because they're missing some of these\nthings and if you sort of think about\nthat like how can meditation help so\nwhat we do with meditation is observe\nthe breath we're not judging it we're\nnot saying that breath is good or breath\nis bad right and sometimes I'll even do\na practice with with someone where I'll\ntell someone bring in a food that you\ndislike and try that food and put it in\nlike eat take a bite of the food and pay\nattention to where your dislike comes\nfrom and inevitably what happens when\npeople do this is that oh wow this is\nnot as bad as I thought so what we're\nreally doing in those moments is we're\nchanging the way that our brain\ninterprets stimuli and the second thing\nthat we do when we when I do therapy\nwith people right and y'all may have\nseen this on stream is we'll talk to\npeople who are hopeless and then we have\na good cry and after people have a good\ncry they feel better their mind is\ncalmer their logic starts to move a\nlittle bit better that is emotional\nprocessing so the other thing that you\ncan kind of do is by all means like you\nknow use everything that we have\navailable go see a therapist but the\nother thing you can do is like just like\nprocess those emotions like try\njournaling or just have a good cry talk\nto someone about you know hey like I'm\nreally struggling right now and I really\nfeel extra ashamed and this is the other\nproblem is that the more intelligent you\nare and the more capable you are the\nworse you feel about yourself for not\nbeing able to fix the problem and that's\nthe real tragedy right if you've got a\nhigh IQ and if you're very analytical\nyou've used this to fix so many things\nand this is the one thing that you can't\nfix and you should be able to fix it and\nif you should be able to fix it what\ndoes that mean that means that you feel\nshame because you should be able to do\nsomething and you're not able to do it\nwhich in turn makes you stupid right\nmakes you worthless makes you pathetic\nand this is an example of how if you\nkind of think about it but hold on a sec\nwhat's going on here we start with\ndepression I should be able to fix it\nI'm I'm not able to fix it therefore I'm\nashamed therefore I'm worthless what\ndoes that do it feeds the emotion so\nwe've got to break that cycle by\nrecognizing okay hold on a second I feel\nashamed of myself in the first place how\ncan I sit with that how can I tolerate\nit and how can I process it so when it\ncomes to logic and depression it's a\nreally common problem because people who\nare very logical and very intelligent\nhave actually used their logic and IQ to\nsolve problems the challenge is that\nwhen it comes to depression this is a\nsituation where we are turning our\npowerful logical ability and the\ndepression actually turns it against us\nso it's not just that it doesn't help us\nso that it's ineffective it's that\nactually logic and IQ can make\ndepression worse in their scientific\ndata that supports that and so then the\nquestion becomes okay then what do we do\nabout it and this is where we have to\ndevelop our emotional awareness a little\nbit develop our emotional processing and\nalso remove that cognitive filter and as\nyou're able to do these two things your\nexperience of feeling sad or some of\nthis logic will actually start to get\nway better"
