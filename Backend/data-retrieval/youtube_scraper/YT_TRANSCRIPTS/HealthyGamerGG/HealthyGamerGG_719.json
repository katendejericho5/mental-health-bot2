    "transcript": "so if someone comes to you and says hey\nyou're screwing up at work and then you\nsay okay what in what way what should I\ndo about it like that kind of criticism\nisn't actually helpful unless it's\nconstructive and what does constructive\nmean that means that when someone comes\nto you and points out something that\nyou're doing wrong like they also point\nout like some kind of corrective action\nnow in some way this is unfair on the\nkid because the whole point of the\nparent-child relationship is that the\nchild should not be responsible for\nparenting the parent and telling them\nhow to do better right that's actually\nthe parents responsibility and the truth\nof the matter is that's just unfair to\ny'all but this is unfortunately what it\nsort of means to have a parent-child\nrelationship is that on on some level\nyou're going to have to accept some\nresponsibility for guiding them and\nsharing with them what you're looking\nfor"
