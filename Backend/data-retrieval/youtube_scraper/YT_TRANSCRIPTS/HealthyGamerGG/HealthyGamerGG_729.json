    "transcript": "so when you succeed the mind of someone\nwith imposter syndrome is going to\ndefault to thinking about what other\npeople think so when I get an A on a\ntest I'm not happy until my parents say\ngood job kid you're so smart when I do a\ngood job at work what I really care\nabout I can't relax or feel competent or\nfeel proud until my boss says good job\nand once I've made my boss happy I have\nmaintained the scam this is another day\nthat's gone by at work where they\nhaven't figured out I'm incompetent and\nmy boss still thinks that I'm a good\nperson so we really care what other\npeople think and we're not able to take\npride in our own accomplishments the\nidea that I can be proud of something\nand someone else may be disappointed in\nit is completely foreign to someone with\nimposter syndrome that just does not\ncompute at all there's no way I can be\nproud of something and someone else be\ndisappointed in something"
