GG\nstream just a reminder that although I'm\na psychiatrist nothing we discussed on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if yall have a uh concern or\nquestion that is Medical in nature\nplease go see a license professional\num\nokay so today we've got a couple of cool\nannouncements we are going to be talking\nto the one the only the amazing\nsapnap um and I hope I'm pronouncing\nthat name correctly but that's going to\nbe great we're going to hop into an\ninterview and just learn a little bit\nabout what his life is like so that'll\nbe great uh before we jump into that\nthough we have a couple of quick\nannouncements um the first\nis we have so a lot of people have been\nasking us for research citations so we\ndo extensively research basically every\nvideo that we make um lots and lots of\nresearch goes into every video or well\nthe ones that are not like spirituality\noriented uh so we've sort of changed a\nlittle bit about the way that we do this\nbecause often times you know when we\nmake multiple videos let's say on\nanxiety like there some of the current\nvideos are based on information from the\npast and previous uh uh\nprevious articles so what we're trying\nto do and we also sort of ask people\nlike okay why do youall want citations\nand it's usually to learn more so we've\ncreated a citations page that is topic\nfocused so we hopefully at some point\nwe'll like have a bibliography for every\nvideo that we make we have them\ninternally there's just a publishing\nprocess issue but for those of youall\nthat are interested in learning more\nabout the research that is kind of the\nfoundational research that we use to\nmake our videos um this is the first\nversion of The Works sited page so\nthere's just a lot of really really good\nstuff in here um let me see if I can\nshow like so for example\nthis is like one of the five best papers\nthat I've like ever read in my career so\nthis is sort of the foundational\nresearch that we tend to use and then\nthis this website will be updated\nregularly over time so I know people\nhave been interested in that so we've\ngot that up for yall um another thing\nthat we're going to be talking about\nreal quick\nuh is let me show you all this real\nquick\num so we also have uh topic voting is\ngoing on for uh members in June so for\nthose of youall that don't know we um\nwill sometimes do uh we started doing\nmemberships about five months ago and\nthe purpose of memberships is to offer\num more in-depth content that is\ndetermined by the community so this is\nlike pretty cool but basically what we\ndo is y'all decide what the lectures are\ngoing to be so um it looks like for next\nmonth we're going to do two in-depth\nlectures one is going to be on emotions\nis going to be 2011 relationships and\nattachment Styles and deep dive into\nlearning so basically like every month\nwe vote on or y'all vote on what we are\ngoing to be talking about that month and\nwhat I do is spend about six to eight\nhours to prepare a one-hour lecture so\nif we're doing deep dive into learning\nthat's funny because I was working on\nthat earlier today we're going to sort\nof really dig into both like yogic\nConcepts I already know what we're going\nto talk about I'm just hearing about\nthis but so there's one yogic Tech\ntechnique in which someone claimed to\nhave learned 16 languages over two years\nby sort of transforming their mind into\na particular State um so we'll explore\nlike some of that kind of stuff as well\nas like the Neuroscience of learning and\nhow to like improve your learning so\nthis is basically like stuff that is\npicked by the community um one thing\nabout some of these lectures is that\nsome of them will require like previous\nwork so one of the the key things so if\nwe're doing an emotions 2011 lecture for\nexample this presumes that everyone has\nwatched emotions 101 which we did a\ncouple months ago so if yall are joining\nlate everything that you've missed is\navailable for you to watch um so no\nbiggie there but part of the reason that\nwe do this is we want people to be able\nto explore like more advanced topics but\nthat means that you can't be a rando\nfrom the internet right you have to like\nsort of spend some time and really learn\nthe basics and then we get to the more\nadvaned stuff which is a lot of fun um I\nthink people have enjoyed it a lot we\nalso recognize that for a lot of people\nuh you know we do a lot of free stuff\nhere at HG and some stuff has uh a price\nassociated with it we recognize that\nthat is difficult for some people so\njust a quick reminder that we also have\nresource packs so these are more\nin-depth um explorations of a particular\ntopic that have a set of videos uh some\ndegree of like insights or like written\nmaterials as well as like some exercises\nto work on this is one of our most\npopular features here at HG this is\nabsolutely free and it goes in- depth on\nvarious stuff um the other thing is that\nyou know at this point we have over a\nthousand videos on our YouTube channel\nwe've streamed for thousands and\nthousands of hours on Twitch so at this\npoint like you know it's hard to get\nthrough everything so if y'all are\ninterested in like hey I want to learn\nabout like motivation so what the team\nhas done has gone through and curated\nour best videos on this and this is\nabsolutely free okay all right in\nwaiting let's hop in with\nsapnap all right\noh\num okay I am gonna do this and then\nI'mma do this and then I'mma do this\nhello oh testing one two\nthree can you hear me now yeah I can\nhear you great um I'm going to cool\nsorry I had to change my my uh mic was\nnot set correctly that's okay let me go\nahead\nand fix this real quick because I don't\nknow why this always happens I actually\ncan't hear you now hold on oh\nGG okay

isn't it like how we can sort\nof get this right like 10 days in a row\nand the 11th day it's busted I know\nevery time I day and then now it doesn't\nwork but actually I might have found the\nreason\nwhy let me unplug this plug this back\nin we'll get there\nhopefully um let me see this oh oh\nno let's do this let's do this and then\nlet's do this so that we can see\nokay okay this is just frustrating me\nnow we can talk about\nfrustration on let me try this other\ncamera let me try this side\ncamera CU I have two cameras see if this\none will work oh someone has two cameras\nOh my God okay this one works this one\nworks whatever we just use this one\nthere we go I don't know why it doesn't\nwant to work but whatever welcome dude\nhow are you doing good how are you good\nwhat do you go by uh sapnap or Nick call\nme whatever you want what do you\nprefer um let's just do sapnap I guess I\nprer sapnap saap it is yeah and the\nfirst of all sapnap thank you so much\nfor coming on today MH um you know we\ntend to have we talk to people just\nabout whatever yeah for about an hour or\ntwo I'm down to talk about whatever for\nan hour or two um sometimes people have\nparticular like questions or areas of\ninterest in the realm of psychology\nNeuroscience mental health or\nspirituality um but sometimes we just\nVibe and like it's all\ngood okay I'm kind of down to Vibe I\nguess I don't I don't I I'm honestly\ndown for whatever literally whatever can\nyou just tell us like so what we try to\ndo here is just have conversations with\npeople about their experience of life\nokay and um can you tell us just a\nlittle bit about\nyourself sure um gosh I guess I a little\nbit about myself I'll talk about my\nlikes I am a really big I kind of like\neverything I'm one of those people that\njust kind of likes everything that makes\nsense like I feel like I have a lot of\nlikes like I like like I like computers\nI'm into video games but I also like\nsports and stuff I guess I'd maybe not\nlike everything I feel like I'm like a\ntypical guy I guess I don't know I like\nsports I like video games uh God I like\nI like anime as well I have like anime\nposters in the background um I like\nPokemon I don't know I just like I kind\nof like the typical kind of what\neveryone else likes I don't know that's\ncool man so you're one of us yeah yeah\none of us any favorite\nanimes uh yeah honestly I think my\nfavorite anime all time is Hunter Hunter\nokay um but recently I've been really\nHunter x Hunter yeah Hunter x Hunter and\nthen but recently I've been also really\ngetting into like Jiu-Jitsu kaisen\nbecause like I have like a I have a\ncarpet with one of like the characters\non it um I don't know why it's just been\ngetting me because I think it's really\ngood what is Jiu-Jitsu kaisen about um\nessentially it's about\nthese people and uh there's curses in\nthe world like like people like humans\nemotions manifest into like like these\nactual things called curses that are\nlike bad and like kill people and stuff\nlike that and then essentially it's\ntheir job to fight the curses to help\ncurses are born of human emotion yeah\nyeah exactly they're born from human\nemotions like let's say someone has like\nthis like hatred like someone's getting\nI don't know it's like a dumb example\nbut someone's getting bullied in school\nand then like oh I really hate this\nbully and then like a curse is uh has\ncome from it interesting it sounds like\nI definitely got to watch that cuz that\nseems to be like an allegory of The\nHuman Experience exactly you should\nwatch it that'd be great I was talking\nto someone recently there a kind of\nrandom conversation who was telling me\nthat they like really believe and this\nis quite a knowledgeable person who I\nrespect a lot but I was stunned when\nthey said that they actually like\nbelieve that there are things like evil\nspirits out there that will latch on to\nlike negative human emotion yeah and\nthat's kind of it's kind of interesting\nbecause like I I feel like I'm a person\nthat doesn't believe in kind of like\nnegative Spirits or Spirits in general\nor ghosts or whatever but I you'll never\ncatch me like playing with like like a\nlike a Ouija board or something like\nthat it's like I will never like I'm\njust I'm just fine not knowing if that\nmakes sense like I'm like okay that's\nfine like I I don't need to I don't need\nto go and like piss off some evil spirit\nif there is one I see so it's kind of\nlike you don't believe in it but also\nlike you don't mess around with it yeah\nI'm not trying to find out you know what\nI mean I've seen too many too many\nparanormal activity too many spooky\nscary like\nuh like movies or shows that it just\nnever works out if if they are they are\nthere and they're pissed off it never\nworks out for the person that's messing\naround with them so might as well just\nplay it safe right exactly even though\nyou're mind is like yeah it's not a real\nthing but yeah I maybe if there was some\nlike benefit like if like for example\nlike if I was doing like a a YouTube\nvideo where I go ghost hunting I'm like\nokay well there's like some like like\nthere's some benefit behind this yeah\nmaybe I'll do it but like I'm not GNA\nI'm not going to do it just for funsies\nyeah makes a lot of sense man uh what\nabout video games what are you what are\nyou playing nowadays so you stream\nMinecraft mostly still or honestly I\ndon't even really stream Minecraft\nmostly I I kind of it's like two\nseparate things like YouTube I just only\nupload Minecraft but then I stream kind\nof whatever um honestly I've been kind\nof it's been kind of hard finding games\nthat are really enjoyable because I feel\nlike I just stream a lot so I just run\nthrough like all the games um like I've\nplayed a ton of valorant a ton of like\nleague in my life but recently I've been\nkind of just playing like random games\nand that's like been the most fun like\nwhat like like I've been playing The\nForest recently oh yeah I've heard of\nthat what that it's like a survival game\nyeah it's like you just like crash like\nfor some reason you get abandoned on\nthis island and there's cannibals on the\nisland and you just got to survive and\nthere's also like an underlying story\nthat you can complete while playing the\ngame it's pretty fun um essentially like\nit boils down to like eventually you get\nto a point where you're just like\nrunning around like trying to complete\nthe story and just like fighting\ncannibals essentially interesting and so\nso on YouTube you make mostly an upload\nMinecraft so seems like those are\nseparate in your life yeah I mean I view\nthem I view them very separately I view\nthem as like two different like entities\nalmost like YouTube is like YouTube is\nlike more professional kind of thought\nout YouTube videos like plan structured\nwell edited etc etc where as when I go\nlive I kind of just go live and I don't\neven I used to have a plan I don't do\nthat as much anymore when I used to\nstream I used to have a plan uh that was\nkind of we used to have like a a group\nof friends and we we'd have a plan and\nwe like stream together but now I kind\nof go live like randomly I was like all\nright I'm going live and I don't really\nhave a plan I just figur it out as I go\nmakes sense so it sounds sound like\ncognitively it's very different like one\nis sort of like a a crafted thing and\nanother one is like more spontaneous\nyeah exactly um yeah I just go live and\nI was kind like what do we want to play\ntoday I was play today guys I just like\ntalk to my chat I'm like what do you\nwhat do we what do we want to play what\ndo we want to talk about and then we\njust do it and in terms of Minecraft how\ndo you decide what to\nmake um the way I decide like what to\nmake content wise is like I just have my\nmy two friends I live with uh dream and\nGeorge and we just kind of make content\nplans like we'll we'll talk about like\nlike we we'll make content strategy and\nwe'll talk like ideas and we'll\nformulate ideas with each other um and\nthen once we have like we'll usually\nkind of have like a I'm doing this video\nyou're doing that video and you're doing\nthat video and we just kind of help each\nother do those videos in interesting so\nit seems very like collaborative yeah\nit's very collaborative very\ncollaborative like team team effort do\nyou have a sense of which videos are\nlike bangers when you even from\ninception or is it kind of like RNG no\nthere's some that are bangers from\ninception like you'll know like there's\ncertain videos\nlike like uh I think my color blind\nvideo that I uploaded I knew that was\ngoing to do good I just knew that one\nwas going to do good I also did like a a\nfood video where I I I tried all the\nMinecraft food in real life I also knew\nthat was going to be good there is some\nthat you just know if they're produced\nwell that they will turn out good\nbecause they're just a good idea that\nreally fit your channel that really fits\na niche that's really going to do like\nlike you can just look at like the state\nof YouTube and like it feels like it's\ngoing to do very well but obviously you\ncan't be wrong that's happened as well\nwhere I thought something was going to\nbe a banger\nand it and it wasn't and I've also had\nvideos where I didn't think it was going\nto be a banger and then it was a banger\nlike I think my most obvious video that\nis like I did Minecraft but every mob's\na pig and I remember like originally I\ndidn't even want to do it I was like\nthis is stupid I was this is a dumb\nvideo and then like my friends were like\nno no trust me like it's going to do\ngood it's going to do good and then it\ndid really well but I didn't think it\nwas going to do you have a sense of when\nyou say you just know where that knowing\ncomes\nfrom um how do you just know I mean I\ndon't I don't how to explain it I feel\nlike it's just like I think YouTube's a\nskill and like when you're around like a\nbunch of really good YouTubers it's just\nlike kind of like a skill that rubs off\non you like I mean I've been around like\nMr Beast and dream and like a bunch of\nhuge YouTubers and like you just ask\nthem like I try and ask questions like\nwhy is this why do you do this why do\nyou do that and then you know there if\nyou just ask questions like I I think\nand you're just around people that are\nlike successful and are doing good and\nare are like smart about what they do\nthat it'll kind of like rub off on you\nI'm not very good at articulating why I\nknow something will do good but I I feel\nlike I'm good at being like yeah I think\nthis will do good or I don't think this\nwill do good very few people are good at\narticulating why they're good at what\nthey're what they do yeah of itself is I\nthink a skill I mean there there's\ncertain things that you can articulate\nlike you think oh I think the title is\ngood for example I think I beat I eat I\nate I atat all the Minecraft food in\nreal life I think it's a good title and\nI think you can put a really good\nthumbnail on there and I guess I think\nthe actual video If edited well is\ninteresting so I guess that's why I\nthought that video would do good so it's\nlike interesting and requires a good\nkind of title requires a good thumbnail\nuh and it fits my channel very well um\nanything in particular you want to talk\nabout\ntoday no I mean I'm kind of down to talk\nabout whatever I we can talk about\nmyself we can talk I don't know whatever\ncool I mean I can ask you a couple more\nquestions um for sure like i' I'd love\nto learn a little bit about kind of who\nyou are where you grew up how you got\ninto what you're doing today okay yeah\nI'm down for that um I was just born in\nTexas Houston Texas I don't know I was\nlike some normal normal little kid um I\nreally liked like video games and stuff\nso I just started playing video games at\na really young age and that's where\nactually where I met like my friends\nthat I do YouTube with now just online\non like a Minecraft server I just met\nthem like we just became friends we're\nall playing games together and then as a\ntypical dude that plays video games I\ndecided to go into computer science uh\nfor a college I was going to become a\nsoftware developer and\nthen like YouTube was like we're kind of\ndoing YouTube on the and I wasn't really\ndoing it as much as the other two\nbecause I had a job and school at the\nsame time and then I got like I mean for\nme I I I think it was like like lucky\nthat actually that the pandemic happened\nand I was for I had like you know I had\nlost my job which at the time I was like\n[ __ ] I was like I just lost my job like\nlike it wasn't like like I wasn't like\nlost my job lost my job but it was like\noh hey we can't give you as much hours\nlike you come in like once a week or\nsomething like that um and then School\nbecame online so then I just had like\ninfinite time to just hang out with my\nfriends and make YouTube videos and then\nwe started doing that and then it just\nreally popped off and then it got to a\ncertain point where I thought okay it's\nworth it's worth uh taking a break on\nschool which I had to really convince my\nmy parents that that was fun what did\nthat conversation look like I mean at\nfirst it was uh you should you should\njust do both you should do both and\neventually just it just gets to a point\nwhere I was like look I mean I can very\neasily financially support myself so why\nnot like uh you know you just kind of\nexplain it to him that this could be\nvery like it's just like I was like well\nif I don't do this now I probably won't\nget another opportunity to do this ever\nagain so it's just we I was already\nahead in school cuz like my parents were\nsuper like especially like my dad was\nsuper like you have to you have to get\ngrades you have to do this you have to\nyou know kind of like\ntypical strict parent whatever so I was\nalready like kind of ahead like I was\nlike a year or something ahead in\ncollege so I just like used logic I was\nlike well I'm already a year ahead so\nworst case scenario I'm only going to be\nlike where you're supposed to be at this\nthis point in time yeah that's kind\nthat's kind of how I did that along with\nproving that it was financially I could\nsupport myself so so it sounds like you\nreally had a good argument to convince\nyour parents yeah I mean I mean it it\nwasn't like too hard because like it\nlike we were like successful you know\nlike I didn't try and stop going to\ncollege before I was successful because\nI thought that because to me I didn't\nsee the point I was like well if I'm not\nlike doing good enough where I can live\non my own and this and that then it\nmight not it could potentially not be\nworth it to drop out of school so I\nwaited into a point that I was like okay\nit obviously clearly makes sense and\nthen got it if it just obviously clear\nclearly makes sense in my mind then I\njust it's easier to explain it to my\nparents well I mean it sounds like you\nwere not like oh I'm I'mma Chase my\npassions and I'mma make something of\nmyself it sounds like you were\nvery\num like I'm I'm getting the sense that\nyour parents could tell that you were\nsuper thoughtful about it right so like\nyou had almost like convinced yourself\nthat this was the right move at this\npoint and you waited to do that I guess\nthat is what happened I waited to a\npoint where I convinced myself that it\nwas the right point and then at that\npoint in time it wasn't too hard to\nconvince my parents because I'd already\ngone through the steps of convincing\nmyself so I just used those same steps\nto convince them it seems like you were\nquite mature with how you did it uh yeah\nbut I think that's just because like my\nparents like like I said like my dad's\nlike my dad's like uh from Greece and\nstuff so like when he came here he's\nsuper like super Greek dad like you have\nto like so like they really instilled\nlike these like things in me that's like\nI have to be able to take care of myself\nI have to do this I have to you know\nlike typical I feel like it's pretty\ntypical for people that have parents\nthat aren't from the US that they're\nsuper uh you know like they want you to\nbe able to take care of yourself so\nbecause of that I just knew I was like\nwell I I kind of thought it like try and\nthink it through can can you say a\nlittle bit more about that you said\ntypical Greek Greek dad I I don't I\ndon't know what okay um I just think I\nmean I don't even know if it's typical\nGreek Dad I think it's typical dad\nthat's not immigrant immigrant father\nthat's where or immigrant parents in\ngeneral so I I just heard it a lot that\npeople people with immigrant parents\njust like they're they are super like\nkind of they really want you to be able\nto take care of yourself mhm and then\nthat's just what I've heard and I've\nseen it with my dad so I just feel like\nthat's like a typical Trope is that the\nword I don't know it's a typical like\ntypical thing that happens when you have\nparents that are immigrants yeah when I\nso my parents are also immigrants and\nand when I was 9 years old my dad was\nlike one of you is going to I have a\nbrother so he's like one of you is going\nto be a doctor and one of you is going\nto be a\nlawyer well like I was like all right\nyeah you're all right well I guess I'll\ndo it yeah my my that wasn't like like\nhe didn't I don't know if he cared what\nI was I mean he wanted obviously he\nwanted like some job that was like\nsomewhat prestigious like he didn't want\nme to I don't know obviously he did like\nthe typical thing like whenever I would\nwork at like at my job like I remember\nhe made me get a job right when I turned\nlike 16 or whatever well partially\nbecause I wanted a car and he's like\nwell if you want a car go get a job like\nit was kind of like that um um and then\nwhen I had the job I would to complain\nto him I like this sucks like I remember\nI worked like as a buser at some\nrestaurant I was like this sucks I have\nto work 12 hours a day and I make like\nwhatever I was making I think I was\nmaking like $4 an hour because I got\ntips as well I like this sucks I don't\nlike this yeah you don't like it well\nyou better go to school he's like you\ndon't have to do this that that was kind\nof like his argument like yeah see he's\nlike I made you get a job so You'\nrealize how much you don't like working\nthis job so that you can um you know\nmotivate yourself to go to school and\nget a better job makes a lot of sense I\nI had a patient once who his dad told\nhim that there are two ways to make\nmoney in this world you can use your\nbody or you can use your\nmind and that's not and his dad was like\nI've used my body and trust me you don't\nwant to do that yeah I mean like\nphysical labor it sucks like I mean I I\nI mean I've worked a few jobs you know\nwhenever I was younger like I mean\nnothing super labor intensive just like\na buser just I mean stuff where you're\njust standing on your feet all day and I\ncan I can I can I can attest like it's\nnot it's not fun like it's not fun but I\nthink funny enough I don't even know if\nnecessarily I think I don't even know if\ncollege is like the the the the exact\npath that everyone has to do anymore I\nmean I think it is for like certain\ncareer paths like if you want to become\nlike a doctor or a lawyer or something\nobviously you have to go to college but\nlike if you want to do something else I\nthink there's a lot of jobs that don't\nrequire you to go to college funny\nenough I mean I know a lot of people who\nwho understand a lot about medicine from\nReading Facebook posts yeah they're\nthey're like oh yeah like I I did my own\nresearch and I just spent some time on\nFacebook and and now I you know so like\nthey have to like for those jobs like\neven if like well actually I don't know\nfor a lawyer do you just have to pass\nthe bar like you don't have to have a\ndegree if you pass the bar you can act\nas a lawyer it's specific I think so so\nI I think you can go like I think the\nstate of California for example I think\nyou can practice I I mean don't quote me\nI'm I'm not a lawyer but um I I think\nyou can go to a non- accredited school\nto get a law degree M and then pass the\nbar and then you can just practice but I\nI think in in other parts maybe to pass\nthe bar you have to have a degree but\nmaybe not I don't know because you can\nalso represent yourself without a degree\nso who knows because that's it's kind of\ninteresting because like obviously like\nI think to be a doctor and practice\nmedicine you obviously have to like a\ncertain degree because we don't want you\nknow we don't want people just like\ngoing around running around as doctors\nand killing people yeah but I think\nthere's like I think there is like a lot\nof jobs that you don't need a degree and\nthat you can become super successful and\nwithout a degree and and like what I\nthink I don't know I don't know exactly\nI just I just feel like there is like I\nmean I'm successful in my job and I\ndon't have a degree and I think there's\na lot of skill in it and I think there's\nI think people could learn how to make\nlike good content and upload it to\nYouTube and I think it's a very\nlearnable skill I mean I think there is\nluck involved in it as well obviously\nbut I think there's luck involved with\neverything anything so I think for\nexample like YouTube is a job that like\nyou don't need a degree for but you can\nlearn it and I think there's like\nthere's similar jobs like that I'd\nimagine I mean I could couldn't tell you\noff the top of my head but yeah no I I\nthink it makes a lot of sense and and\nlike you said I think you know you kind\nof mentioned that you've been quite\nsuccessful I don't think it's I think\npeople in the content creation space\nthere isn't formal education for the\nmost part right so it's it's stuff that\npeople have to learn and it's very clear\nthat there are people who are better at\nit than others yeah 100% And and so I I\nthink we're also seeing um I was just\nkind of curious if you had particular\nideas but I think one thing that I'm\nseeing a lot of is like degree inflation\nmhm so it used to be that like in order\nto get a job as a teacher you actually\ndidn't need any degree then you needed a\nbachelor's degree now a lot of people\nwant master's degrees so like you have\nto go to school for longer to get like\nthe same job my favorite is you need\nthree to five years of experience for an\nentry-level position somewhere nowadays\nyeah I've seen that right and and I\nthink that we're also seeing I think for\nexample a lot of of um like major\ncompanies like Google I think at this\npoint no longer requires a college\ndegree even to be a developer so you\nhave these like uh boot camp oriented\nthings mhm developer is actually a great\nexample I actually I actually used that\nin an argument with someone that I was\ntalking about like uh for why you don't\nneed to like why you don't always have\nto go to college and why it's not\nexactly like a like the the set path\nthat it was anymore because I I I have\nheard of developers obviously I never\nactually became a full-on software\nengineer because I dropped out but I\nhave friends that are full-on developers\nand and and and they have applied to\njobs and they've lost job applications\nto someone that didn't have a degree\nthat just like sat in their basement\ncoding and learning and just got really\ngood at coding just from practicing it\nand they're just like god tier\ndevelopers now and like they didn't even\ngo to school so that's actually like one\nof that's an example of like a pretty\nprestigious job that you can just teach\nyourself and I think especially now with\nlike like Ai and stuff like it's so much\neasier to teach yourself as well like\nyou can literally just add like you can\nfunny enough you can actually code with\njust like like a lot of like uh software\nlike uh programs like like um I was I\nwas opening one and I was like just like\nmessing around just for fun and my\nfriend was showing me and you can just\nliterally it you can just tell it what\nto code and it'll code it for you and\nobviously if you have some baseline\nlevel of like like coding you can like\nfix it is like it's like errors and\nstuff like that so it's really cool it's\nlike I think it's really cool and I\nthink that's like example how like\nthere's like a lot more resources that\ncan help you learn things that you would\nhave learned could have previously only\nlearned in college interesting yeah that\nis cool and and it sounded like you were\narguing with someone who believed the\nopposite or what yeah they believed\nthat you should go that like they they\nbelieve that like go into like\na why my okay it was it was kind of a\nniche argument like I was arguing that\ngoing to like a a mid-tier college to me\nseemed kind of pointless like going to\nlike an average college like an average\nbig university seem kind of pointless\ncuz I thought it was super expensive and\nyour degree is equal to the degree of a\nless expensive college versus I thought\nif you go to Harvard obviously it's\ndifferent because you have a Harvard\ndegree and that gets you connections etc\netc you're prestigious whatever that\nwill push you farther in life I thought\ngoing to an uh like a mid mid-tier\nCollege I see like was pointless unless\nyou just want like the quote unquote\ncollege experience or whatever because\nyou're just paying more for the same\ndegree that no one's going to care if\nyour degrees from\nmid- tier college versus lower tier\nCollege like they just don't care in my\nopinion yeah that that was my that was\nmy arum but they were saying oh there's\nlike all these good resources and this\nand that and the other and I didn't know\nif that was necessarily true I thought\nit was true to some degree but I didn't\nthink it was worth like the dollar\namount yeah I think it's I think it's\ngetting crazy with just how expensive\ncollege is so the value of things is\nvery very very confusing now yeah um\nthat's why my parents made me go to\nCommunity College\nyeah money good value right yeah it was\na good value it like you pay like $1,000\na semester instead of like 10,000 it's\ngreat yeah I went to um like a state\nuniversity for undergrad and uh it was\nvery like very cheap I think it was it\nwas more expensive than $1,000 but I\nthink my tuition was like between three\nand five grand a semester yeah the T\nlike the tuition was like less expensive\nthan just buying the books to be honest\nfrom what I remember a whole different\nscam bro yeah the books yeah the books\nis\nridiculous and so how did you get into\nYouTube um I I kind of asked you this\nalready so it's sound like you were\nmaking videos but then like what changed\nwell what changed was my my friend my\nfriend my friend dream honestly like we\nI he just came to me one day I remember\nit was really random like I was like the\nsummer before I started college actually\nI I was just talking to him and he just\ngoes like it's actually kind of\nridiculous he goes randomly goes I'm\ngoing to become a YouTuber and I was\nlike what like what what is this guy\ntalking about he's going be become a\nYouTuber obviously at that time I didn't\nknow anything about YouTube I just\nthought it's like you get kind of Lucky\nand you upload videos and people just\nlike randomly like it and he's like no\nI'm going to become a YouTuber I was\nlike why and then he's like he explained\nto me that he had been like studying the\nalgorithm for months and he's been\nputting in research and he saved aside\nsome money and he was just going to give\ngive a crack on it like swing like take\na crack on it and he just truly believed\nthat he was going to become a YouTuber I\nwas like okay if you become a YouTuber I\nI'll become a YouTuber with you let's do\nit and then he just started doing it and\nthen like I before like they like he\nstarted doing it and and it was like\nkind of me him and me him and George we\nall started kind of doing it and\nobviously I was doing it less at the\ntime because I had like college in\nschool but then because of the P\npandemic I was able to focus on it more\nbut that's kind of how I started doing\nit my friend dream started doing it I\nwas like all right well I'll do it with\nyou it sounds fun like why not what's\nthe downside sounds fun obviously like\nwhen you're younger you like everyone\nlike I feel like as like a as like a a\nguy it's\nlike you either want to become a famous\nbasketball player or like some famous\nsport player and then you realize for\nmost guys I don't have I'm not I'm not\ntall enough so I can't become a famous\nsports player so I like video games so\ntherefore I'll become a software like\ndeveloper but like secretly everyone\nwants to kind of become a YouTuber seems\nkind of fun yeah it's so interesting how\nlogical it is right it seems like quite\nopen-ended in the sense that oh you can\ndo anything that you want in life but a\nlot of people are like yeah I want to do\nthis this or that\nyeah yeah I\nmean like yeah I mean obviously I think\nfor me like I feel like I'm a logical\nperson so like I obviously wanted to\nbecome like a basketball player right\nand then I like really liked basketball\nI played a lot of basketball I played on\nteams this and then the other but at\nsome point I was like I think it was in\nhigh school I was like I'm like going to\nend up being 5'8 I just can't become a\nbasketball player it was like I mean\nlike I guess I could but like it just\nseems really unlikely given that\neveryone else is like seven foot and\nthey're just going to block every shot\nthat I ever shoot so\nwhat what do you mean I'm a logical\nperson what does that\nmean um I think I'm a logical person\nbecause I just think things out and I\njust like to I like to take the path of\nleast resistance a lot of the time okay\nlike I'll be like for example like\nbasketball I guess I could have just\ntrained and trained and trained and\ntried to become the first ever 58\nbasketball player uh but I was like ah\nit seems kind of unlikely I guess I'll\njust like pivot like cuz I just I mean\nlike I understood that like genetics\nplay like a giant part in becoming a\nprofessional athlete because even like\ncoaches like I remember like coaches\nback then would be like it's I remember\none coach was actually really honest and\nI actually appreciated that he's like\nit's like 30% he's like it's 30% 30 to\n40% effort but I'm be honest with you\nguys it's 60% genetics like like if\nyou're like 6'4 and you're just like you\ncan run fast and jump high you have a\nmuch higher chance of becoming a\nbasketball player\nwow and and so you said that you're a\nlogical person what's what what's the\nalternative I guess like emotional be\nlike I'm not going to give up I'm not\ngoing to give up I'm going to train\nevery day for the next eight years and\ntrying and become a professional\nbasketball player I guess I assume it\nmeans like emotional okay which I can be\nemotional actually sometimes I can be\nlike super emotional I'm either logical\nor I'm super emotional I feel like that\nI get to a point where I just like it\njust like flips a switch how does that\nwork I don't know I don't just like\nflips a switch I guess there's certain\nthings that make me emotional but\nthere's certain things that don't I also\nfeel like some times I can just like\nturn off turn it off I'm like okay like\nemotions like I'm like okay I need to\nlike Focus up like I need to like I need\nto just\nlike not I I need to not be emotional\njust look at this like very like\nobjectively and like figure out like\nwhat the best solution is because\nsometimes like there's like situations\nwhere it's beneficial to be like that\nokay I don't know what situations those\nare but it it's beneficial to be able to\nsuppress your emotions yeah I think so\nbecause I think sometimes yeah I think\nso I think like if there's like you're\nlike mad at someone I do I I I it's like\na dumb scenario but I try and do it a\nlot of times when I'm mad at my friend\nI'm like I'm I'm like all right I need\nto stop being mad this like a very basic\nexample but I like I'll like all right\njust stop being mad let me think at it\nlet me think through it from his\nperspective and why is he upset with me\nwhy are we mad at each other it's like a\nreally dumb example that's like an\nexample where I will like at certain\npoint i' like okay I just need to stop\nlike being angry and like think about\nthis why is that a dumb example\nuh because just like two friends arguing\nthere's no like it's like two good\nfriends arguing there's nothing on the\nline there's no like I can be mad at him\nfor like whatever it's it's not going to\nmatter we're just going to continue\nbeing friends I\nguess no I I disagree completely why is\nthat so you say that you're good friends\nyeah like we've been friends for like a\nlong long long long time and therefore\nif you all get mad at each other it\ndoesn't matter right you'll always be\nfriends well I think it depends on what\nwe're mad at each other about if we're\nmad mad at each other about something\nlike a lot of times like we're going\nlike I'm saying that in a in my example\nthat I was giving you we're mad at each\nother we're mad at each other over\nsomething not important not something\nimportant I'm mad at I'm mad at my\nfriend\nbecause he took my ice cream or\nsomething when he usually doesn't but he\nhad like some reason to but I was like I\ndon't care you took my ice cream you\ncan't do that yeah so sapnap I I would\nactually say that the reason that you I\nI would say it goes the other way so the\nreason that yall are good friends and\nthat you will always be good friends is\nbecause of the way that you manage minor\nconflicts but it actually didn't always\nused to be like that it's actually kind\nof recent that like I'd say in the past\npast I don't know I think it was us\nliving together well it's mainly for me\nand my friend George that like we we've\nactually become I think our our\nrelationship has become a lot more\nhealthy like we we'll talk about things\nlike we'll talk about why we're mad at\neach other and why what he did upset me\nand why what he he did what I did upset\nhim which I don't really do with anyone\nelse kind of interestingly enough um\nbecause at first like we'd always like\nkind of like prank not prank like meeme\nwe called it meme each other like for\nexample I don't know like like let's say\nlike I saw a stain on his shirt I\nwouldn't tell him previously even though\nwe were friends and like good friends I\nwouldn't tell him in the hopes that like\nsomeone would point it out and he'd be\nembarrassed yeah and I and like one day\nhe was like he's like look we need to be\nfriends he's like we're friends but\nwe're not friends he's like we need to\nlike try and help each other and like\nnot like just like own each other\nconstantly and he's like and then he's\nlike for example you have chocolate on\nyour shirt right\nnow he's like previously I would have\nleft that there and hoped it melted and\nthen you would have gotten a stain on\nyour shirt um but then we started not\ndoing that to each other and then it\njust continued progressing into I think\nmore healthy stuff where it's like we'd\nexplain why we're mad at each other and\nstuff like that that's some pretty\n[ __ ] cool Innovation let me tell you\nwhat yeah it was really really stupid\nit's kind of fun\nno I mean I I think it's sad that you\nkind like I mean I I I I I really don't\nthink that's stupid I think it's like\nthis is you know there's like a\nloneliness epidemic going on like it's\nhard for people to make friends and I\nthink what's happening is we have this\nwe have this like social skills atrophy\nmhm and then we also don't like try to\nimprove right there's also this like\nsentiment nowadays of it's kind of like\nif you can't handle me at my worst you\ndon't deserve me at my best yeah and and\nso there's like the sentiment of like\nand and then there's also this weird\n[ __ ] that goes on like so this is like\nyou know suppressed emotions coming out\nit's like this person is my friend but\nI'm going to be [ __ ] passive\naggressive and MH and then it's actually\nI mean it's hard to sit down and say hey\nwe got to stop doing this to each\nother yeah yeah I mean luckily we\nhaven't had like any like anything I I\nmean most of our arguments are kind of\nlike like non in my opinion like\nnon-important like it's not like really\na big deal uh but I think it's good that\nwe at least like talk about it cuz I\nhope that if eventually there ever is a\nbig deal that we will be able to sounds\nlike you guys are laying a foundation of\ncommunication talk it through I hope so\nbe ni good dude I I think it's actually\nlike we see this a lot also in like male\nmale platonic relationships where like\ndudes don't know how to like talk to\neach other anymore it's like hey bro we\ngot to like I know we're friends but we\ngot to start being friends what does\nthat mean like we both know exactly what\nit means I think a lot of like at least\nall of my I mean a a lot of my male male\nplatonic relationships is honestly just\neveryone's just kind of like mean to\neach other but it's like funny so it's\nlike it's like interesting I I find that\nlike really really common like it's just\nlike a bunch of dudes and we're all just\nlike we're all making fun of each other\nbut you know there's there's a science\nit's not necessarily bad I kind of like\nit like it's like funny yeah it's kind\nof sad so you know there's a scientific\nterm for that what is that it's called\nthe negative expression of a positive\naffection it's something negative what\ndoes that mean exactly negative\nexpression right so of a positive\naffection so you're being mean because\nyou like each other like so it's like\nit's like when someone gets engaged\nright we're very happy for the person\nbut we're like a bro you're so whipped\nbro oh my God bro yeah right and then\nyou kind of clap him on the back like we\nwe express positive affection through a\nnegative expression so we basically you\nknow make fun of each other I guess I\nthink it I think that's fun I think as\nlong as it's not like the only time like\nyou only do that I think it's it's fun\ncuz I kind of I kind of like that like I\ndon't know I like it's like it's like\nfunny I just I mean I like to laugh and\nstuff like that's like like as long as\nlike you're not actually being like too\ntoo mean about it which even sometimes\nit is fun like as long as everyone's\nokay with it it is fun to actually be\nmean like like you know because it's\njust funny like like I I I like\nfriendships that where it's like\neveryone can kind of like be like a like\na like a jerk to each other um as long\nas it's like in like good taste you know\nwhat I mean like you're doing it to be\nfunny you're not doing it to like\nactually just like piss someone off yeah\nso I I think we're actually pretty good\nat recognizing um the lack of malice\nright so there isn't an intention to\nhurt when you're mean to someone yeah\nthere's an intention to actually Bond\nand even have fun MH and and as long as\nI think there's also reciprocity is\nimportant so as long as it's like things\nI think get get into the bullying realm\nwhen like one person is always being\nmade fun of and like but as long as\nthere's Tit for Tat and we're kind of\nyou know you said you you guys are\nmeming each other and I think each other\nis a big part of it well I've also seen\ngroups where like it's kind of\ninteresting like there is kind of\nsomeone on the bottom of the totem pole\nand they kind of get made fun of the\nmost but like sometimes that person I\nfeel like they like almost like like it\ncuz like I sounds maybe I'm\npsychoanalyzing them but it gives them\nattention cuz like sometimes I'm like\nI'm like why don't you like if that was\nme like I would be like guys like make\nfun of someone else sometimes I I would\nsay something but like they don't care\nwhich I mean obviously there's like\nmultiple scenarios but like I feel like\nthere is scenarios where like kind of\nlike like it which is interesting to me\ncan can you say a little bit more about\nthat I can't say I don't I mean I don't\nwant to get specific but I've seen like\nfriend groups where like someone gets\nmade of fun of the most but like I feel\nlike they don't mind it like they they\ndon't mind being made fun of the most\nhow do you understand why they don't\nmind it because it sounds like you would\nmind it right I would mind it but that's\nbecause maybe maybe they're more secure\nwith themselves or maybe they like the\nattention I don't know I don't know I\nwould assume it's because they get more\nattention because you know so I I think\num it's possible for sure so I I I do\nthink that it's interesting the way\nyou're describing it I would use\nslightly different words which I don't\nblame you for it because I I think it's\nyou know I I think\nyou'll uh so I I would say that people\nwho are\nfrequently the butt of jokes\nmhm very frequently do engage in certain\nkinds of behaviors to keep themselves in\nthat position mhm so I I think that's\nmaybe what you're leaning into yeah yeah\nthat that's that yeah right because\nbecause like it I don't know like so\nthey they for prime example like so you\nwould\nsay hey guys like make fun of someone\nelse you would say something or do\nsomething to stop the behavior if you\nwere unhappy with it and other people\nwill sometimes even do things like make\nfun of themselves or like other kinds of\nthings the interesting thing is I don't\nthink they like it so in my kind of more\nclinical experience I think what's going\non is often times they are afraid of\nwhat happens if they to stop it I see so\nif you're insecure and you're in a\nfriend group mhm trying to challenge\npeople who are making fun of you can\nsometimes come at a high cost and often\ntimes these people engage in this kind\nof stuff even if like your friends\naren't going to bully you further like\nif you said like hey lay off like most\npeople will be pretty nice to you but\noften times this comes from like places\nwhere they tried that and it didn't work\nor they're afraid that if they try to\nset limits like people won't invite them\nto things anymore and people will\nostracize them and stuff like that so\nthey kind of feel like they can't rock\nthe boat and so they kind of tolerate a\nlot of bad\nbehavior yeah that makes sense as well I\ncould totally see someone operating like\nthat and who knows maybe sometimes they\njust do it for the\nattention I Sur there's got to be at\nleast one person that just likes it yeah\nlike they like they don't care and they\nyou know obviously if you're constantly\nyou're being made fun of and you don't\ncare you are getting more attention so\nthere got be at least one person\nso out of the stuff that we've talked\nabout I know we're kind of bouncing all\nover the place atnap anything in\nparticular seem interesting to you or\nanything you want to talk about a little\nbit more oh gosh you have any options\nwhat do people\ntypically uh well sometimes if people\nlike want to understand something about\nthemselves or if they want to like if\nthere's a like something that they are\ncurious about like people will sometimes\nask about things like meditation\nsometimes we'll talk about Consciousness\nand what happens after death like\nsometimes we'll and I think a platonic\nrelationship and even Dynamics like of\nfriend groups and um I think there's a\nlot of interesting stuff about so I\nthink it's interesting because it sounds\nlike you and your friends y'all are all\nrelatively successful YouTubers right or\nthe three y yeah but it sounds like you\nguys had a friendship before you became\nsuccessful yes I think that's very\nimportant so so that's that's also very\ninteresting because there I've worked\nwith groups of people like that before\nso um a well documented case I think is\nif you look at like PayPal so a lot of\nthe original people who started PayPal\nwent on to do other successful companies\nMH and so that there's this interesting\nphenomenon in the business world of like\nbasically like groups of people who all\nbecome very\nsuccessful and if you look at like the\nrandom chance of it the likelihood that\nthree separate people who all decided to\nbecome YouTubers all achieve the level\nof success that you do is exceedingly\nlow mhm so there is actually a causitive\neffect there's something going on in\ny'all's\ninteractions that result in all three of\nyou becoming successful and people have\ndone everything up to including things\nlike case studies and stuff like that to\ntry to figure out like what's the secret\nsauce with this group of OG YouTubers or\nwhat's people haven't done that for OG\nYouTubers but they've done it definitely\nin the business world I I mean as\nsomeone that is in one of those groups I\nthink honestly I think it's just like\nit's just a different level of trust\nthat you have with people that you kind\nof did it with from the beginning that\nyou're friends with before before\nsuccess that you will just never be able\nto have with anyone else unfortunately\nlike you just won't like it's impossible\nto and at least in my opinion I feel\nlike it's impossible the same level of\ntrust that you have with someone that\nhas been there with you since the very\nbeginning versus someone that you met\nwhile you were successful what makes it\nimpossible\num I guess it's impossible to ever\nreally know for sure whether or not\nsomeone is like your friend\nbecause at least in my opinion whether\nbe whether they're your friend because\nit's Ben official once you're successful\nversus not like how do you know how do\nyou know for sure unless you could ask\nthem but it doesn't mean anything they\ncould just lie like I guess like I just\nknow that these guys are my friends\nbecause they want to be my friends and\nthat even if we stopped being successful\nand we had nothing that we'd be friends\nyeah so there's just a different level\nof trust that with them that I have that\nI don't think is possible to have with\nanyone else so when you make a friend\nnow what goes through your head head\nabout your relationship with this person\num honestly I mean I don't think it's\ntoo much different now it's just like I\nthink I I just when I make a friend now\nI just want to be I I would like for\nthat same level of trust to be there but\nI just feel like it's hard for it\nto um actually\nlike I just think it's impossible for it\nto get there the same level trust I just\ndon't see how it's possible because that\nthat question will always be in the back\nof my mind which I don't know if that's\na me thing but I feel like it's I feel\nlike it's just a logic thing I don't\nknow if it's just like me whatever but I\nfeel like it's just like logical it's\nlike oh how do you know like for sure\ncan you walk me through the logic um the\nlogic is how do I know for sure this\nperson I mean obviously I think I think\nI think it's interesting because I think\nit is a bit of both like I think I don't\nthink someone's I don't think someone is\njust going to be my friend because it's\nI don't think I'm going to become\nfriends with someone that just wants to\nbe my friends cuz it's beneficial but I\nthink it's like a it's like a\nsubconscious thing to them it's like I\nthink it's I think a lot of the times\nit's subconscious it's just like oh it's\nbeneficial to be friends now and that's\nin the back of their mind like they're\nnot actively thinking that so then they\nbecome your friend and then when it's\nnot beneficial it's more easy for them\nto just not be a friend anymore whereas\nI won't ever have that with these guys\nbecause that's not in their mind in the\nback of their mind\nsubconsciously yeah so I I think it's\nit's challenging so what I'm kind of\nhearing you say is that\nand and I I agree by the way and this is\nnot unusual so so first thing is that we\nwe've worked with about 500 content\ncreators at HG now and this is a huge\nproblem for basically all of y'all Or us\nif I include myself yeah um so I'm in\nsome ways a little bit lucky\nbecause I have uh I had a life before\nbecoming a content creator so I had a\nlot of friendships and I I think that's\nkind of what you're alluding to as well\nright so like the friendships that you\nform before you're a content creator\nfeel very different from what you form\nafter a content creator yeah and and\npart of that is because like so so I use\nthe term business of friendship yeah so\na lot of content creators are literally\nin the business of friendship and it\ncreates all kinds of problems especially\nwhen like people you know you get like\nall these like hate videos get made or\npeople have drama or this kind of stuff\nand then like it really blurs the line\nbetween you know if someone says hey I'm\nyour friend and someone just accused you\nof doing something a little bit Shady\nright then like do they get guilt by\nassociation and then their brand gets\ndamaged and like all this kind of like\nweird [ __ ] starts entering the picture\nyeah I mean it's interesting because in\nthose scenarios like I guess I don't I\ndon't necessarily like blame anyone for\nfor that because it's like yeah you got\nto protect yourself like I get it um I\nguess like for\nme I don't know I don't know I guess\nlike yeah I mean like I don't\nnecessarily blame anyone for that like I\ndon't I wouldn't even be mad at anyone\nit's like yeah I mean like I get it like\nthat's like sometimes like you got to\nyou got to you got to take care of\nyourself and like I don't blame you but\nlike that's why but that's why I mean I\ndidn't always use to think like that\nlike when I first started doing con\ncreation like I was kind of a little bit\neveryone's my friend like why would they\nyou know what I mean like I didn't think\nabout it and then like you know you\nlearn you learn and things change well\nyou just learned that like you you\nlearned that like in the back like like\nfor example in the back of M like like I\nthink there's like a subconscious like\noh it's like like it's like I think\nthere's a subconscious like like there's\nreasons why someone would be your friend\nthat aren't like what you would want in\na friendship and it's subconscious I\nthink a lot most of the time it's\nsubconscious I think it's an active\nthing like oh I'm going to be this\nperson and I'm sure I do it too which\nlike I would admit I I do it too I'd\nimagine too like where it's like you're\nmore likely to become someone's friend\nsub because subconsciously it benefits\nyou to become their friend and stuff\nlike that whereas in the real world that\ndoesn't happen as much I mean I'm sure\nI'm sure it still does obviously with\nwork and jobs and such\num so that and as long as like it that\nalso blurring the lines with like oh\nlike your you know your friend is\naccused of something Shady or this and\nthat and the other or I don't know what\nit is that like your friendship gets\nblurred because there's business\ninvolved and they have to protect\nthemselves which I don't blame anyone\nfor and I also don't blame anyone for\nsubconsciously becom you having that\nsubconscious thing because I'm sure I do\nit too I'm sure everyone I mean sure\nevery literally everyone does it so yeah\nso I I I mean that sounds very logical\nbut but all all that for me to say is\nthat I value my friendships I have with\nthe two guys that I do with before that\nI value my friendship with them\nexceedingly exceedingly High because we\nwere friends before YouTube and that I\ndon't have to worry about either of\nthose two things yeah I mean I think\nthat's huge dude like I think um you\nknow I also we also see that in\nrelationships where sometimes I'll I'll\nwork with people who become successful\nand then then like the Romantic\nrelationships get very very confusing\nmhm so in that way I'm pretty lucky like\nI I the the person I'm married to now we\nstarted dating like when I was a\nnobody and so our our relationship in\nthat way feels like pretty strong\nbecause you know she could easily\nupgrade it at like any point yeah um and\nand so impossible I huh I said not it's\nimpossible now\nit's missed your chance if you wanted an\nupgrade you know um so so you know it's\ninteresting cuz I I see that a lot\nespecially when when I work with people\nwho are like like Founders um and\nentrepreneurs is like at some point\ndating becomes a little bit challenging\nbecause you're not quite sure like who\nthis person is dating are they\ndating the real you or are they dating\nthe external version of you the\nsuccessful version of you founder CEO\nright you know yeah I think I think it\napplies just any kind of relationship\nwhether it be platonic romantic uh\nwhatever I gu it doesn't apply to\nbusiness relationships because you're\nboth like a Strictly Business\nrelationship because you're both under\nyou know it's it's just business like no\nI'm I mean they're co-founders who [ __ ]\nall the time yeah okay\nwell I guess if you're if you're if\nyou're [ __ ] your co-founder then the\nline gets a little bit blurred yeah I\nmean that that that that happens all the\ntime yeah I'd imagine makes sense yeah\nand and so yeah uh so I I'm kind of\ncurious so that I was just offering like\na couple things so it sounds like we're\nkind of like moving in the direction of\nlike relationships and understandings\nlike these things um anything does that\nsound okay for us to like talk about for\na little bit more you want to talk yeah\nI'm cool with it I'll let you know if\nI'm\nlike um so so you know I I was\nmentioning earlier that like there are\nyou know these cases of people who start\nthings together and all become\nsuccessful do you have a sense of what\nthat secret sauce could have been for\nyall I mean I think it's just like it\nsounds really corny I think it's just I\nthink the secret sof is that I think it\nlike I think there's a I think it's just\nour our friendship is really like\ngenuine you know I mean like in our\nvideos you see us like goofing around\nand and and doing saying stupid jokes to\neach other making fun of each other and\netc etc etc it's just genuine like like\nour OG videos and our videos now like\nthat we would record like it's genuinely\nus just trying to beat a Minecraft\nchallenge while having fun that is\nliterally what it was that was we were\njust like the laughs everything in it\nwas just super authentic and I think\nthat on top of like our analytic Minds\nfor YouTube and and and and doing things\nthat we think are good videos and\ntesting the algorithm and this and that\nand the other was like a really good\nlike combo I think I think that's what\nmade it successful for YouTube\nspecifically and and so it sounds like\nall three of y'all have analytical minds\nand you guys like are good at that uh\nyeah I mean I think I think we all like\nrub off on each other so I think\nlike I think like I was less\nanalytical like you know like before I\nmet them and then they made me more\nanalytical and I'm I don't yeah I'd say\nyeah we are all analytical but I think\nit's because like\nwe're together you know what I mean like\nit just like but also it's like I don't\nwant to make it sound like we're like\nlike super analytical robots CU we're\nnot but like we're I think we're we're\nanalytical when it comes to like YouTube\nstuff and like like being like Oh like\nlet's like like test the algorithm let's\ntry this let's do this let's this video\nidea seems good let's let's do that and\nthis and that and the other and we do\nthat like a lot more than we do now but\nthat's what I think was really\ngood do you all get into\nfights yeah like argument\nnot AR not fist fights fights like fist\nfights not fist fights but just like\nlike like an argument is like I believe\nthis and you believe this and we kind of\nargue it out but like you all have like\nconflict well like what separates in I\nbelieve this and you believe that what\nwhat makes it a conflict I guess I don't\nknow some degree of like person it's a\nbrilliant question by the way stop now\num because I think some people don't\nunderstand the difference but um I I\nthink some amount of person\npersonal association or even dislike\nright so like you can have people just\nto give you an example like you can have\npeople who politically disagree mhm what\ncreates a fight is is not like a fist\nfight but what creates a fight is like\nwhen you have a set of political beliefs\nI think you are stupid or I attach a\npersonal devaluation along with the\ndisagreement I mean I'm sure we have I\nmean I'm sure we have but\nI mean I'm sure we've yeah when when\nwe've argued I guess we I'm sure there's\ntimes where we have used like a a\npersonal thing like a negative personal\nthing to further our argument yeah and\nand whatever so I guess we have thought\nbut I think I think you have to it\nsounds weird I think you to have like a\nto have like a a next level of\nfriendship and and and relationship with\npeople that you have to in my opinion\nyou have to go through everything to\nknow that you can go through everything\nto have that level like uh yeah we\nfought before but like we ended up still\nbeing friends and I feel comfortable and\nI feel comfortable that if we do get in\nto find the future that it'll be\nfine in my opinion I think I think you\nhave to go through pretty much you know\nyou have to go through an argument you\ngot to go through a fight you got to go\nthrough a big fight you got to go\nthrough this and that and the other to\nknow at least for me to know that like\noh yeah our friendship is secure and\nthat I know if we will fight again or we\ndo have a huge big fight that it's going\nto be fine because it had it previously\nin the past do you do you think yall are\nunusual in that way\nway\num I guess I don't think most people\nthink like that so maybe maybe I think I\nguess that is like slightly unusual but\nI think I think that's the correct way\nto think about it so I to um yeah like I\nsaid like we can be yeah I think so I'd\nsay\nso yeah that's so interesting so but\nit's like I think I think a lot of times\nwe're not logical in the moment like\nI'll be like like someone I'll be pissed\noff oh my God like then I'll be then\nI'll be saying things like we'll be\narguing in like a like a a text message\nand then eventually it'll get to the\npoint where it gets logical and then\nwe'll be like well I didn't like this\nlike At first it'll be like you're a\ndumbass why'd you do this you pretty\ntypical and then eventually it gets to a\npoint where it's like I didn't like this\nbecause you did this and you should have\ndone this and then he'll be like you\nreply and you'll be like well I only did\nthis because you did this and and then\nit gets and then and then once it gets\nto that point it gets resolved okay\ninteresting so so\nyeah that's so interesting so this is\nthis is kind of like I guess this is\njust what we're talking about and if you\nwant to change topics let me know saap\nbut like what I'm hearing is that\nthere's like three or four really\nimportant things which I think are\nactually quite rare that y all have\ntogether MH um the first is that there\nis authenticity and your content is\ngenuinely enjoyable this is absolutely\nnecessary for making good content MH so\ny'all are having fun MH um I think the\nsecond thing is\nthere seems to be a couple of different\ncollaborations that y all do that are\nnot related to the content that people\nsee so you all collaborate what sounds\nlike\ncreatively right so you bounce ideas off\nof each other so you're you kind of have\nlike a couple of different heads that\nare all good at making content that are\nthen like trying to decide like what to\ndo that we also see with like co-founder\ngroups when you have like three people\nwho have an entrepreneurial head and\nwhen they bounce ideas off of you each\nother the finished product is usually\nway better I like to touch on that\nactually I think I think I think that\nthat's spot on I think like like I think\nwe all have like different like in the\nin the ideology phase of our content and\nlike brainstorming and this and the\nother that we all are very separate very\ndifferent I'd say like dream is very\nlike the guy that's coming up with the\nideas i' say George is the guy that's\nlike shooting down the ideas no this one\nsucks I don't like this one he's kind of\nlike sometimes like annoying it's like\ncome on please let's just let's do it\nand then he's like no I don't I don't\nwant to do it I don't think it's good\nenough and then I'm like the guy that's\nlike I'm kind of more of like the let's\njust do it let's go let's go I think\nthis one's good like I'm kind like\npushing us to like actually go and do it\num so I think that's how like we work\nyeah so that's really interesting right\nso there's a dynamic of like um so I I\nwon't name who but there there's a pair\nof very successful investors that\ninvest that that have a very good track\nrecord and they have a very similar\nDynamic so the first thing is that they\ndon't make an investment unless both of\nthem agree MH and secondly like one of\nthem is like the stuff who brings things\nin and the other one is the person who\nshoots things down yeah um and and what\nthey find is that if they both can get\non board with something then it is good\nidea right makes sense uh so so it's\nit's interesting that you all have an\nidea\ngeneration like an idea opposing and\nthen like someone's The Brak someone's\nthe fuel and someone's the map yeah and\nand it it it it's really interesting how\nyou can just see that like even how you\ndescribe it um so you guys have a\ncreative process that seems to work well\nit sounds like yall are also good at\nlike your postmortem so like your\nanalysis after the fact mhm what what\ndoes that look\nlike like\nafter uh postmortem of what like like\nwhen you guys let's say y'all yall are\nyall decide to go ahead with some idea\nand it turns out to not be that good\nwhat does that look\nlike I mean yeah it'll be like\ndisappointment a man that that video\nsucked but a lot of times it's just like\nwell what can you do just you learn from\nit now we know that that is not a good\nidea I think there's there's you know it\nsounds like it sounds stupid but there\nis like positive to G from me it's like\nyeah like well now we know that that\nidea was not as good as we thought it\nwas so we don't have to spend more time\non it versus if it was a good idea we\nwould do something similar to that idea\nand and try and Branch off of it but now\nwe know that's not a good idea so we'll\nwe'll move on to the next one is like\nthe way we try and look at it obviously\nthere's going to be disappointment\nthere's going to be oh man that video\nsucked I wish it did better um and I\nthink that's something that like we've\nlike you know it's like we just have to\nyou's got to keep going he's got to it's\nlike is there is there\nblame no I don't think so I I mean I'm\nsure I'm try I'm trying to think is\nthere\nblame um no I don't think so I don't\nthink anyone like there rarely do I\nthink I think we view it all as like a\ncollaborative effort so it's like okay\nthe blame on all of us equally if there\nis blame like it's like okay well\nobviously we shouldn't have done that\nvideo we're idiots like we're stupid why\nwhy did there's a lot of we why did we\ndo that there's rarely I feel like\nthere's like a why'd you do\nthat uh why why isn't their Bo you have\nany idea well for like a YouTube video\nwas because like no no one's forced to\nupload a YouTube video like we\nall like it's like we all agreed on it\nlike you know what I mean like if like\nor if you uploaded it at least at the\nbare minum you agreed to do it it's not\nlike it's not like it's not like the\nother two guys are like you have to\nupload this you need to upload this like\nI mean I'm sure there there's times\nwhere like we like we're pushing you\nwe're saying yeah you need to upload\nthis we really think you should upload\nthis you should do this but like the end\nof the day it is your YouTube channel\nand like obviously our YouTube channels\nare just so intertwined that it just it\ndoes feel like a Wii thing okay like on\nYouTube YouTube wise they're just so\nintertwined like I just like they it\njust does feel like a we thing like it\nalmost feels like dream and George's\nchannels are mine and they my Channel's\ntheirs vice versa yeah so I I think it's\ninteresting cuz I you know I had written\nsomething down some time ago which is\nthe word ego so I'm noticing uh a lack\nof ego so I I'm I'm not hearing a whole\nlot about\njealousy well I mean I do get jealousy I\njust don't get jealousy with my two\nfriends because I feel because why it\nbenefits me if they're successful it it\nso massively benefits me like like my my\nYouTube channel has 4 million Subs but\nlike in like my whatever my my whatever\nwhatever is but my numbers are so\ninflated because I'm attached to more\nmore successful people but I don't view\nit that way it's just like okay like how\ndo you view it I view it as their\nchannels are partially mine I guess\nthey're not but I view like I view like\nI view it like that and I view and they\nview it like the same way like they're\nmy Channel's partially theirs even\nthough like legally and whatever it's\nnot but monily it's not but I I I think\nwhat I'm hearing like that that's this\nis actually quite rare right so if you\nlook at groups of content creators what\nusually tends to happen is there's a lot\nof ego at play there's a lot of jealousy\nat play there's a lot of I put more work\ninto this and I mean sometimes that does\nhappen like sometimes I'll be like I\nwant that idea and then like sometimes\nthere's a good idea and like we'll be\nfighting for it a little bit um but then\nsometimes I'll just be like well or or\nsometimes George Will whatever we'll\nrealize it fits better on someone else's\nChannel and like we'll drop it it's\nwhatever like yeah it is like annoying\nand like I'm not going to be like yes\nI'm so happy you took the idea that I\nwanted but like at the end of the day if\nGeorge's video gets it's so it's so\nanalogical George's video let's say I\nreally wanted a video and it went on\nGeorge's Channel instead yeah George is\nGNA get the views and the money but\nguess what every time someone watches\nhis video and they watch all the way\nthrough it's going to be my video that's\nrecommended afterwards so I mean like\nthere is that there's that level of well\nI am going to benefit from this anyway\nso yeah so no I mean I think the\nattitude is important the concept of\nlike we instead of me is like huge so it\nalso sounds like you guys have a very\ngood method of conflict\nresolution which is also based on trust\nand even like some communication skills\nthat you all have advanced and and the\nreason I I bring this stuff up is\nbecause like I've worked with people\nwhere like I try to go in and I try to\nteach thish so it's it's really\nfascinating to see so I I see like\ncreative collaboration authenticity\nanalysis trust and conflict resolution\nand then an absence\nof ego in a kind of like us\nmentality yeah I think with us it we do\nhave ego but it's us as we have like us\nas an ego like yeah for us us us three\nyeah there's an ego there yeah 100% I\nmean but that bind possible not it binds\nus together yeah yeah that's super cool\nman I I think it's it's fascinating to\nhear and I think a lot of people I think\na lot of people can benefit from like\nunderstanding I I mean I would\ncompletely agree like this is almost\nlike organizational psychology where\nlike how do you get a group of people to\nlike function at their best and it's so\ninteresting because all three of yall\nare are quite successful right so\nthere's there's something going on that\ny'all are doing I mean one option is\nthat there's just a one in a million\nchance and we just found the one house\nwhere there's like three people that are\none in a million but I think that I\nthink the much more likely thing is that\ny'all trust each other that y'all are\nwilling to I also hear you know that you\nguys kind of went in with each other mhm\nright so when yeah when dream was like\nHey I'm going to become a YouTuber and\nyou were like okay I'll do it with you\nbro yeah yeah yeah it was it was kind of\nlike that it was kind like okay like\nlet's do it I I just didn't see the\ndownside like let's do it so yeah I\nthink that I think that was like super\nimportant that we did it together yeah\num we did it together I think that's I\nthink that's like super super important\nany questions oh sorry go ahead no I I\nwas just rambling go ahead any questions\nfor\nme hm I don't know I don't think so\nnothing off the top of my\nhead um yeah that that that's really\ncool like I'm I'm just trying to think a\nlittle bit\nabout you know what we can learn from\nyou I I think the way that you're\nlogical is really interesting you\nmentioned one thing which is like you\nsaid that sometimes you're logical until\nyou're not yeah I mean like I don't know\nlike I I I can get so f up to a point\nwell it's like it's like it's almost\nlike waves it's it's like logical\nlogical logical and oh I'm pissed off\nand I got to be pissed off and I got to\ncool I mean it's pretty like normal I\nthink you get pissed off oh and you're\nnot logical while you're mad obviously\nlike no one I feel like very few people\nif you're logical while you're mad then\nyou're just like a like a genius because\nlike it's so it's so hard and you're\nlike hot and upset like it's like like\nit literally just fogs your mind it's\nterrible but boom I'll be mad and I got\nto go through the whole like if you try\nand talk to me before I'm done going\nthrough my my stages of anger it's just\npointless it's just pointless we're not\ngoing to Resolute I have to calm down\nand then we can go again how long does\nthat do do you realize when you're mad\num not at the beginning not at the\nbeginning U at the beginning I'm like no\nI'm not mad like what do you mean I'm\nmad I'm obviously I'm not mad uh but\nthen towards the end I'll realize I'm\nmad and I'm realized I'm down um I\nactually I think mine is really fast I\nthink it's like abnormally fast like\nI'll be mad and I won't be mad anymore\nit's like fine whatever like I I'm just\nso like over it I just want to get over\nit like I'll be mad and a lot of times\nI'm not I'm done being mad before other\npeople are done being mad and I like\nwait i' like sit here all right whatever\nI'll wait for him to stop being mad\nmine's really quick how how what is\nreally quick\nlike literally like 10 minutes like 10\n20 30 minutes like I'm not mad for hours\nit l be within an hour I'll be like over\nit usually like literally like 10\nminutes like I'll be mad like let's say\nlike we had like an incident outside\nI'll be mad by the time like I we\nseparate I'm like I'll like get away\nfrom me I get away get the [ __ ] away\nfrom me I'll separate I'll go to my room\nI'll drink a little bit of water and I'm\ndone I'm done I'm ready to Res like\nresolve the conflict and and you what's\nit like to wait for other people to calm\ndown um it's not too bad it's not too\nbad I was like I'll just wait a little\nbit and usually by I'll be the one that\nwill like at least like I'll try to like\nbe the one that obviously like there's\nback and forth like sometimes they'll be\nthe one but I'll try and be the one that\nbecause because I'm the one that I feel\nlike usually gets over being mad\nquickest that I'll try and be the one\nthat's like look like let's let's let's\nmediate let's negotiate Let's uh\nwhatever uh so and I think that usually\nwill bring down their Madness if they're\nseeing me being like Oh like let's being\nreasonable and let's solve this can you\nteach us some of the words that you use\nwhen you're trying to do that we're\nreally stupid I have a bunch of weird\nwords I'll be like I'll be like no I\nthat's why I'm asking I'll be\nlike\nuh what do we say like let's uh let's\nnego i l say let's negotiate let's let's\nuh let's be Reas there's a lot of let's\nbe reasonable be reasonable uh I'm\ntrying to think of our words we have\nbunch like we really weird stupid words\nthat we use like there's like if you\nwere to like listen to us you'd think\nwe're like weird or super weird I can't\nGod I can't think I'm off the top of my\nhead but a bunch like just Niche words\nlike time to be reasonable like like\nthere's a bunch of reasonable and\nnegotiate I think is like the main one\nno I mean what makes you think that\nthat's\nstupid because it just sounds funny I\ndon't know I don't think it's actually\nstupid I just think it just sounds funny\nwhen I say stupid I don't even sometimes\nI don't actually mean like stupid yeah I\nuse stupid like a lot when I don't\nactually mean stupid but it would be it\nsounds funny to me like let's like let's\nnegotiate like what do you mean let's\nnegotiate like what are we like like we\nat\nWar well kind\nof right so so so I I know it sounds\nkind of like an unusual word but that's\nactually like exactly why I'm asking so\nI I suspect that so A couple of things\nthe first is that you know people will\nsay like okay what's the foundation of a\ngood marriage and people will say\ncommunication is key but no one ever\nteaches you what that means like\ncommunicate what like we're talking to\neach other all the time but that's not\nthe same as communication MH so you have\nsomething you want no no so I just like\nlooking up I I think I think it's like\nreally interesting because we we all\nunderstand the importance of\ncommunication but we don't know like how\nto communicate with friends like we\ndon't know what what words to\nuse so I think one of the the biggest\nproblems that I see is that there is an\nassumption that there are words to use\nMH so people will be like I'm going to\nhave a class on communication and these\nthis is what you should say this is what\nwe get taught as therapists like there\nare ways to say things and there's some\nMerit to that but I think one of the\nbiggest things that's important for\ncommunication is actually developing\nyour own language yeah so I I find that\nlike um in my own relationships and even\nmy platonic relationships my romantic\nrelationships like they're like\ndeveloping your own language for things\nto capture your experience of stuff mhm\nso that like we both know what we're\ntalking about because it's hard to put\nrelationships into words yeah yeah I\nguess we're really good at that we have\na bunch of words that just like if you\nhad to listen to us talk like I swear to\nGod if someone had a camera they just\nlisten to our conversation it would l\nsound like we're speaking like a\ndifferent language sometimes it would\nmake no sense but like to us it makes\nsense like it's like we have a bunch of\nwords that we use to describe a way of\nfeeling\nsomething does anything else come to\nmind i' I'd love to hear just examples\nof that oh God I don't know off the top\nof my head it's it's kind of hard to\ntell it just happens I don't know to me\nlike I don't even think about it I don't\nthink that I'm doing it I just do it\nyeah so so it's an automatic language\nthing yeah yeah like like even when\nwe're not just trying to like resolve a\nconflict even just like explaining\nsomething that we thought was like funny\nor interesting or or weird or whatever\nwe have like different ways of like\ndescribing it in a way that's not the\ntypical English language yeah so so this\nis like I I'll give you all just a\ncouple of examples that I've seen one is\num so we use I I use a conversational\ntechnique with my wife where when we\nwant something we will just ask you like\nwe'll state where we are on a scale of 1\nto 10 m so it's like do you want to eat\npizza\nor sushi for dinner uhhuh and like and I\nwant sushi well I want pizza and then\nthis can go back and forth for a little\nwhile so you guys put a one to 10\nput one 1 to 10 and and then like\nwhoever wants it more gets it and then\nthere's also some interesting\ngamesmanship there where like if I say\nseven like you can bump it up to an\neight right so the first person who\ngives a number is almost like typically\nloses can lose so you're opening\nyourself up to be like so other someone\nelse knows exactly where you are right\nso they can always out bid you and\nthere's no cost I mean but it's also\nlike a Wii so it doesn't help to do that\nbut that's like a simple way of like\nArtic like navigating conflict how much\ndo you want to do this versus how much\ndo you want to do this that's\ninteresting I think typically we have\nthings like that but there's no the way\nwe do it is in a way that and I couldn't\ntell you how I couldn't explain it to\nyou but like we do it in a way that like\nsomeone doesn't have to see that first\nwhatever because I'm not going to lie\nmaybe I'm a bad person for this but if I\nwanted Sushi and let's say I'll just use\nGeorge example said he wanted it seven\nhe wanted Pizza seven out of 10 probably\nnine times out of 10 I would say I\nwanted eight just to just because I want\nwhat I want yeah um maybe I'm selfish or\nwhatever but so we try to find ways that\nyou we don't have to make ourselves like\nwhatever like for example like we'll do\nsomething like for example I'll tell\nlike we we'll do like a silent version\nof that where we'll both whisper into\ndream's ear how bad we want it so that\nway we don't have to you know you guys\ndo that um no but that's an example is\nwe would do that we would do something\nlike that yeah so so so I think but I\nthink that makes sense right the main\nthing is like everyone is on the same\npage about what the game is so you you\nknow it's not like it's either PVP or\nPVE and yall are you all have kind of a\nPVP situation which is not bad it's just\nthe only real problem happens is when\none person thinks it's PVE and the other\nperson thinks it's PVP that's when you\nget into trouble but it sounds like yall\nare on the same page around\ncommunication yeah um and I think this\nis also one of the reasons why so\nthere's like different kinds of like\nlanguage that we'll use we'll have like\ncode words to mean like particular\nthings and and stuff like that like\nwe'll we'll develop like we have our own\nrobust language that if you saw us\ncommunicating once again it would seem\nvery foreign like people wouldn't\nunderstand what we're saying so I think\none of the really interesting things\nthat we're seeing especially with\nrelationships right now like not\nromantic relationships but even platonic\nrelationships there's this loneliness\nepidemic and I think part of the problem\nis that we're friends are so replaceable\nso especially with things like Discord\nand online relationships like you can\nfind a group of new people very quickly\nMH so you can't I don't think you have\nthe opportunity to develop these kinds\nof like\nlanguage skills and it's it's not like\nskill at a particular thing it's\ndeveloping your own vocabulary for a\ngroup of people so that you all know\nwhat you mean MH um we I also do this in\nin therapy as well where where one time\nwith a a therapy patient we uh we\nnoticed that when we would get like into\nstuff that was like somewhat serious\nlike someone would make a dick joke\nyeah right where it's like okay let's\nlike lighten the mood and then what\nhappened is is we both noticed that okay\nlike we're doing this for a reason like\nwhen do we make a dick joke if we make a\ndick joke that means that we're talking\nabout something serious and now we know\nwhat a dick joke means so even then at\nthat point it's like okay is it time for\na dick joke it's like yes let's make a\ndick joke and then we kind of laugh\nabout that we don't actually make the\ndick joke but we're like kind of aware\nso you have to develop your own language\nI also see that in Esports teams too\nwhere people like you know some\ncommunication\nis\nis understandable but some of it is like\nis different yeah I can definitely see\nthat being in Esports teams yeah it's\ninteresting yeah I think it's I guess\nthat's something I didn't really notice\num I just we just do it and then you\npoint it out and I guess it makes sense\nyeah so I I I think it's super\nfascinating and\nlike I don't know exactly what people\ncan take away cuz I I don't I don't\nthink I I think you know some of the\nstuff that yall say will be generally\nspeaking infuriating to other people\nlike time to be reasonable like [ __ ] you\nlike I am being reasonable you're the\none reason you know I mean that does\nhappen that that that's literally\nhappened before when someone's like not\ndone being mad and it that's literally\nhappened yeah but sometimes I think it's\nlike it's like we like for example like\nwith conflict resolution that it'll\nsometimes our stupid language is just\nlike funny it's like an icebreaker okay\nall right like all right whatever let's\nresolve this what's the point like like\nI'll be like like it's just it's an\nicebreaker to a degree no I I think\nthat's huge so like like making the over\nright so like extending the olive branch\nand being like the person who signals to\nyour friend like hey I'm prepared to let\nthis pass or like let's like move\nforward from here it signals to them\nthat I want to move forward from here\num you know it's interesting even what\nyou said then I think that's really good\ndone being mad yeah yeah yeah are you\ndone being mad yeah it's just like like\nI guess someone else if someone else\nsaid that to me like yeah if he says it\nto me at the wrong time I'll be pissed\noff no I'm not done mad but like yeah if\nit's at a good time it's just funny it's\nlike are you done like what it's just a\nweird thing yeah no I mean I I think\nwe'll use I'm thinking about some of my\nown language and we'll sort of use\nsimilar things right things that sound\nreal assholish but like if you're\ngenuinely asking you're like hey are you\nin a space to hear this so that's\nsomething that I think that um is really\nuseful like you can say to someone I'm\nnot ready to have this conversation\nright now or like I need some time\nbefore we address this but being mad is\nI guess like for me I don't like it when\nit's too like like if if someone would\nsay that to me like I'm not ready to\naddress this it would just like piss me\noff like I need I need like that level\nof like stupid language I don't know why\nlike I need that level of like dumb\nlanguage otherwise I'm like why like why\nyou being so serious I wish like why you\nbeing yeah he like so so I I I think\nthat just speaks to the importance of\ndeveloping your own language right\nbecause everyone's like niceness or\npolite\nlike I I'm trying to think\nabout um so you know people will make\nclips of me like saying really mean\nthings to people MH so like because when\nI interview people I will sometimes be\nlike challenging or I won't speak in\nlike a trigger avoidant way sometimes I\ndon't know if that kind make sense yeah\nI understand like you know like in that\nmoment you're an idiot and people will\nsomeone even approached me recently to\nmake a voice pack for a video game\nthat's just basically clips of me saying\nthings that you can then I don't know if\nyou're familiar with these like you know\ntaunts and things like that but I\nthought was hilarious um but and it's\nreally interesting right but I think the\nthe the empathic message behind it or\nthe emotions behind it are what's really\nimportant right so you can say like you\nknow hey let's negotiate or whatever and\nit doesn't work for everyone like\nsometimes if you're if you try to be\nlike overly sterilized or polite like\npeople it'll piss people off yeah it\njust doesn't sound like you're dynamic\nyeah I'm one of those people if you're\ntoo like too correct like if you're like\nlike so I guess it depends it depends on\nwho it's coming from as well like if if\nmy friends like my two friends here\nwould would say that to me I'd be like\nwhat like versus if someone else was\narguing with said that I would probably\ntake it very differently yeah does the\nstatement I'm sorry you feel upset piss\nyou\noff yeah yeah it just feel it feels it\nfeels it feels like demeaning it's like\nwhat do you mean like what are you\ntalking about what do you mean you're\nsorry I feel upset yeah yeah you did\nsorry you made me upset exactly you did\nsomething like it's like it's not my\nfault I'm upset you're the [ __ ] yeah\nexactly yeah I don't like that statement\nyeah so but it can it can be used\nsometimes correctly in the right agreed\nagreed but very rarely I find that that\nwould be good I like a what the [ __ ] bro\nyeah that works yeah and I this is also\nthe interesting thing I've noticed that\na lot of the the right answers that we\nteach for communication tend to be like\ndon't work quite as well for men so I\nfind that like as a dude like a really\nsolid what the [ __ ] bro like really goes\na long way yeah I mean it definitely\ncould go a long way 100%\nyeah anything else um that you're kind\nof thinking of in terms of like what\nyall do differently like how are these\nrelationships that you have with these\ntwo guy guys like different from your\nother\nrelationships\num I don't know I just feel like we're\nlike super I guess I don't I just feel\nlike we're very close like it just feels\nlike for example like it would\nfeel Weir I don't know I don't know I\nguess it just depends I mean it seems\npretty typical for if you're like living\nwith people but like if like we like I\nfeel like we do a lot of things to each\nother so with each other so it if like\nfor example if they were to do something\nwithout me I'd be like what the [ __ ]\nlike I don't know I guess it's kind of\nlike dumb I'm trying to think I don't\nknow honestly I don't know couldn't tell\nyou anything else specifically that that\none seems pretty usual you yeah yeah no\nI mean it sounds like y'all are are\npretty tighten and I think being able to\nlive together is is like a double-edged\nsword like if you can handle it well\nit's really great but it can create a\nlot of conflict sometimes friends don't\nmake the best roommates yeah no I've\ndefinitely heard that but I think I\nthink we I think we're fine as roommates\nso far you never know things could\nchange I I'm kind of curious um just if\npeople from chat have like\nquestions like if you're cool with that\nsure\num because I I think like you've been\npretty much an open book and I think\nwe've kind of like like I think the most\ninteresting thing to me was just the way\nthat y'all interact with each other and\nhow y'all have been able to achieve what\ny'all have achieved so since we've got\nsome time\nleft um let's see if uh some people are\nasking about a communication\nguide\num are you guys honest with each other\nif you're mad do you say you're mad\num I think we're super honest with each\nother I we're yeah I feel like I don't\nhide any like literally anything from\nthem and I feel like they don't as well\nwith me uh I think we're very very\nhonest with each other\num so what about like if yall have\nconflict between two of y'all like does\nthe third person play like Peacemaker\nlike yes yeah that happens a lot happens\na lot but sometimes I don't like The\nPeacemaker sometimes it feels like in\ncertain scenarios that The Peacemaker\nmight be biased which so The Peacemaker\nthat that does happen a lot\num but sometimes it doesn't The\nPeacemaker we you know we try to use The\nPeacemaker but sometimes at least to me\nsometimes I think the peacemaker can be\nbiased in certain scenarios and also I\ncan be biased in certain scenarios yeah\nlike it happens it happens all the time\nit happens whenever the other two\narguing I'm The Peacemaker obviously I\nhave bias like in an argument so\nsometimes it's it's low fr rating um\nso uh any advice for new\nYouTubers advice for new YouTubers oh my\ngosh I don't know I'm so bad at advice\nthe only thing I can say\nis is just try to put out the best\nquality you can take like just and try\nand find something that you actually\nlike try and find videos that you're\ngenuinely passionate about or not\nnecessarily passionate about but that\nyou enjoy because you want you want to\nbe a authentic I think a lot of stuff on\nYouTube is not authentic anymore like I\nthink a lot of it's like super a lot of\nit's super like hand crafted meant for\nthe algorithm and while I do think that\nis a very successful way to do things\nand I'm not saying that you shouldn't do\nthat and you shouldn't try top algorithm\nbut I think that you should try to\nappease the algorithm while doing\nsomething that is authentic that you\nlike because then it will just be better\nlike no I don't think there's any ifs\nhands and buts about if you're genuinely\nenjoying what you're doing what you're\nfilming what you're recording that it\nwill be better than something that it'll\nbe better than something something that\nyou think is a better idea but you enjoy\nless absolutely I I think that's we've\nseen that a lot where uh creators who\nsacrifice too much to the algorithm get\nburnt out and then the real tragedy is\nthat then their conflict their their\ncontent then suffers as burnout\nincreases so you don't have that same\nauthenticity that same enjoyment and\nthat's really what makes content super\nsuccessful yeah\num so a couple of other questions this\nis great by the way\nso uh what's the worst thing about being\na content\ncreator um I'd say privacy I guess\nprivacy it feels like there's always\npeople trying to like know things that\nyou don't want to share and like also it\nfeels like oh like I can't just like\nlike sometimes I just like want to go\nout side and not get recognized and not\nhave the fear of being recognized\nsometimes like like I I look ugly today\nlike I look gross I have like a pimple\non my face or whatever Etc and it's like\nI sometimes like you just want to not\nworry about you want to go to the mall\nbut you don't want to worry about being\nrecognized because you don't want to\ntake a photo because you look gross but\nlike you don't want to obviously if a\nfan meets you it's like it's like oh\nlike I don't want to may never see this\nperson ever again I'll just give him the\nphoto even if I do look kind of gross so\nI guess like that you lose you lose a\nlot of like uh like random things like\nlike like not random things but like\nthings that you never thought you would\ncare about like being able to go\nsomewhere and not worry about being\nrecognized for example yeah I I think uh\nprivacy I guess as a whole I would say\nthat there's a lot of things that we\ntake for granted before we start getting\nrecognized yeah exactly and so and I I I\nknow I've experienced that too in terms\nof just running into people sometimes\nand it's like this is not what I wanted\nto do today yeah and it's it's like like\nsimle things like oh it's like if I'm\nout with like my my parents say I'm like\nvisiting home I don't particularly want\nto be recognized with them cuz like I\ndon't like know I wouldn't want like my\nmom in the bath background of a photo or\nsomething on action it's just like\nannoying like I don't want to like I\nwish I like in an ideal world like I\ncould turn it off like no one could\nrecognize me for the next four hours or\nsomething well I'm doing stuff yeah I\nguess that's something I miss it's just\nlike yeah just privacy as a whole I\nguess I don't know like I keep harping\non that yeah just privacy as a whole I I\nthink it's tough um are\nthere like do you feel like you've\nmissed out on like the college\nexperience or things like that oh God I\nmean I not really I don't care it's so\nworth it it's so worth it where I guess\nlike I don't feel like I missed out oh I\nmissed out on going to random college\nparties like get seem like I guess like\nyou know I if I handcrafted my ideal\nWorld sure I would have had a typical\ncollege experience and then done this\nand but because of the trade-off I don't\ncare no I don't feel like I missed out\nbecause the trade-off to me is so worth\nit that I just I don't I don't feel any\nkind of like a I wish I went to a big\ncollege and had the college experience\nor whatever I mean it sounds like you\nhad a lot of intentionality when you\ndecided to become a full-time YouTuber\nas well right so you were kind of\nbalancing things ahead of time and yeah\nI was balancing yeah yeah because I\nchose to not like to me was a decision\nlike if maybe I I chose like I don't\nwant to I don't want to go to college I\nwant to pursue this so yeah par because\nit those decision feels less whatever\nand and how do you how do you manage\nthings like anxiety burnout what happens\nif you don't feel like making\ncontent\num I don't know I haven't really\nexperienced too much burnout to be\nhonest just\nbecause I don't know I just think like I\nthink I could I don't explain it I don't\nknow I haven't really experienced\nburnout uh to be honest and anxiety I\ndon't know I am a very anxious person\nbut I've just been anxious for a long\ntime that I kind of have like little\nmethods to whatever A lot of times I'll\nbe like you know what I'm anxious about\nthis right now let's see if I'm anxious\nabout it tomorrow or\njust like little things like that\nbecause I am a very very anxious person\nwhat does that mean you're a very\nanxious person like I just feel like\nI'll get like I'll just be like like\nI'll feel anxiety about something it's\nlike hard um it means like I'll be\nworried that something is g to go wrong\nokay I'll be like oh man I really hope\nthis doesn't go wrong or or sometimes\nI'll be anx like something's stupid like\noh did I say something weird this person\ngoing to think less of me because I said\nthat and and then it's I'm only thinking\nthat because I'm anxious if I wasn't\nanxious I like no that's stupid like\nobviously not wait so so how often when\nyou say you're a very anxious person is\nthis something that happens to you\nfrequently yeah like how often I don't\nknow very frequently like every day I\ndon't know about every day I'd say\nprobably around like I'd say I don't\nknow about every day I'd say multiple\ntimes a week I'll be like anxious okay\nand what are some of the tricks that\nyou've developed uh one trick I've\ndeveloped is uh let's see if I'm anxious\nabout this\ntomorrow nice that's that's the biggest\nthing cuz a lot of times like I'll be\nanxious about something that I shouldn't\nbe anxious about like why am I anxious\nabout like the next like I'll be like\nwhy was I like stupid like why am I\nanxious about that a lot of times it'll\nbe like something that'll like trip me\nup but if I were if I wasn't anxious and\nI was thinking about it without like\nhaving that anxious feeling I wouldn't\nbe anxious like I wouldn't like I\nwouldn't care that makes sense yeah so I\nmean I think that's like that's really\nhuge so a couple of things that um I I I\nthink it's so cool how you guys have\nstumbled into stuff that we know\nscientifically but like you guys weren't\ntaught and you yourself especially yeah\nso so uh you know a couple of things\nthat I've really noticed about the way\nthat you manage your emotions is like\none of your best coping mechanisms is\ntime yeah so you just give it time which\nis perfect I think the the biggest\nmistake that most people make with their\nemotions is that they're not able to be\npatient with them mhm so if you look at\njust the way that the brain works like\nthe brain\nany emotion that you experience is going\nto extinguish over time unless you keep\nfeeding it mhm so the best example that\nI use for this is you can have the\nperfect wedding day but all of the Joy\nfrom the perfect wedding day won't give\nyou 40 years of happiness in marriage\nyeah makes sense right so emotions are\nare temporary and our our brain\nliterally has homeostatic mechanisms\nthat will decrease emotion if you're\nfeeling a lot of emotion MH some people\nwill come to equilibrium faster mhm\nother people like we know that if you\nhave like ADHD for example sometimes you\ncan experience more intense emotions for\nlonger periods of time yeah um but I\nthink time is like one of the biggest\nantidotes to emotion and I I think the\nsecond thing that's really interesting\nthat you figured out is you noticed that\nthe conclusions of your mind are shaped\nby your emotional state so literally\nlike the way that your mind functions\nchanges if you're feeling an emotion\nyeah a lot of people think that their\nlogic is like separate or how much they\ncare about something is separate from\ntheir emotion but those even how\nattached you are to things like how much\nsomething matters to you is going to\ndepend on your emotional\nstate yeah makes sense so it's really\ninteresting how you've figured that\nstuff out it's cool\naccidental um cool so let me see if\nthere's any other direction of questions\nuh sure do y all do any particular\nthings to support yourselves through\nlike tough\nsituations H um I don't know anything\nspecific nothing like I can think of\njust like just having people that when\nyou're in a tough situation to that you\ntrust with everything that you can talk\nto is nice I think that's super good I\nthink most people don't have that so\nit's like if I'm going through like\nprobably if I was going through anything\nI would probably talk to them about it\nso I think that but nothing like no no\nno specific\nlike mechanism yeah methods or mechanism\nI'm hearing that you guys have like a\nlike a language that yall use and that\nthere's just a lot of trust yeah right\nand you all have like some practice at\nconflict resolution I think trust is\nreally the main thing because I think it\nhelps you put things like conflict into\ncontext yeah so it's like oh like this\nis just you know we ready to negotiate\nor whatever so that's\ncool all right well I I think we covered\na lot of questions that people have um\nany kind of last thoughts or questions\nfrom your end oh no I really appreciate\nyou talking to me it it was actually it\nwas a lot of fun I like I like thinking\nthings out and talking about them about\ncuz I think a lot of things like\nemotions and friendships and whatever\nhas a lot of like logic behind it and if\nyou you can think it out it's beneficial\nso it's fun I enjoyed it yeah I I think\nwhat I really enjoyed about this\nconversation it was a little bit\ndifferent from what we usually do but I\nI I really like what do you what do you\nusually do I don't know I haven't seen\ntoo many so uh good so so some uh\nsometimes people will have a particular\nlike question or like they'll have\nsomething that they want to learn more\nabout so that'll or they'll have a\nchallenge or a problem of some kind so\nif there's something like that then\nwe'll kind of dig into that um today I\nthought it was just interesting because\nin the absence of that there's still a\nlot to learn like I think you can have a\nuseful\nconversation and like the last time I\ntalked to maybe not the last time like\ntwo times ago when I talked to lwig for\nexample like we just had a conversation\nabout like death and like what happens\nafter death like what do you think\nhappen so like it's it's all over the\nplace yeah um so that was one of my\nfavorite conversations I think that what\nI kind of latched onto here what was the\nmost interesting to to me was this angle\nof there were three people who randomly\nstarted making you uh content let's say\nm and Y all ended up all three of yall\nended up pretty successful and so the\nquestion is like what can we understand\nabout that that Dynamic yeah so that's\njust what I was interested in and the\nway that you the way that you approach\nthings the way that you even approach\nconflict the way that you understand\nyourself the way that you made decisions\nI think as you said you're a logical\nperson and like I see that through and\nthrough even in terms of okay we're\ngoing to have a part-time job we're\ngoing to or maybe it wasn't part-time\nwe're going to have a job we're going to\nhave we're going to go to college and\nwe're going to start this YouTube\nthing yeah and and then like we're going\nto wait and it sounds like your parents\ntake convincing and so you're very very\nmethodical with like the way that you\napproach things nothing seems I mean\nthere but also there's a balance of like\ninspiration right so you're also not\nlike overly robotic like you recognize\nthat there's\nspontaneity that there's like you got to\nC you know strike the iron while it's\nwhile it's hot you got to got get\nexcited about things so I'm noticing a\nreally really solid balance of like\nanalysis and like creativity fun and\ninspiration trying trying to keep\nbalance\nyeah right and and it sounds like you\ndon't let\nyour your you don't have failures you\nhave setbacks right there's like room to\ngrow and that there's a lot of trust and\nyou guys like support each other really\nwell so I I think it's cool to kind of\nget a script for maybe what a successful\ngroup of content creators like looks\nlike cuz people will like collab all the\ntime and then drama happens and [ __ ]\nhappens and yeah it's no fun you know\nand I I think it goes back to this thing\nthat you were saying earlier about you\nguys became really close friends before\ny'all were content creators MH so now\nthat trust there isn't that voice in the\nback of your mind which by the way you\nknow I I think that you can get over\nthat um to a certain degree if you if\nyou're interested and I don't know that\nyou need to but part\ntwo yeah right so so then you could\ntunnel down further into like why is it\nhard for me to trust people people in\nthe same way and part of that is just\npractical because that's youall are in\nthe business of friendship so yeah yeah\ncool cool thank you so much for coming\ntoday man thank you for inviting me it\nwas great yeah take care man awesome you\ntoo adios\nbyebye yeah that was\ninteresting\num you know it's interesting we like I I\nI don't think we do a good job sometimes\nlike on this channel of exploring wins\nso like even if you look at like you\nknow where people post and stuff like\nthat the the challenges and the tears\nget so much\nmore screen time than the\nW's and like this is a huge\nproblem so like I I want to tell y'all\nsomething that that I found incredibly\ninteresting so you know often times when\nwe're trying to solve our problems in\nlife we try to solve our problems right\nso if I'm struggling with something the\nantidote is to fix what is broken but\nthere's a really interesting scientific\nprinciple called positive deviant and\nwe've talked about this a little bit\nbefore I think it's very very\ninteresting what positive deviant is\ncapable of so I'll give you all kind of\na a quick story about positive deviant\nI've told it before so positive deviant\nis actually a book that I think was\npublished in maybe 2010 or\nso so maybe a couple years earlier\nactually maybe\n2003 there was a group of doctors who\nwere uh doing NGO work non-governmental\norganization work and they were tasked\nwith fixing malnourishment in rural\nVietnam so there was basically like a\ncommunity where like children were\nmalnourished right so that they're\nthey're going to go and they travel from\nI think France they go to Vietnam to try\nto fix malnourishment they get a grant\nand their plan is to like if you've got\nmalnourished kids like what do you do\nyou feed them right that's how you fix\nlike if you you're Mal nurse you got to\neat like simple so they get this grant\nthey get a lot of this food Aid they go\nto Vietnam and then they discover that\nlike the food Aid never got there so\nlike the the the government officials\nthere are like we're incredibly sorry\nbut there's no food and so it turns out\nthat there's some degree of corruption\nor something like that and so the\ngovernment is like we're sorry we know\nyou took six months off to come and fix\nthis problem please try to fix it but we\ncan't give you any money what we can\ngive you as a translator a van and a\nplace to stay true story I may have a\ncouple of the details wrong but I heard\nthe story from this person so so then\nwhat they do is they they go into the\nthe rural areas of Vietnam and they find\nthat 50% of the K kids are malnourished\nright and this is terrible like 50%\nmalnourishment is like that's such a\nhigh level of\nmalnourishment and so they were like\nwell we don't know how to solve this\nproblem because we don't have any food\nso like what do we do so then they had\nthis czy crazy thought they said well\nhold on a second all of these people are\nbasically in the same socioeconomic\nstatus they're all rice Farmers right\nthis is a rural part where basically\neveryone's a farmer why isn't it that\n100% of the children are malnourished\nhalf of the families are somehow\npreventing\nmalnourishment and so what they\ndiscovered was something very simple\nthat everyone's a rice farmer and people\nhave these aprons that they go and when\nthey when they're tending their fields\nthere are two things things that people\nwho are not malnourished do the first is\nthat there are various kinds of\ncrustations clams shrimp and other kinds\nof things like that that are in the rice\npatties and so some people when they\nfind one of these like little shrimp or\nwhatever they'll scoop it up and stick\nit in their their uh apron the second\nthing is that there's a kind of weed\nthat grows in the rice Patty which is\nvery nutritious it's very similar if\nyall are familiar with things like\nmustard greens or collard greens these\nare considered poor people food so most\npeople will throw them away but half of\nthe people are eating them and the\nreason that they throw them away is that\nit's like it's poor people food right so\nwe don't eat poor people\nfood so what they sort of figured out is\nthat if you look in a\nsystem instead of fixing the problem one\nthing that you can do is duplicate the\nsolution so instead of trying to fix you\nknow trying to solve okay why are these\npeople malnourished you can ask a\nslightly different question which is why\nisn't every everyone malnourished this\nis the principle of positive deviant and\nso we've used this a lot in terms of the\nway that we make content so e even like\nsome of our approaches to content part\nof the reason that we're pretty\nsuccessful at helping content creators\nis because we used positive deviant so\nwe don't ask people you know what is it\nthat causes your burnout we'll ask that\ntoo but what we'll really ask people is\nwhen you made this really Successful\nvideo what was going on inside you let's\nduplicate your successes let's focus on\nduplicating your successes as opposed to\nfixing your failures so even working as\nin as an addiction psychiatrist a lot of\ntimes we'll focus on the relapse what\nhappened when you relapsed what went\nwrong what were you feeling then what\nhappened where did you go what did you\nwho did you talk to what we don't ask is\nhow are you able to stay sober between\nmonths two and three right so if you\nsort of think about it when someone\ncomes into your office after relapse\nthey'll say I screwed up everything went\nwrong I made the same damn mistake again\nI want to stop making this\nmistake instead sometimes what we can do\nis we can ask them well let's forget\nabout the mistake that you made how did\nyou not make the mistake one month ago\nwhat happened then so in our human Minds\nwe have this very interesting bias which\nis that we're biased towards the\nnegative okay so this is a survival\nthing by the way so what one of the\nthings that we sort of figured out is if\nyou're drinking from like a watering\nhole and one day day you get sick from\nan evolutionary standpoint you want to\navoid that Watering Hole even if it was\nfine the first 90 days you drank from it\nif you got sick on day 91 you'll avoid\nit so organisms that didn't avoid the\nbad outcome ended up getting food\npoisoning again and again and again\ndidn't lead to a survival benefit so we\nliterally Will Wait negative more than\npositive we also see this waiting of the\nnegative in things like gambling and\nother kinds of like neuroeconomic\nstudies so if I if I tell you okay\nthere's a 100% chance that you get $100\nor a 51% chance that you get $200 which\none do you want most human beings will\ntake the guaranteed 100% even though\nthere is technically more money to be\nmade at a 51% chance so we don't think\nwe weigh negatives in our mind more\nimportant than positives this creates a\nhuge bias in our problem solving and\ndecision making because we're constantly\ntrying to fix our problems we're\nconstantly and if you look at like\npeople who ask questions and post right\nmost people will ask questions about how\nto fix something that is\nbroken so the really interesting thing\nis that people have done studies on\npositive deviants and found that if you\nwant to be successful in life don't try\nto fix your problems try to duplicate\nyour Solutions it is a subtle but very\nimportant difference why is this just\nbeing discovered after thousands of\nyears of like humans being on this\nplanet it is because of this bias\ntowards the negative right so our brains\nwill ignore our\nsuccesses so another great example of\nthis is there's there's a guy named Seb\nwho's a a pro DOTA player and I loved he\nhe made a Blog after he won the\ninternational many years ago now it's\nbeen many years ago um and and it's\nreally interesting because you know a\nlot of times when you look at orts\nthey'll kind of say like oh like this\nplayer is the weakest link so we need to\nreplace this player because they're the\nweakest link and in seb's blog he kind\nof talks about how he views things\ndifferently he doesn't look at someone\nwho is the weakest link because they're\nunderperforming he looks at the height\nof their\nperformance and says this is what this\nperson is capable of how do we duplicate\nthis\nconsistently because if you really think\nabout what you're capable of everyone\nlooks at oh I don't have friends or I\ndon't have many friends or you know I\nhaven't had a I haven't had a date in\nsome amount of time but if you did it\nonce you can do it again and your focus\nshould be on duplicating it and\nespecially in our society we don't focus\non\nthis right but is is there this concept\nthat I was sort of sharing with with\nsapnap about like people have done\nstudies on this not in content creators\nbut like what I'm literally talking\nabout is like I I took a class at my\nfirst class at Harvard Business School\nwas on this class called value based\nHealthcare and what we looked at at was\nthese like there's this place called the\nmartini clinic in Germany so we would do\ncase studies on things that were\nexceptionally successful and try to\nunderstand what is someone who is\nexceptionally successful doing so we'll\ndo this a lot right there's all these\nlike podcast bro kind of circuits which\nwe we've been on and we're grateful like\nwe love that we love that stuff but it's\nkind of like let's talk to successful\npeople about how they're successful the\nchallenge with positive the the\nshortcoming of that is that they are not\nyou right so we can look at like sapnap\nlife and we can say wow I need a group\nof two friends we need to develop our\nown on own vocabulary we need to do all\nthis kind of stuff but the problem is\nthat like y'all don't have sapnap brain\nsapnap brain is very\nspecial he's very logical he can be\nangry for 10 minutes and he's like I'm\ndone with that now let me see if I'm I'm\nanxious tomorrow right so a lot of us\ncan't do that so this is the this is\nwhere positive deviance really comes in\nso there is a problem of this is another\nresearch concept called external\nvalidity the problem with some research\nstudies is that you can have some\nfinding within a research study but when\nyou put it in the real world it doesn't\nwork best example of this or my favorite\nexample is this medication called\nolanzapine so olanzapine is a really\ngood medication for bipolar disorder\nworks really really really well the\nproblem is that despite it being so\neffective for bip poar\ndisorder when you try to give it to\npeople in the real world they don't keep\ntaking it so in this research study\nyou've got like let's say 2,000 people\nand these people are being compensated\nto take this medication so they take\nmedication every day you people checking\non up on them did you take the\nmedication did you not take the\nmedication they track their pills they\ntest their blood levels they test the\nlevel of medication in your blood to\nmake sure you're not lying so when all\nthis stuff is going on people take the\nmedication the problem is in the real in\nin the study and in the real world it\ncauses you to gain 50 pounds sometimes\nin worst case scenarios so what happens\nis that even though this result happened\nwithin a controlled study when you\nextrapolate it to the real world people\ndon't take the\nmedicine this same thing is true when it\ncomes to success so we have all these\npeople who are interviewing very\nsuccessful people like today we talked\nto sapnap who is very successful and we\ntried to figure out what are the secrets\nto your success this is going to have an\nexternal validity problem because his\nSolutions are based on his\nenvironment right there they assume his\nbrain they assume his upbringing they\nassume his Greek Dad they assume that\nyour two best friends are very\nsuccessful content creators who you get\nalong with who you met before you were a\ncontent\ncreator so then there is a problem of\nexternal validity because translating\nwhat he does is not going to work for\nyou 100% so then the answer is then what\ndo I do positive\ndeviant you look at the most successful\nmoments in your life and you duplicate\nthose this is\ncritical right so if yall are struggling\nwith\nsomething how do I make friends the\nanswer is how did you make\nfriends how do I find motivation how did\nyou find\nmotivation but you'll say but I haven't\nhad a friend in 6 years that doesn't\nmatter still 6 years ago what was\ndifferent about you well [ __ ] I wasn't\nlike ground down by this world I was\nmore optimistic I was more authentic I\nwas less ashamed of myself well that's\nreally\ninteresting right because as you become\nthose things again you will make friends\nagain become the person that you\nwere that is how you can harness\npositive deviant\nI see this a lot also in my patients\nwith ADHD where they're like I had this\none week where everything went\nright and then the question isn't how do\nwe fix the bad weeks the question is\nwhat was going on that\nweek how are you sleeping how are you\neating who were you spending time with\nwhat was your\nenvironment right we'll see all kinds of\ndifferent\nthings and so if y'all are stuck\nsomewhere in life two really common\nthings that people do wrong first is\nthey look for a solution to their\nproblems don't look for a solution\noutside of yourself second thing is that\nthey look to other\npeople right there's a difference\nbetween garble those so I'll try that\nagain so the two things that people do\nwrong the first is that they instead of\nthey try to fix their problems instead\nof duplicating their successes so look\nat the times that you have already done\nwell because that assumes your brain\nthat assumes your circumstance you're\nyou so duplicate recreate the best\nversion of yourself don't try to make\nsome hypothetical version and the second\nthing is be careful about the solutions\nto of other\npeople right and if you kind of look at\nthis there's a bazillion channels on the\ninternet telling you this is how to be\nsuccessful we don't tell you how to be\nsuccessful we teach you the principles\nof how you work you decide how to do\nthat right so even now I'm not saying\nI'm teaching youall about the principle\nof positive deviance I'm not saying that\nthis is the one way to apply it right\nthis is a principle and then you have to\ndecide for yourself there may be an\nexternal validity problem here as well\nwhereas you try to do positive deviants\nyou look at yourself and you say there's\nno successes in my life positive\ndeviants wouldn't work for\nme right and then what we need to do is\ngo talk go learn about cognitive bias\ntrauma and all that other good\nstuff right there's other\nproblems so if yall are really\nstruggling Ling it's like crazy but the\nsolution is sitting right in front of\nyou so another really interesting\nprinciple of positive devian is they\nbelieve that in the book they talk about\nhow Innovation is\nunnecessary think about this for a\nsecond they said you don't need to make\nsomething new you never need to innovate\nthe Innovations already exist they just\nneed to be\nduplicated if you have had one great day\nin your life you don't need to solve all\nyour problems all you need to do is\nthink about what led to that day and do\nyour best to recreate the situation and\npractice that over and over and over\nagain and you will find positive deviant\nis very\nsuccessful so we arguably have a\nsuccessful content\ncreation operation right and it is an\noperation there's a 15 people at a\nminimum that are involved it's not just\nme we have a great team here and so\nwe've even learned some things that are\nvery very countering\nintuitive and the reason that we've\nlearned things that are counterintuitive\nfirst of all it's responsible for our\ngrowth and\nsecondly it's like not what the common\nwisdom is and a great example is when\nyou have one Successful video you\nduplicate it a second time third time\nfourth time fifth time right you make\nderivative content we don't like doing\nthat so instead what we try to do and so\nmaybe maybe that's the reason we're less\nsuccessful than we are because we don't\njust make the same [ __ ] over and over\nover again again personally I find it\nboring but what we also found is that\nwhat it is that inspires that best\nvideo is the same thing that you want to\nduplicate the inspiration not the\noutput so even in your own life when\nyou're kind of like looking at positive\ndeviants if you're saying I had a great\nday of motivation right I got so much\ndone what people will try to do is they\nwill duplicate the output they'll say I\nneed to be\ndisciplined because I need to do this\nevery day but you weren't disciplined on\nthat first day you were inspired on that\nfirst day so then what happens I want\nyou to really think about this this is\nhow crazy this is you had one really\nsuccessful day that had nothing to do\nwith discipline and you're like now I\nneed discipline and you're trying to\nrecreate that experience by moving in\nthe exact opposite direction it's crazy\nyou don't need discipline you need a\nduplication of inspiration on a\nconsistent basis that is not\ndiscipline it's the opposite discipline\nis about the absence of\ninspiration and when you you guys may be\nlike wait what what but yeah I want\nyouall like artists are actually really\ngood at this right so when you have an\nartist they sort of really figure out\nlike really successful artists will\nfigure out their process of tapping into\ncreativity and so don't try to create\nyourself into something that you aren't\ninstead recognize that within your 365\ndays of one year there are bright points\nunderstand what was happening during\nthose bright points and duplicate\nthem so many years\nago I went to college and I was so\nexcited I was going to go to college and\nI was going to do so much so I joined a\nfraternity I ran for student government\nright I made a bunch of friends I went\nto a bunch of parties I took Japanese\nand\nSpanish failed them both right we're\ngoing to we're going to do I took a\nphilosophy class I took a chemistry\nclass I was going to like learn\neverything I was going to party a bunch\nI was going to be active in student\ngovernment I was going to do everything\nand then I I none of it worked I didn't\nwin the election I got kicked out I got\nimpeached from one position that I was\nelected\nto failed a bunch of classes\nhad a string of I don't even think you\ncan call them relationships terrible\nexperiences in the fraternity to World\ngreat experiences\ntoo right and it was like and so then my\nmy dad was like you're trying to do too\nmuch you got to do less so I was like\nokay he's like you need to focus on one\nthing and I was like okay fine so then I\ncut out a lot of\nextracurriculars and then my\nfirst semester of my second year I still\ndid really bad so then what I did I was\nlike okay I need to focus more right so\nthen I even took a half course\nload I only took like three classes like\nclasses and then I still didn't do great\nI was like this is not working so first\nI was doing too much then I was doing a\nnormal amount and then I was doing less\nthan a normal amount the results were\nthe same so I go to\nIndia and one person who's uh at one of\nthe monasteries that I'm at who's an\nayurvedic physician hears the story and\nthen he laughs\nand he says this is a terrible idea for\nyou focusing is such a bad idea and I\nsaid' whatat do you mean and he said\nthee way that your personality is you\nget easily excited by things but then\nyou get overly excited and you struggle\nwith follow through so he kind of\nteaches me this this technique which\nI've mentioned a couple of times he's\nlike you need a lot of stimulation the\nmain thing is instead of like doing a\nthousand random things you will get\nbored of thing number one and then you\ngo to thing number two you get bored of\nthing number two then you go to thing\nnumber three when you were bored of\nthing number three don't go to thing\nnumber four you will be interested in\nthing number one\nagain it's like you have a cool down\nlike so this is basically what they he\ntaught me is that inspiration motivation\nand interest have an internal cool down\nand it's like I'm hyped about this and\nthen you have to wait a couple of days\nbefore you can do it again so we all\nhave this different set of cool down and\npeople who are highly disciplined they\nhave a very short cool down so they they\ncan get interested in something or be\ndisciplined or whatever like they their\nstats are different their build is\ndifferent and so what we really want to\ndo what I really learned is that I'm\ngoing to lean into my natural cognitive\nfingerprint I'm going to do a lot of\ndifferent things I'm going to see\npatience I'm going to make content I'm\ngoing to do some writing I'm going to go\ngive a talk I'm going to run a workshop\nI'm going to do some\nteaching I'm going to consult\nall right we're going to do something\nthat we have been done some of before\nbut we're going to do it more hopefully\nnext week stay tuned to our socials and\ny'all will\nsee right we're going to try to do a lot\nof different things this is positive\ndeviance lean into the person that you\nare instead of trying to become someone\nelse and what you will find is the big\ndifference between me back then and me\nnow is just understanding how the\ninstrument works right so this pen can't\nwrite anything no matter how hard I try\nuntil I click this one button and once I\nclick this button all of the same effort\nnow produces without clicking this\nbutton all of the effort produces\nnothing the instrument is the same and\nif you learn how to use it if you learn\nwhat this button is the big difference\nbetween old Dr K and now Dr K that was\nall o and now Dr K still all o still the\nsame pen I just learned how to click cck\none\nbutton and if you want to know what that\nbutton is for you positive deviance is\nthe\nanswer from 1 to 10 how disciplined of a\nperson I am I would give\nmyself realistically I would answer\nprobably like a six but in my heart of\nhearts I think it's a four like I'm\nhonestly like a four\nbut I don't think you can I think the\noutcomes that I've achieved are not\nconsistent with a rating of four so I'd\nsay it's probably a\nsix you did med school with a four\nyou're damn right I\ndid so this is this is like one of our\nyou know one of our we I did a lecture\nabout this a while ago so like I had all\nthese friends who would like study a lot\nand I was like I can't do that I wasn't\ndisciplined enough so I studied 2 hours\na day in med school that's it like\npeople were putting in like eight hours\na day and I was like I can't do that I\ntried for a little while didn't go well\nso it took me a while I did the same\nthing so it's interesting I didn't get\num I ended up getting like two Awards in\nmed school but you know when I didn't I\ndidn't get like the Honor Society\nbecause early on in in med school when I\nstarted my third year I didn't know how\nto function on the wards so when I was\ndoing clinical work like I ended up\nreally strong and then you know did good\nin residency and all that kind of stuff\nbut it took me a while because I tried\nto do what everybody else was\ndoing and it took me a while to really\nunderstand like what it means like how\nto bring the best out of myself and I\nsaw everyone around me working really\nhard that's not what worked for me I\nwasn't disciplined I focused on\ninspiration how can I get interested in\nthis person how can I get interested in\nthis person how can I get interested in\nthis person\nwhat am I naturally interested in this\nis also how so when I went to med school\nI was planning on becom becoming an\noncologist cancer doctor so first three\nand a half years were all geared towards\nbecoming a cancer doctor I did research\nin Internal Medicine like did a bunch of\nstuff that was related to like this\ndifferent path so what happened is I\nrealized that's not what I enjoy that's\nnot what inspires me that sitting in\nfront of a computer for 12 hours a day\nwas not something I found enjoyable\ntalking to people was right leaning into\ninspiration and so understand that you\nare a completely unique organism and you\nthink oh I wish I was this way I wish I\nwas this way I wish I was this way and\nsure like over time you can grow and\nchange fine but the fundamentals of who\nyou are is not something that you should\nchange it's very difficult to change and\nit's not worth it to\nchange right this is like someone like\nso half of y'all are like y'all are\narchers that are walking in to\nmelee right you're like my DPS sucks and\nit's like yeah that's because you're\nmeleeing with a bow you should be\nshooting an\narrow right so much effort for so little\nyield and what I see in this community\nis a ton of inefficiency it's not a lack\nof\ndiscipline it's not even a lack of\nmotivation it is a a community of people\nwho are pushing themselves to be what\nthey not\nburnout right it's like start leaning\ninto the person that you\nare and there's a whole different issue\nof if you have a false perception or\nwhat you think is a correct perception\nof yourself right like that that needs\nto be worked on too that's why we build\nsome of the resources that we build even\nthings like the trauma guide which is\nout now by the way\nis all about developing identity and how\nyou can shape your identity how you can\nsee yourself as you are we also have\nstuff in there like what sapnap was\ntalking about about you know he's like\n10 minutes later I'm Not Angry Anymore\nso we have a lot of stuff in there about\nemotional re regulation and emotional\nrewiring right so we've sort of figured\nout a lot of these like things or what\nwe think is successful right it's my\nopinion on what's successful I've seen a\nlot of clinical efficacy of this\nstuff we've seen this in our community\nwith some of these community events like\nright in the\nfields right and then the more of this\nthat we do like the better off it is for\npeople so if yall are interested in some\nof these aspects we have a lot of\nresources but I mean I think it's a real\ntragedy right because you are you you're\na unique character you've got a\ncharacter sheet you've got your stats\nyou've got your background lean into\nthat and it's like a great example last\nexample I'll share with youall which\nsomething I talk about a lot right so\nlike here I'm very open about how much I\nsuck at things like I failed a lot and I\nended up doing\nokay and so there was a time in my life\nwhere I wished I had not\nfailed I was like man I've got like the\nsecond year I was applying to the third\nyear I Was preparing my applications for\nmed school I was like if only I did not\nhave a 2.5\nGPA if only I I had a 4.0 I regretted\nand I wished I was someone else I wished\nI had a past that was\ndifferent but now it's like this is what\nallows me to talk to y'all right so if I\nwas one of the 4.0 kids\nlike I'm not one of us like we're not\nthe 4.0 kids maybe some of y'all are I\nmake assumptions about who our community\nis our community has grown so much and\nwe have so many people who are just at\nthe top of their game and y'all are\nwelcome here\ntoo right they struggle as well but we\nhave people who are you know Developers\nat Fang companies and CEOs and and all\nkinds of other you know very very\nsuccessful people who are very driven\nthat's us too we're all of the\nabove right and that's the point is like\nit's not like the the the winners and\nthe losers are two groups of people\nwe're all the same and it's just\nlearning about yourself is ultimately\nwhat's going to help you become more\nsuccessful so I I work with people who\nare 25 years old and like you know at\nhome and don't have a job and stuff like\nthat and I work with people who are very\nsuccessful it's all the same just learn\nabout yourself that's how you're going\nto\nimprove\nokay as a highly creative person I'm a\ncopywriter I found that I cannot create\nstructure for my work any tips\nabsolutely so structure is frequently\nabout so I would say that you can first\nof all apply positive deviant so look at\nthe times in which you have been\nsuccessful at writing and try to\nunderstand what were you doing at those\ntimes the second thing is that being a\ncopywriter and creating structure is\nvery difficult so a lot of times there\nare these jobs that can be done at any\ntime and if you have a job that is done\nat any time it is very difficult to make\nstructure so if you look at it you may\nthink oh I'm worse at making structure\nthan the people around me that's not\ntrue we're all equally bad the big\ndifference is that half of us have a job\nthat creates structure for us and in\nfact if you look at our society we\nactually induce atrophy of\norganizational skills in the society we\nlive in\ntoday we don't teach people how to make\nstructure we make it for them we don't\ntell people to climb the stairs we tell\nthem to take the elevator school starts\nat a particular time ends at a\nparticular time you have a syllabus\nyou're told exactly what is on the test\nyou're given all the materials to study\nfor the\ntest everything is laid out for you\nthere's a format for resumés there's\nthis number of jobs you have a career\ncenter we have so many different\nresources that do not teach us how to\nstructure Our Lives they do the opposite\nthey structure for\nus and if you have the double-edged\nsword of an overly involved parent\nwho's not willing to let you make\nmistakes and does all the work for you\nthey've infantilized you even\nfurther so if you're a copywriter if\nyou're a freelancer if you're a\nprogrammer if you're a writer if your\njob is to produce something as opposed\nto be\nsomewhere see being a doctor is not\nabout producing somewhere it's about\nshowing\nup my call shift starts at 6:00 p.m. on\na Friday it ends at 8:00 a.m. on a\nSaturday my job is to show up\nup and a society me looks at me as very\nproductive because basically what I have\nto do is show up but if you're a job if\nyou have a job that involves producing\nsomething structure is very\ndifficult so first tip is\nenvironment a different location will\ngive you a different desire to\nwork so I even recently I was on a trip\nI use public libraries a lot\nI've always used public libraries loved\nit so I will go to the library and do my\nwork there it is easier to not get\ndistracted at a public\nlibrary so depending on where you live\nthat may or may not be an option even\nwhen I was in med school this is crazy I\ndidn't really I didn't have too much\nmoney so I had I didn't even have a\ngaming computer so I had a old\nlaptop and the laptop I I didn't even\nwant a gaming computer because then I\nwould get distracted with games so still\nplayed games on the laptop I used to\nplay Heroes of Might magic 3 which can\nrun on you know not even a potato PC\nlike a potato skin PC you don't even\nneed the full\npotato and so what I would do is is I\nhad two desks and I would pick up the\nlaptop and I would move it over there\nand this was my gaming desk this was my\nworking\ndesk so I would have separate spaces in\nmy tiny little I had like a sleeping bag\nI slept on the floor I didn't have any\nfurniture I had two desks and a dresser\nno chairs no\ntables and so like that was it no sofas\nno couches no TV nothing like that so\neverything happened on my entertainment\nlaptop happened over there and I would\njust shift the laptop that helped a lot\nso when I'm done with my work I get to\nmove the laptop things are way harder\nfor y'all now because now we have\neverything on the phone and the phone is\nyour source of entertainment it's your\nsource of socialization and it's your\nsource of work so environment is number\none\nan environment also means your digital\nenvironment so for example like\nsometimes I'll advocate for the use of\ndifferent logins on your computer or\neven I do this thing where the fun apps\nare not\nin are not easily accessible so I have\nto open up the app the list of apps I\nhave to scroll through all of my apps to\nopen up a fun\napp so you can there's digital\nenvironment too is very\nimportant second thing that's very\nimportant if you have an unstructured\nlife is to try to pair up with other\npeople who are unstructured to create\nstructure this is why if you look at\nsome of these Traditions like being an\nauthor authors thrive in writing groups\nmany of them and why it's because you\ndon't have to write a chapter of the\nbook a\nday like you don't have to you can write\ntwo tomorrow and then you can write\nthree the next day and then you can\nwrite four the next day and now you're\nso far behind you can't write four in a\nday now I'm going to beat myself\nup and so what do I how do I manage\nthose emotions I waste more\ntime so environment in terms of\nphysicality environment in terms of\npeople right this is very important\noften times people who are have their\njob as a product require some an\nexternal swift kick in the ass to get\nyou\ngoing right you need someone to tell you\nhey I need this in I needed it a week\nago if you don't get into me by end of\nday you're [ __ ] fired that's what you\nrely on to get stuff done is like\ndeadlines and\nconsequences so try to create external\ninputs it's not that you need the\ndeadline or the consequence any kind of\nexternal signal will trigger your your\nmotivation you're externally motivated\nthat's actually\nokay so all you need is more external\ntriggers and that comes from environment\nand\nCommunity the last thing that I would\nrecommend is that you really focus on\nyour morning routine so often times we\nreally screw ourselves up by any kind of\ndelay in the morning something as simple\nas hopping on your phone for five\nminutes really screws you\nup and if yall want to understand this\nit has to do with our dopamine circuitry\nso let's talk about this real\nquick\nokay there's something that people don't\nunderstand about\ndopamine so give me a second and then\nwe'll wrap up this is a great\nquestion\nno there we\ngo something that people don't entirely\nunderstand about dopamine so everyone's\nlike oh my God like we need to stop\ndoing we need a dopamine detox and we\nneed to do this okay let's talk about\ndopamine for a second so this is what I\nwant yall to understand so when you wake\nup in the\nmorning you\nhave a reserve of\ndopamine okay now let's understand what\ndopamine is\ndopamine in the nucleus accumbens does\nthree things first thing it does is it\ngives us\npleasure second thing it does is\nreinforce the\nbehavior third thing is it does is it\ncreates a\ncraving so all three of these are these\nare the three outputs of dopamine one\nsignal of dopamine creates all three of\nthese effects you cannot untangle\nthese so now what happens is we have\ndifferent things\nthat will release different amounts of\ndopamine so let's say I do\ncocaine I inject cocaine or I snort\ncocaine so what this does the signal of\ncocaine is very powerful so I get a\nsuper tight\nsqueeze I'm squeezing all of my dopamine\ncircuits and if I get a super tight\nsqueeze I empty out a lot of dopamine so\nall my dopamine gets squeezed out and is\nout of here so I get this burst of\ndopamine now what does dopamine do now I\nhave a huge dopamine signal so what does\nthis do to these three\nthings we get intense pleasure intense\nreinforcement of the behavior and\nintense craving this is why people get\naddicted to cocaine now if we look at\nsomething like video games\nvideo games are not quite as addictive\nas cocaine so what that means is that I\nget only this amount of dopamine\nout so instead of three let's make it\ntwo right so I get a little bit less dop\nme and out I have some\nleft okay so this is not quite as\naddictive now here's the key thing to\nunderstand now the more that I squeeze\nout the more empty it is right so what\nthis also means is that after I play\nvideo games if I try to do work there's\nvery little dopamine\nleft so now I do a bunch of work and you\nknow work is rewarding right but it's\nnot very rewarding so it's just a tiny\nlittle squeeze and since most of the\ndopamine is empty I've already emptied\nit out through video games I get very\nlittle do signal and then I get a tiny\nlittle not even a full Arrow so my work\nfeels less rewarding I do not reinforce\nthe behavior of work and I do not crave\nI do not want to work tomorrow because\nthe dopamine signal is\nTiny now here's the main thing to\nunderstand if I wake up first thing in\nthe morning and I get to work my\ndopamine stores are\nfull which means even with a tiny little\nsqueeze I can still get a relatively\nlarge signal because everything is full\nso the analogy that I like to use is\nthink about a\nlemon when a lemon is fresh a small\nsqueeze gets you a lot of juice so if I\nwork first thing in the morning I get a\nsolid Arrow I get more pleasure I get\nmore reinforcement and I get more\ncraving for work I get more of reward\nand then the beautiful thing is if I\nplay video games let's say I work\nanother\nhour now I'm going to get rid of this\nright so\nnow I've used up this much\ndopamine now I play a video game so\nhere's the coolest\npart when you play a video game now\nremember that the video game squeezes\nharder and so even if you play a video\ngame\nafterward The Squeeze is so solid that\nyou get plenty of dopamine\nover here to go to enjoy\ngaming\nokay so this is why you should like\npeople get so\nconfused and they're like I don't\nunderstand like how do how can I enjoy\nmy work as much as I enjoy my gaming and\nthis is all you have to do is do the\nwork\nfirst so if you want to live literally\nenjoy the work do the work first because\nthen you'll get some degree of reward\nthat'll give you pleasure and it will\nmake you want to work again and if you\nall have done this you know exactly what\nI'm talking about because there chances\nare there are times in your life where\nyou wake up one day and you're super\nproductive and you're like damn son I\nfeel\ngood I want to do this tomorrow I want\nto have another productive day we all\nwant productive days think about how\ndoes that work neuroscientifically it's\nbecause on that productive day you\nactually get a dopamine\nrush now if we squeeze all of so the the\nwhen we wake up in the morning our lemon\nis full so a small squeeze like doing\nsomething not very fun like work still\ngets pleasure craving and behavioral\nreinforcement and then even though\nthere's not much juice left in the lemon\nif I do a dopam energic activity like\nplay a video game now I'm squeezing hard\nand there's enough juice for me to enjoy\nmyself\nnow for those of you who work to the\npoint to burnout what you will find is\nthat even video games are not fun\nbecause everything is empty so even\nsqueezing really hard and playing some\nvery addictive video game just doesn't\nfeel fun nothing left and by the way\nthis is also why games get less fun over\ntime so when I first play for the first\nhour it's so much fun second hour third\nhour fourth hour I'm running out of\njuice and the\nlemon so the biggest mistake that we\nmake is we do high dopam activities\nfirst and then we have nothing left in\nthe tank for when we sit down to work\nflip it around it'll make a world of\ndifference you don't want to detox off\nof dopamine you want to utilize dopamine\neveryone's like oh I don't dopamine's\nbad dopam what the [ __ ] dopamine is your\nsource of Behavioral reinforcement and\ncraving we want to utilize those to\ncreate our motivation dopamine is such a\nstrong motivator\nthe problem is that we're engaging in\nbehaviors that are literally creating\nreinforcement behavioral reinforcement\nand Cravings in the wrong direction and\nthen we struggle because this work is\nnot fun because every time I do it I'm\nout of dopamine so there's no\nreinforcement and games are fun because\nthere's a ton of reinforcement and like\nwe're literally shaping our brain to\nmove in this direction instead of moving\nthis direction because we don't\nunderstand how our brain works\nso if you are someone who is a\nfreelancer do not do anything dope and\nenergic until you work for a couple of\nhours come hell or high water it is not\njust about today understand this\nmechanism understand that if you do that\nyou are making things exponentially\nharder for yourself tomorrow the next\nday and for the next\nweek it's not just 15 minutes on your\nphone before you get started it is 15\nminutes today an increase in craving\ntomorrow less reward from your work\ntoday more difficulty with motivation\ntoday that's the real price of even 15\nminutes on your\nphone because then what happens is as we\nempty our lemon in order to get what we\nneed we have to do high squeezes now the\nlemon is empty so now I need to play\nvideo games now I need to watch\npornography now I need to use drugs\nso the only way that you can feel\nsomething is by like doing extreme\nthings and then people will say I don't\nenjoy reading books I've never enjoyed\nreading books I can't enjoy reading\nbooks anymore it's because the dopam\nenergic squeeze is less but it feels\nreally good to finish a\nbook and if you've really fallen into a\nbook and you finish it man you want to\nread another one it's interesting how it\nworks right if you pay attention to your\nlife you will find that all these things\nare true and if they're not then I'm\nwrong or you're different one of the two\nwhich is still useful\ninformation\nokay I also use medical cannabis for\ncreativity as a video at or it's\nbeneficial to be overwhelmed by my work\nso I'm completely empathetic to your\nsituation as a cop CER yeah so like\nwe'll see all this right where people\nwill start using different kinds of\nsubstances to\nalter their function it brings out the\nbest in them caffeine is number\none so caffeine becomes more and more\nuseful the the more insomnia you\nhave right so this is something that we\nreally have to understand about\nsubstances is that there's a risk\nbenefit we'll also use medical cannabis\nso we'll prescribe these things right I\nwill prescribe things like opiate\nmedications and stuff like that even\ncannabis there are times that that\nwarrant for it but this is very\nimportant to understand the substances\nare generally speaking not the\nideal if you like when do we prescribe\nsleep medication when someone struggles\nwith insomnia they're not the right\nanswer is fixing the insomnia the right\nanswer is getting a good night's sleep\nthat's the best antidote to\ncaffeine so a lot of these interventions\nare can be very useful so like my\nfavorite I think the one of the best\noutcomes for medical cannabis is in\nreducing opioid dependence when someone\nis so dependent on opioids giving them\ncannabis has been shown to reduce their\nopioid burden seems like a really good\nmove because very high dose opioids are\nhave all kinds of\nproblems so there are good reasons to\nuse some of this\nstuff but there's a big difference\nbetween what compensates for\nunhealthiness today that moves you in\nthe right\ndirection and what is healthy right so\nif like if this is the Spectrum let's\nsay this is positive 100 this is\nnegative 100 so if I'm over here and I\nmove this way that's like positive right\nso that's good but then what gets me\nfrom here to here may not get me from\nhere to here so sometimes especially if\nwe look at things like like psychoactive\nsubstances they're really good at\nhelping with pathology but then if you\nuse them like let's say cannabis as an\nexample so cannabis may be useful at\nreducing your opioid dependence but if\nyou're super super functional and you\nstart using cannabis you could lose\nground the same is true for things like\nssris it depends on the person right so\nI think in general cannabis is worse\nthat way but the sorise but jury's out\non that one right there a lot of people\nlike Mark Horowitz is very anti-\nSSRI so like fair enough there's a lot\nof we don't have a clear answer on\nwhat's right and what's\nwrong right but there's a big difference\nbetween using a\ncrutch and like it's like a crutch will\nhelp you if you have a broken leg but\nit's going to slow you down if you're\nhealthy and that's what we see with a\nlot of psychoactive\nsubstances so you know I think it makes\nsense that people use them and at the\nsame time recognize that what moves you\nfrom 100 to z may be a different thing\nfrom what moves you from 0 to\n100 so thank you all very much for you\nknow posting\nin right so someone's saying yeah\nmedical cannabis for OCD like I I\nhaven't seen studies on that\nspecifically but makes\nsense um\nso what about going for a walk so\ngenerally speaking I think going for a\nwalk is really good so we're not saying\nthat you shouldn't get any stimulation\nbut youall have to understand there's a\nbig difference between like the dopamine\ndeath\ngrip of things like short form content\non the\ninternet and like cat videos and like\nagage bait there's a big difference\nbetween that and going for a walk so if\nyou look specifically at going for a\nwalk going for a walk can be very\nhealthy so let's just like talk about a\ncouple of these things so the first is\nthat going for a walk improves cerebral\nblood flow so this is interesting but\nwhen I was in med school they said that\nthe calves right our calf muscles are\nconsidered the second\nheart and why it's because the heart is\nresponsible for pumping blood and the\nsecond most important muscle the hardest\nmuscle the second most important muscle\nfor pumping blood is your calves so\nevery time you this is a beautiful how\nthe body is\ndesigned so we have these things called\nveins and veins tend to be a low\npressure system which causes blood to\npool okay so this is why if you have\nlike a risk of clotting you'll get these\nthings called deep vein thrombosis in\nyour legs when you go on\nflights because the blood p pools in\nyour lower extremities so when the blood\npools in your lower extremity it\nincreases your risk of clot not really a\nproblem if you're young and healthy but\nas you get older and depending on your\nmedical conditions you have to be\ncareful about that so what we tell\npeople to do is make sure you walk\naround when you're on a plane or or flex\nyour muscles or whatever because the\nblood pools down there because of\ngravity so what is it that causes blood\nto push up your calf muscles so every\ntime your calf muscle contracts inside\nis a vein full of blood and it pushes\nthe blood back\nup so walking is very good for cerebral\nblood blood flow blood flow in\ngeneral right so once your blood starts\nmoving you clear things out you like\nwill also like do things to your\nlymphatic flow and like all kinds of\nstuff\nchanges the second thing that's really\ngood about a walk is that often times\nwhen we walk we have idle time in our\nmind and then idle time in the mind is\nvery important so our brain is has\nevolved with idle time so it utilizes\nthe idle time very productively when the\nbrain is like okay we're not thinking\nabout anything right now we're not doing\nanything right now what we'll find is it\ndoes things like subconscious emotional\nprocessing you will work through things\nin your mind it's not even conscious\nyou'll think about this you'll think\nabout that oh I have to do this oh I\nhave to do this it just kind of calms\nyou down a little bit also activates\nyour physiology in a different kind of\nway so walk can be very\ngood now if you're in a a city that's\nvery loud and stuff I'm not quite sure\nabout that so I don't know depending on\nwho you are what your personal\npreferences are how stimulating the city\nis there may be like a net positive or\nnet negative I'm not quite sure but\ngenerally speaking walking is very\ngood so often times my personal like\napproach to things is I'll get to work\nlike right away and then around 10 or 11\nlike after two to three hours of work I\nwill go for a\nwalk so I'll try to use a walk to kind\nof consolidate my\nmemory so like once I have some stuff to\nlike think through then I'll like\nconsolidate so as an example before I\ngive a lecture and before I stream I try\nto take a walk so literally what I'll do\nis I'll like go through all my research\nand I'll I'll look at my notes and I'll\nwrite things out and stuff like that and\nthen I go through go for a walk and then\nI think through the lecture in my head\nso it's a way of repeat like basically\nrepetition and\nreinforcement so walking idle time in\nthe brain is very\nimportant great\nquestions great\ncomments if you haven't used any\nsubstances and don't need them\ngreat does it matter to walk with music\nor just to be in my own thought so I\nrecommend walking without any external\nstimulus so I do not recommend podcasts\nor music or things like that your\nmileage may vary so some people have\nbrains that music can be quite calming\nand it helps them think actually more\nclearly if your brain is like that then\ngo for it so some amount of\nexperimentation but I tend to find that\njust really letting my thoughts run wild\nis really good\nokay this is a great question what do I\ndo after I get rejected do I just leave\nor do I keep\ntalking so see we're going to touch on\nthis real quick and then we got to we\ngot to go but see when we think about\nrejection the the first thing you got to\ndo is be a little bit less black and\nwhite so often times there's like a\ncouple of like the answer is like I I I\ndon't I think the problem we often times\nmake in life is that we create a false\ndichotomy where we think it's either\nthis or this after rejection do I\nstay and keep talking or do I just\nleave so there are so\nmany problems with this Construction I'm\nnot saying that this person is is wrong\nto think this way but I'm just if you're\nsomeone who's in this situation where\nyou got rejected and you're like what do\nI do take a step back take a deep breath\nfirst of all recognize what is the\nnature of your\nrejection because often times if you\nlook at people who have been rejected or\nif you have someone in your life that\nyou have\nrejected there's often times a lot more\nNuance coming from you but the other\nperson is like okay fine you don't want\nme to come to your birthday party I'll\nnever talk to you\nagain and it's like no I didn't say\nthat right it's just that there is some\nconcerns that I have or whatever so\nyou'll see this a lot if you've got like\nparents who are narcissistic or\nborderline like they perceive things as\nrejection so I'm not saying that you\nweren't rejected you can absolutely be\nrejected but be a little bit careful at\nleast get into the habit of being\ncritical of your perception of\nrejection now people will rebel against\nthis be like no I like this is what\nhappened like the person said no [ __ ]\nyou what what do you mean like I I\ndefinitely got rejected fair enough in\nthis particular case but let's think\nthis through for a second in this\nparticular case you're right but imagine\na scenario in which you perceive a\nrejection and there isn't a\nrejection imagine what your life is\nlike imag imagine how it would be\ndifferent if half of the rejections that\nyou perceive don't really\nexist and you're living in this world of\nmanufactured\nrejection now I mean I'm sure that the\nrejections are real to a certain extent\nI'm not saying that you're wrong because\nI have no idea who you are or what your\nsituation is all I'm pointing out is\nthat being critical of your perceptions\nespecially your negative emotional\nperceptions is incredibly\nvaluable I'm ashamed of myself well\nlet's be critical of that I'm worried\nabout this thing happening just because\nyou're worried about it happening\ndoesn't mean that it is going to happen\nor that the Doomsday scenario your\nmanufacturing is reliable or like likely\nyouall understand that so we want to be\ncritical of our negative perceptions I'm\nso pissed because this person is so\nmean and we know that negative emotions\ncan be triggered inappropriately based\non things like traumatic experiences in\nour\npast so literally if we look at\nevidence-based interventions for\nnegative emotion questioning your\nperception is a huge part of it so the\nfirst thing is if you've been rejected\nhold on a second let's really think\nthrough how hard you got\nrejected it's a skill to level up even\nif you're right in this case the second\nthing is it's not either\nor right so what we want to do is try to\ncome up with at least one option C we're\nnot trying trying to tell you that you\nhave to do option C but come up with at\nleast a third thing and often times what\nyou find is black and white thinking is\ndriven by\nemotion so things feel more black and\nwhite when when you're emotionally\nactive like do I stay W this hair is\nreally okay we good now\nokay is really kind of black and white\nthinking is driven by negative emotion\ndo I keep talking well like I would say\nlike you know I I don't know if you\nshould keep talking if you got rejected\nI would say probably not but you also\ndon't have to\nleave right hey I understand that this\nis not really moving in a romantic\nDirection I'm interested in meeting new\npeople can you introduce me to some of\nyour\nfriends why don't you do\nthat right why does it have to be one or\nthe other well it hurts to see them fair\nenough so if like if continued exposure\nto them is toxic for you if you can't\nmove past it then don't talk to them\nagain f say hey I need some\ntime you know start glazing for somebody\nelse and then say hey I'm thank you for\nthe time I'd love to reconnect as\nfriends but now that your heart is with\nanother you're back to you know you're\ngolden\nagain right so so you you don't have to\nremove them from your life feelings can\ncome and they can go you have to decide\nkind of what's right for you but I don't\nthink based on the rejection you I don't\nthink you should keep trying first of\nall but like you don't have to leave\nright there's like all kinds of neutral\npositions that you can adopt and\nsometimes those are not good to do fair\nenough but like don't default towards\none or the other right so too often what\nwhat what happens in life is when we get\nrejected we're like do I fight For Love\nor do I [ __ ] leave and then you leave\nand I think the problem with this is not\nin that particular situation but look at\nhow reactionary your life is like you\nhave to be able to walk a middle path\nlike life is great when you can walk a\nmiddle path it's not it's very turbulent\nif you're walking in extremes All or\nNothing All or Nothing All or\nNothing right so be able to walk a\nmiddle path that that is a skill that is\nvery\nuseful I had a bad thing at happened at\nwork should I quit or should I try to\nmake it work well just chill a little\nbit right have rotations of the or give\nit a shot everything isn't over yet so\nbe careful about that\nand so if we look at some of these\nphilosophies like stoicism or Vaga from\nyoga these are about Detachment they're\nabout neutrality they're about not\noverreacting to things and sort of\nstaying\nbalanced and so that's what I would\nadvocate for more than anything else and\nonce you operate from a balanced place\nthen you can make a decision you can\nobjectively decide you know what having\nthis person in my life is not good for\nmy\nmental this has nothing to do with the\nrejection they can accept you and they\ncan still be bad for you right so you\nwant to be operating from a balanced\nperspective not one where you're you're\noh my God you're like into it or you're\nnot into it based on what they do what\nthat sort of means is that you are\nliving your life reactively if they say\nyes you're there and if they say no\nyou're\ngone right there's a certain\npracticality you can't date someone\nwithout their con but like in general\njust be careful about what I'm asking\nyou all to do is really think about the\npattern of your\nthinking and how this is a really good\nexample of like something that we do in\nother parts of our life too with jobs\nwith friends with parents with getting\ninvited to this not getting invited to\nthis in video games oh my God my mid fed\nis 0 and2 the game is [ __ ] over black\nand white\nthinking right so not every reject has\nto be so\ndrastic like I remember like I I was\n[ __ ] dumb back in the day and so you\nknow I asked this girl if she wanted to\ngo to a party and she was like I have a\nboyfriend and then I was like\ncool do you want to invite him he's more\nthan\nwelcome you know it's like it doesn't\nhave to be like oh you know like that's\ncool I'd love to meet the guy easy\nright and they're like oh I'm like if\nyou ask someone on a date they're like\nI'm not interested in a relationship\nright now totally\ncool are you interested in hanging out\nas friends totally\nfine or you know I I do find you\nattractive so if at some point that\nchanges like hit me\nup you okay if I ping you like in a\ncouple of weeks\nhow do you want to play this it's like\nyeah no I think I just need to like be\nby myself for a little while totally\ncool get\nit I hope whatever you're going through\nends up working out and I wish you all\nthe best fine right but you don't have\nto default to like responsive like your\ndefault\nreactions does that make\nsense oh my God kit Boger\nraid welcome everybody we're just\nwrapping up but that's awful that we're\nwrapping up and y'all just showed up so\nI think what we're going to have to do\nis raid somebody else but I think just\nto make things fair to y'all because\ny'all just got punted around let's ask\nuh we're going to take two questions\nfrom kitboga Raiders no no no we we got\nto we got to do youall\njustice so if you a kitboga Raider you\nget to ask two questions or y'all is a\ncollective group\nget to ask\nquestions we can't just abandon you\nafter showing\nup oh\nno guby Dr K thanks for mailing me your\nbook if you are who you think you who I\nthink you are I hope you enjoyed the\ninscription um\nokay we got to we got to we're going to\ndo more than two we're going to do three\nso question number one is how are you\ndoing I'm doing well but I'm a little\nbit tired and a little bit hungry and\nthen question number two is ever heard\nof up\ndog no what's up dog\nof course kitboga Raiders are going to\nget\nme\nokay the the description still holds so\ngood okay um when is giving up/ asking\nfor help acceptable what okay so here's\nthis question is crazy we're going to\nanswer this when is giving up SL asking\nfor help\nacceptable first of all giving up and\nasking for help should not be a\nslash right that that's not the same\nthing okay that's not the same thing at\nall so problem number one is if you\nthink giving up and asking for help or\nsynonymous this needs to be\nchanged asking for help is completely\nacceptable before you start\nwhile you are doing it when you are\nhaving trouble or even after it's done\nsuccessfully asking for help is viable\nin all four\nscenarios you should absolutely ask for\nhelp before you get\nstarted you can also ask for help to\noptimize things along the way you can\neven ask for help after you were\nsuccessful hey can you give me some\nfeedback this is what I thought went\nwell this is something that I struggled\nwith can you help me with these things\nright so asking for help should be a\nnormal part of your day now if that's\nhard for you because you're struggling\nwith a lot of shame or\nyou've been punished for asking for help\nso most of the time the reason that it's\nhard for people to ask for help is\nbecause we get punished for asking for\nhelp and if that's been your experience\nmy condolences to you we have a whole\ntrauma guide about rewiring all that\ncrap so check that out so that can\nsometimes happen so just notice that the\nthe the quick answer is just not notice\nthat I feel ashamed asking for help and\nnotice that shame that does not mean so\nthis is the key thing about Shame Shame\nis is a collection of thoughts and\nfeelings in the mind it is not a\nreality right just because you feel\nashamed from something doesn't mean that\nsomething is\nshameful so really good examples of this\nare like you know sometimes when you\nlook at people who have been assaulted\nthey will feel ashamed of themselves\nbut it's not your\nfault right\nusually so just because our mind\nproduces something doesn't mean that\nit's correct now when should you give\nup when you decide it's a good\nidea so see a lot of times giving up is\nemotional what's even worse is not\ngiving up is\nemotional so everyone talks about oh my\nGod if you give up you're a\nloser I've seen more psychological\nDamage Done by people who refuse to give\nup than people who give up that may not\neven be true but that's what it feels\nlike in this moment I'm just thinking\nabout so many patients that I've seen\nthat refuse to give\nup and it's like I don't want to be a\nloser and losers give up so I'm going to\npursue this stupid thing I'm going to\ninvest way too much energy in a toxic\nrelationship because the idea of being a\nquitter I don't want to be a quitter so\nI'm going to keep persisting in a bad\nstrategy so if yall are struggling to\nfigure out should I give up or not so\nI'd say the first thing is ask for help\neven in figuring out whether you should\ngive up always ask for\nhelp always a good thing almost always a\ngood\nthing there are some extreme scenarios\nwhere asking for help can be like a\nconsequence of stuff like um I don't\nknow like uh\nlet me\nthink right so if you become like very\ndependent on\nsomeone or you have severe confidence\nissues and you need to learn how to like\ndo things on your own or you lack faith\nin yourself and you don't need help so\nthere are like dependent scenarios where\nasking for help is not ideal but\ngenerally speaking it's\ngood now in terms of when to give up\nwhen your mind is\nclear and you analyze the situation and\nthen you decide\nso a clear mind then the question\nbecomes how do you achieve a clear mind\nthe first thing is spend time with\nyourself spend time in nature so get out\ndon't spend time on your phone that's\nnot real thinking so I would even take a\nwhole day if you can or a couple of\nhours I get a lot of clarity through\nSolitude and your mind give your time\nmind time to process second thing is\nmorning is wiser than\nevening so if you're trying to make a\ndecision this is something that I first\nread in it's it's something from Russian\nfairy tales where they always say like\nin vasilisa fairy tales they'll say that\nyou know morning is wiser than evening\nwhich I find to be true I read it in a\nfairy tale I don't know what the science\nof it is there's all kinds of stuff with\ncortisol and circadian rhythm there's\nprobably something now that I think\nabout it there's probably something with\na lot of emotional processing and memory\nconsolidation that happens in sleep\ngenerally speaking we wake up feeling\nfresh not always sometimes we wake up\nwith our mile our minds A Thousand Miles\na\nminute different\nmechanism so try to spend some time by\nyourself go to sleep wake up and look at\nthe\nsituation and on\nbalance try to decide if this is a good\nidea or a bad idea and there are a\ncouple of techniques here that can\nreally\nhelp the first is if you're trying to\ndecide if you should give up or not one\nof the things that you need to do is\naccept the consequences either way so\nwhat makes it hard to give up and what\nmakes it easy to give up so if you give\nup too much what's the problem if you\ndon't give up enough what's the problem\nif you stay in things too long what's\nthe problem the problem is actually the\nsame in both cases the problem is\navoidance of a\nconsequence if I quit this bad thing\nwill happen so I'm going to stay over\nhere if I don't quit\nthis bad thing will happen so I need to\nquit so in both cases quitting or not\nquitting is avoidance of a consequence\nand then what ends up happening is as\nyou decide not to quit you suffer more\nand you're like maybe I should quit but\nthen as you think about quitting oh I\ndon't know if I'm ever going to find\nsomeone again I don't know what I'm\ngoing to do at the job market I don't\nknow and so you try to avoid that\nconsequence so if you really look at\nyour experience of life if you're stuck\naround giving up it is always running\naway from a bad thing and then you run\naway from this bad thing towards this\nbad thing and you're like this is sucks\nthen you run over here and you're like\nthis sucks and then you pingpong between\ntwo negatives you're trying to run away\nfrom a negative and you're running\nstraight towards a\nnegative so the way to break out of that\ncycle is accept either one or both say\nhey if I break up there's a chance that\nI will be alone for some amount of time\nincluding the rest of my life can I\naccept\nthat if I stay in this relationship it's\nnot clear to me that things will get\nbetter this person has certain toxic\nbehaviors I have certain toxic behaviors\nif I stay in this relationship there's a\nchance that things will continue to go\nbad but I can work towards improving\nthings in both scenarios what you really\nwant to do is accept that negative\nconsequence ahead of\ntime right so leaving a relationship is\nabout\ngrief you have to grieve the loss of\nthat relationship what is grief it's\nacceptance of the\nnegative once you accept the worst worst\ncase scenario and you do it with eyes\nwide open then you're mentally prepared\nfor it and you don't have to run away\nfrom it once you don't have to run away\nfrom it then you can actually solve it\nso now we get to one of the weirdest\nthings in\nlife which is that running away from\nyour problems doesn't solve them but\nrunning towards them does which we all\nknow right but think about it that's not\nhow we\nlive we go on trying to avoid avoid\navoid and then we create I don't want to\ndo my homework oh my God it's still\ngoing to be there tomorrow I don't want\nto do my homework oh my God it's still\ngoing to be there tomorrow I don't want\nto study one hour today so you end up\nstudying two hours tomorrow you don't\nwant to study two hours today [ __ ] you\ndon't even want to study one now you\nhave to study three the next\nday so acceptance of the negative\nconsequences from your actions from the\nget-go is one of the best things that\nyou can do it will give you a lot of\nmental\nfortitude how do you learn to be like\nstrong on the inside you learn to accept\nthe\nconsequences it is in the avoidance of\nyour consequences that you become\nweak I don't like this consequence so\nI'm going to\nlie and then people are going to find\nout so then you run away then you\nhide now you are being controlled by the\nenvironment you can't afford for people\nto find out since you can't afford for\npeople to find out you got to keep them\nseparated now you're becoming parent oid\nbut you're being blown around by\nwhatever is going on in your life\nthere's no\nfortitude learn to\naccept then look at things with balance\nspend some time with yourself get a good\nnight's sleep wake up and then decide\nwhich one feels right to\nyou recognize that any decision could be\nthe wrong one but you're going to make\nit anyway and the best that you can do\nis make the decision that you can make\ntoday there's no such thing as the right\nDEC decision or the wrong decision\nthere's only whichever decision appears\nto be best in this moment with this\namount of\ninformation and as you start living your\nlife that way it becomes way easier and\nyour outcomes will generally speaking\nimprove right how can I make a statement\nlike that it's because we have these\nevidence-based modalities of\npsychotherapy like acceptance and\ncommitment therapy that tend to or focus\non accepting your problems not even\nchanging them it's like\ncrazy and as you accept your problems\nyour problems get better you do change\nyour problems and act but the first step\nis\nacceptance so if you're trying to figure\nout should I give up or should I stay\naccept the consequences either way and\nthen the beautiful thing is you say in\nthis moment today this is the best thing\nbest that I can do and the cool thing is\nas you get more information it allows\nyou to\nchange right cuz you haven't decided oh\nI'm not going to give give up once you\nadopt that ego I'm never going to give\nup right I'm not going to give up today\nlike no one says that it's like I'm not\ngoing to give up that's permanent I'm\nnever going to give up I'm not a quitter\nand then things get worse and worse and\nworse and why do you stay because I'm\nnot a\nquitter so instead I'm going to stay in\nthis abusive relationship cuz I ain't a\nquitter y'all see so take care of\nyourself take care of your mind balance\nyour mind think through things as best\nas you can utilize acceptance and then\nyour mind will be\nclear and as your mind becomes clear\nyour decisions will be\nbetter make\nsense thank you very much for coming kit\nBoga Raiders I offer y'all one last\nhonor
