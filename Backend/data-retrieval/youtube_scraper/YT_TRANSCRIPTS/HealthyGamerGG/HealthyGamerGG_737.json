    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about\nrejection sensitivity\n[Music]\nlook at the world there are kind of two\ntypes of people there's one group of\npeople that are sort of living\nrelationships on hard mode where they're\nkind of constantly in their heads about\nokay if I say this is going to piss\nsomeone off what will they think about\nme they're sort of always walking on\neggshells relationships feel really\nreally hard whether they're at work\nwhether they're romantic relationships\nor even friendships or family\nrelationships and if you're one of those\npeople you look at other people and\nyou're like how is this even possible\nthere are some people out there who are\nlike yeah you know if people get pissed\noff at what I do that's their problem\nyou know I can't be shaping my behavior\nto try to make other people happy I\ngotta live for myself and for some of us\nthat seems like incredibly foreign in\nour mind our experience is completely\ndifferent we're constantly thinking\nabout okay what is this person going to\nthink what is this person going to do\nhow can I avoid having this person like\nget mad at me and we're sort of\nhypersensitive to that stuff and the\nreally frustrating thing is is that when\nwe look at these people who are sort of\nlike oblivious to relationship stuff\nthey seem to be like living kind of like\nhappy-go-lucky oblivious sort of lives\nand they also seem to have like\nfriendships and things like that they\ncan also do really well at work right\nbecause they're kind of like extroverted\nand outgoing and if they screw up\nthey're like lol hi screwed up and\neveryone laughs at them and meanwhile\nyou were at work and you're like oh my\nGod I screwed up what are people gonna\nthink am I gonna get fired is everyone\ngoing to hate me and it just feels like\nthere's these two completely different\nways of living life the hard thing is\nthat as we sort of look towards those\npeople who are kind of oblivious about\nthis stuff they don't seem to be\nthinking about it it doesn't really\nbother them we actually kind of want to\nbe like them right we want to be happy\ngo lucky we want to be a little bit out\nof our own heads we want to be able to\nset our boundaries the challenge though\nis that we can't really do what they do\nright and we may even list talk to them\nuh and ask for advice or we may sort of\nlike hear about advice from the internet\nwhere people are like just do this like\nset your boundaries right like let your\nboss know that this is not okay let your\nparents know that this is not okay this\nis unacceptable and so we can kind of\nsay stuff like that but with the people\nwho are giving that kind of advice\naren't really like sensitive to\nrejection so the Playbook that they're\nusing is different from the Playbook\nthat we're using the life that they're\nliving in even the brains that they have\nare actually very different from ours\nbecause rejection sensitivity is a very\nreal thing and today we're going to talk\na little bit about how we develop\nrejection sensitivity a little bit about\nhow it manifests and some more about\nwhat to do about it so let's talk about\nhow rejection sensitivity develops so\ngenerally speaking rejection sensitivity\nis actually an Adaptive survival\nmechanism to a non-ideal environment\ngrowing up so we're going to give you\nall kind of an extreme example of this\nokay so let's say that I'm in a\nhousehold where I don't feel safe or\nsecure the most most classic example is\nlike a parent who is abusive or\nneglectful so what people sort of learn\nwhat children learn is a survival\nmechanism is how can I read any kind of\nsubtle sign from my parenting figure or\ncaregiver about what their mood is and\nhow can I avoid pissing them off right\nso if caregivers sort of blame you for\ntheir bad mood and they punish you for\nlike annoying them then you will become\nsensitive to rejection so what this\nexperience kind of feels like for people\nis like you're kind of walking on\neggshells you're hyper Vigilant to the\nmood of people within the household and\nsometimes when I talk to people who have\nreally been in traumatic situations I'll\nask them how long does it take you to\nknow whether you're like in for a bad\nnight and they'll say they can tell\nwithin seconds the second my mom or dad\nwalks in the door I can tell based on\nlike it's it's so rapid and it's\nunconscious I know already that I need\nto go into survival mode and what these\npeople will end up doing is they'll\nengage in some kinds of behaviors that\nare actually survive level or adaptive\nOrient or adaptations such as becoming\ninvisible right or being very very\ncareful about what you say or what you\ndo because you don't want to trigger\nsome kind of negative sort of situation\nand if you kind of think about the child\nin this situation this situation does\nnot feel safe or secure and since it's\nnot safe or secure we can't do anything\neven remotely risky and what we have to\nlearn how to do is play it safe and if\nyou grow up in a household like this you\nwill grow up as someone who is rejection\nsensitive and this by the way is not\nsomething that like people kind of made\nup this is something that's very been\nvery scientifically validated they're\nactually questionnaires that you can\ntake that will actually measure the\nlevel of rejection sensitivity you have\nand people have also done brain scans on\npeople who are sensitive to rejection\nand found that their brains are\ndifferent for example one study looked\nat activity in the dorsal interior\ncingulate cortex which you don't have to\nget into too much of the specifics but\nthe key thing about these brain scan\nstudies is that they find that some\npeople are sensitive to specifically\ndisapproval and that some parts of their\nbrain will light up and will become\nhyperactive when there's any kind of\ndisapproval on their radar they don't\nrespond this way to even things like\nanger or fear or other negative emotions\nbut when they see a facial expression of\ndisapproval their brain kind of lights\nup like a Christmas tree so this is\nabsolutely something that is an\nadaptation and shapes the way that our\nbrain is formed so what are the key\nfeatures of rejection sensitivity there\nare three of them the first is anxious\nexpectation so people who are sensitive\nto rejection are always worried and\nalmost expecting to be rejected so what\nthis results in is in social situations\na sense of hyper vigilance where you're\nconstantly thinking or even waiting to\nbe rejected so you can't just be\nyourself and relax you have to\nconstantly think about okay if I say\nthis how is this person going to respond\nif I show up at work and I'm wearing\nthis clothing will this person and start\nto think oh my God I'm trying to copy\nthem so you're constantly thinking about\nand expecting some sort of rejection the\nsecond feature of rejection sensitivity\nis ready perception now what does this\nmean this means that there are actually\nneutral stimuli in the environment that\nyou will perceive as negative and there\nhave been studies done on this as well\nwhere someone may say like let's say you\ntext someone and then they don't respond\nright away so this is somewhat like of a\nneutral stimulus it doesn't mean that\nthey dislike you doesn't mean that they\nhate you but if you are someone who is\nprone to rejection what that means is\nthat your brain will interpret a neutral\nstimulus in a negative way and this\nexplains why people who are sensitive to\nrejection have such difficult\nexperiences of life because there's\nactually a lot of neutral or benign\nstimuli out there but our brains are\ngoing to interpret them as like negative\ntowards us and this sort of leads to the\nthird aspect of rejection sensitivity\nwhich is overreaction so this is where\neither emotionally or behaviorally where\nfirst of all anxiously expecting and\nthen we're over interpreting neutral\nstimuli which then results in an\noverreaction right so if I text someone\nand they don't text me back suddenly I\nfeel terrible my amygdala and my\nhippocampus will sort of like hyper\nactivate my limbic system hyper\nactivates I feel a ton of negative\nemotion and then I suddenly start\ncopiously apologizing for texting them\nand disturbing them right so what your\nlife sort of feels like if you're\nsensitive to rejection what it actually\nlooks like is that they're all kinds of\nlike neutral or maybe negative stimuli\nyou perceive them as negative and then\nyou're constantly apologizing constantly\nwalking on eggshells constantly trying\nto fix relationships that you seem to\nalways screw up and so this is all\nmediated by stuff going on in the brain\nnow the tricky thing about rejection\nsensitivity is as we mentioned earlier\nit's actually a survival mechanism and\nthe real problem that people who are\nsensitive to rejection run into is that\nthis is kind of like learning a survival\nstrategy that then stops helping you\nsurvive and actually causes you problems\nlater on in life and so there's one key\nthing to understand here which is that\nwhen you learn these kinds of avoidant\nbehaviors right because by the way\nyou're tired of pissing people off and\nyou keep on screwing up so the best\nthing to do is to retract from the\nrelationship so if you kind of think\nabout how we learn these strategies\nthese strategies are usually learned in\nthe home so there's one key thing that's\nvery different about growing up with\nrejection sensitivity and living as an\nadult with rejection sensitivity and\nthat is when you're growing up the\nrelationship is actually constant or\nguaranteed right so I want you all to\nthink about a six-year-old or a\nseven-year-old who's learning these\nadaptive strategies as they learn to\nwithdraw and avoid people because we're\ntired of pissing people off and we keep\non screwing up that parent is still\ngoing to be there tomorrow they're going\nto still be there the next day in the\nnext day in the next month in the next\nyear so we learn this sort of adaptive\nstrategy of avoidance in a situation\nwhere the relationship can never be\nruptured right if I start avoiding\npeople like my parents are still going\nto be there every day so the\nrelationship is in a kind of constant\nstate that will never result in like\nthem withdrawing from you because it's a\nparental relationship the real struggle\nthat people with rejection sensitivity\nhave is as they move out into the world\nthose relationships are not constant\nthose relationships are not guaranteed\nand so what happens is a lot of the\nstrategies that we use which is learning\nhow to be invisible walking on eggshells\nand avoiding situations will actually\nnegatively impact our relationships\nright because if I start to be really\navoidant with a friend of mine or\nsomeone that I I'm even starting to date\nor a boss and I'm like dodging text\nmessages because I'm afraid of pissing\nthem off what I will end up doing is\npiss them off I'll come across as aloof\nI'll come across as uninvested I'll come\nacross as busy and then people will\nstart to retreat from us and that this\ncreates a really challenging conundrum\nfor someone who's sensitive to rejection\nbecause oh my my God now this person is\nretreating what did I do wrong and\nthat's when you you kind of get\nparalyzed right because you don't you\nwant to do more you want to pull them\nback in but you grew up in a situation\nthat did not teach you how to pull\npeople back in did not teach you how to\nengage with people because actually the\nsurvival strategy when you were growing\nup is go go invisible and become\navoidant so now the natural question\nkind of becomes okay so what do we do\nabout this right and this is where we're\ngoing to Tunnel down into the three\nfeatures of rejection sensitivity a\nlittle bit more so the first is anxious\nexpectation so this is where If You\nobserve yourself when you interact with\npeople what you'll kind of discover is\nthat your mind is on high alert and one\nof the key things that you can do to\nkind of overcome this is try to have as\nmany neutral interactions as you can so\nwhy does your mind always exist on high\nalert it always exists on high alert\nbecause it learned to be in high alert\nright like you learned that okay we need\nto be constantly in high alert because\nwe are constantly in danger so one of\nthe most important things that you can\ndo is to have as many neutral\ninteractions as possible and don't\noverreact to them so if you go and hang\nout with people try to have it just be\nneutral right so like you don't have to\nknock it out of the park you don't need\nto like piss people off but just try to\nhang out with people and over time as\nlong as you're kind of neutral that sort\nof anxious expectation will start to\ndecrease we basically want to give our\nbrain more data about how people will\nreact to us because we don't want to use\nthe conclusions from childhood the\nsecond thing that we need to be a little\nbit careful about is how we react to\nneutral stimuli and this is where people\nwho are sensitive to rejection really\nnegotiate against themselves when it\ncomes to social situations so you will\ntake any kind of neutral situation or\nany kind of situation and you will first\nof all assume the worst and secondly\nblame yourself the most right so if\nsomeone says hey I'm sorry I can't hang\nout today or they cancel the last minute\nyou're not going to interpret that as oh\nthis person is flaky or they're sick or\nthis is a problem on their end you are\nautomatically going to interpret that as\na problem on your end so you need to\nreally be aware of the way that you\nactually like give yourself very little\ncredit and you give them a bunch of\ncredit and you'll you're sort of really\nwilling to negotiate yourself and always\ntake on the mantle of being the bad guy\nbecause remember in the household that\nyou grew up in whose fault was it if\nmommy or daddy were mad it was your\nfault you need to be quieter I can't\nbelieve you didn't put away your toys\nand they kind of blame you for all this\nkind of stuff so you get into a pattern\nof blaming yourself so become aware of\nthat pattern and the third thing is that\npeople who are sensitive to rejection\ntend to overreact both emotionally and\nbehaviorally and so that's where I know\nthis sounds really really really hard\nbut when you are in a situation where\nyou feel rejected just stall just\nprocrastinate just don't do anything\ndon't do anything to make them happy\nbecause remember that your mind may be\nover interpreting or incorrectly\ninterpreting how they feel about the\nsituation so don't like don't react so\nyou'll have these very powerful drivers\nwithin you that say oh my God I screwed\nup I screwed up I screwed up what do I\nneed to do what do I need to do to fix\nit let me send them flowers let me do\nthis let me apologize over and over and\nover again because until I apologize\nI can't tolerate this feeling of\nnegativity but as you start to overly\napologize and take responsibility for\nstuff that is not your responsibility\nwhat happens to the relationship\nsometimes they're like oh my God this\nperson is like so clingy like I don't\neven know like I can't manage this\nperson's negative emotions like they're\noverly apologizing I don't know what to\ndo so they can start to withdraw or\nsometimes what's even worse is they will\nplay into it they're like yeah\neverything is your fault and I feel this\nway because you screwed up and the worst\nthing that someone who's sensitive\nrejection can do is find someone who\nwill Tango with them find someone who\nwill actually be like willing to dance\nthat dance with them because then what\nends up happening is you find yourself\nin an abusive relationship where you\nhave you're now in a relationship with\nsomeone and that could be friendship\ncould be boss could be romantic where\nthey you're willing to take the blame\nall the time and hey by the way they're\nnarcissistic so they're totally happy\nblaming you all the time so the key\nthing there is to try to just not react\ntry to stall as much as possible and try\nto tolerate that negativity as best as\nyou can now this is where we kind of got\nto talk about a couple of other\ninterventions there are several studies\non meditation that show that meditation\nactually mediates improvements in\nrejection sensitivity and specifically\nwhat meditation teaches is some stuff\nlike self-compassion so there are some\nstudies that have even tunnel down into\nokay what aspect of meditation is\nresponsible for improving rejection\nsensitivity and it turns out that\nself-compassion is a key part of so\nlet's think a little bit about how this\nworks so as we start to meditate and\nespecially if we do self-compassion\nmeditations which you all can find on\nour YouTube channel or you can sort of\ncheck out Dr K's guide as you start to\ndo these meditations you start to\ndevelop compassion towards yourself and\nas you develop compassion towards\nyourself you start to not always be at\nfault if you're not always at fault or\nsomeone that people are just waiting to\nreject then you can start to really like\nstart to interact with people and kind\nof a healthier way right because if they\ndon't text you back oh that has nothing\nto do with me because I'm actually a\ndecent human being so it's not\nnecessarily my fault and so this is one\nway in which meditation can really help\nus address these kinds of things another\nmechanism through which meditation can\nhelp with rejection sensitivity is that\nit helps us be observers of our own\ninternal environment right so the\nproblem with a rejection sensitivity is\nthat our mind produces conclusions that\nwe automatically believe to be true oh\nyeah this person is not texting me back\nbecause I'm not worth texting back and\nso what we actually want to do what\nmeditation can help us do is create\ndistance between our own experiences and\ncan lead to actually non-reactivity\nwhich is one of the key things that we\nreally want to fix when it comes to\nrejection sensitivity sensitivity now if\nyou're listening to this and you're kind\nof saying okay so like what are you\nsaying I should just tldr meditate well\nthat's like if you want to DIY it right\nif you're listening to this up until\nthis point you're saying that sounds\nreally hard and it sounds really hard\nfor me to kind of fix this sounds like\nI've tried meditation before and it's\nhard to do well we're happy to lay out\nwith you how you can DIY it but this is\nwhere frankly like diying it is hard so\nthe real question that you've got to ask\nis like okay if you can handle this you\nshould absolutely do it here's the road\nforward but it can be a little bit of a\nbumpy road the other challenge here is\nthat sometimes therapy can be helpful\nfor rejection sensitivity so for example\nrejection sensitivity is coral tightly\ncorrelated with Borderline Personality\nDisorder with mood disorders with\nanxiety disorder with body dysmorphia so\nit's correlated with all these mental\nillnesses that you can get diagnosed and\ntreated for and if you get diagnosed and\ntreated for those conditions chances are\nthe rejection sensitivity will improve\nso if you feel like this is too much to\ndo on your own you can absolutely work\nwith a therapist or psychiatrist who can\nhelp you with some of these other\nconditions as well the real challenge\nabout working with therapists or\npsychiatrists though is that none of us\nare really formally trained or very few\nof us are formally trained in rejection\nsensitivity what we're trained in is are\nthose diagnoses and this is where things\nget really tricky because it's possible\nto have rejection sensitivity without\none of those diagnoses and remember that\nrejection sensitivity can kind of\ncorrelate with each of those things so\nthe cool thing is that through research\nwe've really understood that like\nactually rejection sensitivity is a\nadaptation of the brain it's a\nparticular wiring or conditioning that\ncan be deconditioned and you can\nactually Target that specifically and\nthis is where like we sort of understand\nthis stuff which is why we kind of like\nbuilt our coaching programs so as an\nexample like group coaching was sort of\ndesigned to help people with the stuff\nthat therapists sort of aren't great at\nnecessarily helping with so we're not\nreally substitute therapy and we don't\ntry to be substitute therapy what we\nreally try to do is help people with\nthings like emotional awareness\nrejection sensitivity awareness of\ninteractions and so group coaching is a\ngood example of this because what we do\nin group coaching and by the way you\ndon't have to sign up for group coaching\nif you can find an environment we're\ngoing to lay out what we try to\naccomplish in group coaching that you\ncan absolutely try to craft for yourself\nokay so in group coaching you're with a\ngroup of people so you're anxiously\nexpecting that you're going to piss\nsomeone off and when you feel that way\nthe group is an environment where you\ncan share those feelings and you can say\nI feel terrible about myself and then\nthis is where people with compassion and\nauthenticity will help you dig into that\nfeeling and what we're going to sort of\ncreate is this artificial social space\nwhere you can kind of like examine your\nreactions we're going to evoke those\nreactions but we're not going to kick\nyou out of the group we're not going to\nstop texting you and this is the real\nvalue of group is that there's no other\npart to the relationship right so we\ndon't care like we're not planning on\nplaying video games we're not going to\nbe friends we're not going to date we're\nnot going to go into business together\nit is literally a place for you to\nengage in examine your social\ninteractions and actually start the\nprocess of Repro programming so this is\nwhat we try to create is situations\nwhere like you're going to have feelings\nwe're going to invite you to share your\nfeelings we'll even inquire if we notice\nyou're quiet we'll sort of say like hey\nwhat makes it hard for you to engage\nwith us do you feel comfortable asking\nanswering questions and so people will\nkind of like bring you in there they'll\nbear that responsibility and what we\ntend to see when we sort of create this\nkind of situation and once again it\ndoesn't have to be group coaching but if\nyou can create any kind of situation\nwhere you can have some of these\nexplorations of your reactions to\nconversation to kind of social cues and\nthings like that then you can really\nstart to unravel that and start to\nreprogram yourself so as it turns out if\nyou're kind of looking at other people\nwho seem to be able to socialize like\nreally freely and are like kind of like\nyeah I don't really mind if I piss other\npeople off because that's on them and\nthat idea is very enviable to you but\nalso seems foreign to your like how on\nEarth can you do that I'm terrified\nconstantly of pissing people off and\nthere's all kinds of relationships that\nI end up screwing up and maybe even\nyou've gone to a therapist or\npsychiatrist and you've tried to figure\nout what's going on but you don't even\nmeet diagnostic criteria for something\nlike social anxiety disorder it turns\nout that there's this whole other thing\nthat we actually have a growing body of\nresearch on and that is rejection\nsensitivity the reason our brain is\nwired like this is because these were\nactually adaptive survival mechanisms\nfor usually our home environment the\nreal challenges that our home\nenvironment is kind of built on this\nidea that your parents won't really\nabandon you right so maybe they did but\nhopefully not but if you're six if\nyou're seven if you're eight if you're\nnine your parents are always going to be\nthere so the way that I'd kind of\ndescribe this is It's almost like\nimagine you're learning how to swim with\na life vest on so like you have this\nlife vest on because your parents are\nnever going to abandon you and so the\nhabits that you build the way that you\nlearn how to swim is like not really\nideal because you've got this one key\nSafeguard and this is what happens with\npeople with rejection sensitivity is\nthat help them survive in the pool with\nthe life vest the problem is that when\nyou move out into the real world and\nwhen you start to engage in work\nrelationships romantic relationships\neven friendships that life vest goes\naway because your parents may never\nabandon you but other people if you like\nkeep avoiding them or you overly\napologize or you're clingy like they're\ngonna be like this is too much and\nthey're actually going to withdraw so\nwhat happens is you build all these\nhabits of how to swim with a life vest\non and then when you move out into the\nworld you take the life vest off and\nsuddenly the ways that you learn how to\nswim no longer work and then you feel\nlike you're drowning and you look at\neveryone else out there who's actually\nable to swim and you're like I don't\nunderstand and you try to mimic their\nmovements but it doesn't work right you\ncan't just watch someone else swim and\nthen suddenly like have been in the\nwater for 18 years with life s and\nsuddenly do what they're doing you're\ngonna start drowning and it feels really\ntraumatic and it feels like it's\nimpossible to get a handle on so our\nhope today is that we've helped you\nunderstand this a little bit to\nunderstand that there isn't something\nfundamentally best with you this is your\nbrain's way of like trying to figure out\nhow to survive in the household that you\ngrew up with and the cool thing is that\nthose adaptations we can actually lay\nout and there's actually a process\neverything from meditation to the DIY\nstuff to seeing a therapist or trying\nsomething like coaching that you can\nactually like unlearn some of these\nbehaviors you can actually learn how to\nreprogram yourself to swim in these\nkinds of relationships\nforeign"
