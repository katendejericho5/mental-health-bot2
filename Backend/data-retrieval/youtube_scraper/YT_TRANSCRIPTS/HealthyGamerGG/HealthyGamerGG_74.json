    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nfix your sleep\n[Music]\nschedule so the biggest mistake that we\ntend to make when we are trying to fix\nour sleep schedule is we focus on going\nto bed right we have all these things\nlike sleep hygiene like make sure you do\nmeditation for 30 minutes and go for a\nwalk and don't eat something super heavy\nand avoid cell phones because they have\nblue light and something about the\npineal gland and melatonin we focus on\nall this stuff at night but that's the\nbiggest mistake if you want to fix your\nsleep schedule what you need to do is\nfix your waking hours so what is the\npurpose of sleep right why do human\nbeings sleep if we look at some animals\nlike whales or Dolphins they'll sleep\nfor 5 to 20 minutes several times\nthroughout the day and they're active in\nbetween so the human brain sleeps for\nabout 8 hours a night to compensate or\ncomplement our waking activity and the\nbiggest problem in the world today is\nthat our waking hours have changed so\nthe biological signals that trigger\nsleep have now become impaired so as we\nunderstand why the brain needs to sleep\nin the first place we can start to\nInstitute those things during the day\nand then end up making going to sleep\nactually incredibly easy and I say this\nas a psychiatrist who's work with tons\nof patients about 90% of my patients end\nup sleeping very very easily after\nworking together for a few months and do\nso without medication I'll have many\npatients that come to my office and say\nDoc I'm having trouble sleeping like can\nyou prescribe something and we can\nprescribe stuff that's totally okay I'm\nnot against prescriptions for sleep but\nthe goal is that you can take those\ntemporarily but over time we want to\nbuild a life where you're engaging your\nbody in all of the right ways so that\nyour sleep signals are at their maximum\nwhen you try to go to bed when people\nhear that we offer coaching at HG their\nfirst question is like what on Earth\neven is that so here's the basic problem\nwhen you struggle with something in your\nlife you don't see the problem from the\noutside you see it from the inside the\nvalue of a coach is that they can look\nat your life from the outside they can\nunderstand what's going on and they can\nhelp guide you to improve things like\nmotivation accomplish short-term goals\nand even increase a sense of purpose in\nlife and over the long term we also see\nimprovements in feelings of depression\nand anxiety and the best part is we've\nhad over 100,000 coaching sessions and\nwe incorporate that feedback to\ncontinually improve our program so if\nyall are interested in actually making a\nchange in your life check out the link\nin the description below so let's start\nwith the first thing that really\nconfuses a lot of people you have a\nwindow to go to sleep and if you miss\nthat window it becomes increasingly\ndifficult to go to sleep some people\nwill say if I wake up by this time then\nI'm okay but if I sleep too long then\nI'm groggy or if I wake up too early\nthen I'm groggy most of us have or all\nof us have this thing called a circadian\nrhythm which dictates when it is is\neasiest to wake up and when it is\neasiest to go to sleep and if we miss\nthat window it becomes increasingly\ndifficult so the first thing is as we\nare awake throughout the day we\naccumulate this chemical called\nadenosine in our brain and this sort of\nsignals to us the degree of fatigue we\nhave and then this sort of makes us want\nto go to sleep so throughout the day or\nlet this is just simplification but we\ncan say that the fatigue signals in the\nbrain slowly increase over time then\nwhat happens is we have this other part\nof our brain called The frontal lobes so\nthe frontal loes are the parts of our\nbrain that restrain impulses and control\nour our our Behavior you can kind of\nthink about them as willpower and\nremember that your frontal loes are\ngetting exhausted throughout the day as\nwell so there is a very specific window\nwhere the fatigue signals in the brain\nare high and your frontal loes have\nenough willpower there's enough gas in\nthe tank to restrain your impulses so\nthis isn't that the frontal loes have\nreached complete exhaustion but there's\nthis window where you feel tired and\nyour brain has enough willpower to where\nit can restrain your impulses like binge\neating or hopping on your cell phone or\nwatching something on TV or getting up\nand doing whatever right so you have to\nbe able to restrain impulses to go to\nsleep and if we look at people who\nreally struggle with sleep what ends up\nhappening you get into bed and then\nyou're kind of really tired and then you\nhop on your cell phone right cuz you\ncan't really restrain that and then an\nhour goes by an hour and a half goes by\nyou feel really sleepy and then you kind\nof jump to something else or you try to\nput it away and then you pick it up\nagain 5 minutes later so if we really\nlook at what goes on with people who\nstruggle with sleep they have an impulse\ncontrol problem they cannot restrain\ntheir impulses they cannot just sit in\nbed and wait to fall asleep right you\nhave to pick something up and technology\nhas something to do with that absolutely\nbut the main issue is that we are\nmissing this window where our brains are\nfatigued enough to go to bed and not so\nfatigued that they can't restrain\nimpulses so for most people this window\nis somewhere between 1 and 2 hours it's\nthis really sweet spot what time of the\nday it happens we'll kind of get to a\nlittle bit later but it probably happens\nif you wake up around 8:00 it probably\nhappens somewhere between 9:00 p.m. and\n10 p.m. that's your optimal sleep window\nif you stay up past that window you will\nnot have the willpower Reserve to\nrestrain your impulses and continue\nprocrastinating going to bed now why is\nthis becoming an increasing problem so\nre researchers have recently discovered\nthat there are two types of sleep\nprocrastination there is procrastination\nof going to bed okay so this is like I'm\nnot ready to get into bed yet and what\nthey've actually discovered is that\nthere is a second kind of\nprocrastination which is while in bed\nprocrastination this is a completely new\nthing so if we look at the science of it\nwhat we find is that human beings I\nguess since the dawn of time\nprocrastinated on going to bed and this\nprocrastination was somewhere between 30\nand 75 minutes and since the Advent of\nthings like cell phones and easy access\nto devices what we've discovered is that\nthere is a second level of\nprocrastination so you procrastinate\ngetting into bed by about 30 to 75\nminutes that's fair enough but then once\nyou are in bed there is within bed\nprocrastination which is another 30 to\n75 minutes and the key thing about\nadding this second layer of\nprocrastination is it puts us outside of\nthat fatigue and impulse control window\nthat really nice sweet spot which then\nmeans that we can't really control what\nwe're doing and we stay up way too long\nso the first thing to do if you want to\nfix your sleep schedule is really try to\nTarget that window and recognize that if\nyou pick up your cell phone you\nshouldn't take your cell phone to bed\nthat's a very practical tip which we'll\nget to at the end but if you miss that\nwindow it's not just I'm going to stay\non the phone for an additional 15\nminutes or 30 minutes it's not 15 or 30\nminutes it's actually going to cost you\nway more it's kind of like missing your\nflight right like you don't want to\ndelay if you delay a little bit too long\nand you miss your flight you miss the\nwindow and then you're in a lot of\ntrouble this is the first principle that\nI teach my patients that really really\nhelps them develop a solid sleep\nschedule over time the second thing that\nwe're going to talk about is emotional\nflooding so if we look at the overall\neffect of technology there is one\nuniform thing that basically all\ntechnological devices do this can be\nsocial media this can be browsing Reddit\nthis can be watching things on YouTube\nwatching things on Tik Tok shorts\nwhatever it doesn't matter they all do\none thing they share one thing in common\nwhich is that they suppress our negative\nemotional circuitry right so if you're\nfeeling bad it doesn't matter what you\ncan do you can binge watch a show you\ncan play a video game you can watch some\nporn you can browse some social media\nlook at some Twitter trolls like\nwhatever all of these things have one\nshared effect which is that they\nsuppress your negative emotional C\ncircuitry now a lot of times people\nthink okay if I'm suppressing my\nnegative social emotional circuitry does\nthat mean that the emotions go away no\nthis is suppression right it is not\nelimination of emotions it is\nsuppression of emotions so there's a\nvery common thing that I'm beginning to\nsee now and I experienced this when I\nwas struggling with video game addiction\nwhere you suppress these negative\nemotional circuits throughout the day\nand so the moment that you put your\ndevices away there's this experience of\nemotional flooding the moment that you\nput your device away right because\nyou're like supposed to not watch your\ndevice in bed stay away from your device\nso you put it away in what happens a\nflood of thoughts tend to come forward\nyou start to have anxieties you start to\nhave regrets you start to be depressed\nabout tomorrow you beat yourself up\nright so even if we look at the\nemotional experience of trying to go to\nbed you're frustrated with yourself why\ndo I keep on doing this this is such a\nwaste of time what is that that's\nemotional energy and so basically what's\ngoing on is throughout the day what\nhuman beings used to do is process their\nemotions if if you look at the\nsituations in which our brains evolved\nthey tended to involve a lot of rot\nmechanical tasks we're doing stuff like\nchurning butter or like plowing a field\nwith an oxen and when you're sitting on\na cart and you're like kind of whipping\nthe ox and you're not whipping it too\nhard it's kind of just trundling along\nthe road like what's your mind doing\nyour mind is just processing all these\nemotions like human beings used to be so\nbored and so when the mind has idle time\nwhen that mind is not occupied by\nsomething what it does is it starts\ncleaning out the trash right it the mind\nis on empty it's not focusing on\nanything now what's going on in our\nsociety is that we have so much sensory\nstimulus our mind is so engaged in\nlaughing at this or looking at a cat\nvideo or getting pissed off by political\nbeliefs that we don't like whatever the\nsituation is we don't have time to\nprocess our minor emotional things\nthroughout the day and so then when we\ngo to bed our mind finally has empty\ntime and what does it have to do process\nall of these emotions that have built up\nso this is the experience of emotional\nflooding so then what happens is people\nget so overwhelmed or activated by this\nemotional flooding that they have to\ndistract themselves from it right you\nfeel overwhelmed and what's your\nsolution pick up a device because that\nquiets all the emotions down so then we\nget stuck in this pingpong between\noverwhelming emotions and distracting\noursel from our emotions because the\noverwhelming emotions aren't going to\nlet us sleep right and you really need\nto go to sleep and the more you stress\nyourself out the harder it is to sleep\nso you ping pong between these two\nthings until you reach the point of\nabsolute exhaustion so now it's super\nlate and the fatigue signals in your\nbrain are so powerful that you finally\npass out but this is not how you fix\nyour sleep schedule right this is what\ndestroys your sleep schedule so what do\nwe do about emotional flooding give\nyourself time during the day to be bored\nand let your mind take out the trash so\nI recommend an hourlong walk don't\nlisten to anything no music no podcasts\nanything like that in your mind all\nthese things will start to come up you\ncan absolutely do things like meditation\nand particularly like parasympathetic\nmeditations are very good we explain\nthis stuff in Dr K's guide to meditation\nand and things like that we've explained\nthat all over the place you can\nabsolutely meditate but all you really\nhave to do is give your mind space okay\nas you give your mind space you will\nprocess some of those emotions\nautomatically you can also do things\nlike journaling meditation Etc you can\ndo focused emotional practices or you\ncan just give yourself some time and the\nmore that you manage these emotions the\nless flooding will happen and the more\ncalm your mind will be when you go to\nbed if your mind is calm then you can\npick a time and the mind will naturally\nsleep the third thing that we're going\nto talk about is how you spend your\nwaking hours in particular what we want\nto do is try to work ideally early in\nthe morning so the more work we get done\nduring the day the easier it will be to\nsleep so let's understand why this is so\nthe first thing is what is the\nbiological need for sleep sleep is to\ncompensate for work right so as if you\nlook at like mammals why do mammals\nsleep because mammals are generally\nspeaking engaged in some degree of work\nthroughout several hours of the day and\nso we have such an evolved brain that we\nkeep track of this so I want youall to\nreally pay attention to this I know it's\ngoing to be kind of a stretch but it's\nreally important to understand so our\nbrain keeps track of all of the work\nthat we have to do this is how our brain\nreminds you right so let's say you spend\na couple hours like watching Netflix or\nwhatever and then when it's over your\nbrain sends you a signal hey we have a\ntest to study for or we need oh I forgot\nI need to stop by the grocery store so\nif you think about this very simple\nconcept of how does the brain remember\nto remind you that you need to do things\nwell very simple in order for that to be\ndone it must keep track of all of the\nthings that you have to do and since\nit's keeping track of all of the things\nthat you have to do this creates a very\nbig problem for sleep so we're going to\nexplain this a little bit further so\nlet's take the example of\nprocrastinating for an exam so you've\ngot two weeks to study for an exam and\nyou kind of procrastinate up until the\npoint of about like 3 days but the\nquestion is why three days why not 5\ndays why not two days why not a day and\na half how is it that your brain decides\nto really induce that last minute Panic\nso that you start studying 3 days before\nan exam right and it's if you pay\nattention it's quite precise it's like\nwe can procrastinate today tomorrow the\nnext day one week a week and a half and\nthen once three days rolls around once\nsome amount of time rolls around\nsuddenly our brain is like no more\nprocrastination we're done last minute\nPanic let's go so think about that for a\nsecond how is how does the brain know\nhow to do that and if you start procr if\nyou start studying like a a Madman 3\ndays before a test you'll get like a B\nminus or a c you'll pass the exam right\nso what that means is our brain actually\nkeeps track of all of the tasks that we\nneed to do and when we start to move\nforward in our tasks our brain keeps\ntrack of that as well and if we have\nprocrastinated all day long and we have\nnot done enough work our brain does not\nlet us sleep because our brain basically\nallots a certain amount of work that we\nhave to get done every day you have all\nof these different tasks that need to be\ndone and so your brain knows okay like\nwe need to do at least this amount to\nnot fall further behind it keeps track\nof all of the stuff so what we really\nwant to do to be able to sleep at night\nis if we procrastinated if we haven't\ndone enough work our brain will say we\nhave not done our allotted work for the\nday this is actually not sufficient and\nthen it will actually keep us awake\nstress signals which we'll get to in\nmore detail will start to activate so\nthese are hormones like cortisol and\nliterally what cortisol does is it goes\nto the part of your brain that lets you\nyou fall asleep and it says hey we're\nnot done with our work for the day and\nyou know this right because if your\nsleep schedule is messed up when you try\nto go to bed your brain will remind you\nof all of the things that you should\nhave done this is the literal experience\nof 90% of my patients and so how do we\nfix this it is very simple we have to\nremove that cortisol signal we have to\nremove the cortisol signal by doing some\nkind of work the more work you do the\nmore it tells your brain your brain is\nkeeping track of it and it's not about\nwhether it's enough or it's good enough\nor anything like that you just need to\ndo some kind of work and we'll talk\nabout why that is as well but basically\nthe more work that you do the better off\nyou will be at going to sleep because\nnow your brain doesn't release that\ncortisol it says okay I got a lot done\ntoday I feel good about this and so it's\nokay there may be a part of your brain\nthat says it's not enough but that part\nof your brain is independent from the\npart of your brain that keeps track that\nyou've done something and once again\nwhat is the biological purpose for sleep\nit is to help us rest and recover from\nwork so if you do some amount of work\nduring the day it will help you sleep at\nnight now some people may say but Dr K\neven if I do some work like let's say I\ntake out the trash and I do this or that\nthat doesn't really solve my problems\nand this is the beautiful thing the\narchitecture that helps you sleep does\nnot relate to actually solving your\nproblems it can involve even doing\nthings that are complete completely\nmeaningless as long as they involve some\nkind of work now this may sound super\nconfusing but I'll give you all an\nexample you can even do meaning\nmeaningless work you don't have to\nprogress towards your goals it's crazy\nyou just need to do some kind of work so\nlet's understand how this works so if\nyou look at patients who have cancer one\nthing that happens is their family\nmembers will bring them lots of food now\nthis is in a sense kind of silly because\nfirst of all they're getting IV\nnutrition they're on chemotherapy the\nintestinal lining is sloughing off they\ncan't even eat anything they feel\nnauseous all the time and family brings\nfood family brings food family brings\nfood this also happens after someone\npasses away right so I'm kind of making\nlight of this but this is kind of silly\nso sorry about that I I don't mean to be\nmean but if you look at a funeral the\none thing that there is no shortage of\nat a funeral is lots of food everyone's\nbringing food everyone's bringing food\neveryone's bringing food look the person\nis dead right they're not going to need\nto eat anything and the family's not\nfeeling very hungry it's beautiful that\nyou want to bring some food and it's\ngreat I'm not saying it's a bad thing\nbut let's understand the psychology of\nit why does someone bring food to a\nfuneral it's because they feel like they\nwant to do something so if we look at\nthe human brain what we find is that\ntaking meaningless action is sufficient\nat reducing our cortisol level so this\nis a concept that we go into in a lot\nmore detail when we talk about\novercoming Anxiety by engaging in more\nactive challenges so there studies that\nshow that if you are feeling overwhelmed\nin life in order to feel less\noverwhelmed you can actually take on\nmore work so if you take on three\nadditional tasks now you have 13 total\nthings to do and a lot of people may\nthink if I have 13 things then I will\nfeel more overwhelmed because 13 is more\nthan 10 but the science shows us that\nfeeling overwhelmed is not about the\ntotal number of tasks that you you do it\nis about the number of tasks that you\nchoose compared to the number of tasks\nthat you have to deal with so the ratio\nof things that you want to work on\nversus things that you have to work on\nis literally what leads to feeling\noverwhelmed the more that we take on the\nless overwhelmed we feel and we see this\nprinciple once again in sleep because as\nyou are feeling stressed out if you work\non anything our brain is keeping track\nof this and sort of says okay we've done\nsome stuff today so now we can go to\nsleep so another goal in sleep is\nanabolism so anabolism is building your\ntissues so if we look at kids kids grow\nduring sleep if we look at things like\nmuscle repair muscle repair happens\nduring sleep our body builds tissue when\nwe sleep so on the converse side the\nother way we can look at it is that if\nwe need to build tissues then we will\nsleep more so children who are going\nthrough growth spurts need to sleep more\nwhen you start working out in exercising\nyou need to sleep more so let's think\nabout what's going on there so as you\nexercise and as you create small tears\nin your muscle fibers literally these\nmuscle fibers will send signals\ninflammatory signals to your your brain\ngrowth factors will start to activate\nwithin your brain these are things like\num uh you know insulin derived growth\nfactor insulin light growth factor so\nall of these kinds of growth factors\nwill start to send signals to your brain\nthat will then make you feel sleepy so\none of the best things that you can do\nto fall asleep is actually exercise now\nthis is not to get your Beach bought or\nanything like that this is about\nphysiologically creating the signals\nthat will travel to your brain and help\nyou sleep so we absolutely want to\nexercise and ideally weightlifting\nbecause weightlifting sends signals to\nyour bones and to your muscles you'll\nget some muscle tear so you really want\nto feel that burn in a healthy way we\ndon't want to create you know ATT tendon\ntear or anything like that and all of\nthese things will send sleep signals to\nyour brain make it easy for you to sleep\nat night the second thing that we're\ngoing to talk about is learning new\nstuff so the other thing that our brain\ndoes when we sleep is consolidates\nmemory so we we take our short-term\nmemory which lives in the hippocampus\nand it kind of gets\nConsolidated into other parts of the\nhippocampus in into long-term memory so\nthe more that you are learning the more\nsleep signals your brain will be\nreceiving so as you store a bunch of\nstuff in your short-term memory our\nbrain says holy crap we have to encode\nall of this stuff from our Ram into our\nhard drive and that requires sleep so\nwhat you will find is people who are\nengaged in cognitively intensive tasks\nwhere they are learning like learning\nnew things learning new languages it\nwill be easier for them to sleep because\nthe brain is sending signals sending\nsignals to your reticular activating\nsystem hey we need sleep hey we need\nsleep hey we need sleep so this is\ndifferent from just spending cognitive\nenergy so if I'm playing the same\n[ __ ] video game over and over and\nover again I'm not learning anything I'm\nnot rising in rank right I'm not\nwatching replays I'm not like focused on\nlearning something then I'm not going to\nbe able to sleep it is specifically\nlearning that triggers things like brain\nderived neurotrophic factor which will\nalso help us sleep so we want to send\nall of these kind of signals to our\nbrain to help us sleep next thing that\nwe're going to talk about is diet so a\nbig problem that people have when it\ncomes to sleep is what they actually eat\nso this is where what we really want to\ndo is be careful about what we eat so\nhere's one pattern that's a huge problem\nthat interferes with sleep I wake up I\nhave a cup of coffee coffee is an\nappetite suppressant so I don't eat a\nwhole lot and then 300 p.m. rolls around\nI have one big meal and then dinner time\nrolls around and I don't feel very\nhungry so I don't eat very much and then\neven though I had one big meal and it\nwas kind of unhealthy now my body and\nbrain are kind of confused because I may\nactually be at a caloric deficit or a\nnutrient deficit for the day which means\nthat my brain and my body are not\nsatisfied I can't actually go to sleep\nbecause I have a caloric deficit or\nnutrient deficit both of these things\nwill keep me awake and lead to nighttime\nsnacking because some measurement\ncapability in our brain our brain is\nkeeping track of the number of meals\nwe've had the number of calories we've\nhad the number of nutrients we've had\nand if we're deficient in some way it\nwon't let us sleep and it'll keep us\nawake until we eat something again\ninstead what we really want to do is\nmake sure you eat throughout the day as\nmuch as possible so we want to have two\nto three meals a day and this is the\nlast thing is that before you go to bed\nour dinner should actually be quite\nheavy and can have a fair load of\ncarbohydrates so what we really want is\na carb heavy meal but that also has\nprotein and fiber and there's a couple\nreasons for this why do we want a carb\nheavy meal so we want a carb heavy meal\nbecause this stimulates stimulates\ninsulin and Insulin makes us sleepy we\nwant to induce a food coma at night now\nif we eat a highly processed meal before\nbed we will get a big insulin Spike\nfollowed by a blood sugar crash and so\neven if you eat a ton of calories with\nno fiber so you can eat like a 2,000\ncalorie meal and you will still actually\nFe feel hungry within a few hours if\nthere is insufficient protein and\ninsufficient fiber the reason that we\nwant to add fiber and protein to our\nheavy carb meal is it slows down the\nrelease of carbohydrate into our system\nbecause our body has to digest all this\nother stuff it dilutes out the\ncarbohydrate as we dilute out the\ncarbohydrate we slowly absorb\ncarbohydrate which slowly keeps our\ninsulin levels High which keeps us\nsleepy for a sustained period of time\nwhich allows us to actually fall asleep\nso if you want to have a big bowl of\npasta with a salad in some kind of\ngrilled chicken or fish or something\nlike that that is a ideal meal before\nyou go to sleep you can also do\nsomething like have a burrito we don't\nwant to go too carb heavy on the burrito\nmake sure there's plenty of protein in\nthere plenty of vegetables you can eat\nall kinds of good stuff plenty of salsa\nand you're totally golden lettuce tomato\nwhatever you want in there is totally\ngood so we actually want to eat a heavy\nmeal before we go to bed that will help\nus induce sleep the last thing that we\nwant to consider is that stress in and\nof itself will keep us awake now this is\na huge problem today because our society\nis so full of stress so used to be that\nstresses were acute things right so I'm\nlike hunting in the jungle and I see a\ntiger so I'm stressed out once a week\nwhen I run into a tiger now we have all\nof these chronic stressors so grades at\nthe end of the semester mortgage at the\nend of the month I have to I'm worried\nabout dating and I'm worried about my ex\nshould I break up should I not break up\nI don't really know what to do my family\nis stressing out so we have all of these\nchronic stressors and as we saw we saw\nthat cortisol actually travels to the\nreticular activating system which is\nwhere our sleep signals come from and\nactually inhibits us from falling asleep\nso as we see a rise in chronic stress we\nare seeing chronic sleeplessness okay\nbecause the the brain is not able to\nfall asleep because our brain thinks\nwe're in danger so it's not going to let\nus fall asleep or get restful sleep so\nthis is where we need to manage our\nstress and I know that in and of itself\nis a huge task but this is kind of what\nmy point is about sleep is if you want\nto fix your sleep schedule everyone\nthinks that F fixing your sleep schedule\nis where you start right everyone thinks\noh my God like I need to fix my sleep\nschedule because I'm going to bed at a\ncrazy time I'm waking up at a crazy time\nnothing is consistent so I can't fix my\nrelationships I can't study I can't work\nI can't do anything I can't exercise\nbecause my sleep schedule is screwed up\neveryone thinks things start with the\nsleep schedule but things don't start\nwith the sleep schedule sleep schedule\nis the final thing so this is what's\nreally crazy and this is what I've seen\nwith most of my patients everyone tries\nto tackle sleep first but you can't\ntackle sleep first sleep is the last\nthing that you actually tackle because\nwhat we need to do is fix all of these\nsignals we need to fix all of the\ncircumstances all of the biological and\nneurochemical signals that induc sleep\nonce we do all of those things then\nsleep will come very easily and this is\nexactly why it's so hard to fix because\nwe're trying to do the last thing first\nyou can't you don't start at the Finish\nLine right you have to run the whole\nrace before you get to the finish line\nso this is something that's very\nimportant to understand we must manage\nour stress so we've talked about some of\nthe things that we've already kind of\ngiven you all the answers to do that\nright so if you start doing a little bit\nmore work during the day if you start\nmeditating if you start walking and and\nand managing your emotions if you start\njournaling if you start exercising if\nyou start eating healthy in the right\nway your stress will naturally come down\nwe've covered stress relief in so many\nother places across the channel so\ndefinitely check that stuff out but as\nlong as you stressed out it will be\ndifficult to sleep so let's end with one\nfinal thing so one last tip that I would\ngive yall is waking up when you're tired\nis easier neuroscientifically than going\nto bed when you're not so the biggest\nmistake that a lot of people make is\nthat sleep is not about going to bed on\ntime it is about waking up on time or\neven waking up very early so the the\nlast tip that I'm going to give yall is\nthat you should wake up sometime between\n4:00 a.m. and 7: a.m. 7:00 a.m. is the\nlate end of when you should wake up now\nwhy is this the first is that we have\nsomething called a circadian rhythm\nwhich is our body's biological clock and\nwe actually have a very high level of\ncortisol early in the morning so\nmedically when we're trying to test\nwhether someone has a cortisol\ndeficiency or a cortisol tumor or\nsomething like that we will actually\nhave to do this this lab test we have to\ndo it at 700 a.m.\nwhy is that it's because we know that\nthere is a biological peak of cortisol\nearly in the morning so why do we want\nto wake up around that time so the first\nthing is if we wake up around that time\nour ability to work will be easier\nbecause we naturally have a high level\nof cortisol which means we will be\nactivated our body will be in a\nstressful state it doesn't feel\nstressful because it's first thing in\nthe morning that's the beautiful thing\nbut it it allows us to focus and and\nreally complete tasks so what we really\nwant to do is wake up around 5:30 in the\nmorning okay you're going to be groggy\nthat's okay don't drink coffee right\naway but you can have coffee or tea or\nwhatever do whatever you need to to wake\nup early and then we want to get to work\nright away the first 4 hours of the day\nwake up at 5:00 a.m. and work until 9:00\nif you do this so many things will get\nbetter your brain will be like okay\nwe've gotten all of the work that we\nneed to do in the day like you'll be\ncrazy it's crazy how productive you will\nbe in the morning now some people will\nsay but I'm not a morning person I'm a\nnight owl so in my experience a lot of\nnight owls aren't actually night owls\nthey are very early morning people right\nso they their Windows of work that start\naround midnight or whatever like that's\nactually okay you can wake up at 2: a.m.\nno big deal a lot of monasteries and\nasham will have people wake up around\nmidnight so if you look at matens which\nI think is a Catholic Ceremony they\nactually wake up at midnight they go to\nbed at like 6:00 p.m. 5:00 p.m. and they\nactually wake up at midnight that's\nactually totally fine you want to wake\nup super early and get some stuff done\nyou're going to have this cortisol Peak\nwhich will help you do the work if you\nwant to caffeinate go ahead and\ncaffeinate have a really solid breakfast\naround 9: and then here's where the\nreally important thing comes in when\nyou're feeling tired you don't go to\nsleep right so then you have to stay up\nuntil whatever your natural bedtime is\n6:00 p.m. 7: p.m. 8:00 p.m. I don't care\nyou can fall asleep at any time between\n6:00 and 10: p.m. don't stay up past\nyour inhibition window right so if we\nget that that frontal lobe fatigue then\nyou're going to be in trouble try to\navoid caffeine afternoon ideally avoid\ncaffeine after 10: a.m. so what we want\nto do it's going to be a real struggle\nbut if you can sort of readapt to this\nschedule which is sort of biologically\nthere's millions of years of evolution\nthat are supporting you and doing this\nyou'll be really good so you want to\nwake up early and then the other thing\nto consider is that we want to observe\nDawn and observe dusk okay so when we\nobserve Dawn it sends all these signals\nto our brain that hey it's like time to\nwake up and then when we observe dusk\nit's like our brain is closing the book\nright so kind of like opening the book\nand closing the book as we observe dusk\nso you want to be outside or at least\nhave access to a window during Dawn and\ndusk this will send a lot of positive\nbeneficial signals to your brain and\nyour body that it's time for bed\nmillions of years of evolution will be\nsupporting you and if we look at the\nproblem in sleep schedules the problem\nin sleep schedules is that in our\nsociety today we have gotten rid of all\nof the things that induce sleep right we\nstay in this room these four walls we're\nnot in tune with the sun we sleep at any\nrandom time we wake at at any random\ntime we eat at any random time we\nsuppress our emotions we don't do our\nwork we procrastinate all the time we\nhave such good tools for procrastination\nwe miss this fatigue window where it's\nactually capable where you're actually\ncapable of going to sleep we add an\nextra 75 minutes of procrastination time\nso everything we're doing is not aligned\nwith actually sleeping all of the\nfunctions of sleep are not things that\nwe're doing we don't exercise we don't\nuse our body and so our brain and our\nbody utilize sleep to to fix all of\nthese things and if we don't do all of\nthose things no wonder it is difficult\nto sleep so fixing your sleep schedule\nis about understanding why do we sleep\nwhat is the function of sleep and then\nleaning into that function the more that\nyou do the things that sleep is designed\nto compensate for the stronger the\nbiological signals that will will allow\nyou to sleep now the last point is\ntechnology right so if y all haven't\nfigured it out you must regulate your\ntechnology use but this becomes way\neasier when you do everything else so\nabsolutely avoid your cell phone before\nyou go to bed recognize that if you have\nany access to a technological device for\n1 hour in your sleep window it will be\nlonger than an hour you'll miss that\nwindow and your s so so wake up early\nyou know eat solidly do some work\nexercise then you're saying but Dr K I\nhave to transform my life absolutely if\nyou transform your life sleep will come\neasily and this is what I've seen in 90%\nof my patients right is that as we start\nfix ing their life now sleep becomes\nnatural it becomes easy I used to\nstruggle so much going to sleep in my\n20s it's so easy for me to sleep now I\nhit the pillow and done and this is what\nI've seen in most of my patients and you\ncan do it too you just must have the\nright kind of life for the right kind of\nsleep and if you want to sleep a full\nnight then you need have to have a life\nthat demands that you sleep a full night\nso give this a shot and I can't\nguarantee that it'll work but I've seen\nit very consistently and you'll be\namazed at how well it works B\n[Music]"
