    "transcript": "today I want to talk to you all a little\nbit about why you can't gain confidence\nso a lot of people out there will\nstruggle to gain confidence and there'll\neven be people out there who will sort\nof give them lots of solutions right so\nyou'll have people like dating coaches\nwho'll be like yeah if you want to you\nwant to gain confidence you got to get\nout there right you got to ask out a\nbunch of women or men or whatever and\nthe more that you do it the more\nconfidence you'll gain I want to take a\nmoment to thank our HD coaches I've\ntaught it a lot of different places and\nworked with a lot of different people\nand honestly our coaches are some of the\nbest people I've ever worked with he\ncoaches have helped over 10 000 people\nfind purpose Direction and improve their\nmental health after about 20 weeks of\ncoaching the average client experiences\na 58 Improvement in sense of purpose in\nlife a 45 Improvement in feelings of\nanxiety and even a 35 reduction in\nfeelings of Despair and this isn't just\nme saying this at this point we've done\nthis for three years run six research\nstudies and even presented our findings\nat the American Psychiatric association\nNational Conference over one hundred\nthousand sessions later I can\nconfidently say this works so if you're\ninterested in checking out he coaching\nfor yourself go to healthygamer.gg\ncoaching to learn more but sometimes\nthat's not actually our experience right\nlike we go out there we ask out a bunch\nof women we get rejected a lot and\nsomehow like with each rejection our\nconfidence doesn't build it kind of\nstarts to Crater more and more and more\nand so then we're kind of left with this\nsort of idea like okay what am I\nsupposed to do to gain confidence\nbecause a lot of people out there are\nsaying oh yeah just get out there and\nyou'll get more confident you gotta\npractice right and there'll be a lot of\npeople out there who will say yeah it\nworked for me this is how I gain\nconfidence and you just gotta keep at it\nbro you got to keep at it like practice\nmakes perfect\nbut sometimes it doesn't seem to work\nand I completely understand why it\ndoesn't seem to work because bizarrely\nyou can't actually gain confidence I\nwould almost go as far as saying it's\nimpossible to gain confidence\nand that may sound really bizarre but\nhear me out\nso the reason you can't gain confidence\nis because confidence is actually the\ndefault state\nwhat you gain over time is insecurity so\nthe problem with gaining confidence is\nthat we're all trying to get something\nwhen actually what we need to do is let\nsomething go\nthe solution to quote unquote getting\nback to confidence or being confident\nisn't to gain confidence it's to unlearn\ninsecurity\nso let me explain what I mean so if you\nthink about it like think about a child\na child's default state is actually\nconfidence right like if you look at\nlike a two-year-old like two-year-olds\ndon't have insecurity problems chances\nare right and we'll get to the situation\nin which they do two-year-olds are like\nthey're Babel like a one-year-old is\nlike babbling like they don't care what\npeople think like they're just they\ncan't even talk they can't walk they\ncan't feed themselves they can't even\nuse the bathroom they don't know how to\nwipe their ass and like oh my God these\nlittle pathetic little human beings they\ncan't do anything they're not Alphas for\nsure right actually maybe they're a\nlittle bit Chad you know depends on the\none-year-old but the truth of the matter\nis like kids can't do anything like a\ntoddler like they can do anything and\nyet they're supremely confident right\nanother good example of this is you can\nlook at animals so what is like an\nanimal's Natural State like if you've\ngot a dog and like if a dog is like\npretty normal and has a normal life like\nwhat's gonna happen they're gonna be\nconfident they're happy they like human\nbeings they're going to walk up to you\nthey're going to you know wag their tail\nthey want to be petted they want to play\nwith you and so if you really look at\nthe default nature of things it is\nactually including human beings is to be\nconfident\nand so then the question becomes okay\nwell then why do people lose confidence\nit's not about gaining it's that they\nlose it well that's because they're\ntaught in security so now let's go back\nto the one-year-old or the five-year-old\nor maybe you nine-year-old 10 year old\n15 year old think about high school\nright you used to be confident and then\nwhat happened as you hit puberty you had\nparticular experiences that caused you\nto lose confidence you were 12 and you\nwere like on top of the world and then\none day you walked in to school except\nyour water bottle was leaking in your\nbackpack and since your water bottle was\nleaking in your backpack there was a wet\nstain on your bum and then everyone\nlaughed at you and then suddenly you\nbecame insecure they started making fun\nof you and then your confidence went\ndown into the pits and now you have\ngained insecurity\nso the reason that people can't go out\nand gain confidence is because\nconfidence isn't gained it's actually\nlost\nthis is really important to understand\nand there's a ton of research to support\nthis if you look at people who have low\nself-esteem the correlation with Ace or\nadverse childhood experiences is very\nvery very high if you look at people who\nhave major depressive disorder there's\nnow a kind of Forefront hypothesis that\nmajor depressive disorder is not caused\nby serotonin imbalance but is actually\ncaused by adverse childhood experiences\nwe sort of know that trauma leads to a\nlack of self-confidence and so we really\nkind of think about it now we can start\nto see why gaining confidence is so hard\nbecause it's not about acquiring\nsomething that we don't have it's\nactually about offloading something that\nwe picked up and so the reason it's hard\nto find confidence or gain confidence we\ngo out looking into the world we go to\nthis place we go to that place I'm going\nto go to this seminar I'm going to go to\nthis Workshop I'm going to do this kind\nof success gurus thing I'm going to work\nwith a dating coach I'm going to read\nthis book about finding confidence we're\ngoing to do all these things to gain\nconfidence and we'll get to why some of\nthose things can work towards the end\nbut we can kind of see why it doesn't\nwork because it's not something that's\ngained it's something that you actually\nyou have to unlearn insecurity\nso then the question kind of becomes\nokay so how do I unlearn insecurity all\nwe're really asking you to do is return\nto your Baseline you don't have to do\nanything special you just have to get\nrid of the crap that you accumulated\nAcro along the way\nso this is where I think there's a very\nuseful Concept in Sanskrit called the\nsamskar so a samskar is like an\nundigested ball of emotion or what I\nwould kind of call like a nugget of\ntrauma so if we look through our life\nwhat we tend to find is that we were\nconfident and there are these singular\nexperiences that are almost these tiny\nnuggets of trauma that will kind of sink\ninto our mind and change the way that we\nview ourselves\nin cognitive behavioral therapy these\nare this is related to something called\nthe concept of a core belief right\nbecause when you go to high school and\neveryone makes fun of you and then they\ncall you\nwet butt or whatever right you get some\nkind of nickname that then forms a\nbelief and each time someone makes fun\nof you and calls you wet butt then what\nhappens is that there's another nugget\nof trauma that gets inserted into your\nmind and another one in another one in\nanother one and so over time what\nhappens is these trauma these little\nteen nuggies grow in your mind and they\nstart to become something that you\nbelieve about yourself right because you\nget all of this external input and then\nyou internalize those feelings you can\nalso see that in cases of like abusive\nrelationships where you have a child\neven as young as one-year-old\nwho grows up in a household where their\nparents were never satisfied with them\nright so like I grew up in an Asian\nhousehold so this was really common\nwhere like my value as a human being was\nalways comparative so it was like you\nknow it didn't matter that I got an A\nWhat mattered is even if I got a 91 and\nthat was an a if some other kid got a 99\nlike why couldn't I get a 99\nso this is where over time we actually\nstart getting imbued with insecurity and\nso if we want to go back to confidence I\ndon't think achieve confidence is the\nright idea what we actually have to do\nis a process of unlearning and so this\nis what Psychotherapy is about right so\none way to do this is you can go see a\npsychotherapist and especially if you\nhave trauma that rises to the level of\nlike a diagnosis and if you're not sure\ndoes it rise to the level of a diagnosis\nlike that's what a professional can help\nyou figure out right you can go see a\nprofessional they can diagnose you with\na trauma-based disorder or not\nbut this is what we do in psychotherapy\nbut the cool thing is that the majority\nof this work actually does not get done\nin Psychotherapy most human beings over\nthe course of their life will gain some\namount of confidence and like start to\nbelieve different things about\nthemselves right like we become secure\nin our own skin and so what we're going\nto do is walk you all through a little\nbit about what that process looks like\nso I'd start with the question when was\nthe last time you were confident okay\nbecause most of us I'd say 90 to 95 of\npeople I've worked with have been\nconfident at some point in the last five\nto ten percent sometimes they they were\nactually in traumatic experiences before\nthey can remember so we're talking about\nsix months old one-year-old two-year-old\nbut that's really the exception rather\nthan the rule\nso think about the last time you were\nconfident and think about what happened\nthat changed right so if you kind of say\noh yeah I was confident when I was nine\nbut by the time I was like 13 I wasn't\nconfident anymore and then what you'll\ndo is if you ask yourself\nwhat happened in the middle chances are\nyou've got a very powerful emotional\nexperience somewhere in there and you\nwill remember it really well and if\ny'all watch our interviews you'll see\nthat people will recall like specific\nthings that happened to them when they\nwere 10 when they were 11 when they were\n13. and these are the formation of a\nsamskar this is the formation this is\nthe Nugget of trauma that gets inserted\nnow what happens when when we kind of\nenter into the state\nis that there's a pile of emotions so\nthe first thing is that these are\nusually very emotionally charged\nexperiences\nand then the second thing that happens\nis we don't really process those\nemotions right so if you really think\nabout getting called wet butt because\nyour butt was wet the real way to\nprocess that is hey accidents happen\nsometimes water bottles are defective it\ndoesn't mean anything about me right\nlike I'm actually not incontinent I'm\nnot like pathetic and you know like I\ndon't pee in my pants this is literally\nthe reality of it was that a water\nbottle leaked and hey that happens\nsometimes but if you really think about\nthat child in that moment that's not the\nbelief that you come away with that\nemotion is so powerful that it leads you\nto believe that you are pathetic even\nthough the kids were wrong right like\nthe kids weren't even right like you\ndidn't even do anything wrong and I\nwould say that in 90 of people that I've\nworked with the beliefs that they have\nabout themselves are not actually\nrealistic and what do I mean by\nrealistic I mean that they're not based\nin reality so even if you look at\nsomeone who lacks confidence and is a\nhundred percent sure that they are worth\nnothing that's because they had a\nnarcissistic parent who was emotionally\nimmature and would displace all of their\nanger and frustration onto the child the\nchild actually didn't do anything wrong\nright that's the whole point behind\ntraumatic relationships is that people\ndon't deserve the way that they were\ntreated\nand so this is the real tricky thing is\nthat we end up accumulating these\nbeliefs about ourselves that are from\nhighly charged emotional situations that\nwe carry forward with us and we start to\nmake conclusions we get conditioned to\nbelieve particular things because that\nnugget of trauma sinks deep into our\nmind and then causes us to form an idea\nabout who we are and we carry that\nforward and then what happens is we go\nout we go see a dating coach or we go to\nthis thing or we go do that thing\nto try to gain confidence but the\nproblem is that as long as this belief\nabout myself deep down is in there I can\ngo see as many dating coaches as I want\nto but like talking to a thousand women\nwon't kind of Matt I mean it can matter\nbut as long as I don't deal with that\nnugget of trauma that's deep inside my\nmind that some scar you know the rest of\nthat stuff is like kind of barking at\nthe up the wrong tree so what we really\nneed to do is go back and re-examine\nthose experiences right and\nre-contextualize them think a little bit\nabout how how I felt in that moment and\nthis is the other really tricky thing\nabout these experiences is that the more\npowerful the emotion is the more it\nsinks in but the really tricky thing is\nthat the more powerful the emotion is\nthe more incorrect our conclusion about\nourselves will be because we didn't form\na judgment about ourselves based on\ncareful thought and consideration from a\ncalm mind right we're very very\nemotional so that deeper it sinks the\nlonger it is and this is the problem\nwith the samskar and this is why you can\ngo look for confidence outside in the\nworld as much as you want to but until\nyou as long as you're carrying that\nnugget of trauma around\nit's going to be really hard to find\nconfidence\nand so what do we do with this nugget of\ntrauma so we go into a lot more detail\nin for example Dr K's guide or our\ncoaching program this is what our\ncoaches are kind of really good at is\nthat they're they're good at sort of\nhelping people dig back and understand\nwhere they form their beliefs about\nthemselves and then like use that\nunderstanding to actually engage in\npositive behaviors moving forward they\nreally focus on that latter part and if\nyou've really been kind of traumatized\nI'd highly recommend you see a therapist\nbut if you're really focused on I have\nsome belief about myself or I have\nsomething internal that holds me back\nfrom moving forward then coaching may be\na better fit\nbut even today we're going to talk you\nall through the basic theory that we\nshare with our coaches and that we sort\nof use in this community in this in Dr\nK's guide\nso you kind of think about that\nexperience then you kind of analyze it\nright so what did you feel in that\nmoment what were the beliefs that you\nformed about yourself and now this is\nthe key thing looking back on it now\nwhat were some more appropriate\nconclusions that you could have drawn\nand as you kind of do that you'll start\nto realize oh my God actually it wasn't\nmy fault that people called me pathetic\nI actually didn't even do anything wrong\nand then a couple of things will happen\nthe first is that you're gonna feel like\nreally really sad and feel a ton of\ngrief and you got to be ready for that\nbecause what that means is that for the\nlast 10 years of your life you've been\ncarrying around a belief about yourself\nthat isn't even true and you've suffered\nso much\neven though you didn't deserve it and\nthat in and of itself can hurt a lot and\nwhen we start working with some scars or\nthese nuggets of trauma we can have\nthose kinds of experiences so let that\ngrief come and if you want to if you can\nlet yourself cry because here's the\nbeautiful thing when you cry that's our\nphysiologic way of processing that\nemotion and the more that we cry\nactually this is beautiful the less\npowerful that belief becomes and the\nmore we will actually get closer to\nconfidence\nyou don't necessarily need to cry but if\nwhatever emotions come up as you kind of\nre-examine that stuff just let them come\nup right and sit with it\nand then we're going to move on to the\nnext part which is really really\nimportant which is what we want to do\nnext is now as you start to move forward\nin life\nit as you try to engage in particular\nbehaviors what's going to happen is that\nnugget of trauma is going to surface the\nsamscar will surface and as you go to a\nparty there will be a little voice in\nyour head that says hey you're not worth\nbeing friends with hey people don't like\nyou this is a lesson that you learned\nand that's what a lack of confidence\nlooks like right it manifests in the\nmoment and tells you something about\nyourself it says hey these other people\ncan do this but you can't because they\nare this way and you were this way and\nso what you'll see is these lessons that\nyou learned early in life will manifest\nin your mind and will prevent you from\nactually acting and then you can\nstruggle with that lack of confidence\nsometimes you can overcome it sometimes\nyou can't right that's the experience of\nit so the next thing that we need to do\nis when that lack of confidence surfaces\nwe need to pause don't fight it don't\novercome it don't conquer it just sit\nwith it and say hey okay hold on a\nsecond\nhere's that lack of confidence here's\nthat feeling and this is what if you pay\nattention this is what it's going to be\nthe feeling that you feel in that moment\nis going to be an echo of what you felt\nthat day that you walked in to school\nit'll be an image an echo a mirror it'll\nbe like a little piece of that it's that\nemotional energy that is unprocessed and\nstored in your mind\nand as it's unprocessed and stored in\nyour mind it'll come up again\nand now what you need to do is realize\nhey hold on a second what My Mind Is\nTelling Me In This Moment isn't actually\ntrue this is just the echo from the\ntrauma of the past this is the\nconclusion that I learned from this\ninappropriate kind of scenario right so\nit's an inappropriate conclusion and as\nyou notice it in the moment\nit takes practice but hopefully what\nwill start to happen is it's power over\nyou a lesson as you notice oh hold on a\nsecond it's not that I'm actually not\nworth being friends with this is just\nthe echo from the past that made me\nbelieve\nthat I'm not worth being friends with\nthen you kind of acknowledge it in the\nmoment you can you can kind of ask\nyourself hey In This Moment Like can I\nset this belief about myself aside can I\nactually try to enjoy the time that I'm\nabout to spend with these people\nand even that noticing in the moment\nalso leads to digestion of that emotion\nand so if you do these two things if you\nkind of like process the emotion kind of\nsitting by yourself in your room\nwhatever or if you catch it in the act\nand acknowledge it for what it is if you\nsee it it'll start to diminish and the\nBeautiful Thing is as you do this over\nand over and over again\nthat nugget of trauma will start to get\ndigested and as the Nugget of trauma\nstarts to get digested you will\nnaturally feel confident you didn't\nactually have to go out and gain it what\nall you have to do is just be yourself\nyou're going to feel free you're going\nto feel normal you're going to feel\nnatural and that's when confidence comes\nback\nnow one last thing that I kind of want\nto touch on is but what about all these\npeople who will say go out and build\nconfidence\nso usually what happens in those\nsituations is as you go out into those\nscenarios that emotion will come up once\nagain\nand in the process of engaging with that\nemotion in the present\nyou can actually get some amount of\ndigestion there as well the reason that\nI prefer this methodology and the reason\nthat for example in our coaching program\nwe don't actually Advocate that you know\npeople go out there and like\nre-traumatize themselves over and over\nand over again because that's the\nproblem with just going out there right\nis that if you're lucky you'll those\nfeelings will come up you'll recognize\nthem you'll grow through it you can\nabsolutely do that right you can realize\noh that these people aren't rejecting me\nfor me they're rejecting me because they\nhave their own problems some people go\ndown that route the problem with just\ngoing out there is that sometimes it\nactually enhances the trauma even more\nand I've seen this for example with like\nbad parenting where like oh like someone\nhas a phobia of dogs so I'm going to\ntake my kid and I'm going to dump him in\na pen with a dog and they'll overcome\nthe fear right and sometimes that works\nin terms of overcoming the fear and\nsometimes it traumatizes people that's\nwhy we much prefer this method because\nthe real battle is like internal right\nyou don't actually have to re-traumatize\nyourself in order to overcome the trauma\nyou can actually confront those inner\ndemons and you want to expose yourself a\nlittle bit right so you want to go into\nthose situations where the samskar is\nevoked and then you can kind of like\nnotice it but you don't need to like\nhardcore re-traumatize yourself to\novercome your trauma because for some\npeople that works really well if they're\nresilient enough and for other people it\njust cripples them worse\nso I know it sounds kind of bizarre but\nthe truth of the matter is that the\nreason that it's hard to gain confidence\nand the reason that going out there and\ngaining confidence works for some people\nand is traumatic for others is because\nyou can't really gain it\nall you can do is lose it and if you\nwant to go back to being confident it's\nnot about going out there and finding it\nit's about actually unlearning the\ninsecurity and that is done through sort\nof digesting a some SCAR or sort of\nprocessing this nugget of trauma"
