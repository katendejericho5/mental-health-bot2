    "video_title": "What Are Gender Based Constructs Of Mental Illness? @ludwig",
    "transcript": "we have gender-based constructs of\nmental illness so women are more likely\nto be diagnosed with anxiety because our\ndefinition of anxiety was developed more\nby looking at women and anxiety\nmanifests differently in men sociopathy\nmanifests is physical aggression in men\nbut does not manifest his physical\naggression in women women use something\ncalled indirect aggression way more than\nmen relatively but even more men will\nuse indirect aggression than women and\nit gets complicated but this was\nactually inspired by a woman in\nCommunity who posted about being bullied\nby other women and I realize like this\nis a huge problem and like no one talks\nabout woman-on-woman bullying dof it\nhappens a lot it happens so much right\nbut we don't talk about it publicly\nbecause if you make a statement like oh\nwomen are aggressive the manosphere will\neat that up and they'll say oh women are\nall bad and all this kind of stuff so I\nthink that there's a hesitance to talk\nabout female aggression and the real\npity here is that women are much more\nlikely to be bullied by other women"
