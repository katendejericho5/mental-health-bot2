    "transcript": "the biggest mistake that I see a lot of\npeople who have relationships with BPD\nmake is that they hate the lows so we're\ntotally fine getting rid of the lows but\nwe don't want to get rid of the highs\nright like dude when a woman tells me\nthat the only thing in life that will\nfix all the trauma is my dick that's\nreally addictive because we're men and\nlike we our self-esteem is based on the\nperformance of our penis or sinus of our\npenis or whatever so one of the key\nthings that I found working with people\nwith BPD and people who are dating BPD\nis that you can't give in to the highs\nas well so if there's something super\namazing that you all are about to engage\nin you need the same amount of restraint\nwhich is something that in society we\nnever talk about but the key thing in\nBPD is that we don't want to be reactive\nright we don't want to follow the yoyo\nwhen it's on its own we don't ride the\nroller coaster all the way up because as\nsoon as we go all the way up there's\ngonna be a plunge right so we want to\nstay as neutral as possible"
