    "transcript": "the second thing about video games that\nis really interesting is that if you\nlook at our sense of identity video\ngames let us create our own sense of\nidentity and this is something that\nwe've seen I've worked with people who\nare let's say high school students who\nare maybe 15 years old maybe they're a\nlittle bit overweight they're going\nthrough puberty their voice is starting\nto change they have acne and they feel\nreally embarrassed about who they are in\nreal life but in the video game they get\nto be whoever they want to be they don't\nget judged on how much they weigh or how\nthey look they get to invent an identity\nand so what we've discovered is that\ngaming allows us to invent an identity\nthat we can be really proud of and that\nbecomes a problem because at some point\nwe become more proud of the person that\nwe are online as opposed to the person\nthat we are in real life and then we\nstart to retreat more and more into the\nvideo game and we sort of lose sight of\nwho we are in real life and then we get\nreally stuck because I fall further and\nfurther behind in the real world but I\nkeep advancing in the virtual world"
