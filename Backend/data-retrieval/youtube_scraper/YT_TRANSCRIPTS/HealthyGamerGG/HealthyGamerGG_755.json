    "transcript": "every year that goes by it's harder and\nharder to be a good Asian kid\n[Music]\nand chances are your parents actually\ndon't care if you look at things across\nthe board it's harder to be at the top\nof your class it's harder to get\nstraight A's it's harder to get into\ngood colleges all kinds of jobs are\nactually getting more and more\ncompetitive now like so it used to be\nthat you needed a good degree from an\nIvy League institution to get a job at a\ntop tier company like Google but now you\nactually don't even need a college\ndegree and so Asian kids in particular\nare kind of getting crunched and we're\nseeing this in the form of a mental\nhealth crisis for Asian kids the\nsimplest way that this is manifesting is\nincredibly High suicide rates people\nbetween the ages of 20 and 24 for most\nAmericans it's actually accidents that's\nthe number one cause of death but since\nAsian kids are so freaking careful right\nyou guys are not going to put yourselves\nin accident-prone situations so actually\nthe most the thing that you have to be\nthe most careful around is yourself\nsuicide rates are incredibly high and\nthat's just one manifestation of the\nAsian American Mental Health crisis so\nlet's take a look at how some of these\nthings in intersect and we're going to\nstart off by looking at is it actually\ngetting harder to be a successful Asian\nkid and this is where unfortunately the\nanswer is yes so we're going to take one\nsimple statistic so if you look at\nMedical College admissions tests amongst\nethnicities what you find is that if you\nwant to get into med school in the U.S\nand you're an Asian kid you have to\nscore in the top 23 percent of pre-med\nstudents so you have to be in the top 23\nout of 100 to actually get into medical\nschool if you're Caucasian you still\nhave to be in the top maybe 30 to 35\npercent of students who are applying to\nmedical school if you're Latino you\nactually have to be you can be in the\nbottom half so you have to be in the top\n54 percent which means that you just\nhave to outperform\n46 other students out of a hundred and\nif you're black or African-American you\nhave to be in the top 73 which means you\njust have to beat 23 out of 100 kids to\nget into med school I want to take a\nmoment to thank our hdq coaches I've\ntaught it a lot of different places and\nworked with a lot of different people\nand honestly our coaches are some of the\nbest people I've ever worked with he\ncoaches have helped over 10 000 people\nfind purpose Direction and improve their\nmental health after about 20 weeks of\ncoaching the average client experiences\na 58 Improvement in sense of purpose in\nlife a 45 Improvement in feelings of\nanxiety and even a 35 reduction in\nfeelings of Despair and this isn't just\nme saying this at this point we've done\nthis for three years run six research\nstudies and even presented our findings\nat the American Psychiatric association\nNational Conference over 100 000\nsessions later I can confidently say\nthis works so if you're interested in\nchecking out he coaching for yourself go\nto healthygamer.gg coaching to learn\nmore now I'm not saying that this policy\nis necessarily bad so there are a lot of\nthings that go into being a good doctor\nand forming a good application for\nmedical school and I'll be the first one\nto say that I think it's a great idea to\nhave a lot of people in medical school\nwho are not necessarily great test\ntakers there's a lot more to being a\ndoctor than taking a test at the same\ntime though I think it's really\nimportant to acknowledge that if you\nlook at it objectively if you're an\nAsian kid who's applying to med school\nyou have to far out perform every other\nethnicity we're talking about some\nethnicities that can even be in the\nbottom half of applicants or even close\nto the bottom quarter of applicants and\nstill get into med school whereas you\nhave to be in the top 23 percent so\nobjectively\nachieving the goals that your parents\nMay set out for you or that you may set\nout for you is actually really hard the\nother problem that Asian Americans tend\nto deal with is this idea of a model\nminority myth and if you grew up as an\nAsian kid you kind of know that like\npeople are like oh so you're Asian that\nmeans you must be good at math but the\ntruth of the matter is that Asian\nAmericans or Asians in general are not\nlike better or worse at anything than\nany other ethnicity similarly it's not\nlike black kids are better or worse or\nsmarter or stupider than any other\nethnicity what we know from a ton of\ndata about ethnicity is that there's a\nlarge variation within the population\nand that a particular race is not\nassociated with any sort of particular\nperformance the challenge is that if\nyou're an Asian kid people measure you\nup and expect a lot more from you and\nthat puts a lot of pressure on us\nespecially when it comes from places\nlike our parents so we sort of know that\nAsian kids face a lot of this pressure\nand this leads to a lot of stress the\nproblem is that as Asian kids are facing\nall of this pressure to succeed and they\ndon't necessarily have particular\nadvantages at achieving that success\nthey get kind of crunched and it affects\ntheir mental health it's bad enough that\nAsian Americans may actually have\nobjective things going against them that\nmakes it hard for them to succeed but\nthe real problem is that from a cultural\nperspective and family perspective\noftentimes our parents actually don't\ngive a crap right they don't actually\ncare that your disadvantage when\napplying to medical school they just\nwant you to be a doctor and so now what\nwe're going to dive in to is some of the\nattitudes that result in this Asian\nAmerican Mental Health crisis the first\nthing that we're going to talk about is\na high pressure for Success so a lot of\nus have parents who expect a lot of us\nfrom us right they actually don't really\ncare about why we can't do something or\neven what we want to do they expect us\nto succeed kind of no matter what and if\nyou're an Asian kid it doesn't matter\nwhat your circumstances are it doesn't\nmatter what's going on in the world you\nshould succeed because I think you\nshould succeed now the next problem that\nwe tend to run into if you sort of look\nat Asian American cultures is that we're\nall about saving face so if you look at\nother people who struggle so everyone's\nfacing the same environment right so the\nworld is getting harder for everybody\nand then the question kind of becomes\nwell if the world is getting harder for\neverybody why is it that Asian American\nsuicide is it an all-time high and y'all\nare number one or we're number one right\nwe did it we're number one what's going\non there why is it that a harder\nsituation in the world is affecting\nAsian Americans specifically and that\nhas a lot to do with our culture and\nexpectations so we're going to dive into\nsome cultural beliefs that make it hard\nfor Asian Americans to get help and\ntherefore deal with all of the problems\nin the world the first thing is a very\nvery high Reliance on personal\nresponsibility right so like generally\nspeaking if you're an Asian kid or Asian\nAmerican if there's some problem in life\nlike you're responsible for fixing it\nlike especially if it's internal right\nbecause getting help for stuff like it's\nokay to get help for like math math\ntutoring so you can be at the top of\nyour class because go to Kumon class and\nwhatever right that's okay but any kind\nof personal deficiency that you have or\nany kind of struggle that you have first\nof all is equated to a personal\ndeficiency because if you didn't get an\nA that's your fault right forget about\nthe situation forget about the\nenvironment there's an emphasis on\npersonal responsibility for every thing\nso there's no appreciation for\nenvironmental struggles like your\nparents don't care that you're getting\nbullied your parents don't care that you\nneed glasses your parents don't care\nabout any of that stuff they don't care\nthat you have ADHD they don't care that\nyou have depression like that stuff\nisn't real like if there is a problem in\nyour life you should be able to fix it\non your own right so that's the first\nbelief that we've got to be super\ncareful about the second issue that's\nreally really concerning is a lot of\nAsian Americans and families care a lot\nabout saving face so this is also where\nif you're struggling first of all you've\ngot to fix it yourself and secondly you\nbetter not ask anybody else for help\nbecause what if people find out oh my\nGod you're depressed like you better not\nsee a therapist what if someone finds\nout that you you see a therapist what if\nsomeone you know what if you tell\nsomeone no oh my God that would be so\nembarrassing because if you were seeing\na therapist or if you were getting help\nfor problems that would reflect poorly\non us as parents that means that we're\nnot raising you right right this other\nkid down the street Lord that boy down\nthe street he's not in therapy and he is\ngetting A's and his parents smack him\nmore than I smack you like what is your\nproblem we can't let anybody know and so\nsince there is this emphasis on Saving\nFace it means that you can't go to other\npeople for help right because that's\nincredibly embarrassing it makes us look\nbad look what the hell is wrong with you\nnot only are you screwing up now you're\ngonna make us look bad that's a terrible\nidea and the last thing that is actually\nkind of really unfortunate is that from\nan Asian American culture oftentimes we\nonly care about fixing what we can see\nso Asian Asian parents especially like\nthey're totally fine getting you medical\ncare because there's a broken bone and\nthey can see that the bone is broken\nthey're totally fine getting you a math\ntutor because they can see the grade\nright it's a b instead of an A or a B\nplus instead of an A and like that's\nunacceptable but if you really look at\nAsian American parents and culture we\nreally prioritize things that we can see\nand the problem is that with a lot of\nmental health struggles you can't see\nthem right what does it look like from\nthe outside why are you so lazy get up\nyou should get up on time you need to be\nstudying more I don't care you should be\nsitting there at the desk and learn to\nconcentrate just focus just do it just\nfocus just do it if they can't see it it\nisn't real and this sort of puts Asian\nkids in an incredibly tough spot because\nit's difficult for you to have a\nlanguage to articulate what you're\nstruggling with and furthermore since\nyou can't show it to your parents they\ndon't take it seriously if you're\nhearing what I'm saying hopefully some\nof this stuff is resonating with you\nhopefully you sort of recognize that the\nworld is becoming a slightly more\ndifficult place maybe your parents are\nputting way too much responsibility on\nyou and that you feel a little bit\nembarrassed or even actively discouraged\nfrom seeking help so what do we do about\nthis situation before we get there I\nwant to start by sort of doing a little\ncognitive test so I'm going to say a\ncouple things and I want you to pay\nattention to your reaction okay the\nfirst thing is that hey it's okay to get\nhelp right like you don't have to live\nlife all on your own it's like totally\nfine for you to get help you should seek\nhelp you deserve help and pay attention\nto what your reaction is if you kind of\nagreed with me intellectually like yeah\nlike it is okay for people who are\nstruggling to get help it's not okay for\nme to get help I should be able to do it\non my own right like I get that Dr K is\nsaying that it's okay for people to get\nhelp but I should be able to do it on my\nown right I don't know if I really need\nhelp I don't know if I deserve help if\nthat was your reaction that's just a\nsign that you've been conditioned by\nthis sort of like Asian American culture\nor Asian culture to over rely on\npersonal responsibility okay so let's\ntry another one the world is objectively\ngetting harder right it's okay that\nyou're not as successful as maybe you\nquote unquote should be maybe actually\nthe level of success that you have right\nnow is appropriate maybe the reason that\nyou're not at the top of your class is\nbecause you genuinely have a very hard\nlife what's your reaction to that well\nlet's try this on precise yeah but other\npeople are able to do it right so hey\nyou're saying Dr K that the world is\ngetting harder but sejal is still able\nto get straight A's if your mind jumps\nto comparison and says oh but you're\nsaying that everything is getting harder\nfor everybody I should be doing better\nand how do I know I should be doing\nbetter because other people are doing\nbetter they're able to do it so why\nshouldn't I be able to do it if your\nmind jumps to comparison when I talk\nabout oh my God things are actually hard\nfor you and you say yeah but someone\nelse is able to do it that once again is\nAsian conditioning because what do Asian\nparents do this person is getting\nstraight a bad part isn't getting steady\nthis person is getting straight A and is\nwinner of chess tournament you got\nsecond place in chess tournament and\nsecond place in maths and they are\ngetting number one place in everything\nwhy can't you be like them\nand you can't say well maybe because\ntheir parents are emotionally supportive\nand actually help them instead of making\nthem feel small and want to kill\nthemselves but you can't say that right\nso that's test number two like what's\nyour reaction when I say hey the world\nis genuinely getting harder her and like\nmaybe it's you're actually doing pretty\nwell for your circumstances if you're if\nyou turn to someone else then like maybe\nthat's a sign that you've been\nconditioned in this negative way the\nlast thing that we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about is if I say okay you\nshould get help and let's say that you\nbypass the first two cognitive traps\nthen you're gonna kind of say well\nit's expensive right I don't really know\nhow do I know it's worth a fit right\nbecause this is the third thing I was\nonce reading a paper on Psychotherapy of\nAsian Americans specifically and there's\nthis really great quote where this one\ngirl is like every time I go to the\ntherapist all I'm thinking about is that\nthis is costing my parents five dollars\na minute every minute that goes by my\nparents are losing five dollars five\ndollars five dollars five dollars five\ndollars that's all I can think about the\nwhole time I'm there and am I using that\nfive dollars well enough\nso if you're thinking about if I tell\nyou to get help in your reaction as well\nlike I don't know if it's going to be\nworth it how do I know if it's worth it\nso let's think about that for a second\nbecause this I think is going to be\nrevealing so if you don't think that the\nhelp is worth it sometimes people don't\nthink that they their help is worth it\nbecause they don't deserve help like how\nmuch is this really going to help me is\nthis going to help me 10 20 30 I don't\nknow if it's worth it and this is what's\nreally tricky is like even if it isn't\nworth it do you deserve the help anyway\nlike is it worth it for you to go see a\ntherapist like do you deserve to feel\nbetter about yourself do you deserve for\nlife to be a little bit easier and this\nis actually what's so devastating is\nwhen we're raised in a culture that\nplaces our value as human beings on our\naccomplishments or relative to other\nhuman beings when your parents say you\nare worth less than this per this kid\ndown the street because they got a 4.0\nand you got a 3.9 that does something\nvery damaging to your self-esteem and\nonce you believe that you are not a good\nhuman being then you are less worth\ninvesting in right because if there's a\n4.0 kid who has a problem if he's at the\ntop of the class and number one in this\nand number one and this number one is\nthey're worth investing in right because\nthe return on your investment is going\nto be so high but if you're an ordinary\nAsian kid who has super ordinary\nexpectations on them then you are going\nto feel like any kind of help may not be\nworth it if you are worth more than it's\nworth more investing right makes perfect\nsense and this is actually what's so\ndevastating because this is what keeps\nAsian American kids from reaching out\nfor help because they're they're afraid\nthat they're not going to be worth\nenough it's not going to be help them\nenough\nand that's what's so devastating about\nit and so now the last question is okay\nso like what do we do about this right\nbecause we sort of know all kinds of\nstuff that there's Asian American Mental\nHealth crisis suicide rates are very\nhigh by the way if you look at\nstatistics on like Asian women for\nexample they are the number one buyer of\nself-help books right so when they have\na problem it's personal responsibility I\nshouldn't tell a damn Soul I'm gonna\norder something from the dark parts of\nthe internet on self-help and dealing\nwith depression and all this kind of\nstuff because no one can know so the\nfirst thing that I'm going to say is you\nshould get help and all of those\nproblems that we just talked about are\ngoing to crop up again you're going to\nhave those kinds of thoughts do I\ndeserve it oh like but what if it\ndoesn't work like all those kinds of\nthoughts are going to crop up the next\nthing to think a little bit about is I'm\ngoing to ask you a little bit about what\nyou want so what do you want from life\nbecause the challenge here is that if\nyou're an Asian kid what you want has\nbeen like serially beaten out of you\nyour entire life because if you're an\nAsian American kid if you're an Asian\nkid you grow up in a household and what\nyou want is like the least important\nthing in the universe so like if you\nwanted to learn bass guitar or saxophone\nlike\nwhat are you talking about kid it's like\npiano or violin like if you want to be a\nreal Rebel you can you learn the cello I\nguess it's like you gotta learn one\ninstrument you gotta do one extra\ncurriculum you gotta do math club Debate\nClub maybe and then you can learn one\nsport and they're approved Sports you\ncan't learn lacrosse you can be like a\ncompetitive swimmer you can learn tennis\nlike there are a couple of sports that\nyou can do but you can't do basketball\nthat's crazy soccer like I don't think\nso maybe maybe soccer there's the\npre-approved things and so your whole\nlife what you want has been knocked out\nof you and so what do Asian kids do they\nRebel in secret ways yeah my parents\nforced me to be an engineer but instead\nof actually studying I'm because I can't\nbring myself to study because I actually\ndon't want to be an engineer I'm going\nto just play League of Legends and sit\nin my basement all day right I'm gonna\nskirt by with bees and then my parents\nare gonna yell at me some and I'm not\ngonna say anything I'm gonna clam down\nI'm gonna become a shell of my former\nself and then once they stop yelling at\nme I'm gonna go back to school and I'm\ngonna try really hard to change my life\nand I'm Gonna Keep playing League of\nLegends so you're gonna have your quiet\nRebellion so how do we turn the ship\naround let's start by asking you what do\nyou want and the second question then\nbecomes okay if this is what you want\nare you willing to accept some help in\ngetting it because there is a ton of\nstress like are you okay accepting some\nhelp notice I didn't ask do you deserve\nhelp do you need help I'm not gonna ask\nthose questions because we know what the\nanswers are do you deserve help well\nother people don't deserve it so why\nshould I deserve it I don't deserve it\nbecause I got C's instead of A's and the\nkids who deserve help are the kids who\ndeserve anything are the ones who are\nthe model Asian kids and what about the\nneed question did I ask do you need help\nno of course not because if I ask you do\nyou need help what are you gonna say oh\nmy God it's so pathetic that I need help\nI better not tell a soul it's so\nincredibly shaming and we'd lose so much\nface if people knew that I needed help\nso we're not we're going to steal clear\nthose questions\nso the question that I'm going to ask\nyou is for the things that you want are\nyou willing to accept help how long do\nyou want to continue living this way\nright like is it worth it like you're\nnot accomplishing what your parents\ndreams which by the way is why they\nmanufactured you right is to be an\ninstrument of their dreams and you're\nnot living your own life like you're\ndisappointing them and your life sucks\nso are you willing to consider accepting\nsome help because the good news is that\nhelp helps a lot like if you're in this\nsituation I can say this from the bottom\nof my heart this is as an Asian kid who\nalmost failed out of college had less\nthan the 2.0 GPA and then you know was\nmy parents worst nightmare which is oh\nmy God my Outlook has a 1.9 GPA oh my\nGod it's going to fail and then a decade\nlater my alok is at Harvard oh my my God\nI did both and here's what I can tell\nyou from the bottom of my heart you\nabsolutely deserve help you should\nabsolutely get help because life isn't a\nsingle player game and the whole point\nis that your parents can place\nexpectations on you and even in their\nway it's not like they're trying to\nabuse you hopefully they're trying to\nhelp you in the way that they know how\nbut the culture weighs on them too so\nit's okay to get help so I'd say if\nyou're concerned like if you're having\nthoughts of suicidality or anything like\nthat you should absolutely go see a\ntherapist you know you should consider\ngetting evaluated for depression if\nthat's a concern for you anxiety if\nthat's a concern for you absolutely go\nsee a therapist and the point here is\nnot whether you need it or whether you\ndeserve it or things like that what I'm\ngoing to ask you is what do you want\nfrom life and do you want to continue\nliving this way if the answer to those\nquestions is no the answer is very\nsimple and if you're saying but I'm not\nmentally ill right some people are\nmentally ill and I'm not mentally ill\nwell like we recognize that right and so\nwhat I found is that a lot of Asian kids\nwould wind up in my office eventually\nespecially once I started doing things\non the internet they're like oh this guy\nunderstands me they'd come in and they'd\nbe terrified that I diagnosed them with\nmental illness and if they if they had a\nqualified diagnosis I would diagnose\nthem fair enough we'd start treatment\nbut what I actually found is that I\ncould help a ton of them too and that\nthey didn't necessarily need\nPsychotherapy or cognitive behavioral\ntherapy or exposure therapy or\nmedication does help me me and I need to\nstart medication no it doesn't but what\nI actually helped them do is like\ndiscover what they want discover what\nthey care about help them talk to their\nparents help them like learn new skills\nto navigate life and it's that piece\nthat we actually like and then more and\nmore Asian kids started reaching out to\nme and then I couldn't I was getting 10\n000 requests a month and that's like\nliterally why we started a coaching\nprogram because the problem with life is\nthat people need a lot of help because\nthe world is changing but not all help\nis therapy and it's okay to benefit from\nhelp it's okay to get help from people\nand it not be therapy and this is what's\nso tricky about a lot of Asian American\nKids is this is what's really bizarre is\nthere's one study I saw recently that\nshowed that over 50 percent of people\nwho are suicidal are not even mentally\nill and we're starting to learn a little\nbit more about suicide which is that a\nlot of people think about suicide when\nthey don't have a road forward to\naccomplishing their goals and so this is\nthe the bizarre thing is that even as an\nAsian-American your conceptions of what\nhealth is and I mean help is and what it\nmeans and what it indicates about you\nall of those can be wrong too so I'd\nstart by really asking yourself what do\nI want because chances are that's a\nvoice that you've turned all the way\ndown to mute your parents turned all the\nway down to mute do you want to continue\nliving the life the way that you're\nliving it now could it be better and\njust like you have a math tutor you can\nhave a mental health tutor I'd start I\ndefinitely start with a therapist if\nyou're considering suicidality but the\nyou know that's why like what's the\ntutor for your mind like what's the\ntutor for life that's like that's what\ncoaching is right so get some kind of\nhelp whatever it is and I'm not going to\nsay I was about to say you deserve it\nbut I'm not going to say that even\nthough you do but I know what that's\ngoing to do to you right you're gonna be\nlike ah I don't deserve it if I had\ngotten an a I would deserve it don't say\nthat Dr King don't imply that I have\ninternal self-worth that is not related\nto my accomplishments but seriously just\nlike who cares whether you deserve it or\nnot if it's going to help you go get it"
