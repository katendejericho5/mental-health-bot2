    "transcript": "So today we're going to talk about how\nto study as a gifted kid\nif you're a gifted kid you may have\nnoticed this pattern of what feels like\nyou ran into a wall in life for the\nfirst couple of years everything was\nsuper easy you went to school you didn't\nreally need to study you didn't need to\nreally work very hard you were getting\npretty good grades and then eventually\nthings started to get very very\ndifficult you got bored very easily you\nfelt really overwhelmed you started\nfalling behind and then what started to\nhappen is you tried to fix it right you\ntried to learn how to study you looked\naround at other people who were studying\nand you were like okay so I just need to\nread this textbook I just need to do\nthese worksheets and then I'll be fine I\nwant to take a moment to thank our HD\ncoaches I've taught it a lot of\ndifferent places and worked with a lot\nof different people and honestly our\ncoaches are some of the best people I've\never worked with he coaches have helped\nover 10 000 people find purpose\nDirection and improve their mental\nhealth after about 20 weeks of coaching\nthe average client experiences a 58\nImprovement in sense of purpose in life\na 45 Improvement in feelings of anxiety\nand even a 35 reduction in feelings of\nDespair and this isn't just me saying\nthis at this point we've done this for\nthree years run six research studies and\neven presented our findings at the\nAmerican Psychiatric association\nNational Conference over 100 000\nsessions later I can confidently say\nthis works so if you're interested in\nchecking out he coaching for yourself go\nto healthygamer.gg coaching to learn\nmore but for some reason when you sit\ndown to actually do that it doesn't\nreally work right either you get bored\nvery very easily or it feels like you're\ntoo far behind and you're not really\nsure what's going on and then you kind\nof end up abandoning it and so you kind\nof create this pattern of getting super\ninterested in something getting excited\nabout it investing some amount of time\nbut then eventually you kind of get\nbored or it starts to get too difficult\nand you're not really sure what to do\nand you look at other people who are\nactually able to like devote time and\nenergy to things and like build a\nfoundation and build up on that\nFoundation but it sort of feels like\nyour life is kind of like you know a\nhundred Wells that are dug one foot deep\ninstead of one well that's a hundred\nfeet deep and and the bizarre thing is\nthat you can sometimes come away from\nthis situation thinking oh okay this is\nbecause I'm lazy this is what most\ngifted kids conclude right I'm lazy\nthat's why I'm not successful I'm smart\nbut I'm lazy as it turns out it's not\nthat you're lazy it's that you were\nnever really taught how to study because\nfirst of all your brain is a little bit\ndifferent right so you're going to need\ndifferent techniques which you're going\nto share with you today and secondly\nthere are some things in your\ndevelopment that actually made it very\nhard for you your brain to really like\nlearn how to focus on a particular task\nso for me this this really became super\nclear when I was talking to my mom many\nmany years later and I kind of asked her\na little bit about like you know when I\nwas growing up like what you know I\ndon't remember you reading with me I\ndon't remember you kind of doing\nhomework with me you know I was kind of\nthinking about it and I was like can you\nhelp me understand a little bit about\nlike what was your parenting style and\nit sort of felt like my parents were\nuninvolved and her answer absolutely\nblew my mind but it made perfect sense\nand she's like well you were getting A's\nso I didn't think I needed to do\nanything right I mean you didn't seem to\nbe having any trouble at school you\nwould go to school you were like seven\nyears old you'd come home you'd get\nstraight A's on your report card so like\nwhy would I need to do something if you\nwere actually getting straight A's to\nbegin with and that's when it kind of\nclicked for me right so a lot of parents\nwhat they do is they don't intervene\nwith their kids they don't build habits\nfor their kids if your kid is doing\neverything right generally speaking is\napparent what you try to focus on is\nwhat your kid is doing wrong\nthen the problem runs into as we get\nolder right so you can learn like second\ngrade math or third grade math or you\nknow maybe even like pre-algebra kind of\non your own but then we sort of end up\nlearning like pre-calculus and calculus\nand that's when you can't just listen to\nOne lecture and absorb everything and\nknow everything but then when you sit\ndown to actually study calculus because\nwhat you start to do is you look at\nother people right it doesn't sink in\nyou start to feel a little bit\noverwhelmed so today what we're going to\ndo is teach y'all a sort of a method to\nlearn how to study as a gifted kid it's\nnot just studying necessarily it's also\nsort of this general idea of if you're\nif you're a smart kid who has trouble\nfocusing and gets bored very easily what\nare some techniques that you can use to\ntrain your mind to stay focused on\nsomething and really build a foundation\nand so these are techniques that I've\nused myself and I've talked to a lot of\npeople both as a tutor as an attending\nphysician as someone who works with a\nlot of like Gamers who are behind in\nlife and they really work really well so\nwe're going to sort of focus on three\nthings the first thing we're going to\ntalk about is a little bit about\nmotivation and how to retain Focus the\nsecond thing we're going to talk about\nis how to deal with boredom because\nthat's a huge problem and the third\nthing is we're going to lay out a lot of\nactually like details on how to study\nwhich I know it sounds kind of bizarre\nbut like chances are no one ever\nactually did that for you but if we can\nlay it out for you you'll be amazed at\nhow much you can actually progress so\nlet's start with the issue of motivation\nso gifted kids tend to run into a\ngeneral problem which is that either\nthey get bored really easily so they\nstop doing it or they feel way\noverwhelmed it feels way too difficult\nthey feel way far behind way too far\nbehind and so then they give up right so\nthe two problems of gifted kid is that\nyou're easily bored and you give up\neasily so let's try to understand a\nlittle bit about the science of\nmotivation so the first thing to\nunderstand is that if we look at the\nscience of motivation we know that to\noptimally motivate human beings we need\nto be in a state of something called you\nstress that's EU Dash stress so U stress\nis the opposite of distress and we\nactually want some amount of stress to\nfocus our minds and if you all play\ngames you'll understand this because if\nyou think about a boss fight right like\nyou can grind on normal enemies and that\ngets boring but then the boss fight is\nlike more exciting why is it more\nexciting why are we more engaged because\nit's actually more difficult so games\nare really good at sort of creating the\nsense of use stress where we're not\noverwhelmed but we're also it's not so\neasy that we're bored so as a gifted kid\nhow do we actually find that level of\neustress how do we take those boring\ntasks and I know this sounds kind of\nbizarre because this is probably\nsomething you've never tried to do and\nmake them more difficult and how can we\ntake those overwhelming tasks and break\nthem apart\njust one thing that I really learned\nthat may change your studying a lot\nwhich is I want you to stop studying to\nlearn and start studying to teach\nso this is super cool because when you\nthink about sitting down to study\nusually what your mind is going to do is\ngoing to it's going to say I have to get\nthrough these five chapters I have to do\nall these worksheets I have to do this I\nhave to do this there's sort of this\nidea that there's no enjoyment behind it\nright because you have to get through it\nbut instead what I want you all to do is\nstudy for the purpose of teaching\nsomeone else imagine that you've got a\ngroup of students that's going to come\nto you in 24 to 48 or 72 hours and you\nare going to have to teach this concept\nto them\nthat's going to engage a couple of\nreally interesting things the first is\nthat you're going to focus on conceptual\nlearning as opposed to getting through\nstuff and getting through stuff is\nincredibly boring the second thing that\nit's going to do is it's going to kind\nof like motivate you because it's\nactually a little bit harder you don't\nhave to do the bare minimum and if\nyou're a gifted kid right most of your\nlife you've been skating through doing\nthe bare minimum and what you really\nwant to do is you want to stop doing the\nbare minimum and how do you do that you\nstart studying to teach\nso the other cool thing is that as you\nstart studying to teach it's going to\nform all these conceptual learnings and\nyou're really going to have to master\nthe material then what happens is since\nyou've got a goal it's not getting\nthrough the chapter it's like okay do I\nneed to read this section of the chapter\nto be able to teach this concept yes or\nno and if you don't have to read it then\nyou can skip past it and you're kind of\nlike focused on kind of completing this\nquest which aligns a lot of your efforts\nand so this is the first thing that I'd\nstrongly strongly recommend that you\nkind of reframe from is don't try to get\nthrough the material try to tell\nyourself that you're kind of here to\nteach\nthat's also going to engage a couple of\nother interesting things the first is\nthat gifted kids generally speaking are\nreally good at helping other people like\nusually you won't do stuff for yourself\nbut you're actually totally fine helping\nother human beings\nand so that's going to sort of engage\nsome degree of focus and the other thing\nis it can be a little bit gratifying to\nthe ego which let's be honest sometimes\ngifted kids kind of need right so like\nwhat's going to happen is your ego you\nmay feel a little bit insecure you may\nfeel a little bit behind but if you can\nactually sort of do something that is\nmore aligned with your view of yourself\nit'll actually help you study more so\nthe first tip to really focus on\nmotivation is to study to teach instead\nof to learn so the second thing that\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\nis dealing with boredom now this is kind\nof a really tricky situation but\ngenerally speaking the first thing\nyou've got to accept as a gifted kid\nwho's trying to study or learn some\ntasks like learn to play music\ninstrument is that your mind will get\nbored so it's not about the avoidance of\nboredom it is about the management of\nboredom and to set appropriate\nexpectations around boredom\nso let's start by understanding okay\nwhat does it mean to be bored what is\nboredom in the mind so boredom is your\nmind's way of punishing you for not\nengaging in dopaminergic activities so\nyour brain is there and it's figured out\noh hey like this guy like we want some\ndopamine right so it's kind of like it's\nlike addicted to dopamine and what it's\ngoing to do if you don't give it the\ndopamine is it's gonna punish you and\nthe way it's going to punish you is it's\ngoing to make you feel bored so if you\nthink about what is boredom really it is\na stimulus seeking impulse so if we\nthink about Hunger Hunger is an\nunpleasant Sensation that prompts us to\naction right it's our body's way of\ntelling you hey I need food you should\ngo eat something and I'm Gonna Make You\nSuffer until you listen to what I say\nthirst is the same way right so that's\nthese are physiologic drives that punish\nus for a particular lack in our body and\nso what is the brain's equivalent or\nhung of hunger or thirst it's boredom so\nwhen it doesn't get at the dopamine that\nit wants it's going to send signals that\ninduce suffering and are going to push\nyou to do something so what we have to\nunderstand is that until our brain\nlearns to listen to us in the same way\nthat our bodies can learn to listen to\nus right because we don't need that\nsecond piece of chocolate cake we don't\nneed that fifth slice of pizza so we\nhave to get in charge but in order to\nget in charge what we really have to do\nis learn how to manage that boredom the\nway we're going to manage dealing with\nboredom actually has to do with our\nmethodology of studying and I don't know\nif anyone sat you down and taught you\nhow to study but that's kind of what\nwe're going to do now so the first thing\nthat I'd strongly recommend is that you\nuse something called the Pomodoro\nTechnique so the Pomodoro Technique is\nsort of based on some science but\nbasically is this technique where we're\ngoing to study for 20-minute increments\nso you don't have to study for an hour\nyou don't have to get through five\nchapters of a textbook you're gonna\nstudy for 20 minutes and then you're\ngonna take a five minute break and even\nif you feel like continuing to study\nafter those 20 minutes you are still\ngoing to take a break and why is this\npart really important because we don't\nwant your studying whether you study or\nnot study to be based on how you feel\nbecause this is the problem that gifted\nkids run into oh I'm excited about\nlearning quantum mechanics I feel\nexcited so I'm going to crack the\ntextbook and I'm going to start reading\nand now I feel bored so I'm going to\nclose the textbook and I'm going to open\nup a video game and I'm going to queue\nfor some MOBA or whatever right we want\nto stop having our brain listen to our\nfeelings so we're going to study for a\n20-minute segment which is one Pomodoro\nand then we're going to take a five\nminute break during that 20 minute\nsegment what we're really going to focus\non in terms of how to study is a concept\nor synthesis as opposed to getting\nthrough particular material so in this\n20 minute break which you sort of need\nto do is sit down and think a little bit\nabout okay what are the different things\nthat\nI want to focus on today so for this 20\nminute segment what I'm going to do is\nI'm just going to learn about let's say\nI don't know Newton's third law right so\nthis is I'm going to learn about as much\nas I can about Newton's third law so\nthen you've got your textbook you kind\nof flip through it you read a paragraph\nyou take some notes like whatever you\nend up doing but you're going to study\nfor 20 minutes and then you're going to\ntake a five minute break so there are a\ncouple of other things about boredom\nthat we really really really need to\nunderstand so the first is that when we\nget bored\nif we have an opportunity for a\nlong-term distraction then we're going\nto be in trouble so what we really want\nto do is we if we get bored for 30\nseconds and we pull out our phone like\nwe could lose five minutes 10 minutes 15\nminutes or an hour so we really need to\ndo is protect ourselves against that\nboredom we want to understand that okay\nin 20 minutes I'm gonna get to take a\nbreak so I just have to last for 20\nminutes and the other thing that you\nneed to be super careful about is\npre-lay out your resources so for that\n20 minute block what I want you to do is\nopen up all the tabs that you need get\nall the worksheets that you need find\nyour textbook get everything out because\nwhen do we slip up when we study is if I\nhave to open a new tab and I have to\nsearch for something and it goes to my\nhome page and a lot of apps and crapper\nlike now like oh like click this click\nthis click this click bait click bait\nyou're going to slip into clickbait so\nwhat you want to do to avoid boredom or\nhaving boredom take take advantage of\nyou is lay out all of your resources\nahead of time set a 20 minute Target and\nthen once you start you go the third\nthing that we're going to talk about\ntoday\nis how to study right so we're going to\ngo into more detail uh not just about\nthe boredom piece but what's our our\nsystem of studying so we talked a little\nbit about first of all focusing on\nsynthesis or concepts because that'll\nmake you feel less bored because you're\ngoing through less stuff right there's\nthere's a real Target\nso what we're going to do with synthesis\nor concepts is I strongly recommend\nphysically writing if you can so what I\nwhat I like to do is I'll take one piece\nof paper well I'll try to synthesize all\nof my Concepts right so you want to take\nkind of like one piece of paper that's\nNewton's third law and that's what\nyou're going to be focused on then as\nyou read as you do worksheets as you do\npractice questions everything is going\nto go synthesized into that piece of\npaper we're studying for one Pomodoro\nwe're already making all of our tabs and\nstuff ready and there are a couple of\nother tips about how to study\none thing that a lot of gifted kids\nnever actually do is review\nso this is some probably because we\ndidn't need to review right so when you\nwere learning\nhow to learn or maybe a better way to\nput it is when you were being\nconditioned on how to learn you never\nneeded review because everything just\nkind of sunk in and you were able to do\nit so what I'd strongly recommend is\nthat you sort of do one Pomodoro at a\ntime you do three pomodoros in one day\nthat's it right so when we're starting\noff you want to do 60 to 75 minutes of\nstudying a day and then what you want to\ndo the next day is spend one Pomodoro\nreviewing the work that you've done\nbefore okay so we want to do three\npomodoros a day\nspend at least the next day you want to\nspend at least one Pomodoro reviewing\nyour prior work the other thing that we\nreally want to do is control our\nenvironment so it can actually be very\nvery helpful for you to study at some\nplace like the library there are other\nthings that I'll do like studying tips\nthat I literally would do is I take my\nlaptop and I push it away from my desk\nwhen I was studying and I'd have my\nnotebooks in front of me because if you\nthink about it when you get distracted\nit's really easy to get distracted if\nyou have access to your keyboard and\neven now what I'll do is I'll take my\nkeyboard I have this fancy split\nkeyboard now but what I'll do is I'll\nI'll like literally like move the\nkeyboard away from me if I'm trying to\nwork and have access only to my mouse\nbecause it's really hard to like get\ndistracted on Reddit if I can't type\nReddit in so you want to create some\nphysical barriers around distractions as\nwell so you can go to the library you\ncan like move your keyboard away you can\npush your laptop physically away you\nwant to lay out all of your resources\nand you want to do three pomodoros at a\ntime\nthe last two things that we're going to\ntalk about I'd strongly strongly\nrecommend putting your phone on do not\ndisturb or even leaving it in a\ndifferent room and what to do when we\ntake breaks so when we take breaks our\nmost natural impulse is going to be to\npull out a piece of technology but don't\ndo that when we take breaks all we're\ngonna do is get up and walk around so\nfor five minutes you can drink water if\nyou want to you can walk around but no\ntechnology usage no mental stimulation\njust get up walk around for five minutes\nand this is what's really cool is\nif you walk around for five minutes\nyou're done walking you're done with\nyour break you're ready to stop doing\nyour break and going back to studying\nbut if you take a break by playing a\nvideo game what's gonna happen at the\nend of the video game you're going to\nwant to play another one so our break\ntime has to also be very carefully\nconstructed I know it sounds kind of\nbizarre but studying is something that\nyou can actually formally learn how to\ndo it's a skill just like meditating or\nlearning to ride a bike or even playing\na video game The Challenge is that if we\nare gifted kids\nthe what we run into is the situation\nwhere we never needed to learn the\nproper conditioning in terms of how to\nstudy right we weren't we never learned\nhow to study we didn't learn how to\nlearn\nand so now what we have to do is kind of\nbypass that and this is something that I\nhonestly discovered as a psychiatrist\nbecause I'd have gifted kids coming\ncoming into my office getting diagnosed\nwith depression and what I started to\nrealize is like I can do Psychotherapy\non them for depression as much as we\nwant but at the end of the day this kid\nis never going to feel good about\nthemselves unless they're actually able\nto like accomplish stuff\nand what I sort of noticed was that\ntreating these people for depression I\nactually started to teach them some of\nthese techniques and the Really bizarre\nthing is that these were things that\nwere not taught to me as a psychiatrist\nthere's not you know we learn about like\nbipolar disorder and and\nelectroconvulsive therapy no one ever\nteaches us hey here is how you teach a\nkid to be successful in life and by the\nway that deficiency is also why we\nstarted like HG coaching right because I\nsort of noticed that even if you're\nstruggling in life there are kind of two\nsolutions to struggling in life one is\nyou can see a mental health professional\nwhich is absolutely fantastic and they\ncan help you with depression and anxiety\nand all that kind of stuff but at the\nend of the day like who is going to\nteach you how to actually fix these\nskills and that's a huge part of our\nmission here at he right that's why we\nmade this video and if you all are\ninterested in something a little bit\nmore you can check out coaching but\nhonestly like this is where if you're a\ngifted kid\nit honestly isn't your fault that you're\nkind of behind and you don't know how to\nstudy because chances are you had a\nparent who is like mine who looked at\nyou when you were seven years old and\nlike my kid is not having a problem\ntherefore I don't need to do something\nbut if you had a parent like that and if\nschool was so effortless and you didn't\nthink there was a problem right it was\nworking for you then eventually you hit\nthis wall and the really devastating\nthing is that once you hit the wall\nwhere you don't know how to study you\ndon't know how to be disciplined then\neverything that you try sort of fails\nbecause you look at what other people\nare doing you recognize oh my God\nthere's a problem and then you look and\nyou say oh that that's this person next\nto me is sitting there at the library\nfor four hours and they're studying and\nthey're doing a great job I need to do\nwhat they do but they are not you and it\ndoesn't work which is then how you\nconclude that I am lazy and once you\nconclude I'm lazy that starts to have\nall kinds of implications for you\nand so in order to undo all this which\nyou absolutely can start by\nunderstanding how to study in a\nparticular way that is suited for gifted\nkids and I've seen this work for a ton\nof people and I sincerely hope it works\nfor you"
