    "transcript": "the basic issue with being a virgin is\nthat in life we have milestones we start\ndating at a particular age we get laid\nby a particular age a certain Milestone\nand what happens is as we miss those\nmilestones we start to lack faith in\nourselves we start to become insecure\nabout ourselves as we become insecure\nabout ourselves it becomes easier to\nmiss further Milestones this is The\nVirginity trap since I'm insecure and I\nhaven't gotten laid in high school when\nI go to college or uni now I can't get\nlaid there because I'm a virgin I don't\nknow how it works and so then I don't\nget laid in college and now I don't know\nhow to date and now I feel more insecure\nso the more you miss Milestones the more\ninsecure you feel the easier it is to\nmiss Milestones the harder it is to\ncatch up"
