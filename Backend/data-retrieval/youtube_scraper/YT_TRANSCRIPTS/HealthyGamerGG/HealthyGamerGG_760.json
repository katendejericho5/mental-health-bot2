    "transcript": "you know that there are times in your\nlife where you actually do a really good\njob and then you ask yourself why can't\nI be like this every day right there's\none day that you're super focused you\nget everything done on time you wake up\nin the morning you study for three hours\nyou do all your work for the day and\nthen you're free for the rest of the day\nit feels liberating feels so good and\nthen the next day you stumble you get\ndistracted and then you ask yourself\nokay how do I stop this distraction how\ndo I fix that problem and what positive\ndeviants essentially does it doesn't\nfocus on the problems it focuses on the\nsolutions so what positive deviance is\nall about is take that one day that you\ndid do a good job and ask yourself what\nare the factors that lead to this\nsuccess instead of focusing on all the\nstuff that knocks you off your game try\nto duplicate that which puts you on your\ngame and so as you look at the success\nthat you have let's say you exercise one\nmorning look at when did you go to bed\nthe night before what did you eat the\nday before what was on your mind were\nyou stressed out did you play video\ngames and look at all of the factors\nthat led to that success"
