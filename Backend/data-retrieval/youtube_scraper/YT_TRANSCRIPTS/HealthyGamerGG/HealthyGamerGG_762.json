    "transcript": "I like this girl I see her at the\ngrocery store all the time but I'm\nscared to talk to her in case she regret\nrejects me and they know nothing about\nher how could she reject anything about\nyou she doesn't know you if you're gonna\nhave one conversation with her and be\nscared you'll get rejected like the most\nrejection you can get is that she\ndoesn't want to hang out with you or\nisn't interested in the conversation\nyeah this this makes a lot of sense I\nwould bet money that 90 of the men who\nare listening to this conversation do\nnot believe that you need to be known to\nbe rejected like I think you have to\nknow someone to actually reject this\nyeah so rejected if someone tries to\nspeak to me and and they're like they\ndon't something about the statement that\nyou just made that you can't get\nrejected if someone doesn't know you\nthat runs contrary to so much of my\nexperience you can get rejected so\neasily and in fact I would imagine that\na lot of men that I know would agree\nthat it's easier to get rejected without\npeople knowing you"
