    "transcript": "all right today we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about setting boundaries\nboundary but this is going to be a\nlittle bit different because I know\nthere's a lot of discussion out there\nabout oh like you need to learn how to\nset boundaries like I need to set\nboundaries everyone's like set\nboundaries with your boss like set\nboundaries right like and psychiatrists\nor clinicians like me and we'll get to\nthis are like here's how you set\nboundaries like because we have studied\nthis we are the experts the problem is\nthat a lot of people who struggle to set\nboundaries don't struggle because it's\nhard to set boundaries a lot of the\nreason that it's hard to set boundaries\nis because the person that you're\nsetting boundaries with doesn't give a\ncrap about your boundaries I want to\ntake a moment to thank our HD coaches\nI've taught it a lot of different places\nand worked with a lot of different\npeople and honestly our coaches are some\nof the best people I've ever worked with\nHG coaches have helped over 10 000\npeople find purpose Direction and\nimprove their mental health after about\n20 weeks of coaching the average client\nexperiences a 58 Improvement in sense of\npurpose in life a 45 Improvement in\nfeelings of anxiety and even a 35\nreduction in feelings of Despair and\nthis isn't just me saying this at this\npoint we've done this for three years\nrun six research studies and even\npresented our findings at the American\nPsychiatric association National\nConference over one hundred thousand\nsessions later I can confidently say\nthis works so if you're interested in\nchecking out he coaching for yourself go\nto healthygamer.gg coaching to learn\nmore how do you set a boundary with like\na parent when you live at home how do\nyou had for whom you're like financially\nbeholden to and so that's what's really\nchallenging and I sort of learned this\nkind of the hard way so I I was doing a\nConsulting gig and someone kind of like\nasked me a question I was giving a set a\ntalk on Boundary setting and as a\npsychiatrist right like so trained at\nHarvard Medical School and all this good\nstuff and then this person was like yeah\nI don't think that's going to work with\nmy family and I was like no no no it'll\nwork and and this person was like I\ndon't think you know my grandmother like\nthis would never work with her and so I\nI was like no no it'll really work and\nwe didn't really get much resolution\nthere and I ended up talking to that\nperson afterward and I talked to a lot\nof other people and I started asking\npeople that I was working with like hey\nwhat do you think about this boundary\nsetting stuff like do you think it would\nwork for you or not work for you and\nwhat I found was essentially one big\nthing which is that boundary setting\nworks really well when you're in a\nposition of power just to give you all\nan example like let's say I'm have a\npatient who's got a stimulant medication\nlike Adderall or you know\nmethylphenidate or something like that\nthis is a stimulant medication and they\nlose their medication and they come to\nme and they say Dr K I lost my\nmedication and this is where we learn\nhow to set boundaries sorry bro\nyou lost your medication you can get in\n15 days tough luck we're like set the\nboundary and if the patient gets pissed\noff you can say okay fine you can get\npissed at me I'm not going to refill\nyour medication if you never want to see\nme again adios and so it's easy right so\nthis is the key thing about a lot of\nclinicians and this is something we take\nfor granted is that when we're learning\nhow to set boundaries we're in a\nposition of power and so it's easy to\nset boundaries when you're in a position\nof power even when it comes to things\nlike people with narcissistic parents\nonce you're financially independent and\nout of the household it's easy I mean it\ncan still be emotionally very difficult\nbut you don't have to see this person\nevery day right you're not stuck at home\na lot of what I'm kind of getting this\nfrom I'm getting this information from a\ncouple of different places that's a\nlittle bit unusual the first place is\nthat I worked with a lot of narcissists\nin my practice so I did a lot of\naddiction Psychiatry I worked with a lot\nof like Executives and and you know like\npeople who are very successful so a lot\nof them are like pretty narcissistic and\neven in that situation there was kind of\na power Dynamic but like it was somewhat\nthere but what I really am sort of\nbasing this on is not the boundaries I\nset with them but I paid attention to\npeople in their lives who were able to\nsuccessfully set boundaries to them the\nother kind of perspective that I have\nhere I know this sounds kind of\ndifferent but it's honestly like a\ncoaching perspective so just to give you\nall an example so as a clinician you\nknow I'm going to teach people how to\nset boundaries and work with narcissists\nand things like that but if you look at\nthe field of coaching these are people\nwho hey yeah my boss is an absolute\nnarcissist they control my schedule they\ncontrol my pay how do I successfully\nwork with this person so let's start by\nunderstanding how to set these\nboundaries and if we want to understand\nthat let's understand a little bit about\nnarcissists okay because usually the\npeople that you're going to have\ndifficulty with is people who are quite\nnarcissistic there are two things to\nunderstand about narcissists the first\nis that they require other people to\nbuild their self-esteem and they have\nparticular emotional needs that they\nneed to be met so a narcissist doesn't\nfeel good about themselves on their own\nwhich means they need other people to\nfeel good about them now this becomes a\nhuge problem if a narcissist is in a\nposition of power over you right because\nnow what they can do is if you don't\nfulfill their emotional needs and if you\ndon't give them respect they're going to\npunish you they can punish you\nemotionally they can punish you\nfinancially they can punish you in all\nkinds of ways especially if it's\nsomething like a parent so if someone\ncalls you and is like okay hey like I\nreally need your help I really need your\nhelp like let's say it's your best\nfriend or let's say it's your partner\nand they call you and they say oh I need\nyou I need you I need you I need you I'm\nsuicidal I'm suicidal please drop\neverything you're doing and come and\nrescue me and you may say to yourself\nhow is this an unfair power dynamic\nbecause we're both in relation we're in\na relationship with like they're my\npartner I'm their partner we're on equal\nfooting and then if you say no they're\nlike oh my God I'm gonna kill myself I'm\ngonna kill myself I'm gonna kill myself\nyou don't love me you don't love me you\ndon't love me absolutely a power dynamic\nbecause they're manipulating you\nemotionally and then you cave and you\nrun over there because you don't want\nthem to kill themselves you love them so\nthey're bludgeoning you with guilt so\nthat's absolutely a power Dynamic okay\nother situations include things like you\nknow parents calling Hey so so you're\nyou know you're are you coming home for\nChristmas when are you coming home from\nChristmas how much are you time are you\ngoing to spend with me how much time are\nyou going to spend with your dad's place\nyou know like what's going on there so\nlike people will will really be looking\nto you to fulfill their emotional needs\nand they really want something from you\nand the problem with narcissists if you\ndon't give them what they want they\npunish you for it okay so here are a\ncouple of tips that honestly work really\nwell it's sort of boundary setting and\nmanaging things with narcissists don't\nlay a boundary don't notify someone of a\nboundary when they need something from\nyou okay so if someone is calling you\nand saying hey I need you to drop\neverything you're doing because I am\nsuffering right now or a boss calls you\nand says hey everything is on fire I\nneed you to drop what you're doing and\nfix this thing trying to set a boundary\nwith them will cause them to escalate\nthey're like bro do you not understand\nwhat I'm saying you need to do this\notherwise you're not going to have a job\notherwise I'm going to kill myself\notherwise this this this this this this\nso when their needs acutely need to be\nmet it's a terrible time to lay a\nboundary so what you want to do is lay\nthe boundary well in advance\nhey boss by the way just FYI I'm gonna\nbe camping this weekend and so I won't\nbe available on cell phone use or things\nlike that you mentioned this on\nWednesday anything that I need to take\ncare of on Thursday or Friday ideally\nyou want to send it to him in writing or\nsomething like that and in the case of\nsomething like a parent or you know a\nfriend who's who who needs your help or\nsomething like that if they call you all\nthe time and they're kind of emotionally\ndumping you can say hey by the way I've\ngot a big test coming up on Monday\num I may not be as available to you over\nthe weekend so so let them know well in\nadvance the second thing to do is when\nthey ignore your boundary because that's\nwhat they're gonna do what you want to\ndo is like like keep that boundary firm\nbut then never blame them for the\nproblem so for example if someone calls\nyou for emotional support and and you're\nlike hey like I don't have time for you\nright now I have a test on Monday I\ncannot afford to listen to you I told\nyou on Wednesday that I have a test on\nMonday and you didn't listen and now\nyou're calling for me for emotional\nsupport I told you so I told you so I\ntold you so they are absolutely going to\nescalate because what are you doing in\nthat moment you're making them feel\nworse about themselves you did tell them\nso you gave them plenty of warning and\nthat makes them feel more idiotic and\nthe more idiotic they feel the worse\nthey feel the more they will escalate\nand the more they will try to manipulate\nyou so instead what you do\ndon't blame them cite in some way your\nown shortcoming and you can say hey I'm\nso sorry this sounds so important it\nsounds like you're really struggling\nright now\nI cannot focus my mind I've been\nstudying all day long this sounds so\nincredibly important but my mind is just\nnot hearing what you're saying it really\nsounds like you need my help right now\nand I really want to help you I'm so\nsorry I'm just not able to right now I\nwish I could magically do something that\nwould make me be able to like do a\nbetter job at listening I just my my\nmind is jelly can we try to talk about\nthis tomorrow morning so what you want\nto do is lay that boundary and incite\nyour own shortcoming in some way you\ndon't need to belabor it you don't need\nto justify it very much you want to just\nsay it briefly hey you deserve more than\nwhat I can offer okay that's the kind of\nmessage that you want to send and here's\nthe third really important thing you\nneed to give them an alternative to\ngetting their needs met you can't just\nsay no you have to give them a second\noption because remember the narcissist\nwants to get their needs met and so you\nare saying absolutely you can absolutely\nget your needs met but we're gonna do it\ntomorrow we're not gonna do it right now\nand eventually what you want to do is\nalmost like I know it sounds kind of\nweird but like almost manipulate them\ninto preferring the second thing over\nthe first you sort of give them a choice\nwhere I can do a crappy job of\nvalidating you right now or I can do a\ngreat job of validating you tomorrow\nmorning which one do you want and even\nif it comes to something like a boss\nwho's like hey I need you to come in\nlike on on Saturday like hey I'm sorry\nI'm far away I can't come in right now\nbut I'm happy to try to come in like you\nknow I'll check in with you all like on\nSunday afternoon the second I get back\nto internet and this is where you're\nsaying but aren't you just appeasing\nthem aren't you just kicking the bucket\nwhat you're actually doing is laying a\nboundary on them and if you're in an\nunfavorable power Dynamic you can't draw\na line in the sand that they're going to\nrespect so you have to sort of give them\nanother option that is better for you\nwhere they can still get their emotional\nneeds met so I've seen this a lot\nespecially with people like you know\nkids who are living with parents where\nthe parent is like I need you to drop\neverything that you're doing right now\nif you really can't control it that's\ntotally fine but sometimes when parents\nneed you emotion are calling you like oh\nman like I'm struggling right now like\nthese are parents who will you know be\ninfantilized themselves and their child\ntakes the role of the parent so now\nyou've got a child who's providing\nemotional support for their parents and\nhow do you set a boundary on that person\nso you have to give them an alternative\nthat's kind of easier for you and that's\nthe boundary that you really have to\nhold as best as you can and you can say\nhey I'll be available I'll call you\nfirst thing tomorrow morning at 9am so I\nknow it sounds kind of weird but if\nyou're in an unfavorable power Dynamic\nsituation there are a couple of key\nthings that you have to remember the\nfirst is that if they can bludgeon you\nthey will so what you want to do as best\nas you can is try to avoid that by\nletting them know in advance and when\nthe issue comes around you remind them\nof the boundary but don't blame them\nblaming them will escalate everything\nand they will crush you so you can say\nhey this is a shortcoming on my part I'm\nso sorry and then what you want to do is\ngive them an alternative to get their\nemotional needs met over time what\nthey'll discover is oh like okay that's\nfine like because tomorrow morning they\ncalled at 9am when you call tomorrow\nmorning at 9am what do you think is\ngoing to happen you think they're gonna\ntalk to you for an hour 50 chance\nthey're gonna be like no I'm totally\nfine and they're kind of upset and then\nthey can't really be that mad at you\nwhich is exactly what you want but\nthey've sort of learned all like I'm\nbarking up the wrong tree here and if\nyou do that a couple of times you'll\nsort of like learn that okay like I'm\nnot gonna get what I need out of this\nperson I need to go somewhere else to\nget my emotional leads met and that's\nactually exactly what you want because\nthat means that they're gonna stop\ncalling you so be super careful about\nthis stuff I know it's kind of shady but\nlike honestly this is the kind of stuff\nthat is not something that I learned as\na therapist because as a therapist this\nis the biggest problem is that sometimes\npeople who will give advice about how to\nset boundaries have all the power and\nit's easy to like I can teach you how to\nset boundaries with your child like\nthat's easy like I can set boundaries\nwith my childhood however I want because\nI'm the one with all the power the\nproblem is and we get this request so\nmuch hey Dr K we've heard your advice\nabout boundary setting but what do I do\nif I'm a kid who's alone at home and I'm\ndepending on my parents for money you\ncan still use this technique right so\nthis is something that oddly enough I\ndiscovered through all of my coaching\nrelationships which is how do you handle\na narcissistic boss secondly when\nthey've tried to violate your boundary\ndon't blame them for it\nit's gonna make things worse give them\nan alternative that works a little bit\nbetter on your timeline and the cool\nthing is you can continue to shift that\nright oh hey I'm so sorry that your your\nthings are falling apart right now don't\nsay anything like I'm at dinner with my\nfriends I can't talk because that's\ngonna like emphasize that someone else\nis more important than them right you\ncan't tell your boss hey I'm sorry I\ncan't drop everything that I'm doing and\ncome to work right now I am getting\nmarried and then your boss is going to\nbe like\n you better leave your spouse at\nthe altar and get your ass down here\nbecause our toilet is clogged instead\nwhat you have to do is just own it and\nsay hey I'm so sorry I'm not able to do\nthat right now I feel terrible about it\ncan I call you first thing tomorrow and\nand push a little bit push but this is a\nreally effective technique and the key\nthing here is that if you're in a\nsituation where you don't have a power\nin the relationship you have to still\nmeet their need because otherwise\nthey'll bludgeon you but you can still\nset a boundary in overtime push it out a\nlittle bit and even though they're\nyou're responsible for meeting their\nneeds you can meet their needs on your\nterms and that's ultimately how you set\nboundaries with people who are\nnarcissistic or have power dynamics\nforeign"
