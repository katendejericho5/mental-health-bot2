    "transcript": "today we're going to talk a little bit\nabout journaling and if you're like me\njournaling actually sounds like a\nterrible idea I'm supposed to put down\nmy deepest darkest thoughts on a piece\nof paper and then somehow that'll\nmagically improve the problem yeah\nthanks but no thanks what difference\ndoes it make if I just write down all of\nthe things that I can't fix is it like\njournaling actually just magically makes\nthings better when we just write about\nthem and I know this sounds absolutely\ninsane but the answer is yes actually\nyes that's exactly how it works we have\nno idea how this actually happens but it\nseems like there's actually really\nstrong evidence that journaling just\nmagically makes things better now you\nmay be confused by that what do you mean\nit magically makes things better so\nhere's just an example of a couple of\nreally interesting studies so the first\nis that a group of psychologists have\nrepeatedly measured students who journal\nand they Journal about all kinds of\ndifferent things so sometimes they'll\ntalk about their emotions sometimes\nthey'll talk about what they're doing\nthat day but the one thing that's really\nbizarre is journaling seems to increase\ntheir grades another example of things\nkind of magically getting better that we\ndon't understand comes from studies of\nphysiology so people will do studies on\nthe effects of journaling on things like\nantibody responses the immune system\nresponse to cancer treatment and\nvaccines their studies about how\njournaling improves like blood pressure\nand even like improves some degree of\nlike blood glucose control and all kinds\nof unrelated things hey there thanks for\nwatching and I'm glad these videos have\nbeen helpful a lot of times I'll read\nthe comments and see people asking well\nwhat do I actually do about it which is\na great question and unfortunately the\nresources out there haven't been that\ngreat which is precisely why I started\nHD in the first place HG coaches are\ntrained on a curriculum that integrates\nmy understanding of what motivates us\nwhat paralyzes us and most importantly\nwhat leads to Lasting behavioral change\nif you're ready to take the next step HG\ncoaches can help you build the life that\nyou want they've helped people build\ncareers help people find relationship\nsteps build networks of friends and even\ndo things like discover their passions\nor pursue Hobbies so if this sounds like\nsomething that you'd be interested in\ncheck out the link in the description\nbelow so what do we know about how it\nworks right so okay if you're thinking\nlisten to this and you're thinking okay\nwait so like if I start journaling it's\ngoing to improve my blood pressure make\nme physically healthier and all also\nincrease my grades like that sounds\nreally bizarre like how on Earth can it\npossibly do that and so let's try to\ndive in and understand a little bit\nabout the mechanisms of journaling so\nthe first thing that makes journaling\nactually kind of hard is if you have a\nproblem in life you spend most of your\ntime avoiding that problem right so like\nif I'm if I'm worried about what my\nfriends think of me I'm not going to\nspend my time thinking about her I don't\nwant to spend my time thinking about it\nbecause spending my time thinking about\nit like having a thought Loop about it\nseems to not help at all and instead\nwhat our mind naturally wants to do is\ndistract ourselves from problems so your\nmind may be kind of like this like you\nmay be thinking okay if I can fix\nsomething I'm happy to think about it so\nI'm happy to work on a problem when it\nresults in something productive but I\ndon't want to spend time thinking about\nsomething unless it actually like moves\nthe needle forward in some way right so\ncompletely natural so when you Journal\nabout something that is emotionally\nchallenging it tends to evoke those\nemotions and this is exactly what we\nspend most of our time avoiding right\nthis is why we will spend time on social\nmedia or play video games or whatever\nlike because we want to avoid these\nnegative emotions but there's something\nthat's really interesting that happens\nwhen you Journal so when you Journal you\nstart to evoke these emotions but you\nevoke them in kind of like a diet sort\nof way so it's not like regular Coke\nit's like Diet Coke or Diet soda and and\nif you think about the the emotional\nburden that you feel when you Journal is\nless than the actual experience so some\npeople have hypothesized that this is\nalmost like trauma exposure therapy\nwhere you are exposing yourself to your\nnegative emotions in small small small\ndoses and what we tend to see over time\nwith people who Journal is like yeah the\nexperience of journaling is kind of\nuncomfortable but what it actually does\nis teaches you how to tolerate\ndiscomfort and so if you're thinking\nabout if you Journal about let's say an\nuncomfortable social situation an\nawkward social situation like you're at\na restaurant and a waiter walks up to\nyou and says enjoy your meal and then\nyou say thanks you too and then you're\ncringing about it for the next couple of\ndays and as you're trying to fall asleep\nyou just think about this really cringe\nmoment where you're terrified right\nthere's nothing you can really do about\nit as you Journal that the cringe comes\nup and the interesting thing is that as\nyou experience more and more of that\nnegative emotion while you're journaling\nover time people have done studies on\nthis the amount of negative emotion that\nyou experience or really the amount of\nstress that you experience when\nrecalling the emotion actually goes down\nand so as your stress level goes down\nyou start to resist negative emotion and\nthen what happens is something actually\nreally cool is now that you no longer\nneed to fear negative emotion you can\nactually have cringe moments and not\nworry about them so it seems that\njournaling actually increases our\nability tolerate negative emotion so the\nmore we Journal it seems like one of the\nbiggest advantages is that increase in\njournaling decreases our avoidance of\nnegative things or things that make us\nfeel bad there are a couple of other\nangles of journaling that people have\nsort of hypothesized or explored so\nanother good example of this is building\na narrative so there's a lot of research\nthat shows that if human beings go\nthrough a traumatic experience they\ndon't all develop PTSD so for example\nthere are human beings that will go\nthrough a traumatic experience and like\nhalf of them will enter into something\ncalled post-traumatic growth and pro\npost-traumatic growth is when something\nkind of bad happens to you but you grow\nas a person and you actually end up kind\nof like better than you started off and\nthere are some people that I've talked\nto that were super bizarre but like I\nremember seeing you know working with\ncancer patients when I was a medical\nstudent and an intern and them saying\nweird things like cancer survivors like\nyeah cancer was the best thing that ever\nhappened to me and I'm sitting there\nthinking like what do you mean how on\nEarth can that possibly make sense\ncancer sounds devastating and they'll\nsay this weird kind of stuff like oh\nyeah like cancer made me realize like\nhow much like life is how amazing life\ntruly is it made me appreciate life so\nmuch more it made me appreciate the\npeople around me and like all this kind\nof like super positive stuff and I'm\nkind of scratching my head but like okay\nif that's what you say on the flip side\nso sometimes if you have a traumatic\nexperience it's not what doesn't kill\nyou only makes you stronger the other\nunfortunate truth is that what doesn't\nkill you can you for the rest of\nyour life and this is the case of\nsomething like PTSD where a trauma\nlingers and continues to damage someone\nthen some researchers got kind of\ncurious and were trying to figure out\nokay what's the difference between going\nto post traumatic growth route and going\nthe post-traumatic stress disorder route\nwhat determines whether someone is able\nto like heal from trauma and become a\nstronger person one of the major\nvariables is something called narrative\nso people who are able to construct\nsome kind of narrative about their life\nare the ones who will like grow from\nnegative experiences this is where doing\nsomething like journaling can actually\nhelp us construct a narrative it is a\nvery very cohesive exercise that can\nhelp us make sense of the events around\nus there's studies that show that people\nwho Journal will change their pronoun\nusage now we're not talking about\ntransgender kind of stuff what I mean is\nthat if you normally think about a\nsituation so let's say that you're like\nyou have social anxiety and you sort of\nthink about a situation and as your mind\nunderstands the situation you think oh\nmy God I look so stupid Oh my God these\npeople don't like me\num I I don't know how to behave properly\npeople must think I'm awkward people\nmust feel like I'm a third wheel people\nmust not like the way that I I think and\nso if you think about those thoughts\nwhat is the subject of those thoughts\nI'm saying people people people people\npeople people think this about me people\nthink that about me people think this\nabout me people think that about me and\nso one of the really interesting things\nis that when people are stuck in a\nnegative cognitive pattern they tend to\nbe focused either too much on themselves\nI'm I'm at fault this is all my fault\nthis is my problem I'm a waste of space\npeople I don't like hanging out with\npeople or whatever it's i i i i i or\nit's people people people people and if\nyou look at someone like a narcissist\nthis is a really good example so a\nnarcissist when they construct a\nnarrative about their life other people\nare always messing with them these\npeople don't like me they don't respect\nme they don't love me despite everything\nthat I do they don't experience any\ngratitude for me so someone who's\nnarcissistic is always thinking about\nthem them them them on the flip side if\nsomeone has something like a mood\ndisorder and it isn't a depressive\nepisode the person who's always at fault\nis themselves I'm a waste of space my\nfamily is better off without me Etc et\ncetera et cetera I don't like the way\nthat I look when I look in the mirror\nI'm ugly I'm this I'm this I'm this I'm\nthis I'm this so the key thing though is\nthat narcissists always use they in them\nor people and people who are depressed\nwill always always use III so there's\ndata that shows that when you start to\njournal that becomes fluid so literally\npeople will analyze the pronouns that\nare used in journaling and at the\nbeginning of journaling you'll say III\nor you'll say they they they they they\nbut as you Journal more you start to mix\nthe two statements and so like this is\nan example of let's say a narcissist two\njournals will say these people don't\nlike me these people don't respect me\nand then over time as they Journal\nthey'll start to say well sometimes I\ndon't behave respectfully towards them\nsometimes maybe I'm the one who's\nactually at fault I could have started\ndoing this better and for people who are\ndepressed you'll see the opposite I'm a\nwaste of space I'm not valuable other\npeople sometimes don't treat me with\nrespect and I sometimes can be valuable\nbut people don't give me what I deserve\nso what will literally see is a\nfluctuation in the pronoun usage and\nwhat that sort of indicates is that\npeople are changing their narratives so\nas a narcissist starts to journal they\nstart to realize and they start to use\nmore I statements and start to realize\noh maybe I am at fault this is really\ncool because once you start to realize\nokay wait wait a second maybe they're\nnot to blame maybe I'm to blame you may\nneed that or the flip side if you have\nsuper low self-esteem is you're always\ngoing to be blaming yourself and you'll\nstart to hold other people accountable\nso it seems like journaling helps us\nkind of change perspectives and build a\nmore cohesive narrative so I think part\nof the reason that sometimes we get\nstuck in life is because we don't\nactually learn from our mistakes right\nso if you play like a video game for\nexample you can be hard stuck at bronze\nfor like years and sometimes in real\nlife that's sort of true too a good\nexample of this would be something where\nyou feel like this kind of stuff keeps\nhappening and you find yourself in the\nsame situation over and over and over\nagain and one of the interesting things\nthings there is that if you look at\nsomething like therapy or coaching these\nare things things that help you\nunderstand where the problem is and\njournaling can sometimes help you do\nthat as well I think of journaling kind\nof like replay analysis where if you\nthink about okay I can play five you\nknow rounds of a particular video game\nbut which one will actually teach me\nmore if I play five rounds of a video\ngame or if I play three rounds of a\nvideo game and I spend two hours like\nanalyzing my replays and thinking about\nwhat I could be doing better and it\nturns out that that's true of journaling\nas well because as we go through life we\nnever really sit down and like think\nabout in a kind of objective cohesive\nway what we could be doing better our\nmind May generate all kinds of thoughts\nbut it's different right so if you sit\ndown and actually like watch one of your\nreplays you're going to notice so much\nmore about what you could be doing\nanyone who plays a game and loses a game\nwill immediately if you ask them some\nkind of question hey why did you lose\nthis game they'll jump to some answer\nright they'll give you an answer they'll\nsay oh I lost this game because of a b c\nand d they think they know what the\nanswer is but if that same person\nactually sits down and watches a replay\nwhat they'll discover is ten thousand\nthings that their mind didn't\nimmediately jump to so hopefully by now\nyou're willing to kind of give\njournaling a shot and so then the next\nquestion becomes okay how do I journal\nand this is super cool because a lot of\npeople have tried to figure out okay\nlike what's the right way to journal so\njust to give you all a couple of\nexamples there are some studies that\nlook at journaling like 15 minutes a day\nfor seven days in a row there are some\nstudies that look at journaling like 30\nminutes once a week for like seven weeks\nthere are all kinds of different like\ndosages and frequencies and durations of\njournaling so here's what we kind of\nknow about journaling the first is that\njournaling can have delayed effects so\nthere are some studies that show that\neven a single episode of journaling can\nlead to some kind of or Improvement or\nRevelation up to six months away so I\nknow it sounds kind of bizarre but this\nis one of the reasons that it's hard to\njournal because we don't really see the\nbenefit right away so it does appear\nthat journaling can have very delayed\nbenefits that are kind of unexpected the\nnext thing is that there isn't really a\nmagical formula so I'd say kind of do\nwhat works for you you need some degree\nof consistency so I'd say anywhere\nbetween 15 minutes and one hour and as\nfrequently as every day if you feel like\nit or up to once a week now what kind of\nstuff should you Journal about now this\nis what's super interesting so there's\nsome data that shows that it doesn't\nmatter what you Journal about you're\ngoing to get some kind of benefit but\nwhat I found to be consistently useful\nfor psychological things is first of all\nthat you write about some kind of\nemotional experience that you've had and\nwhat do we mean by emotional experience\nwe don't really just mean something that\nthat happened bad like if you had an\nawesome week you can could talk about\nlike how awesome your week was and how\ngrateful you are to your friends because\nexpressing gratitude and journaling is a\nwhole different area of research that\nshows all kinds of positive benefits the\nsecond thing is that I would strongly\nrecommend that from time to time you\nactually read your journal and for those\nof y'all that are paranoid that someone\nelse is going to find my journal and\nread it just think about this for a\nsecond okay we have professional authors\nwho have dedicated their entire life to\nwriting something to entice someone to\nread it these are things like\nbest-selling novels and if you were to\npick up a best-selling novel today what\ndo you think would happen you'd read a\nlittle bit of it and you'd set it down\nour attention span is now so short that\nno one will have the attention span and\ndedication to sit down and read through\nsome kind of amateur fan fiction\nautobiography crap that is your life so\nif you're like me you're terrified that\npeople are going to read your Journal\nbut they don't have the attention span\nfor it so you can write whatever you\nwant and it doesn't really matter right\nfor you okay so write about emotional\nexperiences if you can you want to read\nit from time to time one thing that I\nhighly recommend is that you physically\nwrite so a lot of people will like to\njournal using something like you know a\nword editing software or something like\nthat Microsoft Word Google Docs or\nwhatever and you can journal on a laptop\nthere's no like big deal with that or\ndesktop or whatever but what are there a\ncouple of things about physically\nwriting that I think are really\nimportant the first is that physically\nwriting slows your thoughts down if you\nslow your thoughts down you're you'll\nkind of sit with them a little bit more\nand you'll be able to process things a\nlittle bit the other really interesting\nthing about writing is that writing\ncommits things to memory if you have\nsome kind of insight like this may have\nhappened to you before where you kind of\nhave This brilliant idea as you're going\nto bed at night and what happens the\nnext day do you remember what your\nbrilliant ideas the next day you wake up\nthat kind of disappears right you have\nThis brilliant idea oh my God this is\nhow I'm gonna make a billion dollars I\njust had this great product idea I have\nthis great idea for a story I had all\nthese great ideas and they just\ndisappear into the wind another simple\nexample of this is you can read\nsomething like study something for\nschool and you can understand it while\nyou're reading it and the next day where\ndoes it go it disappears so one of the\ncool things about journaling is that\nchances are that when you Journal it'll\nwhatever you write about will sink into\nyour memory more I kind of think about\njournaling like getting into a canoe and\nkind of going down river where the part\nthat you control is like sure you're\npaddling a little bit here or there but\nit's primarily the river that's carrying\nyou Downstream right and the same thing\nkind of happens when you Journal is that\nsure you can pick a particular topic but\nif you journal for 30 minutes I can\nalmost guarantee you that where you end\nup will be very different from where you\nstarted at the end of the day a lot of\npeople are really concerned about\njournaling right so we've like heard\nthat journaling is good for you like you\ncan look at like oh this article about\nlike how to deal with burnout on\nLinkedIn written by some guy with an MBA\nsays oh yeah journey is really good and\nyou can hear about psychiatrists like\nmyself or therapists or other people\nlike maybe your friends who are like\nyeah like journaling has totally helped\nme like journaling helps so much but if\nyou're kind of like me you don't really\nknow how to journal right because no one\never teaches you how to journal you're\nkind of confused like how is this\nsupposed to help me it doesn't actually\nfix any of my problems all it does is\neven if I write about the terrible stuff\nfirst of all it makes me feel terrible\nwhen I write it secondly like it doesn't\nactually fix the problem and thirdly\nlike what if someone reads it this\nsounds like a terrible idea you're\nasking me to commit the most painful\nthoughts that I have to a piece of paper\nand then it's going to be vulnerable and\nlike anyone could read it that's not\nlike a terrible idea it sort of does\nsound like a terrible idea and that's\nwhy if you really understand how\njournaling works if you really\nunderstand some of the data behind the\nevidence behind journaling and you start\nto understand a little bit about how to\nactually do it you will be amazed at\nfirst of all how easy it is and second\nof all how much it actually helps you"
