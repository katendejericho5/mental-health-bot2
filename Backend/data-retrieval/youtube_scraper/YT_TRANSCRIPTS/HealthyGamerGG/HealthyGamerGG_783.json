    "transcript": "so what is self-respect how do you get\nit so right now you're willing to\nsacrifice yourself to get happiness from\noutside of you and without that\nhappiness from outside of you you're\ngonna feel alone you're gonna feel\nhungry because you don't have all of\nthose things so self-respect is actually\nchoosing pain at the end of the day\nself-respect is about who controls your\nhappiness in life and when you surrender\nthat control to another human being even\nif you're addicted to it I can\nunderstand when you're addicted to the\nhappiness that she provides and you let\nher dictate the terms of the\nrelationship what you're doing is you're\nputting your happiness in her hands so\nwhether you're happy or unhappy is\ndependent on her so you're surrendering\nthat control and that's when other\npeople when one human sees another human\nbeing surrender their self-control\nthat's when they tell them to have some\nself-respect so how do you get your\nself-respect you take that control back\nwhy is it hard to take that control back\nbecause oftentimes taking that control\nback comes with pain"
