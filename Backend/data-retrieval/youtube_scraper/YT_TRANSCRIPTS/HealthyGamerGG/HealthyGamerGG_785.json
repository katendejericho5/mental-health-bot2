    "transcript": "so it seems to me like more and more\npeople are starting to try to figure out\nlike what are we doing here like in on\nthis planet on this earth like what's\nthe purpose of life\nI sort of see this manifest in kind of\nthe anti-work crowd where people are\nlike is this what life is supposed to be\nI'm supposed to wake up every day at\nseven a.m I commute for an hour work\nuntil five commute home I exercise for\n30 minutes cook for this amount of time\nand then I have to get in bed so I'm not\nburnt out the next day and it's just\nlike rinse and repeat until I die is\nthis really what life is about and on\nthe flip side we have like the sigma\ngrind set folks right these are the\npeople that are kind of like okay like\nI'm gonna grind and like you gotta you\ngotta grind to get ahead and you gotta\nbe an alpha and you gotta go Sigma grind\nset you know that's really how you like\nyou make it in life is you have the side\nhustle and you grow your side hustle\nthen you have your side side hustle and\nyou try to hustle as much as you can and\nthen if you hustle a lot then you can\nbecome successful and you can get lots\nof money and then like you can retire\nearly right there's the fire folks which\nis financial Independence and retire\nearly so these are people who are kind\nof thinking okay since Life starts with\nretirement the goal of life is to like\nstep out of that grind as quickly as\npossible make your millions that you can\nenjoy life so instead of retiring at the\nage of 60 what I'm going to do is try to\nfigure out how can I retire at the age\nof 45 or 46 or 46 and a half and then I\ncan start living life so I'm going to\nsacrifice the best years of my life so\nthat I can enjoy enjoy the latter years\nof my life\nand so I'm kind of listening to this\nstuff and I'm trying to really figure\nout what's the point of all of this is\nlife really about going to work every\nday and kind of taking care of yourself\nand working on your mental health and\nworking on your physical health and\nlearning how to cook and eating\nnutritious food and then going keto and\ngoing paleo and all this kind of stuff\nuntil you die\nor is it about grinding right is it like\nside hustles and hustles and hustles and\nhustling your way to an early retirement\nso that you can really like start living\nlife to the fullest at the age of 52.\nis this what's going on like what are we\nwhat's happening here and these are two\ndifferent solutions either mentally\nchecking out of the capitalistic Society\nbecause I reject this thing or\ncapitalizing on the capitalistic society\nand leaning into that and I'm going to\ntry to maximize it and get ahead but\nboth these groups of people in my\nopinion share one problem which is they\ndon't know what they're doing right\nthere's no like purpose there's no sense\nof purpose in life people don't know\nwhat we're on this Earth to do\nand so they don't really know like how\nto live this life and there's good\nactual data to support this so if we\nlook at for example pornography\naddiction pornography addiction is on\nthe rise and more and more people are\nconsuming pornography more people are\ngetting addicted to pornography and you\nmay say well what does that have to do\nwith life purpose well it turns out that\nthe variable that correlates the most\nwith being addicted to pornography is a\nsense of meaninglessness so as our life\nbecomes meaningless we start to consume\nmore pornography because like we don't\nreally know what we're doing so I might\nas well watch some porn and get some\ndopamine and then I'll kind of like you\nknow it sort of passes the time\nthat's one example another example which\nis really scary is actually suicide is\non the rise so we know that suicide is\ncorrelated with a sense of\npurposelessness in life right like what\nam I doing with life there's really no\npoint in being here I'm suffering some\nright now and there's no like end goal\nthat makes the suffering worth it\nso why not just check out a life\nso it's kind of scary but suicide is the\nnumber one cause of uh death amongst\nAsian Americans between the ages of 18\nand 24 which is crazy right so if you're\nlike an Asian American kind of like I\nwas or I mean I still am but I'm not 18\nto 24 anymore the the most dangerous\nthing to you in life is actually you and\nwhy is suicide the the number one cause\nof of death for Asian Americans between\nthe age of 18 and 24. it's because this\nis a group of people that is getting\ncrushed by expectation they don't really\nknow what's what they're doing in life\nright so if you've grown up in the Asian\nAmerican diaspora you'll be kind of\nfamiliar with this that you're\nessentially crushed by expectations the\nwhole world usually your parents and\nyour you know friend group and stuff\nlike that they tell you hey this is what\nlife is about they're like look in order\nto be successful you got to do this you\ngot to do this you got to do this you\ngot to do this they've got the formula\nfigure out you gotta major in stem you\ngot to work really hard you got to get\ninto a good college you gotta be at the\ntop of your class in college you gotta\ngo work get these really prestigious\ncompanies or become a doctor or whatever\nand then you will be happy\nand despite the fact that these Asian\nparents are pushing stuff on them so\nmuch this pushing this formula for\nsuccess\nwhat we actually see is that Asian\nAmericans are killing themselves at an\nalarming rate\nand so our society has lost sight of\nwhat purposes like we don't really know\nlike what we're doing here and so since\nwe don't know what we're doing here we\nhave these like Sigma grind set kind of\npeople that are like I'm gonna do all my\ngrinding up front but is that really the\npoint of life no one knows what we're\ndoing here\nand why is that\nso the first thing that we have to\nunderstand is that a sense of purpose\ncan't be given to you right it has to\ncome from within and if it could be\ngiven to you then all the Asian American\nkids would be doing great because their\nparents are clearly giving them a sense\nof purpose they're handing it to him on\nthe silver platter they're shoving it\ndown their throat they're saying this is\nwhat you should do this is what you\nshould do this is what you should do\nbut that doesn't work fundamentally it\ndoesn't work right\nand so then the question is okay like so\nif it comes from within like what do we\nmean by that right so if if a sense of\npurpose comes to them like look within\nyourself are we talking kind of like\nOprah book club like oh you gotta like\nlook within yourself and like you gotta\nlike like look so far within yourself\nand see you find your purpose you know\nis that kind of what we're talking about\nwell sort of but I think it's way more\nscientific and way more like simple than\nthat it's not some weird deep spiritual\njourney we'll talk a little bit about\nthat but it's like literally our sense\nof purpose comes from within if our\nsense of purpose comes from within then\nwhy is it that more and more people are\nlosing sight of that well what's changed\nin the last 20 years let's take a look\nat it so what's changed in the last 20\nyears this is essentially an\nacceleration of technology and what has\ntechnology actually do so if we kind of\nthink about it what's happening in our\nsociety right now the most fundamental\nmajor change that has happened in our\nsociety is that we have externalized our\nattention\nso I don't know if you're like me but\nthis is something that I absolutely used\nto do so when I was in med school I\nneeded to optimize things right so I had\naudio books I had like audio lectures\non my my my MP3 player right because\nback then I had an MP3 player back in\nthe day 12 years ago and so what I would\ndo is I wake up in the morning and I'd\nturn on some kind of audiobook or\nsomething like that right like podcasts\nor something and then I'd be like\ncooking and listening to something then\nI'd walk to the train and I'm listening\nto something and then I get on the train\nand I'm like reading something or maybe\nI'm on my Kindle or something like that\nthen I'm at class and I'm paying\nattention there and so every moment of\nmy day my\nattention is externalized I'm listening\nto a podcast I'm on social media I'm\nplaying a video game I'm watching\nsomething even when I'm on the toilet\nlike the scariest thing in the world is\ngoing to the toilet without your phone\nright because like oh my God what are we\ngonna do then\nso if we really look at it fundamentally\nwhat is the change in technology or what\nchanges technology rot in our brains and\non society it is externalized our\nattention so a hundred years ago we used\nto be like more attentional to our\ninternal stimuli and what's really\ninteresting is there are some places\nwhere even technology has not figured\nout how to break into so a great example\nof this is shower thoughts right the\nshower is the one place because if\nthings get wet then we can't take our\ntechnology in there where we have these\nreally profound thoughts we think so\nmuch in the shower and we start to make\nall these like amazing realizations in\nthe shower\nand why is that is the shower is there\nsomething biochemical or physiological\nabout the Heat and the water or maybe\nyou take cold showers you know that that\nsort of triggers all these profound\nthoughts no it's actually like this is\nthe only time that we're able to be with\nourself this is the only time of the day\nthat we're actually able to pay\nattention to ourselves\nand so since we've lost touch with our\ninner voice we don't really know what we\nthink we've struggled to find purpose\nand how does that work so let me give\nyou all an example\nso let's say I'm trying to figure out\nwhat I want to eat\nand I'm trying to figure out what kind\nof food I like like what kind of food do\nI want to eat in this world but imagine\nfor a moment that my tongue was\ncompletely numb and I couldn't taste\nanything where my nose was clogged\nbecause 70 of taste actually comes from\nyour olfactory nerves but whatever all\nthat stuff is numb I got some covid got\nsome olfactory problems whatever right I\ncan't taste anything\nand so then how do you imagine I'm going\nto try to figure out what food I like so\nwhat I end up doing if if my internal\nsenses are numb I'm going to look at\nsomeone else I'm going to see someone\nelse I see oh wow they're eating a\nhamburger that that looks great I'm\ngonna eat that look at that litter\nenjoying their hamburger they're taking\nthese big bites it's so juicy it looks\namazing and then I decide okay I'm gonna\neat a hamburger so I take the first bite\nof hamburger I don't taste anything I\nfinished the hamburger I'm like you know\nwhat that doesn't really work for me\nso I'm going to look at someone else I\nsee oh wow that person's got some ice\ncream look at that they're like licking\nthe ice cream it tastes it looks really\nawesome it's so colorful it's got\nsprinkles on top that looks totally lit\nlet me do that and then I try the ice\ncream but I'm numb so I can't taste\nanything and so what ends up happening I\ngo through life looking at what other\npeople makes other people happy and then\nI try to duplicate it hoping that I\nmyself will become happy not happy I'll\nenjoy the food right this is what\nhappens\nand if we look at literally there's like\nNeuroscience evidence of this that if\nyou look at what technology usage does\nit doesn't matter if it's social media\nvideo games whatever\nit numbs our emotional circuitry it\nliterally shuts down our ability to like\nbe in touch with ourselves so we know\nthat playing a video game for even a\nbrief period of time will suppress our\namygdala and our limbic system the\nemotional circuits of our brain we will\nlike literally suppress those internal\nsignals which is exactly why we use the\ninternet so when I'm feeling bad about\nmyself and I have too much work to do\nand I'm feeling overwhelmed what am I\ngoing to do to fix that I'm going to go\nlook at cat videos\nis the second I open up a cat video I\nsuppress all of my internal signals and\nthis is precisely What's Going On We're\nGoing through life trying to figure out\nwhat we want to do we're looking outside\nof ourselves for possible answers we see\nthis person is enjoying a burger we see\nthat person is enjoying ice cream but\nthe whole time we are actively numbing\nour tongue in our olfactory senses so\nnone of it seems to work and when none\nof it seems to work this is how we end\nup with people developing the sigma\ngrind set think about this for a second\nokay people who are doing the signal\nSigma grind set and want to retire early\nwhat are they actually saying they don't\neven know what they're going to do after\nthey retire they don't even know that\nthey're going to enjoy retirement\nbut like think about that right because\nyou haven't retired you don't know what\nit's like to be retired for five years\nyou think it's gonna be great because\nyou imagine all of these freedoms and\nstuff but you don't actually know how\nhow that's going to work\nI worked with a ton of people who've\nactually retired and then what do they\ndo after two or three years they get\nbored and they come out of retirement so\nwe end up going through life looking at\nwhat appears to make other people happy\nand then chasing after that\nall the while numbing ourselves and this\nis where we're particularly vulnerable\nbecause if we look at things like social\nmedia and influencers they play\ncompletely into that right so how do you\nbecome a successful influencer how do\nyou become successful on social media\nyou live the good life you demonstrate\nto other people that I'm gonna be in\nshape and look at me and I'm doing all\nthis stuff and like I'm ripped and like\nI'm gonna like have lots of fun with my\nfriends and we're gonna go to the beach\nand we're gonna do this and we're gonna\ndo this and like everyone's laughing and\neveryone's like yeah like oh my God\nthey're living the high life and then\nyou're sitting at home you're watching\nthat you're like I want that too those\npeople are happy\nsocial media completely amplifies this\nthis sort of idea that I can look at\nother people and they are showing me the\nrecipe for happiness they're showing me\nhow to find purpose but it doesn't work\nbecause we try to monkey see monkey do\nwe try to replicate what we see but it\ndoesn't seem to work for us why because\nwe're numb so the next question becomes\nhow do we un-numb ourselves and once\nwe're able to do that life will change\ndrastically right so if you can start to\ntaste again it can become really really\neasy to figure out what you enjoy eating\nall you need to do is be able to taste\nso how do we actually go about doing\nthat so this is where we've got to talk\nfor a second about boredom okay so the\nfirst thing to understand is like what\nis the purpose of boredom so if we think\nabout it when we start to feel bored\nwhat is our antidote to boredom our\nantidote to boredom is usually some kind\nof external stimulation so what does\nboredom actually boredom is a\nstimulation seeking emotional state\nso our mind has figured out hey if we're\nnot getting the stimulation that we want\nwhat I'm going to do is make this person\nfeel bored and once they start to feel\nbored we are going to seek some kind of\nexternal simulation which will then\nrelieve the boredom because as long as\nwe're getting stimulated from the\noutside we won't feel bored furthermore\nif we're getting simulated from the\noutside what we're going to be doing is\nsuppressing all of our internal signals\nso then the question kind of becomes\nokay\nhow can I start\nreconnecting with my internal signals\nand this is where if you want to start\nlistening to your internal voice what\nyou actually need to do is Stop drowning\nit out from the outside\nso this is where we have to understand a\nlittle bit about where thoughts come\nfrom right so the thoughts in our mind\ncome from two places they can either\ncome from our sensory organs or\nsomething like internally memory or\nthings like that so if you kind of think\nabout you know what are you excited\nabout today are you excited about seeing\na particular movie or playing a\nparticular game or eating a particular\nfood how did you have that excitement\nwhere did that thought come from chances\nare it came from a sensory organ and as\nlong as we are being bombarded by the\nsensory organs it's going to be very\nhard for our internal thoughts to\nactually arise\nthis is further compounded by the fact\nthat oftentimes when our internal\nthoughts arise they kind of like arise\nin a negative way so the first thing\nthat comes out of our mind tends to be\nkind of negative so if I'm sitting there\nlaying awake at night and like you know\ntrying to go to sleep\nI'm not going to think happy thoughts at\nthe beginning right I'm going to start\nto think a little bit about how much I\nhave to do I'm going to start to feel\noverwhelmed so the other reason that we\nwant to numb ourselves is the first\nlayer of internal voice is usually\nunpleasant it's negative emotions that\nwe've suppressed\nand so what do we kind of do about this\nand this is what's kind of interesting\nis we kind of know societally that like\npeople will go and find their purpose\nright and how do they do that well they\ngo like on these journeys of\nself-discovery and they find themselves\nso we know like this is not only a Trope\nlike people actually go and do this I\nkind of did it right so I went to India\nand I spent three months in an ashram\nand we know that people will go on these\nlike year-long Wanderlust you know\nsabbatical kind of things sometimes\npeople will take a gap year and what do\nthey do in their Gap year they like go\ntravel the world and they hike and they\ngo mountain climbing and all this kind\nof stuff\nand we know that once people do this\nkind of thing they come back to life six\nmonths later a year later their hair has\ngrown out they have a beard presumably\ntheir dude sometimes women you know and\nthen they've got this like piercing look\nin their eyes and they're like rugged\nand they've like discovered themselves\nand so let's understand that for a\nsecond scientifically like wait a minute\nso we know this kind of happens and even\nwithin you there may be a yearning to go\nfind yourself\nand then the question kind of begins\nokay hold on a second what's the\nmechanism to this what's the science\nbehind this why do you have to travel in\nthe Himalayas to go find yourself\nbecause aren't you with you all the time\nwell the answer is actually no right so\nin the world that we actually exist in\nyou're not with you in fact you have so\nmuch digital stimulation that you're far\nfar far away from you which also\nexplains why you can go find yourself in\nthe Himalayas\nso when you go hiking for six months\nwhat happens to your indary as your\nsense organs what happens to your\nsensory input when you're hiking for\neight hours like you're not getting\nconstant sensory input right like you\njust can't so sure you're seeing things\nlike maybe there's a beautiful mountain\nsomewhere or a lake or whatever but for\nthe most part you're kind of walking and\njust being with yourself and so the\nprocess of finding yourself involves\nreducing external stimulation and as you\nstart to reduce external simulation\nstuff starts to come up you get attuned\nto your inner voice this is exactly what\nhappened to me in the ashram so I sit\nthere and I meditate for like eight\nhours and like stuff starts to come up\nstuff starts to come up stuff starts to\ncome up\nand and this is also why people like\ngoing on meditation Retreats because\nwhen you go on a Meditation Retreat you\nare with yourself and you were away from\nthe rest of the world you've unplugged\nand when you unplug from the rest of the\nworld that's when you hear your inner\nvoice and so it's kind of interesting\nbecause even this Trope sort of makes\nsense right so what is the mechanism\nthrough which going on a self-discovery\njourney helps you find purpose because\nthere's got to be a scientific mechanism\nright it's not just like a literary\nTrope that is glorified in movies like\npeople actually go and do this\nand the mechanism is that we get away\nfrom this external stimuli so we can\nhear our internal voice\nand so if you're kind of sitting at home\nand thinking to yourself well like what\nam I supposed to do am I supposed to go\nunderstand myself by going on a hiking\nJourney if you want to go for it go for\nit you can do like silent meditation\nRetreats or whatever but we're going to\nteach y'all just a very simple technique\ntoday which is to reach the end of\nthought\nyou may say like what does that mean\nwhat is the end of thought so if you\nclose your eyes\nwhat's going to happen is you'll have\nthoughts right thoughts will arise\nthoughts will arise thoughts will arise\nand you'll notice a particular pattern\nto the thoughts most of the thoughts\nwill be related to something external to\nyou they're not anything about what you\nwant they're about things that you're\ngoing to need to do or they manifest as\ndesires which you may think is what you\nwant but that desire will also be born\nof an external stimulus it's not\nsomething that you care about you may\nsay I want to eat this or I want to play\nthis or whatever then what you're going\nto notice is there's a period of intense\nboredom where your mind is struggling\nfor stimulation and so you'll feel very\nvery very very intensely bored and\nremember what is boredom boredom is an\nattempt by your brain to get that hit of\ndopamine this is why it makes boredom so\ndamn uncomfortable so if we think about\nthe sensations within ourselves that\nprompt us to action that Force us into\naction all of those Sensations are\nuncomfortable hunger is uncomfortable\nthirst is uncomfortable and so why does\nour body make us feel uncomfortable to\nbludgeon us into acting what's the\nbiggest Club it's got It's actually\nboredom\nso the second phase that you're going to\nexperience is intense intense boredom\nbut then something magical will happen\nif you can make it through that phase if\nyou cannot give into the boredom and\nonce you know what the boredom is trying\nto do you can start to have some power\nover it\nyou will find that the thoughts are\ngoing to be very rapid at the beginning\nand then they'll start to slow down slow\ndown slow down slow down and if you're\nlucky you will reach the end of thought\nso how long does it take to reach the\nend of thought it kind of depends\nbut once you reach the end of thought\nbecause remember thoughts can come from\nthe outside then all you will be left\nwith\nare the internal impulses what you will\nhave done is stopped numbing yourself\nand actually will be\nhypersensitive to internal drivers\ninternal goals internal values and the\ncool thing is once you get centered in\nthose then you can start crafting a life\naround them right once I know from\nwithin me what I am looking for from\nLife once I stop listening to\ninfluencers or my Asian American parents\nor looking at other people like my\nfriends or older siblings or whatever\nand what they've done with their life\nand instead of trying to duplicate that\nI'm listening to myself then I can start\nto align a life out of my values\nand something really magical happens\nthere which is that once you discover\nwhat you want from life it's not about\nwhat is the purpose of life this is also\na misnomer there is not a purpose or\nwhat is the purpose of life this is kind\nof wild but it's my belief that the\npurpose of life is not in life it's in\nyou it's individualized and this is like\nthe the big scam is that we're like\nwhat's the purpose of life like let's go\nask someone really wise right because if\nwe ask someone really wise they'll be\nable to give us the answer\nbut the whole point is that you're an\nindividual that you are living your life\nand so if you want to make the most of\nit you have to understand what you want\nout of it\nand so in order to do that reach the end\nof thought\nright you may say well practically how\ndo I do that do I sit there for a while\nyou can sit there for a while you can go\non a long hike if you want to you don't\nhave to reach the end of thought all at\nonce so you can sit there and go on a\n10-day silent Meditation Retreat if you\nwant to you can go on a hiking trip\nthose are fantastic or you can just sit\ndown with yourself you know for a half\nan hour hour whatever do I have to stay\nin Lotus posture no you don't have to\nstay in Lotus posture go for a walk and\njust let the thoughts run out they will\nrun out of steam they'll be boredom and\nthen after that you'll discover what you\nwant\nand once you discover your purpose then\nyou can start to align your life around\nit and once you start aligning your life\nout of purpose a couple of things happen\nthe first thing that happens is that you\nare able to tolerate the difficulties of\nlife\nso\nwhy is it that it's hard to do hard\nthings it's because it's not worth it\nright anytime there's a challenge if you\nreally listen to people what's the\nresistance I don't know if it's worth it\nor not but once you're aligned with your\npurpose it will actually become worth it\nright because now you know why you're\ndoing it now you can afford to wake up\nat 6am every day because you actually\ncare about what you're studying this is\ncaring for life makes it so much easier\nto live and so much more enjoyable so in\norder to really figure out how to make\nlife easy I don't think you should adopt\nthe anti-work view of is this all life\nis I think it's a good question\nand I don't think you should adopt the\nsigma grind set view which is just hey\nlet me work and work and work and work\nand work so that I can be successful\nlater and then I can have this gravy\ntrain like this pot of gold at the end\nof the rainbow I don't think it works\nI've worked with those people they reach\nthe end of the rainbow they enjoy\nthemselves for a couple years and they\nthey come into my office and they're\nlike I don't know what I'm doing with\nlife and then we go on this journey the\nthing is you don't have to wait until\nyou don't have to sacrifice the best\nyears of your life to discover that\npurpose is not Financial Security that\npurpose is so much more you can actually\nstart that today in fact you need to\nstart it today\nand if you can discover what your\npurpose is through this technique if you\ncan understand this then so many things\nwill become easy I know it's not\npractical for people to go to an ashram\nin India or go hiking in the mountains\nfor 10 days which is exactly why we\nbuilt a coaching program our program is\nactually designed to help people find a\nsense of purpose and what we tend to see\nis about a 58 increase in a client's\nsense of purpose in life at about 12\nweeks and what we've really found in our\nCentral hypothesis is that once you find\na reason to get out of bed in the\nmorning once you find a reason to get\noff of the internet once you find a\nreason to actually be motivated to do\nthings that are difficult for you that's\nwhat actually makes it easy for you to\naccomplish your goals"
