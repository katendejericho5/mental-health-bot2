    "transcript": "burnout doesn't come from overwork\nburnout doesn't come from laziness\nshockingly in fact the opposite burnout\ncomes from excessive effort with minimal\nbenefit for far too long in our society\nhave we taken advantage of people who\nare doing altruistic jobs and I'm\nthinking especially of like teachers and\npeople in the medical profession where\nthese are jobs that we like value almost\nlike on a moral sense right like you're\nsaving lives we're educating children\nand it's for the children what we've\nmanaged to do is create situations where\nwe take advantage of individuals\naltruism I see employees getting taken\nadvantage of the most in these two\nprofessions because you're saving lives\nlike you're doing it for a good reason\nright so why are you complaining about\nthe pay and what we also tend to see in\nin both of these professions if you look\nat like tuition right and you look at\nlike college education and things like\nthat if you look at the education\nindustry in the medical industry this is\nalso where you see like tons of profit"
