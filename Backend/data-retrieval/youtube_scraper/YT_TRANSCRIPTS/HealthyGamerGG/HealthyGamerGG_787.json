    "transcript": "so if we look at opening up to other\nhumans it's kind of weird but we think\nabout it as an internal thing how do I\nhave the courage to open up how do I\novercome this weakness I don't want to\nburden other people so here's the key\nthing to understand when it comes to\nopening up to other people it's no\nlonger a solo game suddenly there's a\nrelational component So when you say I\ndon't want to burden other people that's\nwhere the way that you resolve that is\nnot through courage you don't overcome\nyour fears of burdening other people\nthere's a relational component so what\nyou do is talk to them ask for\npermission ask for feedback hey is it\nokay if I talk to you about something\nthat's like I'm struggling with right\nnow so the whole point of opening up to\nanother human being is it's a relational\nthere's a relational component to it it\nnow involves more than one person and\nwhat we try to do is solve all the\nanxieties in our head without ever\ninteracting with the other person and so\nthe cool thing is that you don't\nactually have to have the courage to\nlike overcome all that stuff since this\nis relational you can just ask the other\nperson"
