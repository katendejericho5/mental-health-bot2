    "transcript": "foreign\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nit ain't a stream unless there's a\ntechnical difficulty chat am I right\nam I right welcome to another healthy\ngamer GG stream but this stream is\ndifferent because today we're streaming\nin a different place and talking to\ndifferent people\nand I've been reading a lot of y'all's\ncomments on the internet on this place\ncalled YouTube where we upload these\nthings called videos and on the videos\nthere are people who will leave comments\nand we realized recently that these\npeople are really amazing that they will\ntalk to us on this platform that we are\npretty unfamiliar with and so we decided\nwe're going to try something different\ntoday\nwe're going to try streaming on YouTube\nbecause I want to talk to you all so\nwelcome to another healthy gamer GG\nstream our inaugural stream on YouTube\nand\nyeah welcome so just a reminder that\nalthough I am a psychiatrist nothing we\ndiscuss on stream today is going to be\ntaken as medical advice everything is\nfor educational or entertainment\npurposes only if you all have a concern\nor question\nplease see a licensed professional\nso I'm thrilled but I need some tech\nsupport chat the first thing is I\nrealize I can't chat I can't talk to\ny'all because apparently I am not\nsubscribed in order to chat you have to\nbe a subscriber which is great please\nsubscribe\num\nand and uh I can't I can't talk\nI can't type to y'all\nbecause I'm not\nI'm not subscribed to our YouTube\nchannel\nso I gotta figure out how do I subscribe\nto our YouTube channel\nbecause I can't type\nnormally I can type\num so so maybe someone can work on that\nI will ask someone\nand guess what\nthat is going to\nthat is going to mean that we're we're\ngonna get one additional subscriber\ntoday chat already we're working on it\num and I I noticed uh someone\num had a message hello I just wanted\ncoins and capsaicin nice I just wanted\nto say I've used some of your tips to\nmake my life better thanks for all the\ncontent you create it has helped thank\nyou very much for the five dollar tip we\nappreciate it I'm really glad it's able\nto help you\num and\nyeah I I don't I can't log into anything\nright now Tech teller but\num we're really glad it's able to help\nyou where we really do appreciate the\ntip we do our best to try to keep as\nmuch of our content as free as possible\nabout 99 of it is free\num and that's great right because we're\nhere to help human beings\num\nand so now uh pin pin valavan is saying\nlove you Dr K I've been struggling\nmentally and really wanted to say thank\nyou and appreciate you for all you do\nthank you and thank you for being a\nmember of the community we really\nappreciate it so you know we're gonna\nwe're gonna do what we can\num we're gonna try to help you all and\nuh yeah so I I feel like\nthis is a very exciting day for me\nbecause\nI spend a lot of time on YouTube\nand I I feel like there's a whole pile\nof y'all that we don't ever get to\ninteract with so we've decided that it's\nit it's that's got to change right so\ny'all are everywhere on the internet and\nwe're gonna go to different places and\nhopefully if we're lucky in in 2023\nwe'll also go to places physically\nand what we're going to meet y'all we're\ngoing to hang out we're going to talk\nabout stuff we're going to understand\nour mental health a little bit better\nwe're going to understand the challenges\nthat we Face we're going to understand\nwhy life is so hard and we're going to\ntry to figure out what we can do it to\nmake it easier that is what we're all\nabout he understand yourself maybe grow\na little bit a bit maybe have some memes\nhave some fun you know\nthat's that's great so\num is the platform switch permanent I\ndon't think so or if it is it's news to\nme this is just because so so here's the\nthing to understand about our\nrelationship with platforms so we love\nbasically all the platforms\nwe're not here to succeed on a\nparticular platform we're here to try to\nhelp people with their mental health and\nso naturally what that means is okay how\nare the ways that we can reach the\npeople who are struggling how are we\nwhat are the ways that we can reach\npeople who like aren't getting help\nelsewhere and so that's really what our\nmission is aligned towards so that's\nwhat ultimately determines like who we\ncollaborate with and who we don't\num and it's just whether we can help\npeople using a particular platform and\nif the answer is yes we're there if the\nanswer is no then we're not there and\nit's not just so I know everyone's kind\nof thinking about oh like twitch and\nYouTube and whatnot but\nit's it's way more than that right so\nit's the same reason why we collaborate\nwith\nthe office of the Surgeon General the\nUnited States and it's the same reason\nwe collaborate with the United Nations\nit's like anyone Who's down to try to\nhelp it's the same reason we also work\nwith video game companies right\nsometimes parents get super confused\nbecause they're like hey aren't you\nsupposed to help people with video game\naddiction you're like damn right I'm\ngonna help people with video game\naddiction they're like why do you talk\nto video game companies because\noftentimes I know it's insane\nand it's hard to believe\nbut sometimes people at video game\ncompanies care about gamers\nthey're not actually trying to destroy\nyour life people make games because they\nlove games\nand like they're like I want to make a\nreally cool game and I I've seen this\nI'm really surprised but you know I've\nseen this that a lot of you know a lot\nof like gaming companies are all for\nreducing toxicity making things like\nmore open and acceptable and like making\ngames more fun they don't want to ruin\nyour life\nactually what they want to do is they\nwant to make sure that you are\nsuccessful therefore you have more money\ntherefore you can spend more things you\ncan\nengage in more DLC purchases and\nmicrotransactions\nit's wild\nso today you know okay so I'm going to\ntalk to y'all let's talk real quick\nabout\num\nuh so\nwe're going to talk about so I want to\ntalk about what we're talking about\ntoday all right so\nwe um streamed on a platform that shall\nnot be named\ntwo days ago and um it was somewhat of a\nI don't know what the right word is like\nthis may be arrogant for me to say but\nkind of like explosive\num\nstream in some ways and we talked a\nlittle bit about non-consensual\npornography and I've been reading all\nthe Reddit comments on our subreddit\nwhich by the way are fantastic I'd love\nto spend half an hour talking about them\nbut this is really great so first of all\nI'm really like optimistic about this\nbecause people are talking in a way that\nis like non-toxic sometimes things that\npeople can say can be hurtful or\ntriggering for other people but\ngenerally speaking people are like on\nour subredditer like hey I don't\nunderstand\nhow this can be so painful I have\ntrouble empathizing with it which is\ntotally fair right there's a huge\ndifference between someone shouldn't\nfeel that way\nand I have difficulty empathizing with\nthem and I don't see what the big deal\nis we're not saying that it isn't a big\ndeal we're saying I don't understand\nand so later we had a conversation with\nsweet Anita who is epic awesome\nintelligent articulate insightful\nand um\nso so Anita made a couple of statements\nthat really confused me she's like when\nI when I turn someone down I'm not\nrejecting them like if a man expresses\ninterest in me and I turn them out I'm\nnot rejecting them I don't even know\nthem I can't reject them and then I kind\nof did a double take\nand then what happened is\nwe were in a meeting because we\nsometimes talk about like at 8G like\nokay\nhow do we need to try to help the\ninternet today\nand so it's a really interesting meeting\nbecause there are men in the meeting and\nwomen in the meeting and like we did not\nunderstand or see eye to eye so some\nsome people like you know one woman in\nin one meeting was like I don't\nunderstand what the big deal is with the\nrejection like what's the big deal and\nall the men were like what do you mean\nwhat's the big deal\nand so I realized I don't know quite\nwhat's going on but there's some kind of\ndisconnect\nbetween\nhow rejected men feel and what the\nperception of rejection is by women\nand there's all kinds of disconnects so\nwe're not just focused on this there's\nlike all kinds of other disconnects that\nwe want to eventually get to so another\nbig one is sort of like this dichotomy\nbetween give me a chance and I can't\ntrust men right so a lot of men will get\nupset because they'll say like oh I\nnever you never gave me a chance which\nsometimes they're just wrong and they've\nactually been given a chance they just\ndon't realize it\nand not everyone is entitled for a\nChance At Romance right like if you're\nwalking down the street it's not like\nevery person that passes you is entitled\nto go on a date with you like every like\nman woman\nyou know homeless person police officer\ngrandma like\nthey're not all entitled for a chance\nfor you to fall in love with them\nso so there's a lot of stuff that's\ngoing on and I'm convinced that actually\nthese things can be improved like I\nthink we can solve this like I'm\nactually optimistic for the first time\nthat I've been in a very long time\nand and the reason is because we're like\nactually talking so the problem is that\nthe internet is a place where it does\nnot\nuh support\nlike nuanced conversation and\nunderstanding the internet is\nreactionary right so\nI'm gonna like evoke some feeling in you\nyou're gonna tweet at me that's gonna\nevoke some feeling in me and I'm gonna\nTweet back at you and we're gonna\nrestrict our discussion to like 160\ncharacters right that's what Twitter was\nbased on\nand I'm not saying that Twitter is a bad\nplatform it's a great platform for\nparticular things but having nuanced\ndiscussions on Twitter is not what\nfloats to the top and that's a big\nproblem that we've got because it's all\nabout what floats to the top\nand someone said we love you at YouTube\nhere I don't know if you mean if you are\na participator at YouTube or your\nemployer employee YouTube but either way\nbenfu we really appreciate it\nSo today we're just gonna talk to people\nokay\num about\nrejection and we're gonna try to\nunderstand like what's going on with\nlike why men feel so rejected and the\nreason we're going to focus on this it's\nnot that manner actually we don't know\nactually are men actually as rejected as\nthey feel because it's oftentimes the\nexperience of women that I'm not\nrejecting them as hard right I'm not\ntrying to use my super alt smash on them\nI'm gonna tap the a button to like\nyou know just just a tiny little uh it's\na poke it's not a critical hit and then\nthe experience of some men is like ah\nI've been critically hit it's like we're\nwatching soccer matches where where like\noh like someone bumped me and now I'm\ngonna jump into a backflip and I'm I'm\nso hurt right\num\nand uh you know so we gotta we gotta\nunderstand like what's going on with\nthis discrepancy and I see that Mike's\nhero thanks to Dr K and Andrew Tate I've\nbeen able to resolve my issues well I am\nreally really happy so curious what the\nresolution has been\nright so I'm really curious if you\nlisten to Dr K and Andrew Tate\nhow does that what resolution do you\ncome to\nand um yeah fascinating\nfascinating\nright\num\nokay so your uh last plus first is\nsaying your content helped me process\nthe end of a four-year relationship at a\nrate I never thought would be possible\nI'm proud of myself I have your your\nchannel thank you you're very welcome\nlast plus first also\num\ngive yourself some credit right so I\nthink here's here's what I think a lot a\nlot of people think that we are wise\nand very knowledgeable\nand that's sort of true but here's why\nwe exist\nso I have no doubt in my mind well this\nis really\nmessing up the hair\nI have no doubt in my mind that y'all\nwill figure this stuff out on your own\nright so if we don't have these\nconversations about why men feel so\nrejected like eventually someone will\nfigure out you will even figure out if\nyou're a man you will figure it out if\nyou're a woman you'll figure out if\nyou're non-binary we'll figure it out\nthe question is how quickly do you want\nto figure it out\nright and what we what I realized what\nwe really are is like we want y'all to\nlearn this stuff like today\nso that it doesn't take you three years\nto figure it out and in that time span\nyour life will improve because now you\nunderstand it\nright that's what we're really about so\nI was talking to one of our employees\nSometimes some time ago\nand they were saying you know what what\nthe real advantage of you is is not that\nyou know a lot it's that you made a lot\nof mistakes\nand so I I kind of hit every branch on\nthe way down like I'm a certified\nCrystal healer and the Reiki\npractitioner\nright so I like spend some time learning\nweird stuff in India\nand like that was super cool and then I\nwas like you know what maybe I should\nbecome a doctor like a medical doctor\nand maybe I should learn medicine and I\nlearned a lot of great stuff in India\nthat I still apply today that's like\nkind of like weird and esoteric and not\nscientific but here's the thing even\namongst the non-scientific things\nthere's the real BS and then there's the\nstuff that even though it's not\nscientific seems to have a lot of value\num Akshay is saying hey thanks for the\n100 rupiah donation\n[Music]\nbeen watching you for two years now I'm\nworking my dream job right now because\nof you thank you for all you've done uh\nfor all of us keep up the great work we\nwill Akshay and props to you for working\nyour dream job\nI'm glad I was able to help you but like\nI think you had something to do with it\nso let's hop in with callers and let's\ntry to figure out so what do y'all think\nchat should we understand\num\nshould we understand what's going on\nlike why men feel so rejected\nwhat do y'all think\nAkshay Kumar\nCrystal healing you can heal crystals\nyes\nI'm able to cast healing spells that\nwork on inanimate objects only\nis it true that maois or\neffective for rejection sensitivity what\non Earth what a fascinating question I\nwill look into that\nDennis bolognos what a cool question\nokay hello my friend\nhow are you oh uh muted hold on one\nsecond can you count to 10 for me\none two three thank you so much\nwelcome\nand what do you go by my friend\nlike am I Luna Luna yeah it's so awesome\nto hear you smile\nservice Smiley but thank you\nit's not hey I'll take it right better\nthan tears\num so so tell me Luna so do you have any\nthoughts on why men feel so rejected\nnowadays\num\nI think\nuh it has to do with\nthem projecting an image of themselves\nthat isn't entirely authentic which\ncreates this sort of distorted\nenvironment in which both parties don't\nentirely know the other person well\nand of course they just get rejected a\nlot sadly\nokay so that sounds fascinating can you\nexplain that or break it down a little\nbit more so you say they project an\nimage of themselves\nso what do you mean by project an image\nof themselves\num\nI've\nif I had to okay let me see\nI think we all would like to be a better\nversion of ourselves both men and women\nalike sure and I think\nwhen we do that we tend to over\nexaggerate or maybe even lie about some\nparts of ourselves that we're insecure\nabout and\nyou don't really get to know the other\nperson because of it and I feel like\npeople can feel that you're not entirely\nhonest\nso it hurts more\nbecause of that that's so interesting so\nso that's really helpful Luna so let me\njust see if I understand you so what\nyou're kind of saying is okay so men\nproject an image of themselves it's a\nbetter version of themselves maybe even\nthey like lie a little bit and then what\nhappens\num well\nI think\npeople can pick up on them not being\nentirely honest about it okay so the BS\nmeter goes off right yeah and then what\nhappens\num well then it just becomes really\nuncomfortable to talk\nto someone who isn't being entirely\nhonest\nokay um\nyeah okay so so then what happened so\ncan I ask you a little bit about if\nyou're speaking from personal experience\nI am yes yeah so can you if you feel\ncomfortable right if you don't want to\ngo to into details you don't have to but\nI'm so curious about if you could share\nlike what because I think there's a\nthere are a lot of men out there that\nare listening right now I imagine a lot\nof women will resonate with your\nexperience but\nI think it would be very illustrative\nand helpful to men if they could hear\nmore about like an example do you feel\ncomfortable sharing something like that\nyes I do\nstory time let's go thank you\nI mean it's obviously something I've\ndone myself I think this is something\nthat everyone does at some point\num thank you for adding that nuance\nof course of course I I like I just want\nto reiterate that women and men have\nseparate issues at different levels of\nnuance and it's hard to say who is\nsuffering more you can't really measure\nsuffering so anything I'm saying I am\nnot being like oh this is true or this\nis 100 years not at all I I honestly\nreally appreciate that I think this kind\nof discussion needs that sort of nuance\nbut I'd love to hear what your actual\nexperience like was with you know yes\num\nso in high school which was I think like\nuh four year five four or five years ago\nI don't really remember\num I was beginning to experiment with\nrelationships\nand I met someone who seemed like he was\nvery confident\nand he seemed to be interested in almost\neverything I liked\num stuff like anime and\nfanfiction stuff like that oh my\ngoodness you're only embarrassed about\nhe was like oh yeah I like that like\nyeah because if you're interested in\nanime and fan fiction I imagine you get\njudged harshly for that a lot\nuh in high school yeah I mean so\nsometimes okay so Along Comes This dude\nwho loves anime and fan fiction yeah\nand he found it hard to\nfind an answer so he just picked\nsomething like Naruto and I was like oh\ncool\nlike I don't know how to put it it's\njust\nwhen we finally got into a relationship\nafter like months of talking and\nsocializing\nhe fessed up and he was like okay so I\ndon't actually like fan fiction I think\nit's kind of weird and I was like\nwow\nyeah I was like damn man you didn't have\nto lie about it and how how did it feel\nfor you for him to fake liking fan\nfiction\nI I don't like I've been talking to him\nabout fan fiction a lot something I was\ngenuinely embarrassed by in high school\nwhich is why I didn't talk about it very\nmuch\nand I talked to him maybe like hours\nabout it and he seemed so interested and\nI thought oh my God I found someone who\nisn't judging me for it and then once\ndown the line he just said I think it's\nweird and I'm like yeah but oh my God I\nI can imagine so what what kind of felt\nworse the lying or the judgment\nI think\nI don't know they're both equally\nimportant okay\num okay fair\nbut I think the judgments\nfrom someone who listened to me talk\nabout it a lot sure\nso so yeah I see what you mean it's not\njust I mean like maybe it would have\nbeen okay if they judged you a little\nbit and were honest about it\nor it would have been okay if they were\nit's the two together the fact that they\nkind of misled you and so then I I'm did\nyou break up with them or what happened\num so that that was around the time I\ngot in therapy and uh\nit was It was kind of intensive therapy\nand my therapist kind of guided me\nthroughout everything and at some point\nI just realized\nI don't actually know my boyfriend very\nwell as I thought I did\nokay and he's not really making me feel\nlike a better person because now it\nfeels uncomfortable talking about my\ninterest to him because if he's capable\nof\nlying about stuff like that in order to\nin that moment it felt like it was he he\nwas doing it in order to get closer to\nme I didn't feel very safe in the\nrelationship\nso yeah yeah absolutely and but so so\nbut is it clear that he felt very\nrejected by what you did\noh yeah how how did that manifest when\nyou say oh yeah that sounds\nit was bad how so\nwell we had this friend group\num and it was mostly his friend group\nand when I broke up with him I think it\nwas in like during summer break so when\nsummer break was over I obviously\ncouldn't be in his friend group anymore\num and then apparently he was gossiping\nto his to the friend group about our\nrelationship\nand I don't think he meant anything bad\nby it per se but I feel like he felt\nreally\nrejected I don't know if it counts in\nthis context but no yeah sure so it's\njust something about the way that he was\ntalking about you you kind of inferred\nthat he felt rejected\nyeah\nand and but so did he\nokay that makes a lot of sense\num\nI mean but but just just to clarify so\nit sounds like you guys didn't have much\ncontact after that and you sort of heard\nyeah\nokay um it was\nI don't know he just seemed vindictive\nfor a while and what what did that how\ndid that vindictiveness manifest\nI just kept hearing from\nlike this one person in the friend group\nthat he was saying stuff\nabout our relationship without ever\nreally going into it\nand that was very confusing for me at\nthe time and\nI contemplated talking to him about it\nbut the relationship wasn't that great\nuh so what kind of stuff was he saying\nabout the relationship\nno exactly I don't remember it yeah it\nsounds like it was four or five years\nago so it makes sense yeah\nso so it sounds like he was kind of like\nnot going into too much detail but there\nwas definitely I mean because if this\nfriend kept telling you about it there\nmust have been some kind of\nyou know emotional energy behind your\nex-boyfriend's statements\nyeah okay\nso\njust to make sure I kind of understand\nwhat you're saying so like if I can try\nto summarize for a second is there\nanything else you want to add by the way\nI don't know if I gave the right example\nhere\nand starting to regret telling the story\nwhat makes you regret telling the story\nI mean it's just so embarrassing and\nit's I think it's such a high school\nlevel stuff you know yeah I mean so I I\ntotally understand\nif I can say this and you got to set me\nstraight okay Luna the story the story\nis a touch cringe\nbe honest like that's what high school\nis about so like here's the problem is\nwe judge people for being cringe\nlike in high school cringes the norm\nlike is it cringe sure but here's the\nproblem there's nothing wrong with\ncringe\nlike how else are we supposed to learn\nthis stuff like we're gonna you know\nit's like\nwhen I install a new video game and I go\ninto matchmaking I get crushed and it's\nkind of cringe\nand like I I literally I I literally one\ntime had this girl give me my number and\nI didn't even understand what she was\ndoing and I made her cry because it was\nit was awful it like the cringe just and\nit like cringe is a normal part of human\ndevelopment\nyeah that's true and and so I'm really\nglad you added that you shared this\nexample because I think what it's going\nto do is hopefully people out there who\nare still in high school and going\nthrough stuff like this hopefully one of\nthem hears your story\nand you're kind of like tanking it for\nus right because you're exposing\nyourself to the cringe I mean you're\nyou're sharing the cringe and then\nhopefully other people out there\nhonestly like I believe this I believe\nyou're doing good in the world\nand I also think that your your story is\ngood because I think that there's a lot\nof questions there right so this is the\nexperience of a woman who who\nexperience some amount of you know like\ndudes getting really really upset and\nyou shared your perspective and I think\nyou also did a fantastic job of kind of\nhighlighting that when we start meeting\nwith someone\nwe kind of like fake ourselves a little\nbit we pump ourselves up a little bit we\npretend to be something that we're not\nto get closer to someone it's men do it\nwomen do it\nyou know yeah yeah and and so then\nwe sometimes maybe opening ourselves up\nfor some amount of rejection because\nwe're not really authentically\nexpressing Who We Are\nyeah\ncan I ask you uh one more question\nsure so let's say I'm a dude who\nauthentically feels like I'm a waste of\nspace I'm not going anywhere in life\nI've got nothing going for me\nthat's not attractive right\nthat's not no so how would you\nlet's say that I'm lonely and I'm\nattracted to someone but my experience\nof my authentic self is not very\npositive what do you think I should do\nhonestly\nI've\npersonally been there as well cool that\nwas like great I mean not great that\nyou've been there but\nyou know but but I'd love to hear when\nyou say you've been there that implies\nyou're not there now\nmaybe after this call you'll slide back\na little bit\nokay but seriously I'd love to hear how\ndid you how did you come out of that\nthis sounds ironic but I've accepted the\ncringe with specific people\num I like\nI know my interests aren't always\nmainstream and I ramble a lot and I'm\nnot very good at socializing\num\nstuff like that and\none day I just went well I like things\nand I can't be the only one who likes\nthem\nand people like other people who have\npassion for something so I might as well\nreally like it and really be honest\nabout it\num\nand that's\nthat's sort of how I met my current\nboyfriends who encouraged me to ramble\nabout stuff without lying about\nliking fanfiction or not and like this\nlike\num I'm a really awkward person I think\nalmost everyone has realized it by now\nI'm really awkward\num\nbut he tells me to just be awkward and\nbe weird because at least that way your\ntrue to yourself and\nsure it might not apply to everyone\nbut I think if you just find parts of\nyourself that you just like a little bit\nyou might as well share it\num obviously not push it down people's\nfaces don't just go oh I love fanfiction\njust be like okay let me read you my fan\nfiction you're sitting next to me on an\neight-hour flight\ngets trapped him\nhere we go\nlet's do that\nexample\nsitting in my uni cafeteria and just\nlike suddenly I went okay but I don't\nagree with the end ship from Avatar The\nLast Airbender and my classmates were\nlike what the hell are you talking about\nso I went in through this 20 minute rant\nabout how I don't believe Katara and Ang\nwere meant to be together and then this\ngirl from another table is like yeah I\nagree and sometimes I still talk to her\nnow\nokay so Luna\nI don't think you're awkward at all I\nthink you're a great person until you\ndidn't give us a spoiler warning\nsorry\nshould we refer to serious but not for\nlike 10 years now I know that's fair\nyeah I'm\nyeah okay fair enough so so I'm I'm kind\nof hearing that that maybe so this is\nactually really interesting because\nso if someone doesn't believe that if\nsomeone thinks of themselves in a very\nlow way\nI'm almost like hearing that\nI'm trying to think about how to say\nthis because this actually sounds so\nthat self-acceptance makes you realize\nthat you may be judging yourself\nbased on a standard of like other people\nand so instead of living up to their\nstandard which is what a lot of people\ntry to do when they feel pathetic right\nlike I have to be a better human being I\nhave to live up to the standard I mean I\ndon't think this is really accurate but\nin a way you have to adjust the standard\nto you it's not lowering your standard I\nthink it's really just picking a\ndifferent direction and saying actually\nthis is who I am and that's okay other\npeople don't have to like it there's a\nlot of like self-acceptance in there\nwhich is you know how you started to\ndevelop confidence and it sounds like\nit's working out well for you\nyeah it's I'm pretty sure you've heard\nof it but it's this thing called radical\nacceptance\nobviously totally different meaning but\nlike just\npeople will like you there's eight\nbillion people in the world and\nif you have to\num how to put this\nit\nyou shouldn't be ashamed of the things\nthat you like when you talk about them\nit's awkward and sometimes people will\nfind it weird and maybe even some people\nwill be creeped out by it but just like\nthat girl on the other side of the table\nbeing like yeah I agree you know there's\npeople out there who are like that and I\ndon't know it's\noh man\nokay that makes a lot of sense\nso I'm glad\nyeah I think that that makes a lot of\nsense\nand and so it sounds like you're doing a\nlittle bit better radical acceptance has\nhelped you a lot\nand um\nit sounds like you're you sound happy\nLuna\nI am I am really happy yes yeah thank\nyou so much for sharing your perspective\nof course thank you for having me here\ntake care\nyou too\nalrighty\nhello\nhello\nwelcome my friend\nhello\ncan you tell me um what you go by or how\nyou'd like to be addressed I mean my\nname is Elena Elena nice to meet you\nElena welcome\nnice to meet you too\num and can you tell me a little bit\nabout why you think men feel so rejected\nnowadays\nsure\num I've been listening to the stream so\nuh I was just I thought about it\num\nand honestly I think maybe they put\nwomen on a pedestal a little bit too\nmuch what do you mean by that\nso\num\nhow do I say this so like here's kind of\nmy beef\num I was single until I was 26. and\nthat's when I got my very first\nboyfriend though it's really interesting\nto me because a lot of a lot of the\ndialogue is about being single for a\nreally long time and like I relate to\nthat but I'm also a woman right so\nsorry because a lot of people a lot of\npeople you need to remember to breathe a\nlot of people don't realize that women\ncan be single too and be lonely\nyou know so I think that's part of it I\nthink\nso like in my experience I also had a\nlot of insecurities\nand even when people hit on me I never\neven realized it until like years later\nbecause at the time I had such like low\nself-worth\nthat I thought they were\njoking\num\nso it's just to me it's interesting\nbecause I think a lot of the rejections\nmight just be like misunderstandings\nhow so and obviously like hmm\noh I\nokay yeah I made okay maybe this is what\nyou meant so like people are feeling\nrejected but you didn't like\nintentionally reject them you were just\noblivious\nis that what you mean sorry that is what\nI meant okay yeah\nthat's interesting\nyeah so this is just kind of like my\nangle on it\num\nbecause I've had a lot of experiences I\nguess what I'll do is I'll just go into\nstory mode please\num I did have one experience uh at a\nparty one time and like for example I\nwas wearing a pink wig for some reason I\ndon't even know I was in film school so\nthere's just random crap around\num and some guy came up to me and he\nstarted hitting on me but all he was\ntalking about was the pink wig\nso like in my mind I was like wow this\nwig is really attractive and like it was\nnothing about me you know what I mean\nhmm\nso then I went to talk to one of my guy\nfriends and I like was laughing and like\nany time he was like let's hang out I'd\nbe like\num and then I talked to one of my other\nguy friends which was interesting he was\nlike you really like turned that guy\ndown and I was like what\nand in his mind it was a rejection but\nin my mind I thought the entire\nsituation was a joke\nand you were the butt of the joke\nnow I was the joke yeah I think like\nand so\nthis is just kind of like one example\num I hope I'm making sense\num well can I tell you what I heard and\nthen you tell me if you're making sense\nokay\nso\nwhat I'm hearing is that you have your\nown internal environment and that when a\nman approaches you\nand like does things like wants to ask\nyou if you want to hang out and it\ncompliments an article of clothing I\ndon't know if wig counts that you're\nwearing\nin his mind this is the way that you ask\na girl out but in your mind you're like\nthis is crazy there's no way that\nsomeone would ever ask me out or they're\nmaking fun of me or they must really\nlike wigs\nand and so they're yeah you know so\nthey're like sending a signal that that\nyou're not receiving\nand so then\nI I think it kind of makes sense because\nin your mind you're not like rejecting\nthis person like if you had even\nunderstood that they were asking you out\nyou may have even said yes you just\ndidn't understand that\nand they're coming away with like you\nnot saying yes so they kind of feel\nrejected because they kind of shot their\nshot\nyeah and I think that's also part of the\nreason why I say like the the pedestal\nthing because it's kind of like for some\nreason they think the woman's gonna\nunderstand them from the get-go and\nunderstand the situation when really it\ndoesn't it doesn't like that doesn't\nmean that we do understand\nso I see so so when you say like put\nwomen on a pedestal I'm not hearing you\nkind of say like oh women are like\nperfect and deserve to be whatever it's\njust like that it's not like women are\ntelepathic\nyeah it's kind of like they're just\ndifferent from us when they're not\ndifferent from us maybe that's really\nwhat it is what do you mean by that\nsorry I was talking for the men for\npoint of view for some reason it's kind\nof like like women are their own thing\nwomen are going to do this or they're\ngoing to do that when truthfully like\neveryone is just a person\nand it's just one of those situations\nwhere maybe a woman will accept\nyour compliments but maybe another\nperson won't\nand that's just completely\nindividualized I see okay so so it's\nkind of they're just sort of assumptions\nabout\nuh what I'm kind of hearing you say is\nthat men need to really tailor their\napproaches to\na woman's communication Style\nyeah I mean that's\nI tailored approach just\nin general sure with humans the best bet\nyeah with humans so quick question Elena\njust just now now that you're in a\ndifferent place\nso in my mind and maybe this is because\nI'm a dude so I'd love to get to the if\nthere is a discrepancy here if I'm\ntalking to a girl I compliment her\nclothing and then I ask her if she wants\nto hang out\nto me that's sort of like that's asking\nsomeone out like that's not\nyou know\nbeing kind of beating around the bush is\nthat do you think that that's a fair\nassessment\nor or do you think that it really needs\nto be more explicit\nlike that's kind of asking someone out\nright like\nthat is that is kind of asking someone\nout I get that I think a lot of that\neven what another scenario I was\nthinking of was often like at a bar like\nif you're like you want to hang out\nlater at the bar then it might totally\ndepend on like what I'm doing that day\num because I could be there with like\nfriends that I've never seen in a long\ntime and like maybe in the situation it\nmay feel a rejection because I'm like\nyou know I don't like I don't have time\nfor that right now but truthfully it's\nlike in my mind I'm not necessarily\nrejecting you or your offer it's just I\nliterally don't have the time to hang\nout right now like I'm here for other\nthings\nand so in in that kind of situation what\nwould you say\nwhat I what I would say\num\ninteresting\ntotally that one defense I guess they\nwould depend partially if I find them\ninteresting maybe what I do is\num\nI might say maybe later like\nokay\num I don't know because so like I don't\nthink I'd ever just randomly give\nsomebody my number okay\num but if they gave me their number and\nwas like text me later if you want to\nhang out then maybe I'm more inclined to\ntext them later if I am interested I see\nokay because I I I kind of see what I\nthink what you're saying Elena makes a\nton of ton of sense so on the one hand\nyou know for men to understand that\nlike y'all aren't omniscient or\ntelepathic I I do it's it's kind of it\nhelps me to understand a little bit that\nin retrospect like you know if you were\nin a more confident place and a little\nbit less insecure you would have\nrecognized that someone was asking you\nout\nbut it's not I think that there's a\nlarge gray area there right\nin terms of like some like because the\nperson the dude could have been more\nexplicit\nor you know the person who's being asked\nout could be less insecure in either of\nthose works is that fair\nyeah\nand then the other thing is that I I\nthink a lot of this may depend on\nwhat you say\nand also how people interpret the\nrejection which I think there's a\nbalance of as well because I think you\nmake a really good point that sometimes\nthe reason that if someone if a person a\nasks out person B men women whatever and\nperson B says\nnot right now or it's not that you know\nlike if if people are clear that like oh\nit's not it doesn't that has nothing to\ndo with you it's like I'm not looking\nfor a relationship right now and I've\nseen a lot of people who will take that\nvery personally\nyeah and I think like I've seen that a\nlot too and I know a lot of women who\nlike literally just don't want a\nrelationship\nand it's hard because it's not that we\ndon't feel guilty sometimes too and it's\nnot that we don't understand that it's\nnice to have someone care about us but\nit's just maybe we just got out of a bad\nrelationship or maybe there's just like\nwe've got families and we've got friends\nand sometimes there's just a lot going\non that we don't have like the resources\nto take on a relationship as well yeah\nmakes a lot of sense\nand and do you think that um of the\npeople that you know you said a lot of\nwomen you know are not just looking for\na relationship do they kind of\narticulate that point and men still take\nit personally or what do you think\nhappens there\nwell it's a mixed bag honestly it's a\nmixed bag I've had guys take rejection\nreally well and I've had guys take\num what I didn't even think was a\nrejection\num you know as a rejection basically can\nyou get the like\nno no I didn't cut out I interrupted you\nand I stopped talking so I apologize but\num because you're you're I just felt bad\nfor interrupting you but what I was\nreally curious about is you you've had\nguys who take it well and guys who take\nit poorly I'd love to I love it if you\ncould pay to paint a picture of that if\nyou feel comfortable doing that and if\nit comes to memory\num\nso there's one situation that I can\nthink of I was at a bar and a guy\noffered to buy me a drink\num and I said no because I was there\nwith some friends and I just like I\nwasn't interested in just I feel like if\nsomeone's gonna buy you a drink you kind\nof are indebted to talk to with them for\na little while sure\num so I just I was kind of like like I\nknow I'm not I'm not here for that and\nthen he got very pushy and he was like\nno I really want to give you a drink\nlike no why why aren't you letting me\nbuy you a drink all I'm doing is trying\nto offer you a drink and it was just\nlike uh like the pushiness came off as\nreally aggressive and like that was\nunattractive\num so then after that whenever people\noffered me a drink I would just be like\nyeah you know what buy me a drink and\nthen I would just walk away and like\nthat's rude and it might be seen as\nrejection but like from my point of view\nI had that one experience that was kind\nof like if you're gonna offer me a drink\nthat's on you\num so that was kind of like taking your\nrejection not well\num and then I have had like situations\num I was seeing somebody off and on it\nwas weird situation but\num long story short I just started\nseeing someone else seriously and I just\nhe was like hey do you want to hang out\nand I literally just told him I was like\nI'm seeing somebody seriously\num this isn't like happening anymore\nand he was like cool and then that was\nit\ncool\noh yeah Elena absolutely enlightening I\nI also I mean huh\nwhat\ndid you say sorry\nyeah I said sorry why\nuh because I'm Canadian and I think\nthat's just our punctuation sometimes oh\nokay no I was like this is absolutely\nenlightening you're like sorry and I was\nlike wait were you trying to deceit like\nI'm gonna be\num but yeah so I I also really like the\ninsight into how you so it sounds like\nthere used to be an Elena who was like I\nunderstand\nthat if someone buys me a drink there's\na reciprocity\nthat they're they're not just buying me\na drink and it's like here take this\nfree beverage and go live your life and\nI shall go live my life and we shall\nnever part ways\nright yeah and and so you acknowledge\nthat like when someone buys you a drink\nthere's like this unspoken sort of like\nsocial rule that like oh like if you\naccept the drink like that's an offer of\nit's an expression of Interest which you\neither accept or reject and then what\nhappens is like you have one experience\nor maybe more than one we just heard one\nwhere someone's like super pushy and\nthen you've like learned or adapted that\nwhat I'm gonna do is just take the drink\nand walk away if I'm not interested in\nthe person like I can't be having this\nconversation with every person tries to\nbuy me a drink you almost learn like an\nAdaptive strategy which is like they're\npushy dudes out there and and that's\njust\nyou've adapted to the environment\nyeah and honestly like I feel bad\nbecause I'm sure there's lots of people\nthat aren't pushy at all\num and they might be the ones that feel\nas though they're losing out yeah um but\nit makes you feel better being pushy is\nnot helping\num yeah so I mean I think that's that\nit's it's really I personally learned a\nlot from that because I think that part\nof the problem that I think a lot of\ntrouble uh one of the things that I\nthink a lot of men have trouble\nunderstanding is that\na woman has to build her social\nstrategies not based on\nyou know you protect against the worst\ncase scenario usually\nyou don't plan for the average scenario\nif that kind of makes sense\nsorry can you repeat that yeah so like\nlike so so for example when when you\nknow when you're when someone offers you\na drink at the bar your behavior is\ngoing to be waste based on the worst\ncase scenario not the average scenario\nyeah that's that's fair and and I think\nthat's something that you know that's\nlike more than fair honestly yeah and I\nthink that that's something that gets\nlost and a lot of men feel unfairly\njudged which in a sense they are because\nbut but it's it's kind of like a\nadaptation right because if you start if\nyou start saying no how many pushy dudes\nare you gonna piss off\nand pissing off a pushy dude\nhurts more costs more than\num taking advantage of\na nice guy\nI'm trying to figure out a more\ncompassionate way to say that but\nI couldn't find the words\nbecause I think that paints\ndoes that paint me badly those words I\nthink taking advantage I think paints\nyou in a bad light but I I mean I just\ncouldn't find a better word I don't I\ndon't think you're taking advantage of\npeople on purpose I think it's just\npissing off pushy dudes costs more than\nmildly pissing off nice people well\nmaybe that's a better way to put it yeah\nwell and like I guess one of those\nthings well does something happen are\nyou still there yeah I'm here hello\nokay sorry I just heard beep\num yeah no will pissing off a pushy dude\nalso puts you in more dangerous\nsituations\nand that's when you have to tell your\ngirlfriends that you're watching out for\nthis one guy and make sure that you're\nnot alone together and it's just like\nyou know it's a sad reality but a lot of\nus are put in dangerous situations and\nit's like on media and stuff like that\nand it's something that we have to be\nconsiderate of\num and then you might be a nice guy and\nyou might come up to us and be like you\nknow I'm a nice guy I'm not going to do\nthat to you but like thank you for\nbringing it up I wasn't thinking about\nit and now I don't trust you you know\nlike it's a lose-lose situation and I do\nfeel bad because I feel like a lot of\nguys are rejected and the truth is they\nprobably are there is a ton of rejection\nI think there's a lot of rejection for\nboth genders\num maybe you guys feel more pressured to\nask people out more often and that's why\nthey also feel as though they're getting\nrejected more often\num but it's just it's hard because like\nwe have to navigate\nboth safety and interest and it's just\nlike\nand then honestly sometimes we don't\neven want to\nyeah right sometimes we're literally at\nthe bar celebrating a friend's birthday\nand like we don't even care I'm with you\nI think that makes a lot of sense I I\nreally love this sentence that you used\nwhich is we have to navigate safety and\ninterest and most of the men that I've\ntalked to and and hopefully we'll talk\nto men pretty soon but\num I think that they don't quite have\nthat same experience of like what two\nvariables are they navigating I don't\nthink safety is a big part of their\nequation in in this situation\nthank you very much Elena anything else\nyou want to add\nno I'm good\nawesome honestly thank you from the\nbottom of my heart for sharing your\nexperiences and and your take on this\nsituation I hope it'll help people\nyeah I hope it's helpful too\nlet's go\nhello\noh hello\noh okay\nThanks Elena\nI know sorry I don't know how to hang up\none second\n[Laughter]\nhi\nwhere do you go about my friend\num You can call me Tommy all right Tommy\nso Tommy tell me a little bit uh about\nwhy men feel more rejected\nso basically\na lot of this is just from personal like\nanecdotal experience but um\nwhen I speak to you know my female\nfriends\nthey seem to have a lot of options you\nknow\nthey have a lot of men that are\ninterested in them\num if you look on you know if they\nsometimes you know if you look on their\nTinder you know I don't know if you're\njust having fun like oh let's see your\nTinder\nthey've got hundreds and hundreds of\nmatches hundreds of likes\num and that's pretty much you know every\nall of my female friends you know\nregardless of like\nI don't know their social status or how\ngood looking they are or whatever\nwhereas if you look at you know my male\nfriends or talk to my male friends about\nlike their dating lives you know\nthey don't really seem to have\nany options if you look at their tinders\nyou know\nthey're getting like\nfive likes or you know matches or some\nof them that some of them are getting\nlike nothing at all\num\nso I think a big part of it is\nis essentially that is like women seem\nto have a lot of options for some reason\nand men don't really seem to have many\nin comparison so how does that relate to\nfeeling rejected or getting rejected\nso\nbasically\nI think of it like\num\nso\nI this is I don't know if this example\nis going to make any sense\nbut um so I'm I really like film I\nreally like movies and I watch a lot of\nfilms I watch a lot of movies\num\nand kind of as a result of that\nif I watch Like an average movie it's\nkind of extremely boring to me because\nI'm thinking you know like\noh you know I saw one last week that was\nlike that was a nine out of 10 or a 10\nout of 10 like why\nyou know why would I bother with like\nthis average movie you know I wouldn't\neven like I'm not even gonna bother\nwatching it\num\nwhere someone like my mum my mum doesn't\nwatch like any movies any films\nso she's kind of satisfied with any like\nshe can watch the most average film in\nthe world and she will like it will it\nwill blow her mind essentially\nI think it's a little bit similar in\nterms of like\nthe\naverage woman you know\nisn't gonna feel like she if she I don't\nknow if she's talking to an average man\nshe might feel like\nshe can do better because she has a lot\nof options\nwhereas like that average man\nit feels this is just from my personal\nexperience it feels a little like\ndesperate like talking to women you know\nbecause you're thinking or I'm thinking\nshall I say\nyou know she's talking to me for now but\nyou know\nshe'll be talking to other people and\nyou know some of them they're probably\nbetter lacking than me or they've got\nmore money than me or you know whatever\nit is so you kind of feel like you're in\na precarious\nposition and you end up feeling like\nrejected a lot because you know they'll\njust like move on to what they perceive\nto be like a better option after a while\nokay so I think that\nI can understand a lot of what you're\nsaying and some of it confuses me\nso let me start with this so one thing\nthat I'm kind of noticing is that\nif I've got a hundred options\nyeah\nand if someone else has one option one\nrejection is worth a lot more\nright so if I get rejected by one person\nand I've got 99 people other options\nit's like not a big deal exactly but if\nI've got one option so it's it's kind of\nlike each rejection is worth so much\nmore in terms of like the percentage of\nmy chances yeah so so one rejection is\nlike no big deal it's like a one percent\nhit who cares yeah whereas for some\npeople that one rejection is all of\ntheir chances yes exactly yes\num\nand and I'm noticing someone in chat\njust said and the other thing here is\nthat when you've got that one match that\nalso means that 99 people have already\nrejected you which is a great Point too\nwhen it comes to online dating right\nbecause you're getting rejected all the\ntime the one thing that kind of confuses\nme and I don't fault you for feeling\nthis way Tommy but I'm really glad you\nshared this is you're kind of saying\nokay if she's talking to me\nyeah\neventually she's going to talk to\nsomeone who's got more money or better\nlooking or things like that\nyeah and then that makes you feel\nrejected\num well not in the moment that they're\nyou know talking to you it's more you\nfeel like\nyou feel like you're in a precarious\nposition you know you're like um oh God\nI can't mess this up I can't say the\nwrong thing because you know it like if\nyou make one mistake it's over and then\nI end up feeling rejected again\nbut but do things end and that's when\nyou feel rejected\num\nyeah I mean I guess\nI guess you could say in a set oh go on\nyeah because I mean what I'm almost\nhearing is like\nyou know so human beings will prepare\nthemselves\nfor pain\nso it's like if I'm gonna go get a shot\nat the doctor like I know it's gonna\nhurt I know it's gonna hurt I know it's\ngonna hurt and I kind of like mentally\nprepare myself for it I'm wondering if\nlike part of the preparation for\nrejection is to start like start the\nprocess now because we know it's coming\nyes I would say so yes\nso here's here's one thing that highly\nconcerns me is that first of all maybe\nthe reason so this could become a\nself-fulfilling prophecy because if\nyou're talking to someone who's\ninterested in you\nand you start losing confidence because\nof the Specter of someone better than\nyou\nyeah that that lack of confidence\nor even the lack of faith in the other\nperson may facilitate them picking\nsomeone else\nyes\nI completely agree\num\nalthough I would say to not feel\nto to basically I feel like to not let\nthat get if you've been rejected\nyou know like we were saying before you\nknow you don't have a lot of options and\nthen you get you get rejected by one\nperson then another then another I do\nagree that then it becomes if you start\nidentifying with like oh I'm like the\nperson that gets rejected it's gonna\nit's gonna make it more difficult\nbecause then you're I identifying with\nbeing the rejected one\nbut at the same time if you do get\nrejected a lot it is quite I feel like\nyou have to have quite a you know High\nConstitution to like not let that so\nyeah 100 so so I want to be clear with\nwhat I'm saying\nyou\nessentially like being when someone's\ntalking to you and you're afraid that\nyou're eventually going to get rejected\nresults in low self-confidence that low\nself-confidence then actually increases\nyour likelihood of rejection\nyeah and so it becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy now a lot of people who are\nlistening to this may think ah therefore\nthe problem is that the man loses\nconfidence which is the root of the\nproblem because you are expecting\nrejection when you really shouldn't be\nexpecting rejection whereas if people\nthink oh the problem is that the man\nshould be more confident I don't think\nthat's fair to say because there's a\nreason why you started reject expecting\nrejection in the first place\nyeah right so there have been and I\nthink you kind of alluded to that is\nthat this is like a pattern at which\npoint once again we start adapting to\nour experiences and people don't\npeople who are I mean this sounds kind\nof weird but like I don't think people\nrealize people are like how do I gain\nconfidence how do I gain confidence you\ndon't gain confidence confidence is\nactually the default state so if you\nlook at like a one-year-old or a\ntwo-year-old or a three-year-old or a\nfive-year-old\nyeah a normal five-year-old will be\nconfident\nconfidence is something that is taken\naway from people through experience yeah\nit's not something that you can ever\ngain it's only something that you can\nlose\nand so if there are men out there who\nare like oh like this is doomed to\nfailure and they're better people out\nthere there's some reason they form that\nconclusion they're not just like pulling\nthat conclusion out of their ass\nyeah I completely agree\num\nso I don't actually know why you might\nknow more about this than I do um I\ndon't know why it feels like that or it\nseems like you know women have more\noptions than men because you know\nthere's about the same amount\nof women as there are to men so\nI don't know what do you think about\nthat like why or do you even agree with\nme I don't know if you agree with me in\nterms of like you think women on average\nhave more options than men are so it's a\ngood question so\num let's just think through a couple\nthings so a lot of times people like\nyourself will make assumptions that\nsince there's the same number of men and\nwomen\nyeah\num\nshouldn't it mean that people kind of\nget rejected the same amount because we\nkind of end up generally speaking like\nin monogamous relationships that's not\nnecessarily the case so like let me just\ngive you an example of like some issues\nof gender Dynamics a lot of women will\nbelieve that\nthere are a lot of men out there who are\n[ __ ]\nso so let's assume that there are 10 men\nout there one is an [ __ ] and nine are\ndecent human beings\nand if you ask women what percentage of\nmen are [ __ ] they may say 50 percent\nand so then you start to wonder about\nthat and then you if you actually dig\ninto it this is sort of what I\ndiscovered is that the one [ __ ]\nis mean to one person gets dumped and\nthen moves on to the second and moves on\nto the third moves on to the fourth\nmoves on to the fifth moves on to the\nsixth moves under the seventh so the one\n[ __ ] gets around a lot more\nyeah so they're they're over represented\nin the sample which gives people and and\nthen dudes are confused because we're\nlike wait like 90 of us are decent human\nbeings\nand then women will say like 50 of the\npeople I've dated are [ __ ] that's\nbecause the [ __ ] like don't aren't\nable to sustain a relationship and they\nkeep bouncing around\nand frequently the adaptation of the\n[ __ ] is to lure people into a false\nrelationship\nright so then they like talk a big game\nand then don't deliver it so I think\nthere are all kinds of reasons why a 50\n50 ratio doesn't have to result in like\na 50 50 experience\nokay so you're saying like you know if\nyou're a nice I don't know just like a\nnice normal person you're more likely to\nbe in a healthy relationship where\nyou're going to be with like one person\nfor like a longer amount of time so then\nyou're not going from like person to\nperson like an [ __ ] would like yeah\nso yeah and there's a colloquial sense\nof this which I imagine is somewhat true\nalthough it's worthwhile and now I'm\ngonna look at the research but you know\nthere's this idea that the good ones get\ntaken\nyeah and so what happens is like since\nthe good ones are pairing off and like\nleaving the pool like what are you left\nwith\nyeah and so yeah so you know if if we\nsay 50 of humans or let's say 90 of\nhumans are decent\nand then out of those 90 that are decent\nif 45 of them\nare pairing up and leaving the pool\nthat means that out of the 55 percent\nare are left you know now suddenly we've\ngone from 10 [ __ ] to 20 [ __ ] in\nthe pool\nand it could be worse\nright so like it could be that 75\npercent of people meet up and are kind\nof like out of the pool\nmm-hmm\nand then\nyeah so I think that's just I I don't\nreally know though but it's worth\nthinking about the other thing that kind\nof confuses me though is it seems that\nmen and women are both having difficulty\nfinding relationships more so now\nso I I don't I don't think that nice\nones get taken or if something is\nchanging that I think that used to be\nmore true than it is now\nyeah I feel like\nso I say women have more options in\ngeneral but it feels like they this is\nmostly anecdotal\nbut um you know a lot of the women I\ntalk to they will\nit's like they will see quite a lot of\npeople you know but it won't it will be\nthings that don't last very long\num\nyou know yeah they won't be I don't know\nthat many people\nI get I don't know about you you're\nobviously in a different situation to me\nbut I know so many people that just like\nkind of bounce around from relationship\nto relationship I don't know that many\npeople who have like been with one\nperson for a long amount of time and\nlike they're do you know what I mean\nyeah no I'm I'm with you so so my\nexperience is the exact opposite so I\ndon't know a single person in my Social\nCircle who bounces around\nthat was okay you know so like once you\nmove out to The Burbs with your family\nand you go to the playground and you go\nto your kids whatever you're surrounded\nby other people that have been in\nlargely stable relationships for like 10\nyears\nyeah\nyeah I would say yeah it probably\ndepends on like you know I feel like\nclass is an issue as well so for example\num I'm I'm from a very working class\narea\num and my my parents you know have been\ntogether since I was born and they're\nstill together\num I don't think I have a single friend\nwhose parents are like together they're\nalmost they're almost all separated\num\nso then I feel like you know that\nprobably looks like the Next Generation\nUm\nso so just to kind of summarize Tommy\nI'm hearing you kind of say that here\nare the kind of takeaways I have from\nour conversation if you have more to add\nplease please do but uh the first is\nthat\none thing I'm really taking away is that\none rejection\nis percentage-wise way worse for dudes\nyes because you don't have yeah and so\nmaybe one reason that they feel more\nrejected is because like we don't have\nif you're a dude you don't have like\ntons of options like you've got one\noption maybe two maybe three and so it's\nlike each one each one matters a lot\nmore\nyeah it's like a a millionaire losing\nyou know 100 pounds versus like a poor\nperson losing a hundred pounds sure it's\nlike it's the same amount of money but\nit's a lot worse for yeah and and then\nI'm I'm also hearing that that you'll\nkind of acknowledge that there's some\nweird like the process of rejection\nactually starts early and maybe even\nbefore you get rejected\nyeah and and which makes you more likely\nto get rejected right so there could be\nsome amount of like lack of confidence\nwhich then is not attractive and and\nresults in someone else kind of pursuing\nor you know getting attracted to someone\nelse or and I've seen this where\nsometimes men will not just men but just\npeople who lack confidence will actually\ndo a lot of stuff to drive their\nPartners away\nyes where they'll start to say oh you're\ngonna find someone better than me and\nthen the person is like no I won't why\nare you saying like no I'm like I'm with\nyou because I want to be with you no\nyou're going to find someone better no\nyou're gonna find someone better and\nthen what they actually do is they just\npiss the other person off\nyeah\nand then they're like oh my God yeah I\ntold you so I knew it I knew it all\nalong but but I think the important\nthing to acknowledge there is that\npeople who start to fear that and start\nto believe that believe it for probably\na quote unquote good reason I don't\nthink that you know it's yeah\nthey weren't bomb thinking that yeah and\nthen then I think that there's the last\nkind of point is you asked me a question\nabout you know why is it that men have\nfewer options than women which you're\nacknowledging is anecdotal in your\nexperience and based on the Tinder\nprofiles that you've browsed through\nfrom your Social Circle which is yeah\nfair I think it's it's good data we just\nhave to understand what the caveats and\nshortcomings of the data are and that's\na question that I don't know I'ma look\ninto it for you though okay very nice\nI'll be expecting a video yeah so that's\nwhat we're I think there are a lot of\ngood questions here that I just gotta\nyou know compost all this stuff and then\nwe're gonna try to do some research and\nwe're gonna try to give you all some\nanswers\nyeah\nany any other thoughts or questions\nbefore we wrap up Tommy\num if well if you're going to do a bit\nof research into it um there's um this\nthis study that gets like thrown around\na lot that I've heard um is kind of how\nmen and women view attractiveness in\neach other and like the disparity\nbetween the two genders\num I don't know the exact numbers but\nessentially\nwomen see the average man as ugly they\nonly see like you know 20 of men as\nattractive whereas men see like 50 of\nwomen as attractive so I feel like that\nmight factor into it as well\nyeah so\nthat certainly factors into it but\nthere's all kinds of stuff with that so\nI mean I I can try to toss out a couple\nof points that's not going to be\nsynthesized\nokay but\num so number one\nwhat people say they find attractive in\na survey does not necessarily correlate\nwith how people end up in relationships\nso a lot of people will see surveys like\nthis and they'll say oh this is the\ntruth this explains stuff\nso it's very different between asking a\nrandom person what do you find\nattractive\nand seeing what kind of people actually\nget together\nyeah so a simple example the best\nexample of this is companies will do\nfocus groups\nand they'll ask a bunch of people in a\nroom they'll say here's a beautiful\nproduct it is a glass\nthis glass that's made of It's Made of\nGlass it's clear it can store all kinds\nof liquids it's amazing you can use it\nto wash yourself you can use it to drink\nthings you can use it to store things\nwhat do you think this glass is worth\nand people will say I think it's worth\nthis much I would think and then the\ncompany will say do you think the glass\nis worth ten dollars and people will say\nyeah absolutely such an amazing glass\nit's absolutely worth ten dollars that's\nvery different from hey here's a glass\nit costs ten dollars do you want to buy\nit\nyeah\nyeah and then focus group people like\nnah I don't want to buy it so this is\nsomething that we've got to be and I see\nthis a lot where people cite statistics\naround dating they don't they miss this\ncore point\nwas that asking people what they find\nattractive is not the same as\nwhat determines whether you get into a\nrelationship\nyeah\nsecond thing is that when women we say\nwomen find only 20 of people physically\nattractive there's also a different\nranking for what is important\nmm-hmm for a man and a woman to engage\nin a relationship\nso\nin my sense of this the last time I\nlooked at the research is that\num\nphysical attractiveness is less\nimportant of equality for the average\nwoman\nin terms of how what they're looking for\nin a relationship\nyeah so even though women may find men\nless physically attractive than men find\nwomen that doesn't necessarily translate\ninto only 20 because what happens is\npeople say oh only it's the pretty 20\nthat they're the only ones that get a\nchance of the relationship that's an\ninappropriate conclusion from a piece of\ndata yeah because all you need to do to\nreally understand who women pick is walk\naround like go to a grocery store and\njust see like go to a school and look at\nthe parents yeah I guarantee you that\nthe majority of people who are out there\nhaving kids are average looking\nyeah it's not like\nyou know everyone's like Genghis Khan\nwith like 10 000 kids out there like\nthey just\nyou know most most children are the\nproduct of generally speaking like a\nmonogamous relationship between average\nlooking people\nyeah\nyeah I completely agree\num I yeah there is this thing I I think\nit is an interesting disparity but I I\ncompletely agree with what you're sorry\nand I feel like\nI'm listening\nI was just gonna say there are a lot of\nfit it's very complicated isn't it the\nwhole\num you know the gender Dynamics in\nDayton there's a lot of things that go\ninto it like what we've been talking\nabout like attractiveness or like you\nknow class social status like there are\na lot of things that you could look at\nin terms of why things are the way that\nthey are\nyeah absolutely so just uh I'll be right\nso if people are curious like if you\nwant to understand relationship research\nthis book is great\nthis bad boy is\nonly 800 and\n72 some odd pages but like people who\ntalk like people who cite relationship\nstatistics\nI oftentimes find that they don't really\nunderstand like what they're talking\nabout so you got to take all that stuff\nwith a grain of salt I started reading\nthis book it's a mess it's like it's\ngood but it's long\nand so we'll we'll synthesize all the\nstuff that you're saying Tommy I'm going\nto look at that book probably tomorrow\nand try to find answers to your\nquestions and we will absolutely make a\nvideo about it\nyes I would love to see it you you\nprobably know a lot more about it than I\ndo so I'd be very interested to your\nthoughts I would say I know a different\nkind of thing than you do\nI wouldn't say I know more\nyou\nhave a better intellectual understanding\nthan I do I think sure I'll take that\nyou could read the Cambridge Handbook of\npersonal relationships and then you will\nhave a better intellectual understanding\nI'll get right on it\n150 by tomorrow yeah\nyeah all right take care Tommy thank you\nso much\nthank you cheers bye seriously it's a\ngood book\nthe Cambridge Handbook of personal\nrelationship it's a textbook so you got\nto watch out\nlike this is great\nphysiology and interpersonal\nrelationships\ncommunication basic properties and their\nrelevance to relationship research\nfamily relationships and depression\nviolence and abuse and personal\nrelationships romantic love\ncommitment\nintimacy and personal relationship it's\na great book a lot of good stuff in\nthere\nhello\nhello\nwhat do you go my friend uh you can call\nme Joe how's my sound uh\nit's it's good enough good enough too\nloud to oh no it's okay I can adjust it\non my end but thank you for asking sure\nso tell me what So today we're talking\nabout why men feel very rejected what do\nyou think is going on there bro\nso I can give you my perspective in my\nexperience and I I hopefully I don't we\ndon't retread the same ground as all the\nother guys but\num I'll give you my experience so I mean\ngrowing up like as I you know developed\nan interest in girls as like a teenager\nright I was told you know explicitly and\nimplicitly that you it's up to me\neverything is on me for finding a mate\nasking girls out you know getting them\nto be interested in you the whole nine\nyards right\num\nand so when a girl rejects you right\nshe can have you know one of a thousand\nlegitimate reasons for rejecting you\nthat has nothing to do with you right\nyou could be like I just I'm not looking\nfor something you know I'm you know I'm\nlesbian or whatever but\nit doesn't matter because the way we are\nconditioned or at least the way I was\nconditioned was it's my fault I have to\ncome up with an answer right so me\npersonally like I've been beating myself\nup this whole time trying to figure out\nwhy I've been having no luck\ndoes that make sense yeah it makes sense\nso can you tell me a little bit about\noh so help me understand it doesn't\nmatter what her reasons are it still\ncomes down to me help me understand that\nthinking a little bit\nyeah so it's like\nyou know\nall right I'm gonna pull Dr K can I\nthink for a second yeah absolutely man\num\nwell it's just it's at least something\nthat I believed right\num where if a girl rejects me right it\nit has a hundred percent to do with me\nright it's either you know I'm not good\nlooking enough I didn't do it correctly\nshe's uh I don't know if she didn't like\nsomething that I said\nshe thinks that she's out of my league\nit could be you know all sorts of\nreasons but they all have to do with me\nright\nso\nyeah so so that's kind of interesting\nokay because because on the one hand\nyou're kind of saying it\nit doesn't have there are a thousand\nlegitimate reasons that have nothing to\ndo with you right\nbut\nI do think I can understand this a\nlittle bit\nwhich is I think one of these things\nthat\nwe don't say out loud because it\nshouldn't be true\nright which is that\nif I was better\nI could have overcome that reason yes\nright so the experience of a lot of\npeople is oh like this person said\nthey're not looking in for a\nrelationship and a month later\nthey're in a relationship\nyeah\nand then the question is how did that\nhappen\nand then you look at the person that\nthey're in the relationship with and\nthat person is more physically\nattractive more wealthy more whatever\nthey're like oh\nhow interesting on some Dimension right\nof their life they're doing better than\nyou so you just gravitate to like oh\nwell he's you know he's just in better\nshape but maybe he doesn't make as much\nmoney as he doesn't matter because he\nonly gravitate to the dimensions that\nhe's doing better than you interesting\nso so you're kind of suggesting that\nit's like psychologically internal\nthat you're gonna make I think it is for\nme I mean because I've so I'm I'm\nturning 30 in like two months and I've\nnever had a girlfriend before and so I'm\nkind of getting to the point where\npeople are asking me like well Joe like\nyou know how come you've never been in a\nrelationship and I'm struggling to come\nup with answers and the one that I've\ncome down to I actually joined um HG\ncoaching just to kind of talk about this\nkind of stuff\num the answer I've come down to is like\noh I guess it's insecurity because I\ncan't find any other reasons\nso and is your coach helping you move\nforward\nI took so I'm not in coaching anymore I\nthink the angle that I took before the\ncoaching was trying to understand like\nalmost kind of try to come up with an\nanswer to this question I'm talking\nabout it's like why can't I why can't I\nuh\nuh find a girlfriend and the answer I\ncame up with is I don't know but it\ndoesn't seem to be anything in my past\nthat I okay you know I did or am doing I\nguess I'm just insecure I don't know\nand and so I'm a little bit curious like\nso what has your experience with trying\nto find a girlfriend been like\nso\nlet's see I mean in high school like I\ndidn't really have any luck I\nI think I was really shy and not very\nsocial\num so then I got to college\nand I got rejected a few times and I\nthink it just like built up my\ninsecurity so I I would like ask girls\nout less and less and less\num\nand then I you actually were just\ndiscussing this with uh previous caller\nwhere I actually moved out to the\nsuburbs right after college to get a job\nand so then everyone around me was like\nin a stable relationship that's right\nright\nso I literally I literally just moved\nback to the city just to solve this\nissue right\num\nso and can you tell me a little bit\nabout what your experience of being\nrejected in college was like\num so yeah there was a couple different\ninstances I could talk about\num so one of them was like a very close\nfriend of mine who I was like just head\nover heels in love with and it was it\nwas pretty cringe I'm not gonna lie\num and she basically said no like I I\nlike you as a friend I'm not\num I'm not interested in you that way\nand I I took that pretty hard\num that was towards the beginning and\nthen\nlet's see\nthere were others where I would get to\nmeet them in passing through chance\nencounters like being at the library\ntogether and you know meeting through\nfriend of a friend that kind of stuff\num\nand\nI think\nI would either like go out on like one\ncoffee date and then they would like\nstop texting me or they just wouldn't\nrespond to my texts at all\nokay and\nand so how many how many women would you\nsay you've asked out in your life\noh God\nfar too few\num probably around like 10.\nand what would you say what would you\nsay is\nan acceptable like what would what\nwhat's a number that you wouldn't be\nashamed of\noh God\nat least double that but I don't know\nI'm kind of making up numbers I guess in\nthat regard yeah\nright so it's interesting because when I\nask you a question what I get is a\njudgment\nyeah first right\nI'm embarrassed\nand 10 actually sounds like decent to me\nTBH I think this is where I I'm I'm a\nlittle bit confused so when I talk to\npeople like asking one person out a year\nis like\npretty par for the course\nyeah\nall right then I'm not doing so bad then\nI mean you\nwell I was before I moved out to the\nsuburbs but I I like seriously like I I\ndon't I mean I think like asking one\nperson out every three months is like on\nthe high end of what I've seen yeah no\nnot forget it I'm not but but I mean I\nthink because I it's it's not like it's\nnot like you're meeting like 60 people a\nday you know like even a month like you\ndon't meet that many people\nwell okay so here I mean so this is\ninteresting so this is also part of like\nthe conditioning is where like when I\ntalk to friends and other people about\nthis\nthey always come up with answers like\nwell you got to get on the dating apps\ndumb dumb and\nI'm like I am on the dating app so I\nkeep swiping right nothing happens so I\nguess I'm not photogenic it's like well\nyou gotta ask more girls out and it's\nlike well okay I guess but that's\nterrifying\nso what's terrifying about it\nwell I mean all the stuff that we've\nbeen talking about it's like it's you\nknow it sucks to get rejected and you\nknow it's not like\nyou know a for me like a woman that I'm\ninterested in\nis single\nis uh not like hopelessly out of my\nleague and has some semblance of a\npossibility that would be interested in\nme\nright that's like a lot of variables\nthat I'll have to line up so you know\nthey do all those variables have to line\nup before you ask someone out\nyeah kind of at least for me\nso number one is single makes sense\nnumber two is not hopelessly out of my\nleague yeah so what what percentage of\nwomen would you say are not hopelessly\nout of your league oh God\nI have no idea that's that's another\nproblem that I have it's like I actually\ndon't know and the third thing is are\nare would even remotely be interested in\nyou\nthat sounds just like would she give me\nthe time of day like does she even like\npay attention to me when I talk to her\ndo you think that that number is small\nor is that number big like what\nwhat percentage of women do you think\ndon't pay attention to you when they\nwhen you talk to them\nit's smaller than it used to be\ndefinitely\nbut like I guess when I was in college\nand especially high school that would it\nwas much larger here's the other problem\nis that I think my formative years on\nthis subject were in high school and\ncollege right which you know the\nenvironment the inter-social environment\nof those places is different than you\nknow being an adult in the working world\nright\nso it's like I'm I'm working off without\ndated assumptions but it's all I got\nam I making any sense here you're making\na ton of sense okay good because I'm not\nlooking at chat on purpose good you\nshouldn't\nI I'm just trying to think about so\nhere's what I'm hearing Joe on the so\nI'm hearing that like\nthe foundation was like I'm sort of\nhearing that\nthe boat has sailed like do you feel\nlike you kind of missed the yeah totally\nall right friends I mean I I'm out of\ncollege I've been out of college for a\nfew years all my friends they're either\nin stable relationships for multiple\nyears and or they're married\nlike I went to like 50 weddings last\nyear\nokay and not actually 50.\nI'm with you so so I'm hearing that\neveryone around you is is getting into a\nrelationship and getting married and\nstuff and you're like what I'm really\nhearing is that you've been left behind\nyeah\nat least I feel like I've been left\nbehind yeah\nand and can you tell me a little bit\nabout you said when you were growing up\nexplicit you were told explicitly that\nit's up to you\ncan you give me an example of that like\nwhat what were you I guess just in media\nand and the way you know other kids talk\nabout it it's just like you have to ask\ngirls out like that would be something\nmy dad would tell me\nlike he'd be like well you gotta go he\nhe's a boomer so like he did he didn't\nunderstand like how people talked in\nlike the mid 2000s and stuff he's like\nwell you got to go call him up and it's\njust like Dad I don't have a phone\nall right\nyou get the point right yeah oh\nabsolutely yeah no I I think it's we\ndon't do that anymore dad\nyeah I know right so his his Solutions\ndon't work for the Genera the world that\nwe live in today which yeah I think is a\nhuge problem here yeah and he would\nalways harass us well he used to and\nthen we told him to shut up but he would\nbug us for like not having a girlfriend\nor not getting a family start it's like\nDad you were like 38 when you married\nmom like stop shut up really oh yeah\nwhat's your understanding of why why\nyour dad got together at 38. oh God I\ndon't know\nhe\nI that's hard to describe on like\non life have you asked him\num he's not really like someone that uh\nlike I would talk to about these kinds\nof things he's he's from the generation\nof children should be seen and not heard\nyeah I'm with you but\nI don't know man don't you think it's\nkind of weird dude like dad got together\nat the age of 38 and here you are at 30\nlike\nyeah so what a hell of a coincidence\ndude why so okay I'm trying very hard\nnot to dox myself my brother yeah five\nyears older than me and I don't think\nthat he's ever been in a steady\nrelationship either\nand we're not like here's the other\nthing we're not like crazy in cells like\nwe don't hate women it's just we're bad\nat this yeah we're just really bad at\nthis no I I'm with you man\nand and so I'm I'm not getting the sense\nthat this is a I'm getting the sense\nthat this is like a\nuh\nnurse a skill no no the opposite it's\nlike a cop like so here here's what I'm\nenvisioning okay so like we learn things\nfrom our parents\nlike our parents teach us stuff right\nwell they're supposed to oh no they\nteach us stuff\neither way\nokay it's not always good stuff that's\nthe problem\nwe learn from our parents not not what\nthey're\nthey're supposed no I mean they teach us\nstuff no no matter it's a half the\nproblem is half time is bad they teach\nus the wrong stuff but they're\ndefinitely teaching stuff\nand what I'm hearing is\nand I've seen this pattern before where\nit's like parent\nbarely like scrapes by and manages to\nfind a relationship and then the kids\nare screwed yeah\nlike some weird like like here's here's\nhow I would put it I've seen so many\nparents that there's only one person in\nthe world that they could have a\nsuccessful relationship with and they\nmanage to find that person yes and then\nthey teach that formula which works for\nlike one out of a million to their kids\nand then the problem is that's a crappy\nformula because it just worked once yes\nand so I mean if you're telling me that\nyour brother is older and neither of you\nall have been in a relationship like\nI think I don't I mean sure there's\nalways going on there right yeah yeah\nthat's not that's kind of weird yeah it\nis and I think it's something about the\nway that you're probably like taught to\nrelate to people and one of the things\nthat worries me a lot is that like\nI think you've got to start asking out\npeople who are out of your league\nbecause I think the problem is that\nyou're misjudging your league\nyeah I don't know I have no no Compass\nor barometer of that respect\nyeah I'm I'm not I mean I think this is\nvery helpful Joe from from like my\nlearning standpoint I'm\nI'm both worried and optimistic for you\nat the same time because I I'm not\nhearing anything that I think is like\nirreparable in fact I know it sounds\nkind of weird but the crappier your\nupbringing is in some ways the better\nshot you've got because it's not really\nyour fault\nI should be very clear like I had a\nperfectly fine upbringing like they they\nraised me and my brother perfectly fine\njust in this one particular Dimension is\njust nothing yeah so that's my point\nright so I'm not saying and this is\nwhat's so confusing is that we all think\nthat like oh like if I had a traumatic\nupbringing which one person was kind of\nchiming in that a lot of this does have\nto do with trauma like so sometimes\npeople feel unlovable because of trauma\nand that's one of the reasons why they\nlower themselves in their eyes or they\nyou know push people towards rejecting\nthem there's all kinds of crap that goes\non there but the other thing that I I\njust know because I mean my household\nwas like this too were like\nI wasn't taught like certain basic\nthings about life which were like 101\nlevel skills that you need to be like\nsocially successful yeah\nand and it's not I mean my my upbringing\nwasn't traumatic\nit was just my parents didn't know how\nto teach me like some stuff yeah\nand and so and and I struggled for it\nand so like the one thing that I'm kind\nof optimistic for you about is on the\none hand I because I'm not hearing that\nthere's anything wrong with you\noh okay that's good do you think there's\nsomething wrong with you no\nno more than anybody else like\neveryone's got problems but not like\nokay can I can I ask you this is not\nmedical advice Chad this is not medical\nadvice he's not diagnosing me so so but\nlet me ask you why don't you think\nthere's something wrong with you\num because I think all around like if I\nlook if I were to take a step outside\nmyself\nand pretend I wasn't me I was someone\nelse I'd say Well he seems to be doing\nall right across most dimensions of his\nlife like he has friends as a job is\nreasonably healthy like I'm getting by\nso yeah and so so this is this is what\nis kind of hopeful and also absolutely\nterrifying Joe you sound like a\ncompletely normal decent guy\nokay that's good and that's what you're\nsaying about yourself right yeah yeah no\nand this is actually what terrifies me\nis that the majority of men that I've\ntalked to are not degenerate [ __ ]\nwho are abusive\nthe majority of men who are struggling\nto find relationships and feel really\nrejected or getting rejected are\nactually like completely normal men yeah\nand I I don't know what's going on but\nit's scary but I don't I don't think\nit used to be like this\nyeah I think I think you're right about\nthat I think\none thing I would add to that is you\nknow you can quote unquote slip through\nthe cracks in one way or the other like\nfor me like I never learned how to form\nromantic relationships right well\nqualify that as slipping through the\ncracks if that happens to you I think\nthe as far as I can tell\nat least up until just recently like\nuntil like HG was a healthy gamer was\naround like the people out there that\nwould help help you with these kinds of\nthings like influencers most of them are\ncomplete charlatans and you know there's\nplenty of names I could come up with I'm\nnot gonna turn the stream into\ndiscussion on those people but I think\neverybody knows what I'm talking about\nso one it's easy to slip through the\ncracks two there's no no one to help you\nother than snake oil says salesmen\nand three you if you end up in the\nsituation many people will probably\nthink that there's something wrong with\nthem which I thought for a long time\nuntil I learned how to make friends\nso so you what so uh here's my thoughts\nso first of all you learned how to make\nfriends when did you learn that\nCollege okay I kind of started to figure\nit out in high school but it was really\nCollege here's what I'm getting scared\nof Joe\nyou say slip through the cracks I'm\nbeginning to think that the cracks are\ngetting wider and wider and wider and\nslipping through them it's not slipping\nthrough them it's just falling is now\nbecoming the default position it's not a\nslipping through the cracks you're going\ndown the drain and and and I don't know\nquite why that is\nbut it it's it's like\nyeah I I I don't know and we're going to\ntry to help you I don't know exactly\nI can't tell if coaching was good for\nyou or not but I'm I'm going to think\nabout that a little bit and what we can\ndo to improve it\num\nbut you know usually we're able to help\npeople like you\nand I'm hearing that you got some\nbenefit from it but boy I wish your\ncoach could have helped you find a\nrelationship\nyeah well I think the problem was is\nthat I didn't understand why I don't\nhave a relationship\nand I wanted to know\nand I think what I kind of learned is\nthat there isn't really an answer to\nthat question\nso that's actually a very important\nDiscovery honestly\nbecause so a lot of people I know it's\nkind of hard but a lot of people think\nthat there's a Smoking Gun for the\nproblems in their lives yeah and so they\nkeep on looking for a Smoking Gun but if\nyou look at most things in life this is\nlike from a medical scientific\nperspective most things are something\nthat we call multifactorial so why don't\nyou have a relationship it's\nmultifactorial it's a combination of\ndigital stuff the way that you were\nraised being unlucky finding a job in\nThe Burbs there's all kinds of RNG that\nresults in this thing right and one of\nthe best things that I think you can do\nis stop looking for a Smoking Gun\nbecause you won't find one sometimes\nyeah\num\nbut one thing that I would kind of leave\nyou with is that that you said there are\nthree criteria that you look for before\nyou ask them what is that they're single\nthat one you should probably stick with\nuh\nbut depending on how good looking you\nare and how tall yeah I'm no home\nwrecker trust me\num people who are not hopelessly out of\nyour league let's assume that that's\nkind of fair and you don't want to do\nthat fine but what even remotely give\nyou the time of day that's the one that\nyou've got to be super careful about\nbecause there's an objective truth to\nthat and there's what your confidence\ntells you is safe\nwhich if you're looking for safety and\nto try to avoid rejection\nchances are you're not actually shooting\nfor the people who\num\nyou're gonna actually lower that\nstandard right right because you you're\ntrying to I mean is your strategy let me\nask you this Joe is your strategy to\nminimize rejection\nyeah I think so based on just like my\nthought process how I approach it like I\nkind of I feel like I have to stack the\ndeck in my favor as much as possible\nbefore I take any kind of action yeah so\nthat's a problem dude I don't blame you\nI don't think it's your fault for having\nthat strategy so once again just like\nwomen who stop trusting men\nthe strategy that you develop is based\non survival and I think if you're if the\nstrategy is to avoid rejection\nwhat's the perfect solution Joe what can\nyou do\nthere it is\ncan't get dumped if you don't start\ndating yeah\nyou have a perfect strategy to avoid\nrejection yeah\nexactly just don't do anything\nI'm just gonna sit on my Discord server\nand play video games\nwhat do you think you can do about that\noh God\nso hmm\nI don't know because I've done some of\nit before it feels like I've tried a lot\nof stuff before and it never worked out\nlike when I\num\nwhen I lived in the suburb in\nundisclosed suburbs I uh\nI tried you know joining like a gym\nwhere I could get like to know other\npeople outside work because\num\nwork wasn't really I wasn't really\nmeeting people at work and I didn't\nreally want to like date anybody at work\njust because make things way more\ncomplicated than it would have to be\num that I think that's actually all\nright I think that's another problem was\nlike I don't really know what I can do\nabout it\nI don't know\nokay\nso let's think through it so you said\nyou tried joining a gym yeah\nuh what what do you think you can\nso think about it like what do you think\nyou can do\nso it sounds like joining a gym didn't\nwork fair enough I don't think a gym is\nactually a great place to meet people\nusually people go to a gym not to\nsocialize no it was good for my mental\nhealth though good\ndo you still go to the gym\nuh not since I moved I've actually been\npretty bad about that I'm trying to find\nanother one in this area okay still\ngetting the the routine started up what\nelse do you so aside from Jim what do\nyou think you could do what do you think\nthis is the challenge here what's\nholding you back\nI guess it would just be meeting people\nI don't know where to go to meet people\nwhere\nthe environment is acceptable enough one\nthe environment is acceptable where I\ncould like ask people out and two where\nI could meet a reasonable number of\npeople\nwhere I would actually have a chance at\nfinding someone right\nyeah I I think there's some stuff here\nthat you're kind of\nshooting yourself in the foot because\nwhen you say there's a reasonable chance\nof finding someone that's the kind of\nthing that our mind tells us that the\npart of you that wants to avoid\nrejection will love\nbecause it can squeeze itself into that\nokay does that make sense I think I know\nwhat you mean\nwhat do I mean when I\nso it's it's like your mind is is sort\nof like trying to protect you from\ngetting rejected by like\num\nwhat's the word like raising the\ncriteria for taking action kind of like\nstacking the deck in your favor right\nyeah minimize the chance of rejection\nyeah I get that so Joe let me ask you a\nquestion what is an idea that you have\ncome up with that your mind has told you\nis not a good idea because it won't work\nor it won't be efficient enough\nprobably going out to bars more\ndo you like going to bars yeah every now\nand then not as much as I I used to like\nI'm\nI can't I can't throw the drinks back\nlike I used to be able to and how often\ndo you go to bars now\noh\nit's been lately\nI want to say like every couple of weeks\nlike a couple times a month on a good\nmonth\nnot that often\nwhen's the soonest you could go to a bar\nthe soonest um\nI mean I could go tonight if my friends\nwere up for it\nthat's the other thing I won't go alone\nsure I don't think you should go along\nso what can you do about that\nuh I can invite my friends out but I\nmean they're\nthere's like a you know at least a 50\nchance that they'd be like nah I don't\nfeel like it tonight\ndoing couple stuff I'm busy all sorts of\nother stuff\ngood yeah so what are you going to do\nuh not go by myself sure so what are you\ngonna do\nstay home okay so Joe I don't know if\nyou can tell there's a 50 chance that\nyou can go to the bar with your friends\ntonight\nand are you gonna ask them are you gonna\ninvite them\nwell it's like three degrees out so not\ntonight but on another night yeah I\nwould okay so if if weather's in the way\nthat's a whole different ball game\nbut I I can't I can't tell so I'm gonna\nkind of like leave things here but I'd\nencourage you to\nthis whole conversation smells really\nfishy to me\nbecause first I asked you like okay what\ndo you okay I'm not gonna go alone fair\nenough\nand then I'm like okay so what could you\nI could invite my friends and then\nyou're like well there's a 50 chance\nthey will say no\nand somehow the conclusion that you\nderive from that is so I'm not gonna ask\nand then I push you on that because\nwhat's the like 50 chance of I mean\nthat's a good chance like even if they\nhave lives if you ask twice on average\nthey'll say yes you can ask about this\nweekend you can ask about next weekend\nand the moment that I push you towards\nthat what does your mind do Joe\nand it comes up with excuses say no no\nno it won't work for this reason bad\nreason yeah\ndo our bars closed because the weather\nis cold where you are Joe\nno but I'm lazy\nah and then and then so now you're\nplaying your trump card Joe it's like\nnow you're on the ropes so you're\nplaying your trump card\nI'm lazy and this is like a once in a\nonce in a year like cold snap so I'm\nokay so to be serious to be serious like\nyeah I mean I that's something I would\ndo every now and then and it is\nsomething that I do very concretely I\ndon't have the time to motivationally\ninterview you to get you I'm sorry I\ndidn't need to take up too much time no\nno I'm you don't have to apologize I'm\njust saying I don't have the time to do\nwhat needs to be done here which is why\nyou're gonna have to do it yourself\nright which is\nlike\nreally think about what's getting in the\nway for you to check the weather and\ntext your friends today hey in two weeks\ndo you all want to go out and do\nwhatever\nand you can dodge like you can call\nyourself lazy and like you're gonna\noutplay me Joe like you're gonna you're\nthe you're the boss here you're gonna\nkeep watching yeah I mean I can't win\nyou've made that clear\nyeah well\nthanks for your time doc you're very\nwelcome my friend\nI'd also if one day you wanted to give\ncoaching another shot I would work on\nthis this our coaches are very good at\nokay so I I think in a weird way I\nwonder if you even signed up looking for\nthe wrong thing\nyeah maybe I might try uh individual\ncoaching as opposed to uh I did group\ngroups yeah so so and this is the kind\nof thing where like I would tell your\ncoach and maybe they'll sniff this out\nthat\nyou have trouble like taking social\naction and that your mind runs circles\naround you and they'll help you with\nthat they'll they'll point it out to you\ntoo\nbut I mean I I think it's like Joe\nthere's I mean\nthere's just so much here like I I think\nI think you've got a serious shot at a\nrelationship honestly I do I I don't you\nknow there really I can turn this\nfranchise around is that what you're\nsaying no I mean I I don't think you\neven need to turn the franchise around I\nthink that thinking is wrong it's just\nyou have to take the blinders off you're\nalready pointed in the right direction\nyou've got a life it seems like you're a\ndecent human being it sounds like you're\nempathic sounds like you're financially\nindependent sounds like you're\nthoughtful about yourself like I don't I\ndon't even I\nmm-hmm\nturning it around I think is a\num\nturning it around I think is once again\nunderselling how far you've come right\nbecause there's a lot of things that I\nthink I mean I think a lot of women\nwould be interested in you if you'd give\nthem a chance\nI'm not going to get into that but okay\nthank you thank you so much\nfair enough\nI apologize for making that statement no\nit's okay it's not anyway a lot of good\nlots of stuff to unwrap and honestly Pro\nlike thank you so much for being a part\nof this community like we built this\nplace for people like you oh that that\nmeans a lot to me and people like you is\nis people like me like I don't see\nmyself as really much much different\nfrom you at all\nso well take care thanks for not thanks\nfor not rejecting me you're most welcome\nbetter luck next time\n[Laughter]\nadios all right\nall right hello my friend how many\npeople do we have left ionized uh just\none okay\nafter me okay\ngo for it\nmy friend\nI'm sorry what do you go by uh Mitchell\nMitchell talk to me Mitchell what's up\nwhy why do you think that men feel so\nrejected nowadays\num I think\nit's been touched on a little bit but uh\nI think that men are usually in the\ninitiator role more often and\nand then uh\nso like I've been in that position a few\ntimes\nand the one\ninstance that I'm I'm kind of thinking\nabout is\num\nso I I wrote some some notes down is it\nokay yeah please redo that\nso uh\nI said when when a man goes to ask a\nwoman on a date you're\nputting yourself in a extremely\nvulnerable position\num and it's kind of like\nit's kind of like uh you're taking off\nlike all your End Game Gear almost\nyou're you're going to see if the ladies\ninternet interested enough in you too\nor Internet interested enough in your\nlike base stats\nto see if she wants to go and like fight\ndungeons with you or something\nokay and then so it's like\nyou're sticking your neck out and then\nwhen she says no\nthen it's kind of like\nit's kind of like this this dagger where\nyou like you just took off all your\narmor and that no like does a lot more\ndamage than uh\nthen maybe she realizes\nwhat\nhelp me understand why the dagger hurts\nso much\nuh I think it's\nit's kind of like\num\nyou're you're seeing if this person\nthinks that you're you're worthy in a\nway\ndoes that make sense like yeah so if\nyou're worthy enough to be a potentially\nlife partner\nokay so so\nif I'm hearing you correctly Mitchell it\nwhen you ask someone out it's a test of\nyour worthiness\nyeah I think so\nat least for that person\nbut I think that um hold on a second for\nthat person or\nwell yeah that's what I was going to say\nis like\nin in that situation\nthat person thinks that you're not\nworthy\nbut that does damage to your own\nself-worth\nright so it you take that into your next\ninteraction\nso so I'm and when you say kind of\ntaking off your End Game Gear I just\nwant to make sure I understand that\nanalogy what I'm sort of hearing is that\nyou're really like making yourself\nvulnerable You're like dropping your\narmor rating to zero right right yeah so\nlike any any like maybe you got rejected\nin the past and you you have some like\nwalls that you've built up to try to\nprotect yourself\nand maybe that manifests as like\navoidance where you just like oh I got\nrejected I'm not worth enough\nwhy should I even try so if if\neventually you\nget enough courage to go and ask\nsomebody then you're like taking off or\ntaking down those walls taking off the\narmor and then\nyeah exactly I'm gonna do this I'm gonna\ngive it another try and then they say no\nand it's like oh I knew it\nlike it's still the same and it it hurts\nwhat is it that's the same\nuh that\nthat same pain that you felt the first\ntime that that made you build that\ninitial wall\nand then and then you take it down to\ntry to\nto try to see if somebody else\nlikes you enough and then if they don't\nthen it's like okay ouch again and then\nmaybe likes you enough to do what\nuh to go on a date or be in a\nrelationship\nand so what I'm hearing you kind of say\nMitchell I know you say\nyou're not kind of good enough for them\nbut what I what I'm honestly reading\nbetween the lines is that\nit's a value judgment on you\nit's not just about their preferences\nlike it's like if you were better they\nwould say yes\nright right is that how it feels\nuh that's how it feels yeah\nwhat where do you think that feeling\ncomes from\nuh\nI don't I don't understand what you're\nasking\nwhy do you think it is that when someone\nrejects you\nthat has more to do with you than it\ndoes with them\nuh I think\nI think it does have\nlike from their perspective\nI think they\nit has most to do with them like like\nyou say like preferences and\nand um\nand that sort of thing but\nto to me\nor to the man it it feels like it's\nabout them\neven though it might not be\nyeah so I I'm with you and I think this\nmakes a lot of sense like that\nwhat their reasons are is not what we\nexperience as men\nright right so the experience\nas men that I think that's kind of the\nthe disconnect is like\nwhat that that\num\nperson that you were talking about your\nprevious stream I think\nshe views it as not having a big impact\nbecause\nfrom her perspective it's not about him\nor it's like maybe about different\nreasons\nbut to him it's it's all about him like\nif he was if he was more fit to her to\nher preferences than she would have said\nyes or gone on a date with him\nyeah I I think this is very helpful I'm\ngonna ask a question questions in a\ncouple of different ways\num I'm kind of Flying Blind here so\nplease let me know if the questions are\nnot don't seem to sit well with you or\nyou don't know how to answer them or\nwhatever or if you don't want to just\nlike please let me know can I count on\nyou for that yeah sure\nso are you seeing anyone right now\nI am yeah damn it\nGod damn it Mitchell yeah I know I was I\nwas gonna kind of preference or uh\npreface this with with that but uh yeah\nI've been I've been dating somebody for\nalmost a year\num\nwell before that before that I was\nsingle for six years\nokay so so let me ask you when you were\nsingle for six years\nokay\nI I want to understand\nwhat did it say about you that you were\nsingle for five years\nuh\nlike what did that mean about you as a\nperson\nreally know I think that\nin a in a way I was like\npeople\nwell I\nin my specific case\num I just wasn't in that many\nsituations where I would meet a lady so\nokay so that was that was a big\ninfluence but I was in university for a\nportion of the six years so I was seeing\npeople like I was meeting people\nbut um\nyeah I guess I just wasn't at the time\nlike ready for that\nokay\nso so because here's here's what I was\ncurious about is that that when you said\nkind of like manner put in the initiator\nrole\nand I think our our previous caller also\nkind of touched on this that the\nresponsibility is placed on us as men\nusually to you know it's up to me that's\nwhat we're taught\nyeah is that the initiation you mean\nI I think the initiation is what you\nsort of focused on but I think that\nwe're sort of taught that\nthe better we are\nthe more likely we are to find a\nrelationship which just sort of makes\nsense right like obviously but but I I I\nthink that there's there's something\nabout I wonder if I wonder if it is like\nconditioning around value\nthat\nI'm worth less as a human as a man not\nas a human being but as a man if I'm\nunable to find a partner\nlike it says I think some people think\nthat yeah what does it say about have\nyou ever thought that about yourself\nuh I don't think so not not to a a\nnotable extent at least so that's so\ninteresting because I wonder if that\nexplains why you're dating someone now\nmaybe so so can you tell me a little bit\nabout since\nyou're in a relationship and you seem\nhappy damn it yeah can you tell me a\nlittle bit about how that relationship\nstarted if you feel comfortable\ndisclosing I you know\nuh it was\nhow'd that happen dude because six years\nyeah quite the dry spell you're you're\ndamn right\num\nyeah it was I was just kind of like so\nfor the six years a lot of the time I\nwas just like like I would have thoughts\nlike am I ever like am I gonna be alone\nfor the rest of my life like stuff like\nthat you know\nand I think that's like pretty normal if\nyou're if it's been a long time\nlike oh man what if I never find\nsomebody\nbut I was just kind of like\nI don't know like\nlet's just hope it happens\nso I I was\nkind of like giving myself hopium in in\nthat sense\nbut uh but the way that I started dating\nmy girlfriend right now was uh through a\nfriend actually they they met online\nlike on a on a dating app but they were\njust kind of friends\nand then\num and then we all hung out one time and\nthen I dm'd her the next day\nMitchell\nyes sir I'd rather I've I've certainly\nread a Reddit post about you\nreally yes do I know about this Reddit\npost\nyou may have read it about you as well\nyou may not have realized it's you but I\nmet this girl on the dating app\nwe went out a couple of times we hung\nout with with this friend of mine and\nnow they've been together and I got\nfriend zoned\nhave you seen have you seen that that\nReddit post uh I haven't but that's\nthat's uh that's basic that's a similar\nsituation\nthat happens all the time\none second I unplugged my headphones\nokay we're good\nall right yeah so that's so interesting\nso you just like diameter and and then\nwhat\nand uh\nit was I don't know I guess she just\nliked me enough\nwhen we were hanging out that she like\nwas like oh he dm'd me and then DM me\nback\nbut it was it's kind of like what\n[Music]\num\nI think\nI think she put something on her\nInstagram story and I just replied to\nthe Instagram story and you all just\nstarted talking and you just asked her\nout or what\nuh yeah we were talking for we were just\ntexting for like a month and then\num and then we decided like\nlet's actually do something together and\nit was interesting because the the first\nsort of like date like\nyeah go ahead\nthe first date was kind of like\nlike I thought it was a date because I'm\nlike super interested in this girl and\nthen we like plan something and we go\nout and we're just there\ntogether so to me that was a date but\nwe've talked about it and in her mind it\nwasn't to date\nso I'm like that's interesting so when\ndid when when did she start to realize\ny'all were dating\num\nthat's a good question I don't know if\nwe've talked about that that's\ninteresting I mean for what it's worth I\nwas in the same situation except I\ndidn't realize I was going on a date\nwell right but\num that that's interesting so I I think\nthere's something to be learned here I'm\nnot quite sure what it is\num but it sounds like you I mean you\nthought you were asking her out but you\nalso said that y'all planned something\nwhere it was just the two of us so it\nalso sounds like she was pretty active\nyeah\nokay yeah so it's like\nI think a a big portion of it was just\nlike she was\nfrom the initial hangout she was\ninterested enough in me that when I\ninitiated\nthen\nshe was\nshe was down to\nso just to be clear\nyou were in the friend zone\nno I was never in the I don't think I\nwas ever in the friend zone\nbut you just said that that y'all were\nhanging out and she didn't think it was\na date\nI don't think yeah I don't think she\nconsidered it a date I think her\ndefinition of a date is specific\nbut I was always like a love interest\nokay so so she was attracted to you from\nday one yeah okay\nMitchell I was always a love interest\nchat mode dude let's go\neasy boys yeah\nyeah\noh man no but like it's\nokay go ahead now keep going this is\ngreat but but like\nbut what I'm saying is like so back to\nthe point is\nfor six years\nI I went on like despite trying on on\ndating apps and stuff I like I know\nother guys who talked about this the\nstream but\non dating apps like\nover six years I've got or I went on one\nactual date and it was terrible\nand I got like\na handful of matches and\nso it's so what what I'm hearing is the\nformula to success to find love is to\nfind some friend of yours who is\nhopelessly in the friend zone\nand then sweep in and since you're more\nattractive and clearly a love interest\nfrom the first moment\nthat that's how you should be finding\nyour women\nfine dudes who are hopelessly friend\nzoned and then I I'm just messing with\nyou Mitchell I don't know yeah you know\nor anything but I do think it's it's\nkind of funny because I've never I've\nnever talked to the dude I've read these\nstories and heard the frustration of men\nover and over and over again I've never\ntalked to the guy who sweeps in right\nand I I would I would say to be fair to\nmyself and to my friend\nthat he and I talked at length about the\nentire situation before I was like\nbefore I went and like pursued my\ncurrent girlfriend that that's it was it\nwasn't like I just like yeah went in and\nand started dating this girl that he\nstarted seeing but uh I like I went to\nmy friend and we talked about it's like\nokay you know I'm interested in this\ngirl like is that cool with you\nlike and then we we kind of talked it\nout so\nsounds like solid bro code\nabsolutely sounds good dude\nit's it's what it felt like\nso but but that is interesting I think\nI'm I'm really curious about so what I'm\nkind of hearing from you is like sort of\nRNG\nuh that's yeah that's how it feels a\nlittle bit okay\nand and part of that is like\nwe were talking about the preferences\nyou know you never know what their\npreferences are\nand\nlike that's that's kind of RNG in a way\nbut\nand and\nwe've already talked about this where\nthey they reject you because of their\npreferences but you think it's because\nof you\nyeah I\nand and how does it feel to be in a\nrelationship for a year\nuh\npretty good it's like scary\nuh like when you when you take bigger\nsteps in the relationship\nuh there's like\nit's it's you don't stop being\nvulnerable you know it's like\nif if you\nI don't know\nif you do something big together then\nit's like like for example moving in\ntogether is like you've got to trust\nthis person enough\nto live in the same space with you\nyeah\nEtc\nand just to clarify when you first asked\nyour now girlfriend out the the end game\narmor was off\nuh\nuh I don't really know it's that that\nendgame armor analogy was for a\ndifferent situation\nokay but\nyeah okay okay I I just kind of with my\ncurrent situation I just kind of took a\nlike casual approach I know somebody\nearlier in the Stream talked about\num like dudes being fake\nand\nI I try my absolute hardest to to just\nbe genuine\nbecause\nlike if you're if you're trying to be a\nchameleon to everybody's preferences\nthen then everyone will love you\nyeah right and you'll and you'll be\nupset the whole time isn't that how you\nget everyone to love you Mitchell\nuh\nnot in my experience yeah have you tried\nto be a chameleon yeah\nuh yeah\nwise words man so I I apologize I had a\nlittle bit of Whiplash from your whole\nsituation because\nyou know I I think it's very easy to\nforget that\nlike\nnot everyone is struggling out there\nit's very easy I think a big part of\nyour what you shared with us with which\nI think is really important is you can\nbasically have one date in six years\nthat was a disaster and still be okay it\ndoesn't mean you're broken doesn't mean\nyou're screwed\nwhat I'm really hearing is that the\nformula for success is what we've kind\nof heard before but is really still\nconfusing which is kind of like\naccepting yourself authenticity\nand I'm sure that a lot of people who\nare listening to our first caller who is\na woman who was like yeah I learned how\nto accept myself and there are a lot of\ndudes out there saying yeah that works\nfor women it doesn't work for us\nyeah and and what I'm really hearing\nfrom you is that you know a certain\namount of it is like luck\num but you don't have to be an [ __ ]\nyou don't have to take advantage of\npeople you don't have to be manipulative\nI was kind of memeing with you a little\nbit but and it sounds like you guys had\na really solid conversation so thank you\nfor sharing that but I've met a lot of\nfrustrated men who have been very very\nemotionally invested in a particular\nrelationship that they did not make\nclear and then\nsome friend of theirs starts dating\nbecause they're a little bit more\nforward\nright and it feels really bad when I'm\nstacking the deck so much in my favor\nand then like some dude comes in and\nstarts dating this person and then I\nfeel resentful because I've invested so\nmuch so I feel like I need to get some\nkind of like return on that investment\nwhich can be challenging but it's it's\nbeen really interesting I think it's\nbeen very helpful to hear in this in\nessence like a success story\nyeah yeah in a way definitely uh is a\nbig contrast to\nto my life before\nmeeting her so yeah and I think that's\nwhat's really cool is we're not talking\nabout contrasting two different people\nwhich is oftentimes what happens is we\nstart to think like oh they're the\npeople who are good at relationships and\nthen there's us who are bad at\nrelationships but that actually\nyou can be both\nand that change is possible\nyeah I think I think that uh\nlike I was talking about earlier like\nthat that\num like being genuine and being honest\nwas kind of like that was my kind of\npolicy\nlike as long as I feel good about myself\nafter\nlike I did all I could I was honest with\nmyself\nlike then\nif it doesn't work I'm not too chapped\nabout it because\nlike I don't know it I I was me and she\ndidn't like it\nwhich is I'm still me\ncool yeah anything else you want to add\nMitchell\num\nI watching the stream uh before I\nnoticed you you're holding a pen\nwhat pen is that it's a pilot g207\nokay I'm very particular about my pens I\nyeah I was gonna ask if it was uh the\nsame one that I got I got the\nthe sarasa\nthe zebra sarasa 0.07 or 0.7\nis it a good pen it's great gel link\nuh you know what I I'm not sure uh\nI don't think so\nI don't think it's gel\nis it refillable\nor is it's like a disposable you know\nwhat uh that's out of my uh yeah I don't\nreally I'm not like a pen person or\nsomething but I was thinking you were\nasking so I was like oh maybe I should\nswitch if you were like a yeah I mean\nyou should try it\nokay see like it's really it's really\nbold dark ink so\ngood well I do like things that are bold\nand dark yeah it's great\n[Laughter]\nall right man take care all right see ya\nhello\nhello\nhow are you my friend oh nothing twice\nabout apologies I wasn't quite ready as\nI just saw you wrapping up the stream\nbut I guess there's a bit of a delay how\nare you Doctor guy I'm doing well thank\nyou for being patient uh no thanks for\nhaving me it's uh I've recently stumbled\nupon your content and I literally as I\ngo out the shower this this evening here\nin the UK\num I just choose just saw you stream and\nI thought I'd just jump on and uh\nluckily I got picked so uh thanks for\nhaving me awesome what's your name bro\nuh you can call me Damien Damien yep\ntell me a little bit more about this\nshower\nyeah well a stand-up shower after I've\ncome back from work I'm not gonna do\nanything labor-wise but uh I was going\noutside working out came back took a\nnice hot shower as I got my water heater\nfixed soon and obviously stun with a\nfull new stream and uh I was like hold\non a minute I feel like I can kind of\nchip in some value in terms of my\nexperience being only 26 years old\nobviously but I'm obviously in this\ngeneration right in the western\ngeneration and I see a lot of dating\naround me I don't participate in it\nmyself but I just feel like I can you\nknow give my point give my opinion and\nobviously you're a professional so you\ncan kind of tell me how that sounds and\nuh give your take on it as well sure I'd\nlove to hear your your thoughts Damien\nthank you for calling in\nperfect thank you well I really feel\nfeel like it's really simple to fix this\nproblem uh in the morning day and age\nyou know people say right why can't More\nThan Dirt more than men get girlfriends\nright well it's because more than women\nend the game modern dating has changed\nsignificantly from let's say the 80s or\n90s meaning in my opinion from my\nexperience\nI feel like what you need really is to\nget either status\nmoney or looks and you can get yourself\na relationship if you're endorsed if\nyou're not improving it yourself if you\ndon't have a good body fat percentage if\nyou don't look good in the mirror I'm\nsorry that's gonna that's gonna stumble\nyour dating chances and it's Common\nSense really in my opinion and I feel\nlike a lot of men can fix their problems\nif they hit the gym or if they hit the\nbooks to get that promotion or get that\ncareer get their pursue their purpose\nand women tend I think women tend to\ngravitate towards driven and successful\nmen and I feel like if men just found\ntheir purpose got up and obviously for\nyour support for a coaching understood\nthemselves and began to sort of you know\npursue what they want to do in life I\nfeel I feel like a relationship will be\nthe next natural thing and that's what\nI'm currently doing myself\num you know improving myself and I hope\none day I'm not looking for it but if it\nhappens it happens\nso I I hear what you're saying so I and\nI don't think it's that ridiculous\nyou're kind of saying that\nis this kind of like so basically you're\nsaying if you're worth something as a\ndude it's easy to find a relationship\nright\nyeah absolutely yeah\nI think that makes a lot of sense what\ndo you think it what do you think it is\nthat makes it hard for people to do that\nwell obviously different economic\nbackgrounds uh where you've been brought\nup where you you know where you begin\nreally life is a major factor genetics\nis obviously another a big thing\nobviously I would have to say but I\nbelieve there is always just deviating a\nlittle bit I believe there's always a\nperson for a person but the problem is\nwith social media in my opinion and\nwhat's happening now seeing this through\nobviously the lenses of My Generation\nUm is that you know women do have a lot\nof options and that's fair enough you\nknow uh but this is the problem I I feel\nlike it's like it's like going to\nBlockbuster that I was born in 96 but I\nstill remember going to Blockbuster in\nthe early 2000s you know we have so much\nso many films you're like oh yeah maybe\nI want to try this one this is quite\nfunny but uh this one this one looks\npretty good as well I feel like the\nproblem is women have been given too\nmany options and it's no human nature I\nfeel like you want to get the best deal\nyou don't want to be you don't want to\nfeel cheated or you don't want to feel\nlike you've missed out so I feel like in\norder to compete in the data market\ntoday men have to number one know their\nvalue and number two be prepared to\nobviously be on their purpose and to\nmake and I know it sounds cheesy but to\nmake themselves the best version of\nthemselves currently possible do you\nthink that um\nwomen have more options than men\nin terms of dating or just in general\njust like because you kind of said right\nlike so so you're always going to want\nthe best option\nyeah human nature will say you want to\nget the best option yeah yeah so do you\nthink that\nthere's a imbalance of how many options\neach gender has\nwell in the moment of the day age\ncertainly in the Western in the western\nSociety women have now been put on a\npedestal in my opinion and that's fine\nyou know because you could argue back in\nthe 1950s 60s you know there was a lot\nof you know the gender pager for example\nwhich some people have debunked I don't\nknow my I don't know if that's 100 true\nor not but I just feel like at the\nmoment women are reigning we're quite in\na very metriarchical uh sorry I'm the\nonly thing I'm pronouncing a very\nmatriarchal society and I feel like\nnormal normal Joe's normal men just\ncan't compete with normal women anymore\neven normal women want six or sevens or\neights and above you know\num that's that's what I'm sort of\nsensing and feeling at the moment sure\nsure so so that's totally cool like\nthat's why we're we're having you call\non today and I think just because you're\nsinging a slightly different tune from\nother callers like I love that you\ncalled in uh Damien I'm so glad you\nshared your opinion so let me ask you a\ncouple questions\num one is so you're saying that\neven average women want to pursue six\nsevens or eights so do you think that\nthere are or is the number of single men\nand single women the same\nno definitely you know there's more\nsingle men than single women in my\nopinion and do you think that so what's\nthe distribution of the curve so is it\nlike a normal distribution where\nyou know\nno I wasn't sorry sorry I wasn't saying\nno I would say there's a lot more single\nmen than there are single women and the\ncurve is way up meaning that loads of\nmen as you can see while through\nobviously your various colors before and\nprevious as well I feel like they're\nlooking for a relationship and they\ncan't find it and they're being given\nadvice just to go out there go to the\nclub but I I really feel like that's not\ngonna do them I need the service they\nlook in the mirror then prove themselves\nwait so so this this is what I that\nthat's fine I'm I know\nI want to understand what you're saying\nmore than anything else because I think\nit's really interesting so\nif there are more single men than women\nroughly speaking the populations like 50\n50 right\nmaybe like 52-48 but generally speaking\nthat age Gap changes the older you get\nbecause women have a life expectancy\nthat's larger than longer than meds sure\nso what I'm curious about is how do you\nhave a non-50\nthat's it\noh that was okay can you hear me yeah\nyeah how do you how do you get that\noh do you get that well listen I I don't\nknow but what I what I feel like if we\nstart recognizing our value as men like\nwe used to before recognize our value\nand find our purpose go for our goals\nand make ourselves a better version of\nourselves I feel like we can equal the\nLevel Playing Field so just as women\naccept women have accepted weak men\nwomen have encouraged Chads Bad Boys you\nknow to go and pursue them they've\nencouraged sleeping around them we've we\nas men have allowed this and women have\nallowed as well this kind of behavior\nright and I don't mean to sound\ncontrolling when I say we in men's have\nallowed this but we're both genders we\nboth have equal say but at the end of\nthe day each gender allows certain type\nof behaviors to carry on in a society\nand I feel like in order to get man back\nup to normal Level Playing Field of\nwomen they have to pursue their purpose\nand they have to find I don't know what\nthey need to do in life\nwait so so when did we said we need to\nget back\nas men what what did when did we what\ndid what did we lose and when did we\nlose it well Dr K I am uh I'm not from\nthe Western Society I was brought up in\nthe western society and uh if you look\nat other cultures they're very and I'm\nnot saying we should go back to this but\neach gender had its own traditional role\nand you can see in previous previous\nhistorical periods these gender roles\nworked they worked for that time and\nperiod now we are evolving in society\nI'm not trying to say the West is bad\naway for nothing the West the best thing\nhas happened to the 21 obviously the\nHuman Society but I feel like if men and\nwomen do not have their purpose in a\nrelationship the relationship is doomed\nto fail I.E you know uh man uh provides\na woman keeps and maintains but with\ndemonized traditional women these days\nwe've demonized them so much the normal\nmen you know are afraid to walk up to a\ngirl and just say hey my name is you\nknow uh Damien and I think you beautiful\nthat's to some woman no no to some women\nthat scene is creepy right and in order\nto get back to normal Level Playing\nField I don't know what the solution is\nbut what we're doing now is certainly\nnot working sorry we're on the big round\nthere apologies no I I love it I I think\nit's very uh I'm learning a ton Damien\nso let me ask you this so you said that\nwe we've demon so there's a breakdown of\ntraditional gender roles and and you're\nalso saying that gender roles used to\nwork right can you help me understand\nhow you define work\nfamilies bringing on the next generation\nof men and women moral values Family\nValues which are being eroded especially\nin our Western society today\nokay so what what's an example of a\nfamily value that is being eroded or a\nmoral value that's being eroded\num well took my head I would say\num and again I'm not religious or\nanything right but I should say sex\nbefore marriages having loads of\nPartners as a woman or a man before\nactually committing to one individual\ncan actually cause quite significant\npsychological problems and that's been\ndocumented you can research it yourself\nand I think that's one thing that sort\nof is demoralizing us as human beings\num\nand sorry what can you repeat the\nquestion again yeah I was just saying so\nyou said that traditional gender roles\nworked right and then and then I asked\nin what way did they work and then yeah\nsorry yeah that's it something about\nmoral values and I asked you which moral\nvalues and then you talked about sex\nbefore marriage and how it's damaging\npsychologically and then you said I can\nresearch it I'm curious what do you\nthink is the psychological damage of sex\nbefore marriage\nwell there's a special chemical in the\ntop of my head I'm sorry I wasn't\nprepared for this I don't know it's\nsaying I'm happy to help you out\nyep so basically the chemical where when\nthe woman the man sleep together it gets\nreleased and for example the more men or\nthe more women sleep with a man uh with\ndifferent men that chemical doesn't get\nreleased so much it's a chemical that\nrelease that bonds you through your\npartner\nthat that's the one doctor okay yeah so\nthat's that's the one so if you if you\nrelease the Sox I lost the name already\nif you release this chemical\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain\nyou're not gonna be as Community partner\nare you to you know no I mean what I'm\nconfused so when you say when you\nrelease it over and over and over again\nso if I if I have sex with the same\nperson I'm releasing the chemical over\nand over and over again right\nsex with a safe partner wow I don't know\nif it releases I've I think it releases\nonce when you Bond obviously and then\nI'm not really sure on the signs of how\nthat works but all I know is that from\nexperience and other people's stories\nand you know how what they go through is\nthat the more Partners a man or a woman\nthat have obviously had more of a\ndifficult a long-term relationship\nbecomes sustainable that makes sense\nso yes and no so here's my understanding\nso there there is evidence that having\nsex with a lot of different partners can\nbe damaging but that's usually\nuh people who are sex workers\nokay so and and I'm not you're allowed\nto have your opinion it's just I get\nsuper curious when people start saying\nlike it's been documented and you can do\nyour research because I you know I\nthere's there's a lot of science that\nI've learned that supports what you're\nsaying so for example the more that you\nhave sex with someone the more commonly\nyou release oxytocin and the more you\nrelease oxytocin the stronger the bond\nbecomes right so this is why like every\ntime a child breastfeeds\nthere's a release of oxytocin for the\nmother and I'm imagining the child\nalthough I'm not up to date on that kind\nof research so the more oxytocin that\ngets released the more Maternal Child\nbonding there is so you're absolutely\nright that there's a chemical that gets\nreleased when this is slightly wrong but\nwhen people have sex\nthat forms a bond now I could see how\nthat could damage a relationship that\ncould damage things because if you're\nhaving sex with a lot of different\npeople you're forming\npotentially weak bonds with a lot of\ndifferent people yep so that that makes\nsense to me oh and I think just because\nyou don't you're not entirely up to date\non the science doesn't take away your\npoint you you know the point is still\nthere's still a biological plausibility\nfor that\nbut I think this is also where like I'm\njust super curious when so but I'm not\nhearing that your beliefs are actually\nbased in the biology\nno they're not they're not they're based\nin what exactly\nwell I was just trying to and I again I\nwent on a bit of around I want to\napologize I love it no no no dude rant\naway my my dude this is great I was what\nyou just said there is what I wanted to\nsay basically but in a few words\num but sorry what was your question\nagain I was just curious what what do\nyou base this on so you you kind of say\nokay so like there's a decay of like\nfamily values and then like what are the\nvalues and what and so then you said sex\nbefore damage is damage uh sex before\nmarriage is damaging and then I said how\nso\nand then you were like they're\nscientific so why do you think sex\nbefore marriage is damaging because it's\nthere may be some biological support of\nthat but that's not it doesn't sound\nlike that's why you came to believe that\nit's not like you read research paper\nand you're like oh look\nno no\ntotal evidence I would say anecdotal\nevidence from experiences that I've had\nfrom experiences of men have had and\nobviously a lot of reading through I've\nread the stories and um you know people\nsharing their opinions for your videos\nand uh not a lot of times I'll be honest\nwith you yeah what kind of exp what kind\nof anecdotal evidence are you talking\nabout like how can you give me like an\nexample I'll just uh let's say males are\nfemales writing about their\nrelationships what went wrong and a lot\nof red flags quote unquote being popped\nout and there's a lot of similarities\ninto each story of okay this is a\npotential rough flag this is what helped\nthe relationship crumble or the\nrelationship you know not be you know\nas active as it could have been\num similarities in in certain certain\nyou know worries and experiences that\npeople have had\nI see so so just you're you're kind of\nlike you're reading stories about people\nand you're kind of concluding that since\npeople are having sex before marriage it\nmakes it harder to form strong bonds and\nrelationships\nwell no I don't necessarily think that\n100 I just feel like that's a factor to\nplay in right sure sure sure I'm not I'm\nnot I've had sex before marriage I'm not\nyou know a purist or like I'm not like\nChristian Bible bashing Christian or\nanything or a Muslim uh but you know I\nfeel like if we just took our time if if\nwe just sort of took away social media\nwe will be better people or better\nSociety not better if you're better\nthere's a lot of evidence and and the\nthe way that social media kind of gets\ninto this is that it gives people an\nidea that they can do better\nmm-hmm\nand\nand so but if I'm if I'm understanding\nthis correctly but there there is an\nimbalance in women who are in\nrelationships and men who are in\nrelationships right there are more women\nin relationships than there are men in\nrelationships\nbecause I I think partly because men\njust don't understand their value they\nfeel like if they just read that next\npickup book or if they get their\nconfidence up they can get a woman but I\nfeel like women are just as shallow as\nmen were equal in that playing field and\nit's time that men rose up to you know\ntook their appearance as a priority took\ntheir career and purposes of priority\nand a relationship would just be a\nnatural you know an actual consequence\nof their actions\nokay so let me ask you Damien how did\nyou feel about your how long have you\nbelieved this\num coming up to 126 now I think since my\nlast relationship when I was 23 so like\nfour years or so can you tell me a\nlittle bit about your last relationship\nand what happened\nyeah absolutely train back uh to any\nyoung man listening to this it's never a\nnever long distance be careful when\nyou're long distance because uh I was in\na relationship a long distance for six\nmonths it was a very short relationship\nuh it was my last relationship three\nyears ago\num and I found out that the girl I was\nseeing now and again every week or so\num when I was visiting her she was\nvisiting me she was actually in a\nlong-term relationship herself with a\nguy that suggests two kids with living\nin the same houses he did and as soon as\nI found out I just cut her off yeah so\nthat was uh that led me to so she was\nhaving an affair with you\nuh well I was kind of like a uh I don't\nplay toy for example I she was basically\nyeah using me and I felt really used and\nI was just like wow I can't believe\nwomen can do that because I was taught\nmy whole life that you have to be you\nknow this loving guy you have to always\nbring flowers you know compliment all\nthe time and you know just be and just\nput them as your priority you know and\nhow did you understand\nwhy you ended up getting used like how\nlike how did that what's responsible for\nthat situation of\nyou bringing flowers visiting every two\nweeks and it turns out that she's like\nin another long-term relationship and\nhas kids oh no no that's nothing I don't\nthink that's responsible if I was to do\nthat I don't think that would have\nchanged anything but I was doing now I\nwas quote unquote simping for this woman\nI made this woman my center of of\nattention you know uh we always texted\nalways chatted and uh obviously no she\nwas still in a different relationship I\ndon't think that changed anything that\nimproved it disproved anything but I\njust feel like um yeah I got played I\ngot used I never you know and so what\nwhy do you think you got played\nwhy do I think yeah um because I was a\nbit I was a bit naive I think it was my\nsecond video without with my eyes real\nrelationship and I was really excited I\nreally found it pretty\num we were talking every day and when I\nfound well she told me actually she told\nme after six months she was seeing\nsomeone and I was just like okay I'm not\nseeing any more goodbye okay\nand and so what was the lesson that you\ntook away from that relationship\nthe lesson I took away was down long\ndistance and be careful who you see\nbecause uh no one is nothing is ever As\nIt Seems\nokay so how does that factor into all\nthe stuff about status and money and\nlooks\nwell the status Emily looks again it\ncomes from anecdotal evidence shared\nfrom you know uh channels where men\nshare their dating experiences such as\nwomen women too and the common factor is\nalways you know a man has success in\ndating when he improves His Image his\nappearance or when he improves his\nfaithson work or his financial situation\nbecause I feel like women gravitate\ntowards security as I guess a normal any\nnormal human being will gravitational\nsecurity and you know what's more secure\nthan the man has got his [ __ ] together\nexcuse me sorry he's got his stuff\ntogether\num and you know has a plan for his life\nWait So So you you're doing this a\ncouple times Damian where you'll say\nwomen gravitate towards security and\nthen you'll kind of say well any human\nwould gravitate towards security yeah I\nwant to be politically correct well so\nbut what do you I mean so I'm confused\nabout what you're saying because you\nseem to like what are you actually like\nif you think that women gravitate more\ntowards security than men than just say\nso\nlike I I don't know like half the\nproblem I'm having this conversation is\nthat you're playing political cover-up\nso I don't know what you actually\nbelieve so I don't even know what to try\nto understand\nwell if maybe a trans woman you know is\nlooking at this and she identifies as a\nwoman I don't want to say that you know\nif she does has fallen great but I guess\nguys can guys can feel these feelings\ntoo so I don't want to single them out\nbecause it's not always 100 men 100\nwomen sure guys can also feel the same\nway yeah but I'm hearing you kind of say\nthat that on average women value\nsecurity more than men that's what you\nbelieve\nno no but I will say most yeah on\naverage right so I think the Nuance is\nvery important we're not saying that all\nwomen are alike it's fine to believe\nthat way and and what you're basing that\non so what I'm really hearing you saying\nis that what you're basing that on a lot\nof the beliefs that you have are not\nnecessarily not even from your own\nexperience\nnot necessarily from science although it\nsounds like you're somewhat familiar\nwith a few scientific Concepts which I\nthink are pretty valid\nit's really just hearing people talking\nabout stuff both men and women who sort\nof\nstate that\na man who is more\nfamous more attractive and more wealthy\nis\nis that a requirement to get into a\nrelationship or is that make you more\nlikely or what no I wouldn't say it's a\nrequirement I would say if you wait long\nenough because usually women's fertility\nperiod starts from 30 to 35 sometimes\ncan this down to 40 years old I feel\nlike women tend to naturally settle for\nmen and you know and you're going to go\ninto relationship anyway you just have\nto wait long enough but I feel like if\nyou wanted to get into relationship in\nyour 20s these factors will play a major\nrole in your success I.E status money\nlooks\nand so so if you want to get a\nrelationship you should try to boost\nstatus monitor looks\nin the in your 20s yes or early 30s\nyeah I mean I I think that there's some\nyou know so I think if you ask most\nhuman beings would you rather date\nsomeone who's a 10 or a five most human\nbeings would say 10. I think if you ask\nmost human beings would you date someone\nwho has a net worth of 10 million\ndollars or ten dollars most human beings\nwould say 10 million I don't think that\nthat's\nwell no I mean I wouldn't say that I\nwouldn't say I don't want to date 10. I\nwant to date on average goal that I find\nnot only physically attractive obviously\nbut Pleasant to be around as well we\nhave common things as well you know I\ndon't want to always go for the highest\nbid or the best price ever I would say\nwhy not\nbecause I don't think we need to aim\nthat high I feel like we can get a\nnormal relationship but if you want to\nget into a if you want to get a chance\nat the relationship game in the early\n20s or early 30s\nyou need these factors that's what I\nfeel like\nyeah but what would you want in a\npartner would you want the most\nattractive partner and the richest\npartner possible no why not\nit's a good question\num\nmaybe because deep down I don't think I\ndeserved that maybe there's a bit of\nself-judgment the other thing I deserve\nthat or number two because I don't think\nthat's possible or attainable so\nI'll say that okay so fair enough I\nthink that that's a really good reason\nto not want a 10. so I I could imagine\nif I put not if I put my I've been here\nwhere you know I used to consider myself\nquite unattractive\nand\nI would be if I was actually dead if a\nwoman who had a net worth of 10 million\ndollars and was an absolute 10. started\ndating me I would be terrified that this\nis going to end one day and what the\nhell is going on I would be so confused\nI would feel much safer with like a\nseven or an eight\nand yeah so so now my question is so if\nwe're saying that if we're kind of\nsaying and you tell me okay Damien that\nthe reason that you're okay with less\nthan 10 is what exactly maybe there's a\nlack of confidence or it it maybe it\ndoesn't have anything to do with\nconfidence no I think it does I think\nyou're right sorry I think you're right\non that I think it does have to do with\nconfidence and I feel like I am not\nready for a tent I'm just not built uh\nmy body enough I have not um attractive\nenough for a 10 or I'm not Financial\nthese Stables so tens deserve tens\nwhile they gravitate towards tens or\nnines yeah sure and and you do you think\nyou could be happy with what would you\ngive yourself out of 10 today\nuh well I'll say average I'll say five\nokay would you be happy with a five\nyeah\nokay so now here's what I'm kind of\ncurious about\ndo you think that something in some of\nthe choices preferences that you have\nfor your own choices okay like who you\nactually end up dating\ndo you think that some of that is due to\nyour gender\nuh sorry I don't understand the question\nso my preferences like so you're saying\nlike I actually don't want a 10 I'd be\nokay with a five\nyeah do you think that you believe that\nbecause you're a man\num no I I don't know I don't think so\nso then so I'm with you so then my\nquestion is why wouldn't a woman believe\nthat too\nwhy wouldn't why wouldn't a woman who's\na five be like you know actually I'd be\nmore comfortable with a five\nbecause they've got social media and\nsocial media got plenty of options\nthat's why well you've got women not\nmost not all you've got social media\nno I don't what do you mean I I\nconsciously made the effort to stay off\nsocial media okay so so so that that's\nwhere things differ because if you were\nusing social media then then do you\nthink you would want tense\nno\nbut but I thought you said social media\nwas responsible\nwow oh I see Ah that's very good doctor\nK yeah yeah okay okay well I feel like\nagain when I said most women I feel like\nmost women would want that but again\nthere's the anomaly right there's the\nfive to ten percent or twenty percent\nlike me that will be no I just want to\nmeet a nice guy you know that uh is on\nthis purpose is you know it's semi-good\nlooking and have a relationship with\nthem I think I feel like there is women\nlike that out there you know that\nshelter themselves away from\nrelationships at the moment work on\nthemselves and you know they are not out\nthere seeking the next best prize I do\nbelieve there's something like that so\nyeah I feel like\nyou know I'm not I'd say that I'm\nanomaly because I think there's so many\nmen like me over here you know uh but\nyeah I feel like there's other women\nlike me yeah I'll say that yeah so okay\nso what I'm hearing you kind of say is\nthat\nthere can be women who like you would be\nhappier with a five than they would with\na ten\nthey're yes they can be yeah and very\nsmall percentage but yes I believe that\nwhat percentage\nAh that's beef I'll be a little bit\npositive here let's go 20 okay okay and\nand so what we're talking about is just\nlike sure those women are out there but\nthey're the minority because of social\nmedia\nand\nand yeah okay other factors as well\nsocial media is just the big factors in\nmy head yeah so Damien any questions for\nme like\nor any any thoughts\nwell no I just wanted to share my\nopinion with you I just went to get your\nthoughts on my opinions yeah so so I'm\nabout to do that so first of all dude\nfrom the bottom of my heart thank you so\nmuch for calling so I I think that in\nour community\nwe tend to be quite judgmental towards\npeople with your system of beliefs\nthis is something that honestly kind of\nbothers me a little bit so like I think\nthat\nthere are a lot like so if what I'm\nreally hearing from you is that if I\nwant to enter into a healthy\nrelationship\nI should be worth dating\nis that fair\nyes and right and yeah yeah yeah yeah\nyeah of course yeah and so your focus is\nlike you're I'm not hearing I'm hearing\nthat you're kind of downplaying some of\nyour beliefs I hear that you're playing\na little bit of the chameleon which is\nfine like I get it right because my\nguess is that in the past you've\nobserved places where if you were really\nhonest people would be quite judgmental\ntowards you\nyes I do agree and we are in 2023 you\nknow sure fair enough so so like you you\nhave to say certain politically collect\ncorrect things and then I have to try to\nsee through those things to see what you\nhave to believe which is fine so so and\nI I appreciate the I think it's it's not\nI I think there's a lot of good\ncompassion that you're demonstrating by\nlike going out of your way to try to be\nlike inclusive with people I think\nthat's actually quite important and sets\nyou apart quite a bit\nokay and I'm also hearing that basically\nyou you had one situation where you were\nreally taken advantage of\nand you're kind of as you put it simping\nover someone and\num it was somewhat\nokay all right thank you\num so\nwhat I'm kind of hearing is that\nyou had a bad experience and then now\nyou've realized I didn't quite hear you\nsay this but I'm sort of guessing I'm\nconnecting the dots here that\nif you were worth more that wouldn't\nhave happened\nexactly if I if I understood that I\ncould improve myself that I'm better\nthan this\num that I will be more careful as to\nwhat who I date and how I select uh\nobviously the day of my choice okay\nthat's not quite what I meant but that's\nI think that's a far better\ninterpretation thank you but and so now\nyou're like you've decided that the way\nthat you're going to approach\nrelationships\nis that you're gonna like become a chat\nright like that's the goal like I'm\ngonna I'm gonna become a chad\nyeah and so and then you have this\nbelief that since women want Chads the\ncloser I get to a Chad the more\nI'm not even sure exactly what your end\ngame is I don't know if you want to be\ndating lots of women or have get married\nand have kids or what you talk about\nfamily values or what yeah yeah so I\nwant to obviously get into a\nrelationship and uh just one\num well we'll see what happens I guess\nI'm not actually pursuing it like I said\nI'm not making a big deal if it happens\nit happens but I'm focused on my career\nat the moment I'm focused on my\nappearance at the moment yeah yeah good\ngood for you and so I I think you're\njust trying to become a better human\nbeing and you're sort of seeing that\nyou're hoping that relationships will\nkind of come along and the more valuable\nof a mate you are the more likelihood\nyou'll have to have like a good\nrelationship right\nyeah\nand then I'm also hearing that oh a lot\nof this stuff that you're watching a lot\nof like YouTube videos and stuff where\npeople are talking about this kind of\nidea that\nwomen\nhave a lot of options they want\nyou know eights nines tens the sort of\nlike value judgment based on particular\nstatus things which I think there's some\nlike data for right like I I don't think\nthat that's that ridiculous of a view\num but here's where I'd really question\nthings is that that I think there are\nsome places that I just encourage you to\nthink about and I'd love to understand\nif somebody else wants to talk about it\nlike so there's some perceptions which I\njust don't\nI can't connect in my mind so the first\nis that there are more lonely men or\nmore single men than single women that\nif we're talking about roughly a 50 50\npopulation split what that means is that\nwomen must be having more than one\nrelationship in order to have\nmen or like have you know open\nrelationships or you know whatever\nright so the only way to make that\nequate the math work is if one woman is\nhaving a relationship with multiple men\nwell that's that's that's certainly\npossible women some women not all some\nwomen do do that yeah yeah yeah yeah\nright so so if we're sort of saying on a\nglobal level like\n75 percent of women are in relationships\nand 25 percent of men are in\nrelationships like that math has to be\nworked out in some way and maybe it's 60\n40 but even in the case of 60 40 or 52\n48 which maybe maybe it makes sense that\nthat's a huge I mean that's like we're\ntalking about like millions of people\nso that's one thing that I'm kind of\nconfused by\num sorry just to just to clarify I'm\njust talking about sorry I should have\nclarified this in the beginning just\nfrom a western Society point of view I'm\nnot talking about you know the other\nside of the world because I feel like in\nthe Middle East or the East inside of\nthe world you know I think things are\nmore 50 50. just in our society as we're\nmore you know as we're quite you know um\nwhat's the word I don't want to say\nadvance but you know with comfort as a\nwestern Society you know I feel like\nthese problems are most relevant in our\nsociety than other societies on Earth\nsure so I think these problems are the\nother thing that I would really\nencourage people to think about and\nreally explore is the idea that older\nSociety worked\nso this is I think honestly a\nromanticized notion so it depends on\nwhat your definition of like work is did\nwe have more families and arguably\nmonogamous relationships we don't really\nknow I mean maybe a bunch of people are\ncheating and who knows but there were\nlike a lot of indicators that you know\nfamily values come with like problems so\nfor example like the rates of domestic\nabuse the rates of child abuse the rates\nof infant mortality like there's all\nkinds of stuff that used to be worse now\nit's hard to say that\nthe decay of family values is\nresponsible for certain bad things\nI also think it like people tend to\nromanticize the past but generally\nspeaking like a hundred years ago\nHumanity was like way worse\nso some of those things you can say okay\nwell the reason that Humanity was worse\nthen is not because of family values\nthat has decayed but the reason that\ninfant mortality is better is because we\nhave better medicine and stuff like that\nwhich is a fair point like that's\nabsolutely a variable that's involved\nbut I think there's this very common\nnotion and if you go to other parts of\nthe world and you see situations where\nthere are traditional family values that\nlike very strong marital structures no\nreal options for divorce and stuff like\nthat what you'll find and this has been\nkind of my experience and there's some\ndata to back this up I'm not an expert\nin these particular statistics but I've\ndefinitely seen them is that these\ntraditional Family Values societies tend\nto have like way higher rates of abuse\nokay and and then just the question\nbecomes when you say work\nbecause like if if you're a woman in the\nwest and you're in a physically abusive\nrelationship or or a man but more so a\nwoman actually you have options to\nescape which are socially acceptable\nwhereas like if you go to India like and\nyou're in a physically abusive\nrelationship like you don't have any\nchoices\nI want to say some something like 50 of\nmy\n50 of women in one to two generations in\nmy family maybe that's a little bit High\nmaybe closer to 25 percent were in like\nabusive relationships in my extended\nfamily\nand they just didn't have any options\nlike and maybe my family is particularly\nbad but that may not be the case so I\nthink a lot of it depends on what you\nsay or what you mean by this worked\nthis worked from the point of view that\nthe next generation of people emerged\nhow wanting to have families and wanting\nto get married if you look at our\ncurrent generation I don't know how many\npeople you can see they actually want to\nhave a family or want to get married\nfrom that point of view and so so you're\nyou're placing a value judgment on\nwanting a relationship or marriage is is\nbetter than not wanting a relationship\nor marriage\nbetter for the Human Society yeah in\nterms of evolution in terms of\nmaintaining our you know our numbers and\nnot going downhill\nour population that's what I mean yeah\nyeah right\nso there's an evolutionary argument for\nthat there's also an evolutionary\nargument that our population has reached\na particular point where the best thing\nfor evolution is for fewer people to\nhave children\nwell I disagree with that I think\nthere's plenty of land out there people\ncan have children I think people should\nhave children we're being attacked\neverywhere through chemicals in our food\nthrough pollution and through a common\nit's not your comments but for other\nfurther comments that say you know you\nshould not you know look at the\noverpopulation don't have kids I I\npersonally strongly disagree with that\nyeah that's fair I mean and anyway so\nwhat I think about this stuff is like I\nthink Damian you found something that\nworks for you I think you found I'm\nhearing that you found a plan for your\nlife the most important thing that I'm\nactually taking away which I haven't\nheard you say explicitly but I'm sort of\nhearing and you let me know if I'm\nreading this wrong is you will be damned\nbefore you ever simp over anyone ever\nagain\n100 100\nand so so you are going to accumulate as\nmuch power Prestige and money as you can\nso that you will never be someone's\n[ __ ]\noh you guys Sports on dogs okay yeah\nabsolutely I'm hearing that loud and\nclear clear my brother and and I I think\nhonestly that's the kind of thing where\nas long as you don't step on the bodies\nof Innocence on your climb to the top\nI'd say\nyou do you bro like if you wanna be a\nbetter human being if you want to\nincrease your financial situation if you\nwant to\num have your body be in a better\nphysical shape so that you can take like\npride of what you want if you want to\ntake responsibility over your life and\nstart to like try to be as good of a\nhuman as you can I'd say all the more\npower to you\nthank you Dr Cat\nthanks for calling Damien no thank you\nvery much it was uh I can't wait to\nlisten to this tomorrow\n[Laughter]\nthanks for having me and maybe uh again\nsoon I don't know yeah why don't you\nreport back in a year or two whether you\nended up in a relationship or not\nbecause maybe and how long have you been\non this journey of of status acquisition\nby the way uh for years\nso quick question why don't you think\nyou found a relationship yet\nbecause I go on to being one\nand why do you think that is because at\nthe moment casual hookups and just\nlooking at what's happening in in our\ngeneration is enough to put me off into\nhaving a relationship for now\ninteresting so what I'm hearing is that\nthere's an individual psychological\ncomponent outside of status money or\nprivilege or looks that is responsible\nfor you being single today spot on yep\nokay\nmaybe we could have a conversation about\nit later thank you very much you or or\nyour friends Damien I'd be happy to talk\nto them too\nall right thank you doctor okay all\nright man take care\nall right so I know there may be people\nwaiting but I think we're done for the\nday chat\nso here's here's the thing so I I know\nthat\nthere's a lot of toxicity amongst men\nnowadays\nbut I really uh not no no exaggeration I\nlove that Damien called in and I love\nthat we talked to him\nbecause I I think it it really speaks to\na lot of the challenges and here here's\nthe thing if you look at\nwhat people view as toxic masculine role\nmodels\nthe one thing that toxic masculine Role\nModels do really really really well\nand we got to be careful here okay\nis they validate the experience of men\nso there's a big difference between\nthings are not this bad it's all in your\nhead\nor\nother people have it hard too there's\nall kinds of invalidating stuff to say\nso what I've noticed about\nthe quote unquote toxic which which I'm\nsort of using other people's terms\nbecause I'm I have a lot more to say\nabout this and a lot more to think about\nthis but the one thing that they do is\nthey say yeah your life is hard and\noftentimes what they do is they'll say\nyes your life is difficult\nhere is the way that you can fix it\nand oftentimes I think that here is the\nway that you can fix it is where there's\na lot of in my opinion immoral stuff\nthat goes on right so just like I said\nto Damien like is you climb to the Top\nby all means\njust don't do it on the backs of\nInnocence\nbut I think this is where as a society\nwe are very very invalidating towards\nthe experiences of men\nand and so just case in point like you\nknow I've talked to a couple of women\nrecently and and stuff like that it one\nprime example is they shouldn't feel\nrejected I'm not rejecting them that's\nyour perspective what about their\nperspective\nit's the same thing as people shouldn't\nfeel upset about non-consensual\npornography or deep-fried pornography it\nisn't real\nin both cases\nwe're not acknowledging the experience\nof someone else\nit's the same\nand that's the problem\nand so we're going to keep on seeing\nquote unquote toxic masculinity\nif those are the only spaces that men\ncan go\nto receive support we're going to keep\nseeing those place this crop up\nright like\nI've got two options I can go to one\nplace where people say yes your life is\nhard here's a path to fix it\nlike does that sound so bad\nand then there's another place where\npeople say you shouldn't be complaining\nwhat are you complaining about\nwhich way do you think people are gonna\ngo\nand and I think that like you know\nthere's some stuff here that's good like\nif we listen to Damien he's like I'm\ngonna put together my life and then I'm\ngonna be someone who's worth dating\nI don't think that's a bad view like I\ndon't think wanting to better yourself\nas a human being\nand acknowledging that maybe like in\norder to have a relationship like I need\nto put some work in\nI don't think that's bad\nlike I'm in a relationship I've been\nmarried for a while now and I still try\nto be a better person\nright like I'm working on myself\nlike I want to be better I want to be a\nbetter human being to enrich the lives\nof the people around me\nall right\nI think the challenge is that\noftentimes that betterment can come at\nthe expense of other people I think\noftentimes I think the problem is that\nit's it's surrounded the core idea I\nthink is pretty good\nwhich is that\nyou know like I should be a better\nperson to find a better relationship\nfair enough\nI think what people Miss is that as he\nsaid I mean never said it until I said\nit which is a lot of this stuff is\nfueled by\ntrauma honestly is what it sounds like\nbut you know why men don't say oh this\nis the result of trauma you know why\nDamian didn't say that because we don't\nreally let men be victims\nthat's changing now thankfully\nespecially in places like this community\nbut that's it's a it's a big problem\nwhereas like if you're a man and you say\nI'm struggling I'm traumatized\nhow do people respond to you\nnow I'd like to think that at least in\nour audience like I think the women in\nour community and a lot of women out\nthere and this isn't like all women are\nbad I I want to say 50 plus percent of\nwomen are pretty good about this\nbut the problem is that and this is half\nthe problem with the Internet is that\neven if 90 of women out there or and by\nthe way this isn't just women when we\nsay when I say we don't allow men to be\nvictims men don't allow men to be\nvictims\nso this is the other thing is that we\nassume that okay if Society is not\nallowing men to be victims people jump\nto blaming women\nso a good example of this I was reading\nsome research recently\npeople will talk about unfair treatment\nin the court system which I would agree\nand there's a lot of good data that\nshows that things like child's like\nchild custody and things like that\nthere's discrimination within the court\nsystem\nare most judges women\nor most judges men\nI really don't know\nbut when we talk about discrimination in\nthe court system\neveryone's like and somehow\ndiscrimination in the court system leads\nto women being bad\nbut hold on a second\nwho's doing the Discrimination it could\nbe man\nso the problem that I see with all this\nstuff is like we start from a real place\nand then we just jump to something else\nand what we jump to is based on our\nbiases as opposed to what the reality is\nand some of it like is the more I try to\nunderstand it like some of this stuff\njust falls apart\nand there could be good reasons for it\nright so if someone says yeah there are\nmore single men today than they're\nsingle women like that could be\nstatistically true I don't know like I\nswear to God I'm gonna read up on it and\nI'm gonna see it's not my place to\nconvince Damian that he's wrong it's not\nmy place to debate him\ninto submission\nit's my place to learn from him\nit's my place to investigate it's my\nplace to try to understand what is the\nreality of the situation we're facing\nright now\nand that there may be some kind of like\nway that two things that feel like\nthey're conflicting\nand this is the problem with gender\nDynamics is that there are two\nperspectives which do not align\nand so what the men try to do is we try\nto yank the women over and say no we are\nright you are wrong let me debate you\nuntil you understand the error of your\nways and the women are doing the same\nthing\nthey're like y'all are wrong\nlet me debate you until and and tug you\nover here and pull you to my side of\nthinking\nwhereas the the honest truth is that\nthere's probably something in the middle\nthere's something we're missing here\ntwo perspectives this is something that\nis really good in dialectical behavioral\ntherapy which is based on this concept\nof advait vedanta\nwhich is that two opposing things can be\ntrue at the same time this is something\nthat we don't understand in the in\nWestern Society this is weird\nbut in the western Society we believe in\nthe law of contradiction\nso if something is a it cannot be B\nsomething really cool in the East is\nthey don't believe that so in the west\nwe think that if logically a is true it\ncannot also be not true something can\nonly be true or true in the East I know\nit's super bizarre it's a different\nsystem of logic they say actually yeah a\ncan be true and a can be false\nand then everyone's like what the hell\ndo you mean\nI'll give you a simple example\nI love her I hate her\nthose can both be true\nwhen you actually look at experience\nsure in the abstract logic these things\ncannot be true but in the experience of\nhuman beings two opposites can be true\nwomen can not reject men\nand men can be rejected\nthat's bizarre right so instead of men\ntrying to convince women y'all are\nrejecting us too hard are women trying\nto convince men we're not rejecting you\nlike those both those experiences can be\ntrue and we've heard it today that's why\nwe have conversations like this\nbecause the conditioning that we grew up\nit means one word means different things\nto different people\none experience can have two different\nimpacts\nand that's where this rub comes down to\nright because like there's data support\nthis right so I'm not 100 sure by all\nmeans like correct me if I'm wrong\nbut my understanding is that there are\nit is easier to ma women have more\nchoices on Tinder than men it's an\nisolated statement I'm not saying women\nhave dating easier or anything like that\non a particular platform there's a lot\nof strong evidence that shows that it is\neasier for a woman to find a man on\nTinder than it is for a man to find\nwoman\nTinder Publishers research about this\nand so it kind of makes sense to me\nthat when a woman gets rejected by a man\nthere may be other options and I think\nthis is an analogy that made sense to me\nI'm not saying it's correct\nthat the rejection hurts a lot more when\nit's the only one you got you've got one\nshot\nso it's Do or Die\nI also think I learned a lot from\ntalking to Anita about\nhow sexuality is used to\ndebase and dominate women it's used as a\npower Dynamic so that's really\ninteresting\nand the other thing that I'm beginning\nto learn is that so a lot of women are\njudged based on particular things their\nvalue as a woman comes down to so she\nwas talking about for example like you\nknow fertility\nso a lot of women's value is a is judged\nby some to be based on their capacity to\nbe sexual objects\nwhich is bad\nI think\nthe interesting thing is what is the\nvalue of a Man based on\nbecause what I heard from the men today\nis my value is a man depends on whether\nI can get someone to say yes\nso I\nanyway I'm\nthis was great\nfor those of y'all that are joining us\nfor the first time on YouTube welcome\num I'm really grateful I apologize that\nwe were not able to get to all of the\ncomments thoughts I've been reading more\ntoday than I usually do\num\nbut I think the one thing that we can\nall agree on men women and everything in\nbetween\nand\nDamien\nthere are problems right now\nthat's the one thing we agree on\nthings are [ __ ]\nso then the question is what are we\ngoing to do about it\nso they're going to be some people who\nwill say\nhere is the problem here's the answer\nthis is what you should do the problem\nis a lot of people are very very\ndefinitive\nand a lot of them disagree\nso here's what I can tell you\nhere's my offer to y'all\nit's my belief that good diagnosis\nprecedes good treatment and part of the\nreason that I think gender Dynamics are\ngetting so much worse is everyone is\njumping to treatment without\nunderstanding what the problem is\nso men are formulating all this advice\nfor men and women are formulating all\nthis advice for women\nbut I'm not hearing\ndialogue I'm not hearing understanding\nso that's what we're gonna do\nwe're gonna try to understand what's\ngoing on and this is something where I\nneed y'all's help\nand I need your help with this way more\nthan I've ever needed your help with\nanything before this\nI've needed your help for all kinds of\nstuff and you all have been absolutely\nthere for us and we're grateful for that\nand there for us means showing up when\nwe stream means donating or whatever\nmeans\nwe built Dr K's guide and some of y'all\nwere like hey maybe I'll pay money for\nthis thing and maybe it'll help me most\nof y'all are pretty happy with it pretty\nmuch right it's a good product so you\nguys have helped us a lot already\nbecause I don't I don't you know I do\nvery little clinical care now because I\ncan put food on the table\nthanks to you all and I'm grateful for\nthat but I need your help more today\nthan I have before\nand there's one really big reason for\nthat so far what we've been able to\naccomplish at healthy gamer has a lot to\ndo with my knowledge and expertise\nbut newsflash that has limits\nand never has it been more limited in\nthis\nfor a couple of reasons the first is\nthat I'm not a woman\nI can't know what the experience of\nbeing a woman is like\nand what's even worse I even have\ncolleagues\nwho do to some amount of academic\ntraining\nwill think that that is a substitute for\nbeing a woman on this Earth\nwhich I don't think that's the case\nso I need the help of all of the women\nin in our community to help me and all\nof the uh all of us men to understand\nthe other thing which honestly I'm lucky\nabout I can thank my karma\nis that I'm not dating today\nI got lucky\nI'm a boomer\nI missed the boat on online dating so I\nhave no idea what this is like\nso then the question becomes what do we\ndo here at HG\ndo we only do things that Dr K is the\nexpert on or do we do the work that\nneeds to be done\nand we're gonna try to do the work that\nneeds to be done I'll do my part\nwhich is read this book\nokay and I'm gonna read I have about\n20 papers\non infidelity\nthat are sitting on my hard drive that\nI'm going to read over the weekend\nso I'm going to do my best to synthesize\nscience literature my experiences\nworking with people who have been\ncheated on who have done the cheating\nmarriage counseling all this kind of\ncrap I'm gonna do what I can\nbut I need you all's help and the way\nthat I need y'all's help is exactly like\ntoday\nand we need to hear from you all and not\njust the ones that are PC\nhuge props to Damian\nbecause saying that kind of stuff is\nabsolutely applauded in one corner of\nthe internet and absolutely vilified in\nanother corner of the internet\nthank you very much\nI don't know does can you rate you can't\nraid someone can you I don't know how to\ndo that\nDr K becomes dating coach\nmaybe one day\num\nAlfonso cardoso is very nice he's saying\ndon't work on a Sunday Dr K I work seven\ndays a week\nwe made a YouTube video about it you can\nwatch it if you're interested\nI think it's interesting so\nI have lots of thoughts I
