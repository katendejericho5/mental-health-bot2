    "transcript": "every time you play a video game it\ndoesn't end with the video game right\nyou're going to be thinking about the\nmatch and you're going to be molding\nbecause you had some Noob and they had\nsome person who was a Smurf and so for\nthe next hour after your match you're\nthinking in a negative space and then\nthere's no room for creativity I want to\ntalk to you all today about something\nthat I call the professional Tipping\nPoint which is the point at which your\nnatural impulse to be productive\nactually outweighs your natural impulse\nto like procrastinate or waste time a\nlot of people will ask me questions like\nwhy is it that I can spend hours and\nhours and hours like grinding towards a\nuseless virtual goal whether it be likes\non social media or an achievement in a\nvideo game but I can't actually put my\nmind to like being productive in life\nand it's really confusing for them\nbecause anytime they are productive in\nlife they Feel So Satisfied content and\nproud and even when they spend all this\nlike waste this time kind of grinding\nfor useless goals they kind of feel\nempty inside and so it's a really\nconfusing experience for people about\nwhy they can't be productive if you're a\ngamer like me you may not be the best at\nprofessional communication because after\nall we learned how to communicate\nthrough DMs and Discord messages and\nstuff like that and we have our own lead\nspeaker gamer speak which doesn't really\ntranslate into the workplace the go good\nnews is that grammarly is here to help\nyou tailor your tone to suit

focused and\nconfident grammarly integrates exactly\nwhere you already work so you can plug\nit into something like Google Docs or\nword docs or email or things like that\nand the other really cool thing is that\ngrammarly actually has a tone aspect as\nwell if we look at one of the things\nthat gamers are worth that it's\nconveying tone through written text\nwhich let's be honest is something that\nwe all struggle with a little bit at\nwork the right tone can move your\nprojects forward with the help of\ngrammarly go to grammarly.com\nhealthygamer GG to sign up for an\naccount and if you'd like to level up\nyour writing and tone upgrade to\ngrammarly premium for 20 off so I used\nto take call at McLean Hospital and if\nyou all aren't kind of familiar with\nwhat call is you usually have one Doctor\nWho's like responsible overnight for\nsome amount of stuff now McLean is a\nfreestanding Psychiatric Hospital which\nmeans that there are you don't really\nneed like there aren't medical\nemergencies and stuff so there's one\nDoctor Who's on call and this happens to\nbe me maybe once every two weeks or so\nso I'm on call at McLean and the thing\nabout being on call is that it could be\na busy night or it could be a quiet\nnight so sometimes things are like your\nyou know luck is in your favor and\neveryone's kind of asleep and you don't\nreally have to worry about much or\nyou're kind of getting paged constantly\nhey this person's having trouble\nsleeping this person is agitated this\nperson is hallucinating and so your\nnight can be everything from yeah I\nslept six or seven hours and never got\ninterrupted to I was constantly getting\ncalled to different units and and having\nto you know restrain people sometimes or\ndealing with hallucinations or psychosis\nor whatever so it's really kind of like\na crap shoot in terms of you know is it\ngoing to be a quiet night or a good\nnight and so what most people do to\nprepare to be on call is they'll like\nget their entertainment ready so you can\nsort of think about being on call like\nkind of like being a flight where you\nknow you're gonna have to be stuck in\nthis situation for someone out of time\nso you want to set up your entertainment\nand I remember one night in particular I\nwas getting like pretty frustrated\nbecause I I'd set the set up these shows\nthat I wanted to watch and like every\nlike five to eight minutes I would get a\npage it wasn't so much work to where\nlike I could continue working but you\nknow I I deal with a page I make a phone\ncall and then I'm waiting like five\nminutes or six minutes I'm like all\nright seems like the work's done like\neverything's totally cool so then I like\nwill pull out my iPad and I start\nwatching something in two minutes into\nthe show I get another page and so this\nkind of start stop thing happened a lot\nand I got incredibly frustrated because\nlike I wanted to be entertained but like\nI wasn't getting entertained and I I\njust wish like okay if you guys need me\nto work I can totally work I totally\nfine like taking a thousand pages but\nthis whole like being in the middle of\nbeing busy and being entertained was\njust incredibly frustrating so I decided\nto do something a little bit unusual\nwhich was like okay if I can't get into\na show let me try doing some work\ninstead so what I I did instead was\njournal and specifically this particular\nday what I what I ended up doing was\nwriting fiction so I started writing\nsome fiction and then worked on some\nnon-fiction stuff I was kind of working\non some stuff like around video game\naddiction and stuff like that just\njotting down thoughts and it was a\nreally interesting moment for me because\nwhat started out as a lose-lose\nsituation sort of turned into a win-win\nsituation where if I didn't get\ninterrupted and I worked for half an\nhour I felt like pretty productive and\nwas like pretty like happy about that\nand if I did get interrupted I didn't\nfeel this sort of like frustration about\nnot being able to get into the show at\nleast I was able to write like two or\nthree thoughts about a particular\nproject I was working on or write a\nparagraph around fiction or something\nlike that so it sort of became cool\nbecause like in in the span of a few\nmoments like I got some work done and I\nfelt pretty productive so that\nexperience kind of stuck with me and I\nsort of took a key takeaway away from\nthat experience which is to really try\nto capture my creative impulses and if\nyou want to reach this professional\nTipping Point one of the first things\nthat I would strongly recommend that you\ndo is actually capture your creative\nimpulses so start jotting things down if\nyou want to work on something if you\nhave an idea whether it's business\nrelated or fiction related or creative\nor artwork or whatever like even\ndoodling to start capturing your\nimpulses and this becomes really\nimportant because normally when we have\na creative impulse we don't really\nreinforce it in any kind of way right I\nhave a particular idea and I don't\nreally capitalize on it I don't really\nturn it into anything so the idea comes\nand goes so the first step to reaching\nyour professional Tipping Point is\nsimply to capture your creative impulses\nand this becomes important for step two\nwhich is to reflect on the work that\nyou've done so this is kind of something\nthat I've noticed that people aren't\nreally good at in real life so if you\nplay video games you'll kind of know\nthat like playing a lot doesn't\nnecessarily make you better right so\nyou'll have people who are playing a\nparticular video game who will be stuck\non bronze rank for like five years and\nwe sort of know this in real life as\nwell where sometimes you'll have people\nmaybe that you know or or maybe you kind\nof fall into this category where you've\nbeen like sort of professionally stuck\nfor a while that putting in more and\nmore and more time doesn't necessarily\nlead to advancement and there's even\ndata on this people have done research\nstudies on Physicians for example I just\nknow this research the best right that\nactually shows that the amount of time\nyou practice as a physician doesn't\nactually make you a better physician\nthat you can practice medicine for 30\nyears and you will still under perform\nsomeone who's been practicing for five\nyears that essentially once you become a\nphysician you get kind of lumped into a\nparticular quartile either you're in the\ntop quarter of Physicians you know top\nhalf of Physicians bottom half of\nPhysicians or bottom quarter and that\nthat is actually determined within the\nfirst couple years of practice and stays\ntrue for the rest of Life essentially\nyou get put into platinum gold silver or\nbronze and you stay there and so as\npeople started to explore this what they\nreally discovered is what determines\nwhere you end up is how you deal with\nlearning how you actually improve so the\nreason you stay hard stuck in bronze is\nbecause you don't actually do any replay\nanalysis if you actually want to get\nbetter at a game you have to you can't\njust practice you have to intentionally\nlook at what you did wrong and try to\nintentionally improve it and what they\nbasically discovered is that there are\nsome doctors who do that which is why\nthey start out at platinum and stay\nplatinum and there are other people who\nare just sort of like do the status quo\nand just queue up every day see patients\nand they don't really learn very much\nand so what we want to do is leverage\nthat principle into our own life and\nwhat we actually want to do is reflect\non the work that we've done this\nreflection step also really applies to\nthat night at McLean Hospital so when I\nused to write things down they would\nkind of get written down and then\nnothing would happen to them sure I\njotted a couple things down but then\nlike they'd sit in a notebook somewhere\nand be ignored for a few years and\nnothing came out of my creative impulse\nI realized that what I really needed to\ndo was actually reflect on what I had\nwritten so the next time I was on call I\nhad that same notebook and I flipped it\nopen and I tried to see where I you know\nI left off so I kind of noticed\nsomething pretty cool when I did that\nwhich is that as I read what I had\nactually jotted down it sparked new\nideas and even if I didn't feel like\nwriting all I really had to do is read\nwhat I had already written to sort of\nhelp me feel productive and then I was\ninspired to write again and there's a\nreally interesting yogic concept that\nkind of relates to this which is simply\nunderstanding our indrias so our indrias\nare our sense organs and one of the\nreally interesting things about our\nsense organs is that they cultivate our\nthoughts so what the yogis essentially\ndiscovered was that my sensory input is\ngoing to shape the thoughts that I have\nand this concept of indria's cultivating\nparticular thoughts also explains a\nlittle bit about why we get stuck in\nunproductive things so when I spend my\ntime playing a video game watching a\nvideo game reading discussions about a\nvideo game what do you think I'm going\nto think about and it's not just video\ngames right so I see so many people\nengaged in political content without\never doing anything productive right so\nI'm reading tweets from people who are\npolitical trolls and I'm agreeing with\ntweets that I love I am crapping on\ntweets that I dislike responding to them\ntrolling with them and I'm not even\nvoting right so this is like people\nengage in politics in such an\nunproductive way and then what do I end\nup doing I end up having conversations\nabout it I get end up getting into\nfights with my family members over\nholidays because all in my mind I have\nthese political thoughts political\nthoughts political thoughts and where\nall those those political thoughts and\nargumentative thoughts those divisive\nthoughts coming from they're coming from\nmy indrias same is true of video games\nright so whatever we bombard our senses\nwith are going to be what we naturally\nthink about if you're interested in that\nconcept by the way we that's a huge part\nof Dr K's guide to ADHD and doing stuff\nand you all can kind of check that out\nwhere we really explore the relationship\nbetween indrias and generating thoughts\ngoing back to the professional Tipping\nPoint though what I realized is that on\nany given moment I have a choice between\ncultivating a particular kind of thought\nthat will be unproductive or a\nparticular kind of thought that will be\nproductive so the next time on I was on\ncall I have a choice if I open up my\niPad and I start watching something\nit'll trigger a particular train of\nthoughts and if I open up my notebook\nand look at that that'll trigger a\ndifferent train of thoughts and this\nprocess of which train I want to board\nreally comes down to dealing with\nboredom so I want you all to understand\nthis so when I'm bored my mind is\nlooking for a particular kind of\nstimulation usually what my mind reaches\nfor is something that's very very\ndopaminergic and in that moment if I\nactually lean into a dopaminergic thing\nwhat will actually happen is I'll reduce\nmy creative impulse because what I'll\nactually be doing is resolving the\nboredom through some kind of dopamine\nhit and then my brain is going to learn\nthat when I am bored I need to take a\nhit of dopamine to make that boredom go\naway if I'm able to resist that boredom\nit's not even that I needed to really\nconquer it and this is a the really key\nthing I just have to kind of\nprocrastinate on the boredom and not\nreach for the dopaminergic thing and\nthen something very special will happen\nif you stay bored long enough your mind\nwill actually start to think creatively\nso a good example of this is like shower\nthoughts or going on a hike because if\nyou go on a hike for four hours what are\nyou doing your mind isn't really like\ndoing anything you're not like watching\nanything you're not listening to\nanything there's no podcasting maybe\nyou're listening to music who knows but\nyou're not really bored right and\noftentimes so when you do things like go\non Hikes or even take showers all kinds\nof creative thoughts will start to arise\nso another key Point another key part of\nreaching our professional Tipping Point\nis actually like surviving some amount\nof boredom and if you can survive some\namount of boredom then what will\nnaturally start to happen is that\ncreative impulse will arise now how does\nthis reach a professional Tipping Point\nand what do we even mean by that so what\nI what the reason I call it a\nprofessional Tipping Point is because\nfor a couple years of my life for the\nmajority of my life being productive was\na temporary thing that would always end\nso I'd have these bursts of productivity\nand this burst of productivity I get so\nexcited I'm like man I'm productive man\nI'm productive this is great this is\ngreat I wish I could do this all the\ntime in the back of my mind I knew that\nit wouldn't last in the back of my mind\nI knew that at some point the desire to\nplay a video game would win in the end\nit almost felt a little bit like one of\nthese like Zombie Survival kind of games\nwhere like the waves keep increase\nsinging the zombies are growing and the\nzombies are growing and the zombies are\ngrowing and they'll eventually overwhelm\nyou or maybe it's kind of like Lord of\nthe Rings where the Orcs are invading\nand the armies of Sauron are always\ngoing to win by relationship with\nproductivity was that even though I can\nwin a battle today eventually my\ndegenerate gamer mind would win right\nand I would stop being productive I\nwould fall into this stuff and the\nbeauty of the professional Tipping Point\nis something weird happened a couple\nyears into residency and when I started\nthis process of being productive or not\nnot even being productive forget about\nthat term capturing my creative impulses\njotting them down then reflecting on my\ncreative impulses and the third thing\nthat I would actually intentionally try\nto do is ride out boredom ride out the\nurges that come with boredom and when I\nwrote those out I started to think\ncreatively and then I started capturing\nthe impulses and what I sort of noticed\nwas this kind of like snowballing\nAvalanche effect so just to walk you\nthrough it so now like every time I go\non call I'm not really doing anything\nentertaining what I'm actually doing is\nlike I'm sitting there and I'm like okay\nlike maybe I want to watch a replay of\nlike a Esports game that I missed or\nsomething like that but instead of doing\nthat what I did was just wait wrote out\nthe impulse and then I started to think\nand I was like oh wouldn't it be cool if\nI made some jotted down some thoughts\nabout let's say the lazy man's road to\nsuccess which was the project that I was\nworking on at the time and so I started\njotting down those thoughts and that was\npretty cool so like I felt pretty good\nabout that and then next time around I\nwould read those thoughts and the more\nthat I would read those thoughts I would\ntrigger more ideas and the more that I\ntriggered those kind of ideas something\ncool started to happen the amount of\nresistance to boredom that I needed\nstarted to shrink and now if I could\nresist the impulse for 30 seconds\ninstead of 60 seconds a creative idea\nwould start to pop up it's almost like\nmy brain realized oh we're not going to\ndo that dopamine thing anymore let's go\nstraight to the creative impulses and\nwhat starts to happen is a cycle so the\nmore creative I got the more I jotted\nthings down the more I jotted things\ndown and the more I spent time thinking\nabout them then there was more stuff to\nread and now my ideas are really\nstarting to come together and that would\nreinforce my indrias right so now I'm\nbombarding my mind with like productive\nkind of thoughts and creative kind of\nthoughts and the more that I bombard my\nmind with that something magical\nhappened about two years and three years\nin where for the first day I woke up one\nday like on a weekend and I was like I\nactually don't feel like playing a video\ngame I have some free time I pulled out\nmy notebook and I started being\nproductive and it was like bizarre and I\nthink that honestly if this had not\nhappened I would not be here telling you\nthis today because this is like\nliterally how I started healthy gamer\nfor three or four years during residency\nI was just jotting down thoughts and\nrefining them and working on them and\nthings like that I was being productive\ninstead of wasting my time playing video\ngames I started healthy gamer or started\nthinking about it but I started doing\nother stuff in residency like other\nprojects and things like that and I\nstarted to become kind of like more and\nmore productive and then I stopped\nwanting the dopamine and you may be\nlistening to this and and feeling like a\nlittle bit skeptical but like there's\nthere's no way that this would work for\nme or like what about you know are you\ntelling me that I should grind all the\ntime and this is where there's an\nimportant distinction to be made I'm not\nsaying that you need to work right so\nI'm not saying if you've got some\ndead-end job that I'm not saying that\nyou should avoid dopaminergic activities\nand just grind for the sake of your boss\nwhat I'm saying is be creative and be\nproductive and in fact the more that you\ndo that the better things will become so\nit's it's kind of weird but it's because\nI capitalized on those productive\nimpulses that I eventually decided to\nkind of become an entrepreneur that's\nnot even how I think about it I didn't\nset out to be an entrepreneur what\nactually happened is I was like hey this\nis really cool like let me think about\nthis and like let me do more and let me\ndo more let me do more let me start\nstreaming on Twitch let me start sharing\nmy thoughts with people and I got such\npositive feedback I started working on\nit more and more and more and more and\nthat's what I mean about the\nprofessional Tipping Point the\nprofessional Tipping Point is the point\nat which you no longer have to resist\nthe dopaminergic urge and you tip into\nyour natural impulse being productive\nbut that doesn't mean grind for your\nboss that means actually if you're at\nwork and you're thinking grind for your\nboss don't grind for your boss when\nyou're at work and you have some kind of\nidea like wouldn't it be cool if I spent\nsome time thinking about this or this\nseems like a cool idea or I love to\nwrite a book about this that's what you\nshould be capturing we're not talking\nabout grinding for the sake of your boss\nwhat we're talking about is capturing\nyour creative impulse as you capture it\nreflect on it as you reflect on it\nyou're feeding your indrias information\nthat will then start populating thoughts\nit's like you're plant planting seeds\nand once you plant enough seeds\neventually what you'll grow is like a\nGrove and that Grove will start to have\nlots of fruit bearing trees and those\nthose trees will start to bear fruit\nwhereas right now if you really pay\nattention what are you cultivating in\nyour mind every time you play a video\ngame it doesn't end with the video game\nright you're going to be thinking about\nthe match and you're going to be molding\nbecause you had some Noob and they had\nsome person who was a Smurf and so for\nthe next hour after your match you're\nthinking in a negative space and then\nthere's no room for creativity so the\nreason that we're stuck is because we\nhave this Avalanche snowball process in\nthe wrong direction in order to change\nthat and start to actually like harness\nthe Creative Energy of your mind to be\nproductive we need to hit that\nprofessional Tipping Point after you hit\nthe professional Tipping Point being\nproductive becomes easy it becomes the\nnatural impulse that you want to do and\nhitting that professional Tipping Point\ninvolves three major steps capture\nwhatever fleeting creative impulses you\nhave even if you find a single piece of\nfruit Don't Let It Go and harness those\nseeds second thing is to actually\nreflect on the work that you do not only\ndoes a reflection positively reinforce\nthe energy invest investment that you've\nmade it also feeds your indrias and\nmakes you more prone to like engage in\nthat kind of work again and the last\nthing to do is to understand that a key\npart of this is going to be riding out\nboredom and the better that you get it\nriding out boredom just don't slip into\nthe dopaminergic track the creative or\nproductive stuff will will naturally\nstart to arise so I hope that this is\nhelpful for you and for me it's been\nabsolutely revolutionary to like hit my\nown professional Tipping Point now that\nI've hit it not only do I want to work\nand I've cultivated this kind of like\nattitude of like wanting to be\nproductive I've also like started to\nenjoy like the dopaminergic activity\nmore so if you the last kind of thing\nthat I kind of noticed is that now when\nI sit down to play a video game I still\nI like I really enjoy playing the video\ngame but the interesting thing is that I\nhave so much indria momentum from my\nreflection on my productive tasks that\nas soon as the video game ends my mind\nis filled with thoughts of wanting to be\nproductive and once you hit that point\nlife becomes easy\nforeign"
