    "transcript": "if you're someone who is like oh no this\nshouldn't be a problem I don't\nunderstand why people are complaining\nyou think about a single time in your\nlife and hopefully for the sake of\nlearning this has happened to you where\nsomeone was talking crap about you and\nother people were hearing it and how did\nthat make you feel and now you amplify\nit literally by ten thousand or one\nhundred thousand because that's what\nhappens in scenarios like this so\nsometimes on the internet there's drama\nand when there's drama we actually try\nreally hard to steer clear of it\na big part of what we do here at healthy\ngamer is not talk about people\none of our Central principles is that we\nthink you should talk to people and half\nthe problem with the internet right now\nis that everyone opines everyone has\nopinion everyone says what other people\nshould and shouldn't be doing we try\nreally hard to step away from that and\nactually like talk to the people who are\ninvolved to hear their experience of\nthings\nthis is something that I learned to\nValue originally when I was in India\nabsolutely learned to Value it ten times\nover as a psychiatrist that you actually\nneed to talk to people and listen to\npeople about what their experience of a\nparticular thing is\nthe reason that we're talking about\ntoday about non-consensual pornography\ndeep fakes revenge porn and all that\nkind of stuff is because there's a lot\nof science actually out there which very\nfew people know the reason that we're\nchoosing to open our mouths today is\nbecause I think a lot of people really\nneed to understand\nwhat impact this has\nbecause we've heard a lot of people say\nhey this is harmful to me and we've also\nheard a lot of people say it shouldn't\nbe right you didn't actually participate\nin it you don't have to watch it we hear\nall these kinds of statements\nso I'm going to start off by sharing a\nlittle bit about the research so the\nfirst thing is that if you look at the\nresearch on this kind of stuff there's\nactually a research term called\nnon-consensual pornography and why do\nthey call it that it's because kind of\nlike revenge porn falls under that but\nit's basically what are the\npsychological impacts of pornography\nthat is doesn't have the consent of the\npeople involved\nso there's one study that\nshows that\nafter non-consensual pornography is\nreleased\nover half of the people who are involved\nwant to kill themselves\nthat's crazy so for the record ninety\npercent of people who are in\nnon-consensual pornography are women 10\nAre Men about\nand this is like a one-time thing that\nleads to suicidal ideation and over 50\npercent of people in addition to all\nkinds of crap around PTSD anxiety\ndepression all that stuff gets worse\nbut there are very few things I've seen\nas a psychiatrist that a single event\ncauses someone to go from zero percent\nsuicidality all the way to suicidal\nideation and this is a common experience\nright so this happens in over 50 percent\nof people who have non-consensual\npornography made about them or released\nabout them\nso the first thing is that if you're\nthinking oh this isn't that bad\nactually the data suggests it is and\nhere's the other reason why I want you\nall to really take a step back and think\nabout this because when it comes to\nstuff like deep fakes you can have an\nopinion I can have an opinion\nresearch on the negative impacts of deep\nfakes we're not really sure when that'll\ncome out we actually have a lot about\nnon-consensual pornography which is\nwhat's really cool is it like talks\nabout non-consensual pornography\nbut the truth is you don't actually know\nyou have no idea what the psychological\nimpact is like for the person who's\nactually the victim we don't have really\nanything in the history of humanity that\nsort of\nhas allowed the human brain to\nexperience this kind of thing so like 10\n000 years ago when people were making\ncave art if I wanted to draw a nudie\npicture about someone in the colony like\nit's cave art that who knows what\npsychological impact that has deep take\nfor fake pornography is completely\ndifferent so I'm going to give you all\nan example of I was trying to think\nabout how could someone who has not been\nthe victim of a deep fake understand\nwhat the psychological impact of a deep\nfake is\nand so I was just trying to think about\nwhat can I do and here's the best that I\ncould come up with and it's probably\nterrible\nso imagine for a moment that you were\ngiven GHB Rohypnol or the date right\ndate rape drug or some kind of other\ndissociative or Amnesia inducing agent\nso you have no recollection of it and\nthen you engage in a sexual act that you\nhave no recollection of someone films it\nand then you watch it the next day what\ndo you think would be\nthe psychological impact on you\nif you saw yourself\nengaging in a sexual act that you have\nno memory of\nsomething about this example I hope\nmakes you feel icky I want to say that\nif you're someone who said oh deep fake\npornography is not a problem when I\nshare this because this is what this is\nthe closest way that I can imagine to\ntry to equate deep fake pornography to\nlike an actual experience because this\nis a what does it do to the human mind\nto see yourself\nhaving sex with someone that you never\nagreed to have sex with I have no idea\nand neither do you\nthe experts in this are actually the\nvictims because they're the ones whose\nbrains are actually seeing this stuff\nthey're the ones who are feeling these\nfeelings and the research suggests it's\nactually pretty [ __ ] bad\nso another thing that I want to talk\nabout is people talk about\nyou know consent\nand so here's my take I'm not an\nextrovert in legal stuff I'm not an\nexpert in politics but generally\nspeaking it's my understanding that as\nhuman beings we own our likeness right\nyou can't take my face and plaster it on\nan advertisement for\nI don't know Peanut Butter Cups\nright as a human being I own my likeness\nI own my voice I am entitled to me no\none else is entitled to me and\nespecially when it comes to things like\nstreamers and stuff for celebrities we\nsort of know that right because like\npeople will pay for your likeness\nso when we talk about something like\ndeep fake pornography what we are doing\nis stealing someone's identity we're\ntaking their likeness and we're saying\nhey I'm going to use it for something\nand you don't get a say in that I'm\npretty sure that's consistently wrong\nI'm pretty sure that is aligned with our\nviews as human beings of what is okay\nand not okay and generally speaking as a\nsociety we say it's not okay to use\nsomeone's likeness without their consent\nthe next thing that I want to talk a\nlittle bit about is\nthe responses to people\nwho have been through kind of a deep\nfake and a lot of people will say like\noh you don't have to watch it or it's\nnot that bad or we'll also hear this\nwhich is like it comes with the\nterritory\nand that's also something that really\nbothers me because frankly it doesn't\ncome with the territory what comes with\nthe territory is what you sign up for\nso if there's pornographic content\nabout you on the internet and you are an\nonly Fan's Creator who makes\npornographic content that comes with the\nterritory\nstreaming on Twitch being a YouTube\npersonality being a celebrity that does\nnot equate that does not entitle people\nto make pornography about the said\nperson this is the whole point right as\nhuman beings\nwe have free will we get to choose what\nwe participate in\nand we don't sign ourselves up for all\nkinds of random crap just because we\nchoose to do one thing\nso I don't buy for a second that when\nyou were a streamer\nyou're signing yourself up and you are\ngiving people license\nto use your likeness for pornographic\nmeans I just don't buy that I think\nthat's like fundamentally like foolish\nand wrong and is not consistent with how\nwe behave as as a society we just don't\ndo that man I don't think that any\namount of privilege or money or likes or\nfame or whatever\nlike excuses people violating your\nrights like just because I'm rich which\nI'm not really but you know just because\nsomeone is Rich does not entitle you to\nsteal from them like I just don't think\nthat that's fair like that's not how we\nwork\nthe next thing that I want to talk a\nlittle bit about and this is going to\nsound kind of weird\nbut it really bothers me and scares me\nhow little Compassion or empathy there\nis for the people who are\nthe first set of victims here and we'll\nget to what I mean by that\nso when someone is like telling you hey\nthis hurts me and you say it shouldn't\nand a lot of times the people who are\nsaying it shouldn't or you deserve it or\nit comes with the territory\noftentimes those are men I don't think\nmen are evil I think men are fantastic\nhuman beings and yet when when I hear\nmen predominantly say things like this\nit really bothers me for a couple of\nreasons that maybe you haven't heard yet\nthe first is that when we're talking\nabout the damage caused by Deep fakes\nthere are absolutely victims who are\npeople like streamers or whatever\nrevenge porn non-consensual pornography\nlike it doesn't have to be a streamer\nthose per people are absolutely victims\nbut I'm actually worried about the\npeople who are consuming deep fake\npornography I am concerned for their\nhealth and well-being and I think a lot\nof the problems that those people face\ndeep fake pornography is not helping so\nlet me just give you all an example okay\njust let me just think out loud about\nthis\nso right now\nif you're a man and you're alone\nthere's something really special about\ncontent creators and relationships with\ncontent creators there's this thing\ncalled the parasocial relationship and I\nthink the internet has kind of stumbled\ninto this with influencers where we have\nthese parts of our brain that make us\nfeel connected to other human beings and\nif we look at what makes us feel\nconnected to another human being it's\nall kinds of stuff so one thing that\nmakes us connected to another human\nbeing is hugging another human being\nwhen we hog or when we cuddle after sex\nwe get this a release of this hormone\ncalled oxytocin in our brain an oxytocin\nhelps form emotional bonds oxytocin\nanytime oxytocin is floating around we\nbond with whatever is nearby\nso it's really interesting but when a\nnewborn is breastfeeding\nthe the signal that triggers the release\nof breast milk is actually oxytocin so\nthis hormone facilitates mother child\nbonding it facilitates emotional bonding\nafter sex which quick side note if\nyou're trying to be friends with\nbenefits and you don't want to catch\nfeelings don't cuddle after because\nthat's when the oxytocin kicks in\nso this is one way in which we Bond but\nthere are other ways in which we bond\nthat have nothing to do with physical\ntouch so when we see someone be genuine\nwhen we see someone be vulnerable when\nwe see someone who has the ups and downs\nof their day that helps us form\nemotional bonds with them when someone\ninteracts with us we form emotional\nbonds with them there's a community of\npeople out there\nwho are forming bonds with influencers\nthis is one of the outcomes of the\ninternet and why is it it's because\ncelebrities in the past didn't interact\nwith you right you saw only certain\nslices very curated slices of a\ncelebrity's life you see them in the\nmovies you see them on certain like\nmedia interviews but you don't get to\nsee the day-to-day moments of life\nhow do you feel connected to another\nhuman being you feel connected when you\nsee the day-to-day moments of their life\nyou see them crying you see them happy\nyou see them sad you see them bored they\nresonate with you and we start to form\nthis Bond\nand what we're seeing is that parasocial\nrelationships are damaging not just to\nthe streamer but to the person on the\nother end because when I start to form\nthis false bond with someone else I can\nnever get what a real Bond should get me\nright that person is never they're never\ngoing to listen to my vulnerabilities\nand shortcomings the way that I'm going\nto listen to bears there's never going\nto be hugging there's never going to be\ncuddling there's never going to be\nholding hands there's never going to be\ngoing to dinner together and as I sort\nof almost become addicted to this\nparasocial relationship it becomes\nharder for me to engage in real life and\nthis becomes a vicious cycle because the\nharder it is for me to become become\nengaged in real life and this is what\nwe're seeing is there a lot of lonely\nmen out there who are forming parasocial\nrelationships lonely women as well\nthe harder it becomes for me to engage\nin real life the more dependent I become\non this a parasocial relationship to fit\nmy emotional needs and this is crushing\na generation of people because I'm\ngetting so addicted to this zombie\nrelationship it's a half relationship\nit's not a real relationship but it's\nall I've got and I can't give it up I've\nseen parasocial relationships destroy\nmarriages I've seen parasocial\nrelationships lead to in seldom I've\nseen all kinds of negative impacts\nand the Deep fake porn makes this worse\nbecause now what we've managed to do is\ncheck one more box in the parasocial\nrelationship not only do I I understand\nthis person I know this person I've seen\nthem at their highs I've seen them at\ntheir lows I've been there for them\nthey've talked to me and now I can get\nsome kind of sexual gratification in a\nsensory manner relating to this person\nand I think this is going to make the\nparasocial relationship worse\nso I'm really concerned for the people\nwho are actually consuming this content\nI'm not saying that\nthey're good people or anything like\nthat but I think it's important to\nacknowledge that and I'm not going to\nuse the word victim but I think that\nthey are damaging themselves too this\nalmost feels to me like a situation of\nlike being a smoker and secondhand smoke\nsure it's bad for the streamer involved\nbut it's actually damaging for the\nperson who's doing this kind of stuff\nand if you're someone who watches deep\nfake pornography or has these parasocial\nrelationships I want you to really like\nstop and think a little bit about what\nis this doing to you what is this doing\nto your life\nand because what I what I'm hearing is\nso much like victim blaming and like oh\nit's not their fault they should have\nthick skin like but think about yourself\nfor a second does advocating for deep\nfake pornography or watching deep fake\npornography what does that do for your\nlife I can't imagine that because you're\nwatching deep fake porno you're like\nlife is full of like fun and games and\nthings like that\nwhat it's actually doing is like taking\nadvantage of a very very core\npsychological need which by the way is\nwhy it's so [ __ ] paywalled because\npeople are desperate and they're willing\nto pay for it why are people willing to\npay for it because it's so much more\ndamn addicting than regular pornography\nwhy is it so much more damn addicting\nthan regular pornography because there's\nall of this other psychological\nrelationship parasocial crap involved\nso you all need to be careful from the\nperson who's in the Deep fake porn this\nis kind of a situation where I don't\nknow if this is a good analogy or not\nsure so this is like people are\nconsuming or like the smokers but the\npeople who are the victims and the porn\nare getting the second hand smoke from\nevery single smoker out there so it's\nlike secondhand smoke isn't that bad but\nwhen there's 10 000 people who are all\nblowing their secondhand smoke in your\nface all at once that is devastating\nthat is what leads 50 plus percent of\npeople to suicidal ideation after\nunconsensual pornography is released\nso this is like psychologically\nincredibly traumatic and I don't think\npeople quite realize\nthis is something that we haven't really\nunderstood until we started working with\ntons of streamers is that the human\nbrain is not designed to deal with\nvitriol and hatred from like a hundred\nthousand people\nthat's just not what we're made for\nwe're made to like deal with like 150 to\n300 people\nand when we scale things on the level of\nthe internet\none person watching deep fake porno may\nnot be that bad but when it becomes five\nthousand ten thousand twenty thousand\npeople all of that starts to weigh on\nthe person involved and this is exactly\nwhy non-consensual pornography is so bad\nbecause this is a case of even if you're\nnot famous it's stuff that's being\nspread or about you right and if you're\nsomeone who is like oh no this shouldn't\nbe a problem I don't understand why\npeople are complaining you think about a\nsingle time in your life and hopefully\nfor the sake of learning this has\nhappened to you where someone was\ntalking crap about you and other people\nwere hearing it and how did that make\nyou feel and now you amplify it\nliterally by ten thousand or one hundred\nthousand because that's what happens in\nscenarios like this\nwhen people Dogpile a streamer this is\nwhat the experience is like\nthe amount of hatred is just so high\nthere's one other thing that I want to\ntalk about\nwhich is\nthe problem with the lack of compassion\nfor people who are victims\nso there are a lot of people out there\nwho are saying hey like people signed up\nfor this you all deserve it it's not\nthat bad\nand in that moment if you're a dude\nwhich I'm assuming that most people who\nare saying this kind of stuff are dudes\nand my apologies if that's not fair\nin that moment you are demonstrating a\ncomplete lack of compassion and empathy\nfor another human being\nand chances are the reason that you feel\nthat way is because people have treated\nyou that way\nright so if we look at people like who\nare like in cells or like lonely coomers\non the internet\nlike a lot of y'all honestly are\nstruggling we know this because these\nare the people in our community they\ncome to our community they say help us\nget better and we do that\nright we do our level best our subreddit\nwas an absolute mess for some amount of\ntime because these people were coming in\nand a lot of people were like ban these\npeople we did not ban those people did\nwe delete comments sure did we sometimes\nban people for violating rules sure but\nwe violated that we banned people for\nviolating rules that we had set out it\nwasn't discrimination against these\npeople\nand by the way\nif there's a set of rules\nand you come and you break those rules\nand you get banned that's not censorship\nor discrimination that's you broke the\nrules so we're not gonna let you play\nthe game\nbut going back to like what really\nbothers me about this or I think what we\nneed to acknowledge is I want you to\nlike look at where your lack of\ncompassion is coming from\nwhy is it that when someone says hey\nthis hurts a lot this is what pain looks\nlike this is devastating for me why is\nit that you can't hear what they're\nsaying because chances are you have\nprobably experienced the exact same\nthing that that person is experiencing\nbecause I would bet money that if you\nare an [ __ ] towards people who are\nvictims of non-consensual pornography\nthere have been times in your life where\nyou told someone else hey I am really\nsuffering\nand everyone ignored you what did people\ntell you especially if you're a man you\ndon't deserve to suffer what are you\ncomplaining about it comes with the\n[ __ ] territory because this is what\nwe tell men who suffer you're privileged\nright\nand so what happens to us we hear this\nstuff we reach out for help we say hey\nI'm hurting and the World Turns to us\nand says screw you\nyou should be able to handle it comes\nwith the territory and we become so\nresentful\nthat when another human being gets hurt\nwe take all that resentment and we dump\nit on them\nhurt people hurt people\nright the world has treated us like [ __ ]\nso we're going to turn around and treat\nother people like [ __ ] I want you to\nreally think about whether this applies\nto you or not\nbecause this sounds really bizarre\nbut y'all are the people that should\nactually be the most understanding of\nthe victims in this scenario because\nyou're the one who's actually been there\nwhen you've been hurting and not a\nsingle person listened everyone said you\nshouldn't be feeling pain what the [ __ ]\nare you complaining about\ny'all should be the ones at the front of\nthe line supporting these people because\nyou know what it's like to have the\nentire world against you and when I see\nthis level of resentment and vitriol\ntowards people who are clearly hurting\nthere's really only one explanation in\nmy mind that rises to the surface which\nis that you've been there and no one was\nthere for you so you're so freaking\nresentful that you're gonna pay it\nforward\nand so I'd strongly encourage you to\nthink a little bit about this and think\nabout where the resentment is coming\nfrom why are you so willing to discount\nother people's experience of pain\nbecause that's what you were taught\nand to be blunt this is the kind of\nthing that becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy\nso if you're a dude who's lonely has a\nparasocial relationship can't find a\ngirlfriend who's been rejected over and\nover and over again\nwhat do you think is responsible for\nthat I know a lot of y'all want to blame\nfeminism and I'm not saying women are\nperfect\nbut an attitude that completely lacks\ncompassion and is devoid of empathy is\nthe [ __ ] reason you can't get laid\nthat's the reason just think about it\nfor a second\nit's not because women are against you\nit's because when someone else is\nsuffering how do you respond to that and\nthis is what terrifies me about the\nworld\nlike I used to be scared of climate\nchange and nuclear war but honestly it's\nstuff like this\nthis is what's going to destroy Humanity\nwe have somehow figured out the source\ncode of the human brain and people who\ndon't have your best interests at heart\nare capitalizing on that source code\nthey're taking advantage of you\nright because like why is everyone\npaying for this it's because it's like\nso freaking addictive why is it\naddictive because it takes normal\npornography and it adds a relationship\ncomponent to it but what it's giving\npeople is a half-life\nit's like a zombie relationship it's not\nreal it's damaging you and it's damaging\nthat person\nand we've got to be really careful\nbecause the rate of technological\nadvancement we're like playing with fire\nand we don't even realize it\nwe're like screwing our dopaminergic\ncircuitry like people are struggling\nsuicide rates continue to climb men are\nin crisis right now\nI saw a staggering study that over half\nof men may not be mentally ill when they\nkill themselves\nright like women don't know how to trust\nmen\nand that I don't blame them for because\nhere's the thing that you have to\nunderstand if you're a man who feels\njudged because a woman won't give you a\nchance\nthink for a second about what must have\nhappened in that woman's life\nwhere her brain is telling her we cannot\ntrust men\nand this is what's really bizarre is men\nare becoming better and better at\nDeception and the better that men get at\nDeception the more\nadaptively mistrustful women will have\nto become and that can go both ways too\nright so when men become more\nemotionally manipulative which is what a\nlot of these like manosphere like red\npill types will do they will teach men\nhow to become emotionally manipulative\nand what does that do as men become\nbetter emotional manipulators\nand they're like training programs that\nyou can sign up for this\nwhat women are going to have to learn\nhow to do is become distrustful and\nthat's what we see and then a bunch of\nother men are out there saying no one's\never giving me a chance\nand before blaming the woman start to\nunderstand why\nand I'm gonna I know it sounds\nabsolutely weird because I don't know if\nI'm pissing everyone off or making\neveryone happy\nbut I think we're all screwed in this\nthis is something that we're doing\ntogether we're screwing ourselves\nthis is like smoking in secondhand smoke\nthe the real tragedy here is like are\nwomen victims absolutely but like we're\nthe ones getting damaged as men too\nthis is not good for anyone involved\nin the place that honestly I think\nyou'll need to start is if you if you\nsee another human being a woman\nsuffering because I'm sort of talking\nabout men because I think there is a\ngender imbalance here\nif you see another human being suffering\nin your instinctive reaction is you\nshouldn't feel that way\nI want you to look at my face you\nshouldn't feel that way that's what\nyou're going to be feeling\nthat's resentment where does that come\nfrom why can't you be capable of\ncompassion\nand the same is true of women as well\nright if a man says hey I'm suffering my\nlife is hard\nif you discount that where is that\ncoming from that's also coming from\nresentment I can't believe this man is\ncomplaining he's privileged and I have\nbeen the recipient of male privilege or\nthe disadvantages of male privilege my\nentire life which is where that\nresentment comes from in women\ny'all I cannot stress this enough\nwe are screwed unless someone starts\nbeing nice to someone who doesn't\ndeserve it\nwe're going to keep going down this road\nand boy are we [ __ ] things are going\nto get worse\nmass shootings will continue sexual\nviolence will continue at some point\nwe're going to see a female Mass shooter\nmark my words\nthat's a divide that we're getting\ncloser and closer to Crossing\nwe need to like help each other we need\nto support each other because anytime I\nlook outside I don't see that one group\nof people is like yay my life is so easy\neverybody's getting crushed\nand the only way that we get through\nthis is if we work together\ncheck your impulse before you tweet at\nsomeone who you think is a POS\nright no snowflake thinks it's\nresponsible for the Avalanche\nand if you are someone who thinks that\nthe world is going to hell if you're a\nman who thinks that feminism has\ndestroyed the world or you're a woman\nwho thinks that all men are evil\nthis is what's really bizarre you are a\npiece of that equation\nright there are men out there who are\nhurting right now that as a woman you\ncan demonstrate some amount of\ncompassion\nas a man if some woman demonstrates\ncompassion and you catch feelings for\nher that is not an excuse to violate her\nboundaries\nwe both have like this is not going to\nwork unless it's an all hands on deck\nkind of thing\nso I encourage each and every one of you\nto really think about your reactions\nand in my mind it is unequivocally wrong\nto to engage in depict pornography\nright like this is like the the data is\nlike clear that it's quite damaging\nforeign"
