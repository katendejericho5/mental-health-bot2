    "transcript": "you're looking for accountability you're\nlooking for them to own it but if that\ninvolves them experiencing some amount\nof guilt which they can't handle they're\ngonna keep on playing these victim cards\nthese hardening cards these wall cards\nlike whatever they need to do to avoid\nthat guilt hello\nfacade here if you want to get control\nof your life and understand how the mind\nworks check out a DIY guide to mental\nhealth the link is in description huh I\nwant to talk to you all today about\nholding parents accountable so we all\nkind of know that like everyone's either\ngot daddy issues or mommy issues right\nwe all sort of know that like in some\nway our parents are not going to be\nperfect and they may have screwed us up\nin in some kind of way and so as we go\nthrough life we'll start to discover\nparticular things like oh actually the\nway that I raised wasn't normal wait so\nyou mean that it's actually not healthy\nto cook and clean every single day and\nplan a Thanksgiving dinner for like 15\npeople and for one person to do that I\ndid not realize that or you may discover\nthat it's it's not normal to bottle all\nof all of your emotions up and then\nthrow temper tantrums right they're\ngoing to be all kinds of things as we\ngrow up and as we learn about ourselves\nthat we sort of realize that hey\nactually like my parent has something to\ndo with this and sometimes as we\ndiscover the amount of trauma that our\nparents may have put us through what\nwe're really looking for is some kind of\nhealing or closure and frequently what\nthat means is holding our parents\naccountable but when we try to do that\nit doesn't seem to work out well right\nso on the one hand sometimes what\nparents will do is they'll be really\nslippery they'll be like what are you\ntalking about nah like that's completely\nnormal like that's you know I didn't I\ndidn't there's nothing wrong with what I\ndid sometimes I'll even deny it happen\nthey'll be like no no I wasn't like that\nI was there for you every single day I\nput food on the table I did this I did\nthis sometimes they'll justify things\nright they won't necessarily disagree or\ndeny it but they'll say that they kind\nof did the best that they could which is\nsort of like interesting right because\nif someone says I did the best that I\ncould they're sort of excusing it right\nthey're sort of saying like hey like\nit's in the past I didn't know any\nbetter I'm kind of sorry about that and\nit doesn't feel like you're actually\ngetting healing or closure or\naccountability I did the best that I\ncould and sometimes what they'll even do\nis apologize and they'll say yeah I'm so\nsorry yeah I'm so sorry for that there's\nit's in the past there's nothing I can\ndo to change it so you know I'm sorry\nthat's what you needed to hear right so\nI said I'm sorry aren't you aren't you\ngood now aren't we aren't we fine like\nyou said I did this thing I said I'm\nsorry so it's in the past it's behind us\nso we're like done right so like right\nisn't isn't that what you need and\nsometimes they'll even apologize but the\napology feels like flat and sometimes\nthey'll even use this one there's a very\nincreasingly common I'm sorry that you\nfeel that way well hold on a second does\nthat mean you actually screwed up or\ndidn't screw up or what no no I'm sorry\nthat you feel that way I'm sorry that\nyour feelings are are bent out of shape\nlike I'm sorry that your feelings it's\nyour feeling I didn't I'm not I'm not\nsorry for anything I did\noh okay no no no no no no I'm sorry that\nyou feel that way I'm sorry that you\nmisinterpreted this whole situation and\ndidn't understand the sacrifices I made\nfor you and all this other kind of crap\nand that you're bent out of shape even\nthough I I did a great job as a parent\nand I gave you everything you should ask\nfor I don't understand why you could\npossibly be upset\noh that's right my child is upset with\nme and these like Millennial kids these\ngen zers they need parents to apologize\nso I'm sorry that you feel that way I'm\nsupposed to talk about feelings right so\nI'm going to toss that in there but I'm\nnot actually going to take any\naccountability for what I did as a\nparent that's what we're actually faced\nwith and so what do we do about this\nright how do we actually get some kind\nof accountability from our parents so\nthis is kind of bizarre but what we\nactually have to do is start by being a\nlittle bit empathic so what I mean by\nempathy is not we're gonna give them a\npass what really empathy means is to be\nable to understand or feel what someone\nelse is feeling so if we want to\nunderstand how to hold our parents\naccountable we have to understand their\nexperience of things first okay so let's\nstart with this imagine that you are a\nparent and your child comes to you and\nsays parent I as child have these\nstruggles because you taught me this\nlesson which has screwed up my life in a\nparticular way now as a parent what do\nyou think the child is looking for right\nlike it's kind of weird hey the last\nfive relationships I've I've gotten\ndumped because of a particular\nrelationship pattern that I saw you and\nDad or Mom like the two of y'all were\ndoing and I learned that pattern I\ninternalized that pattern it's caused me\nproblems in life child comes to you\nimagine you're the parent what are you\nsupposed to do in that situation you\ncan't really go back and fix it maybe\nyou want to apologize you'll say I'm\nsorry but like what is the child really\nlooking for are they looking for you to\nlike rewrite history because you can't\ndo that are they looking for you to\nchange like what are they actually\nlooking for one of the things that you\ncan do as a child to increase your\nsuccessive accountability is make it\nclear what you are looking for right so\nare you looking for an apology are you\nlooking for understanding are you\nlooking for help are you looking for\nthem to pay for therapy are you looking\nfor a conversation are you looking for\nthem to listen to you because frequently\nwhat happens is that when you present\nyour your parent with something like\nthis they get so damn defensive that\nthey can't even hear what you're saying\nand all you really need for them is to\nlisten because you know it's in the past\nyou're not expecting them to invent a\ntime traveling machine go back and fix\nit so I know it sounds kind of weird but\nif you really put yourself in your your\nparents shoes one of the biggest\nmistakes that I see kids make when they\ntry to hold their parents accountable is\nthat they themselves are not able to\narticulate what accountability means so\nthe first thing that you should do is\nkind of sit down and really think about\nwhat are you looking for are you looking\nfor them to understand are you looking\nfor an apology are you looking for help\nyou know what are you actually looking\nfor and really articulate that to\nyourself so that you can articulate it\nto your parent and let's kind of think\nabout this in a non-parent child\nsituation like let's talk about work for\na second so if someone comes to you and\nsays hey you're screwing up at work and\nthen you say okay what in what way what\nshould I do about it like that kind of\ncriticism isn't actually helpful unless\nit's constructive and what is\nconstructive mean that means that when\nsomeone comes to you and and points out\nsomething that you're doing wrong that\nyou're actually like they also point out\nlike some kind of corrective action now\nin some way this is unfair on the kid\nbecause the whole point of the\nparent-child relationship is that the\nchild should not be responsible for\nparenting the parent and telling them\nhow to do better right that's actually\nthe parents responsibility and the truth\nof the matter is that's just unfair to\ny'all but this is unfortunately what it\nsort of means to have a parent-child\nrelationship is that on on some level\nyou're going to have to accept some\nresponsibility for guiding them and\nsharing with them what you're looking\nfor so even if you successfully do that\nthere's another problem that arises so\nnow we're going to move on to point\nnumber two which is that you really need\nto think and understand how your parents\nhandle guilt and this is what really\ndrives a lot of kids up the wall is that\nwe don't really think about this even if\nwe decide what we're looking for as an\napology I want apology and please help\nme pay for therapy or I want you to\napologize and I want you to come with me\nto family therapy or whatever let's say\nyou figure out what you want and then\nyou approach your your parent and this\nis where we have to honestly like put\nour sociopaths hat on a little little\nbit this goes One Step Beyond empathy\nand really trying to think about okay\nhow does my parent handle guilt because\nif my parents is bad at handling guilt\nlike that conversation is not going to\ngo well so if you go up to your parent\nand you say Hey you kind of messed up in\nthis way and I've had to struggle with\nthis if the parent feels guilty and they\ndon't handle that guilt in a positive\nway you're going to see all kinds of\nnegative behaviors emerge so parents\nwill at the beginning they could deny it\nright they could say like oh like you\nknow that didn't really happen and why\nare they denying it it's because if it\ndidn't happen that I don't need to be\nfeel guilty the second thing that they\ncan kind of do so sometimes to avoid the\nguilt what they're gonna actually do is\ndeny the premise oh it didn't really\nhappen that way another thing that they\ncan do so sometimes what they can do\nwhen they start to feel guilty because\nyou're criticizing them is deny the\npremise it didn't really happen that way\nyou're not remembering properly like\nwhatever whatever right because if\nnothing bad happened then I don't need\nto feel guilty and it's actually your\nproblem which is so damn frustrating as\na kid the second thing that they can can\nactually do it just a little bit more\nInsidious sometimes they can actually\nplay the victim and if your parent is\nnot really good at handling guilt or\naccountability this is like oftentimes a\ntrump card that they will use and\nthey'll sort of play the victim so\neither they'll turn it back on you you\nwere such a difficult child or something\nlike that which is incredibly toxic or\nwhat they'll do is absolve themselves of\nresponsibility due to circumstances and\nthis is where the I did the best that I\ncould oh you know it was hard time and\nthis happened and this happened and this\nhappened which can actually be true and\nthere is some perspective to that but if\nyou really look at it that's very\nemotionally unsatisfying right because\nsometimes we're playing the victim\nactually does even if there's some truth\nto the circumstances when they play that\ncard what they're ignoring is what what\ncontrol they did have so let's say that\nyour parent the economy was bad and they\ndid have to work extra long shifts\nthat's totally fine so you can give them\na pass on that but oftentimes what\nparents will do if they have trouble\nwith guilt is they'll use the victim\nguard to absolve themselves of all\nresponsibility so even though you had to\nwork extra long shift so you had to work\ntwo jobs that doesn't excuse why you\ndidn't show up for my birthday or why\nyou went to the bar every opportunity\nthat you got or any manner of other\nthings so this is something that you\nhave to be really careful about is that\nthere may be some truth there but\nsometimes parents who don't know how to\nget handle guilt will play the victim\ncard they'll talk about circumstances I\ndid the best that I could and thereby\nwhat they'll sort of do is absolve\nthemselves of all responsibility not\njust the excusable responsibility\nanother thing that can happen when the\nparents feel really guilty is that they\ncan kind of harden up so instead of\nactually engaging you with conversation\nthey'll kind of become really flat\nthey'll be like yeah you're right I'm\nsorry I did the best that I could you're\nright I'm a bad parent I'm so sorry I'm\nso sorry I'm so sorry so they kind of\nHarden they don't really know how to\nengage with you and if you kind of think\nabout it what's happening there is they\ncan't tolerate the guilt so what they're\ngoing to do is they're just gonna like\nI'm gonna put up a wall\nthe wall is going to be here and I'm not\ngoing to feel that guilt I will give you\nwhat you want what do you want apology\nhere it is totally fine take it take the\napology now it's done right I don't need\nthe wall anymore we're past it I don't\nneed to feel the guilt so it's kind of\ninteresting because sometimes what\nhappens with kids is it's very\nfrustrating because if your parents put\nup a wall and they don't actually engage\nwith their guilt what that sort of means\nis that the apology that you get is cold\nand remorseless they don't actually feel\nthe remorse because the remorse is so\nuncomfortable which in turn makes their\napology feel kind of fake so this is the\nthird thing that parents can do so what\ndoes this mean for you as a child I\nthink it's kind of unfair but you really\nhave to think about what does your\nparent do because if what you're looking\nfor is closure and you put them in a\nsituation where they can't handle the\nguilt you're just gonna get frustrated\nand they're just gonna get frustrated\nbecause you're looking for remorse\nyou're looking for accountability you're\nlooking for them to own it but if that\ninvolves them experiencing some amount\nof guilt which they can't handle they're\ngonna keep on playing these victim cards\nthese hardening cards these wall cards\nlike whatever they need to do to avoid\nthat guilt so as a as a kid I think it's\nkind of frustrating but like you really\nhave to think a little bit about this\nand more to prevent your own frustration\nwhich kind of gets us to the next point\nwhich is to really acknowledge that as a\nhuman being you can't really ever hold\nanother human being accountable so if\nyou're like a court of law like sure you\ncan hold a human being accountable but\nwithin a relationship you can't force\naccountability on another person and\nthis is what's so difficult about\ndealing with parents is that we want\naccountability from them but that\naccountability really they have to pick\nup we can set boundaries we can punish\nthem we can limit contact we can go low\ncontact or no contact or all these kinds\nof things but that also is not enforcing\naccountability on someone that's just\nwhat you control right so that's okay\nbut for you to really think about and\nunderstand that in order for you to\nreally get the closure that you want\nthey are going going to need to hold the\naccountability they're going to need to\npick it up themselves and so this is why\nwe talk a little bit about how to smooth\nthings along to encourage accountability\non your parents part so the first thing\nonce again is to articulate what exactly\nyou're looking for from your parent for\nyou to understand what you're looking\nfor and sometimes you can even make a\nreally interesting discovery which is\nwhat you're actually looking for is\nsomething that is impossible for them to\nprovide sometimes as children what we're\nactually looking for where we are\nemotionally is we actually want them to\ngo back in time and erase this part of\nour Lives we don't want to live the life\nthat we are living in now we don't want\nto live with the consequences of their\nactions and I know it sounds kind of\nbizarre but even if what you're looking\nfor from them is impossible if you\nvocalize that and they hear that and\nboth of y'all can agree man this really\nscrewed you up and it sounds like it's\nvery very very difficult for you to like\nlive life and a healthy way because of\nmy actions or because of this upbringing\nand I wish I could actually go back in\ntime and change it and it sounds like\nthat's actually what you need to to be\nfixed is to go back in time I don't know\nhow to do that and then this is where\nyou as a child you can kind of own that\nas well and you can say I don't know how\nyou can do that either and then you can\nactually get some kind of healing\nclosure this is why it starts with you\nreally understanding and articulating to\nthem what you're looking for it also\nrequires some amount of understanding\nhow they react to guilt and so you know\nwhat to anticipate in terms of their\nreactions because oftentimes what what\nkids will do is once they have that\nreaction once the parent has that\nreaction the kid feels frustrated and\nthen we bludgeon them right as they\nHarden and they give us a cold apology\nwe don't actually feel satisfied so we\nescalate as we escalate no like that's\nnot enough you don't understand we'll\nsay these kinds of things they feel\nguiltier as they feel guiltier they put\nup the walls more as they put up the\nwall walls more they apologize harder\nand with less remorse cold apology\ncolder apology coldest apology and then\nthe cycle repeats which is why this is\nso frustrating so at the end which\nyou've got to really realize is that\nsome of this has to come from them you\ncan try to smooth the path as you as\nmuch as you want you can try to make\nthings easy for them you can try to\navoid pitfalls but at some point you\nactually have to give them the\nresponsibility you have to make your\ncase then you have to say look mom or\ndad this is the best that I can do I\nneed you to kind of step up and help me\nmake this right I need you to kind of\nfigure out and help us we need to work\non this together so this is the way that\nI feel this is what my experience was\nI'm happy to listen to your recollection\nof the events but this doesn't feel\ncomplete to me and if the parent is like\nwhat do you want me to do what do you\nwant me to do what do you want me to do\nit's good for you to articulate but it's\nnot your job to 100 figure out what\nthey're supposed to do to make things\nright because sometimes what we'll do is\nwe'll tell them I need you to to do a b\nand c and they'll do a b and c but they\nwon't do it with the right kind of\nfeeling they won't actually apologize\nwith a remorse so it feels unsatisfying\nto us so you can't really hold someone\nelse accountable and the third thing\nthat I kind of say is encourage them to\ntake responsibility say hey I don't know\nexactly what I want you to do I need you\nto help me figure out how to move\nforward from here I need your help with\nthis because this is a relationship\nunfortunately even if you do these three\nthings it may not necessarily work and\nhonestly a lot of this stuff is really\nunfair to kids but I've worked with a\nlot of parents I've worked with a lot of\nkids I've also have my own relationship\nwith my parents and my own relationship\nwith my kids I have friends and family\nwho I've helped in this way and\nunfortunately\nit's not fair that you need to do this\nbut if you're looking for accountability\nfrom your parents I think this seems to\nbe the best way to actually get it this\noptimizes your chances of success by\nbeing very clear about what you're\nlooking for by really anticipating what\nare the pitfalls that will prevent my\nparent from engaging in this\nconversation how can I sort of\nunderstand their guilt and understand\nwhat to expect and maybe not try in that\nway and the last thing is that\nultimately accountability from your\nparents is not forced by you it's not\nlike you have all the power and you're\nforcing accountability it's actually a\nshared relationship where they need to\naccept responsibility and in order for\nthem to accept responsibility you have\nto give them the space to accept\nresponsibility instead of forcing it on\nthem because if you're forcing it you're\nreally the one that's responsible if\nthat kind of makes sense so I know it's\nreally challenging but I really hope\nthat this kind of mechanism or this\nParadigm will help you Foster a\nhealthier sense of closure or healing\nwith your parents"
