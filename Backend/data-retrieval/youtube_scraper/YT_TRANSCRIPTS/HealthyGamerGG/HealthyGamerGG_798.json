    "transcript": "we think about negative emotions as bad\nthings because they're so powerful right\nfear and anxiety are so crippling I\ncan't even leave the house because I'm\nanxious but we don't realize is we\nfrequently will manipulate ourselves\ninto harnessing negative emotions for\nour benefit right so we'll tell people\noh yeah I'm gonna go to the gym because\nif I don't go then I'll feel guilty so\nwe've figured out how to trick ourselves\ninto doing what we want to do harnessing\nnegative emotions and it works so I'm\nnot saying don't abandon it what I'm\nsaying is that it's not a good long-term\nsolution because then ultimately what\nyou're going to end up doing is it's\nlike your productivity is tied to\nsuffering and that's unhealthy is it\ngoing to lead to success sure but it's\nunhealthy and the key thing is that\nthere is another way but we never\nexplore that way because this one is so\ngood why does everyone procrastinate\nit's not because procrastination is a\nproblem it's because it's a solution"
