    "transcript": "this is what's sort of interesting about\ngrowing up being Indian you know I come\nfrom a culture where arranged marriages\nhappen and the thing about arranged\nmarriages is you don't get to pick the\nperfect person you you sort of try your\nfamily sort of tries but there's this\nattitude of like making the decision\nwork this is the difference between an\nindecisive person and a decisive person\nis that the indecisive person tries to\npick the right choice and the decisive\nperson makes whatever choice they pick\nwork it's this idea that whatever you\nchoose you can kind of make it work it's\nwhat you do after the decision that's\nreally important and this is precisely\nwhy they don't end up sort of in bad\nplaces right when a decisive person\nmakes a decision it doesn't look like a\nmistake and why doesn't it look like a\nmistake because it's not because they\nmade the right choice it's because what\nthey did after the choice that\ndecisiveness actually affects the\noutcome the outcome is not dictated by\nthe choice it's dictated by what you do\nafter you make the choice"
