    "transcript": "the majority of people who become\ntherapists to fix something in their own\nlife Almost Do themselves a disservice\nand can sometimes even do a disservice\nto their patients there are many people\nthat will tell you this is secret to\nhappiness that is sacred to happiness\nbut if you want to know how to live the\nlife you must understand how your mind\nworks only so check out Dr K guide link\nis in description huh sometimes people\ntell us we'd make great therapists we're\nthat friend who always listens with that\nfriend who really is there for people we\nwill drop everything that we're doing to\nsupport someone in need and we're very\ngood listeners we're like really into\npsychology they're all these different\nthings about us that sometimes make us\nfeel or other people will tell us that\nwe're gifted and we're naturally suited\nto become therapists the big challenge\nis that unless you're careful the very\nthings that may make you a gifted\ntherapist can actually cause you to\nbecome a terrible therapist those same\nthings that can make you a good friend\ncan actually lead to you having lots of\nproblems as a therapist so I'd love to\nshare with you all today is five very\ncommon kind of pitfalls or problems that\nI see with people who seem to be well\nsuited to be therapists which will\nactually sort of cause them more\nproblems as they proceed into the\nprofession so the first thing that I\nwant to talk about is people who derive\na lot of value out of helping other\npeople so some of us have this kind of\nidentity of being a helper right like\nI'm a good person and part of what makes\nme a good person part of what makes me a\nvaluable friend is that I'm there for\nother people when other people are\nhaving a crisis I'm kind of there for\nthem I'm listening to them I help them\nget through it this is what makes me a\nreally valuable friend and if this makes\nme a valuable friend certainly it'll\nmake me a good therapist right the\ntricky thing is that if we derive our\nsense of identity or our sense of value\nfrom doing good for other people that\ncan actually be somewhat of a pitfall if\nyou're a therapist now you may be\nthinking wait how on Earth does that\nwork because is the whole point of\ntherapy that it's a profession where you\nget to help other people and if I'm\nsomeone who's a helper am I not\nnaturally suited to be in a profession\nwhere I'm a helper you may think so but\nlet's kind of look at it this way so if\nyou're a Helper and that's who you are\nright and you help other people because\nyou're like yeah I'm a good person I do\ngood in the world that becomes a part of\nyour identity what happens if you have\nan unsatisfied patient so if you have a\npatient who says hey you're not helping\nme or you're making things worse or they\ndon't return your phone calls or they\nghost you after the first appointment\nhow does that make you feel about\nyourself what if they start seeing a\ndifferent therapist or what if they\nstart telling you oh yeah this isn't\nreally working for me I want to work\nwith some friend of yours or what if\nthey start quoting Dr K in your therapy\nsession oh my goodness they started\nwatching this guy on the internet and\nthey're learning so much from him how\nwould you feel as a therapist how would\nyou be able to handle that if your\nidentity is that of a Helper because\nsometimes we'll run into patience like\nthis there's a great paper called the\nhateful patient in which there's a\npsychiatrist a guy named Jim Groves who\ntalks about certain patients who\nconstantly need help and what they'll do\nis their their help Seekers help\nrejecters and so what they'll do is\nthey'll ask for your help but whatever\nsuggestions you get give them they'll\nactually discard oh that won't work for\nme all right yeah that that may work for\nother people but it's not going to work\nfor me you may know people like this in\nreal life who are always needing help\nand always rejecting it right and the\nmore you do the less that helps so\nyou've got to be really careful because\nbeing a therapist is about being secure\nin your own identity irrespective of the\npatient's response if you your sense of\nvalue comes from helping other people\nwhat that also means is that as a\ntherapist if someone doesn't feel helped\nby you your own sense of identity will\nfeel threatened and as your own sense of\nidentity is based on how the patient\nreacts that's going to open you up to\nall kinds of manipulation or even things\nlike burnout because now when someone\nisn't getting helped you're a helper\nright I am a helper I'm the one who\nhelps so you want to try harder and try\nharder and try harder because you've got\nto help them because that's who you are\nyou're a helper that's number one number\ntwo kind of related to that is that you\nhave poor boundaries so when I derive\nmyself sense of identity out of helping\nother people I feel really good about\nmyself so I remember this happened to me\nwhen I was younger where a friend of\nmine called and was in crisis and I\nspent the whole night talking to that\nfriend and I helped them through the\ncrisis and Dawn came up the next day and\nI felt so good about myself they were so\nappreciative man like we did some real\ngood work today it was great right and I\nwas tired the whole day I got to sleep\nan hour or two and I had family over for\nthe holidays at the time and I was kind\nof a zombie the next day and then\nsometimes people are calling me and\nthey're like hey I really need your help\nand you drop whatever you're doing to\nhelp them sometimes we have family\nmembers who have conditioned us to\nbehave like this and we're kind of the\nemotional sponge for the family so if\nyou've got poor boundaries you've got to\nbe super careful because that may feel\nreally gratifying because even making a\nsacrifice for the sake of someone else\nmakes you feel really good about\nyourself right so we're willing to\ncompromise our own boundaries because of\nthe importance of it really helping\nanother human being so to hell with my\nboundaries because I'm doing good work\nhere and that works totally fine it can\neven be toxic and lead to burnout even\nif you're a friend that works fine when\nyou've got like two to five people who\nare emotionally supportive for you on\nyou but what if you've got a panel of 60\npatients what are you going to do then\nwhat if they call you at 9pm hey I just\nneed to talk what are you gonna say no\nsorry I'm busy think about it right so\nkey part of what makes someone a very\nvery valuable therapist friend or friend\nwho's emotionally supportive can\nactually get you into trouble if you\nbecome a therapist and once again what\nyou're going to have to do is do a lot\nof unlearning because your instinct in\nthat moment is going to be to help that\nperson but if you help that person\nyou're gonna be headlong into burnout\nand compassion fatigue third thing to\nconsider sometimes people are interested\nin becoming therapists because they love\npsychology and this is fantastic I think\nit's wonderful if you like ecology and\nmaybe you should consider being a\ntherapist but remember that part of\ntherapy training is not just studying\nthe parts of psychology that you like\nand this is the thing that I've noticed\nabout a lot of people who are fascinated\nwith psychology is they're really only\nfascinated by whatever they're\nimpulsively driven to so I may be\nfascinated by watching like YouTube\nvideos that have a ton of views on\npsychology because that's entertaining\nbut it's not like I'm reading textbooks\nabout psychology so you've got to be\nsuper careful because even if you're\ninterested in Psychology that doesn't\nnecessarily mean that you're going to be\na good therapist or that you'll even\nenjoy being a therapist for the first\nthing you have to consider is that you\nhave to learn of psychol a lot of\npsychology that may not be naturally\nappealing to you and while some of it\nmay be appealing to you and that's great\nyou have to learn a bunch of other stuff\nand I've seen this actually like kind of\nthe downside of this is when therapists\nbecome enamored with a particular kind\nof psychological approach they can\nactually do their patients a disservice\nso I once had a colleague who was\nconvinced that all of the men that they\nworked with were closeted homosexuals\nand they were so enamored with this\ntheory of like you know know that ninety\npercent of human beings are bisexual\nthat they were like this was so exciting\nto them and they'd read so much about it\nand then the patient walks in and then\nsecretly like the therapist in the back\nof their mind is like trying to think\nabout okay how can I understand this\nperson's like deep homosexual repression\nand so the key thing that you you have\nto remember if you're a therapist is\nit's not about what you find interesting\nit's about what helps the patient and\nsometimes our own desires can actually\nget in the way of that so even if you're\ninterested in a particular branch of\npsychology you may study that psychology\nand that may be really fantastic I know\nI've certainly struggled with this as\nwell so I'm really into complementary\nalternative medicine and meditation and\nmindfulness and sometimes I've actually\ndone my patients a disservice by sort of\nsuggesting it over and over and over\nagain thankfully I learned my lesson to\nwhere now I'm sort of like hey you can\ndo it if you want to but if you don't\nwant to that's totally fine here's what\nelse I can offer you so a big part of\nbeing a therapist is not about the\npsychology that you're interested in\nit's about the psychology that a patient\nneeds fourth thing to consider is that\ntherapy can can seem really fun and\nexciting even like maybe you've been\nhelped by a therapist and there's like\nyou know you've had like some really\ndeep sessions and that's great maybe\ny'all are familiar with some of our\ncontent and things like that and that\nsounds kind of like exciting and\nchallenging to help people and do\nsomething good in the world and all that\nkind of good stuff there's so many\ninteresting theories that you can learn\nright so that's all like very exciting\npeople don't realize about being a\ntherapist is that a lot of it is like\nreally small administrative stuff so if\nyou suck at like turning things in on\ntime administrative stuff paperwork and\nall that kind of stuff I don't know if\nyou actually want to be a therapist\nbecause what you don't see even when you\ngo see a therapist is all the stuff that\nthey do before and after the visit to\njust to give you all an example\nscheduling right rescheduling\nappointments doing billing doing\ncharting filling out medical records\ndoing diagnoses talking with insurance\ncompanies at least here in the United\nStates there's all this stuff around\nrvus and meeting productivity\nrequirements and keep in mind since you\nare a therapist and since you're\nactually dealing with patients this\nstuff is actually even more important\nand they're more strict about it because\nwe're dealing with people who are\nvulnerable we're dealing with people who\nhave mental health diagnoses right\npsychiatric illnesses so your\ndocumentation has to be spot on you have\nto make sure you're compliant with all\nthe Privacy regulations so you've got to\nbe really careful about sending emails\nand texting and all that kind of stuff\nit's all patient information right so\nyou can love all the other parts of\npsychology and I think it's great I'm\nnot saying that you shouldn't go into\ntherapy I'm just saying if you're\nthinking about being a therapist and you\nsuck at administrative paperwork either\nyou're going to run into trouble you're\ngoing to get sued or you're going to\nhave to get really good at it right\nbecause I can guarantee you if you're\nnot good at scheduling patients and two\npatients show up or you are taking a day\noff and you let three of your patients\nknow but that fourth patient their\nmailbox was full so you couldn't leave a\nvoice message so you called and they had\nno idea and they show up to your office\non a day that you're on vacation that's\ngoing to be a mess so be careful about\nthe administrative work that's Point\nnumber four and the last thing to\nconsider and this is something can I see\nfar too often is that a lot of people\nare interested in becoming therapists\nbecause they themselves have suffered\nand it sort of makes sense and this can\nactually work really well like your\ninspiration for wanting to become a\ntherapist and helping other people are\nyour own sufferings and that can be\nreally good inspiration don't get me\nwrong so great example of this is Dr\nMarshall Linehan so this is a\npsychologist who suffered from\nborderline personality disorder she's\nbeen pretty vocal about her journey and\nso she like became a psychologist\nlearned all the best techniques for\nborderline personality disorder and\nfound that none of them worked well\nenough and so then she started studying\nmindfulness and she discovered wow like\nthis stuff really helps me and seems to\nlike supplement everything that I've\nlearned in therapy and things like that\nit seems like something's really missing\nfrom therapy and that's mindfulness and\nso she learned mindfulness got a lot\nbetter herself and then Incorporated\nmindfulness into Psychotherapy developed\nsomething called dialectical behavioral\ntherapy which is now one of the leading\nevidence-based treatments for the\ndiagnosis that she has borderline\npersonality disorder and so there can be\nreally good reasons or good outcomes if\nyou suffer yourself to become a\ntherapist and maybe you can enhance the\nfield and you can be like Marshall in\nhand but you got to be\nbecoming a therapist isn't about you\nit's not about your struggles or your\nsuffering it's about the patient right\nand if we're going to sort of learn a\nlittle bit about ourselves and this is\nwhere things can get really tricky\nbecause a lot of times if we struggle\nourselves we don't want to be the\npatient right like it's kind of\ndemeaning like I'm not the person who\nneeds help I'm going to be the helper\nI'm going to learn about this myself I'm\nnot going to take anyone else's help I'm\ngoing to go become a psychologist I'm\ngoing to study this stuff for five years\nI'm going to become an expert in my own\ndiagnosis I'm going to understand it in\nand out and then I will be able to help\nmyself then I'll never need to be a\npatient because I've struggled with this\nand I'm going to conquer it and so a lot\nof times what we end up doing is\nbecoming therapists in order to conquer\nour own internal struggles and like I\nsaid Dr linehan's case is a really good\nexample of how this can work but to be\nhonest with you there are a couple of\nhuge problems with that the first is\nthat it's way more cost effective and\ntime efficient to actually be the\npatient if you have a problem in your\nown life actually get it fixed you don't\nhave to pick a profession or a career to\nfix an internal problem that you have or\neven a diagnosis that you have the\nsecond issue and this is more subtle is\nthat if you sort of aren't willing to\nbecome a patient think a little bit\nabout why that is what do you think\nabout patients what kind of judgment do\nyou have about patients and as you are\nvery driven right you're going to go and\nstudy at a very reputable institution\nyou're going to become the best\ntherapist to treat this condition\nbecause it's what you suffer with why\ndon't you become a patient like because\nyou think patients are kind of icky\nright that's what you think that's why\nyou can't be a patient yourself and so\nas you lean into the idea that you're\ngoing to conquer this and you're not\ngoing to be weak you're going to be\nstrong you're going to study you carry\nthat with you then what kind of\ntherapist are you going to be if you\ncarry around the idea that patients are\nweak and so it can be so devastating\nbecause oftentimes if we struggle\nourselves the last thing that we want to\ndo is be a patient we want to get\ncontrol of the issue we want to conquer\nthe issue we don't want to be the victim\nwe don't want to be the patient we want\nto be the Conqueror we want to be the\ndoctor we want to be the one who's got\npower and is in charge but as we give in\nto all of those things and select a\ncareer based on it we may actually be\nsetting ourselves up to miss one of the\nmost fundamental things that you need to\ndevelop as a therapist which is\ncompassion for the patient position\ncompassion and non-judgmentalness for\nsomeone for having mental illness in the\nfirst place this is where you say okay\nDr k then what do I do about it right\nwhat you have to do is let go of the\nidea that being a patient is weak and\nyou're like okay cool Dr K I'm gonna go\nahead and do that and that's when I tell\nyou okay if you want to do that the\nright way to do that is to be a patient\nright go to therapy work with someone\nwho can help you resolve your own\ndifficulties and your own shortcomings\nand your own feelings of weakness and\nthen paradoxically you'll be far better\nsuited to become a therapist but just to\nsummarize a lot of us are really excited\nabout the ideas of becoming therapists\nright because we're interested in\nPsychology we want to help people and by\nthe way we're talented at it right we're\ngifted people tell us so everyone's like\nman you're such a good listener man like\nyou're always there for me and we derive\na lot of sense of Pride and identity\nsometimes we even struggle with our own\nproblems I've struggled with depression\nso I'm going to become a therapist and\nall those things all of these things can\nbe good don't get me wrong like an\ninterest in Psychology is definitely\ngood for therapy if you want to become a\ntherapist\ncaring about other people definitely\ngood for becoming a therapist but\nparadoxically a lot of the things that\nmay make us\nthink we're suited towards therapy can\nactually set us up to run into all kinds\nof problems all kinds of pitfalls as\ntherapists so a couple of things to\nthink about first your sense of identity\nso is your self-worth dependent on\nhelping other people because what that\nsort of means is it opens you up to\nmanipulation because if a patient learns\nif I express discomfort towards my\ntherapist they'll like become an\nabsolute doormat right give me more ADHD\nmeds you're doing such a terrible job I\nneed a referral on my Adderall\ngive me that Adderall then I'll tell you\nyou're doing a good job number two kind\nof related to that is you gotta have\ngood boundaries because remember the\npatients that you're going to be dealing\nwith if you're a therapists are going to\nhave emotional needs like that's the\nwhole point is that they're they are\ndepressed or they are potentially\nbipolar or they do have borderline\npersonality disorder or they do have\ndependent personality disorder or they\ndo have narcissism or they have\naddiction problems and if you're not\ncareful they will run all over your\nboundaries you need incredibly strong\nboundaries to stay healthy and avoid\ncompassion fatigue and burnout as a\ntherapist third thing to consider is an\ninterest in Psychology because if you're\nnot careful what you'll do as a\ntherapist is get so far into a\nparticular range of psychology that\nyou'll start leaning into what you find\nfascinating instead of what is helpful\nto the patient fourth thing and I hate\nto say this but if you want to be a\nsuccessful therapist you have to be\nreally good at crappy administrative\nwork so much of a therapist's life is\nnote-taking billing phone calls\npaperwork licensure all that kind of\ncrap and you really have to stay on top\nof it because we're dealing with\npatients here so you really can't screw\nup the last thing to consider is that\nsome of us choose to become therapists\nbecause of our own personal struggles\nand while that can end up really well\nhonestly in my experience the majority\nof people who become therapists to fix\nsomething in their own life Almost Do\nthemselves a disservice and can\nsometimes even do a disservice to their\npatients so even if you're gifted which\nis fantastic even if you love psychology\nI'd be a little bit careful about\ndefaulting to becoming a therapist and\nif you do choose to to do that which I\nthink is a wonderful profession I\nwouldn't discourage you the real reason\nwe're sort of making this is to sort of\nshare with you some of the potential\npitfalls because if you're kind of like\ngifted at becoming a therapist you may\nparadoxically have to work harder to set\nup additional boundaries to unlearn\nparticular behaviors and to really work\non your own identity so even after\nwatching this if you've decided hey I'm\ngifted at this and I want to be a\ntherapist that's fantastic all the more\npower to you hopefully with this\nknowledge in hand you'll actually be\nable to use it for your own well-being\nas well as the well-being of your\npatients"
