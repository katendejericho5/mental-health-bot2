    "transcript": "so here's the wild thing when you don't\ntalk enough and you're in a social\nsetting no one is ever going to get that\nfeedback the person who talks too much\nis never going to realize I need to be\nquiet and if they never realize I need\nto be quiet and they don't give you the\nspace to speak up you will never speak\nup and this is the problem is that we\nassume people who don't talk a lot you\nthink it's an individual problem and I\nneed to learn how to talk more but it's\nnot an individual problem because\nspeaking is relational someone else has\na certain component to it it's not just\nyou need to speak up more other people\nneed to shut the up but there's no\nplace for people to be told that you\ncan't go into a group of friends and say\nhey I'm having trouble participating\nbecause every time someone asks a\nquestion you open your mouth you're\ntotally happy to talk if someone invites\nyou into the conversation and in fact\nwhat you're looking for is an invitation\ninto the conversation so one person\nwants to talk one person doesn't want to\ntalk it's really simple get the person\nwho talks too much to bring the other\nperson into the conversation"
