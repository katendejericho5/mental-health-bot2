    "transcript": "should I double text should I not double\ntext like what's going on do this don't\ndo this don't do this don't do this\nthere's different sets of rules for men\nor women there's different sets of rules\nfor work or friends there's all these\ndifferent rules and the problem with\ntexting is that no one's following the\nsame rules there isn't one uniform set\nin fact it's the opposite right we have\ndifferent rules for different genders\nis whatever is in the link in the\ndescription check it out so today we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about texting\nand specifically I'm going to share with\nyou all one particular insight into how\nto be a better texter and the weird\nthing about texting is that everyone is\ntexting more and everyone seems to be\ngetting worse at it right because\neveryone is coming up with these rules\nlike hey man like don't don't double\ntext Bro like if you double text like if\nyou res if you send one text and she\ndoesn't respond to you then like you\nshouldn't double text that shows her\nthat like you're like too invested in\nthe relationship so you got to be like a\nlittle bit distant right on the flip\nside people are like oh yeah if he like\nif he texts you once like don't respond\nright away that's going to show you that\nlike you show them that he you're easy\nso instead you have to wait for him to\ntext a couple of times and that like\nthat shows him that like you're not like\neasy right you're not a pushover so\neveryone's coming up with these rules of\ntexting people are like as a man like\ndon't send walls of text because it's\nlike shows that you're emotionally a\nmess and so then people like to send\nreally short things and on the flip side\npeople are like okay like this person\nisn't invested at all in texting because\nthey send these monosyllabic replies and\nI'm putting in all this effort and so\neveryone out there is coming up with\nrules should I double text should I not\ndouble text like what's going on do this\ndon't do this don't do this don't do\nthis there's different sets of rules for\nmen or women there's different sets of\nrules for work or friends there's all\nthese different rules and the problem\nwith texting is that no one's following\nthe same rules there isn't one uniform\nset in fact it's the opposite right we\nhave different rules for different\ngenders and so texting has become an\nabsolute mess and people are trying to\nfigure this out and everyone's telling\nyou how to text or how not to text so\nwhat's going on here what do we do about\nthis there's one part of texting that no\none ever talks about and that is how to\nreceive texts how to read texts because\nI know this is weird I know this is\ngoing to sound kind of complicated it's\na boomer concept texting falls under the\numbrella of something called\ncommunication now communication is this\nBoomer concept about sending and\nreceiving signals there can be all kinds\nof different Communications there can be\nverbal Communications there can be\nnon-verbal Communications there can be\ntexting or written Communications back\nin the day we had this thing called the\nletter but the key thing about\ncommunication is that it goes both ways\nthere's both the sending of\ncommunications and the receiving of\ncommunications so if you want to be a\nbetter texter what we're going to talk\nabout is how to read texts okay so the\nfirst rule is what to do if a text\nupsets you so a lot of times the reason\nthat we run into trouble with texting is\nbecause we get a text and the text\nupsets Us in some some way right like\nthis person is callous or they're\nunfeeling or they say something that's\ninsulting or they didn't laugh at my\njoke or they're cold in some way like I\ndon't know they send us we receive some\nkind of text and we get upset and so\nnormally when we get upset when we\nreceive a text what do we do I'm gonna\ntext it back I can't believe you're like\nthis we start being like passive\naggressive and you're like oh if that's\nwhat you want to do and we're like I'm\ngoing to capitalize that's\nright and I'm going to teach this person\na lesson so we get upset and so the\nfirst thing that we've got to do is if\nyou get upset when you see a text the\nfirst thing you should do is don't\nrespond take a moment take a step back\nre-read the text critically look at the\ntext if you get upset don't assume that\nyou are upset for a good reason because\nyou may that may not be their intention\nat all right and this is really\nchallenging because when we get upset is\nwhen our mind actually doesn't want to\nreread anything right like we don't want\nto reread stuff when we're upset like we\ndon't want to stop and think critically\nthis sent me this text you're\ntelling me that I need to pause for a\nsecond and read re-read the mean thing\nthat they said that's not what I want to\ndo it runs completely contrary to all of\nour instincts but why should we do it\nthen right do you see the text that they\nsent me you want me to pause for a\nsecond and reread it and think\ncritically when this sent this\nwhat's wrong with you Dr K so let me\nexplain something I know it's kind of\nweird here's the problem with texting\nthat we miss a lot of information right\nso texting is in I know it's weird but\nis in the written format and then it\nleaves out things like tone body\nlanguage it leaves out a lot of emotions\nsometimes it can be hard to detect\nwhether people are sarcastic or serious\nor we will interpret them as serious\nwhen they are being sarcastic or we will\ninterpret them as sarcastic when they\nare being serious wait what you were\nserious about that and why is that it's\nbecause you can't convey emotion and so\nthen what happened\nto to fix this problem right so texting\ninventors the texting technologists\ndecided we're going to create an emoji\nbecause a picture is worth a thousand\nwords right so now we can convey things\nwith emoji and so like we went from\nhieroglyphics to the written alphabet\nbecause those are superior to\nhieroglyphics and now we've come all the\nway back to hieroglyphics in the shape\nof emojis if I ask someone hey want\neggplant question mark for dinner\ntonight is that what we're referring to\nare we referring to a delicious roasted\neggplant dip with way too much garlic\nand green onion or are we referring to\nsomething else when I ask you if you\nwant eggplant for dinner tonight so the\nfirst thing to understand is that when\nyou receive a text if you get upset\ndon't respond to it right away pause and\nthink critically start to think about\nthe different kinds of interpretations\nthat you could offer them what would be\na charitable interpretation to this text\nor I know this sounds absolutely insane\nthe other thing you could try doing is\nclarifying it's weird I know but when we\nget upset we don't want to clarify\nbecause we've read that text we know\nexactly what they meant right we could\nsee their facial expression they were\nwhen they were typing it we can hear\ntheir tone of voice we saw them laughing\nwith their friends as they were sending\nit right we know exactly what they meant\nand that's why we got upset because we\nwe interpreted it correctly so rule\nnumber one for being a batter texter if\nyou get upset pause for a second look\ncritically and reread the text okay so\nthe next thing but what if they don't\ntext me to begin with right so it's fine\nDr K you're saying okay if they text me\nand I get upset I should like reread\nmaybe think critically about it maybe\nask them for clarification but what if\nthey don't text back what then Dr K so\nhere's something else to understand\ntexting is about convenience I know that\na lot of people will like live text back\nand forth right but generally speaking\nthe whole point of a text is that you\ncan send it at any time and it can be\nread at any time and responded to it\nanytime and that may sound weird to all\nthe Gen Z kids or the Gen alpha kids out\nthere or whatever but that's really like\nif you pause and think about it we have\ntext messages right and they stay on\nyour phone for a while unless you're\nSnapchatting or whatever I don't even\nunderstand how that crap works but for\nthe most part a text message stays on\nyour phone so then what happened is we\nalso had these these weird things now\nwhere you can send a voice message right\nI can avoid I can record a voice message\nand I can send it to someone and because\nsometimes that's faster than writing out\nthe text and then what they can also do\nis record a voice message and send it to\nme and then we can do that back and\nforth and eventually we will arrive at\nthis Boomer invention called a\nconversation so if you're having a\nconversation with someone the\nexpectation is that when you say\nsomething they will respond right when\nwe're sitting there and like talking to\neach other face to face or there's this\nthis weird function that your phone has\nit's like a constant live voice message\nexchange called a phone call and if you\nuse this thing called a phone call\nthat's when you should expect an instant\nresponse the first thing to the second\nthing to understand about texting is\nthat if you're texting people and they\ndon't respond that's okay right it's\nlike if you wanted to talk to them or\nyou need an instant response don't use a\ntext right but what if I get ghosted\nwhat if they don't respond for an\nextended period of time and like like\npeople ghosts nowadays like what's up\nwith that and this also is where pause\nfor a second there is a way to interpret\nbeing ghosted so let's start with this\nhow do you know when you've been ghosted\nis it one day of no responses two days\nof no responses three days of no\nresponses four days of no responses five\ndays of no responses when are you\nghosted six months a year out I imagine\nso at that point right so how do we\ndecide when we've been ghosted what\ndetermines whether we've been ghosted\nour decision about whether we've been\nghosted or not is entirely based on our\nexpectation or our desire for when we\nwant a response I've seen people claim\nthat they have been ghosted after 24\nhours of no messages I've seen people\nget feel like they've been ghosted after\none week of no response right so when is\nthe threshold of ghosting I'm not even\nsure but but what I do know is that a\nlot of people feel ghosted based on\ntheir own internal expectations the SEC\nCenter is that even if you don't get a\nresponse for like a week or a month you\nknow sometimes like stuff happens in\npeople's lives generally speaking\nremember the point of a text message is\nthat it's kind of there and I can get\naround to it later but sometimes people\nwill I don't know like get into a\ndepressive episode for a little while or\nlike start to become a little bit manic\nfor a couple of weeks or maybe they got\ncoveted or maybe they're really busy at\nwork or maybe their their family member\nlike a family member passed away and\nthis is where you say understandably so\nright so I I know what you're going to\nsay there well they could let me know\nright if they're going to be out of\ncommission for a little while the least\nthey could do is have the courtesy to\ntell me well yeah I completely agree\nwith you so here's my question for you\nhow do you know that they didn't let you\nknow what do you mean of course they\ndidn't let me know if they let me knew I\nwould know right like if they told me I\nwould know well hold on a second how\ncarefully are you reading their texts\nright so this is insane sometimes people\nwill and you you may know this if you've\nbeen on the risk like on the sending end\nwell you'll kind of let someone know\nyou're like hey I'm going to be busy\nwith work for the next couple of weeks\nyou gotta let them know and then like\nfour days later they're like hey like\nwhy haven't you texted me back right so\nlike it's because people don't read\ntexts\nmaybe they let you know could they have\nknown let you know a little bit more\nclearly sure right but maybe they even\ndid let you know so I know it sounds\nkind of weird but even ghosting is\nsomething that you've got to be really\ncareful about that I think a lot of\nghosting has to do with your\ninterpretations are you actually reading\ntheir texts properly what are the\nreasons that they haven't responded to\nyou there could be all kinds of stuff\nand the point of the matter is that we\ndon't know the last thing to consider\nabout being a good texter is to\nultimately understand that you can't\ncontrol someone else's Behavior and the\nchallenge with a lot of these rules is\nthey're actually geared not to like help\nyou feel better about yourself but to\ngear to elicit a particular kind of\nbehavior right so if we kind of think\nabout it a lot of the texting stuff is\nabout getting other people to respond so\nif I if my response is too short if I\njust say hey and they say hey and then I\nsay hey and they say hey and I say\nwhat's up and they say not much you and\nthen I say what's up not much what you\nup to not much hey hey hey so if we have\nthat kind of text exchange I decided to\nalter my behavior right so I'm going to\nsend a longer message and what am I\ndoing when I send the longer message I'm\ntrying to elicit a particular kind of\nresponse so if I send if I double text\nor triple text or quadruple text people\nwill think I am pathetic and then they\nwill not respond to me and so now what I\nneed to do is no longer double text or\ntriple text or quadruple text I need to\nsend one text and then I need to wait so\nI come up with all these rules but\nwhat's the purpose of the rules the\npurpose of the rules is to elicit a\nparticular kind of response and this is\nwhat's really tricky is like in the back\nof our mind we just need to understand\nthat we can't control anyone else and\nhow does that help us in texting because\nhere's how it helps us\nwhen I take my natural impulses I get\nexcited about Christmas time and so when\nI text someone I want to talk to them\nabout Christmas time because that's\nwhat's exciting to me right now when I\nstart restraining all of my impulses for\nthe sake of eliciting a particular\nresponse I'm essentially making a\nsacrifice for the sake of the texting\nright then if I don't get that response\nwhat happens now I've made a sacrifice\nand I didn't even get what I paid for\nand if I didn't get what I paid for then\nI feel resentful and what do we do when\nwe feel resentful do we process our\nemotions in a healthy manner no of\ncourse not we take that resentment we\npackage it up and we shove it deep deep\ndown inside ourselves into this black\npit of our stomach where all of our\nresentment from our failed texts show up\nand then what happens is all of those\nthoughts and feelings come out in\npassive aggressive ways with the next\nperson that we text so now not only are\nthey dealing with us and our own\ninsecurities they are also have to do\nwith all of the resentment that is piled\nup and if you have tried online dating\nyou understand this because you are not\ntalking to a human being you are talking\nto a human being plus the pile of\nresentment that they carry from trying\nto date online for two years and texting\nwith people so how what do we do about\nthat take a step back remember you can't\ncontrol any other human being should you\nperhaps modify your behavior a little\nbit with texting absolutely we're not\nsaying you know just burst out and\nignore and just talk to people about\nwhatever you want we're not saying you\nshould send walls of text just because\nyou feel like it but in the back of your\nmind start to think a little bit about\nokay what am I doing when I text am I\nreally trying to elicit a particular\nkind of response am I texting because I\nenjoy it or am I texting because I want\nsomething from this person is this a\ngame that I need to play because if it's\na game I need to play I better figure\nout the rules and I better play by the\nrules and then why do I I get screwed\nand resentful there because I learned\nthe rules of one person and then I start\ntexting someone else and they're playing\nwith a completely different set of rules\nbut I had to learn this game over here\nand now you're making me play this\ndifferent game over here it's so\nfrustrating I'm so resentful and then\nwhen person three comes along the\nresentment comes pouring out so what do\nwe do about that take a step back\nrecognize you can't control anyone's\nBehavior right and the more that you do\nthat the less resentful you will become\nso I know it sounds kind of bizarre but\nthis is something that it boggles my\nmind as a professional Communicator that\neverything that I see about how to text\nhas nothing to do with how to read a\ntext everything is rules rules rules\nabout what to say and what not to say\ncan you imagine what life would be like\nif we did that in communication where\nI'm just blabbing at you constantly and\nI have my own set of internal rules and\nI'm not paying any attention to what you\nactually said of no wonder texting is a\nmess so if you want to be become a\nbetter texter don't worry about the\nrules you can learn however many rules\nyou want to the problem is you don't\neven know who you're texting with if\nthey're playing by the same rule book so\nwhat's the point of learning the rules\ninstead learn how to read a text\nproperly right and that comes down to a\ncouple of really simple things the first\nthing is if you get pissed off remember\nthat all kinds of nonverbal\ncommunication tone eye contact facial\nexpressions you can't convey any of that\nsarcasm you can't convey any of that\nemojis so we try to add in Emotion where\nwe can with Emojis but if something\nupsets you in a text the last thing that\nyou want to do is take a step back but\nthat's exactly what you should do think\ncritically about the text try to give\nthem a terrible charitable\ninterpretation second thing you've got\nto do okay but that's in the case of a\nresponse that upsets you what if they\ndon't respond remember that texting is\nultimately about convenience right so\nsometimes it takes people a day or a\ncouple days or five days or seven days\nthe other thing is sometimes stuff\nhappens in their life so even their\nnormal texting patterns are not really\ngoing to be there there could be\nsomething as simple as oh yeah I looked\nat this text and I wanted to send a very\nthoughtful response because you said\nsomething really cool but I don't have\nthe time to send thoughtful response now\nand so instead what I'm going to do is\njust I'll remember to do it later but\nnow it's no longer an unread text and I\nnever see it I forget about it the next\nday and then this person is left on red\nfor like six months there's all kinds of\nstuff that can happen sometimes we even\nget ghosted and what's the deal with\nghosting well the first thing to\nunderstand is how do you know if you've\nbeen ghosted how do individual human\nbeings determine if they have been\nghosted the most common measurement for\nwhether you've been ghosted or not based\non what I've observed has to do with the\nexpectations and desires of the person\nbeing ghosted I wanted a response within\n48 hours and they didn't give it to me\ntherefore I am ghosted because if I'm\nghosted then I blame them and they're a\nbad human being and they hurt me so be\ncareful about ghosting you may not\nnecessarily have been ghosted who knows\nthe last thing to understand is that as\nwe start to text we want to win this\ngame in order to win the game we'll make\nall kinds of sacrifices and so as we\nmake these sacrifices I want to talk\nabout this but people don't like it when\nI talk about this so I'm not going to\ntalk about this I'm going to talk about\nwhat they talk about right so as we make\nsacrifices we want particular things I'm\ndoing this so that this person will go\non a date with me and then they don't go\non a date with you and then I'm left\nwith a pile of resentment so remember\nfirst and foremost or I guess last and\nnot least that texting you can't control\nsomeone else's Behavior through your\ncommunication and the goal of\ncommunication is to for to a certain\ndegree accommodate the other person but\nalso to represent yourself in what you\nwant it's not about a particular outcome\nit's about communication with another\nhuman being there's a relationship it is\nnot a puzzle to be solved that you have\nto conform to their wishes so that they\nwill respond to you and the more that we\ntry to control other people with texting\nthe more resentful we become the more\nresentful we become the harder it is to\nread texts properly and then it becomes\na vicious cycle which is exactly why\ntexting is the mess that we see today so\nif you want to become a better texter\ndon't worry about the rules of how to\nwrite a text learn how to read a text\nforeign"
