a\nreminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discussed on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is\nfor educational or entertainment\npurposes only so if youall have a\nmedical concern or question please go\nsee a licensed\nprofessional um happy Monday everybody\nit's nice to see everybody again uh it\nlooks like I am\nstreaming on the on the internets so\nlook at that I'm going to just pop out\nsome chat here so we get some some\ngoodness hi everybody so today we're\ngoing to be uh talking to M GIF no idea\nwhat we're going to be talking about or\nwhatever but we're going to be starting\nin about 5 minutes or\nso\num yeah\nso yeah how's everybody doing we doing\ngood\nchat um yeah so not not really sure like\nwe'll just see where the conversation\ngoes which is usually what happens when\nwhen M KF and I talk m kff is an\nabsolute awesome dude strongly recommend\nyall check out his stream and whatnot\nbut how's everybody doing we're like in\nMay of\n2024 it's here finally\nthe world still keeps\nturning um lot of changes recently in\nthe universe there was a big DOTA patch\nthat dropped I'm having some fun with it\nI found it mentally\noverwhelming um yeah everyone is good\nsomeone Matt jro got a girlfriend and\nand feels\nscared DOTA patch\nPOG\ngreat absolute bra ADHD brained\nManiac yeah you know it's interesting I\nI um I'm thinking oh God I need to\nbutton chat oh my goodness\num yeah\nso people who are saying girlfriend\npatch when uh yeah it's it's\noverwhelming the DOTA patch was a little\nbit overwhelming to be honest like I was\nlike this is too much have they gone too\nfar is this going to be the point at\nwhich I I stopped playing Dota 2 because\nit's like too much um but no it's\nactually the first couple games where\nwere overwhelming and now it's a lot of\nfun so\num yeah so someone's asking have I done\na video on 12-step programs you know the\nbig\nirony is uh we actually have not done a\nwhole lot of addiction content recently\nso there are a couple of like big things\nthat are kind of on our list that we\njust need to get around to um I'm\nworking on four lectures right\nnow\nfive um one of them is on why you should\nbe more empathic one of them is why you\nshould be less empathic empathy research\nis so interesting another one we're\nworking on like we're understanding\nbetter the causes of brain rot like this\nis crazy like what's happening to our\nbrains um and it it's crazy so like the\ntricky thing is a lot of the stuff that\nwe work on is not stuff that has very\nclear research on so brain rot is a\nreally good example that people are like\ninvestigating in a lot of different ways\num but there isn't there isn't like a\nconsensus and the other challenge is\nthat it's like changing very rapidly so\nthe rate of brain rot in the\ninterventions that are inducing brain\nrot are changing quite a bit so working\non that and then uh yeah we've got a\ncouple other good ones in the pipeline\num yeah give us a small spoiler about\nabout brain\nrot um so just to give youall like a\ncouple of quick examples of\nthis so if we look at what's happening\nto our brains it's happening on multiple\nlevels so this is the first thing to\nunderstand so we it doesn't have one\ncause it has like a lot of different\ncauses so one thing that's happening is\nwe are increasing our sedentary\nlifestyle so as the human body stops\nmoving around for most of the hours of\nthe day it has profound impacts on our\ncardiovascular and like endocrine\nsystems and one thing that's happening\nis like cerebral blood flow is being\naltered inflam inflammatory markers are\nbeing increased so we know that uh so\nthere like some people even discovered\nthat depression is caused by or is\ncorrelated with inflammation in the\nbrain like a low level of inflammation\nso there were even trials to give\nanti-inflammatory medications like Neds\nnon-steroidal anti-inflamm I mean uh\nyeah non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory medications like these\nare things like ibuprofen didn't really\nshow much clinical benefit in depression\nbut there are some subtypes of\ndepression that are caused by basically\nlike medical illness in the body like\npeople who have like rheumatoid\narthritis flares or things like that and\nthen some of those trials IDs can be\nuseful but basically we're becoming more\nsedentary when we become more sedentary\nour cells start getting\ninflamed and like we're not entirely\nsure why that is but we know it's true\nand so that inflammation travels up to\nthe brain and like causes different\nkinds of problems another really wild\nstudy that I saw is the correlation\nbetween consuming the same content over\nand over and over again and\num reductions in bdnf so this is like\nabsolutely wild but brain derived\nneurotrophic factor is something that\nlike so neurotrophic means it builds\nneurons so it's like this chemical that\nis released by cells in our brain to\nlike stimulate growth of neurons in\nhealing\nand it's possible that consuming the\nsame content on the internet over and\nover and over again literally decreases\nwe're not sure about this literally\ndecreases like the expression of\nbdnf and so like watching content on the\ninternet may like literally reduce your\nthe signals in your brain that stimulate\nlike growth and\nhealing um it's really\nwild so it it's crazy so there there's\nlike all kinds of stuff anyway there's\nlike we're sorting through it maybe\nwe'll we'll get into it with Miz but um\nbefore we we jump in with our interview\nwith Miss kif we're going to just talk\nabout uh the 988 crisis line for a\nsecond so today's stream is sponsored by\n988 this is a United States and five\nterritory governmental program to create\na new line that helps people with\nwhatever kind of Crisis they're going to\num so couple of super cool things about\nthis 988 uh connects you with a crisis\ncounselor Live 24 hours a day 7 days a\nweek for free and they can provide you\nwith support and connect you with\nadditional resources so definitely check\nout the 988 Crisis Line we're really\ngrateful that they're you know\nsponsoring today's stream um we're also\nsuper happy to collaborate with them\nbecause like you know oftentimes people\nin our community are in crisis and one\nof the things that we certainly don't\nprovide our crisis resources are support\nso we're always happy to collaborate\nwith groups and institutions that sort\nof supplement where we don't do things\nand I know sometimes we'll see this like\npeople in our our community will post\nright like hey I have a friend in crisis\nI don't know what to do um a couple\nyears ago it was like how do I get a\nhold of Dr K my friend is in crisis and\nand you know I'm not I'm not in an\ninternet ambulance but that's what the\n988 crisis line is there for so we're\nalways happy to connect yall with\nresources to help youall through\nwhatever problemsa you so thanks to 988\nfor sponsoring today's\nstream um let's see if if Miss K is\nready yeah I mean I it's it's wild chat\nlike it's wild so out of the stuff that\nI mentioned though what are y'all\ninterested\nin like tell me like what\ny'all\nwant um I will go ahead and\nring and then we will pop\nout and then we will decrease\nthis and\n[Music]\nthen did we fix this nope it still says\nthe wrong person let me see if I can fix\nthis real quick\nhe uh guest\nscoffed\nme\n[Music]\num there we\ngo hey\nhey can you count to 10 for\nme 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 is that good\nokay perfect how are you doing\nman\nuh I'm all\nright I'm stressed out of my mind\nhonestly oh no yeah last time I saw you\nI think you were\nfostering\ndogs yeah that was also stressing me out\nof my mind are is that part are you done\nwith that task in life\nyeah that was a very stressful task I\nmean the dogs are uh do you know who\nfandy is vaguely yeah she she took one\nof the dogs some of the dogs went to\nother homes they all got adopted at the\nend of the day cool awesome good for you\ndude it was interesting I mean it was\njust that was a lot of work but it was\nit was a good time I think it's people\nthink that you know lots of puppies is\ngoing to be lots of fun but it can be\nsuper\nchallenging yeah I I didn't think that\nat all I I knew that they were going to\nbe it was going to be terrible work but\nI mean it was some it was rewarding\nbecause I mean you got to help out it\nwas nice the chat liked it too yeah\nawesome\ndude\num yeah it's cool it's it's interesting\nbecause I you know i' I've been to that\nroom a couple of times but I haven't\nseen it from like a stream\nperspective because last couple times I\nthink we've just talked in person that\nbig of a difference\nthough yeah because I think I look at\ndifferent things right so I'm usually\nsitting next to you\nand so my my angle is different yeah\nyeah like there's pictures there's weird\nstuff over\nhere yeah that's cool I'm\nsorry is that written on the wall\ndirectly yeah it's because I had to\nstare at a wall for 12 hours oh my\ngoodness what was that what's that\nabout uh I basically I think I owed my\nchat it so I stared at a wall for 12\nhours and I just kept writing on the\nwall because I was going Saye but I do\nhave to say staring at a wall is\nactually pretty nice and it is\nmeditative tell me about that and I felt\nbetter\nafterwards oh tell you about it I mean I\nI don't know what it does but it was on\nstream too and after I was done staring\nat the wall I actually felt a lot better\nI think I I don't know if it's because I\nwas just only using my brain to\nentertain myself so I was more uh you\nknow engaged with my myself and I was\njust thinking better or clearer\nH but it was it actually worked I I I\nremember feeling like cuz I know you've\nsaid before like oh staring at a wall\nactually can help you for like an hour\nyeah I wouldn't recommend 12 at one\nstretch but I just try to get it out my\near you know what's interesting I\nactually listen to you a lot and I even\nbought a l Tolen okay you said the\nbecause you said that can possibly help\nwith uh what was it I think brain\nrot yeah so I I don't think we usually I\nI don't recall recommending supplements\nso you know your mileage may vary but I\nI don't\nremember Ludy Olan can be helpful so\nsome studies will show that like that\nkind of stuff can be helpful but the\nchallenge with a lot of these studies is\nthat uh sometimes they'll have small\nsample sizes sometimes they're not well\ncontrolled but have you noticed a\ndifference since you started taking\nit no I I think my environment is\nto to tough to really notice a\ndifference it it I I genuinely just am\nway too stressed I'm stressed out my\nmind yeah you mentioned that a couple\ntimes what's is that something you want\nto talk about today yeah sure I I I\nmean basically I feel like\num I feel like I've definitely put on\nway too much of a workload for myself\nokay I mean\nI this going to sound really cringe but\nI I do own like seven companies right\nand um I think you know instead of me\njust focusing on my stream and my job I\nfocus too much on other things which is\nalso like my companies or my work um and\nnot things I care\nabout and I thought that it's things I\nwould care about but it's at the end of\nthe day it's just really stressful and I\nI don't know how to ma manage my stress\nlike I try a lot I go to the gym I'll do\nother things and it helps for sure but\nit's not enough I just get too stressed\nto the point where I'm I'm like not as\nentertaining because I'm being\nstressed I don't know what to do okay\ncan I think for a\nsecond okay so um I I think there's I I\ndon't know the specifics of your\nsituation we'll learn a little bit more\nabout that but I think one thing that\nmay be helpful uh and this is kind of\nyou know I'll kind of Punt to you is so\nI've noticed I've worked with many\npeople who are chronically\nstressed and if we look at sort of like\nlet's pull things out of your specific\ncircumstance um and understand we can\nget it back into it in a second but like\nlet's understand like how is it that\npeople end up in chronically stressful\nsituations so it's almost interesting\nbecause you know sometimes when I work\nwork with people um like clients or\npatients they'll they'll come to me and\nthey'll be like I'm stressed I'm\nstressed everything's falling apart and\nthen at some point I'll have a\nconversation with them about okay like I\ncan patch you up and send you back into\nThe Fray but at some point we should\nhave a conversation about like why you\nkeep on getting into these situations\nright so sometimes people will come to\nme they're like in crisis we kind of put\nthem back together and then we like they\ncontinue living their life in the same\nway and then things kind of build up\nbuild up build up\nand sometimes what I find is incredibly\nhelpful with people and I think this\nhappens to like most people is we're not\nreally aware of the internal\ndrivers that push us to create the\nsituations that we're chronically\nin what do you think about that I\nrealize it was a complex sentence like\nwell no you basically said we're not\nwe're not aware of what we're doing\nsometimes to be stressed in the first\nplace right absolutely right so you're\ntalking about how managing your stress\nit sounds like you're doing all the\nright things that managing your stress\nis insufficient so this is kind of like\nyou're tanking some amount of damage on\na daily basis and then you have some\namount of like heal overtime [ __ ] like\nthat's going on and that's how you're\ntrying to balance it but if you're heal\nover time if working out and doing this\nand taking lud Olan and all this stuff\nis like it's insufficient for like the\nDeep DPS like then we have to really\nthink about how can we reduce the\noverall DPS and often times we don't\nrealize that the situations that we\ncreate our find ourselves in and I don't\nwant to go too much into detail because\nwe can ask you about that but and and\nreally there's some like principles even\nfrom like the discipline of like yoga\nand like sort of Buddhist thought about\nhow to understand like how our mind\nworks and how we end up it's almost like\na karmic perspective that we kind of\nreap what we seow right so you're saying\nthat I have seven companies fair enough\nI don't think that's cringe at all but I\nunderstand why you say that my question\nis how did we get from 0 to one and then\n1 to two and then 2 to three and then\nfour to five and 5 to six and six to 7\nand what was happening in your brain\nwhen someone was like hey let's do\nanother company and you were like\nsure yeah I mean for me a lot of the\nidea was uh it was I mean the hard part\nfor me is like I need motivation for a\nlot of what I do okay and for me like\nthe the\nmotivation is like I do I do love\nentertaining I do love streaming but I\nalways wanted to have like like kind of\nmid maxing almost where it's like oh\nwell while I'm doing that I can promote\nsomething that's on my stream at all\ntimes like Star Forge or whatever I want\nto promote and basically I could just\nutilize that while also streaming so\nit's like you get you know killed two\nwordss almost three words with one stone\nand I think that that idea sounds great\nin your head but then you realize off\nstream you still have to deal with that\nbusiness all the time and what I did is\nI essentially just took on too much\nstuff over the years and now I have to\ndo those things and off stream which is\nbasically my job so off my job I have to\ndo you know 700 different calls going\nplaces trying to figure stuff out and I\ndon't necessarily mind doing that and I\nI really don't mind the stress but my\nproblem with my stress now is it's not\nmaking me as entertaining because when\nyou're stressed you're just not as funny\nand or at least for me I'm not nearly as\nentertaining and I want to be as\nentertaining as possible okay so what\nwhat's stressful about your situation\nright\nnow um what's stressful about my\nsituation is I just feel like I have no\ntime to breathe and if the problem with\nme is if I do have time to breathe like\nlet's say I'm watching a show or\nsomething\nI know while watching that\nshow that I could be doing something\nelse that would be beneficial to\nsomething else so to another company or\nto my business or to my job or to my\nstream and that watching TV a lot of\ntimes feels like a waste of time because\nI could be doing something else I could\nbe messaging somebody because the\nproblem with being entrepreneurial is\nyou can always be doing more and it's\nhard to say when that's\nenough okay okay so what I'm noticing\nthis is kind of wild but sounds like\nyour relaxation is\nstressful yes oh very stressful like I\nI'm stressed of relaxing because when I\nrelax I'm like oh my God I should be you\nknow doing something else so I'm not\neven enjoying the moments now what we've\ngot is a hot that's turned into a\nDOT\nY what do you think about that it sucks\nbecause you're supposed to balance those\nyou know that time\noff uh\nwith relaxing and but I I just can't do\nit I mean even at the gym I'll take\ncalls I'll I'll be texting people about\nstuff I'll be checking things uh and\nhonestly I think the entrepreneurial\nlife is not the best sometimes for me\nbecause I just get too hyper obsessed\nwith well you could be doing this you\ncould just be a little bit better and\nthings would be better and it's just\nkind of taken a huge toll on me over the\nyears I I don't know I don't know I I\nwish I could just manage it a little bit\nbetter like something that cuz I know\nwhat you can do you can say to me hey\nhere's this this and this oh thank you\ndoc I feel a lot better but in you know\ntwo weeks from now something will happen\nand I'll be stressed again and I I just\nI want to figure out how to manage it\nover sure we can we can talk about that\nso so I'm conf I'm I'm I'm a bit uh\nconfused so when you say I I could say\noh Miz just do this this this and things\nwill be better what kind of stuff are\nyou imagining I would say that would\nhelp for a week or two\num it's almost like you said what you\nsaid about patching up it's like you can\njust you know make me feel decent for\nlike the day and I'll be like oh I feel\nmuch better but in two weeks from now I\ncould be stressed again and then I just\nwant to learn how to manage that okay\npart so let's start with that so\nwhat why is it that something can help\nin one day so this is going to be tough\nokay so I'm going to ask you some hard\nquestions so how is it that something\ncan be helpful for today but not helpful\ntwo weeks from\nnow you you said like I could patch you\nup right but then two weeks from now\nlike we're kind of back to square one is\nthe vibe that I'm getting right why\nyeah because I I don't know I mean I've\ntalked to people about stress and things\nand I usually just talking to somebody\nmakes you feel a lot better okay maybe\nyou just let some of your emotions out\nor your stress Itself by just talking\nthrough it okay but then in two weeks\nfrom now when you know something bad\nhappens or I have to focus on\nsomething uh it'll just come right back\nand I don't how to manage it okay okay\nso so here's the way that I would kind\nof conceptualize this that's that's a\nreally good point so let's say like I I\ncould we could crit heal you today right\nso we could do like we can talk about\nyour emotions but if we think or like\nwhatever stressing you out we can offer\nsome compassion we can offer some some\npeer support some social capital like\nthere's all kinds of things that you can\ndo like one dose like one injection\nright like we can just inject you with\nsome\ncompassion and but that like so I I get\nwhat you're saying and I'm just going to\nkind of repeat it back to you there's\nlike one offs and then there's like the\nstable level of like stress right and\nand one doesn't fix the other do you see\nthat one is like a systemic stress and\none is like an injective relief\nso what is it that how how can we\npossibly fix this daytoday\nstress I don't know and what sucks too\ndoc I'll be honest is even when you're\ntalking I'm thinking about oh I could be\ndoing this I should be doing that I\nshould be focusing on this it's every\nsecond of my day is you could be doing\nsomething else unless you're I'm doing\nsomething else and it's it's\ndebilitating okay so have there been\nperiods of your time of your life where\nyou haven't been stressed oh yeah it was\nbefore I did all this it it's before I\ngave myself this massive workload that I\nshould not have given myself and I\nreally do think it was also before I was\nin the entrepreneur business like before\nI was a streamer before I was a you know\ntry to make\nbusinesses I I almost enjoyed the time\nof you know hey you were here's work you\nwork 9 to5 you're done you clock in you\nclock out and you you when you're on the\nweekend you're saying to yourself oh\nwell this is what I'm supposed to be\ndoing I'm supposed to be relaxing with\nmy family on Saturday and Sunday so you\nyou enjoy those\nmoments but for someone that's in the\nentrepreneurial business if you you can\nalways be doing better and that mindset\nhas just taken complete control over me\nand I just feel\nlost yeah so\nI mean what I'm kind of getting the vibe\nof is that you're relentlessly chasing\nefficiency and doing more yes and so\nhere's kind of what I'm wondering is\nlike if we can understand because\nbecause I I think this is like driven by\nyou in some ways does that make sense\nyou cut out right when you said driven\nso this is kind of driven by you in some\nways yes how is it's all by me how is it\ndriven by you\nI because I have such a high standard of\nmaking you know of of like of myself\nlike I I want to be the best I want to\nmake sure everything works\num where where does the high standard\ncome\nfrom you know what's funny I don't even\nknow because my family was never like\nthat they were always like you can chill\nyou can relax enjoy your life my\nfamily's very middle class they were\njust like hey let's focus on the moment\nnot focus on you know businesses like I\nI I mean granted my parents were very\nwork oriented they worked all day and\nthey would come home at 9: at night to\nsee me and then go to bed um\nbut they they were always telling me\nlike yeah try to enjoy your life try to\nenjoy the moment I don't know where this\nwork idea came from where I just am\nworking so much I I don't know maybe\nit's an insecurity maybe I'm just\ninsecure about failure or or I want to\nbe better so I can feel like I have a\nhigher Social Status and the person next\nto me um but whatever it is it's not\nworth\nit so when\nwe how do you feel about yourself\nbecause doing all this stuff isn't worth\nit um I feel\nI feel like it's not necessarily that\nit's I just feel like I wasted my time\nlike I feel like I've just you know\ninstead of doing like seven different\nthings I wish I did like two you know\nit's just like hey like calm down stop\ntrying to do so much because and maybe\nit's fomo that I got for a while with\nthese things um I I I don't know I feel\nvery just upset I'm just like dude did\nyou really just get stressed for 3 years\nfour years straight when you started\nmaking these things and doing these\nthings I cuz I I hate it like I'm like\ndude you make all these things you do\nall these things so you can enjoy the\ntime off and be you know hey uh you know\nlet's let's watch a TV show well when\nI'm watching that show the entire time\nI'm just thinking to myself holy [ __ ] I\ncould be doing anything else that's work\noriented to make my you know company\ngrow because streaming is a business and\nit's just taken my life can I process\nfor a second mhm I think you're sending\na lot of good stuff my way\nokay so it sounds like you're very\nunsatisfied with yourself for having\ncreated this\nsituation yeah and what would you like\nto happen if I could wave a magic\nwand and do whatever I could make some\nwe've got some magical genie situation\nand I could make wishes on your half\nwhat would you wish\nfor I doc I would wish that I just\nstopped caring as much I I wish I would\njust relax and say you know what like\nthat extra 10% you can be getting from\nyou know focusing on this so much and\nHyper you know just caring about it so\nmuch to the point where you can't even\nenjoy your life off stream or off you\nknow whatever you're\ndoing is not worth it and I can enjoy my\nlife I just want my mind to be cleared\nokay and\nand like you know what TMJ is yeah like\nI got TMJ from all the stress like my\njaw cracks yeah it sucks all day it\ncracks my neck cracks really\nbadly um my eyes hurt all the time it's\nall from the stress\nokay so you wished you stopped caring as\nmuch so what what is it that makes that\nhard for\nyou it it's the idea that you can always\nbe doing\nmore where does that idea come\nfrom it could be that I\nI competitiveness with\nothers okay maybe I just I'm I'm very\ncomp are you competitive with others\nI would say I'm more competitive with\nwith others when it comes\nto you know it's trying\nto\nbe or like trying to have like a higher\nstatus I could guess you could say\nbecause it's my you know it's kind of my\njob how does it feel when you have a\nhigher when your status improves no you\ndon't feel\nanything okay so if your status improves\ndoes your hunger for status increase\ndecrease or stay the same it stays the\nsame that's the worst part\nokay so\nhow so let's say like I I this is going\nto be tough okay so let's say like I\nfeel thirsty right and then I'm going to\ndrink some water and if I if I tell you\nMiz I feel thirsty I'm going to drink\nsome water and then the water has no\nimpact on my thirst how would you\nunderstand what's going on inside\nme I would have no\nidea\nokay what do you think is the\nrelationship between the water and my\nthirst well the water would quench your\nthirst and if it\ndoesn't it doesn't do\nanything okay right so it's kind of\nweird right\nyes okay good um\nso let me just\nthink how long have you wanted to be\nbetter my whole life of course I I mean\nI've always wanted to be better I've\nalways always wanted to be\nsuccessful even when I was a kid like\nwhen I wanted to be the first person to\nget a job in my grade so I went to Toys\nR Us and gave a lady a notepad and said\nhey here's my number can she's like oh\nyou're hitting on me I'm like no I want\na job I was like I think it when I first\ngot my phone I was in fourth grade or\nthird grade how old were you when you\nfirst wanted a job oh what what is third\ngrade uh\nnine okay why did you want to be the\nfirst person to have a job because I\nwanted money why did you want\nmoney I guess it\nshows maybe it's power maybe it's you\nknow the feeling\nof security it it it could\nbe uh I don't know okay I don't think\nit's power or security so I'll tell you\nwhy so you said you wanted to be the\nfirst\nperson y right so the power the security\nthat you get from money at the age of\nnine is relatively fixed whether you're\nthe first person the second person the\nthird person or the fifth person does\nthat make sense when you say fixed is\nthat because basically there's not\nreally anything you can get at nine no\nwhat I'm saying is that first is\nimportant but like so if I get a if I'm\nlooking for security from a job whether\nI'm the first person in my grade to get\nit to the last person the only thing\nthat matters is I get theone money with\nthe security right first doesn't enter\nthe equation does that make sense y but\nthe fact that you wanted to be the first\nperson tells us that the need is not\nsecurity or power and we also have a\nsecond clue to that is that sometimes\nwhen I ask you questions you'll say\nmaybe it's this maybe it's this I don't\nknow maybe it's an\ninsecurity so that tells me that it's\nnot an answer from in here it's an\nanswer from up here\nright so it probably true on some\nlevel but like if we pay attention to\nyour words we'll understand what's\nimportant why do you want to be the\nfirst person what does that tell\nyou uh that I'm an\n[ __ ] that I'm competitive I that I\nwant I mean I I don't know how how does\nit feel to be the\nfirst um\nI don't know it it just felt I mean it's\nhard for me to conceptualize how I felt\nwhen I was nine yeah of course I just\nknow I wanted to be someone with a job I\nwanted to people to say wow that guy's\ngot a cool job he's worked at Toys R Us\nus he I don't even know what I was going\nto try to do I sell gumballs I had no\nidea but I wanted the job badly and um I\nwanted to work because I wanted to grow\nmy wealth and stupid as it sounds I\nwanted to grow my wealth make money so I\ncould become rich one day and and\nrelax what made it hard to relax when\nyou were\nnine\num that I felt like I was just wasting\nmy time when I do things like if I\nwasn't uh I even when I was like 15 I I\nwanted jobs badly and I always wanted to\nwork harder and work work work and I\nthink I don't know what that Drive was I\nI I really wish I couldn't think but I\nthink it almost could be the same drive\nI have today because it just never stops\ndoes it feel the same it's funny that\nthat nine-year-old kid of me would have\nsaid you're good today like hey relax\nyou did what you were going to do um you\nsaid you were going to try to make money\nand you did it but I'm here and I I do\nwant more and I'm like I don't know what\nto do with that okay so um I think we'll\nbe able to maybe understand some of the\nthings that play here\num and not just for you but for anyone\nwho's\nwatching uh I I and I think I think\nthere's a lot here I hate to do this but\nwe have to take a I have to take a quick\nbreak just to talk about 988 is it okay\nif we do that right now because I don't\nwant to interrupt things so I think I've\ngot like a pretty\ngood I've got like a a page of stuff\nthat we'll try to stitch together but\nbefore we do that I want to just talk\nabout 988 real quick so this is probably\nsomething that's like use for y'all's\nCommunity as well um but just wanted to\ngive youall a quick heads up that\ntoday's stream is sponsored by 988 so\nthis is something super cool that uh the\nUnited States

you you what are\nyou taking away so far has anything kind\nof floated to the surface for you nope\nokay so let me let me uh kind of I'm\njust trying to think about do I want to\nask you more questions\nor okay so you said that your family was\nlike very middle class and what time\nwould your what time would your both of\nyour parents worked yep all day and uh\nwhat was that like for\nyou I missed them a lot I would think\nabout it all the time I'm like you know\num I wish they were around more uh I\nmean obviously when I was a teenager I\nsaid I wish they were around less right\nlike I just wanted to be alone or in the\nhouse but when I was a kid I I did wish\nthey were around more but I I understood\nwhat they're doing I mean they were\nworking to support us to make us have a\ngood life to put us through college but\nI I did see what it did to them and I\nsaw that my parents yeah my especially\nmy mom all she cared about was work her\nwhole life she was a workaholic and I\nmaybe that's where I got it from and she\nworked so much that she just missed all\nof the years you know when I was a kid\nit was like she did not she was not\nthere for my baseball game she was not\nthere for anything because my mom was\nworking so much that she would come home\nat 6:30 7:00 you know she'd make dinner\nshe'd be in bed by like 9:00 and she'd\ngo and that's it um so my mom even had\ntwo jobs at one point cuz she just liked\nworking she didn't have to do it she\njust wanted to work um so it was kind of\nI don't think she let me put it this way\nshe definitely regrets it I'm sure if I\nasked her today do you regret working so\nmuch she would say yes because she\nmissed out on a lot of my pivotal years\nof my life and my my families did y'all\nneed the money\nno how do you understand how do you\nunderstand why she took a second job if\ny'all didn't need the\nmoney I well I understand that she\nworked a lot because she wanted to\nsupport us and make us have the best\nlife possible like she liked that we\nwere you know living in a pretty nice\nhouse for middle class I would say uh\nshe liked that our colleges were paid\nfor for the majority of it and that's\nwhat she worked for was for us but at\nthe end of the day I I don't we didn't\nneed that we would rather have her been\nthere for things um but I think for her\nshe thought her place was to\nwork how did do you remember what it was\nlike to have baseball games and have\nyour mom not show\nup honestly doc will be real no because\nI was so focused on trying to make\neveryone laugh around me that I didn't\neven pay attention why were you so\nfocused on making everyone laugh because\nthat's what I'm good at or I was when\nI'm stressed I [ __ ] suck ass at it\nbut when I'm not stressed I'm a funny\nguy why do you want to be a what's the\nimportance of being a funny guy I feel\nlike it's what I'm good\nat and I it's I've always been really\ngood at it and it makes when when I make\nsomeone laugh like genuinely laugh it's\na euphoric feeling that I've never had\nin my life no matter of no sex no\nnothing has ever made me feel better\nthan when I make someone laugh in my\nlife what does it feel like when you\nmake someone else laugh it feels like I\nI'm successful almost it makes me feel\nlike I did what I was supposed to do and\nI don't know it's the it's the best feel\nI ever had in my life is when someone\ngenuinely in front of me is like that\nwas [ __ ] funny like a witty response\na clever joke you know or like something\nstupid like uh I just fall on the ground\nand someone laughs I just feel makes me\nfeel happy okay always have it's all\nthat that is all I've ever cared about\nis making people laugh but then I also\nhave another side of me it's like well\nyou like business but the business side\nstresses me out so then that that other\nside isn't as funny I don't think those\nare two different sides but we'll get to\nthat in a second um so so when you make\nsomeone laugh how do you feel can you\ndescribe it at all like what goes\nthrough you like it literally feels like\nI just nutted okay if just it feels like\na Godlike feeling I've never had\nexperienced in my life that I love\nhaving it it's just amazing it it is my\nfavorite feeling who do you become when\nyou make someone\nlaugh\num who do I\nbecome I don't know I almost if I'm\nreally making people laugh and I'm in a\ngood mood I almost feel euphoric yeah so\nyou feel euphoric but like I what I'm\nkind of I'm kind of pushing for an\nanswer here but I'll just share my\nobservation so in my mind there's two\nkinds of mffs there's the misf who's\ntrying to make people laugh and the mff\nwho makes people laugh and these seem to\nbe very different human beings to me\nlike their internal experience of who\nthey are is like very\ndifferent what do you think does that\nresonate with you at all or not so much\nyeah no I I agree there's the one that's\ntrying to make people laugh is very\nstressed y the one that does make people\nlaugh is not stressed at all so where\ndoes that Euphoria come\nfrom I don't\nknow it it's just me feeling like that's\nmy place on Earth and I'm good at it and\nwhen I'm making people laugh I feel like\nI'm the best at it but when I'm stressed\nI don't feel like I can do it at all I\njust feel like I'm closed up and I want\nto hide in a bunker I don't want to be\naround\nokay can I think for a second\nmhm how do you feel when people\ncriticize\nyou\num the problem with my brain with ADHD\nis if someone criticizes me and I\nresonate with it I'll think about it a\nlot like I'll just like close my eyes\nand almost see the image of what someone\nsaid about me um it's definitely gotten\na little bit easier over the years with\ncriticism I don't really take it as much\nbecause I\njust it it I've seen it all but I it\ndoes I do still see it and it hurts and\nI I Hur it hurts more when the person is\nbeing genuine like I know when someone's\nlike oh well Miz is a loser and boring\nlike I don't care but if it's someone\nthat's like yeah like I watched M for 5\nyears and now he's just not entertaining\nyeah that kills\nme so would it be fair to say that the\nway that you feel about yourself is\ninfluenced by how other people treat you\nabsolutely yeah of\ncourse how tight is that correlation\nlike if if you get like and what about\ncompliments like if someone\nauthentically Praises you then how do\nyou feel oh amazing yeah it's all tied\nto how people think about me I'll read\nyou know one good thing about me and\nI'll feel good for a week but I'll read\none bad thing and I'll feel like [ __ ] or\nhear one bad thing or or see one bad\nit's I'm very tied to how people think\nabout me uh which is it's it's not good\nwhat's not good about it uh that I have\nno confidence in myself with it like\nI it's weird sometimes I feel like I'm\nthe most confident guy in the world and\nsometimes I just feel like I'm a shell\nof who I once was\nwhat\nchanged uh\ntrauma okay that'll do it yeah that\n[ __ ] me up pretty bad how long ago was\nmy trauma mhm a year and a half ago\nokay um that'll certainly do it\nso\nuh and I if if these seven companies\nwere\nsuccessful how would you\nfeel they are successful how do you\nfeel\nnothing so what is it that okay so the\nthe success doesn't matter to you or not\ndoesn't matter isn't the right word it\ndoesn't seem to fulfill you yep doesn't\nfulfill me at all okay and\nuh what was in your mind when you\nstarted number seven\nthat it's interesting like each one's\nkind of different like I I I did make\nthe gym that I have I really just made\nit for fun I didn't make it for profit\num which I don't mind that one and I I\ndon't mind that I made these businesses\nthey're all successful in doing their\nown thing my problem with my businesses\nis more so I just care too much like and\nit's not even a care that matters it's\nyou're you're getting 5% more great your\nyour company's worth 5% more for all the\nstress you have but you don't even enjoy\nyour off days you're just sitting there\ncontemplating what you could be doing\nbetter contemplating this and that for\nwhat for 5% that 5% doesn't matter and I\ndon't mind the work and I don't mind\nputting the business and and and working\nhard but what I do mind is I just\nbasically have cre this Loop of\nuh where if I'm watching a TV show my\nbrain instantly starts thinking hey do\nsomething else this is not good this is\nnot smart work harder you should be\nworking someone else is going to get\nbetter than you someone else is going to\ncatch up and I'm\njust dying on the inside okay so when\nsomeone um when\nsomeone so when that voice says that to\nyou what happens inside\nyou I get\nanxious and do you have to listen to the\nvoice it's hard not to because the show\nI mean TV shows are there's a lot of\ndowntime in TV shows where someone's\njust talking and it's not that\ninteresting and in those moments I'm\njust thinking about everything else like\nyou should be doing this maybe you\nshould message this person and what\nsucks is sometimes my inner thought\nduring those shows is right where I'm\nlike oh [ __ ] I didn't do this oh I could\ndo this oh I maybe I should try this\nthing tomorrow and it it it actually\nhelps sometimes and so what sucks is\nthat 99,999 times it's not correct and\nit's annoying but that one time it is\nI'm like damn that's a good\nidea why do you have to pursue good\nideas to be to make sure I'm still doing\nwell because what does that mean doing\nwell but you are doing\nwell I I don't know to make sure I'm\ndoing the best I possibly can so so when\nI look back at this when I'm 50 years\nold and I say you know what good job you\nknow you you worked really hard but I\nknow what I'm 50 and if I keep working\nlike this I'm going to say you [ __ ] up\nmore than you possibly ever can imagine\nbecause you got to enjoy zero moments\nwhat's it like to not do the best you\npossibly\ncan um I feel like I'm a\nfailure okay\nthat's a\nproblem yeah I I just don't like feeling\nlike I I'm not doing the best I possibly\ncan because I say to myself wow you have\ninsane opportunities that no one else\nhas and you should be utilizing that\nopportunity and I just feel like I'm\nwasting it sometimes if I'm not trying\nto be the best because you know how does\nit feel to waste your opportunities\nit feels like I'm a failure I mean it\nreally does it really just feels like\nI'm not I'm letting myself down and\nthat's money that's a lot of money you\nknow it's it's it's tough to for me to\nreally say it's not a big deal and what\nhappens when you don't let yourself\ndown oh it feels like a two out of 10\nlike it feels like okay well you did\nwhat you're supposed to do it doesn't\nfeel great but when you don't do what\nyou're supposed to do I feel like a nine\nattend in stress cuz I'm like God\n[ __ ] damn it you idiot like you\n[ __ ] up so badly so it sounds to me\nlike you're kind of like\nstuck right so on the one hand you like\ngive into that voice you optimize and\neven if it's a long shot that one out of\na thousand makes it really important for\nyou to take that shot and even if you\nsucceed you're overly stressed you can't\neven enjoy your wins you can't even\nenjoy your downtime and if you don't\ngive into that voice then you're kind of\n[ __ ] up you're not like doing a great\njob you're letting all these\nopportunities go by so it sounds to me\nlike basically your life is dictated by\nlike the avoidance of one kind of pain\non any given day you're never moving\ntowards something you're moving away\nfrom\nsomething\nalways yeah and and and what sucks about\nbeing so stressed\nis not enjoying those times where you're\nsupposed to be having fun mhm makes it\nso you know all work and no play makes\nJack ad though boy like it really does\nmake you worse because yeah like you're\nstressed in those moments you're\nthinking about your your job so then I'm\nnot enjoying the time I'm supposed to be\nenjoying which results in me being more\nmiserable so it actually always has\nhurted my job it's never benefited me\nbeing stressed it's always hurt me it's\nnot good what do you think\nabout this person who is making\ndecisions in your\nlife uh I think this is not who I ever\nwanted to be who do you want to be I\nwant to be an\nidiot what does that mean I want I\nliterally just want to be like I don't\ncare I want to be I I used to be so\nCarefree when I was you know even in\ncollege and stuff and it's because I\nit's what I said I think when I was\nyounger it was just like hey you have\nhomework to do here's 17 things you can\ndo for homework and then when you do\nthat you're done you can know we study a\nlittle bit more yes but it's not as\nimportant what is the n how how do you\nhow does caring manifest within\nyou how does caring manifest in me how\ndo you know when you care versus you\ndon't care like if I I hyper focus on it\nwhen I think about it a lot okay when\nyou think about it a lot yeah but I hate\nthinking I don't want to think yeah CU\nWhen I Think I'm not entertaining I when\nI'm not thinking I'm fun as hell I'm\nfunny I'm great when I'm thinking so\nmuch I'm stressed I'm pissed what causes\nthinking the what causes thinking is is\nit's almost like a checklist that's\ninfinitely going in on my brain saying\nhey you need to do this you should be\ndoing this you shouldn't be enjoying\nyourself you should be working you could\nbe doing more you could be making more\nmoney you could be more successful you\nshould and that that checklist is an\ninfinite Loop that just hasn't turned\noff in years and I want to shut off I'm\ngoing to go ahead you going to read\nsomething no no go ahead no that's\nreally it I'm going to read some stuff\nto you so I wanted to be a cool guy I\nwanted other people to say he's cool I\nwant to relax I want to be the first\nperson who has a job what do you think\nabout those\nstatements sounds like a\ndouchebag it sounds like a guy that's\ngoing to be like my\nmom you know going to be like your mom\nis your\nmom\nright yeah so what's it like to be a\ndouchebag you know it sounds there's\nit's not even you're a douchebag a\ndouchebag is someone that doesn't care\nit's usually someone that's\njust but this sounds like a workaholic\nit sounds like someone that just\nconstantly like I want people to say\nlike oh my God he's so successful when\nthe truth is it's like does that really\nmatter no okay so I'm going to try to\ndraw some stuff out\nokay how's how how you feeling about\ntoday by the way what do you mean like\nhow do you feel about this\nconversation no I like it I the only\nproblem is I've had this monologue in my\nhead for years where I just like you\nknow stop being so stressed stop and\nthen I get stressed about being stressed\nand then my eye twitches now like I\ndon't know what the [ __ ] going on with\nme anymore okay I can't but what sucks\nthe most is I just wish I can just enjoy\nmoments like I wish I can\ncompartmentalize my life okay so I'm G\nto go ahead\nand let's see if this works can you see\nthis okay so let's try to understand\nthis\nokay\nso I don't know how exactly we're going\nto do this let's start with your\nparents so your parents were as you put\nat work AOL\nyeah and they didn't need to be\nWorkaholics right nope so what did they\ntell you growing\nup they told me\nto get a job go to\ncollege work after college live a normal\nlife okay what did they show you growing\nup show\nme what did they model for you\nuh my dad was much more relaxed and said\njust you know live life and do what you\nwant my mom was much more work work work\nput in effort try to be better um she\nwasn't necessarily pushy she wanted me\nto live a very average\nlife okay she wanted me to what did she\nmodel for you what did she do uh what\ndid she do she was an accountant no no\nlike like so she's so I guess this is\nkind of the point that I'm making so\nlike I've worked with some people\nwhose parents are alcoholics M and what\nthey tell their kids is don't ever drink\ndon't ever drink drinking is bad\ndrinking will ruin your life and what do\nyou think those kids end up doing\ndrinking absolutely\nwhy because [ __ ] you to the to the\nman right so so this is really important\nto\nunderstand as children we learn what our\nparents do not what they\nsay and further more one of the most\nconfusing things for a child is when\nyour parents tell you to do something\nand show you to do something\nelse I'll give you an example why the\n[ __ ] aren't you more confident you\nshould be confident in\nyourself why can't you stand up for\nyourself if a parent says that to a\nchild what do you think happens in the\nchild he becomes a a beacon of light of\nconfidence why I'm kidding he become he\nbecomes insecure why the parents are\ntelling him cuz I don't know maybe he\ngets nervous and starts overthinking it\nand is he\nconfident no and where is his lack of\nconfidence coming\nfrom it could be anything I mean why the\n[ __ ] aren't you confident M\nGIF what the [ __ ] is wrong with you you\nshould be more confident stand up for\nyourself his parent absolutely\nso I should hate my mom nope we're just\nstarting with your mom we're going to\nleave her far behind this is all you\nbuddy so the first thing is like I I I\nthink it's important to understand that\nwe do what our parents model like we're\nlike we use the same language so I\nremember when when my grandmother so my\nMy Grandmother Had A an injury when she\nwas a kid and so I I don't know if\nyou've seen this like this is like\ndefinitely true in my culture but I\nthink it's somewhat like Universal have\nyou ever seen like the old person sigh\nwhen they like sit down they're like oh\nhave you seen that like when old people\ndo that they're like oh my God like H so\nshe she would sigh she would do this\nlike old old lady grunt every time she\nwould sit down and I it was the funniest\ndamn thing so I when my daughter was\nlike one year old or like a year and a\nhalf she started sighing like an old\nperson every time she sat down and it\nwas like the funniest damn thing she's\nlike oh she's like this 18-month-old kid\nwho's like sighing like she's has been\non this Earth for 70 years and you just\ninternalize the behaviors the mannerisms\nlike it's really cute in her um but this\nis the first thing to understand right\nso you were taught from an early age\nthat like work is more important than\neverything else right so there's some\namount of like inheritance of workaholic\nnow some of this may even be genetic\nlike it's very surprising like what\npercentage of this could even be genetic\nso we have studies that show for example\nthat conscientiousness\nwhich is the ability to like move\nrelentlessly towards a goal is somewhat\ninherited there's also\nneuroticism which is the tendency to\nworry that is also somewhat\ninherited so if you look at people who\nare like medical students they're very\nhigh in both of these qualities because\nthey're like they work really hard and\nthey're super worried about if they\ndon't work hard what's going to happen\nso this results in kind of like this\nthis uh\nsituation where like basically they'll\nthey're Relentless they don't feel happy\nthey just work really hard they're\nstressed out all the time but what both\nof these things lead to is good outcomes\nso these are the kids that wind up in\nmedical school because they worked\nreally hard and they were stressed all\nthe time so they studied extra hard and\nthey were paranoid so this is just\nsomething of your background but we're\nwe're going to kind of steer a little\nbit away from this if that's okay with\nyou yep so here's the thing so when I\nlisten to you what I hear is someone who\nwho wants to\nbe so I hear someone who wants to be\nlet's say\naccepted so when you make people laugh\nthis is like a shortcut to acceptance\ndoes that resonate with you at all yeah\nso this too is very common I think we've\ntalked about this this is very common in\nADHD so an ADH huh do I have\nADHD you told me you had\nADHD no I I have severe ad I have the\nwor ADHD so so this is what happens in\nkids who have ADHD okay so what happens\nis by the second grade the average kid I\ndon't know if this is true but I've seen\nthis statistic seen this cited in some\nplaces get invited to zero birthday\nparties do you know why kids with ADHD\ndon't get invited did you get invited to\nbirthday parties because we're [ __ ]\nannoying why are you annoying because we\ndon't shut up okay right so when you\nrealize you you're you probably have an\nabove average IQ have you ever had your\nIQ tested I don't want to because I bet\nit's way lower than above\naverage I think it's probably not but\nfair enough um so this is what happens\nin in kids who have ADHD is like they\nrecognize their\ndeficits so what happens is you you so\nkids are actually really good at judging\nIQ and you probably recognized I mean I\nwould bet money that when you were\ngrowing up you got frustrated with\nyourself because you could tell that\nlike you're not stupider than these\nother kids that you're you're just as\nsmart as they they are but they you\ncan't do the things that they can do and\nhuh yeah it was so annoying and then\nwhat you sort of conclude is that like\nthere's something wrong with you you're\nkind of screwed up in some way yep so\nthere is a\ndissatisfaction with the\nself yep okay\nand so this is really\nimportant so one antidote to the\ndissatisfaction is to make other people\nlaugh because when you make other people\nlaugh what I'm listening but yeah that\nsounds accurate when you make other\npeople laugh\nlike where is your\nmind not there not there right where is\nthere I'm I A lot of times when I'm\ntrying to be funny I'm not even in\npresent thought I'm absolutely so this\nis really important to\nunderstand the reason this is euphoric\nis because most of the time you're in\nyour [ __ ] head and in your head\nthere's more to\ndo more to\noptimize\nmore to possibly [ __ ]\nup and you also have this like\ndirector's cut\nof self-\njudgment you know what I'm talking about\nno so like you're always thinking about\nyourself like it's not just there's like\na parallel track there's like I need to\noptimize this thing I need to do this\nthing for work I need but in the back of\nyour mind all of those things are driven\nby who you will be if you don't do\nthat does that resonate or no cuz I\nhaven't asked you these questions so\nthis could not may not oh yeah that's\nthat's pretty accurate okay because I've\nasked you a couple times what is the\nEuphoria and I I think you're having\ndifficulty with Words which is fine so\nI'm just filling in some of the gaps as\nI understand them okay so it's kind of\nlike cuz like if you do all this stuff\nyou won't be\nyou right yep and when you make other\npeople laugh you're not\nyou you're just like vibing with another\nhuman being you're out of your head\nyou're just kind of existing with them\nyall are kind of like you're creating\nsomething beautiful you're creating but\nyou're not you anymore your sense of\nself actually\ndisappears and so there's also a\ncorrelation between your sense of humor\nan inverse\ncorrelation so if we look at the degree\nof your self-referential\nthoughts okay which I'm going to call\nstress or even the activity of\nmind and we look at\nhumor so the more you think the less\nfunny you become so we want to go back\nto\nhere no thinking just vibing just\nhanging out with chat no pressure and if\nwe look at the nature of pressure or\nstress the nature of pressure or stress\nis increased thoughts\ndoes this make sense yeah so\nstress and thoughts go hand in\nhand so this too it's like what prevents\nyou from enjoying a show in relaxing\nthis gift what\nabsolutely right so you can't even relax\nbecause when your mind has idle time\nyour thoughts increase your stress\nincreases you become less funny\nso this keeps on like this is like a\ncycle and then furthermore we have this\nissue of like rock and hard place where\nif I\nrelax this is like I don't even know how\nto say this it's kind of like if if you\nrelax then you are\ninefficient yep and if you're\nefficient you'll feel better but this\ndoesn't really work nope right so if you\nreally look at it like it is the fear of\ninefficiency that keeps you from\nrelaxing and it is the fear of something\nelse that like keeps you going like you\nalways have to work you have to work you\nhave to\nwork cuz if you relax then you're being\ninefficient and if you're inefficient\nlike you'll turn into something I don't\nknow what but you don't want to be that\nright you don't want to be that guy you\nwant to be the first the person who has\nthe first job in your class you want to\nbe the cool guy you want to be liked you\nwant to be\nrespected you want to be valued now the\nquestion is cuz when when you make\npeople\nlaugh right you're valued that's how you\nknow they're laughing Miz that was\n[ __ ] hilarious bro you just made my\nday that's your poison that's your\naddiction yep right so now the question\nbecomes why why are you so addicted to\nthis what do you\nthink why am I so addicted to making\npeople\nlaugh it it's it's weird because I feel\nlike I'm as much as I'm addicted to\nmaking people laugh I'm also addicted\nto business and growth and money and\nstuff like that that's the stress that\nis the exact opposite of me being funny\nand entertaining yes very good right so\nthose appear to be opposites but I don't\nthink you're addicted to\nopposites I think it's just one thing\nwith two\nmanifestations so this is what's kind of\nweird I think there's there's something\nwithin you that you're unhappy with\nyourself does this make sense yeah so\nthis is what's kind of weird so even\nyour desire for relaxation this is so\nhard to string together but okay so\nlet's say like version number one\nversion 1.0 is not having friends\ngrowing\nup but I did have friends growing up\nokay that's what it is statistically for\nmost kids with ADHD so what why did you\nwant to be first the first kid in your\nschool to get a job oh I looked cool\nokay so looked cool now we want to think\nabout let's understand this because\nthere's a lot in those two words\nwhat kind of kid wants to look cool one\nwith insecurities right so if you want\nto look cool does that mean you are cool\nor are uncool you're uncool are uncool\nnow here's the crazy\nthing even if you accomplish your goal\nwill you be\ncool no why\nnot because being cool\nis it's I feel like it's a mindset more\nthan is a absolutely so already hold on\nI cuz you're setting yourself up to fail\nhere right cuz you want to look\ncool so this is the problem you feel you\nare cool and even if you accomplish your\ngoal does it Circle back and fix this\nnope nope so now I'm drinking water but\nI'm still\nthirsty doesn't\nwork so now we we get to maybe version\n2.0 at some point so then you sort of\nend up becoming a content creator and\nyou make people laugh and when you make\npeople laugh do you look\ncool no you\ndon't think about\nit are you cool absolutely do you look\ncool often times you're\nundignified you don't think me making\npeople laugh makes it makes me think I'm\nmakes people think I'm\ncool I think it makes you cool I don't\nthink it makes you look cool I think\noften times the things that we do when\nwe are when we make others laugh are\nactually\nundignified what does that undignified\nmean you're like sometimes debasing\nyourself I think there's there's a\nchadness to it there is a chadness to it\nbut sometimes you look like an idiot\nwhen you make people laugh sometimes you\nlook like an idiot that's what I would\nsay yeah but I I I I genuinely enjoy\nlooking like an idiot\nyeah so if you Fe if you are cool then\nyou can look like an\nidiot right but when you're not cool you\ncan't look like an\nidiot it's weird though a lot of times\nwhen I'm like really funny I feel like\nI'm the coolest because it's like I\ndon't think there's many people that can\ndo that like anyone can be successful\nanyone can have nice clothes not many\npeople can make people laugh I agree but\nthat so so what what happens to your\nestimation of yourself when you make\npeople\nlaugh it goes up absolutely you value\nyourself right so this is like this is\nthe key thing is my screen share working\nwith you yeah okay see right because\nwhen you say not many people can do that\nnow I want you to just this is so subtle\nbut when you say not many people can do\nthat you are not you're not talking\nabout how it looks you were talking\nabout the value of it if I say a diamond\nis a beautiful thing because it is rare\nis not saying that a diamond is pretty\nor that people like the way that a\ndiamond looks that is talking about an\nintrinsic value of the diamond because\nof its\nworth you are contributing to society\nwhen you make people laugh yep looking\ncool we're not and there's no first or\nlast you're not even saying I need to\nmake people laugh more than other\npeople I need to be the first person you\nyou see like all the comparative\nstatements disappear\nI know it's like subtle maybe it's\nwrong but so there's no like first or\nlast right you don't give a [ __ ] like\nI'm not hearing you say if you make\nsomeone laugh and then someone else\nmakes someone laugh how do you\nfeel I got to do it again like you you\ngot to you got to one up\nthem\nuh not yeah kind of a little bit okay so\nI think there's some of that flavor\nthere fair enough\nbut like I don't know if this makes\nsense but when you say not many people\ncan do that that is a statement of value\nyeah not many people can really make\nsomeone actually laugh I most people can\nget that like but no one not many people\ncan be like wow that like I'm actually\nlaughing like right so so when when you\ndo that you feel really good about\nyourself yeah right so that's euphoria\nthat is also like outside of your head\nlike it's it's getting rid of\nthis and that's like\nEuphoria now there are a couple of other\nthings here which is like we got to be\nsuper careful so when you are unhappy\nwith\nyourself right so you want to be\nmore I think that's part of the reason\nyou are a Serial\n[Music]\nentrepreneur and then also if you're\nunhappy with yourself you need to be\nbetter\nyeah right and if you need to be better\nyou need to be more\nefficient because efficiency is better\ngot to hit three\nbirds with one stone yeah or 10 or\n10 and you're so good that you can even\ndo that but the problem is that much\nlike this water this whole water thing\nlike it doesn't it doesn't actually fix\nyour problem and even now\nwhen you've achieved what you set out to\nachieve you're unhappy and this is where\nthings are going to get really subtle so\nwould you like me to teach you work life\nbalance Miz yes okay so your desire for\nwork life balance is a manifestation of\nthis thing it is the same problem I need\nto be better Miz needs to be better by\nstarting one company by starting seven\ncompanies now I need to be better by\ngetting more work life balance it's the\nsame problem you're you're not willing\nto accept or be happy with\nyourself yeah you see that that's why it\ndoesn't work because it's stemming from\nover here now we need work life\nbalance and if I get better at work life\nbalance then I will be better it's just\nanother optimization it's the same\n[ __ ] thing this is really important\nto understand I could be wrong but do\nyou see what I'm saying yeah no\ncompletely true right and so then you're\nlike okay I'm going to take lud\nOlan and I'm going to do this and I'm\ngoing to listen to this and I'm going to\nlearn this and I'm going to meditate and\nI'm going to do this and I'm going to do\nall these things because I'm not happy\nwith the person that I am right now so\nI'm going to fix\nit not going to\nwork yeah it\ndoesn't weird right so how do you fix\nthis\nstop talking to my\nmom your mom is not to blame for this\nokay I'm not sure honestly do you want\nto fix it I try to fix it I've I've done\neverything you said I go to the gym yeah\nyou tried to fix it right so those are\nall work life balances do you want to\nfix it yeah absolutely you\nsure yes I I this mental state that I'm\nin is not one that\nI I I I the thing is it's one thing if I\nwas like very unsuccessful right like\nlet's say I was like you know I just got\na free therapy session from you and I\nwas just not doing well but like I am in\na spot where I should be happy like it I\nwhen I was at my 10-year-old self I said\ndude if you're ever like this you should\nbe happy but I'm here and I'm still\nwanting more because numbers can always\ngo up I but I know that that's a toxic\nway to live because numbers can always\ngo up and you'll never be happy no\nmatter what if you just keep going that\nroute exactly right so so this is where\nlike we're we're getting to a point\nwhere like so so so now I mean I think\nthis is going to be really hard but\nthere's very important things to\nunderstand here so the first is like\nthis is going to happen as long as this\nis at the root yep now here's the\nproblem so we can talk about how to\naddress this so we're going to like I'm\ngoing to introduce a couple Concepts to\nyou okay the first is like activity of\nthe\nmind a lot of your momentto moment piece\nso there's like two or three different\nissues here the first is how can we help\nyou be happy in one day and then the\nsecond is how can we help you maintain\nthat happiness over\ntime these are like actually like two\nseparate issues so first thing is that\nthe more active your mind is the less\nhappy you'll\nbe yep so what results in an increase in\nthoughts in the mind what do you\nthink uh\nnot being happy with myself okay\nunhappiness sure so there's a couple of\nother things that we're going to learn\nhere so sensory\ninput so you said that you stared at a\nwall for 12 hours yep and what happened\nto you over the course of those 12\nhours I felt like my mind raced like\ncrazy for about an hour and then I kind\nof just was more\nI don't know I just feel like my brain\nworked I felt like it was Cog like the\ncogs were turning not in a bad way okay\nso let's understand this right so let's\nsay here's your mind the more sensory\ninput I get the more thoughts I create\nin my mind let's say each of these\ncreates a thought is sensory input\nsomething like even going on like like\nlike checking messages and stuff like\nthat absolutely that is the number one\nform of sensory input right so then what\nhappens is each of these like little\nthings in the mind actually has its own\nmomentum so I would say it's kind of\nlike a these are actually thoughts this\nis what happens it's not just one\nthought that then disappears we then\nplay with the thought so you get an\nemail message and then what happens is\nlike you're thinking about the email\nmessage should I do this should I do\nthis should I do this so one thought\nactually becomes many thoughts and each\nof these branches off and each of these\nbranches off and since you're managing\nseven companies this means that you've\ngot seven sets of inputs so your mind is\n[ __ ] overwhelmed all the time\nyep so this is probably what your\nthoughts feel like they don't come and\ngo they start to spiral and branch and\nthen they become\nthis y okay so this is what your mind is\ncluttered with so what do we do to fix\nthat when you stare at a wall you get no\ninput so what ends up happening is this\nkind of goes like this but then it\nstarts to like\nfizzle and then it'll eventually stop so\nthis thought over here starts to slow\ndown maybe it picks up a little bit and\nthen it starts to slow down and then\nthis one is like going really really\nstrong for a while and then it's like\nokay let's slow down because if the mind\ndoesn't have any input it has no nothing\nelse to play with yeah right so you\ncan't like read one book and for the mo\nlike let's say you read a book and then\nthe after at the end there's a big\nclimax you're like oh my God that was\n[ __ ] awesome you're thinking about it\nfor a little while you're like that was\ngreat that was great it's not like\nyou're happy for the next 40 years\nfilled with excitement because you read\none great\nbook thoughts in the mind fizzle if they\nare not\nfed what's going on right now is you are\nfeeding your mind so many stressful\nthoughts that then pile on to this in\nsome way so this is like your your base\nof operations and then something about\nthese thoughts will like pile onto\nthem does this make sense or not so much\nyou can Yar okay this is exactly how it\nis okay okay so the first thing that we\nneed to do is recognize that the more\ntime you have this thought\ninput the worse things are going to be\nand furthermore watching a show doesn't\nwork because watching a show you here's\nthe the show let's try to create a\nrelaxing thought but you have all these\nmind spirals that are going on and they\nkeep on interjecting so you can't relax\nlike this one thought is over here but\nlook at all these like past inputs that\nare like lingering in the mind or like\nthe Jo will say something and I'll be\nlike [ __ ] I forgot or I have to do this\nor I should do that like right so it's\nit's thoughts popping into the mind and\nif you if you have a neurodiverse brain\nand you have ADHD this problem is\nexacerbated wait neurodiverse doesn't\nthat mean I'm stupid no oh it just means\nthat the way that your well so this is a\nthis is a a concept of that has like\ndifferent sides to it so some people\nbelieve that neurodiversity is a\ndebilitation I think there's a\nreasonable argument for that so so you\ncould say that people who are on the\nautism spectrum and people who have ADHD\nfor example are like they're\nthey're they have like a negative aspect\nto their brain their brain malfunctions\nthere's another Camp of people that says\nthat their brains are different and that\nin the current Society it acts as a\nmalfunction but there is not something\nfundamentally wrong with the person I\nthink both approaches are like\nreasonable I've SE I don't I don't\nreally care I okay for me\nI'm like I like being stupid like that\nmy favorite time of my life is when my\nbrain is off and I'm act like an idiot\nyes your brain is off right that's the\nopposite this is and this is where humor\ncomes in so humor comes when your brain\nis like this because humor it's\nfascinating you can even look at the\nmaybe I'll pull up a paper a little bit\nlater but you you can you can look at\nlike the science of the Neuroscience of\nhumor is absolutely fascinating how in\nhow nonl logical humor is you can't\nthink your way into being funny and in\nfact if you dissect a joke it kills the\nhumor yeah the the key to humor is just\nconfidence in being an\nidiot well\nsaid right and then the question is like\nin the brain where does that come from\nlike who knows so you want an empty head\nyou want to be an idiot fair enough yeah\nbecause I can like I the thing is that\nbrain you're looking at the you know\nNaruto seven\nchakras that that\nthat brain is one that uh you know it's\nunderstandable I did this you know I had\nto work hard make a lot of money and I\nI've had a you know you don't want to\nmiss your opportunities you have for the\nyears you're in but now I'm like dude\nI'm 30 like I'm I've been in this for\nsix years now when am I going to start\nhaving that brain again because I\ndeserve it like you did your time you've\ngot the money you did the things but now\nyour brain is worse than it was before\nit's because you piled on so much crap\num so Hy obsessive growing this is this\nis is so this is not just you right so\nsome people may say like oh like you\nwere saying it's it's cringe to say that\nyou're running seven companies or\nwhatever I don't think that this matters\nwhether you're a successful person\nunsuccessful\nperson whether you're a Serial\nentrepreneur or you're homeless like it\ndoesn't matter as long as your mind is\nlike this you will be unhappy yes simple\nI know this isn't just correlated with\nme I know many people feel the right so\nso now the question becomes how how do\nwe stop this from happening so this is\nwhere we get to a couple of really\nconcrete concrete concrete things that\nwe can think about the first is have you\never talk to your mom about being a\nworkaholic no okay because she's working\nhuh she's too busy\nworking there it is again right so now\nwe've decompressed you a little bit and\nthe humor shines through right that's\nand that's thing that sucks is I want to\njust be like an idiot as much as I can\nyeah so you want something I want to be\nan idiot what does wanting when you want\nto be an\nidiot what happens to your okay so I'm\ngoing to draw another one okay so I know\nyou're not the smartest kid on the\nBlock um but so let's say let's say this\nis being an idiot so this is being a big\nidiot this is being a little idiot and\nif I want to be an idiot what does this\ndo to my capacity for idiocy\nright so there's two options one\nis the more that I want to be an idiot\nthe stupider I become the other option\nis\nthat the more I want to be an idiot the\nless of an idiot I become and then I\nguess the third option is that there it\nMak there's no correlation no I think\nthe more I'm an idiot the smarter I\nam the more I'm an idiot the smarter I\nam so what ha what about the wanting to\nbe an idiot\nthe more you want to be an idiot does it\nbecome easier to be an idiot or harder\nto become an\nidiot uh harder absolutely right you're\nthinking this is the right\nanswer so this is what's really weird as\nlong as you want not going to work idiot\nidiocy is\nspontaneous right I mean all you have to\ndo is play any video game on the\ninternet that is multiplayer and you\nwill see how man these noobs on the\ninternet they can pull ID they can throw\ngames that are unable the depth of\nidiocy on the Internet is\nunparalleled and they're sure surely not\ntrying right you like to throw that hard\nand to be that stupid you can't even try\nit's like some Brilliance of its own\nsomething happening with you are you\ntraumatized from like valerin or\nsomething DOTA yeah well well\ndone Dr mff um so first thing I you know\nthis is just something I encourage\npeople to do I would I don't know how\nthis is going to have an impact on\nanything I would talk to your mom about\nbeing a\nworkaholic okay I will like I I would\njust have a conversation with her I I\ndon't think she's bad or anything I I\nthink just asking her hey mom like you\nknow I noticed you worked a lot\nsometimes I got the impression you\ndidn't need to work what was your\nexperience like growing\nup right and and then you'll be amazed\nat how much you can learn from like her\nexperience and you may even find that\nit's almost like talking to yourself\nand and and I I think just in general\nlike we don't do a great job of like\nconnecting with our parents and like\nsometimes having a conversation with\nthem about our impression of what our\nupbringing was like not to try to blame\nthem and be like mom you never came to\nmy baseball party and like why like I\nmean if you want to share that you can\nbut I think it's more just like hey what\nwhat was going on inside of you when you\nwere like working so\nmuch and and she may say oh it's because\nI needed to all this stuff for you and\nyou can like politely push back against\nthat and I'm like I'm not sure that you\nneeded to do that much I'm wondering if\nthere was something else to\nit and then if you want to you can even\nshare with her like what your experience\nis yeah because it's interesting my\ndad's much more like the idiot where he\njust you know he worked for sure but he\nmuch more was relaxed and funnier and my\nmom was much more of a workaholic but\nshe was so much more cold like very\ncold yeah so there there may be\nsomething there I I just think it's like\nwe don't you know a lot of times we\nthink that parenting stops when your\nchildren become adults and I think it's\nreally sad but I see so many adults that\nI work with that are scared to have\ntheir parents continue\nparenting but like parents are here even\nfor this stage of your life right when\nyou're 30 and like trying to figure out\nlike what the next 30 years of your life\nare going to be like and and having a\nconversation with them about hey you\nguys said that I should relax like I\ncan't like yep can you help me with this\nso that's the first thing and unless\nyou're really in a Frank abusive or\nneglectful relationship like I think\nit's really good to like talk to your\nparents okay I'll talk to them um second\nthing is is when you're\nrelaxing I would do so without sensory\ninput so I would let cuz when you're\nadding new thoughts from the show it's\nnot going to work you need to think\nabout your mind as a top you know like a\ntop that spins how do you get a top to\nstop or actually this is the way you\nshould think about forget about the top\nthink about your mind is a a pool that\nhas like a pool of water that has a lot\nof\nripples okay so I'll tell you a\nstory so uh a student once went to their\nzen master and they said master so the\nthe the [ __ ] a this I kind of [ __ ]\nup the story but whatever so the the the\nstudent comes to the master and the the\nmaster says that I need you to get this\nlike water to stop having Ripples and so\nwhat the the student does is a bad story\nI butchered it already but what the\nstudent does tries to push the waves\ndown he tries to push the ripples down\nthey like try to get it to stay still\nthey try to get it to stay still they\ntry to get it to stay still but if if I\ntry to push the ripples down in a pool\nof water what's going to happen\nit's going to be worse\nabsolutely so what's the right way to\nget a pool of water to be\nstill get Russell out of the pool don't\ndon't um yeah yeah don't I mean\nobviously have nothing in the going on\nyeah right so you need\nStillness and like your mind craves\nStillness even if we talk about your\nexperience of euphoria what is it it's\nStillness in the\nmind even when we see that genuine humor\nstart to peek through for you even in\nthis conversation there's moments of\nStillness right it's like it's like even\nwhen you make a joke you leave this\nconversation and you go to an oasis does\nthat make sense I do like I notice it\nlike I notice he's gone he's in a\ndifferent place and sometimes that may\nbe frustrating people I wouldn't\ndiscourage you from doing that I think\ngo to your Oasis and that's what humor\nis it feels like an oasis and all of\nthis mess what we're going to do is\nwe're just going to take one chunk\nand we're going to make one chunk of\nyour mind disappear and now there's one\narea that is protected this is what a\njoke is in the middle of a\nconversation y so when you're relaxing\ndon't do\nanything and notice that when you're\nrelaxing there is going to be a torrent\nof mental\nactivity now we get to the hard part\nwhich is\ninaction the other thing that you need\nto learn how to do is stop\nacting so there's going to be a thousand\ndifferent messages in your mind of like\nthings you can do in ways that you can\noptimize you need at least some time in\nthe day let's say this is your whole day\nsome time in the day to not\nact this is going to be very hard for\nyou can you imagine why because my\nmind's overacting because I have ADHD\nthat's one there's even a harder reason\nbecause I put so much work and effort\nyeah good getting closer right so this\nis going to be the cost of\ninaction if you if you are not active\nit's going to cost you a\nlot do you understand what I mean or not\nreally I'm not active it's going to cost\nme a lot right so why do you need to be\nefficient why do you need to be working\nall the\ntime uh you can be doing more\nyeah to try to be successful and try to\nso so what does it cost you to not act\nyou're going to be doing\nless can you do\nless I could I I know I could what makes\nit hard for you to do\nless\nI am almost I feel like addicted to what\nI do like I very good we're going to get\nto that in a\nsecond so when you say you are addicted\nor let's get to it now what is the\nnature of that addiction how do you know\nyou're addicted what does that addiction\nlook\nlike uh I'm\nconstantly thinking about it non-stop\nevery second of the day checking\nmessages thinking that there's messages\nthinking there's something I need to do\nit's just taking over my entire life it\nhasn't taken over your entire life it's\ntaken over one very specific part of\nyour\nlife which part\nmy brain absolutely your\nmind my mind or pie yeah right that's\nthe only part it's taken over and then\nthe Mind runs the rest of the\nshow so this is like this is really\ntricky to understand but like you have a\nmental habit this is something called a\nvasana yeah I do have a mental habit\nyeah right so you have a this\nhabituation of I need to do this I need\nto do this I need to do this and be\nprepared for this because if you stop\ndoing that your mind will scream at you\nit'll say but this could go wrong and\nyou hit these 10 birds with one stone\nthrow the stone bro the efficiency is so\nworth it you need to act you need to act\nyou need to\nact and what is it being driven by it is\nbeing driven by\nthis because if you don't act you will\nbe unhappy with\nyourself but you're unhappy with\nyourself no matter what even when you\ntry to fix the unhappiness in yourself\nit doesn't get happier yep doesn't work\nthe way to fix the unhappiness in\nyourself is not to solve your problems\nit is to shortcircuit\nit that's what happens when you make a\njoke no more unhappiness it gets\nunplugged do you understand the\ndifference chasing after something is\nnot going to work if it would have\nworked you would be happy by\nnow so this is going to be hard for you\nmisg because when you move towards\ninaction your mind will Rebel it will be\nlike an addiction you will go through\nwithdrawals yeah yeah I could see that\nI've I've had a feeling when I've like\nfor like a day I don't do anything like\nthat and I get very antsy and angry and\nstressed right so just like any\nwithdrawal process the\ndiscomfort Rises and then over time\nit'll fall this is what you have to do\nyou have to do this otherwise you're\ngoing to keep doing what you're doing\nright right so you have to like set\naside the time for work and this gets\nlike this becomes all very much more\ndifficult with ADHD because there's\nproblems with impulse control there's\nproblems with emotional regulation\nthere's all kinds of intersections for\nwhy people with ADHD become\nWorkaholics so there's like I guess\nlet's just go through those so here is a\nquick rundown of why people with ADHD\nactually become\nWorkaholics and compare we think about\nsome as ADHD is something that is\ndebilitating but I have seen people with\nADHD who are incredibly\nsuccessful and the reason is because\ntheir ADHD makes them vulnerable to\nworkcool being a workaholic the first\nthing is that they're\nimpulsive and if you look at someone\nwho's a workaholic someone who's work a\nworkaholic is someone who's working 24\nhours a day which means that when you\nhave an idea at 708 p.m.\non a Sunday evening oh [ __ ] let me send\nan email yep you do it yep whereas\nneurotypical people will be like it's my\nday\noff the thing is the world rewards you\nfor this holy [ __ ] this guy is sending\nemails at 7:08 on a\nSunday right issue number one second\nthing emotionally\ndisregulated which\nmeans that as you feel unhappy with\nyourself\nso this is important to understand\nunhappiness from a neuroscientific and\nevolutionary perspective is a source of\nmotivation so the more unhappy that you\nfeel with yourself the more action you\nwill take right that's why our body\nmakes us feel unhappy I don't like\nfeeling hunger anytime the body punishes\nyou it is to induce\naction hunger and thirst will cause\nhuman beings to kill each\nother lust will cause lust is a\ndissatisfaction\ncan even induce things like sexual\nassault right so unhappiness is a very\npowerful motivator for action and what\nwe see in people with ADHD is that their\nuh lyic\nsystem is prone to experience a lot of\nactivities this is their emotional\nCircuit of the brain so there's an\nemotional disregulation and then those\nemotions can really Drive drastic\nBehavior the third thing that's really\ninteresting is we haven't really talked\nabout this but but there's also a\nparadoxical\nhyperfocus so we haven't talked about\nthis but I'm curious right so when it\ncomes to being an\nentrepreneur I would guess that there\nare periods of time where you can really\ngrind yeah right and so then what\nhappens is like there's no balance but\nover here during your rest time you have\nthis intrusive impulsive thought to do a\nlittle bit more\nwork but by the way you woke up at 7\na.m. on Sunday and worked until 5:00\np.m.\nanyway so this can induce like you can\nhave intense periods of work but then\nyou don't get a break yeah so all of\nthis stuff can really result in like\nactually being a\nworkaholic and then the the other thing\nthat's correlated with workaholic is\nthat you do have a dopamine\nsensitivity so sometimes some of the\nrewards from work will really like hit\nyou way better actually we we see this\nactually you have a great example of\nthis 999 times it's a waste of effort\nbut one time it's amazing it's amazing\ndo you know what that you know what that\nsame part of your brain makes you\nvulnerable to one kind of addiction do\nyou know what it is particularly\nvulnerable what's the addiction that\npeople have where 999 times out of a\nthousand they fail but the one success\nout of a thousand gets them to keep\ngoing can you guess child birth huh\ngaming child birth\nthat's great okay gambling\nabsolutely\nright so\nchild so that's what that\nis so even so this is really important\nto understand when people are dopamine\nsensitive they are\nimpervious to negative\nconsequences this is what dopamine\nsensitivity does it causes us to not\nthink about the negative and makes us\nvulnerable to like lopsided views of the\npositive and results in things like\ngambling addiction spoton right so when\nyou have this set of things you're very\nlikely to be a workaholic it actually\ncan work out really\nwell which is why sometimes people with\nADHD are very very successful and this\nis also where there's a there's like a\nlot of like you know there's a growing\nmovement in parts of Academia but\nprimarily in like the social media space\nto stop viewing ADHD as an illness\nbecause some people have discovered this\noh it's not anous I mean it could be the\nworst thing in the world for you but it\ncould be the best thing if you can\nmanifest and make ADHD work it's it's\namazing yeah so I think people see this\nand so a lot of people when we see these\npeople in our in like our community too\nyou'll have people who are like\nprogrammers at places like Google and\nstuff who have really bad ADHD but man\ncan they be like coding\nfiends it's like it's crazy how much you\ncan accomplish just people with ADHD are\ntold that they can't do anything but\nthey can\nyeah so I think there's also like your\nmileage may vary I've worked with plenty\nof patients with ADHD who don't seem to\nhave some of these advantages and for\nwhom it can be quite debilitating and\ncrippling but I think that there's a\nspectrum which is why it's not one way\nor the\nother but I think going back to this I I\nthink you've got to be super careful\nabout your addiction so recognize that\nyou have a mental habit and the mental\nhabit means that your mind will\nreflexively do some of these things\nthe main mental Habit to really watch\nout for is this is the most important\nthing the desire to fix\nyourself this is really\nimportant because your your brain will\ntell you like if we don't if we do this\nwe will be better if we do this we will\nbe better if we do this we will be\nbetter and in wanting to be better you\nare actually reinforcing your\nunhappiness can you connect those two\ndots or does it not make sense no it\nmakes perfect sense because it's the\nNaruto lines it's you're just yeah like\nit's ties and everything with the\ngambling it's like yeah well 999 times\nit won't be right but you'll get that\none time you'll say oh wow I did it but\nyou'll just think about those other n\nyou'll do it again and your brain will\njust you know you'll have four bad days\nin a row of stress and anger but that\none second in the shower where you had a\ngood idea you're like wow was it this\nwas worth it but it's not it's never\nworth it okay great\nlike so so I I I think articulating that\nis very important but recognize that\nright so you're going to have that\nmental habit\nof always thinking about the\nupside right so there's another aspect\nof this which I think is that see when\nyou're unhappy with yourself and you do\nsomething to improve your\nlife it reinforces the idea that the\ncurrent version of you is unacceptable\nokay so like if I'm unhappy with the way\nthat I look and I get\nBOTOX what does that do to my\nself-esteem it doesn't do anything I\nfeel like it kind of makes you worse\nabsolutely and we see that right once\nyou get on the Cosmetic Surgery train\nlike it's hard to get\noff and so this is what's really crazy\nis like what you really need to learn uh\nMiz is acceptance of Who You Are you\ndon't need to be better and this is\ngoing to be very difficult because this\nis very Dee rooted goes from when you\nwere a kid goes to I want to be the\nfirst what does first mean that is a\nrelative thing it is an you're right\nit's an insecurity it's this idea that I\nam not good enough the way that I am\nright now that's why you need to be the\nfirst person with a job that's why six\ncompanies is not enough seven companies\nis is not enough but the whole problem\nis that none of those things is just\nlike botox you do it and you do it and\nyou do it but the underlying thing that\nmakes you unhappy with yourself is not\ngetting\nfixed and 15 companies won't fix it your\ncompany's being worth a billion dollars\nor a trillion dollars won't be enough to\nfix it well maybe but yeah know\nmaybe right so this is where like it's\ngoing to be hard I want you to be like\nmentally prepared that when you stop\ndoing as much work your mind will Rebel\nand it'll beat you up yep it'll be like\nand and so this is where like I know it\nsounds kind of weird but like you got to\nask yourself in that moment like would\nan idiot do this an idiot would not go\nout and do all of these things so you\nneed to like that's that self-acceptance\nI think your path is going to be through\nbeing an idiot an idiot is\nIdol yeah but it'll come it's funny I\nfeel much more ex you know I feel when\nI'm being an idiot and being fun it's\nlike that yeah like that person is much\nmore liked in any circumstance with with\nfriends or people in general like it the\nmoney and the power and the the\nbusinesses and all that stuff it it does\nabsolutely nothing the people like more\nis an idiot they like someone that's\nmore fun to hang out with than someone\nthat's who do you like I don't care what\nother people like who do you like more\noh I like the idiot I mean I just\ngenuinely have more fun so choose\nyourself yeah right and some of that\ninvolves self-acceptance and if you can\nget a couple of these foundations like\nthe main thing uh Miz is I like the way\nthat I see your life right now you have\nweight the reason it's so overwhelming\nis because you have so much momentum all\nyou need to start all you need to stop\ndoing is feeding the Beast you don't\nactually need to fix anything you just\nneed to stop [ __ ] it up so should I\njust stop uh like what can I do to have\nthose like sensory moments where I just\nlike like staring at a Wallace type\nstuff so so I I mean I think this is\nlike there's a there's a personal aspect\nto this right so this is like a general\nprinciple that applies to all\nWorkaholics now the specifics for you so\ni' start with conversation with your mom\nI I think you take walks right we've\ntalked yeah I I take walks every night\nand how do you feel about those walks uh\nI usually feel kind of better but those\nwalks do make me think a lot because I'm\nalso it's silence yeah so make you think\na lot is okay so remember that think the\nYour solution to stop thinking is to let\nyourself think a lot for a very long\ntime without external stimulation don't\ngive into the thoughts so if you think I\nneed to send send this email I need to\ndo this I need to do this I need to do\nthis I need to do this just let those\nthoughts come and go your mind will\nremind you it's keeping track of\neverything you don't need to breathing\nexercis I should do would you do them\nwell it like let's say like my brain's\nreally racing like I should do this I\nshould do this like [ __ ] I didn't do\nthis I'm an idiot for not should I just\nlike should I just is like a breathing\nexercise I should do in that\nmoment let me think\nso there are absolutely breathing\nexercises you can do in the moment what\nI am scared of is that if we teach you a\nbreathing exercise it will be a\nsomething that allows us to patch you up\nand send you back into battle as opposed\nto really addressing this at the root do\nyou understand the difference I'm not\nsaying we're not going to teach it to\nyou so it's fine we can teach you that\nbut don't this needs to change on a\nfundamental level it can't change just\nthrough breathing exercises yep\nbreathing can help and in that I would\nteach you something very simple called\nnari which I can teach you now if you\nwant yep okay so sit up straight back\nstraight neck straight is your butt\nperpendicular to the ground are you like\nleaning I was yeah you got to sit up\nthere we go okay take your\nhand fold these two\nfingers yep down good so so take your\nthumb block this nostril breathe\nin now we're going to do a little bit of\na\nTwist no no no fold the fingers fold the\nfingers yeah there you go breathe\nout breathe in\nagain twist breathe out\nin\nswitch\nout okay now you do one round and I'll\nfollow you so breathe\nin what comes\nnext good and then\nout and then what comes next got to\nbreathe in again\nand then and then out\ngood and then breathe in\nagain\nswitch\nout okay we're going to pause for a\nsecond so can you walk me through what\nthe right sequence\nis yeah\nit's breathe in good you do this with\nyour fingers yeah breathe in switch Yeah\nbreathe out good breathe in switch\nbreathe out okay so you always switch\nwith a full breath of a full lung of air\nyeah okay so now we're going to ask you\nto close your eyes and you're going to\ndo it on your own for about three\nminutes and everyone is going to do it\nwith\nyou okay okay actually do you find it uh\ndistracting is it harder to close your\neyes so you try closing your eyes see if\nit makes it harder or easier\nokay and you can keep going I'll keep\ntrack of time\nokay\ne\ne for\nnext\nstraight you're doing\ngreat got about one minute left\ntry to slow down the breathing a little\nbit fill up your lungs all the way slow\ndown the exhalation make it nice and\nslow feel your body slowly sink in good\nso when you're done with that last\nexhalation you can go ahead and\nrelax you do this stuff because it makes\nyou think about that instead of thinking\nabout other things partially\nyou're correct very\ninsightful right so the thing about some\nof these meditative breathing exercises\nis that if they're too easy they become\nboring and if they become boring what\nhappens to the Mind miss\ngif very\ngood so what I want you to focus on is\nkeeping your posture perfect no tilting\nhead to the\nside right so stay upright you can have\na slight upturn of your your neck\nand try to stay try to move only the\nmuscles that you're moving and move\nnothing else the more intensely\nconcentrative we make the practice the\neasier it will be for\nyou the second thing is some people with\nADHD find that half lied gaze like this\nis actually easier than fully eyes open\nor eyes\nclosed there's some evidence that people\nwith\nADHD in the complete absence of sensory\nstate Uli their brain will try to self\nstimulate so this is why sometimes White\nNoise machines will help people focus or\nlistening to music or fall asleep\nbecause something about some amount of\nmild amount of sensory input will\nactually calm your mind down because\nyour mind has something to kind of it's\nlike in the complete absence of\nsomething your mind will generate all\nkinds of stuff yeah so eyes open while\nmeditation is sometimes easier for\npeople with ADHD\nwhat was that practice like for you this\nyeah it was nice yeah I I usually I do\noh God I do breathing exercises it's\nusually only for like 30 seconds I I\nnever did it for three minutes it\nactually was way better yeah so three\nminutes and then there's there's more\nstuff that I'll I can teach you the next\ntime we meet in\nperson but this is um this is a good\nplace to start yeah\nI'll call my mom do you have uh do you\nwant to just kind of summarize for us\nlike what you're taking away from\ntoday's conversation if\nanything um I learn I learned that a lot\nof my problems could be rooted through\neither genetics or from what I learned\nfrom my parents because my parents told\nme not to do it but I actually when you\nsee your parents doing it it makes you\ndo it which just me being a workaholic\nand\num I\nneed to do things that are not trying to\nbe less stimulated because when you try\nthat's going to make you more stimulated\nwhich is kind of similar to the idea of\nyour parents where it's like you're\nyou're being told hey don't you know try\nto do something but the thing is what\nyou need to do is just uh not try to\nthink which uh you know like trying to\ndistract yourself with TV shows and\nstuff is not the smartest route and\nthing is it's an addiction and what I\nneed to do to beat that addiction is to\njust not do it um because it's going to\nbe really hard but when it's that's\nreally hard which\nuh you know it's going to be for at\nleast a while I have to beat it which\ncan take a long time so I I would think\nabout your mind so stress is increased\nthoughts in the\nmind this is number one thing to\nunderstand so the more active your mind\nis the more stressed you will be and\neven if we look at some of these things\nlike Flow State flow state is not\nparallel tracks of mind the problem is\nthat you always have more than one track\nthat will be the nature of stress I\ncan't even focus on my work because I'm\nso stressed about my work oh my God\nwhat's going to happen I can't be with\nmy partner because I'm worried what do\nthey think what do they\nthink so and the main thing for you is\nletting your mind run out of steam\nthat's very important and when you\nengage with it\nyou teach it how to get more Steam from\nyou yeah right and then this is where\nthat gambling thing comes in where like\neven once in a\nwhile\nit'll you know it doesn't have to always\nwork but like all you need to give it is\nan excuse where sometimes it works and\nthen it's going to demand it from you\nall the time y so I'd say just let your\nmind run out of as much steam as you can\nthat's what you need to do and this is a\nfancy way of slowing down the problem is\nthat it's going to feel hard to slow\ndown and you're even trying to induce\nrelaxation you're like let me watch a TV\nshow to relax not going to\nwork and and I I think you'll you're not\nyou're not screwed I I don't believe\nthat I think that the the patterns the\nmental patterns that you have have\ngotten you to where you are so one\nreally interesting thing one really\ninteresting Simple Solution in life is\nif you keep doing something and you find\nthe same result like do something else\nso in your case the last thing I would\nbe super careful about is you seem to\nact a lot to avoid some negativity so if\nI don't act right now then I'm going to\nfeel inefficient but if you do act then\nyou're going to have too much on your\nplate and you're going to be stressed\nout yeah so you have to take a loss like\nsomewhere in there but it's not a real\nloss it'll be a loss it'll feel like a\nloss in here because your mind is\nattached I want to be better I want to\nbe successful I want to be cool I want\nto be respected\nbut you are all those things and it's\nnot\nworking\ntrue thoughts questions before we wrap\nup sounds like we're feels like we're at\na good stopping point to me\nanyway yeah I think it just helped a lot\nas always I think I'm going to call my\nmom and go from there sounds great do\ndeep breathing exercises and I will uh\nbecause I I I do think TV shows are not\nthe way to go because I'm just thinking\nabout the fact that I should be relaxing\num\nyeah yeah so I I I would even say I know\nit sounds kind of weird but try less\nhard to relax right and you can even\naccept that today you're not going to\nrelax but you're not going to work yeah\nyeah just don't overwork yeah it's an\naddiction\nyep\ncool any questions before we wrap\nup I got nothing all right man look at\nthat what's going on in your head you\nseem very\ntired oh that meditation kind of knocked\nme out good that's what it's\nfor go take a nap bro I can't I gotta go\nlive ah look at that yep there it is\nthere's the addiction yep it doesn't\nstop okay so we'll we'll see so we're\nGNA talk to your mom you're going to go\nlive and then we'll see what happens\ntonight so hopefully you'll get some\ntime to rest I will I and I have time\noff and I'm going to relax I'm not going\nto yeah I I think I I know what to do\nawesome dude good luck and best of luck\nwith your stream today man thank you dog\ntake care buddy\nbye alrighty\nso Miz has to go live fair enough do\ny'all understand what we talked about\nyes okay so do yall have questions\nlet's take questions for 10 or 15\nminutes\nokay\nwhy what shampoo do you\nuse\num okay here's a good one how do I\ndifferentiate if what I have is ADHD or\njust\nlaziness so this is really common where\npeople are like do I have ADHD or am I\njust\nlazy so let's start by understanding\nthat laziness is not a\nthing I know this may sound very very\nvery controversial you mean like what do\nyou mean laziness is not a thing that is\nprecisely what I\nmean laziness is not a thing it is an an\nemergent property right it's something\nlike a family so a family is an abstract\nconcept what is it mean to be a\nfamily right so you can't biopsy someone\nand find a family a family is a unit of\npeople that are maybe genetically\nrelated but what if someone is adopted\nwell then it's not genetic relations\nit's people who live together oh so\nroommates or family no a family is a\nfamily we all know what a family is but\nit can't be defined is not one thing it\nis a constellation of different things\nso laziness in that way is a\nconstellation of different things\nlaziness is the lazy person's way of\ndescribing\nlaziness so just to run through a couple\nof the different things that contribute\nto laziness on the one hand we have the\nfive Factor model of Personality which\nis breaks down human personality traits\ninto five Dimensions one of them is\nconscientiousness\npeople who have a a high trait\nconscientiousness are willing to work\nhard for delayed gratification so we\nthink oh if you have low\nconscientiousness that means you're lazy\nbut in addition to personality\ncharacteristics we also have these\nthings called our frontal loes so our\nfrontal loes are things that restrain\nimpulses or we'll overcome impulses and\nallow us to stay focused on a task so is\nlaziness frontal lobe function well\nlaziness sometimes means a lack of\nmotivation where does motivation come\nfrom well it turns out that motivation\ncomes from our emotional circuits of the\nbrain these are a different part of the\nbrain from frontal\nloes what else is laziness well this\nperson goes to the gym every day I don't\ngo to the gym every day that means that\nthey're not lazy and I am lazy well hold\non a second if we're talking about go\ndoing something every day that's not\nfrontal loes and that's not emotion\nthat's habit this is the endocannabinoid\ncircuitry of the brain this is a\ncompletely different\npart laziness is not a thing it is a\nlazy person's way of describing a lot of\ncomplex\nthings and so if you have ADHD are you\ngoing to be\nlazy often times people will say yes I\nam lazy that is a feature of ADHD but\nwhich part of\nADHD so it is very common that people\nwith ADHD believe they're lazy why do\nthey believe they're lazy because\nbecause for them to do a certain amount\nof work it takes 10 times as much\neffort someone else can sit down and\nstudy a textbook for 45 minutes I\nremember this growing up where I was in\nthe seventh grade and I realized one day\nI need to study and I didn't know how to\nstudy because I had never needed to\nstudy so it's like what is studying it's\nreading a textbook right so I opened up\na textbook and I started reading in my\nmind it took me 45 minutes to read one\npage I was like well [ __ ] this is hard\nso when it takes you a very large amount\nof effort to do a small amount of work\nis that\nlaziness because all I did today was\nread three pages that makes me lazy\nright\nso often\ntimes we think we are lazy when we have\nADHD it doesn't mean that we are lazy\nlaziness is a complicated subject that\nhas a lot lot of different\ndrivers and we when we made the guide to\nADHD and doing stuff that's what we\ntalked about we talked about how to do\nstuff what is it that goes into human\nbeings doing\nthings it's more complicated than\nthat this even gets worse because often\ntimes what happens is we have an\nAdaptive laziness if we have\nADHD so what starts to happen is we look\nat our lives and we say I can't do what\nother people can do I can't sit down and\nread a textbook I have difficulty\ngetting motivated because my emotional\ncircuitry is is not regulated properly I\nhave difficulty restraining my impulses\nwhich means that when I have an Impulse\nto play a video game I'll play a video\ngame then I'll play it for five hours\nbecause I don't have impulse control and\nthen what did I do today I didn't I\ndidn't do anything except for play video\ngames therefore I'm lazy then there is a\nfurther problem because we adopt an\nidentity\nof laziness it makes so much sense ah\nI'm just lazy it's not complicated I'm\njust [ __ ]\nlazy once we internalize the idea of\nlaziness that creates even its own set\nof problems because I'm not going to do\nthis why because I'm lazy oh people who\nExcel they're not lazy I can't start a\ncompany I can't write a book I can't\nmake a video game I'm\nlazy and so then it becomes a\nself-fulfilling prophecy because now you\nidentity into the picture whole\ndifferent part of the brain now we're\ntalking about the anterior singulate and\nthe posterior singulate cortex the\ndefault mode Network a sense of who I\nam so even if you are lazy fair enough\ndoesn't mean you have to\nbe you can change your sense of identity\ncan change because that's all it is it's\na sense of\nidentity you can think all kinds of\nthings about yourself doesn't make him\ntrue right tell that to narcissist I'm\nthe best thing on the\nplanet just because someone think\nsomething about themselves doesn't make\nit true and that's true of laziness as\nwell but you'll say but Dr K I have all\nthis\nevidence yeah narcissists have evidence\nthat they're the best thing my mommy\ntold me that I'm the I'm the bestest boy\nin the world and any girl would be so\nlucky to have me my mommy told me so\nthere's\nevidence so take a step back\neven if you think you're lazy so be it I\nstill describe myself as lazy you can\nstill be incredibly productive this is\nthe last thing I'll\nsay you don't have to have laziness\nDefine your productivity I consider\nmyself lazy I'm incredibly productive I\nknow a lot of people who consider\nthemselves lazy they're very productive\nyou don't have to let it Define you the\nquestion is how how do lazy people\nbecome productive and I think it's maybe\nBill Gates who said something like you\nknow if you want something done very\nefficiently give it to a lazy person\ndon't give it to a hard working person I\nmay have misattributed the quote and\nbutchered the quote slightly but it's a\nreally interesting concept\nright and if we look at it laziness is\nactually a feature of\nevolution what is laziness laziness is\nenergy\nconservation you if you look at the\nanimal kingdom animals don't do things\nthat are\nunnecessary you if you have something\nlike a pet cat and a pet dog they'll sit\naround on their ass like become absolute\nchonkers if you give them the chance\nit's a feature of Life the conservation\nof\nenergy okay so it's okay to be to view\nyourself as\nlazy it can be absolutely be related to\nADHD but just because you have ADHD\ndoesn't make you\nlazy it doesn't have to Define your\nfuture you can work on all of those\nDimensions right so focus on if you're\nfeeling lazy motivation goes a long way\na good amount of rest goes a long way\nnot putting yourself into an insulin\ninduced coma goes a long\nway strengthening your frontal loes\nthrough meditation goes a long way\nsurrounding yourself with the right\nenvironmental stimulation to create\nexcitement goes an incredibly Long Way\nbuilding a habit goes an incredibly long\nway the biggest tragedy in ADHD is that\nwe know there are all these deficits in\nthe brain frontal lob\ndeficits emotional regulation\ndeficits the one part of the brain that\nappears to have no deficits in ADHD is\nour end endoc canabo habit\ncircuitry once someone develops a habit\nthat habit remains intact it is\nUntouched by ADHD the real tragedy here\nis that developing a habit requires\nconsistent action and that is what is\ndifficult for\nADHD the one part of your brain that can\nbe your saving grade is very difficult\nto turn on but once it's on it works\njust the\nsame so if you can force yourself to do\nsomething for a period of two weeks and\nthe Habit will be built and then you'll\nbe\nokay right this is why people with ADHD\nWho start to develop a habit of using\ncalendars or timers do incredibly well\nif you look at uh evidence-based studies\nof psychotherapy for ADHD they're just\nas as effective as stimulant medication\nthink about that for a second we can\ngive you a stimulant medication that\nliterally boosts your frontal lob's\ncapacity to regulate things and focus\nand you can get the same yield out of\npsychotherapy\nhow does Psychotherapy induce stimulant\nin your brain no they teach compensatory\nmechanisms that utilize the parts of\nyour brain that are\nintact so that the effect of the ADHD\ndoesn't actually\nwork it doesn't make it through your\nprotective\nmechanisms it's like you have damage\nreduction is cannabis bad for\nADHD\nprobably great\nquestion um Hey Jake and bake good to\nsee you\nbuddy okay I'm glad that today's stream\nwas helpful dude it's great to see you\nman hope you're doing well I've really\nenjoyed our\nchats okay nefarious Gandhi has a great\ngreat question how do I\nknow if I making a good choice and\nquitting something that isn't working\nfor me versus giving up too soon because\nsomething is hard I'm trying to decide\nif I should quit a job I started 3\nmonths ago this is a great great great\nquestion how do you know if you are\ngiving up too soon or if it's the right\ntime to quit right are you throwing in\nin the toic when should you\npersevere and when is it dumb to keep\ngoing so there are a couple of important\nimportant Concepts here okay the first\nis there is no such thing as a good\nchoice how how am I supposed to to know\nlike I can't see the future you can't\nsee the future so the first thing if\nyou're stuck between figuring out is\nthis should I keep doing it or should I\nquit the first thing you should do is\nabandon the idea of a right\nanswer there's two choices you don't\nknow which one is going to be\nright so recognize that no matter what\nyou choose there's a chance that you'll\nregret it and there's a chance that you\nwon't so the main thing to do is anytime\nyou make a choice except that this could\nbe the wrong choice and also that you\nare going to learn from it no matter\nwhat right it's just like if you're\nplaying a video game you're like I don't\nknow what the right build for this\ncharacter is well give it a shot it's\nnot about this time it is about the\nfuture\ntimes second thing to consider there are\na few different things that keep your\nmind from seeing things\nclearly so how do you make the best\nchoice I don't know if it's a good one\nor a bad one we can't say that but how\ncan you set yourself up to make the best\nchoice there are two or three things\nthat you need to do the first is\nrecognize how active your ego\nis so ego is going to make\ncomparisons pump yourself up or pump\nyourself down and pump other people up\nor pump them\ndown so in this situation let's say\nyou're thinking about something isn't\nworking for me is it not working for you\nbecause it is working for someone else\nbetter are you making a\ncomparative\nanalysis right we're like oh I don't\nknow if like I should do like I'll give\nyou all just a simple example right so\nlike when I was doing Psychiatry people\nor when I was thinking about choosing\nPsychiatry as my medical profession\npeople told me you're too smart to be a\npsychiatrist because Psychiatry is not\nas competitive as like plastic surgery\nthey're like you'd be wasted in\nPsychiatry you should do a more\ncompetitive field and I would look at\nsome of the my colleagues and stuff like\nthat and people would be like yeah like\nthat person can do psych because they're\nnot very\nsmart so the moment that I\nstopped paying attention to what other\npeople are doing that's when I figured\nout the right answer forget about what\nother people are doing make the right\nanswer for you and anytime your mind is\nmaking comparisons oh I shouldn't ask\nthat person out because they're talking\nto my friend and my friend is so much\nmore attractive than they are so I\nshouldn't ask them\nout not the right way to operate don't\nmake\ncomparisons you can learn from other\npeople absolutely you can observe things\noutside you and learn from them that's\nfine but to say I should not do\nsomething because this person is better\nat it or I should do something because I\nam better than these other people that's\nnot going to lead to good decision-\nmaking over time so watch out for the\npresence of ego second thing is watch\nout for the presence of\nemotion and when I say watch out for the\npresence of emotion I mean one of two\nthings the first is are you being driven\nby an emotion and contrary to what a lot\nof people may say they may say if you're\nbeing by driven by emotion don't listen\nto it I disagree emotions are\nevolutionary features we paid a lot of\nevolutionary price to have\nemotions we gave up things like armor\nlike\nturtles and the ability to swim we've\ntraded so much we're like chimpanzees\nand gorillas can tear us apart what do\nwe have as an advantage over them we\nhave\nthis emotions are sources of information\nand motivation so if your emotions are\nmotivating you in a particular direction\npay attention to\nthat the other thing about the presence\nof emotion is if you are making a\ndecision that is not emotional you need\nto be very careful look under the\nsurface for\nemotion one of the best things that\nemotion loves loves to do is masquerade\nas\nlogic take a look at any internet\nargument or take a look at any political\nargument and you will see emotion\nmasquerading as analysis so if you are\nmaking a cold dispassionate analysis\nthat does not involve emotion you're\nmissing the presence of\nemotion we see this a lot because our\nsociety is becoming increasingly alexic\nwhich means we are colorblind to our\ninternal emotional state\nokay\nso pay attention to emotion the last\nthing is how to incorporate emotion\nproperly acknowledge what a particular\nemotion is telling you and what it is\nmotivating you to do you don't have to\nlisten to it reflexively but you should\nnot ignore it it should be a part of the\npuzzle so in my case I felt emotionally\nashamed of becoming a\npsychiatrist because that's what people\ndid to me they judged\nme even my mom who is a doctor was like\nI mean not her fault but in in our in\nthe Indian culture Psychiatry is not as\nrespected as other professions she's\nlike are you sure you want to do that\nshe was absolutely supportive in the end\nbut there was this reflexive judgment\nand so I felt\nashamed and so that's fine so I just\nmentally prepared myself for okay if I\nwalk this path people will make fun of\nme people will call me not a real doctor\nis that worth what I'm getting\nabsolutely because when I think through\nthat it's like hold on a second so some\nrandom people want to judge me wait a\nsecond let me think about this do I want\nto spend 80 hours a week doing something\nso that other people will judge me well\nlike what the [ __ ] that's a bad trade I\nwant to suffer this for 80 hours a week\nso that when I meet someone at a\nbirthday party and they ask me what I do\nand I said oh I'm a trauma surgeon\nthey're like wow that must be intense oh\nlook at that ego oh yeah for those five\nminutes that I get to impress this\nstranger I'm going to spend 80 hours a\nweek learning surgery I don't think so\nuh-uh so recognize that you have\nemotions recognize what is the\ninformation that your emotion is telling\nyou and recognize what the motivation is\nand then integrate everything and make\nthe best choice that you can and\nrecognize at the very end that while you\ncan make the best choice that you can\nyou can't necessarily make a good choice\nthere's just the choice that you can\nchoose to make in this moment and\nunfortunately you can't see the future\nthere is no map hack there is no FAQ for\nlife so recognize that you could make a\nmistake okay\nokay how do you begin the process of\nbeing unhappy with yourself after\nstopping the behavior like trying to be\nsuccessful that you're using to close\nthe gap on your unhappiness this is\nreally\ngood so the basic problem is that a lot\nof times when we feel unhappy with\nourselves we will engage in behaviors\nthat actually reinforce our\nunhappiness okay so I'll give you a\nsimple example so let's say that I'm\nunhappy with my appearance and I decide\nto get some kind of minor cosmetic\nsurgery so since I'm unhappy with a part\nof myself I'm going to do something to\nfix it because we think that fixing our\nproblems is the way to unha is the way\nto happiness the problem is that\nfrequently when I do something to fix\nthe problem I'm actually reinforcing the\ninsecurity I'm not actually digesting\nthe insecurity I'm doing something to\nbypass it if I feel ashamed of myself\nbecause I'm poor and I become rich I can\nstill carry the shame with me and this\nis why people will get addicted to\nplastic surgery you'll see this in\nclinical pathological manifestations\nthis can result in things like anorexia\nnervosa or body\ndysmorphia I am unhappy with myself let\nme fix something on the outside to fix\nsomething on the inside doesn't quite\nwork like\nthat so what how do you become happy\nwhen you are unhappy on the\ninside there are a couple of things to\nunderstand the for first is that\ntolerance of\nunhappiness with equinity will lead to\nhappiness over\ntime so all you have to do is tolerate\nthe unhappiness without overly reacting\nor under reacting to it under reacting\nmeans numbing it out overreacting to it\nmeans pushing really hard to fix the\nproblem okay okay so what we want to do\nis just tolerate those feelings of\nunhappiness so be\nit now this may confuse a lot of people\nbecause Dr K are you saying that you\nshouldn't fix your problems no I'm not\nsaying you shouldn't fix your problems\nthis is the key thing then I'm confused\nwhat should I do very simple you fixing\nthe problems in your life should be\nindependent of yourself\nworth give you all a simple example very\nvery difficult\none if I am lonely and I want a\nsignificant other if I want a romantic\nrelationship I should absolutely pursue\na romantic relationship but whether I am\na loser or I have value as a human being\nshould not be tied to whether I can find\na romantic relationship that is what I'm\nsaying a problem should be fixed because\nit is a problem but just because a\nproblem exists or doesn't exist should\nnot tie to your personal value you all\nunderstand that this is very\nimportant cuz a lot of times people get\nconfused because they think I'm making\ncontradictions I'm not making\ncontradictions at least I don't think\nthey are maybe I'm just an idiot who\nknows right so once again when I say\nthat what happens I notice oh man maybe\nI'm making a mistake maybe I'm a dumbass\nand I smile why because my self-worth is\nnot tied to my intelligence I've been\nsuch a [ __ ] idiot in my life and I\nlearn to live with\nit and now people think I'm smart LOL\nwhat have you guys seen me play video\ngames right so your sense of self can be\nindependent of your accomplishments from\neverything anything external in life and\nin fact the more that you chase those\nexternal things the more vulnerable your\nsense of self\nbecomes oh I feel like a loser so let me\nmake a lot of money well hold on a\nsecond now I made a a lot of money I'm\nno longer a\nloser but what's happened oh no no no\nnow I can't lose the money I can't lose\nmy job because if I lose my job then I\nwill become a loser again if I lose my\nmoney I can't spend any of my money\nbecause then I won't have money and then\nI'll be a loser again so what you what\nhave you done you've actually reinforced\nthe insecurity by tying your value to\nyour net\nworth you made the problem\nworse this is what's really confusing a\nlot of people think like oh if I had a\nbunch of money like you know I'd be fine\nbut it's like biggy small said More\nMoney More Problems really weird right\nhe was on to something I hope I got that\nreference right it's been a\nwhile and during my teenage years I\ndidn't listen to rap music I played\nStarcraft\nokay does that make sense beautiful\nquestions\nokay so we're going to answer two\nmore all right how to stay stay positive\nin this process of changing myself I get\ndiscouraged so a lot of times when we\ntry to change and improve our lives we\nFace some amount of\ndiscouragement right it's like you know\ncuz if you think about like you know\nknow planting a garden like the gap\nbetween all the work that you do and\nactually like getting fruit or\nvegetables out of your garden there's a\nbig gap where you're investing a lot of\nstuff and you're not seeing any return\nso it's very difficult to not get\ndiscouraged when we're focused on\nself-improvement so there are a couple\nof different things we can do about\nthis the first is recognize that\ndiscouragement is part of the\nprocess right so there's going to be\ntime just accept\nthat for 6 months like it's going to\ntake a little while now this is a very\npowerful technique for a few\nreasons the first is\nthat once we accept that there is going\nto be discouragement discouragement is\nless\ndiscouraging so once we recognize like\noh like it's going to be a few months\nbefore things happen then just give\nyourself some time so then what you've\ndone the other thing that's really\nimportant is that when you accept\ndiscouragement you are divorcing your\nmotivation from an\noutcome so let's say that I'm going to\nthe the gym to get my sexy Beach bod if\nI'm going to the gym to get my sexy\nBeach bod and then I'm waiting for my\nsexy Beach bod and one month in I don't\nhave a sexy Beach bod I'm going to look\nat myself and I'm going to get\ndiscouraged and I'm going to say it's\nnot working and then we give\nup so one of the biggest reasons that we\ntend to give up in life is because\nthings don't\nwork and so one of the weirdest things\nthat you can do if you're focused on\nfollow through and\nperseverance is stop expecting things to\nwork and then you may say but Dr K hold\non a second if I don't want things to\nwork then how the hell am I supposed to\nget up in the morning and do them\nexactly what we want is your motivation\nand action to be independent of the\nresults\nbecause if they are dependent on the\nresults then your results determine your\nactions oh I I really want to be I'm\ntired of being alone I'm going to try to\nmake some friends but these people\ndidn't call me back so I'm going to stop\ntrying to make\nfriends now you're stuck because now the\nworld here's the real problem with this\nthink about this when the outside\nresults determine your motivations who\ngets to decide de whether you are\nmotivated or\nnot the world does I really like this\nperson I want them to go out with me I\nfeel ashamed of myself but if they say\nyes then I will feel great now suddenly\nyou've given this person power over you\nstop giving the world power over\nyou if you want to take control of your\nlife if you want to persevere if you\nwant to follow through you can't let the\noutcomes of your actions dictate your\nmotivation it needs to be independent of\nthat and then you may say but hold on a\nsecond Dr k then how do I get\nmotivated take pride in\naction even if you didn't get your Beach\nbod can you feel proud of yourself for\ngoing to the gym\ntoday\nabsolutely right if you make some effort\nyou can say hey I did the right thing\ntoday and if you're not careful your\nmental habit will arrive it's not enough\nyou should have started\nearlier it won't be\nenough and think about what your mind is\ndoing in this\nmoment this is why it's hard to stay\npositive when things don't go your way\nit's not just the problem isn't just\nwhen things don't go your way the\nproblem is if you if you really pay\nattention you'll find that when things\ndo go your way your mind will turn it\ninto discouragement what the [ __ ]\nI went to the gym for one week man I\nreally started four years ago I can't\nbelieve I'm so dumb and now I'm going to\nbeat myself up for going to the gym for\na week like pay\nattention to what your mind is doing be\nlike no no no no no this is a win we're\nnot going to turn it into an\nL right this is like how you tilt in\nreal life you tilt in real life when you\ndiscourage when you beat yourself up for\ndoing the right thing it's like what the\n[ __ ] and then now we're worried like now\nwe understand why we are dependent on\nresults for our motivation because when\nwe are beating ourselves up for doing\nthe right thing internally then we\nrequire the outside world to send us\nmotivation cuz in here it's like all\nmessed up but the solution is not no no\nno no no it's kind of like you know if\nyou're trying to like climb ranks like\nyou want to play the game the way it's\nsupposed to be played instead of making\nsome crappy strategy that works at low\nrank and then like be dependent on that\nstrategy for climbing you don't want to\ndo that you want to play the game the\nright\nway so don't rely on the external world\nto determine your motivation because\nthen you're\nso\nokay um\nokay let's\nsee okay hold on\num okay so there's a lot of good stuff\nhere uh\nstrats for\nself-compassion\nabsolutely so let's understand if you're\nstruggling with\nself-compassion there are a couple of\nthings that\npropagate difficulty with\nself-compassion so we are taught\nself-compassion through being taught\ncompassion okay so if people are\ncompassionate towards us we will learn\nhow to be compassionate towards\nourselves so if you look at something\nlike Psychotherapy often times what\nhappens and sometimes we'll even people\nwill post about this right I'm not\npsychotherapist for the internet but if\nyou look at what happens in\nPsychotherapy we train people to think\nin a different way so when a therapist\nexhibits compassion towards you when\nyou're beating yourself up when they do\nthat for a while then you will learn how\nto internalize that dialogue and if we\nunderstand why people don't know\nself-compassion that is because they\nwere not treated with compassion so if\nyou look at victims of abuse they beat\nthemselves up all the time and the\nquestion is why and it's because they\nwere treated like crap so they\ninternalize that right so when the whole\nworld tells me that I'm a piece of [ __ ]\nI'm going to start telling myself that\nI'm a piece of [ __ ] when the whole world\ncalls the sky blue I'm going to call it\nblue and they say this is up and this is\ndown I'm going to do the same\nthing so the first Strat for\nself-compassion is to get compassion\nfrom outside of\nyourself Strat number one and then you\nwill say but Dr K I can't do\nthat yeah like that's one of the\nproblems right so if we want to look at\nwhat the honest answer to a lot of these\nquestions are not everything within a\nhuman being can be fixed by itself as\nthe easiest\nway that's not fair well like look at\nhow human beings evolved we EV evolved\nas Community organisms so this is very\nimportant to\nunderstand there is one organ of the\nMind\nthat requires things outside of you to\nbe\nhealthy and that is the\nMind heart I don't need anything from\nanybody\nelse right my kidneys don't need\nanything I mean I need water so I guess\nyou can call that things outside but the\nmind is the one organ that exists in\nrelation to other people so if you look\nat the Neuroscience of human emotion\nwhat we discover is that human emotions\ncan be divided into two parts one is\nprimitive emotions that literally comes\nfrom a different part of our brain\ncalled the amydala this is where anxiety\nand fear comes from anger comes from and\nanimals have that too even reptiles have\nthat and then we have something called\nour social emotions guilt shame\nPride those are emotions that require a\nrelation to exist I feel ashamed because\nof what people see so literally some of\nour emotions can't EX exist without an\noutside\nperson so if you look at mental\nhealthiness it requires other people\nthat's why what we're seeing is a rise\nin the loneliness epidemic and a rise in\nall of the other mental crap associated\nwith\nit okay so the first place to learn\ncompassion is outside of yourself find\npeople who are compassionate a therapist\nis a great place to start good friends\nare also really good what we also find\nis that people who know self-compassion\noften times have supportive\ncaregivers second thing to consider if\nyou want to learn self-compassion you\ncan also be compassionate towards other\npeople so if you look at I can pull up a\nstudy real quick hold\non you guys okay just chilling for a\nsecond\nbecause I'm going to\nfind a study\nI'll show y'all cool literature people\ndon't realize this\nbut it's going to take me a little while\nokay okay no it's\nhere\ngreat\num give me a second chat so let's\nlook at this paper real quick this is a\ngreat paper if you guys want to see\nthis can't believe I found it on the\nfirst attempt so is empathy good for the\nself\num okay so with within non-clinical\npopulations there are many studies\ndemonstrating the associations between\nempathy related traits and behaviors and\ngood mental and physical health these\nstudies cover traits such as empathy\npassion altruism narcissism and\ngenerativity and behaviors such as\ngiving support to others volunteering\nfor nonprofit organizations and caring\nfor animals so this is really important\num I got to find this thing about\nvolunteer for\nnonprofits not\nhere uh okay there are actually similar\nsimilar results when examining how\nempathy related behaviors are associated\nwith psychological and physical health\num this is cool it is difficult to\nrandomly assign people to regularly\nvolunteer for nonprofit organizations\nalthough in recent years some Scholars\nhave done just that yet there is\nconsistent evidence that people who\nregularly volunteer for nonprofit\norganizations have better psychological\nand physical health even when\nconsidering for a variety of confounds\nimportantly a recent study found that in\norder to receive health benefit of\nvolunteering people had to be motivated\nby care for others those who were\nmotivated by potential ways they could\npersonally benefit from\nvolunteering s such as learning\nsomething new or feeling good did not\nexperience a later\nbenefit\nokay\num uh let me show you all this so\nseveral correlational studies found that\ngiving social support to others is\nassociated with better mental and\nphysical health um people who are\nrandomly assigned to such diverse\nbehaviors such as caring for animals or\nplants giving money to others Random\nActs or kindness or giving massages to\ninfants all experienced increased\npsychological well-being and better\nphysiological outcomes such as lower\nstress\nhormones\nokay so like literally this is crazy if\nyou have trouble with self-compassion\nbecause these psychological outcomes\nthat they're talking about include\nthings like low self-esteem do good\nthings for other people I'm not saying\nthis because it'll help you get into\nheaven right I I don't know what's going\nto get you into\nheaven not my cup of\ntea but compassion towards others will\nimprove your mental health and here's\nthe crazy thing if you're volunteering\nbecause it'll look good on your resume\nthe effect isn't there you have to want\nto give something to someone else so the\nsecond way that you can learn\nself-compassion is by being\ncompassionate to others then you will\nlearn the modes of it it and then you\ncan implement it in your own\nlife\nokay the third thing that you can do to\nlearn\nself-compassion is there's a whole\nbranch of meditation called mea\nmeditation or I like to do meditations\nthat are from the anahat or heart chakra\nso there are some meditations that you\ncan kind of do that are just all about\ngoverning self-compassion and compassion\ntowards other things so then there's\nalso Transcendent compassion this is\nsuper cool so there's some like\nTranscendent experiences that you can\nhave through things like psychedelics or\nmeditation where the ultimate compassion\nis to recognize that you are one with\nthe universe now we leave science behind\nenough\nscience so the crazy thing happens once\nyou realize that the barrier between\nyourself and other people is broken down\nso in psychedelic experiences we see\nthis in actually psychotic experiences\nwe see this as well but in a negative\nway once I believe that I'm connected to\nanother human being and that we're all\npart of one Cosmic organism it doesn't\nhave to be bound by physicality we're\nall part of one Society let's call it\nthat or we're all one family unit or\nwe're all one\nmarriage right like we're actually part\nof the same thing even scientifically we\nknow that you can logically understand\nthat although in some Transcendent\nexperiences your understanding of it\nblooms s Way Beyond\nthat then compassion becomes very easy\nbut at that point it's no longer\ncompassion you can ultimately get to\nwhat I would call Transcendent\ncompassion compassion is me feeling\nsomething for\nyou but Transcendent compassion is not\nme feeling something for you me and you\ndisappear it is just kindness all around\nso I'll give you a simple\nexample when I don't burn my hand on a\nstove when I take care of my body and I\ndon't injure myself am I even being\ncompassionate no it becomes automatic I\ntake care like I don't like smack my\nhand around because the hand is part of\nme why would I hurt it it is dumb to\nhurt it something has to be\npathologically wrong for me to hurt\nmyself and once you realize that you are\nconnected with other people you will be\ncompassionate towards them other people\nwill look at you and they'll say oh my\nGod this person is so compassionate it's\nnot actually compassion I'm just looking\nout for\nmyself you understand it's weird really\nweird some studies allude to that kind\nof\nthing\nokay you're not nice to your hand\nbecause it's part of you and once you\nrealize that other people are part of\nyou too we're all in this game together\nin some way even in a logical way\nwithout some kind of transcendental\nexperience we're all in this game\ntogether\nokay should we do one or two more this\nis\nfun let me find another\nquestion is anxiety and emotion\nyes did I talk to Mr kif yes I\ndid uh I don't know about supplements\nfor ADHD man like that's the kind of\nthing like someone's asking [ __ ] versus\ntonot Ali for health benefits for\nsomeone with adh2 is already on vians\nthat's something you should talk to your\ndoctor about\num\nokay can I medit can I recommend some\nbooks for self-help or\nmeditation so you know if y'all are\nlooking for books on self-help or\nmeditation I would say read something by\npeople at least once I know it's kind of\na weird answer but like read one thing\nby eart tol read one thing by Alan\nWatts read like the bhagad Gita like\nread one thing by read one thing by\nOsho read one\nthing and just see if you like their\nVibe and then we'll go from\nthere um\nokay so this is a great question I have\nADHD and sometimes my brain shuts down\nwhen I have lots of ideas formulating in\nmy head creatively and I feel like I get\nstuck at a wall and and just my brain\nstops working sometimes but I still have\na desire to complete all my\ntasks so this is going to sound kind of\nweird\nsee your brain shutting down is\nlike an adaptation so when our brain\ngets mentally overwhelmed we shut down\nso we see that there's like shutting\ndown mechanisms even when it comes to\ntrauma so anytime there is excessive\nemotion or excessive pain in our body\nliterally our brain will shut down and\nwe'll trigger something called\ndissociation so shutting down is a way\nof compensating with over overactive\nmind so now people say that this is a\nproblem but I think this is the first\nstep to the solution so instead of\ntrying to prevent the shutdown what\nhappens when you shut down there's\nnothing great now the biggest mistake\nthat you can make when your mind is\nempty is to try to complete all of your\ntasks but when your mind is empty do one\njust\none right so one task second task third\ntask fourth task fifth task boom empty\nand then we often times feel and this is\nvery hard to do because we you feel\ncognitively\nexhausted that's why we can't do\nanything it feels like we can't do\nanything so start one thing so if you\nhave ADHD there's one thing to important\nto remember this is\ngeneralization is that your mind doesn't\nneed a lot of stimulation to get going\nagain that's the\nproblem right so if we look at having a\nthousand tasks and getting excited about\nthem and shutting down why does that\nhappen it's because I'm focusing on task\nnumber one and my mind gets excited\nabout number two and then number three\nand then number 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 get so\nmuch energy and then it's too\nmuch this integer has gone beyond the\nspace or the the number has gone beyond\nthen there's some kind of exception I\nforget what it's called we've overloaded\nour Ram so we're triggering a\nrestart so now the cool thing is you\ndon't have to want to do anything start\nto do one task and recognize that your\nmind will get excited about something if\nit's empty it'll get excited about\nwhatever you put in\nthere the second thing that you really\nneed to do is let go of your desire to\ncomplete all the\ntasks so we're so vulnerable to desire\nif we have\nADHD so vulnerable so one of the best\nthings that we need to learn how to do\nis don't worry about completing all the\ntasks think about that right so I have a\ndesire to complete all my tasks that's\nthere's two mistakes you're making there\nthe first is you have a desire to\ncomplete the desire to complete is very\ndifficult to get you\nstarted the desire to get started is the\nright desire let me get started let me\nsee how far I can\ngo because what happens when you have a\ndesire to complete a\ntask your mind says oh I'm not going to\nbe able to complete it now and the goal\nis completion not starting so if I can't\ncomplete it now let me do it\ntomorrow the desire to complete a task\nhamstrings your ability to start it and\nthen the second thing is we want to\ncomplete all the tasks now think what\nyou're doing you're making things\nexponentially difficult for your mind\nbecause now you can't just complete one\nyou have to complete them all and of\ncourse I I get it I have a desire to\ncomplete all the tasks too I want to\nclean I want to play my bills I want to\nwrite another book I want to play a\nvideo game I want to do this I want to\nlearn the piano I want to work out today\nI want to do this I want to do so many\nthings I want to oh my God I have so\nmany things to do\nand it's too\nmuch so if you get mentally overwhelmed\nstart something get some kind of sensory\ninput and then your mind will\nrestart and then step away anytime your\nmind tries to fix finish something don't\nworry about finishing it worry about\nstarting it now this is another problem\nfor ADHD this solution doesn't work\ngreat because oftentimes people with\nADHD are okay at starting things but\nthey're not good at finishing them so I\nhave a th half complete things and why\nis that it's because of this principle\nof the impulse is enough to get me\nstarted so then the main thing that we\nneed to do is don't worry about\nfinishing what you need to worry about\nis not starting something\nelse the energy of the mind will\nnaturally progress on that task as long\nas it does not get\ndistracted so often times people with\nADHD will try to force follow through\nDon't Force follow\nthrough force not\nstarting so now I go complete reverse\nand I say now the challenge is to not\nstart right so this is kind of the way\nthat I would put it see when I'm sitting\ndown and I'm trying to study let's say\nand I get\ndistracted what really screws me is if I\nstart something else if my mind wanders\nfor 5 minutes that's\nfine the problem is in that 5 minute\nwandering if I let my mind latch onto\nsomething else then I'm in\ntrouble because now it's latched onto oh\nnow I've opened up something on my phone\nand now I go down the rabbit hole a f\nminute distraction becomes a 4our\ncost right so the this is important so\nlet yourself unplug totally fine give\nyourself an Impulse to do one thing and\nthen do your best to when your mind\nwanders let it wander and let it come\nback\ndon't let it wander to something it's\nfine if it wanders away don't let it\nwander\nto very subtle but important difference\nlet it wander and then when it gets\nbored of wandering if you don't let it\nsettle down somewhere else it'll come\nback\nhome\nokay all right\num\nokay let me look at more oh my God I\nneed to scroll faster\nchat\nokay how do you practice\nit so this is where like meditation\ncomes in okay but you you guys don't\nhave to meditate if you want to meditate\nyou can meditate but let's understand\nthis how do you practice this\nskill so when we\nmeditate sometimes people get confused\nbecause the more you get distracted in\nmeditation the better you're going to be\nat meditating so let's understand this\nif I'm focusing on my breath and my mind\nwanders\naway when I bring it back this is\nliterally like doing a rep it's like\ndoing a push-up so the more that my mind\nwand ERS the more I'm exerting energy to\nbring it back that's my frontal loes\nforming strong neuronal connections with\nother parts of my brain and literally\npracticing Focus so in my experience as\na clinician working with people with\nADHD they get very discouraged because\nwhen they try to meditate it's hard but\nthe beautiful thing is those who stick\nwith it get really good at it really\nfast see if if meditating is easy for\nyou it's like going to the gym doing\nfive\npush-ups if meditation is hard for you\nit's like going to the gym and doing\n500 one will actually make you stronger\nway faster which is why meditation has\nbeen shown in so many clinical trials to\nbe beneficial for ADHD because you're\ndoing reps you're bringing it back\nbringing it back bringing it\nback there's other things that you can\ndo as well the general principle is that\nwhatever you get distracted\nfrom don't allow to do anything else\nright so if I'm trying to read a book\nwhat I would say is craft an environment\nturn off your phone stick it in your bag\ntake your laptop put it away have the\nbook in front of you and mentally\nprepare look at the clock for 15 minutes\nwe're going to just struggle with\nreading this page that's what we're\ndoing for 15 minutes your mind will\nwander so be it bring it back as soon as\nyou can it'll wander again so be it\nbring it back as soon as you\ncan and the goal is not to read the page\nthis is where people with ADHD get\ntripped up because they view this as a\nfailure the goal is to do any to avoid\ndoing anything\nelse force yourself to be in that room\nfor about 15\nminutes\nokay how does a beginner get into\nmeditation for mindfulness and focus so\nwe have a bunch of videos on that for\nour YouTube channel we just had one that\nwent up a couple days ago that's Dr K's\ntake on meditation we also have a guide\nto meditation which you all can check\nout but\nyeah\num so doubting Soul 2 says Dr K I'm a\nmixed person who never felt like belong\nsometimes I feel like I am nothing and\nthat no one in the world will ever be\nable to understand me no need to say\nthat I feel very lonely what can I do so\nthe first thing that you can do is\nrecognize that you are not alone and\nfeeling that way here because what are\nwe I want yall to understand\nsomething so we are Misfits to\nsociety my dad was a misfit I'm a misfit\nright I've always been a\nmisfit so I was was like okay in school\nI was in like a couple of advanced\nclasses but I was never at the top of my\nclass I was like not one of the popular\nkids I wasn't a jock but I wasn't one of\nthe mega nerds I wasn't one of the emo\nkids who got drunk or high every day and\nthen I went to college and I was in a\nfraternity but I played a lot of\nStarcraft and it was like ah and then I\nwent to med school and I kind of worked\nhard but I was one of the four people\nout of a class of like 200 that decided\nto do psychiatry\nthen I wound up at at Harvard and all\nthat good stuff and they're all these\nlike Chad people who are trying to\nchange the world and doing these\ngigantic research studies and being very\nsuccessful and I wasn't one of them so I\nstarted streaming on\nTwitch so this is a place for\nMisfits and the truth of the matter is\nthat in society and in the history of\nhumanity there have always been people\nwho don't fit\nin the problem is that once we stop\nfitting in we can internalize an\nidentity of being a\nmisfit and what I mean by that I know I\nsaid that we're all Misfits but there's\nthere is a way to fit as a\nmisfit right you can say hey there's the\nregular people and then there's the rest\nof us there's even a unity in\nthat the problem is that when you are\nsuch a misfit that you realize there's\nthere's being an objective Misfit which\nis that I don't clear clearly fit into\nthe world fair enough and then there's\nbeing a subjective Misfit I don't\nbelong you may not belong over there\nfair enough you may not belong over\nthere fair enough and then you can\narrive at a conclusion I don't belong\nanywhere\nincorrect Fair logical but\nwrong where you belong is with the rest\nof us who don't\nbelong and there are a lot of things\nthat we have to be very careful about\nbecause once we start believing that we\nwill interpret social interactions in\nthat\nway if I feel like I don't belong I will\nbecome hyper sensitive to signs of\nrejection so if you look at people who\nhave social anxiety this is a very big\nproblem and what propagates their social\nanxiety is they look at the world and\nthey say these people objectively do\nthis to me that's fair enough you're not\nwrong that some of them do that the\nproblem is that brain filters out all of\nthe positive\nstimuli right so this is what's really\ninteresting we made I I did a lecture\nsome time ago that one of the it's\nreally interesting so one of the antidot\nantidotes to loneliness is\nSolitude sounds really weird but it's\ntrue\nstudies Solitude is the desire for\nloneliness desire to be alone and you\nmay Wonder well hold on a second how on\nEarth does that\nhelp so whether you it's not about\nspending time with people or not\nspending time with people this is the\nway that I want y'all to this is the way\nthat I understand it so if I'm alone all\nday\nlong and I feel lonely for 16 hours a\nday then I'm lonely 100% of the\ntime if I desire Solitude for 2 hours a\nday or 4 hours a day let's say what that\nmeans is that now for 12 hours of the of\nthe day the rest of the world rejects me\nbut for 4 hours of the day I'm okay and\nso psychologically what starts this is a\ngross oversimplification but\npsychologically what starts to happen is\nthat in one in scenario number one I'm\nrejected by the world 100% of the time\nand in scenario number two I'm rejected\nby the world for 75% of the\ntime this has a huge psychological\nimpact\nbeing lonely 16 hours a day all day\nversus being lonely for 34s of the day\ngigantic\nimpact so spend time with yourself if\nyou are lonely and you may say but I do\nthat all the time no you don't you are\nforced to do that it's not something\nthat you choose there is a huge\ndifference between Solitude and\nloneliness human Choice matters a lot\nit's the same difference is getting\nfired and\nquitting right and if if we want to be a\nlittle bit crass there is a kink called\nBDSM and we know that consent with that\nstuff makes the world of difference do\nyou all see what I mean willingness is\nthe world of difference consent is the\nworld of\ndifference you all understand so oddly\nenough spend some time with\nyourself because here's the other cool\nthing that happens so our\nmaybe that was a\nmistake\nare see when you spend time with\nyourself you will feel better about\nyourself now if you have enforced time\nwith yourself this is psychologically\ndamaging so if we look at studies of\nfemale\nbullies their tools are ostracization\nand isolation incredibly psychologically\ndamaging so enforced isolation is very\nbad incidentally this is why parents get\na lot of friction when they try to take\naway their kids video game the parents\ndon't understand that they're not just\ntaking away a game they're not taking\naway a source of entertainment they are\ntaking away Community they are isolating\nyou very psychologically\ndamaging the tricky thing though is that\nwhen you spend time with yourself shame\nand\nguilt require other people to\nexist right so you you can't feel guilty\nwithout doing someone to doing something\nto someone you can't feel ashamed\nwithout being seen by someone as doing\nsomething\nbad so for me for example like when I\nwent to India and I spent 3 months there\nlike something really interesting\nhappened I felt terrible for the first\ntwo weeks the worst I've ever felt in my\nlife\npsychologically so depressed in such\nDespair and then all of these like\nthings I'm a loser I'm behind I'm\nnothing's working for me I'm a fail\nlike all this kind of stuff but in that\nworld all of that disappeared once I got\nused to it I just there I go to class I\nmeditate I do yoga I go for a walk I eat\nthe same damn food every\nday and so as you spend time with\nyourself you will discover you and the\nproblem is that when you're with other\npeople you spend time with the version\nof you that they see that they create\nyour inferiorities become Amplified by\ntheir superiorities if you were alone on\na desert island you wouldn't feel\ninferior so interestingly enough\nspending more time with\nyourself to heal some of those\nself-esteem\nproblems right and if you really look at\nPsychotherapy this is really\ninteresting so if you look at\nPsychotherapy Psychotherapy is not\nspending time with your therapist\nPsychotherapy is your therapists\nbringing the deeper you out what who you\nactually spend time with is\nyourself you spend time with the\nvulnerable parts of\nyourself you spend time with the parts\nof yourself that are hidden\naway and that has a very healing effect\nokay all right we're at time for the day\ny'all and we're going to definitely raid\nso who should is MF streaming let's
