    "transcript": "now what we're gonna do is answer some\nof the most commonly Googled questions\nabout ADHD\nwhy is ADHD on the rise\nso this is a great question so I think\nADHD is on the rise for a couple of\ndifferent reasons the first reason is\nbecause we're becoming more sensitive at\npicking it up so as our sophistication\nand awareness of ADHD is on the rise as\nteachers become aware of it as parents\nbecome aware of it we're catching a\nportion of people who used to be missed\nADHD is not simply a neuroscientific\nillness it's actually a neuroscientific\nmeets environment illness and this is a\nbig Theory that's getting a lot of\nmomentum in Psychiatry which is that\nmental illnesses don't exist in the\nvacuum that they actually require a\nparticular\nenvironment to come out so for example\nwe also know that like major depressive\ndisorder can manifest in stressful jobs\nin stressful relationships\nthere's one study that actually shows\nthat the student teacher ratio\ncorrelates with the degree of ADHD\ndiagnosis so if I have one teacher and\n30 students\nkeeping all of those 30 students on task\nis very very difficult and so if there's\na kid who's got an ADHD predisposition\nthey start to act out more because they\ndon't get as much individualized\nattention as they need so as we actually\nincrease the number of teachers to\nstudents students can get more\nindividualized attention as they get\nmore individualized attention their ADHD\nshines through a little bit less so the\nsecond reason that ADHD is on the rise\nis because I actually think there's\nstresses in our school system so as it\nbecomes harder to become a teacher who\nultimately suffers the teacher suffers\nand when they suffer all the kids with\nADHD also suffer because if you've got a\nburnt out teacher they've got a little\nbit less patience to redirect a child\nthey have a little bit less ability to\nsit down and sort of help that child\npractice focus and attention and\norganization reason number three why I\nthink ADHD is on the rise is simply\nbecause of technology so we know that\nthere's a change in technology that is\nshortening our attention spans and we\ncan see this if we look at generally\nspeaking the way that content is\nconsumed on the internet\nso if we look at like originally we had\nblogs right after blogs we had video\nessays after video essays we had like\ncompilations we had Vines now we have\ntick tocks so one of the things that's\nstarting to happen is our attention span\nis shrinking shrinking shrinking\nshrinking shrinking and as our attention\nspan shrinks\nwe sort of move a little bit societally\ntowards ADHD\nthere are some concerns about things\nlike processed foods and stuff like that\nsomething there's also some evidence\nthat as the average age of parents Rises\nthe amount of ADHD may be correlating\nwith that too so there are some\nepidemiologic factors but I'd say like\nthe three or four major reasons why ADHD\nis on the rise is first of all because\nwe're catching it more secondly because\nwe're shortening our attention spans and\nthird because we've actually got a lot\nof stress on our school system which\nmeans that it's harder to accommodate\nneuroatypical kids next question is why\nis ADHD more common in males so this is\na really good question so we do know\nthat ADHD is more common in males for\nsure what maturity really is is frontal\nlobe development and we know that boys\nfrontal lobes tend to develop a little\nbit slower than girls so boys tend to be\na little bit more impulsive they tend to\nbe a little bit more wavering in terms\nof their attention sometimes they're\nlike a little bit less conscientious\nespecially at early ages and so we do do\nknow that there are some very specific\ngender effects in terms of how boys are\nnow there's also looser evidence that\nfor example ADHD is a manifestation of\ndynamic attention and that the male\ngender is required Dynamic attention\nfrom on a more evolutionary aspect so if\nyou think a little bit about there's\nthis hypothesis that isn't really\ncorrect I mean I think it's been\nsomewhat debunked about hunters and\nfarmers and these are kind of two\npersonality types or cognitive Styles\nand in a lot of societies the hunters\ntend to be men and if you think about\nwhat Hunters need to do they need to\nintegrate a lot of stimuli and need to\nhave a very Dynamic attention so there\nmay actually be some kind of selective\npressure on the male gender for having a\nmore Dynamic attention and when you have\na kid who's got a dynamic attention that\nwas sort of like evolved to be out in\nthe wilderness where they're tracking\nthings and noticing Footprints and\nnoticing broken things over like broken\nTwigs over there and they're sort of\nlike on the lookout for danger and you\nstick that kid in a classroom for eight\nhours there their brain is not really\ndesigned for that why is ADHD treated\nwith stimulants so this is a great\nquestion it can be kind of paradoxical\nand I remember before I sort of did my\nPsychiatry training I was always really\nconfused about using stimulants in kids\nwith ADHD so here was kind of my my\nunderstanding which is that okay so if\nyou have a kid who's got add or ADHD\ntheir mind is moving really really\nreally fast to begin with they're having\na thousand thoughts a second they're\nalso fidgety they move their arms around\na lot hands around a lot right they\ncan't sit still and what we also know is\nthat stimulants tend to like ramp people\nup right so when I drink caffeine in the\nmorning my thoughts start to move faster\nmy mind feels more sluggish before\ncaffeine we also know that you know\ncaffeine and other kinds of stimulants\nwill also lead to things like fidgetness\nand stuff like that like I remember\nbeing a medical student and seeing\npeople who would use cocaine or\namphetamine and they'd be like picking\nat themselves and like itching and like\nalways fidgety and you know they can't\nsit still so I was super confused\nbecause it seemed like stimulants should\nmake ADHD worse right don't we want to\nlike slow people with ADHD down so this\nis what's really fascinating about\nstimulants and why we use the ones that\nwe use is because what they actually\nstimulate is activity in the frontal\nlobes so the way that stimulants work in\nADHD is our our brain has a gas pedal\nand it has a break and what the\nstimulants actually stimulate is the\nbreak so they actually act in the\nfrontal lobes and then allow the frontal\nlobes to strengthen the frontal lobes to\ninhibit other parts of our brain so what\nwe're actually stimulating is our\ninhibitory circuitry as we stimulate our\ninhibitory circuitry the ability for our\nmind to wander reduces our impulsivity\nreduces even some of our psychomotor\nactivity like the fidgetness will\nactually go down so or actually\nstimulating is our breaks or our\ninhibitory circuitry next one is is ADHD\na disability great question so let's\nstart by understanding what a disability\nis generally speaking the definition\nthat I like to use for a disability is\nsomething that makes your ability to\nparticipate in life unequitable\nso if we think about disabilities it's\nnot that this person is good or bad or\nthat they have more value or less value\nit's that life is structured in a\nparticular way that assumes that human\nbeings have a particular ability to to\ndo things so simple example is Blindness\nright so our our society is structured\nin a way that relies on site as being\nable to function right so we'll have\nroad signs for example we have cars we\nhave traffic lights we have signs that\nshow what's for sale and what isn't so\nwe have all of these visual dependent\nthings that our society kind of\nfunctions on and if you can't see then\nsuddenly you're at a huge disadvantage\nand participating in life because of the\nway that Society is structured is ADHD a\ndisability I'd say it can be so for some\npeople their ADHD is so severe that some\nof the assumptions that we have in terms\nof how life happens people with ADHD are\nnot really able to participate in and\nthere are a lot of simple examples of\nthis like one is that you know people\nshowing up on time so in general our\nsociety is designed with things like\nappointments where you show up at a\nparticular time and like you assume that\neveryone else shows up at a particular\ntime our society is built with things\nlike deadlines right so there's a lot of\nlike time related stuff that is baked\ninto our society which people with ADHD\nreally really really struggle with now\neven if it's a disability that doesn't\nmean that it isn't fixable so we know\nfor example that even if people are\nblind we have like sort of some audio\naccessibility options I don't know that\nyou can drive yet but maybe you'll be\nable to you can certainly walk with a\nstick we have like crosswalks that will\nsort of tell you verbally they'll use\nsound instead of just light to let you\nknow that it's safe to cross so we can\nstart to make accommodations and you can\nmake those kinds of accommodations as\nwell we cover a lot of this stuff by the\nway in Dr K's guide to ADHD and doing\nstuff about how you can sort of use\norganizational tools uh prioritization\ntechniques things like that a lot of\nthings that people with ADHD really\nstruggle with will sort of teach you how\nto do that and what we've actually found\neven if you look at cognitive behavioral\ntherapy for ADHD a lot of CBT is sort of\nlike a how to organize and prioritize\nyour life 101 kind of stuff so I think\ncertainly it can sometimes rise to the\nlevel of disability because our our\nsociety doesn't really\naccommodate people who have struggles to\nbe on time for example and at the same\ntime just like we can have you know\nhandicap accessible ramps for\nwheelchairs there's a lot of stuff that\nyou can do to compensate for that\ndisability and actually function within\nlife why is ADHD over diagnosed\nso in my opinion ADHD is both the most\nover diagnosed and under-diagnosed\nillness so why is it over diagnosed so\nthe first thing is that remember that\nADHD has an environmental component to\nit so student teacher ratios will\ndetermine the amount of ADHD that gets\ndiagnosed there are some situations in\nwhich we'll diagnose it in other\nsituations in which the person actually\nwon't get diagnosed so why are we over\ndiagnosing ADHD a couple of reasons one\nis that\na lot of the symptoms of ADHD\nare very relatable so if we look at I\nhave difficulty concentrating I can't\nsit still I sometimes forget things I\nhave difficulty staying organized the\nsymptoms of ADHD are so much of a\nuniversal experience that a lot of\npeople will think that they have ADHD\nbecause who doesn't have difficulty\nconcentrating I can't sit still in a\nclass for eight hours and have my mind\nwander so since there are so many\nsymptoms which are actually within the\nnormal range of Human Experience a lot\nof people will think that they have ADHD\nthe second reason that it gets diagnosed\na lot is because if you get diagnosed\nwith ADHD and you don't actually have\nADHD it oftentimes works out in your\nadvantage so if I'm a college student\nand I want to do well in my classes and\nI have difficulty focusing and even if I\ndon't have ADHD if I can get diagnosed\nwith ADHD and get prescribed a stimulant\nit will actually make my college life in\nsome ways easier it'll be easier to\nstudy it'll be easier to get good grades\nso part of the reason that I see a lot\nof people push for a diagnosis is\nbecause in some ways getting diagnosed\nwith ADHD especially if you don't have\nit can lead to advantages so I think the\nnumber one reason we miss diagnoses of\nADHD is in the case of a high IQ\nso most of the adults that I've\ndiagnosed with ADHD actually have very\nhigh IQ and how do those two things\nrelate well generally speaking the\nsmarter the child is the more they can\ncompensate for the shortcomings of ADHD\nso they develop all of these adaptations\nor compensation mechanisms that allow\nthem to essentially continue to get good\ngrades so it's not that I can actually\nstudy but I'm just so friggin smart that\nI don't need to study so sometimes the\ndiagnosis of ADHD stays incredibly\nsilent as people come up with\ncompensatory mechanisms and IQ is at the\ntop of the list\nis ADHD curable\nokay so I'm going to say that the answer\nis yes and no we don't think about\npsychiatric diagnoses as curable so we\nthink about curable diagnoses as things\nthat can be permanently fixed right so\nan infection is a good example of an\nexternal thing that invades your body\nand can be sort of like altered there\nmay be other sources of things that can\nbe let's say curable like let's say I do\nbypass surgery for my heart I have a\nclogged artery I literally attach a new\nartery that artery is open fixes the\nblood flow essentially cures the problem\nthe problem with psychiatric illnesses\nis that we can't go in and like stick\nsomething into your brain that'll fix it\nand furthermore the psychiatric\nillnesses that we have especially things\nlike ADHD have to do with the function\nof our frontal lobes right so it's not\nlike an illness that we can fix it's the\nway that our neurons are wired so on the\none hand it would kind of imply that\npsychiatric illnesses are not curable\non the flip side\nwhat we do know is that with effective\ntreatment\nit's essentially as if you no longer\nhave ADHD so let's go through a couple\nof things that can quote unquote cure\nADHD the first is that frontal lobes\ndevelop until you're about the age of 30\nor 32. and we do know that somewhere\nbetween 10 and 25 percent of people will\nquote unquote grow out of ADHD and what\ndoes that mean so ADHD is a disorder of\nour basically our frontal lobes and so\nas our frontal lobes continue to mature\nsome of us are kind of right on the cusp\nwhere the ADHD is mild enough that\nfrontal lobe maturation basically gets\nus across the line and then we can\nessentially live normal lives but\nremember that number is pretty small\nit's like basically 10 to 25 percent\nso the next really interesting thing is\nthat if you look at Psychotherapy for\nADHD versus medication for ADHD what you\ntend to find is that if you start\nsomewhere on medication or Psychotherapy\nthat the outcomes are about the same so\nthey both help about the same amount\nthe interesting thing is that within six\nmonths of stopping medication the\nsymptoms of ADHD will usually return to\nBaseline but in the case of\npsychotherapy and this is what's really\ninteresting it takes about two years for\nthe symptoms to start to return which\nbegs the question if there isn't a\nstimulant in my mind that kind of gets\nwashed out of my system what on Earth\nwhy doesn't the ADHD come back within\none year shouldn't it come back kind of\nright away and that's where if we really\nlook at the mechanisms of psychotherapy\nfor ADHD a lot of that stuff is kind of\nlike cognitive training or almost\nneuronal training or teaching particular\nskills that compensate for the ADHD like\nhow to develop a to-do list how to stay\norganized how to set alarms and\nreminders and the cool thing is that if\nwe can start to implement some of those\nthings\nit essentially removes the ADHD from the\nequation personally clinically I've\nworked with a lot of people who\nessentially have sustained remission in\nADHD like they've been two years out\nfrom treatment and are actually doing\nlike totally fine sometimes I'll get a\nChristmas card from them or they'll call\nme around the holidays and they'll be\nlike hey Dr K like just wanted to let\nyou know you know Merry Christmas I'll\nbe like how are you or your symptoms\nback they're like no actually I'm\ntotally fine there do seem to be cases\nwhere people can kind of like grow out\nof it or have a sustainable solution\nthat kind of works for them\nso even though we don't really know\nwhether ADHD can be curable or not what\nwe do know is that there are definitely\nthings that you can Implement in your\nlife that will basically cancel it out\nthe last thing is that we also know that\nthere are ways to strengthen the frontal\nlobes so meditation is a good example of\nsomething that strengthens the frontal\nlobes that has more of a let's say\npermanent effect so if you meditate for\na long period of time your frontal lobes\nwill strengthen if you continue to\nmeditate every day they'll be kind of\ngenerally stronger but there's some\namount of almost permanent effect from\nit so there are I would say permanent\ngains to be made with ADHD treatment\neven if we can't quite call it a cure\nhow can you prevent ADHD what a\nfascinating question so what I'm going\nto do now is actually depart a little\nbit from science\nso\nit is my belief\nthat if you isolate the different\nproblems that ADHD\nhas like if you look at the Neuroscience\ndeficiencies let's say impulsivity\nlet's say the inability to do delayed\ngratification it is my belief and I'm\nrunning a trial of sorts on this as we\nspeak\nthat you can actually teach a child\nparticular skills that will compensate\nfor their Neuroscience deficiencies and\nI'll give you all just a simple example\nso one example is that\npeople with ADHD have difficulty\ndelaying gratification okay\nso what that sort of means is that like\nthere's a very famous kind of a test\ncalled the marshmallow test where you\ncan offer a child one marshmallow now or\ntwo marshmallows in five or ten minutes\nit's the simple idea that if I make a\nsacrifice today I can get more tomorrow\nthat people with ADHD really struggle\nwith so normal kids will be able to wait\nfive minutes ten minutes that also has\nto do to some degree with your\npersonality structure your degree of\nconscientiousness but ADHD kids are\nnotorious at getting instant\ngratification and being vulnerable to\ninstant gratification\nso I was playing a game with someone\nthat I care about deeply recently and I\nwas playing this game with them\nintentionally and the game is this card\ngame called Jaipur and it's a really\nlovely board game and a key part of the\nboard game it's a trading game where you\naccumulate cards but the key thing is\nthat\nthe more cards you sell the more items\nyou sell at one time you get like\nstackable bonuses so you get sort of\nlike an multiplier on the points that\nyou score depending on\nyou know how long you wait to sell stuff\nso if I sell one of an item I'll get 1.0\nif I sell two of an item I'll get 1.0 if\nI sell three of an item I'll get 1.2 if\nI sell four of an item I'll get 1.4 and\nif I sell five of an item I'll get 1.6\nor 1.8\nso it's my belief that this game\nactually trains the brain to learn the\nskill of delayed gratification that as I\nwas working with this one particular\nperson\nI started playing the game with them and\nthen originally they would see like a\nshiny Gem and they'd sell it right away\nbecause they wanted the points and over\nthe course of teaching them this game\nwhat we've actually learned is that\nthey've started to delay their\ngratification some and not only if they\ndelay their gratification within the\ngame I've noticed a change in terms of\ntheir ability to delay gratification in\nother parts of their life so I am\nstarting to really believe that you\ncould what you can really do is\nunderstand all of the Neuroscience\ndeficits of ADHD and start to actually\nTarget and train those specific skills\nso if you've got a kid who's kind of on\nthat ADHD path and you take some of\nthese principles from like CBT of ADHD\nand actually start to teach them to the\nChild Teach the child to meditate teach\nthe child to be less impulsive you can\npotentially\ntrain some of those skills now is the\nscientifically valid not really but\nthere's you know this is something that\nI'm really starting to believe is\npossible based on this one experiment\nthat I happen to be running okay last\nquestion is how can ADHD affect your\nperformance in school\nthe short answer is that ADHD can really\nmess with your school performance\nand um you know like I don't want to say\nthis but like basically school is not\ndesigned for the ADHD brain school is\ndesigned for the neurotypical brain so\nschool is designed under a couple of\nassumptions one is that students have a\ncertain level of organization second is\nthat students have a certain amount of\nability to prioritize students have a\ncertain amount of impulse control so\nI'll give you all a simple example so\nlet's look at how or the last thing is\nschools have a certain amount of\nattentional assumptions on the part of\ntheir students so let's tunnel down into\nthat for a second if you think about\nschool school has two ways that we learn\nright you sit in a class and the teacher\ntalks to you way number one\nsecond thing is homework and the idea is\nthat homework\nis a reinforcement of what you learned\nin school right so there's this\nassumption that we teach things in class\nand those things get reinforced and\nsolidified through homework\nnow that school system is designed on\nthe assumption that when there is a\nteacher in class who is teaching for 50\nminutes that the student will learn\nsomething obviously right that's why we\nhave classes\nbut imagine what happens if for example\nyou're a student in that class let's say\nyou're doing a zoom lecture and your\ninternet connection goes out let's say\nevery five minutes your internet\nconnection disappears for five minutes\nso you only get 50 of what the teacher\nteaches\nnow what kind of disadvantage do you\nthink that person would have because the\ndisadvantage that they face is greater\nthan just what they missed right because\nnow when they get assigned homework they\nactually have to teach themselves all of\nthe gaps so whereas homework may cause\ntake a one hour for a regular student\nfor the kid with ADHD not only do they\nhave to go and make up let's say the 30\nminutes of class that they've missed out\non but they have to like do some amount\nof catch-up learning an additional 30\nminutes to one hour to complete the one\nhour of homework so whereas one student\ncan accomplish something within two\nhours one hour of class and one hour of\nhomework the kid with ADHD\nhas to have one hour of homework one\nhour a half an hour of like patching up\nclass and an additional half an hour of\nlike sort of fixing everything so that\nthey can do the homework so the ADHD kit\nit costs them three hours instead of two\nand we're not even considering for a\nmoment that the ADHD kids mind is\nwandering while they're doing homework\nwhich is also the case so now when you\nreally think about it what takes two\nhours for a neurotypical kid will take\nfour hours for an ADHD kit and why is\nthat it's because the ADHD mind wanders\nso much in class that half of the class\nis wasted on them\nso I think we oftentimes don't really\nacknowledge or realize how devastating\nADHD can be for a child what it\nessentially means is that you can't\nparticipate in school the way that\nschool is designed and so what ADHD kids\nhave to do is work twice as hard or come\nup with all of these compensatory\nmechanisms to try to fix what they're\nmissing from school and what's so\ndevastating about this and there's so\nmuch research that if you look at kids\nwith ADHD there's a 70 chance that they\nwill develop depression later in life a\nmood disorder and that's absolutely a\ncausative effect so\nthree percent of kids who have major\ndepressive disorder will grow up to have\nADHD but seventy percent of kids who\nhave ADHD will grow up to have major\ndepressive disorder and why is that it's\nbecause life is designed for a\nneurotypical kid and when you go through\nlife as a neuro atypical kid and you\ndon't even know you're neuroatypical all\nyou end up with is man I'm so\nincompetent what is wrong with me how\nare these kids able to do this I know\nI'm just as smart as them but these kids\nare getting A's and I'm struggling with\nc's but why does it take them one hour\nto do homework and it takes me three\nhours to do homework and outside of an\nanswer or an explanation that is given\nto those kids they internalize it as\nshame right because if there's if no one\nexplains it to me what's the most\nnatural conclusion I'm an idiot I'm\nincompetent I'm lazy I'm undisciplined\nas they internalize those things it\nactually manifests depression later in\nlife\nso hard"
