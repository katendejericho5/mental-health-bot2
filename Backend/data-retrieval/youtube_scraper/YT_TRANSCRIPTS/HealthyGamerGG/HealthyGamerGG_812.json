    "transcript": "you shouldn't not go to the police just\nbecause you don't think there's enough\nevidence your job is to go to the police\nif you feel comfortable and let them\nworry about it right all right so we've\ngot a slightly different topic today and\nit's a little bit on the heavier side so\nwe're going to be talking a little bit\nabout sexual assault uh in more more\nspecifically like what happens after\nsexual assault so one of my\num experiences kind of as a psychiatrist\nis that\npeople just don't know what to expect\nand since they don't know what to expect\ntheir ability to seek the appropriate\nsupport is very hampered and the\nsimplest way to put this is like I had a\nfriend recently whose kid went to the\ndentist for the first time and when\nyou've got a kid who goes to the dentist\nfor the first time there's a lot of\nanxiety right the kid doesn't know what\nto expect\nand so if the kid had a choice they\nwould never go to the dentist because\nthere's like a weird chair and I've\nheard there are drills involved and\nthere are these metal instruments and\nlike you have to keep my mouth like it's\nlike a very frightening experience even\nfirst haircuts can be frightening\nand so\nif we really think about it like how do\nwe help that child engage in the support\nthat they need we have to talk to the\nchild hey here's what to expect I know\nyou're scared everyone is scared and\nhere's the right way to proceed\nand what I kind of noticed as a as a\npsychiatrist I saw patients kind of in\nthe emergency room\num you know immediately after sexual\nassaults but then I also saw people\nafter sexual assaults like days later so\nsometimes people would be hospitalized\nand like they'd come in over the weekend\nand I show up on Monday morning for my\njob and they've been there for three\ndays\nI'd sometimes see people Weeks Later\nwhere you know they they thought they\nwere okay but then they'd sort of\npresent to care because they're starting\nto feel having flashbacks or nightmares\nor things like that and then I'd also\nsee people months or even years later\nthese are people that may have been\nabused at some point or assaulted early\non and then a decade later they're\nhaving trouble in their marriage or in\nrelationships so I've kind of seen\npeople like all across the spectrum of\nsexual assault in terms of duration\nafterward\nand what I realized is that like we\ndon't actually do a good job of telling\npeople like what to expect\nand so what I'd love to do today is\nshare some research so it's not just\ngoing to be my opinion but essentially\nlike\nif you or a loved one has been sexually\nassaulted what to expect like what is\nthe process like because there's so many\nthings about this that are hard to begin\nwith dealing with the assault in and of\nitself in that moment is very difficult\nbut a lot of times what people don't\nrealize is there are all kinds of\nlingering effects which we don't even\nrealize may be related to the assault\nand then we end up blaming ourselves for\nso for example difficulty with sexuality\nor uh I mean sexual relationships or\nromantic relationships after an assault\nis very common but three years later you\nknow what I've found when I talk to to\npatients that I've worked with is\nthey're like I should be over it by now\nright it wasn't that bad they'll say all\nthese different kinds of things to\nthemselves which are actually like\nreally devastating and harmful\nso what I'd love to do is I just kind of\nin a very simple way talk to you all\ntoday about first of all like\npsychologically what to expect after a\nsexual assault\num you know it's not going to be like\nperfect because everyone is different\nthat's one of the key things to remember\nanother thing is is sort of from a\nmedical standpoint like understanding\nwhat the process post-sexual assault is\nlike so that you can make an informed\ndecision or a friend can make an\ninformed decision about why when and how\nto seek medical care and then the third\nthing that I'm going to touch on which\nis really well outside of my expertise\nbut I've had to learn some about is sort\nof a legal standpoint so if police get\ninvolved what does that look like etc\netc\nokay so I'd like to talk to you all\nabout the psychology involving sexual\nassault medicine involving sexual\nassault you may say well what how are\nthose things different we'll explain and\nthen almost like a law enforcement\nstandpoint and the goal of this is is\njust to equip you all with some basic\ninformation\nbecause one of the things I even\nremember seeing this in terms of therapy\nwhere a lot of people are scared to go\nto therapy because they don't know what\nto expect and one of the most useful\nthings that I've ever done is talk to\npeople about what to expect from therapy\nreally nuts and bolts stuff so you're\ngoing to walk into a room\nit's going to be you and one person and\nthey're going to ask you some questions\nif you have any questions you can even\nstart by asking hey can you tell me how\nthis works and so giving like really\nreally practical almost advice or\norientation\nand the thing is sexual assault is is\nsuch a private matter which makes\nperfect sense but then we don't you know\nwe'll educate people about like dangers\nright but we don't tell people what to\nexpect\nand so what I'd love to do in whatever\nlittle way that I can is share some of\nmy experience in some data so a couple\nof disclaimers the first is that what\nI'm going to be talking about is going\nto be culturally dependent so the\nresources and science that I'm drawing\non are predominantly are from systems\nfrom North America the U.S Canada and\nthe UK and parts of Europe so your\nmileage may vary a lot depending on what\npart of the world you're in but\ngenerally speaking\nthe UK Canada and the U.S have very very\nsimilar systems and that's what we're\ngoing to kind of be leaning on okay\nanother uh kind of obvious disclaimer is\nthat we are talking about a slightly\nheavier topic so if that's something\nthat is uncomfortable for you you're\nwelcome to step out or pause the video\nor come back later or whatever but my\nhope is to present some kind of very\nsimple resource about telling people\nwhat to expect after sexual assault\nso let's start with the psychology so\nthe first thing to understand about\nsexual assault is that people respond\nvery very very very very very very very\ndifferently\nso the first thing that's really bizarre\nis that one-third of people have almost\nno reaction to it so I've worked like\neveryone sort of assumes that sexual\nassault is a deeply emotional and\ntraumatizing experience and I'm not\nsaying that it isn't but what I'm saying\nis people experience that in very\ndifferent ways so I've worked with\npeople who for example will will sort of\nlike they're not even really like they\ndon't have PTSD or anything afterward\nthere's evidence that not everyone gets\nPTSD right so there's let's just talk\nabout that for a second\nso there have been parts of the world\nthat you know people have experienced\ngenocide so this is a population of\nlet's say a hundred thousand people who\nhave a shared traumatic experience and\nwhat we know from research is that some\npeople are more resilient than others\nsome people will be diagnosed with\nthings like PTSD or chronic PTSD and\nsome people are actually like mentally\nhealthy if you like kind of screen them\neven though something terrible happened\nto them they're able to handle it in a\nmore healthy way and they actually don't\nget diagnosed with any illness so that\nvariability of human response is also\ntrue of sexual assault I've worked with\npeople who are able to acknowledge that\nlike yeah it was bad like yeah it sucked\nwhile it happened but I'm actually okay\nI still feel okay with myself I still\nfeel loved by my family you know I'm\ndefinitely gonna learn some things from\nit and it wasn't my fault and they're\nable to kind of cope with it in a\nhealthy manner so it's really bizarre\nbut it really only two-thirds or\none-third of people really report almost\nno reaction after a sexual assault\na couple of other things to consider the\nfirst is that people underestimate how\nsomatic or physical the reaction to\nsexual assault is so I'm talking about\ndays and even weeks or months people\nwill experience physical complaints so\nsometimes this is really confusing for\npeople because they're like I'm not\nhaving nightmares I'm not having\nflashbacks you know I'm not paranoid\nevery time I leave the house I can leave\nthe house I can I can go to work I can\nstudy but I just can't eat anything\nanytime I eat solid food I feel really\nreally nauseous or I've had diarrhea for\nweeks and I have no idea what's going on\nso the first thing to understand is up\nto about half of people will have\nsomatic complaints so the primary\nresponse from their body is not\npsychological it's actually physical so\nthere are stress hormones that are\npumping through your body and so it\nmesses with your GI system makes\npeople's stomach upset and I've seen GI\nupset and GI system related things to be\nthe most common\nyou can also see flaring up of other\nchronic medical conditions so you'll see\nworsening of things like autoimmune\ndisorders and things like that so you\ncan sometimes almost have a physical\nmanifestation and let's remember that\nour body and mind are connected so\nhaving physical problems after sexual\nassault is completely scientifically\nvalid okay so sometimes there are\nabsolutely somatic complaints\nnext thing is that in terms of the\nimmediate response we talked about how a\nthird of people don't really have any\nresponse but it's also just as normal to\nexperience all kinds of different\nemotional things so the one very very\nvery common experience is a sense of\nguilt or shame that too is almost\nneurologically mediated so we have this\npart of our brain that engages something\ncalled counter factual thinking and this\nis the part of our brain that helps us\nlearn from mistakes and usually when we\nmake a mistake we experience some amount\nof negative emotion with it and that\nnegative emotion is actually a\nmotivation a motivator to change\nBehavior so if I fail to test and I\ndidn't study then what what happens is\nmy mind starts thinking okay what could\nI have done differently and I feel a\nlittle bit ashamed for for failing a\ntest\nand so then I start to think okay well\nmaybe what I should have done is start\nstudying earlier okay it makes perfect\nsense right in the case of a test and so\nwhat we see is that after a negative\noutcome that is hurtful to us we\nexperience some degree of guilt and\nshame and start thinking about what we\ncould have done differently in the case\nof sexual assault this can absolutely\nhappen\nand what we run into is something that's\nactually a little bit different\nwhich is that in the case of sexual\nassault it may not actually be our fault\nright but that part of our brain doesn't\nreally know that so in the same way that\nsomething bad happened to us so I'm\ngoing to experience guilt and shame and\nI'm going to think about what I could\nhave done differently that can sometimes\ncross over into feeling responsible so\nthis is where other people and this is\nwhat's so confusing if you've gone\nthrough this is you'll say oh my god\nlet's say heaven forbid you've been\nassaulted but what I what I'll hear from\npatients is they'll say oh my God it's\nlike I shouldn't have been so stupid and\nthen what other people do is they'll say\noh no no no it's not your fault it's not\nyour fault it's not your fault don't\nthink that way\nand those kinds of statements can\nactually be a little bit of a\ndouble-edged sword because I agree it's\nnot your fault I think that's sort of\nfactually true and at the same time what\ndo you think that does for the person\nwho's been assaulted\nit almost makes them feel more isolated\nand less understood because now I have\n10 people telling me it's not my fault\nand then I feel even worse because my\nbrain is telling me it is my fault so\nnow not only did this thing happen to me\nbut I am so disconnected and everyone\nelse is telling me that I shouldn't be\nthinking this way which can make people\nfeel even worse\nso we see a lot of Shame and guilt very\ncommon reactions we'll also see\ndissociation so this is where sometimes\nwhat happens even during a sexual\nassault and there's kind of lots of\ninteresting Neuroscience that explores\nthis phenomenon where you'll kind of\nunplug\nfrom yourself\nso it almost feels like\nyou're not living within your body that\nyour body is kind of like this robot and\nyou're kind of watching it from the\noutside so it's a very very strange or\nbizarre experience chances are that that\nis almost protective right that's what I\nkind of that's where my money is that\nthis is a protective neurological\nresponse so that you don't suffer quite\nas much so dissociation tends to be\ntriggered by traumatic events and and\nhelps people sort of gain distance from\nit so it's very common for people to\nexperience dissociation as well\nfrom an emotional standpoint what we\ntend to see is that um\nthe most common emotion actually is not\nshame or guilt is not fear the most\ncommon uh emotion that people experience\nafter assault is anger so 59 of people\nwill feel angry which is also something\nthat if you look at kind of like media\ndepictions\nwhen someone's like anytime the media\ndepicts someone who's been assaulted\nthey're withdrawn they're quiet they're\nkind of like you know they're crying and\nI'm not saying that those aren't\nappropriate reactions but it's kind of\ninteresting because the most common\nexperience and this is based on Research\n59 of people feel anger about 40 percent\nof people feel fear or anxiety and the\nreason that I'm sharing these statistics\nwith you is just to highlight that if\nyou've gone through this if someone\nyou've no you've known has gone through\nthis or does go through this for you to\nunderstand that if you feel pissed and\nyou don't react the way that people in\nthe movies react and you don't react the\nway that your friends think you should\nreact that's actually totally fine\nso what is the right reaction to sexual\nassault whatever you feel like obviously\nI don't think you should hurt yourself\nor hurt other people which by the way\nis an important thing to consider so\nafter a sexual assault you do see\nfeelings of increased suicidal ideation\nso sometimes those feelings of guilt or\nshame or pain or numbness or\ndissociation can be so overpowering that\npeople will start to think about ending\ntheir life if that kind of thing happens\nyou should definitely get medical care I\nthink you should get medical care no\nmatter what happens and we'll get to\nthat later later on but that is actually\na relatively common experience so that\ntoo is is in a sense I mean it's not\nhealthy but it's normal it's like it's\nit's a natural reaction it does not mean\nthat anything is wrong with you the\nother good news is that that usually\ngets better with time so the other good\nthing that that I really found as a\nclinician is that most people who\nexperience assault are not screwed for\nthe rest of their life\nthere are all kinds of problems that\nhappen but that even if you look at for\nexample sexual dysfunction so here's\nanother thing that a lot of people will\nexperience\nafter a sexual assault they'll have\ndifficulty engaging in sex so this could\nbe everything from difficulty getting\naroused right so they're not as\ninterested in sex to physiologic changes\nso sometimes uh you know people will\nhave difficulty getting an erection or\nyou know women will have vaginal spasms\nso like like the the entrance to the\nvagina kind of those muscles will go\ninto spasm and so it's hard to actually\nengage in sexual activity for both men\nand women\nor non-binary persons so there are all\nkinds of changes that can happen in\nterms of psychologically physiologically\nit doesn't mean that there's anything\nwrong with you the other thing that's\nreally interesting is that\num there's also difficulties for example\nachieving orgasms so even if you are\nable to physiologically perform\nyour mind and whatever neurochemical\nneural circuitry is necessary to\nactually complete a sexual act may be\nkind of hampered in some way so that too\nis like honestly like kind of normal and\nit's okay it doesn't mean that you're\nscrewed in some way and that's the\nreason that I really want to give this\ntalk is because so many of the people\nthat I've worked with not only does the\nassault happen but all of the\nphysiologic and psychological\nconsequences make people feel like\nthey're even more broken\nthey're like oh crap not only did I have\nto deal with this crap one day one year\nago but now it's been a year and I still\ncan't achieve orgasm\nso the good news about this stuff\nactually is that it tends to resolve\nwithin about a year so the majority of\nthe research shows that sexual\ndysfunction following sexual assault\ntends to resolve within a year there's\nalso evidence there are certainly cases\nwhere it doesn't resolve within a year\nand that sometimes years later some\nthings can persist so issues of like you\nknow safety\num still difficulty with arousal and\nstuff like that so a lot of it seems to\nnaturally get better or get better with\ntreatment over the course of a year and\nthere's a lot of stuff that can persist\nthe good news there is that even if it\npersists if you engage in treatment\nthere's very solid evidence that shows\nthat even if people have experienced\nsexual assault chronic sexual assault\nyou know all kinds of things we're\ntalking about sexual abuse and childhood\nthat with uh tools like therapy they can\nactually start to engage in healthy\nmeaningful romantic and sexual\nrelationships\nso I'm going to just pause for a second\nand make sure I didn't leave anything\nout\num\noh yeah so a couple of other things one\nis that uh the other thing I didn't\nmention about sexuality is that\navoidance post-sexual assault is very\nvery common so not just avoidance of\nsexual stuff but avoidance of social\nsituations avoidance of even leaving the\nhome that's all really common so it's\nnot unusual for people to really like\nwant to avoid all kinds of stuff whether\nthat it's it's their own emotions\nwhether it's romantic Partners whether\nit's leaving the house\nthe last thing to consider is that\nsometimes after a sexual assault people\nwill actually meet the criteria for an\nillness\nso the most common are trauma-related\ndisorders no surprise so people can\nsometimes develop PTSD so PTSD is\npost-traumatic stress disorder which is\ncharacterized by things like nightmares\nflashbacks what we call hyper vigilance\nor hyper arousal so you're like paying\nattention to the environment it's\ndifficult to relax things like that and\nmood disorders are also really really\ncommon so people will get major\ndepressive disorder less so bipolar\ndisorder in my experience anyway but you\ncan sort of meet criteria for like\nmedical or psychiatric illnesses and\nthen you can also get treatment for\nthose which can get better so I'm really\noptimistic that you can get better no\nmatter what happened\nso next up what I want to do is talk a\nlittle bit about medical stuff after a\nsexual assault and you may be kind of\nconfused by that because you're like\nwell you just talked about PTSD and mood\ndisorders right what do you mean what\nI'm talking about is what to expect from\na medical standpoint in let's say the\nday to weeks after an assault\nso one thing that I would recommend is\nif you don't know what else to do just\ngo to the emergency room or call\nEmergency Services like 9-1-1 or\nwhatever the number isn't where you are\nand you can literally walk into and this\nis this is what I really wanted to share\nis like here's what's going to happen\nwhat I want to do is just tell you\nwhat's going to happen if you get\nsexually assaulted and walk into an\nemergency room so as chances are what's\ngoing to happen I'm this is U.S based\nright but it extends to other countries\nis you're going to go in and then like\nlike there's going to be attendant and\nthey'll be like okay what are you here\nfor and you can even tell that attendant\nI'm here because I was assaulted then\nyou're going to go into a room probably\na nurse will come in and check your\nVital Signs so in emergency rooms when\npeople come in people have different\nlevels of emergencies right so did you\nget shot three times and you have tons\nof internal bleeding or have you been\nvomiting for for hours and are able to\nlike walk and talk but like you really\nneed to stop vomiting or did you\nhave a nosebleed and you don't really\nknow what to do so the first thing that\nhappens is you're going to see someone\ncalled a triage nurse and a nurse is\nthere to basically figure out do we need\nto wheel you to an operating room for\nsurgery or can you sit in a place for an\nhour or two and wait for a doctor to\ncome see you\nthey're going to do things like check\nyour Vital Signs they'll check your\nblood pressure things like that and so\nyou can just tell that nurse and they're\ngoing to ask you what's bringing you\nhere today\nand the nurse you can just tell the\nnurse I was sexually assaulted all you\ngot to say and the nurse will take it\nover from there so this is the key key\nthing to remember\nthere are multiple medical organizations\nthat span the globe right so the\nAmerican Association for Emergency Room\nPhysicians World Health Organization\nguidance on medical care for people\nvictims of sexual assault and all of\nthese organizations develop guidelines\nand protocols the goals of these\nguidelines and Protocols are first of\nall to make you feel safe okay to a\ncertain degree to empower you and I know\nthat sounds kind of weird but what does\nempowerment mean does it mean like oh\nlike we're going to March the streets no\nempowerment means you were just attacked\nwhat you want to happen we want to\nhappen\nso you get to make the choices and this\nis what's so difficult for people post\nsexual assault is they feel so out of\ncontrol a lot of them hesitate to go to\nthe Ed because they don't know what's\ngoing to happen if I go to the emergency\nroom does that mean that I have to go to\ncourt for the next eight weeks and\nsomeone's gonna be put on trial and I\nhave to stand in the witness box and\nthere's gonna be cameras there and all\nthat kind of stuff because no one ever\ntells them no no that's not that doesn't\nhave to happen you can it can happen if\nyou want it to happen\nthe goal of really medical treatment is\nfirst of all safety and empowerment what\nempowerment means is that you get to\nmake the decision\nother uh really really important things\nabout medical care so other uh important\nthings include\nmaking sure that there are not MediCal\nconsequences from the sexual assault so\nwhat they're going to try to do in this\nand we'll get to illegal stuff in a\nsecond is to make sure that you're not\nhurt right so sometimes sexual assault\ncomes with other things maybe you were\nphysically assaulted as part of that\nthere could be different kinds of first\naid that you need you may have rashes\nyou have may have bruises so we want to\nkind of take care of that medical stuff\nthere are also two really really\nimportant things that we we really kind\nof focus on in the medical system the\nfirst is protecting you against\nconsequences from The Assault so that\ncould be things like you know giving you\nprophylactic medication to prevent\nsexually transmitted infections because\nthat can happen\nright so there's like even like there\nare good protocols for example that if\nyou get assaulted by someone who has HIV\nmaybe you have no idea who has you know\nif they have HIV or not but what the\nemergency room is going to give you\nbecause heaven forbid the last thing\nthat you need is an S-Type STI after\nthis experience so there's even like\nreally good protocols that there's post\nexposure prophylaxis for things like HIV\nwhat does that mean post-exposure means\nafter you've been exposed\nto a particular infection you can take\nparticular medication that will prevent\nthe infection from actually working and\ninfecting you so post exposure\nprophylaxis for HIV has pretty good\noutcomes so that's the reason why I\nstrongly recommend that people go to the\nemergency room so you can get medication\nlike that and essentially prevent as\nbest as we can any kind of STIs or other\nconsequences from you know hopefully\nwhat was one bad experience and not\nlonger than that\nother unintended consequences that we\nwant to focus on are preventing\npregnancy so in the case of of female\nvictims you know if that's important to\nyou depending on what contraception\nyou're on or things like that last thing\nthat we want is is unless you want it of\ncourse which you're the boss is for\npeople to get pregnant out of something\nlike a sexual assault\nso what we want to do is medical\nprofessionals make sure you feel safe\nand empowered protect you medically from\nlike consequences down the road and the\nreally sad thing is unfortunately I've\nseen people who don't realize and we\ndon't really expect them to realize\nright because if you're like let's say\nyou're a 19 year old and you're sexually\nassaulted at a party\nthe first thing in your mind is not oh\nlike what kind of STIs could I get like\nyou know people react all kinds of\ndifferent ways maybe you're dissociating\na little bit whatever\nthe next thing that we do that's really\nimportant uh in emergency rooms is\nactually more medical legal\nso chances are this will trigger\nsomething that in the U.S we call the\nsame exam so sane is\num\nI forget what the acronym is I'm\nblanking right now so in other parts of\nthe world and we'll get to other\nacronyms in a second but let me see\nactually if I have it\num\nyeah I didn't include what I'll figure\nout what saint is so it will trigger\nsomething called a sane exam so a sane\nexam is something where the you know\nwith your permission\nspecially trained nurses usually there's\na specific team that's involved we're\nspecially trained nurses who are like\nvery trauma informed right so it's not\ngoing to be just any nurse or any doctor\nit's going to be people who have gone\nthrough uh oh so saying a sexual assault\nnurse examiner thank you very much\npeople have gone through a specific\nlevel of training and certification who\nknow what they're doing will go through\na series of steps with you so these are\nnot only to document injuries and make\nsure you're okay do all that kind of\nmedical stuff but it's also to maintain\na chain of custody for evidence\nso they may uh ask ask to do particular\nthings so say an exam involves like so\nthere's a same kit in some places it's\ncalled a rape kit I personally like\nsaying exam more than rape kit because\nnot all sexual assault\nis rape\num but so they'll they'll do different\nthings like they'll ask if they can you\nknow remove like they'll bring a comb\nand they could like take DNA from your\nhair or other places there are swabs\ninvolved things like that they're going\nto examine you in different places if\nyou're okay with it make sure you're not\nhurt give you appropriate Medical Care\nand they will also collect evidence\nnow there's also like this is something\nthat I want to highlight so when a sane\nexam happens you have a really cool\noption\nwhich is that you can choose to remain\nanonymous\nso what they'll actually do is like if\nyou don't want things to go forward in\nthat direction what the same nurse can\ndo is collect everything but not attach\nyour name to it there's a unique\nidentifier that you're kind of that\nyou're given so that later on they'll\npreserve the evidence but they don't\nhave to attach your name to it yet\nif you decide a week later a month later\na year later hey I decide I actually\nwant to move forward with the legal\nprocess that thing will be sitting and\nthen we'll be processed appropriately so\nthis is really important to understand\njust because you consent to a sane exam\ndoes not mean that anyone is going out\nand being arrested okay it doesn't mean\nthat you're going to wind up in court\nand you have to you know Skip a week of\nwork so that you can accuse someone in\ncourt the the purpose is to really give\nyou\nthe stuff that you may need\nif you decide to move forward in a legal\nway okay now I'm not a certified\nsane examiner right so if there's people\nI may be getting part of this wrong this\nis kind of a combination of what I've\nresearched as well as what I've seen so\nfor example when I'm in a psychiatrist\nin the emergency room\nI will help someone when they come in\nafter a sexual assault but once the sane\nnurse shows up I will step out of the\nroom and let them do their thing I may\nconnect with them afterward and say hey\nis there any stuff like any medical\ninjuries that I need to be concerned\nabout or you know how do you think\nthey're doing then I'll step back in and\ntalk to the patient if they're open to\nit so we'll kind of like emergency room\nfolks will work with the same folks but\nwe call the same folks because they're\nthe experts okay so we want to maintain\na chain of evidence we want to make sure\nthat you're medically okay we want to\norient you the other thing that that the\nsame teams can do\nis also connect you with appropriate\naftercare so while I think it's a good\nidea for you to go to the emergency room\nI think that's a good advice\nrecognize that you can get plugged into\nsupport after you leave so let's say a\nweek later you do have an upset stomach\nlet's say a month later you are having\nproblems in your relationship the key\nanother really awesome part of the\nprocess is that what we want to do is\ngive you resources and plug you in to\nadditional things should you need them\nso that's kind of like a real important\ngoal and I I've seen a difference in the\npeople who get plugged in and can kind\nof start dealing with things as soon as\nthey pop up as opposed to people who are\nlike okay like three months later and\nI'm not blaming these people right\nbecause it's hard it's it's scary and\nthat's why we're making this video\nbecause no one knows what to expect\nthree months later they're like okay I'm\nhaving like some kind of PTSD or\nsomething and then they call someone and\nthey schedule an appointment and that\nappointment is 10 weeks away and then\nyou know six months have gone by now\nyou've had untreated the PTSD for six\nmonths you're on academic probation or\nyou're on probation at work because you\ncan't sleep at night because you've got\nnightmares and then Things become a lot\nharder so I'd strongly recommend that\npeople go and get medical care you know\nit's we're really there to help and the\nkey thing to remember is that ultimately\nyou're the boss and we're gonna do or\nnot do whatever you want there may be\nsome really important exceptions to that\nlike so for example if you're acutely\nsuicidal after a sexual assault like\nwe're not going to let you leave the\nhospital you may be hospitalized in that\nkind of case but that's it's really for\nyour safety generally speaking 99 of the\ntime and by 99 of the time I mean like\nyou know I may have seen a hundred\npatients who are in that situation I can\nonly think of hospitalizing one but the\nvast vast majority I mean the the goal\nis to keep you safe Empower you and\nmitigate the damage that's been done and\nsort of help support you in the next\nsteps\nthe third thing that I want to talk a\nlittle bit about is law enforcement so\nthis is once again\num a resource that is a little bit the\nmost outside of my wheelhouse\nbut it's important to remember that in\nlaw enforcement hopefully\nand I I feel pretty good about this by\nthe way I know that there's a lot of um\nnegative press in media around law\nenforcement my experience with law\nenforcement around sexual assault has\nbeen overwhelmingly positive okay so I\ntrained in Boston so that may have\nsomething to do with it because the law\nenforcement there is particularly good\num but generally speaking I do think\nthat there are so there's there are\nthere are specific officers that much\nlike nurses go through a special kind of\ntraining for sexual assault victims and\nso this is called the s-a-r-t sart which\nis sexual assault response team so if\nyou call 9-1-1 the other thing that you\ncan do in addition to going to the\nemergency room is you can walk into a\npolice station and you can walk into a\npolice station or call you know the\npolice hotline or whatever you can do it\nminutes after the assault days after the\nassault weeks after the assault or years\nafter the assault you can go in any time\nand when you go in they're actually\ngoing to be and you just tell them hey\nI've experienced a sexual assault\nin the case of the emergency room\nsometimes the sart team is combined so\nthe the start team can include nurses so\nthe goal of of the sexual assault\nresponse team is to have kind of medical\nand law enforcement stuff kind of work\ntogether to to give the victim uh or the\nSurvivor kind of the best experience\npossible\nand so they may do things like interview\nyou and and things like that and the\nmost important thing that I kind of\nlearned by talking to some of my\ncolleagues who are in law enforcement is\nthat a lot of people hesitate to engage\nin law enforcement\nfour reasons that their brain tells them\nlike the assault wasn't that bad or I\ndon't have enough proof right well maybe\nyou were assaulted and the person used\ngloves or or you know used other kinds\nof things sort of like you don't think\nthere was DNA or like whatever\nthere are all kinds of reasons or\nanother really really common thing is\nthat oh the person was someone that I\nknew or was even in a relationship with\nright so I recently saw that there was a\na court in India that for the first time\ndeclared that sexual assault is possible\nwithin the marital relationship so prior\nto this ruling like there was kind of\nthis idea that if you're married like\nyou can't be sexually assaulted by your\npartner and so you know there are all\nkinds of things that people will believe\nlike oh if I got sexually assaulted by\nmy husband or wife or whatever that I\ncan't report it because no one will\nbelieve me and all of those kinds of\nthoughts the officers that I've worked\nwith like they recognize that and it's\nnot you shouldn't not go to the police\njust because you don't think there's\nenough evidence your job is to go to the\npolice if you feel comfortable and let\nthem worry about it right so don't worry\nif there aren't like visible injuries or\nanything like that those are the kinds\nof thoughts that people have but it's\nactually completely okay to go to the\npolice immediately after a day after a\nweek after and don't worry about the\nevidence or anything like that they'll\nkind of do the best that they can and\nwhatever you know is appropriate in that\nsituation\nso the good news is that hopefully they\nhave specially trained officers that are\npart of the SAR T be careful about some\nof the things that your mind may tell\nyou and generally speaking I hope that\nyou have a good experience if you work\nwith law enforcement\nmy experience is generally speaking been\nvery good\nokay\num\na couple of other things just uh\num\none last thing is speaking of of you\nknow people won't believe me or you know\nthis is someone that I know so\ntwo-thirds of\nsexual assault perpetrators are known by\nthe victim so that's where like a very\ncommon thing is is you know oh this\nperson is a part of my family or\nsomething like that and and oftentimes\nwhat this is kind of going back to the\npsychological thing\na lot of times people will choose\nnot to report sexual assault because\nparadoxically they don't want to get\npeople in trouble I don't want to make a\nbig deal about it you know I don't want\nto you know I don't want to ruin our\nfamily\nand I in the worst cases the most\ntraumatic cases I've even seen family\nmembers advocate for that kind of thing\nwhere they'll say like oh if you start\ntelling everyone about this it's going\nto tear the family apart like this\nperson's wedding is coming up in two\nweeks right and that's where like do I\nthink that's deplorable absolutely\nand also like that's what I really want\nto explain about this process is that\neven if you are concerned about that\nwhich you are allowed to be concerned\nabout that you are absolutely that's the\nwhole point it's not for outside people\nto judge\nwhat is right and what is wrong that's\nthe big takeaway\nthe cool thing about this process is\nthat you control the speed in the timing\nso this is the kind of situation where\nif someone came to me like a friend came\nto me and said hey\nI was assaulted by a family member I\ndon't want to create trouble what I\nwould say to them is totally understand\nif you don't want to create trouble I\ndon't think you should create trouble\nbut I still think you need to go get\nmedically examined\nand you can keep all the the legal stuff\nAnonymous for now but I absolutely think\nyou need to be examined by a doctor or a\nnurse make sure you're okay you know\nit's not my place to ask you questions\nlike when the assault happened is there\nany exchange of bodily fluids like you\nknow in the case of of uh penetrative\nintercourse was a condom used or not\nused like that's not my role right but\nwhat I would explain to the person is\nyou don't need to go into the details\nbut I do think you should go to a get\nmedical care so that like if that kind\nof stuff did happen that you can be\nappropriately cared for and doesn't have\nother kinds of consequences and I'd also\ntry to orient them to like you don't\nhave to ruin any lives in the next two\nweeks if there's a wedding coming you\ncan just go through that process it'll\nget stored on a shelf for a little while\nthey'll document your injuries they'll\ntake your statement and you can just\ntell law enforcement hey I don't want to\nI want to just like think about this for\na couple of weeks and then you can\nCircle back and choose to press charges\nor not press charges or whatever\nand generally speaking that's been my\nexperience in terms of you get to\ncontrol the flow now I'm not perfect the\nsystem is not perfect I'm not an expert\nin law enforcement and if you listen to\nmy advice and that doesn't happen I\ndeeply deeply apologize I'm not quite\nsure what to say about that what I'm\nbasing this on is my experience as well\nas kind of the published guidelines\nso\nkind of at the end of the day\none of the things that I kind of have\nappreciated as a mental health\nprofessional and psychiatrist is that\npatients don't know what to expect\nright because like even if you look at\nlike what we're taught in schools\nthey're like okay there's touching and\nthere's inappropriate touching\nand then like but people are like okay\nlike so if someone's inappropriately\ntouching what should you do okay you\nshould go tell a grown-up okay fine but\nthen what happens\nand what I tend to find is that a lot of\npeople hesitate to reach out for help\nbecause they don't know what's going to\nhappen next\ndoes this mean that people are going to\npost about it on social media if someone\ngoes and gets investigated does that\nmean they're going to start posting\nabout oh like how I said all these\nthings and I'm I'm a drama queen and\nthis and that like you know like\neveryone is so afraid because they don't\nknow what to expect\nand so what I'd love what I wanted to do\ntoday is just in a very simple way tell\nyou like a little bit of what to expect\na little bit about orienting okay if\nsomething like this happens that's\nterrible to you or a friend\nhere's what to expect even if you are\nthe friend recognize that you're not the\none who went through the assault so like\nthe person who went through it gets to\ndictate the pace if they don't want to\npress charges they don't have to press\ncharges that may upset you as a friend\nbut that's their choice\nright they're the ones who have to go\nthrough the process\nwe can be as as you know Justice\noriented as we want to and I'm not\nsaying that you can't have a\nconversation with your friend\nright or that Justice isn't important\nbut ultimately like they're the ones\nthat have to do it right they're the\nones that have to go go to the police\nstation they're the ones that have to\ntalk to the police they're the ones that\nhave to get potentially interviewed and\nreinterviewed and press charges and hire\na lawyer and go to court\nthey're the ones that have to go through\nall that and some people just don't want\nto some people want to just completely\nforget about it\nand honestly like as a physician I think\nmy first\nresponsibility is like to the patient\nand if that's what they want to do okay\nthat's fine\nif forgetting about it starts to cause\nyou problems which I've absolutely seen\nbefore\nthen my door is open right that's what I\nwould say to a patient that if this is\nwhat you want to do that's totally fine\nis it okay if we check in in a month\nI just want to check in because\nsometimes people like change their minds\ncan we talk about that a month from now\nso let let the person let the Survivor\ndictate what happens because that's\nreally what the the system is designed\nfor it's not designed to Railroad\nsurvivors into all kinds of stuff\nyou know if this happened to someone\nthat I cared about my first and foremost\npoint would be go to the medical\nemergency room right get yourself\nexamined\nyou know get medication if you need for\npost-exposure prophylaxis like those\nthings are really really important get\nthat evidence collected that's what I\nwould kind of recommend you don't have\nto act on any of it but if something if\nyou're unlucky enough to be in this kind\nof situation I do think it's really\nimportant for you to get care\nquestions\nhow to support friends\nso I'd say the most important thing\nso I'd say the most important thing if\nyou want to support friends is to follow\ntheir lead\nso this is where like honestly I've seen\nsome pretty toxic friendships\nwhere one friend will impose their value\nsystem on the other friend\nlike I don't know how to say that but\nlike sometimes like honestly I work with\npeople\nyou remember a third of people have no\nreaction whatsoever I've worked with\npeople who are like yeah it sucked\nI'm going to be more careful in the\nfuture or it was like a random thing\nright and like\nI don't I don't I I feel okay\nI went home I made a sandwich I woke up\nthe next day I took my dog for a walk\nwas it a terrible experience yes\ndo I hope it never happens again yes and\nlike I want to continue living my life\nthis doesn't need to Define me and\ndoesn't need to occupy I wasted one hour\nof my life with this event and I don't\nwant to give anything about this an\nadditional hour of my life\nI've met people who think like that I've\nalso met people who don't think like\nthat are dissociating ashamed guilty\nsuicidal\nso I think the most important thing to\ndo as a friend is to ask how can I help\nyou know and I do think like orienting\nthem a little bit and sort of letting\nthem understand that\nhey\nif at any point you want to engage in a\nlegal process\nthen we do need to contact law\nenforcement sooner rather than later so\nfor example something that people want\nto do immediately after a sexual assault\nis shower because they feel dirty\nand I totally I mean I can't honestly I\ncan't empathize with that because I've\nnever been in that situation\nbut\nI I sort of understand it intellectually\nthat like you feel dirty you feel\nashamed you just want to wipe it clean\nbut if you do that\nyour legal options get vastly reduced\nso just to have people understand that\nand as a friend like ask people hey are\nyou open to like can we talk about this\na little bit I don't need to hear\ndetails about what happened\nI'm very concerned about the next 24\nhours and I would I would love it if I\ncould help you feel safe and like do\nthings that like will\nbe protective towards you\nwhat do you think about seeing a medical\nprofessional\neven explaining things like\npost-exposure prophylaxis explaining\nthings like the possibility of engaging\nin law enforcement even these kind of\ntidbits like the sane exam can be\nanonymous so you don't know how to give\nthem your name\nso if you never want to claim it you\nnever have to it's just going to sit on\nthe shelf for some amount of time then\nmaybe get thrown away who knows maybe a\ndecade later\nbut explaining some of these things will\nactually hopefully help people like get\nin the door\nand then once they get in the door I'd\nlike to think that my colleagues will be\nable to do a good job both on law\nenforcement on and on the medical side\nit's a fantastic question\nthis is a friend follow their lead and\nalso if they don't know what to do I\nthink it's fine to explain some of these\noptions to them and encourage them to\nseek medical care\nwow dude this is by far the longest\nresponses I've gotten in chat\num so it's just harder for me to read\nthem\nso lady New York Recon is saying how\ndoes\nhow does someone get comfortable being\nintimate with Partners again after\nsomething like this without feeling\nshame or discussed with themselves or\nneeding to be under the influence just\nto get those walls down again\nso really interesting question so\nthere's interesting data here okay\nthe first is that sometimes using\nsubstances after a traumatic event makes\nit worse\nso even though it'll temporarily help\nyou there is some evidence that the\nlong-term outcomes\ncan be worse if you use substances to\nlike veg yourself out\nsome evidence\non the flip side there's also evidence\nthat\nasking for detail trying to do detailed\nprocessing after a traumatic event does\nmake it worse\nokay\nthere's also some evidence that doing\nsome mild distracting activity like\nthere's actually a study on Tetris where\nthey had people who experience trauma\nplay Tetris afterward that found it it\nhad a positive effect so it keeps some\nof the negative thoughts at Bay\nso it's kind of complex especially\nsubstance use and distractions and stuff\nlike that but having people go through\nthe detail of okay like then what\nhappened and then what happened then\nwhat happened actually appears to\nre-traumatize them\nso you want like a healthy amount of\nnumbness\nnow the other thing is that for whatever\nreason we just look at it at data and it\nappears that most people who have sexual\ndifficulties after part after a sexual\nassault within a year it just kind of\ngets better\nand how and why does that work honestly\nwe don't know\nso what we do know is that the body\ntends to naturally move towards\nhomeostasis or equilibrium\nand what does that mean it's kind of\nlike okay well like if I ate a piece of\nfish and I got sick\nthe next day let's say I get like a\nstomach flu or like food poisoning I may\navoid fish for the next day the next\nweek the next month but in a in a year\nI'll like most human beings will start\neating fish again\nso we just know that that when when\nhumans are hurt by something\nthat over some amount of time the body\nnaturally heals\nand so that can absolutely be the case\nfor people who have who've experienced\nsexual assault for a couple weeks or a\ncouple months it's like hard I'm not I\ndon't feel aroused I have difficulty\nlet's say with like vaginal lubrication\nor erection or achieving orgasm I have\nthose kind of difficulties and just as\ntime goes on like it's really cool but\nour body kind of heals\nso that's very common now for some\npeople\nit lingers for months years\ndecades\nand if that's the case then\nI would strongly recommend I mean you\ndon't have to wait a decade before you\ngo see a therapist I'd say go see a\ntherapist right away\nbut we just know that sometimes things\nget better because that's like that's\nhow the human body is designed\nit's designed to just kind of like keep\ngoing\num and and you know that's where like\ntherapy with these people is really to\nunderstand why you feel ashamed where is\nthat disgust coming from\nyou know like to validate those kinds of\nfeelings that I feel gross after this\nlike which is a very common experience\nto feel disgusting\nand to say I can understand why you\nwould feel that way\nand then like you know sometimes\nespecially when it comes to like\nintimate with Partners like having a\npartner be a part of that conversation\nwhen it's the right time\nright\nand and there's there's all kinds of\nlike intimacy building that can happen\ngradually and slowly with intimate\npartners\nso when when one partner says I feel\ndisgusting and the other partner is like\nyou're not disgusting that can be\nhelpful but it can also be like okay\nlike if you feel disgusting can we just\ncan I just hold you we don't have to do\nanything I don't find you disgusting\nyou know I can understand that you feel\nthat way I'm so sorry that you've been\nthrough this but like it doesn't doesn't\nbother me I think you're great\nnot saying that you're wrong but that's\njust not how I feel\nright I I respect you love you etc etc\net cetera like like there are ways to\nhave those conversations and facilitate\nthose conversations\nand once you kind of do that in a\nhealthy and persistent way I've seen\npeople be fantastic afterward right like\nback to normal or even in some cases I\nknow it sounds kind of weird but you see\nthis a lot when it comes to medical\noutcomes sometimes people would even\nbetter\nright so I'm not suggesting that we go\nthrough that because the vast majority\nof people are not better but they just\ncome back to normal it's the most\nimportant thing\nbut what it really does is in some ways\nit tests the relationship but it also\nlike gives people an opportunity to\nreally form a very powerful bond that\nwhen a relationship gets through that\nand when one person is feeling so\ndisgusting\nand the other person accepts them\neven though they feel disgusting there's\na level of like commitment and love\nthat wasn't possible because\nI don't know if that kind of makes sense\nis like if you like the more disgusting\nI am and the more that you choose to\nlove me anyway\nthe more love I can feel in a weird way\nI don't know if that makes sense that\nmaking sense to people so I've seen that\ntoo where like relationships come out\nthe other side like really strong\nnot saying it's easier that I recommend\nit\nright so for it's not the person who's\ngiving the love it's for the person to\nrealize wow despite how bad I feel about\nmyself this person still loves me\nand that can feel like that's what\nunconditional love is\nyeah so Cinder Squire is saying I I was\nI was one that could not achieve the Big\nO with a partner in the room solo was\nfine audience participation was not it\ntook about three or so years of\nconsensual activity before I had one\nwith a partner it's been gradually\nconsistently been getting easier since\nthat sounds like honestly a very common\nexperience in their Squire and I thank\nyou so much for sharing because people\ndon't realize that\nthat like it's kind of weird but like\nwe're not gonna go into\nyou know too much of a play-by-play\nespecially given the topic today but\nlike they're they're all kinds of\nthings that you can do in a healthy\nintimate relationship even if you have\ndifficulty achieving climax with a\npartner\nright there's all kinds of\nthey're different ways to play co-op\nright you can\nright so you guys can be on the same\nteam and really be doing everything\ntogether or like one of y'all can\nbe the DPS and one of y'all can be the\nhealer and I don't even know what that\nanalogy means my point is that there are\ndifferent roles\nthat you can there are different ways\nthat you can gradually move towards fun\nand intimacy and things like that\nright\nokay\nso kitty's asking you only one can win\nin Co-op let me explain something to you\nif y'all are playing a co-op game and\nthere's only one winner you're not going\nto keep queuing up for very long with\nthat party let me tell you that\nsometimes there's just one winner and\nusually those parties fall apart over\ntime\nif you want to keep queuing for a long\nperiod of time you got to make sure\neverybody wins\nand I'm noticing that the tonal shift is\nquite drastic so\num\nsomeone asked earlier about trust so\nwith trust it just takes time to develop\nthat's all\nupsara AOE is saying yeah I've been in\nthe one winner situation that didn't\nlast it usually doesn't\nand even in the case that it does my\ncondolences\nyeah so miso corny is asking a really\ngood question which is what is sexual\nassault so I don't know what the\nofficial definition is but I think of it\nas any kind of sexual activity\nit doesn't necessarily involve genitalia\nor penises but any kind of sexual\nactivity that is not consented to\nso I think like even touching\nthat is not consensual as uh qualifies\nas sexual assault\nokay\nso miss kruthy is asking if you\nexplained EMDR\nI'm going to choose not to read too much\ninto the fact that my wife is in chat\nwe're talking about one party winners\nand she's asking me to explain a trauma\ntherapy\nwhich is her question\nso I'm not going to read too much into\nthat but\num\nI have not explained EMDR so I'll do\nthat briefly but we can talk I think\nEMDR deserves its own lecture\nso or course so EMDR is eye movement\ndesensitization\nresponse maybe I forget what the r is\num and it's it's a very cool therapy so\nit's it's an evidence-based treatment\nfor trauma that I suspect is very\nsimilar to meditation\nso in terms of the mechanism that it\nworks so we can talk about that later\nbut it's it's a good it's a good\ntreatment for trauma because I think it\nlike Alters your State of Consciousness\nto deal with the trauma in a different\nkind of way"
