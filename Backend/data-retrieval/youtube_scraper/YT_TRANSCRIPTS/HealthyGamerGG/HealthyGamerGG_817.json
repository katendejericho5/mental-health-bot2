    "transcript": "so if I get feedback that I'm not doing\nvery well in sales or that some of my\nclients are complaining about for\nexample my attention to detail or my\ntardiness and responding so if we look\nat what happens during feedback when I\nget that kind of feedback I feel bad\nabout myself right I feel kind of bad I\nstart to it can almost be like a\nconfirmation of the fears that I hold\nabout myself\nhere if you want to get control of your\nlife and understand how the mind works\ncheck out a DIY guide to mental health\nthe link is in description huh all right\nso let's talk a little bit about how to\nnot take feedback personally or even I\nknow it sounds kind of weird how to\nreject feedback so this is kind of\nimportant because sometimes like when we\nget feedback the first thing is we take\nit personally right so we think that\nthere are circumstances that are outside\nof our control which result in someone\ngiving us a piece of feedback and then\nwe sort of take that feedback to Heart\nit hurts us a lot right it makes us feel\nbad about ourselves like a good example\nis if you get broken up with or\nsomeone's breaking up with you and say\nit's not you it's me we sort of still\nkind of take that feedback personally so\non the one hand we kind of say oh don't\ntake it personally has nothing to do\nwith you so what we mean by that is that\nif there is feedback that does not have\nto relate to you specifically sometimes\nwhat we do is we make it relate directly\nto us but what I'm going to talk about\ntoday is a little bit different what I\nwant you all to do is to not take\nfeedback personally and what I mean by\nthat is almost reject feedback that is\npersonal so I'll give you all an example\nof this because this this happens way\ntoo much in in spaces like work right so\nsometimes people will get feedback like\noh you're not a team player or you're\nnot a go-getter and if you really stop\nand think about it what does that\nfeedback mean right so if someone is not\na team player like how do you fix that\nsometimes some of the worst and most\ncommon feedback that we get at work is\nvery personal they say this is an\nattribute of who you are they say you\nare not a team player but it's not like\nI can wake up tomorrow and be a team\nplayer right you can't correct feedback\nby being something else someone gives\nyou feedback that you're stupid and the\nbest place for unconstructive personal\nfeedback is in online gaming by the way\nright you suck at life uninstalled Noob\nthat's not feedback that you can do\nanything about and the tricky thing is\nit's not just in gaming right we get\nthis feedback at work all the time where\na boss who is not very thoughtful about\nwhat you're doing wrong gives you\nGeneral\nperson-based feedback you're not a team\nplayer well what do I do about that\nbecause generally speaking if you give\nsomeone personal feedback like\nperson-based feedback they can't change\nthat I can't change who I am so I'd love\nto do today is share a little bit about\nfirst of all a little bit about in\ngeneral how to deal with feedback and\nsecondly how to almost reject personal\nfeedback okay so don't take personal\nfeedback so let's talk a little bit\nabout feedback what is the ideal kind of\nfeedback so feed the the purpose of\nfeedback is to get people to improve\nright it's to give them like\nopportunities generally to improve and\nso that's one of the biggest problems\nthat people they sort of we kind of\nthink about feedback as okay this is\nwhat they're doing wrong but like what's\nthe purpose of telling someone something\nthat they're doing wrong what does that\naccomplish it doesn't accomplish\nanything unless you can also tell them\nhow to fix it so the reason that we give\nnegative feedback is to actually help\npeople improve otherwise it does no good\na simple example of this is that so if\nyou look at like a test right this is\none of the biggest problems with the\nschool system if you look at a test\nlet's say I get a c on a test and then\nwhat happens after I get a c on the test\nI never get any opportunity to improve\non that right I get the test and then we\nmove on to the next module so actually\nif we think about how we do tests our\nsystems are not designed to actually\nhave us improve our learning they're\ndesigned to rank us separate us but the\ngoal isn't actually learning the goal of\nour current educational system is\ndifferentiation and that's something\nthat has carried forward into the\nworkplace and we end up getting feedback\nthat isn't actionable so we can't\nactually improve and then what's the\npoint to giving the feedback anyway\nright so what's the point of telling\nsomeone hey I'm sorry that uh you know\nyour situation is that I'm sorry you're\nupset about your your work situation you\nhappen to be an Egyptian slave that was\nborn 2500 years ago and you need to be\nXYZ right there's no point in giving\npeople feedback unless they can actually\nimprove on it or act on it so what we\nwant feedback to be let's run through\nwhat what good feedback looks like so\nfirst of all it should be constructive\nor actionable so it's not an attribute\nof yourself or personhood it's like an\naction that you can take the second\nthing that that is ideal around feedback\nis that feedback should be sort of\nmeasurable or trackable in some way so\nif I tell you that you know I want you\nto be better at XYZ I should also let\nsomeone know how are we going to measure\nthat when are we going to measure that\nhow are we going to track progress what\ndoes progress look like this is where\nonce again if you tell someone you're\nnot enough of a team player well what do\nI do tomorrow morning how do I be more\nof a team player there aren't particular\nactions I can take how are we measuring\nit you know and so what we'll see it\nwork in Works spaces is people will be\nlike oh you're not enough of a team\nplayer you need to work on that and so\nthen the question is okay like how do I\nwork on that how do you know that I'm\nworking on it how do I know that I'm\nworking on it the right way none of\nthese questions actually get answered\nbecause we deliver this General vague\nfeedback okay so we want feedback to be\nconstructive actionable and measurable\nthe other really important thing about\nfeedback is as best as possible we want\nto remove our emotions and ego from the\nequation so if I get feedback that I'm\nnot doing very well in sales or that\nsome of my clients are complaining about\nfor example my attention to detail or my\ntardiness and responding so if we look\nat what happens during feedback when I\nget that kind of feedback I feel bad\nabout myself right I feel kind of bad I\nstart to it can almost be like a\nconfirmation of the fears that I hold\nabout myself so if I have imposter\nsyndrome for example and I get some kind\nof negative feedback what actually\nhappens in my mind is I start to panic\nright because I'm like oh my God I knew\nI felt like an imposter I knew I was an\nimposter and and now what do I do\nbecause like everything that I feared\nactually turned out to be true all my\nworst fears are correct I am an imposter\nI don't belong here and so what does\nthat do in our mind it sends our mind\ninto a tailspin we start to take it\npersonally right and what do I mean by\ntake it personally we start to form\nconclusions about ourselves based on the\nexternal feedback we receive that\nbecomes part of who I am and once it\nbecomes part of who I am it becomes\nunchangeable because now it's part of my\npersonality now it's part of my\ncharacter sheet right it's not like a\nclass skill it's a stat and it's fixed\nso this is what tends to happen when we\nget feedback so let's run through\nactually how to appropriately receive\nfeedback and to a certain degree almost\neven how to push back against it okay so\nwe're going to take a quick look at this\nso let's look at the general feedback\nsituation so sometimes what we're going\nto do is we're going to see let's say we\nreceive feedback okay and if the\nfeedback is poor it's going to be\npersonal in nature I.E not a team player\nif we're and furthermore even if it's\nnot personal we can sort of make it\npersonal so even if it's constructive\nthis will trigger our emotions so\nemotions also trigger our home car or\nego and what does that mean so remember\nthat our ego is the part of our mind and\nthat protects us from negative emotion\nso what it does is it like it starts to\nbecome egotistical we start to compare\nourselves to other people it's\nessentially a protective mechanism but\nonce again remember that once the ego\nactivates it becomes part of our\nidentity and the problem is that once it\nbecomes a part of our identity this\nbecomes unfixable because it's who okay\nright because who you are is not\nsomething you can change very easily\nit's not an action you can take so if we\nget this kind of feedback what I'd love\nto do is actually give you all sort of a\nan idea of like how to approach feedback\nthat will give you some help in avoiding\nthis whole cycle okay because once this\nalso becomes who I am what that's going\nto do is even if we get constructive\nfeedback we're going to ignore the\nconstructive feedback and we're going to\ngo straight to emotions so for example\nif I lack confidence in myself at work\nand my boss tells me that I did a bad\njob for reasons a b and c instead of\nrecognizing that those are things that I\ncan fix and then do a good job what I\nactually end up learning or the takeaway\nthat I have is oh I'm so terrible at\nthis job I'm never going to be good\nthere's so many other people who are\nbetter than me and then what I end up is\nI end up setting up a self-fulfilling\nprophecy of failure because I'm not even\nable to incorporate good feedback\nbecause my Identity or my ego takes\ncontrol of my mind so what should you do\nif you get bad feedback okay so the\nfirst thing you should do is anticipate\nyour emotions so if you have a\nperformance review coming up and you're\nafraid to talk to your boss you're\nafraid you're terrified to go in and get\nyour your feedback right oh my God what\nif they tell me I do a bad job first of\nall if you're terrified that should tell\nyou something about how you view\nfeedback so anticipate what your\nemotions are so ask yourself okay what\nwhat do I you know what do I think I'm\ngonna feel how will I feel I'll feel\nanxious why do I think I'm going to feel\nanxious and then what we want to do is\nwhen you go into the feedback you want\nto listen so let's say you get the\nfeedback and let's say that you get\npersonal feedback so they say you're not\na team player here so this is where I\nwould encourage you to push back a\nlittle bit and then instead so you don't\nhave to push back in kind of a mean way\nbut what you can sort of do is you can\nask your employer you can say Okay help\nme understand what that means so ask an\nopen-ended question then what you can do\nis ask you know what can I do to be more\nof a team player you can ask something\nlike what do team players do non-team\nplayers right so what you want to do is\ntake whatever the defining term is and\ntranslate it into actual actions okay\nand then what we want to do is you can\nkind of say okay so I want to work on\nthat so you want to sort of signal to\nyour boss that you're interested in\nchanging and then what you also want to\ndo is is sort of start the measurement\nconversation and what is the measurement\nconversation that sort of asking okay so\nwhat are some examples like how am I how\nhow do I know let's say a week from now\nwhether I'm making progress right so\nwhat does progress look like does that\nmean mean attending meetings does that\nmean asking other people if they need\nhelp or offering to help people what is\nthat you know what does that look like\nokay and you can even ask your boss\nexplicitly how will we know or how do we\nmeasure progress just ask them so\ninstead of getting oh you're not a team\nplayer you need to be more of a team\nplayer you can okay so like what what\ndoes a team player do that a non-team\nplayer doesn't do what do we you know\nwhat you could just ask questions like\nthat and how are we going to measure\nwhat actual progress looks like okay now\nso this is kind of what to do but what\nwe're also going to talk about in terms\nof feedback is what not to do or how to\navoid doing the harmful things in\nfeedback so we're going to give you all\nkind of a a couple of like cognitive\nexercises that you can go through to do\nto avoid kind of falling into the the\nTrap of like taking feedback personally\nso the first question you can ask\nyourself is what would I tell a friend\nof mine if they received this feedback\nand you're going to notice that there's\na big difference between what you you\ntell yourself and what you tell a friend\nof yours so a good example of this is\nyou can think about breakups right so if\nsomeone breaks up with a friend of yours\nand they say it's not you it's me how\nwhat would you tell your friend what do\nyou think about them and what do they\ntell themselves what would you tell\nyourself there's going to be a big\ndifference there okay next question that\nwe need to ask is how did this feedback\nmake me feel because oftentimes when we\nget feedback we just think about the\nfeedback we think about changing it we\nthink about fixing it we don't even\nthink about the impact it had on us and\nthat's huge because ultimately the\ninstrument that we are going to use to\nfix the situation is us so if we become\ncompromised in some way it'll sabotage\nour attempts to fix the feedback and\nthis is why people get stuck getting the\nsame damn feedback over and over and\nover again right people will tell you\nyou need to study harder you need to\napply yourself more and once again like\nhow do you do that what is that who the\n[ __ ] knows the bigger problem problem\nthough is you feel so bad after being\ntold oh you would succeed if you just\ntried harder the negative emotional\nimpact to you tanks your motivation and\nmakes it impossible for you to try\nharder because the whole point is your\nfeelings decrease your motivation and if\nyour motivation is down how are you\nsupposed to try harder so you have to\nunderstand how the feedback made you\nfeel now here's the next step okay this\nis how we really start to fix it and you\ncan't really do this next step until\nyou've done these others which is what\nfears about myself become truer with\nthis feedback this is the biggest thing\nthat most people miss about feedback is\nthat when we get feedback we each carry\naround some fears right I may not be\ncapable I'm an imposter no one will ever\nlove me I don't have what it takes and\nso when we get some feedback we've got\nthis fear and the fear is sitting in the\nback of our mind and it's waiting for\nevidence\nbecause you're terrified right so let's\nunderstand this from a neuroscientific\nperspective for a second if I have a\nfear that is terrifying what does the\nbrain want to do so we've evolved with\nour brains if we're afraid of a snake\nlet's say we saw a snake an hour ago\nwhat are we going to do to any stimulus\nin the environment around us that even\nremotely looks like a snake it creates a\ncognitive filter that supports and\nreinforces the fear and that's a\nsurvival mechanism right so if I saw a\nsnake in my house an hour ago and\nthere's a piece of rope on the ground or\nthere's an extension cord my mind is\ngoing to jump to the possibility that\nthat is the snake and I'm gonna freak\nout so once we hold a particular fear we\nhave this cognitive bias that we will\ninterpret information to support that\nfear and this is why even constructive\nfeedback we can sort of make it personal\nand it sabotages us instead of being a\nroad map to actually improve our lives\nso you have to be aware of what fears\nabout myself does this feedback concern\nuh confirm and literally like write it\nout right it may sound scary to like put\nit on paper but actually the whole\nreason that the fear grows so much is\nbecause we never face it we never\nacknowledge it it just lives in the back\nof our mind and continues to create\ncognitive filter after cognitive filter\nafter cognitive filter so it shapes our\nthought process without us ever\nrealizing it because it's too scary to\nadmit it's what you've got to do is ask\nyourself what feedback what what fears\nabout myself become truer with this\nfeedback and now we're gonna go to a\nevidence-based approach to sort of\nfixing this problem okay so the next\nthing that we need to ask ourselves is\nwhat factors outside of my control led\nto the feedback and what factors in my\ncontrol led to the feedback now this is\na really important step because if we\nlook at it what does our mind do\nautomatically it just looks at this it\ncompletely ignores this part so all we\never think about is what I did wrong oh\nmy God I'm such a terrible person I'm\nnot charismatic that's that's why I'm\nnot a team player you know I could like\nI and what we actually end up doing is\nif we think about let's say we made a\nmistake half of the mistake is ours to\ncontrol half of the mistake is outside\nof our control right I know it sounds\nkind of weird but how can you say that\nbecause no no it's all my fault no I\nmean just think about that for a second\nany situation especially at work is not\ngoing to be 100 in your control it's\nabsolutely ridiculous I suppose the only\nsituation that I can kind of think of is\nif you're if you're the only person who\nworks at your job you're your own boss\nand you control all of the market forces\nas well that's I suppose a situation but\nif you really think about it anything at\nwork there's something there's some work\ncontribution there's some non-work\ncontribution but the whole point is that\nour mind jumps to this so we need to\nexplicitly sort of think a little bit\nabout what are the factors outside of\nour control and so then because normally\nwhat happens is until we acknowledge\nthis we feel responsible for this whole\nthing we try to fix all of this and then\nwhat happens is this is frustrating\nbecause half of this is is impossible\nfor us to fix but we are accepting\nresponsibility for fixing it anyway and\nso this leads to inefficiency and\nfrustration okay because we're not we're\ntrying to fix things that are outside of\nour control which means that of the\nstuff that we can control we're at best\nputting forth 50 effort so once you go\nthrough this and you start to realize\nokay there's actually some stuff that is\noutside of our control so then what I'm\ngoing to do is I'm going to focus 100 on\nthis quadrant and actually on purpose\ndraw a line over here and not worry\nabout any of this stuff and so this in\nturn will make us more efficient and\nless frustrated\nso next thing that we're going to do and\nwe kind of talked about this a little\nbit already is what actions can I take\nand now we have to be a little bit\ncareful here so this is you have to\nseparate this out into two further\nquestions what actions do I wish I could\ntake and what I capable of reasonably so\nthis is huge because oftentimes when we\nthink about responding to feedback we\njust jump to everything we're like oh I\njust and we create this wish list that's\nbased on this like idealized version of\nourself if I was the person I knew I\ncould be I would wake up at 6am every\nday I'd Network in the evenings I did\nthis I did that I do this I don't know\ntake a step back take a deep breath what\nactions can you actually take what's\nreasonable for someone who has\naccomplished what you've accomplished\nover the last month what is reasonable\nto do this week right so we got to take\na step back and not let our emotions\nturn our actions into a wish list\nbecause the more ashamed that we feel\nabout ourselves the more grandiose\nactions are going to be and thus we do\nmore so elves to failure because we're\nsetting ourselves up for tasks that we\nwon't be able to accomplish okay next\nquestion you've got to ask yourself is\nhow do I track Improvement so I this is\na really important question because when\nI talk to people who are upset about\nwhere they are in life they'll say I'm\nsuch a loser and then I'll say okay so\nyou want to work on that great how are\nyou going to measure what percentage of\nprogress you're making on being a loser\nhow do you even measure that and so we\nset goals for ourselves that are\ncompletely unmeasurable and we don't\nwant to be a loser anymore I want to be\na winner okay cool I get that you want\nthat that's a wish that you have but how\ndo you actually measure it and then the\nnext thing and this is the last thing\nwhich is oftentimes also very important\nwhich people don't really acknowledge\nespecially when they're feeling ashamed\nabout themselves and they're a home cars\nactive is what is my contingency plan\nwhen things don't work okay and related\nto this who can I ask for help when\nthings don't work because a lot of times\nwhen we get feedback we don't even think\nabout enroll following anyone else we\ndon't even acknowledge for a moment I\nknow it sounds kind of weird but whose\nresponsibility is it that you learn to\ndo a good job at work and so we all may\nsay oh it's my responsibility but the\ntruth is that it's not just your\nresponsibility it's also your boss's\nresponsibility right they're the ones\nthat are responsible for you\nand yet we have this this culture\nnowadays where bosses don't accept\nresponsibility of like the work product\nof people beneath them and so it's kind\nof foreign like it like it's actually\ntheir partially their job I contribute\nsomething and they contribute something\nand when we receive feedback and we take\nit personally the thought of asking for\nhelp never even crosses our mind so\nlet's say I set a target for myself one\nweek from now then and there before I\neven get to that week I should develop a\ncontingency plan okay who am I going to\nask for help do I need to go see a\ntherapist because I'm depressed do I\nneed to get evaluated for a vitamin B\ndeficiency do I need to spend some time\nwith my friends spend some time with\nfamily am I going to sign up for a\ncourse am I going to learn how to\nmeditate am I going to start exercising\ncan I ask co-workers for help can I ask\nmy boss for help and start to set your\ncontingency plan in place and so I know\nit sounds kind of weird but what we\nactually want to do is like not take\nfeedback personally and if you're given\npersonal feedback even reject it because\npersonal feedback is not actionable is\nnot measurable is Holy within\ntheoretically your control even though\nthere's nothing you can really do about\nit right if someone tells you yeah\nyou're just not a good fit or you're not\na team player like what do you do about\nthat there's nothing you can do about it\nand so as we sort of wallow in the shame\nof receiving personal feedback as we\naccept that for personal feedback\nwithout approaching it critically it\nworsens our sense of identity about\nourselves creates more of a cognitive\nfilter becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy right because we're not\nactually making changes we're just\nterrified that oh my God like I'm gonna\nscrew up I'm gonna screw up I'm gonna\nscrew up and then sort of creates this\nlike reinforcing cycle so oddly enough\nwhat I'd encourage you all to do is\nreject feedback that is personal in\nnature because you can't do anything\nabout that and you don't have to reject\nit in a harsh way right screw you I\ndon't accept that but you can start to\nask questions okay what can I do about\nthis what actions would you recommend\nthat I take how are we going to measure\nprogress and even to start thinking a\nlittle bit about what amount of this\nfeedback is outside of my control what\namount of this feedback is in my control\nwhat actions can I take and as you start\nfocusing on an action-oriented approach\nand there's research that shows that\nthis is effective it actually changes\nyour attitude attitude and mindset in\nthe work related space instead of\nwallowing in shame and frustration\nbecause you're such a loser you start to\nactually make progress right and then\nyou start to feel a little bit better\nabout yourselves because actually your\nthoughts are focused on doing better and\nthen once you set up a measurement\nscheme for yourself and you actually\nstart to hit those targets that's going\nto actually boost self-esteem and then\nyou'll realize something that I know is\nreally bizarre but once we remove ego\nfrom the equation feedback is one of the\nbest things that we can get because\nfeedback is the way for us to get better\nat life get better at our job and who\ndoesn't want to be better we all want to\nbe better feedback actually moves us to\none step closer to perfection towards\nthe ideal version of yourself people are\nliterally telling you what you're doing\nwrong so that you can fix it and once\nyou fix it your life will be better you\nwill be better your performance will be\nbetter but why do do we why are we so\ndamn afraid of feedback because of the\nego so as long as ego is a part of it it\ncompletely shifts the direction and\nimpact of feedback and as we stop taking\nit personally as we stop accepting\npersonal feedback and we start focusing\non actions just about everything will\nstart to get better"
