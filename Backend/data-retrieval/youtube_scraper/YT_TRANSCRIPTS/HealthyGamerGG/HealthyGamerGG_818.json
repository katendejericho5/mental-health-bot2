    "transcript": "the people who are deciding they don't\nseem to be operating in this really\ninefficient way like they seem to\nactually kind of like be relatively\nhappy they kind of make a decision they\nsort of stick with it how does that work\nwhat's going on there hello\nfacade here if you want to get control\nof your life and understand how the mind\nworks check out a DIY guide to mental\nhealth the link is in description huh\ndoes Dr K have any videos on\nindecisiveness the answer is yes I have\na lot of videos and we're gonna keep\nmaking videos until you all become\ndecisive So today we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about indecisiveness and\nlet's understand like why is\nindecisiveness like such a problem right\nbecause we know that there are kind of\ntwo kinds of people in life they're the\nindecisive people like myself who have a\ncouple of options I can do a or I can do\nB and I don't know there's like a has\nthese pros and these cons and B has\nthese pros and these cons and like I\ndon't know how to make a decision I\ndon't make a decision and then as we're\nindecisive we procrastinate as we\nprocrastinate the decision sort of\nbecomes harder and then we're forced to\nchoose we always end up choosing anyway\nbut in that window of time in which we\nwere indecisive something is lost we're\nnot quite sure what is lost but it\ndefinitely feels like something is lost\nright and on the flip side we've got the\ndecisive people these are the people who\nare like they just like make a decision\nright they're like oh like they're not\nstruggling with indecision like they're\nconfident they're decisive they just\nmake decisions they just go for it\nthey're just living life because that's\nwhat it is right a decisive person is\nout there actually living life and an\nindecisive person is sitting back there\nnot living life we're trying to live\nlife but we just can't figure out which\nway to live it and so it's really\nchallenging because we're trying to\nfigure out okay how can I become this\ndecisive person like how can I search\nthis like living life instead of like\nstressing out about like what's the\nright decision and what's the wrong\ndecision because let's be clear what\nindecisiveness is about is if you really\nthink about it it's like how do I make\nthe right decision and how do I like\nwhat if it's the wrong decision right\nlike what if I choose something but it's\nbecause that's why we can't choose like\nwhy can't we pick because if fundamental\nif you think about it you're afraid of\nmaking the wrong decision because if you\nweren't afraid of making the wrong\ndecision there's no there's no\nindecisiveness and so indecisiveness is\nreally tricky because usually the way\nthat we approach it is we try to like\nlogic ourselves to the right decision\nright so what I'll do is I'll do\nsomething like I'll make a pro and con\nlist and if you really think about why\ndo we make pro and con lists we try to\nmake Pro con lists because at the end of\nthe list we hope that a decision will\nemerge right if I make a list of things\npros and cons of choice a pros and cons\nof choice B My Hope\nis that at the end I can look at those\ntwo things I can see five Pros over here\nand one con over here and two Pros over\nhere and five cons over here and then\nthe decision gets made for me so the\nreally tricky thing is that a lot of the\ntimes we think we're trying to become\nmore decisive but we're not actually\nbecoming more decisive we're actually\nhoping to do is work our way towards not\nneeding to make a decision we're working\nour way towards the decision being made\nfor us because if we make a pro and con\nlist if we talk to enough people if we\ndo enough research then we will find the\nright answer and then I won't have to\nmake a decision because the decision\nwill sort of be made for me does that\nkind of make sense that a lot of the\nways that we deal with indecisiveness is\nthat we like try to like bypass the\nproblem we don't want to commit to\nmaking a decision and making it a wrong\ndecision we're trying to trick ourselves\ninto not making a decision at all and so\nit's kind of strange right but now we\ncan sort of see why indecisiveness\npersists because we're never actually\ntackling the indecisiveness what we're\ndoing is trying to set up a situation\nwhere we never have to make a decision\nto begin with because it's so clearly\nthe right decision that we don't have to\novercome whatever that thing is and so\nnow if we really want to understand okay\nhow do I become more decisive let's\nstart by understanding okay what is it\nthat thing that we're actually trying to\navoid what is it that makes it hard to\nmake a decision so I want to give you\nall a very simple exercise the next time\nthat you're indecisive about something\nyou've got two options just grab a coin\nand flip the coin and if it's heads\nyou're going to choose option A and if\nit's Tails you're going to choose option\nb easy right if you're indecisive just\nflip a coin and let the coin decide now\nif you are even thinking about that and\nif you actually do it what you'll notice\nis actually something really really cool\nwhich is that the thought of flipping a\ncoin is terrifying actually flipping the\ncoin you're not even going to listen to\nwhat the coin says do you guys see that\nas you think about flipping the coin or\nas you actually flip a coin what you'll\nnotice is like this like feeling that\nstarts in your gut and kind of comes\ninto your throat makes you kind of want\nto vomit no you don't want to do it that\nway which is interesting right like if\nyou really stop and think about it for a\nsecond you flip a coin it's not what you\nwanted to flip again wait hold on a\nsecond but then do you want it since you\ndidn't like the first one or you can go\nwith the second one like you know it's\nlike there's something weird going on\ninside you and so anytime you look at\nindecisiveness what you're actually\ngoing to find is what's at the root of\nit is actually a fear of regret because\nwhat makes a decision hard to make well\nwhat if it's the wrong decision right I\nhave to make the right decision and I\ncan't make the wrong decision because if\nI make the wrong decision then like it's\nthe wrong decision and then I'm gonna\nsuffer and I'm gonna regret and I'm\ngonna miss out so if we really look at\nwhat indecisiveness is about it's not\nabout indecisiveness or decisiveness\nit's about an inability to deal with\nregret from your decisions so what\nyou're actually trying to do when you're\nstruggling with indecisiveness is live a\nperfect life you're trying to live a\nlife that's free of any regrets because\nhere's your thinking if I make all the\nright decisions then I'll make the right\ndecisions and then I won't have anything\nto regret and then I'll be happy and my\nhappiness depends on the decision that I\nmake that kind of make sense so then\nwhat we can sort of conclude is that\nwhat we're thinking about with\nindecisiveness is I'm looking for the\nright decision and the more indecisive I\nam the more I want to be sure that I'm\nmaking the right decision because if I'm\nmaking the right decision then I will be\nhappy and I won't miss out so if we kind\nof think about that for a second like\nokay what about people who are decisive\nif it follows that indecisive people are\ntrying to make the right decision and we\nstruggle and we're like oh my God right\nwe're thinking about it we're weighing\npros and cons we're doing all this work\nto end up with the right decision and if\nthere are people out there that are just\nmaking decisions right like they're\npeople who go into restaurants that are\njust like ordering food and they're like\nwhat do you want and then they just\nshrug their shoulders and they're like\nyou know what what's your favorite I'll\nget that there are people out there\nliving life like that right but what if\nit's the wrong thing what if they don't\nlike it and so we would assume that okay\nso if the more time I spend making the\ndecision away pros and cons list that I\nweigh my pros and cons I do a bunch of\nresearch that should lead to the right\ndecision what should actually follow is\nthat people who are decisive are\nactually making wrong decisions right\nbecause people are just like they're not\nreally thinking about it they're not\ndoing the research into flipping a coin\nthey're just going out there living\ntheir life they're like yeah I'm gonna\norder this you know we should follow\nthat people who are more decisive are\nmaking wrong decisions like their\ndecisions are flawed and so then we kind\nof think about it and we're like we\ndon't want to make a wrong decision\nright that's why we're doing this and\nlet's think through that for a second so\nwhy don't we want to make a wrong\ndecision well if I don't want to make a\nwrong decision what happens if I make\nthe wrong one what do I do then well\ndecisions aren't forever right we kind\nof know that so if decisions aren't\nforever then what I can do if I I've\nordered the wrong thing then I can order\nsomething else or next time I'll get\nsomething else and let's say you pick\nsomething as a major you're trying to\ndecide what to major and you decide you\ndon't like it then you have to switch\nover to the other one and so what's the\nproblem with that well it leads to\ninefficiency because the people who are\nindecisive like we don't want to weigh\nwaste time right if I had made the right\ndecision in the first place I wouldn't\nhave wasted a year studying the wrong\nthing and so we want to really avoid\ninefficiency right like because like I\ndon't want to waste time okay so that\nsort of makes sense so then it follows\nthat if I'm indecisive and I end up sort\nof picking the right thing then I'll be\nvery efficient that's the goal of of you\nknow making the right decision right so\nwe don't have to like clean up our mess\nwe don't have to change our course we\ndon't have to waste any time Senate\nshould also follow that people who are\ndecisive are wasting more time they're\nmore inefficient right it kind of makes\nsense like if if the whole point of\nindecisiveness is to make sure we make\nthe right choice and make sure that it's\nefficient then the people who are\ndecisive should be making wrong choices\nall the time they should be course\ncorrecting all the time they should be\nliving really inefficient lives that are\nfilled with mistakes and regret but is\nthat actually how they live do you feel\nlike people who are decisive or screwing\nup left right and Center do you feel\nlike they're incredibly inefficient they\nstart one thing and then they do\nsomething else like how does it feel\nwell no it actually doesn't this is\nwhat's kind of weird right it's like\nwait a minute hold on the people who are\ndeciding they don't seem to be operating\nin this really inefficient way like they\nseem to actually kind of like be\nrelatively happy they kind of make a\ndecision they sort of stick with it how\ndoes that work what's going on there\nbecause these people who are you know\ndecisive they're sort of less afraid of\nregret right they're all kind of okay\nmaking a mistake but then why aren't\nthey making mistakes all the time and so\nthat's where like we really have to\nTunnel down and understand this as we\nlook at people who are more decisive we\nbegin to see that their lives actually\nseem to be having less mistakes right\nthey don't seem to be like course\ncorrecting quite as much or they don't\nseem to be like filled with regret and\nlike let's try to understand a little\nbit about what's going on there right so\nhow is that if they're just sort of\nrandomly choosing or maybe it's not\nrandomly choosing but if they're\nchoosing without doing all this research\nthen how is it that they're not making\nmistakes and I think something\nfundamental has happened and our society\nis getting way worse in this way and\nfundamentally what's happened is we've\nstarted to assume that the rightness of\nthe or the wrongness of a particular\ncourse of action comes from the decision\nwe've started to kind of surrender\ncontrol of our ability to shape the\noutcome we've started to think that the\nrightness or wrongness comes from the\ndecision as opposed to what we do with\nthe decision and a great example of this\nis online dating right so if you look at\nlike online dating what we're sort of\neveryone is trying to make the right\ndecision it's kind of like we're kind of\nlooking at people and we're trying to\nfind the right person because if I can\ncheck all the boxes then my relationship\nwill be good we're trying to do make all\nthat decision making up front we're\ntrying to find the perfect person\nbecause it's the perfect person that\nleads to the perfect relationship right\nI need to find the one but actually if\nyou look at people and this is what's\nsort of interesting about growing up\nbeing Indian is I you know I come from a\nculture where arranged marriages happen\nand the thing about arranged marriages\nis you don't get to pick the perfect\nperson like you don't you sort of try\nyour family sort of tries but there's\nthis attitude of like making the\ndecision work right and this is what\nwe've actually really this is the\ndifference between an indecisive person\nand a decisive person is that the\nindecisive person tries to pick the\nright choice and the decisive person\nmakes whatever choice they pick work\nit's this idea that whatever you choose\nyou can kind of make it work it's what\nyou do after the decision that's really\nimportant and this is precisely why they\ndon't end up sort of in bad places right\nbecause when a decisive person makes a\ndecision it doesn't look like a mistake\nand why doesn't it look like a mistake\nbecause it's not because they made the\nright choice it's because what they did\nafter the choice that decisiveness\nactually affects the outcome the outcome\nis not dictated by the choice it's\ndictated by what you do after you make\nthe choice so great example of this one\nof my favorite Dota 2 players this\nprofessional Dota 2 player is this guy\nnamed no-tail and my favorite quote from\nno tale is he kind of says that\nsometimes your team is doing stuff\nthat's stupid like half of your team is\nmaking a stupid play and sometimes the\nonly choice that you've got when your\nteam is making a stupid play is to\nactually make it with them that decisive\nstupid plays Will outperform indecisive\ngood plays which is really fascinating\nright because if you really like look at\nthat and this is a two-time TI Champion\nby the way so there's something maybe is\non to something here I think the key\nthing though is that if we look at\npeople who are decisive they find a way\nto make it work and instead of trying to\nmake the right decision the outcome of\nthe decision depends on what you do\nafterward and now let's kind of take a\nlook at the flip side let's look at\nsomeone who makes an in who's very\nindecisive so if I'm indecisive and I'm\ntrying to find the right decision what\nhappens in my psychology okay do I go\nwith a or do I go with B do I date this\nperson do I marry this person or do I\nmarry this person which one do I do and\nif I'm indecisive about it right\nprocrastinate I wait till the last\nminute and I pick something and as I\npick that thing if I'm assuming that the\ndecision correlates with the outcome and\nI'm procrastinating and I'm indecisive\nwhat do you think is going to happen\nwhat's going to be the outcome the\noutcome is going to be bad and what is\nthe indecisive person conclude when they\npick something and the outcome is bad\nwhat they conclude and this is what's\ncrazy is I made the wrong decision they\nget PTSD from making the wrong decision\noh my God and then you regret right I\nshould have chosen the other thing if I\nhad chosen the other thing everything\nwould have been fine so now you're\ntraumatized by this the next time that\nyou make it have to make a decision what\nhappens that trauma is front and center\nI don't want to make that mistake again\nI'm afraid of that regret I made a\nmistake now you're indecisive again you\ndon't know you make a bunch of pros and\ncons you try your level best to get\nother people to convince you which one\nis right because then you don't have to\nmake the decision you don't have to be\nindecisive you want to make it a slam\ndunk right but you're still indecisive\nand you end up picking something else\nand now this time because once again\nyou're indecisive about it what ends up\nhappening you make the decision you hope\nit'll work out this time but let me ask\nyou all something if your strategy in\nlife is I hope it'll work out for me\nwhat do you think your outcomes are\ngoing to be they're gonna be crap and so\nagain you screw up the outcome is crap\nit's inefficient you have to make a\nchange and so once again you're like oh\ncrap I made the wrong decision the fear\nof regret increases minor trauma the\nnext time a decision rolls around I\ngotta make the right decision because\nI've made the wrong decision two times\nin a row and so the cycle repeats itself\nand you become more and more and more\nindecisive and it all tunnels down to\nfirst of all what is it that makes it\nhard to make a decision\nthe fear of regret the fear of making a\nmistake secondly it's the indecision\nitself that correlates with the poor\noutcome it's the idea that I can make\nthe choice and if I make the right\nchoice I can mentally check out Bros I\nfound the perfect person I found the\nperfect person on the planet which means\nthat my relationship will be successful\nbecause I found the one right it's about\npicking the right thing it's not about\nhow you play out the relationship and so\nif you're really struggling with\nindecision couple of things you need to\nunderstand the first is that it's the\nfear of regret that's actually that\nresistance you're afraid of making a\nmistake second thing you've got to\nunderstand is that mistakes are\ncompletely normal there's no way to\navoid making mistakes and you're like I\ndon't know which one is right for me\nthere's no right for you or wrong for\nyou like any time you go to a restaurant\nI'll tell you how I struggle with this\nkind of bizarre but I really like tacos\nand I struggle there's a huge the\ngigantic problem I struggle with every\nsingle day every time I want to eat a\ntaco do I go to the place where I know I\nlike tacos or do I try a new place\nbecause the new place could have better\ntacos but if I go to that place and the\ntacos aren't as good I could have eaten\nat my favorite taco place and thus my my\nhappiness in life has has been forever\ndiminished because I've eaten one subpar\ntaco meal when I could have had a good\ntaco meal but if I go to my favorite\ntaco place what if I'm missing out what\nif this taco place I think it's a 10 but\nit's actually only a nine and a ten\nlives out there there's a there's an\neven better and even more delicious taco\nplace that exists out in the world so\nmuch indecision instead just pick a taco\nplace if it's not enjoyable what's the\nharm you can go back to the other you're\nnever gonna go again and if you find a\nnew place and it's great it's so easy\nright so don't be afraid of inefficiency\nyou've got to make changes you're gonna\nmake pivots don't be afraid of making\nthe wrong choice because the choice the\nwrongness isn't in the choice it's in\nwhat you do after you make the choice\nyou're so terrified about inefficiency\nbut that's like it's kind of part of\nlife right so I can also be someone who\ncan sort of say like I've made a lot of\ninefficient choices in my life I.E\nfailing out of college and playing too\nmany video games and all that good stuff\nspending three years applying to medical\nschool like starting medical school at\nthe age of 28 so much inefficiency and\nhere's what I'm telling you it kind of\ndoesn't matter right and this is what's\nreally interesting about people who are\ndecisive it's people who are decisive\nthe reason that you can afford to be\ndecisive is because if you can make the\nwrong choice you have the capacity to\nPivot so if you're struggling with\nindecisiveness start by understanding\nthat it's a fear of regret second thing\nyou've got to understand is that there\nis no right choice or wrong choice\nthere's just the choice that you make\neach choice is going to have advantages\nand disadvantages it's what you do after\nyou make the choice that makes it the\noutcome a good outcome or a bad outcome\nit's even baked into our language\nbecause we'll say is this the right\nchoice or the wrong choice like the\nrightness and the wrongness precede the\nchoice do you all see that where whereas\nwhat we're really missing here is the\nrightness or wrongness doesn't come from\nthe choice it comes from what comes\nafter a little bit of inefficiency is\ntotally fine even a lot of inefficiency\nis totally fine it's just the price of\ntuition so if you want to be a little\nbit more decisive you've got to be a\nlittle bit more open to making mistakes\nand the huge irony here is as you become\nopen to making mistakes you're able to\nfully commit as you're able to fully\ncommit you actually that results in\nfewer mistakes which is why we see these\npeople who are decisive who are making\nall these decisions without sort of\nthinking about all the inefficiencies\nwithout all of this regret and somehow\nthey seem to be making the right\ndecisions because they're not making\nmistakes and their life they seem to be\nenjoying themselves they seem to be\nproductive and it's like wait how are\nthey making all these right choices and\nthat's the huge Paradox is that it's the\nway that you commit to a decision that\nultimately determines what the outcome\nis so if you're struggling with\nindecision stop trying to make the right\nchoice you can't make the right choice\nyou can just make a choice and the more\nthat you commit to that choice the more\nthat you're willing to Pivot the more\nthat you're willing to and you may say\nthat's kind of weird what about\ncommitment and pivot you commit to the\nchoice and then if you need to Pivot\nthen you're decisive about the pivot\nright it's better to commit to a choice\nand be be decisive about the choice and\ndecisive about the pivot than it is to\nbe indecisive about both of those things\nshould I stay should I quit should I\nbreak up with this person should I stay\nin this person I've been in this\nrelationship for three years I don't\nknow what to do I don't know what to do\nI don't know what to do so completely\nflip it on on its head and you'll be\namazed at what your life turns into\nbecause the last thing that I'll share\nwith you is that you don't have to live\na perfect life life is actually\ncompletely enjoyable if you don't eat\nthe tastiest tacos every single day you\ncan actually afford to eat subpar tacos\nand you'll be totally fine this is what\nI've learned after 40 years on this\nEarth so hopefully this has been a\nlittle bit helpful to you I know it's\nkind of weird but really pay attention\nto the source of your indecisiveness and\nrecognize that it's not the choice that\ndetermines the outcome\nforeign"
