    "transcript": "most of the problem in our life is that\none of these three things is present\nwe're thinking about the future we're\nthinking about the past or we're\nthinking about ourselves in some way I\nremember a time I've reached flate I was\ndoing a Moto GP it was like a training\nschool and you're on a motorcycle and\nyou go as fast as possible around a\ncourse they tape up your mirrors and all\nthis and you you know you take these\nbends really fast you're going like 100\nmiles an hour scary basically like after\nlearning how to do it like day two of\ndoing it there's like a few runs where\nI'm just doing what I'm supposed to do\nit felt great hold on a second cuz\nthat's beautiful right so you said after\na few days what was happening in your\nmind for the first couple of days\ncomparisons to how I'm doing versus how\nother people are doing that's ego fear\nof like what if I fall like can I\nactually commit to this so what if I\nfall so is your mind in the past present\nor future in that moment future 100%\nthat's like spoton right so when we\nremove those two elements of mental\nfunctioning we move closer to flow"
