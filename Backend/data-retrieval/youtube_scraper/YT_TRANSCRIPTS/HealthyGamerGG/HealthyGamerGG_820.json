I'm so awesome\nI'm gonna live so long I'm so good at\nlike playing FPS games and this ant on\nthe sidewalk that ant sucks man I'm the\nbest thing I'm better than every single\nant in the world when it comes to\nplaying OverWatch\nhappiness\nis whatever is in the link in the\ndescription check it out so today we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about\ncomparison we're talking about this\nbecause I hear a lot of people will sort\nof say that comparison is the thief of\njoy and I'm noticing that more and more\npeople nowadays are like comparing\nthemselves a lot and it almost seems\nlike an epidemic like there's something\nalmost addictive about comparison right\nlike you're kind of going throughout\nyour day and you kind of see that\nsomeone else is doing something and\nyou're like oh why can't I do that or\nyou're on the internet and you're\nbrowsing slash R I am very smart on\nReddit and you see a lot of people who\nwill compare themselves to other people\nso we see that there's a lot of\ncomparison and a lot of times the more\nthat we compare ourselves the worse we\nfeel about ourselves and then the the\nissue is that as we kind of look at like\nscience and mental health professionals\nand like wellness blogs and stuff like\nthat what people will say is that oh if\nyou want to compare yourself last like\nless spend less time on social media\nright we have all this research that\nshows us that you know spending time on\nFacebook or spending time on Instagram\nor social media or whatever like worsens\nour mood and so that our solution should\nbe just like spend less time on the\ninternet and that's actually like that\ndoesn't really work right so you can\ntell people to spend less time on the\ninternet but that doesn't it's really\nhard to do like I think that the\nchallenge right now is that if you find\nyourself making a lot of comparisons\ntelling you that the solution is to\nspend less time on the Internet is an\neffective solution but it's actually\nreally hard to implement so what I'd\nlove to do today is to talk to you a\nlittle bit about first of all why\ncomparison feels so damn addictive\nsecondly to try to understand hold on a\nsecond why do we compare in the first\nplace and once we understand why the\nbrain has evolved the capacity to\ncompare and what comparison does then\nwe'll gain some insight into it and try\nto understand a little bit about how to\ncompare less so let's start by\nunderstanding a little bit about why we\ncompare in the first place so we all\nknow that our brain has the capacity of\ncomparison in fact that plagues us right\nbecause anytime I'm kind of doing\nsomething if I'm not careful my brain\nwill make a comparison if I go to the\ngym I'll make a comparison to someone\nelse at the gym who works out more than\nI do and My Success now suddenly becomes\na failure so we know that we compare a\nlot of the time the other thing that we\nalso know is that oftentimes we will\ncompare ourselves to other people as\nwell that are below us so we compare to\npeople above us and compared to people\nbelow us and sometimes we'll we find\nourselves making comparisons like I'm so\nsmart or I'm so great or that person is\nnot nearly as good at League of Legends\nas I am or whatever we'll make different\nkinds of comparisons they're noobs and\nI'm an expert the reason that I'm stuck\nat this rank is because I'm surrounded\nby noobs but it's not like I'm bad I'm\nthe only one who actually knows how to\nplay the game properly I'm stuck in the\ntrench right it's a curse of being in\nthe trench and there's nothing I can do\nabout it so we make a lot of comparisons\nand it turns out that there's actually\nlike a really interesting Theory from\npsychology called social comparison\ntheory that actually looks into why we\nmake comparisons and social comparison\nTheory basically says we make two kinds\nof comparisons and they each serve a\ndifferent purpose the first is something\ncalled an upward comparison so this is\nwhen we sort of like look at someone\nwho's better than us in some way and we\nmake some kind of comparison now when we\nlook at Upward comparisons they actually\nhave a very very important function the\nreason we do it is because it helps us\nin some way and generally speaking when\nwe make an upward comparison the\nadvantage of that is we get an\nopportunity to think about what we could\nbe doing better to mimic that to improve\nour own lives so when we make an upward\ncomparison we say okay this person is\nmore in shape than I am maybe I need to\nstart doing a little bit more of what\nthey're doing or if I get a B plus on a\ntest or if I get an 85 and someone else\nin the class gets a 90 then I can start\nto think a little bit about well this\nperson is better at studying than I am\nwhat can I do to get a 90 next time so\none of the reasons that we make\ncomparisons is to sort of look at people\nwho are doing a little bit better than\nus so that we can learn techniques to\nimprove our own life the second reason\nwe make comparisons is something called\na downward comparison so this is when I\nthink of myself as really awesome and I\npick someone who's below me to make a\ncomparison and if you look at that\nessentially what's happening there is\nit's an emotional coping technique so\nwhen I feel bad about myself what I can\nsometimes end up doing is comparing\nmyself to someone who's beneath me and\nwhen I compare myself to someone who's\nbeneath me I feel better about myself so\ndownward comparisons are essentially an\nemotional coping strategy the problem\nwith both of these things is that\nsometimes they can kind of get out of\nhand right if you actually look at the\nway that we make comparisons that's not\nactually in effect what oftentimes\nhappens I can get stuck in this\nsituation where I find myself comparing\nmy uh comparing to other people who are\nbetter than me all the time and\nsometimes that part of our brain that\ncircuit in our brain can get hijacked\nand no longer be productive the goal of\nan upward comparison is to try to figure\nout okay what can I do differently but\nparadoxically what can happen is as I\ncompare myself to other people instead\nof sort of creating a road map for\nProgress what it can actually do is\ndestroy my motivation I can look at\nother people and I can say oh my God\nlike this person is so good at this\nstuff like there's no way I will ever be\ngood at that there's no way that I\nshould even bother I go to the gym once\nand everyone there is so ripped like\nthere's no chance and so it actually has\nthe opposite effect sometimes the other\nthing that happens with downward\ncomparisons is sometimes those can also\nget stuck in almost like a vicious cycle\nwhere the only way that I know how to\nfeel good about myself is is by making\ndownward comparisons so if I'm unhappy\nwith some aspect of my life and I make a\ndownward comparison is an emotional\ncoping strategy that can help me feel\nbetter emotionally in the moment but it\ndoesn't actually improve my situation at\nall right so what ends up happening and\nwe'll see this on the internet we'll see\npeople who are stuck at low ranks and\nconstantly [ __ ] on people around them\nand you'll kind of see this a lot where\nthese are people who are criticizing and\npretending to be better than everyone\naround them but those people actually\nstay incredibly stuck in their own life\nthey don't actually make progress so we\nknow that there's sort of two kind of\npsychologically plausible reasons why we\nmake comparisons we know that for\nexample they can be used as a road map\nfor our own progress in the case of\nupward comparisons and they can be used\nas an emotional coping strategy in the\ncase of downward comparisons the\nchallenge is that both of these\ncomparative models can actually get kind\nof out of our control and in one case\nwhat we can end up doing is making\ncomparisons that don't actually give us\na Way Forward in fact make us feel so\ninferior that they actually shatter our\nmotivation or we can get sort of stuck\nin this cycle of using consistent\ndownward comparisons I.E being arrogant\non the internet and then when we're\narrogant on the internet we don't\nactually improve our life in any way\nshape or form so this is where if we\nwant to understand how to stop comparing\nwe have to understand a little bit about\nhow these comparisons get made so a lot\nof times the the struggle is that when\nwe make a comparison what we try to\nchallenge is the comparison itself right\nwe'll sort of like I'm comparing myself\nto someone else and I try to rationalize\nthat maybe I shouldn't compare myself to\nthis person or this is an unfair\ncomparison or if we reach out to friends\nof ours they'll say oh your situation is\ndifferent it's really apples and oranges\nbut that doesn't really seem to work\nright so we know that sometimes if we\ntry to tackle these comparisons just\nsomething about it feels off something\nabout it makes it like really really\nhard to actually stop making the\ncomparison and if we really want to\nunderstand how to stop making\ncomparisons there's one other key thing\nthat we need to look at and that is the\nway our brain\ndecides who to compare to so let me put\nit to you this way do you compare\nyourself to elephants do you say oh man\nI'm so weak uh elephants are so much\nstronger than I am oh that's sag like I\nwish I was as strong as an elephant or\ndo you ever feel Superior to an ant\nright do you ever feel like oh my God\nI'm so awesome I'm gonna live so long\nI'm so good at like playing FPS games\nand this ant on the sidewalk that ant\nsucks man I'm the best thing I'm better\nthan every single ant in the world when\nit comes to playing OverWatch so\nobviously like no right we don't compare\nourselves to like elephants and ants we\ndon't compare ourselves to dinosaurs we\nalso don't compare ourselves to a lot of\nother human beings right we don't\noftentimes compare ourselves to let's\nsay heads of state like I I don't feel\ninferior to let's say the president of\nthe United States or the head of state\nof of a different country so something\nweird about how our mind decides who to\ncompare us to and if we really want to\ndismantle the comparison one of the\nthings we can really understand is that\nprocess of how our mind decides who we\ncompare ourselves to it's essentially\nwhat our brain does is kind of like puts\nus in a particular league and what it\ndoes in terms of the comparisons it\nmakes is it puts other it tries to\ncompare us to people that we perceive in\nour league so we may compare ourselves\nto school mates for example or people\nwho are in the same grade we may compare\nourselves to siblings we may compare\nourselves to friends right so these are\npeople that in some way my mind sort of\nsays me and this person belong in the\nsame bucket so it'll oftentimes\nhistorically it's been things like\nschool you know colleagues family\nmembers things like that oh my older\nbrother became a lawyer so now I need to\nbecome a lawyer my two older siblings\nboth went to Harvard so now I have to go\nto Harvard the comparisons that we tend\nto make tend to be something thing\nrelated to us now this has become a\nproblem more recently if you kind of\nlook at why is comparison growing so\nmuch and why is it so hard to deal with\nand I think a lot of this actually has\nto do with the change in the way that we\nkind of utilize social media so if you\nlook at what social media does is it\ntakes what used to be a distant figure\nright so like it takes someone like\nlet's say the president of the United\nStates and now using something like\nsocial media we begin to see intimate\nparts of their lives right we begin to\nsee like what they eat I mean I don't\nknow if the president does this but we\nget to see like you know what they're\neating for dinner or like you know what\nthey're wearing that day or in terms of\nlike friends or content creators we know\nthat there's this parasocial\nrelationship that's developing even\nfriends of yours or people that you're\nconnected to who may not even be friends\nbut people you're connected to on\nTwitter Instagram or Facebook or\nwhatever we suddenly have access to\npeople's lives in a way that we never\nhave and now that we have this increased\nlevel of access what we tend to see is\nthat people tend to make comparisons\nwith people they've never met right like\nyou'll watch someone who makes like\nYouTube videos and at the end of like\nwatching their YouTube video like a\ncontent creator you'll start to feel bad\nabout yourself you'll start to feel like\noh my God like why can't my life be like\nthis why is this person's life like this\nand I think this is really important to\nunderstand but I think somehow social\nmedia has tricked our brain into\nthinking we're sort of in the same\nleague with them this doesn't mean that\nwe're not in the same league in an\nobjective sense what I mean is that as\npeople as we start to see the inside of\npeople's lives our brain sort of like it\nchecks some of the boxes for comparison\nand then what ends up happening is once\nthese people sort of enter our league\nfor comparison then what ends up\nhappening is we start comparing\nourselves to them and then that becomes\nreally really unfair because what's\ngoing on is we're only comparing\nourselves not to their real life but we\nstart to compare ourselves to the\nversion of the life that they show us\nwhich is oftentimes very very crafted\nwhich ends up resulting in sort of this\nvery unfair comparison that ends up\nthere's only one there's only one way\nthat we can kind of handle this or\nthere's only one outcome from this which\nis that we're always going to be\ninferior and this is when we sort of see\nthat like we can kind of see that\nthere's like this upward comparison that\nour mind tries to make which is normally\nused to help us kind of\num develop a road map forward we can't\nreally do that when it comes to a\nparasocial relationship with a content\ncreator or someone who's like you know\nbig on social media because there's no\nlike real Like A to Z right in terms of\nlike becoming or achieving what some of\nthese like large internet personalities\nhave so that's that's one of the things\nthat I think has really changed and one\nof the reasons that I think comparison\nhas gotten a lot worse now in terms of\nwhat to do about it there are a couple\nof things that we we can consider the\nfirst is that anytime you make a\ncomparison start to ask yourself why did\nmy brain choose this person to make the\ncomparison to what is it about this\nperson that makes me feel like this is a\nfair comparison because we've already\nsaid it's it's not fair for you to\ncompare yourself to an elephant right\nit's not fair for you to compare\nyourself to an ant so what is it that\nmakes my brain think that this is a fair\ncomparison and as you tunnel down into\nthat you'll discover a lot of different\nthings hopefully what you'll discover is\nthat in a lot of ways this actually\nisn't a fair comparison or that the\ncomparison that you're making is not\ncomplete in some way so you may compare\nyourself to let's say a content creator\nor something like that but then like you\nhave to remember that content creators I\nmean this is their profession they have\nstaff right they have mods they have a\nlot of people to support them as you\ntunnel down into the fairness of the\ncomparison that you make in terms of the\nselection of the person what you'll\ndiscover is that hopefully there's\nsomething about that comparison that is\na little bit unfair and if you really\nthink about it we don't critically\nchoose who to make comparisons with\nright our mind automatically picks\nsomeone and how does it make that\ndetermination it's based on kind of\nsubconscious calculation so as you\ntunnel down into like okay wait why do I\nthink that this person is even a fair\ncomparison you'll discover a couple\nthings one is that you tend to not\ncompare yourself one to one with one\nperson so you don't compare all of your\nattributes with all of another person's\nattributes what you tend to do is you\ncompare the best attribute of five\ndifferent people with yourself so what\nyou're actually doing is not making a\none-to-one comparison you're comparing\nthat person's relationship to your\nrelationship this other person's\nfinancial situation to your financial\nsituation this third person's physical\nfitness to your physical fitness this\nfourth person's ability to cook with\nyour ability to cook and so as you make\nthese kind of unfair comparisons you end\nup feeling worse about yourself and you\nend up sabotaging what upward\ncomparisons are actually for which is to\ndevelop a road map to move forward the\nsecond thing to understand about\ncomparisons and if you really want to\ntackle them we're going to actually take\na step away from science for a second\nand go into yogic psychology so what I\nreally love about yogic psychology is\nthat it tends to be focused on the\nindividual so one of the basic problems\nwith science is that we can learn a\nscientific principle like we know that\nthere are upward comparisons and\ndownward comparisons but the challenge\nis that knowing the scientific principle\ndoesn't correct our Behavior\nautomatically right like I can know that\nhuman beings do this I can know that\nhuman beings use particular defense\nmechanisms I can read about cognitive\nbiases but just because I understand the\nscience of it or I study this stuff in a\nbook doesn't mean that I myself change\nwhat I like about the yogic system of\npsychology is that it's actually not\nbased on objective truth and science\nit's actually based on subjectivity so\nit's all about kind of application\nwithin you so the key principle that\nwe're going to be talking about when it\ncomes to yogic psychology is the ahamkar\nor the ego so the ego in the yogic model\nof the mind is something that makes\ncomparisons so if we think about our ego\nit's our sense of self and and we don't\nwe can't really have a sense of self\nwithout a comparison to another person\nand you may say well hold on a second\nlike how does that work like of course I\ncan have a sense of self outside of\ncomparison to other people well let's\nthink about that right so if you view\nyourself as tall or you view yourself as\nshort you can't be tall or short without\nsomeone else being short or tall if you\nview yourself as successful that has to\nbe in comparison to a failure if you\nview yourself as a failure that has to\nbe in comparison to a success so all of\nthe attributes that we think about is\nour own identity I'm a man I'm a doctor\nI'm a father I'm a son all of those\nthings have a relational component right\na doctor is one profession but it's not\nall of these other professions and if\nyou're Indian like I am or you're East\nAsian or South Asian you will have found\nthat there's a very clear comparison\nthat gets made with a value judgment\nbased on profession I don't know if you\nall kind of feel this way but a lot of\ntimes when I'm meeting people and I kind\nof ask me what I do for a living one of\nthe things I found is it's a shortcut\nfor them to bucket me right when they\nask me what I do it's it's some way to\nbucket me into like how much respect\nthey're going to give me for the rest of\nthe conversation so all of these\nattributes of the self are our identity\nare actually comparative in nature and\nthe ego or the humgar one of the key\naspects one of the things that the part\nof the Mind does is actually make\ncomparisons now how is that useful for\nus the key thing to remember is that\nsince the ahamkar or the ego is the part\nthat makes the comparison the more\nactive our ego is the more comparisons\nwe're going to make and if we go back to\nthe upward comparisons and downward\ncomparisons we'll kind of see that right\nbecause the more egotistical I am the\nmore downward comparisons I make the\nmore egotistical I am and the more\nupward or unhealthy upward comparisons I\nmake once again that's going to be a lot\nthat has to do with ego in this case\nthough it'll be low self-worth right so\nwhen we make upward comparisons that\nmake us feel bad about ourselves instead\nof using them productively that all has\nto do with my self-esteem and my sense\nof self-worth so the key thing here is\nthat the yogis actually give us a very\nvery useful way to disarm the ahamkar or\ndisable the ego and the key thing about\nthe ego is it's actually a defense\nmechanism so the reason that we make and\nthis is based on yogic psychology okay\nso this is correlated by science but you\nall will see what I mean in a second so\nthe reason we make comparisons is\nactually to protect ourselves from\nnegative emotion anytime our mind feels\nnegative emotion it actually activates\nthe ego to protect us against it and we\nsort of see this with a downward\ncomparison because if I'm feeling bad\nabout myself Research into psychology\nshows us that we make downward\ncomparisons as emotional coping\nstrategies and the yogis would say the\nsame thing so they'd say that if you\nwant to stop making comparisons what you\nactually need to do is forget about\ntrying to make the comparison what you\nneed to focus on is your internal\nemotional state and specifically your\nnegative emotions and there's a really\nreally good example of this if you look\nat people who go through a breakup one\nof the things that you'll find is that\nyou feel really really bad about\nyourself right and then some sometimes\nyou do something that's kind of weird\nwhich is that you'll go and you'll stalk\nyour ex's social media and you'll see\nall the things that your ex is doing and\nyou'll see all of the potential mates\nthat they're with all the potential\nPartners they have you'll see them out\nthere having fun and then what you'll do\nis you'll make a thousand different\ncomparisons with those people and if you\nkind of think about it like why on Earth\nare you doing this right is there\nsomething almost addictive about it\nbecause when you start doing it you feel\nworse about yourself but you can't stop\nand this actually has to do with the ego\nbecause one of the key things about the\nego is it's looking for Conformity it's\nlooking for consistency oftentimes it's\nlooking for justification so if you're\nfeeling bad about yourself one of the\nthings that your ego will actually do is\ngo out and find some kind of information\nto confirm the way that you feel about\nyourself it's almost incredibly\nvalidating if you stop and think about\nit right if I feel like a piece of crap\nand then I go look at my ex's social\nmedia and I see how they're out there\nhaving lots of fun it reinforces the\nidea that I'm a piece of crap it's\nactually incredibly validating even\nthough it's painful which is exactly why\nwe do it so if you want to stop making\nthese comparisons what you really need\nto do is focus on that negative emotion\nand try to understand okay what can I do\nto like process that negative emotion\nwhat can I do to let go of that negative\nemotion what can I do to accept that\nnegative emotion because if I let the\nemotion activate my ego then that'll\nchange my behavior and cause me to make\na lot of comparisons so at the end of\nthe day comparisons are something that\nis are oftentimes uncontrollable we tend\nto find that we make them kind of very\nvery addictively we tend to find that\nwhen we make comparisons it tends to Rob\nus of a lot of Joy right so like even\nwhen I make make a success when I do\nsomething well a comparison can turn a\nsuccess into a failure by comparing it\nto someone else so if I get an A minus\non a test and someone else gets an A\nplus suddenly my achievement becomes a\nfailure which is really bizarre and it\nturns out that people seem to be making\nmore and more comparisons and I think a\nbig reason for that is social media as\nwe use a lot of social media it sort of\nactivates the part of our brains that\nallow our brains to make comparisons\nwith these people it tricks our brain\ninto thinking hey this is a fair\ncomparison for me to make and as we\nstart making these comparisons what we\ntend to find is that they don't actually\ndo what they're originally supposed to\ndo upward comparisons were designed to\ngive us a road map to improve our lives\ndownward comparisons were actually\ndesigned to help us develop an emotional\ncoping strategy that helps us in the\nshort term but as these comparisons get\nout of control we tend to find that\nrather than giving us spurring us\nforward upward comparisons actually\ndecrease our motivation and make us feel\nstuck and downward comparisons can\nbecome sort of a vicious cycle of making\ncomparing myself and feeling Superior to\nlots of noobs on the internet but not\nactually changing my life if we want to\ndisarm this we have to understand a\nlittle bit about why our mind thinks\nthat this is an appropriate comparison\nand as we tunnel down as we're critical\nof why our mind chooses this person\nsomething cool will happen will actually\nstop to make the we'll stop making the\ncomparison so as we kind of dismantle\nthe justification that I deserve to be\ncompared to this person that we're in\nthe same league I'm not saying that\nyou're better or worse I'm just saying\nthat at the end of the day comparison\nreally isn't appropriate almost really\never and so as we sort of Target why do\nI think this is an appropriate\ncomparison it'll actually decrease the\ncomparison the second thing to remember\nis that comparison is a function of the\nahamkar or the ego and that the humgar\nand ego essentially activate when we\nexperience negative emotion so if we\nactually Target the negative emotion\nthat's fueling the comparison that'll\nactually cause the the comparison itself\nto lose steam because if you kind of\nthink about it when you're happy and\ncontent and chilling you're not really\nmaking any comparisons at all right if\nyou really stop and think about it what\nyou'll find is you make more comparisons\nwhen you yourself are feeling upset so\nhopefully that's been a little bit\nhelpful I know that comparisons feel\nincredibly addictive nowadays I think\npart of the reason that they're kind of\ngetting out of control is because we\ndon't really understand where they come\nfrom what they're designed to do and\nspecifically how they work and if you\ncan understand those things hopefully\nyou can start to overcome them"
