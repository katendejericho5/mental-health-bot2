    "transcript": "you can't like go back to the playground\nas an adult and try to make friends with\nseven-year-olds you can't start like\ngoing to places where young people are\nthat you're way older than them and\nstart to learn those basic skills there\nare many people that will tell you this\nis secret to happiness that is sacred to\nhappiness but if you want to know how to\nlive the life you must understand how\nyour mind works only so check out Dr K\nguide link is in description huh I\nmissed out on normalcy and it sucks I've\nmissed out on every normal thing a\nperson learns or goes through and it\nsucks I've missed out on socializing\nduring my teenage years due to being\nhomeschooled which left me socially\ninept when I moved on to college I don't\nhave any cool or funny stories from then\nand based on the way things are now I\ndon't think there will be any cool or\nfunny story to tell when I'm old hell I\nlearned how to ride a bicycle just this\nyear there's only bad experiences for me\nto share like getting cheated on having\nto let go of a girl I loved and even\nthough I went through all this I'm still\na virgin I look around and I have no\nclue how people are the way they are in\nthat they can actually be happy and have\nfun despite the things they go through I\nmean everyone around me are in\nrelationships and it's getting\nsome of them are getting set to get\nmarried and it feels like I'm just being\nleft behind like I missed a really\nimportant train they all have some fun\nstory or experience to share while I\nreally don't there's really no point in\nme being I don't bring anything to the\ntable and my friends are all busy doing\ntheir thing I still have no clue what I\nwant to do and it all feels very\npointless to me right now I seriously\nfeel very hopeless and lonely even\nexisting is depressing I miss the train\nto normalcy and it sucks and I feel like\na friggin loser thanks for reading me\nventing so you know my heart goes out to\nthis person I think I was this person at\none point in my life I think um many of\nus have kind of struggled to be this\nperson and the hardest thing is that we\nsort of know that in life we've got\nthere's like a normal way to live it\nright you sort of board this train and\nif you board the train early enough it\nsort of sets you up for the next step so\nif I had friends in high school in let's\nsay when I was growing up now I know how\nto form relationships if I know how to\nform relationships I can go into High\nSchool I've got some social skills and\nnow that I'm in high school and if I've\ngot social skills and I make friends\nthen we'll I'll start interacting with\npeople of the opposite sex or people\nthat I'm attracted to and then I'll sort\nof like learn how to socialize with them\na little bit and maybe if I don't even\nhave a girlfriend or that doesn't really\nwork out very well I get some experience\nor a boyfriend and then now when I go\ninto University or college or I move on\nBeyond High School like I've leveled up\nenough right to where I can do the next\nphase and if I do well enough in college\nthen I've kind of set myself up to\nsucceed in my job and even if each level\nis a little bit of a struggle boarding\nthe train to normalcy means that I've\ngot a fighting shot at the next level\nsure High School is a little bit\ndifferent occult college is even a\nlittle bit more difficult maybe entering\nthe professional world is a little bit\ndifficult but I've been leveling up the\nway that I'm supposed to and sometimes\nwhat happens is we miss the train and\nonce we miss the train then Things\nbecome really really challenging because\nlike even if you try to go back and make\nup for it the world doesn't sort of see\nyou the world doesn't kind of like\nforgive that right you can't like go\nback to the playground as an adult and\ntry to make friends with seven-year-olds\nyou can't start like going to places\nwhere young people are that you're away\nolder than them and start to learn those\nbasic skills right it's not like life is\nsort of made for you to catch up and\neven if you try to catch up what\nactually ends up happening is I I'm sure\nyou can imagine this if I'm a 20 year\nold and I go hang out at a playground\nwith eight-year-olds everyone's gonna\nthink I'm a creep and it's that's not\nthe only situation in which we're\nconsidered creeps right so if I am\nawkward and socially anxious and I try\nto go talk to someone they're gonna\nthink I'm a creep and so this can be\nalmost a paralyzing situation in fact if\nyou really pay attention to what this\nperson is kind of thinking and maybe\nyou're thinking this too I've missed the\nboat and once you've missed the boat\nthere's no boarding it right like that's\nthe whole idea behind a boat that's why\nwe use that analogy because everyone\nwho's ready to gets on board and then\nThe Boat Leaves and you're you're left\nbehind you can't catch up if you jump\ninto the water and you start swimming\nyou're never gonna catch up that's the\nwhole idea right because this is the way\nthat life is is we do one thing and then\nwe do the next thing and then we do the\nnext thing and this is growth and this\nis development and this is healthy but\nwhat if we missed it we start to feel a\nlittle bit hopeless and if we really\nwant to understand how to do this we\nhave to realize that there's actually\nsomething really really really important\nthat is a critical skill that we need to\nlearn it's probably the most\nunderappreciated skill out there and\nbecause we don't even sort of think\nabout it as a positive in fact if you\nwere to learn this skill most people\nwould think that this is absolutely\nidiotic to be able to learn how to do\nthis but it's the one crew crucial thing\nthat you have to learn if you want to\nget out of the situation and so let's\nstart by understanding a little bit\nabout what is the situation okay so my\nmind has concluded that I've missed the\nboat right so if I miss the boat then\nthere's no catching up all of the you\nknow all of the the steps that I need to\ntake I've that you know the boat has\nleft so there's like no like way to go\nback in time and fix it although maybe\nif you're like me you wish you could go\nback in time and fix it you dream of\ntime travel and if you could live your\nlife again you would do everything right\nor not even everything right right you\nwould you would make you wouldn't make\nthat one crucial mistake that got you\noff on the wrong path and if you could\nhave just boarded the train at the right\ntime then all of the other things would\nhave gone well so let's understand a\nlittle bit about why your mind thinks\nthat your situation is hopeless so as\nyou look around at all the normal people\nyour mind is a pattern generating\nmachine it's deductive it's analytical\nand by the way I see this problem more\nin people who have high IQ so they're\nable to do analysis right so you analyze\nall these other of people and you kind\nof conclude okay these are the steps\nthat take that it is required to become\nsuccessful I have all these friends\nthey're all getting married the reason\nthey're getting married married is\nbecause they started dating they started\ndating because they learned how to\nsocialize and your mind kind of\nEngineers the formula for success and\nit's a very very good formula for\nSuccess right there's a lot of data to\nsupport that formula for success and\nthen we kind of look at this and we\nconclude okay this is the right way to\nsucceed we have overwhelming data this\nis the right way to succeed and then you\nlook at your own situation and what is\nthe natural conclusion that you come to\nwell if this is the formula for success\nand it requires boarding the boat at a\nparticular time and kind of getting off\non that trajectory and I've missed that\ntrajectory therefore I'm hopeless right\nand it's completely logical and you may\ntalk to other people and other people\nmay sort of say oh no it's it's not that\nbig of a deal you you'll still be fine\nlike you can do it you can do anything\nthat you put your mind to but you don't\nbelieve that right they can say that but\nit doesn't sink in with you well why not\nand this is where you can say oh it's\nbecause I I have low self-esteem or\nsomething like that no let's be like\nmore precise the reason that you don't\nbelieve them or because or the reason\nthat their answers don't work for you is\nnot because of some psychological low\nself-esteem although that's true in a\nsense it's because you've tried it that\nway right so if we listen to this\nperson's experience they sort of dated\nsomeone they were cheated on right that\nperson left them they're still a virgin\nso the other thing that we oftentimes\nforget about people who miss the boat on\nnormalcy is they tried to live a normal\nlife at one point or many points and\nanytime they tried to live a normal life\nthey got screwed right things did not go\nwork out in their favor I tried\nrelationships I couldn't even get\nsomeone to stay faithful I tried doing\nwhat other people do and I failed at\nthat crap and it's because you failed at\nthat crap that you sort of got off on\nthis wrong trajectory so what does the\nMind naturally conclude then if people\nsay oh just go out and try to meet\npeople right like you got to try to meet\npeople meet people but once again what\nis your mind saying your mind is saying\nhey we've tried this before we've done\nour analysis we've sort of recognized\nthat this does not work well from us\nright because that's what the Mind does\nthe Mind learns from experience so here\nwe have our experience which is filled\nwith difficulty and failure which is not\nlike you know like it's not it's not\nwrong right that may not be a cognitive\nbias like those are actually your\nexperiences if you dated someone they\ncheated on you and then like you know\nyou were devastated afterward like\nthat's actually like your reality and\nthen your mind does analysis of other\npeople and it concludes okay these\npeople have lived normal lives and then\nwhat your mind does is it sits down with\nall this data and it comes to a\nconclusion there's no hope in trying\nright there's no point in trying that's\nwhy we're hopeless because we've\nconcluded that okay not only is the\nworld a painful place for us when we've\ntried to engage in it but furthermore\nnow that we've missed the boat on some\nof these things our stats are so low\nwe're so low level we're so far behind\nthat further attempts to engage will\nresult in failure and so our mind adopts\nhopelessness as a energy saving strategy\nbecause if we're hopeless we won't try\nif we don't try and failure is\ninevitable we're going to end up saving\nsome energy maybe we can salvage what we\ncan out of life and we'll certainly save\nourselves from a lot of hurt so\nhopelessness here is not something to be\nit's not a problem to be solved it is\nthe solution itself and so then the\nquestion kind of becomes okay well if\nI'm in this situation what can I do to\nchange it and this is where to be honest\nthis is the most underappreciated skill\nand in fact most people wouldn't even\nconsider it a skill in fact we sort of\nthink about we strive for the opposite\nwhich is we need to learn how to be\nstupid so our entire life we want to be\nintelligent right we want to figure out\nthe the most important things we want to\nbe problem solvers we want to be right\nwe trust our intelligence we try to\nboost our IQ we take supplements we read\nbooks all to be smarter smarter smarter\nsmarter smarter and what we really need\nto do in this situation is to be dumb to\nbe absolutely idiotic and you may say\nwell hold on a second what do you mean\nby be stupid why would I want to be\nstupid because let's remember that all\nof the conclusions that your mind comes\nto because it are because of its\nBrilliance right because you've analyzed\nall the lives of other people and here's\nthe logical conclusion you come to\nyou've analyzed all of the experiences\nthat you've had and here's the logical\nconclusion you come to and if someone\ntries to tell you otherwise you have a\nthousand reasons why they're wrong oh\nsure you have this advice for me but it\ndoesn't apply because of reasons a b and\nc it won't work for me because of a b\nand c and you're right right so people\nlike they take it for granted they're\nlike oh just go out there man like put\nyourself out there and it's fine if you\ncan put yourself out there if you're a\nsix foot three Chad or you're a\nbeautiful you know mixed race woman that\nmen are drooling over but what if you're\nnot one of those people right what if\nyou're one of the the rejects then none\nof that stuff works and so your mind\ncomes to conclusions and the mind is so\nintelligent and it's so intelligent\nright so any kind of logic that you use\nany kind of analysis that you use even\nsome amount of therapy or something like\nthat doesn't work so how do you get out\nof the situation you become stupid\nbecome utterly idiotic because if you\nreally think about it anytime you try to\ntake a step forward out of your\nsituation what does your mind do it\ntells you no don't do that and it gives\nyou a thousand Reasons look at how\nintelligent I am the full power of your\nIQ is being leveraged to keep you in\nplace so the only antidote is to be\nstupid because anytime you try to take a\nstep forward your mind will give you a\nthousand Reasons here's all the data\nhere's all the evidence here are all the\nreasons it won't work for you it won't\nwork for you it won't work for you and\nso our whole lives we go trying to trust\nour mind trying to boost our mind trying\nto improve our IQ trying to learn lots\nof things and by the way it's also we\nhaven't mentioned it yet but I'd say\nthat if you're in this kind of situation\nI'm sure you've done lots and lots and\nlots of reading and exploration to try\nto figure out a solution right how do I\nthread the needle of all of my problems\nin life so I can use my intellect to\nfind a way forward and the more that you\nuse your intellect the more that you use\nyour intellect you have one option\nyou're like oh my God this is it I found\nthe Magic Bullet and you do it and what\nhappens it doesn't work and now that\nyou've had one more failure you add that\nonto the pile that makes you more\nhopeless now you have to thread an even\nfiner needle you have to walk an even\nmore dangerous tightrope because now\nyou've got one more failure weighing you\ndown and I know it sounds kind of\nbizarre but there's actually very good\nevidence of this scientifically as well\nso when I work with my patients who are\npsychotic or who have anxiety disorders\nthe key feature that I teach them is to\nlearn how to distrust your mind learn\nhow to be stupid if you have all this\ndata that shows that the FBI is\nfollowing you I was walking down the\nstreet and there was someone in a car\nand the second that I walked by they\nturned on the car and they drove away I\nwas driving down the highway and I\nexited off the highway and there was one\ncar that followed me and then I turned\nright into a gas station and that car\nturned right into the gas station too\nsee I have all of this data so what you\nneed to learn how to do is distrust your\nmind your your anxious mind tells you oh\nmy God this is going to go wrong in this\nthis is going to go wrong and this is\ngoing to go wrong and this is going to\ngo wrong and if you try to argue with\nthe person with anxiety what happens\nthey're going to win so what you need to\nlearn how to do is be stupid what does\nit mean to be stupid being stupid means\nfor the thousand reasons that your mind\nis telling you no just even if it's\nright oh it's so smart look at how high\nyour IQ is be stupid and let's be honest\neven if you're super hopeless about\nyourself and even if you feel terrible\nabout yourself there's still one other\nquestion right which is what you ask\nyourself which is how on Earth can all\nthese [ __ ] idiots do so well in life\nwhen I struggle so damn hard they're\nsuch idiots and they're out there living\nlife well there's your answer it's not\nthat them being idiots makes it harder\nfor them to live life it makes it easier\nfor them to live life right so learn how\nto be a little bit stupid learn how to\ndistrust your mind a little bit if your\nmind is telling you that something is a\ngood idea consider doing the opposite\neven if your mind tells you there's no\npoint this is doomed to failure don't\nbother and when we listen to the\nintelligence of the mind when we listen\nto the analysis when we listen to the\nBrilliance we are being so smart and we\nplay the game of analysis and trying to\nfigure out the perfect answer instead of\njust being stupid and there are lots of\nsituations like this right so I can only\nimagine that I I mean I have no idea but\nyou know there's this famous kind of\nstory of Bill Gates dropping out of\nHarvard and once you get into Harvard\nUniversity like oh my God how idiotic is\nit to drop out so much of what we Crave\nin life seems stupid from the outside\neven my own story I struggled so hard to\nget into Medical School struggled so\nhard in medical school to get into a top\nresidency became faculty at a top\ninstitution and invested so much in this\nand walked away to do what to do this\nit's idiotic to walk away from such\nopportunity oh my God so I'd encourage\nyou to stop trying to figure things out\nso elegantly stop trying to be so smart\nand instead be a little bit idiotic be a\nlittle bit stupid you'll be amazed at\nwhere it gets you\nforeign"
