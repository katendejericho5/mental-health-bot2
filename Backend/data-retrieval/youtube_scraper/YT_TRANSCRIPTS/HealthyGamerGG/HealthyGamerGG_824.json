    "transcript": "is that if you have a patient with\nautism you should consider evaluating\nthem for gender identity issues and if\nyou have a patient who's got gender\nidentity issues you should evaluate them\nfor autism traits so what I want to talk\nto you all about today is something\nreally really interesting and that is\nthere's a new paper that just came out\nthat's a meta-analysis looking at the\nrelationship between autism spectrum\ndisorder and gender identity issues and\nI really really love this paper because\nit illustrates a lot of really cool\nthings so the first thing that we've got\nto kind of dive into is that\naround 2010 there was a paper that came\nout that looked at the link between\nAutism Spectrum Disorder and gender\nidentity or gender dysphoria and so this\nthis is the initial paper and it's sort\nof like some people kind of caught wind\nof it and it seemed kind of interesting\nbut over the last decade the interest in\nautism spectrum disorder has increased\nexponentially and the interest in gender\nidentity issues has also increased\nexponentially in the last two years the\nnumber of uh studies on autism and\ngender identity issues has more than\ndoubled\nand so this paper is really cool because\nwhat they're essentially doing is\nsynthesizing this explosion of research\nand the paper essentially found\nsomething really really shocking which\nis that if you look at people who have\num\nso if you look at people who have autism\nspectrum disorder they're 11 times as\nlike more likely to have gender identity\nissues okay so that's kind of really\ninteresting because it suggests that\nthere's a very strong link so what we're\nwhat the paper essentially did is it's\nsomething called a meta-analysis so what\nthey did is they took 41 different\nstudies looking at the link between\nAutism Spectrum Disorder and gender\nidentity disorder and they essentially\nAmalgamated all of that data because a\nlot of times studies will have just you\nknow they'll have like 30 uh\nparticipants in it or the sample sizes\nwill be small like 100 here 50 there but\nwhat this study did is pooled data from\n41 studies to really figure out what\nkind of like high quality conclusions\ncan we draw\nso let's actually take a quick look at\nsome of the findings of the study okay\nso one thing I really like about this\nstudy is that they started by looking at\nthe general population\nand what they essentially\nfound in the general population is that\nwhen you have a high amount of autism\ntraits\nin kids\ntheir parents\nreported\nhigh levels of gender identity variants\nand this is something that I really like\nabout this paper is that they looked at\ndifferent populations and actually asked\na bunch of different research questions\nso the first thing is that parents\nreported\nincreased gender variance when their\nchildren had more autistic traits then\nwhat they did is they took a look at the\nautism population\nso this is just looking at everybody and\nthen what they did is they said okay so\nwhat happens if we take a group of\npeople who have autism spectrum disorder\nif we take let's say 100 people with\nAutism Spectrum Disorder what do we find\nand what they found is that if you have\nautism spectrum disorder you're four\ntimes as likely\nto endorse\ngender dysphoria\nor gender identity issues so that means\nthat people with Autism are 400 percent\nmore likely to have issues around gender\nvariants\nso they also found that 15 percent of\npeople with Autism Spectrum Disorder\nactually report being non-binary so\nthat's a staggering amount okay and so\ndo you all understand how this is like\nthese are two different statistics one\nis a total prevalence within the\npopulation and one is a relative number\nso this is compared to people who are\nnot on the autism spectrum then what\nthey did is tried to see kind of the\nreverse relationship so they looked at\nstudies with people who said that they\nhave gender identity variants\nor gender dysphoria and they ask the\nquestion okay if someone has gender\nidentity variance or gender dysphoria\nwhat is the likelihood that they're\nautistic and this is something that they\nfound that was really interesting\namongst Kids 3 to 21 percent of children\nwho reported gender identity issues\nactually have a high degree of autism\nspectrum disorder or traits they then\nlooked at adults\nbecause all these different studies 41\nstudies are looking at different\npopulations and what they found is about\n4.8 to 7.8 percent of adults with autism\nwith gender identity issues\nwill either have autism or test highly\nfor autistic traits\nso this is kind of interesting because\nthese are actually two separate\nquestions right so asking the question\nwhat percentage of people with Autism\nSpectrum have gender identity issues and\nasking the question what percentage of\npeople with gender identity issues have\nautism spectrum are actually two\ndifferent questions and you may Wonder\nwell what's the difference why is it\nimportant so let me put it this way\nlet's take an alternate consideration\nfor a second okay\nso let's assume for a moment that we're\ntalking about\nthe correlation between Indians and\ndoctors there are a lot of Indian\ndoctors right so asking the question\nwhat percentage of doctors are Indian\nand what percentage of Indians are\ndoctors those are two very separate\nquestions and the other really important\nthing is once we start tunneling down\ninto the correlation we can start to\nunderstand causation so does being a\ndoctor make you more likely to be Indian\nor does being Indian make you more\nlikely to be a doctor and this is really\nimportant because we start with sort of\ncorrelations and then what we end up\nwanting to do is actually looking at\ncausation so what's the directional flow\nhere which one is it does being autistic\nmake you more likely to be to have\ngender identity variants or does having\ngender identity variance make you more\nlikely to be autistic\nso now what is kind of the significance\nof this so there are a couple things\nthat I I want to share with you all so\nthe first is that this study I think is\nimportant for a couple of really\nimportant uh this study is important for\na couple of reasons the first is that\nautism spectrum disorder is a\nneurodevelopmental disorder\nand what that sort of means is that\nyou're not necessarily born with all of\nthe traits of autism the the the way\nthat you develop as a human being if you\nhave autism spectrum disorder changes\nover time it's an altered course of\ndevelopment\nwe also know that gender identity or\ngender dysphoria also develops over time\nright so a one-year-old will have a\ndifferent sense of gender identity than\nlet's say a 15 year old or even 25 year\nold or even 35 year old so both of these\nsort of have developmental tracks and\nthe interesting thing is that since\ngender identity is Developmental and we\nknow that the brains of people with\nAutism Spectrum Disorder have different\nneurodevelopmental trajectories that\nsort of gives us a clue as to how these\ntwo things could interact\nthe next thing that's really important\nabout this is that it's sort of\ntouches on the causes of both of these\npotential issues so this is kind of\nwhere we're starting to understand a\nlittle bit about genetics and\nepigenetics\nso in the case of people who have autism\nspectrum disorder plus gender identity\nissues you know is there one gene that\nleads to to both of these things or is\nthere like a gene that makes people more\nlikely to be autistic which in turn\ninforms the way that they develop their\ngender identity or is it some kind of\nepigenetic phenomenon\nthat sort of that autism spectrum\ndisorder changes the way that we\nactivate our genes which in turn changes\ndetermines our gender identity so it's\nkind of a really interesting look into\nthe genetic impact or epigenetic impact\nof the development of both of these\nthings\nthe third reason why this is really\nimportant is because it sort of gives us\na clue how these conditions develop or\npotentially how to help these people so\nfor example one of the theories that\npeople have posited which I I place a\nlot of emphasis in just based on my\nclinical work is that people with Autism\nSpectrum Disorder have difficulty\nmentalizing\nso let's understand what mentalizing is\nso generally speaking when some someone\nacts when there's some kind of behavior\nhuman beings have the capacity to\nunderstand what is in the mind of\nsomeone who performs an action and\nthat's not only the actions that other\npeople commit but our own actions so for\nexample if someone gives me a birthday\npresent I am able to understand I'm able\nto mentalize and think okay this person\ngave me a birthday present which means\nthat they care about me\nso if someone for example gives me a\nvalentine I'm able to mentalize and try\nto understand okay what does this mean\nabout what's going on in the other\nperson's head\nso people with Autism Spectrum Disorder\nhave difficulty mentalizing and\nmentalizing doesn't just have to do with\nexternal people it also has to do with\ninternal thoughts so are a bit people\nwith Autism Spectrum Disorder have\ndifficulty understanding their internal\nenvironment and how it shapes their\nactions so this is what leads to a lot\nof things like social difficulties\nbecause they're not really aware of of\nsometimes what they're feeling or\nexperiencing on the inside in my work\nwith people on the autism spectrum has\nmaybe sort of realize how much they look\nat certain things like social\ninteractions like mathematical problems\nis as opposed to sort of empathically or\nbeing able to mentalize and sort of\nunderstand it intrinsically\nand what we kind of know about gender\nidentity is if you kind of think about\nit gender identity is internally\ndetermined right especially when we're\ntalking about gender identity variants\nso there are certain physical features\nthat I have that may make me a man but\nmy sense of being a man is sort of\ndetermined somewhat internally there's\nan external component and there's an\ninternal component and if we have people\nwho struggle to understand their\ninternal state it sort of makes sense\nthat they would struggle to understand\nwhat their gender identity is because a\nlot of that comes from actually the\ninside\nso this is really important because it\nsort of gives us a clue that if you have\nautism spectrum disorder and you have\ngender identity variants maybe what we\nneed to do is insert some amount of\nmentalization training\nand if we can do that we can help people\nsort of figure out what their gender\nidentity is\nthe last thing the last reason why this\nis kind of really important is that it's\nactually applicable for the people\ninvolved so what that sort of means is\nthat if you are someone who is\nstruggling with gender identity issues\nand you haven't been evaluated for\nautism that may be something that you\nshould really consider doing if you're\nsomeone who struggles who's been\ndiagnosed with autism or has high levels\nof autistic traits and you haven't\nreally explored gender identity issues\nbut maybe this kind of manifests this is\nkind of what I've seen is that people\nwith Autism sometimes this manifests as\ndifficulties forming relationships and\nyou may sort of think okay this is a\nlack of social skills but sometimes what\nI've actually found is part of the\nreason that it's difficult to form\nromantic relationships is because\nthere's some amount of confusion about\nmy own gender identity and once that\nconfusion gets resolved it becomes far\neasier to engage in significant romantic\nrelationships\nso if you've got autism you should get\ngender identity stuff kind of checked\nout if you've got gender identity\nvariants you should potentially get\nevaluated for autism spectrum disorder\nand then the last thing is that if\nyou're a clinician who's listening to\nthis I think it's really important\nbecause these these percentages of\ncomorbidity are incredibly High okay and\nso what that sort of means is that if\nyou're a clinician who's working with a\na client who's on the Spectrum it's\nprobably worthwhile to evaluate them for\ngender identity issues maybe help them\nwith those issues and if you're working\nwith someone who's got gender identity\nissues it may be worthwhile to evaluate\nfor them for autism because what we know\nis that both of these things\nindependently increase the risk\nof mental distress\nand so what we're sort of doing is that\nsome people even hypothesize that these\nwill have a multiplicative effect and so\nif you really want to help these people\nas a clinician you should really be\nthinking about both of these things\nso this has been a really quick overview\nof a really interesting meta-analysis\nthat just came out about autism spectrum\ndisorder and gender identity the the big\ntakeaway is that these two things seem\nto be highly highly linked\nwe're not really sure why but we're\ntalking about 11 times the population\naverage in terms of what the linkage is\nwe're not really sure which one comes\nfirst is it a chicken or egg issue is\ngender identity to come first does\nautism spectrum come first but we can\nabsolutely see some sort of hypotheses\nwhy for example if you're on the\nSpectrum and you have difficulty\nmentalizing why it may be difficult to\nunderstand what your gender identity is\nand once we sort of understand that that\nbecomes really important because that\ngives us a road forward\nin terms of how to actually resolve\nthese issues\nquestions\nwhere can we find the paper so the paper\nis I can give you all the it's autism\nspectrum disorder and gender dysphoria\nincongruence a systematic literature\nreview\npublished uh\nin March of 2022\nthe primary author is Khalid sunaki\nwe'll get around to okay what's\nepigenetic great question\nso epigenetic\nis\nso we know that genes\ninfluence stuff\nepigenetic is the turning on or turning\noff of genes\nso it's not sufficient to have a gene\nbut there are certain things that will\nactivate a gene and certain things that\nwill turn off a gene so if you look at\nfor example how trauma affects our\ncortisol system our stress response\nsystem what we recognize is that some\npeople who experience some degree of\ntrauma will turn on a bunch of genes so\nif you do a chromosomal analysis\nof two people they can have the exact\nsame genes but one of them can wind up\nwith PTSD and one of them won't and\nwhat's the difference it's whether the\ngenes are turned on or off so what we're\nsort of starting to realize is it's not\nenough to just look at chromosomes right\nso you can't like take an embryo that\nhas 46 chromosomes and determine whether\nthat person has PTSD what determines\nwhether that person has PTSD is not only\nthe experience but which genes are\nturned on and which genes are turned off\nso this is a this is a really good\nquestion Soul Dragon Bane is saying why\nare autism\nuh ASD and gender dysphoria called\ncomorbidities morbid sounds bad yeah so\nthe term morbid has its roots\nin sort of the the Assumption of illness\nright and this is something that's\nreally important to understand is that\nin the medical field and in society we\nare grappling with what constitutes a\ndisorder versus is an acceptable normal\nvariant of human beings so are people so\nwhen people say we when we diagnose\nsomeone with autism spectrum disorder we\nare making an assumption or we're making\na value judgment that this is\nan illness right that's why we're\ncalling it a disorder\nand so some people this is why some of\nthis phrasing around neurodiverse and\nneurotypical is starting to arise right\nbecause people are sort of recognizing\nthat okay some of this may not actually\nbe an illness this may just be a variant\nof the population\nnow this is where generally speaking the\ndividing line that we have\ntends to be in terms of function so if I\nhave someone who has severe autism\nspectrum disorder so I've worked with\nsome people like that who are non-verbal\num you know are not really able to\nregulate their emotions can do certain\namount of like feeding themselves or\ntoileting or things like that but like\nneed assistance with their ADLs which\nare activities of daily living\nso like that person if they were you\nknow left in a house by themselves for\n30 days would probably not be able to\nsurvive\nright so what that classify as a\ndisorder I personally think so now if\nyou disagree with that I'm open to\ndiscussion I'm not saying I'm right\nthere but I I think generally speaking\nthe way that we Define disorders are by\nthrough impairment of function and\ndefinitely in the case of some autism\nspectrum disorder patients I've worked\nwith they're not functional without a\nsubstantial amount of help it doesn't\nmean that they're good people or bad\npeople or worth less or worth more than\nother people in society we're not\nplacing a value judgment on the the\nvalue of a human life\nwhat a disorder usually means is is how\nis there is there an impairment of\nfunction\nit's a great great conversation\nso what's the age of people involved in\nthe meta-analysis\num so that's a great question too so the\nage is variable that's the whole point\nof the meta-analysis is that there are\nsome studies that look at kids some\nstudies that look at adults and what\nthese people did is look at the\ndifferences so for example what they\nfound is that children\nwith gender identity variants there's a\n3 to 21 percent\nchance that they have autism spectrum\ndisorder but adults have a five to eight\npercent chance of autism spectrum\ndisorder and so what does that mean\nthat's really interesting right\nso we're not entirely sure but that sort\nof suggests this neurodevelopmental link\nthat the two conditions let's just call\nthem that for now seem to\nhave a developmental aspect to it so as\npeople grow up and change the numbers\nstart to change as well so some things\nget resolved some things don't\nwhat's the most important clinical data\nto track in private practice as related\nto this I think the most important\nclinical takeaway for me is that\noftentimes patients who come in with\nautism spectrum disorder it is not a\nroutine part of a clinical evaluation to\nassess their gender identity right so\nyou may assess suicidality or coping\nskills or communication skills or social\ninteractions but it is not a routine\npart at least as far as I know I could\nbe wrong I'm not specialized in you know\nit's not like 99 of my practice or 90 of\nmy practice is autism spectrum disorder\num I'm sure that the good clinicians\nhave figured this out but for other\nclinicians who have a more general\npractice I think the most important\nclinical takeaway is that if you have a\npatient with autism\nyou should consider evaluating them for\ngender identity issues and if you have a\npatient who's got gender identity issues\nyou should evaluate them for autism\ntraits\nbecause then you can work on those\nthings right so you can like teach them\nhow to mentalize and things like that\nand that could in turn so this is kind\nof the way I'm envisioning it and I've\nalmost not quite done this but I I've\ngrappled with this before where a big\npart of working with people with Autism\nSpectrum disorders helping them be\ncomfortable within themselves\nand so a big part of that could be\nmentalization and so the neat thing\nabout that is that like if the person\nwith autism spectrum disorder if you in\ntalk to them about their social\ndifficulties some of that could be\nrooted in gender identity and like some\namount of gender identity variants which\nmakes it hard for them to figure out\nlike how they plug in to a particular\nSocial Circle\nwait wait how do you communicate poor\nADL skills if you are that person who's\nleft by themselves so generally speaking\nlike\nthere's two kinds of challenges with ADL\ncommunicating ADL skills so most people\nwho struggle with their ADLs are not I\ndon't know about most but many of those\nmany of the groups of people who\nstruggle with ADLs aren't going to be\nable to accurately communicate them so\nlet's say that like I've got you know\nsomething close to anencephaly so\nanencephaly is being born without a\nbrain which is not really a condition\nthat is like conducive with life\nbut let's say that it is conducive with\nlife so that person won't be able to\nperform ADLs\nand that person won't be able to\ncommunicate that they can't perform ADLs\nanother good example of people who\nstruggle to commit uh to perform ADLs or\npeople with dementia like end stage\ndementia and they too won't have\nawareness to be able to communicate\nuh their difficulties with ADLs now\nthere's a lot a lot of there's a large\ngroup of people who struggle with ADLs\nand can communicate them and so a good\nexample of that is like people who are\nactively and severely depressed\nsometimes they struggle with ADLs like\nshowering and grooming and cleaning and\nfeeding themselves and stuff like that\nthey're more able to communicate them\njust depends on what is the cause of of\nthe inability to perform ADLs how can I\ntell the difference between severe\nsocial anxiety awkwardness and ASD so\nthis is exactly why we say like you know\nwe have this disclaimer at the beginning\nbut that's not just a disclaimer it's\nnot a medical legal protecting thing I\nmean it does that sure but this is why\nlike if you're trying to figure out\nwhat's the difference between severe\nsocial anxiety and autism spectrum\ndisorder that's absolutely you should go\nsee it's not something for you to tell\nthe difference I'm not saying that you\ncan't learn about it and have some\ninsight but that's really the job of a\nclinician so if you're trying to figure\nout do I have diagnosis a or do I have\ndiagnosis B\nI'd say the most efficient way to answer\nthat question is to go see someone who\nunderstands the difference in Nuance\nbetween the two the other alternative is\nI suppose you could go become a\npsychiatrist and then you would know the\ndifference and then you would be able to\nself-diagnose conceivably\nbut I don't think you need to invest\neight years of your life in order to do\nthat I just go see a professional\ngreat question though\nhow do you tell when a teenager client\nis making up gender issues\nI I don't know that I would\nI I don't agree with the premise of the\nquestion\nso\nmaking up implies some degree of\nobjective reality\nright so like so some some sometimes\nthey're making it up and sometimes\nthey're not there are ways to assess\nthings so you could for example assess\nmalingering\naround gender identity disorder so like\nyou could assess for that you could also\nadminister some scales that measure the\nlevels of gender identity disorder and\nthings like that so there are some tests\nthat you can do to sort of see okay like\nis this person making it up or not so\nthere are some ways to evaluate that I\ndon't know that that's usually the first\nplace that I would go though if I was\nworking with a teenager who who sort of\nis quote unquote making up gender issues\nif they came to me and said hey I have\ngender identity issues I'd explore that\nwith them\nand and this is where like\nI don't know if this makes sense but\ncalling them fakers does not usually\nresolve the issue so if someone is\nmaking up gender identity issues that's\nusually meeting some kind of\npsychological need and if you point out\nto the person hey you're Faking It\nwhat's going to happen is they're just\ngonna morph into something else that\nmeets the psychological need\nso the right way to kind of handle it\nImo is to actually like help help me\nunderstand what's going on with your\ngender identity and like what's\nhappening there and to try to actually\nsupport them psychologically and\noftentimes when you provide support to\npeople with gender identity issues those\nissues will resolve and by resolve I\ndon't mean that they go away I mean that\nyou can by supporting someone who is\ngoing through the process of discovering\nwhat their gender identity is you can\nhelp them arrive at a conclusion which\nis ultimately the goal right that's like\nthat's the goal is I don't I'm\nnon-binary okay is that are you not sure\nif you're male or female or are you\nneither male nor female there's a\ndifference between a question mark and\nslotting into one of those categories\nand I think the right way to support a\nteenage client who's saying I have a\nquestion mark is to try to figure out\nokay what's going on there and help that\nperson slot into one of the buckets in\nsort of a healthy way and as part of\nthat you may discover that okay this\nperson seems to be malingering and\nthey're sort of saying this kind of\nstuff off because of something else\ngoing on in their life which happens but\nthen you want to address that right you\ndon't want to say hey you're Faking It\nbecause then what will happen is they'll\njust start faking something else\nmake sense"
