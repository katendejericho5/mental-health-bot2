    "transcript": "if you look at people's self-esteem\nafter firing what we discover is the way\nin which people were fired actually\ndetermines their self-esteem so it's not\nlike self-esteem is constant it's how\nyour company treats you on the way out\nthat actually determines your\nself-esteem there are many people who\nwill offer solutions for life do this\nand you will be happy do that and be\nhappy it is my opinion that you must\nunderstand yourself first that is why we\nmade Dr K guide check it out nah all\nright so next up what I want to talk to\nyou all about is layoffs so layoffs are\nsomething that have become increasingly\nimportant and specifically what I'd love\nto do today is share a little bit about\nhow to manage being laid off so the\nbiggest problem that I see with most\nlayoffs is that when people get laid off\nthey tend to feel like they're at fault\nright so the biggest issue is that when\nI get laid off like how do you feel you\nfeel like you are a failure right\nbecause you got laid off and then kind\nof this interesting thing can happen\nwhere we're sort of blaming ourselves\nfor being laid off even though on some\nlevel we may know that the reason we're\ngetting laid off really has nothing to\ndo with us there are large-scale\nmacroscopic economic forces right so\ninflation is at an all-time high we see\nthat like you know there are\ncontractions of value in terms of Amazon\nand Twitter and stuff like that a bunch\nof people are doing layoffs right now\nand we sort of know that there are these\nmacro economic changes but when we\nactually get laid off there's a ton of\nuncertainty and we sort of feel like\nwe're to blame and even if you kind of\nsay if your friends say oh it's not your\nfault like you know the economy is bad\nbut then like what do you do in your\nmind for a second right when someone\nsort of feeds you that copium and\nsometimes we feed ourselves this copium\nespecially with all this anti-work stuff\nthat's going on is we kind of like will\nsay like oh it's not our fault it's\nbecause you know there's macroscopic\neconomic things my boss is an idiot the\ncompany is in trouble and so I'm getting\nlaid off has nothing to do with me it\nall has to do with like corporate\nmalfeasance but even if you tell\nyourself that or if someone else tells\nyou that in the back of your mind\nthere's still this like little question\nright which is well why did I get laid\noff instead of somebody else getting\nlaid off and so if you look at someone\nthat let's say the so-and-so company\nlays off 20 of its workers and if you're\npart of that 20 even if you kind of\nrealize well it's like the company sort\nof screwed up and they have to lay\npeople off even if you sort of realize\nthat you still are kind of thinking in\nthe back of your mind and if people say\noh yeah it's like corporations and\npeople are behaving stupidly and it's\nlike it's not your fault but in the back\nyour mind is like why wasn't I part of\nthe 80 that was kept right what made it\nso that I'm in the 20 that got laid off\nand so there's a lot of data that shows\nthat when people get laid off they feel\nlike it's their fault and what I'd love\nto do today is share with you all a\ncouple of thoughts about first of all\nwhy do companies lay off people secondly\nwhat does the science about layoffs and\nself-esteem tell us and third thirdly\nwhat are some things that you can do to\nkind of bounce back if you've been laid\noff so first thing we're going to talk\nabout are corporations so oftentimes the\nwhat we struggle to understand as\nemployees is that corporations are\noperating within what I would call a\nconstructed reality this actually isn't\nmy term it's it's a term that someone\nvery close to me kind of explained to me\nafter they were laid off but they sort\nof said like it took them some time to\nrealize that their bosses and management\nwere operating in a constructed reality\nand what does that mean it means that\nthey're operating in a reality that is a\nlittle bit divorced from what's actually\ngoing on so I'll give you all a couple\nof examples of this so let's just think\nthrough how long does it take or how\nlong is the time between a company\nrealizing that they are in financial\ntrouble and actually laying people off\nusually it's like quite a short time\nspan right so if we look at if you're\nbeing hired by a company you may have\nlike something like a 90-day trial or\n60-day trial and in a 60 or 90 day trial\nin the hiring process people are really\ntrying to assess what your value is\nright so you work with a particular team\nand then the team is like working with\nyou you work with this person work with\nthis person you have a direct report and\nthey take some time to sort of figure\nout okay where do you fit in where do\nyou bring value do we want to keep you\ndo we not want to keep you so they\nreally get to know you as a person over\nthat amount of time and then make an\naccurate judgment based on your work\nproduct personality your Team Dynamics\nall that kind of stuff about whether to\nkeep you or not keep you when people get\nlaid off is that how it works do they\nsit down and spend 60 to 90 days really\npaying attention to someone and how they\nfit in what value they bring to the\ntable whether they're like a good fit or\na bad fit absolutely not right some\ndecision gets made very very high up and\nthen someone comes to HR the finance\ndepartment or whatever like HR is\nsitting with like the CEO and the\nfinance department and the finance\ndepartment some guy who's crunching\nnumbers in Excel is like yeah we need to\nlay off 20 of our Workforce otherwise\nwe'll go under and the CEO is like okay\nfine so like HR we need to lay off 20 of\nour Workforce and so then HR sits down\nthey're like okay so like here's how\nwe're going to do some kind of analysis\nso they don't actually sit down and like\nthink about what value every employee\nbrings to the table they're running some\nkind of numbers right they're Excel\nspreadsheets they're weird like\ncorporate assessments which are very\nlike standardized they use some kind of\nrubric to decide who we're going to keep\nand who we're going to ask and then that\nstuff kind of gets passed down and this\nis where politics enters where if your\nboss really likes you maybe they can\nadvocate for you a lot but even if they\nadvocate for you it's not like they\nnecessarily can keep you so if your boss\ngets told from you know the order gets\npassed down you need to cut 20 of your\nWorkforce then your boss is like well\ncrap like everyone on my team is\nfantastic that's why they're there but\nthat's not actually how it works right\nwe don't actually look at Value\ngeneration what most companies do when\nthey're thinking about layoffs is look\nat costs and this is the big problem is\nyou have to understand that value and\ncosts are two different things value is\nthe yield that you get from a particular\ninvestment but when it comes to layoffs\nthey're not necessarily looking at the\nvalue are they maybe looking at the\nvalue in sort of a massive scalable\nworksheet kind of way but usually what\nthey're looking at is the cost the cost\nhas to be reduced so something has to be\ncut no matter how valuable you actually\nare so the first thing to understand is\nthat when it comes to layoffs they're\nnot actually assessing your value in a\nvery thorough or Fair way there's\nusually an order from on high that then\ngets churned through some kind of like\nFinancial apparatus and then there's\nlike some kind of like processed\nMcNugget that comes out the other side\nright it's not an actual assessment of\nyour value as a person and they're\noperating within these kinds of ways and\nthen a portion of people end up getting\nlaid off when you get laid off you feel\nlike this is a very personal decision\nthat someone has went gone through and\nlooked at all of your performance\nreviews and sort of compared them to\neverybody else's performance reviews and\nthey've done 360 degree assessments of\ntalking to your boss and talking to your\nco-workers and they went through a deep\nprocess to figure out who we should keep\nand who we shouldn't it's not how it\nhappens in fact the opposite of how it\nhappens right because they don't have\nthe resources for that kind of thing\nthey need to start cutting salaries like\nyesterday so it's a very quick process\nit's based on a constructed reality and\nthey usually choose to ask some\narbitrary percentage of people the\nsecond thing that we're going to dive\ninto is a little bit about research so\nthis is where when someone gets laid off\noftentimes it's a huge blow to your\nself-esteem right because you're\nassuming that the reason that you got\nlaid off is because they're actually\ndoing a very in-depth measurement of\nyour quality as an employee and they're\nchoosing to ask you as opposed to\nsomeone else they're placing a value\njudgment on this other person we're\nsaying we love this child more than we\nlove you and so then what happens is\nthere's a negative impact to your\nself-esteem you feel hurt you feel\nworthless you're like oh my God I'm\nnever going to find a job I'm not worth\na whole lot and then it you really\nstruggle goal science shows that after\ngetting laid off people will basically\ndo one of two things they'll engage in\nhealthy coping strategies or strategic\ncoping mechanisms or what they'll do is\nengage in escaping coping mechanisms so\none is where you kind of like you know\nyou work on your resume you start\nnetworking you kind of like I'm going to\ntake this negativity and I'm gonna put\nin a bunch of effort and even if I feel\nbad about myself if I work really hard\nat my resume or are networking I can\novercome my fundamental deficiency\nthrough effort this is what's called a\nstrategic coping mechanism it's also\ninteresting because it's not necessarily\nthat they're deficient to begin with but\nthat's neither here nor there other\npeople what they'll do is kind of\nretreat from the situation they'll\nengage in escaping coping mechanisms\nwhere I don't want to look at my resume\nbecause I feel worthless I don't want to\nnetwork because if I Network I don't\nbring anything to the table I have no\ninherent values there's no point in\nnetworking these are the kinds of\nthoughts that we tell ourselves and how\ndo we engage with those thoughts by\nrunning far far far away from them if I\nthink about networking then I'm gonna\nhave to confront how I bring nothing to\nthe table so instead what I'm going to\ndo is I'm going to go play video games\nmaybe I'll drink maybe I'll get high\nmaybe I'll do whatever I'm gonna watch\nNetflix I'm gonna eat ice cream by the\ntub like whatever it is I'm gonna engage\nin an escaping uh A coping mechanism\nwell this is what's really interesting\nsome people when they get fired\ndon't suffer from low self-esteem if you\nactually look at this research a lot of\npeople who get fired and you may have\nseen people like this or maybe you're\nlike this where there's actually data\nthat shows that some people are like\nokay even though I got fired I recognize\nthat these are factors outside of my\ncontrol I recognize that me getting\nfired has nothing to do with my inherent\nvalue or what I bring to the table at\nthe company or as a human being and\nthey're able to bounce back more quickly\nnow this is what's so fascinating about\nthis research is out of all the research\nthat I looked at there was one thing\nthat really stuck out to me which is\nthat we assume that the self-esteem\nexists prior to the firing right we\nassume that if I have self-esteem and I\nget fired that's what allows me to\nbounce back and we assume that if I get\nfired and I have low self-esteem then\nit's hard for me to bounce back so this\nis what's really interesting if you look\nat people's self-esteem after firing\nwhat we discover is the way in which\npeople were fired actually determines\nthose self-esteem so it's not like\nself-esteem is constant it's how your\ncompany treats you on the way out that\nactually determines your self-esteem so\nthis is what's really interesting when a\ncompany sits down and talks to someone\nlets them go in a personalized way and\nsort of says like if your boss tells you\nhey you know you've done a really good\njob at the company you bring a ton of\nvalue we're sorry we have to let you go\nthere are economic forces outside of our\ncontrol that have nothing to do with you\nunfortunately we have to release 20 of\nour staff you're in the business\ndevelopment or let's say you're in the\nresearch and development part of our\ncompany and since we've got to cut back\non something we're cutting back on R D\nbecause we've got to focus on our Core\nBusiness as opposed to expanding into a\nnew area which is what where your job is\nthat's why we're letting you go so the\nmore reasons and explanation and the\nwarmer the termination process by your\nemployers the less your self-esteem will\nbe impacted this is what's really\nimportant is that we view our self steam\nor more importantly we view our value as\nbeing independent of the communication\nfrom our employer right we don't really\nthink that the way my boss talks to me\ndetermines my self-esteem but the\nresearch actually shows that that's\nexactly the case and so now what I'm\ngoing to do is share with you all\nsomething really interesting let's do a\nquick thought experiment okay so if my\ncomfort company is kind of a crap shoot\nif they're highly disorganized and if\nthey have no idea what's going on what\ndo you think their termination process\nis going to be like do you think it'll\nbe what I described just now where\nsomeone comes down and sits down with\nyou explains to you what's going on\nexplains to you why they let go if the\ncompany is highly disorganized what kind\nof termination do you think you're going\nto receive you're going to receive like\nhey sorry pack your stuff we gotta let\n20 of people go you're gonna get an\nemail from your boss that has no\nexplanation and then you're shocked\nyou're shell-shocked you walk into work\non Monday morning you get an email at 10\n15. 15 minutes before you have a client\nmeeting that says you're let go you're\nlike pack your bags Security will escort\nyou out within the next hour and how do\nyou imagine people feel when they get\nthat oh my God what did I do what's\ngoing on what's the explanation here\nthey feel terrible their self-esteem\ntanks and the big irony is that the more\nincompetent your company is the more\nlikely your self-esteem is low because\nthey're not appropriately communicating\nwith you so paradoxically even if you're\nvery very valuable at a company but if\nyour company is disorganized you're\ngoing to walk away from that interaction\nfeeling like you're at fault so this is\nthe wild thing that I realized after\nlike looking at 30 papers on coping\nstrategies and consequences of being\nlaid off and stuff like that is that\nactually if your self-esteem is super\nlow that is that actually implies that\nit's like more likely that the company\nis actually screwing up as opposed to\nyou screwing up which is mind-blowing\nright this is actually what the data\nsuggests so now the question kind of\nbecomes okay so if I'm getting laid off\nlike how should I manage that the first\nthing that you should do is think about\nthese two things right so recognize that\nthe pressures on the company are\nsomewhat independent of the value that\nyou bring to the table now if you've\nbeen fired based on substantive feedback\nthat's a whole different ball game but\nthat's usually not company-wide layoffs\nright that's like if you get some kind\nof performance review where they put you\non probation and then six months later\nthey're like we need you to do ABC if\nyou don't do a b or c and then you get\nfired then that's on you it's not\nnecessarily on the company you get me\nget what I'm saying but what I'm talking\nabout is like a little bit different\nwhich is like if you get laid off with a\nbatch of people and even then you may be\nthinking well okay like why did I get\nlaid off and my colleague didn't because\nI'm worth less than they are well that's\nnot necessarily true so just understand\nthat the second thing that you should do\nif your self-esteem is in the pits is\nask yourself what was the nature in\nwhich I got fired how is how is that\ncommunicated to me did people sort of\nlike have me like a warm send off or was\nit like cold and heartless did they\nprovide reasoning and understanding and\ndo they kind of explain to me what my\nvalue was or was it like this kind of\ndisorganized heartless process and then\nwhat you've got to realize is if it's a\nheartless process if the answer that\nquestion is yes then you've got to\nrealize that's on them that's not\nactually on you does that make sense so\nyou've got to really understand that\neven though you may feel like crap it's\ntheir lack of communication that\nactually makes you feel like crap as\nopposed to you being crap and that's why\nyou didn't deserve communication that's\nnot how it works so the manner of the\nfiring determines self-esteem and so if\nyou weren't let go in sort of like a\nwarm organized information positive kind\nof way even if they said hey we need to\nlet you go because you're not pulling\nyour weight in an ABC category\ninterestingly enough those people have\nbetter self-esteem because they\nrecognize where they they need to\nimprove and they can actually bounce\nback from that easier so the first thing\nis to recognize points one and two the\nthird thing that you should really do is\nspend some time grieving so this is\nwhere I know it's kind of weird but I\nworked with one patient who once told me\nthat I got fired 10 years ago and that\nwas actually way more traumatic to me\nthan my divorce which I was shocked to\nhear but as we kind of talked about it\nyou know being let go from your job can\nabsolutely be traumatic and sometimes\nwhat you've really got to do is the best\nword is actually grieve so if we talk\nabout how do human beings cope with loss\nthe word that we use for that is grief\nright so we kind of want to go through\nthe stages of grief which may be like\ndenial and anger and bargaining and\nfinal acceptance and stuff like that\nthose are the cubler Ross stages of\ngrief but the key thing here is to just\ngive yourself a little bit of time to\nlike recuperate you don't Dive Right\ninto finding a new job don't you know\npick up wake up the next day pick up a\nphone and call 15 recruiters don't\npolish up your resume the next day give\nyourself a little bit of time why is\nthat well it's because if you start\npanicking and calling recruiters they're\ngonna pick that up right so they're\ngoing to pick up your emotional\nunhappiness and things like that and it\ncan actually kind of set you off on the\nwrong foot so you want to give yourself\nsomewhere between I would say one week\nand one month to kind of like grieve\nthis loss depending on your financial\nsituation and then the next thing that\nyou probably want to do is talk to\nsomeone so this is where we want you to\nbe in a sound emotional state whenever\nyou re-approach the job and so some of\nthat is just going to be some amount of\nemotional decompression so you can talk\nto a family member you can talk to a\ncolleague you can seek professional help\nyou can talk to a coach they're actually\nreally good at helping with this kind of\nstuff so there's a lot of like uh you\nknow like Harvard Business review and\nand Publications like that will\nfrequently talk about how to cope with\nlayoffs and I've noticed that the most\ncommon authors for those kinds of\narticles are actually coaches so you you\nspend some time just sort of\ndecompressing your emotions that you can\nsort of get a clear head and then the\nlast thing that you should do is dive\nback in right so at the end of the day\nrecognize that if we sort of list the\nfirst couple of things that part of the\nreason that you were let go were forces\noutside of your control that yourself\nthat the blow to your self-esteem may\nnot actually determine your value that\nthere's a difference between the way\nthat you feel about yourself and what\nyour actual value is and the way that\nyou feel about yourself depends on the\nmanner in which you were fired so then\nwhat once you kind of recognize that\nstart to really think about okay what is\nthe value that I bring to the table what\nwere the things that I could have done\nbetter what were the things that I'm\nactually really proud of at work right\nso what were the things that I really\ndid well because chances are you did\nsomething there if you were let go kind\nof in a group of layoffs there's a\nreason you hadn't been fired yet right\nyou were there for a while maybe you\nwere there for a year or two years 10\nyears 15 years I've heard all these\nstories and if you're there for 15 years\nyou're bringing some kind of value so as\nyou start to think about that sort of\nzero in on that a little bit start to\nreally think about how you do bring\nvalue to the table and maybe you were in\nthe r d department and why did you let\ngo why did they let you go it's because\nthey don't have money for r d anymore\nthat doesn't affect your value as a\nhuman being that just means they\ncouldn't afford the value that you bring\nright so those are two very different\nthings and once you kind of zero in on\nthat this is what we sort of known from\nrecovering from trauma you should weave\nthat into a narrative and so the biggest\nproblem with low self-esteem and getting\nfired is is we turn that into a\nnarrative of negativity the reason I got\nfired is because I am worthless you've\ngot to reshape that narrative based on\nthe value that you bring to the table\nand the appropriate external factors I\nbring this value to the table and the\nreason that I got fired is because my\ncompany could no longer afford to invest\nin r d so what I'm looking for from from\nfuture companies and what I'm curious\nabout on your company is that are you\nguys interested in growing are you guys\ninterested in r d if so I'm the right\nfit for you and so as we reconstruct\nthat narrative as we lean into our own\nvalue what science tells us is that our\nself-esteem will grow and people who are\nable to construct that positive\nnarrative this is also comes from\nresearch from the post-traumatic growth\ntradition or that section of research as\nwe're able to re reinvent not reinvent\nbut really shape that narrative and kind\nof a value driven and positive way it\nactually manifests in all kinds of\ndifferent ways it improves the way that\nour resume looks in a improves the way\nthat we interact with people it improves\nour networking it improves our\ninterviewing and it even improves our\nchances of finding a good job so I know\nthat being laid off can be a very\ntraumatic experience especially because\nwhen we get laid off we feel like we are\nthe ones at fault right there must be\nsomething wrong with me in order for me\nto be laid off then what kind of happens\nis when we start to feel these kinds of\nthoughts we'll start to take some copium\nwe'll try to reassure ourselves by sort\nof thinking about oh this is Corporate\nmalfeasance everyone up there is an\nidiot will kind of blame them but even\nas we blame them there's this tiny\nlittle thought Stuck in the back of our\nhead which is even if my boss is\nincompetent why was I the person that\ngot laid off as opposed to the four\nother people on my team that got to stay\nso we sort of have to tackle that front\nand center and we want to tackle that by\nfirst of all acknowledging that people\nhave the usually corporations have a\nconstructed reality that has a lot of\nvariables that don't actually have to do\nwith our value the second thing that we\nknow from a lot of research on lay offs\nis the manner in which you were laid off\ndirectly impacts your perception of your\nvalue so if they didn't do a good job of\nlaying you off it's a cold heartless\nemail then that doesn't actually mean\nyou're worthless that just means they're\nmore disorganized and this is what's\nreally tragic about this is the more\ndisorganized the company is the worse\nthe self-esteem is of the employees the\nlast thing to do is in terms of how to\nbounce back give yourself some time to\ngrieve find someone to talk to\nprofession professional colleague friend\nfamily coach therapist and the last\nthing is to really think about the value\nthat you bring to the table and\nstructure a narrative going forward that\nis based on that value if you found this\nvideo helpful check out Dr K's guide\nwe've spent hundreds of hours
