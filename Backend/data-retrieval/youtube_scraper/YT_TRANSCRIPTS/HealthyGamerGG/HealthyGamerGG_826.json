    "transcript": "so if you think about what is the\nfeeling of tiredness the feeling of\ntiredness is an amalgamation of all\nkinds of mental and physiologic signals\nso when we're talking about tiredness\nwe have to remember that there are\ndifferent dimensions of it right so\ntiredness can be felt sort of mentally\nright so like you can sort of feel\nfatigued at the thought of doing\nsomething like if I want to like write a\nbook or if I want to you know move for\nexample that's like a really good one\nit's like oh man I gotta move and if you\nreally think about it like the thought\nof moving is not doesn't actually cost a\nwhole lot of energy it's not like you're\nactually moving it's the very thought of\nit that makes you feel fatigued but we\ndo know that tiredness is not just in\nyour head right we know that there's a\nlot of physiology that has to do with\ntiredness we know that tiredness is a\nmeasure of energy levels so for example\nif I haven't slept in 24 hours I'm gonna\nfeel really really really tired and that\nhas nothing to do with you know whatever\ntasks I need to complete or things like\nthat if I eat a really really heavy meal\nI'm gonna feel really tired afterward\nand that's actually physiologic in\nnature so now what we're going to do is\nlook at tiredness from a different angle\nwhich is sort of the physiologic angle\nand this is oftentimes what people kind\nof think about when they're thinking\nwhen they're talking about tiredness\nthey kind of think about okay there's\nsomething wrong with my energy levels\nand what should I do about it and so\nwhat I'd love to do today is share with\nyou all kind of like how I think about\nor organize looking at tiredness like\nkind of within you from a physiologic\nangle right so how can we understand the\nphysiology of tiredness so a couple of\nkind of quick disclaimers or\nperspectives so the first is that you'll\na lot of people will share or talk about\nbasic science research as it relates to\ntiredness right so people will say\nthings like you can look at like let's\nsay a study that looks at eliminating\nlet's say refined sugar from your diet\nand how that boosts energy levels you\ncan look at studies that correlate\nthings like vitamin D with energy there\nare all kinds of basic science studies\nout there that will say this stuff makes\npeople more tired this stuff makes\npeople less tired these are primarily\nstudy studies that are done in a\nlaboratory so the tricky thing for any\none of those studies it may not apply to\nan individual per person right so for\nall those studies that show that let's\nsay eliminating refined sugar from your\ndiet improves tiredness it doesn't make\ntiredness completely go away a hundred\npercent in everyone in the trial right\nsome people actually get no benefit from\neliminating sugar other people get some\nbenefit from eliminating sugar some\npeople get a lot of benefit from it and\nso then what we do in science is we\naverage all those things together and\nthen we kind of come up with a\nconclusion so generally speaking what I\nfound works almost better as a clinician\nis when you're working with real human\nbeings there are a bunch of different\nsolutions but trying to figure out where\ndo I start should I eliminate gluten\nshould I eliminate Dairy should I\neliminate eggs should I do keto should I\ndo intermittent fasting should I wake up\nevery morning at 5am should I do you\nknow should I go swimming should I do\nresistance training should I do yoga\nshould I do tai chi should I do Qigong\nshould I drink this special kind of\ncoffee should I add the supplement to my\ndiet there are a thousand different\nthings and the answer to all of them is\nyes you'll find someone out there who\nwill talk about a paper who will say yes\nto all of those things but practically\nas a human being like what do you do if\nyou are tired all the time so what I'd\nlove to share with you all today is an\napproach to tiredness that incorporates\nall of that stuff when I think about\ntiredness I think about two buckets and\nthis is what I've learned like working\nfor years as a psychiatrist there's the\nCircadian bucket and there's the\nmetabolic bucket and you may say okay\nlike what do you mean by circadian so\nour body goes through various Cycles\nthroughout the day we feel more tired at\nnight some people feel tired in the\nmorning people have trouble getting out\nof bed people have difficulty with sleep\nso there's a lot of tiredness that has\nnothing to do with like metabolism has\nnothing to do with energy but has to do\nwith cycles and sleep and things like\nthat by energy I mean like you know ATP\ngeneration I don't mean like the\nsubjective feeling of energy because\nthere's a lot of stuff that will\nsubjectively make you feel tired and is\nkind of related to the Circadian stuff\nso this is where I think about things\nlike sleep daily Cycles you know like\nafternoon crashes\ndifficulty waking up in the morning so\nthis is the Circadian bucket so we're\ngoing to talk about all that stuff in\nthe metabolic bucket we've got different\nstuff okay so like let's not worry about\nthe sleep and stuff but the other big\ndimension of tiredness and energy levels\nis what you put into your body and how\nyour body responds to that the key to\nhappiness is whatever is in the link in\nthe description check it out so this is\nstuff like let's say homeostatic balance\nand like blood sugar nutrition\nthings like nutrient deficiencies but\nthere's other stuff going on with\nmetabolism as well like inflammation and\nso this is where all the stuff of like\nwhat should I eat when should I eat it\nand what effect is the food that I put\ninto my body have that's the metabolic\nstuff that's completely different from\nlike the Circadian stuff\nand so as a clinician when someone comes\nin into my office and says I'm tired\nthere's also a psychological component\nor spiritual component you may say like\nwhat do you mean there's a psychological\ncomponent like psychological component\nin terms of there's some tasks that just\nmake you feel tired it's up here you\njust don't want to do it and spiritually\nlike some people come into my office and\nthey say I'm tired and what they really\nmean is like I have no zest for life\neverything just feels like a chore and\nthen what happens is if they try to you\nknow fix their sleep schedule like\nthat's not the problem the problem is\nthat like they've got nothing to look\nforward to during the day they can take\nas many supplements as they want to but\nthat's not going to fix it because it's\nnot a metabolic problem so this approach\nis almost like from a differential\ndiagnosis standpoint what's the\ndifferential diagnosis of feeling tired\nso it can be physiological psychological\nor spiritual and then in the physiology\nof it there's the Circadian branch in\nthe metabolic Branch so let's talk about\nthe Circadian Branch let's start with\nsimple stuff and that is the pathology\nthere are all kinds of things that can\nmess with your sleep so at the top of\nthe list is sleep apnea so sleep apnea\nis a condition that probably affects\nsomewhere around five to eight percent\nof people in the world shockingly High\nresults in periods of cessation of\nbreathing during sleep so essentially\nwhat you do is drown or choke in the\nmiddle of your sleep as you drown or\nchoke you don't get oxygen in then what\nhappens is you start to drown\nphysiologically that's the best word\nright so you're not getting oxygen so\nfor 60 seconds you're gonna have like no\noxygen and then what it does is triggers\na survival response Rush of adrenaline\nyou kind of reset your breathing\napparatus and you start breathing again\nbut the problem is that the the rush of\nadrenaline and physiologic response is\ngoing to make you feel exhausted when\nyou wake up in the morning right because\nthink about what's happening like\nimagine like if you were to get thrown\nover overboard and we're underwater for\n60 seconds before you came up without a\nbreath imagine how exhausted you would\nfeel after that people will have 20 30\n50 60 100 120 apnic episodes per night\nand so physiologically when you wake up\nyour body is ragged that's sleep apnea\nthere are other things that we'll kind\nof talk about there are other diagnoses\nthat you can have but circadian rhythm\ndisorders or other examples you can also\nhave stuff like narcolepsy and and stuff\nlike that but we're not going to talk\nabout that\nso circadian rhythm disorders I think\nthe other really really big one that I\nthink is actually quite common and so\nwhat this what these kind of mean is if\nwe think about a regular day right so\nlet's say there's midnight there's 6 a.m\nthere's noon 6 p.m and then midnight if\nwe think about the activity level over\ntime right so most human beings their\nactivity level is kind of like this\nright so you wake up at maybe six you go\nto work by nine kind of work until 6 PM\nyou kind of wind down in your sleep by\nmidnight now the problem is that some\npeople their circadian rhythm is\nactually more like this and so what that\nmeans is that they're very exhausted\nwhen the rest of the world is working\nthey're just when everyone else goes\nhome for the day I'm just getting\nstarted and between 12 and 4 AM is\nactually my maximum productivity and so\nif your body's clock which is what a\ncircadian rhythm is\nis off-center from the rest of the world\nand you force yourself to wake up at 6am\nlike everyone else this is your\nexperience of life right so like I want\nyou all to think about let's use\ncalculus and calculate area under the\ncurve for somewhere with a circadian\nthis is the total amount of energy that\nthey have during the day\ncompared to a normal person this is the\ntotal amount of energy that they have\nduring the day and so you look at quote\nunquote normal people and you're like\nwow they're able to do so much and you\nlook at yourself and you're like I'm\nexhausted all the time I can't do [ __ ]\nand that's because you've got a\ncircadian rhythm disorder and you you\ncan actually do the same amount it's\njust you're you're jet lagged compared\nto society so this is a circadian rhythm\ndisorder there's also all kinds of\nreally interesting research\nfor example the Circadian rhythm of\nteenagers shifts later so there's data\nthat shows that if you start school at 9\n00 am or even 10 a.m instead of let's\nsay like 8 A.M that teenagers will do a\nlot better because their circadian\nrhythm changes why does their circadian\nrhythm change because they're going\nthrough puberty and growth spurts and\nour body physically grows while we're\nasleep and I don't know if you all have\nnoticed this but our body does a lot of\ngrowing when we're teenagers right so\nthere's even data that shows that\nschools that start super early for\nteenagers those kids do worse in all\nkinds of different ways okay so there\ncan be circadian rhythm disorders part\nof the problem with circadian rhythm\nstuff okay so let's talk about solutions\nfor a second one is if you've got sleep\napnea the solution is actually medical\ncare right so there are these things\ncalled uh cpaps continuous positive\nairway pressure they're different like\nmedical devices that you can use that\nwill keep you from having apnic episodes\novernight and so like you just have to\nget medical care for that like if you're\nworried about okay how do do I know if I\nhave sleep apnea I can't sort of\ndiagnose you all over the Internet\nunfortunately but a really really common\nsign of sleep apnea is waking up in the\nmorning despite sleeping enough so if\nyou went to bed and you got like eight\nor nine hours of sleep but you wake up\nand you're exhausted and it feels like\nyou didn't get any sleep at all you need\n12 hours of sleep 13 hours of sleep that\nyou should probably talk to a doctor\nabout that another really common sign of\nsleep apnea is snoring so what part of\nthe reason that will become apnic is\nsometimes we have our soft palate and\nour like epiglottis and like some of the\nstuff in our oropharynx literally like\nclamps down and prevents us from\nbreathing so it'll like block our\nAirways from like this oropharynx area\nand we also know that for example having\na lot of like Mass around here so if\nyou've got like a really thick neck or\nobesity can increase the risk of sleep\napnea so even weight loss can be a\ntreatment for sleep apnea depending on\nwhat the physiology is okay so if you\nsnore a lot and if you feel very tired\nin the morning despite getting Out full\nnight sleep Public Service Announcement\ntalk to your doctor about it in the case\nof circadian rhythm disorders things are\na little bit more complicated so part of\nthe reason that I think we have\ncircadian rhythm disorders increasing in\nour society is because we aren't quite\nas bound to the Sun and the Moon as we\nused to be this doesn't mean like we're\nDruids or we're no longer Druids this\nmeans that like literally we have you\nknow this is where all the blue light\nkind of stuff comes in\nso blue light suppresses melatonin\nproduction actually it's this is the\nright symbol from the pineal gland and\nthen melatonin helps us sleep and keeps\nus on schedule which is why people will\nuse melatonin to adjust for jet lag so\nwhat we've got is like we'll take\nmelatonin to help us get on a good sleep\nschedule but here we are using blue\nlight and technology that actually does\nthe opposite of taking a melatonin\ntablet it shuts off melatonin production\nand so this kind of stuff the\navailability of the Internet you may say\nwell what do you mean by that it means\nthat at midnight you know I want you all\nto imagine 10 000 years ago what could\nyou do if you were a human between the\nhours of midnight and 4 AM\nwhat can you do that you can't do\nanything nothing to do everyone's asleep\nbut now we have all kinds of stuff to do\nstuff is available all the time they're\n24-hour eateries we can get food brought\nto our doorstep there's going to be some\ndegenerate noobs that are queuing at 3am\nfor whatever game you want to play and\nso there's all kinds of crap that you\ncan do and that all interferes with your\ncircadian rhythm it allows you to get\ncircadian rhythm adjusted like you can\nbecome an absolute degenerate when it\ncomes to your circadian rhythm but it\nturns out that aside from these kinds of\nthings there are a couple of other\nthings which people don't realize about\ncircadian rhythm so we're going to talk\nabout that the first is that your\ncircadian rhythm is a natural cycle and\nthat there are particular times of the\nday where you're good at particular\nthings so this isn't actually what the\nCircadian rhythm looks like\nwhat the actual circadian rhythm looks\nlike\nit's not like this\nbut probably like this so This maybe is\nlike nine nine to ten a.m this is\nnoonish noon to three this is like four\nto seven and sometimes this is like nine\nto eleven so if you actually look at our\nactivity and this should be flat by the\nway but if you actually look at our\nactivity we actually have like\nfluctuations in our activity and this is\nconserved throughout the mammalian\nKingdom so if you look at like the idea\nof a siesta or a nap in the afternoon\nlike even in some countries in Europe\nlike things will shut down around like 2\np.m and they'll like open up again in\nthe afternoon late afternoon so if you\nlook at most mammals like you look at\nmonkeys monkeys are awake at like you\nknow 5 a.m or even earlier and then they\nkind of chill out around 10 and then\nthey're like quiet during the hottest\npart of the day and then around dusk\nthey become active again same is true of\nlike gazelle and Impala so humans are\nprobably the same way there's even some\nevidence that for example cognitive\nactivity between the hours of 4 and 6\na.m is very very like productive so if\nyou look at religious tradition across\nthe world they all wake up and pray or\nmeditate at like 5 a.m and why do all\nthe religious Traditions do that it\nturns out that there's probably a\ncircadian rhythm there's like something\nabout our mind is more at peace at that\ntime and the other really interesting\nthing is I'll I'll work with some people\nwho think they're night owls and then\nI'll ask them what do you mean like like\nso help me understand the details of\nwhat do you mean by your night owl well\nI get started kind of sometimes around\nmidnight and then at 4am\nsometimes I'll like do my best creative\nwork I'll write music you know like I'll\nwrite prose poetry inspiration like it\ncomes at like three in the morning four\nin the morning which is actually\nconsistent with our circadian rhythm so\nit's not that they're night owls it's\nthat they're like mourning people like\nreally really morning people early\nmorning people which is consistent with\nmost of the mammalian Kingdom another\nconsideration for circadian rhythm which\na lot of people forget is that we have\nthese things called sleep cycles so if\nyou look at sleep it's stage one to four\nsleep and then we have REM sleep after\nthat but what people don't understand\nabout sleep architecture and so you\nbasically go through these five stages\nokay the problem is that different\nstages of sleep do different things for\nus so at the beginning of the night\nlet's say this is stage one sleep this\nis stage two sleep this is stage three\nsleep this is stage four sleep this is\nREM sleep and at the end of the night\nstage one is short stage two is short\nstage three is short stage for let's say\nis a little bit shorter and REM sleep is\nactually really long so the more the\nlonger you sleep the more your brain\nchanges What stages it spends its time\nin so you'll actually go through a sleep\ncycle where you'll go through all five\nof these and then you go through them\nagain then you go back to stage one\nsleep now one thing that people don't\nrealize is that if you wake up in the\nmiddle of a sleep cycle you will feel\nreally groggy and I don't know if this\nhas ever happened to you all but you may\nfind that's kind of weird but like if I\nsleep eight hours I will feel tired when\nI wake up if I sleep eight and a half to\nnine I'll feel really good or if I sleep\nfour hours or six hours I'll feel really\ngood it's easier for me to wake up with\nsix hours of sleep than it is for me to\nwake up with seven to eight hours of\nsleep if y'all ever observe that like\nit's really weird like I'm actually\ngetting less sleep but I feel more\nrested when I wake up and it's because\nyou have to wake up during the right\ntime of your sleep cycle then you won't\nfeel groggy but if you wake up during\nlike the middle of your sleep cycle it's\ngonna be a mess this is also why and in\nthe progression of sleep staging is\nactually really really important because\nwe know that for example a lot of the\ngood stuff in sleep happens in rem and\nto this day if anyone tells you they\nknow exactly what's going going on in\nour brain and sleep they don't know what\nthey're talking about because no one\nreally knows pay attention to your sleep\ncycles and recognize that you may not\nneed eight how did we get the number\neight eight hours of sleep a night is\nwhat the doctors recommend what they did\nis they took a thousand people\nand they took these thousand people and\nthey asked okay who here is healthy and\nthese four people raised their hands and\nthen they asked them how much do you\nsleep at night one person said ten one\nperson said eight one person said seven\none person said 7.5 they averaged all\nthese numbers together and they decided\nokay 7.5 is the healthy amount of sleep\nthat you need so this is really weird if\nwe use this system to make clothing\nrecommendations everyone would wear gray\nsmocks that were like medium to large\nwe're like okay Doctor what should I\nwear today and they're like well let me\nask 10 people what they're wearing\naverage their sizes average their colors\naverage their cuts and that's the answer\nthis is how we do medicine this is how\nwe do basic science research we just\naverage a bunch of people together right\nso when we look at Daily caloric intake\nhow did we get that number we got it the\nsame way why is it 2 000 calories a day\nwell we just asked people who are\nhealthy how much they ate and now you\nhave papers that come out that show that\nmild calorie restriction like 1800\ncalories a day actually leads to Better\nHealth outcomes over the long term so it\nturns out that that number that we got\nby just averaging all the crap together\nturned out to actually not lead to the\nbest health fascinating who would have\nthought that if you just ask 10 people\nwhat works for them and average it all\ntogether that that's not actually the\nright answer of what works for you okay\nso be aware of waking up in the middle\nof your sleep cycle and remember that\none of the reasons that you may not be\nuh you could be like tired from a\ncircadian standpoint is if you're not\ngetting enough sleep progression\nthroughout the night so we don't want to\njust sleep you know with a low amount of\nREM sleep but we can't it's not like\nit's the first two hours of sleep in the\nlast two hours of sleep give us\ndifferent benefits now a good way to\ntransition to metabolism is by talking\nabout caffeine\nso what does caffeine do caffeine the\nsimplest way to describe what caffeine\ndoes is it suppresses adenosine\nreceptors\nin the brain so we have this thing\ncalled ATP which is our basic unit of\nenergy in our cells and when you use up\nan ATP you end up with an adenosine\nbyproduct so this is like when we have\nvery high levels of a dentist ATP this\nmeans that we have lots of energy and we\nhave high levels of adenosine this means\nthat we've got low energy and then what\nwe have is we have something that\nmeasures this so we're measuring our our\nadenosine to ATP that doesn't\noversimplify and so what caffeine does\nis it blocks the signal of low energy it\ndoes not actually give us energy it just\nmakes our body numb to energy or the\nlack of energy right so it's like it's\nlike the equivalent of like if we were\ntaking met medication that suppressed\nour hunger or suppressed our thirst\nthat's analogous to what caffeine does\nso it numbs our body's ability to detect\nfatigue which is why we feel more\nenergized but we're not actually\nenergized right it also does other\nthings like suppress appetite and things\nlike that which gets really interesting\nthe key thing about caffeine is as we\nuse caffeine it's going to make us feel\nmore energy without\nactually\nhaving more energy\nnow there are other effects of caffeine\nas well so like it increases heart rate\nfor example so it increases our pulse so\nwe get kind of amped up you can sort of\nget the Jitters with caffeine right so\nit does like all kinds of other things\nbut this is where a lot of people will\ncombat this kind of stuff like sleep\napnea with things like caffeine so when\nI have patients who have sleep apnea\nsometimes I'll ask them do you feel\ntired in the morning they'll be like\nyeah absolutely and then I'll ask them\nokay what do you do when you wake up it\nstarts with two cups of coffee I'm like\nwow okay so now this person has two\nthings going on not only do they have\nsleep apnea but now they're blocking all\nof their energy signals and then what\nhappens is they don't actually take rest\nwhen they need to so then like then they\nstart running their car starts running\non empty which creates all these other\nproblems so generally speaking a lot of\npeople like caffeine there's some\nevidence that shows that a moderate\namount of caffeine which may have more\nto do actually with the other things in\ncaffeinated beverages so if you look at\nthings like green tea or coffee there\nare all kinds of like phenols and like\nother things that probably have positive\nhealth benefits that a modern amount of\ncaffeine intake per day actually can be\nfine or even healthy but what you've got\nto be really careful about is if you're\ntired and you're drinking caffeine\nespecially if you're drinking a lot of\ncaffeine chances are what's happening is\nthat the caffeine is suppressing your\nbody's ability to detect fatigue and so\nyou can't take care of it the way that\nyou should so as an example caffeine\nalso suppresses appetite one of the\nreasons why people like it if they're\ndoing intermittent fasting if I'm using\nan appetite suppressant and I'm running\non a caloric deficiency that's going to\ncause my energy to crash so we use\ncaffeine to feel less tired and we end\nup making ourselves more tired because\nof all kinds of other things so let's\nmove on to the next thing on metabolism\nwhich is glucose balance so remember\nit's an appetite suppressor right so now\nhere's what we got to understand about\nglucose balance we've got two hormones\ninsulin and glucagon there's basically a\nbalance between these two things insulin\nis an anabolic hormone what does\nanabolic mean anabolic means it builds\nthings up so when we have high levels of\ninsulin we've got a lot of available\nenergy and we're going to use that as\nstorage or building stuff like cellular\nMachinery so generally speaking when\nwe're doing this process our energy is\nnot there to be used for activity it's\nthere to store away and build up\nMachinery if you all play games like\nrts's or you know turn-based strategy\ngames insulin is like your expand\nhormone it's like okay we're not going\nto build military units we're going to\nboost up our economy so we're going to\ninvest our resources in having more\nresources later but what this actually\ndoes is makes us feel tired so insulin\nmakes us feel tired and actually\nactivates the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem\nand what is a parasympathetic nervous\nsystem do it rests and digests this is\nalso responsible for food Comas and now\nwe're going to see a very common thing\nthat we're seeing now more and more with\nthe digital generation which is I'm a\nstar of myself for a while because I'm\ndrinking caffeine and I get distracted\nby technology and then I'm going to get\nso so so hungry that I feel super super\nhungry I'm gonna eat a ton of food I'm\ngonna eat like 1500 calories in one meal\nit's going to lead to a surge of insulin\nand The Surge of insulin is going to put\nme into a food coma and then I'm going\nto feel really really really really\ntired and now we understand how improper\nsugar balance can lead to feeling tired\nnow there are all kinds of other things\nto keep in mind here now we get to see a\nlot of why\num a lot of the healthy things that\npeople are touting like how they work\nthe first thing is a low carb diet leads\nto low insulin levels so the trigger for\ninsulin is carbohydrates so you can eat\na ton of fat and protein and your\ninsulin levels will still be low what\nthis sort of means is that if we don't\nhave activation of the parasympathetic\nnervous system people are going to feel\nless tired so if you talk to people who\nare on ketogenic diets they'll say like\nyeah at the beginning it was rough but\nnow I have so much energy throughout the\nday my energy level is actually way\nhigher and I feel way better and why is\nthat it's it's all mediated through\ninsulin so now we can see why low carb\nor keto is pretty good next thing that\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\nis let's say like intermittent fasting\nso if you look at things like fasting\nhas its own whole situation going on but\nlet's talk about that very quickly so\nthe first thing to understand is that we\nhave glycogen\nwhich is essentially our sugar stores\nand they last about eight hours\nafter we run run out of glycogen then we\nstart burning fat\neven breaking down protein and then\nwe're going to turn this we're going to\nuse these to generate glucose we're\ngoing to make sugar because we've run\nout of our sugar stores so for example\nthe brain requires sugar or ketones it\ncan't use other forms of like it can't\nuse fats so we have to make glucose the\nthing is converting sugar to fat is very\nefficient converting fat to sugar is\nvery inefficient it's like the\nefficiency of this process is I'd say\nless than 10 percent 1 16 or whatever\nthat is so it's like six percent\nefficiency or five percent efficiency\nlet's say six percent efficiency and so\nwhat that means is that when when people\nlike we or live in such a calorie dense\nsociety that in order to be healthy what\nwe need to do is start really\ninefficiently burning calories like\nimagine for a moment what your life\nwould be like if instead of needing 2\n000 calories a day you needed 12 000\ncalories a day right like there's like\nif you're really really inefficient then\nyou could eat all the hamburgers and\ncrap that you want to the problem is\nthat we're not that inefficient we're\nactually quite efficient which means\nthat when we eat 2 000 calories we're\ngoing to gain weight 2100 calories 2500\ncalories we're going to gain weight so\nin order to counter that what we need is\nsome of these things like intermittent\nfasting the reason that intermittent\nfasting is so good is because we run out\nof our sugar stores and then for the\nnext eight hours\nwe're in this state which is actually\nthe first state of starvation we're in\nthe early stage of starvation and we're\nburning fat very very inefficiently to\nmaintain our glucose levels but this\ncauses us to lose weight and then we get\nto the third thing which is inflammation\nso when it comes to what to eat and your\nenergy levels there tends to be all\nkinds of crap that causes low-grade\ninflammation so examples of things that\ncause low grade inflammation\nobesity\ngluten\nDairy eggs all kinds of minor food\nallergies now note that this is not\nceliac disease celiac disease is a true\nallergy to gluten but there's even like\na very very interesting cases that I\nI've worked with people who are like\nthis who will feel really really bad if\nthey're eating gluten they cut out\ngluten and then they start to feel more\nenergetic and they start to feel better\nthey have like more energy their mood is\nimproved things like that the really\ninteresting thing is that there is one\nguy in Austin Texas who uses a strain of\nwheat that is a thousand years old so\nhe's like somehow found some kind of\nwheat that is grown somewhere or he\ngrows it himself and so this strain of\nwheat has not been modified or been\nselectively bred for the last thousand\nyears I know people who have gluten\nsensitivities who can eat wheat from his\nbread and be totally fine so something\nabout the way that because if we look at\nit like gluten sensitivity is increasing\nwhy is that so what else has happened\nlike why are human beings suddenly\nbecoming so and we talk about\nsensitivity what we're talking about is\nthere's actually particular proteins in\ngluten that trigger an immune reaction\nso what's changed over the last thousand\nyears we've selectively bred wheat even\nto the discovery of dwarf wheat is a\nNobel prize-winning Discovery because we\nconquered world hunger with the\ndiscovery of dwarf dwarf wheat and so\nthe that's probably some kind of\nchemical change there that triggers some\nkind of immune reaction in some\npercentage of the population so this low\nlevels of inflammation also come from\nthings like processed foods and there's\nall kinds of other stuff so like refined\nsugars\nwill cause inflammation all kinds of\nstuff causes inflammation like the crap\nthat we eat data is really unclear on\nhow much stuff causes what percentage of\ninflammation in what percentage of human\nbeings so you've got some people who are\nlike super super into natural and\nanti-gmo and stuff like that I think\nthat GMO is the worst things in the\nworld right natural is better and\nthere's probably some evidence that some\nof that's true pasture raised is better\nthan farm raised and this and that like\nthere's probably some some benefit to\nthat but we don't we don't really know\nhow much but when it comes to the\nmetabolic stuff reducing these low\nlevels of inflammation so there are\nother things that we also know like\neating fresh fruits and vegetables\nreduces inflammation you may say how\ndoes this reduce inflammation it all has\nto do with gut bacteria so the kinds of\nso this is what what's happened okay in\na quick summary two minute summary so\nhere's a human being let's say 50 000\nyears ago the human being has a certain\ndiet\nthis is the diet of the human being 50\n000 years ago the human being develops a\nsymbiotic relationship with bacteria and\nwe developed this relationship for 50\n000 years because the bacteria helps us\ndigest these things and since we've\nlived with this bacteria for a very long\ntime our immune system thinks that this\nbacteria is a good dude like hey these\nare friendly bacteria we do not need to\nkill them they're not threatening\nmeanwhile over here there's another\nbacteria and this bacteria causes let's\nsay this is anthrax and Anthrax hurts us\nso when the immune system sees this this\nis like this is a bad dude let's kill it\nnow as our diet changes to let's say\njust circles we start to select for a\ndifferent kind of bacteria\nbecause that's the bacteria that the\nbacteria that can digest just the\ncircles is going to grow in our gut now\nthe problem is that this bacteria is\ndifferent from this bacteria and our\nimmune system looks at this and it's\nlike well it's not really bad but it's\nnot very good it's not a friend it's\nlike kind of suss and then this leads to\ninflammation so what we see is when\npeople eat foods that we've been eating\nfor a long time it tends to reduce the\ninflammation in the gut and so what this\nkind of comes down to oh there's also\nother things so exercise is not\nsomething that we talked about but\nexercise\naffects insulin metabolism in a very\npositive way sugar metabolism\nso it sort of fixes this it also affects\nthe kind of food that We crave\nright so I'll ask you all a question\nyou know who here likes to have a\nmilkshake with a burger and fries if you\nenjoy having a milkshake with a burger\nand fries raise your hand who here\nwhenever they exercise for an hour\ncraves a milkshake at the end of the\nhour right when you exercise what kind\nof stuff do you crave you can feel\nreally really really hungry most people\njust want to drink water so exercise\nhelps with all this stuff too so if\ny'all are tired couple things like what\ndo we do if we're tired the first thing\nis pay attention so this is also where\nlike complex carbohydrates so eating a\ncookie and eating like a piece of fruit\nis going to be different because complex\ncarbohydrates have something called a\nlower glycemic index which is the amount\nof insulin that is released in response\nto this food so if I eat an apple this\nis actually not going to lead to a very\nbig insulin Spike if I eat a grape\nthat's going to lead to more insulin\nrelease if I eat a cookie that's gonna\nrelease even more insulin and if I eat a\nwhite flower cracker like not whole\nwheat flour cracker that'll lead to more\ninsulin so generally speaking the higher\nthe glycemic index your diet is the more\ntired you will feel\nnumber one so you can also do\nintermittent fasting or ketogenic diet\nsometimes people will do both whatever\nand now we understand why these things\nwill make people less tired other thing\nis like eat fruits and veggies because\nfruits and veggies have a really\ninteresting thing when you eat high\nfiber diets what ends up happening is I\ndon't know if this kind of makes sense\nbut if you're starving and you eat an\napple you're no longer starving but\nyou're still kind of hungry but you\ncan't really Gorge yourself right so\nlike if I'm really really starving and I\ndon't know if this kind of makes sense\nto y'all if I'm starving if you give me\n1500 calories that is packed very\ndensely I can eat them if I'm like\nreally really hungry but if you give me\nan Apple first and let's say an apple is\nlet's say like 180 calories let's call\nit 200 calories after eating the Apple\nI'm not gonna eat a 1300 calorie meal\nI'm gonna eat like a 700 calorie meal\ndoes that make sense oh gaw RL is rating\nwith a party of 279 thanks for the\nthanks for the raid girl we're talking\nabout metabolism\nI don't know if it's the most exciting\ntopic is it 200 uh so so that's a good\nquestion so this is enough\nthere's so much to learn so that's\nbecause our hunger\nso people are asking okay why doesn't\nApple make you feel full if it's not\nonly calories so our perception of\nhunger is an integration of all kinds of\ncircuits so it's an integration of our\nblood sugar but it's also an integration\nof things like mass in the stomach this\nis why a stretch receptors so even like\nhow much our belly is stretched and how\nmuch weight is in there correlates with\nour hunger so this is why people will\nlike you know talk about rice cakes is\npretty filling they're super low calorie\nbut they have some volume I don't know\nhow much they actually create stretch in\nyour stomach so I'm not really sure if\nthis is a great example but like if you\neat some low calorie dense food that has\na lot of volume you can't eat very much\nof it like you can eat 1500 calories in\none Burger but I don't know that you can\neat like 1500 calories of broccoli right\nlike you just can't do it's like\nphysically like you're not gonna feel\nhungry it'll be like eight heads like\nyou're just gonna the stretch receptors\nare gonna be like enough does that make\nsense there are also different kinds of\nhormones at play here like ghrelin and\nleptin so if you're tired pay attention\nto the glycemic index of stuff by all\nmeans reduce your carbohydrate intake or\nbe careful when you eat so another thing\ngoing back to this and I'll kind of\nintegrate this so let's kind of like\nintegrate all this stuff so let's say\nthat you wake up at 5am so usually when\nI wake up first thing in the morning I\ndon't eat something because I find that\nif I eat something right away I get an\ninsulin Spike and I'm not very\nproductive so if I wake up at 5am I'm\ngonna go two hours maybe I'll have tea\nbut I'll go two hours without any food\nthen I feel very hungry so seven to\neight I'll eat a meal and I'll usually\nhave a pretty heavy meal so today for\nexample I had two breakfast tacos and\nthe thing is when I have two breakfast\ntacos I know that I'm gonna need enough\ncalories so I do this on purpose so I\nknow that like if I eat well actually so\ntoday I woke up at seven it's different\nwith kids so let's do this actually so\nif I eat at eight o'clock between 8 and\n10 a.m I'm not going to to be very\nproductive because now I'm going to be\ndigesting so this is my digestion phase\nso I'm not going to do much work then\nI'll kind of get a second wind sometimes\nI'll even take a nap here so if I eat\nI'll share with you all an interesting\ntechnique one of the best ways to avoid\nafter food after meal fatigue is to lay\ndown on your left side for 20 minutes so\nI'll lay down like after I'll try to\nhave a decently heavy meal I'll lay down\non my left side for about 20 minutes and\nclose my eyes often maybe I'll doze a\nlittle bit I won't actually sleep so\nlet's say 10 30 I wake up then I'm gonna\ndo some kind of like random work between\n10 and 4. this is going to be stuff like\nmeetings emails other kinds of like low\ncognitive activity work and then between\nfour and seven or sometimes between\nseven and nine\nhere sometimes I'll do more creative\nwork like I'll do writing or whatever\nand then it's bedtime so the key thing\nabout like maintaining your energy level\nthroughout the day is like this\nafternoon crash is oftentimes if you\ndon't eat enough for breakfast and\nyou're starving at noon and you eat very\nheavy at noon you're going to have an\nafternoon crash you're gonna have an\nafternoon crash why so there are three\nreasons why you have the afternoon crash\nnumber one we're hungry because\nrushed in the morning I'm rushed in the\nmorning reason number two had caffeine\nin the morning\nright I wake up I have my cup of coffee\nit's an appetite suppressant right and\nfour hours later the caffeine starts to\nwear off a little bit so not only do we\nlike start to feel that tiredness but\nthen this appetite suppressant makes us\neven more hungry and then we eat a\nreally big meal so this plus this equals\nbig meal once we have a big meal big\ninsulin Spike\nmakes us feel tired then what happens is\nnow let's say two hours later so six\nhours post caffeine\nthe caffeine's really starting to wear\noff so this is going to make me tired\nand on top of that it's now 2 P.M\nand what do the monkeys do it too on top\nof that roll in circadian rhythm you're\ngoing to be more tired this is why\npeople crash in the afternoon\nright because everything aligns and so\nif you say okay I'm tired in the\nafternoon what should I do well you can\ndo all kinds of stuff one is you could\njust take a nap second thing you can do\nis eat something with your coffee third\nthing you can do is cut back on your\ncaffeine intake fourth thing you can do\nis when you eat a big meal make sure\nit's low carb fifth thing you can do is\nhave a snack at 10 A.M so that you're\nnot starving when noon comes around\nsixth thing that you can do and I don't\nknow if you all have done this is have\nmore coffee so I know we covered a lot\nof stuff and unfortunately like that's\nif you're tired it's not simple so if\nyou think about what is the feeling of\ntiredness the feeling of tiredness is an\namalgamation of all kinds of mental and\nphysiologic signals insulin leptin\nghrelin inflammation glycogen stores fat\nstores circadian rhythm stuff there's\nstuff going on in your brain in your\nreticular activating formation that is\ncausing you to lay down or calm down or\nfeel tired your vagus nerve is active or\ninactive depending on what's going on\neven the way that you breathe Eve will\naffect your fatigue level and so people\nare struggling with tired everyone's\nmore tired why is that when I work with\npeople I tend to split into two buckets\nthere's the Circadian stuff which has to\ndo with your body's natural rhythms and\nhow we may not be aligned with those\nkinds of natural rhythms how if we get\ninterrupted sleep or if we don't sleep\nenough or if we sleep too much how we'll\nbe tired the next day and in the most\nunlucky cases what we're talking about\nis actual pathology like sleep apnea so\nthe Circadian stuff is kind of like\nsleep but then there's another whole\npiece to this which is metabolism which\nis our actual energy level and how our\nlevel of fatigue throughout the day is\ngoing to be dictated by all these\ndifferent kinds of metabolic hormones\nand sugar balances and stuff like that\nwhich is why everyone will say like oh I\ncut out gluten and now I feel so much\nmore energetic I'm doing keto I'm doing\nintermittent fasting I feel so much\nbetter I feel so much better I feel so\nmuch better and there are all kinds of\nphysiologic reasons for that and so what\neveryone is doing is they're saying like\nOkay so which one of these should I do\nshould I do keto should I do\nintermittent fasting should I cut out\nDairy like should I become vegan should\nI get one of those little watch things\nthat monitors my sleep level what should\nI do should I take melatonin should I\ntake this supplement should I drink more\ncoffee should I drink less coffee should\nI drink a special kind of coffee should\nI drink more expensive coffee everyone's\nwondering like how do we do this stuff\nlike what's the right answer and I don't\nknow how to say this but like if any of\nthat stuff works super super super well\nit would eliminate everything else from\nthe market right like that's what\nhappened with antibiotics if you look at\nlike the alternative medicine that's out\nthere there's very little alternative\nmedicine for the stuff that we do really\nwell with regular medicine right like\neven people who are super into\nalternative medicine like I these are a\nlot of my patients if they get sick\nthey'll take a course of antibiotics\nbecause it works really well so there's\na really interesting principle from the\nhistory of medicine that when there is\none treatment that works if you have 10\ntreatments for something all of them\ndon't work well when you have one\ntreatment that that exists that's\nbecause it works really well it's just\ndarwinian it's like the theory of\nevolution and natural action so you have\nall these thousand diets in which one\nshould you do it comes down to these\nfactors it's not about one diet it's not\nlike this one is the thing that works\nthey all work to some degree the\nquestion is which one fits for you\nwhat's your particular pattern of\ntiredness are you tired first thing in\nthe morning when you wake up what's your\ncaffeine consumption like do you crash\nin the afternoon do you really hit your\nstride at 7 pm because the more that you\nunderstand yourself the more that you'll\nbe able to leverage any of these\nindividual things and figure out what\nkind of plan works well for you if you\nfound this video helpful check out Dr\nK's guide we've spent hundreds of hours\nwriting and filming to help people\nunderstand their mind so that they can\nbuild the
