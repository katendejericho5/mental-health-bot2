    "transcript": "right and because gifted kids spend so\nmuch time trying to make other people\nhappy they just have no cognitive energy\nleft to actually perform you're trying\nto live up to your own expectations\ntrying to live up to their expectations\nwhen all you need to be doing is like\nlearning how a circuit Works welcome\nand today I think that the topic is what\nare you afraid of right or what scares\nyou yes since it's Halloween we're going\nto be focusing on fear and what do you\ngo by my friend\nEleanor okay nice to meet you Eleanor\nso what are you what what scares you\nor what makes you most afraid\ngenerally\ncalled it in like two terms but it's\nfailure and disapproval\nokay\num\nuh it's\nit's more on\nit can come from others the the that\nfeeling of failure and disapproval but\nsometimes it comes even for me and I\nguess along the way I've been I've been\ngranulating the two together and\nit's so scary trying to monitor\neverything you say and do in fear of\nthat\nokay can you tell me a little bit more\nabout\nhow the two have been combined recently\num\nso uh uh to give a bit of context I\nthink it started back in high school\num\nhow do I say this so\nin a simple term I've been called a\ngifted child so like it's it's something\nthat stuck to me ever since childhood\nand until it went and I went to a\nspecialized high school I guess wow and\nthen that sort of thing yeah it's piled\nup and then along the way\num\nI grew a bit arrogant if I can call it\nthat I I started I\nbegan like comparing I think it's more\nof comparing my others first comparing\nmyself to others to feel a sort of\nvalidation so like oh I you got over a\nhundred you got\num this person got a 93 and I got a 95\nand like in inside me I'm like oh I am\nhigher so like I sort of felt validated\nfor that and\nso it went on for like three months like\nI that comparison thing and then I\ndidn't realize that\nothers including the people that I've\nbegan comparing comparing myself into\num began being so annoyed and irritated\nwith it and they began talking behind my\nback that that yeah about that and wait\nso they were annoyed they were annoyed\nthat you would make comparisons\nyes yeah it's so I think it's in a way\nthey think it's sort of arrogant of me\nto compare myself to them\nand you would you would compare yourself\nvocally to them\nyes I used to do that in high school\num yeah in high school okay and I think\nI was around how old was I I think I was\n16. I I think I was 16 or about to turn\n16. okay\num and then that's and we had after a\nfew months I think three or four months\nwe had that intervention\nabout that they like they call it an\nopen Forum where everyone just goes up\nto a person and say whatever they want\nto say about that person like may it be\ncomplaints or anything related to that\nanything they want to say to that person\nthey can say it So like\num so I went up there like they asked me\nto go up there and they began vocalizing\nthe things that um yeah the things that\nI've been doing for the past few months\nand I'm not gonna deny that I'm wrong\nlike deep inside I know that there's a\npart there's I play the YouTube\num that\nuh it was not good of me to vocalize\nwhat uh what\nuh what my scores are and all that sure\nand then yes it's paralleled into\noh my God like in the like right now\nlike what if I say something wrong and I\ndo something wrong and it happened again\nsince after that intervention I began\nwatching what I say what I do like every\nminiscule detail I've been focusing on\nthat so like I don't offend them and how\nmany years ago was that\nwait um so it's 20 22 today\num I think three years okay nearly four\nyears yeah during four years since I'm\nin University right now\num\nand\nafter a few months of that\num some of them came up to me during a\nforum again it was a notes thing like\ninstead of speaking out loud we give the\nperson notes where they where they write\nthings that they want to say to you but\ncan't vocalize it so like yeah they give\nme notes during that forum and it was a\nsubject related thing like you have to\ndo that you can't escape that it's\nsomething mandatory for a specific\nsubject\nso like\nall so like all the things that I've\nseen from previous classmates during\nthat moment they were like um\num you've changed so much and I can\nbarely uh recognize your compare you\ntowards the person that you were before\nand I think that's a good thing and so\num and some of them even say I hope it\ncontinues like this and I understand\nthat coming from them it's it might be a\ngood thing like they were definitely\nobserving the differences of like how I\nacted but how I took uh what I took from\nit was like\num so I have to keep on like watching\nwhat I say every every minute of the day\nlike if I reply to them wrong well they\nlike\nwill be counted as disapproval well\nlike yeah I started from that so it\nsounds tough because like okay so you\nhad a problem quote unquote right and\nthen you started acting very very\ncarefully being very thoughtful about\nwhat you say almost like a little bit\nparanoid\nand and want to make sure that you are\nvery careful with what you say and that\neveryone's like hey this is great\nyou know yes I guess and and it sounds\nquite tiring to police yourself that way\num is that how is it and is that what\nyou feel like you have to do\neven a simple message from even my\nclosest friends I would go I would just\nsay a simple greeting of hi hello good\nmorning and even that I would get so\nnervous like did I did I use the right\nemojis did I write or did I type the\ncorrect things even greetings I'm so\nscared of that okay and so where does\nthe failure and disapproval come in\num that's I think it's more of an\ninternal when it comes to the academics\num it's uh I've mentioned before that I\nlike the comparison thing that I've used\nto do so instead of\num\nI think since I've started University\nthat's where it came from like comparing\nall\nuh I I I don't have any good study\nhabits that's what I'm gonna start with\nI'm the type of person that\nI would study the same day and I would\npass so that's how it started and\nit turned into like now I'm in college\nso\nand everyone's viewing me like\num you can do this specific thing since\nyou came from this specific School\nand and right now all I'm trying to do\nis not fail even though I failed two\nsubjects already and that's like I'm\njust in my second year\nand yeah\nit sounds tough to try to not I mean so\nit sounds like you're not really focused\non learning you're not really focused on\nsucceeding or anything like that you're\njust trying not to fail\nyes uh I think that too since\num I'm a scholar so I need to pass\nactually I can't afford to fail okay\nso snakes are high too so it's not just\nabout ego\nor expectations\nsounds like there's a real Financial\nreason to to I mean because if it sounds\nlike if your grades aren't good then\nyou're not going to be able to go to\nschool anymore\nyes\nyes\num\nyeah I mean and when you say disapproval\nwhose disapproval are you worried about\num\nmyself my parents and even\nI think it generally encompasses my\nfamily members and some of my\num from my friends it's not really\ndisapproval it's more like\ndisappointment that\nsince what what if they ask me for help\nand it's something I cannot help them\nwith especially in subjects that\num they've they or other people have\nheard that I'm good at\nI see so so it sounds like there's this\nokay so let me understand this see if I\nget this Eleanor\nso what I'm getting is that there's like\nthere are two eleanors out there one is\nthis image that other people have of\ngifted child went to a fancy school\nthings are easy for her since she's\naccomplished so much and went to the\nschool like she should be able to handle\nthis\nand friends should like oh like\nEleanor's good at math or good at\nwhatever so like if you're good at math\nor science or or chemistry or whatever\nthen if people come to you for help you\nshould be able to help them\nyes basically that's it and then there's\nthis other Eleanor who's struggling that\nhasn't developed good study habits\num is kind of like struggling not to\nfail but heading towards failure\nand those seem like two very different\npeople\nforeign\nwhich one's the real you\ngenerally can't answer that but I think\nit's leaning more on the latter actually\nthe failure is the real you right\nyes\nand that sounds really scary\nlike you've already failed two classes\nyou don't know how to study\nand if you lose your scholarship like\nthen who will you be\nI don't know well who I will be after\nthat\nright you certainly won't be that first\nperson anymore\nyeah so Eleanor I think it's how\nthis sounds very scary because what I'm\nwhat I'm getting as I listen to you\nit almost feels like\nI I mean maybe I'm coming on too strong\nhere but it feels a little bit\ninevitable to me\nthat\nI'm not saying this is true but what it\nfeels like is I hear your story is like\nalmost like despair like I've already\nfailed two classes and I don't know if I\ncan turn this boat around and save\nmyself before it's too late\num I uh it's for a bit of context I'm\nactually in an engineering program and\nI'm shifting to another engineering\nprogram that I actually like\nthe two subjects that I failed were in\nmy previous one and I'm hoping that I'm\nhoping that maybe it will change once I\nactually started doing what I like okay\nI think that's a good step in the right\ndirection so Eleanor I I don't know if\nthis kind of makes sense are you\nfamiliar with the term ego or ahamgar\num\nI think I have heard the word ego from\nprevious classes in high school what's\nyour understanding of what the ego is\num\nI'm so sorry I can't remember it oh\nthat's all I can remember is that it has\nsomething to do with oneself yeah that\nso so the ego is kind of our opinion\nof ourselves\nand so I don't know if this kind of\nmakes sense but I think the problem is\nthat neither of the two eleanors are\nactually real\nthey're both constructions of the Mind\nwhat do you think about that\num\ntrying to think of it and yeah and it\nwas okay so help me understand what in\nwhat way does it feel right to you\n[Music]\num\nit's so uh\nyou've mentioned that it's not the two\nsides are not really me did I understand\nit right yeah\num so it's like uh I'm not the other\nperson because the the one that's like\ngood grades um the one they asked for\nhelp since\nuh since I think that's more of a mask\nmore than anything and it's built on\nexpectations others have for me and the\nlatter one that's like the one that's\nfailing is\noh it's not really me but more in a way\nthat but more in a way that I'm trying\nmy best to prevent that from happening\nso I'm somewhere in the middle but not\nreally yeah so so let me put it to you\nthis way do you think the Eleanor who is\na failure could exist\nif you did not have these expectations\nfrom the outside\num\nwithout this expectations I don't think\nI would have a concrete definition of\nwhat the failure would be exactly right\nso so this is what I'm saying is that\nboth sides of those are actually like\nthey're based off of expectations so it\nsounds like you had expectations of who\nyou are or you other people placed\nexpectations on you and then almost as a\nresponse to that like it's kind of like\nhere's the real you and people expected\nthis\nbut out of any positive charge like we\nhave to create like a negative charge\ndoes that make sense\nso this is why like gifted kids struggle\nso much like gifted kids feel like\nfailures all the time\nthe gifted kids who are actually\nsuccessful don't even view themselves as\ngifted kids\ndoes that make sense\nyes so once you become because yeah\num because\num uh most gifted most gifted kids that\npeople would call gifted are actually\nvery hard-working individuals\nis how I view them that's how you view\nthem because yeah because they're\ndifferent from you right those are the\nsuccessful ones they're the hard-working\nones and what are you\nif they're hard working what does that\nmake you\nI would always call myself the lazy one\nabsolutely right so that's actually\nfalse too so that is a comparison that\nyour mind is making\ndo you see that\nin the same way that you used to compare\noh I'm smarter because I got a hundred\nand this person got a 93. now you're\nlooking at other people you're making a\ncomparison this person is is hard\nworking they're a real gifted kid\nbut I have a lazy gifted kid\ndo you see how your mind is making that\ncomparison\nyes\nso this is kind of weird but the ego\nmakes comparisons\nso if we if I have an identity of myself\nif I say Eleanor I am\nsmarter than you\nor stupider than you both of those are a\ncomparison it's a sense of identity that\nis not established by me it's\nestablished by a comparison\ndoes that make sense\nyes yes\nso even if you look at people who are\narrogant or egotistical they can't be\narrogant or egotistical without making a\ncomparison to someone else\ndoes that make sense\nyes yes I'm envisioning it right right\nnow actually right and so this is the\nkey thing so feeling like you're\narrogant or feeling like you're a\nfailure or both\ndetermined by your relationship with the\noutside world\nyes yes does that make sense\nwhat are you on affected\nyeah it's affected by external factors\nabsolutely\nnow let me ask you something\nwhen you decided to switch engineering\nmajors\nwas the was the desire to switch coming\nfrom some kind of expectation from the\noutside or some kind of like desire from\nthe inside\num\nI can say it's a mix of both but desire\nis the thing that comes out of comes out\nof on top of those okay very good right\nso there's certainly an element to it\nthat comes from the outside and and that\nthe other interesting thing is like so\nfor example let's just look at that so\nwhat what part of your desire to switch\ncomes from the outside why did you like\nif that kind of makes sense if that\nquestion makes sense\num it's if family think they they want\nme to take an engineering major but\nbut I did not get into that University\nwith that specific major so I have to\npick something that relates to\nengineering that they might approve of\nand I did not like that\nso a few after a year I realized that I\ncan't do this so I'm gonna do what I\nlike even though I've heard that it's so\ndifficult even it's as difficult as the\none that I'm taking so I went and go I I\nwent ahead and planned everything since\nat least if I'm suffering I'm suffering\nin something that I like if that makes\nsense oh so so hold on let me understand\nthis so you're picking a harder major\nit's what they categorize it as hard\nevery day\nyes but but hold on a second Eleanor\naren't you like so here you are a lazy\ngifted kid who's already failed two\nclashes you're on a scholarship and\nyou're picking a harder major like oh my\nGod that doesn't sound like a good idea\nwhen you think about it it does not\nso\nwhat are you doing there\noh\none thing that I actually noticed was\nsince I started studying for the\nsubjects of this major I'm searching at\nI actually like studying studying these\nsubjects compared to my previous ones in\nmy previous ones I would just go\ndo I have to do this again like I have\nto study this again so so\nyeah keep going\nso oh wait I'll reveal my previous is it\nalready we reveal my uh my\nthe sub the major that I'm taking right\nnow if you watch it\nokay I was I I mean I currently I'm\ntaking an electrical engineer in major\nsubjects and I'm switching to a chemical\nengineering\na major so like when I whenever I see\ncircuits I will just go\nis this what I'm gonna do for the rest\nof my life I would I would go stare at\ncircuits like I would connect wires\ncompute voltages currents and all that\nand it does not make me feel like\nit does not make me feel like I want to\ngraduate okay it makes me feel like\nif like it doesn't even it if if I'm\nsorry I'm I'm stuttering as I think\nabout it I see no future where okay with\nthat major so let's just pause for a\nsecond okay I understand you've got more\nto say but I don't want to miss a couple\nof these statements so here's here's an\nidea\nmaybe if you're in a major where you it\nmakes you feel like you don't want to\ngraduate\nand yes if you are in a major that you\nsee no future in\nmaybe that has something to do with why\nyou're failing right and I I know you\nrecognize that so I think the rest of it\nlike whatever else you've got to say is\nactually sort of like you've already\nsaid the most important things\nso my point is like let's just think\nthrough this for a second okay\nso here you are afraid of disapproval\nafraid of failing\nand there's kind of this Eleanor who's\nlike this gifted kid and now you're not\nsure if you can kind of live up to those\nexpectations all of those expectations\ncome from the outside they don't\nactually come from in here\nand so you're afraid yes that you're not\ngoing to be able to live up to them and\nyour families like go be an electrical\nengineer because they make good money\nand they have good jobs and things like\nthat right they're like that's what they\nsaid yeah like you you touch all the\ntopics and you're gifted right Eleanor\nyou're not like like if you were stupid\nthen you couldn't learn electrical\nengineering but since you're gifted\nyou know\nlike you're smart enough to be a\nbrilliant electrical engineer you can\ninvent a computer chip\nyou can make so much money\nyou can do Quantum Computing there's all\nthese kinds of things\nand so even the part of you that's\nafraid of disappointing people\nthat the part of you that's kind of like\nafraid of being a failure but that's\nlike disappointing other people and then\nbeing sort of being a failure yourself\nbut that's the the even the failure\nyourself is you don't want to disappoint\npeople right so it's their\ndisappointment and then your\ndisappointment with yourself for\ndisappointing them does that make sense\nyeah yeah it's actually has nothing to\ndo with you\neven your disappointment is like in\ndisappointing other people\nyou with me\nyes so all that is not you\nand here's what here's why I think it's\nit's good hopeful I'm hopeful that\nyou'll switch to your your chemical\nengineering because\nas long as you're living your life for\nother people like you know disappointing\npeople hurts but it doesn't hurt as much\nas calculating voltages and looking at\ncircuits\nright\nactually that's what I've said I I just\nwent like after doing I after doing a\nsubject\nI just after doing exams for that\nspecific subject I just went on I can't\ndo this I cannot do this so after I saw\nmy parents I just went Mom I'm switching\nto chemical engineering I cannot do this\nanymore yeah so Eleanor let me explain\nsomething to you I've seen this a ton of\ntimes so some gifted kids\nlive a life to avoid disappointing other\npeople\nand if you're living a life to avoid\ndisappointing other people you're living\na life to avoid pain you with me\nyes\nand if you live a life to avoid pain\nwhat you end up signing up for\nis almost certainly more painful than\nthe disappointment\nso it's like you have a choice between\nstudying electrical engineering hating\nlooking at circuits for like\n30 hours a week and then you go get a\njob as an electrical engineer and then\nyou hate your job for 50 hours a week\nfor 40 years that amount of pain is so\ngreat that you will never succeed in\nthat field because your whole strategy\nis to avoid pain\nthat's why you're majoring in electrical\nengineering in the first place\nto avoid the pain of disappointing other\npeople\nright\nyes and so like you can't live a life\nwhere your strategy is to avoid pain\nlike it's not going to work you're never\ngoing to become successful or live up to\nyour potential using that strategy\nyou're trying to pick the least bad\nscenario and that's like you're not\ngoing to become your best self that way\ndoes that make sense\nyes yes I understand it so I think all\nof that crap about discipline like\nthere's two eleanors that's actually the\nsame Eleanor and neither one is you\nwhat you really are is like if you like\nchemical engineering then do chemical\nengineering\nand like I don't know how to say this\nbut the way to make people proud is\nactually by like living your best life\nright because you're gonna do you can do\nelectrical engineering and you may have\nthe IQ to do it but you're not going to\nmake your parents Proud by doing\nsomething that is painful day in and day\nout for like 40 years of your life\nyou're probably going to make your\nparents Proud by doing something that\nyou like giving it a hundred percent and\nthen excelling in that field\nthe last thing that I'm going to share\nwith you is that I do think you have\nsome growing to do especially when it\ncomes to study habits\nright so I'm glad that you recognize I\ndon't think you're lazy I think you just\nnever needed to learn how to study and\nthat can be and it's good that you\npicked a field that is very like\nenjoyable to you because that helps some\nbut chances are if you really want to\nexcel like you're going to have to learn\nhow to study\nwhat do you think about that\nyes\nin a way that\nI just look at them and feel overwhelmed\nso I never start anything I'm at that\npace okay okay so that's that so like\nwhen you say handle your time management\nwell how\nso uh I've started uh like right now\nduring the semester I've started like\nmaking tables so for this specific day\nI'm going oh I still do online classes\nby the way I don't have any like in\ncampus classes so\num for this specific day I'm gonna\nfinish this topic this lecture and\nin a few days I will take the quiz but\nlike on this day I have to finish it and\nthen understand so for the next day I'm\ngonna do this subject\nand I think it's working\npretty well it's not all I don't always\nfollow it but I mostly follow it\nokay and when you say it's working\npretty well what does that mean\num\nwell ever since I started doing that I\ndon't feel as overwhelmed as I was\nbefore okay so let's let's do a little\nbit of quick teaching okay that's\nfantastic I'm really happy to hear that\nso you're doing great Eleanor because\nyou figured out a couple of things that\nwill help you break away from The Curse\nOf Being A Gifted kid\nso we're going to talk about the curse\nof being a gifted kid\nso the curse of being a gifted kid is\nknowing what you need to do and always\nin your mind thinking about the what\nI need to be just more disciplined I\nneed to wake up on time I need to get\nbetter at time management\nit's always about what you need to do\ngoals goals goals goals goals\nbut what you're actually what the gifted\nkids miss is the how they don't they\nnever think about the how\nthey don't think about scheduling and\nbreaking things up and like to-do lists\nand like they don't focus on the how\nthey always look at the goal of what\nthey need to accomplish\ndoes that make sense so you're already\ndoing great there\nyes yes the second thing is that gifted\nkids get really easily overwhelmed\nbecause they are used to being able to\nfit everything in their head\nso like when you're growing well when\nyou're like 15 and you've got five\nsubjects or seven subjects to study you\nactually don't need to schedule anything\nbecause in your mind you can hold all\nthe things that you have to do\ndoes that kind of make sense like you\ncan handle it when you're 15. but as you\nget older you can't hold there's too\nmuch stuff to hold in your head and you\ntry to hold it in your head and then you\nend up getting overwhelmed because it's\ntoo much to hold\nright so there's like yes there are kids\nthat are average IQ that have too much\nto carry so they go and they get a\nbackpack\nand they learn how to use a backpack\nwhen they're like 13.\nbut\nwhat some of us do when we're gifted\nkids is we can hold a lot of stuff we've\ngot really huge hands so we never need a\nbackpack and then we're like holding\nmore and more and more stuff and then we\nstart to feel overwhelmed and our brain\ncan't break apart or manage the tasks\nanymore\nso I think it's really great that you're\ndoing scheduling and that it's working\nfor you\nthere's one last thing that I want to\nshare with you which is some interesting\nresearch so a group of researchers\ntried to figure out what kinds of\nthoughts\nso if they if you take kids who are have\ngood grades kids who have medium grades\nand kids who have bad grades and they\ntried to figure out what kind of\nthoughts are in this person's head\nso the first thing that they looked at\nis they they saw a bunch of kids who had\nthis this kind of thought I want to get\nan A\nand that did not correlate very strongly\nwith getting an a so if a kid is\nthinking all the time I want to get an A\nI want to get an A I want to get an A\nthey don't actually study very much and\nthey don't get very good grades you with\nme so far\nthen they looked at another group of\nkids who I need to get an A\nit was very important for them it's not\nsomething that they want it's not a\ndesire it's a need I need to get an A\nbecause I need to bring my GPA up so I\ndon't lose my scholarship\ndoes that make sense like do you\nunderstand that kind of thinking and how\nit's different from the first one\nyes yes it's a need not to want yeah and\ndo you think that leads to higher grades\nthe same grades or lower grades\nhigher yeah that's what one would think\nbut actually leads to the same grades\nis not any better\nokay\nabsolutely the same\nso then they look to the third group of\nkids they asked the kids okay for the\nkids who actually get A's what's in your\nhead and it's really interesting\nthey the kids who get A's in their head\nthey don't think about what they want\nthey don't want an a they don't need an\na what they think about is I'm gonna go\nto the library Wednesday at 3 P.M and\nstudy for an hour\nthey actually don't care about the goal\nthey focus on the how\noh\nso there's there's like data on this\nthat you can look at kids who get good\ngrades and they don't think about what\nthey want or what they need they just\nnot just but the strongest variable that\ncorrelates with good grades is actually\nlike being very specific with scheduling\nI'm going to go to the library Wednesday\nat 3 pm and I'm going to study chemistry\nThursday at 4 pm it's going to be\nphysics Friday morning at 10 A.M is\ngoing to be review for my chemistry test\non Friday afternoon\nokay yep I understand so so this is\nwhat's so tricky is once we get once\nwe're like a gifted kid we develop this\nlike ego or this idea right like oh I\ngotta be this I have to live up to\nexpectations and then we're so to think\nabout this your mind is so busy\nlike every time you sit down to study\nyou can't even think about the studying\nall you're thinking about is I hate this\nall you're thinking about is if I hate\nthis how am I going to get an A if all\nyou're thinking about is if I hate this\nand I can't get an A what am I going to\ntell my parents I'm gonna lose my\nscholarship and then you sit down you\nhave a textbook in front of you and for\none hour you're not actually doing any\nstudying\nyou're not lazy\nhow do you feel at the end of that hour\nyou feel exhausted\nyou're just spending a bunch of energy\ndoing stuff that isn't studying\nand then people think I'm lazy\num\nit definitely do that yep and and so the\nreason you're failing is not because\nyou're stupid not because you're lazy\nit's because your mind is doing a lot of\nwork that isn't schoolwork\nand it's you know like it's that simple\nand so I think the more you can let go\nof what other people want like they can\nbe disappointed in you if they want\nright because something else hopefully\nyou'll learn at some point in your life\nis you can't make someone else happy\nright it's kind of weird simple to say\nit hard to really realize\nand the more that you kind of listen to\nwhat you want and what I love about this\nmore than anything the reason I'm\nactually pretty hopeful for you is like\nbecause you're actually\nyou're scheduling this stuff out and the\nmore that you schedule like the better\nyear that you just show up you do your\nwork for the day and is it are you going\nto get an A a b or a c who the hell\nknows\nbut the kids who get A's are the ones\nwho show up and do the work and that's\nwhat we call
