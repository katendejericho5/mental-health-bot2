    "transcript": "so if we really look at it a key thing\nto understand is that work is quite\nheterogeneous in nature and there may be\nsome tasks that you really enjoy doing\nbut there are other tasks that you\nreally don't like and all of it kind of\nbecomes work and a big part of what I'm\ngoing to share with you all today is how\nto understand those different segments\nof work so that you can optimize and\nactually like become the most productive\nover a long period of time so I want to\ntalk to you all today about something a\nlittle bit different which is why I work\nseven days a week now this may sound\nkind of interesting right because\nnowadays everyone is so concerned about\nburnout everyone's like oh my God I'm\nburning out so much I also know that\nthere's a there's a big kind of\nanti-work movement going on where people\nare sort of emphasizing I should be\nworking less why do I have to work so\nmuch and I think a lot of that is really\nvalid because you know we do have a lot\nof companies and managers and people\nlike that who are really looking to\nextract the most labor out of people but\nwhat I'd love to share with you all\ntoday is a little bit about how I work\nseven days a week why I work seven days\na week and the most shocking part of at\nall is why I really enjoy working seven\ndays a week and how paradoxically\nworking seven days a week actually\ndecreases my burnout and leaves me\nfeeling more energetic than before so I\nknow that sounds kind of shocking\nespecially if you're kind of listening\nthis and you're feeling burnt out all\nthe time and you're sort of struggling a\nlittle bit with like knowing hey I\nshould be working more right you know\nthat there's this like Sigma grind set\nand that people are like yeah like every\nday you work you got to be productive\nyou got to do side hustles all this kind\nof crap and oddly enough I I do work\nseven days a week but I don't consider\nmyself Sigma grind setting and if the\nsigma grind set isn't for you and\nactually you're kind of like lazy and\nsort of like about optimizing your\nworkflow and trying to get the most\nvalue out of the least amount of work\nwhich is actually what I do hopefully\nthis will be a little bit helpful to you\nso let's start off with the way that we\nusually start things here at HG which is\nto understand what work means and\nunderstand a little bit about why work\nis taxing and how work can actually be\ninvigorating so there's a there's a\nfamous kind of quote that people will\nsay which is that if you do what you\nlove you will never work a single day in\nyour life and so there's this big debate\nabout passion versus work you know if\nsomething is your passion people will\nalso say if you turn it into your job\nit's the quickest way to extinguish your\npassion and so there's this tension\nbetween should I do what I love and make\nit my work so that I can work a ton or\nshould I keep my passion separate and\nwork as something like that should be\ncompletely separate from my passion work\nis a price that I pay a sacrifice that I\nmake to be able to support my passions\nand then that in and of itself leads to\nmore frustration as well because then if\nit kind of feels like okay I'm working\nyou know five days a week for this tiny\nsliver of time so what I'd like to do is\nactually step away from all of that crap\nand start with the fundamentals let's\nstart by understanding what is work how\ndoes work drain us how does work\npotentially even invigorate us or what\ninvigorates us at work and as we\nunderstand some of those fundamentals\nI'll share with you all some of my\nexperience about how I set up my work\nweek so that I end up being quite\nproductive and actually working seven\ndays a week and feeling more energetic\nafter all of it so let's start with\ndefining terms so when I say work what I\nmean is something that produces value so\nI don't consider work I mean there are a\nlot of things that people you know I\nthink are work and require effort and\ngain yield but we're talking about\nthings like raising kids doing stuff at\nhome potentially personal development\nstuff but for the sake of this talk I'm\nnot focused on any of that stuff what\nI'm actually talking about is something\nthat produces value in the external\nworld right so it could be like doing\ntasks related to work it could be\ncreative work we'll kind of talk a\nlittle bit about that but it's actually\nstuff that produces value the next thing\nthat I want to kind of point out is that\nnot all work is the same so when we say\nI'm burnt out from work if you really\ntunnel down into it not all the pieces\nof work are actually really what burns\nyou out and this is what where I think\nwe can start to understand this tension\nbetween doing what you love is a passion\nand sort of like how your passion gets\nruined by turning it into your job\nbecause let's say I love playing the\npiano I may love the actual playing the\npiano and teaching students how to play\nthe piano but all the stuff about\nbuilding a website finding clients\nsecuring contracts chasing down people\nwho cancel at the last second all of\nthat stuff Burns me out so if we really\nlook at it a key thing to understand is\nthat work is quite heterogeneous in\nnature and there may be some tasks that\nyou really enjoy doing but there are\nother tasks that you really don't like\nand all of it kind of becomes work and a\nbig part of what I'm going to share with\nyou all today is how to understand those\ndifferent segments of work so that you\ncan optimize and actually like become\nthe most productive over a long period\nof time the next thing that we need to\nunderstand about work is that there are\nsome tasks that are easier to do at\nparticular times I'll give you all like\njust a simple example so I can usually\nteach a room of students at any time\ntime during the day so for example like\nif I see patients from let's say eight\nto six and then I have to teach a\nlecture from six to eight pm I will have\nenough energy to do that if I just walk\ninto the room and there's a group of\nstudents there even if I'm feeling kind\nof tired and I can kind of acknowledge\nthat tiredness something about the\nenjoyment of working with a group of\nstudents at 6 PM like I can still kinda\ndo it on the flip side there are some\nelements of work that actually make you\ntired no matter how energetic you are so\non the flip side of teaching is one of\nthe most draining activities that I have\nwhich is like administrative work or\ndealing with insurance companies and\nwhen 6 PM rolls around I have no energy\nleft and I sure I can teach but if you\nask me oh like Dr K do you want to do\nyour billing paperwork and like write\nletters to insurance companies at 6 pm\non a Friday I'll be like there's no way\nin hell I'm doing that and furthermore\neven if I do that work at like 10 a.m on\na Monday I will feel so drained\nafterwards so the next thing we need to\nunderstand about work is simply that not\nall work is the same and that certain\nkinds of work will drain you more or\ninvigorate you more so here are a couple\nof examples of different kinds of work\nthat I tend to do on the weekend and\nsome of the advantages of that the first\nis creative work so in my experience of\ndoing like creative work and what I sort\nof mean by creative work is like\nideating on lectures maybe thinking\nabout particular things I want to talk\nabout thinking about you know how to how\nto develop educational curriculum\nprogram development like this is all\nkind of creative work sometimes it also\nmeans like actual writing so writing\nfiction or non-fiction or things like\nthat so there's like a certain pile of\ncreative work and what I've sort of\nfound about creative work is that it's\nnot transmissible from day to day I\ncan't do like 14 hours of creative work\non a Monday and have it be the same\nquality as if I do creative work when\nI'm inspired so it's almost like I have\nthis Creative Energy battery like this\nparticular pool of Creative Energy which\nregenerates at a particular rate and I\ncan't if I'm like if I run out of Mana\nwhen it comes to Creative Energy\ngrinding even further sort of yields\nvery like crappy outcomes so sure I\ncould sit down and write 14 lectures in\none day I could technically do that but\nthe quality of the lectures will suck\ninstead if I write like one lecture a\nday I wake up I kind of get excited by\nsomething and I do some amount of work\nand after about an hour I've got an\noutline for a particular lecture and I\nkind of feel like I've used some of that\nenergy and it'll kind of regenerate\nlater so one of the key things that I\ntend to do on the weekends is some\namount of creative work or ideation and\nthis is just the acknowledgment that\nwork isn't perfectly interchangeable so\nif you've got this battery of energy you\ncan sort of use it on a daily basis and\nI don't know if this kind of makes sense\nbut I feel really good about myself when\nI do one hour of creative work on the\nweekends it feels so awesome to be like\nyou know Sunday at 11AM rolls around and\nI've like written a really awesome\nlecture it's something that I want to\nshare with the world it's something that\nI'm really excited about and the cool\nthing is since I did it on a Sunday like\nit's Sunday at 11 A.M and now I feel\nreally great about myself right because\nI was like I was productive today today\nhasn't been an absolute waste not that\nit needs I mean it's okay if it is an\nabsolute waste but I've been productive\nand so one key thing about working every\nday is I try to really like use that\nCreative Energy up because I can't\nalways you know do 15 hours of creative\nwork in a particular day so I find it to\nbe quite efficient the other thing that\nI tend to do uh on the weekends\nespecially but also spaced out is I tend\nto do a lot of my work related reading\non the weekends so I tend to read\nsomewhere between at a minimum 20\nscientific papers a week and what I tend\nto find is that reading a little bit on\nthe weekend like really helps me so I\ndon't mean just like General reading\nright so what I'll do is sort of a\nfocused topic that I get kind of curious\nabout because like on the weekends I\nhave some energy and as I have some\nenergy I tend to get curious about\nthings and what I tend to find is\nespecially when it comes to doing things\nlike reading scientific papers I can\nread five papers a day pretty easily but\nI can't read 35 papers in one day so\nwhat I'll tend to do is a lot of the\nresearch that I need to do okay if there\nare particular topics that I want to\nlook up or like things that I want to\nlearn about that I don't get the time to\ndo during the week because I have all\nthese other random tasks to do that's\nwhen I really think about zeroing on on\nthe weekend and doing a lot of my\nreading now this leads to I think a\nreally important segment which is part\nof the reason I really love working on\nthe weekends or working seven days a\nweek is it allows my brain to do\nsomething that I call mental composting\nso if we look at Neuroscience we know\nthat the way that our brain processes\ninformation is quite complex so a couple\nof things that we know are pretty almost\ncertain of is the first is that ideas\nget Consolidated through sleep so if I\nread let's say five papers or six papers\non a Saturday night my ability to learn\nfrom those papers and use them the next\nweek is way better better if I actually\nlike give myself time to sleep on it so\nif I read five or six papers and then I\nkind of like go to sleep then what\nwhat's pretty cool about that is if I\ntalk about them on Tuesday like I'll be\nable to recall statistics citations\nthings like that so it's like some\namount of energy that I start the\nprocess of composting the next thing\nthat's really cool about that is that\nthat mental process of composting\nactually generates ideas over time so if\nI sit down and let's say try to\nbrainstorm for four hours on a Tuesday\nand I've got emails and meetings and\nstuff like that I don't know if this\nkind of makes sense but it's really hard\nto brainstorm on a Tuesday at 5 00 PM\nwhen you've been in meetings all day if\nI really want to create an environment\nthat's conducive to brainstorming what I\nreally want to do is give my mind time\nto like mull over things and what I've\nreally found is that that mental\ncomposting yields a lot of efficiency if\nI space out my creative work so if I'm\nreading research articles on Saturday\nyou know all I'll kind of remember them\na little bit on Sunday I'll wake up on\nSunday morning I'll be like oh that's\nkind of interesting I I liked this stuff\nfrom what I read let me investigate this\ntangent a little bit more so as I\ninvestigate that tangent a little bit I\nstart to develop some kind of idea and\nthen when Thursday afternoon rolls\naround now remember this is five days\nsince I read the first research paper I\nsit down with with our our content team\nand we're sort of talking about ideas\nand I'll say hey I want to talk about\nthis this and this and then as we bounce\nideas back and forth I've actually done\na lot of the work and so then what\nhappens is like the lecture is sort of\nlike halfway written I can sit down and\nwrite it in one hour because I've done\nthat mental composting and we sort of\nknow this about the human brain as well\nthat we do a lot of our subconscious\nprocessing and connecting of ideas and\npattern generation over time so the\nbizarre thing is that when I work seven\ndays a week I actually find that the\nactual amount of work it takes to\nproduce one thing goes down so if you\nhad to sit me down on a Thursday morning\nmorning and say hey I need you to write\na lecture in in six hours about this\nthing it'll take me six hours to write\nit because I'm not giving my\nsubconscious a chance to play around\nwith that stuff I'm not doing that\ncomposting and so what I've actually\nfound is by working on the weekend I can\ntake a six hour task and actually reduce\nit to three hours and furthermore each\nstep of the way I find incredibly\ngratifying because I want you all to\njust think about this for a second once\nI read something on Saturday I get\ncurious about something let's read\nsomething if I get bored of it I'll set\nit down I'll go do whatever I want on\nSunday I have this like kind of new idea\nI always let me like read about the\nsecond thing so I read about the second\nthing I feel way better about it and now\nI feel pretty good at the end of the\nweekend right because I've like I've\ndone some work and then when Thursday\nrolls around and someone's like hey we\nneed you to write a lecture about this\nor give a talk about this I'm like\nfantastic I can get that done in an hour\nand so that whole process actually like\ninvigorates me because it's like wow\nthis is really fantastic that I'm\ngetting a lot done and it doesn't feel\nlike a whole lot of work the last thing\nabout working on the weekend that I\nthink is really really important is that\nsometimes I enjoy way doing the work\nthat I hate the most on the weekend now\nthis may sound kind of bizarre but I\nwant you all to bear with me for a\nsecond so there's some work that we all\nreally really hate doing and generally\nspeaking when there's work that we hate\ndoing it hangs over our head it sort of\nweighs us down it kind of mentally\nparalyzes us makes us feel kind of\noverwhelmed and I want you all to think\nabout a work week okay so when you think\nabout let's say today's Monday but think\nabout your work week and think about\nlike how much stuff weighs in your mind\nit's like oh crap I have to do this I\nhave to do this I have to do this and on\nSunday night right so Sunday night is\nlike the worst night of the whole week\nand why is that it's because tomorrow is\nMonday and so as you go into the week\noverwhelmed by your least favorite tasks\nbecause those are the things that occupy\nthe most you're already burnt out on\nMonday morning so I want to give you all\nkind of a bizarre scenario imagine that\non Sunday night the least favorite tasks\nthat you have for the coming week were\nactually taking care of how would you\nfeel about waking up on Monday morning\nbecause if you really think about what\nthose tasks are oftentimes they're not\nactually large volume tasks it's not\nlike 15 hours of work right it's usually\nlike little crap that piles up it's like\nI have to fill out an expense report I\nhave to take my car in to get registered\nit's this little crap that weighs on you\nand then when you're actually trying to\ndo your work right because you sort of\nenjoy your work let's say I'm a graphic\ndesigner but on Tuesday I get an email\nfrom HR hey have you done the HR you\nknow phishing training that you're\nsupposed to do that's one hour and\nyou're like oh crap I haven't done it\nit's a waste of time I gotta do it it's\nall so incredibly draining and so one of\nthe things that I really discovered that\nwas really bizarre is I looked at my\nweek and I decided okay what is the\nthing that I hate the most I hate these\nsmall tasks where once again if I do one\nhour of HR training on a Tuesday at 1 pm\nat the end of it I kind of feel tired\nand don't feel like doing the rest of my\nwork anyway and so bizarrely what I've\nactually discovered is is that if I\nreally want to be efficient I want to\nfeel good about it what I'll actually\nbang out is I'll do one hour of stupid\nyou know HR related work or\nadministrative work or the work that I\nreally hate the most I'll do it on a\nSunday and you may ask yourself wait\nwait doesn't that ruin your Sunday and\nactually not really so I do the work and\nthen how do I feel afterward imagine\nSunday at 2PM the stuff that you dread\nthe most about this coming week is\nactually done it's invigorating it's\nactually freeing so now I'm like oh crap\nlike I don't have to actually deal with\nthis crap anymore right like I did it\nand now I get to go into Monday morning\nnot having worried about this stuff so I\nknow it sounds kind of paradoxical but I\nactually find that working seven days a\nweek is actually quite invigorating it\nactually like I feel better about it I\nfeel like I have more energy going into\nMonday morning having done some work on\nSaturday and Sunday the main reason for\nthat is because I've realized that work\nis not homogeneous that there are\ndifferent kinds of work and if I really\nwant to optimize some of my energetic\noutputs if I want to optimize the value\nthat I produce it actually means spacing\nout some work it's sort of really giving\nmyself an opportunity to take advantage\nof my Creative Energy battery and making\nsure that I use some of it every day\nit's also giving my mind a time to like\nmentally compost so that I can start to\ngenerate a lot of ideas and that those\nideas come out cleaner because my\nsubconscious has already played with\nthem that in turn leads to better\noutcomes right so once your ideas are\norganized in your head and you sit down\nand try to produce something out of it\nit ends up being like way cleaner and\nbetter received and the last thing this\nis the most bizarre thing that I\ndiscovered and this was through a lot of\nintrospection is that the tasks that\nactually burn us out if we actually bang\nout even half an hour of them or an hour\nof them on the weekends it can be so\nmentally freeing like it actually it's\nlike the feeling of checking things off\nyour list and now you're going into\nMonday morning and you don't have to\nworry about that stuff because what is\nit that really Burns you out it's having\nto worry about that stuff and then since\nyou're grappling with that crap you\ncan't focus on the work that you\nactually enjoy your creative work takes\na dip and once your creative work takes\na dip that's the reason that you're\nactually there then you're not producing\nat the level that you really want to and\nas you're not producing at the level\nthat you really want to you get\nincreasingly frustrated and that sort of\nleads to burnout so I know it's quite\nparadoxical but one of the things that\nI've really discovered is that working\nseven days a week not only reduces my\nburnout it actually makes me like more\nproductive and makes me feel more\ninvigorated and also frees me up during\nthe week to focus on the tasks that I\nreally want to at work so I hope that's\nbeen a little bit helpful I know it's\nkind of bizarre it certainly isn't what\nI would call the sigma grind set but I'd\nencourage you all to think a little bit\nabout the heterogeneity of work and\nreally think about how to optimize your\nown Creative Energy if you found this\nvideo helpful check out Dr K's guide\nwe've spent hundreds of hours writing\nand filming to help people understand\ntheir mind so that they can build lives\nthat they want so check out the link in\nthe description below"
