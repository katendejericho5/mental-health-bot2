    "transcript": "my name is Matt\nokay pleasure to meet you thank you a\nlittle bit about what online dating is\nlike for you you know when I first\nstarted\nyou know I had had kind of just too much\ntime to really think about or like I\nguess overthink about a lot of things in\nlife and\num I also had very low self-esteem to be\nhonest so yeah I don't know I just kind\nof spent six months going from like one\ndating app to the next you know trying\ndifferent things and\nyou know how it kind of started going\nthough is um\nyou know I would really try to\nkind of craft these like perfect\nmessages like these perfect openers\num you know which is always a very big\nstruggle with dating apps is like trying\nto figure out how you want to present\nyourself at first but you know for me\nyeah it was I was very much overthinking\nit\num\nand you know I was also trying to kind\nof figure out like what parts of my\npersonality to hide\num which was not good obviously and you\nknow I realized that in retrospect but I\nthink when you're first getting started\nwith that you know you get a lot of\nrejection and you're trying to figure\nout why and you're like trying to look\nfor those reasons and like okay what do\nI need to fix for next time you know so\nI don't get rejected and then how it\nkind of turned out though is you know I\nwould get to the first date\num and I would still try to kind of\nmaintain that mask you know or like that\nthat kind of character I created you\nknow over text\num this like you know kind of refined\nversion I guess\nand so you know I would try to come off\nas like very like funny and\nknowledgeable and like charismatic and\nyou know all these things and like I was\nso nervous about like letting the\nconversation die down and you know all\nthese things and like\nyou know it really became kind of a\nproblem though because you know I I\nwould never risk like actually flirting\nwith the person you know like I would\nyou know I I wouldn't tell jokes you\nknow because I was so afraid they might\nnot land or like I might offend them or\nlike something like that it's like you\nknow I was never actually flirting or\nanything and you know it's just kind of\ndisastrous\num you know and I I did that uh about\nsix times I had like six first dates and\nyeah it was very difficult\nso yeah so I mean you're SP you almost\nsound like you're speaking in the past\ntense so are you flirting with people on\ndates now\num so\nI guess to run through the story really\nquickly so after for you know a lot of\nthose dates I did you know finally meet\nsomebody\num that like I had a lot more oh\nactually sorry let me back up really\nquick so\nyou know after like six months of doing\nthis I mean I was just exhausted I was\nso exhausted at like trying to figure\nout what I was doing wrong like trying\nto can I jump in with a couple questions\nactually\noh yeah so when you say doing this what\ndoes doing this consist of can you help\nme understand like what was your like\nwhat what like if I was like\nfollowing you around like what would I\nsee on a weekly basis or daily basis\nI would say so like work was at a big\nlike lull at the time so I just had\nloads of free time and you know I spent\nit you know doing some Hobbies but like\na lot of it was just you know going from\nlike\nyou know you know I'd probably spend 30\nminutes an hour a day just like popping\nfrom one dating app to the next like you\nknow going through my matches like\ntrying to message people\num and again just like really trying to\nobserve like okay like what am I doing\nright like what am I doing wrong you\nknow why isn't this working why am I\ngetting rejected and like I never really\ntook the time to think about like and\nyou know\nmaybe it's just the wrong match whatever\nwell so so so and what kind of answers\nwould you come up with in your head when\nyou would ask yourself like what am I\ndoing wrong why am I getting rejected\nwhat what conclusions did you come to\nI think part of it was physical\nappearance I was pretty\nyeah I mean again I was coming from a\nplace of very low self-esteem and\neverything but\num as well as just like not being able\nto\nI think like effectively communicate\nwith people and what um what were you\ntrying to do in communication\nthat's a good question I mean just\nI mean I think at the time I was kind of\njust desperate and like looking for\nreally any kind of\nyou know connection really like well\nhe's really kind of just looking for\nwhatever I could get and yeah okay so so\nit looked like you were feeling\ndesperate and then you also mentioned\nyou would try to like craft the perfect\nopener\nright so like thinking about and and\nwhat what would you what kind of\nconclusions did you kind of originally\ncome to I recognize that you may have\nlearned differently but when you were\ntrying what did you think were the\ncomponents of an uh perfect opener\num I would have to say like it couldn't\nbe lazy like I had to express like\ninterest it had to show that like oh I'm\nfunny and like you know interesting and\nlike you know I read your bio so like\nI'm not just you know messaging like 20\ndifferent people and like you know I was\ntrying to express like kind of like a\ndistinct interest for you know this one\nperson okay so you would like do like\nyou would go through the bio and you'd\nlike craft this message that had to be\nspecific it sounds like and then you\nsaid try to be funny so can you give me\nan example of like how that would what\nthat looks like that's a good okay if\nnot that's okay yeah that's totally fine\nI mean I realized that it you know this\nwas going on for months for like half an\nhour a day but\num yeah trying to be funny which almost\nnever works right\nyou know you can be funny or not be\nfunny but trying almost never works and\nthen and so then I'm sorry I had\ninterrupted you you were sort of\num and then you also mentioned that you\nwent on six First Dates can you tell us\na little bit about what those were like\nI mean yeah I mean it was you know\nobviously very nerve-wracking because\nyou're just meeting this totally random\nperson that you've you know\nyou've never been in a room with them so\nit's like you very much have like their\nkind of online version you know that\nyou've been communicating with so far\nso you know oftentimes you get to the\nyou know like wherever you guys are\nmeeting or you know wherever I'm meeting\nand you know you see them and you're\nlike oh well they're they're a bit\ndifferent than I was expecting but like\nyou know that could be a good or bad\nthing\num and yeah I mean it half the time it\nreally just kind of fell apart you know\nto be honest was was falling apart look\nlike\nlike\njust I mean like right now I feel like\nI'm kind of stumbling through this\nconversation and it's like that to like\nyou know a higher degree like even you\nknow significantly worse so just a lot\nof stumbling you know again like just no\nflirting like whatsoever like no actual\nflirting like just playing everything\nlike super super super safe\nyou know like that kind of thing if that\nmakes sense it it sort of makes sense I\nI didn't get the impression you were\nstumbling through this conversation\nthough\nI thought you've given me good answers\nto every question that I've asked except\nfor one which is can you give me an\nexample of an opening statement which\nlike I totally understand like you\nhaven't memorized them right from like\nsix months ago so I think it's a\nreasonable thing to not be able to come\nup with\nyeah I exactly I've no idea what it was\nsaying back then but yeah no it was\nexciting no it was a lot of stumbling\nand and you know just playing things\nlike too safe and you know trying to put\noff like trying to maintain this mask in\nlike such a nerve-wracking situation\nthat like I just couldn't and like\nI I don't know okay I mean I guess it's\npossible maybe they didn't see it that\nway but\ncan you tell me a little bit about this\nis very enlightening for me Matt so\nfirst of all I want to say thank you I I\nrecognize that you know you mentioned\nyourself like I this is pure gold from\nmy my standpoint is it okay if I ask you\na couple other questions\noh please yeah so so what like can you\nhelp me understand what was the mask\nthat you were trying to put on like what\nwere you trying to be during those dates\nthat felt like it was really hard to\naccomplish I guess if I were to put it\nas simply as I could I was trying to\nmake myself into as close as I could get\nto like I don't know like\nuh like uh Hollywood you know like very\nstereotypical like masculine you know\nman like again like very charismatic\nlike stands up straight like can\nyou know tell me about all the other\nthings you're a very interesting person\ntell me about all the other things that\nyou can like what is it tell me about\nthe Hollywood man I love that I love\nthat image what is uh what else does a\nHollywood man do\num I would say they can crack you know\nperfect jokes you know whenever whenever\nthere's an opportunity\num I would say\nyou know they're chivalrous and you know\neverything like that they don't stumble\non words they don't you know they\nthey're very very effective\ncommunicators\num\nand\nyeah I mean just again like very\ncharismatic very\nyou know all of those kind of\nstereotypical images that you know\nthings that\nin many ways I am not or you know if I\nam it just takes me a while to get to\nthat you know with somebody so what I I\ntake a while to warm up totally\nunderstand dude so tell me what what\ndoes being charismatic look like I I\nthink you know I think a lot of it\nreally does just kind of censor around\nspeech you know and how effectively you\ncan communicate and like\nyou know it's kind of the difference\nbetween you know you're in the shower\nand like thoughts are just flowing so\neasily and like you know you know like\nthat version of yourself versus when you\nactually got get out of the world and\nyou're super nervous and like you know\nit's a big difference or like if you're\nin like an argument with somebody you\nknow it's like that kind of Separation I\nwould say it makes perfect you know so\nlike\nyeah so so like like you know I I love\nthe example of shower thoughts right\nbecause everything makes so much sense\nin the shower did you ever consider\nasking someone out on a first date and\nshower together so that you could be\nyour perfect self\nthat no that that's a great that is a\ngreat idea though I totally wish I\nthought of that you know maybe next time\nbecause uh still looking for a next date\nanyway so so thank you so much Matt I\nthought that was incredibly incredibly\nhelpful in terms of illustrating like\nwhat the experience of going through\nthis dating stuff is like right so\nyou're like trying really hard and then\nthese charismatic Hollywood types are\nalso like natural right that's a big\npart of it yeah they don't stumble\nthrough their words the words come out\nclearly they're relaxed they're\nconfident but the harder that you are\nyou try to do those things\nlike the less of the Hollywood man you\nbecome\nright exactly after doing that for about\nsix months I was just absolutely\nexhausted you know it's very\nemotionally kind of draining to do this\nand continually get rejected and then be\nlike and then kind of beat yourself up\nyou're like oh my God like I wasn't I\nwasn't the Hollywood man this time like\nI need to do it next time and like after\na while like you just can't you just\ncan't keep doing it so I mean you know I\nwas about to delete all the apps\nhonestly I was just about to give up I\nwas like I'll just find somebody\neventually in real life hopefully maybe\nnot but\num but anyway so you know I match\num with my now X and you know the only\nthing on her profile is like mentioning\noh I like play League of Legends and I'm\nlike oh okay cool and like so the big\nchange for me I guess was you know in my\nopening message I was just like oh cool\nlike you know what champ do you play you\nknow like I play league two and like she\ntells me and like it it's pretty much\njust you know easy from there and you\nknow she actually asked me out on a\nfirst date and like we get there and you\nknow it just it's like I finally found\nsomebody that I could communicate easily\nwith you know\nand the you know the whole conversation\nwent great I remember coming home and\nlike texting a friend I'm like I don't\nknow if we're gonna end up dating but\nlike we're definitely gonna be like\nlifelong friends you know so it was you\nknow it was amazing\num\nbut\nokay so I don't want to kind of diverge\nfrom the kind of main topics too much\nbut essentially you know we had to break\nit off for reasons neither of us really\nwanted\num you know like probably five months\nago now\num and you know we kind of dragged\nthings out had some communication issues\num the whole thing was you know as I\nkind of would put it kind of world\nshattering to be honest\nyou know like I I really had kind of a\nbig breakdown of\num I would have to say like my\npersonality you know to be honest like I\nreally kind of lost track of like who I\nam and you know the things I find\nimportant and you know the the word I I\ndon't know the you know exact definition\nor anything but the word codependency\ndoes come to mind and like I do think\nthere were some\nsome uh issues with\nyou know how\nI think I was using her to cope with a\nlot of my own kind of life problems and\nlike as a distraction\nand I guess I should say that too like I\nthink as a whole a lot of this online\ndating in my experience you know was a\ndistraction from actually getting my\nlife together wow so once yeah so once I\nwas once we kind of broke up I was kind\nof plunged back into it and you know\nkind of left scrambling and like I\ndidn't really feel like I had people to\nyou know go to you know enough even\nthough that wasn't true I have a great\nfriend group but you know I felt very\nalone sure no I didn't have that person\nI could just text it in the middle of\nthe night saying like hey I'm feeling\nkind of depressed and\nyou know she would like talk to me about\nit you know so\nyeah and then you know now I'm kind of\nat a place where I am back to online\ndating but you know I've\nfar reduced the number of apps that I'm\nusing you know I've realized that it's\ngood to just kind of slow burn in my\nexperience okay\num\nlike not put too much attention to it\nand\nyou know I've also realized it's best to\nyou know not force connections\num to not take things too personally\num to be too impatient you know to dump\nall my heart into it like just pour my\nheart into you know this one thing that\nI want and also just having like kind of\nan appreciation for you know just\nforming General connections with women\nlike it doesn't need to be like oh we're\nyou know looking to get married and like\nthere's all the pressure of that like\nsometimes it's best to just kind of be\nlike hey like what's up you know like\nyou're going to chat for a while like\nwhat are you interested in like just\ntake it very slow casual and easy and\nyeah and just kind of appreciate that\nyou know sometimes it just leads into a\nfriendship maybe it just leads into like\na nice little you know two-week\nconversation with somebody that you\nwould would have never met before and\nyou know like you can kind of just go\nyour separate ways\nyou know eventually so\nwow so I'm I'm hearing that you're\nreally learning to just appreciate even\nthe person for who they are and like\neven if it doesn't end up in a date like\nyou can still have some this is the\nfirst time I've ever heard this so it's\nkind of blowing my mind but you can talk\nto someone on the internet on a dating\napp and then that conversation in and of\nitself can have value and also be like\nsufficient\nexactly that's wild and you could yeah\nand and but I mean\nso so but it sounds like you're not like\ntrying to optimize everything\nexactly yeah so like now you know I feel\nlike you know my bio like my dating bio\nis just very\nit feels a lot more like myself like I'm\nnot trying to\nlike I'm not trying to do a Hollywood\nman thing anymore like I'm just kind of\nlike yeah you know like I like 3D\nprinting and I like movies and I like\ncooking and you know just like I wanted\nto put like 3D printing on there before\nbecause I would have been like oh man\ngirls find that too nerdy you know stuff\nlike that but it's like then you're\ncutting off you know those connections\nwith you know maybe there's a girl out\nthere that does like 3D printing you\nknow and and how awesome would that yeah\nso\nexactly no exactly so let me ask you\nkind of a tough question so do you have\na sense though whether like\nthis is actually like do you think is\nthis working better though than than\nbeing like paranoid and trying to be\nsomething perfect and and like you know\ncrafting these like opening lines\nyeah\num\nfirst of all I think it's a lot better\nfor my mental health okay far far better\num\nbut I also think that it just has a\nhigher chance of finding meaningful\nconnections\nand I I would say I've I have found it\nto work better like\nyou know I've been back on dating apps\nfor you know a couple months now after\nthe breakup and like I haven't been on\nany like actual first dates like I have\nmet um you know a friend I made but you\nknow like I haven't been on any first\ndates but like I'm very kind of okay\nwith that right now you know like I I\nyou know I I think if I continue to put\noff that that image you know that\nHollywood man thing like I could have\nprobably found more first dates but I\ndon't think they would have led anywhere\nso it's like what's the point that's so\ninteresting it makes me really wonder\nabout\nyou know everyone like if the end point\nthey're looking for is like going on the\nfirst date which actually I wonder if\nthat sets them up for failure in terms\nof building a relationship\nI I think so I definitely think so\ninteresting so it may be that there's a\nstrategy that has fewer dates but more\nrelationships or more dates and\npotentially fewer relationships\nyeah I I think so\nyou know and I think a lot of it is just\nhow\nhow much you and oh my God let me tell\nyou too I I remember hearing people say\nlike oh just be yourself you know when I\nwas first starting to date\nand like\nthat that's such difficult advice to\nreally\nI guess break down because it is true\nand like once you kind of learn that and\nlike have been through it and kind of\nunderstand truly what that is and like\nwhat that means then it's like oh yeah\nlike I can do that now but you know\nhearing that early on is is very\ndifficult but so so yeah what would you\nsay is hard why is that advice hard to\nimplement\nlike what have you learned now that was\nkind of hard to do before\nI was happy\nyou know again it it really is just what\nkind of connections are you looking for\nand like realizing also that you know\nyou can't you can't maintain it like at\nleast in you know my experience I\ncouldn't maintain that mask\num in such a high pressure situation and\nlike even if I could that would be\nreally that's bad like you you're being\ndishonest you know it you know to the\nother person about who you are and and\nthings so\nI don't know it's it to me it feels very\nmuch like something\nyou just kind of have to get out there\nand\nexperience it and kind of go through\nsome trial and error and you know\neventually I think kind of the natural\nconclusion is that but it's hard to\nreach until you've been through a lot of\nthose experiences\nokay of course so I think there's\nthere's a lot that you've kind of\nlearned can I um did you share kind of\nwhat you were uh thinking about sharing\ntoday were there particular things that\nwe didn't really talk about that you\nwanted to talk about\num yeah I mean I I think that about\ncovers it I mean you know obviously I've\nlearned I've learned so much from this\nwhole thing to be honest like I could\ntrust me like I could go on for days\nwithout all the things I've learned but\nyou know I think that about covers it do\nyou want anything come to mind in terms\nof like like picking one or two things\nthat you really wish you had known when\nyou started out\num\noh uh yeah so another thing I would say\nis that it's important to try to\nunderstand how these I think these\ndating app algorithms kind of operate\nand understand that like when you first\nsign up to one they you know tend to\nkind of flood you with matches and like\nyou know they basically promote your\nprofile to a lot of people so you're\nlike way more likely to get that and it\nkind of gets you hooked on it you know\nlike At first you're like oh my God like\nI'm you know this is amazing and then\nthey just\nyou know like after a few days or\nwhatever they just stop you know and you\nknow then they start you know giving you\nads about like hey like if you sign up\nfor our premium you know a membership\nthen you know we'll promote your profile\nagain and like stuff like that and you\nknow I I think it's it's very important\nto understand that like you probably\ndidn't change anything like it's just\nhow these algorithms work like it's not\nyour\nI don't know maybe you changed the photo\nlike one photo like it's probably not\nthat that's like putting off everybody\nthat sees it or whatever and\nyou know I hope that kind of makes sense\nbut yeah it makes a lot of sense it is\nimportant so Matt let me just um see if\nI can try to like summarize what what I\nheard from you and then you you know let\nus know if if we're missing stuff or so\nthe first thing is that you were sort of\nin a in a little bit of a dark spot when\nyou started dating and actually a quick\nquestion uh you said that you're you've\ncut back on the apps that you use are\nthere particular apps that you think are\nbetter than others\nabsolutely yeah which which are the good\nones\num so in my experience really the\nstandout is Bumble okay um and and in\nthat one you know the the uh woman\num you know reaches out first okay\num and I think it just kind of creates\nan environment of kind of safety for\neverybody and it's just a little less\npressure and\nyou know I that one's really kind of my\nstandout personally okay and and which\nones is there one in particular that you\nthink is like should be avoided at all\ncosts\njust wondering\nI mean there are but it would be kind of\nhard to think of what they all are okay\nlet me let me say that there's a lot\nyeah okay okay so you you find Bumble\nsort of creates a safe space and as you\nknow\nmaybe leads to a more natural\ncommunication\nyeah I would say so okay so just to kind\nof recap\num you know your experience on dating\nwebsites has been or apps has been like\nso you finished school you are not\nreally in the best headspace at the time\nyou also had a lot of time so it sounded\nlike you you took the dating thing like\npretty seriously in terms of like a Time\ninvestment maybe half an hour to an hour\nper day\nuh using many apps and then also like a\nlot of like optimization grinding\nthinking about it even maybe outside of\nthe hour like you're thinking about it\nbefore and after and what should you say\nand things like that and so so it was\nalmost like you were trying to figure\nout okay this is a puzzle that needs to\nbe solved and if I spend enough time at\nit and if I spend enough like it's like\na numbers game and I gotta grind and\nlike optimize and if I can you know say\nsomething that is specific about their\nprofile is funny and if I sort of try to\nlike I'm gonna try to figure out how to\nlive up to this Hollywood man kind of\nidea\nyeah you spent a lot of energy into that\num you know you're you're trying to as\nyou put it stand up straight\nright and you can crack the perfect joke\nat the right opportunity to be like kind\nof chivalrous but like maybe not too\nchivalrous like you don't want to be a\nnice guy right you're never like\nstumbling\nyou're a bit risque you're like\ncharismatic like people notice when you\nwalk in the room they notice when you\nopen your mouth like like people are\nkind of looking at you and like\nappreciating you and respecting you and\nand all that kind of good stuff\nbut in trying to do all of that it was\nincredibly nerve-wracking incredibly\nlike cognitively intense\nand since you're you're like trying to\nit's almost like you're I don't know how\nto say this but you're like hosting a\nserver\nwhile you're trying to play a game\nright where you've got this like server\nwhere there's like all these\ninteractions going on that are not the\nreal you and it feels actually quite\nunnatural\num conversations become very very forced\nyou're kind of stumbling a lot a lot of\nlike First Dates because maybe you were\nlike oh look at me I'm so handsome but\nthen when when you show up you end up\nkind of disappointing and then that\nleads to like this sense of like oh my\nGod like I'm a loser I can't do it I\nhave to be more like Chad like and I\ncan't be Chad like I'm I'm Matt\nunfortunately\nand and then you ended up it sounds like\nwhat I'm gonna say this but what what\nreally turned things around for you is\nmatching with a girl who plays LOL\nyeah and then just at the right time too\nyou know what I've just kind of all but\ngiven up yep and and so Along Came this\ngirl who plays League of Legends and\nallowed you to be a little bit more\nnatural allowed you to like you know\nshut down that that server that you're\nhosting and really focus on playing the\ngame y'all entered into a relationship\nwith which sounds like maybe y'all\nweren't really ready to be in a\nrelationship even though you liked each\nother a lot and were a good match\nwhich I think I think that's a good way\nof putting it which is which I think is\nalso really instructive because you hear\na lot of this stuff where people are\nlike work on yourself right\nand then people get really confused\nbecause they're like okay if I work on\nmyself like how am I going to meet\npeople\nbut I I think as you kind of mentioned\nlike you weren't really in a place\nto engage in a relationship and what\ndoes that look like\nI think sometimes that can look like\nusing your partner to fit particular\nneeds that you have that are not really\nrelationship needs\nso if I'm lonely\nand the only person I have in my life is\nmy partner like is that is that a\ncertain antidote to loneliness sure but\nthey can't be my entire Social Circle\nbecause if I make them my entire Social\nCircle it'll be smothering\nright and and so it sounds like y'all\nwere just you look like you're about to\nsay something you want to chime in\noh no I was just saying uh no I think\nyou're nailing it honestly\nyeah and God\noh and you know a lot of these\nrealizations you know did come you know\nafterwards as well I'll kind of ADD\nyeah of course and and so it sounds like\ny'all were really a little bit\ncodependent and and maybe both you all\nwere neglecting other parts of your life\nand I think unfortunately you can have\nthe perfect match\nbut uh you know when people say love\nconquers all like\nit's sort of but a Love or a\nrelationship I don't think can be a\nsubstitute\nfor other parts of your life not going\nwell\nand so yeah it sounds like you all sort\nof amicably broke up\nyeah yeah I think we kind of realized\nyou know it was more detrimental to the\nthings we needed to get done in life and\nyou know taking care of ourselves and\nyeah have to break it off unfortunately\nhow very mature of you Matt\noh thank you\num and and so then now what you've kind\nof learned is that\nso first of all it sounds like you're\naware that you are worthy of Love Yes or\nstill no\ngetting there I'm getting there nice\nhonest answer man yeah so so I think\nthat's that's actually really healthy\nright so like what I'm hearing is that\nsome of the self-esteem issues some of\nthe concerns still linger\nbut now first of all like I love kind of\nwhere you are now so you're focusing on\nparticular apps as opposed to others\nyou're focusing on a slow burn as you\nput it to not be impatient and also to\nlike not take things personally which I\nthink is huge which is that you know if\nsomeone doesn't respond to you in a day\nor two it doesn't mean that there's\nsomething wrong with you because when\nyou're trying to optimize you're like oh\nmy God what if I said something else\ncould I control this person's Behavior\ncould I elicit more responses by\nchanging the way that I communicate with\nthem\num and and really just appreciating the\npeople for who they are and and like\neven if things don't turn into a date\nlike that's okay and better to sort of\nhave an honest conversation where you\nkind of don't waste your time on on\ndating\nand and that's really wild like you know\nbecause it's it's it's really it really\nsounds Wild\nyeah\nbut I mean it it sounds like you're also\ntaking care of the other stuff in your\nlife that really needs to be taken care\nof\nyeah definitely you know after\num you know very luckily I uh got into\ntherapy like right as we were about to\nbreak up so you know I and you know it's\nit's funny too because I started therapy\nthinking you know really I think kind of\na big reason for it was to handle the\nbreakup but you know as it turns out I I\nwasn't ready for a lot of other things\nin my life like I you know had a lot of\nother things to work on and\nyou know what I'm yeah awesome dude well\nlisten Matt I'm I'm really optimistic\nfor you like\num you know it sounds like you're\napproaching this in a really like\nhealthy way like you've come away with\nsome like good lessons and you're kind\nof working on yourself and really being\na little bit more honest with the\ninternet about who you are\nand also through the work that you're\ndoing offering up like a better version\nof Matt because you tried the the\nscuffed version\nand and you know you need a little bit\nof Polish and like that's okay I think\nthat that's not doesn't mean that you're\nyou know like I think like working on\nyour esteem in a very like reasonable\nand healthy way\nyeah yeah\nany I appreciate all that yeah I mean I\nappreciate I I mean I thought you did\nsuch a good job of sharing your journey\nwith us thank you\nany last uh thoughts or questions I I\ndon't really have\nI I thought you were actually very good\nhuh\nI I was saying I think that's about it I\nalso do have uh therapy starting in like\nliterally like three minutes okay well I\ndo have to kind of get going oh well\nperfect dude perfect timing all right\ntake care buddy\nthank you you too have a good one\nhello\nhello okay let me just close the stream\nreal quick\nthere it is there we go\nwhat's your name my friend\nuh my name is Carlos\nand um can you tell us a little bit\nCarlos about what online dating has been\nlike for you\nuh it's not been great honestly\num\nso for context I'm in my early 30s okay\nnever been in any kind of uh romantic\nrelationship\nand uh I think I've been\ngetting on and off online dating for\nlike since dinner was around maybe the\nfirst years\nso I had to say like\num how many years is that\nlike nine years okay maybe\nokay\nand I tried a few\nthe apps like uh did you say you haven't\nbeen in a relationship\nI've never been okay okay\nup to now yeah\nokay yeah keep going please\nso yeah um I I tried a few apps like uh\nTinder bamboo match.com you name it um\nand I've never had like actual success\nin any of the applications\nbut I think when things started getting\num maybe like complicated or started I\nstarted developing\na new healthy relationship with the\napplication was probably in the last\nfour years\nwhen I got on this cycle language\nI felt lonely downloaded Tinder\num\ntry to do some swipes and uh without a\nlot of success\nand uh after that\nit eventually gets to me uh this feeling\nof inadequacy that that I won't ever be\nable to\nmake things work so I get very\ndepressed to say a word and uh and I get\nup the application\nand I stay up the application for a few\nmonths and then\nuh the loneliness or worried on kind of\nkicks in again and like get on the\napplications again\num the cycled repeats and that probably\nlasted for about three four years and\ninterestingly enough what broke the\ncycle was when I actually made a\nconnection with a girl and she was very\nmuch into me and\nshe pushed really hard to make things\nwork and uh\nthat made me panic a little bit and I\nended up like pushing her away\num\nso that kind of made me realize that\nI was probably not ready for a\nrelationship on one hand and on the\nother that I was using the application\nthese applications to kind of\nreinforce this idea that I\nwas not good enough for a relationship\nso to speak\num\nso that's\nI kind of realized this and I decided\nnot to go again on the applications I've\nbeen I think of them\nfor like a year after this interaction\nand I recently deleted my profiles\nmaybe a couple weeks ago because I kind\nof got it in a relationship\nso I didn't want those profiles to cause\nany issues so I deleted them\nwait so so um this was not the person\nthat you pushed away\nno she was not um\nand that experience made me feel bad\nbecause this girl was very\nclear with what she wanted and she was\nvery assertive and she gave a lot from\nher to make things work\nand I wasn't able to like open up to her\nand tell her that I wasn't feeling that\nmuch into it so at some point she told\nme like\nthe things were not working for her that\nshe wanted to\nbreak it up so to speak\num\nwait so I'm a little bit confused so it\nsounded like after you went off oh sorry\nsorry you started dating someone and\nthen you uninstalled the apps\nyeah that was recently and and are you\nstill dating that person\nI don't know\nokay so it's it's rough at the moment\nyeah it's rough at the moment but did\nyou is that someone that you met on the\napps\nno no\num so just to clarify this girl that I\nwas talking about that I met in the app\nthat was like one year ago yeah right so\nthat because it seems like two different\npeople so I'm just trying to yeah yeah\nit's two different people and the girl\nthat I was dating actually was a friend\nof mine and we've been friends for like\n15 years oh boy\nyeah but it sounds like it's kind of\ncomplicated\nit's complicated yeah there's too many\nlayers to it okay\nso can I um was there something else\nthat you like uh or did you want to say\nmore Carlos\nI think that's uh that sums up like my\nexperience with dating apps sure can I\ncan I ask some questions\nof course okay\nso it sounds like you you started with\nTinder early\nlike oh yeah back before it was cool\nbut it's a\nyeah when it was cool let's say like the\nmedia was talking about it and it seemed\nlike a easy way to\ntry to solve this problem right this\nloneliness that I had but what ends up\nended up happening is that this Tinder\nbecame like uh more of a hookup app so\npeople were it's very superficial I I\nthink\nso people are not many times or\nlooking for a committed relationship yep\num I'm looking for something more real\nthough\nwhen Tinder becomes this thing on which\npeople are just looking for something\nvery superficial I think\nit never worked for me it hasn't worked\nfor me I see and and so for the first\nfive years that you were using Tinder\nyou mentioned that like you know later\nit got kind of like into this toxic\ncycle but for the first five years what\nwas your experience like\num\nit wasn't really remarkable\nbasically I just uh\nmade the profile I read all of the tips\nthat they gave you so\nuh you were talking before uh this\nopening lines and profiles and all that\nstuff I read it I tried to do it but I\ndidn't also want to put too much effort\ninto it\num because I also don't like to present\nmyself as someone that I'm not\nokay so if I'm going to meet someone I\nexpect that person to like me for who I\nam and not because I'm not for something\nthat I'm not\nand then\nin the first few years I mean were you\ndating people on the app and things\ndidn't work out or what was your or were\nyou not like\nbecause I think there's like matching\nand then you know you'll talk to people\nonline and then sometimes you'll go on\ndate sometimes they'll turn into hookups\nsometimes they'll turn into\nrelationships what was your experience\nlike for the first few years\nI've never gone into a date with anyone\nfrom online dating basically okay and\nwhat's your understanding of\nhow that's happened\num it's a variety of things\nuh for me I think it's very difficult to\nto build some connection or on text only\nOkay so\nI also feel that there's like an\nexpectation to\nfor the man to be the one who like\ndrives things forward and uh\nI I find that very like discouraging\nbecause I'm kind of expecting if we're\ntwo people that are supposed to be\nsomewhat interested in each other\nI see I'm expecting it to to like build\nthis together right but it seems like\nthe expectation is that I had to\nentertain\ngot it so for me it's very difficult to\nbuild those connections over text and\nwhen it finally happens I discovered\nthat my\nfear of intimacy kicks in\nso I have like maybe two three people\nthat have been actually interested in\ngoing out with me but I kind of panic\nand don't know what to do so I just\nleave it there\nokay so now Carlos I'm hearing like a\ncouple of different things can I just\nthink for a second\nof course\nis it okay that I'm asking you these\nquestions\nyes yes it is okay\nso the first thing that I kind of want\nto comment on is that first of all like\nyour look it sounds like you're looking\nfor like a real relationship like a\npartnership\nright\num so so and and so the the first kind\nof challenge is that there's this\ndiscrepancy between what you're looking\nfor and what the expectation is\nso the expectation sounds like that the\nman leads and what you're really looking\nfor is like a partnership where like\nboth people are interested each other\nand both people drive the conversation\nforward\nright and so if someone is expecting you\nto take the lead it sounds like you\ndon't really play that game very well\nthat's right and it feels somewhat\ninauthentic or unfair to you\nyeah it does does it feel both of those\nthings are one more than the other or\nwhat\nI think it's more the last one it kind\nof bothers me that I have to\nI mean yeah it feels unfair the\nrelationship at the end yeah it goes\nunfair okay\nand then\nthen it sounds like but there are some\nsome people who who've expressed\ninterest in you and and when they\nso like it sounds like when they\nactually like start\nyou know\nI don't know how to say it's trying to\nmove the relationship forward you you\nsaid something about panic and fear of\nintimacy\nright can you tell me about that\num yeah so for example there was one\nconnection that I\nhad like\nmaybe three four years ago\num\nso the conversation was going well we\ntook it from the application to another\nmessaging application of the dating app\nuh the conversation was really going\nwell\nbut then the girl I think told me she\nwanted to meet me and uh\nI don't know there's there's this like\nvery\nstrong feeling of of fear or I don't\nknow it's it's hard to describe but\nI wasn't like very sure what to do and\num\nthat particular time\nI just\nbecome a little less responsive on the\non a conversation I didn't cut\ncommunication\nbut she ended up like getting tired and\neventually lost at me like I tried to\nreach out and she didn't respond\nso I\nhow do you understand that and how do\nyou feel about that\num\nI understand it like\nuh women\nnaturally don't want to waste their time\nwith someone that's not showing interest\n100 so\num I didn't I don't feel resentful for\nthat kind of interactions because at the\nend I know that's kind of for me and\nthat there's things that I have to work\non\nhmm\nso yeah and\nokay\nand what do you what do you think it is\nthat you have to work on\nit's I have very\ncaring\nexperiences regarding dating a love life\nbecause of all of it it's very hard for\nme to open up uh\nso yeah I mean\nI I feared rejection a lot\ninteresting and even though even though\nthey\nshow interest I have this fear that they\nwill leave that they realize maybe they\ndidn't like me as much and that\nconnection so I even though I'm longing\nfor this a romantic relationship I\nend up sabotaging a lot of a lot of it\nso I think that's very insightful\num I'm just gonna point out to you that\nit's kind of tricky right because on the\none hand it sounds like you're looking\nfor\nsomeone else to be an equal partner\nand that you find it frustrating that\nmen are expected to take the lead\nbut right when the people that express\ninterest in you and and sort of share\nthat responsibility and y'all are like\ntalking back and forth right and instead\nof I mean it sort of sounds like and\nthen if a woman asks you out you kind of\nretreat so it's like on the one hand if\nyou're taking the lead that's sort of\nunfair but on the other hand if they're\ntaking the lead or even share the lead\nwith you it sounds like it kind of\ntriggers this Panic response\nright\nthat's how it's tough dude\nit has been really tough yeah\nbecause it's sort of like when they give\nyou what you want you kind of pull away\nyeah\nhow do you understand that or what do\nyou think about that\nI think I'm still processing it and uh\nthe relationship\nthat it was kind of in\nrecently kind of helped me\nunderstand a lot of it and work through\nmany things right so\nwhat happened was\num this friend of mine of many years\npretty much told me she had a crush on\nme\nand initially my first\num reaction was to push away again right\nI wanted to run from it\num\nbut then I\nI calmed down I thought about it like\nwell I'm like okay I think I'd like this\nfriend too\nso\nI told her I like her back\nand uh\nup until some point it had been a very\num\nnice experience because I was able to\nfight those fears\nand uh overcome many of it\num\nbecause I think the key Point here is\nthat I really like this person like this\nperson\nand I trust her that she wouldn't hurt\nme so I think there's that's a big\ncomponent like\nthat I know I don't know if I can trust\nthat the other person won't hurt me I\nguess\nwhat's wrong with being hurt\num\nit's tough\ncertainly\nyeah\num\nso far I\nhaven't had like a positive\nromantic experience in my life so\num I guess I haven't processed those\nemotions from previous\nevents properly\nmaybe so yeah I mean I I think that you\nknow the other thing the last thing that\nI kind of want to touch on is is that\nyou were talking about this like four\nyear cycle of of toxicity where\nyou are essentially using Tinder as an\nantidote to loneliness\nand then it wasn't kind of working out\nfor you right\nand that sort of makes sense to me\nbecause if you show up on the app and\nthe main thing that you're feeling is\nlonely\nthen I think that that's not going to be\nthe most conducive to forming\nconnections\nright and it almost sounds to me like a\nlittle bit like sort of self-sabotage\nwhere if you're lonely and you kind of\nshow up and that's what you're really\nputting forward either consciously or\nsubconsciously then when things don't\nwork out you wind up feeling hopeless\nand then you like kind of quit the app\nuntil the loneliness gets unbearable\nagain and you have to do something\nhonestly you know what that kind of\nreminds me of Carlos\nit kind of reminds me of like patients\nthat I've worked with who have\naddictions where like the Cravings get\nreally really really bad and you know\nit's like not gonna really help you but\nyou sort of like have to start using\nlike it this whole like starting and\nstopping cycle reminds me actually a lot\nof like people who are struggling with\naddiction\nhmm\njust that you kind of use it as an\nantidote to loneliness it doesn't\nactually fix your problem and then you\nend up feeling hopeless and you kind of\nlike you're like never again and you\nquit\nright is that sort of what it feels like\nfor you that you kind of feel like okay\nnever again this is stupid like\nand then you quit yeah it is it is\nyeah that's it it's really interesting I\nthink there's all kinds of stuff going\non with dating apps and and we're not\nreally sure how they're affecting our\npsychology\nyeah totally\num because it's kind of like a gambling\nsort of\nI mean you're just waiting for that\nbecause you're swiping profiles and\neventually you get that reward of the\nmatch right\nso\nyou have like this rewards cycle\nthat makes you go back to it eventually\nyeah I mean I I don't work at the end I\nthink they're quite intentionally\ndesigned that way\nright right\nso Carlos um any so kind of where are\nyou now like how do you how do you feel\nabout\nthe future how do you feel about\nyourself like what do you think do you\nhave a road forward what does it look\nlike\nuh I'm quite unsure\num\nbecause of\nthis\num dating situation that I'm in\num it's not looking very hopeful\nbut at the same time\num\nthis made me\nwork a lot of my on myself I think this\nlast experience so I'm feeling a bit\nmore hopeful of the future\nin general\nI'm just not so sure about my current\nsituation and do you mind if I ask what\nmakes you not very hopeful about the\ncurrent situation\nyou don't have to say it if you you\ndon't want to I'm just kind of curious\nuh it's complicated let's say um\nthe person that I was starting that\nrelationship with it's dealing with\na lot she's rather very rough year I see\num so\nI think she's not in a very even though\nshe started uh\nall this process I think she's not\ncurrently on a good State of Mind\nokay so it's probably not a good time to\nstart a relationship I guess I see okay\nso it's it's not it's not necessarily\nthe person it's more that like the\ncurrent situation that y'all are in or\nnot\nis not really conducive to a\nrelationship\nI think so yeah makes a lot of sense\nyeah man that sounds rough I mean I'm I\nyou know I think the one thing that I\nwould kind of share with you is is I\ndon't know if you're kind of working on\nyourself in some ways so it sounds like\nthis relationship has helped you sort of\ndig into the fear of intimacy and\nconnection and rejection\num but it sounds like you you need to\ncontinue to do some personal work to to\nreally\nhelp yourself be in a good headspace to\nmake things happen on on the Romantic\nfront\nright\nyeah um I've been going to therapy for a\nfew years but um\nand I've been talking about this\nsort of relationship with my therapist\nand she told me like she didn't want to\ntouch on the topic because she knew that\nit was kind of painful for me so we've\nbeen focusing more on like professional\nstuff\nuh so I think it's a good opportunity\nopportunity to get back to it\nyeah I mean\nthe therapist didn't want to talk about\nit because it would hurt you\nI seen here that it was a sensitive\ntopic and I that I wasn't really\nfocusing on it so we were\num working on others aspects aspects of\nmy life based on your therapist's\ndirection or yours\nokay that makes a lot of sense\nyeah so so it sounds like she kind of\ngave you the opportunity to not talk\nabout it and you were like yeah let's do\nthat\nyeah that was it yeah okay\nyeah I mean well so so Carlos I'm I'm\nglad you're you know you have some\nsupport it sounds like you're walking a\ngood journey even if the road is a\nlittle bit bumpy and things are a little\nbit hard but it sounds like you're\nyou're really like working at it very\nintentionally\nand and I'm hopeful for you because of\nthat\nbecause thank you I mean it really\nsounds to me like a lot of where you are\nright now has a lot to do with you just\nas much as like the apps or other things\nbecause you know\ndoes that make sense yeah\nyeah it does it does yeah so the good\nnews about you know if it's your fault\nI'm not saying that everything here is\nyour fault but if you have some degree\nof responsibility here the good news is\nthat's in your control\nright whereas one of the most\nfrustrating things that I hear when I've\ntalked to other people like more\nprivately about their experience with\ndating apps is that the more that they\nsort of blame the internet and blame\nother people blame a particular gender\nis that it sort of means that the\nsolution you know they're not in control\nof the solution\nwhereas the more responsibility you\naccept you know that that is actually\nsomething that's within your power to\nchange and so it can actually be like\nquite empowering\nyes that's right\ncool any other thoughts or questions\nbefore we wrap up\nno I think that\nthat would be a good point to stop it\nyeah so so thank you so much for for\nsharing Carlos and I especially thought\nit was very like eye-opening about\num you know even in situations where\npeople were like kind of pushing to form\na connection that you sort of had this\ninstinctive response and I imagine that\na lot of people are actually like that\nthe problem is we don't talk about it\nthat sometimes even the exact thing that\nyou want from a dating app is the thing\nthat causes you to panic the most\nand then that in turn leads to a lot of\nlike shame and self-judgment because\nyou're like oh I wanted this and then I\nscrewed it up\nright so thank thank you very much for\nvocalizing those feelings\nin that experience\nthank you take care man hello can you\nhear me hello\nyes I can hear you\nyeah unfortunately my\num video camera is like not working\nright now so totally fine\nokay what do you go by my friend\num\ncan you call me like flow like flow is\nmy nickname actually\nabsolutely it's flow right\nyeah okay yeah I'd I'd love to call you\nflow\nso what's what's been your experience\nwith online dating flow\num\nyeah um so my experience was\nI guess to summarize it was like I had\nsome like decent success but\num like overall I guess at the same time\nyou know like even the success kind of\nmake me feel\na bit cynical overall\num the the reason I said that was\nbecause\num\nbecause initially when I started using\nthe dating by solo like follow like some\nspecific formula\num and like I kind of saw like got quite\na few matches and like went on dates and\nstuff and\npotentially\ntoo long-term relationship from that but\nI guess\num\nI guess it was like few years ago where\nI started to be more of myself with a\nmechanic I like um\nand but I don't know because of that I\ngot more like\nflaky I don't know something like that\nlike being ghosted something like that\nand so I was sort of like feeling\ncynical in a sense that like being\nmyself isn't really an option okay\num so yeah that's a summary of it\nbasically wow that sounds uh first of\nall really interesting but also like\nreally rough because it sounds like you\nsort of figured out the formula right\nand and you figured out how to get into\ndates and potentially even two real\nrelationships if you're kind of being\nfake\nyeah that was a bit uh a bit more\ninteresting nuances like those two\nlong-term relationship well I I said\nlong term but I'm not really sure if\nthis qualifies long term because it's\nlike um three to four months and I know\nthat sounds funny because\num like that's literally the longest\nI've ever been in a relationship like I\nmean like okay well I mean it sounds\nlike a relationship right three or four\nmonths\nyeah something that um but the nuances\nwas because\num\nthose two was more like I was being\nmyself I'm not sure like um something\nlike that but you were being yourself\nyeah I know like I know I've had to\nsound like contradicting myself right\nnow\num that is\nhow should I put it\num\nlike I got a couple of like\nbecause I started off like very like\nI'm I'm confident in myself basically I\ndon't believe like\nlet me I'm not worried at all about you\ncontradicting yourself that's that's\nwhere the Nuance is and I think that's\nwhere you know that's where the real\nlearning is I don't consider it a\nproblem if you make two statements that\nare contradictory in fact I think as we\nexplore that exactly kind of like what\nyou're doing that's where we're really\ngonna find the money but can I can I\nkind of go back and ask a couple\nquestions\nsure so you said that you sort of\nfigured out a formula that seemed to\nwork can you can you clue Us in on the\nsecret formula that gets you dates on\ndating apps\nyeah it was I was\ngetting good angles\num doing interesting stuff what do you\nmean by good angles\nwell\njust about the lightning better pulses\nso pictures of pictures of you\nyeah like more complementary of my looks\nbasically I see okay\nand and are you a your you identify as a\nman\noh yeah yeah and you're interested in\nwomen\nyeah and would you say you're a good\nlooking guy Flo\nno\num no I I don't think so like I'm quite\never okay so you're quite average but\nyou figured out how to you know take\npictures with good lighting and good\nangles to really like optimize\nyou know and and so you talked about\nangles and then so what else did you\nsort of figure out helps\nwell I don't know like it's gonna make\nme sound obnoxious but like I have six\npaths I mean like I look very good like\nphysically so I\nI can't kind of kept that like\ncapitalize on that I suppose so so you\nyou said you have a six pack\nI mean yeah just basically like\nshirtless pictures and like that I see\nokay so shirtless pictures and it sounds\nlike you're a swolder like you exercise\noh well yeah something like that okay\nand and so but you consider yourself\naverage looking\nI mean yeah like um face wash face wise\nokay so it sounds and let me know flow\nif I overstep okay because I'm gonna is\nit okay if I like meme with you a little\nbit or you want me to stay serious\nI mean I'm fine I'm fine with it okay\nI'm okay with it you look well can I\ntrust you to let me know if I say\nsomething that's out of line\nyeah sure okay\nso basically you're taking pictures of\nstuff besides your face\nno no no that's that's definitely not I\nknow\nnobody else funny but yeah\nforeign\nso it sounds like you're you're in good\nshape\nand you learned how to take good\npictures what else is part of the the\nformula\nI mean I was just being more playful in\ngeneral what does that mean\nwell like it sounds cringy but well I I\nmean well I mean it's not right because\nit worked\noh yeah it's I don't know I I first it's\nbeen it's been like\na year since that place I kind of forgot\nabout it but it's something like I just\ndo some very random weird\npickup line in my bio or something like\nhi I'm trouble and like\nI don't know I'm just basically\npresenting myself in a way that\nI'm a bad match like it's all like you\nknow like rather than saying like I'm a\ngood match and to say like you know like\nit's sort of like reverse psychology\nit's just like in a playful way you know\nplayful yeah\nso what I'm what I'm hearing is you're\nsort of sarcastically saying that you're\nnot a good fit which implies that you\nactually are a good fit\nuh something like that I suppose okay so\nit so it it sends across some amount of\nplayfulness and and you know like you\ncould take a picture of your six-pack\nand you can say something like yeah I'm\nreally overweight\nyou know and and I need to go on a diet\nlike something like that\nyeah something like that okay so you\nwere being playful\nyeah\nand um anything else that's on your\nrecipe for success\nno I guess that's pretty much it okay\nand then just just one I suppose I don't\nreally swipe a lot because like it's\njust more like algorithm thing because\nthe more you saw it the more efficient\nlike the less matches you get the it\ntends to because the at least at least\nfor Tinder from from what I understood\nis that that's all right pushed on your\nring if it's like so yeah something like\nthat but yeah so so you're you're a a\nrank you play the game of rank so if\nsomeone swipes right on you\nso there's some kind of ratio of like\nhow many people swipe right on you and\nhow many people do you swipe right on\nand if you swipe right on a lot of\npeople but not many people swipe right\non you that lowers your rank right\nyeah so you're you're kind of\ncalculating with how you swipe\nyeah okay so thank you so much for\nsharing all this flow I'm sure a lot of\npeople have learned a lot from\num you know a mini Chad like yourself\nbecause you're not a giga chat right\nyeah I'm not many manychat is fair\nyeah sure\nso so then you were telling me that you\nstarted to feel a little bit more\ncynical and you started getting ghosted\nlike help me understand so you're you're\ngetting matches with people are you\ngoing on dates\nyeah yeah I'm going on dates and how are\nthose going\num\nare you\nare you implying the the part where I\nfeel more cynical or no I mean so like\nwalk me through the process right so\nwe've understand you're making profiles\nyou match with people you're texting\nback and forth\ncan you actually tell me about the\ntexting back and forth like what that's\nlike in your case\nI've never used Tinder bro so you gotta\nlike really lay it out for me\noh yeah\num so I don't know like\nlike you know if let's say if let's say\nI'm actually\nunless a mattress 20 goes this week and\nlike\nlike statistically speaking like I could\nget like 10 of them being more like\nbasically 50 of them being more like\nenthusiastic with me where whereas the\nother 50 percent is just like yeah I'm\nnot really that interested I just\nthought it looked cool you know but so\nthen from there the the the ten girls\nstand us giving like a rough number\nright so and then maybe like there's two\nor three who really want to go out with\nme then so\num then from the I focus in on that\npoetry and and I just get their number\nand try to strike what the iron is\ncalled something like that because you\ncan't delay it too long because I know\nthere's a lot of guys who would want to\nask them out too so okay something like\nthat\nand and so it sounds like getting their\nnumbers not hard for you\nI mean yeah but number is just number\nokay and and so what do you what do you\nusually do to get their number\nI mean no I'm just saying like do you\nwant to\nI don't know oh it depends on my mood\nright like I don't really use it but\nit's more like a fancy a drink with a\ncute guy sometimes so something just\nbeing being like sarcastically playful\nfine [ __ ] Chad my dude\nno but yeah it depends on my mood when I\nwhen I say that how does that make you\nfeel\nwell I feel like impossible because I\nknow I'm not\num but yeah okay\nYeah so basically that's it um yeah okay\nso so it\nokay\nall right\nso\nokay so so you you get sorry\num\nso it sounds like you get their number\nand then you you recognize that it's\nimportant to act quickly right because\nlike attention spans are short in the\nday of in the age of online dating\nyeah and um and so then you get their\nnumber and then you call them and then\nwhat happens or you text them or what I\ndon't know what you all do nowadays\nI mean it depends something like that\nsometimes cold and you know just\num it depends if if it depends on the\ngirl usually if they'll prefer coffee\nI'll go for coffee that before like you\nknow just some night dreams and you know\njust see where it goes from there it\nreally depends on the girl okay and and\nwhat are your dates usually like\num well just getting to know each other\nand stuff when you know if\nand usually I see how she's feeling me\nat the moment and I will see I mean we\nwill see where it goes okay\nand and so do you do you tend to enjoy\nthose\num yeah um half the time so like I I\nremember like there was this earlier on\nthere was this one I forgot who who\nmentioned this uh which is the the\nproblem with\ngetting a lot of days is you know it is\nit's not I mean so so like there's two\nscenario like like\nyou have you have like a bigger pool\nsample but there's less likely of people\nthat actually match you whereas if you\ngo the other route where is uh the other\nroute which is you filter out all these\npeople that you as I mean like in the\nsense that you're being really extremely\npicky\num then I I don't know I just feel like\nbringing that up yeah so that that\nsounds important so what I'm what I'm\nhearing there is that\nyou made a profile that got a lot of\npeople interested in a shallow way\nbut that you ended up being a little bit\ndisappointed by the lack of real\nconnection\num yeah yeah I would say I will say so\nlike like early on because I started\nlike this online dating seriously around\n2016. like early on I didn't really care\nthat much uh like you know because\nbecause the the validation and\neverything was kind of interesting so I\ndon't really care that much and you know\nonce after like two years maybe I prefer\nsomething else that's when I start to\nfeel like yeah this is kind of\nthere's a big [ __ ] it's a bit\n[ __ ] like okay\nand and so can you tell me a little bit\nabout these two relationships and how\nyou started like what happened how you\ngot ghosted how you became cynical\noh yeah\num\nit was\nI guess you saw us around\n2020\num I guess so around that during the\npandemic uh\nI was just like you know what if I just\ntry to be more of myself uh like I don't\nknow like even even in testing in\ngeneral like\num\nyou know I just like maybe more more of\nlike a friendly conversation rather than\na floaty one\nyou know like just really get to know\nthat person and stuff and\num that usually tends to lead to\nI don't know like less reaction I guess\nbecause I don't know\num girls respond more towards floaty\nstuff and friendly approach tends to be\nless effective but that's one thing the\nother thing was when I like let's say I\ngot this girl out and something like\nthat like I don't know how to put it\nnicely but basically early on I was more\num I don't know I I wish it's like I was\nmore cold I was more emotionally guarded\nI don't really let them know what I'm\nfeeling and I'll later on wish you know\nI was more like if I really like to go\nI'll express it so what would you say\nI don't know it's a very uncontrollable\nunconscious\num I cannot control it sometimes it's\nalmost like I mean I I'm not I'm not\nlove bombing I'm yeah you know I'm not\ndoing those sort of things but it's just\nmore like I really like you like um\nI just want to let you know because uh\nI can't control myself around you or\nsomething like that I was being honest\nthat's how I feel and you know\nI guess the girl got freak out or\nsomething\nand there's a lot more you know similar\ncases after that or I'm not sure maybe\nit's just my biases but it kind of feels\nlike that\num okay\num yeah so floor I'm going to ask you a\ncouple of specifics here do you do you\nyou say something like like quite\nliterally like I can't control myself\naround you\num\nI mean it's it's so long until my I mean\nlike two years ago so I kind of like\nokay I can't really remember that\nspecification but it's something like\nthat something like that and and I'm\ndetecting an accent do you speak other\nlanguages\nuh speak Chinese okay so\num and and when you're talking with\nthese girls are you speaking in English\nor Chinese\nuh usually mostly English okay and and\nhow and so once you say something like\nthat you're\nguessing that and so then they pull away\nis that fair\num\nyeah it kind of feels like that\nit feels like that it's more like it's\nnot like so it so it's not like that\nit's totally stop replying to my text\nbut you sure it's just kind of feel like\nit becomes harder\nto get them to talk to me so I don't I\njust don't put in the effort after that\nyou know if that makes sense okay\nbecause I just feel like there are less\nenthusiastic like I I'm I'm not willing\nto put myself through that because I\nknow how this goes I've been in that\nposition before\nso you stop putting in as much effort\nyeah well as as soon as I detect the the\nEnthusiast like like for example I would\nsay something like hey you wanna get a\ndrink next week and then I was like I'll\nsee how as opposed to\num yeah sure I'll I'll let you know you\nknow and then like I will wait until\nthat day and then there's no like\ninitiative from them so I was like yeah\nI don't feel like initiating\nand and how many how many girls have you\nsaid that to\nyou mean like I feel yeah that I'm\nreally into you\num yeah like right this is this is like\nthe nuances I'm just\nit's like I don't really explicitly say\nthat all the time yep I I don't know\nit's just like like okay like two months\nago\num\nso this girl well I met her through\nnot not like anything but someplace else\nbut so so so basically it's something\nlike\nI became more\nemotionally vulnerable I mean in the\nsense that I\num\nI don't know like I just asked a lot of\nquestions like\nhey how are you doing you know like\num not not like excessively but\nbasically like\nI don't know how to pull it like I know\nmy frequency kind of like\nincrease a bit\nabout the frequency of communication\nwith them\noh yeah like you know like I said like\nrather than\nrather than letting them wait I mean\nlike you know so like creating the\nanticipation for them\nI I just saw like just like a lot like\nwhy should I play this game right like\nif I'm really interested in them I would\njust talk to them more right and then\nand then like I talk to them it's not\neven a lot you know and then I feel like\nthey are pulling away I can just feel it\nand the reason why I say I can feel it\nis because\num like I know they read my test and I\nsaw them posting some you know like\nsharing some stories on Instagram like I\nknow they are active and stuff and they\nare purposefully ignoring my messages\nand then I just left it there and then\nlike maybe two three days later I just\nfeel like you know what I'm not gonna\neat [ __ ] you know like\nlike I'm not gonna play that game so I\njust blocked them something like that\nokay\nand and so I'm still a little bit thank\nyou for illustrating how that plays out\nhow often do you go down this road of\nlike sharing your feelings with the\nwomen that you're dating or talking to\ndoes it happen like a lot very little\nlike are we talking like two times three\ntimes ten times 20 times\num I think it was like eight times okay\nso that's a fair number six yeah six to\neight times and and it it has never\nreally worked out with you\nyeah I guess so like I'm trying to be\nlike I don't know like I'm not sure if\nI'm just being biased I don't know like\nit's very hard to recall those\nexperiences of course yeah yeah and and\nso uh Flo I'm a little bit uh Curious\nlike\nI mean so so bro it sounds like\nyou really like care about some of these\nwomen that you're really kind of like\ninto them that you're really looking for\nlike a real relationship\nand how does it feel to kind of Express\nsome of your more vulnerable emotions\nand kind of have them\npull away like eight times dude\nhow do you feel about it maybe yeah\nmaybe that time was exaggerating like\nmaybe six times but but yeah\num how do I feel about it well I'd like\nto be honest um\nI've\nI don't know if this is the right word\nto express it I but I almost feel a bit\nlike in cell at that moment\nlike I feel like there's there's this\npart of me that feels like\nokay there's this solo I I just want to\nlike generally generalized woman right\nlike say you know girls are like that\nbecause I'm I was feeling hurt so I\nmight like a part of me want to you know\njust rationalize how it is how I don't\nknow um so I was hurt I was I was very\nvery very very uh\nyeah I was so super down two months ago\nyeah and and what do you do with those\nfeelings of being hurt or being down how\ndo you deal with those\noh yeah I mean I feel like this is\nanother Topic in itself but to some to\nto make it long story short I\nI struggle I have like very bad coping\nmechanism so sure oh yeah oh yeah but\nthat being said one of the worst thing\nwhich I thankfully I stopped doing\nnow it was in the past when I feel hurt\nI would talk to more women you know as\nas it's almost like it's almost like\nyeah who cares about that girl\nno\nmy equal let's talk about another one so\nit's like very just uh because I can't\ndeal with that emotion\nsorry yeah yeah okay\nyeah can I think for a second flow\nsure\nany anything that you want to ask or\nanything else that you want to add\num\nwell I just want to add like I\nunderstand that\nI have like this cynical part of me like\nbeing myself is just never gonna work I\nknow that's false\nbut\nyeah okay that's all\num would you say that uh you're good at\nexpressing your emotions\noh yes I I think I am I mean at least\nthe past\ntwo years ever since the pandemia I've\nbeen working on that I feel that I'm\nvery good on that so yeah okay\nand and do you have like close friends\nor family that you can discuss like deep\nand personal things with\num I have thankfully a couple of one or\ntwo three friends I can talk to you\nabout this so yeah I'm thankful okay\nand and I'm gonna ask you kind of a\nweird question Flo\nare you worth loving\nuh yeah that's an interesting question I\nmean yeah but you know there are times\nwhen I struggle with this a lot past few\nmonths ago so I mean now it's more like\nleaning more towards yes basically\nleaning more towards yes\nyeah it's not like a hundred percent yes\nI mean\nare you sure you're leaning more towards\nyes\nI mean I think so\nI mean I I say that because I'm more\nforgiving towards myself when I make\nmistake and all that I mean the past I\nwas very\nvery critical myself\nokay\nyeah so it sounds like you you're worth\nloving\nyou deserve your love\noh yeah yeah right do you deserve other\npeople's love\nI mean or are you worth loving by other\npeople\nI mean I think so I mean yeah okay okay\nokay I'm really happy to hear that\nbecause so here's so here's what I'm\nhearing flow a couple of interesting\nthings okay the first is that so you\ntossed out the word imposter\nearlier\nso like it sounds like you are uh a\naverage looking guy but it sounds like\nyou get a fair number of matches it\nsounds like you get a lot of women who\nare at least surface interested in you\nit also sounds like the way that you\nplay the game is to select for those\nkinds of women right so like you're\nyou're yeah and you you know you know\nkind of like how to behave like a chad\nI guess so right\nand so so which is which is cool like I\nI wouldn't advise you necessarily to do\nanything different right so I think that\nbeing like flirtatious being being a\nlittle bit you know and if you if you\nyou know are proud of your physical form\nand sort of advertising that I think is\nlike completely reasonable\nand then what it sounds like is that you\nget into these situations where you\nreally start to catch feelings for a\ngirl\nand then you sort of like\nchange your tune a little bit\nyou start to kind of like say hey I'm\nlike super into you\nand then you notice that they kind of\npull away when you do that and that that\nhappens consistently\nyeah\nand and then now okay yeah\num no\num\nno it's just\nwell I mean I will elaborate after I\nhear you no no keep going elaborate now\nbro\nokay well I feel like this is a bit\ndifferent topic\nearly on you mentioned like uh you\nmentioned how I talk about I was feeling\nlike an imposter like one thing I want\nto elaborate on that was also because\nlike that's something I just realized\nwas\nI I I'm not oftentimes I think about it\nis all the girls that I had like gone\nout and dating from from online dating I\nalways wonder\nthat if I met them in real life would\nthat be interested in me and I say this\nbecause I never\num\nI I don't know I I don't I feel that if\nI met them in like Social Circle in real\nlife they wouldn't bet an eye on me\nlike it is just how I feel\nunless you're sure\nyeah I don't know like and and it's it's\nnot just like you know Concord shoulders\nor whatever it's also like something\nabout online dating I can just show the\nbest side of me and like I feel that if\nI were to meet them\nin you know social setting or whatever\nI'm just like a hopeless\nyou know I just I don't know this is how\nI feel yeah and and sorry for making a\njoke that was making light of your\nfeelings I I think that that no no no no\nyeah it makes I think it makes a lot of\nsense because I I think that so let me\nso let me put it back to you this way\nokay so\nif you're\nhmm\nlet me think about how to ask this\nso\nit if you met them in person\ndo you think that they would be\ninterested\nlike I\nyeah I don't know the question of the\nday I I just don't know like no no I\nfeel like it's no yeah yeah yeah I mean\nthe answer is no\nyeah yeah right\nand so when I ask you like are you like\nworthy of love like what I'm maybe\nthat's so it sounds like you've worked\non yourself a lot and like super proud\nof you bro\nand and also that it sounds like you\nreally like lack a lot of confidence\nand what I'm concerned about is that I\ndo think there could be some amount of\ncognitive bias\num especially if because I I think the\nother thing to kind of think about is\nthat\nI think when you express like authentic\nfeelings with people\nyeah it's a it's like a shift right and\nso I think sometimes it takes people\nlike time to process that\nyeah\nand and I'm I'm kind of curious like do\nyou ever tell people in person or it's\nusually over text\nuh\nin person\nand how do they respond\nI mean\nI wish I have more time to recall that\nokay the memory and but um and is there\nprotect what determines whether you tell\nthem or not like say like let's say you\ncatch feelings for a girl what\ndetermines like when you say it\nor what determines when I say it yeah I\ndon't know I just say at the end of the\nday something like that I know but why\nat the end of that date as opposed to\nlike a week later or two weeks later or\nthree weeks later\noh um\nI don't know I just\nI just feel like I I I'm too old to play\nthis [ __ ] I mean this game\nyeah I mean I'm 28\num too young but on the others yeah yeah\nso so I mean for like I think there are\na couple things here one is that I\nwonder if you're writing off women too\nquickly\nSo when you say like like I'm too old to\nplay this [ __ ] or you know like I don't\nhave time for these games now that I've\nconfessed my feelings like now I\nsuddenly have no more time for games but\nup until you confess your feelings it's\nlike it's games all day long\nthe uh right\nyeah so so I I think\nno go ahead yeah no go ahead\nno I was just saying like the most\nrecent one which was\nI don't know like like the the girl that\nI said I block her because she she\ndidn't reply to me I I don't see any\nreason why I need to initiate the\nconversation after I wait so what amount\nof time between you telling her and how\nlong between confessing your feelings\nand blocking\nI mean so so so this the most recent\ngoal that um column core I blocked her\nwas just I was because she was feeling\nsick that day and um I was just asking\nlike hey are you feeling better like\nyada yada yada and like um she didn't\nreply and then like two three days later\nshe still didn't reply and then I saw\nher like being active on Instagram like\num posting story and that stuff and I\nwas like yeah I don't want to play this\ngame and then I just block her so we're\ntalking about 72 hours between\nconfessing feelings and blocking\nyeah I wouldn't say yeah it's not really\nlike confessing right it's more like I\nwas explicitly showing more sure um sure\nmy feeling but for context wise for\ncontext like this particular like very\nquickly\num she was the one who keep flirting\nwith me like she she like so so like\nyeah she knows that I like her so okay\nokay yeah but whoa so here's here okay\nso like\nyeah all right so I'm gonna start off by\nsaying like I could be wrong about this\nokay definitely I don't know nothing\nabout online dating\nso but here's I want you to try to put\nyourself in hers shoes\nfor a second\nso here she is you're flirting with her\nshe's flirting with you it's all fun and\ngames\nyeah right and so then like imagine that\nyou like like escalate some right so\nyou're like hey like I'm actually like\nreally into you\nnow\nhow would it feel if she just went back\nlike back to just the general flirting\nif she like gave you a wink wink a nudge\nnudge an eggplant emoji and a thumbs up\nlaughs\nyeah\num I know oh\nI take that as a positive sign rather\nthan you know\nokay okay okay\nso so I think I think I'm learning a lot\nhere\nokay so so my point is that okay so like\nlet's say like me and you are playing a\ngame of\nI don't even know what but if you like\nescalate on me\nI can't keep playing down here\nyeah\nyou get that\nyeah like she can't leave that she's\ngotta match your intent like you can't\njust ignore what you said and keep on\nflirting\nI guess so does that make sense\nyeah it makes sense I never constitute\nof that but yeah yeah that's interesting\nso and I think there's a lot that's\ngoing on because like here you are\nblocking them like you see them on\nInstagram but it's like if someone like\nFlo if you were to confess your love for\nme right now\nyeah I would need time to process\nright especially if I'm Into You\nokay\ndoes that and I think what's going on is\nthat that deep down you feel to a\ncertain degree unlovable we're just\ngoing to call it that I know you're\nworking on it and it's okay for things\nto be contradictory because that's how\nour brain works right so it's like do I\nwant to eat\nyou know like do I want to eat one thing\nor another thing like\nI want both and I want neither one so\nlike sometimes human beings are\nconflicted and I think what what I'm\nhearing honestly is that it sounds like\nyou're very very sensitive to rejection\nif you have like made yourself\nvulnerable\nand so before they even reject you or\naccept you it's like you can't wait in\nthe waiting room and it like feels so\nterrible that you just end up blocking\nthem\nyeah\nright yeah because what are you really\nwhen you block them what what\ncan't happen if you block them\nI mean I blocked them for my peace of\nmind basically like I just don't want to\nthink about it something like that\nexactly right so it's intolerance of\nyour own limbo\nyeah you understand limbo yeah\num I guess\num I can Google it later\num let me try to think about\nuh so so like uncertainty\noh yeah right so so like like but my\npoint is that I I don't I mean I I think\nyou're kind of shooting yourself in the\nfoot like bluntly because I think that\nsometimes when and I realize I'm\ngeneralizing here which is not something\nthat we want to do but I'm just going to\nuse this generalization it's true of men\nand women but I'm going to use the word\nwomen okay\nyeah so I think she like needs time to\nprocess\nbecause here's like this mini Chad\nflow with his six pack and his flirting\nand all this kind of stuff and then\nsuddenly in a moment Flo you have become\nevery woman's dream\nwhich is a sexy playboy who has feelings\nand is actually into you instead of\nbeing a sexy playboy who's gonna date\nyou and then just like move on to\nsomeone else\nand then like that's a lot for people to\nhandle\nbecause the rules of the game have\nchanged and sometimes they need a little\nbit of time\nI'm thinking about it yeah\nbut I could be wrong\nand and so the next thing is that when\nyou block them like then it gives you\npeace of mind but just think about what\nyou're doing there is for your peace of\nmind you're actually like\nyou're you're not giving them the chance\nto like process and like come back to\nyou\ndoes that make sense\num yeah I can I can think of I can think\nof one or two scenario who that fall\ninto that category but yeah right and\nand okay so so fair right so then we\nalso have to acknowledge that maybe like\nfour out of the six weren't looking for\na serious emotional commitment and when\nyou signal that they get less interested\nyeah yeah I think definitely that's\nthat's a factor too yeah absolutely\nright so I'm not saying this is this all\nalways the case but I think this is\nwhere there's like some amount of of\nlike you gotta really think a little bit\nabout so if like a girl like confessed\nher love for you\nhow would you respond\nI mean if I'm interested in her then you\nknow why why do I need to wait I guess\nokay so so how long does it take you to\nfigure out if you're interested in her\nI don't know\n24 hours okay\nI could be wrong because I never I was\nnever in that sort of situation before\nright so I I I think it may take you a\nlittle bit more than 24 hours\nyeah I I guess right and even if it\ndoesn't like so that there's I don't\neven know how true this is but it's\nsomething that I remember hearing it's\nnot like scientifically valid or maybe\nit is I have no idea but that men fall\nin and out of love quicker\nbut like women take longer to fall in\nlove but stay in love longer\nso so I think I think something that you\njust got to acknowledge is that\nsometimes like people need time to\nprocess and I certainly would not block\nthem just because you're feeling\nuncertain\ndo you see that like you're you're using\nblocking them as an antidote to your own\nemotional discomfort\nyeah yeah and then it sounds like it\nreally hurts you\nwhen you know that they've been using\nInstagram they're using the internet\nthey saw your message and [ __ ] a\nthey're not responding to you\nand how does that feel\noh damn\nhorrible absolutely what is the emotion\nthat you're feeling there\nwell\num in in that instance unlovable\nbasically in that instance and and what\nso I'm gonna I'm gonna give it another\nword it's ignored\nyou're being ignored\nyeah\nand when you're being ignored\nwhat are you gonna do\nyou know all sort of\nthings just not to feel it absolutely\nbut you sure as hell ain't gonna put up\nwith that [ __ ]\nyeah right yeah and if you ain't gonna\nput up with that [ __ ] what are you gonna\ndo\nwell yeah you're gonna block them and\nyou're gonna swipe right on a ton of\nother people\nyeah yeah\nright\nyeah\nthat's true and so flow like I think I\nthink you're\nI think you're a wonderful person\nI think you've worked really hard at\nlike growing over the last it sounds\nlike two years\nI think you're more lovable than you\ngive yourself credit for which I think\nyou do sometimes give yourself the\nappropriate amount of credit\nbut that inside of the the Chad flow\nis a little like beta flow\nand sometimes right yeah and and\nsometimes if you get treated a\nparticular way you get terrified\nthat the Chad flow is not the real flow\nand the real flow is the beta flow and\noh my God it's happening again\nyeah and then to avoid that because you\nhate feeling like beta flow\nyou're blocking them and the second you\nblock them the second you ghost them you\ndon't have to feel like betaflow anymore\nyou can swipe right on on 10 women\nthey're gonna text you and you're back\nto being Chad flow\nyeah\nbut neither the Chad flow nor the beta\nflow or the true flow\nthey're both false aspects of you which\nyou'll meditate for a while and you'll\nunderstand that\nmm-hmm does that make sense\nyeah yeah it makes a lot of sense\nbecause I was just thinking about one of\nyour meditation guys that you talk about\nthis yeah like the aspect of told\nthere's no toll without short there's no\nshow without or something like that yep\nand and so so I'll leave you with one\nlast thing the true Chad does not fear\nbeing the beta\nyeah\nso it's it's like okay give people a\nlittle bit of time more practically like\ngive women some time or whoever you're\ndating give them some time to process if\nyou change the rules of the game\nyeah\nyeah\nI'm writing that down as as we speak\nthis this and and like practically if\nyou've got those friends if you're\nfeeling that way maybe talk it through\nwith a friend instead of like engaging\nin a behavior with the person that\nyou're dating does that make sense yeah\noh yeah yeah it makes sense it makes\nsense\nI'm really excited for you Flo\nI I think you're you're a wonderful Dude\nand and I I really hope you find love\nthank you but you have to give it a\nchance\nyeah\nany last thoughts or questions\nwell nothing much it's just I'm a really\nbig fan of your work like like this is\nthe one I want to say it really helps me\na lot good last two years that's what\nwe're here for and and thank you for\ncalling in because I think with you\ncalling in\nyou're gonna help a lot of other people\nso thanks for being a part of the\nprocess\nthank you\nthank you for having me welcome my\nfriend\nyep thank you what do you go by\nuh just go by social that's fine soche\nfussy okay Sochi\nno no\nuh let's try torstein\ntorslane\nyeah yeah okay it's uh yeah it's not the\neasiest name I guess ah I mean no I'm\nsure it's easy if you speak the language\nyeah yeah I mean I mean for uh\nuh non-speakers sure\nHorse Lane\num what what are your online dating\nexperience tell us about your experience\nwith online dating I have been um\nthey've been limited and I've just\nstarted uh a couple of months ago\nokay yeah uh they've mostly just been uh\nnot so great\nuh got a couple of matches but they\nthey were some of them just advertising\num uh Services you know\nno I don't I've never\nwhat kind of services uh sexual\nreturn for payments okay that was a that\nwas a bit of a bit of a shock but okay\nokay\num let's see they're those are like two\nyeah two or three who did that\nokay\nthere was another one I mentioned wait\nwait when that happens do you like\nreport the person or what\nno I just like um no not interested uh\ngood luck\nokay because I I don't think it's\nillegal here to do that I mean I'm in\nNorway okay and I don't think uh doing\nit yourself is illegal I think it's only\nillegal if someone else is profiting\nfrom it\noh okay no but I mean in terms of like a\nI mean a dating app is it oh yeah you\nmean like that yeah yeah yeah not like\nlegally I mean like I'm just curious\nlike what happens when someone on a\ndating app tries to sell you something\nuh I don't know\nokay I haven't met that part of the\nterms and conditions that well\nno thanks not interested bye\nokay yeah so it sounds like you've been\ndating using dating apps for a couple\nmonths so what's it been like yeah\num it was just been like that there were\na couple of other matches\nand we're all right we started fine now\nnot chatting\nwith the chats then they went on to\num\nuh let's see yeah there was one she has\nthis really nice question early on\nuh so what do you do for a living which\nis nice it's a normal question so I tell\nher\nand then the next question was a bit\nworse I was like oh is that poorly paid\nwhich I thought was\nyeah I thought that was a bit of a\nstrange question so early\nbasically asking how much do you make\nokay you know so I was like uh\nyeah I told her that was a weird\nquestion\nand then she said just unmatched\nokay so that was that was that\nand yeah how do you understand that\nI basically take it that she was looking\nfor uh well a richer man\nokay I would think so I mean so a\ncharitable uh interpretation would be\nthat just making sure that I'm not some\nunemployed bum\nbut uh I mean since I already have a job\nthat shouldn't have been the main issue\nokay\nyeah\nand other experiences\nuh there was one yeah one more she was\nbut it turned out quite early that she\nwas pregnant\nand Pregnant\nyou're not responsible for that I'm\nassuming no no no no no no that came up\nquite early in the um chatting as well\nbefore this person is pregnant and\ndating\noh I want a dating app anyway yeah\nso um\nnot really my thing\nso those are the matches so I've never\nactually gone on a date\nas a result of uh dating app\nokay so so so far just to understand\nthis\nyou've gotten some people trying to sell\nyou sex yeah\none person who asked you what you do for\na living asks you how much money you\nmake I mean were they making\nconversation or were they like oh this\nwas uh this was what was third fourth\nquestion\nand when they say like is that well paid\nlike\ncan you just say yes and move on\nuh oh it's not exactly I mean it's\nnormal paid okay it's like yeah\nyou took issue with like you you sort of\ngot the vibe that she was sniffing\naround for someone who's wealthy yeah\nasking that early on was yeah okay and\nso then then you mentioned you responded\nto her and you said hey I think that\nquestion's inappropriate and then she\nunmatched yeah yeah as a not\ninappropriate that's a bit of a weird\nquestion I said\nand did you answer it or no\nno it didn't answer it just like just\nanswered with saying hey that's a bit of\na weird question isn't it\nand then they just unmatched yeah yeah\nand then the third person is looking to\ndate and is pregnant yeah and so that\nthat's not your thing you said that's no\nno not really that's that's definitely\ngonna come with complications\nuh yeah yeah\nand and so did you just tell her yeah\nI'm not interested or or what yeah yeah\nthat's just what is it I'm uh\nthat's not something I want to get into\nsorry uh but you know best of luck it\nsounds like it was nice that she told\nyou she was pregnant yeah yeah yeah that\nwas that would have been a shocker\notherwise yep but but it so it sounds\nlike she was pretty open about that and\npretty respectful and and not like\nleading you on and stuff so it's kind of\na win right yeah absolutely but it's\nstill like you know yeah\nand so when in that sense\nbut yeah\nyeah so if these have been your\nexperiences with online dating what are\nyou thinking going forward like is this\nyou but you said you want me to this a\ncouple months right yeah I mean I've\nwell I've been single now for for 10\nyears\nokay and then yeah after that breakup\nwell I did Count a couple of dates but\nthen yeah I've been just staying away\nfrom the whole thing for a while\nafter yeah for a few years\nokay I've just not been doing anything\nromantic\nand and\nnow I figure yeah it's time to to get\nback into it okay well I'm sorry you've\nhad such a a rush\nyou know reintroduction\nah yeah yeah that's uh\nI mean I wasn't going into the apps with\nbiggest of hopes\nand and which apps are you using uh well\nthere's this one called\num happen\nwhich uh\nwell it just sort of lets you know when\nother people who are using it are in\nyour vicinity okay now if you walk past\nthem on the uh on the street or whatever\nokay\nand then you can see how often you've\ncrossed paths with them in the last week\nor whatever okay\nso that's yeah that that's the app\nyou're using yeah is that the is that\nlike a common one in Norway\nuh\nI think so\nI didn't do any research I just saw\nGoogled dating apps and this one looked\nnice\nokay\nand then there's one yeah I'm also using\none called bumble\nand how's that going\nuh that's where I'm at the pregnant\nwoman\nbut yeah\notherwise that's nothing much happening\nthere so I think if I'm gonna let it\nwork I should get better pictures and uh\nwrite a better bio\nyeah and and how how much what is your\nwhat was your process of setting up your\nprofile\num\nI had a couple of pictures around now\nwere fairly recent and I used them and\nthen I just took one\none of those selfies\nto have the most recent one\nand then just yeah\nthere's some questions to ask the some\nquestions you answer like what are you\nlooking for a relationship\nnothing serious blah blah\nokay height and weight yeah\nokay and then you write something about\nyourself so so it sounds like you need\nto or you didn't really spend\ntoo much effort on your profile or\npictures\nno no not yet and is that something that\nyou're thinking about doing yeah yeah I\nthink you have to ask some some friends\nto help me out with it\nsounds good man it sounds like you just\nhad some weird experiences so far it\nstarted off funny so it can really only\ngo up\nwell let's hope\nI wouldn't temp fate if I were you\nno that's porcelain\nyou can try storage state\nthought thorsted\nyeah that's uh\nyeah cool\nI don't know what else to say because I\nthink usually people have had a little\nyou know have been on dating apps for a\nlittle while longer I really like\nappreciated your stories\nyeah I'm happy to to hear more about it\nif you want to share but you know it\nsounds like you've only been on the app\napps for a couple months I've only had a\ncouple of experiences yeah this is\npretty much it\ncool\num oh yeah I'm looking at the thing I\nwrote I remember this last one but\nthat's such a small story\nshe just wanted to get on some some\nchatting apps she was using\nnot messenger some\nnot messenger not WhatsApp from third or\nfourth one\nand I was like ah what is that app I\ndon't know and then she said okay bye\nso yeah why do they ask you to move to a\ndifferent app to chat\nI\ndidn't know I asked like why\nand she was like uh\nuh she deleted the contact afterwards so\nI can't look over it exactly what you\nsaid\nbut it all looked sort of weird so it\nsounds like people unmatched pretty\neasily\nsounds like well I mean I\nyeah\nhmm\nokay yeah I mean I I don't know it just\nsounds like you know any kind of\nanything that doesn't follow the script\nresults in unmatching\nuh yeah it looks like it okay\nyeah so Chad is also saying that maybe\nthat was a scam what do you think\nentirely possible\nfor some weird other app but yeah\nthat's entirely possible\nI mean at least I was suspicious of it\nsure\nand and maybe since the scammer since\nyou didn't download it right away any\nchance it was like a catfishing profile\nuh catfishing yeah like was it like a\nfake profile or was it could it did it\nlook more real\nit could have been real\nokay the pictures all look like normal\npictures and not\nI mean you see some of those yeah I\nreally have\nobviously just some taking off a model\npage\nand it's like yeah those are all\nprofessional pictures\nno that's not real\nbut this one yeah this one looked normal\nI think yeah\nanything else you want to share any\nquestions that you've got because I I\njust don't have much to ask given you\nknow what your initial experience has\nbeen pretty limited so uh well no no not\nreally\nwell I I'd love to you know if you could\nkeep us updated\neither if we do this again or\num you know posting on Reddit or\nwhatever like I'd love to hear what your\nexperiences are like a few months out\na few more months in are you like\noptimistic or how are you kind of\nfeeling about it\nI'm somewhat optimistic but I'm not\noverly invested I mean I\nalso just meet people\nout in the world\nokay so so let me there so yeah there's\na bunch of things that can happen\ncool so it sounds like you're just on\nthe early stages and kind of exploring\nand and not overly investing but also\nit's just sort of like seeing what's\ngonna happen\nyeah yeah yeah and I'd I'd love to you\nknow if there's some way that you can\nlet us know if we do this again like\njust you know maybe give us an update a\nfew months from now\nI'll see if if I'll remember it a
