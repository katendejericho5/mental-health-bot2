    "transcript": "right so like if you know what's\nexpected of you you can make sure that\nyou can put in the time do a good job\nmake sure you get recognized for it make\nsure you don't screw it up but then\nsuddenly like if someone dumps something\non your your desk at the 11th Hour which\nis not something that you planned for\nit's almost like you're being set up to\nfail and what do you go by my friend\nI'm Stephen okay and Stephen what\nemotions do you struggle with welcome\nthank you\num\nI struggle with stress\nokay\nyeah what is can you help me understand\nwhat you mean by the word stress\num yeah so\num\nI'm not struggling with stress\nuh it usually comes out as frustrations\ntowards both myself and towards other\npeople\num\nit can be for example my boss that is\nnot able to see that I'm overworked or\nfrustration\nand so uh okay\nso I don't think about stress as an\nemotion\nso I I think it kind of is an emotion\nbut it's also like an umbrella motion\nso it usually covers other emotions so\ndo you can you tell me what you're\nstressed out about\noh sorry I disconnect there for uh for a\nsecond no problem so when I think about\nstress\nyes\ncan you hear me\nBueller\nBueller\nI am not able to hear you uh we can hear\nyou fine\ntax dollar\nokay\nlooks like they're troubleshooting\nlet's move on and we'll we'll Circle\nback to Stephen if we can\nGG go next\noh let's try again Stephen let's try\nagain yes awesome\nyou back with us\nyes okay so how how far did you get yeah\nso let me just uh start over so\num when I think about stress I I I it's\nwhat I would consider an umbrella\nemotion\nso it usually is uh\nword that we use to describe a bundle of\nother emotions so can you tell me what\nstresses you out\num unforeseen unforeseeable things so if\nsomething\ndrops on my table\num that I'm not aware of then I feel\nthis\noverwhelming feeling of stress or\nfrustration\nif it makes what kind of thoughts go\nthrough your head when something\nunexpected happens\npay pay F pay respects press f\nStephen\nhopefully he's not stressed out because\nthis is an unexpected\nhello\nyeah sorry about that I don't know\nwhat's happening I'm not sure either are\nyou stressed out about the audio issues\nI am my heart is pumping okay so help me\nunderstand what's what are you\nexperiencing right now\num\nmaybe that there is something that I'm\ndoing wrong\nokay or something that I should be able\nto fix\nand is that how you feel at work when\nsomething unforeseeable happens\nyes\nokay\num\nthis may sound like a weird question but\nwhy is it your responsibility\nthat's some pressure I put on myself\num\nthinking about it rationally then it's\nnot my it's not my problem but um\nit's the\nexpectations I have towards myself and\nhelp me understand those a little bit\nwhat do you expect from yourself\nI won't say to be the best but at least\nto be able to perform\nand perform what\nI know it's kind of a weird question\nbecause it's kind of like we're talking\nin the abstract\nto to provide uh results okay\nand to be to be noticed to be to get\nrecognition from everyone around you\nand so if you're not going to get\npositive recognition but may even get\nNegative recognition\nwhat what is that possibility do to you\ngives me more stress help me understand\nthat what do you mean by more stress\num\nwell actually just the thought it makes\nme kind of anxious\num\nit is a hard question because\nthe the feeling of getting negative\ncriticism or um\nor not being recognized actually\num\nit it it's\nyeah\nso it's a hard question yeah so so I\nthink you've actually done a great job\nof answering it Stephen so let me share\nwith you what I he what I heard and then\nyou let me know if this fits so I can\ntotally get why unforeseeable things\nstress you out because what I'm\nimagining\nis that first of all positive\nrecognition is very important to you\nnegative recognition is to be avoided at\nall costs\nright\nand so the cool thing is that you can\nplan for that\nright so like if you know what's\nexpected of you you can make sure that\nyou can put in the time do a good job\nmake sure you get recognized for it make\nsure you don't screw it up right\nyeah but then suddenly like if someone\ndumps something on your your desk at the\n11th Hour which is not something that\nyou planned for\nit's almost like you're being set up to\nfail\nyes\nis that what it feels like\num\nyes well at least um\nwell I want to turn it around and say\nthat I'm not able to I'm not being able\nto succeed\nright so what what's it like to plan to\nsucceed to work hard to succeed\nand then be put in a situation where\nyou're not able to succeed\nthat's not a nice feeling\nokay\nwhat is that feeling\num\noverwhelming okay so overwhelming is so\nso first of all I'm going to ask you\nsome questions we're gonna we're gonna\nwork through this Stephen okay yeah\nsome of the questions I may ask you may\nmake you feel a little bit foolish but I\ndon't think you're foolish I think this\nis what happens in society which is that\nwe don't know how to put names to\nemotions it's not a skill that we're\ntaught\nyou with me\nI'm with you so overwhelming is not an\nemotion it's a size of an emotion\ndoes that make sense it's too much of an\nemotion yeah it does make sense so I I'm\nwith you and I think that's what\nstressed is right so I would guess that\nwhen you say you feel stressed you feel\noverwhelmed\nso the emotion is too much but what is\nthe thing what is too much\nI'm going to let you stumble for a\nlittle bit and then I'll help you out\nyeah\num\nI just think it's kind of hard putting\nthe name to to the feeling you're right\nit is it's very hard\num but\num\nwhat are you from huh\nwe were going to ask me what I'm\nfrustrated about what are you frustrated\nabout you're frustrated with your boss\nhelp me understand that a little bit\num I'm I'm frustrated with him that he's\nnot able to see that I am overworked and\nthat he should actually know uh\nthat I have enough on my plate already\nand and what why do you think he doesn't\nrecognize how overworked you are\nbecause I don't say no\nso are you frustrated just with your\nboss\nno I'm also frustrated with myself what\nare you frustrated with yourself for\num\nthat I'm not able to\nset boundaries\nso let me ask you something Stephen\nwhat's it like to go through life\npiloting a body in mind that can't set\nboundaries with people\nwell that's my life\nso what's it like to be um\nwhat's it like to be someone who can't\nset boundaries with people\nit's hard it's um\nI feel that I have to please everyone\nall the time and and no one is actually\nI'm not able to to to please myself yep\nright so you can't so so now I'm gonna\ntoss out words okay the first thing is\nthat this sounds very unfair to me\nit sounds unjust\nwhat do you think\num\nI listened then before and and and and\nhe he took the recognition but\num I'm the kind that child I'm the kind\nof person who pushes it away and say I\nhave to work hard to receive uh\nrecognition or and if it's unjust or\nunfair\num I need to work harder to for it to\nbecome Fair\nokay\nso this so so it sounds like you're not\nwhen when you're so love you put it this\nway\nwhen you're when you're already\noverworked and your boss\nplops a bunch of work on your desk you\ndon't think that that's unfair you don't\nfeel like that's unfair\nI do in in the moment I do there of\ncourse\nokay so now we can see so now I'm gonna\nhighlight something for you okay this is\nwhy I think it's hard to put words to it\nbecause in the moment you feel something\nbut how do you respond to those feelings\nwhen you feel like this is unfair what\ndoes your mind say\nit it tells me or it it like I said it\ncomes out as frustration I become angry\nyep\nright so it comes out as angry because\nyou don't you like you you feel\nsomething genuinely that this isn't fair\nand then what you do is you beat\nyourself up for feeling like it's unfair\nright\nyeah you're like\nI shouldn't be so weak\nI should be stronger\nI should be able to set limits I should\nbe able to make it fair\nI need to work harder\nis that what you say to yourself\nyes\nyou can you can't see me but I'm smiling\nyou're spun on\nright and so then how like\nI\nand so how do you how do you feel about\nhow does someone who's so when someone\ntalks to themselves like that\nwhat do they start to think about\nthemselves\nthat's\num\nworth a lot right you're weak you're not\nworth a lot\nand so when you have two people in this\nrelationship you've got your boss who's\nworth something\nand you who aren't worth a lot\nfirst of all that creates another layer\nof frustration and anger with yourself\nbecause on some level I think you know\nthat that's wrong agreed\nbut then we can see how you become a\npeople pleaser\nbecause if any time there's a\ndisagreement and one person is worth\nsomething and one person isn't worth\nsomething who are we gonna go with\nwhose opinion matters more\nthe person who's worth something\nabsolutely\nwho deserves to be happy\nthe person who's worth something\nright and if you can make them happy\nthen what\nthen maybe I can become I I can get some\nself-worth right because if other people\nif everyone so Stephen if if you do a\ngreat job you work extra extra hard and\nnever say no to any work\nwhat are people gonna say about you\npositive things that I'm a hard-working\ngood person at the company right and\nthey're going to recognize you so much\nand how much recognition does it take\nfor you to feel proud of yourself\noh wow\nmore and more for each time beautiful\nthe right answer is more\nand how's that working out for you\nStephen\nchasing recognition because you need\nmore\neach time\nhow's it working out for you\nit's not going too well Dr K it's not\nhelp me understand why not\num\nbecause the glass will always be half\nempty\nwell said can you explain that a little\nbit\nwell\nthe more recognition I fill into the\nglass the bigger the glass will become\nand there's it's more recognition is\nneeded for it to be full and it will\nnever be full\nso what do you think you should do about\nthat Stephen\noh I have no idea\nstop chasing recognition\nbut that's easier said than done what\nmakes it hard\num\nbecause I feel like I need it to to get\nby every day yep well said\nright I think the other thing that's\nhard is that if you stop chasing\nrecognition\nhow are you so in a moment let's say\nyour boss comes into your into your\noffice and says hey I've got this extra\nwork for you\nand you accept it because you're chasing\nrecognition right\nhow would it feel to say I can't handle\nthat my plate is full\nas a personal loss or defeat\nright so this is what's kind of weird\nyou're struggling really really really\nhard to not be a loser right you're\nsacrificing yourself to not be a loser\nand in order to stop being a loser you\nhave to be willing to lose\ndoes that make sense you got to let it\ngo\nyou gotta accept defeat to no longer be\na loser\ndoes that make sense or is that way too\nabstract\nthat is it is a little bit that's right\nso what I mean is that so you're trying\nto avoid feeling like a failure right\nthat's why you don't say no\nyes okay we don't want to feel like a\nfailure so whatever you give us we're\ngonna do and then we're going to be\noverworked we're going to be stressed\nwe're going to be overwhelmed and we're\ngoing to wind up dropping some balls and\nwe're going to end up making mistakes\nright\nright so I don't want to be a failure\nand thus you take on more work than you\ncan handle you're burnt out and you set\nyourself up to be a failure\nright\nyes and so how do we get around that\nit's when the work comes in and we say\nno what do you feel like\na loser a failure\nso oddly enough what you need to do is\nactually embrace being a failure\nin order to stop being a failure\nwhich is paradoxical because as long as\nyou're chasing success you're dooming\nyourself to failure\ndoes that make sense\nit does yeah and so I know it's going to\nbe really weird but I'm talking about\nlike in a moment so the fear that a lot\nof people have is that they feel like\nthey're gonna feel like a failure for\ndays on end if they say no today\nso what I would strongly recommend to\nyou is first of all be prepared that\nyou've got to be able to tolerate the\nfeeling of being a failure to start\nsetting up boundaries and being able to\nlike actually become successful\nbut for that moment you have to like\ntake that bitter medicine\nwhich is I'm gonna feel terrible about\nmyself because you can't you can't\ntolerate that feeling which is why you\nnever say no\nright people Pleasers can't tolerate\ndisappointing other people\nand since you can't tolerate\ndisappointing people you make promises\nyou can't keep and then you end up\ndisappointing people\nand then you're like never again I don't\nlike this feeling I don't like this\nfeeling I don't like this feeling and\nthen they come and ask you for favors\nand you don't want that feeling so you\nsay yes and you end up disappointing\nthem\ndo you understand that what you've got\nto do is in that moment disappoint\npeople that's the only way you get past\nthis\nsounds hard it is hard\nso there's practical stuff that you can\ndo\nso I'm going to try to equip you with a\ncouple of like\nideas okay the first is have a\nconversation with your do you think your\nboss is a good person\nno\nokay\nis your is your workplace\nabusive not abusive but do they take\nadvantage of you\nuh in the department where where I'm\nworking yes but the company in general\nno is there any possibility of moving\num no I'm I'm applying for other jobs so\nokay so so this is important so if your\nboss is not\na good person and is not willing to hear\nyou out then that sucks and you should\nyou know\npotentially move but even at your new\nboss I wouldn't be surprised if you\ncreate this kind of situation\noh it's the story of my life okay\nright so so this is where I think it's\nworthwhile for you to to like approach\nyour boss I recognize this may not go\nwell but I'm just gonna let's assume\nthat you have at least a decent boss\neven with with a a not a decent boss you\ncan still do this kind of stuff although\nyour chances of success success are\nlower and you can ask your boss hey what\ndo you think about my current workload\nso we're going to start with something\ncalled an open-ended question we're not\ngoing to make any assumptions\nand then we're going to hear what your\nboss has to say\nokay the other thing that we're going to\ndo is is that at some point you may want\nto try to lay out what your experience\nof working here is like\nand then the other thing that you can\ntry to do is so you can say like hey so\nhere's like here's what I've got on my\nplate I've noticed there's a pattern\nwhere Thursdays at 5 PM someone comes in\nand like gives me additional work\nand then I'm having trouble getting\neverything done\nand I'm really trying like I'm starting\nto burn burn out\nyou if your boss is not compassionate\nyou don't have to say that but the other\napproach that you can sort of take is\nwhen someone gives you new work\nyou can share with them what your\ncurrent responsibilities are and what's\nthe priority\nso if someone says like hey like we need\nyou to do this by tomorrow and you can\nsay Okay absolutely 100 I can do it by\ntomorrow out of the other three things\nI'm supposed to have done by tomorrow\nwhich one should I push\nsee this is what I'm doing but in a very\nnot in a good way in a very like I'm\nsaying it in a frustrating tone and an\nangry tone\num\nso not very um yeah so so that's where\nlike what we've sort of found especially\nin career coaching is that dealing with\nyour frustration separately is critical\nto communicating effectively\nyou can't be frustrated when you\ncommunicate like this\ndoes that make sense\nit does so so it's it's not like it's\nnot a statement it's not like weakness\nand it's not that your boss is mean it's\njust a statement of facts\nit's like there are 10 hungry people and\nwe have five sandwiches which five\npeople do you want me to feed I'm happy\nwe've got five five sandwiches and seven\npeople three more people show up you\ntell me I need to feed them totally fine\nI can absolutely feed these three people\nwhich three people are gonna go hungry\ninstead\nyou're just going to put it to your boss\nyou can say you can do whatever I'll do\nwhatever you want me to do\nwhat's the priority\nand then this is where your boss may be\nSquirrely and be like they're all equal\npriorities\nyou can say I'm having a lot of trouble\nunderstanding that because like which\none is the most important\nthey're like they're all important\nthen you can say like okay I don't think\nI'm going to be able to get to all these\nwell you need to get to all these and\nthat then you kind of like have your\nanswer which is\nyou know that this place not may not be\nvery\nuh\nokay to stay at there's another actually\ninteresting high-level play that you can\nyou can make here which is you can ask\nyour boss\nit sounds like you're getting a ton of\nlike unreasonable requests\ndoes that make sense Stephen yeah yeah\nit does it does yeah it does and then\nwhat do you think because like if you're\nif your boss is like they're all a\npriority like what do you like they've\ngot pressure too\nmm-hmm and it's like it's a really good\ntactic where you can suddenly be on\ntheir side and you can say look I'm\nhappy to try to help you it sounds like\nthey're asking you to do too much\ncan we try to figure out together like\nhow to prioritize this\nso this is something that a lot of\npeople don't understand when it comes to\noverbearing bosses\nso there's a there's a saying that we've\ngot\n[ __ ] rolls downhill\nyeah but what that means is even if it's\nwinding up with you what that means is\nthat it rolled past your boss\nand so these are the kinds of techniques\nthat we're never really taught but you\ncould try empathizing with your boss and\nsaying like look\nI know you've got too much to work on\nI'm honestly I'm doing the best that I\ncan\nthis sounds like it's ridiculous\nI don't I don't want to let you down I\ndon't want to let your bosses down I\nwant to try to help you shine but like\nthis is crazy dude I need some help\nfiguring out how to prioritize\nand it's very hard for bosses to when\nyou frame it like that like you're\nasking for help and that you want to\nsucceed\nit's very hard for bosses to be like\n[ __ ] you do it all\nand then what we've actually seen is\nthat you can sort of be like that your\nboss's Ally they can start treating you\na lot better like you can kind of even\nModel Behavior for them to set limits\nwith people above them\nright and it's kind of weird but it can\nwork really well\nso in your case I think there are a\ncouple of different things to do so one\nis I'd say that be really careful about\nyour feeling of not disappointing people\nor your fear of disappointing people in\nthe moment\nbecause that's what sets you up actually\nfor failure\nand you've got to be able to tolerate\nsome\nof of like setting limits with people\nand then being disappointed in you\nand then the second thing is there's\nlike language that you can use to\nmitigate that disappointment\nand really demonstrate to your boss that\nyou really do want to try you really do\ncare about your job you're a hard worker\nyou're willing to go the extra mile but\nwhat they're asking is like way more\nlike you started going the extra mile\nthree miles ago\nand you can go the extra mile or\nkilometer based on your accent\nbut you know like going five kilometers\nextra is just too much\nand you don't want to come across as as\nif if your boss isn't compassionate you\ndon't come across as I'm burnt out I\ncan't handle it\nto be like this is this this work the\npace of this work is is really really\nhigh I'm struggling to keep up I'm\ntrying to prioritize will you help me\nand if they say no I'm not going to help\nyou prioritize you need to do it all\nthen you're already looking for other\njobs\nand then the key thing is when you leave\nthat job\nthey're going to ask you to stay and\nyou're going to probably should say no\nso I think there's a personal level to\nthis and there's like a work level to\nthis\ndoes that help I totally yeah yeah\nit does\nit really does\nand I I think you if the student became\nthe master Stephen because you were\ntelling us that okay like the the glass\nkeeps growing\nand no amount of external recognition\nwill be sufficient which you're spot on\nright and then the the last thing I'll\nkind of leave you with is a dimension\nfor exploration is\nwhen did you start needing the\nrecognition of others to feel good about\nyourself\nwow that's a long time ago I'm an old\nguy\nso so that's where you need you can go\nto the root of the problem\ncool\nyeah I'm cool thank you very much for\ncalling in Stephen\nthank you for taking the time you're\nvery welcome my friend good luck to you\nthank you you too\nall right so\nI think we kind of summed up there too\nbut\nthere's this interesting cycle\nof I don't want to disappoint people\nso I can't tolerate telling people no\nbecause of I I need their approval\nwhy do I need their approval because I\ndon't feel good about myself so when you\ndon't feel good about yourself\nyou need the recognition of others to\nfill that void\nso now that I need the recognition of\nothers and the esteem of others to feel\ngood about myself when someone comes and\nasks me for something\nthen I can't say no\nbecause I need this person to not be\ndisappointed in me\nthe tricky thing there is that this is\nnot a winning strategy because then the\nif I can't turn someone down\nthen people keep on asking me and keep\non asking me and keep on asking me and\nthen I set myself up for failure\nbecause I'm over taxed and\nunder-resourced\nand then as I'm over taxed and under\nresourced I end up disappointing people\nas I end up disappointing people I feel\nworse about myself as I feel worse about\nmyself I need more recognition from\nother people to balance that\nand so bizarrely I know it sounds kind\nof weird but to stop letting people down\nyou have to start letting people down\nright to stop disappointing people what\nyou've got to do is start disappointing\npeople\nwhich is setting limits and tolerate\nthat disappointment in the moment which\nwill feel terrible\nfor like an hour\nbut will save you so much a week from\nnow two weeks from now three weeks from\nnow because then something magical will\nhappen as you start to set limits you\ncan actually start doing a good job as\nyou start to do a good job you're going\nto get positive recognition\nand then I know it sounds kind of\nbizarre but like you'll like they'll\nit'll start to balance out\nand as you start satisfying people\nthey're gonna be okay with like\nyou know you setting boundaries on them\nif you found this video helpful check\nout Dr K's guide we've spent hundreds
