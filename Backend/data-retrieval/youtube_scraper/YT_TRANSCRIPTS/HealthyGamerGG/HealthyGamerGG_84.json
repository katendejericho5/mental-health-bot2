    "transcript": "all kinds of problems come with ego one\nis that comparison really sets in so ego\nby its nature exists to compare it's one\nof the fundamental things so like if I\nhave an identity of I'm the best what\nthat means is that like if that's my\nidentity and someone shows up who's\nbetter than me then I can't let them do\nthat so then either I need to work\nharder or I need to be toxic and try to\nsabotage them or all kinds of other crap\nhappens so comparison and ego go hand\ninand and even if we kind of look at\nsome of these this is kind of confusing\nfor a lot of people but recently I've\nbeen talking about how tall and short\nare not real things they are comparisons\nand they are abstractions so height is a\nreal thing absolutely but tall and short\nare comparisons you can't be if I'm the\nonly human being on the planet and I\nlive on a desert island or I live on an\nisland there's no other human beings I\nwon't be tall or short I will be a\ncertain height I can do certain things\nbut other human beings are necessary for\ntall and short to exist that makes sense"
