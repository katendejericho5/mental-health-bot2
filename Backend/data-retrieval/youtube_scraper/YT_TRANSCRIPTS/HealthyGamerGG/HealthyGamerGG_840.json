    "transcript": "so what we're talking about in bipolar\ndisorder is extended periods of time\nwe're talking weeks or months with a\nparticular mood fluctuation that then\nkind of resolves and then people can\nkind of flip the other way\nso today I want to talk to you a little\nbit about bipolar disorder and more\nspecifically I've had a ton of patients\nwho frequently want to go off of\nmedication\nand the more that I I've talked to\npeople about who who have a diagnosis of\nbipolar disorder they have a real\nlove-hate relationship when it comes to\nmedication so on the one hand medication\ncan be really really good for\nstabilizing your mood kind of keeping\nyou consistent on a day-to-day basis\nhelps people finish college helps people\nsort of maintain healthy relationships\nthere are a lot of good things for\nmedication with bipolar disorder the\nchallenge is that oftentimes the\nmedications come with pretty heavy side\neffects for a lot of people we're not\ntalking about\num you know sometimes they can have\nphysical side effects as well but a lot\nof times what I hear from my patients\nwith bipolar disorder is that they feel\nkind of mellowed out a little bit they\ndon't feel like life is quite as\nexciting they also sometimes feel like\nit causes problems with their creativity\nand the most common reason that I hear\nfrom my patients about why they want to\nstop their medication is because they\ncan handle it now and it's under control\nand so why should I continue taking\nmedication if I'm feeling really good\nevery single day\nand so that's a really really good\nquestion and it's actually a really\nchallenging issue but what I'd love to\ndo today is to talk to you all a little\nbit about how I think about bipolar\ndisorder and sort of how to think a\nlittle bit about medication and common\nthings that a lot of patients and\nhonestly even a lot of doctors and nurse\npractitioners may not really know or the\nway that they kind of think about\nso hopefully this will be a little bit\neducational it'll help people understand\na little bit about why generally\nspeaking psychiatrists will be in favor\nof their patients staying on medication\neven though everything seems to be going\nreally well\nso the first thing that I kind of want\nto start with is is almost like a a\nprovider or a clinical perspective so\nI've talked to a lot of psychiatrists\nand nurse practitioners about you know\nhow they prescribe medications for\nbipolar disorder and I'm a little bit\nsurprised actually by how simplistic a\nlot of the thinking is so a lot of times\npeople will sort of think about okay\nhere's a disease\nhere's a medication that treats the\ndisease so let's just start the\nmedication and stick with the medication\nit's like pretty simple right that's our\nsystem of medicine works if you've got\npneumonia start antibiotics and that'll\nkind of fix the problem and what I've\nreally found that's actually quite\ndisturbing is that I've seen a lot of\npatients who are coming in\nfrom other providers who will be on tons\nof medications and presumably for\nbipolar disorder and I'll kind of ask\nthem like okay like why are you taking\nthese four medications they're like oh\nI'm bipolar and I've got ADHD and I've\ngot anxiety so this is why I'm taking\nall these medications and I get kind of\nconfused by that because when I look at\nthe medications it doesn't really make a\nlot of sense to me like how these\nmedications kind of all got piled on and\nusually what I I in the bad scenario is\nwhat we've got is someone who's really\nsort of treating a disease as opposed to\na person they're sort of thinking about\nokay this is like here's bipolar\ndisorder so like let's give you some\nmedication and if the patient comes in\ntwo months later and they're still\nexperiencing symptoms or their bipolar\ndisorder isn't under control or they're\ncomplaining of something or their family\ncomplains of something someone will like\nadd an additional medication and add\nadditional medication and then you sort\nof get into the situation where people\nare on tons of medications and aren't\neven sure what they're doing\nI would say that for a lot of patients\nthat I've seen who are coming from other\nproviders that the majority of them\nactually do better with like fewer\nmedications but the ones that are\nselected correctly and that's what I'd\nlove to share with you all today is kind\nof my perspective on how I sort of think\nabout bipolar disorder and and how to\nthink about whether medications are\nappropriate or not\nso once again a big disclaimer that\nthese are all things this is for\neducational purposes only I don't\nrecommend that you alter your\nmedications based on anything we talk\nabout today but rather use what we talk\nabout today as a launching pad into\nconversations with whoever's prescribing\nyou medication and ask questions like\nwhy am I being prescribed these regimens\nwhat's the what's the sort of clinical\nreasoning behind this medication this\nmedication this medication this\nmedication why are you giving me this\nwhat is this one supposed to do what is\nthis one supposed to do what is this one\nsupposed to do and oftentimes it's\npatients who unfortunately have to\nadvocate for themselves because\nespecially as we're sort of as mental\nhealth providers are becoming\nincreasingly burdened oftentimes what's\nhappening is a lot of patients are being\nover prescribed medication\nso let's talk a little bit about bipolar\ndisorder the first thing to understand\nabout bipolar disorder is\nit's it doesn't mean that your mood\nfluctuates wildly on a day-to-day basis\nso I'll sometimes talk to parents\nthey'll be like oh my God my kid is\nbipolar anytime he plays the video games\nand if we stop playing the video games\nthen he throws starts throwing things in\ntemper tantrums and this and that so A\nlot of times people will confuse temper\ntantrums or mood swings with bipolar\ndisorder and generally speaking that's\nwhat we call emotional ability and it's\nlike not actually bipolar disorder\nbipolar disorder is characterized by\nperiods of time that are pretty\nextensive\nand are are dominantly like have a mood\nfluctuation so what that sort of means\nis we're talking about three months of\ndepression or six months of depression\nor one one year of depressive symptoms\nor we're talking about weeks of\nhypomanic or manic symptoms so it's not\nlike you're depressed one day in Manic\nthe next day that can't happen sometimes\nbut it's usually not really what bipolar\ndisorder looks like it's the exception\nrather than the rule so what we're\ntalking about in bipolar disorder is\nextended periods of time we're talking\nweeks or months with a particular mood\nfluctuation that then kind of resolves\nand then people can kind of flip the\nother way\nso for example oftentimes when people\nhave bipolar disorder they'll experience\na period of mania or hypomania so these\nare characterized by things like a lack\nof sleep or lack of Need for Sleep High\ndegrees of high levels of energy being\nirritable being a little bit arrogant or\ngrandiose and thinking that you can kind\nof Take On The World and start a company\nand solve you know problems and quantum\nmechanics and discover Quantum Computing\nand all this kind of stuff there's like\na lot of grandiosity a lot of like\nelevated mood but also really irritable\num not sleeping as much not eating as\nmuch talking a lot being a little bit\ndisorganized and Confused\nso that's really common for like Mania\nor hypomania\nkeep in mind that hypomania is basically\na less severe form of mania and\noftentimes is an Adaptive Advantage\nwhich is part of the reason why a lot of\npeople that I've worked with really\nreally dislike being on on their Bipolar\nDisorder medication because if you look\nat for example like ivy league\ninstitutions oftentimes their patient\ntheir student population will actually\nbe have uh more bipolar disorder than\nthe average population and specifically\nwith hypomania so I remember talking to\nwhen I was uh training at Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital I had some colleagues\nwho worked at Harvard College and MIT\nstudent health services and as I was\nkind of talking to them oh what's it\nlike you know working with those these\nkids who go to Harvard and MIT and the\nresponses that I got is like yeah you\nknow like we deal with a lot of type 2\nbipolar disorder or hypomania and it\nturns out that that's actually an\nAdaptive Advantage because you can be a\nreally good student if you're fully\nfunctional with four hours of sleep a\nnight and you can kind of be a little\nbit focused a little bit more energetic\nand so a lot of those kids are actually\nvery reluctant to take medication\nbecause it makes actually studying\nharder and they require more sleep\nso kind of going back to bipolar\ndisorder we're talking about long\nperiods of time where your mood is\nactually really really low and so let's\ntalk about a depressive episode for a\nsecond so these are situations where\nyour energy level is low your ability to\nconcentrate is impaired you may see\nchanges to your physiology like low\nenergy difficulty getting out of bed\nsleeping too much or sleeping actually\ntoo little but being tired all the time\nso that that's kind of what we think\nabout with as a depressive episode\ncognitively we're also talking a little\nbit about things like negative\nself-attitude so feeling feeling really\nguilty feeling really ashamed about\nyourself feeling like other people\nreally don't like you and that's kind of\nlike persistent and in the case of a\ndepressive episode how do you separate\nthat out from let's say low self-esteem\nso oftentimes with a depressive episode\nit's episodic so that means that there's\na period of time where it's discreetly\nworse so it's not like your Baseline and\nalso tends to be kind of refractory to\nother sorts of things so if people\nencourage you even if you've got low\nself-esteem hopefully you can feel a\nlittle bit better you can feel loved or\nvalued by your friends whereas when\npeople are in a depressive episode The\nthe kind of love and care of other\npeople seems to kind of Bounce Off\na couple of other things in depressive\nepisodes sometimes we'll see things like\nsuicidal ideation or a decreased\ninterest in activities so this is a\nlittle bit more specific for a\ndepressive episode which is something\nthat we call anhedonia which is the\ninability to enjoy things that you would\nnormally find pleasurable so life just\nkind of feels really gray it's not as\nmuch fun to watch things or play things\nor hang out with friends so that's kind\nof what a depressive episode looks like\nthe key thing about bipolar disorder is\nwe're experiencing let's say a\ndepressive episode for six months and\nthen we'll experience Mania afterward or\nhypomania and it's very common for\npeople who experience Mania or hypomania\nto crash afterward and enter a\ndepressive episode so that's really what\nwe're talking about when we're referring\nto bipolar disorder we're not talking\nabout day-to-day mood fluctuations that\ncan happen but it's really the exception\nrather than the rule\nso then the question kind of becomes\nokay as a clinician how do we think\nabout treating bipolar disorder and this\nis where what I'm going to do is whip\nout the old trusty iPad and let's\nunderstand this okay\nso when it comes to bipolar disorder\nwhat we want to do\nis understand that medications serve\nfour functions\noh that's red\nso when it comes to bipolar disorder\nmedications actually have four different\nfunctions\nokay so let's start by looking at mood\nso let's say that this is the Baseline\nmood\nlet's say here's let's take a patient\nwho's got let's say three weeks of mania\nfollowed by\nsix months of depression\nokay\nactually I'm going to say three months\nof depression three weeks of mania\nfollowed by let's say\na few months of depression okay\nso this is the manic phase\nthis is the depressive phase\nso what are the four roles of medication\nso one job of medication is to take\nsomeone who's Manic and bring them to\nBaseline\nthis is what we call treatment of acute\nMania\nanother thing that we want to do\nis bring people who are depressed and\nbring them back to Baseline so this is\ntreatment of acute depression\nso these are situations where you've got\nan active mood disturbance\nokay\nand we want to bring someone back to\nnormal so an analogy for this would be\nlike let's say I've got a fever\nand then I take like a medication like\nacetaminophen or ibuprofen and these are\nantipyretic medications the goal is to\ntake an abnormal State and bring it back\nto Baseline\nthe other roles and this is actually\npretty simple I mean I can explain it in\nfive minutes the other thing to remember\nis that when we're talking about Mania\nthis process is really important\nso before we become fully manic there's\nthis period of time where our mood\nfluctuates and this process is really\nimportant\nso the other thing that medications do\nis they prevent\nmood fluctuations\nokay\nso this is what I kind of think of is\nmore\nchronic\nor preventive\nmood stabilization\nso there's treatment of acute depression\nand acute Mania and there's prevention\nof further episodes so if we look at\nthings like antidepressant medication\nantidepressant medication has a couple\nof different effects one is it improves\nmood\nacutely\nbut then it also reduces\nthe frequency\nand duration\nand severity\nof subsequent episodes\ndoes that make sense so not only are we\ndoing this piece over here\nwith let's say an SSRI but our goal is\nto make future mood episodes really\nsmall\nand reduce their duration and frequency\nover time so what we sort of know is\nwhen people are on antidepressant\nmedication like without antidepressant\nmedication let's say like you get\ndepressed once a year or once every\nother year with antidepressant\nmedication you get depressed once every\nfour years and it tends to last less\ntime\nand it's like less bad\nso the key thing to remember is that\nthere are acute Mania so when it comes\nto bipolar disorder\ntheir medications for acute Mania\nacute depression\nwhich means a depressive episode and\nthen also\num\npreventing Mania\nand preventing depression\nso the first thing that I tend to see\nthat honestly it's kind of bad when\nclinicians make this mistake but I see\nit all too common is they'll get started\non treatments for this stuff\nand then they just stay on there\nso there are some medications so like\nlet's take example lithium\nis a really common medication that\nactually checks all of these boxes so\nsome medications actually do all four so\nit's very reasonable for people to get\nstarted on like a particular medication\nand then just stay on it\nbut the key thing here is that you\nshould understand why you're using the\nlithium\nin the short term we may be using it for\nacute Mania and we want it may want to\nkeep it on but what I also tend to see\nwhich there's data to support this as\nwell is a lot of times people will use\nantipsychotics\nespecially during the acute portion so a\nlot of times first line treatment for\nacute Mania like severe Mania because\nsometimes you can even become psychotic\nwhile you're manic\nis to start someone on an antipsychotic\nand the medication works really well\nright so you can have a medication like\nlet's say olanzapine\nand olanzapine is one of the FDA\napproved medications along with an SSRI\nit's one of the FDA approved regimens to\ntreat bipolar disorder in the United\nStates but oftentimes what I tend to see\nis that people will stay on olanzapine\nlong term which is not really my first\nchoice so this is actually like you can\nhave a check here it's not what I prefer\nbut it is an evidence-based treatment\nokay so that's like hopefully I'll\nunderstand that and why don't I prefer\nolanzapine as a long-term treatment\nso olanzapine for example\ntends to cause people to gain about 20\npounds or 10 kgs has uh you know worsens\ncardiovascular outcomes\nso people just gain a lot of weight\nsometimes they feel pretty sleepy and\nlike\nyou know it's not good like they'll get\nlike pre-diabetes and and type 2\ndiabetes and stuff like that if you're\non the medication for a long time\nso there are good reasons to be on the\nlenzapine especially with fluoxetine I\nthink that I think that's the the\ncombination\nthat's FDA approved for treatment of\nbipolar disorder but you have to\nremember that like some medications work\nbetter in the short term and you can\nstay out in the long term there's\nactually data that shows that in terms\nof algorithms if something works over\nhere and you can use it over here that's\nwhat you should stay with because if you\ntry one thing for this and then move to\na different medication for maintenance\nsometimes outcomes get worse\nbut the key thing to kind of think about\nis that your acute treatment and your\nchronic treatment are two different\nthings\nso then we've got other things like\nlet's say Lamotrigine and this is just\none doctor's opinion okay so this isn't\nlike scientific fact so then we've also\ngot Lamotrigine which has been shown in\nmy opinion to not really work well for\npreventing Mania but actually works okay\nfor preventing depression doesn't really\nwork great in my opinion in terms of\nacute Mania or acute depression\nso Lamotrigine also has the added\nbenefit of working really well for mood\nlability which is what we kind of talked\nabout earlier which is not bipolar\ndisorder which is like fluctuations in\nmood on a day-to-day basis so this is\njust an example of like another\nmedication and how it kind of misses\nsome of these things but then gets\nothers and then we've got some really\ninteresting evidence that shows that\nsome medication like let's say ssris\ncan be used for acute depression but\nthey don't really work that great to be\nhonest they usually take about eight\nweeks\nto really kick in and definitely works\nwell for preventing depression but in\nsome cases may actually increase the\nrisk of developing Mania\nso this too there's a lot of debate in\nthe psychiatric community so in Europe\nfor example there are many regions in\nEurope well they'll provide prescribe\nssris for people with the history of\nbipolar disorder they don't think it\nreally worsens the risk of mania but\nhere in the U.S we tend to be really\nreally hesitant around providing ssris\nwithout a mood stabilizer so now we get\nto a couple of okay does that make sense\nwe kind of with you there or y'all with\nme so let's just kind of review real\nquick\nso when it comes to bipolar disorder\nour goal is sometimes acute treatment\nand then preventive treatment and these\nare two totally different things there\nare some cases where you have one\nmedication that can do all four and so\nif that medication works well for you\ntotally fine you can take it you're kind\nof done but oftentimes what we'll end up\nseeing\nis that if you look at acute Mania\nacute depression\nand then preventing Mania\nand preventing depression\nyou can kind of create a situation where\nthese all kind of like work with each\nother so let's say I use an SSRI\nsorry\nlet's say I use an SSRI\nto prevent depression\nnow the problem is if that increases my\nrisk of main ear I may need something\nlike a mood stabilizer so let's say I\nuse something like carbamazepine\nokay so that's why I'm kind of getting\nthis and then unfortunately sometimes\nwhat will happen is that I'll have\nolanzapine\nwhich is an antipsychotic\nwhich got started because I was acutely\nManic and I got discharged from the\nhospital they sent me with a\nprescription because I was supposed to\ntake it for two weeks it kind of just\nstays on\nand then now what's happened is I've got\nthree medications on that\nyou know I may not even need\nlike I don't I may not need the Atlanta\npain anymore because I'm not acutely\nmanic as long as I've got the\ncarbamazepine and the SSRI I may be\ndoing okay\nso this is where it's really really\nimportant to think a little bit about\nokay like is this combination is this\nworking for me do I still need this\nmedication and the main thing is that\nyou know we really need to be careful\nabout stopping these treatments if we no\nlonger need them and what I tend to find\nis that you know this patient will kind\nof come in and they'll say like oh you\nknow like I'm not doing wet I feel very\nvery stressed out they're still on the\nolanzapine\nand then what will happen is someone\nwill be like okay well it sounds like\nyou're irritable it sounds like like\nyou're having difficulty sleeping so\nthis medication regimen is insufficient\nso let's add another one right because\nyou're symptomatic oh the medications\naren't working and so then what they do\nis they add lithium\nand now we're suddenly on four\nmedications\nand this is what tends to happen is that\npeople will just kind of like add stuff\non and then we get people who are really\nover medicated\nalso an increasing problem depending on\nhow like longitudinal care is because\nsometimes you'll have someone covering\nyou're seeing this person for this thing\nand that person for that thing and then\nwhat happens is like well like I don't\nknow if it's like medically medical\nlegally safe to stop the olanzapine if\nsomeone else started you on it they must\nhave had a good reason\nright so this is something else that\nwe're seeing is that as more people are\nlike getting Cross coverage\npeople are less likely to take patients\noff of medication and then you get\npassed around from person to person to\nperson you end up on like five meds\nso when it comes to bipolar disorder\nyou know if you're trying to think about\nokay can I stop medication\nthe other thing to consider is that\nbipolar disorder remember is mood\nfluctuations over time\nand if you're thinking about stopping\nmedication you need to be super super\ncareful because this is what I tend to\nsee so let's say that we've got our\nfour domains okay\nso someone comes in and says Dr K I want\nto stop my meds\nand this is where I'd say okay like\nlet's let's talk about that right let's\ntry to understand which meds should you\nstop and which meds should you not stop\nwell okay what's bothering you the most\nI'm sleepy all the time and I'm gaining\nweight okay fantastic\nwhat we're gonna do let's stop the\nolanzapine\nuh but I still don't like the way that\nthe lithium makes me feel\nI feel less energetic okay well let's\nthink about that right so you've been\ndoing well without being hospitalized\nwithout getting fired without anything\nfor one year\nand now you feel perfectly fine because\nyou're not having manic episodes you're\nnot having depressive episodes your life\nseems to be going well and if I'm\nfeeling well why do I need the\nmedication\nright and this is the key thing\nmaybe the reason you continue to feel\nwell is because the lithium is on board\nso this is another really important\nthing to understand about bipolar\ndisorders when we think about\nmedications we think about medications\nas fixing something that's messed up\nwhich makes total sense for the acute\nMania and the acute depressive\nsides right now that I'm feeling better\nI don't need the olanzapine totally fine\nI'm with you you don't need the\nolanzapine let's take it off\nbut the key thing to remember about\nbipolar disorder is that some of the\nmedication is responsible for you\nfeeling normal and what people want to\ndo is they want to stop the medication\nwhen they're feeling normal I'm feeling\nfine now why do I need the medication\nthat's why you feel fine because you're\ngetting the medication\nand so you really have to be careful\nabout especially taking off the\npreventive Mania and the preventive\ndepression medication\nthere are still good ways to do that\nwe'll talk about that in a second but\nanother example of this which I see\nwhich is completely unrelated to bipolar\ndisorders just give you all an analogy\nso I've had patients so I worked for a\nwhile as an addiction psychiatrist\nso I have patients who are like sober\nfor six months\nand they're like yeah I've been sober\nfor six months I don't even think about\nalcohol anymore I think I'm going to\nstop going to meetings\nand so I'm gonna stop seeing my\ntherapist I'm gonna stop going to\nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings\nand then what happens three months later\nthey relapse\nso one thing that I strongly strongly\nask you all to consider if you're on any\nkind of psychiatric treatment regimen\nif you're feeling too good today\ndon't stop the stuff that got you here\nright you don't go to the gym for two\nyears look at yourself in the mirror and\nbe like wow I'm really fit time to stop\ngoing to the gym because I've got it\nunder control now\nmaintaining your mental health is an\nongoing kind of thing and I have tapered\npeople and taken patients with bipolar\ndisorder off of medication before it's\nactually very possible depending on the\nthe patient stuff but that's where\nfrankly people who get off of medication\nusually need to be a lot more\ndisciplined in their regular life\nso in my opinion the most important\ntreatment for bipolar disorder is no\nmedication is not a medication\nbut is sleep\nthe patients who sleep well do so so so\nmuch better\nbecause lack of sleep\nis one of the triggers for a manic\nepisode\nalso messes with depression\nso this is the kind of thing where like\nwhen people come off of Bipolar Disorder\nmedication I oftentimes find that they\nneed a more disciplined lifestyle and\nit's actually harder to manage so it is\npossible right and ultimately like\npatience like it's it's your body right\nso you should be dictating the treatment\nbut when it comes to medication I would\nbe super super careful about stopping\nyour maintenance medication but by all\nmeans be aggressive about stopping your\nacute treatment stuff if you're no\nlonger acutely ill\nso this is a really common misconception\nthat people have when it comes to\nbipolar disorder which is that everyone\nsort of like starts to get better and\nthen they want to stop their medication\nwhich makes perfect sense right now that\nI'm feeling better like why do I need\nthe medication anymore right we only\ntake medication when we're sick because\nthat's how our system of medicine tends\nto be set up like you don't just take\nchemotherapy because you're feeling well\nyou take chemotherapy when you've got\ncancer\nyou take acetaminophen when you've got a\nfever right you take antibiotics when\nyou've got an infection you take blood\npressure medication when your blood\npressure is high\nbut with bipolar disorder there are four\ndiscrete roles of medication acute\ntreatment of mania acute treatment of\ndepression prevention of mania and\nprevention of depression\nand so when it comes to stopping\nparticular medications what I tend to\nfind is that a lot of people confuse the\nacute Mania and acute depression\ntreatments with the prevention\nprevention of mania and prevention of\ndepression treatments\nnot only do patients not understand this\nunfortunately a lot of times providers\ndon't or doctors don't providers right\nbecause they're more than doctors\ndon't really understand this as well and\nI tend to find that especially there are\nsome providers who are very very\nalgorithmic with their thinking like if\npatient walks in with\nthis disease you treat with this\nmedicine it's like a very very simple\nlogic but in my experience that actually\ndoesn't lead work out precisely correct\nand that you should always have a\nthoughtful clinician who's really\nthinking about okay what do each of\nthese medications do for you\nand when it comes to stopping them I\nthink you know for acute treatments it's\nimportant to actually try to stop those\nto minimize side effects and things like\nthat but for your maintenance\nmedications especially if you're doing\nwell and you've been doing well for like\nlet's say a year or two I would\nseriously consider staying on it just so\nthat you can get some stability under\nyour belt\nright because just when you're putting\nyour life together you don't want to\nfall back into a depression that's six\nmonths long if you're like a junior in\ncollege and you like have to repeat one\nyear and now you're kind of like getting\neverything together your GPA is going up\nand stuff like that I understand that\nmedications have side effects I'm not\nsaying that they're Pleasant or not hard\nto deal with but sometimes it's actually\nworth it to stay on the medication so\nthat you can actually like graduate from\ncollege because the last thing you need\nis to start your senior year get\ndepressed again and lose another six\nmonths and now you have to be in college\nfor six years instead of five\nso is that worth going off of the\nmedication sometimes not really\nso I'd encourage all of you all to think\na little bit about you know whether when\nyou're on medication to really think\nabout okay what is the goal of each of\nthese medications\nand you should if you don't know why\nyou're taking a medicine I strongly\nstrongly encourage you to talk to your\ndoctor about it and ask them like why am\nI on all this stuff like this stuff is\nhard for me to take I want to come off\nwhat do you think about that and really\nlisten for some kind of like nuanced\nexplanation right because they should\nhave good clinical reasoning for the\nmedications that they provide\nand if they can't provide that then then\nI would really challenge that even\nconsider getting a second opinion\nbecause sometimes we'll see these like\nmedication lists from hell it's like\nwe're on six medications for bipolar\ndisorder like why on Earth are you on\nthese six medications\nand at that point people just start\nfeeling better if you like stop start\ntaking them off of medications like\nthey're so they've got so many mood\nstabilizers on there that their like\nmood is completely flattened\nso unfortunately this is something that\nI'm seeing more and more where like\npeople are just coming in with piles of\nmedications does it mean that you should\ngo off of all of them which is\noftentimes What patients end up doing\nright because you're so frustrated\nbecause you're tired of being all this\ncrap and then you just stop it all\nand how are you supposed to know if\nagain if I'm on five medications how am\nI supposed to know which ones are safe\nto stop and which ones aren't I don't I\ngo talk to my doctor my doctor's kind of\nlike ah\nand then I decide to take them all off\nand then I my depression comes back\nMania comes back\nyou know and then I'm kind of like back\nto square one I've lost so much ground\nso I strongly encourage y'all to\nunderstand what the medications you're\ntaking are understand what particular\ngoal the medication has and talk to your\ndoctor about all that stuff and really\ntry to figure out okay what's the right\nregimen for you from a risk benefit\nanalysis right even if there are some\nside effects what is the minimum amount\nof medication I need to take in order to\nbe able to accomplish the goals that are\nreally important for me because\nultimately that's what medication is for\nright medication is there to help you\nlive the life that you want not get in\nthe way of living the life that you want\nsometimes you got to make trade-offs but\nthose trade-offs should always be\nintentional and thoughtful\nso now we'll open things up to questions\nyeah so the bone zone is saying I'm\nseeing a nurse practitioner psychiatrist\nthey just prescribe whatever but I'm too\npoor to see a good doctor\nthat's unfortunately I mean that that is\nboth unfortunate and\nsometimes common so I think that\nthis is kind of like\nan issue where I think we're seeing that\nthere's a shortage of medical providers\nso a lot of times people will see not\ndoctors which is not necessarily a bad\nthing I mean I've worked with a ton of\nnurse practitioners a lot of them are\nreally good and unfortunately like a lot\nof them aren't\nand that too I don't necessarily bring\nblame the nurse practitioners it's just\nthe kind of training that they get is\nvery different\nand furthermore sometimes what you'll\nsee I've seen this before too where\nyou'll have a psychiatrist who will be\noverseeing a dozen nurse practitioners\nbut like doesn't actually do any\noversight they just collect a check\nevery single week\nso I mean it's not like doctors aren't\ncomplicit in this kind of stuff too\nit I it just depends\non on you know and so Warhammer which is\nsaying my NP rocks I've worked with so\none of the people who inspired me to go\ninto Psychiatry was a nurse practitioner\njust absolutely awesome nurse\npractitioner who was on the transplant\nservice at the medical school that I\nwent to Tops for medical school and she\nwas just really awesome and and really\njust an awesome clinician really\nthoughtful taught me so much and I've\nseen a lot of nurse practitioners that\nare not that\nthoughtful as well I've seen doctors\nthat way too for example I remember\nworking with one doctor at a community\nhealth center who was like would see\nlike\nseven patients an hour\nspend less than five minutes with each\none\nand would not really listen to what\npeople have to say\nso I think just keep looking for good\npractitioners\nother questions\nour ssris actually effective clinically\nI think so\nso I think that if y'all if we're\ntalking about ssris you'll have to\nremember a couple of things\nso when we do studies on things like\nssris\nwhere look ssris or antidepressants and\nanti-anxiety medications for the most\npart\nso remember that we're taking like a\nthousand people\nand we're looking at we're averaging the\nresponse amongst those thousand people\nso the problem with that is that in that\nthousand people so let's say there's\nlike a 30 Improvement across a thousand\npeople\nthe thing though is if you look at data\non ssris\nthey're more effective for people who\nare more severely ill\nand so what what my experience has been\nis in that thousand people there are\nactually three groups there's about a\nthird of people let's say 300 people who\nrespond really really well\nto ssris and it like is transformative\nfor them there's a third of people for\nwhom like it seems to help some right so\nlike I'm getting something but it's not\nlike a life-changing medication for me\nand then there's a third of people for\nwhom it kind of doesn't work\nand then once we average all those\npeople together what we end up with is a\n30 Improvement but clinically what I\ntend to see is not a 30 Improvement\nI see drastic improvements moderate\nimprovements or no improvements\nright and there's there's even data to\nsuggest that you can switch ssris like\ntwo times and you can still get a good\ntreatment response so the first SSRI may\nnot work the second SSRI may not work\nthe third SSRI could still work but\nafter you've tried a trial of three\nusually the likelihood that the fourth\nfifth sixth will work is quite low\nyou can't take ssris when you're bipolar\nright that's not necessarily true so\nthere are some Regional variabilities\nthere about thinking so like\num you know based on some European\ncolleagues that I've worked with they're\nmore likely to prescribe ssris to people\nwho are bipolar the key thing is that\ngenerally speaking in the U.S what's\ngoing to happen is if you get started on\nSSRI you may need an anti-manic\npreventive agent as well so that's a\ngood example of why you may need two\nmedications\nright because the SSRI works so well for\nyou on the depression you may need\nsomething else to keep you from becoming\nmanic\nso Warhammer which is saying SSRI\ncombined with low-dose antipsychotic\nuh helped fix 20 plus years of severe\ndepression I've seen that too so\nsometimes the antipsychotic medications\nwill also be used as adjunctive\ntreatments for depression\nand walls of gav is saying I take an\nSSRI with bipolar but mine has to be\nwith a mood stabilizer I'll sync that's\na very common experience too so by the\nway I really appreciate everyone in in\nchat kind of weighing in\num just because I think these are like\nthese are good stories right so for if\nyou're listening to this like recognize\nthat there are people out there who have\nit's taken some time but they've found\nthe right medication for them and\nthey're doing well for years afterward\nBernardo Rocha Nunez is saying I enjoy\nthe personal experience of hypomania\nmost people do my dude\nmost people do\nthat's what makes it so hard to treat\nright it's hard to treat something that\nyou love\nGrand Elm is asking should I talk to my\ndoc about switching ssris if my current\none makes me feel emotionally numb\nanswer is absolutely so I'll give you\nall a quick tip should I took talk to my\ndoctor about dot dot dot dot dot doesn't\nmatter what comes after that the answer\nis always yes\npretty much I don't know about 100 but\n99 chance is yes\nI I don't think I can think of a single\ntime\nwhere\nI did not like that my patient asked me\nabout something relating to their\ntreatment\nright even for the people who are\nhypochondriacs and we'll have like\nmillion million million questions right\nit's my job to help them\ngo work through that kind of stuff\nyes I think someone is trolling me so\nscary printer sounds should I talk to my\ndoctor about how birds aren't real\nso this is where you may be trolling but\nhonestly I would love to have a car like\nif my patient thought birds were not\nreal I would love to hear about it\nright that's got to be one of the most\ninteresting conversations that\nI mean people can ask me about like\nwhether lithium is the right drug for\nthem and whether they should be on an\nSSRI as much as they want to but\nhonestly the reason I'm in the\nprofession is for questions like that\nwhy can't there be more psychiatrists as\nwell informed as you are I know why it\njust sucks there isn't so a couple of\nthings to keep in mind\nso the first thing to understand is that\nwhen it comes to medical providers\nwe sometimes think of people as like\ngood doctors or bad doctors or good\nnurse practitioners or bad nurse\npractitioners my experience has been\nthat\nfirst of all there's a fluctuation in\nterms of our performance as well\nright so like you all are catching me\non like noon on a weekday\nwhere I'm not burnt out I haven't I\ndon't have 45 patients scheduled in my\nclinic over the next two days\nso a lot of times like it's not just\nthat they're good doctors and bad\ndoctors but they're good doctor days and\nbad doctor days\nand you may just catch your doctor on a\nbad day or a nurse practitioner for that\nmatter\nright so like that like you just have to\ntry to remember that and especially when\nit comes to mental health practitioners\nlike we're all overworked and burnt out\nbecause the demand is just so high and\nthere's just not enough providers out\nthere\nthe last thing to consider is that I do\nthink that training could be improved\nquite a bit right so like part of the\nreason that I know what I know like I\nyou know I didn't learn this stuff\nthis the kind of doctor I am is actually\na credit to my teachers so these are\npeople at like Tufts Medical School that\ninspired me to go into Psychiatry right\nso I did like two or three months of\nPsychiatry there and then four years of\ntraining at Harvard and like my teachers\nwere amazing\nand so why can't more doctors quote\nunquote be like me so first of all we've\ngot to make sure that they're taken care\nof right they're not burnt out they're\nnot overworked they don't have some\nClinic director who's pushing them to\nsee 20 more patients so that we see we\nmake 20 more money\nthere's a lot of stuff that is not ideal\nin the medical profession and then the\nlast thing is that I do think that there\nare unfortunately some institutions out\nthere that offer very low quality\ntraining\nand that's just kind of how it is\nlike unfortunately that I do think\nthat's the case\nand this is this isn't I mean I think\nthe majority of places offer pretty good\ntraining but there are a lot of places\nthat will like pump people out and\nreally just minimize the amount of\noversight and clinical thinking that\nthey sort of have\nuh so slow Mark is saying my doctor\ndoesn't want to answer my questions\nabout why she switched my Zyprexa to\nSeroquel should I keep asking or just\nchange doctor she said I have to trust\nher but it's kind of lame\nI would I would push for that like\nyou're putting this stuff in your body I\nthink it's you're very entitled to a\nclinical reason\nfor the change\nI'd like to understand your clinical\nreasoning for the medication change that\nis the the phrase that I would use\nnow you have to be a little bit careful\nbecause\nyou really got to listen to what they\nsay\nbecause sometimes what will happen is\nthe patient\nwon't be listening\nright so you've got to be careful about\nthat too where maybe the doctor has\nalready answered your question\nso you you've got a\nthe other question you can ask is can\nyou help me understand why you're\nreluctant to explain it to me\nso that's you have to invite your doctor\nto also say hey like the reason I'm not\ngiving you explanations is because when\nI give you explanations you zone out you\ndon't pay attention and\nyou don't seem to really care what I say\nI've been in that situation as well\nwhere people are just sort of like\nunhappy and no amount of clinical\nreasoning seems to be like processed at\nall\nso you can even ask them what's your\nreluctance to explain it to me\ndo you find that I'm receptive or not\nso I think it's important for you to\ntrust your doctor that's absolutely true\nyou sure trust your doctor but trust\nshould not be a substitute for\nexplanation and clinical reasoning does\nthat make sense\nlike\nthose things should not like it's not\nthat's not like a\ntruth like it's like not an either or\ndoes that make sense it's not like a\nmultiple choice question where you get\nto pick trust or clinical reasoning or\ncommunicating with your doctor\nthose should not be exclusive they\nshould be hand in hand\nmy therapist wants me out of\nantidepressants because she thinks I\nmust change my view of myself as a\nmental patient but my psychiatrist tells\nme to wait more time before stopping to\ntake them any advice yeah so a couple\nthings one is that if your therapist and\nyour psychiatrist are giving you\ncontrary advice\nthey should talk to each other they\nshould be talking to each other in\ngeneral\num and the second thing is I I would ask\nyour therapist what they think about\nantidepressants in general\nbecause one of the the really\nunfortunate things is that a lot of\ntherapists are not or most therapists\nare not trained in psychopharmacology\nso they don't many of them don't\nyou know it's just not a part of their\ntraining so they don't prescribe\nmedications so you've got to be really\ncareful like I personally think so I'm\nsort of like\nso I tend to be all about holistic\nmedicine and all that good stuff but I\nthink science is important and data is\nimportant\nand that there you the therapists may\nhave a good reason for saying what they\nkind of say\nand but you know I think that like this\nis really something that your clinicians\nshould be talking about you can also ask\nthem for their understanding of like\nview of myself as a mental patient I\ndon't know if you view yourself as a\nmental patient but that can be harmful"
