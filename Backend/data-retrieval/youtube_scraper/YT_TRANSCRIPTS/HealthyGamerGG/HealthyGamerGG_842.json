    "transcript": "and so what I tend to do is I have these\nnegative thoughts and throughout my day\nI push them to the side I push them away\nI push them away I push them away\nand so the moment I wake up\nI haven't built any barriers yet so what\nhappens they come flooding back into my\nmind first thing in the morning does\nanyone have a morning routine to start\nthe day I get bombarded with negative\nthoughts the moment I wake up I get\nbombarded with negative thoughts does\nanyone have a morning routine to start\nthe day off we're going to talk about is\nwhat to do if you wake up in the morning\nand you're bombarded with negative\nthoughts so the first thing to\nunderstand is that early morning\nAwakening and a very very high amount of\nnegative thoughts first thing in the\nmorning are the most is one of the most\nspecific signs for a mood disorder and\nespecially a depressive episode so let's\nexplain that for a second what do I mean\nby specific signs so in medicine we have\ncertain things that are sensitive in\ncertain things that are specific so\nthings that are sensitive are things\nthat people are likely to have if they\nhave a particular disease but they're\nnot very specific so I'll give you all\nan example let's look at something like\nconcentration difficulties concentration\ndifficulties are not specific to\ndepression so so if I have difficulty\nwith concentrations I could have a major\ndepressive episode I could have ADHD I\ncould be high on a substance I may be\nphysically ill I may have schizophrenia\nthere are all kinds of reasons why I\nwould have difficulty with concentration\nso that's not a specific sign for\ndepression early morning Awakening and\nespecially having lots of negative\nthoughts early in the morning is pretty\nspecific even low mood throughout the\nday for example can be common in in\ngrief or it can be common in things like\neven cancer for example physical\nillnesses but specifically waking up\nvery early in the morning we're talking\n4 AM 5 a.m 6 a.m with a mind that's\nrunning very very high on negative\nthoughts it's like you wake up and\nyou're bombarded with negative thoughts\ncan actually be a specific sign of\ndepression so when I'm evaluating\npatients for depression one of the\nthings that I'll ask them is like okay\nso you're feeling sad and down about\nyourself and things like that what time\nof the day do you feel that and the more\nthey feel it kind of first thing in the\nmorning especially if they wake up at\n5am that makes me really concerned about\na clinical illness so if you fall into\nthat camp I'd highly recommend that you\nget clinically evaluated that being said\nthere are a lot of people who wake up\nfirst thing in the morning with a lot of\nnegative thoughts now that doesn't\nnecessarily mean that you have a\nclinical illness there are other reasons\nwhy we kind of do that so now what we're\ngoing to talk about is understand a cup\na little bit about what's going on in\nthe mind when you wake up with negative\nthoughts and what to do about it so\nsometimes we worry about stuff and when\nwe worry about stuff it's kind of hard\nto deal with it right so I don't know if\nthis kind of makes sense but worrying\nabout stuff doesn't necessarily solve\nproblems so if I'm anxious about\nsomething and I'm thinking oh my God\nlike are people going to invite me to\nthe party are they not going to invite\nme the party I can think about it I can\nthink about it I can think about it and\nat the end of those thoughts let's say\nan hour later is my anxiety been\nresolved have things been fixed no they\nhaven't right so worrying about things\nin the moment sometimes doesn't actually\nfix problems if it did fix problems no\none would have anxiety like or everyone\nwith anxiety would have perfect lives\nbecause worrying about stuff if it\nactually fix stuff like that would be\ngreat the first thing to understand\nabout worrying and especially worrying\nfirst thing in the morning it doesn't\nnecessarily do anything so why do we do\nit we do it because our brain is\nconcerned about a couple of things it's\nwarning us about a couple of things or\nsometimes we have negative self-attitude\nso we're thinking negative things about\nourself and then normally what happens\nor not normally but what happens\nnowadays is when we start to have\nnegative thoughts we tend to distract\nourselves from them so since thinking\nabout them doesn't actually solve the\nproblem what we end up doing is\ndistracting ourselves this becoming\neasier and easier with the availability\nof technology so once I start browsing\nsocial media I can distract myself from\nmy negative thoughts I can watch\nsomething I can play something I can do\nall kinds of different stuff to distract\nmyself from these negative thoughts and\nwhen I distract those negative thoughts\nwhat happens to them they actually go\ndormant they don't get fixed right so if\nI lack self-esteem or I'm worried that\npeople aren't going to invite me to a\nparty and I spend four hours playing a\nparticular video game at the end of\nthose four hours those thoughts come\nback and so then what happened if we\nthink about our days our days become\nfilled with distraction so now I'm going\nto play games for four hours I stopped\nfor a second the negative thoughts come\nback and now I need to do something else\nso I distract myself in another way I\ndistract myself in another way sometimes\nI distract myself with work sometimes I\ndistract myself I even will socialize\nright so even if I feel like I'm gonna\nbe alone for the rest of my life and I\nhave a group of buddies and we're all\ngoing to go out drinking tonight I can\ngo do some fun stuff but I never deal\nwith the problem and so what I tend to\ndo is I have these negative thoughts and\nthroughout my day I push them to the\nside I push them away I push them away I\npush them away and so the moment I wake\nup I haven't built any barriers yet so\nwhat happens they come flooding back\ninto my mind first thing in the morning\nso how do we deal with this what should\nwe not do and what should we do so the\nfirst thing to not do if you wake up\nwith negative thoughts in the morning is\nuse any kind of technology so it's so\neasy because Tech is so good at this\nstuff suppression of our amygdala in our\nlimbic system which is our emotional\ncircuitry our fear Center so social\nmedia memes video games Reddit whatever\nif I watch some kind of technology or\nengage in some kind of Technology it'll\nsuppress my emotional circuitry the\nworst thing about a lot of social media\nis that even if it suppresses your\ncircuitry in the short term over the\nlong term it actually worsens your\nmental health so there's been studies\nthat show that the more time you spend\non social media things like Facebook or\nInstagram or Reddit or whatever the\nworse your mental health becomes over\ntime and that taking a break or reducing\nyour social media or technology usage\nimproves mental health over time now the\nchallenge though is that's overtime\nright I I'd put it to you this way let's\nsay that there's even data that shows\nthat for example having two drinks a\nweek two alcoholic beverages a week\ncorrelates with improvements in mental\nhealth and some people are really\nconfused by that they're like how is how\ncan drinking help with your mental\nhealth and it turns out there's a\nconfounding variable what kind of person\ndrinks two drinks a week what is the\nsetting in which you have two drinks a\nweek it's almost always social so once a\nweek I'm gonna go meet up with a friend\nI know my limit so I'm gonna have like\ntwo beers with dinner we're gonna hang\nout for a while and then we're gonna go\nour separate ways I'm gonna go to bed on\ntime it's not like we're out there\ngetting hammered so two drinks a week\nactually correlates with social social\nactivity and that's what's responsible\nfor the Improvement in mental health and\nif we go to 10 drinks a week 12 drinks a\nweek 15 drinks a week then our mental\nhealth gets worse and worse and worse\nand social media in that same way when\nwe use it temporarily if I'm having a\nreally rough week and I spend two hours\na week playing video games to kind of\ndistract myself kind of cool off a\nlittle bit after a tense day that can\nactually be helpful because I want to\nsuppress those emotional circuits\nbecause the rest of the week I'm\nactually dealing with my problems but as\ntechnology uses Rises and Rises and\nrises even though it's suppressing in\nthe short term it can make things worse\nin the long term so if you have negative\nthoughts first thing in the morning most\nimportant thing is don't slip into\ntechnology usage because what that's\ngoing to do is push it away and then\nit'll come roaring back later second\nthing and this is going to sound kind of\nweird is don't try to fix the problem\nwhen you're feeling bad and y'all may be\nkind of confused by that you're like\nwhat do you mean don't isn't like when\nam I supposed to like fix the problem so\nlet's understand this is really\nimportant so let's say I've got negative\nthoughts\nand I wake up first thing in the morning\nand here are my four negative thoughts\nand so what we can do in the mind is we\ncan engage with negative thoughts right\nso let's say I'm let me just trying to\nfind something uh like an example so\nlet's say that I wake up in the morning\nand I think to myself no one really\ncares about me okay so that's this\nthought and then what I do is I start\nthinking okay no one really cares about\nme and then I start thinking about it\nwell like or I'm feeling really lonely\nlet's say let's say I'm feeling lonely\nokay and I start thinking about this\nthought of loneliness and then I think\nokay well like if I'm feeling lonely\nwhy don't I go and socialize let me call\nup a friend of mine but if you're in a\nnegative frame of thought if this is the\nmindset that you're in when you think\nabout Solutions what does your mind\nactually say oh people don't\nwant to invite you right and you're like\noh like and so even though you can try\nto solve the problem it's kind of like\nthe more you engage with your negative\nthoughts and you start arguing with\nyourself and like the negative thoughts\ngrow and grow and grow and let's say\nlike you fight that thought for a little\nwhile you're like oh no I don't want to\ntrust that people really do love me let\nme text someone so you text someone\nfirst thing in the morning hey you want\nto hang out this weekend at 9am and then\nthey don't respond in 15 minutes then\nhow do you feel they don't care about me\ndoes this make sense so oftentimes what\nwe'll discover is that when you have\nnegative thoughts first thing in the\nmorning and you engage with them these\nthoughts the more you engage with them\nthe more they actually start to spiral\nand then you're kind of stuck in this\nlike negative thought Loop where you're\nspiraling in negativity and this is the\nkey thing to understand so when you wake\nup in the morning and you have negative\nthoughts you want to fix them but I\ndon't know if this kind of makes sense\nbut in that frame of mind you can't\neffectively fix them if that worked you\nwe wouldn't be in this problem in the\nfirst place in fact engaging with those\nnegative thoughts and trying to fix them\nin that moment actually makes things\nworse because you wake up and you think\nthrough that stuff you think you think\nyou think you think you think and the\nmore time you spend thinking the worse\nthat you feel until eventually what\nhappens is you hit the state of\ncognitive exhaustion where you're like\nah and you get out of bed and you go\ngrab your phone and then you distract\nyourself you push all the negative\nthoughts you push them to the side and\nnow we're going to focus on this stuff\nin the middle we're going to focus on\nthis stuff in the middle okay that's\nthere we go we're gonna focus on the\nstuff in the Middle with distraction and\nthen the second the distraction thought\nstops the thoughts are going to come\nrushing back so oddly enough don't try\nto fix things that's the second thing to\nbe careful about third thing is avoid\nsubstances so this is this kind of goes\nback to this distracting thing and is\nalmost in the same vein as\num you know avoiding technology but be\ncareful about things like getting high\nfirst thing in the morning and like\ngetting high when you're feeling bad and\nlike drinking and stuff like that\nbecause it's gonna just create more\nproblems down the road down the line\nespecially because substances are more\nlikely to put you into a negative frame\nof mind where you can actually spiral so\nthen the question is okay if I shouldn't\nuse technology don't try to fix the\nproblem and don't use substances what\nshould I do\nfirst thing you should do is go for a\nwalk\nso this is key when we're in this Frame\nof Mind where we've got some weird\nThoughts The Right Move is to not engage\nwith them and let them spiral but we\nwhat we actually want to do instead is\nkind of let them fizzle out so we don't\nwant to distract ourselves by pushing\nthem to the side but when we go for a\nwalk or there are other things that you\ncan do so what I would say is go for a\nwalk or clean something there's this\nweird effect when we clean things or\nwhen we go for a walk is that like the\nthoughts don't we're not really pushing\nthem away we're sort of letting them be\nthere but we're not engaging with them\nand I don't know if you all have\nexperienced this but like when you clean\nstuff and when you go for a walk your\nmind will start to wander so what sort\nof happens is the energy in the mind\nstarts to kind of like dissipate you\nstart just naturally thinking about like\nother stuff so now you've got two\nthoughts left that are bad but then you\nstart thinking about other things right\nand then you've got like two kind of\nneutral thoughts and then as you keep\nwalking\nwhat's going to happen is you're going\nto get one bad thought and then a couple\ngood ones and then eventually that bad\nthought will go away and then you're\njust kind of like thinking about okay\nwhat do I need to do today and the key\nthing there is that in this moment you\nhaven't engaged with the thoughts you\ncan kind of think through them a little\nbit you're not going to try to solve\nthem you're just going to let whatever\nyou're going to let them kind of like\nit's almost like I don't know if you all\nhave seen like a dog shaking off water\nafter it's been in the rain or whatever\nbut like that's kind of what we're doing\nin our mind anytime we clean or anytime\nwe go for a walk the third thing\nto do with negative thoughts assign a\ntime to deal with them\nso remember we said we don't want to fix\nthem now but sometimes we have to\naddress them but what we want to do is\napproach them from a clear head and\nmethodically so this is like literally\nwhat happens in therapy so what's really\ncool about therapy and I've seen this\nthis change a lot is that sometimes I'll\nnotice a shift in my patients where they\nlearn that they can take their negative\nthoughts they've got a box over here\nthey wake up in the morning with\nnegative thoughts here's day one here's\nday two\nand let's say here's day three when\ntheir boss gets mad at them and what\nthey actually learn over time is they're\nlike oh okay like I'm feeling bad right\nnow I'm going to talk about this with Dr\nK on Thursday next day they wake up\nthey're like I feel this way right now\nI'm gonna talk with Dr K about this on\nThursday I'm feeling this way right now\nI'm gonna talk with Dr K about this on\nThursday\nand then what happens when they come\ninto my office\nis we're like cool okay let's break\nthese walls down let's let all that crap\nout we're gonna let it all out and we're\ngonna kind of deal with it methodically\none at a time and so what we can almost\ndo is compartmentalize dealing with our\nproblems and the key thing that when you\nwhen you assign a time is that when\nyou're clear-headed you can actually fix\nstuff you'll get that the biggest\nproblem here is that when we are\nemotionally active and we're not\nclear-headed it makes it even harder to\nfix the problems even though the problem\nseems so in our face when we let it set\nit down put it aside and then approach\nit with a clear head suddenly Things\nbecome so much easier and so one of the\nbiggest advantages of therapy is is sure\nyou can have a clinician who's trained\nin a bunch of stuff and that's fantastic\ndon't get me wrong it's a great\nevidence-based intervention but half of\nthe advantage of therapy is just\nlearning how to compartmentalize and\nthen approaching problems in sort of a\ncalm way and the nice thing about a\ntherapist is that you've got someone\nthere who's going to keep you from\nspiraling and guide you in hopefully a\nproductive manner but the major\nprinciple here is that assigning a time\ndeal deal with them so then what I'm\nfeeling pretty good about myself maybe\nbefore I have lunch I'm gonna sit down\nwith a piece of paper and I'm gonna like\nthink through those thoughts I'm gonna\ntry to summon them I'm gonna pick one\nthing okay people don't like me okay and\nthen let me try to socialize okay let me\nsend a text and then even in that moment\nyou're going to kind of acknowledge for\na moment that okay like if I send a text\nthey may not get back to me right away\nthat's okay do I need to find and then\nwhen they don't when they don't respond\nif you're kind of really in a clear\nframe of mind do I need different\nfriends\ninstead of it suddenly being if they\ndon't respond to you it's not a\nshortcoming of you it could be a\nshortcoming of them but when you're in\nthis negative headspace and there are\npeople who are neglectful of you in life\nit's never their fault because in this\nnegative headspace in your spiral it's\nalways your fault and so when you have\nnegative thoughts first thing in the\nmorning I'd say very Simply Clean go for\na walk don't use technology don't use\nsubstances and don't try to solve the\nproblems instead assign a separate time\nwhere you're of clear ahead to approach\nwhatever your concerns are and when\npeople do this something magical starts\nto happen may not happen overnight but\nover time you'll have fewer and fewer\nand fewer negative thoughts in the\nmorning because when we engage I don't\nknow if this makes sense but when we\nengage with the negative thoughts in the\nmorning we actually ramp them up do you\nall get that like one thought leads to\nanother thought leads to another thought\nlike this this grows when I start\nthinking these and then it grows and\ngrows and grows and grows and grows and\nthen I feel overwhelmed then what\nhappens is if I'm engaging with my\nthoughts in the morning\nokay so I'll draw one last thing to\nillustrate this so I have four bad\nthoughts and then I engage with them and\nit becomes five six seven eight nine ten\nwhatever\nand now here's the key thing when I\ndistract myself and I push all these\nthoughts to the outside of my mind how\nmany are left and now tomorrow morning\nwhen I wake up how many thoughts\nnegative thoughts am I gonna have I have\nmore than what I started with right and\nthen I'm going to engage with these I'm\ngoing to create more and more and more\nand more and more and then I'm gonna\nhave more the next day and more the next\nday and more the next day because I'm\nspending all this cognitive energy\nnothing is actually getting fixed so\ndon't engage with your negative thoughts\nwhen you're a negative frame of mind set\nit aside for later and honestly when\npeople start doing this when you start\ncontrolling\nhow and when your mind thinks a\nparticular way\nthat's when your mind starts to get\npurified and last thing just to keep in\nmind is remember we started that\nsometimes earlier morning Awakening is\nactually a sign of a clinical illness so\nI'd recommend getting evaluated if you\nfall into that category if you
