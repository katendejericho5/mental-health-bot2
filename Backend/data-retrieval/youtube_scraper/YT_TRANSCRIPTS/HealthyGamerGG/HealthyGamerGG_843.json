    "transcript": "if I recruit someone for your fancy\nrehab what that kind of means is that\nI'm gonna get a kickback also you'll\nhave different rehabs that will kind of\nkeep patients there because they want to\nstay full they want to make money\nthere's all kinds of really shady stuff\ngoing on and I wish I could say I'm just\na conspiracy theorist here but\nunfortunately that's really not the case\nlet's talk a little bit about rehab\ncenters so I want to talk to you about\nrehab centers because I think that in a\nsense rehab centers seem to be this the\ngold standard for overcoming addiction\nright when we see people who are\nstruggling with addiction when we're\nthinking about addictions even\ncelebrities or or people like that\nthey'll say like oh this person is in\nrehab so when addictions kind of get out\nof control the idea is that the best\nthing that we can do is go to rehabs now\nthere are a couple of things that are\nkind of interesting about rehab centers\nso I've worked in in a couple of rehab\ncenters myself I really enjoy kind of\nworking there I'm going to share that a\nlittle bit with y'all later but\nunfortunately there are a lot of things\nthat are not ideal about rehabs centers\nand some things that are actually wrong\nand I'd love to talk to you all about\nthat today\nso part of the reason that I want to\ntalk about this is that if you think\nabout people who are struggling with\naddiction what usually happens is we\nlike struggle for a while we try to get\nit under control we try to cut back you\nknow our family our loved ones friends\npeople sort of tell us hey like you need\nto get this under control you need to\ncut back whatever so you try a little\nbit of this maybe you sign up to see a\ntherapist maybe you call a psychiatrist\nthey give you an appointment out in 2023\nyou know which is like six months away\nwhatever and so we try to do a lot of\nstuff to overcome addictions we watch\nvideos on the internet like whatever and\nit seems to not work a lot of times or\nwe'll get a lot of pressure for family\nand sometimes family is like incredibly\ndesperate right so especially with some\nof these like like there's a there's an\nopioid crisis in the United States right\nnow A lot of people are overdosing\num things like heroin and other drugs\nare getting cut with fentanyl people\nalso have struggled with alcohol and\nstuff like that for a long time you know\nthere are all kinds of problems that\nthese substances will create addictions\nwill create they'll destroy marriages\nthey'll cause p people to lose their\njobs they'll you know cause people to\nbecome physically hurt and accidents\nhave you know physical side effects get\nHIV from sharing needles there are all\nkinds of high stakes when it comes to\naddiction and so what we've got is\npeople who are struggling to handle this\non their own or handle it at home and\nthen we've got a bunch of people who\nreally really care about you and the\nstakes are really high and sometimes\nincluding death right so what that sort\nof creates is the system where people so\nwhat that creates is an incentive to to\nsort of start residential treatment and\nresidential treatment is like a 30-day\nrehab or two-week rehab or whatever and\nyou're gonna go there and they're gonna\nfix you and you've got lots of loved\nones who are who really need you to be\nfixed right and you yourself need to\nturn around your life you can't be\naddicted anymore so since it's intensive\nyou go there you stay there for 30 days\nthat makes it expensive and since\nfrankly people are desperate that makes\nit expensive so I've worked at rehabs\nI've Heard lots of stories about this\nfrom patients you know even in my\noutpatient practice they'll do things\nlike mortgage their house they'll do\nthings like take out loans they'll do\ngofundme's they'll they'll raise money\nthey'll say raise thirty thousand\ndollars fifty thousand dollars I've\nheard of some rehabs even caused causing\na hundred costing a hundred thousand\ndollars for one month of treatment and\npeople are actually willing to pay it\nthe reason they're willing to pay it is\nbecause they're desperate right this is\nlike we're talking about life and death\nhere so I've seen parents that were\ntalking about my son's life and in order\nto save his life we're willing to spend\nseventy thousand dollars for one month\nof treatment to get this under control\nand so when we've got a a vulnerable\npopulation when we've got a desperate\npopulation when we've got high stakes\nand a high intensity of treatment that\nleads to a lot of money and this is\nwhere unfortunately what I've seen is a\nlot of rehabs that I think don't really\ndo a good job now part of the reason\nthey I like to believe that part of the\nreason they don't do a good job is\nbecause is not like predatory in nature\nI like to think that they they think\nthey're doing the best they can or they\nhave particular beliefs about what makes\nthe best rehab kind of treatment but\nunfortunately the truth is that a lot of\nthese places are actually quite\npredatory and so I've seen so I worked\nat two uh rehabs predominantly one was\nan insurance-based rehab that you know\npatients pay very little or almost\nnothing out of pocket so it's kind of a\ndifferent sort of place a lot more\npatience I was responsible for 28 to 29\npatients usually on a given uh on a\ngiven day so over the course of let's\nsay one week maybe like 10 of them will\nleave and I'll get 10 new patients so\nI'm caring for about 40 patients a week\nthe other rehab that I worked at was a\nprivate pay rehab that cost a lot more\nwas one of these like really nice both\nof them were actually in really\nbeautiful locations but had really nice\nfacilities I took care of like CEOs and\nand other like important people\ncelebrities stuff like that that place\nwas a way higher price tag there were\nmaybe about 10 patients there at a given\ntime so about a third to 25 percent of\nthe size and what I really found what I\nheard from a lot of those CEOs is that\nthey've been to other rehabs and their\nexperience is that they go to this\nreally nice place that's like out in\nFlorida right where they like it's on\nthe beach they go there everyone's\nreally caring they get massages it's\nkind of this luxury rehab where it's\nfocused on like wellness there's a lot\nof meditation and a lot of yoga and like\nwe're gonna kind of like sober you up\nover 30 days you're gonna do like some\nkind of work but it's it's almost like\nthis luxury vacation kind of rehab thing\nand the basic problem is that people\nwill become sober over 30 days and why\nwill they become sober because they're\nin a facility where you're being watched\n24 7. right so you wake up in the\nmorning and there's something going on\nand you go to bed at night and there's\nsomething going on you you stay in this\nparticular room you don't leave the\ncampus at all you have no access to\ndrugs or alcohol so over the course of\n30 days it's really easy to get sober\nwhen it's impossible to physically use\nthen what happens is these rehabs do\nvery little Aftercare and we'll talk\nabout that what that means later but in\nthe worst case is what they'll kind of\ndo is like you feel great right after\ndetoxing and being pampered for 30 days\nyou feel amazing you've got a nice tan\nyou're going swimming every day you're\ndoing yoga you feel mentally really\nreally really well and so you're like\nwow I feel amazing I've conquered this\naddiction and then you go back out you\ngo home with very little Aftercare right\nso there's not really much of a plan in\nplace work stress starts building up\nhome stress starts building up you\nhaven't really done a whole lot of deep\nemotional work you basically we took a\n30-day vacation and so three months\nlater you're back to using again back to\ndrinking all that kind of stuff comes\nback so a lot of these rehabs will\ncreate an artificial environment where\nlike it's really easy to be sober and\nthen they'll send you back into their\nenvironment where you crash and then\nwhat happens what happens is that now\nafter you crash a year later people are\nlike man things were so good when you\ncame back to that place and you yourself\nrealize man I felt so good when I left I\njust screwed up so what am I going to do\nI'm gonna go back pay another seventy\nthousand dollars because it worked so\nwell right and at the end of 30 days you\nfeel amazing you're like wow this is it\nthis time I'm gonna do it and you kind\nof go back out maybe you're sober for a\ncouple months and then you kind of\nrelapse so some of these places\nunfortunately I do think it's part of\ntheir business model we'll look at some\ndata in a minute that actually\nencourages people to like come back\nright and I know that sometimes there\nare conspiracy theorists out there\nthat'll say like oh like doctors want to\nkeep people sick because that's how they\nmake money my experience as a doctor has\nbeen that there's way way way more\npatients out there than I will ever be\nable to see and that I can help people\nget better and there's no shortage of\npeople needing medical care I I really\ndon't think that's true for most people\nin medicine and I even don't think\nthat's true for the majority of rehabs\nI'd like to think I don't like I I don't\nthink they try to keep people dependent\non their services but I do think that\nfor some of these places they actually\ndon't prioritize long-term sobriety what\nthey really prioritize is creating a\nreally awesome 30-day experience and it\nturns out that this is not just me kind\nof thinking this right so it's not just\nconspiracy theories so let's actually\nlook so in the New Jersey state\nlegislature there's actually an\ninvestigation they this happened\num let me see if I can find the exact\ndate so this happened 10 10 days ago\nokay so these kinds of practices have\nbeen going on for a long time there's a\nlot of money to be made in addictions\nbecause people are desperate so let's\ntake a listen to the New Jersey state\nlegislatures state Commission on of\nInvestigation on rehabs let's hear what\nthey actually kind of say okay so this\nis like a committee that is they're\ngoing to publish a report probably in\nthe next couple of days so this is not\njust Dr K's opinion on on things this is\nlike literally the results of\nInvestigation let's take a look it's in\nthe federal government and it makes it\neasy for unethical practices to exploit\npeople who are already in a vulnerable\nsituation frequently with little\nconsequence and it can be an\noverwhelming time in an unclear time to\nnavigate the addiction Rehabilitation\nprocess we'll listen to about two\nminutes of this so the recovery industry\ntheoretically exists to help people\novercome their addictions and get them\nback to healthy and productive lives so\nlisten to that the theora the uh the\nrecovery system theoretically exists to\nhelp people with their addictions and\nget back to their lives right but the\nreality\nhelped them recover and rebuild their\nlives\noh my God\ncomes more\nfocus and the remuneration rather than\nhealing broken lives fueling this\nvicious cycle is often immoral and\nillegal practices that you'll hear about\ntoday one known as patient brokering\nwhere corrupt players in the industry\nsteer patients to a specific Treatment\nCenter in exchange for some sort of\nfinancial payoff and this system is\ngrowing increasingly and it's getting\nmore sophisticated as Brokers are\nfinding ways to circumvent laws and\nbanning practices and operating within\ngray areas of the law as well so you'll\nhear testimony today about the type of\ncare patients are receiving for\naddiction treatment and how it may not\nbe based on the services the individual\nactually needs in order to recover from\ntheir dependence and the quality of\ntheir private insurance coverage may\nplay more of a role than the quality of\ncare that they need and you'll also hear\ntestimony today about this is important\noperators and Recovery industry\nemployees here in New Jersey who engage\nin potentially unlawful practices to\nensure patients have extended Insurance\npaid stays at their facility some\nmanipulate drug tests or keep patients\nin the most intensive level of treatment\neven if no longer necessary for\nprolonged periods of time so we're going\nto pause there they go on to this talk\nabout a lot of stuff but like basically\nwhat this commission is discovering is\nthat so like we said there's there's big\nmoney to be made right so what's\nactually happening is people will like\nif I recruit someone for your fancy\nrehab what that kind of means is that\nI'm going to get a kickback also you'll\nhave different rehabs that will kind of\nkeep patients there because they want to\nstay full they want to make money\nthere's all kinds of really shady stuff\ngoing on and I wish I could say I'm just\na conspiracy theorist here but\nunfortunately that's really not the case\nand there seems to be actually a lot of\ndata\nthat there are a lot of problems with\naddiction recovery so what I'd love to\ndo today is go through a couple of\nthings first is explain a little bit\nabout why addiction rehabs don't\nconsistently have good outcomes is a\nfield second thing I want to do today is\ntalk about the different kinds of rehabs\nthat I've sort of seen and you can blend\nthem a little bit so like why are things\nwhy are things the way they are right\nnow what are the different kinds of\nrehabs I want to share with you all a\nlittle bit about like what actually\nhappens in rehab so what are the stages\nof rehab and like what what is like\nsuccessful rehab treatment look like\nthen I want to share with you all the\nfour things that in my experience as a\nclinician like if we take one patient\nwho's successful in one patient who\nisn't successful what's the difference\nand what is a successful course kind of\nlook like and what is an unsuccessful\ncourse look like and hopefully what\nwe'll do is equip you all with some\ninformation so that if you ever do need\nto seek a Addiction Rehab treatment or a\nloved one needs to seek rehab treatment\nthat you're equipped with some\ninformation so that you can sort of tell\nwho's good and who is that because\nunfortunately what happens is a lot of\npeople will be like yeah we're really\nexpensive we've got we're really great\nwe've got this beautiful facility we'll\nmake things work you know 99 of people\nare sober when they leave and and so\nlike you don't really know right so like\nthese people seem to know what they're\ntalking about they're wearing fancy\nsuits they're charging a lot of money\nyou know they're they're talking a big\ngame so like let's mortgage our house\nand send our son so let's start with why\nare things why is it hard to sort of\ntell what makes a residential treatments\nactually let me scrap that question so\nlet's start with this which is why is it\nthat there are a bunch of rehabs out\nthere and we're not clear first of all\nwhether they work really well or you\nknow what works and what doesn't so the\nfirst thing that we have to understand\nis that research on addiction rehabs is\nvery very very crappy to be blunt so\neven if you look at the number of\nstudies that are published there are\nvery very few peer-reviewed studies they\ntend to have very very low quality\nevidence and why is that it's because a\nstudy that that involves measuring\nsomeone for 30 days and then following\nthem for a year is really really hard to\ndo the other thing that I think is a\nlittle bit nefarious is that I think\nsome of these rehabs don't have a vested\ninterest in actually having third\nparties look at their outcomes right\nbecause they may not actually be very\ngood so it's really hard to study\nResidential Treatment the other issue\nthat we tend to have is that rehabs tend\nto be quite different and a lot of them\nare not really very evidence-based to\nbegin with so a lot of rehabs will be\nbased on 12-step kind of models and\nwe'll look at some data on that and\n12-step models can be really good they\ncan help a lot of people but they don't\nnecessarily work for everyone and\nthey're not necessarily the standard of\ncare when it comes to addiction\ntreatment so part of the reason that\naddiction rehabs are the way they are is\nfirst of all it's really hard to study\nthem and secondly there's a lot of stuff\nthat they do that is not really like\nscientifically based so let's take a\ncouple of a look at a couple of papers\nabout rehabs okay and then we'll kind of\nillustrate this so first the\neffectiveness of residential treatment\nservices for individuals of substance\nuse disorders a systematic review let's\nkind of look at their major findings\nokay with caution results suggest that\nthe best practice Rehabilitation\ntreatment integrates mental health\ntreatment and provides continuity of\ncare post discharge so this is what I've\nkind of discovered as a as a provider is\nyou can do whatever you want to for 30\ndays but unless you fix their outside\nenvironment or help them with the\noutside environment that they're going\nback to the chance of relapse is very\nvery very high okay so even then if we\nkind of look at this so between January\n13 and December 2018 so over five years\nthere were only 23 studies published\nworldwide in the English language on\nrehabs which is a very very low level of\nof uh studies eight were\nmethodologically strong five were\nmoderate and ten were weak so we've only\ngot eight studies on rehabs over a\nfive-year period so it's hard to study\nand what we kind of know that the one\nbig takeaway is Aftercare which we'll\nget\nso now I'm going to share with you all\nsomething from I think this is from Jama\nor nejam so Journal of the American\nMedical Association so first let's start\nwith this there's something called\nopioid Agonist treatment which if\nsomeone is addicted to opioids like\nheroin the standard of care is to\nactually provide uh an analog of an\nopiate that people can sort of maintain\nso they don't go through withdrawal and\ndon't have cravings and stuff like that\nbut it's hard to abuse so there's this\nmedication called Suboxone which makes\nit hard for it to be like injected and\nstuff like that it's chemically a little\nbit different but the key thing is that\nthe standard of care for opioid use\ndisorder like according to all the\nscience we have the most effective\ntreatment for opioid use disorder is\nopioid assisted treatment okay now for\npeople kind of saying like Okay but wait\nif I'm if I'm prescribed an opioid and I\nhave like a heroin addiction isn't that\njust like replacing one addiction with\nanother and the answer is sort of but\ngenerally not really so my experience is\nthat you got to give someone something\nin a controlled way in a measured way so\nthey can't use more they're not\nnecessarily using less and then like\nwhen someone struggles with addiction\nusually their life is falling apart and\nit's really hard to get a job and fix\nyour relationships and stuff like that\nwhen you're dealing with Cravings every\nsingle day so opioid assisted treatment\nand this is according to the data right\nthis is what seems to work the best my\nexperience with opioid assistant\ntreatment is that I'll use it for some\namount of time and then eventually when\nthey sort of get their life settled I\nwill Advocate or at least have a\ndiscussion for getting off of opioid\nAgonist therapy and if they want to stay\non it that's okay but I'll be like okay\nhey if things are stable like what do\nyou think about this like now that one\nyear out you've got a stable job your\nmarriage is repaired you're done with\nfamily counseling what do you think\nabout stopping this medication now and\nwe'll kind of have an ongoing discussion\nand hopefully eventually I I'm as a\npsychiatrist I advocate for the minimum\npossible medication use sometimes people\nneed it and that's totally fine so\nlet's take a look at the standard of\nevidence the standard of care best\navailable evidence for what is effective\nat helping heroin addicts get off of\nheroin nationally 107 programs 29\noffered opioid Agonist therapy uh with\nthe option of continued maintenance an\nadditional 31 offered opioid assisted\ntherapy for short-term detoxification\nwhich we'll get to in a second 60 of\npeople will offer opioid uh Agnes\ntherapy 39 did not offer opioid Agonist\ntherapy in 78 programs 21 actively\ndiscourage the use of opioid Agnes\ntherapy so this is really interesting\nright because what this is sort of\nsuggesting is that 60 percent of people\nare unclear may not necessarily use it\nor will actively discourage the best\nscientifically valid treatment for\naddiction right I want you all to think\nabout that for a second now there are\ngood arguable good reasons for this so\nalmost all programs offered some form of\n12-step program right so 92 percent 92\npercent of rehabs will offer some\n12-step component and in the 12-step\ntradition many of those people are very\nvery anti-agonist therapy these are not\nscientists though they're not medical\ndoctors they're not doesn't mean that\nthey don't have value they bring a lot\nto the table and 12-step programs have\nbeen shown to be effective at helping\npeople overcome addiction but oftentimes\nthose kinds of things will Clash so the\nbest rehabs and we'll get to this in a\nsecond that I've seen sort of offer a\nspectrum and really try to create an\nindividualized approach the downside\nthat I've seen with 12-step programs a\nlot of these people are believers right\nthey're like AAA is the only way and\nthey start with it's very kind of like a\nlot of it will have like religious\nconnotations to it and there's like a\nhigher power and it's sort of based on\nlike the Christian ethos and things like\nthat and like a lot of them are like\nreally really hard liners and it's kind\nof my way or the highway and if it's not\nworking for you the reason is because\nyou're not trying hard enough that's my\ncomplaint with some people who do\n12-step stuff is that they don't\nacknowledge that hey maybe it's like our\nintervention could be better they don't\nacknowledge that if it if there's a\nfailure it means you're not working hard\nenough next thing so this is a paper\num that talks a little bit about you\nknow what are the components to success\nin recovery so let's take a quick look\nat that so good rehabs will provide\ninformation and skills promote a working\nAlliance what does that mean that means\nthat we're going to work together\naddiction is not something that you have\nto conquer on your own we're going to\nhelp you it's a team effort uh role\nmodeling recovery so this is really\ninteresting but like what does it mean\nto be sober what would your life be like\nto be sober what does it look like to be\nsober and having people in that you can\nkind of look up to and sort of see like\noh this person has their life together\nthey maintain their relationships they\nhave a job that they find fulfilling\nthey're like in good touch with their\nkids that's really important at helping\npeople become sober and this is really\nimportant increasing choice right so\nlike this is where if we look at kind of\nthe the science on what leads to\nsuccessful recovery giving empowering\npeople who are struggling with addiction\nwith Choice actually correlates with\nincreased recovery and the challenge\nhere is that when we go back to some of\nthese 12-step programs right this is not\n78 of people don't give patients a\nchoice it's our way or the highway and\nsince we don't have good data on these\nkinds of things and they're not really\nvery well regulated like a lot of people\nare doing what they think is best and I\nkind of don't fault them for that but a\nlot of it is frankly like pretty\nineffective that's kind of a quick\nreview of The Evidence why are things as\nbad as they are I think that's we've\nsort of seen why because a lot of these\nrehabs are not actually based in science\nthey're kind of based in peer recovery\nwhich is really important it's a really\nimportant aspect of the model but what\nwe sort of know is that creating a\npersonalized tailored approach to\nrecovery because it worked for a\nthousand people does not mean it worked\nfor you and the most success that I've\nseen in addiction recovery is when we\nsort of create a personalized approach\nso now let's take a quick look at the\ntypes of rehabs okay so this is just\nlike according to Dr K so in my\nexperience\nthere are multiple types of rehabs the\nfirst is an evidence-based rehab so this\nis where I know it sounds kind of weird\nbut they use things like science they\noffer medical treatment\nokay so I worked at two evidence-based\nrehabs so maybe I'm biased there but you\nknow it's the reason I work there is\nbecause there's data that shows that\nit's the best way to do things and and\nso what that sort of means is that like\nyou know you're going to see a\npsychiatrist you're going to see a\ntherapist they'll teach you\nevidence-based techniques like\nmindfulness maybe motivational\ninterviewing the people will there will\nbe trained in scientifically valid\ntechniques that help people overcome\naddiction second kind of rehab that we\nhave is a 12-step program\nnow these are not mutually exclusive but\nsome of these will be very very\nevidence-based and have minimal on on\n12-step stuff whereas a lot of places\nwill be heavy heavy on 12-step stuff and\nwill actually discourage evidence-based\nmedicine as we already saw so these are\nrehabs that are oftentimes started by\npeople who are are in recovery\nthemselves so I struggled with addiction\nfor 30 years I've been sober now for 20\nyears I want to make it my life's work\nto help other people which is totally\ngreat love that mission love that you\nwant to give back and they create a\nprogram The Challenge is that you can\nyou can learn a lot from personal\nexperience but I think that it's not as\neffective as combining science with peer\nsupport even in terms of what we do at\nhealthy Gamers so we've sort of built in\non this kind of peer support program\nlike our coaching program is a peer\nsupport program which is what the United\nNations kind of recommends World Health\nOrganization recommends we sort of see\nthat these have value but they shouldn't\nbe done exclusively especially when it\ncomes to treating diseases That's my\nkind of opinion here Third Kind of rehab\nthat we have is the luxury rehab and\nwhat does the luxury rehab these are\nplaces that are not even like 12-stepish\nthey may have 12-step stuff but they're\nnot like hardcore 12-step programs these\nare places that are essentially like\n30-day vacations right so they're like\nmore like wellness Spas they may have a\ndoctor but the doctor or therapist are\ngoing to have like an excellent bedside\nManner and may not necessarily offer\nlike good clinical care right so some of\nthem do some of them don't and we're not\nsaying that there aren't evidence-based\nluxury rehabs as well but some of these\nplaces are going to focus on like yoga\nand the key thing about these luxury\nplaces is that you're kind of enforced\nsobriety\nso you're going to get sober because you\nhave no choice but they're not going to\nbuild skills they're not going to do the\ndeep emotional work that is necessary\nwe're going to give you a really nice\nvacation where you can recharge and then\nwhen you go back there's a decent chance\nyou're going to relapse and you had such\na positive experience here you could\ngive us 5 out of 5 Stars so you're going\nto come back and we're going to get\nourselves another 70k easy\nokay now you can blend these so there\nare like I said I worked at One\nInsurance Place uh one sort of Cheaper\nrehab and one really expensive rehab\nthat had some of these luxury things so\nlike they were you know they had yoga\nand stuff in the morning which is\ntotally fine I'm not you know I'm\nclearly not against yoga but you really\nwant like a blend of this stuff and some\npeople are more focused on the luxury\nthan they are on the evidence-based side\nso next up we're going to talk about\nwhat happens when you're trying to get\nsober so the first thing to understand\nis the first step of sobriety is detox\nso this is detox is usually a\nphysiologic and psychologic thing so\nwhen we're addicted to a substance a\nsubstance does two things for uh it has\ntwo kind of effects one it offers an\nemotional coping strategy\nso if we're feeling bad I can pop a pill\nand I can feel good\nbut then the other thing that happens as\nwe develop an addiction is we develop a\nphysiologic dependence and even if\nyou've never been addicted to a\nsubstance maybe I'll use caffeine right\nso you can think about someone who's\nlike addicted to caffeine like half the\npopulation is addicted to caffeine when\nthey wake up in the morning they feel\nnon-functional without caffeine so the\nfirst stage of sobriety is detox and\nthis is when your body is going through\na physiologic\nwithdrawal\nand this is so physically uh everything\nfrom painful to dangerous that people\nwill seek out the substance so for\nexample I've had a patient who has had\nstage four metastatic cancer and has\nbeen on chemotherapy and radiation\ntherapy and has like cancer pain in\ntheir bones and stuff like that and\nthey've been addicted to opiates so I\nwas asking them what's worse having\ncancer all through your body and pain\nand like taking these medications and\ngetting literally irradiated or going\nthrough opiate withdrawal and they said\n100 opioid withdrawal I'd I'd take\ncancer any day of the week over opioid\nwithdrawal so an opioid withdrawal you\nget really really nauseous you feel pain\nall over your body like your body just\nstarts to hurt\nyou can start to have diarrhea and\nsweatiness and your your like your nose\nis leaking all the time you've got the\nchills shakes it's apparently it just\nfeels absolutely awful and so when\npeople start to feel those things it can\nbe so physically impairing that like the\nonly relief you can get is from the\nopioid uh different kinds of substances\nwill create different kinds of\nwithdrawals so one thing that's really\nimportant to note is that alcohol\nwithdrawal and benzodiazepine withdrawal\nthese are medications like Xanax or\nvalium can actually be life-threatening\nso as our body goes through a\nphysiologic withdrawal from alcohol it\ncauses it can potentially cause seizures\nand arrhythmias so alcohol is a CNS\ncentral nervous system depressant\nand what that means is that it kind of\nuh suppresses our nerves yeah for it's\nan oversimplification\nand so what happens is when when we take\nthe alcohol away our nerves have adapted\nto alcohol being in the system and\nthey've kind of compensated for that so\nlet's say a nerve normally works over\nhere and then what what happens is we\nadd alcohol and when we add alcohol it\nsort of suppresses our our nervous\nfunction and then what happens over time\nis our brain adapts so we're back at\nBaseline right so this is what we think\nof as a functioning alcoholic they\nactually are drunk they're like they've\ngot a high blood alcohol level but they\nappear completely normal cognitively\nthey're normal you know like they're\ncompletely normal and so then when you\nremove the alcohol okay what ends up\nhappening is their nerves become\nhypersensitive because now we're\nremoving this depressant effect over\nhere\nand then when their nerves become\njittery they can actually have a seizure\nand can sometimes even go into into\ncardiac arrhythmias and and it can be\nlethal so detox feels awful for the most\npart and can also be like medically\ndangerous so sometimes detox has to\nhappen in a hospital a couple of other\nthings so when people talk about oh\nmarijuana isn't addictive part of what\nthey mean when people say marijuana\nisn't addictive is that we don't\ngenerally speaking develop a very strong\nphysiologic tolerance to marijuana\ndoesn't mean that it isn't\npsychologically addictive so we still\nkind of marijuana can be an emotional\ncoping strategy for sure but you're not\ngoing to have at least I don't have I've\nnever heard of anyone having seizures\nafter like withdrawing from marijuana\nokay\nso that's stage one is detox so usually\nthe detox stage lasts anywhere between\nlet's say three and seven days it\ndepends on what you're detoxing from and\nduring that time it's like hard to do\nlike much therapy and things like that\nbecause physically you just feel awful\nso usually detox needs to be managed\nmedically so when I'm helping patients\nwith opioid detox I'll give them various\nmedications so like I'll give them like\nloperamide so that they don't have\ndiarrhea 15 times a day so we try to\nmake the the the detox as manageable as\npossible sometimes when people are\ndetoxing off of alcohol we'll use things\nlike benzodiazepines to help them safely\ndetox off of it so you'll administer\nthings like lorazepam and other kinds of\nmedications to prevent people from\nhaving seizures and stuff like that and\nyou kind of detox them off hopefully\npretty smooth\nthe second stage is kind of our\nresidential treatment\nand this is when we start doing things\nlike therapy right because now your\ndetox your physiologically kind of back\nto square one so you can start doing\nthings like therapy you're you're\nstarting to like build skills we'll talk\nabout what this what this kind of stuff\nis so this is like the 30-day rehab part\nright so maybe you detox at a different\nfacility and then you go to a 30-day\nrehab but generally speaking let's say\nwe're going to do this for about three\nweeks and so that's like when you're\ndoing the work of rehab you're going to\ndifferent groups you're talking about\nyour feelings you're talking about\nsubstances maybe you're going to 12-step\nmeetings you're learning how to meditate\nyou're doing you're getting therapized\nmaybe now that the substances are out of\nyour system now a psychiatrist can\nactually like diagnose you with\nsomething because you can't diagnose\nsomeone with a mood disorder if they're\nactively using substances so maybe\nyou're bipolar maybe you're not maybe\nit's all the cocaine and alcohol that\nyou're using that makes you look bipolar\nwhereas you're not actually bipolar but\nonce you get kind of cleared out once\nthe substance is clear out of your body\nthen what the doctor can do is evaluate\nfor other psychiatric illnesses things\nlike that okay so this like the you know\nyou're in rehab we'll talk more about\nwhat that is and then we get to the\nthird stage and this is what is what I\nthink is the most important is aftercare\nand in my opinion the biggest thing that\nseparates good rehabs from Bad rehabs\naside from people who are like you know\nopenly predatory or unethical is the\nAftercare plan so what I see in these\n70k luxury rehabs is that they do a very\nbad job or some of them do a bad job of\nAftercare and after care is like I don't\nwant to say this but it's easy to be\nsober when you're like in a residential\nfacility where you have no access to\nalcohol and drugs and people are helping\nyou detox and you're hanging out with\nother sober people all the time you\ndon't have your work stress you don't\nhave your school stressed you don't have\nyour family stressed you don't have your\nhome stress you're kind of in a\nstress-free kind of environment where\nyou can just focus on working on\nyourself\nthen what happens is you go back into\nyour old environment you go back into\nthe stress and then it becomes really\neasy to relapse\nso good programs will set up Aftercare\nand so what is like an Aftercare plan\nfrom the places that I work look like\nit's like okay we're gonna where are you\ngonna go where will you live are there\nany risk factors there do you have\nroommates who get like use every day\nright\nwhere are you going to get psychiatric\nhelp\nso they'll help you make appointments\nand they'll make it even like sort of\nmake appointments and if I'm calling\nfrom a rehab and I'm making an\nappointment I can usually get people in\nfaster so the key thing here is they'll\nlike set up appointments for you so that\ntwo weeks after discharge you're gonna\ngo see this psychiatrist and you're\ngonna go see this therapist and so they\nset it up for you so that you've got\nPsychiatry appointments you've got\ntherapy appointments are you going to do\nsome sort of peer support recovery right\nare you going to go to 12-step meetings\nare you going to do Refuge recovery\nwhich is kind of like a Buddhist\ninspired peer support program right so\nit's not about the higher power and and\nsort of like god-oriented stuff it's\nlike more about mindfulness and and like\ndiscovering whatever kind of spiritual\nstuff and things like that but they'll\nhelp you set all this stuff up in some\ncases the Aftercare will also involve\nthings like you know helping you find\nalternate housing\nwill help you do things like thinking\nabout you know work or professional\nthings\nincluding doing things like providing\nletters to your bosses that protect your\nprivacy but also like you know explain\nto your boss that hey this person may\nneed like a graduated return to work\nthings like that so for example when I'm\nat rehab like sometimes we'd get\nstudents so 21 year old and I'm going to\nwrite a letter to his Dean and I'm going\nto say hey the kid needs to like have a\nhalfway kid needs to take uh his his\ncourse load needs to be reduced by 50\nover the course of this next semester\nbecause he's got all this other crap to\ndo he's expected to do a b c and d right\nhe's gonna go see therapist he's gonna\ngo see psychiatrist and we sort of write\nthat in a way that is is privacy\nprotected but an official you know\nladder comes from a doctor saying hey\nlike you all need to cut this guy some\nslack he's trying to put his life\ntogether or she needs to try and put her\nlife together Aftercare can also involve\nstarting a lot of these conversations\naround relationships\nso like 30 percent of the patients at\nrehab that I work with is just a rough\nstatistic are going through a separation\nor divorce a third and so are we\npatching that up are we proceeding with\ndivorce like what's going on there\nbecause that's a bit major stressor so\nthe key thing about Aftercare is it's\nabout preemptively thinking about all\nthe stresses that you could have to go\nback into and your treatment team at\nrehab starting to work on that kind of\nstuff so we don't want to send like if\nyou're going through a divorce and we\ndischarge you after like giving you a\nmassage every day and going for a swim\non the beach for 30 days in a row and\nthen you're going back to your spouse\nwho you haven't talked with except for a\nlittle bit and you're like yeah I'm\nsober like it's all good I conquered my\naddiction your spouse is like awesome\nand if your therapist hasn't had like\nconversations with them whereas like we\nmeet with people like once a week we\nmeet with family members if they want to\nOnce once a week we're like hey what are\nthe problems that are going on like\nwhat's the stress in your marriage how\nis the alcohol affected both of y'all\nhow do you feel about that how do you\nfeel about that how does that make you\nfeel how does that make you feel I play\nreferee you know so like if things get\ntoo heated I'm gonna like calm things\ndown I'm gonna ask one person to step\nout of the room we're gonna work on it\nin the intervening week like we're gonna\ndo some solid family therapy individual\nwork we're gonna all do it together so\nthat when you leave here we recognize\nthat saving your marriage is an uphill\nbattle but we kind of know what we're\ndealing with instead of yeah it's 30\ndays I'm sober I feel really good I got\ndaily massages and it's all good okay\nafter care is crucial so now what I want\nto do is talk to you all a little bit\nabout what leads to success in subride\nso this perspective is\nkind of like my take on when people do a\ngood job at rehab what changes for them\nlike when someone comes in on day one\nand they leave on day 30 what's\ndifferent and it comes down to four\nthings the first thing is awareness of\ntriggers\nso substance use is highly environmental\nlike we kind of know this and so a key\nthing about staying sober is like\ncontrolling your exposure to triggers so\ntriggers can be everything from\nroommates who get high every day two x's\nwho use heroin and who will hit you up\nit can be even things like uh you know\nwork related stress or family related\nstress every time my parents ask me like\nyou know when am I going to move out of\nthe house when am I going to move out of\nthe house when am I going to move out of\nthe house every time my my wife or\nhusband nags me about a particular thing\nit makes me want to forget and use and\nlike it's really really stressful so you\nhave to know what are the things that\ntrigger your desire to use and Trigger\nCravings now we're not saying that you\nhave to avoid all of those things\nbecause some of that stuff may be\nnecessary but you have to have an\nawareness of your triggers and I know it\nsounds kind of simple but like a lot of\ntimes we don't think about that in\naddiction there are even studies that\nkind of show that sometimes if you ask\npeople okay why'd you relapse they'll\nsay I was doing fine I was doing fine I\ndon't know what happened I just slipped\nup and the more that I tunnel down into\nit it's like what do you mean you just\nslipped up like so walk me through the\nsequence of events you've been sober for\n12 weeks you were sober on Wednesday\nmorning and then you had a binge over\nthe weekend how was Thursday Thursday\nwas fine what about Friday well Friday\nat 6 p.m I got a text from my ex they're\nasking like hey you want to hang out and\nthen they sent me a provocative picture\nand I was like sure right and then we\nstarted texting back and forth I met up\nwith my ex on Saturday night and then I\nused for 24 hours okay well right so\nlike what are your triggers second thing\nthat happens this is what I call deep\nemotional work\nthis is what leads to success so if you\nlook at addictions the most common\nfeature of all addictions is that\nthey're coping mechanisms so if we look\nat a human being and they're psyche\nright so there's like if there's like\nreally toxic stuff down here\nthat I can't manage\nI'm gonna need to like add a substance\nto kind of quiet that out so we can\nthink about okay what are the triggers\nbut then what we also want to do is like\nempty out some of this stuff empty out\nsome of like the deep emotional work\nright so that this stuff kind of like\nleaks out the bottom and then where we\nstart to like feel better so this is\nwhere like if you look at like the a\nhistory of childhood abuse for example\ncorrelates with addiction and so like as\nyou start to feel really really ashamed\nof yourself right I'll give you all just\nlike an example of a thought that people\nwho struggle with addiction will have\nI'm a worthless piece of crap so why not\nuse it's not like I'm gonna accomplish\nanything anyway might as well get some\njoy out of life like I don't deserve to\nbe happy so why not just screw up like\nwhy not just screw up my life right it's\nnot like people give a [ __ ] about me\nthese are the kinds of thoughts that\nyou'll have I don't think that those\nthat's true I think people do care about\nyou and I think you do deserve to have a\ngood life but that involves that deep\nemotional work you can't massage your\nway to sobriety you gotta actually like\ndo that hard work ask those hard\nquestions what do you want to be in life\nlife what is this addiction done to you\nwhat's the harm you've caused do you\ndeserve to be happy in life who taught\nyou that you don't deserve to be happy\nin life these are like these deep\ncathartic conversations which sometimes\nyou'll see on on stream next thing that\nleads to sobriety is development of\ncoping skills\nokay so development of coping skills is\nremember that we've we're going to have\nto face some triggers we can't devoid\nall the triggers and we can do some of\nthis deep emotional work right we can\nempty this out a little bit but at some\npoint we're going to be in a situation\nwhere we feel emotionally bad or\nemotionally stressed and we've got to\nhave some kind of alternative as opposed\nto the substance that will help us\nemotionally cope now this is really\nimportant it's very hard to develop\ncoping skills when things are on fire so\nthe thing about developing coping skills\nis when you first start to use a coping\nskill let's say that y-axis is emotional\nrelief and x-axis is time okay if I\nstart meditating today what do you think\nthe emotional relief that I get from\nmeditation is so this is interesting\nwhen you're developing A coping skill\nthis is what the curve looks like\nbecause this first segment of time it's\nnot like you feel instant relief with\nmeditation right actually at the\nbeginning meditation is even more\nstressful because you're not even doing\nit right it doesn't help you at all so\nit's like you're paying a cost you're\nnot even getting a benefit then things\nstart to turn around and then after like\ntwo weeks of meditating you really start\nto get the hang of it and we know that\nclinically for example we see\nstatistically significant improvements\nin psychiatric diagnoses usually by like\nthe six to eight week Mark in terms of\nmindfulness interventions so it's like\nreally hard to like you can't develop an\nalternate coping skill while you're\ndetoxing right you gotta detox first be\nin a good place be stable it's kind of\nlike trying like so I see this a lot\nwhere like people will be actively using\nright they're like they're they're using\nand they need to learn how to meditate\nbecause that helps with addiction it's\nlike trying to learn how to swim in the\nmiddle of the Arctic Ocean you gotta\nlearn how to swim in Quiet Waters right\nlike learn how to swim in a kiddie pool\nlearn and then you can start to swim in\nlike like bigger bigger bigger waves so\na key part of that 30-day course is when\nI have a patient who comes in for 30\ndays of rehab I'm thinking to myself\nokay like what are the coping skills\nthat they're gonna need 30 days out and\nwe've got 30 days to teach them how to\nswim last thing is environmental\nplanning so we've kind of talked about\nthis a little bit already but this is\nwhere you know as a psychiatrist it's\nkind of like I'm responsible for this\nperson here right and this is one of the\nother reasons why I think a lot of\nrehabs are not affected because they're\nlike my job is to take care of you here\nit's not to find you a new roommate the\ngood rehabs will will help you go work\nthrough that kind of stuff but the key\nthing is that when we think about these\ntriggers and we think about coping\nskills and stuff like that the truth of\nthe matter is that a lot of substance\nuse is associated with life stressors so\nfor example in New York maybe 30 years\nago in order to get public or subsidized\nhousing government housing you had to be\nsober because they're like we don't want\naddicts using it like you got to get\nsober first and then we'll give you\nhousing for free this is what we need\nyou to do and then someone realized that\nit's really hard to get sober while\nyou're homeless so New York instituted\nthis awesome program called housing\nfirst we're like we don't care if you\nuse or not we're going to give you a\nroof over your head and lo and behold\nwhen people like aren't homeless it's\nactually easier to get sober as opposed\nto the other way around there has to be\nenvironmental planning involved so\nwhat's your work situation like what's\nyour family situation like what's your\nintimate relationship situation like\nwhat's your what what's your friend's\ncircle like what are your roommates like\nand thinking about all of these\nstressors and helping someone craft a\nplan okay so I'm gonna like avoid\ntalking to my mother-in-law\nfor one month after I leave because\nthat's just too much to handle I'm going\nto focus on getting back into work I'm\ngoing to focus on rebuilding my\nrelationship with my significant other\nand I'm gonna try to move out that's\nwhat I'm gonna and mother-in-law comes\nlater and I'm gonna go to meetings I'm\ngonna see a psychiatrist I'm going to\nsee a therapist you have to like plan\nthings out in a lot of environmental\nplanning and when people do these four\nthings they become aware of their\ntriggers they do the deep emotional work\nthey start developing to develop coping\nskills\nand they do some amount of environmental\nplanning this is when oh sorry this is\nwhen I tend to see success with with\nrehabs last thing that we're going to do\nis go through a couple of examples so\nhere's person one goes to the luxury\nrehab okay so what they usually do is\nthey do let's say like days one to five\nthey do detox at a hospital locked\ninpatient psychiatric unit so they detox\noff of alcohol they don't like it there\nthe food sucks they're crazy people\nthere then on day five they move to the\nluxury rehab I get a big screen TV I get\na private room I start taking walks on\nthe beach and then for the next kind of\nlike let's say 25 days they're doing\nsome work they go to a couple meetings\nmeetings are optional there's no\nrestriction on things like cell phones\nor devices or stuff like that so I can\nhang out in my room and like be on my\nphone if I feel like it I'm gonna have a\nprivate Chef I'm gonna do some yoga I'm\ngonna kind of detox I'm gonna talk some\nabout my feelings people well since I'm\npaying 70k I'm the boss so I'm paying 70\n000 to be here I don't what are they\ngonna do kick me out on week two if I\ndon't show up to some meeting so people\nshow up like as I start to slack off\npeople show up and they're like hey like\nyou should really come to this like we\nwant you to come this you're like yeah\nokay I'll come you come the next day day\nafter that you don't come you do the\nyoga you go for the beach you have some\nuh you know you have a lot of people\nkind of like that are very like ego\nsupportive so like they're very\ncompassionate and they're listening to\nyou you go and you vent about your\nproblems right you do a lot of venting\nand there's like staff that's very very\ncompassionate they're like oh it's so\nhard to be you bro it's so hard to you\nbe you girl oh like your husband is\nabusive like oh your wife is abusive\nthey're so neglectful like life is hard\nfor you you're such a beautiful person\nthey don't challenge you they don't be\nlike hey like it takes two to ruin a\nmarriage and it's kind of great and then\nyou leave with a tan you leave feeling\ngood like you're gonna take over the\nworld\nyou've kicked the addiction you've\nconquered it they don't tell you hey\nthis is a lifelong journey and you're\ngoing to continue to struggle and like\nlet's set up a psychiatrist or therapist\nyeah you don't need that kind of stuff\nyou're fixed option number two okay so\nyou do detox let's say at an inpatient\nlocked facility at day five you move\nover and then people start to ask you\nquestions so like people are are\ncompassionate but they're also\nchallenging they're a little bit more\nstrict in terms of attendance like\nthey're kind of like hey you're here to\nget sober you're not here to be this\nisn't a vacation they're going to\nemphasize skills building you start\ndoing deep emotional work you really\nconnect with a therapist you really like\nthem a lot you see a doctor a couple\ntimes a week you know so multiple\nPsychiatry appointments\nmeds change if they need to they're\nwilling to offer opioid assisted therapy\nif you need it and then you know at week\ntwo you're also doing things like doing\nfamily therapy you're also doing things\nlike figuring out work related stuff\nyou're having tense conversations with\nyour partner about the state of your\nmarriage and divorce they're not\npleasant they're not fun but you're\nstarting to do the work here you're\ndoing a lot of challenging work with a\nlot of support then people on week two\nstart to develop Aftercare plan you've\nonly been here for two weeks since the\nhalfway point and we're going to start\nplanning for you to leave it's kind of\nweird right because that's what it takes\nto set up good Aftercare and while we're\nsetting up Aftercare I want you to go to\na 12-step meeting I want you to go to an\nAAA meeting I want you to go to a refuge\nrecovery meeting I want you to go to\nsmart meeting so on Tuesday Wednesday\nThursday this week and Tuesday Wednesday\nThursday next week you're going to go to\nboth all three of those meetings so one\nmeeting a day and you're gonna tell me\nwhich one you like as opposed to these\nguys who are like oh by the way like you\ncan go to a if you want to and then you\ngo to a and you're like yeah that's not\nreally for me but then what you go two\nweeks after discharge you go to your\nfirst a meeting you decide it's not for\nyou and then you're like I don't need it\nI'm sober whereas here people are like\ntrying things this is what a good\nsuccessful rehab experience looks like\nand then hopefully you've set up good\nAftercare and when you leave like you're\nnot it's not a vacation it's that you've\nbeen fighting a war and losing all this\ntime\nbut now finally like you you have a plan\nof attack you recognize who the enemy is\nyou recognize what your vulnerabilities\nare you recognize that you have some\ndeep emotional work that you started on\nbut that you have a long way to go\nyou've developed some coping skills to\nreplace substances the challenge is that\nwhen it comes to rehabs they're not\nincentivized to do all this stuff in the\nworst cases people are actually\nincentivized to set you up to fail but\nlove them I don't think that's the\nmajority but I I wish I could really say\nthat with 100 confidence and and there's\nalso a lot of other reasons why a lot of\nrehabs are not effective and that's\nbecause people show up with the best of\nintentions right I've been sober for 20\nyears it worked for me it's worked for\nhundreds of people but it also hasn't\nworked for hundreds of people but this\nit's my way or the highway it's like\nthis is the way to sobriety and if you\nguys have done like work with sobriety\nyou all will meet these people whether\nthey're like super hardcore right\nincredibly rigid and so the problem is\neven if you go to one of those rehabs\nlike those people will say like hey if\nyou show up here and you do the work\nhalf of the people wash out and they say\nit like it's a point of Pride it's the\npeople who are serious enough who will\nbe sober and so either you make the cut\nor you don't make the cut and I don't\nthink that that's like effectively the\nbest way to to help people with sobriety\nit works for some people temperamentally\nand so the big challenge with rehab is\nthat we have a lot of people who are\ndesperate and the stakes are high and it\nis an intensive expensive treatment and\nthe more that we sort of combine those\nwhen you've got a resource intensive\nthing in a group of desperate people\nthat's when you get mortgages that's\nwhen you have people taking out loans\nthat's when you have people selling cars\nthat's when you have people who are like\ntrying to like borrow money from all\ntheir friends and family to fund fifty\nthousand dollars for 30 days of\nresidential treatment that may not even\nbe scientifically valid and when you\nhave a system like this that doesn't\nmeasure outcomes that doesn't hold\nrehabs accountable you end up with what\nyou have in New Jersey which is a\nsituation where you've got a bunch of\nrehabs that are at the worst predatory\nand unfortunately a lot of them are\nprobably just religion half of whom\ndon't actually use the standard of care\nthe best evidence-based treatment for\nthings like opioid Addiction in a\ncountry where we have an opioid crisis\nNational Health Emergency and half of\nour residential treatment centers are\nnot even using the best tool that we\nhave the truth of the matter is that\nresidential treatment is like Rife with\nall kinds of problems there aren't\nreally good checks and balances a lot of\npeople in my opinion don't really know\nwhat they're doing you can maybe argue\nthat it's ignorant for me to make that\ncriticism because I've only you know I\nonly worked at two rehabs I worked there\nfor like two to three years it's not\nlike I have 30 years of experience under\nmy belt so fair enough if you want to\nsay my perspective isn't as valid as\nthose other people's but there's a lot\nof data to support this and so if you're\ninterested in rehab what I'd strongly\nrecommend is if you call a place you ask\nquestions like this ask them what's your\ntreatment philosophy do you see\nPsychiatry like do you all have mental\nhealth clinicians there what kind of\nclinicians do you all use an nurse\npractitioner or do you have a medical\ndoctor or is it a team of both do you\nall have therapists how often will I see\na medical doctor how often will I see a\nnurse practitioner how often will I see\nmy therapist what kind of things do\ntherapists work on what kind of therapy\ndo you use do you all what do you\nemphasize in your program how much of it\nis 12-step how much of it is coping\nskills and this is really really\ncrucially important what does Aftercare\nplanning look like at your facility\nhopefully if you ask these questions\nyou'll be able to tell because all of\nthem will have the same price tag 50k\n60k 70k sometimes or although it can be\na lot cheaper in Insurance based but\neven if you're talking about\ninsurance-based ones like you can ask\nthem these kinds of questions because\nwhat we also learned from the the New\nJersey commission is that a lot of these\nplaces that are Insurance based they'll\njust keep you there including up to and\nincluding falsifying drug tests so\nyou're not allowed to be discharged and\nwhen people are falsifying drug tests to\nkeep you there do you think they're\nactually trying to help you of course\nnot you're a prisoner and every day\nyou're at the prison the facility is\nbeing paid eight hundred thousand twelve\nhundred dollars so ask these kinds of\nquestions before you go and hopefully\nyou know places that can give you good\nanswers or places that I would trust a\nlittle bit more so that's kind of my\ntake on rehabs it's a it's a place\nthat's Rife with bad information\num because a lot of this stuff isn't\npublished it's hard to research a lot of\nthese places are for-profit so they\ndon't really publish their outcomes\nthey're not really vetted by Third\nparties there's no peer-reviewed\nresearch Publications and things like\nthat\nso you got to be careful which is\nunfortunate because the the stakes are\nhigh when it comes to addiction"
