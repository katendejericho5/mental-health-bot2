    "transcript": "so for example let's say I get dressed\nup and I go to a party and I'm wearing a\nfancy dress and nine people walk up to\nme and say Dr K that's a beautiful dress\nyou look great in it you're really\nrocking the dress bro and then one\nperson walks up to me is like you look\nabsolutely ridiculous what on Earth are\nyou doing wearing a dress it looks\nterrible you all need to hear this ADHD\nears use strong negative emotions to\nmotivate ourselves so I was reading this\nbook your brain's not broken by Tamara\nRosier and explains the most effed up\noh whoops\nabout how adhders motivate themselves\nusing intense mode emotions since we\ncan't motivate like neurotypicals as you\nknow we are motivated by interest rather\nthan importance and consequences so how\ndo we get the day-to-day stuff done in\norder to function here we go anxiety we\nrely on anxiety to tell us what needs to\nbe done did I lock my car what happened\nif I accidentally unlocked it my stuff\nwould get stolen I can't buy a new one\nlock car lock car lock car it is like we\ninject strong emotions like fight or\nflight into ourselves but the thing is\nthey can linger after oh wait I just\nlocked my the car right yeah oh I'm\nworried oh gosh and that's mentally\ntaxing anger getting mad in order to\nfuel ourselves to do the task the book\ngives an example of this guy whose\nmother was angered by his behavior and\nwhen no one else else was around to yell\nat me I learned to yell at myself as you\ncan imagine this is not healthy and it\nleads to exhaustion and crankiness shame\nand self-loathing an intense feeling of\nflawed of unworthy of love to start I\nimagine how disappointed my supervisor\nwould be if I don't finish on time she\nwill then she will realize she shouldn't\nhave given me the job in the first place\nI have to get this right or I'll screw\nup my kids for the rest of their life so\nwe are rehearsing different ways we are\ndamaged and competent and stupid there's\nmore like more in the book but these are\nreally the top three that I found crazy\nwe use anxiety anger and shame to fuel\nthe motivation deficit and neurotypicals\nhave naturally and it can come at a cost\nso I really like this post for a lot of\nreasons and there are some things that I\nwould sort of disagree with the first\nthing that I really like is that it\nshows how having ADHD and negative\nemotions can synergize in some ways what\nI dislike about it is that I think it\nonce again\noversimplifies into attributing all of\nthese things to ADHD so this isn't just\ntrue of people with ADHD this is true of\neveryone where if we kind of think about\nit why do human beings have negative\nemotions right let's just start there\nlet's start by recognizing that anxiety\nshame and anger are not exclusive to\npeople with ADHD these are conserved\nacross the entire human race and why is\nthat it's because they are very very\nuseful emotions so in today's society we\ntend to think about negative emotions\nthis is negative right it's like I want\nto feel a lot of excitement I want to\nfeel a lot of Joy I want to feel a lot\nof curiosity but I don't want anxiety I\ndon't want anger I don't want shame\nthose are bad emotions and those are to\nbe avoided but let's remember that if\nthey didn't do something for us we\nwouldn't have evolved them and it turns\nout that the negative emotions are\nactually very very powerful motivators\nin fact they're stronger motivators than\npositive emotions so let's just\nunderstand that for a sec the first\nthing to get is that our brain is more\nsensitive to negative things than\npositive things this is a bias that's\nbaked in so for example let's say I get\ndressed up and I go to a party and I'm\nwearing a fancy dress and nine people\nwalk up to me and say Dr K that's a\nbeautiful dress you look great in it\nyou're really rocking the dress bro and\nthen one person walks up to mean it's\nlike you look absolutely ridiculous what\non Earth are you doing wearing a dress\nit looks terrible hey Chad subscribing\nto our YouTube channel allows us to help\nmore people with their mental health\nthanks to your support so far we've\nalready reached thousands of people from\nacross the globe so help us out and hit\nsubscribe wait they have to hit\nsubscribe and click a bell now now in my\nmind I've got nine compliments and one\nperson has criticized which one do I\nfocus on I tend to focus on the\ncriticism right so I've also seen this\nin in especially kids that are South\nAsian or East Asian where their parents\nwill focus on like it doesn't matter\nlike how much I get right all that\nmatters is what I didn't get right or\nthat someone else does a better job than\nI do it's like you got 92 on on the test\nbut our neighbor across the street their\nkid got a 98. why can't you get a 98 why\ndo you have to get a 92 and so even like\nculturally or can will be conditioned to\nfocus on the negative right we'll see\nthat a lot and so if you kind of think\nabout this where does this come from I\nsort of use food poisoning as a good\nexample so if we weren't biased towards\nthe negative like let's say that like I\ngot food poisoning from eating something\nright if I got food poisoning 40 of the\ntime but it was fine sixty percent of\nthe time I would be in a lot of trouble\nif I kept eating it because even though\ntechnically sixty percent of the time\nI'm fine that's more than half on\naverage it's a good idea for me to eat\nbut the consequences of making that\nnegative mistake are so high that even\nif you really think about it if you go\nto your favorite restaurant you get food\npoison once it's actually like hard to\ngo back there right and so we tend to\nsee is that the brain is biased towards\nthe negative that we weigh the negative\nmore powerfully than the positive and so\nwhat this results in is some of us who\nstruggle with motivation have one really\npowerful tool to motivate ourselves and\nthat's negative emotion and this isn't\njust kids with ADHD so you'll see this\nfor example in medical students where\nsome Med students or most Med students\nare high on neuroticism so this is one\nof the five Factor personality\ndimensions and neuroticism is the\ntendency to worry and so people may\nthink like why on Earth would a tendency\nto worry be a good thing like why would\nwe even have people who have a tendency\nto worry well it turns out that if\nyou're worried about failing a test\nyou're going to study harder and that\nfear of failing can make you actually\nwork harder and actually outperform\npeople who are kind of chill so on the\none hand we have the paranoid medical\nstudent who's a or paranoid pre-med who\nwants to go to medical school and on the\nflip side we have our classic Stoner\npersonality plus or minus marijuana\nwhatever we've got someone who's like eh\neverything will be okay right we're not\neven saying that it's marijuana related\nwe've just got people who are like that\nbad that personality and they're like\nI'm just chilling like live for today\ndon't worry about tomorrow everything\nworks itself out and the pre-med is the\none who gets an a the person who's\npretty chill will get like a B plus B\nminus right because on Friday night one\nof them's out having a good time the\nother one's actually at the library\nstudy so we tend to see is that actually\nnegative motivators uh what I call the\ndirty motivators so I kind of think of\nthem kind of like nuclear power or like\nthey harness a bunch of energy but\nthey're radio active and if you're not\ncareful they'll damage your life right\nyou can succeed but you won't be happy\nor content in doing so I see that a lot\nalso in like the fields of like finance\nand stuff like that where you'll see a\nlot of imposter syndrome so people who\nuse dirty motivators will be will\nexperience a lot of imposter syndrome as\nwell so I'll give you a like let's just\ntake a quick look at this so if you use\nshame or self-loathing oh my God like\nI'm gonna do so bad at this let me try\nmy best even though I'm Unworthy of it\nand then you end up feeling damaged and\ncompetent or stupid but you do well\nenough in school right because you're\nbeating yourself up all the time then\nyou'll actually succeed and you go to\nmedical school and then it when someone\nhas used shame and self-loathing to\nmotivate themselves and they get into\nmedical school or they wind up in\nresidency at Harvard what do they end up\nfeeling like they end up feeling like an\nimposter an imposter is someone who has\nshame and self-loathing on the inside\nbut performs well on the outside and\nwe're seeing a growing level of imposter\nsyndrome across society as a whole and I\nthink part of the reason for that is\nbecause we're using shame and\nself-loathing as motivator now out of\nthese three specific things I think the\nanxiety one is the best that's ADHD\nspecific so the anxiety one really\nillustrates how we can use anxiety as an\nantidote to forgetfulness so in the\nbrain of someone who's got ADHD they're\nhighly distractible they also tend to be\nforgetful but really if you look at it\nit's not that they have memory problems\nit's that they have attentional problems\nso when I I forgot where my keys are\nit's not that I knew where my keys are\nand then my I had a memory problem what\nactually happens is I'm not paying\nattention when I put them down so it's\nthis is this is important to understand\nbut it's not the recall that is impaired\nwith people with ADHD it's the insertion\nof the information it's the like you\nknow it we don't write it to the hard\ndrive well enough like that's where the\nreal problem is it's inattention not a\nlack of not really a memory problem but\nwe can still see how anxiety can be an\nantidote to that so when I'm anxious\nif I've trained my brain to be paranoid\nthen I won't forget because I'm always\nworrying about it because what can\nprotect me against forgetting if I'm\nalways worried about it and even if it's\nokay I've trained myself to always worry\nbecause I can't trust my memory so I'm\nalways worrying always wearing always\nworrying and this is what you see in\npeople with ADHD is that they develop\nadaptive mechanisms which are harmful to\nthem over the long term so this is why\nfor example ADHD people with ADHD have a\nvery high risk of depression children\nwith ADHD have a very high risk of\ndepression developing major depressive\ndisorder later in life so these kids\ngrow up and they struggle in school they\nforget all the time things like that\nthey develop some self-esteem issues so\nthat too I think this isn't directly a\nconsequence of ADHD this is usually what\nhappens when you have a kid with ADHD is\nthey look around at other kids and they\nrealize I'm just as smart as these other\nkids are they're told by their teachers\nthey're told by parents you're so smart\nyou have so much potential so they I\nknow I've got the IQ but then I can't\nperform in school so I can't get an A\nbecause I get distracted I can't pay\nattention it's a really classic case\nthat I kind of think of which is that\nteacher asks the kid are you paying\nattention answer the question and the\nkid wasn't paying attention they look\naround they see a problem on the board\nthey look around everyone's looking at\nthem okay we're in math class there's a\nproblem on the board I see that these\nother three problems have answers this\none doesn't have an answer let me answer\nthat question okay this is the answer\nand they say it the teacher kind of\nlooks at them with skepticism writes the\nanswer on the board and moves on this\ninattention makes it very difficult to\nfunction in school everyone recognizes\nyour potential but you don't live up to\nit and then everyone says oh you should\njust try harder doesn't apply himself\ndoesn't apply herself doesn't live up to\nher full potential and so then what\nhappens is you start to feel broken if\nyou have ADHD because you recognize that\nI'm just as smart as these kids when I\npay attention I'm able to learn just as\nfast as they do but I'm not able to pay\nattention and no one recognizes that my\nproblem is a lack of attention it's it's\nlike exactly what happens imagine a\nchild who goes to school is super smart\nbut needs glasses and can't read because\nthey don't have glasses how would that\nchild feel about themselves if no one\nrecognized that oh the problems of the\nkid needs glasses the child would\nstumble adapt do all kinds of stuff to\njust be average they exert so much\neffort to just perform at an average\nlevel and they end up feeling terrible\nabout themselves because what they see\nis I'm trying hard I try hard every\nsingle day I'm trying so so hard and if\nthe best I can do is average how screwed\nup must I be because everyone says I\ncould do great but I can't do great and\nI'm trying so hard so they develop\nself-living now is this a direct\nconsequence of ADHD D I don't think so I\nthink this is the consequence of\nuntreated undiagnosed and untreated ADHD\nand growing up in that situation so this\nis important to understand that you've\ngot to differentiate those out a little\nbit and the reason that's important is\nbecause once you treat the ADHD some of\nthis may go away but this won't a\nstimulant medication isn't going to fix\nthis this needs independent treatment\nright in Psychotherapy or something like\nthat now anger is a really interesting\nexample because we do know for example\nthat emotional dysregulation is common\nin people with ADHD people with ADHD can\nsometimes have low frustration tolerance\nthey can kind of perseverate and if they\nget Disturbed they can respond with\nanger there's some evidence that given\nthe same stimuli people with ADHD will\nfeel more anger but that once again I\nthink you've got to be kind of careful\nbecause I don't know that that's\nnecessarily an Adaptive mechanism like\nthe other two I think sometimes people\nwith ADHD just experience more anger and\nfrustration and have difficulty with\nfrustration tolerance that has something\nto do with probably the way that their\nfrontal lobes strong struggle to inhibit\nthe negative emotional circuitry in the\nbrain so for a neurotypical person if I\nexperience some amount of anger there's\nanother part of my brain that's like\ntelling me okay calm down take a deep\nbreath let's not lose control and that's\nthe part of the brain that really\ndoesn't function very well in people\nwith ADHD or some people with ADHD now\nwhat all human beings will tend to do in\nthat situation is like if I'm going to\nbe angry anyway let's make the most of\nit so people with ADHD will develop some\nadaptive strategies but I think anger is\na little bit different just to kind of\nsummarize I think it's really\nunfortunate but oftentimes people with\nADHD will experience high levels of\nnegative emotion in the case of anxiety\nsometimes that's almost an Adaptive\nmechanism to make up for being forgetful\ndistractible or not paying attention to\nthings other examples of the negative\nemotions they experience aren't\nnecessarily adaptations per se but are\nconsequences of frequently growing up\nwithout a diagnosis or treatment of ADHD\nand the important thing there is that if\nwe say that self-loathing is a part of\nthe Ada HD then treating the ADHD should\nfix the self-loathing but in my\nexperience as a clinician it doesn't\nwork like that that you can treat the\nADHD but you need to deal with the\nself-esteem and self-loathing\nindependently the last emotion is anger\nwhich in my experience a lot of times\npeople just get dysregulated very easily\nI don't know that it's necessarily\nadaptive maybe a portion of that is\nadaptive but understand that part of\nADHD is to be unable to regulate your\nemotions and then as most people with\nADH do they'll adapt to those\ncircumstances as best they can maybe use\nthat anger to manage social situations\nmaybe use that anger to even beat\nthemselves up a little bit and then what\nwe do know is that people tend to\ninternalize the dialogue that is used\nwith them that has nothing to do with\nADHD that's just how we all work so you\ncan take a kid in an abusive situation\nwhere they have ADHD or don't have ADHD\nif they're given abusive language they\nwill internalize those thoughts and have\nself-esteem problems later at the end of\nthe day I do think it's really really\nimportant to understand the connection\nbetween ADHD and emotions and hopefully\nwe've sort of Illustrated that a little\nbit today if you found this
