    "transcript": "patient we may know more than the\npatient about diagnoses but it's still\nreally really important because as a\ndoctor what's your best source of\ninformation your best source of\ninformation is actually the patient\nchange my view self-diagnosing a mental\nillness is not valid\nI'm in high school and I see people do\nthis all the time they say they have\nADHD and I ask and ask why I can't focus\npeople say they're depressed how do you\nknow I'm sad today\nit's honestly just a cycle of people\nself-diagnosing themselves without\nproper research medical diagnosis I\nunderstand sometimes we know ourselves\nthe best but whenever it comes to\nsomething serious that you need an\nactual therapist specialist\nself-diagnosing can be so harmful\nself dying can be so so harmful for\nexample there's a girl in my class and\nshe told me she has autism and ADHD then\nshe told me she hasn't actually gotten\nchecked but she still knows afterwards\nas I spent more time with her she\nstarted diagnosing me with autism as\nwell also\nshe told me I had the symptoms and I\nasked her how she knows and she told me\nshe looked online and I follow exactly\nwhat it says and that she has it too I'm\nnot mad at her but I do think it is\nignorant self-diagnosing cannot only be\nharmful to yourself because you might be\nwrong but harmful to others because you\nmight spread wrong information I\nunderstand U.S health care sucks and\ngetting therapy and everything is so\nexpensive but that doesn't mean people\nshould be telling others what what they\nthink they have\nedit when I say valid I mean end result\npeople shouldn't be saying they have\nthis and that and then call it a day\nself-diagnosis should only be a basis in\norder to sing if you need specialist\nhelp or not many people I know\nself-diagnose and don't seek further\nhelp and then they end it on the\nself-diagnosis therefore it's not a\nvalid conclusion\nokay\nso this is something that I'm seeing a\nton of\nnowadays by the way\nso we're seeing a ton\nof self-diagnosis on the internet\nright where people will like say oh yeah\nI have autism I have adhdi of this I\nhave multiple personality disorder\nthings like that like people will\ndiagnose themselves with all sorts of\nthings\nand is that kind of valid\nwell I know this is going to sound kind\nof weird my short answer is no it's not\nbut there's a pretty big butt in there\nas well\nso what I'd love to do is share with\ny'all why I think first of all it's so\neasy to diagnose yourself on the\ninternet\nsecondly why people diagnose themselves\nfrom like research on the internet third\nwhat's actually wrong about it right\nbecause there there was we'll see\nthey're actually quite logical in the\nway that they approach it but really\nwhat the shortcoming to self-diagnosis\nis and actually what's hard the hard\npart of being a physician which we'll\nget to is not in diagnosing someone\ndiagnosing someone is actually not the\nhard part it's very easy to come up with\na diagnosis we'll actually share with\nyou all why I think what's the main\nthing that's missing with self-diagnosis\non the internet which happens to\nactually be in my opinion kind of the\nbiggest value ad that doctors bring to\nthe table\nand then we'll talk a little bit about\nwhat's the big caveat right so and how\nto approach this if you're someone who\nhas diagnosed something on the Internet\nor if you think you have something how\nto approach that so let's do each of\nthose kind of in order\nso the first is that\nthis generation is the best generation\nin terms of like the digital generation\nis the best in terms of being able to\nfind answers for themselves\nso we're like more effective at it than\nany generation prior to us\num there's also more high quality\ninformation so for example if you look\nat Wikipedia Wikipedia is more factually\ncorrect than encyclopedias which is what\nI grew up with when I was like a 10 year\nold kid we used to have like you know a\npile of encyclopedias and if I needed to\nknow something I would go like look it\nup in the encyclopedia\nso we're like actually really good at\nfinding information there's actually a\nreally a lot of high quality information\nout there and even if you look at some\nof these things like you know people\nwill look at Mayo Clinic or Cleveland\nClinic or whatever for like information\non ADHD or Autism and and they'll sort\nof find that okay like oh this this\nreally does sound like it fits me so it\nsort of makes sense because there's\nactually good quality information out\nthere the last thing is that you tend to\nknow yourself in a way the best right so\nyou know what you experience you\nunderstand subjectively what it's like\nand so if you kind of know what your\nday-to-day is like and you read\nsomething from the Cleveland Clinic like\nthat's sort of that's a high quality\nSource right and you can kind of end up\nmaking a diagnosis because at the end of\nthe day the list of diagnosis diagnostic\ncriteria is boxes and you check a lot of\nthose boxes so it sort of makes sense\nthat here's a reputable source that\ngives me a set of check boxes I check a\nlot of those boxes this is my experience\nso this is what the diagnosis is kind of\nmakes sense\nanother big driver for this is that a\nlot of people are looking for insight\ninto their lives so one of the most\namazing things about receiving a\npsychiatric diagnosis for some people by\nthe way for some people it's\nstigmatizing but for some people it's\nliberating\nbecause for some people I've struggled\nmy whole life and I haven't understood\nwhy\nam I cursed is this just like am I\nbroken am I messed up in some way and\nfor some people getting a diagnosis is\nliberating because it offers an\nexplanation\nnow I understand why my life has been\nthis way now I understand why I behave\nthis way now I understand why my mind\nbehaves this way and that understanding\nthat you're not fundamentally broken but\nrather that you have a particular\ndiagnosis which is more responsible for\nyour situation can be incredibly\nliberating\nin some cases\nit can be so liberating that it leads to\na lack of responsibility on the\npatient's part right so this is\nsomething that we also see is that when\npeople get diagnosed with mental illness\nespecially a psychiatric diagnosis\nthat being sick\nentitles you to particular benefits now\nI know this may sound a little bit weird\nespecially if you're suffering from\nmental illness you're like there's no\nway that this is like worth it it\ndoesn't entitle me to anything it just\nmakes my life objectively worse we're\nnot disputing that it is in that loss or\nnet negative but what we do know on\nresearch on people who get diagnosed\nwith things is it's not just mental\nillness that once you get some kind of\ndiagnosis people essentially cut you\nsome slack hopefully right so we know\nthat for example if you get diagnosed\nwith cancer\nbosses tend to be kinder to you things\nlike that mental health is a tricky\nsituation because a lot of times when\nyou get a diagnosis people actually\ndiscriminate against you\nbut sometimes people with mental\ndiagnoses especially\nlike ADHD\num they feel like they have a good\nreason for their lack of performance and\nsometimes people will even like cut them\nsome slack right oh I'm sorry I'm late\ntoday I've got ADHD and it's really hard\nfor me to get organized and out the door\nand as people are becoming more and more\ncompassionate as we're actually\ndestigmatizing mental illness what we\nactually discover is that there's more\nlatitude given to people who have\ndiagnoses I'm not saying that that's\nright wrong or indifferent I'm not\npassing a moral judgment on that I'm\njust making an observation about what I\nsee\nso as we can see that there are good\nreasons and good sources to make\ndiagnosis now what we're going to get to\nis I think the core reason why it's\ngenerally speaking not a good idea to\nmake a final diagnosis about yourself\nand the main reason for this actually\nhas to do with what doctors do\nso the hard part about being a doctor\nis not making a diagnosis\nso if we think about what is a diagnosis\nlet's say there's five features\nand if you check three out of five boxes\nyou have the diagnosis and so if you go\nto like Cleveland Clinic and you look at\ntheir website on let's say bipolar\ndisorder they're going to be nine\ndiagnostic criteria and you need more\nthan three but let's just assume three\nout of five\nso people will do is they'll see like oh\nI checked these\nthree boxes so I must have this thing\nright so like I checked the boxes so it\nsort of makes sense there's a reputable\nsource that says that if you check a b\nand c\nyou have the diagnosis\nnow the challenge is that this is\nactually not what makes being a doctor\nhard because\nlet's say that I have a diagnosis like\nhypothyroidism\nokay\nand hypothyroidism has features like\nhypersomnia sleeping too much\nlow energy\nuh sometimes it can have cognitive\nchanges\nit can also have\nincreased\nweight so we'll see weight gain\nso these are all features of\nhypothyroidism\nand\nwhat I could do if I'm a doctor is is I\ncould get people who have let's say\nmajor depressive disorder\nfor whom diagnostic features include\nhypersomnia\nweight gain\noh by the way decreased mood is also\nover here so low mood\ncognitive impairment\num\nlow energy\nand low mood\nright\nso these are both features of all this\nall this stuff so what what could happen\nif you were a bad doctor\nis that if you are an endocrinologist\nand a hundred patients with MDD come\ninto your office what you would do is\ndiagnose all of them with hypothyroidism\nif you're a psychiatrist and 100\npatients come in with hypothyroidism you\ncould diagnose them with MDD\nso the hard part about being a doctor is\nnot making a diagnosis\nthe hard part what we really study for\nand work towards the reason that we\norder tests is not to make a diagnosis\nthe reason that we order tests is to\nrule out diagnoses and the hard part of\nbeing a doctor is the differential\ndiagnosis\nand this is the the big problem that I\nsee with self-diagnosis is that people\ndon't construct differentials\nyou may check three out of these five\nboxes but like you can check literally\nall five of these boxes\nin both of these situations\nand depending on what pops up on your\nGoogle search you'll diagnose yourself\nwith MDD or hypothyroidism\ndoes that make sense\nso like I'll give you all just an\nexample of how complex differential\ndiagnosis is and this is why we do\ndiagnostic interviews and diagnostic\ntests and diagnostic exams and physical\nexams\nbecause we'll ask a thousand questions\nthat the person themselves won't ask\nthemselves because they don't know to\nask him\nso let's say that I have difficulty with\nFocus\nand I'm on the internet\nand then I conclude\nI can't study I'm having trouble with\nstudying I conclude I have ADHD\neasy right because I have difficulty\nfocusing I can't study my mind wanders\nbut if we really look at the\ndifferential for difficulty with Focus\nthere's all kinds of other things like\nyou may have a vitamin deficiency\nright so like for example B12 deficiency\niron deficiency\nwhat else vitamin D deficiency\nthese could all lead to problems with\nFocus\num\nother examples are like there are other\npsychiatric illnesses which can lead to\na lack of focus so like for example\nmajor depressive disorder so you could\nbe depressed people have difficulty\nstudying when they're depressed you\ncould even be hypomanic right\nusually those people study better but\nnot always\nthere are also other things like maybe\nyou have an anxiety disorder\nso like when you're anxious you're going\nto have difficulty focusing because your\nmind is racing a thousand miles a minute\nand you're thinking about all kinds of\nthings you can't focus on your school\nbecause oh my God what's going to happen\nif I miss my package\nI won't have my package I'm gonna go\nhome I won't have the gift for Christmas\nif I don't have the gift for Christmas\npeople are gonna get pissed at me it's\ngoing to create such so much drama\nI can't miss the package I can't miss\nthe package how are you supposed to\nstudy for your final exams when you're\nparanoid about what's going to happen at\nChristmas\nother examples include things like PTSD\noh yeah like I can't focus on school\nbecause I'm having nightmares and\nflashbacks\nand that goes to like other stuff as\nwell like what about Sleep disorders\nmaybe the reason that I can't focus is\nbecause I have sleep apnea\nI'm literally having 60 apnic episodes\nwhich creates a stress response similar\nto Drowning that's what my body thinks\nis going on so I drown for 90 seconds 60\ntimes a night\nand then my sleep is all messed up maybe\nthat's why I can't focus or we have\nsomething like a circadian rhythm\ndisorder\nand what does that mean well that means\nthat when I try to study when I go to\nclass at 10 am\nmy biological clock is messed up and my\nbody thinks it's three in the morning\nso it's like half asleep like can you\nimagine for the average person going to\nclass like chemistry class at three in\nthe morning when you're dead tired and\nyour body's telling you to go to sleep\nand you're struggling not to pass out\nvery hard\nand then what happens is maybe you pound\nthe caffeine\nbut like your body still thinks it's the\nmiddle middle of the night and you have\na circadian rhythm and it's all out of\nwhack so you have difficulty focusing\nother things that we don't even really\nthink about substance use\nthis is huge for lack of focus\nbecause if you're drinking or using pot\non a regular basis like that's going to\nimpair your focus that's what it does\neven things like caffeine dependence\ncan alter your focus oh yeah you don't\nhave ADHD at 5 PM you're crashing\nfrom a combination of a circadian rhythm\ndisorder with pounding too much caffeine\nin order to stay awake\nright and then we'll even have things\nlike narcolepsy which people don't yeah\nusually people know when they're\nnarcoleptic\nand then there are other things as well\nlike what are other factors that are\neven non-diagnostic or not even\nillnesses that you can diagnose that may\nimpact your focus so things like\ntechnology usage\nso we know that for example short form\nconsuming large amounts of short form\ncontent and highly dopaminergic content\nnegatively impairs your attention span\nso like as you watch more and more clips\nof stuff your brain gets used to\npay holding its attention on one thing\nfor 30 to 90 seconds\nand so then what's happening is like\npeople are learning okay so like since\nthe attention span is shortening\nwhat we're going to have to do is make\nthings more dopaminergic we're gonna\nhave to make a more clickbaity\nand so the more dopaminergic we keep it\nlike if something's super intense\nhappens at the 60 second Mark of a video\nthen someone will stay\nbut if we bore them a little bit they're\ngoing to click on something else\nand so these kinds of things could be\nshaping our Focus as well\nso now this is something that when I see\nmost people diagnosing themselves on the\ninternet\nthey don't go through this process\nof differential diagnosis\nand this is where I think most people\nmake their mistakes and this is what\ndoctors are trained to do so when\nsomeone comes in like the whole point of\nbeing a psychiatrist is when someone\ncomes in\nand they say hey I think I may have ADHD\nI'm having difficulty focusing\nI'm not going to jump straight to this\nthe whole point of my training is that\nI've been trained as a medical doctor so\nI'm going to think about Sleep Disorders\nI'm going to think about substance use\nI'm going to think about other\npsychiatric diagnoses I'm going to think\nabout vitamin deficiencies and then I'm\nalso going to think about\nother stuff like autoimmune disorders\nlike hypothyroidism\nlike lupus\nright so when someone comes in with ADHD\nI'll ask them hey you have any rashes\nthey're like what\nno I'm like okay cool\nprobably not lupus\nand so this is really what what you know\nbeing a good clinician is about it's\nabout doing a good differential\ndiagnosis because as we Illustrated here\nyou can check the boxes very easily this\nis what I think is the major shortcoming\nof self-diagnosis on the Internet is\nthat you're not accounting for all the\nother stuff that it could be\nnow why why is it why do we see so much\nself-diagnosis and his self-diagnosis\nnecessarily bad now this is where it's\ngoing to sound kind of weird right\nbecause I just spent so much time\ntelling y'all oh like this is why you\ncan't diagnose yourself on the internet\nso why does this happen so much I think\nthat this is where I'm talking about the\nvalue that doctors bring to the table\nbut I think I it's also fair to talk\nabout our shortcomings as doctors\nso one of the biggest mistakes that we\nmake as doctors is that we're arrogant\nright because we do know all that kind\nof stuff\nso what happens is sometimes a lot of\npatients who come in and they'll say hey\nI think I have cancer\nI the doctor will ask them a hands a\nhandful of questions and I'll I'll\ndetermine sometimes what will happen is\nI'll go through a process called\npremature closure where instead of\nconsidering a good differential I'll\njump to conclusions and doctors fall\ninto that as well and then what ends up\nhappening is a lot of times patients\ndon't get listened to and doctors will\nactually like make diagnoses and jump to\nconclusions and not actually like listen\nto or perform appropriate diagnostic\nworkups or in some cases what they'll do\nis actually appropriate diagnostic\nworkups that won't detect the condition\nso it's not that the patient is wrong or\nthe doctor is wrong we're both happen to\nbe right it's just the patient could be\nin in the exception right so like not\nall diagnosis appear the same way\nat the top of the list a great example\nof this is endometriosis so\nendometriosis is something that's\nactually quite common so what\nendometriosis means is that there's\nendometrial tissue outside of the uterus\nso generally speaking women will go\nthrough a menstrual cycle where their\nuterine lining grows and then as they\nget on their period as their period\nstarts as menstruation starts that\ntissue necrosis so it dies off and then\nthey Slough it off right so this is what\nhappens when you have your period\nnow the challenge is that sometimes\nendometrial tissue can be outside of the\nuterus and the thing is we're supposed\nto Slough off our uterine Linings during\nmenstruation and that's designed the\nbody is designed for that the challenge\nis that if you have endometrial tissue\noutside of the uterus it's not supposed\nto be there and so when you go through\nthis necrotic process it's incredibly\npainful the challenge though is that\noftentimes doctors will be very\ndismissive of this pain\nso this is the the real challenge is\nthat you know should you diagnose\nyourself I don't think so but I also\nthink it's very very important that if\nyou do go see a doctor and you do\nbelieve something and you have instincts\nabout what's wrong with you that you try\nto make that as clear as possible and if\nthe doctor's diagnosis of you feels\npremature incomplete or doesn't really\naccount for what's going on you don't\nhave a good explanation that ties up\nwhat you're experiencing with what\nthey're suggesting then I think that's\nreally worthy of further discussion and\nthis is where frankly a lot of my\ncolleagues and I myself have made this\nmistake as well will be kind of arrogant\nabout it right we start to think we know\nbetter than the patient we may know more\nthan the patient about diagnoses but\nit's still really really important\nbecause as a doctor what's your best\nsource of information your best source\nof information is actually the patient\nand what I tend to see that's kind of\ndisturbing is that a lot of doctors are\nnot paying attention to patients and so\nthat's where I sort of like get that you\nknow I think you should do your research\nI think you should develop hypotheses\nand then go in and talk to a medical\nprofessional about it\nbut be a little bit careful because\nunless you're trained in differential\ndiagnosis the challenge of\nself-diagnosing on the Internet is that\nthere could be a thousand other things\nthat create this constellation of\nsymptoms and if you really want to make\nan accurate diagnosis a part of that is\nruling out all of that other stuff\nso can you diagnose yourself on the\ninternet generally speaking I wouldn't\nrecommend it but I do think it's a good\nidea to educate yourself formula\nformulate hypotheses and try to share\nthose as transparently as possible with\na particular medical provider and\nhopefully they'll incorporate your\ninformation into their diagnostic\nexperience and that's usually when you\narrive at the best diagnosis\nquestions\nyou've seen arrogant and unconfident\ndoctors it's tough yeah absolutely\nso Seiko 5 is saying yes but doctors\ndon't necessarily care about feelings I\nwould say the good ones do\num so Rogue we're also saying would it\nbe reasonable to refer to Old medical\nfiles about yourself for what for\nself-diagnosis it can be\nbut I think especially when we're\ntalking about psychiatric diagnoses\npsychiatric diagnoses have a way of\npiling up\nright so what what happens is like no\none it's very hard for someone to remove\na diagnosis from your chart\nlike that takes a lot of work it's\nreally easy to dig like give someone a\nnew diagnosis so that's where I think\nyou've got to be very careful about some\ndiagnoses because just because it's in\nyour chart doesn't necessarily mean it's\ncorrect especially for mental health\nstuff\ncan becoming a parent bring on symptoms\nsure\nso the most I want to say not most\ncommon that's not correct but a very\ncommon\num\na very common first episode of mania\nfor bipolar disorder is post-pregnancy\nso we'll see oftentimes in the\npostpartum period that like people who\nare bipolar will like discover they are\nbipolar and then what happens is the\nstress of pregnancy and delivery like\ntriggers a full-blown Mania and then as\nyou talk to them and hopefully treat\nthem what you discover is that there are\na lot of warning signs like a lot of\nyellow flags in their history that show\nsort of like a cyclic mood but that\nnever sort of like that they were able\nto cope with or like didn't really\nimpair their function quite as much or\nthey just kind of like wrote it out\nwhere like so you sort of see that it\nwas always there and then the first\nepisode of mania is postpartum\nwhat if my family doctor doesn't listen\nto what I say do I just get a different\ndoctor I would start by talking to the\ndoctor\nright so if you all have a problem with\nyour doctor I think the first step is\nalways just talk to your doctor because\nthey're supposed to be on your side\nand sort of say like hey I'm I'm feeling\nlike you're not really listening to what\nI'm saying\njust talk to him about it\ncan I diagnose my doctor probably not\ndo you feel like many gen zeers are\ncarelessly self-diagnosing themselves\nwhat I think is careless about this\ngeneration is there's a\nthere's a balance between destigmatizing\nand like\nover generalizing so for a long time\nthere was there still is a stigma\nagainst mental illness so we did is we\ntook all the people at psychiatric\ndiagnoses we bundled them up and we\npushed them off\nto one corner of society\nand we discovered hey that's really\nharmful right so like unlike cancer\nwhere it's like oh you've got cancer\nlets everyone support this person\nbecause cancer is hard to deal with\nso when cancer happened we took people\nwho were in the corner and we brought\nthem in and we're like Hey we're going\nto take care of you\nif someone has like an accident right\nwhere they like are handicapped\nafterward let's say they like lose a leg\neveryone like comes around and we\nsupport that person through their\nillness\nbut if if you have depression or\nschizophrenia if you've got major\ndepressive disorder or schizophrenia\nlike then don't tell anyone\nso that was harmful then what happened\nis now that we have social media and\nstuff and we're in the process of\ndestigmatizing mental illness we're\nshowing\nhow common mental illness can be\nthe challenge is that sometimes we cross\na line into like really generalizing\ninto like normal features and calling in\na nois so I'll see all kinds of things\nthat I think are essentially within the\nrealm of normal behavior like difficulty\nwith Focus that people will\nautomatically jump to ADHD or\nautomatically jump to autism or Autism\nSpectrum Disorder\nright where they'll be like oh like this\nis a feature of autism like I have\ntrouble studying for organic chemistry\nthis is what it's like to have ADHD\ncan't study for organic chemistry it's\nlike\nthe organic chemistry is hard to study\nfor whether you have ADHD or not so\nsometimes I think what we're ending up\ndoing is pathologizing normal behavior"
