    "transcript": "a lot of times people with ADHD will\nessentially develop adaptive strategies\nthey'll start to structure their life in\na particular way to where the ADHD no\nlonger impacts them\nit's entirely possible\nso this can be accurate right so that\nthe brains of people with ADHD are loud\nso let me ask you something is your\nbrain louder or quieter\nin high stimuli or low stimuli\nenvironments so let's take a look right\nso let's think about this if the\nstimulus level is High versus low\nwhat is the volume\nin your head\nokay so we tend to find is that when the\nstimulus level is high the volume in\nyour head is going to be low and when\nthe stimulus level is low the volume in\nyour head is going to be high\nso this goes back to this other\nprinciple where basically our brain and\npeople with ADHD will Auto compensate\nfor a lack of stimulus by increasing\nparticular thoughts you got to be a\nlittle bit careful because if you get\ntoo high in terms of stimulus you'll\nkind of get overwhelmed but same general\nprinciple\nso if things are too hot too high if\nthings are too loud in your head just\nthink a little bit about the stimulus\nand I think it's kind of interesting\nbecause I've seen these kinds of tick\ntocks before and every one of these tick\ntocks\nwhat is the person\nis entirely possible right you never see\nthese tick tocks of people like eating\nat a cafe they're usually like at home\nwithout other people around which is\nwhat happens so your brain will try to\nover stimulate things like for everyone\nexperienced before I found out about\nadult ADHD\neverything is so loud and that pisses me\noff turns out you can live life on a\nlower volume and getting very\noverwhelmed by Sans in places like\ngrocery stores it's just another Center\nI'm not lazy do you have a task to do\nand you're kind of just sat there in\nyour head thinking about the task but\nnot getting the test started that's ADHD\nparalysis and oh my God it's frustrating\nas [ __ ]\nit's not normal to have to remind\nyourself to pay attention when someone's\ntalking to you often if someone's\ntelling me a story halfway through or\nsound like they're talking similish and\nit's not that I'm being rude and not\nlistening it's just my brain somewhere\nelse like always\nso that's just a few things let me know\nif you want a part two and press the\nplus button if you want to follow my\nADHD Journey from diagnosis to\nmedication so this once again goes back\nto what we're talking about about sort\nof\ndistractibility in stimuli so the key\nthing about ADHD is that when people\nhave ADHD they one of the symptoms one\nof the diagnostic criteria is\ndistractibility and so what does that\nmean distractibility it means that my\nattention\nis more easily shifted from one thing to\nanother so subjectively the way that\npeople experience that with ADHD is that\nif you look at a neurotypical person if\nI'm sitting at a cafe and I'm talking to\nsomeone across from me\nmy brain is able to drown out and\nsuppress external stimuli better than\nsomeone with ADHD\nso since I'm at less distractible my\nsubjective experience is that all I'm\ngoing to hear is the person who's\nsitting across from me if I have ADHD\nhowever since I'm more distractible my\nbrain is less able to suppress the other\nthings around me and so what that'll\nsort of manifest as is the sound will\nsubjectively feel louder than it would\nfor a neurotypical person so here I am\ntrying to focus on things there's so\nmuch loud noise and in the case of a\nneurotypical person when something\nbreaks through that sort of uh\nsuppression shield for lack of a better\nterm that's going to correlate with\nhigher volume right so if I'm sitting at\na cafe and someone starts yelling\nthat'll break through my suppression\nshield and it'll sort of gain my\nattention but in the case of ADHD our\nsuppression Shield is a little bit lower\nso it feels like things are louder\nthat pisses me off turns out you can\nlive life on a lower volume and getting\nvery overwhelmed by Sounds in places\nlike grocery stores it's just another\nCenter\nI'm not late okay so let's talk a little\nbit about how can you live life on a\nlower volume so there are a couple of\ndifferent things that you can do so so\nwe know that for example this person at\nthe end talks about medication so this\nis kind of interesting but medication\nfor ADHD it's kind of weird right\nbecause like if we think about\nmedication for ADHD like my mind is\nmoving too fast\nand if I think about a stimulant doesn't\nthat cause my mind to move faster so if\nI'm like a neurotypical person and I\ndrink caffeine my mind is going to start\nmoving faster right I'm not going to be\nas sluggish so sometimes people get kind\nof confused because how does like\nstimulant medication calm down the mind\nin people who have ADHD so it turns out\nthat actually what happens\nif you look at the brain of someone with\nADHD\nwe have our frontal lobes\nand our frontal lobes actually send\ninhibitory signals to other parts of our\nbrain\nlike our nucleus accumbens so this is\nwhere we inhibit impulses\nwe also inhibit emotions\nthrough the amygdala\nright\nso what happens when we actually have\nwhen we stimulate when we add stimulant\nmedication is we actually stimulate\nour inhibitory function of the brain we\nstimulate our brakes which is why we\nslow down which is why we're able to pay\nattention and so if you want to live\nlife quieter essentially what you need\nto do is increase your ability to attend\nto a particular stimuli and not be quite\nas distractible which you can do through\nstrengthening the frontal lobes so\nmeditation also works for this\nokay\namazing do you have a task to do and\nyou're kind of just sat there in your\nhead thinking about the task but not\ngetting the test started that's ADHD\nparalysis and so here's here's my\nconcern with this is I'm noticing this\ntrend in a lot of ADHD tick tocks where\npeople are really really over\ngeneralizing\nso you know like this is a 52 second\nTick Tock that has three concepts in it\nand so what I'm noticing is that people\nare just like really really over\ngeneralizing this may not be ADHD\nparalysis and furthermore ADHD paralysis\nis an umbrella term that means a lot of\ndifferent things and has a lot of\ndifferent discrete neuroscientific kind\nof principles the key thing is that we\nknow that ADH people with ADHD are more\nprone to procrastination but even\nprocrastination has different kinds of\nsources right so sometimes we\nprocrastinate because we're afraid of\nthe consequence sometimes we\nprocrastinate because we're\nperfectionistic sometimes we\nprocrastinate in the case of ADHD which\nis more more vulnerable to people with\nADHD because\nwe don't know how to operationalize the\ntask it's a it's an executive function\nproblem so executive function is the\npart of our brain that plans and\nexecutes tasks the challenge is that if\nwe kind of go to the brain of ADHD you\nknow when what we call ADHD paralysis\nmay have three different origins in the\nbrain so it could be frontal lobe\nproblem\nit could be a hippocamp I mean sorry a\nlimbic system problem\nso we know that for example we have\ndifficulty restraining our emotions we\nknow that emotions influence the\nbehavior of people with ADHD more but is\nit essentially emotions controlling us\nand that's why we're paralyzed or do we\nliterally not know how to get started\nbecause we feel so overwhelmed those are\ntwo very different things with very\ndifferent solutions and the problem with\nthese phrases like ADHD paralysis is\nthat if I look up solutions for ADHD\nparalysis like it's going to be all\nkinds of different stuff but discreetly\nwhat's going on in the brain is going to\nbe very very different\nwe go by the way if you all are\ninterested in the Neuroscience the ADHD\nguide that we have coming out in 14 days\nhas the most Neuroscience heavy stuff\nthat we've done because I do think\nthere's a lot to understand about\ndifferent parts of your brain and\ntargeting Solutions towards your\nparticular problem and the reason that\nwe go into that detail is because what\nI'm seeing as we go into more short form\ncontent is people just call something\nADHD paralysis\nand there are even studies on ADHD\nparalysis but we sort of realize if you\nlook at those studies that there are a\nlot of different mechanisms and the\nsolutions need to be tailored to where\nthe problem actually is\nsocial stuff right\num\nso let's take a look at this to remind\nyourself to pay attention when someone's\ntalking to you often if someone's\ntelling me a story halfway through or\nsound like they're talking simlish and\nit's not that I'm being rude and not\nlistening it's just my brain somewhere\nelse like always\nso that's just a few things let me know\nif you might think the next one is also\na little bit about\nrelationship so let's take a look so let\nme get this straight it's actually\nharder to maintain friendships and\nrelationships if you have ADHD\nyeah because people with ADHD have\nobject pertinence like infants have when\nplaying the game with peekaboo so if you\ndon't see people for a long time you\nforget they exist\nyeah even the ones I love and care about\nthe most\nand you also have emotional permanence\non top of that so if those people aren't\nconstantly reassuring you that they love\nand care about you you assume that they\nhate you\nyes and due to my intense subconscious\nfear of rejection I'll actually wind up\ncompletely socially isolating myself\nbut doesn't that make your depression a\nlot worse\nalso yes\nso like how do you have any friends\nhonestly I have no idea I'm so [ __ ]\nannoying okay\nso there's some things I like about this\nand some things about this that are\nseem very incorrect to me on the one\nhand I think this person starts out\nstrong right so get the straight it's\nactually harder to maintain friendships\nand relationships if you have ADHD this\nis correct so there's actually research\nthat goes into this which we'll dive\ninto in a second but then I think this\nis the other problem with a lot of these\ntick tocks is that they start to\nconflate a lot of different things okay\nso ADHD has nothing to do with like\nbeing sensitive to rejection that that's\nnot a diagnostic feature of ADHD now are\na lot of people with ADHD sensitive to\nrejection sure\nbut it's not due to ADHD and why is that\nkind of dangerous\nlet me let me put it to you all this way\nokay let's just finish watching this for\na second yeah\nbecause people with ADHD have object\npertinence like okay so we just gotta\nlist this object permanence okay that's\nweird infants have when playing the game\nof peekaboo so if you don't see people\nfor a long time you forget they exist I\ndon't think yeah even the ones I love\nand care about the most\nand you also have emotional permanence\non top of that so if those people I've\nnever heard the phrase emotional\npermanence I don't know what that means\nis that like a new thing\nTick Tock is too loud\npeople aren't constantly reassuring you\nthat they love and care about you you\nassume that they hate you assume that\nthey hate you this has nothing to do\nwith ADHD okay let's let's keep going\nyou\nwind up\nokay intense fear of rejection\nall right and this makes your depression\nworse all right so there's a lot of good\nstuff here but there's some stuff that\nthat\nyeah sorry for turning it up there's a\nlot of stuff here that we've gotta\nreally talk about for a second okay\nso\nI'm pretty sure people with ADHD have\nobject permanence\nso like what is the principle of object\npermanence let's talk about this\nso object permanence is the awareness\nthat things that I'm not directly\nperceiving\nactually continue to exist even though I\ndon't see them so this is I don't know\nif you'll understand this but the reason\nthat peekaboo is so fun for babies is\nbecause they don't have object\npermanence so when you play peekaboo and\nI go like this and you can't see my face\nthat means that I no longer exist so\nwhen you play peekaboo with a baby\nyou were literally like flashing in and\nout of existence in their mind so\nthey're like wow that person just\ncompletely disappeared from existence\nand now that they come back they're like\npopped into existence again it's it's\nwild right that's why babies love\npeekaboo and if you kind of think about\nit like peekaboo stops getting fun at\nsome point right and why does peekaboo\nstop getting fun because people develop\nobject permanence now as far as I know\nI mean I could be wrong like I'm not you\nknow I haven't read all of the\nscientific papers out there and who\nknows maybe this person has looked at a\nbunch of signs on object permanence and\nhas discovered that people with ADHD\ndon't have object permanence which would\nblow my mind\nbecause if that were true that would\nmean like if I had ADHD and like I\ndidn't see my car that would mean that I\nno longer realized that my car existed\nlike people wouldn't be able to drive to\nwork because they wouldn't understand\nthat a car exists the fridge would be\nlike completely empty all the time it\njust doesn't make sense\nthen they talk about emotional\npermanence which means that\nyou know if people like don't like you\nthey assume that they you assume that\nthey hate you and this is where I think\nwhat's starting to happen is they're\nconflating a lot of things with ADHD and\nhere's why this is important\nso if\nADHD causes fear of rejection\nwhy is this like kind of dangerous to do\nbecause it's true this is good because\nit captures a lot of the experience of\npeople with ADHD which we'll get to why\nthis happens but here's what bothers me\nabout it\nif I treat this\nokay\nif I treat someone's ADHD their fear of\nrejection does not go away but if it\nwere due to ADHD it would go away right\nso if like ADHD\ncauses inattention\nand then I treat the ADHD\nthen this would get better we'd actually\nlike fix this does that make sense so\nthis is why it's really important to not\nconflate certain symptoms of ADHD with\nlike and be clear on what you're\ntreating because if someone comes in\nwith a fear of rejection I treat their\nADHD their fear of rejection is not\ngoing to go away this is going to have\nto be dealt with independently\nso let's understand a couple of things\nabout ADHD in social situations there\nhave been studies\nthat demonstrate all kinds of really\ninteresting things so ADHD leads to\ninattention there's a whole video about\nthis in the guide by the way that walks\nthrough this okay\nso ADHD leads to inattention\nwhat does inattention do inattention\nmeans I can't pay attention in\nconversations\nso if I can't pay attention in\nconversations I'm going to have\ndifficulty with social relationships\nokay so there are studies\nthat show that kids with ADHD are\ninvited to birthday parties less than\nneurotypical kids so it starts really\nreally young\nif all of my friends are talking about\nPokemon and I'm seven years old and like\nI'm not paying attention I don't know\nwhat they're talking about I can't\nparticipate in the conversation and then\nsuddenly I start talking about\ncandy bars like everyone's gonna look at\nme like I'm a weirdo because like we're\nnot talking about candy bars\nand then other at other times like one\nkid is really really upset because they\ngot bullied on on you know in the on the\nplayground and then I start talking\nabout Pokemon because I'm so excited\nkids are going to kind of look at me\nlike I'm a weirdo\nand then that's going to lead to\ndifficulty with social relationships so\nliterally there have been studies that\nshow that kids with ADHD get invited to\nbirthday parties less\nso what this means is that this\ninattention then leads to social\nisolation\nthis social\nisolation can contribute to depression\nwe'll share some interesting statistics\nwith you all in a second this depression\nthen leads to fear of rejection\nand all this other stuff that the person\nis talking about\nokay but this is really important to\nunderstand is that this is not a direct\nconsequence of the ADHD\nthey're like a lot of steps in the\nmiddle and here's what I've seen like as\na clinician\nis that you can treat the ADHD\nand it'll improve\nyou know this stuff will get better\nbut this is the whole point is that when\nyou're working with someone with ADHD\nand depression which they allude to at\nthe end this has a completely different\ntreatment this is not going to get\ntouched by treating ADHD\nespecially this stuff so even some of\nthe social isolation like this you could\nargue will improve some as you start to\nlike you know get better\nso this is what's kind of interesting is\nthat if you look at people who have ADHD\nand depression which by the way there's\na very high commodity comorbidity\nthis is what you find\nso for people who have both\nif you start with depression\nas a kid\nthere's a three percent chance that you\nwill have ADHD as an adult\nif you start with ADHD\nas a kid\nthere is a 70 chance that you will have\ndepression as an adult\nthere is a huge causative link here\nwhich is very different\ndoes that make sense\nso this is what's really important about\nthis is like your fear of rejection and\nabandonment isn't a part of ADHD it's\nlike a separate process that's a\nconsequence of usually growing up with\nuntreated ADHD\nit's huge\nonce again we go into all this uh this\nis all in the guide in a bunch of detail\nso if you all are really curious about\nthat so how does it lead to depression\nlet's just give you a quick spoilerino\nso people with ADHD have lower academic\nachievement\nlower social connections\nthere's even evidence like we talked\nabout the birthday parties teachers give\nthem less attention teachers give\nless\nnegative attention I mean sorry less\npositive attention\nright\nbecause like you have trouble in school\nso they'll give you attention but it's\nit's like because you're screwing up\nthey're not going to encourage you and\nthey'll say like oh like you're like\nyou're so good at this like good job you\nknow I think you should go to a honors\nclass next year because you've really\ngot talent in it they don't get this\nkind of positive attention lower\nacademic achievement\nleads to\nworse educational performance\nthis leads to worse job prospects\nand then by the way\ndifficulty with social connections also\nleads towards job prospects so there's\nstudies that show that inability to\nparticipate in work social situations\nlike a neurotypical person leads to a\nlower advancement lower wages lower\npromotions Etc\nso this kind of stuff and then you end\nup sort of like being behind other\npeople in life which in turn leads to\ndepression\nso the two are very I understand why\nthis person is conflating the two\nbecause oftentimes people with ADHD will\nexperience both of these things the\nproblem is that we've got to be a little\nbit sophisticated here and recognize\nthat these are actually two separate\nprocesses because fixing the ADHD isn't\nnaturally going to make the fear of\nrejection go away\n[Music]\nforeign\nyeah so this is pretty accurate too so\nlet's kind of talk about this right so\nthere's like number one is over sharing\nin team meetings this is common so\noftentimes that impulsivity is going to\nlead to over sharing careless mistakes\nis due to inattention right that's what\nwe mean by careless so it's like a\nmistake that like you didn't you weren't\npaying attention so you kind of like\ndelete something that you shouldn't have\nnow this is really interesting\nso taking on too much responsibility is\nwhere we really have to Tunnel down so\nthere are a couple of different reasons\nwhy people with ADHD do this one is that\nthey feel like they're trying to make up\nfor the other stuff right so if I make a\ncareless mistake\npeople think less of me and what do I\nhave to do to fix that oh this is loud\ndude it's already so low\nokay\num so when we take on too much\nresponsibility sometimes it's because we\nfeel like we screwed up at work so we\nhave to make up for it and then what we\nend up doing is signing ourselves up for\nlike more stuff which we are actually\nkind of digging ourselves into a hole\nbecause we kind of make it a careless\nmistake once if we take on more\nresponsibility it doesn't mean that\nwe're not going to make a careless\nmistake again so you've got to be really\ncareful about taking on what I would\ncall a compensatory responsibility\ndon't take on responsibility to make up\nfor something in the past because you're\njust kind of really setting yourself up\nfor failure there\nthe other reason that people take on too\nmuch responsibility is because of\nimpulsivity right so remember that in\nADHD our frontal lobes are not as good\nat planning and executing tasks which\nmeans that we're not really good at\nsequencing out okay I'm going to sign up\nfor the project what does that mean\nbecause when my brain assesses risk\nassesses Resource Management it's like\noh that's easy I can take care of that\nsuper easy\nand so sometimes we'll sign up for stuff\nand we don't really realize\nwhat we're getting into\nthe other reason that that gets really\ncomplicated is part of the reason that\nwe will sometimes\nsign up for really difficult tasks is\nbecause sometimes with people people\nwith ADHD you know that you can actually\nget a ton of stuff done in two hours\nlike there was a work a project at work\nthat was taking other people a week but\nlike you banged it out in like one day\nso sometimes you do have those shining\nsuccesses which your brain is aware of\nand so it'll sign up for stuff because\nif you can get all the stars aligned to\na line you can knock it out of the park\nso this is this is a really good one\nthat goes into a little bit more\num you know some subtleties there but\ngood only working on projects due\ntomorrow yeah that's where I don't know\nhow to say this but let's take a quick\nlook at this so when people have ADHD\nso we have a tendency to get overwhelmed\nright so our let's say this is\num\nlet's say this is like\npanic\nand this is effort\nso what we essentially do is we'll like\nuse panic\nto increase our effort so sometimes\npeople with ADHD will like use last\nminute panic\nas something like they need that stress\nlevel to get their brain to focus\nso maybe this is actually focus is a\nbetter thing for this x-axis I mean\ny-axis\nbut this is really common\n[Music]\noh so this is important so because of\nthe consequences of inattention and\ndistractibility sometimes people with\nADHD\ndo actually like end up working more\nright so like they spend more time\ntrying to work\nthis is why if you look at\num\nthings like CBT for ADHD even part of\nthe clinical treatment for ADHD and\nPsychotherapy actually doesn't involve\ntalking about your feelings a portion of\nwhat's actually really really effective\nis is organizational skills and focusing\nskills so that too we dig into a lot\nbecause that's not actually I mean it's\na part of clinical treatment but it's\nnot like learning how to use a calendar\nis not exclusive to psychotherapy right\nbut it turns out that if you teach\npeople with ADHD some of these\norganizational techniques it'll boost\ntheir productivity and they won't\nactually have to work extra so excessive\ndisagreements and arguments with\nco-workers this is kind of tricky so\nsometimes people with ADHD this is true\nof some people but not others so a\ncouple of things to think about one is\nwhether you have kind of the emotional\ndysregulation subtype\nwith ADHD the other issue is that\nsometimes you're kind of just not paying\nattention right or like you're not able\nto articulate what you're kind of saying\nand that can lead to things like\ndisagreements if you have ADHD and\nyou've been in a relationship where\neverything was great in the beginning\ny'all were spending every single day\ntogether we were doing all these\nactivities and over time the effort\ndropped right and you didn't feel any\ndifferently about the person but you\njust kind of got a little bit busier\nright or you didn't have as much time to\ndedicate to doing certain things then I\nwant you to know you're not alone right\nwith the ADHD brain a lot of times the\nthings that Fascinate us are things that\nyou know either have like a time limit\non it there's a deadline coming up or\nthings that are new and exciting right\nor something that's unpredictable\nsomething that keeps us curious it keeps\nus going so a lot of times in\nrelationships is that same exact way\nright and what you can do to help\nprevent this love bombing sort of thing\nright it's not love vomit but it almost\nseems like what's this kind of talking\nthat you can do is to set batteries in\nthe beginning right make sure that\nyou're taking some time to spend with\nyourself as you meet this new person and\npace yourself so that way you're not\nletting somebody you know feel that hurt\nat the end when the dopamine wears off\nright so I just thought I'd share that\nwith you wait what let me just make sure\nI understand this if you have ADHD and\nyou've been in a relationship where\neverything was great in the beginning\nokay so relationships are great at the\nbeginning do all these activities and\nover time the effort dropped right and\nyou didn't feel any differently about\nthe person effort drops it's kind of got\na little bit busier right or you didn't\nhave as much time to dedicate to doing\ncertain things then I want you to know\nyou're not alone right the ADHD brain a\nlot of times the things that Fascinate\nus are things that you know either have\nlike a time limit on it there's a\ndeadline coming up or things that are\nnew and exciting right or something\nthat's unpredictable something that\nkeeps us curious it keeps us going so a\nlot of times in relationships is that\nsame exact weight right and what you can\ndo to help prevent this love bombing\nsort of thing right okay this is where\nhe loses it almost seems like that one\nthing that you can do is to set\nbatteries in the beginning right\nI'm so confused by this I don't\nunderstand the chain of okay so like\nsometimes relationships are\nso like I understand some pieces of it\nbut I don't understand all of it so like\nokay let's just start at the top\nso new relationships are exciting\nand then over time\nthey get less exciting I don't see what\nthat has to do with ADHD\nover time sometimes we get busier also\nsometimes we don't\num so this kind of makes sense right\nbecause he talks about the ADHD brain\nlike oftentimes where we do things that\nare more time dependent that makes a lot\nof sense we just talked about\nprocrastination and panic\num and we prefer things that are new\nexciting but I don't think that's\nspecific to ADHD I mean sure like people\nare more distractible\nbut this is I don't understand the love\nbombing can someone explain that to me\nlike what does love bombing have to do\nwith this okay so he's equating the end\nof the honeymoon phase with ADHD\nand then setting boundaries pacing\nyourself\nI\nI don't\nI'm not saying the dude is wrong I'm\njust saying I I feel like there's just a\nlot of regular stuff about relationships\nhere and like I feel like people talk\nabout boundary setting but like I I\nset what boundaries\npace yourself like don't hang out with\nthe person as much\nis that what they're saying\nI I'm just I'm not I don't understand\nwhat they're saying I'm not saying it's\nwrong\nit makes sense right so some of the\nstuff that he's saying makes sense like\nthere's um you know the the pressure on\ntime limit so maybe like when something\nisn't new and exciting\nlike\nyou know there's no pressure to maintain\nthe relationship so you kind of fall out\nof it like that that makes sense to me I\njust don't really I don't understand the\nlove bombing and the boundary setting I\nI don't know what to say about this\nI feel like there's you know maybe\nanother 30 seconds to really draw out\nthat chain would have been more useful\nat least for me someone's asking how do\nyou cure ADHD so a couple of things to\nunderstand so a lot of psychiatric\nillnesses we don't really\nbelieve\nare in our model of disease we don't\nreally believe that or I mean you can\nsort of cure them but like we don't\nreally know that they can be cured\nso some of this may be somewhat organic\nand somewhat\nwhen I say somewhat permanent take that\nwith a grain of salt so here's why so we\nknow for example that the majority of\npeople who Experience One depressive\nepisode in their life I think this is\naccurate\nthe most common number of depressive\nepisodes for people who experienced a\npreface of episodes is one\nso the majority of people that we're\naware of or maybe it's not a majority\ncould be a plurality but\nlike a lot of people will just\nExperience One depressive episode and\nit'll like never come back so that that\nnumber is actually quite High\num and I may be wrong on that statistic\nbut I I think it's still quite High even\nif it's not the most\nso does that mean that that person has\nbeen cured of depression like we're not\nreally sure\nin terms of ADHD so this is really\ninteresting so when you go through\nPsychotherapy for ADHD we do know that\nsome portion of people who go through\nPsychotherapy for ADHD will\ntwo years out even after two years after\ncompleting Psychotherapy will many of\nthem will not experience any negative\nimpacts from their ADHD\nso that's kind of interesting so that's\nnot true of medication\nso what we sort of know is that a lot of\ntimes people with ADHD will essentially\ndevelop adaptive strategies they'll\nstart to structure their life in a\nparticular way to where the ADHD no\nlonger impacts them\na good example of this was the whole\nlike you know vegetables in the side\ndoor drawer and condiments in the\nvegetable drawer so people will figure\nout adaptations to where if you do\nsomething like that\nyou'll no longer like waste your veggies\nright so then like effectively you've\nmanaged to adapt\nso is that a cure I'm I'm not sure I\nthink it's just you learn how to live\nwith whatever way your brain is which\nhas nothing to do with ADHD it's just\nsome people have to learn how to do that\num wow then what is it about the\nduration factor in depression and ADHD\nyeah so that's where things get\ncomplicated right so you know our\nscience is like okay but we still don't\nreally understand this stuff too well\nat the end of the day like we don't\nunderstand Psychiatry anywhere near as\nwell is what we are like we understand\nlike Cardiology Nephrology like you know\nwe understand these things way better\nthan we understand the brain or the mind\nI think the brain and the mind if you\neven consider the mind a thing are like\nthe final frontiers of medicine they're\nthe organs that we understand the least\nit's gotten to the point where you know\nwe can breathe without lungs like we\nhave ECMO extra corporeal membranous\noxygenation\nso like your lungs can be completely\ngone and you can we can still keep you\nalive we've got dialysis where your\nkidneys can be completely non-functional\nand we can keep you alive we've learned\nhow to replace those organs\neven to a certain degree things like\ncardiac bypass right so which will keep\npeople on temporarily\nwill pump your heart for you we haven't\nfigured out how to replace the brain yet\nand we haven't figured out how to\nreplace the mind we're not even there's\neven debate on whether the Mind exists\nso I think there is some surgeon out\nmaybe in Italy or something who's trying\nto do brain transplants or head\ntransplants\nhow to learn how to so Ultra Mega pint\nis asking how to learn how to talk\nbetter when you have ADHD my thoughts\nare often all over the place and it\noften puts me in embarrassing situations\nyeah so this may sound kind of\nfrustrating but basically you got to\npractice so\none thing that you can do is write your\nthoughts out so like use so this is the\nkey thing so a lot of people okay let me\nthink about this\nlet me start with the question again\nthis is actually a great question how to\nlearn to talk better when you have ADHD\nmy thoughts are often all over the place\nand it often puts me in embarrassing\nsituations\nso here's the thing to understand about\nADHD when your brain is different a lot\nof people are trying to figure out okay\nhow can I learn to talk better how can I\nlearn something up here that will make\nmy ADHD better the key thing that a lot\nof people they actually don't get is\nthat the if you want to improve you\ndon't need to improve up here you need\nto improve externally\nso a lot of overcoming the deficits of\nADHD has nothing to do with learning how\nto talk better has nothing to do with\nNeuroscience it has everything to do\nwith external tools\nso for example write out your speaking\npoints how can I learn how to like be\nless forgetful you can't learn to be I\nmean maybe you can you can actually but\nthat's not actually what has shown\nscientifically to be the most effective\nway for people to like be less forgetful\nit's not cognitive training it's\nactually using external tools like\ncalendars reminders things like that\nso this is what's really important if\nyou struggle with ADHD you don't\nnecessarily need to do the lifting up\nhere you can do the lifting externally\nand for people who start to use those\nadaptive external strategies they're the\nimpact of their ADHD goes down in their\nlife drastically that's why even if you\nlook at cognitive behavioral therapy for\nADHD\nit's not just talking about your\nemotions it's like literally a part of\nthat is going to be teaching people how\nto get organized and how to prioritize\nif that makes sense\nso oftentimes I think the biggest\nmistake that people with ADHD make is\nthey try to solve everything up here\nwhereas you should use an external tool\ninstead and then you don't have to fix\nit up here right\nhow do you apply that when talking to\nsomeone in the moment so a couple of\ndifferent things\none is you can just organize your\nthoughts a little bit in your head like\nexplicitly\nso you know if you train yourself to\nwrite things out before you speak\nthen like as you train yourself in that\nprocess you can sort of do it\nautomatically in your head as well or\nnot automatically but you can do it even\nwithout pen and paper so first I'm going\nto say this then I'm going to say this\nthen I'm going to say this the next\nthing I know it sounds kind of weird but\nin the moment you can also jot it down\nright we're in a conversation you can\njust like have a notepad and just like\njot a couple things down it may seem\nweird\nbut\nyou know like\nit works well\nlike I'll do that sometimes like I don't\nknow if y'all notice but when I\ninterview people like I'm taking notes\nand even when I'm having serious\nconversations with people I'll\noftentimes whip out a piece of paper and\njust keep track of stuff\nit just looks weird\nbut like over time if someone asks you\nabout it or you can even offer a\ndisclaimer and you can say hey like\nI just want to keep track of a couple of\nthings because a lot of what you're\nsaying sounds really important\nand then it's a little bit odd sure but\nis it going to cause the negative impact\nthat\nlike verbal diarrhea is going to cause\nto the conversation absolutely not\nespecially if you're talking about\nsomething like a work meeting right if\nyou're sitting in a work meeting and\nthere's a live conversation going on and\nyou're taking notes no one is going to\nthink that's weird"
