    "transcript": "until you accept what has happened to\nyou you're kind of stuck in the past if\nonly I had dot dot dot if only I'd\nstudied harder if I only I had taken\nclasses seriously if only I hadn't dated\nthis person if only I had done this this\nthen I wouldn't be in this scenario\nright now and so what your mind actually\nspends its time doing is instead of\nfocusing on the present focusing on what\nyou can do to get out of this all it\nthinks about is what you should have\ndone differently to avoid the situation\nwhich if you think about it as cognitive\nenergy that will never help you because\nyou can't actually go back into time\nit's like all of your problem solving\nenergy is going to rewrite the past\nwhich is physically impossible instead\nof trying to figure out what to do in\nthe present so this is where acceptance\ncomes in so acceptance sort of takes all\nthat crap from the past and then kind of\nlike let's it all go and then you kind\nof accept where you are now"
