    "transcript": "you have all these people like pickup\nartists that are purely focused on the\nPractical aspect but don't understand\nanything of the internal struggles you\nface when people give you advice can you\nmake a video about virginity I'm an\nadult virgin and I'm massively insecure\nabout it I used to have a ton of\ninsecurities tied to my virginity\nthinking I hadn't had sex because I\nwasn't funny enough interesting enough\nkind enough attractive enough Etc Dr K's\nvideos I've managed to separate all of\nthese insecurities from my virginity I\nhave friends including girls that think\nI'm funny interesting kind attractive\nbut despite this just the fact that I've\nnever had sex\nbothers me no matter how much I try to\nconvince myself it doesn't mean anything\na part of my mind goes to the fact that\nI want to but haven't and it might it\nmust be because of some kind of flaw and\nSociety claims to be supportive of\nvirgins especially on the internet but\nin reality it's not the case I get\nbullied made fun of pitied\nEtc and even if people don't actually\ncare if you're a virgin when they use it\nas an insult it hurts for example when\nsomeone says something misogynistic and\nsomeone says you've clearly never felt\nthe touch of a woman it still feels like\na personal insult implying that people\nwho can't get laid are like that because\nthey're misogynistic when in reality\nsome of the people I know who are the\nmost popular with girls are massively\nmisogynistic when people offer advice\nfor dealing with this it's always\nuseless they either say it's easy to get\nlaid and it's your own fault if you\ncan't which makes the insecurities worse\nor they say you just shouldn't care like\nI don't battle\nlike I don't battle to convince myself\nevery day that it's not something to be\nashamed of and that I could just just\nwake up one day and become unbothered\nwith ease which also makes the\ninsecurities worse because now I'm both\ninsecure about being a virgin and about\ncaring just change just be different or\nthey say work on yourself which is good\nGeneral Life advice and something I do\nand helps a a lot in many parts of my\nlife but does not help at all for this\nparticular issue even in this community\nI've heard those kinds of things the\nonly people who actually seem to listen\nand validate your experience are red\npillars and black pillars but I don't\nagree with either of those communities\nthe only person who seems to actually\nunderstand and offer use useful advice\nto lonely men without turning to\nmisogyny as Dr K which is why I really\nfeel like it would be really helpful if\nhe made a video specifically on the\ntopic of how to not be ashamed when\nyou're a virgin despite trying to get\nlaid okay looks like I have big shoes to\nfill really appreciate the post I think\nit's really great that we have a place\nthat we can talk about this kind of\nstuff without resorting to toxic\ncommunities so let's try to understand\nlike what's the deal with virginity it's\nlike sometimes\nwe are virgins\nright so we're at a particular age you\nknow I've heard people complain about\nbeing a virgin at the age of 30 35 even\n60 65 was talking to a monk once was\ntalking about his regrets in life\num but also like 19 18 17 even 15. so we\nall are not all but Society basically\nconditions us to Value being able to\nhave sex and it sort of makes sense from\nan evolutionary perspective right like\nso like the purpose of life is\nprocreation so like if you're not\nprocreating you're like not worthy in\nsome way and then that that kind of\nmaybe General evolutionary thing then\ngets extrapolated over interpreted you\nknow pulled far far far away from\nevolutionary biology and people start\nmaking generalizations in society about\nyour value as a human being whether\nyou've gotten laid or not laid right\nlike people do that and so a lot of\npeople out there who try to be\nsupportive and it's like hey you know\njust like work on yourself like you'll\nbe okay like it's all right and I think\nthat this is whereas the person sort of\nmentioned the red pill and in the black\npill communities are very emotionally\nvalidating in this way right they're the\none place where people are going to sort\nof like acknowledge that this is a\nproblem they're gonna do very different\nthings with it so the red pill Community\nis here's a guide to get laid right it's\nkind of like this is the way the world\nthe black pill Community is gonna and\nI'm generalizing here as well you can't\nget laid you're screwed just like we are\nwe might as well all give up right\nbecause there's no hope so if you're\nsomeone who's a virgin and you're\ninsecure about it which sort of makes\nsense right because like the reason\nyou're insecure is because there is this\nsocietal pressure and even if some\npeople are supportive like people still\nkind of like you know you're going to\nget a double take even if someone's\ntrying to be nice and you kind of tell\nthem oh yeah I've never had sex before\nlike let's say you're on your third date\nwith someone you're like yeah I've never\nhad sex before because right because you\nall are talking about previous Partners\nlike you're gonna get a double take like\nyou're gonna get that tiny amount of\njudgment you're gonna get it like oh you\nknow and then like what does that mean\nis there something wrong with this\nperson like like what are they thinking\nnow like do I want to have sex with\nsomeone who's never had sex before like\nthere's all kinds of like implants\njudgments and then the problem is that\nif we're in this situation there isn't\nreally a clear way out right so is this\nan issue of insecurity and shame because\nif this is an issue of insecurity and\nshame like I can go work on myself I can\ngo learn about my insecurities I can\nmeditate I can go see a therapist I can\nlearn about all this stuff and I can\neven fix my insecurity and shame but\nfixing your insecurity and shame doesn't\nlike automatically mean you're gonna get\nlaid right like obviously but the people\nwho sort of advise you to fix the\ninsecurity and shame and like don't\nworry about being a virgin it's not like\nyou've you can do that but it's it's not\nlike people are lining up outside the\ndoor it's like you you you're like I'm\ncured of Shame and you walk around with\nlike a sign and then people are like oh\nlike let's have sex it doesn't work like\nthat on the flip side there are people\nwho are sort of giving you like advice\non how to get laid right if your problem\nis that you're a virgin go get laid\nhere's how you uh so this person is I\nthink a man who's interested in women so\nlet's assume a heteronormative\nperspective here although the shame\nespecially amongst homosexual men is\nlike I know it sounds bizarre but can be\nvery very high I've almost seen more\nshame in homosexual men because there's\na presumption that if I'm gay like gay\ndudes are down to have sex like all the\ntime so if if you can't get laid like\nall that kind of stuff again the shame\ncan be really really crippling for\nhomosexual men shame can be crippling\nfor women as well for the same reason\nit's like oh like dudes are down to get\nlaid any time so if I can't get laid and\nI'm a woman like there must be something\neven worse right so there's all kinds of\nstuff like the shame is is piling on and\nwhen it comes to actually like going out\nand let's say getting laid like they're\npeople who will tell you all this kind\nof stuff like oh just like get out more\nand like go meet people and things like\nthat but when you go do that like I\ndon't know how to say this but if you go\nif people say like okay just meet more\npeople so let's say like I go to a party\nokay if I go to a party and like I am\ninsecure about myself and I am ashamed\nabout myself for being a virgin how do\nyou think that's going to affect how I\nbehave at the party\nhow do you think that's going to affect\nlike how I talk to girls right so now\nthis is the challenges that a lot of\npeople are giving advice about what to\ndo you can sign up for some course we'll\nlike teach you like like how to date\nlike oh my God like I'm going to teach\nyou all the secrets that will get you\nlaid and then you do that but then\nyou're carrying this bundle of\ninsecurity which actually sort of\nbecomes a self-fulfilling prophecy\nbecause if you lack confidence and you\ngo to a social situation then like\nthat's Gonna Shine through in some way\nright and it's going to sabotage your\nefforts to form intimate connections\nwith people so what do we like what do\nyou do if you're in this situation\nbecause fixing the shame isn't enough\nand also like just going out and trying\nto get laid doesn't work and there's a\nreally simple reason for this and that's\nbecause the two things are synergistic\nso if you really want to learn how to\novercome this you've kind of got to do\nboth and this is actually what I found\nreally frustrating when I was learning\nto be a therapist when I was still\ntraining to be a therapist I remember I\nwas and so this could be a bias of my\nparticular education you know which on\npaper is good but you know no no\ntraining program is going to be perfect\nbut one of the things that really\nfrustrated me about therapy is that the\nstandard in therapy is if a patient\nwalks into your office and says can you\nhelp me find a girlfriend the right\nanswer is not yes the right answer is\nwell what do you think what do you think\nmakes it hard for you to find a\ngirlfriend right what does it mean to\nyou if I were to say yes what would it\nmean to you if I would say no And when I\nsay the right answer this is literally\nwhat I was instructed to say that you\ncan't ever help a patient accomplish a\nparticular thing I mean you actually you\ncan help but you can't make them\naccomplish a particular thing right so\npeople would come into the office and\nlike the therapist cannot give you a\nplan to find a girlfriend which is sort\nof correct and in one sense but it\nreally kind of bothered me and that's\nwhen I realized that you know what\ntherapy is really about the focus is\nreally about sort of fixing that\ninternal shame which isn't enough it's\nabsolutely stepping the right direction\nand therapists can absolutely help you\nif you're in the situation so don't\ndon't get me wrong there but it's that\ntherapy is really not focused on that\npractical aspect and on the flip side\nyou have all these people like pickup\nartists that are purely focused on the\nPractical aspect but don't understand\nanything of the in internal struggles\nyou face when people give you advice\nwhich is why advice is useless right so\nlike this person says advice is useless\nbecause if someone says yeah just go out\nand just just talk to girls but like\nwhat about this roiling bundle of\nemotions that makes that impossible for\nme so what we've actually got to do is\nlook at the intersectionality between\ntwo things it's to acknowledge that\nfirst of all working on your shame is\ngoing to be insufficient and going to\nparties is going to be insufficient that\nthis is a solution that's kind of like\nChopsticks like you can't get anywhere\nwith one chopstick you need both of them\nright I guess you could spear something\ndepending on what it is but Jet and\nthat's right so I don't know the analogy\nfell apart but I feel like you need both\nof these things so we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about that okay so if you're\nstruggling to get laid we're going to\ntalk a little bit about insecurities and\nnot feeling confident in yourself as a\nvirgin and more importantly how to\npractically apply that to like an action\nplan that will get you to where you want\nto go so let's take a look at this okay\nhere's the problem\nokay so we start life and we've got a\ntrajectory and generally speaking it\nwhat happens in life is that we'll have\nparticular Milestones or opportunities\nso let's say that like I enter High\nSchool let's say this is the normal path\nwhere I date someone in high school or I\ndeviate and I never date in high school\nright and then what happens is we've got\nanother path over here where date\nsomeone in college or deviate no dates\nin college right and then at some point\nwe're also going to have lose virginity\nor be a 26 year old virgin and now the\nproblem is that like once we kind of\nmiss these Milestones we've missed we're\nkind of behind in two ways the first is\nthat each of these things is going to\nlead to an insecurity or an identity\nright let's just say I'm unlovable\nugly unable to get laid call it whatever\nyou want okay but this is like an\nidentity that you carry forward now the\nproblem is that even at this stage when\nyou go to a party this identity actually\ngoes and sabotages your attempts to get\nback on track so it stops you from\nmoving in this direction does that make\nsense because when you go to a party and\nyou start talking to someone say you're\ntalking to a girl we're gonna assume a\nheteronormative male perspective because\nthat's what the post was right applies\nany way you want to cut it though this\nthought this insecurity actually\nprevents you from getting back on track\nthe second problem is as we have these\nexperiences we level up our social\nskills right so social XP here social XP\nhere and so if you look at this person\nthis person in addition to not having\nthe identity issues is also like level\nfive when it comes to social skills\nright so now we get to see something\nelse which is that even if I fix this so\nlet's say that I make this and then I\ncan go to the party the problem is that\nover here I still have level one social\nskills and so now even though I've sort\nof fixed the shame I go to a party like\nI just don't know how to talk to people\nlike I don't know how to flirt right\nbecause this person is not like an\nexpert flirter and if I go to a party\nand I don't know how to flirt I fail my\nflirting check then what happens\nI still end up over here and so then\nwhat happens is like I try all kinds of\ndifferent stuff right so people are like\nthey'll say like oh try this and try\nthis and try this and try this and and\nif I'm trying different things what's\ngoing to happen is this keeps on\nsabotaging stuff or even if I sort of\nresolve that I just don't have the\nsocial skills and then what happens is\nas I fail these kinds of things or if I\ngo to parties right and I don't get laid\nwhat happens as I fail my flirting check\nnow I'm going over here and I'm\nreinforcing these kinds of thoughts does\nthat make sense so we get trapped as a\nvirgin the Virgin trap missed social\nMilestones internal insecurities\nsabotage are future prospects and then\nthe problem is that even if we recognize\nthis we can try to fix the insecurities\nbut then we're not leveled up enough or\nwe just go out and we try to fix things\nlike we just try to level up right we're\njust like we're just going to socially\nparticipate but we've got this huge\npenalty to all of our checks because of\nthe identity issues and the insecurity\nso how do we overcome this first thing\nwe got to do watch out for General\nrealizations so I want you all to take a\nlook at this what do you all notice\nabout this post Society claims to be\nsupportive it feels like a personal\ninsult it's always useless right people\nthat offer advice like so you got to be\nreally careful or they say work on\nyourself which is General good life\nadvice you know so you've got to be\nreally careful about generalization so\nif you look at these communities like\nred pillars and black pillars most of\nthese communities are going to be\nrelatively generalizing and so why is it\nimportant to avoid generalizations\nbecause that's not how people actually\nwork right so we talked about this a\nlittle bit but it could be things that\nare generally true but at the end of the\nday you're an individual person and like\nthe person that you're trying to date or\nyou're trying to have sex with is an\nindividual person and generalizations\nhappen very very naturally so like let's\ntry to understand where generalizations\ncome from so there are two basic things\nthat happen that we have to be super\ncareful about the first is that the\nhuman brain is designed to generate\npatterns it's designed to generalize\nthat's why we do it like that's like if\nyou look up at Clouds for example and\nyou see animals there aren't animals and\nclouds that's your pain brain generating\na pattern out of like random data that's\nfirst thing the second thing is the\nhuman brain is biased towards the\nnegative what does that mean that means\nthat you talk to 20 people about being a\nvirgin and 19 of them are supportive and\none of them is unsupportive your brain\nwill actually latch on to the one out of\nout of 20. right so there have been\nstudies on this so a good example of\nthis this is a common one that I use\nillustrates the principle well food\npoisoning so you can eat the same dish\n20 times first 19 times you don't get\nfood poisoning you get food poisoning\nonce and your body is going to have a\nvisceral biological reaction to avoid\nthat thing we also see it in content\ncreators where you can be looking at\nchat right if you're streaming on Twitch\nor you can upload a video to YouTube and\nthere can be a hundred good comments but\nyour brain will sift out the one\nnegative comment now why does it do that\nit's because it's a survival mechanism\nbecause chances are it's like you know\nif there are 19 ropes or 20 ropes in my\nshed and one of them is a snake I need\nto be able to find the One Bad Apple\namongst all the Good Apples because the\nBad Apple is the one that really screws\nme up right so our brain is biased\ntowards the negative and biased to\ngenerate patterns when we put these two\nthings together what we end up with is\nnegative generalizations about the world\nonce we have negative generalizations\nlike why is that a bad thing it's\nbecause it actually sabotages our future\nefforts if I go into social situations\nbelieving that Society hates me because\nI'm a virgin that resentment towards\nSociety is not going to be attractive to\nother people so I can't just tell you\njust don't do that but what I'm saying\nis like pay attention to what's going on\nhere so anytime you have a\ngeneralization ask yourself how did I\nform that generalization and then you've\ngot to be super careful because the\ninternet loves Echo Chambers so you have\none negative experience and then the\nnice thing about the red pill and black\npill communities are that they're\nvalidating they're supportive like\nthat's a good thing right they're like\noh like you suffer I suffer for two I'm\nsorry that you're suffering so much and\nthen as soon as you join that Community\nyou get stuck in the Echo chamber and\nthen lots of people are validating you\nand then you accumulate evidence to\nsupport your generalization now the\nchallenge is that once you start\ngeneralizing and once you start kind of\nbelieving that stuff it's actually going\nto sabotage your attempts at kind of\ngetting into stuff in a healthy way so\nonce you sort of are aware of that\ncautionary principle become aware of\nwhere your generalizations come from be\nbecome aware of more importantly we'll\nget to this in a second how your\ngeneralizations influence your actual\nactions okay and now we're going to take\nwe're going to go back to the drawing\nboard and take a look at that okay so\nthis is kind of the the first thing to\nsort of understand the second thing is\nthat we need a synergistic approach what\ndoes that mean that means that we have\nto deal with the shame and we have to\nlevel up socially neither of these is\ngoing to be sufficient on their own in\nthe most common mistake that I see when\nanyone is talking about like getting\nlaid or forming a relationship or\nwhatever is that they assume that\nthere's like one part of the answer I\nhear either or go to a therapist to go\nwork on your internal shame issues\ntherapist isn't going to teach you how\nto flirt or go to a dating coach to\nlearn how to flirt dating coach isn't\ngoing to fix your shame issues that's\nwhy this problem persists because we\ndon't have a professional that can do\nboth now how do you do these right okay\nso first thing ask yourself this\nquestion how do I feel about\nmyself write it down on one piece of\npaper ideally pen or pencil instead of\ntyping now you can answer this question\nreflexively right you're going to get a\nreflexive response here's why the\nreflexive response isn't good enough\nbecause the reflexive response is going\nto come from the generalization it's not\nan actual response it's going to be like\nan emotional response it's going to be a\ngeneral response so be careful about so\nwrite it out the second half of what you\nwrite is where the money is going to be\nso become aware of I guess for lack of a\nbetter term you know self-opinion this\nisn't really important we'll show you\nhow or why later number two\nhow do I feel about other people once\nagain write minimum one page there's\ngoing to be a reflexive answer other\npeople are okay I like other people\nuh no you don't and then if you your\nreflexive answer is that all people suck\nthat's just not true right like it's not\ntrue not all people are bad I mean maybe\nyou really believe that maybe right\nthere are probably people who are\njustified in believing that like\nserially abused and like all kinds of\nstuff like there may be people who\nbelieve that maybe that's a valid\nperspective but I generally think that\npeople who say those kinds of things\nit's the reflexive response so as you\nwrite a page you will discover the\nnuances in your thinking what you'll\nprobably end up with is some amount of\ninternal conflict some people suck or\nall people suck some of the time and\nthis is a magical statement because\nalready you've made progress and we'll\nwe'll show you how in a second okay so\nnow you're you're going in with some\namount of understanding now the key\nthing here is that we're going to take\nthese these understandings and we're\ngoing to apply them to actual actions\nthird thing now we're going to do is\nsocialize with intention so what does\nthis mean this means that when we social\nwhen we socialize we're not just going\nto go somewhere and hang out there's a\nlot of evidence that shows that humans\nwho are intentional do better right so\nlike for example like if you're trying\nto get better at a video game you can\nmindlessly grind at the video game for\n10 000 hours and like you're gonna stay\nthe same right you can look at like\nthey're people who've played a game for\nten thousand hours and are still like\nhard stuck at bronze or whatever there's\ndata that shows that you can predict\nwhich Physicians are going to be have\nbetter outcomes which Physicians are\ngood and which Physicians are bad within\ntwo years of them practicing starting\npractice and you can have a physician\nwho has five years of experience who has\nbetter outcomes than a physician who has\n35 years of experience and what's the\ndifference it's because the one who has\nfive years of experience is an\nintentional learner and the one who's\ngot 35 years of experience is on\nautopilot same thing with video games\nStudies have been done on medical\noutcomes it's probably your own\nexperience as well so socialize with\nintention now the question is what does\nthis mean with intention focus on\nfriends first now we get to the fun part\nso when I tell you to focus on friends\nhere's what's going to happen you're\ngoing to go to a party and your goal is\ngoing to be Dr K said focus on friends\nand internally are you going to be\nfocused on friends no you are not\nbecause of this you're gonna have some\nthoughts and feelings when you actually\ngo to a party you're going to feel\nresentment why do I have to focus on\nfriends why why did I end up this way\nwhy can't I just find a girlfriend your\ninternal response is going to hate\nfocusing on Friends be aware of that\ninternal response right because here's\nwhat's going to happen unless you do\nthat you're going to focus on friends\nyou're gonna be a robot and do what\npeople tell you to do and it ain't gonna\nwork because your heart is not in it\nyou're going to be mechanically going\nthrough the motions of forcing yourself\nto make friends while internally you're\nnot truly focused on it because\ninternally you're like okay this is a\nstep to get me laid and now I'm gonna\nmake a friend and I'm not laid why did I\nwaste my time I'm gonna make two and I\ndidn't get laid why did I waste my time\nI'm gonna make three and I didn't get\nlaid why did I waste my time you're not\ntruly focusing on friends why am I\nsaying focusing on friends it's because\nyou gotta level up you gotta level up so\nI'm gonna learn how to talk to people\nwithout being awkward and you may say\nhow on Earth do I learn to talk to\npeople without being awkward very simple\nyou practice until you no longer feel\nit's gonna feel awkward and then you're\ngonna do it and there's this little\ncircuit in your brain that develops\ntolerance right it's the same circuit\nthat when you jump into a pool of water\nit feels cold at the beginning and then\nyou develop tolerance to it the first\ntime you tried something it was hard if\nyou just keep doing it you will no\nlonger feel awkward we're going to learn\nhow to just practice socializing and\nhaving conversations with people okay\nother things that you can do smile\npractice smiling right so smile at\npeople you know you don't want to be\ncreepy about it you don't want to like\nmake eye contact for an extended period\nof time right deal remember this we\ndon't want to do that right so but you\nwant to smile like so the next time\nyou're at the grocery store smile at the\nperson who checks out hey thank you very\nmuch smile at your weight or a waitress\nnow next thing we're going to do once we\npractice a little bit at some point both\nyour greatest hope and your worst fear\nwill happen greatest hope and worst fear\nyou ready for it you're going to be\nattracted to someone it's gonna happen\nit's gonna happen and then what are you\ngonna do run away no we are going to\nmake our intentions known instead of\nwaffling around in the friend zone we're\ngonna let them know we're attracted to\nthem this is so hard why is it so hard\nbecause of this crap because I feel\ninsecure because of this crap and\nbecause of this crap this is why we did\nthose practices as you make your\nintentions known thoughts are going to\ncome up I'm unlovable I'm pathetic\npeople suck people hate virgins they've\nalways hated virgins they used to\nsacrifice them to the god all of these\nthoughts are going to get in the way of\nyou doing this and this is how people\nget stuck in the friend zone in remain\nvirgins because they're so afraid of the\nrejection that they can't make their\nfeelings known what is fear and but then\nyou can say Okay overcome your fear of\nrejection what on Earth does it look\nlike it doesn't look like rejection what\nit looks like is these thoughts this is\nhow a fear of rejection actually\nmanifests and you're not gonna know how\nto catch it or overcome it it's like\ninvisible right so you've got to use\nsome kind of detection we need like\nsonar that's where these exercises come\nin because you're going to know what\nkind of thoughts to look out for and\nwhen they pop up in your head you're\ngoing to be like oh there's my\ninsecurity it's not truth it's just\nthere's a part of me that feels this way\nabout myself and when I said this right\nhere is money unless you do this\nexercise this is what your mind is going\nto tell you but if your mind tells you\nthis instead there's room to move there\nthere's hope in this second statement\nthere's no hope in the first statement\nthere's plenty of hope in the second\nstate do you all get the difference\nthere that's why it's important to do\nthis internal work and once you do that\ninternal work when you want to make your\nintentions known all of these thoughts\nand feelings are going to come up but\nthis time you're ready for them you're\ngonna be like yeah all that stuff could\nbe true maybe I'll get rejected but you\nknow what I gotta make up for not dating\nin college so we're going to get some XP\neither way so acknowledge those thoughts\nmaybe do a quick breathing practice\nright so you can do like find the space\nbetween inhalation and exhalation do\nsomething for 60 90 120 seconds put\nyourself in a calm frame of mind right\nmaybe meditate it out a little bit and\nthen ask them out last tip ask yourself\nhow can I be more patient with myself so\nI can say be more patient but like how\ndo you do that so instead how can I be\nmore patient what can you do to be more\npatient with yourself gotta answer that\nquestion what I can do to be more\npatient with myself is ask this person\nout and acknowledge I mean this is just\na sample answer you have to come come up\nwith your own okay no cheating I gotta\nask what can I do to be more patient\nwith myself well like I can ask this\nperson out and if it doesn't work out\nand I don't get laid and I don't live\nhappily ever after I can be okay with\nmyself I can be more patient with myself\nI can acknowledge that I missed these\nopportunities right I went down this\npath instead of going down this path and\nit's going to take me some time to get\nback so I can ask this person out and I\ncan get rejected and I'm gonna be\npatient with myself that I'll do better\nnext time so people say be more patient\nbut like how so that's something you've\ngot to ask yourself can you give\nyourself a pass if things don't work out\nthe basic issue well being a virgin is\nthat in life we have Milestones right\nlike we start dating at a particular age\nwe get laid by a particular age a\ncertain Milestone and what happens is as\nwe miss those milestones we start to\nlack faith in ourselves we start to\nbecome insecure about ourselves as we\nbecome insecure about ourselves it\nbecomes easier to miss further\nMilestones this is The Virginity trap\nsince I'm insecure and I haven't gotten\nlaid in high school when I go to college\nor uni now I can't get laid there\nbecause I'm a virgin I don't know how it\nworks and so then I don't get laid in\ncollege and now I don't know how to date\nand now I feel more insecure so the more\nyou miss Milestones the more insecure\nyou feel the more insecure you feel the\nthe easier it is to miss Milestones the\nharder it is to catch up this is your\nsituation now there are solutions is\nright there's got to be some way to fix\nthis and so then people will offer you\ntwo solutions they'll say fix your shame\nwork on yourself become confident in\nyourself just fix all of those things\nwork on the shame and insecurities you\nneed to go to therapy that's great it\nhonestly it is I'm not saying that\nsarcastically but you can go to therapy\nfor a year and it's not like people are\ngonna be lining up outside your door to\nhave sex with you at the end of that at\nleast maybe I'm not good enough of a\ntherapist to be able to get my patients\nto do that I don't know I don't think\nthat's a reasonable outcome right so\nlike we'll deal with the shame or there\nare the people hey I will teach you five\ntechniques to guarantee we're going to\nuse neuro-linguistic programming and I'm\ngoing to teach you biopsycho hacks to\nget you laid when you're on to talking\nto a girl and she goes like this you go\nlike this you mirror her and then she\nwill get laid that's how it works I'm\ngoing to teach you the secrets only\n59.99 sign up now with discount and I'll\nteach you the secrets of getting laid\nand so people will teach you techniques\nright they're they're all like some\ntechniques like smile like How to Win\nFriends and Influence People by Dale\nCarnegie but the problem is when you try\nto go do that when people give you\nadvice about the practicalities of it if\nyou're carrying around that ball of\nShame then like you can't do those\nthings because the shame is going to\nlike bleed into everything else people\nsay oh you need to socialize more when I\nsocialize more and I have all these\nthoughts about how I'm a loser like\nthat's not gonna work well right because\nthe advice works for those people\nbecause they're playing with a different\nset of cards like that's the basic issue\nis that if people are socially if they\nhit all all those Milestones the hand of\ncards they're playing with with the\nstats on their character sheet are\ndifferent from your stats and the advice\ndoesn't apply to you because your stats\nare different your level is different so\nwhat you've got to do is deal with both\nof these problems at the same time it's\na synergistic approach and an\nacknowledgment that there's an internal\nemotional component that when you try to\nmove out into the world is going to\ninfluence your thoughts and behaviors\nyou have to understand what that\ninternal emotional component is and\ncatch it in the act and I know people\nare going to be like listening to this\nand wondering okay how do I fix it I\nknow this sounds absolutely insane you\ndon't have to fix it all you need to do\nis be aware of it awareness precedes\ncontrol like literally when I'm working\nwith patients who struggle with this\nkind of thing or even working in a\nprofessional standpoint or doing\nconsulting all you have to do is teach\nhuman beings what the playing field\nlooks like and how to navigate and then\nyour mind and body will take over on its\nown as you catch the thought all people\nsuck no that's not true some people all\npeople suck some of the time people are\nallowed to have bad days as as you catch\nthat thought and you shift in your mind\nfor a fraction of a second your attitude\nwill change\nat the party people will be more\nopen to you and that's the tricky thing\nis success in a relationship or getting\nlaid is not like a A to Z list of steps\nright it's about shifting your attitude\nit's about confidence and like the thing\nis all of those abstract things we can't\noperationalize into like 15 Steps 15\nsteps to become confident and so how\ndoes that attitude shift happen it\nhappens internally and it starts with\nthe awareness of thoughts so if you're a\nvirgin and however old you are I'm sure\nthere are people who are watching this\nwho are 40 year old virgins and people\nare watching this who are 14 year old\nvirgins and you all feel the same it's\nnot about the age but there is a\ncomponent of missed Milestones which we\nhave to acknowledge and so intentionally\nyou have to go out into those social\nsituations but combine the internal work\nwith social intention and then slowly\nstart to level up is this gonna work for\nyou I honestly don't know worked for me\nbut I can't say your mileage may vary\nbut what I can say with a lot of\nconfidence is that this is the most\nconsistent thing that I have found that\nworks with the most people the rest of\nit is up to you questions\nSeiko 5 is saying but you're married\nso I don't know are you saying that that\ndid work for me or didn't work for me\nAlexandra Fern what if you're incredibly\npeople picky with people you're\nattracted to I don't think that that I\nthink that's fine like I I think that's\nif you're picky you're picky right so\nall that means is that if you want to\ntry to form a relationship then you just\nneed to increase the scale of who you\nmeet so if you're attracted to three out\nof ten people versus one out of 10\npeople all that means is that you're\ngonna have to you know to have an\nopportunity with 10 people you've got to\nhave 33 exposures or you've got to have\na hundred right that's that's the only\ndifference it makes there is another\nthing to consider which is to understand\nwhy you're attracted to the people that\nyou're attracted to and whether there's\nsome work to be done there so whether\nthere is some kind of like you know if\nyou're attracted to traits that are not\ngood for you in some particular way or\nthere's some flexibility there like\nlearning to appreciate different kinds\nof people like there could be some work\nthere but but if I'm catching thoughts\nWithin Myself how can I listen to\nanother party it's a good question to\nMata for faka it's hard right but if if\nyou really pay attention to the way that\nyou converse with people we're not\nusually always paying attention to the\nother person we can spend a little bit\nof time with ourselves like usually like\nyour mind wanders when you're in a\nconversation a little bit the other\nthing is that you don't have to do this\nwhile you're in conversation so what I\nwould do is like when I'm walking over\nso I remember going through this process\nin college where like I made an intent I\ndecided I was going to try to be more\nsocial and like I would leave the room\nright so I would say like okay I didn't\nwant to go to the party didn't want to\ngo to the party didn't want to go to the\nparty and what I realized is that I\ncould mentally reset by taking a shower\nso I'd take a shower and then I'd get\ndressed for the party and then like if I\ncould do that then I could get out the\ndoor as I'm walking over to the party\nall kinds of anxieties are going through\nmy head what about this what about this\nwhat about this what about this what\nabout this and then like just process\nthose like acknowledge what you're\nfeeling in those moments at the party\nlike you know okay this is going to be\nscary things like that and then there\nmay even be certain things that you can\nreassure yourself with right which is\nthat I'm gonna go to the party but I\nhave to stay for four hours I'm gonna\ntry to have a good time for half an hour\nor one hour if I'm not feeling it I can\nalways come home and play Diablo so but\nI'm gonna stay for at least half an hour\nor one hour right so I'd promise myself\nhalf an hour but I'd really shoot for\none hour okay we're gonna do a minimum\nof half an hour but if we can hit one\nhour like that's an accomplishment and\nthen I'd go and then I'd be like\nintentional about talking to people and\nwhat do you know time would fly by oh\ntwo hours has gone by John export is\nasking what do you do when you lost your\nvirginity and still have those problems\nI love that you asked that question so\nhere's the thing that a lot of the\nvirgins don't know is that I know it's\ngonna sound crazy getting laid ain't\ngonna fix all the problems it's not like\nbusting a nut makes all the internal\nshame go away it's like boom Magic\nEraser for all the shame and insecurity\nin your life shockingly as a\npsychiatrist in my professional opinion\nsometimes getting laid makes the problem\nworse because here you were thinking\nthat it would fix everything and it\ndoesn't fix everything and then you get\ninto this weird cycle okay now I've\ngotten laid but I still feel empty\ninside and then you can like but there's\nsome kind of oxyto ocean there's some\nkind of connection there's some kind of\nintimacy and then you start can you even\nthis has happened I've seen this happen\nwhere sometimes you will become I'm\ntrying to think I'm thinking of you will\nbecome and this is not a gender specific\nterm you'll become a you can become\na manslaught woman slot and then you'll\nstart having sexual engagements to try\nto assuage your internal insecurities\nand it won't work because it doesn't\nwork like that and you'll start to like\nlean into sex as a substitute for\nemotional needs and emotional work and\nthen that's a whole other can of worms\nthen if you're out there and you're\nlistening to this as a version it's like\nyeah give me that can of worms way\nbetter than the can of worms I got I'm\nnot trying to shame them like by all\nmeans apologies if I if I did that I'm\nnot saying that it's bad to sleep with a\nlot of people I'm not making a value\njudgment on that what I'm saying is that\nusing sex and a prolific amount of sex\nwhen having sex once doesn't fix your\nemotional Securities sometimes what\nhappens is people will try more right\nlook let's do it again let's do it again\nlet's do it again let's do it again and\nthe more that you try to do it to try to\nfix those internal emotional needs so\nI've seen this in patients who have sex\naddictions I'm not shaming them for\nhaving sex like that's not my intention\nif I did I apologize what I'm saying is\nthat it doesn't fix the problem which is\nwhat's really shocking to the people who\nhaven't had sex I'm just saying like it\nain't gonna fix it like I I just don't\nknow how to say this if you have years\nof emotional insecurity and shame and\nfeeling like you're unlovable an orgasm\nis not going to fix that I I honestly in\nterms of the word uh hopefully it's okay\nto use that word I I honestly I don't\nknow if you'll notice I paused for a\nsecond and tried to think of a word that\ndescribes someone who has a lot of sex\nthat wasn't that word I couldn't think\nof one promiscuous but that's an\nadjective I guess I could have said I\nshould have said people will become\npromiscuous no no but I mean I\nunderstand that y'all are trolling but\nlike I do need you guys do realize that\nsometimes I'll go to like places and\ngive lectures at universities and it's\nsuch a Charged word I need a better word\nlike really I need a better word can you\nall help me with that is there a word\nbut see to say that their addicts is not\nappropriate at that point that's the\nproblem is it's not clear whether they\nhave an addiction I don't know okay so\nit seems like y'all can't Casanova okay\ny'all can't come up with something\neither so that's maybe we'll check a\nyeah that's what I was so Giga v9 is\nsaying serial sex have her I'll use that\nI guess because that certainly rolls off\nthe tongue yeah maybe I can say they'll\nbe they can become hypersexual that's\nprobably better thank you chat Jaron\nGrinders they become Grinders help\nquestions is it okay that we talked\nabout this it ain't your fault that your\nversion it's okay to be a virgin ain't\nno problem with it we're all born\nvirgins\nand because you'll get advice from some\npeople that don't understand the\ninternal struggles and you'll get people\nwho will try to fix the internal\nstruggles but in fixing the internal\nstruggles doesn't actually substitute\nfor the lack of social Milestones so you\ngot to do both"
