    "transcript": "So when you say I don't want to burden\nother people the way that you resolve\nthat is not through courage you don't\novercome your fears of burdening other\npeople there's a relational component so\nwhat you do is talk to them ask for\npermission ask for feedback hey is it\nokay ask for permission if I talk to you\nabout something that's like I'm\nstruggling with right now so the whole\npoint of opening up to another human\nbeing is there's a relational component\nto it it now involves more than one\nperson and what we try to do is solve\nall the anxieties in our head without\never interacting with the other person"
