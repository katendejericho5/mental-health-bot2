of money what would\nI learn if I saw a clip of 100 people\nwinning a bunch of money what would I\nlearn why do people warning me about the\nrisks make me want to do it more what a\ngreat question how can someone with ADHD\nhave a healthy relationship with a game\nlike poker oh my God such good questions\nso when someone warns you again away\nfrom something sometimes you want to do\nit more ain't that the truth the\nquestion is why is that so a couple\nthings to consider the first is that if\nyou're so that we know that like\noppositional Natures are somewhat of a\npersonality characteristic so I think\nsome kids learn best by being told and\nsome kids learn best by sort of figuring\nit out themselves I've spent a lot of\ntime with kids from both camps so some\nof that is just personality where we\nhave a society where the more we\nstandardize protocolize you know\nInstitute warning things were not really\naccommodating a particular type A\npersonality type variant within our\npopulation which is that some kids like\nneed to be like they're they they're\nsort of Discovery Learners as opposed to\ndissemination some kids like are fine\nwith disseminating information they just\nkind of absorb it like a sponge and\nthey're good but if you're a discovery\nlearner then what you need to do is like\nexplore the concept yourself and we just\ndon't facilitate self-understandings\nthat's the first issue number two is\nthat sometimes the reason that we're\nrebellious when we're told not to do\nsomething is because we discovered early\non that the things that are forbidden\nfor us are actually really fantastic\nlike sometimes that's what it is so\nimagine that I grew up in a household\nwhere you know I wasn't so I wasn't like\nallowed to drink let's say Coke right\nall the other kids get to have Coke and\nall the other kids get to play video\ngames I don't get to play video games I\ndon't get to have Coke so I don't get to\nhave Sprite on get to have any soda\nPepsi nothing and so like when I go to\nmy friend's house and I have a soda and\nI get to play video games I'm like wow\nthis is really amazing I love this stuff\nso some of us then learn what's the\nlesson that that child learns the child\nlearns that oh the stuff that is\nrestricted to me is like actually\nfantastic and so once you learn that if\nyou've been raised in a very restrictive\nhousehold then you're going to have some\nprogramming or conditioning to run into\nthe direction of what you've been warned\naway against right so I think those are\ntwo really really really key things to\nthink about if you want to understand\nwhy do I gravitate towards things that\nare forbidden you have to explore your\nown experience with things that are\nforbidden and try to figure out like\nwhere did this attraction to the\nForbidden thing come from and recognize\nthat a certain amount of it may be\npersonality second question was how can\nsomeone with ADHD have a healthy\nrelationship with a game like poker the\nanswer is honestly it's hard so what we\nknow from research on ADHD is that\npeople with ADHD are first of all more\nvulnerable to addictions in general\ncompared to the population there's a\nwhole video about that in Dr K's guide\nto ADHD and doing stuff basically if you\nlook at how the brains of people with\nADHD are different what you find is\nthere's some Neuroscience change some\nchange changes in capacity like higher\namount of impulsivity less amount of\ndelayed gratification difficulty\nexecuting and planning tasks a tendency\nto procrastinate these are\nvulnerabilities of the ADHD brain and\nwhat you find is Along Comes an\naddiction and they're like hey I see\nthat you're highly impulsive and have\ntrouble delaying gratification you're\nnow my new best friend let's go let's go\nparty let's have a great great time and\nso it's almost like ADHD is like gives\nyou a debuff that makes you vulnerable\nto addiction so if you've got ADHD and\nyou're playing video games or gambling\nor stuff like that just recognize that\nit's going to be an uphill battle for\nyou compared to a neurotypical person\nand I think there's like strong enough\nevidence for me to be able to make that\ngeneralization not saying that people\nwith ADHD can't conquer addictions or\nnot everyone is prone to addiction but\nif we look at populations of people if\nwe take a thousand people with ADHD and\na thousand people who are neurotypical\nwhat we'll find is that the amount of\naddiction in the ADHD population will be\nhigher than the neurotypical pumps just\nhow it is the other thing is that a lot\nof times people think about addiction\ntreatment and what we call dual\ndiagnosis which means that we\nacknowledge that for example if you have\ndepression and you have an alcohol\naddiction the two are going to be\nsynergistic and you can't just treat one\nso why do I drink I drink to cope so I\ncan become sober but if my depression is\nuntreated and I become depressed I'm\ngoing to need the alcohol to cope with\nthe depression the flip side is even if\nI start let's say medication or\ntreatment for a depression I can deal\nwith that depression but if I keep\ndrinking the alcohol will have a neuro\nneurological effect on my mood and\npredispose me to depression you can even\nget something called a substance induced\nmood disorder so like alcohol can in and\nof itself cause a depressive episode\ngenerally speaking when we think about\ndual diagnosis we think about mood\ndisorders and addictions we don't think\nabout ADHD and addiction so oftentimes\nthat's something that's very very\nimportant you have to treat the ADHD and\nthe addiction simultaneously is it\npossible to make someone more\nsusceptible to gambling if so how do\ngambling sites take advantage of this\nit's absolutely possible to make someone\nmore susceptible to gambling so if we go\nback to the psychology of how people get\ninto gambling remember we discussed a\nlot of different things impulsivity\nimpaired risk calculations illusion of\ncontrol right so I don't calculate the\ncosts I believe I can affect change\nthere's also aspects of peer pressure\nand advertising and if trendy our brains\nare vulnerable to what's trending so how\ndo gambling sites take advantage of this\nreally simple right wow you win one\nmillion dollars look at all these people\nwinning 69\n000 winning and 18 Cent loss top ten\nstreamers biggest wins of 2020 Casino\nground how do they take advantage of it\nthis is how they take advantage of it\nthey create a culture they create a\nsystem where big streamers get to win\nbig streamers get to win the rest will\nhandle itself things will get clipped\nthings will get shipped things will get\nshared things will get edited and it'll\nincrease the illusion of your control\nit'll impair your ability to accurately\npredict what will happen if you spend a\nhundred dollars on these sites they'll\ndo all these things automatically is it\neven advertising no it's not an\nadvertisement they're not paying for an\nadvertisement they're completely in\ncompliance with all the laws how can we\nfault them they're not doing anything\nwrong this is the law I'm like a\nbusiness that's operating well within\nthe limit of the law I'm not doing\nanything illegal that's the standard\nright is that as a corporation I\nshouldn't do anything illegal great I'm\nadhering to that standard do loot boxes\nand gotcha systems count as gambling in\nan addiction standpoint why why are some\npeople can't control themselves while\nothers can stop whenever they want so\nlet's talk about loot boxes so loot\nboxes are this beautiful beautiful gray\narea there's a part of me that doesn't\nreally fault game developers for\nloot boxes because loot boxes are a\nnatural evolution of mechanics that a\nhundred percent used to be okay so back\nin the day I was addicted to Diablo 2.\nand the cool thing about Diablo 2 is\nwhen you do a Boss run the boss drops a\nrandom Loot and that made the game more\nfun right because like random loot like\nrandom loot is fine there's no problem\nwith random loot right we're randomizing\nloot we have whole games that are built\non randomization like procedurally\ngenerated like what we're going to ban\nprocedurally generated generated games\nbecause they're random just random Loot\nand now what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to take the random Loot and we're\ngoing to put it inside a virtualbox just\na random reinforcement schedule there's\nnothing illegal with that in fact it's\nquite legal right you can buy a lottery\nticket so then things got a little bit\ntricky because in-game items started to\nhave real world value so I opened a\ntreasure from the Dota 2 game and I got\nan item and I looked at it I was\ninformed by the the game that this\ntreasure sells for 600 so I was like\nlet's sell it I don't care about\nCosmetics so items sold for 600 bucks\nand then I had like infinite steam money\nfor a while so then the question is is\nokay hold on a second is this a cosmetic\nitem if it has real world value are you\nreally gambling so some countries\nactually think so so I believe it's\nBelgium I may have gotten that wrong but\nsome countries have actually started\nregulating they've classified loot boxes\nunder regular gambles they've said this\ncounts because the second we've crossed\nover or not the second but now that\nwe've substantially crossed over from\nvirtual items to real world money you're\ngambling for a virtual item that has no\ninherent value but does have an external\nvalue you're now so is that correct I'm\nnot sure so I'm not an expert in policy\nbut like what I do know is it's a one\nhell of a gray area I think we're\ngetting closer and closer to those\nneeding to be regulated but where is the\ndividing line on that like you're\nwelcome to have an opinion I'm sure\nanyone out there has an opinion I don't\nknow that your opinion is right because\nlike then okay so like let's just do the\nmath so if I can sell an item on eBay in\na video game and someone is willing to\nbuy it and it's not found in a loot box\nbut it drops from a boss does that make\nand the boss has a random loot table\ndoes that mean that bosses and video\ngames that have bosses with random blue\ntables should be regulated as gambling I\ndon't know I mean that sounds a bit\nextreme to me but if you all say yes\nokay if you all say no like feel free to\nshare your thoughts now there's a second\npart to the question why are some people\nwhy can't some people control themselves\nwhen other people why can some people\ncontrol themselves and other people\ncan't that unfortunately is a very\ncomplex question so here's how I would\nanswer it very simply the ability to\ncontrol your behavior which we'll talk\nabout later today the ability to control\nyour behavior has to do with trait and\nStates there's some reasons a part of\nthe reason why some people can control\nthemselves is because of essentially\nlike some things that are pretty hard to\nwired right so if you were grow if you\ngrew up and your frontal lobes developed\nin a nice healthy way right if they grew\nup in the absence of mood altering\nsubstances so for example like if you\ndidn't smoke pot before the age of 30\nthat has been shown to impair I mean\nsmoking pot has been shown to a pair\nfrontal lobe development so depending on\nhow your brain develops if you were\ntaught by your parents to a certain\ndegree like delayed gratification and\ntaught how to study and taught how to do\nall kinds of stuff then it can be easier\nto control your impulses if you are not\ntaught those things or you were born\nwith a brain that's ADHD or whatever\nthen it's going to be harder for you\nbecause of your brain but that's not the\nwhole thing so people will think oh my\nGod that means I'm screwed no because\nthere's a software component as well and\nwhat we've learned from Psychiatry is\nthat the software component probably in\na lot of ways is more important than the\nhardware component that you can take\nsomeone who has ADHD and you can do\ntherapy with them and if you do therapy\nwith them or you work with someone who's\nlike an ADHD coach which is something\nthat I hear a lot about nowadays right\nso we also equip our coaches with some\nstuff to help people get organized that\nyou can learn particular things to\ncompensate for whatever your brain is\nnaturally tending towards and so there's\na lot of addiction is also State based\nright so it's not just what you can\nlearn but it's how you feel in the\nmoment if I'm alone in life sitting at\nhome all day and have nothing to look\nforward to it's way easier to get\naddicted to a substance or gambling or\ngaming or whatever right there's an\ninternal emotional state which we also\nknow very strongly neuroscientifically\nand there's an excellent researcher\nnamed I don't know how to pronounce this\nv-o-l-k-o-w volcao\nvolco I don't know best researcher on\nthis stuff excellent Neuroscience paper\nabout how a lack of awareness of your\ninternal State predisposes YouTube\naddiction and so if you look at the\nmechanisms through which meditation\nhelps people with addiction is we learn\nhow to become aware of our internal\nemotional state and we learn how to\nemotionally regulate ourselves and once\nyou have those two things once you can\nregulate your state you no longer are\ngoing to be as vulnerable to The\nAddictive substance in a nutshell it's\ntrait and state part of the way that you\nwere born you were wired some people are\nluckier other people are unluckier when\nit comes to addiction specifically and\nthen some people are more vulnerable\nbecause of their circumstances or even\nhow they're feeling moment to moment I\nthink her name is Nora volkau so if we\nlook at if you all want to see I'm sure\nthis is I don't know if this is the\nright paper but this is the right person\nYep this is fantastic I think it's let's\nsee PDF okay Lance Psychiatry is not in\nthe public domain but like fantastic\nokay last question is watching people\ngamble dangerous can seeing others\ngamble make it more likely to become\naddictive I'm gonna go ahead and say on\nbalance yes there is a risk to watch\npeople gamble and that too there's some\nNuance here because it's not just\nwatching people gamble it's the way in\nwhich you watch them Gamble and what\naspect of the gambling are you watching\nso for example watching a clip\ncompilation of people gambling I think\nwill probably be more harmful than\nwatching eight hours of like someone\njust clicking buttons Maybe I'm Wrong so\nthat data could show the opposite but I\nthink if we look at some of these things\nlike illusion of control and expectation\nof reward when I watch 10 clips of\npeople hitting it big what do you think\nmy brain learns about the likelihood\nthat I will win it big if I see saw a\nclip of a hundred people losing a ton of\nmoney what would I learn if I saw a clip\nof 100 people winning a bunch of money\nwhat would I learn and so I do think\nthat there is a danger to watching\npeople gamble but that I think is also\nvariable right so it's not like binary\nand so why watching a stream I mean who\nknows maybe watching a stream for eight\nhours is actually more damaging because\nyou're getting inundated with it\ninundated with it inundated with it\nmaybe you're watching it on the second\nscreen and the only time you pay\nattention is when there's a big one\nmaybe you get bombarded with the sensory\nstimuli and all the banners and the\nlogos and the colors maybe that that has\nthe worst effect I don't know but in\ngeneral I'd say yes that watching people\ngamble will make you more prone to\ngambling and that's not specific to\ngambling by the way right so if I like\nwatch people eat chicken nuggets I'm\ngoing to want to eat chicken nuggets if\nI watch people playing a video game I'm\ngoing to want to play the video games\nhow human beings work\nforeign"
