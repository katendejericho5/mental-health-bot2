    "transcript": "I know that you are in the field of\ncomputer but if you're oh there we go if\nyou're struggling I can use my racial\nbonus to tech support oh is that is that\nwhat you get you get a racial bonus to\nthat so I'm I'm you know I'm the kind of\nperson who like I've just gone through\nlife and I've never like gotten\nproficiency skill in computers I've just\nbeen writing that racial bonus it all\nMak sense I I don't I don't know what my\nracial bonus is I'm just like generic\nwhite guy so like what do I get I mean\nyour your name is Thor that is true you\nhave racial bonus to axes you have raal\nracial bonus to hair that's true I do\nhave that I have that bonus racial bonus\nto axes and hair possibly drinking maybe\nI you I do have a high tolerance I just\ndon't use it yeah so\nthat's funny as how you been man so\nyou're doing good yeah doing really good\nin fact I've I've been able to execute\non pretty much all the things that I\nwanted to over the last like when was\nthe last time we talked how many months\nhas it been it's been a while but I I\nabsolutely loved our conversation I have\nno idea what I don't remember what we\ntalked about but I remember just\nthoroughly enjoying it yeah it was super\nawesome actually a lot of the community\nPops in all the time and they're like I\njust saw your Dr K video it's super\nawesome so like no it was super fun to\ntalk about man I really enjoyed it as\nwell gave me a lot of stuff to think\nabout and kind of doubled down on all\nthe things that I was doing oh really\ninteresting can you tell me about that\nyeah yeah so like the stuff that I was\ndoing with ferret rescue right so I've\nkind of expanded the idea out for that\nnow where we're going to be building the\nlargest F rescue in in the United States\nis the idea um I've gotten a piece of\nland so I moved or I'm in the process of\nmoving we're waiting on the county has\nfinally approved the project to be able\nto build fiber there which is huge W so\nwe're going to be able to build a\nbuilding that is going to be the largest\nfa rescue in the United States I'm going\nall in on that having a lot of fun with\nit and hiring in people that are going\nto be full-time uh Veterinary work and\nand management for that so they can run\nit and then we can have that as a side\nthing and uh yeah that's that's kind of\nlike the big thing that I'm doing with\nthat the game Jam that I was running\nactually exploded so we did, 1400 games\nfor that we ended up giving out $330,000\nto the winners of that so we've helped\nfund those new new aspiring Studios for\nthat so that was a huge winning for that\nand then um I'm looking into either\nbuilding a publishing house or working\nwith a Publishing House to try and\ndirect that to help with new Indies\nwanting to get published in that\ndirection so that's made me pretty happy\nwith that that's a that's a really\nlong-term goal of mine that I had had\nand it's much more attainable now also I\nhired on all of my moderators so\neverybody is now well six of them are\nsalary right now we're starting with\nhalf the team and then we're going to do\nthe other half the team once we make\nsure that all this is financially stable\nenough to do it and uh they all get\nbenefits so medical benefits dental\nvision uh all the healthcare stuff that\nI can throw at it basically and and\nretirement as well for all of that and\nI've set it up in a corporation so the\ncorporation's finally done did an ESC\nCorp so there's no way that I could ever\nIPO it it has to be you know I can never\ngo back on that promise we structured in\nthat way to get rid of any perceptions\nthat could happen and then made sure\nthat all of that was done in a way where\nbasically the employees are going to be\ntaken care of as much as possible cuz I\ncan't can't do this without them they\ncan't do it without me that's awesome\ndude so basically just executed on\neverything I wanted to yeah so so um can\nyou tell me a little bit about what is\ngame Jam so a game Jam is a whole lot of\npeople want to make video games right\nand they may not have sort of the the\ndrive to do it they're like I don't know\nif I want to do this I don't know how to\nstart I don't know where to do this so\nyou give them a two-e period and you say\nyou have a theme this is the theme for\nthe game gam it'll be something\nridiculous our last one was um it's\nspreading right so like you're going to\nmake a game around spreading mechanics\nin some way whatever it's going to be\nand they build that game as a prototype\nand then they submit it and then we vote\non it and then we give them feedback and\nwe try to basically build this\nenvironment where they feel safe failing\nyou you should fail doing this it's\nlikely that you will not succeed so you\nget a a really good safe environment to\nfail at you learn a bunch of stuff and\nthen you move forward as a Game Dev and\nif you win it is likely that you will be\nable to take that to be a game that you\ncan go and sell on steam or show other\npeople or whatever we want to do with it\nat that point you get buch accolades and\nthings like that so people build a game\nin two weeks yes oh yeah and it will\nusually be a prototype that's kind of\njunky right but like they get the core\nof an idea of something that's really\ngood really compelling and then they can\nexpand that out into the future we've\nalready gotten dozens of games that have\ncontacted us and said like hey I'm\nplanning on building a studio out of\nthis now thank you for doing the game\nJam I'm so inspired to do this or people\nthat say you know I didn't I didn't\nfinish or like but but I I never felt\nlike I was comfortable enough to make a\ngame I didn't think I could so they went\ndid it the first one I ever did like\nthis I actually tricked her community\ninto learning which was quite funny so\nmany people were like I don't want to do\nthat I can't make a game I can't program\nand I was like okay then we won't do a\ngame Jam about making a video game we'll\ndo a game Jam about what you would do if\nyou did make a video game so they\ncreated what's called a game design\ndocument which is you make a piece of\npaper that says everything you would do\non the if you made a game all the tools\nyou would work with all the things that\nyou would learn everything you needed to\nknow how you would plan it out and then\nthat was the first week of the game Jam\nI was like it's just a week long Jam\nafter the week was over I said okay\nsecond week bonus round go make the\nPrototype and they went well I already\nknow how I'm not afraid anymore I did\nall the research that it's easy and they\nwent and did it we had um I think it was\n98% of the teams actually went forward\nand made a prototype on our first game\nJam as a result that's awesome dude yeah\nit's also interesting because that\nreminds me of something that we do in\nPsychotherapy which is um so if someone\ndoesn't want to talk about something we\nuse this technique called going meta so\nsomeone says like oh I don't want to\ntalk about my relationships and you know\ntotally fine to respect boundaries we\ndon't NE the goal isn't to push um but\nwhat we'll do is we'll ask people can\nyou help me understand why you don't\nwant to talk about it totally fine we\ndon't have to talk about it but what's\nyour reason so what we do is like here\nis the thing that is psychologically\nactivating and what we want to do is\nmove one layer like meta or one layer\nlike remove from it and talk about the\nobstacle to the thing that is that is\nscary and it almost sounds like y all\nstumbled into that or thought of that\nright which is like okay we're not going\nto actually make a game we're going to\nwe're going to do something else that\nfeels emotionally safer and moves us\ncloser to the topic and then we often\ntimes find that that's very effective at\ngetting people to like open up yeah the\nbasic idea I had about it was like\nbecause I have a background in Social\nEngineering right it's part of my job\npart of my work and I was like the the\none thing that's stopping people is\nthey're afraid and they're mostly afraid\nnot because of anything other than they\njust don't know what it takes and\nbecause they don't know what it takes\nthey're worried about failing so I was\nlike well what if we structure that\naround\nexposing them to What It Takes and do it\nin a way where it doesn't matter if they\nfail or not and it worked and it up\nworking really really well so it was\nkind of stumbling into that frankly yeah\nthat's cool General understanding what\nis social engineering so social\nengineering is when you were trying to\neither manipulate a situation to get a\ncertain outcome with another person\nright or um I use it more often to try\nand figure out what somebody needs in\norder to move forward or move past the\nthing that's blocking them a lot of the\ntimes I used it when I was in you know\noffensive security to try get into areas\nof access that I wasn't supposed to be\nin I roleplay as a character or I do\nanything like that to try and move\nforward to do that you know to try and\ntrick them into letting me have access\nwhere I shouldn't have access or get\ninformation out of an employee that I\nshouldn't have a good example of this is\nlet's say you're a customer service\nrepresentative and I call in and while\nI'm talking to you about my customer\nservice problem that I have I say hey\nI'm thinking about applying at your\nbusiness and uh I'm wondering you know I\ncan't really cook I'm not good at that\ncan you tell me what like the best\nplaces to eat in the area cuz I'll be\nthere pretty soon for an interview and\nthen you tell me where you eat in the\narea and now I know where to go to be\nable to clone your badge if I need to\nbreak into your office that is part of\nsocial engineering it's starting kind of\na situation like that for an ulterior\nmotive is the idea and that's kind of\nwhat that first game Jam was the\nalterior motive was to get people to\nlearn so you can do it for good reasons\nbut yeah that's so that's so interesting\nso what what so this is not coding what\nyou're what you're social engineering is\nit's people dissection right yeah\nBehavior\nfreaking no freaking is phone hacking so\nthis is behavioral analysis social\nengineering is it's a very common thing\nit usually comes down to acting and\nunderstanding body language and behavior\nbut a lot of it is done by intuition not\nthrough reading it is through learning\nthat every time I learned it hilariously\nfrom playing Dungeons and Dragons\nbecause I roleplay as a DM like I'm a DM\nand I have to role play a bunch of\ncharacters and I can see the immediate\nemotional response from my players so I\nknow how to act in certain ways\nstreaming does the same thing for you as\nwell you immediately react to how chat\nis reacting you see the things that you\nsay if they function or don't function\nhow you say things the inflection that\nyou use all of that kind of stuff yeah\nsuper important that's so fascinating\nbecause you said role playay as a DM and\nI was like oh that's interesting were\nyou were you playing characters as DM\nwho's pretending to be a DM like that\nwould be yeah pretending to be one yeah\nno\ndefinitely um I pretend to be a DM yeah\nand uh I do sometimes it's good yeah\nthat that's so fascinating so it sounds\nlike you've uh and the social\nengineering stuff is I think a really\ninteresting topic of discussion because\nthat that too is something that so it\nsounds like a lot of what you do is very\nsimilar actually in a lot of ways to\nwhat what we do or what I do which is\nalso trying to help people understand\nwhat makes them tick and how to make\ntasks easier for you to complete how to\nunderstand your mind and like how it\nworks and your brain um yeah and so\nthat's super cool yours comes from a a\nvery different background than mine\nthough mine is very intuition based so\nthere are going to be gaps for me like\n100% And I think that's really\ninteresting I think it's interesting\nthat you have kind of two paths that\nlead to the same goal there in different\nways oh give me a second this is my oh\nhey what's up hey y'all I want to take a\nsecond to talk about star Forge PCS so I\nam in love with these gameing machines\nbecause I love gaming the problem is\nthat I started building PCS when I was\n12 and I just don't have the time for it\nanymore and if you really think about it\nlike sure you can keep up with all the\ntrends and stuff but chances are\nespecially if you're a healthy gamer you\nmay have better things to do with your\ntime so if you're like a college student\nI love that they have the horizon line\nwhich is like more economical really\nsolid gaming PC and instead of like\nspending 15 hours following trends like\nyou know study your your final and like\nget a better grade and then get a better\nGPA then get a better job and then go\nlive your life so if you're like me and\nyou're like a professional and you want\nto really solid gaming PC because you're\na gamer but you also don't want to waste\nthe time to figure out what's good and\nwhat's not I highly recommend star Forge\nall of their PCS are built in Austin by\nGamers who really know what they're\ndoing and if you're like me like you\nbuild a PC once every 3 years and you\nscrew up the gel on the heat sink if you\nknow what I'm talking about you know\nwhat I'm talking about all this kind of\ncrap you don't have to worry about\nthey're going to do everything for you\nit'll be a solid PC it'll run your games\nand this is the crazy thing every single\none of their PCS I've ever used also run\nZoom at top specs so check out star\nForge I absolutely love\nthem so you know it's interesting that\nyou say that there's going to be Gap in\nyours um I mean I think that that is\nundoubtedly objectively true but I think\none of the things that I've learned\nabout sort of like this dichotomy\nbetween like science and spirituality so\nif you look at like Psychotherapy versus\nlike let's say meditation\ntraining the yogis and these like\nBuddhist monks and people like that they\nsort of had a sample size of one and\nthey were just interested in the\nsubjective they were not interested in\num objectively what is correct for all\nof humanity they were interested in what\nworks for an individual yeah so their\ntheir laboratory was a single\nperson the interesting thing about the\nWestern perspective we think it's\nSuperior because it's scientific and\nscientific is about objective Truth The\nChallenge is that the application of\nscience to an individual has a big gap\nso even though we have a study that\nshows that cognitively reframing is\nhealthy it it doesn't teach us how to\ncognitively reframe so that is actually\na subjective process so so I I think\nwhen when you say it's primarily\nintuition I mean that I think is an\ninteresting thought but I think that\njust because it is subjective or a\npersonal exploration does not mean that\nit is inferior to science I think it's\nexperiential more I guess is better than\nthe intuition way of saying that it's\nmore experiential so it's it's based on\nmy experiences and it's based in uh not\nin a clinical setting it's more in a in\na you know out in the world setting so\nyeah that makes more sense definitely\nyeah that it'd be interesting to kind of\ncompare notes yeah definitely I think\nthe biggest Gap that I get in that\nregard is terminology there's going to\nbe terminology like I said last time\nterminology is just going to be missing\nbecause of that because it's it's like I\nlearned this thing out in the street you\nknow yeah no but I I think that that the\nterminology is it's really interesting\nbecause you mentioned that is there's\nactually a an interesting study I forget\nwhat it's called it's something\nreport back in the early 1900s there was\na so medical education was not\nstandardized so like you had all these\nMed schools that were just teaching\nwhatever the hell they wanted so there\nwas some report I'm blanking on the name\nthat um analyzed like the different\nmedical schools and like tried to figure\nout like okay is there any consensus\nhere and in the process of that report\nthey also point out that medical jargon\nis specifically\nobtuse yeah to try to keep regular\npeople from understanding and preserve\nthe status of like a medical doctor\nthat's why they use Latin for everything\ninstead of just saying like oh you have\nlike you you know osteoarthritis as\nopposed to my my knee hurts yeah um so\nit's it's really interesting because the\nterminology is actually used to gatekeep\nyeah I I think it's actually funny is\nthat reminds me of Idiocracy though\nbecause if you go too far in the other\ndirection you end up getting something\nthat makes no sense where you're like oh\nmy bones suck you know like okay but\nwhat does that mean you know like yeah\nthere's a lack of precision yeah a\nlittle bit yeah we see that I think a\nlot with our emotional vocabulary where\nwe're not precise about what we feel and\nwhat we think um when I I think a lot of\ntimes people lack the kind of words to\nexpress that though not not to discredit\nor say that that's that's like their\nfault or anything it's just many people\ndon't talk about emotions they don't\ntalk about their feelings and like\nSociety doesn't like you to do that a\nlot of the times frankly and I think\nthat sucks yeah yeah I I think it's it's\nabsolutely something that is discouraged\nso one of the the best examples that I\ncan think of is that everyone says that\ncommunication is important for a\nrelationship you know they'll ask you\nlike oh like you've been married for 40\nyears what's the secret they'll say like\ncommunication communication\ncommunication what does that means yeah\nyeah what does that mean so one yeah go\nahead super common it's it's just a\nsuper common thing and it's true it's\nlike communication matters but it's like\nwhat what does that communication entail\nit means telling your partner you're\nupset it means telling him that you are\nupset that you don't like the thing\nthat's going on telling him why you\ndon't like that thing it means and to be\nhonest with you sometimes it means\nFighting Man sometimes it means having a\nverbal argument not a physical argument\nobviously but a verbal argument about\nsomething is sometimes that's what\nwhat's needed if there's an emotional\nthing on the table and it's it's deeply\ndistressing having a verbal argument\nabout it is normal there's nothing wrong\nwith that just don't make it bad you\nknow like okay take it too far I think\nthat's that's certainly an important\npart I I think one of the things that\nworries me there are a couple times that\nyou know I've talked to people about\ntheir relationship and one of the things\nthat actually worries me one of the\nthings that I consider sort of a yellow\nflag or red flag is a lack of\nconflict yeah so often I learned that in\nthe past in relationships M it's like\nwow it's perfect until it wasn't and we\ndidn't have any practice fighting we had\nno practice having arguments the entire\ntime and then we had an argument and it\nwas real bombastic and that sucked you\nknow and it actually it self-destructed\nthe relationship because it was like we\nwent from this Whiplash of just like\nperfect perfect perfect everything's\nfine to we fought you know argument real\nbad couldn't recover from it cuz there's\nno there's no like getting rid of the\nstress over time it was just like a\npowder kick it was like a pressure\ncooker right so it all goes off at once\nyou have to you have to argue sometimes\nyou have to make that known it's\ninteresting I I I did a lecture a couple\nmonths ago I think we uploaded it to\nYouTube about how red flags early in\nrelationships are good so like this\nreally yeah it's super fascinating So\nlike um like I would say 50% of\nsuccessful relationships that I've seen\nas a psychiatrist I don't do a whole lot\nof couples counseling so I have a lot of\npatients who have very healthy\nrelationships and when I ask them about\nlike the start of their\nrelationship um they're like they're\nusually red flags like in in half of the\ncases they're like solid red flags so in\none case uh 22y old what kind yeah\n22-year-old um with basically no career\nprospects uh asking out a\n16-year-old right so big big big big big\nno no oh um with with parental awareness\nso there was nothing Shady so like the\nperson like went over to the\n16-year-old's house and was like hey I\nwould like to take your daughter on a\ndate and parents were actually like okay\nwith it um and how old is a person\n22 oh man maybe\n21 even then yeah so right that's what\nI'm saying they're they're like they're\nhappily married now and like they've\nbeen married for you know like 20 some\nyears and they've got kids in a life and\nand all this good like it's it's crazy\nstarted weird started weird started\nweird and and the interesting thing is\nthat you know the the parents were\nreally like like cuz the the the the guy\nwas quite I mean they were like quite\nimpressed and they're like this guy\nseems like respectful and decent and\nalso like seems like to really care\nabout you know\nshe's I feel like that hey look I'm\ntelling y'all it's it's red flag is\nearly I'm not I'm not suggesting\nlargest red flag yeah yeah that's seen\nit so another another really good one is\nlike uh so two people met at a\nprofessional event like a conference and\nthen they like text back and forth and\nthey like make it a point to like go to\nconferences where like one person is and\nthat's like the start of their\nrelationship where like hey are you\ngoing to this conference okay like if\nyou're coming then I'm coming and it's\nlike they're not not dating they're just\ntexting back and forth and then they\nlike show up and for a period of like a\nyear they're just meeting randomly at\nconferences for like you know every two\nor 3\nmonths and and so that that's the kind\nof thing where it's like you know flying\nhalfway across the country to see\nsomeone that you're not dating and\nyou've got a professional reason to do\nit like you can go to the conference and\nmake it worthwhile but to do that\nrepeatedly like you know another red\nflag it's a little weird it's a little\nweird I I don't know if that one's as\nbig of a red flag to me it's just a\nlittle strange it's like there's there's\nvarious kinds you know yeah there's\ndefinitely yeah different kinds I think\nthe interesting thing is that when you\nhave a red flag early it gives you an\nopportunity to like work through some\nnegativity and so what tends to happen\nwhen we look for green flags is exactly\nwhat you described which is like oh this\nperson's great great great great great\ngreat great and there aren't like\nchallenges and then when a challenge\ncomes along like your your ability to\ndeal with challenges is like\nunderleveled\nwhereas when you're with someone who\nthere's some kind of conflict early on\nlike it lets you level up your conflict\nresolution skills I think that actually\nhappens over time with multiple\nrelationships too like as you have\nrelationships throughout your life you\nwill have ones that fail and you learn\nstuff from each one of those and you get\nbetter at conflict resolution you get\nbetter at communicating you get better\nat finding out what's the Line in the\nSand for you right of like what works\nfor you as a person and what you need in\na relationship and I think many people\ndon't really realize that like I had a\nbad relationship now I'll never have one\nagain it's like no you will you'll have\nmore you should have more and you'll get\nbetter at it it's a skill like\neverything else right yeah I I think\nthis theme of being safe to fail I think\nthat's the challenge is I see that so\nmuch um in relationships which whereas\npeople instead of thinking about it as\nsomething that you will get better at\nbetter at over time you have a\nrelationship and if one person considers\nyou Unworthy of love then a lot of\npeople will make a conclusion in their\nmind once again not their fault that I\nam\nunlovable um it's funny you see the same\nthing in work as OD as that is when\nsomeone gets laid off from a job M it's\nvery similar in terms of the reaction\nwhich is I got laid off from a job I am\nworthless because I tied my emotional\nself to the status of that job or I tied\nmy emotional self to the status of that\nrelationship that's never healthy I\nnever think that is at all like you are\nstill an individual person outside of\nthat and I I find that happens far often\nvery very often yeah so there there's a\nlot of interesting uh Neuroscience\nevolutionary psychology and kind of like\nyogic stuff around that so the the tying\nof the\nself to a particular aspect is something\nthat speaking of terminology in Sanskrit\nis called the aamar or the ego right so\nlike we have huh that's one I actually\nknow oh okay so that's what I actually\nknow yeah so the the ego is when our ego\ngets tied up into something and I think\nthis is something that's so confusing\nfor people is that they don't realize\nthat they are not their ego so I have a\nconception of who I am which is not who\nI am it is just a conception I I found\nsome of that is is also very cultural um\nso like I've been to France before and\nsomething I found in France is if you\nask someone what do you do they don't\ntell you their job they tell you their\nHobbies they tell you their interests\nthey tell you things that they like and\nyou're like no but what do you what do\nyou do but here in America you say what\ndo you do and they're like oh this is my\njob yeah so like it's a defining Factor\nhere where it's not a defining Factor\nthere of what you do for a living right\nand I I think that ties the emotional\nstatus to that much more because like\nyour title Your Role is who you are here\nand that's not the same everywhere yeah\nit's it's a great point I think it's\nabsolutely cultural\num anyway what I don't think either one\nis wrong they're just different you know\nyeah so the yogis would say that all\nidentification on some level is wrong\nwhether you identify with being yeah so\ninteresting yeah how do you have a sense\nof I guess you don't have a sense of\nself at that point you wouldn't have one\nno no you all you have is a sense of\nself you don't have an\nidentity so sense of self without\nidentity I understand okay I think I\nunderstand what you mean so sense of\nself with completely that identity you\ndon't have the extraneous Factor\ndefining who you are AB yeah just the\ninternal Factor so so the best way I\nwould describe it as like if you're on a\ndesert island for an hour and you close\nyour eyes and you just exist on the\ndesert island\nand imagine that in that hour what you\nexperience is the entirety of your\nlife okay right so then like you're not\ngoing to have a social like you'll exist\nyou'll be there you'll perceive things\nyou'll enjoy things you'll be frustrated\nby things but this overarching sense of\nidentity that carries over from day to\nday you just exist for that one hour\nright you don't have that broader\nidentity you don't have a social\nidentity\nand then the really interesting thing is\nthat if you really look at your life\nyour life is a string of those\nhours right your your life is just\nexisting this moment and then existing\nand then all of all of our sense of\nidentity is actually abstractions that\nare strung together they're not based on\nour experiences there external there\nexternal factors that we apply to that\nto tie them together if that makesense\ntying together is the right is the right\noperative word right so when we string\ntogether a set of experiences like a\ngood example of someone who thinks\nthey're a loser there's no such thing as\na loser they look at all the negative\npieces and they say I'm a loser because\nyes they they string together unique\nexperiences whereas those things are\nlosses so you can lose but the identity\nof a loser is not something that is like\na physical reality it's not real yeah\nit's not it's a per it's a perception\nissue that's really all yeah and and\nwhen when things are fed through the ego\nwhen our ego is the one that is doing\nthe\nperceiving then we end up with all kinds\nof perception issues yep no that makes a\nlot of sense I can understand that no\nyeah no it's it's always interesting to\nsee like perception drives reality more\nthan anything else it's it is absolutely\nthe case and you get people that are\nstuck in these weird perceptive Loops\nwhere they're like I suck they're like\nwell why do you suck and they're like\nbecause I made a mistake when I was 12\nyou know like like what look at all the\nstuff you've done outside of that right\nlook at all the things that you've done\nsince then what all the things you've\naccomplished you like you live your own\nyou have you have your own your own\nplace to live you have your own job\nwhatever it's going to be you've\naccomplished all these goals you have a\ncool relationship yeah but I made a\nmistake when I was 12 like okay like you\nhave to that kind of a perception can\ntear someone down even though it's it's\nnot based in reality it's based in just\nthat you know that little piece of a\nmemory that doesn't really matter yeah I\nI I think uh like I'm on the shtick\nrecently where over the last year I've\nbeen focusing a lot like in my own life\nand with people that I work with on\nperception so I think perception is the\none aspect ECT of cognition that we tend\nto not\nunderdeveloping our perception we'll\nthink about improving our logic even our\nemotional\nawareness um we'll do certain cognitive\nskills to improve things like like\nbecome more productive overcome emotions\nthe one thing that I think is actually\nthe worst thing in society right now is\nthat everyone's perception has become\nvery very weak so like I agree no I\nfully agree with that we see it mostly\non uh social media you see it mostly on\nsocial media you have people that have\nextremely like extreme opinions rather\nthan having nuanced approaches to things\nthey don't know how to perceive anything\nbeyond the exact thing that they've\nhyperfocused on in that one area they\ndon't know how to see a greater picture\nbeyond that e and it usually comes\nacross as they don't want to that\nthey're they're being you know jerks or\nanything like that a lot of people who\nare in those positions don't believe\nthat they're being jerks they're just\nhyper fixated on one little tiny thing\nand their perception isn't wide enough\nto see the rest of the picture on that\nand that's not like a that's like a\nmalicious thing a lot of the times it's\njust a failure to expand the perception\nand I it sucks right it's made the\ninternet really toxic it really has so I\nI think that that there I would agree\nthat social media and especially like\nthese short form pieces of stuff don't\nadd for so so the the smaller the bit of\ncontent is Yeah the\nmore our mind has to fill in to add to\nit people are trained to get a dopamine\nRush from that short content when it's\nnot even when it's not positive when\nit's destructive yeah yeah so so I I\nwouldn't say they're trained I'd say\nit's it's taking advantage of a\nbiological certainty sure yeah right and\nit's not it's not so what we know is\nthat or my running Theory I think\nthere's plenty of support for this is\nthat um emotional oscillation is what\nkeeps people engaged in\ncontent okay so I could see that if it's\ntoo dop and energic you'll actually\ndevelop tolerance it's just like if you\nplay a video game for 10 hours like\nyou're not having fun on hour eight the\nreason you continue to play is because\nof other mechanisms it's not fun right\nit's like achievement finishing out a\nparticular round grinding towards a\nparticular goal that's why they have all\nthose things because the if you really\nthink about it like especially like MMOs\nright grinding is not fun it's never\nbeen fun but people will do it for hours\nand hours and hours and hours and hours\nto get the thing at the end yeah yeah so\nso so no that makes sense it kind of\nreminds me of\nkind of like hunter gatherer sort of\nbehavior how so we so I'll give you an\nexample I go mushroom hunting right I do\nmicology so we'll go and find um like\ndifferent mushrooms here in Washington\nyeah I do I love it it's super fun right\nI raise uh oyster mushrooms in Lion's\nman and chake and RI mushrooms super fun\nfor me to do I really enjoy it and um\ndoing mushroom hunting here in\nWashington state we can actually go and\nget like um King bites King bites are\nawesome but you're walking around in a\nswamp and it's just gross everywhere and\nthen you see like a oh holy crap I got\nthe big king B they're like this big\nthey're huge man and like I've got a\nbunch of pictures of them they're quite\ncool I can send them over to you but uh\nthere's this moment where it's like\ngross gross gross gross gross and then\nyou find it and you're like wow I got\nthat and it makes me wonder like how far\nback does that kind of trait Behavior go\nfor humans because that's a survival\ntrait AB that's a we survived because of\nthis and now now it's being used to sell\nyou things on the internet but like yeah\nso Thor it's it it always amazes me how\nintuitive you are about understanding\nsome of these things so like um there's\nactually a lot of really interesting\nstudies that were done in the mid 2000s\nthe early studies on video game\naddiction really discovered that it is\nthe denial of the reward that correlates\nwith addiction right so so some people\nkind of think about this is like random\nreinforcement schedule where like you\ndon't always get but it's not just the\nrandomness there's another part to it\nwhich is if you look at like from\nsoftware games like why are they so\nsatisfying it's because it's hard to\nachieve right so like like you you wipe\non a boss you wipe on a boss you wipe on\na boss and then you get so the the rush\nof dopamine that you get correlates with\nthe amount of denial and difficulty yeah\nand everyone who beats that boss when\nanother person sees you do it they're\nlike I beat that boss and I understand\nhow difficult that was end being a\ncultural like kind of group thing abely\nso we we Society we value human beings\nbased on the difficulty of their\naccomplishments\nyeah right so absolutely and so the the\nreal challenge is that this principle\nvideo games have figured out how to take\nadvantage of but the real challenge I'm\njust thinking about this concept of\nfailure and making failure safe cuz like\nthe whole thing that's that's really\ninteresting is the more you fail in life\nand if you feel like you're a\nloser in the same principle of video\ngames where the harder a boss is to beat\nwhen you beat the boss you feel really\ngood so the really interesting thing is\nthat the more You' failed in life the\nmore I will see like a rebound so when\npeople are super super behind and they\nget one break you will be amazed at how\nquickly they can catch up yeah that's me\nI got my ass kicked for a long time yeah\nand and that's that's the real tragedy\nis that people who think that they're\nlosers in life they think that there is\na linear like you know I the race is\nlinear right but it's not you can ab you\nabsolutely have this weird potential\nenergy which is like building up so I'm\nthinking about one particular patient of\nmine who was like 32 years old when I\nstarted working with them and they had\nstruggled with addiction their whole\nlife I think they finished undergrad and\nthen in the span of like two or three so\nthey were like basically not quite\nhomeless but they were financially\ndependent on on someone that they were\nclose to like didn't have a career like\nyou know just really really bad uh worst\npossible scenario yeah yeah right and\nand then within two or three years they\nwrote a novel they became a therapist\nthemselves and like got healthy like got\ninto a healthy relationship and in like\nthree years like they went from like\nZero to Hero you know and like they've\ngot a stable job they do work that pays\nthem well and like they find like\ninvigorating and and gratifying and in\naddition to working 32 clinical hours a\nweek they spend 30 hours a week working\non their like fiction novel and they\nlike wrote a novel and in the span of\nthree years it's just amazing how much\nsomeone can accomplish and looking at\nwhat what they were how they were at the\nage of\nlike you would never know that this\nperson was behind yeah it's the same\nthing like um I've got a buddy on here\nprimagen he's another streamer\nprogramming um he talks about it all the\ntime he used to be he was a meth addict\nright he was addicted to meth and he\nmanaged to dig himself out of that went\nto work at Netflix awesome programmer\nnow has quit Netflix and now does this\nstuff fulltime and is like kicking a\nhuge amount of ass dude is amazing yeah\nand it shows you and it's funny too\nbecause people contact me they're like I\nStr struggle with addiction and I you\ncan't really fix that for them a lot of\ntimes you just say hey look over here\nyou can see that people can get out of\nthis and then you show them like it is\npossible and I think that that does a\nlot of good A lot of the times is just\nshowing them it is possible to succeed\neven in that very rough scenario that\nyou're in you know yeah so that's\nusually what I do is I'm like look at\nPrime he did it you you can it is\npossible to do this but you'll have to\nfind your route you know yeah I think\nthat's the challenge right is that's\nwhere the ego comes that's where the ego\ncomes in and the ego says they did it\nbut I can't do it because I'm different\nyeah that's the that's the biggest thing\nis it ends up being you you end up being\nYour Own Worst Enemy there that's the\nthe best advice that I have for that one\nis then make a bet with yourself tell\nyourself okay I'll see if I can do it\nI'm going to give myself three months\nI'm going to see if I can I'm going to\nput that to the side I'm put all the\nfears to the side I'm just going to do\nthis we're going to make a bet if that\nis right if I can't do it then at the\nend of three months I'll have\naccomplished nothing but if the end of\nthree months I made even a step forward\nof progress then it means that I can do\nthis and I can keep doing this and it's\njust a short BET right and what do you\ngot to lose nothing really you know so\npeople try when they're given that kind\nof idea like oh I can just make a bet on\nthis I could try it and they'll usually\nfind that in three months they've made\nsome sort of progress and they can look\nback and they be like now I've\ndocumented evidence I'm kicking ass I\ncan keep moving forward and they just\nkeep making the BET and I found that\nworks really really well especially for\npeople that don't believe in themselves\nand it's usually because of like\nimpostor syndrome you have like an\nimposter syndrome scenario where someone\njust has that little voice in the back\nof their head that's telling them you're\nnot good enough you're not going to be\nable to do this and I find that that is\nmore of a defense mechanism than\nanything else they're trying to protect\nthemselves from failure so if you make\nthat little bet and you say hey I don't\nbelieve you but we'll find out if you're\nright or not and it it works you know\nyeah so it's really interesting because\nI I think there's a lot of cool\nmechanisms that play there and I I I\nlove the the Str the strategy so a\ncouple of things that I'm kind of\nhearing the first is that there's a\nreally fascinating study about feeling\noverwhelmed\nso a lot of times people think that\nfeeling overwhelmed is a consequence of\nhow many things you're dealing with\nright so if I'm dealing with 10 things\nthen I'm going to feel overwhelmed like\nthis is objective so I think it's very\nsubjective it's very different for every\nperson so so so it's it's really\ninteresting but what what there's a lot\nof research on anxiety which shows that\nthe degree of overwhelmed you feel does\nnot correlate with the number of things\nthat you have to deal with so\nyou can deal with one thing or 10 things\nthat's not what that's the feeling of\noverwhelmed is what percentage of things\nthat you were dealing with did you\nchoose to deal\nwith I agree with it so there's this\nthis concept called active challenges\nand passive challenges passive\nchallenges are like aggro like there are\nlike challenges in your life that\naggroed you when you were like walking\ndown the street so things like oh you\nknow my parents have cancer or something\nlike that like or\nsome Jesus yeah that's bad aggro like\nyou know some negative downturn in the\neconomy like things that you can't\ncontrol so the really interesting thing\nis that there's your your mind keeps a\nratio like subconsciously of stuff that\nI signed up for stuff that I didn't sign\nup for and when the majority of my life\nis doing things that I did not sign up\nfor this is what leads to burnout so the\nreally crazy thing is and feeling\noverwhelmed and then like not actually\nbeing able to deal with those things so\nthe crazy thing is that if you're\nfeeling overwhelmed in life the right\nmove is not to do less it's actually to\ntake on more that is intentional things\nthat you can control absolutely so if\nthere are like five things that I'm\ndealing with that are outside of my\ncontrol to to take on two things will\nactually improve my performance over\ntime I actually really like that that's\nnot something that I've ever thought\nabout in that direction I think that's\nthat's really interesting because\nusually when it's when it's something\nlike that I I had never drawn the\ncorrelation between things that you did\ncontrol or did not control and it's true\nI've seen that for myself many times\nright where where I'm dealing with a\nwhole bunch of things and I can handle a\nwhole bunch of projects spin a bunch of\nplates no problem and then you have\nsomething that's like throwing a wrench\ninto the machine and it's like oh you\nknow it's like now I gotta handle this\nthing you know it's so irritating yeah\nand I I think it's get I'm sorry go\nahead I was saying I get that that\nactually makes complete sense and it's\nnot something I ever thought about yeah\nyeah so I I think when we you know when\nI first heard what you've been up to it\nsounds like you had done this feret\nReserve this game Jam you're working on\ntheir Publishing House it also sounds\nlike you're streaming I don't know if\nyou have like a a job um this is the job\nokay yeah so so you're a full-time I I\ndidn't know oh yeah um so you know it's\ninteresting because someone will look at\nthat and they'll they'll think like oh\nmy God like this person is doing so much\nhow is Thor super human well he is he\ndoes have that I sleep five hours a day\nthat's the Superhuman part that's the\nmutant um but but I I think that's what\nI tend to find is that when people take\non more they tend to do better and the\nother really interesting thing is that\nwhen you give someone this three-month\nchallenge it moves them out of the realm\nof cognition and into the realm of\naction and any shift from cognition to\naction is almost always a good\none and when people are just stuck in\ntheir own head like what's going to\nhappen is your mind will play through\nall these different scenarios that'll be\nhypothetical but you won't ever actually\nget additional data to counter your\nperceptions that's the biggest problem\nwith it is it's you you have to have you\nhave to have evidence otherwise the\nperception is just going to take over\nlike if if you're sitting there telling\nyourself you can't do it all day and you\ndon't have any evidence to the contrary\nyou're probably going to believe it you\nknow and if you give yourself even a\nmoment to have any type of evidence you\ncan defeat that immediately like well\nwhat about that and it just disappears\nyou know it floats away so I I think\nit's challenging because depending on\nyour mind your mind will shape the\nevidence so so what happens for a lot of\npeople is that you know they will try\nthings and in their mind they acted but\nit's so challenging because our mind can\nshape our\nexperience yeah um and there there ways\nto kind of get around that but or there\nare ways to clean out what our\nexperience is so that it's more\nobjective as opposed to not being shaped\nby the mind but that's a really tough\none to be honest with you changing it\nfrom like the subjective opinion to the\nobjective opinion of what's going on\nespecially when you're the actor\ninvolved in that right when you're the\none taking the action that's really\ndifficult for people yeah so it it it\nturns out it comes back to perception so\nif you look at like any action that you\ntake there is the objective reality and\nthen there is what your mind adds to the\nreality so what is the significance of\nsomeone not calling you back today what\nis the significance of an email from a\ncompany that says hey we really liked\nyou but we just don't have a position\nthat fits at the moment yep and some\npeople will interpret that as oh they\ndon't like me\nand some people interpret that as they\ndo like me I have value but they don't\nhave a position that fits yeah so some\npeople that's why I like analytics so\nmuch like that's something that I I\ndrive a lot of our businesses based on\nanalytics right and I do that\nspecifically because it's an immutable\nfact it's it's one of those ones where\nit's like you have this thing that is\nevidence of what's going on Beyond\nwhatever your perception could be you\ncould have perception that may back it\nup and move in different directions for\nideas you can try but you have solid\nevidence of what is going on how do you\nuse analytics I use analytics for\nanything that we want to do in terms of\nbusiness Direction so anytime I'm doing\nanything I find out if people like that\nthing we kind of do tests on it and be\nlike hey I talk about this thing or we\nlook at some game or anything like that\nif I'm getting a sponsor in right and we\nplay a sponsored game I go and show them\nanalytics be like this is how many\npeople wanted to engage with this people\nmay find that the game is really fun to\nwatch they just don't want to play it or\npeople may find that they want to stop\nwatching me to go play the game so like\nif you're streaming a video game that\nyou've been sponsored for and suddenly\nhalf of your audio audience disappears a\nlot of streamer would would probably\nfreak out they'd be like oh no people\nhate this but if you go and look at the\nanalytics on steamdb for the game you\nmay find that the amount of players in\nthe game has skyrocketed it as a result\nof this they just stopped watching you\nto go play it because they thought it\nwas compelling enough so you have to use\nanalytics to kind of get rid of whatever\nworried perception you can have because\nit's it ends up being a fact right and\nyou can you can find that out as an\nexample of this is quite funny one of\nthe best watched videos that I have on\nmy YouTube is me playing through outer\nWilds but one of my worst stre days was\nouter Wilds because at the beginning of\nthat stream I told people don't watch me\nplay this if you haven't played it\nbefore because it'll ruin the game for\nyou and they left it was like two-thirds\nof the audience just left so it's like\nthe worst viewership I've ever had for\nthat kind of a stream but the best\nYouTube video because they after they\nplayed the game they wanted to go see\nhow I experienced it after they could no\nlonger be spoiled yeah so you have to\nuse analytics you have to otherwise you\njust you run into these weird walls\nwhere I would have a negative perception\nI'd be like oh well I should never touch\nthat game again you know but like no you\nshould you should learn about that you\nknow yeah so it was interesting I I gave\na a talk at I think GDC about two or\nthree years ago I forget yeah um but I\nwas I I was talking to some advertisers\nabout uh\nsponsorships and and one of my beliefs\nis that I know a lot of sponsors want a\n60-second thing within the first like\ntwo minutes of the video yeah but I I\nwas explaining to them that I think that\nif you really look at like user behav\nBehavior a sponsorship at the end of a\nvideo that is tightly tied to the\ncontent of the video will do way better\nthan something at the beginning cuz\neveryone's like we want more eyes but\nthose eyes are not engaged right so so\npeople are like oh this is like they'll\njust get past it whereas if you have a\nsponsorship that is at the end of the\nvideo related to the topic of the video\nI suspect that the user Behavior will be\na lot better like in terms of what\npeople like even the fewer people will\nwatch the the ad um their ability to\nengage with what whatever the advertiser\nor the sponsor ultimately wants may\nactually be way higher so I think\nthere's a lot of challenges with the way\nthat we get data and we see this a lot\nlike in in the content creator like\nburnout management stuff that we do\nwhere like the the internet gives us in\nplatforms give us a lot of data that I\ndon't think is actually helpful they\njust give it because that's what they\ncan measure this is the big problem with\ndating apps is that they can't measure\nthe things that actually correlate with\nlike success in a relationship they can\njust upload pictures and you can write\nthings about yourself but there are no\nstudies that show that making a good bio\nlike correlates with relationship I mean\nI'm sure that that would be true in a\nsense that because it's got to get you\nmore dates but if you look at the things\nthat correlate with success in\nrelationships they're not things that\ndating apps can detect or select for you\nalso get a lot of really weird gotcha\nimages and things online that I find\nwhere people will be like look at how\nmany times I had to send out a thing\nbefore I got one reply and it would be\nlike look 5,000 you know dates and like\nit's one relationship and I think those\nare pretty misleading as well because it\ndoesn't show you the full story there of\neach of those interactions like how many\nswipes you did or anything none of that\nmatters frankly well I find that to be\nvery I think it's incredibly misleading\nfor a whole host of other reasons oh\nyeah there's a lot of reasons there it's\nmisleading but I think that one is that\none is demoralizing to people in a way\nthat's weird like really bad you know\nit's not it's not benefiting anyone to\nput that out have you heard of this\nconcept of the missing missing Reon\nno so this is so fascinating I I got to\nsend youall this link this is one of the\nmost brilliant psychological\nExplorations that I've seen sent you the\nmushrooms by the way okay cool thank\nyou so the there's like if you look at\nposts online especially about\nrelationships there's this great\npsychologist I think or maybe it's not\neven a psychologist who wrote this this\nbook about the missing missing reasons\nso it is um so basically like when\nsomeone shares a story on\nonline there will be things missing from\nthe story and the things that are\nmissing from the story are really where\nthe money\nis right so someone will say oh like\nI've been married for 30 years and then\nmy partner just woke up and just walked\nout of the house and took my kids they\nrefused to talk to me they they they\nblocked me on all my numbers you know\nlike and then they'll they'll like frame\nthings in some kind of like victim\nmentality but there's like stuff missing\nfrom the story\nyeah and and so I think it's so common\nyeah so common yeah and and even in our\nown lives if you really pay attention to\nthe ego the cool thing about the ego is\nthat the ego believes it's logical but\nit's very selective so the nature of the\nego is to ignore information that does\nnot align with what you you your ego\nwants in that moment and so one of the\nand even Carl Yung I know I'm kind of\nbouncing all over the place but Carl\nYung I think discovered this when he was\ntalking about this concept of The Shadow\nwhich is even within our own psychology\nand in our own psyche there are parts of\nour psyche that we actively suppress or\nignore and if you want to grow those are\nthe things that you need to confront\nbecause that's really where the problem\nis and if you kind of think about if\nthere's a part of life that you're not\nlooking at if that part of life is not\nfixed you will never be able to fix\nit and so a lot of times people don't\nrealize that you know they're living\nthis life that things are going bad\nthings are going bad things are going\nbad and feel like they're a victim\nbecause this person screwed me over this\nperson screwed me over this person\nscrewed me over you know the funniest\nthing about that yeah oh sorry go for it\nI think the funniest thing about that is\nyou can equit it to League of Legends or\nany competitive game oh if you're in\nbronze it is more likely that you're\ngoing to blame the rest of your entire\nteam for your team failing when you're\nnot focusing on you doing better at the\nvideo game which is going to increase\nyour ELO so this happens all the time in\ncompetitive games like if you're in\nbronze you deserve to be in bronze I've\ngot a I've got a cool paper to show you\nhell yeah give me a\nsecond but that's really what that is is\nlike you you need to focus on improving\nyourself and improving your own\nperformance there not tearing down your\nteammates so it's not gonna help you\nthis is I got to find it but what do you\nmean it's always my team note\nain't\nit's\nuh come on where's this\npaper I know I've got got it come on you\nstill can't carry four people no that's\ntrue you can't carry all of your team\nall the time but in times where you\ncould make a difference your performance\nis what matters and you'll win more than\nmore often that way and then you'll\nclimb so I gotta I gotta do some\nshenanigans on on my stream setup\nbecause I I got a screen share with\nyou on Discord Shenanigans I can watch\nthe stream I can do that if that's\neasier um well I want to show people too\nso let me see if I can do this browser\nplus 2 does this work oh sweet oh my god\ndude mods for the win this is\ngreat so now I can still see you and\nshow this so this is great oh yeah so\ncognitive flexibility in decisionmaking\npredicts expertise in the MOBA esport\nLeague of Legends so look at this so\nyou're saying that like you know when\nyou blame your teammates all the time so\nthere's there's one thing that\ncorrelates with rank okay so data was\nanalyzed by a means of correlation and\nmultiple regression analysis results\nshowed that cognitive flexibility was\npositively related to rank percentile P\nless than\n011 um so this is a pretty big\nconfidence interval so I don't know\nexactly how they measure this but it\nseems like it correlates a lot with rank\nbecause this number is big but it's very\nwide right so and what we're talking\nabout is like the ability\nto pay attent like the ability to not\nthink the way that you're thinking\nthat's what cognitive flexibility is so\nwhen people constantly blame their\nteammates there's no cognitive\nflexibility right my team sucks my team\nsucks my team sucks they're not\nflexible um let me just make sure yeah\nwe don't need this one if you turn\naround you go but maybe I suck and then\nyou work on it you go and look at the\nanalytics and you find out where were\nyou sucking you you find out like if\nyour build is even making sense were you\nbuilding you know magic into Mr Right\nyou know basic stuff like that like you\nhave to you have to think about your own\nperformance because you can't control\nyour teammate's performance but you\ndefinitely can control yours and that's\nthe best thing you can start at and then\nif you're doing that you can set an\nexample for your teammates and maybe\nthey modify their behavior well and then\nyou win yeah so I I want to make this\nvideo one day I've been recording myself\nplaying DOTA and recalibrating on rank I\nmentioned this on stream a couple times\nbut I basically had an experiment so a\nlot of people will say like if you want\nto climb in video games like don't like\nmute everybody because you'll tilt\ndoesn't work that doesn't work it's so I\nI did this cool experiment I had two\naccounts one that I use for streaming so\nthat it doesn't leak my steam\ninformation and then I have a second\naccount but DOTA recently cracked down\nso I stopped doing this but um so I\nbasically calibrated to both at the same\ntime but in one be the most toxic\nteammate is that what you're saying and\nthen are you are you saying that you\nplayed both both sides or you like no no\nso so I I played I I did my calibration\nmatches because you can recalibrate like\nevery year so I did my calibration\nmatches on both accounts but in one I\nwas muted and in one I was talking I\nthought you were trying to say you were\ntoxic in one and not toxic was like no I\nmean I I could be toxic I'm sure that\nthat would be a greater MMR variation\nbut like it it's amazing I mean I I\nthink it was it was like an 800 MMR\ndifference which is you know like a\ncouple of ranks I want to say it's like\n20 percentile points un healthy gamer BG\nit's finally happening and and when you\nlearn how to communicate in games like\nit's amazing you can I mean you will\ngain like a th MMR and there are all\nkinds of things you know speaking of\nrelationships it's like the same stuff\nlike you got to learn you know like one\nthing that I found is uh instead of\ntelling like uh my carry player to like\nstop going to some part of the map after\nthey die three times in that part of the\nmap I will ask them hey do you want me\nto place Wards so you don't die there\nagain or do you want to play around\nwhere I have Wards like tell me what you\nwant me to do and like 90% of the time\nwhen I ask them what do you want me to\ndo and I point out like hey I can play\naround this and place Awards where you\nkeep dying do you want me to do\nthat what they'll actually do is just\nswitch to the right part of the map yep\nbut if you tell themed to them yeah\ndumbass stop going there you keep dying\nthey'll I'm G to do it twice as much now\nand that's what they do yeah and that\nthat makes sense because like if if you\nif you had somebody come and attack you\nfor playing the way that you are when\nyou were failing especially in the in\nthe most vulnerable moment where deep\ninside you know that you're screwing up\nand you want to lash out at everyone\naround you and then you give them a\nTarget to lash out of course they're\ngoing to lash out at you it's just going\nto spiral the whole team out B you can't\ndo that yeah it it's it's amazing\nsometimes I'll you know I'll have\nteammates who are so good and I wonder\nhow are they at the same rank as me and\nit's because they're just so toxic\nyeah and they don't they can't prevent\ntilt and you know yeah tilting is is\nprobably the worst it it it's funny\nbecause there's a meme inside of league\nfor a long time which is like oh it's 4\nV6 right now you know that kind of\nthings it's like there's one of your\noppon one of your players has moved to\nthe enemy team when you're saying that\nyou're the one on the enemy team\nabsolutely the the the really crazy\nthing that that I've started to realize\nis I really do think we can learn just\nabout everything that we need in real\nlife from video games like I think all\nthe microcosm of gaming I think is\nsufficient like the stuff around\ncognitive flexibility how to not tilt I\nmean here we are talking about making it\nsafe to fail right and what's the\npurpose of that it's because we don't\nrealize that we're like tilted IRL like\nfeeling overwhelmed you're tilted IRL\nyou know like we blame our teammates\nright so my situation in my life is not\nmy own making it's a bad upbringing it's\nbad friends it's bad spouses and there's\nno I mean there's a ton of data that\nshows that adverse child childhood\nexperiences correlate with trauma and\ndepression and things like that so\npeople do have sometimes have bad bad\nsituations um but even the ability to\nrise above those situations depends a\nlot on these like core video game skills\nyeah I think that's actually true I I I\nthink it's funny because video games\ntaught me a lot growing up you know what\nall kinds of things like to to be real\nwith you being able to solve through\nproblems being able to analyze problems\nand find different ways to do it because\nthe game doesn't care what you're\nemotional state is the game is always\nthe same so if you're going to approach\na problem emotionally largely the game\ndoesn't care about that you're going to\nlose you're not going to solve the\npuzzle so it taught me to take the\nemotional feeling that I had put it on\nthe side for a moment take a logical\napproach to it and then kind of work my\nway through that that's where I learned\nthat it was from games that's why I do\nthat today and I do that for everything\nnow and I do it because I learned it\nfrom games when I was younger and that\nallows me to go like all right I'm\ngetting pissed off I'm going to take a\nminute we're going to look through this\nlogically and I'm just going to take\nthat emotion put it off ins side and\nwhen you go through it logically like\nlogically process that you largely\naren't going to be angry at the end of\nthat conversation it just kind of goes\naway you know we I think we talked about\nthat last time we had a talk too was was\nthe ability to just kind of take a step\nback and wait and it's it's what I\nlearned from games early on very early\nso I I'm kind of\ncurious Thor do you have any thoughts\nabout so some people are able to like\ngrind a game for hours and hours and\nhours I can do that and then they have\ndifficulty grinding IRL for hours and\nhours and hours do you have any sense\nhow to translate being able to grind in\na game into grinding in real life\nimmediate emotional feedback or\nimmediate feedback from the game the\ngame tells you instantly when you get\nrewarding or when you accomplish a goal\nor don't accomplish a goal that the best\nway I can look at this is homework if\nyou give a student a online test or an\ninteractive test where they are\nimmediately getting feedback from the\nanswers I find that to be much more\ncompelling a lot of times for many\npeople than giving them homework where\nthey have to write it all down and they\nfind out the answers the next day\nthey're less engaged with that because\nit doesn't give them immediate\ninteractive feedback and it's funny\nbecause I I see that more often with\npeople that have ADHD I don't know if\nthere's a correlation there but that\nseems Seems correct to me see see what\nmore often uh that people are less\nengaged if they have ADHD I find them to\nbe less engaged if they're not getting\nimmediate feedback on the things that\nare going on that the actions they're\nperforming absolutely a correlation so\nwe know that the the dopamine reward\ncircuitry in\nADHD uh so their ability to delay\ngratification is impaired because the\nthe time window between action and\nreward is very very tight so the the\nthat's what games give you frankly yeah\nso that's really interesting because you\nknow there's uh let me see if I can pull\nup some more research sure I want to\nshow you something it's more than just\nopen it's just all all feedback whether\nit's good or bad it's all feedback\nwhere's that Haggard\npaper oh that's why it always made me\nlaugh is one of one of the memorable\nthings that I remember from Earthbound\nMH was Earthbound had a section of the\ngame where to progress the story you had\nto sit behind the waterfall for like\nthree minutes okay and do nothing okay\nthat's tough and it was so in today's\nworld I feel that many gamers can't do\nit that's a difficult one like I I\nreally feel it's not a thing that's like\nsuper common where waiting is the\nsolution which is quite funny so like I\nalways wondered like in games like\nEarthbound how did they ever figure that\nout\nso you know so like I I I played did you\nplay the old Castlevania oh yeah so like\nyou played Simon's Quest I don't know\nspecifically which ones I played but I\nplay I played Castlevania when I was\nCastlevania 2 is just an amazing game so\nit was like go back and play these it\nwas it was I think the first game where\nI don't know if you played like Symphony\nof the Night um I did\nSimon's Quest I think was like the first\ngame I guess they had Metroid so they\nsort of like turned the level based\nCastlevania into like a more Metroid\nVania kind of game I don't know if I\nplayed Simon's Quest it's so good dude\nand there was this one part of the the\ngame where you have to find some item\nand then you have to walk up to a wall\nand you have to duck in front of the\nwall and you just have to duck and hold\nit there and if you hold it for like 30\nseconds or 60 seconds a whirlwind shows\nup out of nowhere picks you up and\nCarries you through the wall and like I\nremember we we saw that cuz we had a\nsubscription to Nintendo Power where\nthey like explained this because that's\nwhere there was no internet so you\ncouldn't like Google things but I always\nwondered like how on Earth are people\nsupposed to and there was someone who\nlike gave you a clue in town but this\nwas like poorly translated from Japanese\nso like the English speaking po there's\nlike no way like it doesn't make any\nsense you gave yourself the answer there\nthough we had to use Nintendo power but\nbeyond that you get Nintendo Power you\nhave the solution you go to school and\nnow you got the solution you tell all\nyour friends about it you're the cool\nkid yeah that that was there was a lot\nof like discussion so I I wonder how do\nthey figure these things out probably\nthat way um the the interesting thing\nthat I wanted to mention is there's a\nreally cool you mentioned this immediate\nfeedback so there's a really cool\nprinciple uh or like scientific thing\ncalled intentional binding which is what\nare the what are the things that you can\ndo to increase the repetition of a\nbehavior okay so like if I work out\ntoday\nwhat what increases the chance that I\nwill work out tomorrow now a lot of\npeople think that the reward that you\nget from working out correlates with a\nrepetition of the action right so if I\nget rewarded I will do it again and\nthere's absolutely a component of that\nreally fascinating thing is that there's\na there's a particular researcher named\nHaggard who does a lot of research on\nintentional binding and what he\ndiscovered was super cool like there are\na bunch of studies that show that there\nare three things that you can do to\nincrease I want to just find the\npaper that increase the likelihood that\nyou will\num damn it okay that will increase the\nlikelihood of repeating the behavior and\nthe interesting thing is that this\neffect is independent of the outcome of\nthe behavior so people have done\nscientific studies\nwhere no matter what you choose the\noutcome is the same and yet there are\ncertain things that you can do that will\nincrease your likelihood of repetition\nand this this feel felt to me like\nreally pretty revolutionary so the first\nis to think through your options ahead\nof time so just think consider all the\nchoices so people who intentionally\nconsider choices are more likely to\nengage in the behavior so if I'm like\nyou're intentionally choosing it and\nthen it's yeah it's not just a thing you\ndo it's a you chose to do yeah so\ninstead of like I need to go to the gym\ntoday oh my God you get into this\nconflict of I need to go to the gym I\nneed to go to the gym I don't want to go\nto the gym to go to the gym not just I\nget what do I want to how do I want to\nexercise I want I want to do it not even\nI want to do it just just considering\nyour options this this is how crazy it\nis so not even selecting just having the\nselection available yeah well I think at\nsome point you make a selection but\nhaving multiple options increases the\nlikelihood of any Behavior so thinking\nthrough do I go to the gym do I exercise\nat home even going through that\ncognitive\nprocess second thing is to predict the\nconsequences of your actions so spend\nsome time thinking through what you\nexpect to happen even just spending some\ntime thinking about it increases the\nlikelihood that you'll do it\nirrespective of what\nhappens process you're talking about I\ndo this yeah so the third thing so this\nis what I'm sure we'll Discover right\nbecause you're quite productive and\nwe'll find that and anyway the third\nthing is amount of reflection afterward\nso spending some time processing and you\ndon't even have to think a par you don't\nhave to think in a particular way you\ndon't have to do something specific you\nliterally like after a task is complete\nyou spend 5 to 10 minutes just doing\nnothing and reflecting you don't have to\nreflect in a particular direction you\ndon't have to discover anything you\ndon't have to learn anything and if you\nkind of think about it what I've noticed\nin people I work with is that some\npeople do this automatically they do all\nthree of these things and they tend to\nbe super productive and there are a lot\nof people like me who don't do these\nthings so you don't I used to not so so\nwhat so you you trained into it sort of\nyeah so I I trained it into it in a kind\nof roundabout way but like basically\nwhat I used to do is like it wasn't like\ndo I want to study at the gym do I want\nto study with my friends it was like oh\nmy God I need to study I don't want to\nstudy so I was always stuck when I take\nan action not thinking through the\nconsequences I was always stuck trying\nto work with willpower\nlike overcome myself instead of consider\nmy options predict the consequences and\nthen the other thing that I would always\ndo this is so devastating probably one\nthing that's huge is as soon as\nsomething finished whether it was good\nor bad I would move on to the next thing\nso if I studied for a test and I take\nthe test and the test is like oh man\nlike I didn't I didn't get to that\nchapter I didn't get to that chapter I\nwould immediately try to leave the test\nbehind Okay the test is over I'm done\ntime to celebrate\nT wow studed\nTate and didn't don't take in account\nany of the things that worked or didn't\nwork absolutely right so you carry\nnothing into the next envir you just you\njust yeah empty-headed you just jump to\nthe next thing so literally like\npredicting your uh considering your\noptions making a prediction doesn't\nmatter if the prediction is correct or\nnot yep and um testing the Assumption\nyeah and then just reflecting yep and\nit's it's it's funny cuz I didn't used\nto do that either and then I went\nhomeless and I have done that ever since\nthat exact process you're talking about\nthe whole thing happened after I was\nhomeless because I lived in my car for a\nyear and after that point it was like I\nnever want that to happen again let's\nslow this down a little bit let's be\nmore intentional about the actions that\nI take right all the actions that I'm\ngoing to take I'm going to be more\nintentional about this and I started\ndoing that process I didn't know that\nthat was like a standardized thing but\nyeah that's how I approach anything\nthat's the thing is it's not a\nstandardized thing so it's it's it's\nlike biologically accurate but we don't\nteach people these kinds of skills we\ndon't teach people if you want to do\nsomething what are the actions that you\ncan take that will increase the\nlikelihood of you doing that thing yeah\nwe don't know what our brain actually\nresponds to right so everyone focuses on\nbuilding habits everyone focuses on\nbuilding willpower um everyone focuses\non finding the right thing for them so\nthey're like oh the gym doesn't work for\nme whereas like what we're seeing in in\nthis is something I I literally just\nmade a lecture about this about how like\nwe as a society are becoming less\nadaptable so if you look at like\nadaptability as a trait of human\nperformance as\nSociety Society is like engendering in\nUS less adaptability because Society\nwill meet you where you are you don't\nhave to learn how to like this game\nbecause there are 20,000 games you can\nfind the perfect game for you oh sign up\nfor Tinder we have 20,000 we have\nmillion people on the platform you can\npick the perfect person for you you can\nfind the perfect food for you you can\nfind the perfect job for you now with\nlike\nglobalization and so what we're we're\nreally starting to see I'm I'm noticing\nthis like even in the 10 years that I've\nbeen practicing\nclinically people are less adaptable and\nas you become less adaptable you succeed\nless because also more extreme in their\nrequirement too what do you mean like so\nthe one of the things that I noticed\nquite a lot about is if if you have a\nvideo game and that video game has all\nthe things that you like except for this\none little thing the game is trash down\nvote bad awful developer and that's the\nthing that I think is really interesting\nis because that sort of infinite choice\nwhere you can select the perfect game\nmeans that when you have one thing\nthat's missing well then it's awful it\ndoesn't matter anymore right because I\ncould find something else and I I think\nthat that kind of goes hand inand with\nwhat you're talking about you're you're\nright it is dramatically less adaptable\nit's dramatically less interested in\nfinding any type of situation that\nalmost fits and making that work for you\nit's more what doesn't fit even a little\nbit 1% is wrong so screw that thing oh\nwhoops sorry um I'd love to hear more\nabout your homeless time but can I show\nyou something real quick yeah sure do do\nyou like when I show papers or Y and\nyeah yeah I love that so this is a\nfantastic paper um called the\nneurocognitive basis of human volition\nso this is this dude's absolute\nChad um but there's uh let me look at\nthis\num so mechanisms of human volition in\nthe\nbrain\n[Music]\nuh there's some there's some really cool\nstuff\nindependent uh\noh I think it's\nhere um reading chat yeah wild Chad it's\nsuch a good this paper is just so long\nand\ndense yeah um I read here's uh okay a\nlot so crucially this binding effect is\nfound only for outcomes that follow\none's volitional actions and is absent\nwhen the voluntary key p blah blah okay\nI think this is the\nsection\num uh give me a second it's worth the\nwait I promise\ny'all okay so first several studies\nconfirm that the ability to choose among\nseveral possible actions increases\nintentional binding so just if you have\nlots of options it increases the\nlikelihood that you will do the thing um\nso uh so here\nokay so this is what's crazy\ninterestingly this effect of free choice\nwas found both when all possible actions\nled to the same outcome and when they\nled to different outcomes so this is\nwhat's crazy the outcome this is\nindependent of the actual outcome of\nYour\nAction so simply thinking through things\nlike literally like for the same place\nyeah yeah and and and so I I think\nthat's what's so interesting when I kind\nof hear you like you know in some of the\nstuff you've like really stumbled into\nlike this idea of like let's make things\nless fearful and the cool thing is like\nit doesn't matter whether they actually\nbuild something or they don't build\nsomething because everyone is thinking\nlike oh I have to build something to get\npositively reinforced where that's not\nit right and you're talking about that\nthere's an emotional component to it\nabsolutely it's not just but it's not\njust about failure it's like literally\nlike the parts of your brain\nthat urge you to act will get boosted if\nyou think through options if you engage\nin some kind of behavior it doesn't\nmatter like it doesn't matter if it goes\nwell doesn't go well whatever like it\nit's kind of funny because people come\nto me all the time and they're like I\ndon't I don't feel like I want to do\nanything today but I have all these\nthings to do and I was like have you\ntried writing them down put them on a\nlist and then one of the things I always\ntell them is like a list can be kind of\noverwhelming for someone at first right\nso you got like five items in a list\nmake the first item in the list you\ncreating that list so then you have at\nthe end of you creating the list you\nmark that one off you're like I already\naccomplished one and now I have all\nthese other options of what I could do\nso I think that fits in exactly with\nwhat you're talking about because that's\nthe piece of advice I'm always giving\npeople and it it works it works really\nwell for a lot of people not everybody\nnothing works for everybody but the\ngrand majority of people are like hey\nthat helped me a lot I got a ton of\ndone today it's like yeah so what one\nthing that I realized that liberated my\nlist making and helped me so much with\nlists is that lists don't have to be\ncomplete they also don't have to be\ncompleted in order yeah so like I\nstarted doing this thing a couple years\nago where I would make the these lists\nbecause I was so overwhelmed and I would\nhave like 15 things on there and then I\nwould do a couple and I would check a\ncouple things and I'd look at my list\nand I'd be like oh my God there's so\nmuch left to do I have literally a pile\nof incomplete lists or like lists that\nI've not finished off and I don't even\nneed need to finish one I realized\nrecently it doesn't matter because at\nthe end of it like just getting all the\nstuff on paper and then like doing a\ncouple things and losing the list\ntomorrow it doesn't matter I'll just\nmake a new list the process of making a\nlist helps me so much so like this whole\nstack of just incomplete list I'm never\ngoing to finish it that's okay it's\ngreat I I feel the same way too is like\nI'll I'll create my task list today\nwhatever I need to do right e whether\nit's a mental checklist or just things\nthat I write down or or calendar stuff\nsometimes one of those things is just\nlike there's not enough time today you\nknow the my body doesn't want to keep\ngoing I'm going to go to bed right this\nis kind of how it is and we move it to\ntomorrow it's it's fine to do that as\nlong as you are spinning the plates in a\nway where things are effectively getting\ncompleted over time you're fine you know\nsome things have are critical and they\nhave to be handled right now but not\neverything is you know yeah so Thor I\nknow we've been kind of Meandering all\nover the place I love this but is there\nsomething in particular that we should\nbe talking about that you think we\nshould spend more time on anything that\nyou're I don't know I mean you wanted to\ntalk about the time that I was homeless\nyou asked about that we could talk about\nthat yeah so what what changed for you a\nlot pretty much everything so I I went\nhomeless God I don't even know how long\nago it's a long while ago I lived out of\nmy car for year is and I was in Colorado\nat the time and that happened because I\ndidn't have proper constraints on our\nbusiness right so like I had a business\nat the time I was working freelance I\nwas working on things with another\nperson um the way it worked is I was\ncreating programming they were creating\n3D models and we were building these\nthings together and then selling them\nonline right and they wanted to\nrenegotiate after about probably about a\nyear of us doing this together and at\nthat point we're making a lot of money I\nwas making like 10 grand a month I was\nmaking a ton of money and for a young\nperson that's a that's a ton even now\nit's a ton of money right so I was\nmaking a bunch of money for this and I\nwas not careful with my finances and I\nwas not properly constraining the\nbusiness and what this meant is I was\nspending everything I was just like\nwhatever there's a ton of money I just\ndo whatever I want right I was just\nbeing a dumbass and spending I was\nbuying you know ordering out getting all\nthe food that I wanted doing anything I\nwanted to do going to any party that I\nwanted to do anything I wanted to do and\nit was what felt right at the time but I\ndidn't know how dangerous of a position\nthat put me into eventually that person\ncame by and they're like hey I want to R\nneate I want 80% and I'm going to give\nyou 20% because I do the the art and uh\nyou do you just do the programming they\ndidn't respect that the programming was\nhalf of the half the job right and I\nsaid no like we have a deal for\n50/50 like no we're not doing that and\nthey said okay and they took all of our\nwork and they open sourced it against my\nwishes our income went gone so they cut\noff their nose to spite their face they\nlost everything as well but I was in a\nmuch more financially precarious\nposition because I was an idiot and\nspent all of my money that was on me\nright their action awful but also I\ndidn't plan for anything like that so I\nwent homeless I lived out of my car\nalmost immediately too I didn't have\nmoney for next month's rent like it was\njust like Boop gone that's a problem\nright and uh I was on a month-to-month\nsituation like that which is already\nhighly expensive so I was out and I\nlearned throughout that process it's\nlike I could blame them but where's that\ngoing to get me I'm going to get back in\nthis exact same scenario and I had a lot\nof time sitting in my car being on a\nlaptop you know taking internet from\ncoffee shops as I was sitting in the\nparking lot to think about those types\nof scenarios and be like what can I do\nbetter so that even if another person\nacts improperly and tries to abuse that\nsort of connection or the what they have\nover me that I will not be back here and\nthat's where I formed all of these ways\nthat I kind of handle problems and\nlogically walk through problems and\nhandle everything in the way that I do\nis to prevent that from happening to me\nagain so Thor let me ask you a question\nwhat was your emotional state at the\ntime oh at first I was devastated I was\nso pissed I I was absolutely enraged and\nI was I was just like I was just super\nmad right I was like you've stolen\neverything from me and then after a time\nI was like okay that doesn't get me\nanywhere you could be as mad as you want\nthe rest of the world doesn't give a\n not even a little bit that other\nperson doesn't matter right you're not\nfixing the scenario that way so it came\nto this point where it's like I could be\nmad but what does that get me wasted\ntime not getting that back that's not\ngoing to give me anything at all so I\nstarted to change that sort of idea of\nlike what's the victory condition here\nthe victory condition is to make sure\nthat this doesn't happen to me again\nlet's change the way that I feel and\ninteract through these types of\nscenarios so that it can't happen and it\nfor me that worked out really well was\njust changing kind of the objective\nbecause I think a lot of the times\npeople want to immediately get back\neverything that was stolen from them\nright everything that they lost you got\nto get back to where you were and I\nrealized in the very beginning I was\nlike I'm not getting that that's not\npossible that's unrealistic right I can\nget something new something different\nbut I can't go back to the way that it\nwas that's already out of the bag right\nso Thor what I'm kind of curious about\nis how are you able\nto\nlogically disarm your\nemotions like this is very\nrare I think it's effective anyone can\ndo it but I I I mean most people you\nknow when they get enraged they can't\njust like I I love your framing of like\nwhat's my victory condition I think\nthat's such a powerful way to deal with\nemotions like I think you've really\nstumbled onto something there I think\nyou stumbled onto a lot of things but\nwhat I'm curious about is you know I\nwork with a lot of people who they\nrequire help to decompress their\nemotions so I'm curious like what your\ninternal experience of like this emotion\nis not useful let me discard\nit I honestly feel because it doesn't\nlead to anything anything attained that\nis beneficial I could sit there and be\nenraged I could I could when I'm mad at\nsomeone on the phone I could throw my\nphone right I could have an emotional\nreaction I could throw my phone it'\nbreak my phone does that solve my\nproblems or does it make more every time\nyou have the the violent emotional\nreaction in the beginning I don't think\nthat solves anything I think it always\njust creates more problems and at that\npoint I didn't want more problems I\nstill don't want more problems so the\nway that I felt about it and the way I\nstill feel about it is take the\nemotional thing and and kind of put it\ninto a box off on the side and then look\nat it and be like does that make sense\nlike is that going to create more\nproblems let's look at all the routes\nthat could come out of that emotional\nresponse are those routes beneficial\ndoes this matter right now does this\nhave meaning does this actually get me\nanywhere that makes sense is it okay to\nfeel that because if I do feel it in the\nin the way that it is in the exact way\nthat it is where does it lead and that's\nkind of what I got out of that is being\nable to dissect that sort of response\nbefore letting it go fully forward and\nbefore that I was just like whatever do\nanything who cares right so were did\nthat change for when you had this\nexperience of homelessness or have you\nalways been like that I think it got\nmore defined that way I was always kind\nof like that when I was younger like I\nwas more like you know more logically\nthinking more more sighting with the\nlogic but I still have you know\nemotional Outburst as a human being\nright and I had that for a long time\nuntil I became homeless and then after\nthat it was like never again not\nallowing that to be a thing that was a\nbig defining moment for me was realizing\nthat I'm an adult now and there are real\nconsequences to not planning there are\nreal consequences to not thinking about\nmy actions and thinking about what can\ncome out of that and thinking about you\nknow routes and where things lead and\nthat was a that was like a no one's\ngoing to catch me now so I have to be my\nown safety net I need to take this\nseriously and think about this you\nknow that I mean so so that sounds like\nyou know like traumatic but like in a\ngood way oh yeah yes no most definitely\nit was for me it was terrifying I was\nlike what if the car breaks down what am\nI going to do right you know like\neverything was terrifying I'm curious\nwhat is your kind of emotional veilance\nnow like do\nyou like do I feel emotions or yeah like\nlike what's your relationship with your\nemotions now oh yeah no absolutely the\nonly time that that kind of like kicks\nin for like hey wait a minute is when\nI'm having an extreme emotion when it's\nlike normal it's like oh I'm happy about\nthis I'm sad about this like it's normal\nto feel sad I think that's fine there's\nnothing wrong with that there's never an\narms length for every emotion but it's\nlike a I am very angry right now wait a\nminute I am very sad right now wait a\nminute is this does this make sense\nbecause I find that when I have a very\nextreme emotion if I just kind of let\nthat go and don't think about what could\nhappen in that moment like what if I'm\nreally really sad like in anguish or\nsomething and I want to break something\njust break something off the wall right\nyou have one of those types of violent\noutbursts because of a strong emotion is\nthat going to help you no proba going to\nhurt your hand it's going to break the\nthing on the wall everything's going to\nsuck you have more problems so when I\nhave a very extreme emotion and I can\nfeel that it's an extreme emot for\nsomething then I then I hold back and I\ngo wait a minute this is this is too\nmuch right and we got to wait now and\nfigure out what that is but for normal\naverage emotion stuff I I guess there's\nlike a filter in place if that makes\nsense like there's a filter that says\nthat's a bit much hold up you know too\nfar I guess is the best way to put\nit and how do you see what you're doing\nin the\nworld like how do you see like your like\ntell me about what what you think about\nyour\nlife I think that's an external\nperspective a lot of the times of like\nthe effect that I'm having on those\naround me or any of that type of stuff I\ndo a lot of that through I try to do\nthat through objective means like I said\nanalytics before things that people are\nsaying things that people are feeling\nthings that are you know interactions\nthat people are making because it is\nhard to form in a subjective opinion\nespecially in social media especially\nonline right it is difficult to form an\nopinion of how I am doing when there are\nas an example the stream has 3 point 5\nmillion average viewers per month right\n3.5 million unique viewers Grand\nmajority of those people don't say\nanything I have no idea how they feel\nabout it right but they show up they\nwatch the stream they engage with some\nof the content and we get a bunch of\npeople into the stream into the Discord\nand I can get at least a gauge on how\neffective I am being with the types of\nthings that I'm trying to do how much\nthat resonates with other people that\ngives me a kind of basis of\nunderstanding for that even though I\ndon't have the full complete picture and\nI don't think there's any way to get the\nfull complete picture if that makes\nsense yeah so what I'm kind of curious\nabout is like so you know when we were\ntalking about being homeless you said I\nI did those three things I thought about\nmy choices I predicted my actions and I\nkind of reflected on the consequences so\nwhat I'm really curious about is when\nyou have these like things that you're\ndoing right so you're a streamer you\nhave game Jam um Publishing House faret\nReserve what I guess I I I'm not so\ninterested in the word the motivation\nisn't really the right word but I think\nit's a place to start so like what\nmotivates you like what is your driving\nforce when you do this stuff like what\ngoes on what I'm really curious about is\nwhat is the mechanism like what is the\nexperience of motivation for you not\nnecessarily like what motivates like oh\nlike like I mean like when you wake up\nright there's some kind of driver that\ngets you out of bed in the morning and\nI'm kind of curious about what is\nthat that's kind of interesting actually\ncuz I think for me it's definitely not\none of those things like oh I have to do\nit right I feel like a lot of people get\nthe uh I don't get that at all I don't\nhave that and I I think I used to for\nsome things but I've kind of crafted my\nlife around the things that I I just\nlike doing right um for instance the\nferret rescue ferret rescue is something\nthat I didn't plan on doing originally\nnever planned on doing that I just knew\nI lived in California and in California\nferrets are illegal so when I moved up\nto Washington I wanted to get ferrets I\ngot two ferrets from University of\nWashington uh their names are snail\nsnails and Loki uh Loki is still alive\ntoday she's like 6 years old snails died\n3 years later she had a heart condition\nferrets would largely have heart\nconditions here and one of the things\nthat I I realized in that moment it was\nlike I'm very sad about this this sucks\nbut also I was like but no that's okay\nand the reason it's okay is because in\nmedicine they will kill a feret after\none year that's how it works right\nbecause these were laboratory animals\nand I you know took in the laboratory\nanimals she lived for three plus years\nextra on top of what would have been her\nlifespan and I realized this is awesome\nactually it's awful that she died but\nshe got three extra years her lifespan\nwas quadrupled right over what it could\nhave been and in that moment I was like\nI feel good about this I want to do this\nmore and then I started looking into\nother rescues I was like what is the\nbiggest thing that plagues rescues where\ndo people fail doing this where do other\ngroups have problems doing this so I\nstarted to break that down and I found\nmost of the time they go the route of\nbeing a 501c3 so they're they're\nnonprofit and they have issues with\nfunding the entire time until eventually\nit closes because ferrets are exotic\nanimals they're incredibly expensive\nit's difficult to take care of them and\nthey collapse over time there's very few\nferet rescues that are out there as a\nresult of this it ends up being really\ndifficult I said how do we fix that the\ncommunity started asking hey can I see\nyour ferrets hey can I see your ferrets\nI was like I'm going to put them on\nstream and just see what happens so I\nran a test it was like maybe this could\nmake a little bit of money to help get\nrid of that kind of a problem well now\ntoday we sit at around 1,200 viewers on\nthere and it makes enough money so that\nI can run eventually the largest feret\nrescue in the United States the ad\nrevenue from that alone solved that\nentire problem so that was me going I\nlike this thing from an emotional\nstandpoint I think it does objective\ngood other people seem to like it as\nwell let's do a test to see if we can do\nbusiness in a different way so that it\ncan support itself let's try that it\nworked let's keep going right and that's\nkind of how I walked my way through that\nentire process and and it started with\nthis is an fulfillment thing for me how\ndo I have that emotional fulfillment\nthing in a sustainable way if that makes\nsense in a way where I can make sure\nthat I don't cause harm to these animals\nby putting a financially inviable\nsituation forward and then failing later\non and just having a huge problem for a\nbunch of animals that I was supposed to\nbe taken care of right so that's kind of\nmy whole process for walking through\nthat if that makes sense that does so\nI'm I'm kind of curious and even a\nlittle bit skeptical is not quite the\nright word but um I'm curious if there's\nmore so so you're saying you do this for\nemotional fulfillment that one\ndefinitely most definitely there's\nsomething what about the others okay\nyeah tell say more there's I don't know\nhow to describe this to you there is\nnothing nicer than like laying on the\nfloor with all these freaking fets right\nand they're just like they're just\nawesome animals it's just really cool\nthere's a there's a deep emotional thing\nfor me for that and I cannot place where\nthat comes from but knowing that I have\nextended the life of all of these\ncreatures and they are having better\nconditions than they did before because\nI I do a lot of medical research for\nthis I look into all the different ways\nwe can treat them part of what I do is\nnutrition and medical research to try\nand form new treatments for them and in\nmany cases I've been able to find ways\nthat we can pass that off to the\nveterinarians that we work with they'\nenacted a plan for them and we've Sav\ntheir lives that isn't a financial\nincentive for me that is 100% an\nemotional incentive for me that feels\nvery good because I know that I'm making\na difference in a way that isn't like a\nfinancial gain difference it's in a it's\nin a this animal gets to live that's\nreally nice and especially in situations\nwhere people treat them really badly so\nI know that I can correct the situation\nand fix it in a way that extends someone\nsome some's life right so I I'm curious\nThor do you find that there are two\nlayers of your and I'm kind of like\nasking a leading question here so you\nstrike me as someone who is not very\nemotionally driven right usually not and\nand so what I'm kind of curious about so\nthat that's why I'm kind of like a\nlittle bit\nconfused and I I kind of have a\nhypothesis but I'm kind of curious\nwhether you find that there's two layers\nwould you say that there's two layers of\nyour emotional experience there's like\none where you're kind of it's not like\nyou know you have a lot of exercise over\nit and then there's another layer of\nemotions that feels just feels different\nright cuz\ngratification of your positive emotions\nokay I don't I don't think there's\nmulti-layer system there I think that to\nme it's one of those things where it's\nlike I understand that this is a\npositive thing for me I think that I am\ngetting positive kind of feedback from\nthis in a way that's emotional for me\nbut also can I can I do that more in a\nway that adds for other people and ads\nfor these animals it's a mutual benefit\nthing at that point the animals win the\nviewers win I win does that make sense\nit makes a lot of sense I think anything\nthat you'll see that across everything\nthat I try to do is like I don't like\nthe idea of one person winning it's the\nwhole thing of you know Rising tide\nraises All Ships anytime that that's\ngoing on like that's why I brought the\nmoderators on fulltime that's why I do\nall the free knowledge that we can do on\nthe Discord everything that I try to do\nis with that because\nit this is funny because it's it feels\ngreasy otherwise it feels wrong right if\nyou like the the way that I feel about\nit is if I become a millionaire I\nprobably screwed up I did something\nwrong right is like put it into other\nthings that actually have meaning and do\nsomething of tangible benefit and the\nfet rescued to is definitely an\nemotional fulfillment thing but when\nhaving something like that where the\nstakes are so high where things can go\nwrong and then animals can be hurt\nbecause you didn't plan ahead there has\nto be that logical component of making\nsure it's self- sustainable which is\nexactly what the stream is for so it's\nthe logic side ensuring that the\nsituation is safe enough for me to get\nthe emotional fulfillment and do\nsomething that I think is good that\nhelps other things like the animals you\nthe ferrets and the community because we\nalso spread a bunch of knowledge in that\ntoo try to spread it around can I think\nfor a second\nsure so basically what I'm kind of\nthinking through\ninternally is\num slightly more esoteric Concepts so\nI'm kind of hunting for an answer and\nlike so when when I see your life I see\na lot of two things Dharma and Karma so\nDharma is Dharma are you familiar with\nthat term yes that's the things that you\nare obligated to do that you're like\nyou're intended to do versus the\nthings it gets it gets translated as\nDuty usually yeah Duty yeah okay but I\nthink it's a different emotional\nveilance from should so I think it's and\nso and then the other thing is is karma\nso like that that what is happening in\nyour life feels to me like a chemical\nreaction that is playing out that a\ncouple of pieces were put in a few and\nthere was a predisposition for something\nand you're kind of leaning into that\nthat's kind of why I ask about this\ndouble layer of emotion so I find that\nfor a lot of the work that I do there\nthere is like sort of a different\nfeeling so one is like a deeper sense of\nof Dharma or a feeling of like\nrightness which is which can be\nemotionally gratifying but I think the\nthe the fluctuation of the emotional\nexperience of those things is almost\nlike independent of this other quality\nand in fact I think that it's the second\nthing that allows me to sustain the\nemotional variance right so like if if I\nloved streaming and I did it for\npositive emotions\nthen that would not work because the\nemotions are not always positive\nsometimes they're negative so so the key\nthing about Dharma from a almost like a\nscientific perspective is it is that\nwhich allows you to act and persistently\nact outside of the variance of emotions\nand\noutcomes so the reason that I'm kind of\nasking you this kind of stuff is because\nlike like I I get a lot of vibes from\nyou that that track to this concept in\nin the meditative tradition from having\ndone a lot of meditation in a past life\nI think I've mentioned that to you\nbefore because you you have you int it a\nlot of things that are like normally\ntaught and so when people when they say\nlike okay like so if you if you spawn\nand you're level like 50 as opposed to\nlevel 10 how do we understand that oh\nlike you just xped up prior to spawn and\nthen you you carry over when you respawn\nyou carry over some experience you're\nsaying I'm on New Game Plus okay you're\non New Game Plus yeah beautifully said\nbeautifully said right so many of the\nthings in your life feel very new game\nplush-ish to me so your capacity for for\nlike\ndiscrimination um and by that I mean\nlike being able to like and your your\ninternal awareness Your Capacity to like\nthink through okay like what is the is\nthis a good thing or is this not a good\nthing let me abandon it that's very rare\nso like most of us when we think through\nthings and it's a bad thing we keep we\nstill keep doing it I can't do that\nright but that's what I learned at that\nmoment when I was telling you when I was\nhomeless it's like I didn't do that\nbefore that not really not to the\ncapacity I do now fair enough so so I\nand and this is where I don't know if\nlike you know this is I have a\nparticular way of viewing the world it\ndoesn't make it correct and and we could\nultimately say that everything comes\ndown to just there's just one layer of\nlike emotional veence and that's what it\nis what it is what it is but but really\nlike everything you're describing like\nscreams to me of these two concepts and\nI was just curious if you have\nencountered those before if you think\nabout it because I I don't I've never\nencountered that I I I guess that to me\nthat kind of splits between like emotion\nand logic because the emotional need is\nlike hey this this feels great to do\nthis I feel fulfilled doing this but\nit's beyond that there's like something\nelse there if that makes sense yeah I\njust can't it's hard to describe that\nthat's what I'm talking about so is\nthere a third variable and the logic is\nabout the implementation so once the\ndriver is there the logic is like you\nknow like how do we do it exactly it's\nthe how it's not the it's not the what\ndirection you're going\nin for me it's like like I have I have\nthe the thing is like why do I want to\ndo this how do I want to do this and\nthen at the end of it it's like okay if\nI do this does that make me drop\nanything else that's a big one does it\nget in the way of any other things\nobjectives that I have can I make it so\nthat it's sustainable in a way that I\ncan step away from it and it works can I\nmake this so it expands like there's so\nmany different things that go into that\nit's a lot of pieces if that makes sense\nyeah but all that comes afterward yeah\ndo you get what I'm\nsaying all of it comes afterward so let\nme ask you this do is the reason you do\nit because it needs to be\ndone I think the world is an objectively\nbetter place if I do it it becomes a\ncompelling Factor how do you understand\nthe specificity of how you make the\nworld a better place like why do you\ncare to make the world a better place in\nparticular\nways I can't make the world a better\nplace and always I can do it within my\npurview there is a limit to what I can\ndo as an individual so because of that I\nwant to do that specifically in this\ncase because I can make a difference\nhere it is possible within what I know\nmy knowledge of it my interests and my\nmeans if that makes sense so but there\nare many ways in which you could make a\ndifference how do you decide which ones\nto\ndo is that your emotional response to a\nparticular thing like why farit as\nopposed to anything else so for instance\nif I if I decided to get very deeply\ninto an aspect of something I don't know\nanything about right now now it'd be\nvery hard to make a difference inside of\nlike that area the reason why is because\nthere would be a perception that I'm not\nan expert in that area the perception\nfrom the general public means that it's\nmuch harder for you to CH make a change\nthere make a difference a real\nDifference by going down this route and\nshowing all this stuff with ferit and\ndoing everything that I have and having\nthis entire all this information all\nthese things that I'm doing it makes it\nmuch easier to make a difference because\nnow we have something that is widely\nseen as being positive force inside of\nthat area now I can actually make a\ndifference but if it's an that I'm\nstarting from scratch on there's all\nthose pieces that have to fall into\nplace first before people trust you\nenough that you can make a difference if\nthat makes sense it makes a lot of sense\nso so I'm I'm kind of curious because I\nI'm I was it\nit my guer counter is going off the\ncharts but when I talk to you about it\nit it doesn't seem accurate right okay\nso so I'll just like share my own\nperspective and I think this is just\nsomething I just got asked waiting for\nthe like the golden question to uncrack\nbecause maybe there's a Mis Maybe like a\npiece that's missing there that I don't\nunderstand yeah yeah no I I I I don't\nthink there is a piece that you you\nmisunderstand that's why what I'm going\nto do is just share my perspective and\nI'm curious what you think about it sure\nso I have a logical mind I have an\nemotional mind so if we look at emotions\nlike we also know that there's like Two\nbasic kinds of emotions there's are more\nprimitive emotions like\nanger fear and then we actually have the\nsecond layer of emotions called social\ncognitive emotions completely different\npart of the brain Pride shame guilt that\nthat second layer of higher human order\nemotions requires other humans to be\npresent so reptile I don't know if a\nreptile ever is capable of feeling\nguilty but a reptile can feel anger or\nfear so these are the layers of the self\nso in my experience there is a third\nlayer of stuff so this is where I would\nsay Dharma and Karma operate so\nsometimes when I'm meditating for\nexample like I have a particular\nlike insight and then I will sometimes\nact on that insight and it's weird like\nsometimes I will not have spoken to\nsomeone in many many years and I'll\nreach out to them and there's something\nkind of going on in their life and it's\nkind of like spooky so like there's some\nsomething about my experience of life\nmakes me think that there's a third\nlayer of stuff and when I think about\nthe work that I do I think about what is\nlogically good and I think about what is\nemotionally\nfulfilling and clinical practice is\nsufficient so in clinical\npractice\nI would did make would make way more\nmoney than I make now because doctors\nget paid very well in the United States\num and so and then I find the work very\nfulfilling like it's like it's great\nlike I love doing it I trained really\nhard at this every day is like\nfun really yeah uh you know I tend to\nwork with people for maybe a year or two\nso I I don't usually work with people\nfor like 10 years it's like people come\nin we help them and then like I get to\nmeet new people very intellectually\nstimulating um you know I I can work a\nlot in a short amount of time plenty of\nspace for leisure activities emotionally\ngratifying and yet something about that\nwas not fulfilling right so I guess\nthat's maybe the dimension that I'm kind\nof talking about is like there's a third\ndimension of emotional veillance and\nwhat is logically a good idea or a bad\nidea did you feel like like I guess at\nthe point like beat the level sort of a\nthing too comfortable uh not necessarily\nso actually it was fulfilling so so this\nis where like you know I experienced\nwhat I can best be described as a\ncalling right so we use we use some of\nthese words like\ncalling and and I think that that tracks\nto things like Dharma or Karma and now\nit makes sense to me like so I have a\nkarmic debt to pay to the internet and\nthere's the golden word what the calling\nso tell me it felt like this is correct\nyes yeah so see that's the thing so so\nthis is\ncorrect that doesn't come I'm making a\nstatement here a hypothesis which I'm\nasking you to agree or disagree with in\nmy experience and what I would venture\nfor you is that this doesn't come from\nlogic or emotion no it was a totally\noutside thing where does it come from\nI have absolutely no idea cuz when that\nhappened that this is correct that was\nthe moment where I understood that\nsnails died but she had lived three\nextra years and that was the moment\nwhere I was like this is the correct\nthing I want to do this more it wasn't\neven I want to do this more it's I'm\ngoing to do this more yes how do we make\nthat work how do we have that how does\nthat function how do we how do we build\nthis in a way that it isn't like the\nfailures that other people have had how\ndo we build this in a way where it\nactually works do it and then kind of\nthrow everything together make the\nhypothesis all the logic stuff comes in\nafter that yeah so I I smelled it that\nwas I was wondering I was wondering when\nyou were going to come because I was\nlike there's something missing here\nsomething's not being communicated what\nI'm so what I'm so curious about is like\nI haven't understanding this stuff and I\nI can explain it if you want but like\nI'm I'm so curious because you you know\nyou you you get there on your own so I\nkind of like I can't explain it if you\nwant to but that that also like there's\nsome amount of personal exploration\nthere's some amount of like reading a\nbunch of books but what I'm really\ncurious about is how do you understand\nthat\nI I don't want to pollute you with the\ncalling portion\nyeah I don't know I think that's one\nthat's kind of outside of my purview\nfrankly and it's it's funny because it's\nnot like a religious experience or\nanything like that it was just like this\nis correct we're going to do this now\nlike that's how that's going to go right\nI'm going to I'm going to take the\nemotional side of this this is\ndefinitely fulfilling in that part it is\nThe Logical side of it we like this can\nbe done right this is possible to be do\nand then also that third esoteric\ncomponent of whatever that is I want to\ndo this this is getting done right and\nthen on top of it it's also the other\nstuff for me too which goes into the\nemotional side of it which is there is a\nreal benefit to the animals there's a\nreal benefit to people that get to\nengage with this and it's it's something\nthat I find to be good in the world so\nthat's all on the emotional side and the\nobjective side is like cool like The\nLogical side is like cool it can pay for\nitself I don't have to worry about that\nI never have to worry about it\ncollapsing right if I position this\ncorrectly which is always a thing you\nalways have to figure it out are you\naware of other things that come from\nthat third layer so we talked about the\nfaret thing the fa thing is like that's\nG counters off the charts but I'm\ncurious like have you noticed that that\nlayer in other parts of your life\nconstantly so doing free and open open\ninformation I gain that from the hacking\nCommunity when I joined in with the\nhacking Community I I go to Defcon and\ncompete and everything like that a big\npart of being a hacker is spreading as\nmuch information as possible teaching\nother people to solve problems that are\ndifficult with interesting Solutions\nright so my discord's completely\nstructured that way I don't need to do\nthat I could definitely gate that behind\na whole bunch of pay walls or other\n but that component says Nope do\nthis free do this free and release it to\neveryone and that's exactly why I do\nthat is it makes sense to do that it is\nthe correct action to take you know\nanytime that I'm I'm taking a stance on\nthose types of things there is that\nextra component is not a not a purely\nlogical not a purely emotional it's that\nthird piece and I've kind of traveled\nwith those and use those for different\nreasons of choosing different things I\nwant to focus on right the ones that are\ntruly important to me are the ones that\nthat third component takes place and it\ndoes happen quite a bit there's a lot of\nthings there and I think it's for me\nthat's what defines me as myself if if\nthat because we all have emotions we all\nhave logic but the things that I decide\nnot even decide the things that I am\ncompelled to do from that third piece is\nwhat I determined to be me if that makes\nsense that yes I think that is\nconsistent so I'm curious what what do\nyou think that third piece\nis that's difficult to discern me right\nlike everybody's going to have their\nthing I guess that for me is my thing\nwhatever it's going to be and I feel\ncompelled to engage in that thing right\ncan I can I ask um about so I I know\nyou've had a like can I ask about your\nrelationship your\nrelationships sure yeah so I'm curious\ndoes the third element does\nthat have does that inform you about\nanything relating to your\nrelationships yeah actually you sh with\nus yeah when I um when I I got married\nactually that was a big thing it's like\nthat felt correct that felt like it was\nthis was the thing that I want to do\nthis is exactly what it is there's an\nemotional side to it there's a logical\nside to it the emotional side is like\nhey this relationship is really working\nbeen together for a long time this all\nmakes sense logical side is like do you\nhave enough money to buy a ring you\ngonna look like a dumbass you know like\nthat it's like a normal one\nit's quite funny but then like also the\nother things is like am I jumping\nanything too soon does it make sense to\nactually go and try this is anything\ngoing to work right and then go along\nwith that right and yeah that\nrelationship ended really devastating\nbut at the time in that moment I could\ntake that as a definition for me of like\nthis is the right time to do this I feel\ncorrect about this for all their aspects\nof this and there's that third component\nthat says go for it you know in terms of\ngetting married yeah well in terms of\nyeah proposing what does the third layer\nsay about the end of your\nmarriage that it's fine that it doesn't\nalways work out and like I for me I\ngained a lot of experience from that I\nlearned a lot there it is even though it\nended that's okay and it's this is going\nto be such a bad like such a weird way\nto post it it's like an old multiplayer\ngame right multiplayer games are amazing\nat their Peak they're phenomenal and one\nday that multiplayer game ends nobody\nplaying anymore doesn't work and we kind\nof can sit around and pine for the old\nday of when it was perfect and it was at\nits peak and it's amazing or we could be\nlike I was there I experienced that and\nI can remember that fondly and I can\ntake that into account for the rest of\nmy life you know and that's I see it as\nthe second piece you know I I had that\nexperience and it was great and I\nlearned a lot from it there was upsides\nand downsides and I'm happy about it you\nknow yeah so that that's weird man like\nI I'm I'm really like this guer counter\nis going off the charts cuz like this is\nso consistent right so so like this is\nwhere yeah it's so interesting that you\nnever like learned this stuff so this\nlike kind of gives me makes me feel\nspooky because like this is where all\nthe things that you were saying are are\nwritten about right so even your\nperspective like the conclusions that\nyou're coming\nto um the existence of the third layer\nof stuff and uh I don't know where it\ncomes from so yeah no I mean even even\nyour your hesit to describe it I ask you\nlike what is it and you say it's me and\nyou don't give it quality so this this\nwas one where it's kind of difficult\nyeah yeah so this what's really cool is\nlike the Sanskrit description of what\nthat third place is is n NTI and NTI is\nnot this so it is not this not this so\nit cannot be described it's not the\nemotion it's not the logic it's\nsomething else it it cannot be described\nit is that which cannot be described so\nyeah me right so you can't you can't\nattach words to it and it's really\ninteresting because you don't even try\nto attach words you don't even get into\nthat which tells me that you really\nunderstand it because you're like okay\nit doesn't it doesn't have a form or a\nshape it is like that which is left over\nit's also something that I find I cannot\nanticipate when it happens I'm like Yep\nthis and it's like where' that come from\nI don't know yes so that's another\nfeature of it it is spontaneous yeah and\nthere's there's no way to plan for it\nit's an EXT ra variable that shows up I\nguess is the best way to put it yeah\nyeah so I'm curious though have you\nfound things that get you closer to\nit or things that move you further\naway I would say yes I think there's\ndefining factors there which is why I\ndescribed it as me as self right\nlike a good example of this being\nincredibly transparent with things right\ntrans arent with business transparent\nwith the feret rescue transparent with\nthat I found very early on one of the\nfirst things that I wanted to fix was we\nwere starting a game studio and I wanted\nto do a Kickstarter and I found that the\ngeneral standard was there's a whole\nbunch of these games that do\nkickstarters and they run away with the\nmoney so I was like how do I fix that\nand that compelling Factor like stepped\nin and said why don't you stream all of\nit why don't you just show everybody\nright and it kind of breaks the\nperception of oh I can't stream as a\nprogrammer I can't stream as an artist I\ncan't stream in these types of things I\ncan't show people the world this and it\nalso breaks the perception of he's not\nworking on anything I could see him\nworking it removes any Whispers of that\nimmediately because people can see it\nthere's a track record for that and I\nthink it was the first thing that I was\nlike okay that worked here what if that\nworks over here what if that works over\nhere now it makes sense now it starts\nstepping away from just being a\ncompulsion there where it's like this is\na standard for me now is make sure that\nthis is always part of things that I do\nas a carrying thread because it's not\njust that it works it's that it is\ncorrect if that makes sense it is a\ncorrect thing in the way that I have\nDefine things it is correct right and I\nfeel like that is a better option in\nfact I've even seen other people\nImplement that we actually have a um a a\nveterinarian here where they have glass\nwindows on everything for absolutely\neverything you can watch your pet in\nsurgery anytime you can see everything\nthat all of the attendants are doing all\nthe way in the back which is a wild\nconcept that's not something you ever\nsee but they have this set up and the\ncustomers like the people who come in\nwith their animals and they're super\nnervous they're way less stressed out\nbecause they see what's going on they\nknow what's happening they may be upset\nbecause it's a crisis situation but they\ncan see and they don't have to sit there\nwondering is something going to go wrong\nare they going to come out and tell me\nmy dog is dead they can see what's\nhappening they know in real time and\nit's it's actually really interesting\nit's like a really interesting thing so\nI've seen other people implement the\nsame thing and it it makes sense right\nso that's why it feels that way to me\nyeah so so it's it's once again\ninteresting so I I think like there's um\nwhat you describe as transparency I\nwould describe using the Sanskrit word\nSatya which means\ntruthfulness okay there's also like a\nweird there's like weird angles to this\nand I'm I'm just kind of curious but\nlike uh you know so I I also notice that\nyou're accumulating a lot of Shakti or\nenergy so there's like all these like\ntexts that say that when you start\nliving in accordance with Satya you will\naccumulate like energy and things will\nbegin to manifest around you and this is\nvery like spooky and gets turned into\nyou know the secret and the stuff for\nlike Oprah's Book Club I I don't put a\nwhole lot of stock into that that's okay\nbut but I you know it's just it's so\ninteresting to see so many principles\nthat I've learned about or studied about\nand it seems like you're kind of like\nliving them so like when you live a life\nof\ntruthfulness um I certainly found that\nit has been very very like good for me\ntoo so I started like intentionally\nbecoming more and more truthful and\nthere's a there's a really\ninteresting see a lot of people don't\nrealize that being truthful in life\nactually makes your life better and\nmakes you more powerful so if we think\nabout lying lying is all about the\navoidance of consequences and if lying\nis about the avoidance of consequences\nthen you can continue engaging in\nbehavior that you don't have to pay the\nconsequences for and you should be\nbecause it and it's usually more\ninefficient whatever it is going\nabsolutely yeah and and so the really\ninteresting thing is that when I kind of\nlike stopped lying I think maybe once in\na blue moon I'll lie like I want to say\nmaybe two or three times a year but are\nyou lying right\nnow I don't think so maybe this is one\nof the two or three um but but what I\nreally found is that once you stop lying\nit changes your behavior so if you take\nlying off of the table the way that you\nhave to live your life changes yeah I\nused to lie all the time as a kid\nconstantly what when I was a kid I lied\nconstantly I was constantly worried of\nconsequence I was like trying to avoid\nall that lie about everything right like\nand I realized over time I was like this\nis this is a lot of energy to like\nupkeep all this like because you're\nconstantly like trying to spin the\nplates on like which lie did you tell to\nwho and it just turns into this web of\njust like why it's just waste it's all\nwasted energy it's ridiculously wasted\nenergy I I think that was something I\ngrew out of because it was just\nstressful and stupid right you know it's\njust a huge waste of time massive waste\nyeah so that that's interesting because\nthat that's a very logical take and and\nand that's where in sort of these\nEastern systems there's like a weird\nesoteric take which is that when you say\nit's a waste of energy they also equate\nout that leakage of energy with like\nless manifestation in the world yeah I\nmean that's absolutely I I could see\nthat being absolutely true but not in a\nmanifestation way the the way that I see\nit true is like this if you were\nspending all of your time upkeeping the\nWeb of Lies that you've created how are\nyou forwarding your life where do you\nhave time for that where do you have\ntime to put it into things that could\ngive you benefits going forward you're\nspending all this time maintaining this\n that doesn't actually give you\nanything tangible when you could be\nlearning a skill do but doesn't lying to\npeople Advance you in many ways\nlike sometimes but not forever and\nthat's the biggest problem with that is\nif you get caught in a lie it can set\nyou all the way back to ground zero or\nbefore that you could lose everything\nwhen if you spend the time on actually\nlearning something you can spend the\nsame amount of energy doing that you\nkeep that forever and that's kind of\nwhere that went for me is like yeah I\ncan understand that being a aspect of\nmanifestation but it's not really a\nmanifestation it's a it's localized to\nyou yeah it's localized to you there's\nno connection to outside things that's\nhow it feels to me yeah you are you are\ncreating scenarios in which you have\nmore chance of succeeding because you\nare spending time on cultivating keys\nfor all these doors that you might you\nknow arrive to if that makes sense and\notherwise you're just spending time on\nnothing right you're spending time on\nmaintaining this big around\nhere doesn't make sense I I think I\nthink there's there's uh that I think\nthat's a fair take I I'm still somewhat\nconflicted about whether there is some\nkind of connection to Outer things or\nthere some kind of manifestation and\nthat also gets to this um you know this\nthird layer because where does the third\nlayer exist it could be right do you\nthink that the third layer is is\ncompletely localized to you that I don't\nknow right that's something that is an\nimpossible question to answer it could\nbe a feeling thing it could be like wow\nyou know there's like I think a lot of\npeople describe that as like kind of\ndivine intervention right like I had God\ntold me this thing and I went and did\nthe thing because I felt compelled to do\nit and that came from God right but I'm\nnot really all that religious so for me\nit's like well if that is a religious\nexperience that's I could describe it as\na religious experience but in reality\nfor me it's like does that make sense\nfor me not really because I don't spend\na lot of time on that right so it's one\nof those things where it's like this\ncame from somewhere I don't know where\nand it's that's like you said it's the\nnot this not this so what is this don't\n[Music]\nknow if we get canceled again then we'll\nwe'll we'll have to\nI I guess then maybe that's the\nuniverse's way of telling me that this\nconversation needs to be private but\nyeah or something I don't know I don't\nknow so once again like the third the\nthird space sometimes sends me\nsignals the signal is talking about like\nthe third space and like the whether\nthings are manifesting in the universe\nand like yeah or like whether it's just\nin here yeah and like this is what I\nmean man it's weird bro like I\ndon't know if this is cognitive bias on\nmy part where I'm like looking at these\nrandom events and I'm making order of\nthem right so we know that like our\nbrain will look at like clouds and we'll\nsay like oh that's a feret but like\nthat's not a fet we we make we make\nsignal out of noise all the time as the\nhuman brain yeah it's because we're\npattern recognition yeah right like\nhumans are an amazing pattern\nrecognition processing machine that is\nthe superpower that we have hands down\nand sometimes that leads us to making\npatterns out of things that don't have a\npattern yeah pretty normal I think\nthat's pretty 50% win rate\nbut also ghosts are creepy so like you\nknow yeah so what what um and sorry I I\nlost my kind of train of thought which I\nthink is perfect because now tell me\nwhat what what would your turn I I asked\na bunch of questions I think we've\ngotten to where I wanted to\ngo but so when you're talking about when\nyou're talking about not this not this\nwhat do you think this\nis what is the this to you uh so the\nthis is I'll give you like a personal\nanswer and then I'll give you a um like\na more like academic answer if you want\nso the first is this is\nexperience so if we look at like if we\nlook at the nature of reality okay so we\nknow that there's like a physical and\nnow we're going to like leave science\nbehind Okay so now we're like we're and\nthere's some maybe scientific stuff\nwhere people like to talk about the\nquantum but I I find that most people\nwho talk about the quantum don't know\nwhat they're talking about and they're\nlike just full of BS um but so so we're\nleaving science behind for a moment if\nthere's some science to be added we can\ntalk about that like we can talk about\nsome scientific correlates of what I'm\ngoing to say but if we if we look at it\nbasically like we think about the world\nas primarily material right so like the\nworld like is what I can see is what I\ncan touch Etc but there is a layer of\nexistence that is experience so when I\nexperience a thought when I experience\nemotion when I taste a strawberry sure\nthere are taste buds though there's like\ndifferent nerves in my tongue that go to\nmy gustatory cortex travel to my\nThalamus travel to some part of my brain\nwhere I experience taste we know that\nall of that electrical activity is\nhappening but if we if we look at like\nthis is a little bit more philosophical\nnot my area of expertise so I'm probably\ngoing to butcher it so like there's this\nconcept of like qualia or qualia which\nis like the fundamental like\ndifferentness of different kinds of\nthings so experience is fundamentally\ndifferent from objects in the same way\nthat like matter and energy are like\ndifferent\nso that's where this is so the and if\nyou look at it like experience just like\nmatter so matter can be collected in\ndifferent forms okay so like for example\nlike there's this concept of a molecule\nwhich is just matter and then I can put\nmolecules together to make a cell and\nthen I can put cells together to make a\nperson I could put molecules together to\nmake a cup right so this is like Silicon\noxide and so like there's there's all\nkinds of stuff that objects can assemble\nbut at the end of the day it all breaks\ndown into\nmatter yep so experience is the same way\nwhere experience can be broken down into\nits its individual basic components into\nits Atomic nature and the third thing\nthe third layer is in that\ndirection now the interesting thing is\nis that generally speaking when we break\ndown matter into its constituent\ncomponents we tend to think about a\nreduction in\ncomplexity but there's this concept and\nnow we get a little bit more so I I I\nthink what that thing is is tapping\ncloser into pure\nexperience so that's the thing right\nit's not logical but it's absolutely\nexperiential like you feel it you get\nbetter at it over time the more that you\nlearn and and so I I would say that for\nme that's where like I call them\nknowings so sometimes when I work with\npeople like in a more spiritual way like\nwe'll talk a little bit about a\nparticular kind of of spiritual practice\nthat I do that increases your connection\nto this thing and there are all kinds of\nother like weird manifestations to this\nbut um so this thing you know this third\nlayer of stuff it's actually like kind\nof like this infinite potential is the\nway that I would describe it so even any\nmanifestation or form is actually a\nreduction so if you kind of think about\nlike you know a blank piece of paper\nlike or actually a better example is a\nblock of wood so one of my favorite\nbooks is this book called in search of\nSchrodinger's\nCat and at the end of the book it's a\nbook about quantum mechanics and physics\nand I think it's like pretty accurate I\ndon't think it's one of these like you\nknow spirituality quantum mechanics\nthings I think it's written by a a\nphysicist and so you know at the end of\nthe book they have this beautiful\nanalogy that they're talking about\nthings like the particle wave Duality\nand they say that if I show you a block\nwood and I say Thor your face is inside\nthe block of wood and you're like that's\ncrazy and then sure enough like I take a\nchisel and I take a hammer and I chisel\naway and we find your face look it was\nthere all along so there's kind of this\nidea in physics\nthat you know the world gets shaped by\nthe way that we look at it but in its\ncore form it is\nundifferentiated so I don't really\nunderstand this stuff but there's some\nstuff about like you know the universe\nexisting is a probability waveform and\nthen the act of and it collapses when\nyou view yeah when you view it right so\nlike and some people will say oh that is\nproof of this like Eastern concept of\nundifferentiated Consciousness that then\ncollapses into form Sanskrit which is\nrup right so this thing doesn't have Ro\npeople also use it as a basis for saying\nthe universe is a simulation and part of\na computer yeah so I I can't comment on\non the physics connection to that I\nthink there it seems to make sense to me\nbut I'm not an expert in\nso that's what this third thing is this\nthird thing is and so in the academic\nsense we have a couple of different\nstates of Consciousness we have sleep we\nhave dreams we have\nwakefulness and then we have or sleep\ncan also be unconscious and then there's\nthis fourth state of consciousness\ncalled Dua Dua is a state of\nconsciousness without object so the\nsense of self so right now as we go\nthrough the world I am here and you are\nthere so if I'm playing a video game\nlike I am playing the game and things\nare happening in the game but even when\nI worked with like Esports teams we we\nkind of talk about becoming like a\nDivine incarnation of a player where you\nwere one with the game and you'll see\nlike some of these players like make\nthese just amazing moves and it's like\nthey reach some Transcendent level of\nskill where I'm sure there's a\nneurologic correlate but when we talk\nabout how to do that consistent\nconsistently it is becoming one with the\ngame yeah so even we see that in other\nways too like pretty much any athlete or\neven even ones like NASCAR you know like\nthey they it's even funny because we\nkind of explain that in certain audities\naround the world where like you get in a\ncar accident it's not they hit my car\nthey hit me you know and that's so\nthere's little pieces of that and other\nstuff which is interesting that actually\nis considered a misidentification so\nwe'll we'll talk about that but so the\nthe main thing is\nthat um so the closer you get to this\nthing the better you will be so even in\nterms of like flow state is like one\nstep closer to this thing because in the\nFlow State you said it yeah uh let me do\nthis let me\num screen share with you hold on give me\na second give me a second I gotta I can\nsee on the stream\n[Music]\ntoo when people here that we offer\ncoaching at HG their first question is\nlike what on Earth even is that so\nhere's the basic problem when you\nstruggle with something in your life you\ndon't see the problem from the outside\nyou see it from the inside the value of\na coach is that they can look at your\nlife from the outside they can\nunderstand what's going on and they can\nhelp guide you to improve things like\nmotivation accomplish short-term goals\nand even increase a sense of purpose in\nlife and over the long term we also see\nimprovements in feelings of depression\nand anxiety and the best part is we've\nhad over 100,000 coaching sessions and\nwe incorporate that feedback to\ncontinually improve our program so if\nyall are interested in actually making a\nchange in your life check out the link\nin the description below so Thor I know\nwe um got our our last conversation got\ntruncated by the the universe and and we\ntried twice and the really funny thing\nis that so that evening there's a book\nthat I have um which is a comment on\nthis text called the Shiva\nSutra okay and I I got this book back in\n2003 and it's been sitting on my shelf\nfor\nabout um yeah so 20 years like 21 years\nand so about 3 months ago I pulled it\noff the shelf because I Was preparing a\nlecture on something and I was like oh\nmaybe I'll like take a crack at this but\nI had six books that I was going to go\nthrough and I the first three or four\nbooks were sufficient to prepare the\nlecture so it was sitting on the shelf\nand then\nso you know our stream ended and that\nevening I was like okay so like let me\njust read this book because I've never\nactually like read it or I tried to read\nit and I it was too dense for me and\nit's really interesting because it\nactually talks a lot about what we were\ntalking about um and so I thought it was\nlike quite coincidental and then the\npart of my brain that looks at a cloud\nand sees a dog that that generates\npatterns out of Randomness made me\nreally wonder in like kind of like a\nspooky way I was like oh maybe like\nmaybe I was supposed to read this thing\nbefore I talk to you and\nso um maybe we can kind of I'll ask you\nkind of where we we left off and and\nwhat you remember but I hope that your\npower doesn't explode this time I don't\nthink it will so I think now that I have\nprepared by reading the Shiva Sutra and\nI've I've also like looked at a couple\nof I've got a couple research articles P\npulled\nup um uh so hopefully the we can kind of\npick up where we left off but also like\nif that doesn't you know if we kind of\nlost the threat of it so be it um but\ncan you just remind us and and help me\nremember kind of where we were in the\nconversation and and what we were about\nto embark on um we were talking about\nsomething I'm trying to remember the\nvery specific thing because it's it's\ntough for me when like a thread gets\nsevered like that to return to\nthat we were talking very about a very\nspecific\nthing okay\noh I can't remember here's what I\nremember sure so we were talking about\nthe the way that I recall the convers\nation is we had talked a lot about\ndifferent things that you were doing yes\nso you're working on the feret rescue um\nthere was some gaming thing I forget\nwhat it was uh game Jam g game jam and\nthen um you're you have a long-term goal\nof building a publishing house and a\nclinic and a clinic clinic for what uh\nexotic animals I'm going to build a\nVeterinary Clinic yeah so th those are\nthe things that you're working on and we\nwe had talked a lot about your kind of\nJourney and being homeless for year uh\nand I think in the past we had talked\nsome about um you were in a relationship\nthat that kind of uh you know y'all\nended up splitting up um and you kind of\ngrew a lot through this process we\ntalked a lot about your relationship\nwith your emotions how you utilize logic\num but then I had kind of tossed out\nthis sense that I had that you are not\noperating\nfrom a place of logic or emotion yes\nthat was the third the secret third\nthing the third thing not this not this\nyes and so as we try to understand what\nthat is like we we started to explore\nthat and I offered some some answers\nfrom a tradition so that doesn't make it\nright so this isn't science right this\nis just like some people sat down and\nlooked at this thing and examined it for\na while and then they came up with\nconclusions they didn't all come up with\nthe same conclusions but many of them\ncame up with the same\nconclusions and so uh I think I just\npulled out my pad and was sort of\nstarting to explain like what that thing\nis yeah um or at least one theory of\nwhat that thing is and then it detonated\nI think that's exactly what it was that\nwas the specific thing you're it's funny\nI couldn't remember it because it was\nthe it's nothing anyway yeah right so so\nit's it's nothing so um and then the\nother thing that I know we dm'd a little\nbit back and forth about uh you know\nrescheduling and stuff and then the\nother thing that you mentioned is that a\nlarge part of your community um is\nactually progressing very nicely from\nlike a professional standpoint right\nlike yeah I've got a ton of people that\nare messaging me tons and tons of people\naround the world that are like I I put\nthe things that you said to to action\nand I got an amazing job you know and it\nit just keeps happening over and over\nthere's like hundreds of people that are\nmessaging me reaching out on Twitter\nreaching out on DMS on Discord which I\ncan't answer all of them there's just so\nso many uh people sending emails and\npeople saying it in chat all the time\nit's actually really awesome frankly\nseeing that like those types of actions\ngoing to work and it's it's a lot of\nreally easy stuffff most of the time but\nit's things that people don't know when\nthey're first entering the workforce you\nknow like making a a resume and a cover\nletter they're one page long you know\nthe way that you handle yourself inside\nof an interview little tiny things like\nthat people just don't realize is like\nsuper important and um they just kind of\nend up sending out like hundreds and\nhundreds and hundreds of applications\nand then they change the stuff and\nthey're like I got to job two two\napplications later it's yeah way faster\nso that's that's awesome and I I think\nyou had mentioned to me uh in DMS that\nlike drive and burnout are major aspects\nthat y'all are kind of um dealing with\ncan you can you say a little bit more\nabout that like what are you what what\nare you seeing one some of the the\nlargest Trends in people asking me\nquestions usually around drive and\nburnout they're like I don't have drive\nyou know I don't have the drive to go\nand do something or I have pushed myself\ntoo hard and burning out or I I love\ndoing this thing so much that I don't\nwant to do it anymore you know they\ndon't realize that they're hitting that\nburnout threshold where they're pushing\nthemselves in a weird way or like the\nenvironment is bad for doing that work\nso then they don't want to do it or\nthey're doing it too many hours a day so\nor they're trying to a really common one\nis I want to quit my day job to go do my\nhobby full-time and a lot of times\npeople don't realize when you do that\nhobby full-time you now have added a ton\nof pressure to yourself of like I need\nto be financially viable doing this\nthing now and now you hate it right so\nlike there's all kinds of stuff like\nthat where it's it's little things like\nthat all the time and those are\ngenerally the things that I give advice\non and like how to fix this you know cuz\nit's super common crazy common yeah so\nso here's what I was what I'd kind of\nimagined for today and like this is like\nyou know welcome to modify disagree\ncompletely you know go off the rails um\nso what I was sort of thinking is that\nso I think these two things are related\nso the first is when we think a little\nbit about\num drive and\nburnout these both of these things are\nsignals from within\nus and if we understand alarm huh a lot\nof times it's an alarm it's like hey\nyou're doing something that you\nshouldn't be this feels bad and people\ndon't realize that that's an alarm Bell\ngoing off yeah yeah absolutely right so\nso\nso what I was kind of referring to is\nthat not even the quality of the signal\nthat it's an alarm but that this is\nsomething that comes from within so\ndrive and burnout are not necessarily\ncreated by the outside world they\ncreated by something within\nus and so I think that the really\ninteresting thing is that I'd love to\nhear what your advice is um for for\nthose kinds of cases and then I think\nthe other thing that we can do is try to\nbetter understand your experience of\nwhat drives you what protects you from\nburnout and then what I've kind of done\nis prepare a little bit about like my\nunderstanding of kind of this like\nEastern concept of the self which I\nthink is quite robust quite correct like\neven scientifically and then um I think\nthere's also a lot of like cool stuff in\nunderstanding drive and burnout from the\nNeuroscience research and specifically\nI'm not famili I'm not sure if you're\nfamiliar with the concept of hedonics\nversus\nudics I am not okay so we'll talk a\nlittle bit about that I'll kind of give\nyou kind of a quick tldr so if you look\nat human\nhappiness what we call happiness so\nhappiness is actually a lot of discreet\nthings so one kind of happiness and this\nis something that Aristotle actually I\nthink originally coined so he sort of\nnoticed that there's two kinds of like\nhappiness there's like fun and pleasure\nand then there's a sense of like\nwell-being and\nsatisfaction and what we tend to find is\nthat if you look at the Neuroscience of\nit this is an oversimplification but I\ntend to find that in a lot of my\npatients there's an inverse relationship\nbetween the neurotransmitters dopamine\nand serotonin so what we think of as\ndopamine is like the pleasure\nneurotransmitter so this is comes from\nthis part of brain called the nucleus\naccumbens so when we use opiates or we\nplay a video game we get a rush of\npleasure now what we sort of know this\nis to be disputed um and and probably\nactually what I'm about to say I'm\nleaning towards this actually being\nincorrect but it's a useful\nmodel is that when we look at people who\nare depressed there's this gets tied in\nsome way to their serotonin levels or\nthe levels of Serotonin transmission so\nthere's kind of this the prevailing\nTheory which is now being countered by\nuh some people like anyway we can go\ninto that that detail but that basically\nlike your sense of well-being is\ngoverned by like your serotonin so we\nknow that that's why we use ssris yes\nthat's one of the reasons we use ssris\nyes um and and so what we sort of find\nlike if I if you take someone who has an\naddiction for example like they actually\nget a fair amount of dopaminergic\ntransmission right so I'm playing video\ngames all day I'm using marijuana on a\ndaily basis but my sense of well being\nand happiness in life actually\ndeclines and what we often times find is\nthat people who are working hard and\neven denying themselves pleasure right\nso like when I'm driven towards I don't\nknow\nlike running a game Jam or something\nlike that that is not like a pleasurable\nactivity it's not fun I mean there may\nbe parts of it that are fun but there's\na large like effort investment but it\nincreases your sense of well-being so\nthere's this inverse relationship\nbetween dopamine and serotonin that once\nagain is really a neuroscientific\noversimplification that we can pick\napart very easily but I think it's\nuseful to think about we also know that\njust from observational studies and\nclinical experience and stuff like that\nthat these two principles can sometimes\nbe that we have good data about that if\nI chase a life of pleasure I will\nprobably be unhappy and that finding a\nlife of Happiness sometimes involves\navoiding pleasure so that there's good\ndata about but we don't quite know that\nthe Neuroscience lines up anyway so I I\nthink this is also really important\nbecause when we talk about drive and\nburnout I think that a huge part\nof what I found as a clinician we also\nhave like a Creator coaching program and\na career coaching program where we sort\nof use some of these principles of like\nself-fulfillment people have better\noutcomes and they have they reduce their\nunhealthy behaviors which are usually\ndope and energic in nature and often\ntimes what we will discover is that\ndrive and burnout\ncome from listening to a particular part\nof\nyourself that doesn't consider these\nkinds of things so like I want to become\nsomething I feel like I've fallen behind\nin life I need to prove something and as\na result like I'm going to push myself\npush myself push myself and I'll end up\nburning out even though I'm like moving\ntowards my goals so I don't know exactly\nhow we're going to do this I don't know\nif it's going to happen but like what I\nwas sort of thinking about is we could\nunderstand your experience of this third\nthing and teach people potentially how\nto operate from that space more because\nI get the sense that you work very hard\nyou are driven and you don't burn out\nand then we can also lean into your\npersonal advice and your personal\nexperience of like how you've created\nthat and I am very confident that\nwhatever answers you have I will be able\nto provide a framework or research\nsupport for whatever you do makes sense\nyeah makes complete sense I think I\nthink the biggest thing for me is yeah\nyou're right I don't burn out like uh\npeople laugh about it all the time\nthey're like oh he's going to burn out\nhe's going to do this because I I work\n16 to 19 hours a day I sleep five hours\na day I work all day do all that kind of\nstuff but the thing that I found that\nstarted that chain to make that possible\nI can see the impact of my work one of\nthe things that I find a lot of the\ntimes is when someone's in a workplace\nand they feel really bad about going to\nwork sometimes it's the working\nenvironment sometimes the people they\nwork with but very often I found they\ndon't see why their job matters they\ndon't see what their job does and you'll\nsee this quite a lot for a lot of weird\nkind of areas or maybe they look down on\nthe impact of the work let's say you\nwork at fast food and you think your\nfast food job is worthless because you\nwork at fast food right you work in\nMcDonald's or something like that some\npeople can see like hey working at\nMcDonald's is actually a really positive\nthing because I'm feeding people and\nthat gets them through the day and then\nthey feel better about the job some\npeople just go I just work at fast food\nthis a dead and they feel like garbage\nabout it right so like I think impact is\na really big starting point if that\nmakes sense and that's usually the first\nthing I look for is like do you see the\nimpact of your work okay most of the\ntime those the people who have burnt out\ncompletely are like no I don't see the\nimpact of my work at all I'm like okay\nnow we can work on that piece what I'm\ngoing to do Thor is I'm going to take\nnotes okay okay and we're going to start\nso I'm going to just so so burnout\ncorrelates with lack of impact that's\none yeah I think that's an aspect of it\nand then and and and your case the way\nthat\nThor avoids\nburnout mhm is by seeing the impact yes\nokay great seeing impact is huge that's\nactually one of the reasons I look into\nanalytics for stuff it's it is something\nthat gets beyond the idea of having\nimpostor syndrome right the the little\nvoice in the back of your head that\ntells you hey you know you shouldn't be\ndoing that or you're not good enough or\nany of I see that kind of as a defense\nmechanism that's over overachieving\nright it's sitting there telling you\nlike you shouldn't do this because if\nyou do it you'll fail and if you fail\nthen we'll feel bad so don't do that\nright but in reality you should do that\nthing you should try that thing and see\nif it works so I I'll usually tell\npeople like hey if you're getting that\noverwhelming you and it's stopping you\nfrom doing things in the first place it\ngives you that failure to start make a\nbet with it say I'm going to do this for\nthree months I'm going to wait and see\nand then we're going to go back and\nreview everything and see if I did\nbetter than when I first started and if\nI did then the imposter syndrome wrong\nbecause I look at my analytics all the\ntime because I see every all the\nfeedback that people are giving all the\nthings that people say how they see that\nyou know how they say the advice is\nactually helping them through things I\ndon't have to deal with that because I\ncan see the impact and that's immediate\nevidence to say like imposter syndrome\nsit in the corner right because I have\nevidence that it's not correct so that\ngoes away that's the second layer of\nthat you've got the impact for your work\nand then you've also got imposter\nsyndrome being you know pushed to the\nside for that okay um trying to think\nsome other\nthings uh another one is environment for\nme I create zones so I have a zone for\nactually doing work I have a zone for\nwhen I want to rest I have a zone for\nwhen I want to do entertainment I these\nare physical areas of my space right um\nand I've talked to people in the past\nthey're like well I don't have any areas\nI was like do you got a couch they're\nlike yeah I was like do you got a laptop\nthey're like yeah I do stuff on a laptop\nit's like okay when you're playing game\nsit on the left side of the couch when\nyou're working on something sit on the\nright side of the couch the reason that\nI learned that is because I was trying\nto do everything from a laptop in bed\nand what I found was when I was working\non things I wanted to go to sleep and\nwhen I wanted to go to sleep I couldn't\nstop thinking about work and it it\ncreated this like weird mixed thing for\nme I don't know if that's the same for\neveryone but for me environmental mixing\nwas a problem and I had to separate\nenvironmental areas to make sure that I\nwas focused on the task for that area if\nthat makes sense so Thor when you see\nanalytics that are not going well what\nhappens within\nyou I want to know why I'm not upset I\njust want to know why like and I I try\nto form a number of different\npossibilities for that things that could\nbe the solution to that and then I try\nto isolate those in a way where it is\npossible for me to test it so okay I'm\ngoing to jump in for a second sure so um\nwhy don't you feel\nbad because it's a chance to learn\nsomething and then and then I can use\nthat for every other situation if I if I\ncan solve why that thing went wrong and\nthen use it to my advantage use you know\nthe information from that to my\nadvantage I can win not only that\nsituation but many others that come Bey\non it\nokay all right cool is it okay if I\ninterrupt you yeah go for it okay so\nwe're going to map this out and we're\ngoing to we're going to try to like\nwe're going to do everything that you're\nalready doing we're just going to\nprovide some support for it okay so um\nyou mentioned environment okay\nuh what drives\nyou a lot of different things it really\ndepends on the situation though I think\ndifferent situations have different\ndriving factors if that makes sense yeah\nso it's not always the same I think\nthere is probably the greatest drive for\nme is as we were talking about puzzle\ngames earlier the drive to solve is a\npretty big one for me I love to solve\nthings and the reason why is because\nit's like oh I don't know that thing let\nme see if I can learn something from\nthis because I found that there's so\nmuch kind of like cross-pollination\nbetween things that you learn and you\ncan apply those skills anywhere else in\nyour life and it it makes me more\nadaptive I\nfind\nokay uh all right so now we get a little\nbit um potentially into the weirder area\nso we had talked\nabout uh so here's Thor\nand Thor has logic Thor has emotion Thor\nhas maybe something called\npersonality maybe right so no one's\nproven that yet puzzle\nsolver right so empty husk with a nice\nhead of hair there we go and then\nthere's this this like third\nthing the secret third thing the secret\nthird thing right and and I get the\nsense that a lot of your drive so here's\nwhat I think the order of operation is\nhere's you the third\nthing\nstarts and then what happens is it sends\nsignals to your logical mind and it\nsends signals to your emotional mind and\nthen what these things do is they\nstructure your activity so these will\ngive this thing which is formless they\nwill give it some kind of\nshape and then this shape is very\ndependent on you like like someone El\nlike someone else may have this drive\nbut based on your desire to solve\npuzzles based on The Logical conclusions\nbased on certain values that you hold it\ngives this thing a particular\nmanifestation that suits you and since\nthis thing is suiting you this leads to\nsuccess and the more things that I learn\nthe more ways I can make that happen in\ndifferent scenarios sure so so then what\nhappens is that they\nthey're yeah so so the the more that\nthese things get enhanced I'm going to\ncall\nlearning I'm going to say that learning\nis over here right so so then what\nhappens is if you get this kind of\nimpulse and your logic is insufficient\nthen you can't give this thing shape but\nas your logic improves as your emotions\nimprove this thing starts to take shape\nas we're leveling this up leveling this\nup getting rid of I think the big thing\nfor me though is when I see that when I\nfind one of those scenarios where it's\nlike I don't know enough to do this I\nwant to it's like oh this is great\nthat's another thing to add to the\nBatman belt right that's kind of the the\nway that it feels to me each time I I am\npresented with one of those and it's\nfunny that all of you guys in chat you\nsaw me do this all day you've seen me do\nthis for the last like three days in\nanimal well every time it's like oh I\ndon't know what this is I'm gonna do\nthis it's not even haes not knowing\nthings it's that I know that at the\nother side of that when I finish knowing\nthe thing I'm going to have new ideas\nthat I can apply to other situations so\nlike solving all those puzzles in animal\nwell I'm going to go make some really\ncool ARG stuff I can make that for\nheartbound I can make that for the\nhackmud stuff that I'm doing anything\nelse I can apply that all over the place\nand I can solve other puzzles in the\nfuture yeah so Thor was there a time\nwhere you weren't like\nthat\nH I don't think there was a time where I\nwasn't like that I think there was a\ntime when I wasn't that good at it it's\nlike a it's like a snowball it's like an\navalanche right okay so like there was a\ntime where it was like God I don't know\nanything I'm just pissed all the time\nand it was like once I started to get a\ncouple of of footholds on that was like\nwait I know how to do this wait I can\napply it this way wait can I try this\nthis way then it was like well I know\nhow to solve a lot of things but I don't\nknow how to talk to people and I'm not\ngood at that you know how what what do\nyou do when you feel a negative emotion\nso you said you used to be pissed what\nhappens to that\nemotion I think when I was younger it\nwas a lot harder to manage because\nemotions kind of came out of nowhere and\nit was like really really kind of rough\nyou know CU I think growing up and I'm\nsure a lot of people can can understand\nthis growing up there was like don't be\nover emotional you know be you're a guy\nyou know suppress that sort of a thing\nso for me when I was younger it was a\nlot of that it was a lot of like be a\nmanly man don't don't do that don't show\nthat off\nand then as I got older I was like no it\njust makes sense to do that it's fine\nand I kind of evolved out of that if\nthat makes sense so I think that made it\nmore difficult to handle that side of\nthings in the early days but over time I\nrealized that was okay and made how did\nyou evolve out of it do you\nknow it's it's funny because it keeps\ngoing back to that that sort of\ninflection point of homeless for a year\nright I think it was it was like the\nmost devastating thing that could happen\nand it was a hard reset for me frankly\nokay if that makes sense yeah yeah so uh\nwho did you think you were before you\nwere\nhomeless I had a\nvery kind of Grand Vision of myself way\ngrandiose way way Larger than Life\nfrankly in an absurdest sort of way I\nthought it was top of the world I\nthought it was I was Kick-Ass all the\ntime and um\nit humbled the out of me frankly\nit's the best way to put that okay yeah\nokay great so do you have any questions\nfor me so far no I think this is cool so\nfar okay so now it's interesting to see\nlike my whole mental process yeah so I I\nI think what we're going to do is like\nwe're gonna what we're going to do is\nuse you as a test case to generalize\ncertain principles of the mental process\nand we're going to see if we can figure\nout the code that results in some kind\nof like outcome right so like if I'm if\nI'm like typing hello world or whatever\nthere's something I can type and we can\nget a particular outcome so tell me I do\nyeah oh go ahead I I was going to say I\ndo think it was not just that moment\nthough it's every time I failed ever as\nwell every time I ever experienced\nfailure in the ideas that I had it\nshowed me there's something more to\nlearn and then eventually it's like you\ndon't know anything you just know the\nthat you already know and you can use\nthose to adapt yourself to different\nsituations and become better at\nDiscerning things and better at at\nevolving through that okay my whole\nthing was like train yourself to adapt\nno matter what okay and failure is great\nbecause it gives you another chance to\nlearn a new adaptation okay so I'm going\nto point something out to you\nsure um when some people fail they say I\nam bad Absol you fail what do you say\nI say oo piece of candy you know it's\nlike it's an opportunity for me\nopportunity for what to learn there an\nopp opportunity to get better okay so\nwe're gonna I'm going to just keep track\nof this okay we'll see if we can sus out\nwhat the big difference is um\nso actually maybe we can do it now what\ndo you think is the object of this\nthought\nobject meaning can you\ndefine yeah so where is my in what D\nit's going to be hard to but I'll I'll\nkeep trying and then you can puzzle\nsolve your way to the answer um what am\nwhat is my mind looking\nat when I have this thought\nshortterm I I generally think that that\nis a a very short-term sort of feeling\nit is I failed here which means I am a\nfailure rather than I failed here but\nlook at all the things that I've\novercome my life I don't remember all\nthe really difficult things that I've\ngotten through to get to this point I\nsurvived to here so it's it's a\nshort-term like this happen so I suck\nit's like no all the other stuff that\nyou learned you you you rock actually\nthe fact that you are here that you've\nmade it this far means you've succeeded\nokay so I'm I'm going to translate that\ninto certain terminology so I'm going to\nsay that you when you say like okay\npeople only see this this one thing\nright so they don't they kind of don't\ntake the big picture\nlike they don't think about all the\nthings that they've done I'm going to\ncall that zoomed in okay so this thought\nis zoomed in this thought is short\nterm yep um I'm going to go ahead and\nsay that the object of this thought is\nyour identity so I thinking about\nme that makes sense okay yeah yeah\nyou're thinking about yourself rather\nthan the situation yes I could see that\nso when when you have this thought what\nis the object\nwhat am I looking\nat the problem itself for me okay gu so\nthe problem and the future rather than\nthe present it is I'm focusing on the\ngoal which is when the problem is\nalready solved okay it is a more of a\nlong-term thing as well because it's\nlike ah this is an opportunity for\ngrowth it may be difficult to get\nthrough this but at the end of this I'm\ngoing to be way I'm going to be way more\nsuited to solving stuff like this you\nknow whatever it's going to be and I I\nthink I learned a lot of from being a\nprogrammer as funny as that is because\nprogramming is 99% fixing your own bugs\nfrankly like you are constantly making\nassumptions trying something seeing that\nit fails trying to find out why it\nfailed getting better at that thing and\nthen you can see the progress as your\ncode stops failing as much or it starts\nto fail in new and more fantastic ways\nfrankly yeah no I I I think it it's so\ninteresting because once again I'm like\nreminded of this analogy when you kind\nof say like you know 99% of it is\nsolving your own bugs like I think\nthat's what growth is too so personal\ngrowth whether it's through um you know\nkind of the yogic path or the\nPsychotherapy path I think that there's\nlike there's overlap there um yeah and\nand a lot of it is basically I I think a\nlot of people really don't realize\nthat that actually they control so much\nand do and and even if we look at the\nway that you respond to failure right so\nlike what I've sort of noticed is that\nthere's\nso there are two types of people in the\nworld those who what doesn't kill you\nmakes you stronger and those who what\ndoesn't kill you cripples you for life\nso this is the sad truth is that a lot\nof people say oh what doesn't kill you\nonly makes you stronger that's not\ntrue what doesn't kill you can just\n you for life as well that's one\nof the reasons why I try to give people\nthat feedback of like you need to find\nthe impact in your work because I found\nfor me that was my first foothold\nthat was the first like wait I'm not\nterrible I'm not I have evidence\nnow it's like a finding a sword right\nbecause you can finally fight back at\nthat point you're like I have I have\nevidence that I'm doing something that\nmatters and that's when you have nothing\nthat's a really empowering thing yeah so\nI think that there there are things that\nmake it difficult for people to do that\noh definitely I I do think it's\nincredibly hard especially when you\ndon't have anything to start off with\nyeah well think a lot of people have\nsomething I think they have difficulty\nseeing that they have something I agree\nwith that yeah do makes it hard for them\nto see that they have\nsomething I think a lot of times it's\neasy to kind of fall into that path of\nof seeing all the negative patterns\nseeing that path of I failed here I\nfailed there I failed this I failed that\nand not being able to see the positive\nthings I'm interested in what leads\nsomeone down that sort of path because I\ndon't it's it's quite interesting\nbecause it's exactly the same path but\nin Reverse it's the same so I can focus\non all of the successes that I have all\nthe things that I can do all the things\nthat I've learned from those failures or\nI can focus on all the times that I\nfailed and keep that as the focal point\nthe interesting part to me is what leads\nsomeone down one of those paths ver the\nother one let's talk about what does\nthat yeah\nso um what what do you understand about\nthis third thing the NY NY thing like\ncan you toss out anything so like I I\nused the word calling and I think that\nwas the term that kind of resonated with\nyou it is yeah 100% like how do you\nunderstand like what is that where does\nthat come from just give me anything\nthat you've got about it and if you've\ngot nothing that's totally fine too I\ndon't even think it's nothing it's\nthere's a moment that I have\nwhere it's it's funny some people talk\nabout it like Intuition or or you know\ngut instinct or anything like that\nwhatever it's going to be but it really\ncomes down to I'm in a scenario and I go\nthis is the right way to handle this and\nthen I go how do I logically handle this\nhow do I emotionally handle this can I\ndo that is it within my ability to do so\nhow is that going to affect everyone\naround me does everyone win when we do\nthis and it starts cascading down all\nthe possibilities of the different\nroutes of ways that this could be\nhandled pieces that I could touch how\nthe puzzle gets solved where does all\nthe puzzle where do all the puzzle\npieces lay and does it hurt anyone along\non the way okay that's the biggest one\nso here's what I want to point out to\nyou but that first piece is just yeah so\nso the right answer precedes the logic\nyes that is correct how how does that\nwork I don't know okay yeah I got\nnothing on that one so this if if people\nwant to understand why they are burnt\nout if you can understand this that the\nright answer comes\nfirst then all kinds of problems will be\nsolved so let's like talk about a couple\nof different problems that arise from\nnot knowing what the right answer is so\nthe first simplest example is like want\nversus should right so like let's say\nyou've got someone who's like okay like\nI'm unhappy in my career and or I'm\nunhappy I'm unhappy with something I\ndon't doesn't matter what relationship\ncareer job whatever and then what\nhappens is that logic and emotion enter\nthe picture there's no north star to\nbegin with and then logic and emotion\nfight okay so emotion says I want to do\nthis I don't want to work I don't want\nto do this I want to play video games\nand then logic says but I should play\nvideo games and then there's internal\nconflict and then we get to this really\ninteresting principle of ambivalence so\nhuman beings are conflicted in their\nnature or not actually in their nature\nbut in the psychology of understanding\nhuman behavioral\nchange this is what we've sort of\nfigured out human beings are ambivalent\nso right now I have you know I have like\na plus minus over here and I have a\ndifferent plus minus over here so this\nmay sound kind of weird but I'll explain\nso like if I move you know so anytime I\nhave a conflict there are benefits of\ndoing what I want and there are costs of\ndoing what I want and there benefits of\ndoing what I should do and there are\ncosts of doing what I should do so we\nstart in the middle and the interesting\nthing is as you move in One Direction\nthis becomes small and the costs start\nincreasing\nit doesn't matter which direction you\nmove in anytime you move towards an\naction this is what the science of\nambivalence tells us let's say like I\nthink about going do I want to play a\nvideo game or do I want to go to the gym\nand if I go to the gym like what happens\nis the thought of going to the gym and\nthe experience of going to the gym are\ndifferent when I'm thinking about going\nto the gym or I'm thinking about eating\na salad once I sit down to eat the salad\nI have to eat the salad so the actual\nit's like I'd love to be healthy but now\nnow I got to eat salad you got to go and\nactually do the action yeah so so so\nthis is what's really interesting is\nthat if you look at it like as we move\ntowards something the costs start\nincreasing our brain starts to\nexperience there's a hypothetical cost\nof going to the gym sure but once I'm\nactually there and like I'm feeling\nintimidated by people and I'm feeling\nlike all these people are in shape and\nthey're judging me and all that kind of\nstuff the cost actually increases so\nthen what happens is as the cost\nincreases the grass is greener on the\nother side right this also explains this\nvery simple principle of why the grass\nis greener on the other side then people\nend up moving over here and as they move\nover here oh now I moved a little bit\nover here and it turns out that the\ngrass is not greener on the other side\nI'm I'm breaking up with a mistake let\nme see if they'll take me back and then\npeople sort of end up stuck just kind of\nyeah so this is what's what's super\nsuper crazy is that operating from\nemotion and logic which is what a lot of\npeople try to do doesn't work very well\nwhat actually works incredibly well well\nis figuring out what your North Star is\nand logic and emotion are not\ndeterminants of your behavior they are\ntools to actualize whatever your compass\nis this is what we see in you that ends\nup being a strong sense of self okay but\nwhy where does let's talk about that\nwhat do you mean by strong sense of self\ngreat because the only way you can find\nthat North Star at that point is that\nmeans a strong sense of self that\nsays regardless of the logical of the\nsituation regardless of the emotion of\nthe situation this is the thing that I\nthink is is correct so from there how do\nwe logically handle this and how do we\nemotionally handle this to make sure\nthat that becomes the end goal like\nbecomes the outcome right and that just\nends up being a really yeah it's a it's\na strong sense of self which is funny\nbecause most people on the internet just\ngo based right but like that's that's\nwhat it sounds like to me is what we're\ndescribing here yes so here's the first\nprinciple to understand and there's a\nbig problem that we see in our society\nright now logic and emotions are tools\nthey're they're to be utilized by the\nself they should not run your life and\nwhat we tend to find is people who are\noverly logical first of all there's all\nkinds of problems with that people think\nthey don't realize that there's problems\nbut so the first thing is like logic uh\nthe the more logical you are the more\nprone you are to things like\ndepression um\nand when your emotions run the show I\nthink we can all agree that that's like\nnot a good plan and the basic problem\nwith logic is that logic is not really\nlogical like so in the human brain when\nyou take this abstract principle of\nlogic and you apply it to the human\nbrain you're going to have all kinds of\nselection\nbiases right so I don't have space so\nwhen people say that they do have space\nbut their brain isn't their logic is not\nable to see that because there is\nsomething within your mind that is\nobscuring information from your logical\napparatus makes sense actually that kind\nof reminds me have you played oh God\nwhat is that game I'm gonna look this up\nwhile you're talking okay yeah I want to\nshow you this anyway keep going okay\ndisco elicium there we go thank you I\nplayed a little bit of disco elisium\nabsolutely loved it so I thought disco\nelisium actually ties into this quite\nwell because in Disco elisium you have\ntraits to your character and those\ntraits turn into\nintrusive thoughts but the intrusive\nthoughts are based on those statistics\nso if you have encyclopedic knowledge\nbecause your intelligence is very high\nyou may be able to recollect things like\nyou remember things when you're talking\nto people about different stuff in the\nworld but also it may cut in and be like\nyou shouldn't listen to that person they\ndon't know anything they're an idiot and\nit's it's very interesting because\nthat's exactly what it is is you're\nseeing the logical side do something\nthat isn't logical and kind of push them\naway from that scenario it's quite odd I\nI I remember just one really interesting\nthing about the game so I was playing\nthe game and in the game there's someone\nwho talks about a preon disease and\nfamilial fatal insomnia so they're like\nthey don't name the things but I was\nreading this and I was like you know\nthis is really interesting because this\nsounds like familial fatal insomnia\nwhich is a really re really like rare\ncase it's like a very rare disease and\nit is it is familial fatal insomnia\nwhich is exactly what it it sounds like\nit's an inherited condition where you\nlose the capacity to sleep and you go\ncrazy and then you die and um one of the\nnice things about training at at some of\nthese like some of these institutions so\nI I trained at a a very famous hospital\nand the cool thing about training at a\nfamous hospital is like you get people\nlike there's like maybe five cases of\nthis a year across the globe and so like\npeople will fly to like you know very\nspecialized hospitals to get this kind\nof care for these diseases which is\nwhich is really bad really scary thing\nvery exceedingly rare so you don't need\nto worry about it for each one of them\nmaybe you get closer to fixing it you\nknow maybe yeah maybe closer to a solve\nyeah okay so disco leum is absolutely\nfull of this kind of stuff yeah so let's\nlet's go back to this so now I'm going\nto ask you a question Thor so you said\nit comes from the self so basically what\nwe're going to help people do is\nunderstand what you've managed to do so\nthat you can operate from that place the\nother really interesting thing is that I\ndon't know if this kind of makes sense\nbut when you're operating from the\nself you can know that this is logically\na bad idea you can know that this is\nemotionally not a good thing and then\nyou can still do it does that I can find\na way to make it work exactly that's the\nbig one right so so so this is the cool\nthing is that normally what happens is\nwe are bound by our logic and our\nemotions our ability our capacity for\nself-determination can be restricted by\nLogic so my mind is telling me this is a\nbad idea like I do this stuff all the\ntime I I and it's kind of weird but\nsomeone asked me recently like what is\nsomething that I wish I knew when I was\n30 and my answer was was to walk away\nfrom good things that like some of the\nbest things some of the best decisions\nin my life are to walk away from quote\nunquote objectively good\nopportunities and and so we have this\nidea when we're 30 that you know we have\nto like we're still following the script\nof the world and we don't realize that\nthe script of the world doesn't\ntranslate over into us and that like\nsome of the best decisions I made are to\nlike walk away from like objectively\ngreat\nopportunities interesting um and so\nlogically it doesn't sound it's stupid\nbut you do it anyway and then it turns\nout it works great because maybe then\nyou're in alignment with the universe or\nwhatever the anyway so I think the\ninteresting part about that is if you're\ndoing that you're choosing to have more\nhardship which means you're choosing to\nhave more scenarios in which you can\nadapt and learn to adapt better which is\ngoing to make longterm it to make it\neasier frankly uh theoretically yes that\nthat is one way to look at it but the\nthe other way to look at it is if you\nget an amazing job job job\nopportunity from a great institution\ngenerally speaking people will say sure\nyou may not I mean you can adapt there\ntoo but I think that like there's\ncertain things that are viewed as right\nanswers in life which I I don't think is\nthe case and that's the whole point but\nmakes sense what I'm kind of going to\nzero in on and tunnel down on is like if\nyou're someone who is struggling in life\nwith burnout or\ndrive you cannot come up with an answer\nfrom logic or emotion or if you come up\nwith that answer from logic or emotion\nif you start to implement it it is going\nto the experience is going to be like\nthis which is not unsolvable you can get\nthrough that but generally speaking\nlogic and emotion are not great places\nto operate from that's my belief that's\na that's a statement of belief I'm\nmaking it's funny I was actually just\nthinking about it there's people that um\neveryone all get a question like this\nwhere they're like I should I have this\njob or should I take this job and I'm\nlike which job do you want to take and\nthe moment you ask somebody that they\nsit there and they go you know I never\nasked that of\nmyself yeah absolutely right so so\nthey're they're operating from a place\nof logic or emotion instead of operating\nfrom a place of self now I've got a\nquestion for you so you said this comes\nfrom you yeah\num now you mentioned that you had a\ngrandiose version of yourself in your\nmind what is the relationship between\nthe\ngrandiose version\nand\nself in your o I think\nthe answer you come up with okay don't\nI'm just C I think the grandio version\nof myself when I was younger the the the\nFatal flaw that I had with that was I\ncan do anything and it doesn't matter I\ncan do anything at all and it it\nwouldn't matter I don't need to think\nabout it I can just do it who cares\nright and that was that doesn't make any\ndamn sense because when I did that I\ndidn't know why I succeeded I didn't\nknow why I failed and I didn't care and\nI learned nothing from it frankly and I\nI found that to\nbe it's it's kind of like gambling\nfrankly you're just gambling the whole\ntime and you're not learning anything\nfrom it so you don't get any long-term\nbenefits from that you just get kind of\nthe luck of the draw frankly because\nyou're just throwing things at the wall\nand you're not even seeing what sticks\nyou're just throwing things\nconstantly okay that's very useful we're\ngoing to tie that into something in a\nsecond\nbut when you say version of yourself I'm\ncurious what is the so like you have\nthis voice inside you right that says\nthis is\nright and then by the way can you see\nwhat I'm screen sharing with you yes I\ncan I can see um and what is the\nrelationship right so like I I'm and I\ncan come up with I can keep on using\nlanguage and framing this cuz what I'm\nasking is kind of confusing what is the\nrelationship between like what is that\nwhat is the iOS version of the self and\nand this is right like this is Right\ncomes from the self and then you have\nthe grandio version of the self are\nthese the same thing or these different\nthings like what how do you understand\nthis and if you don't that's perfectly\nfine because I'll offer a hypothesis I\nwould say those are different things\nokay and I think that there's a a little\nbit of a little bit of that in there\nthere has to be you have to be strong\nenough to say this is right regardless\nof of any other pieces that may come\nafter that like logic and emotion\ntelling you no this isn't right this\nisn't right right it's it's the driving\nforce it's the one that says this is\nwhat we're doing let's use everything\nelse as a tool set to make sure that\nthat happens so there is a little bit of\nlike kind of domineering aspect to that\nright okay but it's not I guess the best\nthing to say there is it it got tempered\nso before I went homeless it was just\nlike yeah we're just going to do it who\ncares about the cons squats who cares\nabout how it affects anybody else who\ncares how it affects me later it's going\nto work right now so who cares right\nand that changed completely now it's\nlike okay we're going to do this how do\nwe do it in the right way that was the\nbig shift between those two things how\ndo we do it the way that actually\nbenefits the most for everybody okay\nthat was the difference so now I'm going\nto offer a couple things the first thing\nis I want you to\nnotice this\nstatement\nand this\nstatement what do you notice about these\ntwo statements they're pretty polar\nopposite that's what that's abs\nabsolutely true and I would say that\nthey are very similar because what is\nthe object of this statement it's I yeah\nright so this is where a lot of people\nget mixed up we look at this and we see\nthat this is at the\nend and this is at the end and these two\nthings are\nopposites and if this one is bad then\nthis one must be good but it turns out\nthat the yogis would say no no no no no\nno no these both of these statements are\nequally bad yep so now we get to the\ntrue nature of\nself so deep within you you have Tua the\nself the Atman the soul I don't know\nwhat this is right so this is ntin you\nhave a voice within you some people call\nit\nDivinity yep it's described as kind of a\nDivine Force things like that yeah and\nand there is some transcendental quality\nnow if we want to take a biological\nreductionist perspective we say nothing\nlike this exists and this is simply\nsubconscious processing or unconscious\nprocessing you could say that\nyeah okay I personally don't believe\nthat but that that I think is a very\nscientifically valid argument because\nnot only does this thing have no words\nthat can describe it it has no capacity\nto be\nmeasured makes sense okay yeah science\nwill never detect this in my op for me I\ndon't have an answer there and I think\nnot having an answer is okay yeah that\nmakes sense so and then you can you can\nmake an argument that it sort of doesn't\nmatter but we'll we'll get we'll get to\nthis a little bit I think it matters\ngreatly I just don't have an answer I\nthink it does I think it does too so\nthen what happens is we have this thing\ncalled the\naamar or the\nego now this is where these statements\ncome in I can do anything I am bad and\nif I if we ask you Thor how did you\nbecome the person that you say today you\ncite one inflection point which is a\npoint of basically abandoning your ego\nright so you even use the word humbling\nincredibly humbling so prior to this you\nhad a very very powerful ego and then\nThe Humbling same thing with me by the\nway so I was like Premed and I was going\nto become you know I was going to go to\nHarvard and I was going to be one of the\nbest doctors on the planet and all this\nkind of and then like I had a very\nvery humbling experience over the course\nof years and years and years got rid of\nmy ego and the big irony is I wound up\ntraining there anyway but like I didn't\nyou know it wasn't a goal for me then it\nwas just it felt right um yeah so now\nhere's the a lot of very important\nthings to understand right so now that\nwe've entered into the ego now a couple\nof things happen if the ego controls\nyour logic and manages your emotions\nthen these tools will result in like\ndifferent kinds of problems this is also\nwhere we see the seed of burnout and\ndrive so if your drive comes from here\nso if your drive comes from here okay\nlet me think about how to draw\nthis so let's say\nthat so let's say here is the dimension\nof\ndrive if your drive comes from here\nlogic and emotion\nokay what that means is that your drive\nwill be\nconflicted because as the logic changes\nas your emotional state changes the\ndrive will Whiffle waffle this is what\nends up with people not truly being\nstuck so very few people are stuck in\nlife usually what happens with people is\nthey're more like pendulums where they\nmove two steps forward two steps back\ntwo steps forward two there's a lot of\nactivity which is why they're so\nexhausted all the time because they're\nactually moving a lot there's a lot of\nenergy being expended but the energy is\njust getting getting dissipated in two\nopposite directions yeah they're just it\nlooks like they're standing still but\nthey're actually working twice as hard\nas everybody else absolutely well said\nyep so if your drive comes from a hump\nGod or ego this can lead to a lot of\naccomplishment but it will often times\nlead to\nunhappiness uh a sense of\nfragility a lack of\ncontentment so this is what I see with a\nlot of people who have things like\nimpostor syndrome or people who are in\nbanking and they have this idea I want\nto be something one\nday so I want to be successful I want to\nbe respected I want to be sexy I want to\ndo this I I I I I I I and that can that\nused to be me it used to be me too yeah\nso that can drive us very effectively so\nwe'll see a lot of very success I'm not\ngoing to name names but I think you can\nlook at like the internet and Twitter\nand you can see a a lot of people who\nhave a lot of objective measures of\nsuccess but if you just pay attention to\nthem they don't seem happy because\nthey're getting upset about stuff\nthey're getting into fights with like\npeople like you know they just don't\nseem content like someone who's content\nfighting on social media all the time\nyeah right so the the there are people\nwho can let negativity like kind of\nSlough off them like a roof with rain\nlike it just you know it falls on you\nand it kind of sloughs off and then\nthere are people who like really despite\nthe fact that they're very successful\nthey they don't appear to be content and\nthat's because ego can absolutely drive\nus and can lead to good outcomes and\nthis is where a lot of people get\nconfused because they want those things\nthe problem is that when we are\noperating from ego and when we're driven\nby\nego we this controls the ego controls\nthe emotion and the logic so we end up\ndoing things that are not good for us\nand end up leading to burnout so for\nexample let's say I'm at a let's say I'm\na programmer so we had a great interview\na couple maybe about a year and a half\nago with someone who was like dealing\nwith a lot of burnout and and this\nprogrammer was very successful and what\nwould happen is like they would they\nwould go home on the weekend like if\nthere was some problem that needed to be\nsolved they literally this is what they\nwould describe so they go home on Friday\nand then they would work on the problem\nall weekend long there's a team of\ndevelopers and then they come in on\nMonday morning with the solution so\ninstead of getting a weekend they do the\nwhole team's work over the course of the\nweekend and then they come in burnt out\non the weekend but man everyone is like\nholy crap this is great like thank you\nfor solving this problem and they feel\nso good from that positive enforcement\nthey have this desire to be and what we\nsort of discovered with them is they\nhave the desire to be the hero like I\nwant to be the hero it feels good to be\nthe hero but the hero is an aspect of my\nego\nso what happens when I when I operate\nfrom ego I want to be something is it\ncauses us to make generally speaking\nunhealthy trades so we value something\nso much and we're willing to sacrifice I\ndon't want to disappoint my boss I want\nmy boss to love me I want my boss to\nrespect me so I'm never going to say set\na boundary with them yeah that makes\nsense okay so this is I think I think a\nlot of the times that that's kind of\ninteresting because I think a lot of the\ntimes that's the same sort of traits\nwhere it stops you from wanting to do\nthings like take break when you really\nneed to or be able to go on vacation\nlike one of the things I learned pretty\nearly is I do work a lot I really enjoy\nworking but when I need a break I listen\nto myself and I'm like I'm not going to\nstream today today I'm going to take a\nchill I'm GNA walk away for a minute\nbecause you need to do that everybody no\nno matter how driven you are you have to\ndo that absolutely right so I think what\nwhat happens with the ego is since it it\nalmost shapes or even suppresses logic\nand emotion it leads to a very selective\nlogic right so then the the logical part\nof you that's like hey sometimes like\nyou're human and you need a break that\ngets suppressed so what happens is a lot\nof people will cultivate this and I see\nthis a lot like on social media in terms\nof\num like you know this hustle culture and\nstuff like that that like sacrifice\nsacrifice sacrifices to be laed all of\nthese people are operating from ego and\nyou can lead it can result in a lot of\npositive outcomes like materialistic\noutcomes absolutely but it also leads to\na lot of unhappiness and burnout and all\nkinds of like other negativity I I had\nthat actually so when I used to work for\nthe doe right because I worked for the\nDepartment of energy I made an insane\namount of money right because I was\nworking for the federal government\nhacking power plants right crazy well\nwell-paid job but I was flying around\nthe country 10 weeks AG I wasn't home\nand they wanted to change that to 30\nweeks a year and I realized like there's\nI could sacrifice everything I could\njust have no home life I could just\nnever be at my house I could just not\nhave any friends none of this and I\ncould make a ton of money doing it but\nat a certain point it was like that's\nnot worth it it's absolutely not worth\nit you I think there's there might be a\ntime and a place for that to put\nyourself in an advantageous situation\ndown the line if it's\nshort but you know but not a permanent\nsolution like that not something that\nlasts a super long period of time I can\nunderstand the idea of grinding for a\nlittle bit so that you can have yourself\nin a better situation but that stuff\nlike that can absolutely take over at\nleast I felt Absol draw for that and I\nwas like no I'm not doing it and so the\nthe challenge uh Thor is that if people\nare if ego is where they're coming from\nthey can't draw those limits okay\nbecause if I if I don't work 30 weeks\nthen in my mind I become something else\nand I don't want to be that thing and\nthe avoidance of that kind of thing like\nI want to be the hardest one worker\nbecause the hardest worker means I'm the\nbest which means that if someone else\nand this is the all kinds of problems\ncome with ego one is that uh comparison\nreally sets in so ego by by its nature\nexists to compare it's one of the\nfundamental things so like if I if I\nhave an identity of I'm the best what\nthat means is that like if that's my\nidentity and someone shows up who's\nbetter than me then I can't let them do\nthat so then either I need to work\nharder or I need to be and try to\nsabotage them or all kinds of other crap\nhappens so comparison and ego go hand in\nhand and even if we kind of look at some\nof these this is kind of confusing for a\nlot of people but recently I've been\ntalking about how tall and short are not\nreal things they are comparisons and\nthey are abstractions so height is a\nreal thing absolutely but tall and short\nare comparisons you can't be if I'm the\nonly human being on the planet like and\nI live on a desert island or I live on\nan island there's no other human beings\nI won't be tall or short\nI will be a certain height I can do\ncertain things but other human beings\nare necessary for tall and short to\nexist makes sense so so the other\ninteresting way to see it I've actually\nnever seen it that way it's quite funny\nbut yeah know it's really wild right so\nand then the people who say this is not\ncorrect Dr K will if you pay attention\nthey will be operating from ego I am\ntall here is my experience of tall is\nthere a reality of being of not having a\nparticular height absolutely so I can't\nreach particular things on the Shelf\npeople will judge me absolutely that\njudgment is 100%\nreal but there's this is what this is\nwhere things get really tricky the\njudgment is real but the way that I see\nmyself is moldable by me I think it's\nfunny because they use that as a point\nof humor a lot of the times like the the\nRidiculousness of being like Oh short\npeople tall people it's like a it's a\nreally common silly joke that I tell cuz\nI'm 6'2 so it's slightly above the\naverage right and\nit's like it's not that it's not that\ngood to be a tall person CU you can see\nwhere you want to get to but there's all\nthese short people in the way and like\ncalling out the Ridiculousness of that\nkind of comparison is like I find that\nreally funny right because it it it\ncalls to point it's like doesn't even\nmatter right none of that stuff even\nmatters but it's funny it's funny to do\ndo that so so this is where there is a\nreality there is a real logic to tall\nand short but there is still if we're\noperating from the ego it's never going\nto be enough and this is where like I've\nworked with people and I guess argue I'm\none of them so I'm like 5'7 Or 5'8 I I\nI'm confused about that because I think\nI'm 5'7 and someone else says they're\n5'8 and I'm taller than they are so then\nI'm like I I don't know anymore um com\nprob 5 seven and a half yeah and then uh\nand so but like you know I'm okay with\nthat like that's fine with like you know\nand people will say like oh 57 cursed\nand it's like you know that be honest\nwith you yeah I I think it is\nfrustrating being taller sometimes\nplanes suck absolutely like legitimately\nthere so I think there's always things\nthat go along with both and I that's why\nI always found it to be kind of silly\nlike it doesn't really matter yeah\nbecause like if you're shorter some\nthings are Out Of Reach people will make\nfun of you and if you're taller you're\ngoing to hit your head on stuff and\nyou're also not going to fit in a lot of\nplaces like I have to think about the\nshape of a car that I want to get into\nright and that sucks it's awful yeah I I\nI think that there is there is a logic\nto that that I think a lot of people\nbecause they are operating from ego will\nreject the thought that being tall comes\nwith disadvantages is something that\ntheir logic will respond and say that is\ninsane the there may be some\ndisadvantages but the advantages far far\nfar outweigh the\ndisadvantages I mean it's funny to me\nbecause like there's not a lot of\nadvantages to having a tall programmer\nyou know like it doesn't really matter\nfor\nus it's kind of irrelevant and and they\nI'm pretty sure there are people out\nthere who would argue with you they\nwould find some other point of of\nargument my point is that it when things\nare operating from the ego this this\ngrandiose sense of self as opposed to\nthria which is this Transcendent state\nwhich we'll get to\nthen it can lead to a lot of success but\nit will come at a very high price makes\nsense then there is the I can agree with\nthat I think that makes a lot of sense\nto me honestly yeah so then there\nis operating from Thia so Tua is this\nfourth state of of Consciousness so if\nwe look at um this is kind of how we can\nview\nConsciousness which is\nawareness and then we can look at mental\nactivity and what we find is that we can\nmake a 2 by two table so there's plus\nminus plus minus so when we are aware\nand we are and we have mental activity\nthis is what we call\nwakefulness right I'm I'm awake which\nmeans I'm aware that I exist and my mind\nis functioning when I have no\nconsciousness and mental activity this\nis when I am\ndaydreaming or\ndreaming so I lose my sense of awareness\nbut my mind is operating right and it's\nbeautiful that we even call this\ndaydreaming because we figure out that\nthese two states are very similar\nsubjectively get that when I read a book\nas weird as that is yeah right so when\nwe get lost in something there is a lot\nof engrossing mental\nactivity um and then over here is\nsleep and over here\nis let's call it thya or this is where\nwe have Consciousness but we have no\nmental activity so this is the goal of\nmeditation is to move into this place so\nthis is where once again if we think\nabout\nego uh logic and emotions these are\nthings that are part of the Mind\nthat makes sense this is the mind right\nso I have a sense of who I am I have\nlogical thoughts I have emotions\nemotions can be physical too for\nsure um but the goal is to actually the\ngoal of meditation is to move into this\nplace now somewhere along the way you\ntapped into this and this is what's\nsuper cool about operating from tya is\nthat when you operate from this place\nlike all kinds of cool stuff happens the\nfirst thing that happens is that you\nhave very high Reserves\nof\nenergy yeah okay so much like you I work\noften times seven days a week and I\nwon't work 16 to 19 hours a day I\nbasically can't unless I'm doing\nclinical work so I can work like 60 hour\nshifts at a hospital because I'm\nconstantly seeing patients but I can't\ndo regular work like that but what I\ntend to find is that I I tend to run out\nof energy like I I have low endurance so\nI'll work seven days a week because that\nkind of works for me but you have a lot\nof reserves of energy the other cool\nthing is that you're resilient to\nsetbacks oh\nyeah right set is an advantage\nabsolutely so this is where we go to\nthis where failure becomes and even if\nyou think about the term right so\nfailure implies the end of something\nsetback implies a\ncontinuation yeah and if we huh it\nbecomes fuel absolutely really what it\nis right so this is what's really crazy\nis that like if you think about any\nevent in life it is neither a failure\nnor a setback it is the way in which you\nconceptualize it which determines\nwhether this is a failure or a setback\nso I applied to medical school for a\nyear got rejected 40 times was that a\nfailure like absolutely like objectively\nyou could call it that but is the\nattitude that you take this is an\nopportunity to learn we got to keep\ndoing it let's keep moving forward you\nknow it I certainly had these feelings\nof I am bad and in my case I had gone\nthrough some degree of formal training\nwhich we'll talk about at the very end\ntoday um that helped me move from here\nto here but once again the key thing if\nyou if people want to stop thinking this\nway this is what they need to eliminate\nthe eye the eye needs to be eliminated\nbecause if we pay attention to your\nlanguage Thor you do not operate from\nI right so it's like pretty rare huh\nit's pretty rare I mean I still use the\nword I no no we all use the so the ego\nis so the ego eventually when we do it\nright the ego becomes a tool just like\nlogic and emotion ego isn't bad it is\njust that we should be aware of like ego\nand we should not operate from\nego so when you operate from thya you\nalso get a sense of like direction right\nand then what happens is normally when\nwe get\nparalyzed by Logic and emotion right so\nthis kind of business this kind of\nbusiness goes away so what happens is\nthat right now so there's like two ways\nof operating so if I'm over\nhere and as I move this way I get more\nnegative and then what happens is since\nI'm trying to do something good like the\nreason I moved this way in the first\nplace is because over here there was a\nbeneficial ratio of like positive and\nnegative there's neuros signs to this as\nwell now that the ratio is unfavorable I\nmove this way but now I'm over here and\nthen I end up doing this so when you\noperate from a place OFA what happens is\nthis negativity becomes an obstacle to\novercome we don't stop moving in this\ndirection it just becomes a problem to\nsolve we keep moving in that direction\nso then the experience is like this this\nis our activation energy it's friction\nbut we don't stop moving even though\nthere's friction so it's kind of funny\nit's like it's it's friction it's like\nthere's a wall in front of you and you\njust walk through it yeah you just keep\nwalking till it's\nnot there anymore this is this is also\nwhat gives us follow through so this is\na huge problem in our community right\nnow like in the world where people like\ndon't follow through with stuff and the\nyou're not going to follow through if\nyou're operating from logic or drive you\nwill absolutely follow through if you\nare operating from what I would call a\nTranscendent space and by Transcendent I\nmean a place that is outside of your\nmind right that that drive comes from in\nhere it doesn't come from up here yeah\nit's actually it's funny because we we\nwere playing that puzzle game all day\ntoday and basically every time I hit one\nof those puzzles it was like a ramp up\nand it was like another another another\nbecause you're you're hitting all these\nobstacles and I see a lot of people fail\nout of games like that they put negative\nsort of emotions to those types of\nthings and they're like oh I hate this\nbecause the game didn't hand it to me\nand it's like for me it's like no like\nmore like keep keep giving more\nobstacles please because that that's\nwhat drives me for that it makes it more\ninteresting so this is where there\nchallenges when when I teach that that\nmakes so I'll I'll kind of reflect that\nconcept back to you so there's this\nconcept in Eastern religions basically a\nspiritual Traditions called Dharma so\nDharma means Duty and the cool thing\nabout duty is generally speaking in life\nwe try to run away from negative things\nso your life would be way easier if you\ncould run towards things that were\npainful in some capacity and that's what\nDharma allows you to do so if we're\noperating from logic or emotion or gains\nor outcomes it's all about a risk\nbenefit our brain even does this action\nsuccess calculation where it like\ndecides whether something is worth it or\nnot this is why everyone procrastinates\nwhen they're studying for a test because\nour brain knows that if we wait until 48\nhours and we cram we can still pass\nthat's how the brain decides and it\ndecides that I can study for two days or\nI can study for two months and in one\ncase I get a c and in one case I get an\nA and from an actual like hourly\ncalculation it is more beneficial for me\nto procrastinate because a c for two\ndays is worth is is a way better deal\nit's way better value than 60 days of\nstudying for an a yeah so when we look\nat\ndhma Dharma is also what allows us to do\nhard things so I I I I I don't think you\nhave kids but you know I have kids and\nthe best example fets huh I have 38\nferrets in a rescue that's right so so\nactually the ferrets are are good\nexample so you know if you think about\nmaking sacrifices like staying up or\nspending your money if you do it out of\na duty to your ferrets or I do it for my\nkids CU I don't have ferrets then it\nmakes it easier to stay up late right it\nit makes it easier to do the dishes it\nmakes it easier to do laundry Beyond\nyourself yeah Absol yeah yeah be Beyond\nyourself right so once again this allows\nus Dharma allows us to mitigate the\nstrength of the ego go okay sense um\nthere's another kind of Dimension which\nI want to kind of talk about real quick\nI think I'm screen sharing with you so\nhopefully yall can see this so I'm going\nto just toss in a little bit of science\nbecause there's some support of these\nprinciples this isn't really a Ono one\nthere are other studies which we could\ntalk about Transcendent States Of\nConsciousness and psychedelics and ego\ndeath and stuff like that if you want to\ntalk about that we can oh yeah but I\ntake this um this is where I want to\nintroduce this concept to people of\nhedonic and and udics let me see if I\ncan find a never heard those terms\nactually yeah so let's let's take a look\nat some brain brain stuff so what we\nknow is that there are two kinds of\nthings that make people happy and I\nthink the biggest problem is that when\nwe're\noperating from ego so usually when we're\noperating from our base logic or\nemotions this results in hedonics now\npeople may get confused because they're\nsaying like logically isn't it a good\nidea to they understand with emotions\nlike if I gratify emotions like yeah\nthat's like short-term pleasure but\noften times our logic is flawed right so\nwe'll say we'll like logic ourselves oh\nyeah like I can get drunk today like\nit's not that big of a deal like I can\ndo this work tomorrow that's logical\nthinking but it's in a hedonic Pursuit\nso what what I find in people who are\nhighly addicted to stuff is that their\nlike logical brain is actually run by\ntheir addiction they will constantly in\nrelation to Hedonism right absolutely so\na lot of our logical thinking actually\nresults in a hedonistic lifestyle and I\nknow that that runs contrary to what a\nlot of people would think they're like\noh no emotions are honic and like if I\nlived my life logic that's not actually\nhow it works if you pay attention to\neating that cookie like your brain will\ngive you logic as to why it's okay yeah\nit's it's always like it is a a way of\nproving yourself like well it's okay to\ncheat on my diet this time absolutely\nbecause of these reasons that makes\nsense that leads to hm for sure and\npeople will call that flawed logic but\nit is my experience as a psychiatrist\nthat the abstraction of logic and code\nwhen put into a human brain is no longer\nobjective like that's just not doable I\nthink it's always the first reaction too\nit's not the well I should have the\ncookie you know it's like no I I have to\nconvince myself I have to give myself a\nreasoning why it should absolutely right\nso so so your brain will do that work\nhard to your your the addicted part of\nyour brain will work hard to convince\nthe other parts of your brain through\nlogic that what it wants is correct do\nyou think we see the same thing in um\nkind of criminal Behavior it's like I\nshould do this bad thing because of\nthese reasons so it makes it okay\nabsolutely we not not just criminal all\nBehavior interesting yeah so I mean see\nthis with all the time\nso then there's this concept so this is\nkind of hedonics and the more that we\noperate from here the more we're you\ndionic this is my understanding of the\nNeuroscience of it and like one other\nlike one other way to look at this is\nthat none of this stuff is actually\nexisting this is all unconscious\nprocessing and the reason that we feel\ngood when we operate this is because of\nUD\namonia um but anyway so let's so\nhere's if if if you know hedonics is for\nHedonism what is emonia what's the you\nknow base of that we're going to talk\nabout that so hedonics is\npleasure\ngratification the Fulfillment of\ndesires uh comes from the nucleus\naccumbens and dopamine but I'm going to\nshow you a paper that shows that that's\nnot even\ncorrect a lot of what um a lot of what\nI'm saying is like overs simplif because\nthe truth is is that Neuroscience is\nincredibly\ncomplicated yeah we're still figuring it\nout so okay so now here's the cool thing\nso here's what we know leads to\nudonia First is self-determinism\nsecond is\nself-expression third is effort and\nfourth is\nimportance right so when I see your life\nnow we're talking science okay forget\nabout soul and all this nonsense when I\nsee your life I see all four of these\nthings so you are living a deterministic\nyou're a life of self-determinism you\ndecide you want to do something right\nwe'll talk about the Transcendence we're\ngoing to go to science then we'll end up\nin spirituality I'm fine with it so\nthere's self-determinism there's\nself-expression right very literally\nlike you are expressing yourself\nconstantly\nwhen we look at burnout what we tend to\nfind is that burnout is inversely\ncorrelated with\nemonia so in cases of burnout like you\nwere saying people don't get recognized\nfor their work they don't get to do what\nthey want in their job and the advice\nthat you give people is like if you make\nyour hobby your job there's a chance you\nmay not love it and why is that that's\nbecause when it's a hobby it's all about\nself-expression and self-determination\nbut once you have invoices to send\nonce you have customer service tickets\nto handle once you have all this kind of\nstuff you lose that capacity for\nself-determination and self expression\nyeah another another big one that I talk\nto people about is if you're if you're\nfeeling bad in your job like you don't\nyou don't feel good you don't feel like\nwhat you doing matters is to talk to\nyour boss and if your if your boss is\ngood in any capacity they'll tell you\nyou're doing great here's how or you're\ndoing badly here's how and either way\nyou have an answer which helps state\nthat goal like if if it's bad then you\nhave a you know Target if it's good then\nyou have backup right yeah so I don't\nthink that works for most people so I\nthink your advice is correct I've seen\nit I've seen it work sometimes but I\nthink you're right I think in some\nbecause it it hinges on another person\nthat is an outside unknown variable and\nI mean I would argue that the reason\nthat works so well so I think it's the\nright advice sure I think if we want to\nunderstand when people do that they're\nnot able to hear that right so I think\nthat's what you that's what you that's\nwhat you give them I think it's very\nimportant that you do that Thor I don't\nthink it's the wrong answer I'm saying\nit doesn't work for some people and the\nreason is because of the ego that I\nagree with no I super agree with that\nthat's one of the biggest things is I\nI've never I don't think there is a\nsilver bullet if that makes sense there\nis oh so I think you found it right that\nthat's what we're talking we're talking\nabout the Silver Bullet I I\ndon't just because things are comple\nwe'll get there but I just want to point\nout that if you go to your boss and sure\nthat's assuming that your boss is decent\nbut even in the case that your boss is\ndecent if your boss says you doing a bad\njob and here are the reasons why for a\nlot of\npeople they'll say I suck yeah they'll\ngo down this and they can't go down this\nso what is the difference between that's\nthe ego it's framing ego yeah so so I I\nthink part of what you offer which is\nawesome Thor is that you teach people\nthis literal thinking\nand the more that people think this\ninstead of this if this is what happens\nin their mind their ego will get weaker\nand they will proceed you're 100%\ncorrect that was that's always why I try\nto frame it that way which is when you\nget the answer if the answer is negative\nyou need to see it as a Target that you\ncan reach to to fix to get better and\nyou have to see it that way and if you\ndon't see it that way then it's it's\nworthless but in that in that track of\nthinking Thor I I invite you I mean this\nis what I see I see no ego\nthere right I see externalization of the\nissue about think it's do you think it's\nit's beneficial to portray that as even\nan option though because I find a lot of\nthe times people don't even realize\nthat's possible yes they don't yeah no I\nthink what you're doing is VE let me be\nsuper clear I think what you're doing is\ncorrect very beneficial and you are\ntraining people you are literally\ntraining people to think in this way\nyou're training people to think outside\nof the ego I think the main thing that\nI'm sort of pointing out is that the\nreason that you offer advice and it has\na differential impact on people and now\nwhat I'm trying to do is talk to the\nmembers of your audience if they want\nyour advice to apply better translate\nmore into their life this is a missing\ncomponent because it is the people who\nare not able to absolve themselves of\ntheir ego not become objective not think\nlongterm not zoom out they're not able\nto do those things then it won't\nwork if they're able to do this and we\nsee in your life that you had an\ninflection point of dissolution of the\nego which is why you can think like\nthis I do think that it it's funny\nbecause I I don't ever call that to\nattention for that because I know that\nthere are more components that went into\nthat and it's kind of like a journey of\nthat over time sure because I find\nsometimes people use that as a sort of a\ncrutch for it to say well I can't do it\nbecause I didn't have that experience ah\nso interesting what look at the what\nwhat what were those statements that you\nmade well I can't do it because I didn't\nhave that experience specifically and I\nI do I do see that you know where people\nlike well I he had it so he's he's got\nthe special power now you know yes thing\nit's a way to defeat any potential type\nof growth by saying that you're in a\nposition where it is impossible for you\nwithout trying absolutely so that comes\nfrom the ego that's why it doesn't\nwork do you see that it's like the same\nconstruction any construction that\noperates from here is going to be like\nflawed maybe not any but the majority of\nthem in the context that we're talking\nabout okay so\num so I I think that this is like and\nthis is what I'm sort of Lost in myself\nfor a second cuz I I I love it because\nthat's exactly what they say right and\nnow we see like the principle in play is\nthat a lot of people go through their\nlives it's interesting because you\nmentioned adaptability I I just uh put\ntogether a lecture which hopefully will\nbe coming out soon and and one of the\nkey things that makes people less\nadaptable is\nthey I I I'll I'll skip that for now I\nthink the big thing for me is you're not\ngoing to succeed in the same way as me\nyou're not going to succeed in the same\nway as somebody else that's why I really\ndislike when people draw comparisons\nbetween themselves and other people's\nwork they're like oh I'm not a good\nartist because look at that artist over\nthere do make any sense they're in a\ncompletely different Journey completely\ndifferent things that they've learned\nthey've gone a totally different path to\nlearning things you have to look at\nyourself 3 months ago 6 months ago and\nsay Where am I compared to where I was\nand that's that to me is more important\nthan looking at someone else's thing you\nknow looking at someone else's progress\nand that's the same thing for me right I\ndid all my things you know I went I went\ndown that path and did all these things\nbut the idea is that you're you have\nyour own path and you learn your own\nthings in your own way and you'll have\nyour own adaptations that are vastly\ndifferent from mine\nand that's kind of how that goes right\nyeah so I would I would agree 100% that\nthe healthiest comparison to make in\nlife is a comparison to\nyourself and even that can get that's a\nbig one that can get that can get uh\nmessed up though because like especially\nwhen I work with people who are like\nsober like you're sober for a year and\nthen you relapse and then you look at\nyour former self and you see Fallen yeah\nand and you see that You' fallen and and\nthat can create problems so even I think\nego is like basically it should never be\nin control like it's a tool just like\nyour logic and your emotion yeah I do\nthink that that is that is probably one\nof the most devastating situations I've\nseen is when someone is relapsing\nespecially from addiction you know\nthat's just so it's so rough because\nthat does break that entire thing of\nlike look at everything that I've\naccomplished I've made it this far you\nknow but again it's the eye I've I've\nmade it AB it's the eye it's the eye\nit's the eye it's the eye okay yep so\njust one last I mean I I I'm not feeling\ntoo much of a need for science right\nhere but we'll just kind of talk about\nthis very quickly so if you look at like\nthis is the honic brain circuitry right\nso I think nucleus accumbens is going to\nbe somewhere over here um let's see yeah\nso yeah right here it's whatever this\none\nis um it's somewhere around here and\nthen what we know is that the oh where's\nthe\nudonia anyway emonia comes from other\nparts of your brain like your\nventromedial prefrontal cortex I don't\nsee it over\nhere\num but it's like it's more it's it\nanyway so it comes so we know that\nemonia comes from some areas pleasure\ncomes from other areas and that\nbasically like even when it comes\nto um let me just look\nat yeah so in particular the\nventromedial prefrontal cortex forms\nthese flourishing beliefs by generating\npositive evaluations of life\ncircumstances like life satisfaction the\nself self-esteem relationships and goal\nprogress so emonia is about these kinds\nof Dimensions now I know I'm talking\nabout the ego but I'm using ego the\nreason I use aamar is because that's an\na different concept it's actually a\ndifferent thing but the self is not ego\nthe ego is the construction of my\nidentity and what we sort of know is\nthat the regions that are associated\nwith hedonics and pleasure are different\nfrom the regions that are associated\nwith like being satisfied with your life\nwe also know that uh let me see if I can\nfind\nthis uh it's not here okay um I was\nhoping to find a good paper I think it's\nin a different paper that talks about\nwhat the components of emonia are I'm\nsure they'll have it\nhere um give me a second\nuh okay we'll skip that I don't think\nit's that important but anyway the point\nhere is that when we're talking about\nliving a fulfilling life we don't want\nto operate from these things and\ninterestingly enough accomplishment of\ngoals so this is really important goal\naccomplishment is over\nhere this is one that really trips\npeople up so if you look at UD demonics\nit's not not accomplishment it's\nactually effort and importance it's\nthings like self-determinism and\nself-expression and if you look at\nstudies on\nburnout what we know we basically knows\nknow what burns people out so what burns\npeople out is not working hard it is\nworking hard and being\nineffectual yep so for me like the top\nof the list is like I can see a patient\nI can be on call I remember there's one\nparticular case from residency where we\nhad a patient who was on the I was doing\nI was working on the neurology floor so\nnot\nPsychiatry and we had a patient who\nneeded a very expensive so we had a\n40-year-old person who basically had an\nautoimmune condition where his eyes were\nbeing eaten by his immune system so the\neyes are super scary because they're\nactually immunoprotected so our our our\nbody knows what we are and it knows what\nother people are this is why we get\ntransplant rejection and things like\nthat because the body recognizes this is\nforeign tissue One really scary thing is\nthat our eyes are never exposed to our\nimmune system so if our immune system\never gets into our eyes in a certain way\num it'll actually activate an autoimmune\nreaction and your your immune system\nwill eat your eyes so this was happening\nto this patient in real time and we we\nhad worked really hard to figure out why\nthis person who was in their 40s like\nsuddenly was going blind we were like\nwhat the hell is going on so we did all\nkinds of tests and stuff and then we\nfinally figured out okay this is is an\nautoimmune reaction so we talked to the\ninsurance company the insurance company\nwas like we're not going to pay for that\ntreatment we're like this is crazy like\nyou guys need to pay\nfor that's the height of burnout like\nthe whole like 24 hours of very very\nintensive tests and calling consultants\nand like talking to this person and\nreally trying to figure out insurance\ndoesn't care that we're fine with like\nthat doesn't burn you out working hard\ndoesn't burn you out it is the inability\nto work hard uh sorry it is working hard\nand not getting some kind of result and\nthat really leads to burnout yeah no I\ncan agree with that I mean like since I\nwork in you know rescue we we get all\nkinds of cases that come in and some of\nthem are pretty horrific like two of the\nferrets that we had have uh an\nautoimmune disorder called dim\ndisseminated idiopathic myofasciitis and\nit's the neutrophils from which is\ncomponent of the immune system attacking\nall of the soft tissue of their body\nheart everything everything everything\nand it's they basically just form holes\neverywhere and disintegrate that's kind\nof how that goes and it's\nhorrific to watch but I gained a lot of\ngood feeling out of this from like\nhelping them because what we did was we\nreached out to the foremost Veterinary\nin in uh Oregon that is dealing with\nthis we took that and then um like\nworked with them and they gave us all\ntheir research and then we worked with\nthe ferrets to try and figure this out\nand basically what we did was we gave\nthem a chemotherapy that suppresses the\nbone marrow that reduces the nutrifil in\nthe body and ferrets regenerate very\nquickly right so at a certain point if\nyou keep doing this and you do it in\nways where it doesn't kill them because\nthe bone marrow also produces red blood\ncells so you don't want them to you know\nrun out of that but thankfully ferrets\ndon't have uh they don't have blood\ntypes so you can just do transfusions if\nthat does happen which is kind of cool\nthey get to a point where they\nregenerate faster than the damage being\ndone so now mocha and Latte are the two\nthat we have like this they're totally\nfine they're in remission because of it\nand those types of situations are like\nreally scary autoimmune situations are\ninsane to deal with you just watch\nI'm kind of curious about that can I ask\na couple questions you may not know\nbecause But but so so when you say they\nregenerate fair enough from like a red\nblood cell perspective but as soon as\nthe bone marrow bounces back don't the\nneutrophils start attacking the muscle\ntissue again yes they do so what we have\nto do is just keep doing testing again\nto see what their neutri count is\ngenerally a feret that's in dim it is a\nuh detection of exclusion right so they\nthey test for exclusion they test\neverything else first and then they find\nat the end this is the only thing that\nis left so it's usually pretty hard most\npeople euthanize a fair that has dim\nmost of the time U there's been an\nuptick in it recently they don't quite\nknow the cause there's not enough\nresearch that's being done on this but\nsituations like this allow us to learn\nmore stuff and I spread it out to all\nthe vets that we work with everything\nlike that but with this one it was um\nit's more interesting because when\nyou're testing for this you can see the\nneutr count is very high insanely High\nnormally a fet's going to have usually\nbetween 500 2,000 per blood count and\nthey're at like 160,000 like crazy high\nnumbers we like this is is ridiculous\nwhat do your ferrites eat uh raw food\ndiets so everything is fully raw food\ndiets it's a freeze-dried raw food and\nit's easy to control that because it's\neasy to figure out what their kidney and\nliver values are supposed to be out of\nthat while making sure they get all the\nproper nutrition what I'm curious though\nlike when you say fine it's freeze-dried\nraw food but what is it meat 100% meat\nthey're obligate carnivores meat and\nBone huh they are it is all meat and\nBone they are obligate Carnivor so meat\nbone and egg is all they can eat\ninteresting so ferrets don't eat any\nvegetables no not at all it'll actually\nkill them so if you give them even pea\nproteins so like protein derived from\npeas it gives them kidney stones can't\nhave anything other than meat meat bone\nand egg\nyep no such thing as a vegan ferret not\na thing what percentage of their diet is\negg oh very low to be honest with you um\nit depends some ferrets can have\nindigestion from that very low amounts\nof it can cause kind of like well the\npoops right the diarrhea from it if they\ndon't tolerate it very well but uh it's\nusually seen as as more of a treat a lot\nof it is mostly ground meat and Bone and\nthe the biggest thing you have to Target\nis tarine because you have to make sure\nthey get about 500 milligrams of tarine\nper day for a healthy kind of ferret and\nthey do self-regulate so they won't\novereat which is interesting not like a\ndog we'll just keep eating and eating\nand eating but um so you can just kind\nof put food in there and they'll\nself-regulate but if you don't do that\nyou you don't hit that Mark they get\nhard to disease and and it will kill\nthem 100% of the time we've actually\nreversed some of the heart disease and\nfor that what do wild ferrets eat black\nfooted ferrets the same yeah no but but\nlike like what what is their actual\nprey oh geez all kinds of stuff so a\nferret can actually take down an animal\nbetween two to three times its size um\nthey can take down a chicken they can\ntake down um other small mammals they\ncan take down there's they're very\nvicious Hunters but their their primary\ndiet the primary thing they want to take\ndown rabbits they are very skilled at\ngoing into Burrows and taking down\nrabbits no problem interesting that's a\nbig thing that they're yeah they're\nfantastic at it they're actually used\nfor hunting in Europe because of that do\ndo they eat reptiles amphibians or\ninsects no not insectivores um I think\nin a pinch they might try to eat a\nreptile but that's not like a normal\nthing and amphibian also not like a\nnormal thing yeah that's really\ninteresting yeah so I was just curious\nbecause a lot of what this autoimmune\nstuff at least what we know for humans\nis that dietary changes have huge\nimpacts on autoimmune status we're\nseeing as as odd as this is the the last\ntime that we had a huge uptick in\nspecifically dim was when they changed\nthe formulation for what is called\ncanine distemper vaccine so canine\ndistemper is 100% chance of death in\nferrets it is vicious you they don't\nsurvive whatsoever um and it spreads\nthroughout the population very quickly\nbecause it's a feal oral rout and it\njust just goes through the whole thing\nkills them all so what they have to do\nis every fairy gets K9 dis temper\nvaccine and something with Marshalls\nthey changed the formulation on it and\nthey had a massive increase in dim and\nthen they changed the formulation again\nand it dropped off again there are still\ncases where they get dim but we don't\nknow why quite yet there's not enough\nresearch and unfortunately because so\nfew veterinarians are actually trained\non how to identify dim in the first\nplace we don't get a lot of good data\npoints on how to detect this and we\ndon't get a lot of good data points on\nhow widespread it really is most of the\ntime it's fair to lethargic they're\nhaving these weird problems they're\nthey're not eating they're not drinking\neuth like euthanize and that's it it is\nvery sad but that's generally the way\nthat it goes so when we when we talk to\nother you know vets or rescues or\nanything like that if we find out that\nthey have a feret that fits the kind of\nGeneral conditions that a dim ferret\ncould have we go go talk to your vet\nhere's some paperwork and like take this\nand we we've had a couple of times where\nthey're like oh yeah no totally like\nthis it turns out that they do have dim\nbut the chemotherapy for that is also\nincredibly expensive it's like $450 a\ntreatment and you're talking like a\ntreatment every two weeks for the next 6\nmonths right and like that's not cheap\nfor people it's not cheap at all so like\nthere's got to be something that changes\nwith that to save these animals really\nwhen they're in this kind of a situation\nthankfully with us running the rescue\nhere on on Twitch and like the ad\nrevenue from that ad Revenue paid for it\nall so we just do it and we don't have\nto think about it and save the animal's\nlives but for an average owner that's\nnot possible which is why euthanasia\nhappens we we usually will reach out to\npeople that we can find out for that and\nif they are in an area where we can take\nthem we we try to you be like hey do you\nwant to surrender the animal because we\nhave a good chance of saving them we\nhave a good track record with this we\nhaven't lost one yet so far because we\nknow how to handle it but um that's a\nbig part of building that new Rescue is\nlike I you know the the the point of\nthis is going to be the largest rescue\nin the United States that's the whole\nidea is to make sure that we can have\nkind of a coverage that's beyond just\nyou know 50 m radius which is sort of\nwhere we're at right now you know it's\nlike the 50 Mi is about it\nis like 50 to 100 miles is like the\nmaximum that we can really go because\noutside of that it's just it's not\npossible you know it's just too far and\nwhat is the average lifespan of a ferret\nin the United States about it's about\nfive years due to poor genetics\nunfortunately um Marshall's Farms is the\nprimary breeder inside of the US they\nproduce all the laboratory Animals\nUnited States federally funded so that's\nnot really going anywhere unfortunately\nthe breeding practices have led to bad\ngenetics that include heart disease and\ncancer incredibly common in Europe most\nferrets live to about 10 and they've\nalso found that if you take a European\nferet and you you crossbreed them with a\npole cat they live to almost 20 years\nold or one-year-old because they either\ndie horrifically to cancer really early\nor they live forever which is really\ninteresting and kind of strange po cat\nis a kind of ferret pett is another musd\nit's a wild type different sort of\nanimal kind of like a mink or things\nlike that right so mustelids the whole\nthe whole classification of muscs can be\nlike badgers you know I think otters all\nkinds of different stuff it's MUSC ex\nthose those animals that look very\nfriendly but will tear you apart\nrip you to bits yeah oh yeah they're\nthey're so vicious they're so if the\nferrets were larger I'd be dead right is\nis an otter a musulin I think I'm pretty\nsure an otter is let me look this up I\nwant to make sure before I move forward\nyeah so I think it just falls under the\ncategory of like cute and I want to\ncuddle it but it can it can literally\neviscerate me yeah they they they have\nsuch strong bite strength like such\nstrong bite strength as well and they're\nyou they're a little weasel shaped you\nknow they're so cute yeah they're AB\nabsolutely and some some fets will bite\nyou pretty hard too you got to train it\nout of them that's a pretty common thing\nbehavioral training you know Thor I I I\nknow this is a little bit outside of the\nscope of my expertise in this\nconversation but I I think that like\nespecially with\nmyofasciitis um I've seen a lot of\nreally good outcomes like so this there\nI don't know how much how many studies\nthere are on this I imagine they're out\nthere I'm just you know Rheumatology and\nautoimmune disease is not my area of\nexpertise but I see it a lot I used to\nsee it a lot in my patients because\nthere's an overlap between autoimmune\nillness and a lot of these like\nfibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome\nthere's a lot of these things that end\nup in Psychiatry or like often times\nthese weird occult autoimmune kind of um\nwhat's another example chronic lime is\nlike another good example of like some\nweird autoimmune\nactivation um and and diet really seems\nto be like quite helpful for a fair\nchunk of patients yeah so\nthat's the hardest part about this is\nthere's no there's no way you can\npossibly modify the diet we can choose a\ndifferent protein Source but it has to\nbe animal- based protein because if you\ngo into vegetable based protein they get\nkidney stones and they get them real\nfast too so you end up having this weird\nproblem with that where like there's not\na huge amount of options unfortunately\nand I I'd love to explore that more I\nreally would i' I just don't know where\nto go for that yeah I I the next time I\nyou know I'll this is kind of floating\naround in the back of my I I may just\nthe next time I get in touch with a few\ncolleagues I may just ask them if they\nknow anything about fits but oh yeah no\ntotally and it's funny because like my\nmain goal with it is we create enough\nsituations where there is a good a\npositive outcome like we have like where\nthey're basically in remission right and\nto be real with you the way that we see\nremission on this is mocha and latte\nhave not had a treatment for six months\nand they've had no problems they run\naround they play like any other ferrets\nthey have no issues right none wild and\num my hope is to get rid of that\nidiopathic part of that that diagnosis\nright which is the if you don't know\nwhat idiopathic means it it's we don't\nknow where it comes from\nand like that's it like we just don't\nknow we have no idea like this happens\nspontaneously from somewhere and that\nsucks you know it's a really awful thing\nwe don't know the cause and eventually\nmy hope is that we do know the cause and\nthere's just not enough information I\nthink a lot of that information gets\nlost because we euthanize the animals\nwhen we don't know what it is oh yeah\nyou didn't hear about Henry did you or\nferret no so we had a ferret come in he\nhe' been owned by these people since he\nwas half a year old um if a feret mom\ngets and you're going to love this this\nis wild if a ferret mom gets K uh feline\nparvo or canine demper whether she lives\nor\ndies the the babies that she has have a\nvery high chance of having weird brain\nanomalies um physical changes in the\nbrain and usually they end up de right\nso this this far comes into us and he's\n2 years old and the owners are like he's\nonly turning left or like oh that's\nneurologic like immediately you're like\nthat's going to be a neurologic issue he\ncan only do circling behavior only\nmoving left like something's definitely\nwrong here he can't control his mouth he\ncan't eat so we're feeding him syringe\nfeeding him for like weeks and um we go\nand get him a CT scan we found out he\nhas middle ear infections and outer ear\ninfections in both ears they like okay\nhere's something we can objectively\nfight find out what's going on here and\nsee how he reacts afterwards after he\nstopped what is called Head pressing\nwhere they they push their head on\nthings because they're in so much pain\nand he stopped uh the inability to eat\nit fell away so he could he could feed\nhimself but he moved really weird he's\nconstantly doing these weird head\nmovements and he's still not running\nquite correctly he there's clearly\nsomething wrong so we set up an MRI and\nMRI are pretty expensive but like again\nrescue pays for it we can do the whole\nthing and we put him through the the\nwhole MRI we get him out 60% of his\nbrain is Scar Tissue 60 and it's all\nthrough the brain like it it's 60% of\nthe white matter of the brain is scar\ntissue and even the portions that would\nnormally control autonomic functions so\nlike things like heart and and lungs\ntotally Scar Tissue which is\nmindboggling so the time that he was\nborn was when there was whistleblowers\nthat talked about there being a k9 diser\noutbreak at Marshalls where they\nsuddenly stopped giving ferrets to any\nof the the vet or any of the pet Coast\ninside of the United States so\nwhistleblower said that about 250,000\nand fet died that time period was when\nhe was born which means there's a very\nhigh chance his mom got K9 toer if that\nwas true he somehow survived six months\nwith that kind of\nissue moving like that without being\ndetected because they would call him if\nthat was the case if they found him made\nit into a pet store got bought it half a\nyear made it to two years this way and\nthen came to us and then finally we find\nout what's wrong with him and it's it's\nwild because we've got we've been able\nto see him adopt behaviors from the\nother ferrets so he can do things like\ndigging Behavior now didn't do that when\nhe first came us um he can run and jump\nnow he tried to groom one of the other\nferrets the other day which is new new\nbehavior and like we can watch him being\nable to pick up Social traits but it\nit's mindboggling to see how much of his\nbrain is damaged it's completely I can\nactually send you the you said you said\nwhite white matter damage right that is\ncorrect 60% and some of some other\nportions some of structures for that is\nit's completely\nbasically and it's it's also it is um\nfully symmetrical the damage so it had\nto have happened before he was born so\nSOA is canine distemper a parvo virus\nany let me actually look that up to make\nsure because you mentioned parvo earlier\nand I was yeah feline parvo so you know\nit's interesting because I mean that's\nthat's consistent so there's it's it's\nfascinating I love hearing that story so\nhere's like a couple of initial thoughts\nfirst is you mentioned that um virus yes\nboth so so you you mentioned that the\nferet wasn't C right so like we have to\nthink about it kind of\nstatistically so it actually makes sense\nlike everything in your story makes\nsense and and things could get better so\nlet's understand a couple Basics one is\num so when you have you know a perinatal\nor prenatal viral infection of the brain\ngenerally speaking that is very very bad\nbut there are there can it sort sort of\nmakes sense it's almost like a selection\nbias where the fet\nthat how can I say this out of 250,000\nferrets if there is one fet that happens\nto have the viral infection in a certain\nway that it is not detected early like\nit kind of Dodge the bullet does that\nmake sense cuz if if it if it had\naffected maybe the gray matter part of\nthe brain which we'll talk about in a\nsecond then you're kind of like so and\nthen it would have been detected so the\nfact that it did not get detected means\nthat that's a good prognostic sign\noh but\nhe I think it was negligence that it\nwasn't detected okay moves very\nstrangely so so so that's that's\nabsolutely a possibility but my point is\nthat like sure it could be negligence\nbut the other thing is that the\nparticular damage of this perinatal\ninfection was on the less severe side\nwhich is why the ferret did not get\ncalled oh yeah SE second I think yeah I\nthink that it it made me wonder if it\nwas just the chaos of what was going on\nin there legitimately because it is when\nhe's around any other fa it's very\nobvious so so there's there's all kinds\nof other things that could go into that\nbut just from like just purely a medical\nperspective forget about the\ncircumstances forget about things like\nthat so so because we see this sometimes\nwhere there's someone who has like you\nknow a really messed up brain and then\nbut the the whole thing is that even\nthough the brain is super messed up\nsomething about the pattern of damage\nis you know there it's it's kind of like\nyou know if I if I get shot by a gun a\ngunshot wound does not have the same\neffect depending on where it hits my\nbody so even though I sent you I sent\nyou a video just so you can see so you\ncan have the\ncontext hold on because I can I totally\nunderstand where you're coming from but\nthis is\nprofound so I don't know how to look at\na ferret brain but I definitely see so I\ncan walk you through the feret brain but\nthe the video if you see him oh\nyeah but I mean how do I show this hold\non I gotta like he he does not move\nnormally whatsoever hold on a second and\nthis is every action that he makes and\nhe's constantly you know\nshaking this is the first time he ever\ntried to groom another ferret by the way\nthat video that you just\nsaw so the one that's white there that's\nMouse yeah Mouse has what is called uh\nwardenburg syndrome if you've heard of\nthat Wallenberg or Warden wardenburg\nI've heard of\nWallenberg it's very different yeah so\nthat you can see Henry's that head\nmovement that's that's the biggest thing\nis he does that all the time constantly\nit's very very obviously neurologic\ncondition so that's is this is this the\nsarabellum do you know what what part of\nthe white matter this is so if you want\nto look at this um I've sent you a tweet\nthere as well yeah I'm going to I'm\ngoing to try to pull it but but do you\nknow if that's the cerebellum because\nthis it cere damage we actually\nDage we thought it was we thought it was\ngoing to be C cerebella hypoplasia first\nthat was what we believed going into it\nmakes sense and it turned out to be this\ninstead on top of some kind of lesions\non the cerebelum which we need to we\nneed to fully review it with radiologist\nsoon yeah but if you see do you see the\nthe white on the top of the brain there\nyeah yeah that's all leion let me let me\njust pull this up so that people can see\nyeah the official diagnosis from the\nveterinary was swiss cheese brain they\nwere like I've never seen anything like\nthis so This I mean so this is where the\ncerebellum I I don't know what a fa\nbrain looks like but this is generally\nthe ballpark of the cerebellum not this\nstuff over here but this looks quite\ncerebella and the main thing is that\nthis kind of a taxia is look cerebella\nlike the the way that the the way I\ndescribe it is that so the ferad is\ntrying to Target something but the part\nof our brain\nthat manages that yeah like that the\npart of our brain that's like if I want\nto like point over here like my B is\nwhat lets me do that so it's basically\nlike missing like when you have sah\nBalor damage it's like you have an\naccuracy debuff where you can't like hit\nthings where you want them to go and\nalso has like he's also got like\ncognitive issues where like he can\nchoose a thing and he does the thing and\nmost other fits will do like\nmultitasking they'll try to do different\nthings they'll try to like they have\nlike kind of a forethought for it he\ndoes not there's there's definitely\nother factors in there so so the the the\nreally interesting thing so you're\nsaying that he's getting better right so\nhere's the cool thing so our brain has\nwhite matter and has gray matter uh gray\nmatter is generally speaking neuronal\ntissue so these are neurons and\ngenerally speaking we don't regenerate\nneurons but our white matter is things\nlike\nastrocytes um these are the supportive\ncells of the brain and the good news I\nmean if it's scarring that's a that's a\ndifferent issue but generally speaking\nwhite matter we can recover yeah it's\nfull lesions unfortunately so I don't\nknow if it will recover but seeing him\nperform form new behaviors yeah is\nincredibly compelling so so that that's\nwhy there's there's like I think it's\nit's consistent right so if this is like\na white matter leion like it's white\nmatter doesn't and if there's scars\nthat's a whole different ball game\nbecause scars are\nlike we can recover white matter if\nthere isn't stuff in the way but scars\nare like Rubble that prevent the white\nmatter from\nregrowing I'm not a neurologist basic\nthere's going to be like a little bit of\nscarring in there and then a little bit\nthat can be recovered I'm wondering if\nwe're basically seeing the recovery of\nthose pieces that can be over time\nbecause he's clearly forming new bonds\nnew new behaviors like that's not what I\nexpected I expected him to say the same\nI mean I I wouldn't expect the cerebella\ndamage to get completely back to normal\nbut there's two two different mechanisms\ngoing on one is that white matter can\nheal that's what we see in like multiple\nsclerosis for example so that's like a\nwhite matter you get these white matter\nlesions and then when someone goes into\nremission from Ms like they're they\nrecover hopefully um second thing is uh\nthe brain can still adapt right so even\nin the case of like gray matter problems\nwhen someone has a stroke the brain will\nadapt and then you'll have like some\npart of the brain that takes over and\ndoes the lifting for something that a\ndifferent part of the brain used to do\nmakes sense yeah that's exactly what I\nthought because especially with the\nautonomic function area that had been\ndamaged because we we talked to I forget\nthe portion of the brain that was\nhandling that one that was confirmed\ndamage but basically it looks like it\nshifted somewhere else and they just\nlike don't know where something else is\nhandling it just like okay yeah I I it\nit that's what the brain does so the the\nhe's clearly still got a heartbeat you\nknow like that's kind of how it came\ndown to the coolest example of I mean I\ndon't know if this is cool but I I had a\num I can't remember the exact I I think\nyeah so I had a patient who had a an\namputation Bel uh below the\nknee and something I think there's I\ndon't remember the exact circumstances\nof the problem but they had an ation\nbelow the knee and then the part of\ntheir brain that was devoted to that so\nbasically we have a map in our brain of\nour like physical body and so you have\ncertain regions of the brain that will\ncorrelate with your face and your feet\nand things like that so this patient\nwhen they had the below the knee\namputation so there's basically a part\nof their body missing sometimes this\nresults in things like Phantom limb\nwhere like you can feel the part of your\nyour body even though it's not there\nanymore um\nbut this person they actually the this\npart of their knee mapped on to the part\nof their their brain that was devoted to\nthe clitoris mapped on to their knee um\nand so what started happening is they\nthey started they could achieve orgasm\nby someone rubbing their stum and and\nit's just it's amazing like it's crazy\nlike what the brain is capable of um and\na lot of people are like Wild Thing a\nlot of people are like you know oh like\nthat sounds epic but it's it's actually\ncan be quite deil itting because when\nyou look at a prosthetic like you know\nit's like you're how do you walk yeah\nit's it's very challenging so it was it\nwas very very difficult case but it's\nit's super interesting you can get all\nkinds of weird you know your brain gets\nconfused but yeah it's it's kind of\nfunny because I was I I didn't even mean\nto derail it all but I just wanted to\nshow you that because I thought You' be\nreally interested Walkers and we just\nfound out this last week too it's only\nbeen like a week soon as we found out\nabout it and it's like no one expected\nthat everyone expected like oh it's\nprobably going to be you know C cerebel\nor hypoplasia that's what we thought\noriginally because it it it cats get\nthat too when the mam cat gets feeling\npervo very common and they call them\nwobble Cats online that's usually what\nyou see and ferrets get the exact same\noutcome so you're like maybe it's that\nit's like no this is way more wild than\nthat looks looks very\nCeller um anyway going back to I I I\nlove The Detour like this is cool like\nit's like I haven't I haven't looked at\nan MRI in like a\nyear I the last one I looked at was like\na human MRI but it you know I don't I\ndon't get a whole lot of opportunities\nto look at MRIs so it's nice to be able\nto you know dust off the cobwebs a\nlittle bit I can send you some really\nWild Ones for this too like just massive\nlike all the files I think you'll really\ndig them and it's it's funny because\nit's you see the exact same types of\nbehavior in in you know humans depending\non the portion of the brain that's\ndamaged yeah that that's I mean I'm not\na vet right but that looks like sbal\nproblems and that's the region of the\nbrain and and so it's it makes sense I\nknow more about animal medicine\nspecifically with ferrets than I do with\nhumans yeah so you know I think there's\nthere's a lot that carries over right\nlike we tend to have you know you\nmentioned inner ear stuff I was getting\nhopeful there that it was like an inner\near infection that's messing with your\nvestibular system so that's why the is\nalways turning left yeah I was like oh\nit's vestibular yeah and it's not\nbecause then if you deal with the\ninfection it can start turning right\nagain yeah yeah they they usually\nrecover at least in ferrets they usually\nrecover really fast when it's vestibular\nso yeah I mean but it but still turning\nleft is like that's not consistent with\nvestibular usually that's like that\nsounds more like hem neglect which does\nsound more neurologic and um I don't\nknow if you all have seen like uh you\nknow pictures of Hemi neglect and clocks\nbut this is neuroscience I mean\nneurology is just\nfascinating yeah it's pretty wild to\nwatch so uh this is a great\nexample of what Hemi neglect looks like\nso it's like your brain can't see um I\ndon't know if I'm screen sharing this\nwith you but your brain can't you'll\nbasically make a whole clock face on\nlike half of it so this is what Heming\nneglect looks like so sometimes if we're\nall left it you know like if we can't\nturn right that's because our our brain\ncan't see so this is what the this is\nwhat H have me\nneglect if you ask someone about what\nthey see like they won't be able to see\nhalf of the stuff and if you ask them to\ndraw a clock their brain only recognizes\nlike one half of the thing I think there\nwas a thing like this the um there was a\ncase where a guy had the two halves of\nhis brain were severed remember that\nyeah and he he was able to like identify\nobjects differently based on which eye\nit was being seen in I have I have to\nlook into that study again it's wild\nyeah I we can we can talk about it if\nyou want it's it's yeah absolutely it's\nso basically what happens is our our\neyes are like controlateral so my right\neye actually see like the left part of\nthe brain well it getss complicated\ndepending on what the tracks look like\nbut um so like basically half of the\nvisual field is anyway so I eyes can be\nsomewhat controlateral and the really\ninteresting thing is that different\nparts of the brain have access to\ndifferent qualities of information so\nwhen you get a saing of the Corpus\nkosum there are certain um and that's\nthe bond between the two halves the\nbrain it's the big highway there are\ncertain things I mean my neur ol is\nRusty but there are certain things that\nthe so the left eye which is connected\nto the right side of the brain will be\nable to perceive the for example the\nemotional impact of an object that you\nperceive I could be wrong on the details\nthere this is like I'd have to sit down\nand draw the tracks and stuff but so\nlike basically like if you ask someone\nwho has like this cerebella severing and\nyou ask them to close their right eye\nand they look at something with their\nleft eye they'll be able to tell like oh\nthis is like someone's\nuh this is someone's like favorite\nstuffed animal they'll know that part\nbut if you ask them how many ears does\nthis bunny have they may not be able to\ntell you and on the right side on the\nthrough the right eye which is connected\nto the left hemisphere of the\nbrain they'll have the opposite so\nthey'll be like if I ask you like okay\nlike what is what what is this they may\nnot be able to name it but they'll be\nable to tell you like oh it has like\nthis many eyes and this many ears it's\nthat\nthatal but they like so it's all kind of\nweird goes on in the brain with and\nI'm Rusty on that stuff but it's super\ncool you basically have two two types of\nbrain fighting each other yeah figure\nout what it is they're looking\nat we just uh I I think we're about to\nrelease our trauma guide and what's\nreally fascinating about this is\ndissociation is basically\na signaling version of that so there's\nan anatomical severing but what we know\nin people who dissociate is that they\nhave like you know they're experiencing\nsomething so it's something called\nhemispheric lateralization where they're\nexper they're going through a really\nterrible experience but they feel no\nemotion and that's literally because\nwhat happens in their brain the the\nemotion is so overwhelming that it's\nalmost like you know the blast doors on\nlike these like spaceships when like\nwhen you get hit by a torpedo and then\nyou're like venting vacuum in these\nsci-fi things and you like close the\nblast door like that's what the brain\ndoes so brain is like there's way too\nmuch emotional fire over here we need to\nprotect our logical side of the brain so\nthey shut the blast doors and they\nseparate out like these two parts the\nproblem is that that part of the brain\nis still active we're just we become\nnumb to it and so then it starts doing\nthings like resulting in impulsive\nbehavior and leads to things like\naddictions and like all kinds of other\nproblems so it doesn't it doesn't shut\noff it's just we segregate the two\nhalves of our brain is like a survival\nmechanism and the subjective experience\nof that is dissociation so you would you\nsay that the two halves are adversarial\nbut in a positive way in a normal\nGeneral way like normal General function\nbecause it seems like it's like an\nadversarial model where it learns from\nit's this no it's this no it's this but\nit's actually this together and then\nthey can agree I don't I I I wouldn't\nsay it's adversarial like so I I don't\nthink basically any so things are\nbalanced MH right but like I don't think\nany part of the body or brain is\nadversarial within all of them have the\nsame goal right so we all evolve to have\nlike surv\nso there can be there can be conflict\nright and and that can happen even\nbetween like for example like our heart\nand our kidneys and our lungs and our\nkidneys and our heart and our lungs\nthere's all kinds of homeostatic\nmechanisms to where if one part of the\nbody is not doing what it's supposed to\nthe other part of the body will\ncompensate so I'd say they're more\nthey're it's Co-op it it's not it's like\nPVE it's not like\nPVP um makes sense yeah no see a lot of\nthe times we build things like that in\num kind of like programming adversarial\nmodel which is like you have one side\nthat works one way one side that works\nanother way and it's competition between\nthe two to make the whole thing more\nefficient and find a better sort of\ndescription for what it see if that\nmakes sense that's why I was wondering\nif it worked the same if it was similar\nin any way in that way yeah I mean I I\nwouldn't use the word adversarial but\nthere are absolutely like balancing\nmechanisms and there are different parts\nof the brain that will in a sense\ncompete with each other so a really good\nexample of this is the thalamus so the\nthalamus is sort of our sensory\nprocessing center for the brain so what\nhappens is like we constantly have input\nfrom our eyes ears\nnose and then like what gets floated to\nyour attention so the the phalus\nintegrates but I don't think that the\neyes and the ear well I in some cases\nYou could argue that they're competing\nbut not really right so so there's but\nthings like a friendly yeah so it's like\nokay the thalamus it's this yes so all\nparts of the body and the all of our\nsensory organs start inputting things\ninto the thalamus and then the thalamus\nis basically deciding for us like what\nfloats to the\ntop but I I don't think that our you\nknow our eyes are like competing against\nour ears like the the the signals need\nto be balanced but I I don't think it's\nlike a competition where one wins and\none loses makes sense in fact when you\nhave that that's when you end up with\nillness so there are cases where if we\nlook at things like um chronic pain so\nchronic pain pain is when there is a\npart of our brain that is amplifying its\nsignal and ignores everybody else so\nwhen it goes PVP we end up in chronic\npain where it's demanding your attention\nconstantly yeah that makes sense would\nyou say are there any similarities\nbetween that and restless leg syndrome\nas interesting as that\nis\num my first answer is not\nreally my second answer is that I am\nalmost sure that my first answer is\nwrong so I was reading some interesting\nstudies about it actually so if you if\nyou don't have anything then do you what\nwhat do you mean oh no I'm interested in\nin uh here anyway continue so so here's\nwhat I would say so like we we have an\nunderstanding of the pathophysiology of\nrestless leg okay so it's like a\nrestless leg is somewhat\nopic at the same time I'm sure that that\npathopysiology is incorrect so the the\nright answer so we know that restless\nleg has a lot to do with the dopam\nenergic\ntransmission and um so we we we use\nmedications like rinol and other kinds\nof like dopam energic agents because\nthat seems to fix the\nproblem but there's no doubt in my mind\nthat that is an incomplete understanding\nand I have not kept up to date I mean\nthe last time I got fresh on restless\nleg was like literally probably 9 years\nago so the last time I I really treated\na patient who had bad restless leg was\nlike I can think of the patient it was\nlike 9 years\nago um why do you ask about the research\naround restless leg we can try to figure\nit out there was something that was\nreally interesting to me was the like\nyou said dopamine energic the the\ninteresting thing was like levels of\ndopamine that were actually being\nuptaken and being utilized and restless\nleg syndrome and one of the things that\nI thought was really interesting was sh\nused to have uh wrestle slake syndrome\nall the time used to complain about it\nconstantly who and Shay so Shay runs the\nthe ferret rescue with me okay U makes\nmakes art with be does all this kind of\nstuff and something that they found that\nwas really interesting because they were\nlooking into literature for this was\nthey found that um melatonin at one\npoint had been correlated with reduced\ndopamine uptake they stopped taking\nmelatonin they stopped having restless\nleg syndrome which was really\ninteresting and I was wondering if you\nknew anything about that kind of\nsubject um so I I I I mean I can look\nsome stuff up right now I think that\nthat is consistent so not that I know\nthis stuff but here's the mechanism of\naction that I would think so melatonin\nhelps us sleep generally speaking\ndopamine dopamine is an\nactivating neurotransmitter so dopamine\ndoes all kinds of stuff right so it also\ndoes like pyic movement and it's\nimplicated in Parkinson's and movement\ndisorders and stuff so but if if we like\nlook at it like on a very very high\nlevel like AB ract not entirely\nscientific but just clinical\nunderstanding so if we have dopamine\nthat's too high we will become psychotic\nso we'll like perceive things like we'll\nhallucinate we'll become angry we'll\nfeel attacked so what what so we use\nanti Psy anti psychotic medication is\ndopamin energic blockade MH so if you\nkind of think about it like dopamine in\nthat way is like an activ\nneurotransmitter and it doesn't surp I\ndid not know this but it does not\nsurprise me at all that melatonin or\nother things that are correlated with\nthe induction of sleep will slow down\nthe activity of our dopamine yeah I\nactually I sent you a a pub Med there\ncheck it out um so what what I would\nventure is that melatonin it makes sense\nthat melatonin does oh whoops hold on\nmelatonin sorry sorry sorry I left the\ncall oh um by accident I clicked the\nwrong thing hold on\noh god I've been\ndeleted GG hold on this should work\nDiscord let's go\nto this and then let's go to this and\nlet's get your back where your back okay\num you sent me a pub Med let's take a\nlook I can't believe Dr K works for big\nmelatonin um tried to get rid of\nme\nso so I before I I take a look at this I\nI think think this is the you know the\nway that I would understand it is\ndopamine is generally speaking\nactivating so it makes sense that\nmelatonin production would suppress\ndopamine\nsignaling yeah um so that makes sense\nand then you know we use dopam energic\nagents to\nhelp with\nsleep not not we use dop energic agents\nto help with restless leg we don't use\ndop energic agents to put people to\nsleep yeah no I mean um sorry weuse\nmelatonin vers a sleep right I find it\nto be kind of interesting because I'm\nwondering with things like that it's\nalways really interesting because it's\nscen as like super safe right seen as\nlike the safest sleep a you could have\nand then we started finding these\narticles that's quite interesting dude\nthis is this is literally exactly what I\nwas hypothesizing that's exactly why I\nsent it to you right this this would\nthis would make sense um so in\nParkinson's patients melatonin May on\nthe one hand exacerbate symptoms so this\nmakes sense so Parkinson's is a melat is\na dopamine deficiency melatonin and\ndopamine are inversely correlated right\nbecause when we want to go to sleep we\nwant to lower our\nour uh dopamine levels so that this\nmakes\nsense um melatonin oh this is\ninteresting so melatonin being an\neffective treatment for of\ndiscinesia is is very interesting\nbecause of discinesia is caused by\nprolonged dopamine energic\nblockade so\num and and that's not that surprising so\nthat that's kind of why I say like if\nyou really look at it like unfortunately\nthe body is not it's not like one to one\nthere's all kinds of various\ncompensatory\nmechanisms so I would predict the\nMelatonin being problematic for for\nParkinson's but there's something weird\ngoing on with of\ndiscinesia um but then there's also\nreasons why that could make sense to\nbecause of disia is actually an\nadaptation to prolonged dopaminergic\nstuff and I mean we can really get into\nthat if you want to but drugs is what it\nlooks like yeah so of discinesia is\ncaused by the lifetime exposure to\ndopaminergic\nblockade makes sense and so then what\nhappens is of discinesia May in and\nof itself be a adaptation to Chronic\ndopamine\nblockade and so then actually here's the\nmechanism so if I if my brain is so this\nis probably it I I mean we don't know\nbut so of discinesia is my brain's\nadaptation to a lack of\ndopamine\nso I don't need the adaptation if I no\nlonger have a block of dopamine or if\nsome something else is blocking the\ndopamine for me I no longer need to\nadapt that's actually the\nmechanism so of discinesia happens\nwhen we have dopamine blockade and if\nMel melatonin comes in then our brain is\nlike we don't need the of\ndiscinesia anymore because the Melatonin\nis doing the job for us I don't know if\nanyone on in chat is following this but\nlike that would be my hypothesized\nmechanism who the knows if that's\nactually what it is but it's almost like\nthe Melatonin is doing the job of the\n of discinesia and anytime our our\nbody gets something that does the job\nfor us it shuts down those\nmechanisms and if I'm right on that that\nthat would be I would think I'm a Chad\nthat's that aad moment that's exactly\nwhy I brought this to you CU like there\nthere are things that I get to see in\nanimal medicine that I get to research\nall the time things that I get to see in\nanecdotal evidence and being able to\npass it by somebody who knows this much\nbetter than me is is way helpful because\nI'm like look at this does this make\nsense you know I do that all the time in\nfor veterinary medicine when we're\ntrying to come up with a way to handle\nthat you know like trying to handle\nanything that's going on with the\nferrets super super common this is this\nis super super super cool paper though\nyeah very interesting it it turns out\nthat I keep a list of these I I I could\nbe wrong though because they say that\nthere's something about the antioxidant\nnature of melatonin so I didn't I didn't\nthink about I missed that one that was\nanyway this is super interesting though\nbut yeah no thanks for talking about\nthat yeah no I I mean I I love talking\nabout I mean I like medicine medicine's\ngreat a lot of fun um just circling back\nso I I feel like I there was one other\nthing that I wanted to share with with\nyou I I know we're kind of off track um\nfine but just to kind of tldr for people\nso earlier we were talking about like\ndrive and burnout and we were also\ntalking about this kind of like this\nthird space where your drives come from\nso a couple of things tya self Atman\nwhatever\num so I think that like the part of the\nreason that this stuff is easily\naccessible for you so one of the the\nexplanation from the Eastern system I'm\nnot saying this is correct but the way\nthat they would explain that is that\nyou've done some amount of spiritual\npractice in a past\nlife that being said we don't know if\nthat's real or not um there's also some\nreally interesting uh biological\nmechanisms of that which have to do with\nlike epigenetic memory and things like\nthat that like we can basically inherit\nmemories from our ancestors so the\nconcept of memory or learnings that come\nfrom Beyond your life that's\nscientifically fact instinct is a really\ngreat example of that like that's like\nlearning that comes from before you were\nborn so there are sources of\ntransmission of information and\ncompetence that can happen before you\nwere born yeah it's really interesting\nbut I find that to be interesting too\nbecause it's like you you can't just\nhave an animal always act you know\nsimilar to the other animals like itself\neven in isolation where they've never\nhad any type of environmental factors\nwhere they've they've learned from\nothers of their kind and they're still\nacting you know in the same way\nyou can't have an so are you saying that\nsome animals so like as funny as this\nsay you take a ferret you never show it\nto another fet they're still going to do\nWar dances they're still going to do all\ntheir behaviors their digging behaviors\nall those types of things an instinctual\ndrive to do those and yeah outside of\nsocialization where does that come from\ndidn't come from socialization they\ndidn't learn it from humans there has to\nbe something it carries over yeah yeah\nso so that that's that's a pretty\nwell-known scientific fact yep so the\nthe couple of things that you know I\nwant people kind of like take away is\nfirst is that I think if we look at your\nthought process we see that there are\nvery few egotistical oriented statements\nwe also see that the inflection point\nthat you\ndescribe is actually very consistent\nwith this idea of Abandonment of the ego\nnow I think inflection point is a really\ngood word because the other really\nimportant thing to understand is that\nthe more that you think in an\negotistical way literally the number\nnumber of thoughts that you have that\nare ego related will strengthen your ego\nand the number the less you think in an\negotistical I am bad I am good I am a\nbadass I am grandiose I am this I am\nthat the fewer thoughts you have like\nthat the less egotistical you will\nbecome so we we know that like literally\nif you take like a thousand thoughts\nthat you have the percentage of them\nthat are ego oriented with an eye\ninvolved will correlate with like a\nstronger ego in in a bad way and and\nthat's just because neurons that your\nneurons will habituate so like you you\nwill have patterns of\nthinking absolutely and if you you\nnotice this if you like know people who\nare like very habitual thinkers like you\ncan trigger people um who will you know\ngo on their tie raade like you know I\nhave family members that will go on\ntheir TI raade about like so I have a\nfamily member who thinks that the\nyounger generation is losing with\nwhatever the hell and so that like all\nyou have to do is like you it's like you\nactivate like Boomer rant. exe and then\nlike the what you'll notice is that the\nwhat they say is like it's like it can\nbe scripted literally they can repeat it\nover and over and over again and it's\nnot that it's right or wrong it's just\nthat once the script activates it'll\ncontinue to activate it's never going to\nstop yeah and and the script of the ego\nis something you have to be very careful\nabout and so literally I think the the\nreally cool thing that you're doing\nwhich I think correlates a lot with the\nsuccess of your community Thor is that\nyou are training people to think in a\nnon- egotistical way right setbacks are\nsetbacks they opportunities to learn\nthere's some stuff about growth mindset\nand Carol DW's work in there the last\nthing that I want to talk to you about\nis so a lot of people may be wondering\nokay how do I get rid of ego how do I\nget access to that third space so a\ncouple of weird things about that third\nspace the first is that some people\nbelieve that all knowledge comes from\nthere I happen to be one of those people\nso it's kind of weird but like cuz we\nnoticed that the conclusion happens\nfirst and then logic and emotion happens\nafterward there's this kind of belief\nthat all knowledge exists in that third\nspace that you have access\nto so this is not part of you this is\nwhy we use the word transcendental and\nnow we've left science completely behind\nokay or I mean there's some scientific\narguments that can be made but they're\nnot I don't think they're anywhere near\nconvincing enough it's like you can kind\nof you can mver it together and it may\nbe correct but\nwe're far from any kind of scientific\nproof of what we're talking about now MH\nso all all knowledge exists in this kind\nof divine Collective Consciousness weird\nthing and when we tap into that is when\nwe get these right answers so the less\nego we have the easier it is to tap into\nthat and the really interesting thing is\nthat the text that I happened to read\nthe night that our stream got flubbed\nwas talking about particular techniques\nto directly tap into that so this text\nis specifically about there's many\ncomplicated ways to tap into it you can\ndo yoga you can do pranam you can do\ndifferent kinds of meditation practices\nbut there are direct ways to get on like\ntap into it just directly without all of\nthese\nsteps and the essence of that is it's\ngoing to sound weird is in the in\nbetween\nspaces so if you pay attention to your\nexperience of Life what you will\nprobably discover what I've discovered\nwhat a lot of people I've worked with\nhave discovered is that you know you\nhave a thought and then you have a\nthought and you have a thought and then\nyou can also have an emotion you can\nhave an emotion you can have an emotion\nbut if you pay attention to your mind\nthere is a quiet space in between\nthoughts there is a quiet space in\nbetween\nemotions and that third space I would\nventure I would hypothesize for you Thor\nis accessed in those quiet spaces it is\nnot the result of logic it is between\nlogic and it is between emotion yep I\ncould see that no that makes complete\nsense to me actually so can you explain\nthat to us because I don't ever feel\nlike I'm pushing down my logic and\nemotion I'm not reing it in or telling\nit to step aside for a moment it's like\nthere's a breathe in and a breathe out\nthere's a moment where it's like okay\nit's this now logic motion now it's this\nnow it's logic and motion whatever it's\nit's taking turns but there's never any\ntype of a I need to force myself to do\nthis it just happens right so so it's\nit's funny the language that you used\nbecause that is actually the technique\nis to catch this the yeah it's cool this\nlike it's weird so to to so if you're\ntrying to look for the in between\nspace there are a couple things you can\ndo first is when we meditate generally\nspeaking our goal is to stop uh uh\ncreate a sensation of thoughts yep um\nand so if you're if you have no thoughts\nand no emotions and you're just present\nif you're in that thya state of\nconsciousness without mental activity\nyou're just focused this is kind of like\nflow flow is on the on the track to this\nplace um but flow still has mental\nactivity so at so what we try to do in\nmeditation is we widen the in between\nspace right so if we say thought nothing\nthought nothing thought nothing and if\nwe look at our suffering our suffering\ncorrelates with a very very tiny Gap so\nif you look at something like a panic\nattack the subjective experience of a\npanic attack is one thought leads to\nanother leads to another leads to\nanother there's no space in between them\nthere's no relief a thought Loop is also\nwe're going to cycle through these 15\nthoughts and we're going to cycle again\nwe're going to cycle again there's no\nGap meditation is the exact opposite we\nare trying to increase the gap between\nour thoughts and our emotions\nthe really interesting thing about what\nyou described is that the other formal\nway to practice this is to find the gap\nbetween inhalation and\nexhalation so breathing in and breathing\nout is a very natural thing where\nthere's directionality in one place\nthere's directionality in another place\nso you have to move through an\ninflection point every time you breathe\nthere is an inflection point between\nthought and thought number one and\nthought number two there's an inflection\npoint between happiness and sadness\nthere's an inflection point between\nbreathing in and breathing out there's\nan inflection point between being awake\nand falling asleep so in all of these\ninflection points it is in the\ninflection point that the magic happens\nand if anyone wants to free themselves\nfrom thought emotion ego and they want\nto follow your path Thor they need to\nsit in the in between spaces\nI think that's really hard for most\npeople to conceptualize if that makes\nsense yes it is very hard for so so the\nthe the tradition that I'm drawing from\nis shamba Yoga which is a very very\nrigorous and difficult technique so it\nis like straight onto the highway so\nit's hard to do but it is absolutely\npossible they also describe it as a\nchoiceless\nawareness so choice and this is where\nlike I don't know I think this will\nresonate to you as well like you don't\nreally make a choice the choice sort of\ngets made and you follow it yeah does\nthat make sense and like this is where I\ndon't think many people will understand\nthat but the more that you do this the\nmore\nthat it just becomes what it is there's\nno choice to be made there's no choice\nabout the ferret rescue it's just it is\nto be done it's happening it is\nhappening it is right it is it is it is\nperiod it's it's funny to because people\nbe like how do you choose things how do\nyou choose to do things so fast I always\nhave to like wait on I was like it's\nalready chosen yes yes I can tell so sh\nshamba yoga is what you're doing so I I\ndon't even know you know I don't need to\ndo anything for you you're doing it all\nright um you know if you\nwant more detail I we can go into more\ndetail at some point about practices and\nstuff like that like we're actually\ndoing a uh something on the membership\nside this month about developing a\nmeditation practice but um\nyeah so I I think that like this\nchoiceless awareness I'm not surpris I\nthink it's it's very confusing for a lot\nof people like what do you mean I don't\nchoose no the choice yeah I me it's been\nconfusing for anybody that I've talked\nto pretty much my whole life over like\npeople I mean in real life people I know\nonline like it doesn't make any sense\nand they're just like what like what do\nyou mean you just do things and it's\nlike I just do things you know yeah I I\nget you so so the you know my experience\nof it is that I oscillate\nbetween choosing things and choiceless\nawareness the more my ego activates the\nmore emotional I get the more that State\nof Mind happens then I feel paralyzed I\ndon't know what the right choice is the\nwhole point is like what's really cool\nabout this is like once you operate from\nThia there is no choice it just it's not\neven I I guess it's even the thing it's\nlike I'm not even it's not even that I\ndo things it's that things are happening\nyes that's weird way to describe it but\nthat makes the most sense and and I know\nit's hard for people to understand at\nthe same time I think that every person\nwho is listening to this has experienced\nwhat we are talking about theyve had a\nmoment in their life where things became\nclear and then it was uh how do we make\nthis happen as opposed to right choice\nwrong choice or it wasn't it wasn't\nabout it being the right choice or the\nwrong choice you abandon the concept of\nright or wrong and you just do the thing\nyou kind of know like deep within you\nthat this is like this is to be done you\nkind of know it feels right it kind of\nreminds me of what sometimes crisis\nsituations when there's a crisis\nsituation you just do without thinking\nyou just do your brain goes it's not\neven your brain it's this needs to\nhappen I'm doing this that crisis\nsituation feels it's not the same but it\nfeels similar in that way where it's\nthis is happening we're doing this and\nthe other parts of your brain go how do\nwe do it and then they figure out how to\ndo it and then you do it it's it's it's\na beautiful analogy the challenge is\nthat when some people enter crisis\nthere's two kinds of modes in crisis\nthat with ego and without ego so when\nyou are in a crisis and your ego is\nactive then it's the very opposite it is\nabsolute\ntorture because you're like what will\nhappen this will mean this and then this\nwill happen to me and then this will\nhappen to me and this will happen to me\nand then you spiral out of control you\nfeel overwhelmed and the crisis crushes\nyou the flip side is you're in a\nsituation like what what um Thor is\ndescribing where you remove the ego from\nthe equation right in the absence of ego\nthen suddenly you go into like you\nknow Chad mode where you're just like\nyou're crushing it and it needs to be\ndone and you don't think you don't worry\nabout the fact that it may not work out\nlike it may not work out you just accept\nthat and you have to act and this so an\ninteresting thing about that too\nactually that one I've had that many\nmany times in crisis situations\nespecially when you know there's like an\nemergency with the rescue or something\nlike that and it doesn't mean you don't\nhave emotions you just have them\nafterwards a lot of the times i' I've\nfound where it's like I need to put this\none to the side because it's going to\ncause a problem right now and it's like\nI've decided you know this this is what\nneeds to happen we figured out how to do\nthis and if I break right now none of\nthis is going to work so it's like in\nthis instance I need to wait right this\nneeds to wait whatever that is and I've\nI've I've had that happen a number of\ntimes yeah so that's very common in\nmedicine too so when we're dealing with\ncrisis situations you know we we have a\nspecific process we tell everyone set\nyour emotions aside from now for now and\nthen we'll do debriefs so we'll do uh\npostmortem debriefs and things like that\nlike like we have like we have time and\nspace to let that emotion come back into\nyour life which by the way is a very\nuseful technique to apply for normal\npeople which I don't think we do enough\nwe don't set aside space for our\nemotions in a particular formalized way\nwhich means that they have to like you\nknow it's like if I'm inviting my\nneighbors over for a Christmas party\nonce a year they don't have to show up\nrandomly to see me like you can set\naside a time and space for something to\nhappen and when you give that space for\nthat thing to happen it's beautiful what\nyour brain does so another great example\nof this is sometimes like when I I I'm\nworking with patients right as a\npsychiatrist doing Psychotherapy and\nstuff like\nthat I'll ask them like you know\nsometimes they'll notice something\nreally interesting which is that their\nlife is getting better but every time\nthey come to therapy they feel worse and\nthey're like I don't understand like I\nfeel so bad like we're I hear\ncrying but like my life is fine and I'm\nlike yeah that's exactly how it works\nwhat you've learned how to do is you\nused to cry every single day and now\nyou've learned how to push it all aside\ncome here take out the trash and then\nlike your trash can is empty for the\nrest of the week and you pile up that\nyou come here and then you feel bad and\nthey're like\noh and I was like we can continue like\nif this and then the cool thing is even\nthat stops eventually like they they\nlike once they figure that out I don't\nteach them that they they have to figure\nget out human garbage collection yeah\nyeah that's that's what that's what we\nare we're we're trash compactors you\nknow yep\num yeah I find that to be useful\nsometimes like it's it's definitely a\ntool kind of in that belt where\nunderstanding when it is healthy to move\nthat to the side to handle that crisis\nsituation but not to keep that\npermanently aside there's no that's not\ngood for you at all Y and I've had a\nnumber of situations like that we had\none um uh Vinnie one of the ferrets that\ncame in uh owner was like oh yeah he\nhasn't eaten in two days get there he's\nhalf the weight that a fair at his age\nshould be the owner is very clearly on\nmeth so house reeks of it horrible had\nto file a police report do all that kind\nof stuff and it was just Grim man like\nit just really messed me up but it was\nlike in this moment these are the things\nthat need to happen animal has like I\nhave to put on the happy face be like oh\neverything's okay get the animal from\nthe person make sure that everything\nfeels good call the police file the\npolice report put all the evidence in\nfront of that get the animal home like\nfigured out what we're going to do start\nfinding a way to make him so that you if\nyou have a person even any mammal\nactually that is uh not eaten in a\ncertain amount of time and you try to\ngive them a full meal they actually go\ninto a shock and they die yeah it's a\nhorrible thing anding syndrome yeah\nrefeeding syndrome that's exactly what\nit is so we had to figure out exactly\nwhat levels of food can he eat over that\namount of time to prevent refeeding\nsyndome because he would just like his\nvitals would crash and he die so trying\nto figure all that stuff out and then\nokay everything is handled let's go sit\nin the car and need a pie and cry you\nknow yeah no I mean yeah I I I think\nit's it's it's a huge problem that I I\nthink people you know we we push the\nemotion to the side which I I agree with\nyou is healthy but then you've got to\npay that price you have to you have to\nyeah like you can't you can't Dodge your\nkarma like that debt needs to be paid\nand you need to feel that negative\nemotion yeah yeah and I I've gotten very\ngood I think at knowing when it's okay\nto push that you know it's like this is\nIt's Only in a very critical situation\nlike a really crit like something could\ndie there's no coming back from the\nfailure on this one you could fail sure\nyou might learn something from it but\nthere's something that will break that\ncannot be unbroken in those situations\nthat's like okay now it's time to push\nthis aside for a moment handle it you\nknow and like you said with medicine\nit's the same I I I would I would say I\nwould add one thing to that so I think\nthat\nthat's\nperfect um and I think that you can't\ndiscredit your ability to deal with it\nlater so the ability to set something\naside is way easier when your brain\nknows that we can deal with this later\nand it won't be\ncatastrophic a lot of problems that I\nsee with people are that they keep\nsetting it aside keep setting it aside\nkeep setting it aside and then they\ndon't know that they don't have\nconfidence that they can deal with it\nwhen they open that\nbasement door that's full of negativity\nright it can feel so incredibly\noverwhelming and and that can also\nbecome kind of a self-fulfilling\nprophecy because the more that you let\nthings pile up the more objectively\noverwhelming they are when you try to\ntackle them so then you feel overwhelmed\nand so then you let things pile up more\nbecause you can't deal with it and the\nreason you keep on letting it pile up is\nbecause you can't deal with it and then\nthe more you let it pile up the more\nimpossible it becomes to deal with and\nso that's where like often times\nProfessional Health like with a medical\nprofessional can really go a long way\nlike so we're really good at helping\npeople deal with unsolvable things yeah\nI remember when I was when I was younger\nthat kind of felt like a pressure cooker\nyou know it's like it just keeps\nbuilding up building up building up and\nyou're like I don't even want to let\nsteam off that it could explode you I'm\njust going to leave it over there right\nand then you get another pressure cooker\nand another one then you're just and it\nwhat what I didn't realize at the time\nis like it's not just like you're\nputting something in a in a cabinet\nsomewhere and walking away You're\nmaintaining that thing there's energy\nthat goes into keeping that pressure\ncooker pressurized right every day\nyou're like I'm just going to spend\nmaybe I'm only spending 5% well maybe\nit's only 10% maybe it's 15% until\nyou're just buried with this spinning\nplate maintenance that you have going on\nand then you don't know what to do with\nthe damn thing right and that's I I felt\nthat before in my life and I I basically\ngot to a point where it was like you\nhave to let the pressure off and just\nsometimes that's awful sometimes it's\nhorrible going through that but if you\ndon't then you're going to be\nmaintaining that and paying taxes on it\nall the time absolutely it's\ndebilitating so one of the three biggest\nwillpower drains\nis emotional suppression so the more\nemotions that you're constantly\nconstantly constantly suppressing like\nit's amazing how people don't realize so\npeople will like look for motivation\nthey'll look for Drive they'll look for\npassion they'll look for like discipline\nand and literally like all you need to\ndo is is unburden yourself of all of\nyour emotional suppression because just\njust the maintenance it's like your\ninventory is full and then you can't\nloot anything like you can't you're like\nhow do I pick up this nice epic piece of\nloot you can't because everything's full\nso so maybe that's not the best analogy\nbut like there's a man there's a man\nmain cost huh it's like endless dailies\nso you don't get the raid sure yeah yeah\nyeah yeah same kind of thing you're just\nyou're just grinding for the same old\ncrap and not really making progress and\nand you just have to unburden your\nmind yeah know it makes sense it's I\nthink that's the scariest thing too is\nthat moment when you realize like oh\nit's coming out and there's nothing I\ncan do about it now and like that's\nthat's a scary thing especially if you\nhaven't practiced that you know you\nhaven't gotten used to feeling those\ntypes of emotions or even the fear of\nallowing yourself to feel that way or\nlooking vulnerable to others not\nrealizing that that's okay and even then\nthe the idea that maybe you do make\nyourself vulnerable to somebody else and\nyou do let those emotions out and they\nreject it you know there's so many\nthere's so many fears that go along with\nthat and I could totally get that and\nyeah that's just like everybody else I\nwent through the same things throughout\nmy life like I've gone through the exact\nsame things and I've just kind of\nlearned that it's okay right it's it's\nokay to just be like I'm just gonna I'm\ngonna have a time for a minute you\nknow yeah that's fine no I I think that\neven the language of going through\nsomething so I I think so many people\nget stuck because they avoid going\nthrough something they try to prevent it\nthey try to avoid it they try to keep it\nfrom hurting they try to practice in\nsecret or solve all their problems so\nthat they don't have to go through\nit you know I'll see this a lot with\num you know people who like just move\nfrom one relationship to another and\njust can't tolerate like being on their\nown for some amount of time and like\nsometimes you just have to go through it\nbut the the whole point of going through\nit is you end up on the other side but\nyou can't end up on the other side until\nyou go through it yeah I think the the\none thing the one caveat to that is I\nfound\nyou have to avoid circular thinking in\nthat where it's like this is bad so\neverything's going to be bad because\nthis is bad so everything's be the\nmoment you start feeling those emotions\nit's really easy to be like everything\nis awful and it's like no you can feel\nthese so that later you don't have to\nfeel them in the same way or they don't\nhave to Define who you are you don't\nhave to spend the maintenance on that\nanymore you can be different afterwards\nand that's okay you know like that that\nwas something I had to to work through\nas well was like realizing like that's\nit doesn't Define who you are as a\nperson you know yeah so I think there's\nthere's a very\nimportant thing there about see when we\nexperience negative emotion what really\nscrews us is the identity based\nconclusions that come from a temporary\nelevated emotion yep so like when we\nfeel a lot of negative emotion we can\nform a conclusion and then the problem\nis that\nconclusion stays with us even when the\nemotion goes\naway so that's where like you know and I\nI I think I think you're you're speaking\nto you maybe used to do that more and\nnow you do it less you recognize that\neven if you have negative thoughts in\nthis moment those negative thoughts are\nnot necessarily true for all time they\ndon't make a determination about\nyou yeah that doesn't hit me like that\nat all anymore uh I think when I was\nmuch younger it was like yeah I mean I\nthink everybody has those thoughts\ngrowing up though it's like oh no they\ndon't like me my whole life is over you\nknow like I got an F my whole life is\nover it's like I I think as you get\nolder you realize very quickly you're\nlike maybe that permanent record really\nwasn't that big of a\ndeal yeah like maybe I'll still be a\nperson afterwards and it doesn't really\nDefine me you know I I I so so yeah I I\nI love that phrase permanent record\nbecause like we get terrified I remember\nbeing terrified too of stuff going on my\npermanent record but I I don't think\nanyone reads the permanent record like\nno one reads the permanent record at at\nschool like I don't know I don't know on\nyour permanent record it's like you know\nit's like it's like when you apply to\nUniversity like I thought they were they\nwere going to send my permanent record\nbut you literally just request\ntranscripts yep\nthat's transmission the the school is\ntoo dysfunctional and the university\ndoesn't have the administrative\nbandwidth to look at everyone's\npermanent record or it's like it's weird\nI mean sometimes you can get stuff like\nin med school and things like that\nyou've got certain you know yes or no\nquestions and jobs where they ask you\nlike if you ever broken a law or\nwhatever but yeah I I I think it's like\none of the biggest skills and I think\nit's a skill that has to be learned so\nthe other challenge is that people can\nlook at you and they can say oh like I\nwish I was like Thor but you're you're a\nfinished product you're not or somewhat\nfinished your version 2.0 let's say\nrelease right and and that's a skill the\nability to separate teas up part I am\nfeeling this way now versus this is like\nan ego based conclusion that I carry\nwith me is like that's huge so just feel\nthe negativity and don't and wait 24\nhours to form conclusions about yourself\nthat's what I would like strongly\nrecommend yeah I mean to be real with\nyou I don't even I don't even see it as\nlike full release or anything like that\nlike I'm going to be learning stuff the\nrest of my life and that's a pretty cool\nplace to be MH like like quite frankly\nit's it's neat and uh the way that I\ngenerally see it is me as a person gets\nto learn who me as a person is over the\nrest of my life and that means I get to\nlearn about the things that I'm good at\nlearn about the things that I'm bad at\nlearn about things that I can improve\nlearn about things that you know maybe I\ndon't want to do and I get to be along\nfor that ride that's a pretty cool story\nman and I don't even know what it is yet\nso I get to read it the whole time\nthat's that's how I've always felt about\nthis stuff for a long time and it's it's\nneat cuz it's like it's all discovery\nthe whole thing is Discovery you\nknow yeah I really enjoy that yeah I I\ni' I'd strongly encourage you Thor to\nspend some time in the in between spaces\nbecause I I think that's where some of\nthe coolest Discovery happens oh yeah no\nI can I totally understand that it's\nfunny when you're the way that you're\ndescribing that is um something I like\nto do quite a lot is just kind\nof take away any type of tasks that I\nhave take away any type of um social\nobligation or technology or anything\nthat's in the way I just kind of let\nmyself think about stuff and I find that\nthat's kind of rare in today there's too\nmuch Doom scrolling and like I have to\nstay on social media and I have to I\nhave to do all these things like ah and\nthen you you do that until you pass out\nand you wake up with your phone stuck to\nyour face you know like just giving\nyourself even just 20 minutes a day to\njust stare into the middle distance and\nfigure out who you are is crazy\nbeneficial I completely agree so I I I\nthink we we see that it's interesting\nyou bring up technology because\ntechnology is destroying our in between\nspaces completely agree with that it is\nis taking away more than anything else\nit is taking away our time with\nourselves yeah so what I really love\ndoing and like one of my best\nproductivity hacks is pacing like not\nlistening to music not listening to a\npodcast just pacing when I don't feel\nlike working I get up in Pace and then\noften times when I'm done pacing I'm\nready to\nwork and it's kind of it's kind of funny\nbecause\nI think there's a number of people that\ndo that in video games as odd as that is\nlike run around in a circle in Delan\nthey're not really doing anything\nthey're just kind of like running around\nin a circle in darar doing nothing right\nnot thinking about anything not that's\nthat's a common thing yeah pacing in\ngames is a very common thing how how\nmany of you guys ran around in a circle\nin dalaran or Ogar or Stormwind just\nthere the city is huge though they just\np r\nCircle nope they're not even waiting for\na raid they're not waiting for anything\nit's just like I'm just going to run\naround in a circle there's a lot of\npeople that do this it's very common\nBehavior I've done it too I've never\ndone that it's it's it you'd be really\nsurprised look how many people have done\nit that's really all of chat is saying\nthat they do it yeah so what's going\nthrough your head are you like\nnothing sometimes nothing wow you're\njust kind of gone and you're just like\nI'm just going to run in a circle for a\nlittle bit sometimes you'll be talking\nto someone sometimes there's just\nnothing going on some people just like\ndoing that sometimes and I think that is\nsort of that in between space where\ntechnology is still involved but you\nreally only see that a lot of the times\nin multiplayer games that have downtime\nareas which are areas that are intended\nto be when you're not doing anything\nlike sitting in town it's kind of\ninteresting that's that's so wild yeah\nwild therapy exactly GTA 5 yeah people\nare talking about the same thing yeah\nGTA 5 I can kind of understand GTA 5 is\nis a game that I feel like you can just\nabsorb the ziance of the game yeah\npregame OverWatch that's another good\nexample it's just that jumping back and\nforth left to right that walking in a\ncircle in the in that area it's where\nthere's yeah it's areas where there is\nno objective and you are you are not\ncurrently tasked with doing anything and\nyou just kind of turn off for a little\nbit repetive action yeah\ncool well Thor any last uh thoughts or\nquestions I mean I know we've covered a\nlot of ground today and you know a\ncouple days ago\nno I think this is awesome man and I I\nalways have a blast coming and talking\nto you honestly yeah it's super nice\nyeah I I I think it's I really enjoy\ntalking to you I think it's like really\ninteresting to hear\nyour it feels to me like you've attained\na very high rank without following a\nmeta that I've been religiously\nfollowing so I'm I'm so and like that's\nwhat's cool about this is like I don't\nthink you need to learn this you can\nDiscover\nit so I really like listening to your\nexperience of stuff I think your impact\non the community is hugely beneficial\nand it's so interesting to look at what\nyou do through the lens of what I've\nlearned because I see a lot of these\nmechanisms of even the way that you talk\nto your community I'm not surprised at\nall that people in your community do\nincredibly well because I think you\nwhether you realize it or not you're\nbasically dissolving their ego for them\nright I didn't realize that was what was\ngoing on yeah that's the biggest effect\nyeah that I mean I don't know if it's\nthe biggest but like that's what I see\nright so even the ability to fail is ego\noriented reframing the way that you look\nat things to remove ego and I think\nthat's why people see this explosion of\nlike progress because once the ego gets\nthe out of the way like I want you\nall to just think about this for a\nsecond when you're living your life you\noften times know what the right thing to\ndo is you know that you're smart enough\nyou know that you need to do these\nsequence of steps but something within\nyou holds you\nback and we think it's willpower we\nthink it's a lack of discipline we think\nwhatever but no if you really pay\nattention it is going to be your\nperception of yourself what will people\nthink it'll hurt if I fail it it'll be\nyou telling yourself not to proceed\nbecause of\nXYZ and if you Lally look at it okay\nwhat what is the negative consequence\nthat you're you're worried about your\nmind doesn't think about it logically\nbecause it doesn't think oh like this is\na game Jam it's not like this goes on my\npermanent record right like the thought\nis absurd but your logic does not\nfunction properly there is some kind of\nfear or avoidance of\nemotion which by the way the ego and\nnegative emotion get are very tied hand\nin hand right so like like just the more\nyou remove yourself from the equation\nbecause what's holding you back it's\nyou remove yourself from the equation\nand you'll start to fly you're really\nwhat's weighing you\ndown and it's it's like amazing how\nyou've learned that for yourself\ninternalized it applied it and now you\nteach it to other people which I think\nis super\ncool well thank you and I I think I\nthink the thing that I really enjoy\nabout it is like I said before I like\nsolving puzzles and sometimes person's\nbiggest puzzle is them you know and I\nthink it's always them it's always them\nso then when someone brings me a puzzle\nlike that the um the best thing that I\ntry to do for that is to see how does\nthis person feel in this situation cuz\nyou can't really tell someone like you\nshould feel this way but you can be like\ntry to understand how they feel in the\nposition that they're in with the\nunderstanding they have the more\ninformation that I receive about the\nperson the more that I can understand\nlike how they feel why they feel that\nway the things that they're working with\nthe easier it is to sort of form that\nthat mental image of who they are and\nthen it's like well how would I break\nout of that if I was in that position\nand then try to hand them that you know\nand be like this might work you know\nyeah so I I I think that there there's a\nthere's a subtle really important thing\nin that answer which is that see when\nwhen someone loses confidence in\nthemselves they have all these beliefs\nright and then I think the key thing is\nthat a lot of the default thinking is\nlike oh this person is wrong so I see\nthat a lot when I'm working with people\nwho are suicidal who are like you know I\nhave no reason to live and the right\nanswer isn't hey here are all the\nreasons you should live that's\ninvalidating\nalso doesn't help you understand their\nsituation yep the the right answer is to\nadd more to the\nequation right it's not to try to remove\nthe negative necessarily like that can\nbe done definitely that's important over\ntime we want to do that but the first\nthing to do is like add more information\nand when when I see that a lot of people\nare like Oh I'm a loser because of XYZ\nright and it you can't change your past\nbut you can add additional experiences\nto your life that will change\nwhat's on the right side of the equal\nsign yep and and the real tragedy is\nthat when we feel like we're losers we\nstop adding more experience oh I had\nthis one terrible relationship and now\nI'm going to be alone for the rest of my\nlife because you won't have other\nrelationships and that's what's so\nparalyzing about it is the very thing\nthat will solve the problem is like\ndoing the the thing that you don't want\nto do is exactly what you need to do to\nfix the problem yep it's funny because I\ndrill that down as like a a single\nphrase a lot of the times it doesn't\nalways apply but when it does it's I\nthink it's quite funny is someone would\nbe like Oh I'm I'm a not a good artist\nnot a good artist I'm never going to be\na good artist I was like no you're not a\ngood artist yet yeah and that's that\nsingle word reframes the whole thing\nabsolutely it's like oh wait a minute\nokay yeah yeah I'm I'm with you it's not\nabout convincing someone no you actually\nlike you are like you're such a great\nartist my great artist and it's like\nthey'll just be like no I'm not like\nyou're now you're lying to me now I\ndon't trust anything you say absolutely\nso your artist your art sucks right now\nbut you're not a great artist yet it's\nfine it's it's wild but this reminds me\nof a sociopath that I once worked with\nwho was like you know and they were like\nyou know I'm a sociopath and I was like\nyeah I was like what are you going to do\nabout\nit right I'm not going to convince you\notherwise like yes that is correct but\nwhat does that mean about your future it\nisn't deterministic and some of the the\nbest people that I know are sociopaths\nthey like they make a very conscious\nnon-emotional decision that like I'm\ngoing to live a good life and I'm going\nto be add value to the people around me\nand I'm going to that is the way that I\nwant to live so just just because you\nare something today doesn't mean that\nyou have to be that thing tomorrow it is\nthe nature of Life forget about humans\nlife to adapt to grow to survive to\nimprove that's what life does that's\nwhat separates it from\nnon-life all right are you streaming\nbecause I'll I'll raid you I am not okay\nif You' like you could you could raid\nthe ferrets though okay let's raid the\nferrets um I am going to do this okay\nwhere are the ferrets it is ferret\nsoftware I will link you the channel\nhere you go um they are currently in\nfood mode but they're in the cage in\nsleep time so they sleep 18 hours a day\nyeah for those who don't know um the\nfair rescue is run completely off of ad\nRevenue so everything that we do for\nthem all of the medical everything is\nall done from ad ads you don't have to\nsub or throw bits or anything just\nwatching the stream does it we are\nraing hell yeah okay well thank you um\nthank you thank you for coming on Thor\ngood luck on your journey spend some\ntime and for those of y'all that are\nlike paying attention like spend some\ntime in the in between spaces if you\nwant to connect that whatever that\nTranscendent weird maybe it's just\nsubconscious and epogen memory fair\nenough\nbut that seems to be what works and take\ncare y'all thank you all very much for\ncoming today\n[Music]"
