    "transcript": "i i'm noticing that y'all are sort of\nalmost answering the question from like\na developmental psychology sort of way\nwhere we're focusing on parenting\nas to why they were the way they were\nbut i'm more thinking\nlike on a more existential level\ndo you all ever wonder about\nwhy your life is the way it is hello\nokay we're live all right\nwe live we're live\nno baby so we're gonna hop right in okay\nso welcome everybody how's everybody\ndoing today\nyou're doing good\nuh\ni i i i'd be kind of tired not gonna lie\nme too\nslight\noh someone's paying attention all right\nzell what's the not polite answer\nuh i have a lot of things going on\nokay trying to figure it out so uh if\nwe're being honest with ourselves i'm\ndoing fine but on the edge\nokay\nso\nwould zell have said that three weeks\nago\nprobably not on the first day you know i\ndon't think so so have been like wow\nthis guy's too real yeah right\nso so okay so it's interesting because\nmetric says this person is too real\nso how is zell\nlike\nhow have we made him more real what's\nchanged\nor we didn't make him more real but you\nknow how is he able to be more real\nby\nnot being polite just to make everyone\nelse comfortable okay like\nyeah and by opening up a little\nsure and what do we have to do that\nallows zell to be able to say something\nlike that\nwe have to bring it up\nin a you know\nkind of authentic way right\nyeah so like zell like did y'all i don't\nknow if y'all were kind of paying\nattention\nbut we're going to teach all over the\ncourse the next couple weeks to pay\nattention to all kinds of minimal things\nright so zell\nkind of put his toes in the water did\nyou all get that sense\nyeah\nwhat did he say do you all remember\nright you mean for right now or yeah\nlike what did he say when he's like i\nwas like how's everybody doing today\nright that's a polite introduction\nyeah polite answer i'm okay i'm fine\nand then i said i'm good\nand then he was like actually i'm fine\nbut there's a lot on my plate yeah right\nso he like started off polite just like\nash said and then as smirky kind of\npointed out he kind of put his toes in\nthe water and that's where we've got an\ninteresting\nopportunity so if we pay attention\npeople are going to say things like that\nthey're going to be like oh you know\ni've got nothing to complain about\ndoes that mean you're doing well\nand so sometimes what we've got to do is\nlike dig in a little bit\nright and then now we're going to see\nbecause we're going to go to our\nstandard check-in and things like that\nbut then the group basically has a\nchoice\ndo we want to try to support zell in a\nmore explicit way and the group also has\na concern\nbecause is it okay to ask\nwhy zell is borderline fine like what's\nthe he's at the edge of the cliff\nwhat's the cliff what's going on in your\nlife\nis this a safe enough place to discuss\nthat are we interested in hearing it are\nwe okay with zell sharing it\nright makes sense\nso i i think we've also heard from other\npeople so so part of i'll lay out a\ncouple of other things so at let's say\nwe do explore it with zell we're just\ngoing to preempt this i'm going to give\nyou all a road map for today as we start\nto ask zel questions how is zell gonna\nfeel the more we get into his stuff\nnervous\ngood\nwhy targeted yep i don't know good\nwhy\nwe're just focusing on him yes\nright we're putting you under the\nmicroscope yes yes\nhow do we help him feel like he's not\nunder the microscope\nmaybe we make it feel more like a\nconversation and less like an interview\nand how do we do that metric\num\nwe don't\ninterrogate him so much but\nfind ways to get him to share of his own\nvolition okay that's gonna be a goal\nruby\nmaybe we could share how we're feeling\nbut 100 and then ask them if they want\nto talk about it absolutely right so i\nthink metrics right so metric pointed\nout a very good word interrogation\nwhat are the hallmark what's the\nhallmark of an interrogation question\nafter question after question after\nquestion\nif we fall into that pattern then zell\nis going to be\nhe's going to feel under the microscope\nso this is where\ni don't think it is a coincidence that\nzerg girl and ash\nwere the two that sort of\nshared\nhow zell could potentially feel\nbecause i think if we got into y'all's\nstuff y'all would probably feel the same\nway\nright\nyeah so this is where what we can try to\ndo to take some of the heat off of zell\nas if something says something that\nresonates with us\nwe can share something ourselves and\nthen we're going to shift the\nconversation a little bit towards\nourselves but the key thing is since\nit's related to what zell is saying\nhopefully as we share a bunch of\ndifferent experiences the group can get\nan overall like global understanding of\nlike how to deal with these problems\nmake sense\nquestions yes\nwe don't necessarily have to do that i'm\njust kind of laying that out okay so i'm\ngonna be looking to and i want you all\nto understand what's your responsibility\nhere if it feels like something zell is\nsaying is resonating with you you can\nshare yourself\nthat'll make help zell feel more\ncomfortable and but we still don't want\nto ask him questions\nand then we'll sort of like as more\npeople start to share hopefully those\npeople will start to invite questions\nokay\nso before we jump into that um what i'd\nlike i love to start off with if people\nare okay is why don't we do check-ins so\ntell us a little bit about how the last\nweek or two has been for you\num\nuh do i guess we should also do\nintroductions because i think there are\nsome people here that haven't met each\nother\nso um i think\nuh you all feel okay with that so i\nthink especially zerg girl and probably\nmiss ashrocks need to\nbecause i think everyone else has met\nboth of them right y'all are the only\ntwo that so just introduce yourself a\nlittle bit um ash and zur girl and then\nyou know what you go by tell us a little\nbit about how the last week has been for\nyou\nups and downs\num and then\nthe last thing is we talked a little bit\nabout homework last week if you all have\nhad a chance to do it you can share what\nyou kind of learned who remembers what\nthe homework was\num\none or three expectations\nwhere is it rooted from and\na couple\ni forgot the rest but those are the main\npoints of our homework yeah so the\nhomework doesn't have to be followed\nliterally it's not graded\nwe also understand that y'all are\ncontent creators have jobs et cetera so\nyou may not have time for it the goal is\nto really solidify some of the\nunderstanding from the last week\nand does anyone want to start by sort of\nsharing a little bit about what did\ny'all take away from last week\nexpectation is the source of suffering\nokay\nthat's what my notes say\ni was just sat here trying to remember\nlast week i'm like huh\n[Laughter]\nyeah so it's it's okay to forget\nright we're not but also wasn't that one\nof the things is like actually paying\nattention to stuff and like taking\nnew small nuances in of when people talk\nand share and\nsure\nand so here's the thing ruby even if you\ncan't when put on the spot remember what\nwe talked about last week\nit's okay because some of it was sinking\nin and we'll build on it over time\nso expectation is the source of\nsuffering what do people think about\nthat i mean he had it's part of zell's\nnotes but is that just the wisdom of dr\nk or do you guys think that that is like\nactually it's not my wisdom but\nyou know\nwhat do y'all think about that\ni mean i think i feel like that but it's\nnot necessarily true\num\nso okay good\nyeah\nso good i feel like there's good\nexpectations and then\nunrealistic expectations\nokay yeah that's\nthat's kind of something that i kind of\ngot from the homework\nwas\ni wrote down like what my expectation\nwas but i was like by writing it down\nand showing someone else they could say\nwell that's a really good thing\nand\ni my expectation was that i'm\ni'm always expecting myself to be\nimproving and growing and learning and\nit's something i've had since i was a\nkid\nand most people would say that's a good\nthing but i think\nhealthy expectations is probably the key\nword\nwhen it comes to it because\npeople be like oh improving growing\nlearning that's all great not when it\nbecomes anxiety-inducing\num and overwhelming so yeah\nokay great so i think this is a great\ntime to segue into actual check-ins so\nwho wants to go first\ni can go first\ni'll take it i'll take the totem\nso\nexcuse me sorry hold on water\nwell let's see we chatted last thursday\nand the next day\ni was diagnosed with alopecia\ni've been seeing a lot of\nmy hair thinning over the last year and\na half so i figured it was going to come\nto that point but i wasn't sure but i\nfelt validated i went to the\ndermatologist\nand got the diagnosis i did a\nscalp biopsy\nso that's been interesting to recover\nfrom\nand it's kind of like okay black women\nare affected by this how do i\nfeel about this new diagnosis so i'm\ntrying to figure out how do i feel about\nit how do i move on with life with that\ndiagnosis and deal with it\nespecially after i get answers i'll have\nto figure out what's my next steps and\ni'm\nwith the thought of that i\ndon't want to think negative\nbecause\nit's something that just happened it's\nout of my control\nso i'm content with it i feel okay with\nit and it's something that's just a part\nof my journey now that i can share\nwith my community and the world and\nbring awareness to it what black women\nare going through so that's been\nthe number one stressor\nof the last week but i'm finding a\nbalance i'm just trying to figure out\nhow to make it into a positive thing\num to share with my community\nand\num every day since our last session i've\nbeen thinking about expectations and\ni say unrealistic for me because my\nexpectations were i expect to do my best\nin everything that i do\ni expect to treat myself with love every\nsingle day i expect to bring energy and\njoy to every space that i'm in and i\nthink\nthey're they're good expectations\ni don't think they're unrealistic but\nsometimes it can be if i don't feel up\nto it so\nyou can have your bad days and i think\nit's important to\ntalk about that as content creators you\ncan't be happy all the time so i'm\ntrying to focus more on that especially\nwith\ni'm grieving right now i've been\ngrieving since last year since october\nso it's like\ni have a lot of things that i have to\nwork through\nto be okay every day\ni wake up every day thinking about my\ngrandma you know um\ni don't want to cry\nbut it is something that i deal with\nevery day because it's affected me\nevery single\nday ever since she passed away and\ni'm sorry\ndon't be sorry um but it's just\nalways things piling up and i'm just\ntrying to\nset those expectations to wake up and\nbe okay with her passing and\ntrying to be happy this day so\ni have a lot to work on\nand i think grieving affects people\ndifferently so\ni'm working through it\nand i hope to learn from every single\none of you how you do with things\nbecause\ni\ni like how i started off and i was in a\ngood headspace and then i\nimmediately went to the negative and\nyeah that's kind of how my brain goes\ni'll be like oh i'm on a high path right\nnow and i'm like wait this is also\nstressing me out and i need to\nthink about how to deal with that but\nthen i'll run away from it i'm like no\nit's okay i'm thinking about happy\nthoughts about her\nit's fine i'm okay with this she's gone\nso\nyeah that's\nwhat i'm\ndealing with on a daily basis and on top\nof the new diagnosis\num figuring out how i can do better with\nit and spread awareness in the best way\npossible\nso i just try to utilize content\ncreation to\nbe the best version of myself still\nlearning how to be a creator and still\nlearning how to be a better human being\nall around\nso that's where expectations really\naffect me\nsometimes so i have to figure out a\nbalance between healthy ones and ones\nthat are realistic\nso\ndidn't want to cry sorry\nnothing wrong with it yeah i i think\neveryone in here is with you and like\nyou know if uh if we're feeling\nemotional or something you know i think\nit's\nbetter for us to let it out than versus\ntrying to keep it in and being you know\nquote unquote polite so\nyeah so thank you\ni just did my makeup so you know that's\nmoney\n[Laughter]\nso that was a little bit of my homework\nand\nhow i'm feeling so for the sake of ash's\nmakeup let's keep it positive today\nthank you for sharing this\nbut not false positive just\ncorrect\ngenuine positivity authentic positivity\nyeah yeah\ni remembered\nand what is that metric\nit's it's it's it's\nnot platitudes and and\num\nyou know just building people up for no\nreason when we could actually be\nsupportive for a cause as opposed to\njust being like you can do anything or\nyeah don't worry ash you got this\nthat that would be\nterrible\nyeah it's okay\nit sounds like temporarily but it has no\nconcrete progression\nyeah like it's okay to like\nembrace the negativity rather than like\nalways running away from it right at\nleast at least that's kind of the\nperspective that i see because like\num\ni know that it is\nyou know\nbecause when you try to stay positive so\nmuch\nas someone who tends to be positive all\nthe time and that's how people see you\nit can be um\na little\nnot daunting but kind of like\ni don't know you just kind of get like\nan entire new\nperspective when things aren't always\npositive and maybe you are dabbling a\nlittle bit in the negativity of a\nsituation\nbut i think\nyou know\nwhen yeah\nwhen it when\nwhen you're able\nwhen you're able you have the strength\nto embrace it to\ntackle it head-on\num\ni think there's a lot of like value in\nthat\ni wanted to say like you say you always\ngo to the negative\ni didn't feel like any of that was you\ngoing to the negative like\ni felt that you were just sharing\nhow what you're what you're feeling and\nwhat you're going through\nand\nalso by sharing\nyou are doing all of those things that\nyou were saying\nbecause by sharing you're helping other\npeople\nand you're sharing your story as well\nwhich is a very like human\nand if you were to have hidden those\nparts away then that would have been the\ntoxic positivity\nand so i really appreciate you for\nbeing\nso open and honest and and sharing like\nyou got me all choked up my my name\nmeans a lot to me as well\nit's\ni don't want to take too much time i'm\nsorry um\nyeah i think her passing just\nreally shifted my life\nand i'm still trying to deal with it\num\nif you want more details\num my mom was working for my grandma\ndoing in-home care for her taking care\nof her\nso that was her job and\nnow that that's gone i am head of\nhousehold which i'm totally fine with\nbut\nthe reasoning for it is like\nwhy did this happen um\nreally with her passing it's really\ntraumatic\ni don't want to go into details but\nit's just really traumatic i\ni don't want to cause any kind of\nvisuals for you guys it just\ni just found her so it's just still an\nimage that pops in my head\nand that's like my daily\nstress pretty much\nand i'm trying to work through it\ni am\ngoing to therapy and talking about it\num especially taking care of my mom that\nwas her mom so\ntry to stay strong for her and myself is\nit's a lot\ni think i'm\ndoing good because i'm\ncrying when i can but not i feel like\ni'm not crying enough because i keep\nsheltering my feelings and just trying\nnot to think about it but\ni think i need to talk about it more\nand just\ntalk\nvent it out i think i mean\nliterally coming back to\nyou know\ntoday's topic\nfeeling like you're not crying enough\nisn't that like an expectation that\nyou're putting on yourself\nas far as handling your grief\nyeah which\nmight not be\nyou know helpful to you right\nso\ni think i think if you're gonna cry\nyou're to cry like\ni remember\ni lost my grandfather and i\ni was just so weird about it because it\nwas very i was not close to him at all\nbut it was something that\ni was\nalmost expecting to maybe come to terms\nwith them one day because i'd been\nestranged from him for like\nabout 95 of my life\nand only in like the last couple years\ndid i actually like get to talk to him\nagain and then nothing really got\nresolved i remember one day in the\nsupermarket i was just\nbuying stuff and it reminded me of him\nand i just broke down and yeah i was\nlike oh i definitely got to deal with\nthis\nbecause i'm you know it's like\nkinking the hose it's it's\nyou don't have control when it snaps\nright so\num\nyeah\ni would i would\ndefinitely talk more\nand\nif you're gonna cry you're gonna cry\nso\nyeah thank you so much for sharing that\ni know i didn't really say much because\ni wanted to hear what everyone else has\nto say\nit's like my grandma she's i think she's\ngot alzheimer's or going through some\ndementia so it's been really hard to\nexperience that as well\ni think you have incredible composure\nand even just coming here to share that\nwith us and everyone else on the stream\ni have a lot of respect for you\nbecause i know if i talk about it more\nin detail i'm going to be a mess i\nprobably can't even\narticulate well so\ni definitely can't right now i'm like\nwell\nthe lashes are staying on so we're good\nyou're looking good\nyou look great\nbut yeah i just\nwanted to share that with you all\ni opened up another can of worms for\nmyself because\nthat's it's just\nit just keeps packing on and stacking up\nand i'll find myself doing really good\nfor\ntwo or three weeks i'm like oh we're\ngood we're we're great and i'm like nope\ni'm crumbling again\nbecause i'm thinking about her and that\nhow i found her and why it happened i\ntend to question\na lot why did this happen why did i have\nto do this why did i have to find her\nthis way\nso\nthat's another thing that doesn't happen\nas often but\ni tend to question\na lot\nof things that happen in my life\njust speaking into a void\ni don't know if anybody else can relate\nwith that oh yeah\nyeah\nwhy did this happen no answer you're\nlike okay let me try to figure it out\nor maybe it's best that i don't i just\ntry to do better the next time or\nwhatever maybe\nso\ni am done\nfor now\nright now so we'll give other people a\nchance to check in so awesome\ninteraction you know i think um don't\nworry by the way all about sharing too\nmuch or you know i know that y'all may\nbe concerned but keep in mind that\ni'll be keeping track of stuff right so\nthat's part of my role here is to make\nsure that people get the time that they\nneed\num and that we also acknowledged right\nat the you know the first group that\nlike particular days we're going to\nspend a little bit more time on\nparticular people which is totally fine\ni do think it'll be worthwhile if other\npeople want to take a moment to check in\nand\ntell us how your week has been if you\nmanaged to do the homework you know if\nthere were any kind of takeaways from it\nor lessons that you learned\num\nyeah\nso\nsince last week it feels like i've\nblinked and we're here at thursday again\num\nit's been one of those like\nweeks and i've done the thing that i\nnormally do which is\ni can do everything and\num\ni went to a festival at the weekend\nand i've still managed to stream my same\namount of hours and not\nreally take any time off um\nso\ni i think like today that hit me because\ni just\nwasn't in the right mindset for stream\ntoday and i should have probably taken\ntoday off\num\nand\nyeah then i didn't go to my like\npole class i normally go to like a\nexercise class before i come here\nso i did one good thing you know i even\nthough i paid for the class already like\ni\ni cancelled and and\nrelaxed before coming here because i\nknew that like\ncoming to talk after like knowing that\ni've over exerted myself and\ntrying to do too much and put too much\nexpectations on myself\nwould just end in me being really like\neither emotional for no reason um kind\nof like a little like mental burnout um\n[Music]\nor yeah not not focused or not get much\nout of this session\num\n[Music]\nso i did my homework on stream today\njust asking chat\nand i i only i picked i only found like\none thing\nto always be improving growing and\nlearning but i think it kind of covers a\nlot of things\nand\n[Music]\ni realized it's like come from\n[Music]\num\n[Music]\nas a kid i started dancing when i was\nthree\num\nand i've always been\nlike\ngraded as a person\num\non my performance and\nthe more i started to like think about\nthis\nso you'd get marks for like appearance\nyou'd get marks you know for you know\nhow your hair how neat your hair was\num\nand your uniform and\num\nhow you presented yourself and how\npolite you were and\nand\nall of these things would like you'd get\na grade\nand\nthat expectation to be always this\nshiny happy performing child\num\n[Music]\nkind of like it fell apart in my 20s\nwhen i actually just didn't turn up to\nan exam and didn't answer the telephone\num i actually went to work instead i\ndecided not to go to an exam and went to\nwork instead and ignored my telephone\nand\num\nyeah i didn't do like one of my final\nexams\num\nrebellious\n21 year old\num\nbut i i still enjoyed dancing and stuff\nand\ni realized that i've carried some of\nthat into my\nlife\nnow in my expectations of myself\num\nin my expectations of being able to do\nit all as well because as a kid\ni would get signed up to do like a\ngazillion different dance disciplines go\nto this school do that get this\nscholarship do this thing and\num\n[Music]\nthere were a lot of expectations for me\nas a child\num that went through into like my\nadulthood which then i've realized i've\ncarried on into my own expectations of\nwhat i'm doing\num\nso yeah that's kind of what i was\nthinking about today um but i had an\namazing time at the festival and i\ndanced i haven't like i found really\nlike sheltered i haven't gone out to\nlike a festival or something\nand just like\ni was doing around 16 000 steps a day\njust dancing\num and\nyeah\njust\nenjoying myself until i like ran out of\nenergy and meeting lots of really nice\npeople\nand\num it was a bit of a wellness festival\nso there was like some sound baths in\nthe day there was some like different\nthings going on in the day\nbut i just\nallowed myself to be for a weekend\nnot to be like the only events i\nnormally go to are\ntwitchcon\nstreaming events places where i have to\nbe\nruby the streamer\nand\nit was so nice to go somewhere where\ni bet if i asked people there if they\nknew what twitch was nobody would know\nand that was really nice and kind of\nlike a bit of a um\nlike i don't want to quit streaming\nbut also it was like oh hang on there's\nthis whole\nthing out there\nand there's people out there like\nconnecting and like i know you can do\nthat online but yeah it was a nice it\nwas a nice like\nquite literally putting my feet back in\nthe mud\num\nexperience like you know you can become\nquite clinical and quite in a little box\nat your computer and your world like can\nbecome like a fish tank\nonline and\nit's just the same fish like swimming\naround you check all the same social\nmedia\nand um i can yeah i feel energized but\nalso i know i've done too much and like\ni maybe should have taken\na me day which i'm very i find it very\nhard to take me days\num even if it's a day off um\nmy mods joke like\nif they see me online like this is a day\noff get off discord like get off get off\nhere what are you doing\nlike you better not be working i'll be\nlike i'm just researching this and\nthey'll be like why it's a day off i'll\nbe like i'm just going to do a bit of\nthis course over here that i'm reading\nabout and they'll yeah\ni find it very hard to not always be\nproductive so that comes back to my\nexpectations of\nit\neverything has to feel like it's getting\nsomewhere but i did\nnothing all weekend except for dance\nand that did get me somewhere so you can\nyeah it's like a reminder that i can\nhave enjoyment and stuff and it doesn't\nhave to be connected to twitch and my\nwork and\nyeah so yeah that was my week\nso i'm hearing that ruby was able to get\nsomewhere by going nowhere\nyes\nexactly\nthat's deep\nyou should have had some of the\nconversations this weekend\nwell\nabsolutely where you're dancing 16 000\nsteps a day\nthose conversations would have been deep\nwe made touchdowns\noh go ahead comment it's cool how like\nwhen you're\nwhen you i guess like envelope yourself\nin a whole different\num kind of performance like you can get\nso much out of it right whether it's\ndoing dance or\nfor me\nall throughout school like singing in\nchoir and like connecting\nmusically with my peers\num\ni have like some of my best experiences\ndoing things outside of content creation\nand you know i think like a lot of\npeople especially while i was in school\nwere asking me like the million-dollar\ngolden question like how do you balance\nhaving a life and then like having\ncontent creation and um like\nyou know and doing both of those\num\nand i don't know\ni don't see it as like a perfect balance\nbut it's something that like can be done\nand you can't you can't take the time to\nyou know invest in those other areas\nthat like personally interest you so\ni don't know\nlike hearing you share about like\nyour you know experiences outside of\ntwitch with like dance kind of made me\nuh reflect on those days and how\nimportant it is to like\nhave some kind of outlet or some kind of\nconnection to\nthat other thing that is like really\nvaluable to\nme or to\nthat other person i i i definitely think\nit's important so um\nthanks for sharing that\nah thank you yeah i i'm one of those\npeople that gets really emotional if i\nsee someone doing something that they\nare clearly passionate about\nit doesn't matter what it is\nif it's like a creative thing or they're\njust dancing or they're just singing you\ndon't have to be the best they just have\nto be like\ntrying to swear really enjoying it and\ndoing it do you know what i mean and i\njust love seeing people do that and i\nsaw so much of that this weekend and\nit just like reminded me that\neverything can get so\nstuffy and picky and\nand like yeah with especially online and\njust\nlike\ngo outside\nand just sing if you want to touch grass\nif you want to sing sing like if you\nwant to dance dance like i sound like\ni'm giving some big speech here but like\nlike smirky was saying it's\nit\nfeeds like a different part of you that\nsome people i think\ncan forget when they spend so much time\ncreating content\nyou've always got to think about what am\ni creating\nbut when you go and do those things i\nactually have come back and i'm like\neven clear about what i want to create\nabsolutely um so we'll talk a little bit\nabout that i just want to kind of\nacknowledge the time so we've been doing\nthis for about 35 minutes and we've\nchecked in with two people\nso we also have to decide as a group do\nwe wanna i think it's good to do\ntangents we should just be aware of\nwhether we wanna check in with people or\nwe wanna go off on tangents how do\npeople feel\ni don't mind the tangents personally um\nand i also\nwant to make sure everyone gets the\nchance to check in too so it's just like\ninternal conflict for me at least yeah\ni'm i'm okay\nsame so so what i'll do today is let's\ntry to\nhave a little bit more focus check\ncheck-in make sure we give everyone a\nchance to check in\nand then what we'll do is sort of like\nthere are a bunch of different useful\nthemes that we can kind of dive into\num and and so then we'll kind of like\nput that to the group and sort of pick\none particular thing\nso it's also nice to have tangents and\nat the same time\ni also think if we do focus the\ndiscussion like if we kind of pick\nsomething and and work with a little bit\nmore intention\nthat we can sort of learn something that\nwe can kind of take away\nwhich\nalso has to be balanced with sort of\nlike sharing and getting things off our\nchest and things like that so why don't\nwe have other people kind of check in\ni can go since i was talking just a\nmoment ago i feel like it flows well um\nuh it's kind of interesting for me\nbecause i've always like associated\nthe idea of expectations as like this\nkind of\nnegative idea or negative thought like\nas as it's like um\nyou know if you have too many\nexpectations on yourself you can burn\nout you know it can result to all these\ndifferent things so\ni mean like i certainly do put\nexpectations on myself\nat times especially like you know being\nin school is one thing but streaming as\nwell\num but i guess i've always like kind of\nsilently nodded at them rather than\nbeing like yeah like i have all these\nexpectations and this is how i want to\ngo about it because i i guess\nmaybe it's on the topic of avoidance i\nguess um just like i don't know i've\nseen it as this like negative theme for\na while but i just kind of like put that\nto the side when i was like thinking\nabout you know just straight up all\nthings you know to the side because i\noverthink a lot so just putting all that\nover here and being like okay in this\nmoment like you know what are my\nexpectations um and\ni guess like a couple things that come\nup\njust\ni want to you know inspire others to\nlike be inspiring with their lives and\nthe people around them um so i want to\nmake sure i do my best and\nyou know uplift\nuplift\nboth myself as well as others and then\num i also you know just want to make\nsure that whatever it is i'm creating\ni'm truly having fun with it\num that you know because the whole\nreason i started streaming getting into\ncontent creation is because i just\nthought it would be fun when i was\nplaying toontown to share my own\nexperiences with other people and\nthat was that was the baseline that was\nit um and it's so easy to lose sight of\nit so\ni kind of like\num not like hammering in this\nexpectation but just like reminding\nmyself every now and then\nof like\nyou know why i started it um\nwhy i started getting into streaming in\nthe first place\num\ni think it kind of just sets the stage\nfor\nso many other things whether i'm doing a\ncharity fundraiser or i'm just chilling\nout with my community um you know it's\nkind of like the backbone to everything\nso\nyeah that's\nuh those are my i guess expectations\nthat i came up with cool thank you for\nsharing\nwho's next i can go next um\ni can share\nwhat my week\nwhat my weeks were like\nuh apologies for missing the last time i\nwas at a work off site but\npast couple weeks i was going to pax\nwest in seattle and then after that i\nhad to go to work in san diego like\nimmediately after seattle so it's just\nbeen really hectic and ever since these\nsessions started i think i only streamed\nlike two or three times even though i\ntold myself i was gonna\nstart up streaming again after work like\nhaving a schedule going\nbut i feel like i've been kind of\noverwhelmed because i was moving from\none city to another so just setting up\nmy whole\nstation here and then dealing with\nmoving\nand then all these events that were\nhappening\nand during pax derude was playing at one\nof the nightclubs and i was very excited\ni was like this is great timing there's\nthe rude it's the gamer's meme and\nthere's packs happening and i was just\nso tired i couldn't even go\ni thought that was so sad\nthe stars aligned for that night and i\njust couldn't make it i went to bed at\nlike 10 p.m or something\nso i'm kind of the opposite of you all\nthat i could not really get back to\ncontent creation\nand then for this week i just had so\nmany work meetings and at the end of it\ni was like i'm so exhausted i just can't\nplay starcraft i can't really talk or do\nanything i'm just gonna\nwatch tv shows and veg out or something\num\ni think i just need to get my [ __ ]\ntogether\nso that that's been my week\nmy weeks\nokay\ni'm kind of curious\num and by the way so for miss ashrocks\nand zerg girl can y'all please just\nshare with us what y'all prefer to be\nwhat y'all prefer to go by\nin terms of how we should address you\noh\noh sorry\nmiss ash or ash whatever is shorter and\neasier for y'all\nthose work for me\nyeah whatever is easier um i think zerg\ngirl is kind of a mouthful so kathy is\ngood okay\ncall me cathy\nso i'm i'm curious when y'all hear kathy\nsay get my [ __ ] together\nwhat do you all hear\ni see zell smile smile knowingly\ni i was gonna ask like what does that\nmean like what is what do you what do\nyou mean by getting your [ __ ] together\nbecause i think like it means so\nit's uh you know we talked about it week\none talking about our ambiguity and\ndigging in a little bit so\nyeah\nthere's a lot more things i didn't\nmention\ni feel like it's kind of\nmacroing my life like i signed up for a\nnew credit card so i have to look into\nthat it was all this paperwork that came\nin i was like i'm gonna read this later\nso i procrastinate on that there was a\nhealth appointment that i had to forego\nbecause another meeting was scheduled\nand then just even missing\nthis group session um i'm so i'm so\nsorry producers i didn't even give\nnotice because i was just so distracted\nwith everything so that's why i'm like\nokay i need to\nyou know be more on top of things my\nscheduling like\num doing the things that i want\njust just trying to balance everything\ni hope that makes more sense\nmaybe we'll dig in a little bit\nlet's dig in a little bit later let's\ngive people a chance to finish checking\nit i think we've got metric and zell\nleft right\nyou want to go or i'll go\ndoesn't matter to me uh okay i'm okay\nwith it either\num i'll go uh\nso uh\nlike almost two weeks ago i\naccidentally\ndamaged a tendon in my foot that almost\nmade me thought i like fractured it or\nbroke it or something and i couldn't\nwalk for\na bunch of days and uh\nit was it was very painful i couldn't\nsleep but\nmy folks were like how about you come up\nhere and put your foot up because i live\non the third floor of a house and it's\nall stairs so\nyou know having a\nwrecked foot wasn't exactly easy to deal\nwith on my own which it worked out\num and i ended up reading four books\nwhile it was up there because i can't\nstream while i'm up there and there's\nnothing else to do so i felt really good\njust\nreading because i feel like one thing\nthat died when i started streaming was\nactually reading um\nthat that was actually really cool to to\nget that back and i was worried that\nlike my reading speed had gone down\nsince\ni used to i used to just consume books\num\nand then like initially when i started\nback up again i was like why is this\ntaking so long\num\nam i stupid now and then eventually it\njust\nuh\nthe books just like osmosed through my\nskull or something so i'm i'm i'm glad i\nhave that back um\nbut yeah uh and then i finally got back\nmonday\nno tuesday tuesday tuesday and then i\nhad my first stream back yesterday after\nlike ages and it felt really good and it\nfelt like i didn't even like miss a\nstride at all so\ni'm really happy about that and i can't\nwait to\nto just hit the ground running with like\nan actual working foot i came back to it\nanyway um\nso\num\nas far as like expectations and stuff i\nthink i have a few that kind of messed\nme up and as far as like\nthey they go against each other uh\nso\ni kind of\none thing i do is i i expect to\nprocrastinate on anything that i intend\nto work on\ni know that\nit's not gonna happen right away um\nit's that idea of like\ni don't expect to wake up tomorrow and\nlike adopt all of those habits that are\nsupposed to like\nautomatically fix my life\num and even then i'm gonna wreck that\nlike it's gonna be even slower than\nother people would adopt it so\nuh\ni'm really good at waiting till the last\nminute until it's absolutely critical\nand then like possibly even begging for\nan extension on whatever work it was\ni'm i'm so good at that it's a talent\nand i it shouldn't be um\nso\ni know that's something that keeps me\nfrom seizing opportunities\nuh or even\npushing ahead for myself\nand the other thing is\nand this probably\ngoes against the idea of like\ndreaming in general or like putting\nyourself out there\nis i i thought about this really hard\nis that i expect\nto be put down\nor like made fun of or\nlike i expect a negative reaction from\nthe things that i do and say\nuh\nin in groups\nor\nstreams and stuff and it's it's it's\nreally weird because like\ni fostered this really caring community\nand everyone's really nice to me and\nstuff and it's great\nbut\ni i always have like these hairs on the\nback of my neck that go up just ready\njust ready for somebody to like be\nbrutal to me and it's not because\ni don't trust them it's it's a matter of\ni i had to think really hard i spent two\ndecades of therapy\num\nbecause of my father he was an extremely\nviolent man who never um\nadjusted to life in canada or the first\nworld really after immigrating here\nand um\nhe kind of saw\nfamily as like the wife stays at home\nyou marry off the daughter and the son\ntakes up your work\nand uh it it\ni i was not following his footsteps\nbecause i was kind of an egghead still\nam\nbut uh\nhe he didn't even like the day that i\ngot glasses because i couldn't see um\nand uh\nso\nhe was particularly violent he stopped\nbeing violent with me when i got bigger\nthan him\num and then\none day i just couldn't take it anymore\nand uh\ni kicked him out of the house when i was\n16\nand\nthat was the only fight i've ever been\nin um\nand i packed his bags for him and threw\nhim on the driveway and he's gone\nuh\nso\ni don't have a relationship with him or\nanything but like those 16 years were\nconstant like\nshame and abuse and i think i've sort of\ninternalized that to like\nyou know all these waking moments\nof\neven trying to be happy or or\nentertain or whatever\num\nlike i expect somebody to just come out\nof nowhere and be like well you suck or\nthat's not gonna happen or\nwhy would you even try because that's\nhow i grew up right so\nyeah\nanyway\nsorry to bring down the moon\nyou're not bringing down the mood\nhas everyone gone yet oh i guess it's\ni guess it's me\num austin\nso all right i uh\nthe check-in part um\nso anyways uh like i\nright now it's just a big transitional\nperiod in my life so\nit's like the time to start uh\nreassessing a lot of things taking a lot\nof self look at stuff um\nand uh\nyeah it's been it's been difficult so um\njust kind of reassessing everything in\nmy life really just like from the ground\nup and redefining myself and\num\nthat's just been kind of the\nthe big theme and like on top of that\nit's like i i'm starting to think about\nyou know working a full-time job again\nuh and\nlike making content creation maybe a\nsecondary thing\num also moving sucks you know i you know\nlike\nwhen uh\nor kathy uh you were talking about\nmoving i was like i hate moving moving\nis the worst thing in the world um\nso yeah i uh i\nthey're just a lot of stuff physically\nmentally emotionally everything so\nthat's my check-in um i know i was being\nvague there but uh\nthey're just some stuff i'm not really\nready to share quite yet um\nand then\nmoving on to expectations uh\nso\nfor me\nmy expectation\nis i always want to be the best like\npokemon song i want to be the very best\nlike in everything that i've ever done\ni want to be the best like oh i pick up\na new video game i better be like top\none percent uh if i play like sports i\nwant to be mvp i if i\nsing a song i want to be the best singer\nat that song i want to be the best\nguitarist i want to be the best\nviolinist i want to be the best at\neverything i do like it's like a\nit's like an all-consuming thing and i\nknow where that comes from because like\nyou know i was just pushed super super\nsuper hard as a kid you know kind of\nclassic scenario immigrant family it\ncomes down to the us and\num\nand especially being korean like the\nkorean education system is just about\ngrinding grinding grinding grinding\nbeing\ncompetitive as possible um\nyou know so like i go to school and then\nmy parents have well it was really my\nmom who had like extra textbooks for me\nto go into and stuff i think the funny\nthing was that my parents had nothing no\nidea how to educate children like my\nparents had to arrange marriage they\ndidn't know what the heck they were\ndoing and so all they knew how to do was\nto just push me in whatever direction\nthat i was able to go into\nand and so that turned into like\nme doing sports me doing\nacademics at any rate possible like i\nwas in a i was in an accelerated program\nthat was like meant for a little bit i\nthink older kids but i went in at the\nminimum age so i start i stopped i i did\nmath i did calculus by the time i was in\neighth grade and i did multi-variable uh\nninth grade like i was done with college\nmath by the time i went into high school\nand then\ni was a violin competitor so i competed\nnationally uh in violin\ni was less good at sports because i'm\nnot like a big dude so i played soccer\nbut even in soccer my\nmy club\nteam made it to state and so did that\nlike it was just competition all my life\njust\nbe the best be the best be the best and\num\nmy parents were just doing the best they\ncould but like you know\nculturally and just from them too\nthat's a whole other story um with like\nhow my parents kind of\ndidn't know how to do\nanything really and so i sort of had to\neven though they were pushing me\nthis hard they\nweren't actually helpful to me right\nlike even though they can throw these\ntextbooks in front of me and say like oh\nyou have to practice this much violin or\npractice this much whatever\nthey don't play violin they don't know\ncalculus they just knew that if they\njust push me uh you know you you just\nthe kid does it and so for me like um\npart of the expectation is like my own\nself-sufficiency i know\ni think it was last week or maybe the\nweek before we talked about like you\nknow things that i want to work on which\nis like asking for help well turns out\nthat was a learned like behavior for me\nto never ask for help because i've never\nhad anyone to rely on uh in my life and\nlike my growing up i was also very poor\nso i knew financially like i had to take\ncare of myself and\num it's different now my parents\nactually are doing pretty decently good\nfor them um\nbut like i\nyou know i i just it was always just\nabout\nfiguring out things for me and so now as\nan adult\ni yeah i just have this expectation and\npart of it isn't on my own because like\ni like being good at things so i think\nthere it isn't just like\nthis forced expectation that uh that\nevery like came into my life i guess\nlike just\ni\ni want to be there too and then like i\num\nanother expectation is just about like\nfinancial stability being like\nindependent and\nyeah\nso that's kind of the nutshell\nokay to the korean parents just real\nfast\nyeah i mean it's like\nas classic as it gets and but the devils\ni think in the details i think that's\nthe part that was kind of funny about it\nis just like how much they just didn't\nactually understand because i don't\nthink they were really ready to be\nparents like yeah like i said they had a\narranged marriage and then\nuh\nlike literally my grandparents were like\nhave a kid and so like nine months later\nthere i was so my parents had known each\nother for a year and a half maybe by the\ntime they had me and like\nyeah so when did you sleep\nso i also had really bad um\ninsomnia as a kid like i normally just\ndidn't sleep very much it wasn't until\nlike college where i started to have a\nmore normal sleep um\nthing i i got sleep testing done uh\nrecently too\nyeah god that's crazy\nkathy i'm curious if there was something\nthat resonated with you about zell's\nupbringing that he was sharing\nyeah the korean parents they're just\nlike oh why aren't you doing well in\nschool there's all these people here\nthey can't even speak english and\nthey're getting better grades than you\ni'm like thanks mom that made me feel\namazing\nthanks mom very cool\nyeah so\nit's just tough\nso we've got a couple of choices all\nright so we're almost about an hour in\nwe've got half an hour left\nso i i'd like to\nwow so\ni'm just trying to think about can i\nthink for a second\nyes of course\nso the challenge is that there's so much\nto talk about\nso i'm going to just start spitting\nstuff out so first of all\ni want to point something out\nso metric was like sorry for making\nthings\nlike toning down the mood and everyone\nwas like you didn't tone down the mood\nlike what did patrick do to the mood\nabsolutely nothing\nit's hard it's hard when you say\nsomething and you're like oh man who\nwants to say anything after that like\nwhat do you say after that that's that's\nthe part like i'm i'm gonna go out on a\nlimb here and say that a lot of y'all\nhave said stuff\nright whether it's kicking out your dad\nat the age of 16 whether it's\nyou know\ndoing violin competitions i thought he\nsaid violent competition so i was like\nwow like\nreal like\ncage match kind of stuff here\ni've heard a lot of things about korean\nparents but never whenever quite that\nand then also we're hearing about\nyou know kathy has a loved one who's got\ndementia\nash has\nhas lost someone and has just been given\na diagnosis like\ni actually think a lot of y'all are\nbringing down the mood\nso here's the wild thing\nis that okay\nyeah yeah so we have to talk about these\nthings right be comfortable so so we\nhave\nabsolutely like we have this reflexive\nreaction that i'm not allowed\nto bring down the mood for anyone else\nbut i mean what what the [ __ ] do you\ncall it when you have a violent dad that\nyou have to kick out of the house at the\nage of 16. like\nyou know that's not fun or exciting\nand this is the challenge with\nnegativity as we try so hard to block\nnegativity that like you don't have to\nblock it like my question is so so many\nof y'all\nneed to be better\nkathy's got to get her [ __ ] together\nash has to be positive\ni try to think about the good things\nwhen it comes to my grandmother\nzell has to be like straight up perfect\nright\nand like is it okay to not be okay\nlike everyone's trying to be okay\nand y'all are nodding your heads as if\nthe answer is yes but i don't think the\nanswer is yes like think about it for a\nsecond\nyeah i was like\nlike i had to catch myself i was like\ni'm about to say yes but it's so\nautomatic like something i always tell\npeople but like\nthink about it right right so i'm gonna\nask y'all\ndoes kathy need to get her [ __ ] together\nyes\nyes therefore it's okay it's not okay\nfor her to not have her [ __ ] together\nright\ndoesn't ash need to get over her\ngrandmother who died a year ago\nzell or at least\nwell i mean i i would just feel terrible\nfor her if if you know it\nate away at her for the rest of her life\nlike i think coming to terms with it in\nsome way that would be yeah right so so\ni was like i didn't want to say yes but\ni wanted you to get better like feel\nbetter\nyeah i don't think getting over the\nright word good right so so i'm remember\nmy my my aspect is that i'm purposefully\nhyperbolic and i want you all to push\nback\nyes\nright but like\ni'm almost i'm very confident that there\nare times in ash's life\nwhere her mind produces the thought you\nshould be over this by now\nright absolutely\nthere are times where just like kathy\nshe says i gotta get my [ __ ] together\nthere are times where just like zelle\nwho's at the cliff which he's not by the\nway thank you for telling us that you're\nnot ready to go into it yet totally fine\nreally love that limit setting\nright so like\nth this is one theme for today\ni think a couple of things so we talked\na little bit about\ni almost want to say like we can just\ntalk about struggling\nbecause i think something that we\nhaven't really talked about sort of\nquite as explicitly like we recognize\nthat people are struggling but like what\ndoes it mean to struggle what is your\nstruggle actually like can you tell us\nabout that\nanother thing that we can talk about\nthis is also a little bit off the beaten\npath not part of our original curriculum\nbut we can talk about meaning\nand this question of like\nwhy\nis this happening to me\nand there's some very interesting\nscience behind that question and that\nexploration\nit's not something that i had\nanticipated because frankly i didn't\nknow about y'all's backstories\nbut now that i hear about your\nbackstories like there's a lot of stuff\nto learn about\nmeaning and like\nwhy\nwas\nwhy did zell have the parents that he\nhad why didn't kathy have the parents\nthat she had\nwhy was she destined to be in a city\nwhere darude was playing and she was too\ntired to go\nyou know\nor ash who's struggling with diagnoses\nand stresses and stuff like that and\nthat story by the way we haven't heard\nthe full story yet right there's a lot\nmore to learn there about relationship\nwith parents and alzheimer's dementia\nlike there's a bunch of stuff to talk\nabout\nso i'm i'm going to kind of put it to\ny'all so we can sort of oh and then the\nfourth thing\nis i feel like at some point we're going\nto have a have to have a frank\nconversation about how we feel about\nourselves\nso like\ni i don't know how else to put it i mean\ni don't know if that makes sense i can\nexplain it more if you guys want but\nlike i have a feeling that\nand that's where we got i don't know if\nwe're ready for that if we're if we\nleveled up enough to where we can have\nan authentic conversation\nbecause what's going to happen is if as\nwe really start to get into it about how\nwe feel about ourselves the group has to\nbe ready to listen to it and not shut it\ndown\nso i'll i'll put it to y'all in terms of\nhow we want to spend the remainder of\nthe time we can sort of\ndig into\nhow we feel about ourselves we can dig\ninto\nmeaning\nwe can dig into a couple of these other\ntopics like grief loss\num\nand i even forget what the other stuff\nthat i said at the beginning was but oh\nyeah just generally speaking like\nheaviness and that it's okay to be heavy\nand it's okay to not be okay\nwhat are you all feeling\ni want to\ndive into meaning\nand and how the yeah the path of how you\nwant to talk about that among\nus all here\ndr k okay\npeople have like\noh can i ask like because meaning just\nsounds kind of broad yep exactly\nand the grand scheme of things so\nlike because are we gonna focus it from\na content creation angle or are we going\nfrom a general perspective\nyeah that's a great question so\nhere's what i would propose\nsince we've got only about 20 minutes\nleft\nwhat i would really propose is that next\nweek we're gonna do more focused dives\ninto meaning and people's experiences i\ndon't think we have quite the time to\nopen that up and this week what i'd\nprobably do is maybe ask a couple of\nquestions but then in about five or ten\nminutes i'd share some perspectives\nand i'd offer some\nkind of like educational stuff about the\nscience\nof meaning and narrative in someone's\nlife\nso\nif that kind of makes sense just given\ntime so i think we do exploration next\nweek but we can frame things this week\nwith some explicit teaching\ni think that sounds good that sounds\ngood to me okay so i'm going to start\nwith somewhat targeted questions okay\njust a couple of like questions\nwhy does stuff happen\nlike why\nwhat do y'all think life\nyeah but because i exist\ni feel like my one of my friends put it\nbest like when i was\ni always felt like i was on the back\nfoot because it would always go against\nmy plans or things i was trying to do\nand she told me like life is a thing\nthat happens when you're making plans\nso\nit's just\nyou're you're basically\nyou're\ntrying to strategize your next day but\nyou don't even know if you're gonna get\nhit by a car tomorrow so like\nyou're just rolling with it basically\nor trying your best to yeah but what\ndetermines\nhow life happens\nso like you\noh okay\nso so that's one perspective\nright so i i'm gonna\nchallenge that perspective a little bit\nso like i'm gonna put myself in\ni don't know if it's just\nyou know i'm the child of immigrant\nparents as well so i can sort of i'm\nsure that my experience is somewhat\nsimilar to metrics because i think we're\nboth indian but yeah um\nyou know i think i resonate a lot with\nzell's experience and and kathy's\nexperience as well\nand like i'm imagining that they asked\nthemselves when they were growing up why\nare my parents this way\nwhy can't they be different\nlike did y'all ask yourselves that\nquestion\noh yeah\nso what was i i'm curious you don't have\nto have the right answer i i really want\nto know though what was the answer that\nyou came up with\nit doesn't have to be rational or\njustifiable or defensible\ni mean for like the way i always thought\nabout it because like i feel like i've\nmore or less come to terms with my\nparents in my like upbringing and\nthey just did the best they could based\noff their own experiences and i think\nthat's kind of like this\ncycle that happens right you know where\nyour parents\ndid what their parents did for them in\nhopes that that was good for them and\nthen that just kind of continues down\nthe cycle and then the why a lot of it i\nthink\ncomes down to just existentialism a\nlittle bit where like i think people\nwant\ntheir offspring to do well\nwhat whether\nlike the things that they're doing to\ntheir children is for that like actual\ngoal or not like\nthat's their intent\nuh and so i think\nlike why things happen just kind of\ncomes down to well they want the best\nfor their kids they just are doing\nthings based off their own experience\nand knowledge that they have as best\nthey can okay\nin my experience it wasn't really like\nthat because\nmy both my parents came from very\nabusive homes\nlike\nin from in other countries and they both\nimmigrated at the same time and\nmy mom made sure\nto get\ntherapy and come to terms with\neverything that happened to her\nwhereas my father\ndidn't do anything to\nrecognize what was going on with him um\nand it always blew my mind when he was\nwatching tv we would like watch sitcoms\nor whatever\nof like happy families\nand\nhe could never like\nunderstand\nor at least put himself in that\nsituation like well this family isn't\nlike this why are we watching\npeople on tv that are acting in a\ncompletely different way like\nit always\nsort of the disconnect blew my mind so\ni mean i think in most cases people try\nto do the best for their kids but\nfor him i don't know it might be a\nlittle laziness or something or\ni don't know kathy what about you\nhonestly i don't think i thought that\ndeeply\nwhen i was young at that time but\nlooking back now i can see why they were\nlike that i was a first child they had\nno experience\nthey had me kind of young\nlike\nlooking at other people have children\nearly i'm just like i can't do that i\ndon't have time i just don't know how to\nraise a kid\nso yeah when i was young i wouldn't know\nso i didn't question myself like that i\ni i'm noticing that y'all are sort of\nalmost answering the question from like\na developmental psychology sort of way\nwhere we're focusing on parenting\nas to why they were the way they were\nbut i'm more thinking\nlike on a more existential level\ndo you all ever wonder about\nwhy your life is the way it is\nthere was a big bang and then cosmic\ndust and then we crawled out of the soup\nand\nall that stuff but\nyeah\nyeah what\nyeah\nokay so\ni'm noticing that the question is hard\nto tackle which is exactly why we're\ntalking about it so let's start with a\nlittle bit of science\nso people are kind of wondering like\nokay what's the meaning of life\nright\nand so i don't know if you all follow a\nparticular religious tradition so i have\ntwo major biases that i'll sort of share\nright now when it comes to how i'm gonna\napproach this the first bias is a\nscientific one so there's actually like\nresearch that we're about to go into\nabout like\nmeaning\nand how human beings the role of meaning\nand purpose and crap like that in\npeople's life and like how you find\nmeaning because the cool thing is\nscientifically we actually kind of have\nanswers around this\nthe second thing is going to be that i i\ncome i was raised sort of in the hindu\ntradition but that really didn't mean\nmuch to me and then i spent a couple\nyears studying to become a monk and i\nfound the stuff that i learned that's\nbasically sort of a perspective from the\nkarmic religions so the karmic religions\ni'm referring to basically hinduism and\nbuddhism in their various offshoots\nthey have some interesting perspectives\naround karma and things like that which\nif you all want to learn about that and\neven some of the things that i kind of\nteach in terms of the correlation\nbetween expectation and suffering those\nthat kind of thought originated\nfrom that tradition although you could\nmake strong arguments that it was\nindependently discovered elsewhere so\nstoicism for example in greece and\nthings like that that these are things\nthat people have like discovered in\nmultiple places\nso let's talk about science so when you\ntake someone with trauma\nokay so i don't know if that applies to\nanyone here\nbut when you take someone who's gone\nthrough a traumatic experience there's\nactually some really interesting data\nthat people who are able to make meaning\nout of that experience are the ones who\ndo better so there's research on this\nthere's a cool kind of budding field of\npsychiatry and psychology called post\ntraumatic growth so everyone has heard\nof ptsd we all know that people will go\nthrough particularly traumatic\nexperiences but the really interesting\nthing is not everyone who goes through a\ntraumatic experience winds up with ptsd\nsome of them actually like wind up oddly\nlike stronger better more confident\nthemselves and that's the research into\nsomething called post-traumatic growth\nand what we've essentially discovered\nfrom post-traumatic growth is that when\ni have a sense of identity\nsomething happens to me and it shakes my\nsense of identity\nso for example if you look at abuse\ntowards young children so there's some\nreally interesting research here where\nas a young child i have impaired theory\nof mind and what theory of mind is is\nthis the acknowledgment that other\npeople exist so when i'm like six months\nold i don't understand that there are\nother human beings that exist that have\nindependent thoughts and feelings and\nactions and stuff like that so that's\nwhat makes uh\ntrauma so devastating towards kids is\nbecause if i don't think anyone else\nexists\nand something bad happens to me\nwho's responsible\nthe child feels absolutely\nand that's evolutionary because if i'm\nlearning how to walk and i stumble and\nfall\nlike i need to be responsible for that\nright so a lot of things like basic\nearly on i can't be blaming my parents\nfor like not learning how to walk at the\nage of nine months otherwise i'll never\nlearn how to walk\n12 months really is when we learn how to\nwalk\nso there's this kind of impaired theory\nof mind which which sort of makes trauma\ntowards children so devastating because\nin their mind\nthey're the only ones that really kind\nof exist so they accept more and more\nresponsibility\nso we sort of\nhere here i am i have a sense of\nidentity trauma happens shakes that\nsense of identity and then if i am able\nto develop a good narrative around that\nif i'm able to find meaning in my\ntraumatic experience then i will grow\nfrom it and i will be less likely to be\nlike have ptsd or some kind of\npsychiatric diagnosis and this this\nresearch comes out of like you know\nconditions where like genocide or stuff\nlike that where you have massive groups\nof people who have a shared traumatic\nexperience and so you've got refugee\ncamps where not everyone develops ptsd\nand then researchers will go in and\nthey'll try to figure out like why\ndoesn't one person have ptsd why does\nanother person have it so this is why\nit's really important to find meaning\nthere's also evidence from psychotherapy\nthat if you want to help people\nyou need some kind of explanatory system\nso this is where some people may be\nasking is there some meaning to life and\nthe short answer is scientifically it\ndoesn't matter it doesn't matter that\nyour\nmeaning is correct what matters is that\nit's internally consistent and\nrelatively comprehensive so you have to\nderive some sense of meaning that can\nexplain the range of things\nand that you can continuously apply does\nthat make sense\nso for example if i'm a psychoanalyst\nand i love sigmund freud and i'm all\ninto sigmund freud's various theories\nabout edible complexes and anal phase\nand phallic phase and oral phase and all\nthat kind of stuff that's actually\ntotally fine it's not whether it's like\nscientifically correct or not as long as\nmy system is consistent\nand can apply to things and people can\nkind of buy into it it'll actually be\ntherapeutic this is why we have so many\ndifferent perspectives on psychotherapy\nand they all basically work the same\neven though the core belief structures\nare quite different\nso when it comes to finding meaning\nwhat we need to do is figure out okay\nhow am i gonna formulate meaning so i\npersonally for example i put a lot of\nstock in the theory of karma\nwhen i work with patients i lean into\nthat sort of internally and then i'll\ntry to figure out whether they're open\nto that crap\nif they're open to that crap then i'll\ntalk about it if they're not open to\nthat crap that's actually totally fine i\ndon't have to impose my beliefs on them\nbut in terms of my mind the reason that\ni put stock in the theory of karma is\nit's kind of scientific for me it's that\nall causes have effects\nand all effects have causes\nright like that's like to me a\nscientific principle that gravity is\ncause and effect physics is cause and\neffect chemistry grows out of physics\nthat has cause and effect biochemistry\ngrows out of chemistry that has cause\nand effect biology grows out of\nbiochemistry uh cell biology grows out\nof biology cell biology becomes\nneurobiology neuro biology becomes\nneuroscience neuroscience becomes\npsychology psychology becomes human\nbehavior becomes economics becomes\nadvertising and we know that we can have\nscientific principles we can deduce\nequations of economics psychology\nadvertising behavior so cause and effect\nkind of happens and then the question is\ndoes it end at some point\nso to me scientifically this is a\nquestion that you all have to answer to\nme it doesn't make sense that there's an\narbitrary endpoint and in fact if you\nlook at the history of scientific\nprogression\nessentially like we've been able to\nbetter explain causes and effects and\nnow they're even sort of scientific\nequations for economics right so we can\nsort of try to deduce things\nmathematically to like interest rates\nand like raising interest rates and\nlowering interest rates and we have all\nthese kind of principles\nso the key thing for y'all is going to\nbe to think a little bit about\nyou know why does stuff happen to you\nand i encourage you all to think about\nthis because\nuntil you have an answer to that\nquestion it can feel like you're\nrudderless\nso this is the other sort of scientific\nfinding is it's not that a particular\ngod exists or that the theory of karma\nis correct or anything like that i mean\nthat may be true but that's like a point\nof religious debate we're not really\nconcerned with that what we do know is\nthat from a scientific sense if you're\ntrying to figure out what the hell is\ngoing on in your life\nyou need some kind of internally\nconsistent and comprehensive like\nmetaphysical system so for some people\nthat's a particular religion nice thing\nabout religion is they package it up for\nyou and it's kind of like a you know you\njust get the whole thing and it's all\nset\nthere are various downsides to religion\nsome people sort of espouse kind of a\nmore spiritual perspective or whatever i\nthink it's just important to think a\nlittle bit about why stuff happens to\nyou the really cool thing about once you\nstart to explore meaning in your life is\nthat like it helps you through stuff so\nremember we started talking about about\npost-traumatic growth and ptsd and the\nkey thing is as [ __ ] happens in your\nlife\nif you have some kind of internal system\nto make sense of it\nthen it'll be easy to make sense of it\nand as we start making sense of things\nwe can start like navigating life right\nso what is the source of suffering\nwell remember we talked about\nexpectation but what is it the root of\nit\nwhy do we emotionally why do we sort of\nvent our emotions what does that allow\nus to do\ny'all remember\nokay so i mean we we we we uh we talked\nabout i i could be wrong here we talked\nabout expectations like being the source\nof anxiety yeah so even deeper than that\navidya or ignorance is the source of\nsuffering and so remember that like when\ny'all didn't understand how crap worked\nlike generally speaking you get screwed\nright and once you start to understand\nthe mechanics of a video game for\nexample then you can start to perform\nbetter you start to understand it more\nyou know how to improve etc\nso and this is where like i know it\nsounds kind of weird but if ignorance is\nthe source of suffering and y'all don't\nhave to accept that it's just a\nhypothesis\nthen the question kind of becomes like\ndo you understand what's happening in\nyour life\nand as we start to like explore that\nlike why is this happening and i'm\ntalking on a global level and i\nrecognize that\ni've worked with a lot of people who you\nknow\ntheir upbringing has taught them that\nasking why is a useless question\ni don't care about the why all that\nmatters you need to get an a plus\nthe why is an irrelevant question\ni don't care why i don't care what you\nwant i don't care about meaning you need\nto play the violin you need to get an a\nplus you need to go to state\nchampionship you need to do this you\nneed to become doctor like it the whys\nare completely irrelevant\nlike you have to hit the like it's all\nabout the destination not the truth it's\nall about the metrics and the results\nand so this is the thing early on we\ntalked about getting away from results\nand tapping into our authentic self\nthe problem is that if we've been\nconditioned to focus on results we need\nsome kind of compass\nwe can't just ignore all the results and\nthen like magically [ __ ] starts\nhappening\nright that's why it's so hard to get\naway from results because you need some\nother kind of compass\nand what is that compass it's the\nmeaning\nand i recognize that for some of you\nthis is going to be really foreign\nbut i don't know how else to say this\nlike\nso ash shared with us that she\napparently if i heard correctly you know\nshe like found her grandmother who had\npassed away and so sometimes when\nsomething bad happens to us we have this\nquestion why me why did i have to be the\nperson\nand then this is where like i don't know\nhow to say this but people say like oh\nthere's no answer there's no real answer\nbut that's so damn unsatisfying\nthen she has to walk around with the\nquestion\nimagine for a moment\nthat you actually had an answer someone\nwas like hey this is why it happened\nthis is why it had to be you this is\nwhat it's done to you this is what it's\ngoing to turn you into\nand for zell like\nsure he was a chad\n7th grader\ndoing like 15 things\nbut like\nlook at the legacy\nthat it's left him\nand like metric here is tossing out his\nabusive father\nwhich is the climax of a tv show that is\na feel-good moment for everyone who's\nwatching when it's fictionalized and\nromanticized\nbut it's done a number on him\nright and kathy here\nis beating herself up\nbecause she didn't get her [ __ ] together\nand she has so many opportunities and\nshe can't take advantage of them\nand so this is where like we're kind of\nmoving into\nhow do you think about yourself\nbut this i don't know how else to say\nthis but if you wanna\nif you need like what we need what y'all\nneed what we all need is a compass\nlike what am i doing with content\ncreation kathy's like i've only streamed\ntwo or three days like\nare you upset about that is that okay\nand i'm sort of getting from kathy that\nshe doesn't know should she be doing\nmore should she be doing less is it okay\nis it not okay how the hell do you\nanswer that\nand so in the vacuum of this\ninternal compass\nwe fill it up with metrics\nview counts\nwe fill it up with all the analytics\nthat the world gives us we fill it up\nwith how much money we earn\nwe fill it up with the degree that's on\nour wall we fill it up with trophies and\nall this other crap\nright because like if i have nothing to\nnavigate i might as well go for an a\nplus because that's where things get\nmeasured\nbut if we want to get away from that we\nhave to think about\nour own internal compass\nso what i would want is for kathy to be\nable to answer for herself and be\ncontent with is it okay to stream only\ntwo or three days kathy is it okay to\nstream only two or three days\nyes\ndo you really believe that\nyes okay great done\nyeah right\nso so and this is where like we gotta we\ngotta figure out you know like\nhow are we gonna make decisions\nespecially for people like zell here is\nthinking about getting a full-time job\nkathy has a full-time job we can talk\nabout those kinds of things but as we\nhave all of these discussions\nwhere ash is trying to figure out how to\nspend her time metrics trying to figure\nout what he should stream all you all\nare trying to figure out do i expand do\ni grow do i lean into my authenticity or\ndo i play by the metrics like how do we\nincorporate certain analytics versus\nbeing true to ourselves we need an\ninternal compass\nand once you find that internal compass\nit makes all of your decision making\neasier\nand if you look at like in the past when\npeople were religious we kind of\noutsourced that stuff to god we're like\ngod says do this we're gonna follow that\nthat's what i'm gonna make my decisions\nbased on and what we sort of know is\npeople who can do that kind of mentally\nas we've looked at the science of that\nkind of thinking we found that basically\nlike it doesn't matter which god you\nchoose or whatever right so i'm sure\nthat people who are religious will have\nissues with that i'm kind of talking\nabout science here\nis that you just need some kind of\nsystem\nquestions\ndoes that answer y'all's question i know\nwe're going to talk more about this but\ndoes that at least answer your question\nwhen ash was saying like let's talk\nabout meaning and why like what\ndirection we're going to go in\nthat that clears a lot of things up i\nthink okay in terms of\nthe meaning of\nmeaning yeah but i'm\nyeah i mean i think that makes sense and\nlike i was just kind of thinking again\njust like trying to answer that question\nfor myself but like\nfinding that internal compass\nfeels really vague and existential and\nmy like when i'm trying to reason myself\nwith like why things happen\nlike my brain keeps just like hitting a\nbrick wall with like yeah\nyeah because because and this is this is\ni mean\nnot trying to generalize here but you\nknow we've got\nkathy you're korean\nyes got two koreans who have a shared\nexperience around this thing i'm sure\nthat other people it's not exclusive to\nkorean people but like\nsome cultures just don't care about why\nwhy is like not an important thing and\nso it feels like vague what i'm saying\nis that from a scientific perspective\ngetting a clear sense of why is like\nvery very like healthy\nin terms of giving us so now the\nquestion is how the hell do we do that\nanswer is i don't really know but we're\ngoing to try to figure out because like\ni said this was not part of the original\ncurriculum so i'm going to do my best\nbut\nso we'll we'll figure something out so\ndamn it you're supposed to fix\neverything well i'm not going to fix it\ny'all will figure it out you guys are\nlike kathy's already fixed it right\nshe's she's solid\nso here's\nhere's what i would start with so i want\nyou all for homework i want y'all to\nwrite one page and better if you really\ndo write it out bonus points if you\nhandwrite it out and i'll explain why\nwrite one page about how you feel about\nyourself\nso when you do this exercise you can do\na separate exercise actually yeah so\nwe're gonna make it complicated you can\nsort of ignore this part but as so i\nwant you to take two pieces of paper and\non one page i want you to write how you\nthink about yourself\nthen what i want you to do is as you're\ndoing exercise number one you're going\nto have thoughts\nabout things that you don't want to put\non page number one\nso you're gonna get some kind of\nreflexive answer like oh like\ni'm kinda sus\nbut you're like i don't want to write\nthat\nand i want you to put that on on page\nnumber two\nokay if that doesn't work for you that's\nokay you can just write one page about\nhow you think about yourself you don't\nhave to do the second part but i just\nwhat i'm trying to clue you all in on is\nthat as you do this exercise\nyou're going to notice and hopefully you\nall are trained in this at this point\nthat you're going to have reflexive\nreactions\nmetrics like am i bringing down the mood\nmagic no\ntalking about being physically violent\nand throwing your dad out on the street\nno man that's totally fine\nright like that's\nyou know you're gonna have these\nreactions\nand you're gonna have politeness with\nyourself ash is going to be like oh no i\ndon't want to\nlet myself wallow in the negativity\nwhich is totally fine ash we don't want\nyou to wallow in the negativity which we\nwant you to bring it here let that [ __ ]\nout\nyou don't have to hand you don't have to\ncarry it by yourself\ni think that's what i struggle with yeah\nright so it's gonna be absolutely our\nresponsibility to bring it out of you\nokay so you're gonna keep apologizing\nand then\nright now people are telling you don't\nbe sorry everyone's doing a good job of\nsaying how much they appreciate it and\nthen at some point they're gonna say\nyou know what i did want to actually\nshare something\nyou took my spotlight and\nthat's perfectly okay\none day maybe we'll get there i don't\nknow if this group will ever get there\nit's okay we don't have to no\nexpectations not i was gonna say not\njust that challenge\nlike\nyeah when you explained the homework i\nwas laughing to myself because i've just\nbeen internally doing that this whole\nsession\nthere's almost like a\num\na separate like there's things i really\nwant to say and i know with my adhd\nthey're like they're there and then\nthey're gone\nand then\nthere's like these separate like bubbles\nof thoughts that i'm like can't say that\ncan't say that\ncan't say that out loud either like i've\nliterally\nthe homework is like my constant\nthought process\nyeah so\nmaybe it'll be easy for you then\nwe'll see i'll forget by then it's okay\nso so whatever and i i think once again\nthe homework isn't about you know\ncomplete it's not about a grade it's to\nreally get you all to start thinking\nabout this\nand i think what we really need to dig\ninto before we get to meaning is we have\nto understand like who are you\nhow do you feel about yourself\nright and and that kind of vague stuff\nand so here are the reasons to write it\nso when i ask that question\nbased on our conditioning\nyour mind will produce a reflexive\nresponse\nokay so if i ask ash\nash how do you feel about yourself ash\nis going to be like i love myself a lot\nwhich is true and incomplete\nso the reason that we write one page is\nthe first half is gonna be what you\nreflexively believe and that's totally\nfine it's all good it's good that you\nlove yourself\nand\ni'm kinda sus\nright and by the time you get to the end\nof the bottom of the first page there's\ngoing to be stuff there that you'll have\nuncovered\nokay the other reason to write as\nopposed to type is generally speaking if\nyou write it'll be slower than typing\nand that that way your mind will be\nworking on it for a longer period of\ntime and you will uncover more stuff\nand so next week what i'm gonna try to\ndo i don't know i'm gonna have to think\nabout the existential stuff because i\ndon't know like i can't i mean i can\nteach you all you know a method that\nworks for me but i think we have to\nlearn a little bit more about who we are\nbefore we develop an internal compass\nbecause i think we've already learned\nthat so far so here's what i think we've\ntaken away so far\nis that y'all are operating based on a\ncompass for sure\nbut it's not necessarily a compass that\nyou picked\nit was the compass that was given to you\nand in order to find our own compass\nwe've got to figure out who we are\nand point of clarity does it have to be\nexclusive to the who we are as a content\ncreator or can it be\njust general yeah so here's and here no\ni can i should absolutely be be general\nor i mean you can talk about\ncontemplation but here's the here's the\nhypothesis here and this is something\nthat is less scientifically valid but i\nfeel you know you just haven't done a\nton of research on it that when you\nalign who who you are with content\ncreation that's when you become the best\ncontent creator\nthat's a hypothesis we have i don't know\nthat that's factually correct\nsounds pretty authentic\nright so that's where we don't want to\nthink about ourselves as content\ncreators first we want to think about\nourselves as human beings and then we'll\ntranslate that\nonce we take that authenticity and then\nwe apply analytics to it then we start\nplaying the game of content creation\nthat's when we actually succeed we don't\nwant to ignore the analytics but we\ndon't want the analytics to be our\ncompass\ndoes that make sense we want analytics\nto\nlike if i've got five natural impulses\ni'm gonna let the analytics let me be\ncalculating on which one of those to\ninvest in if that sort of makes sense so\nwe still want to use the analytics and\nthere's overwhelming evidence that\ncontent creators who pay attention to\nanalytics outperform those who don't\nbut we don't want them to substitute for\nan internal compass\nokay\nbecause the internal compass is\nessentially a substitute for the compass\nthat we already have which\ncenters around\nthings like analytics and metrics\npotentially so here's what can happen\nthe first is that our internal our our\ncompass can be conditionally given to us\nby our parents right so like metric for\nexample\nis waiting for people to crap on him\nwhy\nit's because\ni mean we don't know this for sure but\nyou know i'm sure it has i would be very\nsurprised if it had nothing to do with\nthe fact that his dad was violent when\nhe was growing up and stuff like that\nright it's because metric grew up in a\nsituation where he learned\nthat no matter what i do\nsomeone is there to\ncrap on me\nokay so maybe that's not the case we\ndon't really know we haven't really dug\ninto it yet but so sometimes our\nconditioning gives us a sense of like\na compass of what we should or shouldn't\ndo does that make sense\nsecond thing is that when we don't have\nwhen we're not centered within ourselves\nwe become more responsive to signals\nfrom the external world\ndoes that make sense\nso when i don't know who i am as a\ncontent creator and i'm looking for a\ndirection\ni have things like view counts and sub\ncounts and this person blew up here and\nthis is on lsf and this is going on and\neveryone's playing this game and i'm\ngoing to use that as a substitute for an\ninternal compass\nwe even see this in cases of personality\ndisorders\nwhere when when there are certain\npersonality disorders where i don't have\na good sense of who i am\nso who i am is determined by how other\npeople treat me\nso if i'm treated well i'm a good person\nif i'm treated well i'm a bad person and\nthere's no sense of independent identity\nthis actually happens to content\ncreators because we get so much\nanalytical feedback\nthat we start to\nvalue ourselves\nbased on analytics\nso who i am and my value as a human\nbeing starts to correlate more tightly\nwith my value the value of the content\nthat i create does that make sense those\nget those two things get tangled up\nso what we if you want to be a healthy\nand arguably somewhat successful content\ncreator because there may be some\nevidence that the most successful\ncontent creators\nare completely into the analytic side\nbut they suffer immensely i don't think\nthat's the case but we don't really have\na good sample size when you're talking\nabout very very successful content\ncreators\ndoes that make sense\nso we can use external data as a\nsubstitute when we don't know who we are\nwe oftentimes will make decisions based\non how we would condition to make\ndecisions\nsummary points one and two\nin order to find peace and direction in\nlife we need some kind of existential\napproach that is both comprehensive and\nconsistent\nwhen we apply that approach to our lives\nwe will be able to find a sense of\ndirection and purpose as we find a sense\nof direction and purpose we feel better\nabout ourselves as we feel better about\nourselves we become more resilient\nto external data\nand aren't influenced by it\nand hopefully then we can incorporate it\nin a healthy way and create the best\ncontent\nquestions\nokay\ni have a question but it's\nsemi-unrelated it's more about just like\ndiscussion format just because you kind\nof touched on this earlier but like when\npeople say stuff and you have like\nyou know those thought bubbles that are\nlike kind of like what ruby mentioned\nwhere like i shouldn't say this like i\nmean\nit sounded like we should say these\nthings as like a part of our authentic\nself but like also from a respectful\nslash polite point of view i'm kind of\nlike i don't want to say the wrong thing\nespecially when people are being\nemotionally vulnerable and so for me\nlike i i'm just kind of curious like you\nknow how we handle that great question\num so two things one is we're just gonna\nhave to find what feels right for the\ngroup\nokay so i encourage you all to say\nsomething and then we're going to check\nin with the group one thing i feel\npretty good about is i'm pretty sure\nthat people here\nunderstand that the intentions of\neveryone else is positive\nso until y'all start taking risks i'm\ngonna have to keep taking risks\nright so like\nyeah and then if i do that too much\ny'all are gonna start to dislike me\nso that's something\nso you all need to start taking i mean\nstop\nokay\nso\nand the second thing is i i remind y'all\nto remember what our three values are\ncompassion authenticity and presence\nso we always want compassion to come\nfirst\nso if you're gonna say something\nit's i think it's okay to challenge\nsomeone else\nit's not okay\nto\nintentionally hurt someone else\nif i authentically believe that you are\na terrible human being i don't want to\nsay that because\ncompassion trumps authenticity\nat the same time i think that y'all do a\ngood job of like\nengaging with each other and i i don't\nknow like\nholding hands and singing kumbaya i do\nnot think is going to help you all that\nmuch\nwhat's going on i mean we can do it\nanyway but uh i'm not saying it's\nso that has but but what i want y'all to\nbe able to do is to like\nget into the negative\nand then acknowledge that it's okay\nright like\nso you're not perfect\ni don't i don't want you all to strive\nto help each other to meet perfection i\nwant you all\nmy goal is to help you all be okay not\nbeing perfect\nand then to still move forward we're not\nsaying because that sometimes people\nthink that means apathy\nwe want you to move towards your goals\nbut move towards your goals not to\nattain perfection but because you want\nto do this you want to make the world a\nbetter place\nyou want to create content that you\nshare with people so that should be the\ngoal and that's once again a bias that i\nhave\ndoes that answer your question zl\nyeah okay\nall righty\nthank you very much anyone streaming\nuh i am okay um\nokay so we'll we'll toss your right\nmetric\nokay thank you all right\ntake care everyone\nthank you for coming thank you thanks dr\nk thank you everyone\nbye bye\nokay\nall right\nmake sense\nwe're streaming tomorrow chat\num\nquestions before we\nraid metric\npeople understand what we're kind of\nsaying here\nyou know so i think this is like\nimportant to understand that\nso we could do like a lecture about some\nof these concepts but the key thing\nabout\ngroup work is that it gives us a\nopportunity to apply stuff\ndoes that make sense\nlike it's not enough to say like i can\nshare that scientific stuff but like now\nthe real work happens\nand you can take a concept like you can\nread 300 pages about finding meaning in\nyour life\nbut we sort of know\ni mean there isn't great research on\nthis but there's like a fair amount of\nresearch that\njust reading books or information does\nnot lead to behavioral change\nbehavioral change comes from the\napplication of information or the\ndevelopment of understanding\nand so\nif you really want to make a change in\nyour life you have to do internal\nexploration\nand hopefully some kind of facilitation\nso like a lot of people will do the\ninternal exploration and they'll get\nthere\neventually\nbut this is the key thing we also know\nthat if you have some kind of\nfacilitator support or expert\nthey can\nincrease the speed at which you make\nprogress\ndoes that make sense\nso it's like you have to do internal\nwork but like\nwith a guide of some kind\nand the guide isn't going to have the\nanswer for you right so i can't show up\nat group and say okay this is what you\nneed this is what you need this is what\nyou need this is what you need and this\nis the problem with like generally\nspeaking things like self-help videos or\nadvice or whatever is that it's not\npersonalized so like today we learned\nall kinds of stuff that we had no idea\nabout\nright so like when metric beats himself\nup like where does that come from\nwell like we learned some interesting\ninformation\nwhen\nkathy is feeling tired all the time like\nwhere does that come from well we unders\nwe learned some interesting information\nand it's the lack of personal\napplication that gets to just dot dot\ndot\nif that makes sense\nright just get out more\njust go to the gym\njust to grieve and move on\nwell why why is it hard to do those\nthings because there's a personal\ncomponent\nso you can you can understand grief but\nin order to apply it to your individual\nlevel there needs to be a translation\nyou"
