    "transcript": "so it doesn't matter whether money is\nreal or not like the act of gambling and\nthe random reinforcement schedule and\ngetting some kind of victory is\nsufficient in suppressing the limbic\nsystem i need everything to feel\nworthwhile whenever i'm doing well\nanything really healthy or unhealthy i\nhave this issue where i need everything\nto feel completely and totally\nworthwhile as of late i felt it becoming\nincreasingly problematic for b for being\nboth productive and healthy essentially\ni set out with a goal of some kind and\nif i don't complete them i either waste\nabsurd amounts of time trying to\ncomplete those goals\nor have a heavy damper on my mood for\nthe rest of the day which stops me from\ngetting anything done there are some\nsituations that i think are worse than\nothers trying to meet people for example\nhas been coming up a lot since i'm just\nstarting college on days where i haven't\nmet as many people as i liked or had a\ngood conversation with anyone i end up\nin a very drained state where i could\ncan't get a lot of schoolwork done i\nfeel like i just want to go home and sit\naround for a day\nplaying video games or doing something\ngenerally easy usually by the next day i\nfeel fresher however there are times\nwhere i feel like this need for things\nto be worthwhile has been borderline\naddictive most recently i've been\nspending hours staying up playing this\ngambling\nthis gambling on a game i play to earn\ncredits it's not real money and there's\nzero benefit to having the currency\naside from saying that you have a lot\nstill i keep playing when i lose a bit i\nfeel a need to earn my way back up and\nend up driving myself further into holes\ni get that gambling can be like that but\ni find it odd that i'm so hooked even\nthough the money has zero value i've\nalso recognized as a problem with porn\nusage which is a problem i've been\nactively trying to deal with whenever i\nrelapse though i get into this mindset\nof i won't be doing this for a while\nagain and binge really hard until i feel\nsatisfied i was wondering does anyone\nelse feel this way how do i have this\nneed for productivity affect me less\nharmfully is this a health healthy\nmindset in any capacity so let's kind of\ntake a quick look at this so this is a\nsituation where someone needs to feel\nlike everything they do is worthwhile so\noftentimes you've got a particular thing\nthat you want to accomplish and you want\nto you know you want to use your time\nproductively so we want to use our time\nproductively because then we're like\ngood people we're healthy people we're\nsuccessful people if we use our time\nproductively so let's be productive\neverything's got to be i can't waste any\ntime and then what happens is if\neverything we have to do needs to be\nproductive and we can't waste time\nsomething weird starts to happen if we\ndon't live up to some of our\nexpectations we'll either waste a lot of\ntime trying to accomplish these goals\nbecause we gotta do it right or we'll\nhave a heavy damper on my mood for the\nrest of the day and then what happens is\nwe'll oftentimes get into these\nsituations where we're not quite sure\nwhat's going on and then we fall into\nall these other kinds of behaviors like\nplaying video games doing gambling stuff\npornography so let's try to understand\nwhat's going on here okay\nlet's try to break down first of all\nwhere does the feeling that you need to\ndo everything worthwhile come from\nsecondly how do we sort of manage that\nfeeling how do we deal with it thirdly\nwhat are the consequences of this whole\ncycle both psychologically\nneurologically reinforcement wise and\nlastly like what do we do about it okay\nso let's take a look so generally speak\nspeaking i exist and then what happens\nis when i go about living my life i will\ncreate an expectation so this person for\nexample will talk about let's say you\nknow i'm in college and so\non days where i haven't met as many\npeople as i liked or had a good\nconversation with someone i end up in a\ndrained state so let's try to understand\nwhat that means so we create an\nexpectation for ourselves and then let's\nsay we start here and we try to live up\nto that expectation if we live up to\nthat expectation fantastic but if we\nfall short of the expectation this\nwindow leads to disappointment now once\nwe have this emotional disappointment\nwhat you remember is a feeling our brain\noh make myself disappear for a second\nonce we have this emotional\ndisappointment what we're gonna do is\ncope with it okay so this is how the\nbrain sort of deals with emotions we\nhave to do coping bring myself back so\nlet's take a look at that so once i feel\nemotional disappointment let's say this\nis shame right so like feeling like i've\nfallen behind look at all those other\npeople i start making comparisons all\nthose other people are making friends\nand i'm not making friends and then once\ni start to do that this i have to deal\nwith these emotions with like some kind\nof emotional um let's make sure okay\nokay so i have to deal with all these\nnegative emotions with things like video\ngames gambling the unholy trifecta and\nthis person even points out that even\nwhen i'm gambling there's no real money\ninvolved so why do i keep doing it i'm\nnot really gaining anything and that's\nbecause that makes sense actually\ninteresting because when it comes to\ngambling for example our brain has\ncertain like circuits that get activated\nwhen we gamble\nwhen we activate these circuits when we\ngamble they actually suppress our limbic\nsystem so it doesn't matter whether the\nmoney is real or not like the act of\ngambling and the random reinforcement\nschedule and getting some kind of\nvictory is sufficient in suppressing the\nlimbic system so this explains why even\nif you're not getting any money you're\nstill going to be gambling because it's\ndoing the the gambling is doing the job\nthat it is is set out to do which is to\ndeal with all this emotional\ndisappointment and so what i would\nimagine we'd see in this person is that\nthe more they fall short of their\nexpectations the more they engage in\nthis sort of gambling behavior and\nfalling behind and all this kind of\nstuff pornography video games etc so now\nwe've got another issue which is that\nonce i've fallen short this translates\ninto the future so if i've fallen short\nby this\nthis amount let's say what that means is\nthat going forward i start at a deficit\nso now when tomorrow rolls around let's\nsay here's the baseline here's what i\nwant to accomplish\nhere's the expectation but i'm actually\nstarting over here so since i only made\none friend yesterday i actually have to\ncover this whole distance so even if i\nmove from here to here let's say i do\nthis much how does it feel how much have\ni fallen short now i've fallen short by\nthis amount right so even though i made\nprogress it feels like i fall short and\nthen this carries over to next time now\nthis is below the baseline now today i\nhave to do this and now let's say that i\nwork extra hard right so yesterday i did\nthis much today i'm gonna do this much\nsocializing that's a lot more where am i\nnow the gap is this much and so\nsomething very bizarre starts to happen\nif you really look at this this is\nprogress this is progress this is\nprogress this is progress all of these\nare progress so now we're in trouble\nbecause despite progress we feel like\nwe're failing now once we feel like\nwe're failing enter the pornography and\ngambling and video games now we're in a\nlot of trouble because when\nprogress does not positively reinforce\nbehavior where does that leave us that's\na huge issue because even though i'm\ndoing all the right stuff i don't feel\nany sense of accomplishment which in\nturn means that i'm not going to be\nreinforcing the actual behavior that's\nimproving my life and this is how you\nget stuck in this trap and the bigger\nthis grows this gets so big that\neventually everything you do has to feel\nworthwhile i cannot waste one second of\na single day because i've dug myself\ninto such a pit that i need to be extra\nextra productive every moment of every\nday every time i go out i need to make\n10 friends every time i go out i need to\nmake 15 friends every time i study i\nneed to get an a plus it all needs to be\ni've wasted so much time this gap is so\nbig oh my god how do you make up for\nthis gap\neverything has to be worthwhile because\nif i'm so far behind i can't afford to\nwaste any time so this is something\nthat's kind of interesting people who\nare successful can afford to waste time\npeople who are behind cannot afford to\nwaste time the more in the hole you are\nthe less your time is worth the more\nmiserly you are about it it's huge irony\nright so if i'm behind if i'm 28 years\nold and i haven't graduated from college\nand i don't have a job how much is my\ntime actually worth not very much if i'm\n28 years old and i'm\nin surgical residency how much is time\nmy time worth it's worth objectively\nmore who feels guiltier taking vacation\nthe 28 year old who doesn't have a job\nwhose time is worth objectively less\nthan the surgeons or the surgeon who's\n28 and like can't wait for a vacation\nand so now we get into a lot of very\ninteresting problems the first problem\nthat we've already talked about is that\ndespite progress we feel like we're\nfailing the second problem is that we\nbecome miserly with our time and as we\nbecome miserly with our time we can't\ntake chances if we can't take chances we\nbecome paralyzed in terms of options i\ncan't even apply to college because i\nneed to get in so the application has to\nbe perfect\nif the application has to be perfect i\nhave to spend so much longer on it i\ncan't afford to do good enough this\nleads to paralysis the more we get\nparalyzed the more further behind we\nfall and the more we end up being\nmiserly with our time and if you can't\nexperiment you can't take chances it's\nreally hard to dig yourself out of the\nhole the last thing which we've also\nkind of talked about is that the fur the\nmore that one and two pile up the more\nwe end up with emotional coping\nmechanisms so we've covered this kind of\ngambling gaming etc and the problem is\nthat these in turn like make it harder\nto actually make progress right so these\nthen sabotage us so what do you do about\nthis abandon expectations so this whole\nthing starts with this idea right here\nhere's my starting point here's my\nexpectation if i move this amount this\nis falling short if i have no\nexpectation this is all a win we started\ntoday here we ended today here this is a\nwin if i have an expectation this is a\nloss do you all get that like this is\nmind-blowing once you really get it that\nthe same amount of effort or progress\ncan lead to positive reinforcement or\nnegative reinforcement all based on the\nexpectations there's kind of a core\nto abandoning expectations you can't fix\ntomorrow oh sorry you can't fix\nyesterday's problems so let me put it to\nyou this way if i'm 28 years old and i'm\napplying to college i'm thinking about\napplying to college and then i think to\nmyself oh my god i don't know if i\nshould apply to college because i don't\nknow what to major in what if i major in\nthe wrong thing and then i spend four\nyears in college and then i'm 32 and i\nhave the wrong major then i'll have\nwasted 14 years of my life so i can't\nafford to get into the wrong major i\nhave to figure out what's the right\nmajor so then i end up doing research i\nnever apply i'm trying to figure out\nokay what's the career how do i what do\ni do with my life i'm stuck but the key\nthing is that like you're 28 you've\nalready wasted 10 years call that l like\nyou gotta eat the l there's nothing you\ncan do today that will make up for the\ntime that's already passed and it's our\nattempt to make up for the time that's\nalready passed that really creates the\nproblem that's what actually paralyzes\nbecause how can i afford to lose 14\nyears when i've al if i if i've lost 10\nbut we don't think about it as losing 10\nwe think about it as okay if i make it\nworthwhile then those 10 years may not\nhave been a waste we try to get those\nyears back and that burden becomes so\nimpossible because how do you make a\ndecision for a major that makes up for\n14 years of spent time impossible you\nset yourself up for failure so whatever\nyou've screwed up in the past you've\nscrewed it up it's over let it go can't\nfix it that hurts though oh my god like\nyou're telling me it was a waste like\ni'm not telling you it's a waste you're\nthe one who's telling me it's a waste\nall kinds of benefits but you refuse to\nsee them because you're trying to make\nup for it so you can't solve today's the\nproblems of yesterday today this is kind\nof general be careful operating from a\nfeeling so we've got to be super careful\nabout letting our feelings dictate our\nactions so i'm going to let's take a\nquick look at this post and understand i\nend up in a very drained state where i\ncan't get a lot i feel like i just want\nto go home and sit around for a day\nplaying video games next day i feel\nfresher right i have this issue where i\nneed everything to feel completely and\ntotally worthwhile how does gambling\nmake them feel so even this i get into\nthis mindset i won't be doing this for a\nwhile and binge really hard until i feel\nsatisfied so what is dictating all of\nthis person's actions when do they stop\nwhen they feel satisfied they need to\nfeel worthwhile so i want you all to\njust imagine for a moment what this\nperson's life would be like what your\nlife would be like if feelings did not\ndictate your actions it's fine that you\nfeel a particular way we're not saying\nthat you shouldn't feel that way does\nthe feeling need to dictate the action\ni need everything to feel worthwhile\ncan you do it anyway can you even do it\nif it doesn't feel worthwhile what would\nstart to happen in your life if you\nstopped using pornography until you felt\nsatisfied what would happen in your life\nif you didn't need to feel have things\nfeel worthwhile in order to do them i\nfeel like i didn't make enough friends\ntoday i feel like i need to make a ton\nof friends at this party because i need\nto make up for being a shut-in for the\nlast week what happened if what would\nhappen if that feeling no longer\ncontrols you so you have to acknowledge\nthat it's just a feeling we're not\nsaying it's false but all it is is a\nfeeling it's not a law of nature it's\njust how you feel in that moment and you\nmay say okay like but dr k that's hard\nyou're correct it is hard yogis in\nancient india spent years if not decades\nmastering their feelings so what chance\ndo you have pretty good one because\nyou're basically equipped with the same\nstuff they are you're a human it's a\nvery simple thing you can do if you want\nto know okay how do i\nnot let my feelings engage with actions\nhow do i not be controlled by by my\nfeelings one very simple meditative\nexercise that you can do there are\nvarious versions of this so i'm going to\nshare with you all a couple the first is\nthat the next time when you start\nordering food order it to not be perfect\nso let's say that i want to eat a bacon\ncheeseburger i'm going to order a bacon\ncheeseburger for lunch so instead of\ngetting a bacon cheeseburger get either\na bacon burger or a cheeseburger cut out\none thing like if you if you want to get\nice cream with sprinkles cut out the\nsprinkles in more extreme versions if\nyou like your burgers without tomato get\nit with tomato either add something that\nyou don't like or remove something that\nyou do like from the equation and then\nyou will say oh my god this is insane\nare you telling me not to eat my\nfavorite food and you can still eat the\nfood we're not saying deprive yourself\nentirely we're just saying instead of\nshooting for perfect satisfaction shoot\nfor less than perfect satisfaction so\nwhat you want to start doing is allow\nyourself to do things that you don't\nfeel like doing now in more extreme\nversions you can also do things like you\nknow adopt more specific diets and\nthings like that just start by not\ngiving in to your feelings in some small\nway and we're not saying make it drastic\nright don't order your least favorite\nthing on the menu you like you can still\norder things that you like just try to\nmake it less than perfect and as you do\nthat what you'll start to learn is that\nyou're gonna feel like you want that\nbacon i don't want tomato on the\nsandwich i don't want it okay well so\nwhat you can still eat it it's kind of\nbizarre so if you're stuck in this cycle\nof everything has to be worthwhile first\nof all understand where it comes from\nthat it's born from expectation it's\nborn from the things that we carry over\nfrom yesterday and put on today and\nfundamentally it's born from our\ninability to\nseparate actions from feelings and if\nyou can do those three things then you\nwill be able to do things that are not\nworthwhile and it'll be like freeing\nit's like liberating to be able to do\ndo this because right now we're so\ncontrolled by our feelings right i'm\ntriggered or upset by people using a\nparticular phrase so i'm i need everyone\nelse to stop talking i'm not saying that\nhate speech is good or anything like\nthat please do not interpret it that way\nyou know there's still bad things and\nyou know you shouldn't say things that\nhurt other people but at the same time\nlike just think a little bit about right\nnow what's happening in the world is\nthat we're\nsurrendering our happiness and peace of\nmind to the actions of others instead of\ntraining ourselves to be able to\ntolerate be undisturbed by someone\nelse's venom we're actually starting to\nlike open up and like let them affect us\nwe're surrendering control of our own\nhappiness to the words of other people\nnow this is an important caveat i'm not\nsaying it's okay to say hurtful things\nso we should still hold people who\nengage in hate speech and things like\nthat accountable for saying harmful\nthings but what i'm saying is that\nthere's a there's a side to this story\nthat we haven't engaged in which is\npersonally being able to withstand\ntoxicity recognizing that like this\nperson can use whatever words they want\nto but i'm not going to be happy or\nunhappy based on what this person says\nlike think about that for a second are\nwe surrendering control of our peace of\nmind to the words of another human being\ni'm not saying it makes it okay i'm not\nsaying that there shouldn't be\naccountability for actions that's\ncompletely different you can hold them\naccountable and still be internally\npeaceful so does that mean i don't care\nabout what they say not caring\nimplies\napathy i don't think that you should not\ncare about what they say i'll give you\nall an example so let's say someone says\nsomething hurtful to me now it can hurt\nto hear it right but then i've got a\ncouple of different options i can tell\nthem not to say this which may be\ncompletely reasonable so i'm not saying\ndon't do that but internally i've got a\ncouple of options too i can start to\nthink a little bit about okay is this\ntrue do i agree with this person where\nis this person coming from why are they\nsaying this is it possible they're\nsaying it just because they've had a bad\nday and so sometimes when people\ncriticize us like their criticism has a\nlot more to say about them than it does\nsay about me sometimes it says a lot\nabout me so that's where like we've got\nto be a little bit critical about the\nprocess but then we may sort of realize\nat the end of it that okay like this\nperson is you know so i've worked with\npeople who are addicted to substances\nthey have histories of addiction and\nthey'll be prescribed controlled\nsubstances so sometimes they'll be on\nlike opioid maintenance treatment like\nsuboxone and then they lose their\nsuboxone and they get very very angry at\nme because i won't prescribe it again\nbecause they lost it who knows do they\nlose it did they abuse it i don't know\nand so there's a protocol around what's\nappropriate for prescribing what isn't\nand then depending on how they feel\nabout it they can start getting really\nnasty and then i can decide how i deal\nwith their words so do i want to hold\nthem accountable if they say things that\nare disrespectful i'll tell them that\nthe way that you're talking to the staff\ntoday is not acceptable they're here to\nhelp you and i understand that you lost\nyour suboxone that's not their fault\nit's not okay to talk to people like\nthat and also i don't have to be mad\nabout it i don't have to be like oh my\ngod this person is such an all\naddicts are bad and like oh my god no\nit's like that person like they've got\nan addiction and it sucks because\nthey're now going to be going through\nwithdrawal i should be compassionate and\ni can still hold them accountable does\nthat make sense so it's about being like\ninternally okay with yourself when\nsomeone says something that's harmful\ndoesn't mean that we want to allow them\nto say things harmful that's like a\nsubtlety that i think is lost on the\ninternet that you can hold people\naccountable for actions while still\nbeing compassionate towards them and not\nletting them hurt you as best as you can\nand what started to happen is we've like\ncompletely forgotten that second bit\nright we're all about accountability and\ncanceling people and stuff like that\nwhich there may be good reasons for i'm\nnot saying that that there aren't good\nreasons to do that i'm just saying that\nthere's another piece to it it's an\nincomplete equation\nyou"
