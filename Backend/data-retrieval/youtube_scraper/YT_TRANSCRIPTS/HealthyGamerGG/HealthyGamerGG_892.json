    "transcript": "right you don't know am i doing enough\nor not so how do you know how do you\nanswer the question of am i doing enough\non social media\ni don't know you ask other people\nso that you understand what the average\nis\nhello\noh hey that scared me\noh sorry\nwhat do you go by friend\nuh sure\nokay\nand pierre what um\nuh i think our prompt today is where do\nyou want to go and what's getting in the\nway\nyep that's exactly that or sorry who do\nyou want to be but what keeps you from\ngetting there\nyep\nso tell me pierre\ncan you hear me or not yes i can hear\nyou\nokay cool um\ni got a disclaimer to do okay now just\nso so we're on the same on the same page\nmy english is not my first language so\ni'm gonna try my best okay awesome\nthank you there you go\num\nwhere do i start\num\ni think i'm just gonna read again what\ni've\nwrote on the scott chat okay\nso what i said is my whole life i wanted\nto be a comic artist\nwebbed an artist basically\ntelling my own stories to the whole\nworld\nbut now i'm currently working on my\ndream project and trying to make a\nliving out of it after dumping my\ngirlfriend sacrificing my social life\nworking all the damn time and cutting\nall income\ni kind of feel like i'm a prisoner of my\nown passion\ni don't know if i'm ready to sacrifice\nmy unhappiness in the name of my future\nself\nthe successful storyteller i have\nstriven to become or just let go in\norder to become someone else not bound\nto my work but free to live\npretty much it\nwow man that's deep\nokay\nso pierre you are a rarity my friend\noh\nhow is that why\nbecause most people dream of giving up\ntheir careers their lives they want to\ngive in to their passion\nright they want to sacrifice everything\nlike in the movies like i'm an artist\nand i'll sacrifice everything for the\nsake of my art\nthat's exactly that\nthat's what everyone wants to everyone's\ntoo afraid to do it\nyep\nand so tell me tell me about your\nsacrifices my friend\nhow'd you make them how how did you make\nthose decisions\ni think foreign yeah just\ni think the biggest sacrifice\ni went through\nwas\nespecially in my dating life\ni've been\nin a long streak since 2016. i've been\nthrough a lot of girlfriends\ngot a lot of\nrelationships\nand now it's just like a void and\nit's not\nit's not familiar\nit's kind of an expression of something\ndifferent\nand\nwhat are the words for that i have no\nclue that's why i'm here\nand the obvious sacrifices are\nlike i said is\ndating life\nfinancial that's the right word\nsocial life i don't see my friends that\noften\nthe only moment i can just interact with\nthem is\nwith a friend i would go to the gym with\nthem\nand because i force myself\nand force myself it's a pleasure to do\nit's like i like to do it but\nit's i force myself to\ngo outside and go to the gym just to you\nknow work on myself\na little bit\nand\nit's\nit kind of it's going to sound a bit\nfamiliar with your previous um\nprevious person your you were chatting\nwith\nis that there's a lot of\nnotion of feeling behind\nlike i'm surrounded by people that\namazing artists that\nare\nhaving their life together they've got\nmoney a lot of money\nand\nthey're just doing amazing things in\nhere in the industry concept artists\nillustrators and\nand i'm\n26 years old\nstill struggling on my thing\nit's taking a long time to do it\nand there is no certainty it's going to\nwork\nat all\nand it's scary\nit's so scary because if it fails it's\nlike i've\nit's like i've i've used all my cards\nbasically\nokay\nwhen you say you've you're surrounded by\npeople who are successful how are you\nsurrounded by them what's the nature of\nyour interaction\nsurrounded is\num i've i'm close to a few friends uh\nthey got back to back to my art school\nand\nthey've\nthrough circumstances i've met other\npeople\nthrough discord channel and\nthis discord channel is private by the\nway so and these people\ni finally met them\nin your person\nand these people are enjoyable amazing\nand\nto say they are friends it's a kind of a\nstretch but there's these are people\nlike i can share professionally but\nthat's pretty much it\nokay but the other friends i have with\nthe other friends i have are coming from\nthe\nmy art school and but what and when you\nsay these people are very successful\nlike how do you know like are they are\nthey making a living making art\noh yeah yeah sure yeah\nyeah\nto be fair like if i should compare to\nmost of freelance artists like they are\nmaking money\nlike\ni'm pretty sure that\nlike\nare they like\nmaking millions no no at all but very\nsuccessful and doing like\nkind of decent bucks in the industry\nthat's that's cool especially when\nyou're freelance and i think it's it\nstems from\nbasically the thing i'm comparing myself\na lot\ni got no money and no\nlike no salary or\nincome at the moment\nand so\nuh i'm not\nwhat do you do you think that\nif you keep at it you will\ni'm just not too familiar with your\nindustry so like what you know what are\nthe chances that you can sustain\nyourself financially\ni'm taking a direction that is very\ndifferent from them from a lot of people\ni know like\ni think it's gonna be easier for you to\nunderstand my struggle by just saying\nthat what i'm doing\nis\ni'm\nit's not bragging or anything but i know\nit's unique okay it's not it's like\neveryone is working for a client they're\ndoing influenced freelance jobs or they\nworking in a studio or\npeople are just working for\nyou know some some friends i have or in\nthe comic industry even traditional\ncomic industry which is like you print\ncomic books and you sell them worldwide\nand i'm trying to do webtoons and\nwebtoons are just basically comics on\nphone and you just scroll them and you\ngot a story\nand\ni\ni've been working on this idea of this\nproject i got in my mind and just whole\nthing of wing webtoons and i'm tr and i\nfeel like i've got something to bring\nbut i don't know if this thing i want to\nbring is going to\nto be accepted\nokay and how many hours a week do you\nspend on your project\nfrom monday to sunday\nand\nbasically eight to nine hours a day\nand\nuh so are you like like is there like a\ncompletion point or you're like\nuploading stuff regularly like what's\nwhat's what's\nwhat's getting in the way of success\nmy\ni'm sorry\nit's confusing um\n[Music]\nthe\nyou're explaining things very well it's\nthis is just my ignorance of your\nindustry\nokay fair enough um\ni think i'm gonna speak for myself what\ni'm doing at the moment and why i'm so\nscared it's basically at the moment um\ncomics takes\ncomic takes a long time to do like a\nvery long time and\ni'm trying to plan ahead like to give\nyou an example\ni'm trying to work on this thing\nand i'm trying to plan like\nin a year basically i know exactly how\nmany things i'm going to do how many\nchapters i'm going to do\nin like in the next next august 2023\nbasically\ni know\nhow many things i'm gonna do i know how\nmany things i'm gonna draw i know that\nall my weekends are gonna be like\nfull of work\ni know that\nthat day and that i'm going to rest\nokay so so\nuh i thanks for explaining that peter\ni'm still not i'm going to ask my\nquestion again sorry for interrupting\nyeah\nwhat is keeping you from being\nsuccessful is this the kind of thing\nwhere your comics aren't out yet or\nthey're out and you're they're not\ngetting better at the moment at the\nmoment it's it's not out and then when\nit's not out so um um there are a few\nthree chapters that i've done for a\ncontest for those who i'm webtoon there\nprobably know there's been this contest\ncalled call to action and i published my\nthree chapters there\nand\nyou can't publish uh on the thing like\nup until october so i'm i'm currently\nworking on the storyboard which is like\nkind of of a rough of a future chapters\nyou're going to do yep\nand\nand that will help me to work on them in\nthe future so now we're going to publish\nthem um\nlet me say that weekly\nso\npierre here's what i'm kind of trying to\nunderstand is like let's say you\ncontinued giving this your all and\nmaking sacrifices\ndo you have a sense of like when you\nwould\nat least have an initial\nlike product where you like where when's\nthe first opportunity for you to be\nquote unquote successful let's put it\nthat way\nuh to make a living out of it you know i\nknow but like when is that like so let's\nsay like i'm an author right yeah yeah\nand i can say okay i'm writing a book\nbut like the\nthe book yeah like when is the earliest\nopportunity that i could have to publish\nthat book for it to hit shelves for\npeople to start reading it i'm trying to\nunderstand like where you are\npractically like what are we talking\nabout here\nso at the moment\nto say it like\nall right\nin a funny way would be like\ni'm i'm a mono i'm a moment i'm nothing\ni'm no one at the moment i i get that\nyou're no one at the moment what i'm\nsaying is when is the first chance for\nyou to be a someone\nyeah so the thing is webtoon are\npublishers as well and what i'm striving\nfor\nis to\nyou know\nmake the\neditors on webtoon to notice me and get\na contract from them\nor being be successful enough and get\nviewed a novel platform\nto have\nenough patrons to have to sustain myself\nin the future okay so but basically yeah\nso like what is the timeline for\nlike so but can anyone support you on\npatreon or something right now you don't\nhave comics that are up right now right\nat the moment there are only three\nchapters i'm doing a psych project\nwhich is like a tiny thing i'm doing at\nthe moment\nand\nat the moment\nto be realistic at the moment i know\nthat it's going to take a lot of time\nit's going to take a long long time but\nhow long it's going to be because the\nthing is i've\ni've set up some kind of deadline\nuntil august 2023\nokay exactly\nso still better\nso here's here's can i offer some\nthoughts pierre\nyeah okay tell me so i've worked with a\nfair number of artists\ni've worked with artists who are both\nsuccessful and unsuccessful\nso here's what i've noticed\nso\nsometimes what holds an artist back\nis\nthe quality of their craft so for\nexample like if i'm an author like my\nbook just isn't good enough and so\nsometimes like what i need to invest in\nis is like becoming a better writer now\nthat's kind of like a long-term\ninvestment we don't really ever know if\ni'm gonna get there or not get there\nyeah other artists i've worked at\nthey much like yourself feel like\nthey've got a really good idea have\nsomething unique or willing to put in\nthe effort i'm gonna assume for a moment\nthat you have the skill to accomplish\nwhat you need to but what i often times\nfind is that a lot of artists are\nso\nfocused on the art that they sort of\ndon't think about\nthe practicalities or it's not they\ndon't think about it it's that they\ndon't devote\na lot of energy to exploring the\npracticalities\nso i can write a really good book but\nlike if i want to make it there's a\ndifference between writing a good book\nand being a successful author\nand it's in that gap that i think a lot\nof people fall short\nso i can't i have no idea how to judge\nwhether your art has merit or not merit\nor things like that let's assume for a\nmoment that\nif\ndisseminated properly your webtoons will\nbe successful\neven if your webtoons are good enough to\nbe successful there are a lot of steps\nhere which i'm not hearing a whole lot\nof clarity on\nright so like this is the kind of thing\nwhere if you're trying to decide okay\nwhat am i going to do i'm making all\nthese sacrifices\nbecause like basically what you're\ntalking about is almost like not really\nbeing an artist it's almost more like\nbeing an entrepreneur especially our\ncontent creator especially in today's\nday and age\nwhere for example like you know some\npeople who are successful at making web\ncomics\nare very good at a lot of things besides\nmaking web comics\nso for example you'll see you know\nsocial media posts about particular web\num you know they'll have uh they'll put\nup like a good patreon page things like\nthat\nso there's a lot of stuff here that i\nthink if you you're what i'm basically\nkind of hearing you say is like i don't\nknow if i should continue doing this or\nnot doing it\nis that\nfair to say\num can i just say something yeah you are\nseem pretty aware of what the industry\nis is by everything you said like you\nseem to be pretty knowledgeable about\nwhat's going on so\njust wanted to say that i mean i i don't\nknow about webtoons but like i said i've\nworked with a lot of artists and that\nbecause i just don't know like if you\nwere talking about writing a book that's\na process i'm way more familiar with but\nmy point is that becoming so because you\ntalk you're talking about money right so\nthere's like a difference between like\nbeing an artist and paying your bills as\nan artist and my point is that paying\nyour bills as an artist as we look at\nmany artists who died penniless right\nwho now we revere their works of art\nthere's like this like simple thing\nwhere it's like\nyou know being able to pay your bills is\nmore about some of this other stuff\nand what i'm hearing from you there may\nbe issues of confidence or or this or\nthat or losing yourself or things like\nthat but like my biggest concern is that\nyou're grinding eight to nine hours a\nday seven days a week but i'm not\nhearing like much of a business plan\nlike i don't know like okay so you join\nthis contest that sounds good like\nthat's the kind of concrete stuff that\ni'm kind of thinking about and that's\nwhere i think like\nyou know if i i mean i don't know that\nwe're gonna we're not gonna have time to\ndo this because when i've worked with\nartists it's been longitudinally and\nstuff like that but usually it's sort of\nlike sitting down and sort of thinking\nabout okay so you've given yourself\naugust of 2023 that sounds like a\nfantastic end point\nbut i think the key thing to remember\nthere is whether august of 2023 is\nsuccessful or a failure is going to\ndepend on what you do in that time which\ncan be more than storyboarding\nand working on your art\nright like what's the end point\nso it in business for example there's\nthis phrase called kpi which is key\nperformance indicator\nand my biggest concern for you is that i\ndon't know\nhow to measure\nwhether you're on the right track or not\nyeah\nand i think like\naside business things it just\ni think it stems from the\nthe fear of not doing enough\ni guess\nbecause i know i'm i'm working a lot in\nall the communication i think it's just\nmy my biggest\nflaw i just i'm not communicating enough\non my project\ni'm just doing a few stories on\ninstagram and posting a few stuff there\nand there once it's done\nbut i'm not taking the time\nto just to talk about it because i feel\nlike hey man maybe you should work on\nthis thing hey it's not done enough work\nand work at work again\nand\ni'm not taking the time to just talk\nabout it\ntalk about it you mean like social media\nwise\nyeah yeah\nso i i know this sounds kind of weird\npierre because i i'm not sure if you\nwere like looking for more of like an\ninternal exploration but honestly what\ni'm hearing from you is like more nuts\nlike i i think that\ni don't know how to say this but like no\namount of internal exploration is going\nto be a substitute for playing the game\nof the industry\nyeah\nand what i'm hearing is that you\nactually seem very introspective you\nseem very devoted to your art you seem\nlike you feel very confident in an idea\nthat you've got\nand so what worries me more about you is\nnot\nany of that stuff\nbecause you like i said like most people\nare are struggling to make the the leap\nright\nlike we started this off by saying\nyou're really different from most people\nbecause most people play it safe and\nthey're never able to make the leaf and\ncommit to their art since you've already\ngiven everything up\nwhat concerns me the most is now that\nyou've jumped off the cliff\nhow do we help you land the best\ndoes that make sense\nyeah i start it starts to make sense\nyeah and so this is where i'd start like\nyou know my first thought is like you\nhave access to this discord server i\ndon't know if people on the discord\nserver if you've talked to them about\nhow they've become successful and\nfinancially stable\nhave you talked to them about huh no i\ndon't know yeah so i think you need to\nlike\nuse these opportunities to like try to\nfigure out how an artist\nbecomes financially stable\nso like and this is what i see with\nartists is that you'll devote yourself\nto your craft\nbut you can write the best like as we've\nseen from artists in the past they'll\ndie penniless\nbecause they don't know anything about\nlike marketing or selling right and\nthat's the real challenge of being an\nartist is that everyone makes it seem\nlike it's this creative pursuit but the\ntruth of the matter is if you're talking\nabout art for the sake of paying your\nbills then you've got to be a little bit\nmore like entrepreneurial\nso i would start by asking people\non your discord server hey like so this\nis my situation i'm kind of curious\nhow do you make ends meet\ndo you feel like there's a how do you\nbalance like artistic development versus\nlike taking freelance gigs\nbecause the other kind of thing that i'm\nkind of wondering pierre is on a very\nvery basic level if this is a long-term\nproject where it's going to take two or\nthree years of like storyboarding and\nrevising and stuff like that\nand you can't sustain yourself\nfinancially then like it may be a better\ndecision because i've been in situations\ni've worked with people who are like\nthis where even to a certain degree been\nin this situation myself where like\ni can't afford to make art for three\nyears without paying bills so i'm gonna\nget a job and sustain myself and it's\ngonna take me five years instead of\nthree but that's actually like the\nbetter plan\nyeah\nand what i'm really hearing from you is\nis that you've got to figure this out\nlike more practically like let's just\nassume that your art is going to be\nsuccessful if you play your cards right\nyeah\nso it it goes like a conversation of\nbusiness conversation and\nlike all\nbusiness tips and stuff well i mean not\ni'm i'm sorry if it\nit's not you know the typical\nconversation no i mean it doesn't bother\nme i love having this conversation\ni think it's a conversation we actually\ndon't have enough in this community\nbecause i think you rp are someone who's\nlike you've overcome\nyour expectations and overcome you know\nlike\nmoney and like you've you've like taken\nthe plunge and so now the issue is for\npeople who've taken the plunge like how\ndo we understand okay like who or who\nwould potentially buy your comic who\nwould pay for your webtoon who are the\ncommunities\nthat\nwould like support you on patreon right\neven if you're offering something unique\nthere may be a particular audience how\ndo you get in front of those communities\nyou know how do you know like let's say\nyou take it to an editor and an editor\nsays okay we're not going to buy this at\nthis time\nhow do you know\nwhat you need to change for that person\nto say yes\nlike these are the kinds of things that\ni'm not really hearing from you which\ni'm afraid the only reason that bothers\nme is because you're trying to pay your\ni don't know bills my bills is not it's\nnot an issue like i i forgot to give a\nlittle bit of context says\ni'm currently living in my in my parents\nhouse at the moment\nso i got food i got the yeah yeah so so\ni i i sort of got that right so i didn't\nask you how you're sustaining yourself\nbecause you're saying i'm not making any\nmoney so i i i put two or two together\nthere but my point is that even by\naugust 2023 like my worry is that you'll\nspend seven days a week nine hours a day\nmaking art storyboarding making art\nstoryboarding\nbut you're so disconnected from your\naudience\nthat after that year you show up with\nsomething and it's like not what people\nare looking for or you haven't built\nenough like social media stuff over time\nor like whatever\nbecause i've even i've i've even like i\ndon't know if you've heard of um\nuh this guy named have you ever heard of\na guy named brandon sanderson\nyep so brandon sanderson actually had a\npodcast i think he still got it but the\npodcast was basically with three people\nand one of the people is a webcomic\nperson\nand so he talks a lot about like they\ntalk about like how to be successful as\na wed webcomic artist and what it takes\nand stuff like that so i'm getting the\nsense that you know from an art\nstandpoint you seem solid it's just like\nhow do we how do you think through\nthings\nso that\nyou know how to present your art\ni got a question do you think i'm self\nsabotaging here because i got a feeling\ni am what i'm aware of\ni'm aware of everything you said here\nbut i feel like there's a part of me\nwhich is trying to\nyou know not do this job and just to\nfocus on\nthe art i'm doing\nas\nsome kind of\nescape of\nresponsibilities i have and\na success but i don't know if i want\nlike if that's something i have built\nfor many many years\nbut it's like i'm\nso close to it but i'm not putting all\nthe tools there to have it\nand i know i have to do it\nbut i don't do it i'm just doing art\ndoing my thing on this side\ndo i think you're self-sabotaging i mean\nif you if you're asking the question\nmaybe but here's\nhere's what i'd say\nyeah\ni know a lot of artists who really like\nmaking art\nand i know a lot of artists who don't\nlike anything except for making art\nand here's the thing to understand about\nsuccess so a lot of times people think\nthat success is being really really\nreally good at one thing\nbut in my experience being successful is\nbeing really really good at one thing or\neven decent at one thing but it also\nrequires a minimum competence in a bunch\nof other stuff that you may not like\ndoing\nand the artists that\ni've worked with\nwho are more successful like objectively\ni'm not talking about the quality of\ntheir art i mean can pay their bills\npeople know who they are the reach of\ntheir audience are the ones who focused\nyou know they still primarily focus on\ntheir art but they don't ignore the\nother stuff\nso\nis this\nis there something psychological going\non sure\nbut i think the real question is like if\nyou know you need to do this stuff like\ni'm not so sure that it's psychological\nhonestly it sounds to me a little bit\nmore operational which means that you're\nyou've just never done this before so\nyour brain literally doesn't know the\nsteps\nyeah like if i is scaring me yeah so\nthen that's normal that's just because\nit's like if i tell you pierre you know\nyou say you've you've had several\ngirlfriends before but if you'd never\ndated anyone and i'm like go get a\ngirlfriend it's going to be like scary\nto people right because they've never\ndone it before\nso this is where i mean is it\nself-sabotage i don't think so i don't\nget the sense that this is like a deep\npsychological like\nyou know i mean i have no idea if we\nspent a lot of time together maybe\nit would be the case but i don't get the\nsense that you're like like trying to\nshoot your success in the foot i think\nthe problem is that you've figured out\nthat you're good at one thing there's\none thing that excites you you can grind\ntowards one thing and there's a lot of\nstuff that you don't really like know to\nhow to even start with\nthat\nlike\nso you don't know how to start so you\ndon't know how to do it\nwhat do you think about that\ni'm thinking\nno i think it's just\nthe main fear i have you may fear it's\nnot fear it's just\nsomething i'm not used to is just when\ni'm seeing all these people are selling\nthemselves on social media\nthey seem false this is not not real\nand\nthat's something i cannot do\neven if we force me to do it it's\nsomething i cannot do because the most\nthe people that are mostly successful by\nselling art and doing stuff\nare people\non social media speaking of it on social\nmedia are people that\nare playing a game\nof trends and things that\ni'm not\ngood at at all\nand even if i force myself to do it i\ncan't\ni really can't\nso i think you've got to be careful\nthere because you're assuming that first\nof all people on social media are fake\nand secondly that you have to be fake to\nsucceed on social media\ni i think that a lot of people on social\nmedia are fake\nbut i think that\npeople\nthe audience of social media is tired of\nfake people on social media\nand there's actually a hunger for\nauthenticity\nand i i would say\nyou know if you're\nif we want to talk about self-sabotage\nif you're concluding in your mind that i\nhave to be fake to be successful i'm not\nsaying that being faker will make you\nmore successful\nbut i i think that there's like\ni mean even the story that you're\nsharing today i think a lot of people\nwould resonate with\nyeah\nand that's what you know i would love to\nhear people like that yeah so that\nthat's good so that's why i think like\nwhat what what i would kind of do is\nlike\nyou know i mean you got to be careful\nbecause i don't really know your\nsituation but i would start by talking\nto people on your discord and just ask\nthem\nhey do you have some time to talk i'd\nlove to learn about like your creative\nprocess how do you manage like art\nversus like\nyou know creating art versus paying\nbills free links to gigs versus not\nfreelance gigs\nhow many hours a week do you work\nhow do you storyboard you know how much\ntime do you spend how how long did it\ntake you from the first\nidea to like getting your first finished\nwebcomic\nfor whatever website you want editors to\npay you for i would also approach them\nhey i have these three chapters they're\nin this competition\nis this something that y'all would be\ninterested in\nwhat are y'all looking for right now\nright so like asking some of those\nquestions and that's where you may say\nlike oh my god it's my art i never want\nto compromise an inch of it which is\ntotally fine\nbut what you may find and this has been\nmy experience as a content creator is\nthat like\nmy range is actually pretty wide\nand i'm actually okay adapting a little\nbit to what people are looking for\njust to give you an example when i\nstarted streaming before my first stream\ni spent three months\nindexing\nlike 150 scientific papers\nbecause i was convinced that when i show\nup on twitch\neveryone is super skeptical and\neveryone's gonna want references and\ncitations and sources\nand what i was really surprised by is\nlike i didn't get any questions about\nscience i got tons of questions about\nspirituality\nand like even though i had this idea of\nwhat i wanted to share which is i wanted\nto teach people about mental health\nit turned like more into a spiritual\nkind of thing and like i was actually\nokay making that adaptation and there\nmay be adaptations that you're actually\nokay making\nbut my point is that right i think your\nbiggest problem honestly pierre is that\nyour it sounds like you're working in a\nstudio for like 70 hours a week without\nlike talking to anyone\nyeah that's that's kind of a thing and\nso i think if you want to be successful\nthat's not about the quality of your art\nthat's about communication between your\nart and the rest of the world\nit takes time right\nsure which is why if you've got till\naugust 2023 i think that's fantastic but\ni think the earlier you get started the\nbetter and i'm not saying make any\ncommitments i'm just saying start having\nconversations so you understand what is\nout there and like what it's going to\ntake\nit's it's it's bizarre because\neverything you say i'm\nquite aware of all this stuff i made i\nmade this conscious choice to work\ntirelessly on this thing because it\ntakes so much so much time like\nit's\ni know that i have to communicate on all\nthe stuff i know that i have to\nshare my my story out there i know that\ni've know some do some because i'm\nalready doing it in a way on instagram\ni'm just\nsharing stuff there i'm\nposting there i'm trying to find\nsolutions to change how i post them it's\njust\ni don't feel like i'm doing enough and\nif i'm trying to do more\nwill be okay\nlike do i do i have to change something\nthe way i express myself is it is it\ngood or not it's just\npierre so i'm hearing you're asking\ndo i need to be doing more am i doing\nenough and my point is that i don't i\ndon't think your problem is one of\nwhat's the right move\ni think your problem is not one of\ntreatment it's one of diagnosis\ni think your problem is that you don't\nknow how to answer those questions yet\nright you don't know am i doing enough\nor not so how do you know how do you\nanswer the question of am i doing enough\non social media\ni don't know you ask other people\nso that you understand what the average\nis\nso i i think you need more information\nfrom other people in your industry which\nmay be a very unsatisfying answer i\ndon't i mean because oftentimes it's\nlike you know like oh like tell me about\nyour upbringing and stuff like that but\nhonestly this is the kind of thing where\nlike a bro honestly i want to see you\nsucceed\nbut i think whether you succeed or not\ndoesn't\ni mean there may be a certain amount of\nlike internal stuff like why is it hard\nfor you to have these conversations\nlike there may be some kind of shame or\nlike you feel embarrassed to ask or like\nthere may be some internal stuff but\nwhat i'm saying is like very practically\nyou've got to figure out like what's\nyour business model for success as an\nartist\nno i\nto be to be fair like the fact that\nyou're just telling me that it's just\npractical stuff it's just reassuring\nthat means that i'm okay\nyeah i'm doing fine\nhey\nthen if i if i should shift the\nconversation elsewhere it's\nwhat am i going to do\nin august 2023\nif it fails\nand this thing\nscares me\nso much\nso so much because i have\nno clue what to do\nno clue it's like this thing i've been\ncarrying for so so so long i've been\nworried\nit's not bragging or anything i hate to\nsay this but\nit's just i've been working on this\nthing for so so long and i know there's\nthis thing in my mind going like hey man\nyou've been working on this thing for so\nlong you deserve success you deserve\nthis but\nanother part of me is saying hey man the\nword doesn't work like that they don't\ncare about you\nso here's what i\nso this is gonna sound kind of weird too\nso i've got two kind of answers to that\nthe one one is that you\nyou may have to deal with a certain\namount of that now but i think trying to\nsolve that problem of 2023 now is a\nwaste of your time\nand what i mean by that is that\nso like because\nwhat happens in 2023 depends on i don't\ni know this is gonna sound weird but\nwhat happens in 2023 depends on what\nhappens in 2023.\nso when august of 2023 rolls around\nwhat do you do\nwell that depends like maybe in august\nof 2023 you've got\na patreon page with four subscribers\nand maybe in august of 2023 you've got\nzero subscribers maybe in august of 23\n2023 you've got a hundred patriot\npatrons\nmaybe in august of 2023 the editor says\nhey i really think that you're on to\nsomething but we're looking for\nsomething that's more appealing to this\ngroup\nand so what i'm saying is like it's it's\nlike there's no point in figuring out\nwhat you're going to do after 2023\nbecause your position in 2023 could be\nin a like 10 different places yeah\nit's left to randomness right right so\nso and i think that's why it's like kind\nof like\nyou know\nonce again in medicine it's sort of like\nwell what if the test comes back\npositive well like let's see what the\ntest shows\nbecause with the results of the test\ninform the next steps\nand so the only tricky thing there is\nthat you're gonna have to move forward\nwith some amount of like fear and\nuncertainty just hanging out with you\ni'm not saying it's easy to do that\nright like because that that worry is\ngoing to be in your head and you've\nyou've got to live with that\nyeah i'm working with it every morning\nbut yeah i mean so that's challenging\nand so meditate and all that other good\nstuff but i think at the end of the day\nlike we can't figure out what to do in\naugust of 2023 because like who knows\nlike maybe you'll win this context\ncontest and then 14 editors will be like\nwe want your webtoon and then you'll\nbecome you really created something\nunique and the internet absolutely loved\nit and then suddenly like you've got a\nmerch store and people are ordering\nprints and like who the hell knows\nwhat's going to happen in august 2023.\nin august of 2019 like no one predicted\nkovid\nso i'd say like focus on what you've got\nto do this week the next week the week\nafter that i'd be really careful about\nnot being too\nzoomed in\non just making your artwork and\nrecognize that some things don't take a\nlot of work\nbut it takes time to grow\nright so like there's a difference\nbetween building something and like\ngrowing something\nand i wouldn't wait until\nyou know july of august 2023 to plant\nthe seed\nof social media\noh no no i would be doing like i'll be\nworking on social media like i would be\nsharing stuff by saying hey it's going\nto add yeah so all of its i think some\ngoing on there chapters on you can read\nit there they are there but it's not\ngoing out to be like all all social\nmedia like doing\nreals and it's just going to be pretty\nbasic but because i don't have time to\ndo more\njust yeah that's okay but so that that's\nwhere like i i think you're trying to\nsolve a lot of problems without the\nappropriate information pierre that's\nlike kind of the beginning of end of\nwhat i'm hearing like that's the most\nimportant thing so i talk to these\npeople on this discord and try to figure\nout like how this works whatever website\nyou're trying to get to try to do that\neven uh you know whatever call to action\nlike that all sounds like good stuff you\njust got to figure this stuff out\nand that is like you can't you can try\nto figure out on your own but the whole\npoint is that you're in this private\ndiscord server that is invite only with\nsuccessful artists so you've got a lot\nof information at your fingertips\nand you'd be amazed at how much you can\nlearn by just asking people\nokay\nsure\nthanks for calling in man\ni'm doing i'm doing good i guess\ni wasn't expecting to have this\nconversation i i thought i was going to\nhave like oh man maybe you should change\nyour career or\nmaybe you're not doing the good choice\nor something like that but no it's just\nno apparently\nthe thing that\nnot most people are doing yeah so i mean\nto to summarize pierre i think it's not\nmy place to say that you should change\nyour career it was a mistake or not a\nmistake sure sure yeah what i'm hearing\nis that you've taken the plunge and\nyou've made a lot of sacrifices so my\nprimary concern is now like\nhow can we make sure that those\nsacrifices are as worth it as we can\nmake it\nyeah\nyeah good luck to you my friend\nyeah good luck to you to you too thank\nyou take care\nyou too bye\nokay\nso quick summary so that's kind of\ninteresting so first of all it's cool to\nhave\nyou know artists in our community\num\ni think it is interesting because\nsometimes the challenge that we have\nis like how do i take the plunge how do\ni quit my dead end job how do i make\nthese sacrifices and we almost like\nfantasize that if i make all these\nsacrifices\nand i devote myself to my craft then i\nwill be successful\nbut the truth of the matter is like\nmaking the sacrifices is a really\nimportant but also insufficient step\nthen there's a lot of other stuff that\nyou have to do\nwhich is more than the madness of the\ncreation creative process in your studio\nand sometimes like this is what i've\nseen with a lot of artists is like\nreally the ones who are successful\nversus the ones who are less successful\nwe're talking about like\nfame\nmoney like those are the barometers of\nsuccess i'm not commenting on the\nquality of their art i don't know how to\njudge that\nit's actually the ones who spend um have\na minimum amount of competence in a lot\nof these other dimensions\nsocial media\nrelationships networking even to certain\ndegree like discipline and taking care\nof themselves and waking up on time and\ngoing to bed on time and things like\nthat\nlike that's the stuff that you really\nhave to do i mean like so for example\nyou can be the most brilliant doctor in\nthe world\nat least in the united states\nbut unless you are up to date with your\ndocumentation and your cme and a bunch\nof other administrative crap like you're\nnot going to make it\nas a doctor\nbecause being a doctor is not just about\npracticing medicine it's about\nall of the administrative stuff that\ncomes with practicing medicine\nand that's true of like any profession\nright there's like the actual work of\nthe profession and there's all the stuff\nthat you do on the side\nso that you can do the work of the\nprofession and oftentimes artists\nbecause it's so much about craft and\npassion and vision and creating\nsomething unique\nthat like we kind of lose sight of that\nother stuff\nand oftentimes it's the stuff that you\ndon't enjoy doing you haven't done don't\nknow how to do it's like business kind\nof stuff\nbut i've really just noticed a big\ndifference between artists who are aware\nof that stuff and artists who aren't\ncase in point you know brandon sanderson\nhas a podcast about all of this other\nstuff and look at where he is\nyou"
