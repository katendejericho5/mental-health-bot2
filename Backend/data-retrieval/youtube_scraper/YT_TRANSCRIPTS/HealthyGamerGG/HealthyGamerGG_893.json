    "transcript": "you want to be proud of your grades and\nif you're really proud of your grades\nit's like other people can be upset with\nit but when we're confident in ourselves\nother people can say whatever they want\nto and it won't affect us but what i'm\nhearing from you is like you're not\nshowing your parents because they're\nstill going to be disappointed in you\nbecause that's like it's not perfect\nwhich means they're not going to be\nhappy hello\nyeah you can call me david okay nice to\nmeet you david so i think the topic\ntoday is what do you want to be and\nwhat's getting in the way\nyeah\nso\nwhen i answered the prompt i kind of\nsaid that i want to be a lot of things\nthere's like a lot of goals that i have\nin mind for life like i want to be\nfinancially successful socially adept\nsomeone that's generally confident kind\nof what\npeople have in their head when they\nthink of like\na good person kind of like you know\nlike a chat okay\nand and so what are the elements of a\ngiga chad explain that to us david\ni guess they're like confident who they\nare they're\nfinancially successful\nat least in my head that's what i would\nthink they're healthy they're generally\nhave a good circle of friends they have\nhealthy relationships they're secure in\ntheir attachments and in those\nrelationships\nsomeone's been doing some homework\nsecuring their attachment okay\nand where are you in relation to all of\nthis stuff\ni'd say i'm pretty far removed i\ni'm in university right now so i don't\nhave\na career per se\nbut\num i am pretty nervous because i\ngraduate this year i'm gonna be\ngraduating about\neight months from now okay and i don't\nhave like a career prospect i don't have\nlike\ni haven't really put much thought into\nwhat i'm going to be doing you know i\nhaven't applied to jobs i haven't done\nan internship but i haven't done any of\nthat as like people my age i see them\ngetting involved\nthere\nthey we have something in co-op called\nco-op where i'm from where your\nuniversity helps you find a career\nrelated to your field\nand you work with them for\na period of 16 months so four semesters\nand you graduate with like kind of your\nfoot in the door you know whereas i\ndon't have any of them i'm kind of just\ngraduating\nso you didn't do co-op\ni just didn't have that option like it's\nnot in my\ni see okay\nand and can i ask what you're studying\nyeah i'm studying something like it's\nkind of weird it's it's called graphic\ncommunications management but it's\nactually like\nprinting like industrial printing but\nyou can also go into graphic design or\npackaging\nand stuff like that\nokay\num\nand\nso it sounds like you want to be a lot\nof things confident financially stable\nhealthy social have secure attachment\nso it sounds like you're\non track to graduate so i suppose\ncongratulations or condolences i'm not\nquite sure\ni guess it's an achievement but i don't\nreally like i guess i'm not very nice to\nmyself in that sense i'm just like\nuh i graduated but yeah that's what\nyou're supposed to do right like i\nhaven't done anything special i feel\nokay\nso\nhmm let me can i think for a second\nyeah go ahead\nwhat about um health social stuff\nhealth wise i think i'm all right i go\nto the gym pretty regularly\ni have a routine and everything but it's\nnot like\ni just do it because i kind of have to\nit's just like a duty thing right like\nyou do it because you have to you don't\ndo it because\nyou want to okay\nand how\nis that okay that you do it because you\nhave to\ni mean people always talk about how\nafter you look up for a little bit it\nbecomes a little bit addicting and you\nwant to do it but i've never really had\nthat like\nit it still takes like willpower and for\nme to do it which i guess is what i\nwould call discipline\ndoes it\nfeel like you're disciplined\ni guess in keeping with that routine yes\nbut with other aspects of my life\nprobably not\nhow do you feel about yourself\nin in general yeah\nthat's a tough question i'm not too sure\nsome days it's like yeah i'm doing\npretty alright i think i'm doing pretty\nwell and other days it's like what the\nhell am i doing what am i like here for\ni don't i haven't done anything with my\nlife you know\nokay\nwhen are you supposed to have done\nsomething with your life\nthat's a good question\ni guess it just depends on who you are\nlike i could look at someone that's my\nage like they're people in my age that\nare\nhave signed like their rookie contract\nin the nba they're making six million\nseven million dollars a year\nwhereas there are other people my age\nthat are\nyou know not in university they may be\ndropped out of high school\nyou know maybe they're not employed or\nin education or anything so it's hard to\nsay\nyeah so you bring up a really good point\ndavid\nthat\nyou know when are you supposed to be a\ngiggy chad\nbut\ni think it could happen at any point in\nyour life right\nyeah\nso and then you also kind of pointed out\nthat like i asked you you know when are\nyou supposed to\nbe\nsuccessful basically and you said that\ndepends on who you look at\nthere are people i could compare myself\nto\nthat are more successful than i am and\naccording to you basically\nand there are people i could look at who\nare less successful than i am\nso how you're doing\ndepends on who you compare to\nyeah so it's all like relative right\nyeah so i wonder if there's anything\nelse like you know whether you're\nsuccessful or not whether you're happy\nwith where you are how you feel about\nyourself\nanything else that you could\nset that bar to\nas opposed to comparing to someone\nreally successful or comparing to\nsomeone not successful at all\nmaybe someone just like me like someone\nthat's in university yeah someone just\nlike you\ni like that idea who is the person who\nis most like you\ncan we argue that the closer we get to\nyou the better the comparison will be\nbut i guess it also depends on kind of\nwhat objective you're trying to achieve\nwith that comparison right good\nexcellent what objective are we trying\nto achieve with the comparison\nwell it's hard to say maybe to determine\nwhether i'm successful or not excellent\nright\nso like we have to like if we're going\nto make comparisons let's try to make\nthe fairest comparison right\nyeah so like you know if you're\nsuccessful like what's your net worth\nlike i'm i'm 21 years old and i run a 10\nmillion dollar company\nthat i started three years ago\nwhen i got a 20 million dollar\ninvestment from my parents and three\nyears later it's worth 10. i built it\nyou're going to compare yourself to that\nguy\nprobably not right right\nat all yeah\nso how who is the closest person we can\ncompare you to\ni would guess someone\nin the same program as me who doesn't\nfeel too secure about their prospects\nafter they graduate excellent\nand do you know anyone like that\ni know people who are nervous but i'm\njust like our situations aren't the same\nbecause\nyou've had the opportunity to have like\nthey've done an internship elsewhere\nthey've sucked they've won out right\nyeah\nlike on their own accord and i haven't\ndone that how can we get to someone even\ncloser than that\nsomeone that tried to but didn't or i\nguess maybe not even chat because i\ndidn't try\nyeah\nso is there anyone that you know who's\nin your major that didn't try to get an\ninternship etc etc\nwell\nmy situation is a little bit special i\nkind of had the option to do one but\nuh\nit's a pick and choose you can choose to\ndo an internship for like three months\nor\nyou can go abroad for international\nexchange i chose innovation\nyou you chose what\ninternational exchange like an exchange\nprogram abroad\nin a different country\nfor six months and how do you feel about\nthat\nwell i've already done it\ni'm glad i did it it's like a very\ntransformative experience you meet like\ntons of different types of people and\nsee how things are different like\nhalfway across the world i went to\neurope and i'm from north america\nbut\ni come back and it's like i'm missing\nthat like kind of foot in the door now i\ndon't have that\nthat experience that other everyone else\ndoes right\nyeah so so i think what we're sort of\ngetting to david is that\nyou know the person you should really be\ncomparing yourself to is yourself\nyeah probably right\nand and this this is where i think we've\nsort of discovered does that make sense\nlike because as you pointed out like so\nour mind so let's take a step back\nyou don't feel confident in yourself\nright\nyou're like\ni'm doing what i'm supposed to at my age\nand when are you supposed to be a giga\nchad not yet but also\ni kind of don't feel good about myself\neven though you're kind of doing what\nyou're supposed to be doing\nso\nand yet you don't feel great about\nyourself\nand then as you pointed out depending on\nwho i compare myself to like when are\nyou supposed to be\nwhat you strive to be\nlike when are you supposed to be like\nconfident financially stable healthy\nhave a healthy social circle\nmaybe in a significant in a relationship\nwith a significant other sure as hell is\nnot supposed to be eight months before\nyou graduate i can guarantee you that\ni was kind of thinking like the earlier\nthe better right why\nbecause that's kind of just life right\nif you're a morehead that's like life is\nprobably better unless that's wrong\ni i mean if you're ahead what does what\ndoes that mean\nlike having a\ngood circle of friends around you a good\nsupport system developing those early\ngetting into good habits like exercising\netc\nis it a competition\nit kind of feels like one like it kind\nof does\nyeah just like a rat race kind\nyeah\nbut is it\ni guess when you really think about it\nno but\ni think the world is set up in a way\nwhere it's kind of designed to be right\nyeah 100\nthe world tries to compare you to other\npeople all the time\nbecause there are people out there david\nwho are thinking to themselves oh my god\ni wish i was like\ndavid is david\nmuch better than me because he's\nexercising regularly and this guy is\ndisciplined he doesn't even want to work\nout\nbut he still works out\nand he's graduating and i dropped out of\nschool\nwhat it's useless to compare\nright\nso this is where like i'd say a couple\nthings the first is\nwhere you are i think is developmentally\nappropriate do you know what that term\nmeans\nlike\nthe way i see the world and the way i\nearn this appropriate for where i'm at\nin my old the stage i'm at 100\ni do not expect a 21 year i mean uh i\ndon't know how old you are but someone\nis eight months away from graduating\nfrom college to be financially stable\nhave all their social life sorted out\nlike what's the job of a college student\nuh studying\nkind of set their life up for success\nlater in life sounds like you're\nexercising sounds like you're gonna\ngraduate sounds like you've got some\nstuff to figure out\nwhat do you think\ni think i have a lot to figure out\nthough i agree you have a lot to figure\nout\nhow long do you have to figure it out\nit again it depends i guess\nfigure out like no doubt\ndoes it not really nope\nliterally how long do you have to figure\nit out\nlike everything i guess i have my whole\nlife absolutely\nthe amount of time you have is until you\ndie that's like literally\nhow long you have to figure it out\nwhat do you think about that\ni feel like there's a good time and a\nbad time to figure things out i think\nthere's like such a thing as figuring\nthings out too late\nand\nwhich may put you behind which brings us\nto the whole thing about it not being a\ncompetition but it definitely feels that\nway yeah have you figured things out too\nlate david\nhas that happened to you before\nthere are things that i know that i\ndon't know\nthat i feel like i'm behind on\nso what are you gonna do about it\nthe easy answer would be to say figure\nit out but no one tells you how\nright good\nso\nhow are you feeling about this\nconversation\nuh\ni'm not sure i don't know like kind of\nif it's going to change the way i see\nthe world or the way i'm thinking\nwhat i'm going to learn from it yep\ni completely agree\nwe're just a little unsure yeah so\nwe're gonna\nwe're gonna try to share something with\nyou we'll see whether it changes things\nor not but i'm asking a lot of questions\ni'm i think you're giving all the right\nanswers i think that this is where like\nmaybe i can help you\nsynthesize into a hypothesis that\nyou're you've put together so\ndavid i think that there's some like\nthere's advice that we give people right\nso like number one is don't compare to\nother people and what you've actually\nreally done is given us a very good\nargument for why that is\nbecause it's sort of like you know\nthere's no point in comparing your like\nbecause you're just not in that\nsituation\nand if comparison is off the table\nbecause it's it's really like it's just\nuseless like it's like\nif i heaven forbid at the age of 15 got\ninto a car accident where i had a\ncerebral hemorrhage\nand lost a part of my brain like it's\nuseless to compare myself to people who\nlike that didn't happen to\nyou know what's acceptable or not\nacceptable what's appropriate or not\nappropriate whether i'm ahead or behind\nyou can look at anyone else and as you\npointed out depending on your comparison\nyou will be ahead and depending on your\ncomparison you will be behind\nand even if you are ahead\nyou won't be happy\nbecause\nit's because that's not where happiness\ncomes from because you are ahead of some\npeople right\nright yeah does it make you happy\nno so like let's say you started like\nworking out more than you did or you\nhave a gpa that's slightly better than\nanother human being elsewhere on the\nplanet is that going to make you more\nhappy\nit might give me like a little bit of\npride of knowing that i'm doing well\nand that i'm doing like i'm good at\nsomething but\nthat will give you pride\nbut doing well\nand knowing how to do something has\nnothing to do with comparison\nthat comes from within\nyeah\nright so it depends on whether you're\nmeasuring up against like what you care\nabout\nor whether you're comparing to someone\nelse\ndoes that make sense because you're\nahead of some people and it's not like\nyou're 50 happy because you're ahead of\n50 people\nlike sure you can take every universe\nevery university student in your school\nyou can rank them and you can\nobjectively be somewhere i you can do\nthat but it's not like moving up five\nranks or moving down five ranks makes\nyou happier\nright\nright yeah\nso this is where i think there are a\ncouple of things that we gotta sort of\nthink about so then it's like okay so\nyou're you know we're on this call and\nyou're like okay so what do i do about\nit\nbecause i'm not confident in myself so\nthat's why i'd say like number one is\nlike you know what you should really\nlike your confidence and stuff is gonna\ncome from your satisfaction with\nyourself it's not going to come from\noutperforming someone else\nagree or disagree\ni i agree so like now we get to so how\ndo you move forward from here like why\nare you not confident in yourself i\ndon't mean that as like a deep\nexistential question i mean like\nliterally what are you unhappy with\nabout yourself\ni would just say i'm just not happy that\ni haven't been able to achieve a lot of\nthings that i feel like i shouldn't like\nwhat like\ni\nuh maybe these are out of my control but\ni haven't really made friends in\nuniversity\ni was because covered virtual for two\nyears i was i had my first semester in\nperson and i kind of just\nlike i don't know i've changed a lot in\nthe last couple years i was a huge\nshut-in very shy\ndidn't really talk to people had a lot\nof trouble\nwith stuff like that and you've changed\na lot in what way\ni think i can talk to people easier now\nlike\nbased on the fact that i'm here\nyou know i probably wouldn't have done\nsomething like this a couple years ago\ndo you feel good about yourself for that\nno but there are people that let me know\nthat i should be\nyeah\nso that's kind of tricky right\nso like here you are\nactually like decently on your way to\nbecome a giga chad\ni wouldn't say that but sure i i am\nsaying that\nright\nso i i know you wouldn't\nif you were saying it then i wouldn't\nhave to\nand what do i mean by that like so\nyou're gonna graduate from college\nsounds like you are one hell of a\nshut-in plus the covid pandemic and\nyou're like growing like so here's what\ni see i see like what's happened into\nthe level like what's happening to your\nxb bar david do you play games\nyeah i do what's happening to your xp\nbar\nit's going up right\nare other people going up faster or\nother people higher level than you sure\nbut like your xp bar is going up that's\nwhy i'm confident that you're well on\nyour way to become a giga chad\nnow there's more to that more to it than\nthat but basically what i'm hearing is\nthat\nso you're graduating so that's one step\nforward in the financial standpoint\nconfidence is like your confidence is\nnot increasing despite the fact that\nyou're getting better can we agree with\nthat like objectively you're getting\nbetter you're socially better\nyou're exercising every day\npeople can't see you but you've got a\nnice head of hair you know so that's\nthat's working for you so it sounds like\nyou're healthy sounds like you're\nimproving socially\nand you're also like here which actually\nindicates to me that you will this is a\ngood prognostic sign because you're\nworking on yourself intentionally\nthis is one thing that most people your\nage don't do which is that they just\nkind of like\nafk instead of being like very\nintentional does that make sense\nyeah that does\nso\nand i think it's developmentally\nappropriate like i don't know how to say\nthis david but at 2 21 i'm assuming\nyou're 21 who knows but 22 20 whatever\nhow old are you\n20. okay so you're 20 and you're gonna\ngraduate in eight months\nright so you're like technically you're\nahead of the game because most people\ngraduate when they're 22 right\nyeah\nwhat do you think about that does that\nmake you happier\ni feel like i could have done better\nlike oh i could have graduated in three\nyears instead of four i could have if i\nreally tried i could have\ngraduated last year so now we get to why\nyou're not confident\nokay so i'm going to ask you a question\ndavid\nwhen there is something you could be\nconfident about what does your mind do\nto it\nyeah\nwhat's the word invalidates it very good\nright\ncan you be proud of your you exercising\nregularly\ni could be but like my mind just tells\nme you should be doing this anyway\nexactly so like this is the problem it's\nnot actually that objectively you're\ndoing anything bad\nit's that anytime you have a win\nyour mind doesn't let you record it in\nthe w column\nit takes your double use and shifts them\nover to the l\nright yeah i get what you\nlike\nisn't that weird\nyeah\ni honestly think i know where it comes\nfrom probably from my childhood shocking\nyeah\ntell us if you feel comfortable\nyeah so\nthis isn't exactly childhood but this is\nprobably the one that stands out the\nmost in my mind\nuh i was 18. this was my first semester\nof college\nand\ni had i don't know how the gpa scale is\nin\nin america it's different here where i'm\nfrom but it's basically it goes from\nzero to four point three three four\npoint three three is like the highest\nand anything above like 3.6 is like\nis like an a\nso during my first semester i had a gpa\nof 4.27\nand i showed my parents because they\nwanted to see my how my grades are doing\nand my mom looked at it and i was like\nand she looked at the courses so they\nwere like\na few like most of them were 4.33 and\nthen i had like one 4.00 which is like\nthe next rate down and then she was like\nso you so you need to do better on this\nthis is still bad\nand then after that i kind of just like\ni was a little bit disillusioned i was\nlike okay i'm just not going to show you\nmy grades anymore if that's all you're\ngoing to have to say\nand i haven't shown them since so\nokay so\nhelp us understand david\nbecause you know you're introspective\nand you've got an answer for us what\nconnect these dots for me what does that\nstory or how does that relate to you\nwhat's going on lay it out for us\ni guess i take what i've been told all\nmy life and in my childhood because if\nit was happening then it was after poor\nas well\nand i've kind of internalized it what\nhave you and what were you told and what\nhave you internalized\nthat i'll never be good enough\nwhat do you think about that\nsome days it does feel true like there\nwill always be always be someone better\nthan right that is correct that is a\nstatement of fact there will always be\nsomeone better than you\ni guess it shows through a lot of my\npersonality like i always kind of want\nto be the best in things that i care\nabout\nand why do you want to be the best\ni guess it's just something i've carried\nover from what people have told me sort\nof right so i think the reason you want\nto be the best is because then you'll be\nconfident\nright if you're number one then you'll\nbe happy then you'll be confident\nyou'll have achieved you'll win the race\nand then you'll feel good about yourself\nwith me yeah\nyeah now here's the thing you strive to\nbe number one but every time you take a\nstep forward what do you do with the w\nturn it into an l absolutely you're\nplaying a rigged game\nyou see that you're trying to solve the\nconfidence by achievement\nbut any time you achieve you move it to\nan l\nwhich is how we get someone so let me\nexplain something to you okay this is\ngoing to sound kind of confusing so bear\nwith me david\ni knew a guy once his name was david\nhe was 18 years old started college got\na 4.27 gpa\nhe exercises\nwas a social shut-in years later despite\nthe pandemic is getting socially better\nis basically like doing pretty well in a\nlot of dimensions like has some rough\nparents and things like that\nman\nthat guy is nothing to be proud of right\nbecause he ain't perfect\nyeah that sounds absurd when you say put\nit like that right\nso here's the tricky thing\nthe one thing because you're doing a\nreally good job we already said you're\nintrospective you've come a long way\nokay\nyou may not feel like it yet but\nhopefully i mean who knows we'll see\nwe're gonna just do the best that we can\ntoday and that's all that we can do it's\nnot like we can do better and it's not\nlike we can do worse right and if it's\nnot good enough it's not good enough so\none thing that i want to point out to\nyou about your story that really stuck\nout to me\nwhen your parents saw your report card\nand they said you need to do better at\n4.0 what did you do\nin response\ni became like kind of apathetic and i\nrejected their response incorrect\nthis is the growth point you didn't\nreject their response what did you\ndecide to do physically\nyou shared this with us\ni just stopped showing them my grades\nabsolutely\nand the reason you stopped showing them\nyour grades is because you actually\naccepted it right you didn't reject what\nthey say if you truly rejected what they\nsaid you had kept on showing them report\ncards if they want to be unhappy they\ncan be unhappy that's on them\nright does that make sense\nyeah that does\nthe second you stopped showing them the\nreport card is the second\nthey didn't\nyou didn't need them to tell you anymore\nyou just internalized it\nlike what do you think about that\ni mean like\nmy grades are still the same like\nthroughout these years so i'd say i'm\ndoing all right\npretty well\nbut\ni don't ever like my grades are like one\nof the strong points where i feel like\nyeah i'm doing good i'm doing well i\ndon't really have anything to worry\nabout do you show them to your parents\nno why not\nbecause i know what they're gonna have\nto say about it and how does what they\nsay about it make you feel\nbefore it would probably make me feel\nbad but now it's like i just don't care\nenough or like i don't hold their\nopinion about my grades and that back\nover the guard\nso i think you've learned\nwe don't really know right but i i would\nhypothesize like put something to you\nwhich is that like you still do care\nyou've just learned how to be calloused\nlike it's gonna hurt right because you\nwant to be proud of your grades and if\nyou're really proud of your grades it's\nlike\nyou know like other people can be upset\nwith it but when we're confident in\nourselves other people can say whatever\nthey want to and it won't affect us\nright\nso but what i'm hearing from you is like\nyou're not showing your parents because\nthey're still going to be disappointed\nin you because that's like\nit's not perfect which means they're not\ngoing to be happy\nand you don't want to deal with that\nyeah it's just too much of an edit to\nlike get into an argument about\nsomething yeah right so when we say too\nmuch of a headache like we're going to\ninterpret a little bit there there's\nyou're going to feel hurt\nbecause they're not proud of you\nand since they're not proud of you\nyou know you don't know how to be proud\nof yourself et cetera et cetera we've\nalready kind of covered that you with me\nyeah i'm with you\nso a couple things like what do you\nthink i mean how do we how do you move\nforward from this david\ni guess\nit's a hard question\nyeah growing thought caring\nkind of about what they might have to\nsay yeah so i think eventually\ni hope that you get to a place where\nyou're okay with them not being happy\nwith you\nbecause that's on them like let me ask\nyou a question you don't have to answer\nthis but\ni kind of i'm just trying to think about\nwhether i should ask this question\nokay you don't have to answer this but\nit's tease up because i'm going to give\nyou a hypothetical do you want kids one\nday\ni've always been in the camp of no but\nuh i have a sister and she's pregnant\nand i was like maybe my future will\nchange but i still think i'm like\n70 30. okay no so let me ask you a\nquestion\nif your sister\nif you could transplant consciousness\nwith your sister\nand you had a kid one day and your kid\nafter one semester of college came to\nyou and showed you a 4.27 on a report\ncard what would you say to your kid\ni tell them good job\nthat's\ni don't know probably not what my\nparents said to me but i don't know how\nto like kind of\ncompliment people and tell them i'm\nproud of them that's weird because i've\nnever been chill\nand would you\ntell your kid good job would you be\nproud of them\nwould you think they need to do better\nno i think they'd be doing well\nwould you be happy with that what\nthey've accomplished\ni would be yeah but i think this is like\nanother can of worms maybe like i feel\nlike\nbraids don't matter that much great\nright so there's another can of worms\nand maybe you'd go out and celebrate\nthat's what you do when your kid comes\nhome with a 4.27 out of 4.33 gpa\nright and so then like why would you do\nthat for let's say your niece or your\nchild but like you can't do that for\nyourself it's i guess the answer is just\nit's harder to be proud of yourself for\nsomething else right yep\nthat's a part of it but i think that too\nis because your parents didn't show you\nnot only did they show you not how to\nnot celebrate they didn't show you how\nto be proud of yourself\nso this is something you're gonna have\nto work on\nbut like i would just play with these\nthoughts for a little while david\nso cup\nquestions otherwise i'm going to\nsummarize\ni need to think about that for a second\nuh\ni guess when i'm like talking about like\nwhen people say how to be proud of\nyourself like\nwhat is that feeling like\nlike because i don't know what that\nmeans yeah\nabsolutely i think it's really confusing\nfor you\nand that's okay you'll learn just like\nyou've done a good job in basically all\nthe other dimensions of your life\nright which i know sounds shocking\nbut you're someone who's 20 years old\nabout to graduate from college exercises\nhas a good gpa\nstudied abroad for six months like\nsounds pretty sweet you'll you'll\nrealize this later david\nbut like kind of like i'm saying like so\nfor each of those things like imagine\nyou had a daughter or a kid or son or\nwhatever right and then like\nthey were like\ndad i want to go study abroad for six\nmonths what would you say\nyeah do it i did it and it was great i\nloved it\nright\nand yet somehow your [ __ ] mind moves\nthat into the l column\nyeah i guess i did\neven though your experience\nis positive\nso like\nyou look like you're about to say\nsomething or ask something\noh no i was just thinking about like\nwhen i first wanted to go on exchange\ni told my parents about it they were\nlike no you can't what are you are you\nstupid like why would you want to do\nthat\nso\nas you defied expectations\nwhat was your experience of life\nit was better i got to like experience\nsomething i never would have\nokay\nso let's try to piece things together\nnumber one\nlife gives you expectations\nexpectations come from out there\nas we fulfill expectations\nwe don't actually become happy\ncomparisons are expectations right\ntaller shorter\nsmarter stupider better gpa worst gpa\ndoesn't actually and even as we like\nadvance in the ranks\nright because objectively you're\nprobably in the fifth percentile of\npeople your age in terms of like\nobjective performance what percent\npercent of people exercise regularly\nhave the gpa that you have\nhave studied abroad that number is like\nprobably smaller than five percent\ndoes that feel like you're in the top\nfive percent of course not\nand that's because here's the thing like\nbasically what you've got to do\ndavid\nis like com so here's what we've learned\nokay so first of all expectations come\nfrom the outside\nthere's a voice in here\nand anytime you feel pride in here you\ncompare what you feel in here to what\nthe world says you take that w moving\ninto an l that's why you're not\nconfident\nbecause you don't let yourself be\nconfident\nyou never get to record a w\nright yeah i don't yeah and then we also\nhave like so i can uh sh i can tell you\nyou by all means continue learning this\nlesson on your own but like as you\nadvance so as you want to be confident\nin yourself you've been taught that\nachievement and living up to\nexpectations will make you happy and\nconfident and successful all those three\nthings come together by the way right\nthere can't be teased apart\nyeah right\nit's not like you can be successful and\nhappy like that's insane\nthe idea of being successful and unhappy\nlike can you imagine graduating at the\nage of 21 with a 4.27 gpa being so\nsuccessful and being really unhappy and\nlacking confidence in yourself\nyeah i could because it's like happening\nto me right shocking\nexternal success and living up to\nexpectations and happiness are not one\nand the same\nthe more that you live to satisfy the\noutside world this is what you end up\nwith\nsomeone who's got to be a lot to be\nproud of and doesn't know how to feel\npride\nso what does this mean for you\nso number one\nyou're doing fine relax\nyou'll get there\nit's not a race\nthere's a certain amount of patience you\nneed to have with yourself\nright like you don't need to be\nperfect at the age of 20. you don't even\nneed to be perfect at the age of 30. you\ndon't even need to be perfect you're not\ngoing to be pro you're never going to be\nperfect\nyou could die five years from now you\ncould die tomorrow you could live to six\nlike for 60 more years you got plenty of\ntime so how do we decide if we're not\nlike trying to if it's not a race right\nwhich i acknowledge that society is\ngoing to tell you it's a race like how\ndo you make decisions and i think you've\nmade a couple good ones\nlike you decided to study abroad\nhas it set you back in some ways\nactually yes\nbecause you studied abroad instead of\nhaving work experience\nso just fix that right work on it\nsupplement it\nbut like this this ultimately comes down\nto listening to yourself instead of\nlistening to external people because\nwhen you actually listen to yourself\neven though you made a mistake\nmy god david you made a mistake you\nwasted a semester studying in europe\ninstead of doing an internship\nat dunder mifflin paper company\nbecause you have a degree in industrial\nprinting\nright you made a mistake\nand the thing that you're happiest about\nis the mistake you made david what does\nthat mean for you dude\nmaybe it's not a mistake\nshocking\nso very concretely\nnumber one your development you're\nappropriate right like this is what 20\nlike this is what kids who are\ngraduating\ncollege feel like they're like we\nhaven't figured this crap out yet\nthere's a frontier i don't know if i'm\ngoing to be able to make it i've done\npretty well so far but who knows if any\nof that translates there's a bunch of\nreasonable doubt it's just normal like\nyou're about to graduate college because\nthat's what happens in college before\nyou go to college you're like oh my god\nit's college what's going to happen am i\ngoing to fail out am i going to make\nfriends oh my god what's gonna happen\nthen you do freshman year you do\nsophomore year you learn how to do it\nyou're feeling okay feeling kind of\nconfident maybe even having a little bit\nof fun\nand then\ncollege ends and then you're like oh my\ngod it's the workplace what's gonna\nhappen oh my god am i going to find a\njob am i going to get a job is\neverything going to fall apart and then\nyou're going to be okay maybe a little\nbit of a bumpy ride you're going to do\nokay and then like you're going to start\nrelationships and it's like oh my god\nlike i've never dated before like i\ndon't know what to do like is it going\nto be\nokay that's life\nit's a series of getting good at\nsomething and then becoming a noob again\nit's like climbing mmr it's like i'm\ncrushing these noobs at this mmr and\nthen like i'm\nmoving up a rank and it's like suddenly\ni'm a newbie like it's like it's life\nso completely normal\ndon't worry about it i mean you are\ngoing to worry about it but i just want\nto share that with you even if you can't\ndigest it yet\nright yeah second thing is be super\ncareful\nconcretely about the w's and when you\nmove them to the l's\nlike i want you to catch it in your mind\nwhen it happens\nand ask yourself like why am i moving\nthis to the l column how do i actually\nfeel about this\nlike even if you feel it's okay for\nother people but it's not okay for me\nyou should still acknowledge that\nfeeling\nand be like wow\ni'm setting a really hard standard for\nmyself\nso notice when you transfer the w's to l\nso there's actually\nuh research that shows that people who\nhave imposter syndrome do this\nthey attribute the successes of others\nto effort and hard work but they\nattribute their own successes to luck or\ncircumstances\nthey never take credit\nfor their successes\nso you've just got to start noticing it\nokay my mom would be happy with this but\nlike if i had a kid how would i feel how\nhow would i respond to them\nand then even if you can't do it yet\nnoticing you'll it'll start to happen\nwell i actually have like a little\nanecdote that might that's like related\nto it so\nwhen i first went to europe the first\nmonth there i struggled really badly\nlike i don't know anyone there i kind of\nspeak the language i don't like it\nwasn't an english-speaking country and i\njust self-taught for a few months before\ni went\nso i couldn't really communicate\num\nmy stomach is weird i couldn't eat the\nfood there i was it would just give me\nlike food poisoning every time even\nthough it was like a normal country\nright like there's nothing wrong with it\nit was just me\nbut\nover like time over like second month\nthird fourth month like i started to\nfeel like fine like yeah this is just\nlike now but someone told me it's like\nyou've come so far from your first month\nyou do realize that right i was like\ni sat down and i thought about it i was\nlike yeah i have but\nthat doesn't make me feel anything yes\nlook at that\nturned out your first first month sucked\nand you were okay\nturns out that you got a 4.00 your first\nsemester instead of all 4.33\nand it turns out you're okay\nright\nso just notice these things be patient\nwith yourself even in this\nso i'd also be very careful about one\nconversation to catch me up\nto fix me and turn me into what i'm\nsupposed to be\nthe worst thing i could do for you david\nis have you leave from this conversation\nimagining that you're living up to the\nstandard that you're supposed to be\nwhat you need to do is abandon the\nstandard entirely\nand like listen to yourself\ninstead of what they're telling you\ndon't ignore the outside world right so\nyou should like if you want to get an\ninternship in the last six months like\nhustle\nyou know\ntalk to your school about\njob placements and things like that talk\nto your professors like you should do\nall that work but like doing the work\nand feeling confident about it is\nactually completely independent which\nyou've proven to us today\nright\nyeah\nquestions it's just not to like\nlike when you talk about hustling and\nmaking connections and doing all that\nit's like\ni also feel behind in that aspect like\nsure it's been covered for a couple\nyears i don't really know my professors\ntheir professors i like students that i\nknow who are really close with\nprofessors because they've\nbeen like in lab with them they've done\nta they've ta for them\nstuff like that it's like i don't even\nthink that they would know my name\nokay right so what are you gonna do\nabout that\ni would say change it but i feel like i\njust don't have enough time\nokay\nso you don't have to do that right so i\nthink there are some advantages but this\nis where you start to feel behind in\ntime so i like ignore all the time stuff\nyou have classes now\nuh no i have them in like a couple days\nyeah\ni mean are you in school right now\nyeah i am but school hasn't like started\nyet they start next week so that means\nthat you're going to have a new\nprofessor that you've never had before\nuh it's the same professors generally\nlike it's a pretty small department\nwhere like multiple professors teach\nmultiple classes\nso i just go and introduce yourself\nhow does that feel to you\nsounds weird yes it does sound weird\nand this is where like oh my god i\nhaven't done it for three years how can\ni do it now and it's like that's you i\nmean your your path forward is the same\nwhether you're ahead or you're behind\nlike that's all false like we've\ndetermined that already it's just do\nwhat you need to do say hey i've been in\nyour classes for a couple years my name\nis whatever and then here's the other\nthing that you've got to be super\ncareful about david you're sometimes\nshooting yourself in the foot\nbecause there are things their\nassumptions that you're making\nwhich you're never giving people the\nchance to correct\nso i know that your mom said\nwhy is this a 4.0 but like who knows if\nyou had continued showing them your\nreport cards maybe one of them would\nhave said at some point hey this is a\ngood job i'm proud of you we should go\ncelebrate but you only showed up one\nreport card so you're never giving them\nthe opportunity\nmaybe you'll go introduce yourself to\nyour professor and you'll say hi hey my\nname is dave and he's like yeah i know\nwho you are\nit's been a pleasure having you in the\nclass and you're gonna be like\nyeah i would not expect that at all\ni mean you've got a good gpa in a small\ndepartment i'm pretty sure they know who\nyou are\nmaybe maybe who knows who knows right\nbut so either way they're like whether\nthey know who you are or don't know who\nyou are like you should still just go\nand do it\nand you're gonna feel bad you're gonna\nfeel behind but that's not reality\nthat's all expectations and conditioning\nyeah that's true\ni'd focus on the w's and l's and just\nkeep doing what you're doing because it\nsounds like you're taking care of\nbusiness like one step at a time which\nis exactly what you should be doing\nright\nokay it just feels like i could be doing\nso much more yeah and you're going to\ncontinue to have that feeling\nand as you do more does the feeling go\naway\nprobably won't it will like elevate your\ndoing what i could be doing next i've\nachieved this but it doesn't make me\nfeel anything now exactly\ngood so notice that\nit takes practice david it takes\npractice but you'll get it it definitely\ndoes yeah yeah\nbecause i don't think i've ever really\nlike aside from my grades which i guess\ni also discounted with like that kind of\nworms i felt like yeah my gpa is high\nbut rates don't matter\nwhy like i don't really have a reason to\nbe proud of my grades\nyeah so there's you moving a w to an l\nagain right\nyeah\nso like you're not going to be confident\nor proud of yourself as long as you keep\ndoing that so that's why it kind of goes\nback to that notice every time you do\nthat\nnotice\nhow you try to live up to expectations\nand remember that when you actually\nlisten to yourself instead of listening\nto the expectations oh i shouldn't\nintroduce myself now because it's too\nlate now other people know them better\nthat's all the voices from the outside\nthat's not going to lead you down it may\nmake you successful\nbecause you'll flagellate yourself to\nbecome a very high performer\nbut it won't make you happy\nyeah definitely\nbut even if i recognize that how does\nthat lead to like confidence of\nhappiness\ni have to manifest that from within but\ni don't know like it does\nfeel that right i i mean so i i i know\nit's very confusing but that's the first\nstep\nand it's the same way it's like in the\nsame way that your study abroad\nexperience is something that you're\nproud of like it's confusing\nif you had never studied abroad\nand you had a conversation with yourself\nyou would not be able to convince\nyourself to study abroad\nright yeah so that's where like this is\nthe point david where like i can't\nanswer the next step for you if you ask\nhow does it happen this is where i'd say\nhave awareness and do it and then\nyou tell us\nright\nagain but you said it in like one of\nyour previous videos i watched like your\nyoutube videos and stuff but just like\npeople tell you\nthat if you do xxx xyz or whatever it'll\nhappen but no one tells you when it's\ngonna happen\nso patience\nyeah\nokay\ngood luck to you david\nthank you so much\ntake care everybody\nthanks so much adios doctor\nyep thank you bye\nokay\nso let's\nrecap quickly before we move on\nso\na really common\nreally really common situation\nsometimes we grow up\nwith expectations\nand we try to live up to expectations\nand in our attempts to live up to\nexpectations we actually do a decent job\nbut does it feel like a decent job\nevery time we do something our mind\ntells us you could do more you could do\nbetter\nit's not good enough other people are\ndoing more\nand the more we listen to that voice why\ndo we listen to that voice it's because\nwe want to be confident we want to be\nhappy we want to be successful\nand if our mind tells us like oh like\ndo more do more do more and why do we\nlisten to it to make it shut up\nright so we want to do something where\nour mind is like good job\ninstead of do more\nso like okay i got to do more do more\nand eventually the mind will be quiet\nwhat are we actually reinforcing in that\nsituation\nwe're actually reinforcing the behavior\nof inadequacy\nwe're reinforcing this idea that when i\naccomplish something my mind tells me to\ndo more\nwe're like literally activating those\nneurons of inadequacy over and over and\nover and over again\nand so what do you find in these people\nwhat you find is anytime there's a\nsuccess they take that w and move it to\nthe l\nand we heard today where that like\nliterally where that comes from and so\nwe have a 20 year old who's got an\nexcellent gpa has studied abroad\nexercises\nhas become more social\nwho's like oh my god i'm such a noob\nif that guy's a noob what does that make\nme\nright\nso be careful about what your mind does\nbe careful about using achievement\nas a shortcut to confidence\nbecause paradoxically you can wind up in\nthis situation where the more you\nachieve your mind can always find\nsomeone who's better than you\nright\nso be careful about that and notice when\nyour mind when you do something that's a\nwin\nand you move it to the l as long as you\nkeep doing that you're not going to be\nconfident in yourself because you don't\nlet yourself celebrate the wins you turn\nthem into losses\nthere's all kinds of crap that can come\nup too like but if i start being content\nwith my wins does that mean that i'm\napathetic and i'm not going to achieve\nanymore like it's all kinds of crap that\np your mind will argue it's a\nconversation for another day we'll get a\ncaller on that eventually\nbut just focus on that\nand be careful about trying to live a\nlife where you live up to expectations\ninstead of listening what to what's in\nhere\nbecause it's a fast way to\nunhappiness for sure\nand paradoxically in my experience\ngenerally speaking leads to less success\nover time\nbecause you get burnt out you're it's\nnot you're not it's not it's not in your\nheart when you show up at work like even\nthough it's prestigious you don't\nactually want to be there\nand what's going to happen is there's\nsomeone who actually wants to be there\nand is just as capable as you are and\nthen they're going to outperform you and\nthen that's going to make you feel worse\nyou're going to push yourself even\nfarther to catch up to that person but\nthe more that you push yourself doing\nsomething that you don't enjoy you'll\njust never catch someone who enjoys what\nthey do\nso listen to this\nand then move in a different direction\nwhere there's going to be a bunch of\nother people who have forced themselves\ninto that situation but now you're the\none who's passionate about being there\nand so then you'll rise to the top\nkind of\nbizarre think through a lot of your\nassumptions about stuff like is life a\nrace\nlike what's at the end\nright so i'll leave y'all with one last\nthing before we move on to the next\ncaller when i was\ni realized this later\nso i kind of like screwed around in my\n20s\ninstead of becoming a doctor so i\nstarted med school around 27 28\nfinish med school at 32.\nand so people are like\nyou know i was thinking about that i was\nlike oh my god i'm so behind i'm so\nbehind so i'm so behind i finished med\nschool at the age of 32.\ni had a friend from high school and\nfinished med school at the age of 24.\ni'm eight years older\nthan she was\noh my god\nthen she started residency and worked a\nhundred hours a week before between the\nages of 24 and 28. was between 24 or 28\nlike i went to india spent some time at\nashrams did a lot of gaming\ni had a blast\nand so this is the thing that i that\nreally confuses me about people are\ntrying to get ahead\nare you trying to get ahead so that you\ncan retire at the age of 60 instead of\n65 so you can really enjoy those last 10\nyears of your life\nand sacrificing your 20s\nlike you're trading a year of in your\n20s for a year in your 60s\nis that a good trade\njust think about it for a second\ndon't automatically accept whatever the\nexpectations the world is feeding you\n20 20's are again great time to to waste\ntime honestly\nway better i imagine than wasting your\ntime in your 70s\nso random 955 is asking what if the\nexpectation is not from external but\nmyself\nso this is the question you got to ask\nyourself very good question random 955\nwhere did that internal expectation come\nfrom\nbecause chances are it's not an\nexpectation that was born of your\nintrospection\nand exploration it's a\nit's an expectation that you\ninternalized\nchances are\nright because that's where most of our\nexpectations come from\nyou"
