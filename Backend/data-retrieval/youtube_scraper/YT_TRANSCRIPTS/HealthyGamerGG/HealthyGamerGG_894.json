    "transcript": "but in terms of like whether you're\ngoing to become quote unquote dependent\non a particular psychiatric medication\nthe first question is is it doing what\nit's supposed to do and do you want it\nto continue doing what it's supposed to\ndo my doctor just told me I've become\ndependent on ADHD medication what does\nthat even mean I got off the phone with\nmy doctor just now to get my Adderall\nprescription refilled during the call he\nasked me do you take it every day or as\nneeded so I told him honestly I take it\nevery day because I feel I need it every\nday my ADHD doesn't just vanish but on\nthe odd day that I forget to take it I\ndo just fine it's when I forget for\nmultiple days that it becomes an issue\nand he said it sounds to me like you've\nbecome dependent on stimulates okay so I\ntold him that I actually was planning on\nvisiting a proper psychiatrist my\nprescription was given by a GP and\nseeing about altering my prescription\nmaybe a non-stimulant would work or a\nlower dosage and he replied no\nstimulants work best for ADHD symptoms\nso now I'm very confused as to what he's\ngoing on about to be honest I shouldn't\ntake my medication if I don't need it\nbecause I'll become dependent on\nstimulants but I also need to take\nstimulants because it helps me the most\ntherefore making me dependent it's\nreally confusing logic and I don't know\nhow I feel about about it he didn't\nreally elaborate either no concerns\nabout my blood pressure or anything he\njust said hey you're dependent just\nletting you know your prescription is\nready for you to pick up it's just\nreally confusing and I'm paranoid about\nmy health as it stands so this is really\ntough because especially if you've got\nADHD like anyone who's taking\npsychiatric medication usually has a\nconcern that they're going to become\ndependent on it I've seen this whether\npeople have OCD whether I have major\ndepressive disorder whether they have\nbipolar disorder whether I have ADHD\npeople are afraid of becoming dependent\non medication and then sometimes you'll\nhave clinicians who will be like oh yeah\nyou're dependent on this medication now\nlike a doctor is telling you this and\nthat's kind of terrifying like isn't\ndependency on medication like a bad\nthing and then you're like not really\nsure and sometimes you'll even ask your\ndoctor like okay like is there some way\nto get off the medication and they'll\nsay like no this is the most effective\ntreatment so I disagree with a lot of\nwhat this GP says I'm pretty sure the\nevidence backs me up better than it\nbacks the GP up we'll talk about that\nfor a second but what I'd love to do is\ntalk to you all today about what\nmedication dependence means is it okay\nis it not okay and how people wind up\nbeing dependent on medication and is\nthat scary so the first thing to\nunderstand is that the reason we\nprescribe medication is to sustainably\nhelp people right so I'm going to ask\nyou all a question let's say I have a\nheart transplant and as part of my heart\ntransplant I have to take\nimmunosuppressive medication every\nsingle day why do I have to take\nimmunosuppressive medication so let's do\na quick jaunt into physiology and\ntransplant rejection not what y'all were\nexpecting today but let's explain this\nprinciple so I have a body my body has\nan immune system my immune system learns\nwhat is me and what is not me and then\nwhat the immune system does is starts to\nattack things that are not me right\npretty easy turns out out that I got a\nbum ticker and I need a heart transplant\nso what I'm going to do is I'm going to\nget a heart transplant and in order for\nmy immune system to not destroy the\ntransplanted heart because it comes from\nanother person I have to take\nimmunosuppressive medication now this\nbegs the question am I now dependent on\nimmunosuppressive medication like sort\nof right I'm not I mean like I guess I\ncould stop taking it so this is a key\nthing to understand medication is there\nto accomplish a particular goal that's\nreally the the beginning and the end of\nit right we'll add a little bit of\nnuance in a second but in terms of like\nwhether you're going to become quote\nunquote dependent on a particular\npsychiatric medication the first\nquestion is is it doing what it's\nsupposed to do and do you want it to\ncontinue doing what it's supposed to do\nso when people take an antidepressant\nmedication or anti-anxiety medication\nfor example they're like do I have to be\non this the rest of my life that's\nusually like one of the earliest\nquestions they ask the short answer is\nyou don't have to be and we'll get to\nthat in a second but this is where I'd\nsay the purpose of medication whether\nit's cholesterol medication\nimmunosuppressive medication weight loss\nloss medication or ADHD medication or\ndepression medication the goal is the\nsame it's to try to keep you healthy now\njust like with many of those medications\nif you do particular things as a patient\nyou will no longer need the medication\nto do that to do that job for it so\nlet's say I have type 2 diabetes which\nmeans that due to the number of\nadipocytes or fat cells that I have in\nmy body this is an oversimplification my\nbody has become resistant to insulin and\nso since it's resistant to insulin I can\ntake certain medications that will\nincrease my insulin sensitivity and what\nI can also do is adjust my diet reduce\nmy the level of my adipocytes right\nstart to exercise and do other kinds of\nphysiologic things that make it so that\nI no longer need the medication so am I\ngoing to be dependent on this medication\nfor the rest of my life well that\ndepends on my other behaviors and what\nelse I do so let's talk a little bit\nabout ADHD medication so some people\nwith ADHD require medication on a daily\nbasis generally speaking stimulant\nmedication from most people that are\nprescribed for ADHD I will actually\nrecommend it on a daily basis so the\ngoal with people with ADHD is generally\nspeaking the ADHD kind of screws up\ntheir life right if I go to work every\nday and I need to pay attention every\nday I don't want to be like missing some\ndays and be like okay other days like if\nI show up three hours late to work once\na month because I didn't take my ADHD\nmedication every single day like I'm\ngonna lose my job so what I found is a\nas a psychiatrist working with people\nwith ADHD is you can't afford to have\nADHD 20 of the time like you can't treat\n80 of it you're still going to get\nscrewed if you like your 20 like if your\nADHD is like active 20 of the time there\nare some cases where for example like\npeople don't need it for work what\nthey'll do is they'll like not take\ntheir ADHD medication on the weekends or\nthings like that there are individual\nplans that you can kind of come up with\nbut it's okay to take ADHD medication\nevery single day does that build\ndependence oh before we go on so people\nare asking about weekends so like here's\nthe thing sometimes you need your ADHD\nMedical education on the weekend as well\nwhy because you have to do all the crap\nthat you don't get to do during the week\non the weekend like you got to do\nlaundry you got to pick up groceries you\ngot to drop off packages to return to\nAmazon you gotta you know pick up\nbirthday cards you got to be on time to\nsocial events so it's fine to use my\nADHD medication every single day so does\nthat mean you become dependent well\nthere's two issues to consider with ADHD\nmedication the first is that there may\nbe a physiologic dependence so this is\nneither good nor bad it's not a value\njudgment it just means that if your body\ndevelops a physiologic tolerance and\ndependence on a particular chemical\nsubstance that means if you don't take\nit you're going to have withdrawal\nsymptoms and that could be bad so we\ndevelop different kinds of you know\nsymptoms with ADH I mean different kinds\nof Tolerance with ADHD medications\nthat's not necessarily a bad thing it's\njust something that you need to be aware\nof almost from a safety standpoint so\nthat's where like we can become\ndependent on caffeine is that does that\nmean that morally we're bad people and\nwe're addicts not necessarily it just\nmeans that if you don't have caffeine\nyou may have a headache that's it it's\njust to understand the physiology now\nthe second thing about pendant says do I\nhave to take this medication for the\nrest of my life that's what basically\npeople are asking when they they're\nsaying am I dependent on this medication\nand that's where that depends it depends\nand then you may say well Dr K that's\nweird like how can you say that depends\nwhat does it depend on just like any\nother medical illness or not any but\nmany other medical illnesses how long\nyou need to be on medication the dose of\nthe medication that all depends on what\nelse you are willing to do as a patient\nso let's go back to our diabetes example\nif I start exercising every day if I eat\nlow glycemic index Foods if I start you\nknow doing other particular things like\ndoing yoga or other practices that\nsupport type 2 diabetes and stuff like\nthat then I may not need to be on the\nmedication for the rest of my life right\nso if I can like get to where I need to\ngo without the medication then I won't\nbe dependent on the medication I won't\nneed it so the question is okay what\ndoes that mean for ADHD what's the\nequivalent of eating healthy and\nexercising for ADHD first of all eating\nhealthy and exercising both do help ADHD\nD we go into some of that stuff in the\nguide that we've got hopefully coming\nout in about a month on ADHD so we'll go\nover a lot of different treatment\noptions and stuff like that in more\ndetail the key thing to remember about\nADHD let's talk about science okay what\nis the evidence-based data suggest so\nfirst thing that evidence-based data\nsuggests is that medication and\nPsychotherapy are equally effective\nroughly in terms of effect size what\ndoes that mean that means that if I have\na hundred people with ADHD and I put 50\nof them into Psychotherapy and 50 of\nthem into medication or give them\nmedication the symptom reduction that\nthey get in terms of of ADHD is the same\nokay you actually don't need a pill you\ncan just go to therapy and you will get\nroughly the same effect size now people\nmay ask like how do you get therapy for\nADHD it gets complicated there's also a\nbunch of info on this in the guide but\nbasically a lot of the Psychotherapy for\nADHD is developing structures and\nsystems to account for your ADHD\nessentially putting up guard rails so\nthat your ADHD does not negatively imp\nimpact your life it is literally\nteaching people things like how to\norganize how to prioritize how to set\nalarms how to set reminders we go into a\nlot of detail about how to develop a\ngood organizational system in the guide\nbut it teaches people these kinds of\nskills and so just like any other\npsychiatric illness there are certain\nskills you can learn that will mitigate\nor prevent the illness from harming you\nso a simple example of that is anxiety\nand meditation so if I have an anxiety\ndisorder and I'm feeling very anxious\nand I learn to meditate that can reduce\nthe symptoms of anxiety and reduce my\nquote unquote dependence on anxiety\nmedication ADHD is no different we can\nlearn particular skills that's what\nPsychotherapy teaches us now here's\nwhere the data gets interesting so when\nyou take people who have been given\nPsychotherapy and people who have been\ngiven ADHD medication effect size is\nroughly the same difference is duration\nof benefit after ending treatment here's\nwhere the dependence comes in so when I\ntake ADHD medication if I stop the ADHD\nmedication I'm more more likely to go\nback to square one whereas the cool\nthing about Psychotherapy is if I do\nPsychotherapy for let's say 20 weeks and\nI'm done seeing my psychotherapist I\nwill still get the benefit of that\ntherapy for a year two years maybe even\nthree years or even somewhat quote\nunquote permanently depends on the\nperson but what we know is that the\nbenefits of ADHD medication even last\nafter you've done taking the medication\nso people will still get positive\nbenefits for six months nine months\nafter stopping medication so their\nsymptoms don't return back to normal\nright away necessarily over long you\nknow large populations and longitudinal\nstudies so the duration of psychotherapy\nfar outweighs the duration of medication\nwhich is an important consideration so\nwhen people ask me am I going to be on\nmedication for the rest of my life it's\nlike well that depends on whether you\ndevelop an organizational system that\nwill protect you from your ADHD and if\nyou can learn how to organize if you can\nlearn how to prioritize if you learn all\nthese things chances are you don't need\nmedication so the GP said stimulant\nmedication works the best oh so there's\nsomething really tricky about stimulant\nmedication which is not necessarily that\nwe're works the best so there are\nhead-to-head studies that show that\nnon-stimulant medications and stimulant\nmedications basically work the same in\nterms of the effect size the big\ndifference between stimulant\nnon-stimulant medication is first of all\nstimulants work faster than\nnon-stimulants so there's a medication\ncalled bupropion for example that is\njust about as effective as stimulants\nthe difference is that bupropion takes\nlike a month to really kick in whereas\nstimulants you'll feel the benefit\nwithin 24 48 or 72 hours so stimulants\nare better in terms of acting fast but\nthey don't necessarily work they don't\nreduce your ADHD symptoms more than\nnon-stimulant medications on the whole\nthe second thing about stimulants that\nmakes them feel like they work the best\nand I'm not surprised to hear that from\na GP is that patients think they work\nthe best so there's a very simple\nprinciple in our brain that the more\nrapid the reinforcement the more\nbehavioral reinforcement we see sorry\nthe more rapid the benefit the more\nbehavioral reinforcement we see so for\nexample like stimulants work instantly\nso what happens from a patient\nperspective is patients will tell you\nstimulants work the best for me nothing\nelse works and why do they say that it's\nbecause they notice the benefit\nimmediately whereas non-stimulant\nmedication takes days or weeks to really\nkick in so people don't notice it but if\nyou actually do studies where I take 100\npeople on stimulant medication 100\npeople on non-stimulant medication and I\nmeasure objectively how bad their ADHD\nis let's say three months after they\nstarted medication what I'm going to\nfind is they're both equally effective\nbut the subjective experience of the two\npatients is going to be very very\ndifferent the subjective experience is\ngoing to be any day I miss my medication\nwith ADH with a stimulant people notice\nit right away so there isn't a\ndifference in efficacy what there is is\na difference in sort of noticing or kind\nof like an awareness bias where you can\nreally feel the difference of the\nmedication whereas when you're on a\nslower acting medication you don't quite\nfeel it as much so that's part of the\nreason why people say stimulants quote\nunquote work the best I don't think they\nactually the data suggests that they\ndon't work substantially better than\nnon-stimulants it's just the difference\nis a lot more noticeable and therefore\nis much more likely to reinforce the\nbehavior so a lot of people are\ngenuinely concerned about am I going to\nbe dependent on my ADHD medication the\nanswer is maybe right so what we what I\ntend to see as a clinician is that a lot\nof people will find it very convenient\nto just take a medication every day\nbecause they don't have the time or the\nenergy or wherewithal to learn\norganization prioritization whatever\nespecially if we're talking about like\npeople who are students right so\nsometimes like I'll get someone who's\nlike a sophomore who's coming in during\nmidterms you know you can teach me\norganization and planning but in the two\nmonths it takes me to like figure out\nhow to use a calendar effectively like\nmy midterms are going to be gone and\nI'll have failed them so sometimes\npeople will need medication because it's\nthe easiest thing to do now how\ndependent on it you become not just from\na physiologic perspective but we're\ntalking like long term do you need to\ntake a medication for the rest of your\nlife the answer is that depends it\ndepends on the severity of your Ada HD\nit depends on what other kinds of things\nyou're willing to try so we also know\nfor example that meditation strengthens\nfrontal lobe function and the goal is\ngoing to be over time to like literally\nlike reduce your mind's distractibility\nthrough practices like meditation the\nmore of that kind of stuff you do the\nless dependent you're going to become on\nyour medication and the last thing about\npeople sort of saying stimulants work\nbest well I think they work fastest and\nthey work most noticeably but fastest\nand most noticeable does not technically\nmean best but it oftentimes looks like\nbest because think about it from the GPS\nperspective when I give someone a\nnon-stimulant medication they come back\nin two weeks and they say the medication\nisn't working I'm still having problems\nthen as a general practitioner I switch\nthem from a non-stimulant to a stimulant\nthey call me the next day and they're\nlike this medication has changed my life\nand so then as a GP I don't blame the GP\nfor you know they can't stay experts in\neverything you know I don't blame them\nbut they'll sort of say like oh okay\nlike so it seems like stimulants work\nbetter and then then what what happens\nis the GPS the next time someone comes\nin in with ADHD I just start them on the\nstimulant and then I don't ever hear\nfrom them again except when it's time\nfor refill ask them how's the medication\nworking they say it's working great so\nthese kinds of biases not really the\ngp's fault in a sense right because they\ncan there's very natural ways why GPS\nwill get to that conclusion last thing\nthat I I kind of want to say is that if\nyour doctor uses terms with you that you\ndon't understand or terrify you like to\nsay like oh yeah you're dependent on\nthis by the way that may mean something\ndifferent from to them than it does to\nyou and if your doctor says things that\nscare you ask them to explain themselves\nbe like what do you mean by that what\ndoes that mean what are the implications\nof being dependent on ADHD medication is\nthis a bad thing like what do I do about\nit second thing is by all means get a\nsecond opinion if a doctor is not\ntalking to you enough if they're not\nexplaining things enough then by all\nmeans get a second opinion explain to\nthem that you need more explanation and\nalso like by all means go see a\nspecialist so someone's asking how does\none's life of lie 2915 is asking how\ndoes one's life change if they get\ndiagnosed with the ADHD chances are\ntheir life gets substantially better so\nthat's kind of a weird thing to say\nbecause remember getting diagnosed with\nADHD or not getting diagnosed like you\nhave the ADHD whether it's diagnosed or\nnot it's affecting you whether you have\nthe ADHD or I mean whether you get have\nthe diagnosis or not you've got ADHD\neither way it's impairing your function\nwhether you have a diagnosis or don't\nhave a diagnosis the only thing that the\ndiagnosis hopefully the main thing that\nthe diagnosis does is gives you the\nopportunity to do something about it\nengage in treatment now what we do know\nis that living a life of untreated ADHD\nleads to all kinds of problems we've\nprobably got a lecture that we're going\nto share with you all in about a week or\ntwo about this about the ADHD Iceberg\nbut for example we know that something\nlike 50 to 70 percent of people with\nADHD let me think about this the\nstatistic that sounds High even to me I\nthink I may be misquoting this but if\nyou look at the comorbidity of ADHD and\ndepression three three to five percent\nof people with depression will grow up\nto later be diagnosed with ADHD but of\nthe people who have both 50 to 70\npercent of people with ADHD will be will\nalso have depression later in life for\nthat comorbid population so what does\nthat mean does that mean that if you've\ngot ADHD you have a 50 chance of getting\ndepression no there's four people who\nhave both if you take that subset of\npeople who already have both what you\nsee is that there is a causal\nrelationship ADHD leading to depression\nand it doesn't go the other way it's not\njust correlated one causes the other and\nwhy is that it's because growing up with\nADHD especially untreated ADHD shapes\nyour life to be depressed later so I'll\ngive you a simple example of this very\nfascinating study that found that kids\nwith ADHD are less likely to be invited\nto birthday parties than neurotypical\nkids think about that for a second so if\nI'm an ADHD kid why does it mean I'm\ngoing to be less less likely to be\ninvited it's because I don't pay\nattention so all the other kids are\ntalking about Pokemon cards and I start\nrandomly talking about something that's\ncompletely unrelated and the kids all\nlook at me like I'm weird because I'm\nhighly distractible I can't keep Pace\nwith the conversation I also don't pay\nattention when they're talking to me\nright so over time like those kids\naren't going to want to invite me to\ntheir their birthday party and then over\ntime if I stop getting invited to\nbirthday parties what does that mean for\nthe development of my social skills I\ndon't get opportunities to like develop\nmy social skills because I get invited\nless can't level up if you don't Zone in\nto where the fighting is right like you\ncan't get any XP if you're not invited\nto the game and so over time kids with\nADHD experience more social isolation\nand loneliness Rusty social skills which\nin turn makes it harder for them to get\npromoted at work because a lot of\ngetting promoted at work has to do with\nsocial skills and so what we tend to see\nwith kids with ADHD especially when it's\nundiagnosed and untreated is that living\na life of undiagnosed ADHD predisposes\nyou to depression through features like\nunder performance of academic\nunderperforming in an academic sense so\nit's under achievement academically for\nkids with ADHD there's lack of social\nopportunities which leads to isolation\nand loneliness this there are all these\ndifferent factors where you can almost\nthis is what we do in the lecture that\nthere's a whole lecture about this and\nDr K's guide to ADHD and doing stuff\nwhere you can map it out how growing up\nwith ADHD leads to particular factors\nwhich later in life lead to depression\nbecause what ADHD does is all of these\nfactors over here are risk factors for\ndepression later in life so hopefully\ngetting diagnosed changes your life for\nthe better scalicious is saying I often\nhear people say that ADHD and other\ndiagnosis disorders are being over\ndiagnosed do you think that this is true\nso I've said this before I'll say it\nagain I think ADHD is both the most over\ndiagnosed and at the same time the most\nunder diagnosed psychiatric illness so\nyou may ask a question wait how can\nsomething be over diagnosed and\nunder-diagnosed what I mean by that is I\nthink that ADHD is oftentimes missed in\npeople who have it so this is why we're\nseeing a lot more adult ADHD diagnosis\nwhy is that it's because the diagnosis\nwas missed when they were kids why was\nit missed when they were kids because\nthe kids were super smart and built up\ncompensatory mechanisms that did not\nthat allowed them to hide the ADHD so\nwhen you see a smart kid with ADHD\noftentimes that kid won't get diagnosed\nbecause even though they can't pay\nattention they can use brute force\nreasoning to figure out what is going on\nso I'll give you all just a classic\nexample so kid isn't paying attention in\nmath class I'm my mind is wandering I\ncan't pay attention teacher says my name\ntwice and then suddenly I snap back to\nit I can see the whole classroom is\nlooking at me teacher is looking at me\nand I can see that people are upset\nusing my ADHD brain which can quickly\ninterpret information I glance around\nthe classroom I see teachers holding\nchalk I see there are four problems on\nthe chalkboard three of them have\nanswers I look at the fourth problem\nthat doesn't have an answer I calculate\nvery quickly because I have a high IQ I\nsay the answer teacher looks at me with\nsuspicion because they were sure I\nwasn't paying attention but I came up\nwith the answer they write the answer\nand then they move on kids with ADHD\ndevelop compensatory mechanisms leads to\nunder diagnosis of ADHD at the same time\npeople over diagnose ADHD parent parents\nare frustrated with their kids kids\ndon't listen all they ever want to do is\nwatch the iPad parents never train\nattention in their kids anytime the kid\nis upset anytime the kid is distracted\nanytime my nanny doesn't show up I'm\nguilty of this as well take the iPad\nturn on the screen shatters the kids\nattentional span incl increases\nemotional dysregulation kid has problems\nat school because I never sit down and\nread with them at home parents are like\nkid doesn't listen because I don't have\nhealthy boundaries at home kid gets\ndiagnosed with ADHD so it's both over\ndiagnosed and under diagnosed sounds\nlike me oh yeah you betcha\nforeign"
