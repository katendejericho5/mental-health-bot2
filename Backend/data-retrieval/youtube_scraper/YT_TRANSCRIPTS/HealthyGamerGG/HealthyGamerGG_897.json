    "transcript": "it's not just hey i think you need to do\nthis\nso you should start and it's all on you\nit's when partners accept responsibility\nfor each other and sort of work together\ntowards making changes that people end\nup being the best so let's talk a little\nbit about love so vox recently had an\narticle called what science still can't\nexplain about love and the article's\npretty good it it talks a little bit\nabout different perspectives on love and\nthey sort of interviewed dating coaches\nmatchmakers psychologists and tried to\nget a sense of like why is love why\nhaven't we figured this out yet right so\nlike love like we've got a bunch of\nscience we understand so much about\nrelationships and you know what's going\non here so they make a couple of major\nconclusions the first is that our\npreferences can't always predict\nattraction so that's one of the\nhypotheses that they state and i'd say i\nkind of agree with this that a lot of\ntimes we have preferences and we don't\nreally just because someone meets our\npreferences or checks our boxes doesn't\nnecessarily mean that we'll be attracted\nto them and what is far more woeful\nis that sometimes we are actually very\nattracted to people who don't meet our\npreferences which causes so many\nproblems the second thing that they sort\nof dig into is that so as as they're\nsort of talking a little bit about okay\nwhy can't we figure out love they come\nup with a couple of theories so the\nfirst theory is that scientists can\ncrack the code if they look hard enough\nso this is a theory that basically\nposits as long as we do enough research\nand we crunch enough numbers we will\neventually figure out what it takes to\nfall in love we'll figure out the the\nformula or equation like you know the\nthe equation for gravity\nf equals gmm over r squared right like\nwe can figure out love if we just do\nenough research that's one perspective\nanother perspective is and this is\nsomething that i personally agree with\nis that love is actually chaotic by\nnature so as i mentioned earlier i've\nbeen reading a lot of papers about\nneuroscience of love and neuroscience of\nrelationships and things like that and\nthere are actually a lot of studies that\nshow that love is actually like a\nchaotic and dysregulated state in the\nbrain so we know that from fmri studies\nwhich are studies of blood flow to the\nbrain that when someone is in love they\nthey start to inhibit all kinds of like\nuseful circuitry in the brain so our\nrisk assessment circuitry gets inhibited\nwhen we're in love our executive\nfunction kind of gets messed up our\nability to plan kind of gets messed up\nthere are all kinds of amplifications of\nparticular emotional circuits and even\nsuppression of other emotional circuits\nlike suppressing negative emotions while\nwe're in the state of love so there's\nactually evidence that shows that love\nat least in the brain is sort of like a\npro chaotic pro bad decision not\nconsidering risk sort of state like it\nliterally we see reduced blood flow to\nsome of our risk assessment parts of the\nbrain and there are even if you look at\nsome of the studies they'll even sort of\nposit evolutionary hypotheses for this\nis that there's a certain amount of\nstupidness that you have to induce that\nis\nsort of tips things towards procreation\nright so creating babies is like a huge\nenergy investment can cost people a lot\nand so what we want to do is like our\nbrain sort of handicaps us and sort of\nlike doesn't let us really think about\nthe consequences which may actually be a\ntrait that's been selected for\nevolutionarily over the course of\nmillions of years\nokay that's theory number two some\nevidence of this and the last thing that\nthey talk a little bit about is which\ntheory do matchmakers and relationship\ncoaches kind of believe in and so they\ntalk a little bit about you know how\nmatchmakers and relationship coaches\nsort of function and this is sort of\nwhat i'd like to share with you all a\nlittle bit so as we kind of i'd like to\njust offer my perspective on this and\nwhat i'd love to do is share with y'all\nalmost like a story of how i came to\nbelieve what i did about love and then\nalso share with y'all i think one of the\none of the biggest mistakes that people\nmake nowadays when approaching\nrelationships so this kind of starts out\nwith my job as a psychiatrist so one of\nthe interesting things is that i get to\nsee the inside of a lot of relationships\nnow people may think oh as a\npsychiatrist if you're doing couples\ncounseling doesn't mean that doesn't\nthat mean that there's a selection bias\nand you get to see the inside of the\nworst relationships right because in\ncouples counseling it's only like people\nwho have problems that are going to see\na psychiatrist whereas actually i see a\nlot of relationships that are not a part\nof couples counseling so just as an\nexample if i have a patient but there's\nnothing wrong with their marriage let's\nsay i'm treating them for adhd at some\npoint i will ask about their marriage\nright is their marriage something that\nis supportive in terms of like you know\nmental health standpoint oftentimes i'll\nmeet their spouse right because we'll\nhave sort of like a kind of meet and\ngreet and sort of make sure that we're\nall on the same page see if the spouse\nhas any concerns if there's any kind of\nplans that we have to develop so\noftentimes i see the inside of a lot of\nreally healthy relationships and the\nfirst thing that i noticed i made an\nobservation when i was back in residency\ni noticed something very strange which\nis that the healthiest relationships\nalmost always have at least one red flag\ni was kind of surprised by this so i was\nmeeting people that were like in their\n40s and their 50s and like they had\nreally strong healthy relationships when\ni'd asked them like oh you know when did\nyou meet what were things like you know\nearly on in your relationship there was\nalmost always like one red flag right so\none example is you know i had one\npatient who i'm gonna sort of make these\nchimerical for those of you that don't\nknow so i'm gonna change around gender\nand age and ethnicity and stuff so that\npeople can't be identified but i had one\npatient who you know decided to marry\nsomeone who was like unemployed and a\nfew years older than they were and so\nthis was a a patient who was 18 years\nold decided to marry a dude six years\nolder who was like unemployed at the\ntime and like that seems like a terrible\nidea right you're an 18 year old\nmarrying a 24 year old is a terrible\nidea furthermore 24 year old is like\nkind of unemployed not really going\nanywhere anyway they're happily married\nnow doing very very well in terms of\ncareers and family and stuff like that\nso it's like kind of like a red flag and\nthe more that i i saw the insider\nrelationships the more that i i saw that\nlike okay like all of these\nrelationships ended up really good but\nit sounds like they actually had\nrelatively rocky starts and so i was\nreally kind of curious about that and i\nwas starting to think okay like how does\nthis work like what's going on here so i\nmade that observation but wasn't really\nsure for what it's worth i kind of think\nthat my relationship also sort of had\nlike in a sense a red flag or yellow\nflag in the sense that my wife was\ndating someone who told her explicitly\nthat they were gonna become a monk and\nbe celibate and forsake the world right\nwhich like seems kind of like red flag\nterritory to me like why would you date\nsomeone like that anyway she was wiser\nand understood that i was you know\ndidn't understand what i was talking\nabout but my point is that on paper like\nthat's sort of like a red flag right so\nthen i i i started getting curious about\nthis and so i started asking people from\nmy culture so i'm indian and in in our\nculture we have a lot of arranged\nmarriage or at least used to there's\nstill a lot of arranged marriage i\nstarted asking people a little bit about\nokay so like how does this y'all have\nbeen married for 30 years like how does\nthat work like you know what was the\narranged marriage like and then i\nthought they shared with me something\nthat was really really interesting which\nis that when they had an arranged\nmarriage happiness was not guaranteed\nright so when you get married in an\narranged marriage you're not sure that\nyou're going to be happy you kind of get\nmarried for a number of different causes\na number of different reasons that will\nhopefully lead to a successful and\nharmonious life but happiness in and of\nitself or even love for that matter is\nnot guaranteed and so the interesting\nthing that that i sort of discovered\ntalking to a lot of people who had been\nin arranged marriages is that they had\nto work for it so like you started this\nrelationship with both people sort of\nunder the impression that depending on\nwhat we put into the relationship is\nwhat we're going to get out so whether\nwe're happy or not sort of depends on a\ncertain amount of my flexibility a\ncertain amount of like you know how much\ni try and it also depends on the other\nperson being flexible and trying and\nhopefully if the two of us work together\nwe can end up at least happy and\nhopefully in love and so i thought that\nwas that kind of a really really\ninteresting perspective and so i think\nthat's sort of when i sort of talked to\nwhen i went back to my you know my my\npatients and stuff who had been\nin love marriages with red flags i sort\nof started to ask them a little bit\nabout this kind of principle as well and\nwhat i actually found is that in in\nevery one of those cases there are red\nflags which had to be actively overcome\nby both parties right so people were\nsort of in a sense committed to the\nrelationship stupidly so right because\nthere's that risk assessment part of\nyour brain that's not getting as much\nblood right so you're taking risks but\nthat both people were sort of in a sense\ncommitted to the relationship and they\nrecognized that like finding happiness\nor harmony in the relationship was like\na co-op game and so i think this is the\nbig thing that we've lost we've lost\nsort of this idea that a relationship's\nhappiness\nis\nnot uh so what we think right now is\nthat their happiness in a relationship\nis sort of determined by the other\nperson and we sort of see this right so\nif i the third thing that i want to\nshare with you all is i talked to some\npeople who were like on dating apps\nright so\nespecially more recently past three\nyears four years a lot of my patients\nare using dating app and i sort of\ntalked to them a little bit about okay\nlike what's the psychology of like you\nknow help me understand why you're using\na dating app what are you looking for\nand here's the way that they explain it\nto me so i want to be in a long-term\nrelationship a long-term relationship\nlet's say 30 years 40 years i want to\nget married i don't have kids i want to\ngo roll together all that good stuff\nhave someone in my corner and so i kind\nof asked them okay so what determines\nwhether you're in a long-term\nrelationship or not and they\nessentially get to well whether i'm\nhappy or not right because if i'm\nunhappy in a relationship i'm going to\nleave and if i'm happy in a relationship\ni'm going to stay and so the happier i\nam in the relationship the more likely\ni am to stay in a relationship for 30\nyears and so their goal they were sort\nof equating happiness in a relationship\nwith like long-term commitment makes\nsense so then the interesting thing is\nthat i'd ask them okay so like what\ndetermines whether you're happy in a\nrelationship and that's when they'd sort\nof essentially say well it depends on\nwhether i get what i want and this is\nwhere the selectivity comes in so\nessentially what's happening is you have\npeople sort of like thinking okay if i\nget a b c d and e if i check these five\nboxes or if my partner checks these five\nboxes then i will be happy in a\nrelationship if i'm happy in a\nrelationship then the relationship will\nlast and that's how i'm going to find a\nlong-term relationship and so i realize\nthat the major mistake that people seem\nto be making now is that they think that\nhappiness in a relationship is something\nthat is found instead of something that\nis built so if i'm unhappy in the\nrelationship and this is what we sort of\nsee with online dating is that like okay\nif this per if i'm unhappy with this\nperson instead of working on that\nrelationship and trying to get that\nperson to change or even shockingly\nchange myself what i'm going to do is\njust look for someone who checks all the\nboxes so since i have you know a\nthousand different people that i can\nexamine over here and see if any of\nthose are better fits i'm not going to\ninvest in working on this relationship\nworking on myself or trying to encourage\nthis other person to grow and change and\nso this is what what is is crazy is that\nwhen i talk to people who are in\nsuccessful relationships a huge part of\nthat is actually like them working on\nthemselves so it's like learning to be\nflexible when you don't get what you\nwant right so can i be happy in spite of\ngetting what i want and this is where we\ncan pull in a bunch of like excellent\ntheory from sort of eastern religions so\nif we look at like the karmic religions\nlike hinduism buddhism the religions\nthat gave us meditation yoga tai chi\nthese kinds of things and what they\nbasically taught us is that a lot of our\nunhappiness has to do with what's in\nhere and actually what we sort of find\nis that the more that you get what you\nwant sometimes the more unhappy you\nbecome so i felt this you know very\nstrongly when i was playing video games\nall day because what did i want i didn't\nwant to go to class i wanted to play\nvideo games all day long and so that's\nwhat i did in the next day i played more\nvideo games because i didn't want to go\nto a class i didn't want to fail the\nclass can't fail the class if you don't\nshow up to the final\ni mean you can fail class i guess you\ncan't fail the final you can fail the\nfinal as well but it happens somewhere\nover there you get a you get a a letter\ngrade in the mail on a piece of paper\nthat you don't even have to open right\nlike so a big part of what i see in\nrelationships now is that everyone is\nlooking for happiness instead of\nbuilding it instead of investing it\ninstead of being flexible and so then\nwhat you sort of i want you all to think\nabout this if someone is not willing to\nbe flexible and compromise and find\nhappiness\nin spite of them not getting what they\nwant\nwhat situation is that create that\ncreates i'm going to date this person\nfor a couple weeks oh i'm unhappy let me\nfind someone else i find someone else\ni'm a little happier for a little while\nand then i start to become unhappy let\nme find someone else let me find someone\nelse let me find someone else and so you\nget people who are on dating apps for a\nvery very long time and that's because\nthey keep on looking for happiness from\ntheir partners instead of doing any kind\nof internal work it's like the complete\nopposite of what we see in an arranged\nmarriage and so this is kind of the big\nthing that i think that we need to\nreally understand is that if you want to\nbe happy in a relationship if you want\nto be successful in a relationship a lot\nof that doesn't have to do with checking\nboxes and we actually use checking boxes\nas proxies of our own happiness but if\nwe look at theories of like eastern uh\nlike eastern wisdom or eastern\npsychology what they say is that a lot\nof our happiness doesn't actually have\nto do with fulfilling our desires in\nfact they say the opposite and the more\nthat you focus on fulfilling your\ndesires like the worse off you're gonna\nbe so this is what i think what we're\nmissing is that if you're sort of dating\nfor you to think a little bit about if\nyou're unhappy in a relationship how\nmuch of this does my partner need to\nchange or how much of this do i need to\nfind the perfect partner and how much of\nthis is like do i need to learn how to\nbe happy in spite of not getting what i\nwant and what i tend to find in all of\nthe successful relationships whether\nthey're loved love marriages or arranged\nmarriages is that it's people who are\nwilling to be somewhat flexible with\nwhat they want and what they're willing\nto get and their what they're willing to\nsacrifice or not sacrifice it's that\nkind of flexibility that really is a\ngood prognostic factor success in\nrelationships and i think even when you\nlook at all the science on that\neveryone's sort of looking at\nrelationship factors and people like\nokay did you get what you want did you\nnot get what you want you know if you\nget what you want how does that\ncorrelate with success in a relationship\nand all the research says it doesn't\ncorrelate with success in relationship\nor i mean that's an oversimplification\nbut a lot of it is not very promising\nthat way right that's why we haven't\nfigured it out yet because when we ask\npeople what they want it doesn't seem to\ncorrelate very well but what people\ndon't ask or there is relation there is\nrelationship uh research on this and\nthis is what's really interesting is\nwhen people start to ask not so much\nabout the other person but about you and\nyour ability to compromise your ability\nto be flexible your ability to like\nreally think about what you want and are\nyou able to prioritize your partner's\nhappiness and we tend to see is it's in\nsituations like this where partners are\nwilling to prioritize these each other's\nhappiness as opposed to checking all the\nboxes for their hypothetical perfect\nrelationship those are the ones that\nlead to good relationship outcomes so a\nlot of what we're missing in\nrelationships is actually a lack of\nawareness about our own flexibility and\nhow much of my happiness am i willing to\nwork on how much am i willing to let go\nhow much am i willing to set boundaries\nhow much am i willing to support my\npartner in making healthy changes it's\nnot just hey i think you need to do this\nso you should start and it's all on you\nit's when partners accept responsibility\nfor each other and sort of work together\ntowards making changes that people end\nup being the best so that's kind of a\nquick summary on relationships and kind\nof my perspective i think that i've had\nthe privilege of looking at a lot of\ndifferent relationship perspectives both\nfrom sort of like hard science research\nincluding brain scans doing therapy with\npeople who are in healthy and unhealthy\nrelationships and even culturally like\nlooking at people who are in arranged\nmarriages versus love marriages and what\ni've sort of found is that there's one\nthing that we're really missing\nespecially when it comes to online\ndating and that's this idea that like\nwhether i'm happy in a relationship or\nnot does not just depend on whether my\npartner checks the boxes it depends on\nmy own flexibility and my own\nwillingness to be happy in spite of not\ngetting what i want and the more that we\nmove towards online dating and and over\nabundance of choice the more we have\nthis idea that okay if i find the\nperfect person if they check all the\nboxes then i will be happy and we assume\nthat getting what we want is what makes\nus happy whereas i'm not so sure that\nthat's the case for the record i'm not\nsaying that arranged marriage is\nsuperior to love marriage or that love\nmarriage is superior to arranged\nmarriage or that there aren't arranged\nmarriages that end very very terribly\nwhat i'm talking about is for all kinds\nof long-term relationships that i've\nseen\nwhat floats to the surface in terms of\ndetermining whether that relationship is\nsuccessful or not i think the biggest\nthing that we tend to miss is that we\nthink that the success of our\nrelationships depend on the other person\nbut a lot of the success of our\nrelationships depend on us and how much\nwe're willing to grow how much we're\nwilling to sacrifice how much we're\nwilling to put our partner ahead of\nourselves and the healthiest\nrelationships the longest lasting\nrelationships are the ones where i\nprioritize my partner and my prior my\npartner prioritizes me yeah as focus is\nsaying it be flexible to succeed\nquestions\ngreat question so svn potatoes say what\nif you feel like you will never be good\nenough so you don't get into a\nrelationship that's exactly what i'm\nsaying is the problem is that if we\nthink about it what like good enough is\nthat checkbox system right so if we\nassume\nokay so like how do i end up in a\nsuccessful relationship well people are\nlooking for so if i'm someone out there\npeople are looking for someone who\nchecks all the boxes and so if i find\nsomeone who checks all the boxes then i\nwill be happy in a relationship and the\nrelationship will be successful now\nlet's put ourselves in the shoes of\nsomeone who is trying to check the boxes\nright so i want to be all these things\nso i can be successful in a relationship\nso that people will pick me my whole\npoint is that people who are successful\nin relationships don't necessarily have\nto check the boxes when we start out\nthat becoming a good partner is not\nsomething that it's not like you're a\nfinished product it's not like you get\nmade in the factory and then shipped out\nto be purchased as the perfect partner\nright and so like if you're like oh i'm\nnot great like i don't have a job i\ndon't you know like maybe i'm short like\nmaybe i'm not as physically attractive\nmaybe i'm a little bit out of shape\nmaybe i have an addiction that i'm\ndealing with or some kind of depression\nor maybe like you know there's something\nabout me that's off so i'm not a perfect\nproduct this is the whole thing is that\nin dating we think about people as\nfinished products right this is i'm\ngonna select this person to be my mate\nand they have to check all the boxes we\nlike it's like going into a store and\npicking up a product that has been you\nknow play tested and calibrated and\nrefined but that's not what human\nrelationships are i don't think you need\nto be perfect to start a relationship in\nfact i think it's that kind of thinking\nthat screws people on both sides because\ni'm expecting perfection from my partner\nyou're supposed to be i'm looking for\nsomeone who's emotionally available\nfinancially stable clean has their own\nhouse drives their own car is\nfinancially independent we already said\nthat one\nonce is good looking knows how to groom\nthemselves is self-sufficient can do\ntheir laundry can cook doesn't use any\ndrugs or uses the same level of drugs\nthat i do but doesn't use anymore is\nreligious is not religious so we we like\nwe're expecting perfection from our\npartners and on the flip side we have\npeople who are like i'm not perfect yet\nwhat do i do you date anyway you\nacknowledge that like when i started\ndating my girlfriend like i had no job\nno money no net worth shitty gpa was\nplanning on becoming a monk like i had\nlike five red flags all i had going for\nme was a good set of hair and so like\nthat's my point is that when you care\nabout someone and when your brain gets\nmuddy up here you start disinhibiting\ncertain parts of your brain you start\ninhibiting the more calculating parts\nlike and then you work towards it right\nyou say okay so like you're unemployed\nand you know you've got a crappy gpa so\nlike let me help you try to build your\nlife and so if your life isn't entirely\ntogether you know you work towards it\ni make one comment about hair and chat\ngoes wild okay someone's asking what do\nyou think about getting back together\nwith your ex so here's what i'd say not\nknowing anything about the situation\nlet's talk about exes for a second you\nshould only get back together with your\nex if both of you are committed to\nworking on the problems that made you\nexes it's not about them having changed\nor you having changed both you all have\nto be committed to fix whatever crap\ncaused you all to break up in the first\nplace and if people are committed to\nthat change then it's not a bad idea\nknowing nothing else about the situation\nbut if people aren't committed to that\nchange then you're in trouble ami the\npleb or amy the pleb is saying what if\nyou feel like you don't have the\ncapacity to help the other party then i\ndon't think you're ready for a\nrelationship right so the thing about a\nrelationship is that remember that it's\nit's on equal footings let's talk about\nanother relationship that is\nproblematic so sometimes we have a\nrelationship between a broken person and\na whole person one person who's got\ntheir crap together another person who\ndoesn't have their crap together so\nthese relationships can start out very\nlopsided right because one person is\ndoing the caring of and one person is\nbeing cared for and that can be okay for\nsome amount of time so like those i've\nseen those relationships actually work\nout but the goal there is that you know\nboth people have to be invested in\ntrying to take care of each other and\ntrying to support each other and trying\nto help each other grow but you may be\nasking but if i'm the busted one how do\ni help my partner grow if they have all\ntheir crap together well you help your\npartner grow and you support them by\ninvesting heavily in yourself so that\nthey don't have to carry all the time\nright like it's in recognizing that okay\nthe thing that i can do the most for my\npartner right now isn't taking care of\nmyself and getting myself into such a\nplace where they don't have to take care\nof me where i can start taking care of\nthem and that's the whole point behind a\nrelationship is that you all share the\nload and so if you're not carrying your\nyour part the best thing you can do to\nhelp your care or your partner is to\nstart carrying your fair share and\nreally focus on yourself and i think\nthat's that works out great now the this\nperson said i recognize i actually kind\nof reverse what i was saying but they\nwere sort of saying like what if i can't\ntake care of someone so i would be super\ncareful because if you're not in that\nsituation where you really can't take\ncare of yourself you could be setting\nyourself up for one of the many other\nlopsided situations that don't end well\nso we shared the side that goes well but\nhere's what can happen a lot of time one\nthing that happens is that the\nrelationship becomes dependent where one\nperson is always doing the lifting and\none person is always doing the receiving\nthen we feel love right and then we feel\nguilt because we're not kind of but like\nthere's love involved and maybe there's\neven like intimacy involved and stuff\nlike that so things get tangled and then\nlike we then we get into complacency\nof dependence which is very very common\nmy partner never does the laundry never\ndoes the sheets never cleans the house\nand i just do everything for them or my\npartner doesn't get a job is home all\nday is depressed you know and i support\nthem we can fall into this like\ndependency relationship very very\nrapidly and then sometimes why don't\npeople leave those relationships well\nit's because i don't know if you'll get\nthis but people are afraid of being\nalone right sometimes we're in a\nrelationship with someone who's very\ndependent on us and we think that like\nif we don't want to give up on love we\ndon't want to be a bad person we don't\nwant to abandon them and by the way if\nwe abandon them am i ever going to find\nanyone so there are all kinds of\nproblems that end up with when we've got\nthis kind of like imbalanced\nrelationship sometimes we can also\ndevelop power dynamics that's another\nreason why this these relationships can\ngo poorly right because if i'm making\nthe money and you're not making the\nmoney then it's my way or the highway i\nget to make all the decisions and that\ncan be sort of toxic in a relationship\nyou know if you're not ready to help\nsomeone else in a relationship i think\nprobably the best answer is to focus on\nyourself first and have the capacity to\ngive because that's what a successful\nrelationship requires have the capacity\nto give but you don't have to be perfect\nyou don't have to like check all the\nboxes ahead of time that's my whole\npoint is if you think about you know who\nis gonna end up in a more successful\nlong-term relationship so let's say\nscenario number one i check all the\nboxes therefore someone agrees to date\nme because i check all the boxes ahead\nof time and then what happens is like\nwhat happens if i uncheck a box in the\nfuture and then that person is unhappy\nlet's say that they want someone who's\ngot a nice set of hair and then i start\nto go bald and now they're unhappy what\nwas their solution to happiness their\nsolution to happiness was find the\nperfect partner and as long as a partner\nis perfect then i will be happy and if\npartners starts to lose hair well now\ni'm unhappy and what's my solution is\nfind the perfect partner so what do we\ndo\ndivorce versus someone who's more\nflexible with their happiness my\nsolution is i'm going to find someone\nthat i really love even if they're not\nperfect and we're going to work together\ntowards building a relationship that's\nhealthy and we're going to work together\ntowards building a life that's good\nthat's my point is that like we just\nassume that other people checking boxes\nof our criteria is going to lead to a\nhealthy relationship and that's like\nthat's not a good assumption melon\nbiscuit is saying there's no such thing\nas the perfect partner i completely\nagree with you but just because there\nain't no such thing as a perfect partner\ndoesn't mean that people won't date you\nbecause you're not perfect and doesn't\nmean that they're gonna stop looking for\nperfect\nhalf the problem right now is that we've\ngot a ton of people out there who are\nlooking for the perfect partner who\ndoesn't exist but they have no problem\njudging people for not being perfect and\nthey're gonna keep looking for it and so\nwhat you see is people who are getting\nolder and older and older on dating apps\nwho are getting more and more and more\nselective right so it's like i date one\nperson and these are my four criteria\nand by the way i didn't realize that my\npartner was a gamer so next time around\nno gamers so now i add a fifth criteria\nto the list no gamers and then i find\nsomeone right because there's 10 000\npeople out there i find the one who\nchecks all four of the criterion isn't a\ngamer turns out they have an alcohol\nproblem okay so like no alcoholics next\ntime around and so the list keeps\ngrowing and growing and growing and\ngrowing the more failed relationships\nthat i have the more i expect from other\npeople\nwhere's the problems in here\nyou"
