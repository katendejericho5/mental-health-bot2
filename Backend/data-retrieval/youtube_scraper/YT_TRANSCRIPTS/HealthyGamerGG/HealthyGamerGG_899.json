    "transcript": "so this is the hard thing for parents is\nthat as you start sharing responsibility\noutcomes can get worse for your kid in\nthe short term if they're actually\nresponsible you gotta let them stumble\nand parents don't want to do that so\nlet's take a look at this post from a\nparent who's\nstruggling to fix their son's gaming\naddiction because apparently their son\nis gonna have to repeat the ninth grade\nso heart goes out to them this is a\ncommon struggle that parents deal with\nso let's try to understand what's going\non here my son is 15 years old and he is\ndiagnosed with adhd and autism he spends\na lot of his time playing world of\nwarcraft which his dad also plays and\npays for the game i put a strict\nschedule for him daily which includes\nhomework first before screen time and\ngaming and gaming is restricted to two\nhours per day until 8 pm when dinner is\nready and after which he showers brushes\nhis teeth and goes to bed at 9 30.\nquestion number one how much would you\nlike to have this person as a mother if\nyou were a gamer question number two for\nthose of you that are like oh my god\nthis sounds awful how many of you don't\nwant this kind of person as a mother\nbut wish\nyour parents actually set firmer limits\non you so that you are forced to develop\ngood study hobbits habits right so we\ndon't want this kind of person as a\nmother and yet oftentimes as gamers we\nblame our parents for not being stricter\non us for not giving us study hobbits\nchat trying to get a 15 year old to\nshower and brush his teeth is a daily\nstruggle i didn't think much of it until\ni've received complaints from his\nteachers about him not engaging with the\nclass\nmisbehaving not doing his schoolwork etc\ni also received a call from the school\nstating that his grades are so bad that\nhe's going to stay in the ninth grade\nnext year i immediately told my husband\nto cancel the subscription and uninstall\nall of the games on the family computer\ni set it up so that he cannot install\nanything on it without my password i've\nnot seen the subscription on our joint\naccount question number two chat how\neffective do you think this is going to\nbe mom uninstall all the games cancel\nall the subscriptions fix the problem\ngonna fix my son's gaming addiction\nright i did not realize until later that\nhe circumvented the boundaries i placed\non him by lying and saying he has no\nhomework so he can get can game his\nteachers mention via email that he had\nhomework he snuck our old laptop in his\nroom to play in the middle of the night\npast bedtime and he has been cutting\nschool to play the game in the library i\nreceived a phone call later\nthat day telling me he hasn't been in\nschool he was a grounded immediately and\ni took away his switch iphone and remove\nthe keyboard and mouse for two weeks and\nhe is expected to be home right after\nschool he usually gets home around three\nthat the punishment will be extended for\nanother two weeks if he's not back by 3\n30. mom cracking the whip oh my god he\nhas circumvented my rules let me impose\nfurther rules and more strict for the\nmost part he complied after realizing\nthat he's going to repeat the ninth\ngrade the confiscation will be\nindefinite\nwho wants this as a mom i enrolled him\nin summer school and told him that he\nwill get his stuff back if he passes\nsummer school and have a minimum grade\nof c on all of his classes consistently\nnext year ever since i confiscated his\ngames in the computer he has been\nsnapping at me and giving me and his\nfather a bad attitude when i tell him to\ndo chores he barely finished them and\ndoes it in the most passive-aggressive\nmanner and half-assed he's been getting\ninto periodic temper tantrums and\nbreaking things like a two-year-old he's\nbecome extremely disobedient the last\nstraw was when i found a 60-day\nsubscription card in his room which he\nused his allowance to pay for behind my\nback and sneaking into the library to\nplay the game and sneaking a laptop i've\nalready hid into his bedroom to play so\nmuch hiding mom hid the laptop kid hides\nthe laptop i've stopped giving him money\nand i've asked husband to do the same\ni'm at my wit's end with him and i have\nno idea what to do i've tried finding\nother activities for him but to do but\neverything but that stupid game bores\nhim even netflix doesn't satisfy him he\nis very easily bored and when he's bored\nhe gets incredibly obnoxious i've spoken\nwith his doctors who increase his\nadderall dose good give him more\nstimulants and gave him additional\nmedication but i'm only seeing a small\ndifference parents help definitely this\nperson needs help before we start\ngetting mad at mom let's understand\nthing number one which is that some of\ny'all had a mom like this who restricted\nyour gaming and took things away and\ny'all hated them for it and when you\nfought you won you snuck things behind\ntheir back so do we hate moms like this\nwhile we're in this situation yes but\nyou know what also happens we blame moms\nlike this for not being hard enough oh\nmom i was 15. you should have been more\nstrict you should have helped me study\nyou should have made me study so parents\nare in a really tricky situation because\nwe fight and chafe against them when\nthey take things away from us but if we\nget what we want we blame the parents\nanyway for not being strict enough it's\nreally challenging so what's the crux of\nthe problem how do we understand the\nsituation from both the parents\nperspective and the kids perspective and\nhow do we start moving forward in this\nway thankfully we have a lot of\nexperience with this we've been very\nsuccessful at helping parents and their\nkids rebuild their relationship and\novercome unhealthy video game habits so\nthe first thing we're gonna break this\ndown for you okay there are three things\nto really understand here the most\nimportant thing how do i fix my son's\ngaming addiction i'll say it now i will\nsay it again no one can fix an addiction\nfor someone else you cannot cure an\naddiction you cannot make someone else\nattain sobriety addiction has to be\nconquered by the person so i no matter\nhow hard i want to i can't cure my child\nof my child's gaming addiction alcohol\naddiction heroin addiction there's a lot\nof stuff that i can do to facilitate\nsobriety there's a lot of stuff that i\ncan do to support sobriety but i can't\nfix sobriety in someone else and the\nbasic problem that we've seen in in this\nis our approach is that right now it's\nparent versus child they're both trying\nto out maneuver each other they're not\non the same team they're not working\ntogether and so as long as your child is\ntrying to circumvent you this is going\nto happen circumvented boundaries\ncircumvented boundaries so what parents\ntry to do is they try to control control\ncontrol control control and what kids\ntry to do is circumvent circumvent\ncircumvent you can't force someone into\nbeing sober or even if you can it'll\nonly be for a little while and the\nsecond they get an opportunity they're\ngoing to circumvent you this is a war\nthat you can't win as a parent so then\nthe question kind of becomes okay well\nlike if i can't win the war how on earth\ndo i get my kid to stop playing video\ngames and that's where you've gotta\nstart by\nhaving conversations with them about\nlike how the gaming is affecting them\nright so this is where like\nthere's an antagonistic relationship\nhere so the\nnext thing that i would recommend to\nthis parent is like talk to your child\nwhat i'm seeing is a lot of limits being\nimposed i'm seeing a lot of punishment\nwhich makes sense we're not saying that\nboundaries and punishments don't have a\ntime and a place but right now you all\nare fighting against each other and any\nkind of punishment that you\nexhibit they're going to be disobedient\nthey're going to be passive aggressive\nand they're going to try to circumvent\nit at every chance how on earth are you\never going to win and what does winning\nmean squashing your child into a\ncompliance that's going to just deal\nwith pat you're more you squash your\nchild the more passive aggressive stuff\nyou're going to see the more emotions\nyou're going to see the more\ndysregulation you're going to see and\nthe more that you try to find other\nthings for him and in his head does he\neven want to listen so you're trying to\nhelp and he's swatting your help away\nbecause the relationship is antagonistic\ni can guarantee you that there are other\nthings that don't bore him but right now\ni want you all to understand this like\nlet's think about this like a chess game\nif mom is taking my games away and\ntrying to find me another activity that\nmakes it less that i can enjoy if i\nagree that this activity is something i\nenjoy what does that mean about mom's\nbehavior ah that justifies mom's\nbehavior that moves the game one step\nfurther away from me because if i'm\nhaving fun doing other stuff then mom\nwill never give me the game back so even\nthough i'm enjoying it i'm actually\nlying to mom i'm not even giving it a\nchance this cannot work because the kid\nand the parent are not on the same team\nyou can cure a lot of things in other\npeople you can pull a bullet out of\nsomeone and patch them up and then\nyou're done they don't need to do\nanything when it comes to addiction\ndoesn't work other thing is oftentimes\nparents like they try right they're like\nthey tried talking to the doctor the\ndoctor upped the dose but that doesn't\nfix the problem so what do you do in\nthis situation start with conversation\nso like if you want your kid to brush\nhis teeth does a 15 year old who plays\nworld of warcraft every day understand\nwhy it's important to shower and brush\ntheir teeth every day so like talk to\nthem about it right and this is where\nit's important to like ask the kid what\nthey want it's like this is a 15 year\nold son chances are he's in puberty and\nso like this is a conversation about hey\nlike you know how do you feel about\nlet's assume cisgendered heteronormative\nfor a moment but how do you feel about\ndating would you want to date someone\nwhat's your understanding of like what\nkind of people either boys or girls that\nyou're attracted to like what kind what\nwould they want in their part what\nhappens if you don't brush your teeth\nevery day do you want to have a nice\nsmile when you start dating right and\nthis is where like all kinds of things\ncan come up oh i don't feel confident\nabout dating i feel so embarrassed then\nso you can ask them okay that sounds\nreally challenging like do you think\nthat if your smile was good versus bad\nwould that make it easier or harder for\nyou to deal with that embarrassment\nthey're like oh be so much harder if\nlike if i couldn't smile like i'd want a\nnice smile okay so like what are you\nlike how can we help you brush your\nteeth every day because that's how we\nget a nice smile this is the kind of\nthing where some of y'all may be reading\nthis and being like haha like adhd\nautism wow person doesn't know hygiene\nlike maybe that's true but my point is\nthat like whether that's true or not\nlike you have to work with your kid to\ncome up with goals that they are\nsupporting you instead of fighting you\nthat's number one talk to your kid so\nother questions to ask i know it sounds\nkind of weird but when you've got a 15\nyear old what's the point of school i'm\nnot hearing that the child actually\nunderstands what the point of school is\nand we kind of assume right and this is\nwhere things get kind of tricky\nespecially if you've got a kid who's\nneurodivergent is sometimes we have to\nexplain things to them or have\nconversations with them with things that\nwe never had to be taught ourselves\nright so talk to the kid about what's\nthe point of school and this is where\nlike we got to talk to the kid like\nbecause it's 15 right so we got to start\ntalking about things like the future\nthis scary place called the future what\ndo you want your future to be like right\ndo you want to go to college do you want\nto get a job do you want to be\nfinancially independent what do you want\nto do is there a job that you think\nwould be fun what's your understanding\nof like why we go to school next\nquestion what's the point of games\nwhat's so fun about this game and what's\nso boring about these other things why\ndo we play games what are they for right\nand that's where it's like kind of weird\nbut like i just enjoy it yeah but what\nis it for so start\nengaging your child in these kinds of\nconversations now is it going to be this\nsimple no there are all kinds of other\nthings we have to do next but this is\nwhere like there's not a shared\nunderstanding of like what the goal is\nand why we're striving for it and as\nlong as your kid doesn't think that\naddiction is a problem and has no\nproblem with failing out of the ninth\ngrade and stuff like that which he does\nright so we have evidence of that he\nstarts to listen a little bit more when\nhe realizes he has to repeat the ninth\ngrade how do you feel about repeating\nthe ninth grade i feel terrible how many\ntimes do you want to do it you want to\nrepeat the ninth grade once twice three\ntimes what's your goal you tell me and\nhow much do you want me to help you not\nrepeat the ninth grade twice okay so i'm\nwilling to help but this is what i need\nfrom you this is what i'm gonna do and\nthis is what you're gonna do so now we\nget to another problem when i'm trying\nto fix my son's gaming addiction who has\nwho's bearing the responsibility of\nfixing the addiction who has no\nresponsibility my kid when i have all\nthe responsibility and my kid has none\nof the responsibility we're gonna get\nsituations like this you're gonna\ncircumvent and lying because i'm the one\nwho's responsible it's my job to make\nsure he passes so he can do whatever he\nwants to but at the end of the day i'm\nthe one who's responsible so i have to\ncrack down more and more and more and\nmore and more to make sure the kid\nbecause that's probably what's happened\nbecause when i was 14 right so mom is\nstruggling so who's responsible for\nshowering and brushing teeth mom is not\nkid that's why i struggle when it\ndoesn't get done this is how you know\nwho's responsible when it doesn't get\ndone who stresses over it that's the\nperson who has responsibility so if you\nwant to fix this you have to have shared\nresponsibility then the parent naturally\nasks how the f do i get my kid to take\nresponsibility and that's where this is\nwhere the parent has done a couple of\ngood things right so i would even start\nnot by punitive but creating a situation\nwhere gaming opens up depending on\nwhether the kid does what they're\nsupposed to do it's not two hours per\nday until dinner is ready after which\nyou shower etc etc it's like okay once\nyou you tell me what the targets are we\nagree on what the targets are it's going\nto be like c average in summer school\nand once you hit those targets you can\nplay as much as you want as long as\nyou're hitting the target you can play\nas much as you want as long as you're\ngoing to bed on time waking up on time\ndoing your chores and doing your\nschoolwork you can play as much as you\nwant or you can play two hours or four\nhours or whatever amount of restriction\nyou want to do but the key thing is that\nwe want to incentivize the right\nbehavior gotta brush your teeth every\nday gotta shower every day and then this\nis the kind of thing where what i would\ndo is okay if you brush if you brush\nyour teeth and shower and are in bed by\n9 30 you get to play games tomorrow you\nget the two hours tomorrow this is the\nother big thing that parents don't\nrealize there's a lot of like simple\nstuff in terms of boundaries that never\noccurs to them and one is that one day\nis the unit under which all\nprivileges and punishments need to\nhappen you can actually reward behavior\ntoday you can give people the reward\ntomorrow and the cool thing is when you\nstart giving the reward tomorrow it\nactually helps someone with adhd because\nit encourages their brain to plan into\nthe future and restrict their impulses\ntoday now this is what's really\nchallenging about doing this as a parent\nis when you sort of say like okay no\ngames tomorrow if they don't brush their\nteeth and you know shower whatever go to\nbed by 9 30 and then like what happens\nwhen they don't do that right like as a\nparent your instinct is to go in and\nyell at them we're not going to yell at\nthem just pop your head in 9 30 by the\nway i noticed you haven't showered have\nit brushed no games tomorrow if you're\nnot in bed by 10 it's lights out time if\nyou want to you can have half an hour to\nshower and brush now at 10 o'clock it's\ngoing to be lights out your choice so\nthis is where parents really struggle is\nthey don't want to surrender that\ncontrol they don't want to surrender\nthat responsibility and you don't want\nto surrender it which means your par\nyour kid doesn't share that\nresponsibility which means the whole\ncycle continues so this is the hard\nthing for parents is that as you start\nsharing responsibility outcomes can get\nworse for your kid in the short term if\nthey're actually responsible you got to\nlet them stumble and parents don't want\nto do that and then they wind up in this\nkind of situation where the parent is\nfreaking out making sure all the work\ngets done making sure that you did your\nhomework and studied for your test\nbecause we don't want to get an f and\nthen as you take the responsibility the\nkid gives it up but i think sharing\nresponsibility is very important and\nsetting gaming as rewards for good\nbehavior as opposed to you did bad\ntherefore i'm going to punish you\nbecause this sort of it means that the\ndefault is entitlement to the game and\nas long as you don't screw up i'll let\ngo of the punishment there's no reward\nit's all about punishment and\ncircumventing and when you've got a\npunishing kind of system instead of a\nreward kind of system what you're going\nto do is you're going to get people who\ncircumvent the boundaries to avoid\npunishment so have conversations\nnumber one number two\nreward based systems share\nresponsibility but sharing\nresponsibility means that you have to be\nable to tolerate a bad outcome actually\nthe first thing that we talked about\neven more important all the others that\nyou can't fix an addiction all on your\nown you need your son's help the last\nthing that we've got to be very careful\nabout this is a very important tip gotta\nget dad on board he spends a lot of his\ntime playing world of warcraft which his\ndad also plays and pays for the game i'm\nnot hearing dad anywhere in this\nconversation like what the f\ndad needs to talk to him about like if\ndad is the one playing wow and playing\nfor the subscription like dad needs to\nsit down and have a conversation with\nhis son hey here's when it's acceptable\nto play mom to play wow and here's when\nit's unacceptable to play wow if the dad\nis the one who plays the game and like\nintroduced the game and pays for the\ngame like dad needs to be part of the\nconversation this is devastating for so\nmany parents when one parent is like hey\nthis gaming is a problem the other\nparent is like ah they'll grow out of it\nor you've got divorce situations where\ndad lets unrestricted gaming or mom\nlet's unrestricted gaming kid knows how\nto manipulate mom into like ignoring\nthings or mom is so loving and\naffectionate and like doesn't set\nappropriate boundaries and then kid gets\nto play none then what's happened to the\ntear the parents are tearing their hair\nout because the two weeks when the kid\nis with me i'm very very strict make\nsure they study every day in the two\nweeks they're with the other parent they\nlet it all go to hell and the kid is\nstill skating by with c's because they\ndon't study at all when they're at the\nother parents house so both parents need\nto be on the same page whether y'all are\ndivorced or not divorced whoever is in a\ncaretaker role in the parents in the\nkids life needs to be on the same page\nhow do i fix my son's gaming addiction\nby having a conversation with your\nhusband and making sure he is trying to\ndo the same by having a conversation\nwith your son and make sure he is trying\nto do the same not saying that people\nshould get divorced but it's like this\nis overcoming addiction is hard enough\nwhen everyone is on the same team\ninfinitely harder when people are\nactively sabotaging your efforts so it's\ntough like this whole dynamic between\nparents and kids is getting worse we\nwant to blame the parents and even as\ngamers let's be honest we sometimes\nblame them unfairly mom i'm so mad at\nyou for taking the game away and then\nfive years later mom why did you give me\nthe game it's your fault that i don't\nhave study habits and i'm failing out of\ncollege right parents can't win so how\ndo we approach this it starts off by\nrecognizing you can't fix an addiction\nfor another human being you gotta get\nhim on board you can't you cannot fix\nthe addiction in spite of your son if\nyour son is trying to circumvent be\npassive aggressive disobedient and\nemotionally dysregulated at every turn\nstart with conversation use gaming as a\nreward enroll dad enroll also therapists\nand psychiatrists because there's way\nmore than this is the other thing when\nit comes to especially autism and adhd\nthere's a lot of useful treatment that\nis not medication it's behavioral\ntreatment it's organizational treatment\nit's prioritization treatment a good\ntherapist who works with someone who's\non the spectrum\nor someone who has adhd will teach kids\nwill strengthen your child's executive\nskills the goal is not restriction or\ncompliance the goal is to help your\nchild grow in into an adult where they\ntake responsibility and start managing\ntheir own problems sometimes they need\nsome explicit education in how to do\nthat and sometimes parents need some\nexplicit education in how to deal with\nthis why are so many parents struggling\nwith this it's because most of what we\nlearn as parents we get taught\nautomatically by our parents in terms of\nour household do you pray together\nbefore you sit down and eat what is\ndinner time like who how does laundry\nhappen what are how do you do chores all\nthis stuff we get taught automatically\nby our parents how do you manage\nemotions how do you manage rewards what\nare the expectations around going to\nschool going to college all that gets\nbaked in because our parents taught it\nto us most of what we learn about\nparenting is automatic the thing is 40\nyears ago games didn't exist and so\nparents of this generation struggling\noverwhelmed because this wasn't a part\nof my education because it's completely\nnew and as it's completely new like we\ndon't know how to set boundaries around\ngames like i never had to set boundaries\naround like my parents never had to set\nboundaries around how much tv i watched\nbecause when i was growing up there were\ncartoons on saturday morning and there\nwas crap like the news after 5 p.m which\ni didn't want to watch anyway they\ndidn't have to set limits on me because\nthere was only a limited amount of\ncartoons i could watch and so the amount\nof limit setting and boundary setting\nthat parents have to do now is way\nhigher than they've ever had to do\nparents have never had like you know my\nparents didn't have to deal with bill\nwell i mean i guess in a sense they did\nbillion dollar corporations trying to\naddict me to stuff which in that case is\nprobably cigarettes right but now it's\nlike it's games so it's challenging but\nit starts with can't do it all on your\nown got to get your kids help starts\nwith conversations sharing\nresponsibility letting your child\nstumble and hopefully also includes the\nsupport of other caretakers as well as\ntreatment professionals you don't want\nto just throw medication at the problem\na lot of this stuff is behavioral so\nteaching your kid how to respond how to\ncommunicate all that kind of stuff they\ncan learn in therapy so good luck\nparents because you all are gonna need\nit because we're a tough bunch how early\ncan you start talking to your kids about\nit i started at the age of two so i'll\ngive you all a couple of quick tips what\ndo i do to help my kids so i'll give\ny'all in how early can you start with\nkids i started at the age of two so\nhere's what i taught my kids my goal is\nto teach restraint instead of\nrestriction so i'll ask my kids things\nlike when you watch the first 15 minutes\nhow excited are you to watch and after\nyou've been watching an hour how much\nfun is it right during the first 15\nminutes pause for a second are you\nhaving a lot of fun and one hour in\nlet's pause for a second are you having\na lot of fun two hours are you having a\nlot of fun this necessitates that i let\nthem\nwatch something for two hours and then\nthey'll say no i'm actually not having\nas much fun and sometimes i'll even ask\nthem do you want to stop watching after\nan hour or do you want to keep going and\nas you raise awareness kids will start\nto realize after you've been watching\nfor two hours are you happy are you\ncranky because a kid can realize oh i'm\ncranky it's just about helping them\nbecome aware asking them after we spend\na weekend away from screens did you have\na lot of fun this weekend did you miss\nscreen time when i ask you what you want\nto do why do you say screen time first\neven though you say you had more fun\nthis this weekend how does that work why\ndo you want screens what do they do for\nyou i mean we'll see right so like kids\nare doing okay for now but maybe five\nyears from now they'll both be addicted\nand this will be terrible strategy but\ngenerally speaking it works really well\nwe've got to equip our children with\nunderstanding does it mean they get to\nwatch as much as they want to no\nbut when i do let them watch i like i\nencourage them to think about what the\nimpact of it is and sometimes like we'll\ndo that right like we'll be like okay\nwhat do you want to do tonight you want\nto watch a movie fine but then i'll set\nlimits on them for the next day i'll say\nwe can watch a movie and you can stay up\nlate but you are not allowed to be\ncranky tomorrow and then when they're\ncranky tomorrow we'll have a\nconversation about it why are you cranky\njust because you're cranky doesn't mean\nthat everyone else needs to do things\ndifferently so unless you can regulate\nyour emotions from this point forward\nwe're not going to watch movies before\nwe go to sleep and stay up too late in\nthe future it's your choice you you show\nme that you can regulate the behavior\nand we'll continue the reward and if\nthey're able to regulate then i'll\nreward them close that loop with\ncommunication say hey you did a really\ngood job regulating next weekend we can\ntry watching a movie again and i want to\nsee if you can regulate next time or\neven avoid the crankiness entirely right\nit's all about closing that loop and\nhaving a lot of communication that's the\nthing is like parents we don't realize\nfirst of all we don't have time secondly\nit's like hard to constantly be talking\nto your kids about computer usage or\nscreen usage but that's what it takes i\nstarted it too but\nthe questions get more sophisticated the\nolder that they get kids are capable of\nrestraint absolutely kids are very\ncapable restraint\nit doubly so if you actually teach them\nhow to restrain yourself right so i'll\nteach my kids how to meditate we'll\nteach them restraint restraint can be\ntaught for those of you that are\nconfused by that you should definitely\ncheck out dr k's guide to adhd and doing\nstuff because we'll teach you how to do\nstuff which is a skill that you can\nlearn most of us just stumble through it\nguide isn't out so you can't check it\nout yet your kids meditate when they\nwant to at what age i started teaching\nthem something like meditation before\nthey were a year old and even under two\nso there are some focusing practices\nwhich you can teach a child like even\nbefore they're two i'll give them like\nfor example i'll get a cup of warm water\nand i'll get a cup of cold water so\nhere's our i guess our meditation for\nthe day which is going to be how do you\nteach a less than two-year-old to focus\ntheir mind so first you get their energy\nout right so like you do something\nphysical so they're not like so fidgety\nand stuff then you get a cup of warm\nwater and you get a cup of cold water\nand then you tell them put your hand in\nthis cup and put your hand in this cup\nand what is it what do you feel and even\na two-year-old can be like this is warm\nthis is cold and they're like you'll see\nthem as they put their hands in the\nwater they'll like be wiggling around\nyes their hands go in the water they're\nlike stop and they'll like start to\nexperiment let's start playing with it\nand they'll focus their mind or you give\nthem different things to smell so\nanother thing that i'll do is i'll tell\nmy kid close your eyes let's do smelling\ngame and then we'll give them different\nthings to smell and then like the kid\nwill be still you can say okay you can\nyou can hold it yourself so daddy's hand\nis open grab the thing and you can smell\nit yourself they'll grab it okay touch\nit tell me what you feel so early on for\nkids kids if you want a child to\nmeditate the key thing to understand is\nthat children are very sensory creatures\nright so like early on in our brains\nwe're getting a ton of sensory stimuli\nwe're very attuned to our senses so kids\nare very sensitive to things like sounds\nright they don't sleep if it's too noisy\nthey're very sensitive to things like\ntaste they're very exploratory they'll\nput objects in their mouth when they're\nvery young because they want to feel\nthings they want to touch everything\ndon't touch that it's poop one-year-old\ndoesn't care they want to touch\neverything they want to taste everything\nthey want to see everything they want to\nsmell everything so encourage that use\nthose senses so if you want to use some\nkind of sensory experience you put some\nstructure around it with enough sensory\nvariety so i'll give them like five\ndifferent things to smell and then what\nhappens when they when they smell is\nthis is how we are going to teach also\nwe teach this in in the guide but\npratyahara is sensory withdrawal or\nsensory restraint so what we do in those\nkinds of situations is like we're using\nour sense organs to focus our mind so\nwhen we chant a mantra when we're using\nprayer beads when we're doing ohm\nchanting when we're noticing the breath\nwe're using some kind of sensory organ\nlike our proprioception and noticing the\nbreath to focus our mind and you can do\nthe same thing with a kid in some ways\nit's even easier with a kid they're more\nsensory dependent so you can ask them to\nlisten to something right they won't\nappreciate music but like you can ask\nthem okay i'm gonna play\na sound like a jungle sound like a\njungle track for five minutes and i want\nyou to pay attention tell me how many\ndifferent animals you hear anytime you\nhear an animal you let me know and then\nfor five minutes their mind is focused\non listening their attention is focused\nand it's curious right oh there's a\ntiger and it's really great like they\ncan learn very early and then you can\nmove more to formal meditation which is\nwhat i'm teaching now so now my kids are\na little older that's how you teach kids\nto meditate\nyou"
