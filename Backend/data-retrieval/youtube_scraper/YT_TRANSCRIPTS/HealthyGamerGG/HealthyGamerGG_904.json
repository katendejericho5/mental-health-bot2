    "transcript": "but now what happens is over time\nin order to get promoted if person a\nstarts going above and beyond person b\nif they want that promotion starts going\nabove and beyond and so now what sort of\nhappened is that in order to get that\npromotion you don't just go above and\nbeyond you have to go way above and\nbeyond so let's take a quick look\nthere's a really interesting washington\npost article so quiet quitting isn't\nreally about quitting here are the signs\nburnout is at an all-time high and\nhere's what managers should be on the\nlookout for so this article was really\ninteresting and someone about a week ago\nor two weeks ago kind of quote uh came\nup with this term of quiet quitting and\nwhat this article talks about is that\nyou know what people are starting to do\nis renounce hustle culture and sort of\nquitting the idea of going above and\nbeyond and so what this sort of like\nmeans is that so people are sort of\nusing this term quiet quitting and\nyou know as is i guess this person kathy\ncatcher says it's quiet quitting is a\nnew term for an old concept which is\nemployee disengagement so the article\ngoes on to talk about burnout um you\nknow it talks a little bit about you\nknow how quiet quitting is shockingly\ndoing what you're paid for and\nso so there's there's like a lot of\nconcern about burnout there's a lot of\nconcern about wow this is like great\nexposure for this ad um you know what\ndoes quiet quitting actually look like\nand so we're talking about things like\nuh diminished motivation low engagement\nbeing withdrawn from the team limiting\ncommunication and interaction to only\nwhat is required and then the article\nstarts talking a little bit about you\nknow what to do about it if you were a\nmanager okay so that the target of this\nthis article is sort of geared towards\nmanager and so how should employers\nrespond you know so like people are sort\nof like changing like their their work\nethic their approach to their jobs and\nthings like that so what the article\nsort of suggests is that to better\nunderstand how employees are feeling we\nshould frequently survey staff and go\nbeyond productivity scores and seek\ncomments that help managers understand\nthe full picture of engagement it goes\non to talk about doing more onboarding\nand exit interviews by hr to motivate to\nsee what motivates employees and drives\nthem to leave and then how do you build\nworkplaces that don't want people to\nleave and this is where they say\nmanagers can help burnout by encouraging\nemployees to take breaks during the day\nand use their vacation and paid time off\nright so you're burnt out like why don't\nyou take your vacation because that's\ngoing to fix the problem right and then\nthey're sort of talking a little bit\nabout a couple of other things like um\nyou know\noffice yoga and taking man uh mental\nhealth days it's critical critical for\nmanagers that foster a a workplace\nenvironment that is psychologically safe\nso that employees feel comfortable in\nasking for help without retribution that\nsounds good i think that's actually the\nbest point which we're gonna talk about\nso what's the deal with this quiet\nquitting like what's going on here and\nlike what what should we really do about\nit so i think there are a couple of\nthings to keep in mind so let's try to\nunderstand how we got to quiet quitting\nthe way we got to quiet quitting was\nthrough something that i would call\neffort inflation\nso here's what used to happen at your\njob so you start with a job and there's\ncertain expectations requirements right\nthis is what's required of you of your\njob and then what happened is people\nrealized okay there are five employees\nand one of them is going to get promoted\nto manager so what employees started\ndoing is going above and beyond because\nit's the employee that goes above and\nbeyond who gets promoted and so there\nwas a benefit to going above and beyond\nbut now what happens is over time in\norder to get promoted if person a starts\ngoing above and beyond person b if they\nwant that promotion starts going above\nand beyond person c goes above and\nbeyond person d goes above and beyond\nperson e goes above and beyond and so\nnow what sort of happened is that in\norder to get that promotion you don't\njust go above and beyond you have to go\nway above and beyond so now going do\ngoing the extra mile is the norm and so\nas more and more people strive for\npromotion what started to happen is\ncompanies started expecting this from\ntheir employees now it's become the norm\nright because everyone's doing it and\nthen the employer is like oh this is\nkind of interesting like everyone's\ngoing above and beyond i guess this is\nthe workplace culture this is the\nculture of the workplace that people we\nwant people who are go-getters we want\npeople who are going to go the extra\nmile we want people who are going to et\ncetera et cetera and so it's almost like\na college degree where like before a\ncollege degree used to get you\nparticular jobs right like in order to\nget that job you needed a college degree\nthen everyone started going to college\nand so the value of the college degree\nwent down and now you need a master's\ndegree in order to distinguish yourself\nso it's like educational inflation and\nwe've seen this effort inflation and so\nnow like how do we kind of approach this\nif we're employees if we're employers so\nfor the record i don't think that going\nabove and beyond at work is necessarily\nbad um and we'll kind of talk a little\nbit about that but i think there's a lot\nof really interesting questions that you\nshould ask yourself so the first thing\nto consider is what kind of workplace\nyou actually work at and this is for\nemployers and employees because we've\ndone corporate consulting before and in\nour career coaching program we work with\npeople who are primarily employees but\nalso managers and things like that and\nthe first thing to understand is what is\nthe value in your workplace you have to\nask this question critically what is the\nvalue in your workplace of a going going\nabove and beyond is it actually rewarded\nin some way how is it rewarded what is\nthe expectation and this is where if\nyou're an employee and you've been going\nabove and beyond and you haven't really\nbeen rewarded for it that's something\nthat you need to seriously like think\nabout right what is the value to you\ngoing the extra mile because the truth\nis that there's a lot of value to going\nthe extra mile in some places and if\nyou're an employer you need to be asking\nyourself the same question what happens\nto employees how how are employees who\ngo above and beyond treated in\ncomparison to employees who just do the\nbare minimum and this is where we've got\nto be really really careful because\ndepending on like you know where you\nwork so i think like government service\nis kind of like a good example where\nlike your promotion rate and your salary\ninclude increase tends to be based on\nseniority so going the extra mile\ndoesn't necessarily get you a whole lot\nnow i've worked with some people who are\nmanagers in government service who do\nactually really reward employees and\nthings like that so that's their\nexceptions to that rule but for you to\njust critically think a little bit about\nokay what is the situation in my\nworkplace the second thing that that\nreally kind of bothers me about this\narticle and this is something that we\nneed to really think about is that this\narticle is geared towards managers and\nemployers and it's not really advocating\nto truly understand what the employee\nexperiences and this is a huge problem\nso i'll give y'all just a simple example\nand this is something that i struggle\nwith myself so the article says\nand as a manager encourage people to\ntake vacation days so there's what there\nare two kinds of work there's work in\nwhich vacation is time off and there's\nwork in which vacation is\nprocrastinating with your work so if i\ntake a week off a vacation do i just do\nthat week\nthat work of that week before vacation\nand after vacation because in some\nemployment situations when you take time\noff it's not like you do less work it's\njust all that work gets delayed till you\nget back from vacation and the week that\nyou get back from vacation you have to\ndo twice as much work as you usually\nwould and so these are the kinds of\nthings where like instead of encouraging\npeople to take time off a better\nquestion would be why on earth aren't\npeople taking time off right because in\nsome work situations that i've seen i've\nbeen in and actually content creation is\none of them where it's like we you know\ni have to stream additionally if i'm\ngoing to take a week of vacation i\nactually don't i don't get time off i\njust reallocate time and are you in a\nwork situation where time off is really\ntime off or is it just piling on work to\nthe next week and so these are the kind\nof fundamental things that you can\nencourage your employees to take time\noff but the question is what kind of\nwork situation are you in like are you\nin a situation where time off really\ndoesn't exist so good example of time\noff being time off is the medical\nprofession so that's usually where for\nexample if i'm a doctor and i go on\nvacation and someone covers my patients\nit's not like the work from that week is\nwaiting for me right so if something\nhappens during the week that i'm on\nvacation one of my colleagues covers for\nme and then i come back and it's like\nback to normal so another thing that\nthey talk about is frequent surveys and\nexit interviews what bothers me about\nthis is that there's sort of this\nattitude that okay like if you want to\nknow how to motivate your employees like\nask them right try to figure out what\nmotivates them so that you can structure\nthe environment to kind of maximize\ntheir motivation which sort of makes\nsense from an employer's standpoint the\nproblem that i have with this kind of\napproach is that i don't get the sense\nthat people are genuinely trying to\nunderstand for the employee's benefit\nright we're trying to understand from\nthe manager's benefit so the way that\nthey sort of structure this is like okay\ndo like you know\nonboarding interviews and exit\ninterviews to try to maximize motivation\nwhereas like that seems to me like the\nemployer isn't actually caring about the\nemployee they're really thinking about\ntheir own goals which is like okay how\ndo i maximize productivity of my workers\nand the other thing that i'd sort of say\nis that if you're in a manager and\nyou're struggling with employees who are\nquiet quitting it's not about trying to\nassess their motivation so you can\nmaximize it it's about actually asking\nthem hey what's going on like do you\nfeel like your extra work is rewarded\nand so quiet quitting is going on all\nover the place and i think part of the\nreason is because for a long time we've\nbeen advocating for hustle culture we've\nbeen advocating to work hard to get\nahead the challenge though is that\nworking hard no longer gets you ahead so\nlike that's why people are quiet\nquitting like that's simple right it's\nthat simple and if you're an employer\nand you're trying to figure out like\nokay like why aren't people like going\nthe extra mile anymore and that's\nbecause human beings are going to do\nwhat rewards them like there's like\nbehavioral reinforcement mechanisms in\nour brain and if you if people are quiet\nquitting on the job like there could be\nsomething going on personally with them\ncould be but it could be because the way\nthat you've structured the work\nenvironment doesn't actually reward\npeople going the extra mile couple of\nother things to kind of think about is\nlike you know encouraging people to take\nvacation is like why aren't they taking\nit in the first place so i i i don't\nthink that going the extra mile is bad i\ndon't think that all employers are evil\ni've worked in particular situations\nwhere i did go the extra mile and it\nlike actually did work out really well\num you know one of my mentors once said\ngoing the extra mile for a patient is\ngoing a mile too far so there are times\nwhere actually going the extra mile\nactually encourages other people to\nslack off so you've got to be careful\nabout that kind of stuff and if you're\nin this situation where you're quiet\nquitting or burning out or things like\nthat i think first of all that's\ncompletely okay if you're a manager\nwhere your employees are doing this kind\nof thing i think this is where you've\ngot to start to ask a lot of questions\ndoes my workplace actually reward my\nextra work and that's where\nyou know what we've learned in career\ncoaching is that you may say like oh my\ngod no they don't like i'm so like\nresentful because i work so hard and\nlike they don't reward it and this is\nwhere in career coaching sometimes we'll\nlike discover something very interesting\nwhich is that when the client comes in\nwe'll like how does your employer know\nyou're doing extra work well i don't\nknow they just like they should know\nit's like wait a minute how should they\nknow have you ever told them you're like\nno\nlike why not well because i don't want\nto i don't want them to think that i'm\nlike i'm not trying to like take too\nmuch credit i don't want to be a brag i\ndon't want to brag about what i do and\nall this kinds of stuff so what we've\nsort of really discovered is that\ninteracting with your employer can be\nlike complicated in ways that we don't\nrealize and there can be other kinds of\nperceptual biases and stuff like that\nbut at the end of the day i think that\nquiet quitting is fundamentally\nhappening because of something like\neffort inflation where going the extra\nmile used to get you promoted but it\ndoesn't necessarily anymore and if\nthat's the case then as an employer\nyou've got to really think a little bit\nabout how can i reward people who go the\nextra mile couple of other things to\nconsider is instead of just telling\npeople to take vacation like really\nthink about why on earth would employee\nnot take vacation right it's just a net\npositive and chances are there are\nthings that you don't understand about\nthe workplace you've created and this\nsort of gets to the last kind of general\npoint that i have is that what i'm\nnoticing is that employees are trying to\nshape employee behavior which sort of\ntotally makes sense without really\nunderstanding the perspective of\nemployees and you can try to shape\nemployee behavior all you want to but i\nthink it's like it's not about\nmaximizing their motivation it's about\nrecognizing that your employee is a\nhuman being and that human beings you\nknow have desires and fears and\nwant to do a good job they want to\ndistinguish themselves and like trying\nto actually understand who this person\nis and why they do what they do is going\nto be very very helpful and when we've\ndone even things like corporate\nconsulting and we sort of take that\napproach which is like forget about\nproductivity for a second recognize that\nyour team is are human beings and what's\ngoing on with them and the cool thing is\nwhen we actually prioritize the human\nbeing we actually see an increase in\nproductivity questions chat pause due to\nscroll oh my god so many things\nair season the managers are too\noverworked to do that beautifully put\nbrilliant right and so like that's\nthat's exactly what happened so here's\nthe other thing that leads to like quiet\nquitting is that sometimes stuff just\nkeeps on getting piled onto your plate\nand there's like scope creep for your\nwork and so like i've seen this a lot\nwhere where i work with a lot of good\nmanagers who want to do right by their\nemployees but the structure of the\nenvironment that they work in doesn't\nallow for that and the number one\nleading cause of burnout is actually\nsomeone trying to do a good job in a\nsystemic thing that gets in the way and\nprevents them from doing a good job it's\nkind of it's bizarre but there's been a\nton of research on this burnout doesn't\ncome from overwork burnout doesn't come\nfrom laziness shockingly in fact the\nopposite burnout comes from\nexcessive effort with minimal\nbenefit so i get burnt out as a\nphysician when i'm trying i i can work\n30 hour calls and feel good about it at\nthe end of the day i can work 30 hours\nin a day in a day and a half i guess\nthey're like you know it's going on\nmonday morning i leave tuesday at noon\nactually doesn't burn me out what burns\nme out is when i spend three hours on\nthe phone with an insurance company\ntrying to get medicine for a patient\nfor a patient that needs this\nlife-saving medicine it's when i'm\nspending a lot of work and i can't even\nhelp the person like i'm happy spending\ntime to help people and this is where\nanother thing that i kind of want to say\nis that for far too long in our society\nhave we taken advantage of people who\nare doing altruistic jobs so for far too\nlong we've taken i'm thinking especially\nof like teachers\nand people in the medical profession\nwhere these are jobs that we like value\nalmost like on a moral sense right like\nyou're saving lives and like since like\nwe're educating children and it's for\nthe children what we've managed to do is\ncreate situations where we take\nadvantage of individuals altruism and so\nwhat i tend to see\nvery very often i don't know if this is\nstatistically correct or not i see\nemployees getting taken advantage of the\nmost in these two professions because\nyou're saving lives like you're doing it\nfor a good reason right so why are you\ncomplaining about the pay and what we\nalso tend to see in both of these\nprofessions if you look at like tuition\nright and you look at like college\neducation and things like that if you\nlook at the education industry in the\nmedical industry this is also where you\nsee like tons of profit\nyou"
