    "video_title": "Is Mental Health Subjective?",
    "transcript": "so this is where there's a lot of really\ninteresting data so if you look at\nepidemiologic data of the incidence or\nprevalence of mental illness across\ncultures what you discover is that\nthere's roughly the same amount of\nmental illness all over the world is\npsychological mental health subjective\nis everyone mentally ill but just\ndoesn't know it is being mentally\nhealthy and being a good person supposed\nto go hand in hand\nall really great questions\nokay there's gonna be like kind of a\nwall of text here okay so bear with me\nit's it's worth reading though\nsome people say that examples of true\nmental health are inner peace or healthy\nintegration into some sort of community\ndoes it really not matter what kind of\ncommunity or what inner peace is based\non\ntake for example conventionally extreme\nexamples like condoning slavery or\ngenocide does it really make sense to\nsay that a bunch of people who are\nprobably hard-working god-fearing family\nloving and generous to the people in\ntheir social circle are suddenly\nmentally disturbed because they do not\nadvocate for those around them who were\noppressed\nthere are many countries today where\nslavery still exists and i know many\npeople from those countries who don't\nsee it as a big deal in their home\ncountry even if they live in the u.s and\nare supposed to be westernized and\nnormal\na lot of these people grew up with\nslaves sometimes with slaves who were\ntheir same age so it wasn't like the\nreality of being a slave was too vague\nand distant for them to be able to\nunderstand\nin fact some of these people think that\nthink their people are doing their\nslaves a kindness because being enslaved\nis better than the living conditions\nthey had when they were free\nif people adapt and normalize these\nbeliefs around them at what point is\nthat considered psychologically bad\nand if certain people genuinely believe\nthat the oppressed deserve to be\noppressed\neven if the job of the therapist is to\nmake a person functional and better\nintegrated into society i'm just\nconfused about whether belonging and\nbeing integrated to a group makes you\nany healthier\nevery generation people try to outlaw\nthings that were completely acceptable\nfor all history before that time\nspanking children has pretty much always\nbeen considered the norm but research\nhas now solidified negative effects that\ncorrelate with spanking and there is a\npossibility that spanking will be\noutlawed in the future\ndoes this mean that most people are\nraised in the past become mentally\nunhealthy because of this and didn't\nknow it if most children were hit do you\nconsider that a pathology\nwhat if the commonality of spanking made\nchildren unfazed by it i see people\ncalling\nthose who would be physically hurt a\nchild\nwho who would physically hurt a child\nsick or monstrous and all i keep\nthinking\nis that there is no way all these\nparents in history could suddenly be\nperceived as monsters\nat what point do people stop being\nmonsters or mentally sick and start\nbeing healthy if they believe what they\nare doing is right\nthe fact that all these parents really\ndid not love their kids seems ridiculous\nokay so this person kind of goes on for\na while\nall right do you guys want me to\ncontinue reading\nor should we pause\nokay\nthe duality of chat\nall right we're gonna just finish\nreading okay\num\nsome people mentioned that\nchildren are actually people too and you\nwouldn't hit the adults around if if if\nthey did something you thought was wrong\nthis point makes it seem like parents\nhave historically dehumanized children\nby default\ndoes that make those parents mentally\nunhealthy or ill or toxic\npeople adapt to all kinds of situations\nand in some situations people might\nfunction more optimally than others\nparents often conclude that the fact\nthat their children were well adjusted\nin life means that they really loved and\ntook care of their children and did what\nwas best for them\nokay people are saying finish\nif i think society is terrible then from\nmy view i would see these parents as\nobviously mentally sick for raising\ntheir children to become well adjusted\ni know older women in my family who were\nmarried and became pregnant at the ages\nas young as 11 or 12 to men much older\nthan them\ni know even more women who are not that\nold that didn't even know they were\ngoing to get married at all until right\nbefore their wedding day if you ask any\nof them about it now they honestly don't\ncare and just say that their life was\ngreat\nalthough i can't deny that not every\nwoman accepted their fate deep inside it\nwasn't like there was an epidemic of\ndisordered behavior from these brides\nstemming from trauma\nif society never taught them that child\nmarriage was shameful\nthen do they ever become mentally\nunhealthy by being married so young\ncan they really be so scarred by it now\neven though they\nthey all genuinely seem so quote unquote\nnormal\nhow can it also be reasonable to\nsuddenly vilify the men they married if\nculture influences the minds of men to\nfind younger girls attractive or\nsuitable for marriage why should the\nmental state of these men be regarded as\nunhealthy\nhow can it be said that the families of\nthe bride and groom are all simply sick\nthe image of frightened little girls and\ntheir monstrous husbands it just seems\nso exaggerated to me from my experiences\nlike am i supposed to just suddenly view\nmy grandfathers or uncles as evil\neven arranged marriage could be\nconsidered gross and dysfunctional in\nthe in the west yet there is no mass\nmental health crisis caused by it in the\nrest of the world\nit can be argued that if some someone is\nconfronted and told their actions have\nnegative impacts on people\nbut then they acknowledge they knowingly\ncontinue to do whatever they do they are\nnot mentally healthy\nhowever i'm doing something bad without\ncaring about it and you confront me my\nbelief system might allow me to ignore\nsome aspect of your argument by default\nsuch as believing that you are already\nuntrustworthy or believing that whoever\ntold you what you're telling me doesn't\nknow what they're talking about or many\nother reasons\nand so i will continue to feel the same\nway about what i do and consider you\nunhealthy likewise your belief system\nmight label me as unhealthy by default\nor some for similar reasons here's the\ntl dr\nwhat really defines being mentally well\nif i have strong morals does this make\nme healthy or does this make\nme a slave to my beliefs and therefore\nunhealthy is the goal post for mental\nhealth in society always moving\nso i'm going to try to do my own tl dr\nhere\nso this is a really interesting post\nthe poster in a slightly long-winded way\nbasically asks the question\nwhat does it mean to be mentally\nunhealthy\nand they kind of make the argument that\ntoday for example we've done research on\nspanking\nand we've based on scientific research\nwe've concluded\nthat spanking negatively impacts a\nchild's mental health\n500 years ago all parents used to spank\ntheir kids\ndoes that mean\nthat 500 years ago all children were\nmentally unhealthy\nso does that mean that like\nif we kind of like follow that through\nwhat that means is that for the majority\nof humanity people have been mentally\nunhealthy because people used to be\nspanked\nright and we're just sort of becoming\nenlightened now\nso what does it mean to be mentally\nunhealthy\nthe other thing that they kind of talk\nabout\nis\nmental health\nmentally unhealthy and harming another\nhuman being so they talk about things\nlike child marriage or arranged marriage\nand in these situations we would\nconsider by today's standard\nmarrying an 11 year old to be morally\nreprehensible\ndoes that mean that\nthat person is mentally unhealthy\nbecause if someone wants to marry a 11\nyear old today we also call them sick\nright this person is sick it's a sicko\npedophile\nso the other thing that this person sort\nof tangles together which i think is\nreally important is they're sort of\nusing mentally unhealthy\nand morality like kind of\ninterchangeably whereas i don't think\nthat they're interchangeable and we'll\nget to that in a second\nand so then the last kind of question\nhere is that\nwhat does this mean for society so like\nif we sort of assume that all children\nwere traumatized by spanking because we\nknow spanking is traumatic\ndoes that mean that\na hundred years from now we're gonna\nlearn that something that we're doing\ntoday is also traumatic\nand so everyone today is traumatized\nand so does that mean that being\ntraumatized and mentally unhealthy\nis sort of the norm of society\ndoes that make sense\nso there are a couple of really\nimportant points here which people in\npsychiatry love to discuss by the way\nabout moralities you know what is mental\nillness what is an adjustment to society\nlike what is kind of normal so we're\ngoing to try to unpack these things kind\nof one at a time\nthe first thing that we're going to talk\nabout\nis\ncultural accommodation and mental\nillness\nthe thing that we need to actually start\nwith is that mental health is more than\nmental illness\nmental health is more than the absence\nof mental illness\nso let's start by sort of looking at\nwhat is normal within a society and\nwhether what is normal within a society\nqualifies as mental illness or mental\nhealth or what's the relationship\nbetween those things so what's the\nrelationship between normality\nand mental illness or mental health\nso this is where there's a lot of really\ninteresting data so if you look at\nepidemiologic data of the incidence or\nprevalence of mental illness across\ncultures\nwhat you discover is that there's\nroughly the same amount of mental\nillness all over the world\nso in places where there's child\nmarriage\nversus not child marriage\nin south america in africa in east asia\ngenerally speaking we know that mental\nillness is kind of comparable across the\nworld\nso the rates of things like an anxiety\ndisorder is roughly the same we're not\ntalking about you know rates that are\nseventy percent in one culture\nand eight percent in another culture\nballpark across the board if you look at\nall the numbers they tend to look about\nthe same\nthere are certain outliers for sure\nbut generally speaking what we see is\nthat mental illness may manifest\nin a culturally sensitive way\nso for example in parts of south america\nthere's this thing called attack de\nnorvios or something like that right so\npanic attacks or they've got their own\nkind of word for it we know that in east\nasia and south asia and southeast asia\nmajor depressive disorder manifests with\nmore somatic symptoms\nso people won't talk about feeling sad\nor guilty or ashamed they'll talk about\nlow energy levels headaches weird gi\nstuff so the manifestation has a\ncultural context\nbut we know that epidemiologically\nroughly\nmental illness is the same across the\nboard so that's number one\nokay\nso what is mental illness mental illness\ntends to be\nthe the line that we draw is not\ncultural it's not about whether you do\narranged marriage or don't do arranged\nmarriage that's not a criteria for\nmental illness the criteria for mental\nillness tends to be impairment of\nfunction\nokay so what that means is that you can\ntake you know 100 people from japan with\ndepression\nmajor depressive disorder\nand it may not look the same as it does\nin let's say the netherlands\nthey may not describe the same\nexperience\nbut if you really tunnel down into it\nall hundred people from both of these\ncountries have a lot of difficulty\nworking for months at a time and they\nreally struggle there are some unifying\nfactors\nso there may be cultural manifestations\nof mental illness and that's how culture\nsort of shapes mental illness but that\nthe mental illness process seems to be\nsomewhat culturally independent\nnow the next question to kind of think\nabout is what is the relationship\nbetween morality\nand mental illness\nright so there are some places where\nit's culturally appropriate and not\nconsidered immoral to marry a 12 year\nold\nand for the majority of the world or\nmaybe that i think so anyway\nmaybe that statement is technically\nincorrect\nbut i do believe that that's correct we\nconsider an adult marrying a child an\nimmoral act\nokay\nso\nwhat's the deal there does that mean\nthat all children are traumatized\nright if we spank all of our kids 500\nyears ago does that mean that they're\ntraumatized\nso the first thing that i'd like to say\nis that\nfor too long actually i think one of the\nproblems with understanding of mental\nhealth mental illness and psychiatry is\nthat we've conflated morality with\nmental illness\nwhereas if you really look at the data\nthe two are completely separate\nso a good example of this is if you look\nat something like you know school\nshooters people will say school shooters\nare mentally ill\nnow that could be true\nbut that bothers me a little bit as a\npsychiatrist to blame\nsome kind of act of violence against\nanother human being on mental illness i\nthink is kind of like unfair and an\nincomplete oversimplification does that\nmean that they struggle with mental\nillness and they deserve some degree of\ncompassion sure\nbut\nif you say that a school shooter is\ndepressed\nthere are a lot of people out there who\nare depressed who are not shooting\nanyone\nright\nso the other thing is that you can have\nsomeone who struggles with mental\nillness and behaves immorally\nand this is where if you look at the\nepidemiologic data\nthe number of people who commit acts of\nviolence as a direct consequence of pure\nmental illness is exceedingly small\nso a good example of this is if you look\nat people with schizophrenia\nso people have this perception that\npeople with schizophrenia who are\nactively psychotic\nare more dangerous than other people and\nthat probably statistically is true\nbut the vast majority of people with\nschizophrenia who are actively psychotic\ndon't hurt anyone\nso there's a lot of misperception and\nstigma against people who are mentally\nill\nnow this is where you may have people\nwith diagnoses of mental illness who\nengage in violent behavior but i don't\nthink that that's necessarily due to the\nmental illness just as an example so for\nexample like if i'm addicted\nto a substance like cocaine\nand i run out of money or heroin and\nthen i commit armed robbery and hurt\nsomeone\nam i am i do i have a substance use\ndisorder sure\nis it the substance use disorder that's\ncausing the violence\nthat's where i'd say not really do i\nhave cravings is is it a factor at play\nyes but there are a lot of people who\nhave substance use disorders who are not\nhurting other people\nso i think that you can have both mental\nillness\nand the mental illness does not excuse\nmoral or immoral behavior those are kind\nof like independent things and there's a\nbunch of people out there who do\nstruggle with mental illness who behave\nvery morally all the time in fact that's\nthe vast majority of people who have\npsychiatric diagnoses\nso morality and like\nmental illness are kind of independent\nthere do they intersect in some ways\nabsolutely\nthis gets further complicated\nwhen we pathologize\nsomething like anti-social personality\ndisorder or sociopathy so this is where\nthings get really interesting\nbecause when someone is a sociopath they\nlack a fundamental\ncompassion or empathy for other living\norganisms they'll do things so one of\nthe diagnostic\nuh criteria\nor one of the things that we'll assess\nis like for example cruelty to animals\nduring adult uh\nas a child so you'll have a\nseven-year-old who will do things like\nyou know hurt animals torture them\nso that's like one of the diagnostic\ncriteria for antisocial personality\ndisorder\nnow when there's like a seven-year-old\nwho's doing this kind of thing\ni think it's fair to say that there\nisn't like\na well-developed moral compass at that\nage or that there's something that's\ngoing on independent of whatever moral\ncompass the seven-year-old has because\nthis is also something that's conserved\nacross different cultures and across\ndifferent moralities\nwe also know that you can do different\nkinds of\ninteresting tests on sociopaths\nthat signal that there's something\ndifferent in their brain\nmy favorite example of this\nis that people who have sociopathy\nor anti-social personality disorder\nare less likely to empathically yawn\nso i don't know if you all know this but\nif i yawn\n[Music]\neven if it's a fake yawn you'll feel\nlike yawning and you may even yawn\nbut for people with antisocial\npersonality disorder they don't actually\nyawn empathically\nso there's something different in the\nbrain\nand so if i'm kind of immoral because i\nlack empathy\nright so now everyone's like some people\nlike ion if i it was a more genuine yawn\nyou would have yawned more it was a fake\nyawn and that's the interesting thing so\nif you ask like what's the difference\nbetween a genuine yawn and a fake yawn\nit's the empathic circuitry in your\nbrain\nwhich can tell that i was fake yawning\nso it doesn't actually trigger the the\nyawn response whereas if i was genuinely\nyawning your empathic circuitry would\npick that up and you'd be more likely to\nyawn\nand when that circuitry is hampered in\nantisocial personality disorder those\npeople don't empathically on\nso there does seem to be a biological\ncomponent\nfor people who are prone to cruelty to\nanimals\nso in that sense do we call it their\nfault is this person immoral\nso that's where things get where we\nstart to see an intersection between the\npathologizing and what we would consider\ngenerally speaking immoral behavior\nso there is some connection\nso there's some connection there but i\ngenerally speaking think of those two\nthings as separate and in fact i think\nthat society too often conflates\nthose two\nanother good example of this is for a\nlong time we viewed addiction\nas a moral failing\nright like we used to think like oh you\njust like you just need to stop you just\ncan't stop et cetera et cetera et cetera\nwe think about depression is like a\nmoral failing or a weakness\nlike a lack of character\nwhereas i think those conflations kind\nof need to be separated we need to stop\nmingling morality with mental illness\nwe need to stop using mental illness as\nan excuse for immoral behavior\nand we need to stop labeling people with\nmental illness as being more immoral\nthe last thing that i this person kind\nof asks about is like\nokay so like what does it mean to be\nmentally healthy\nis that culturally dependent does that\nchange could people be mentally healthy\nhow could if if spanking a child\ntraumatizes a child and 500 years ago\nall children were spanked how were any\nof those children considered mentally\nhealthy or were they all mentally\nunhealthy and we considered that normal\nso this is we're gonna we're gonna draw\non a different kind of perspective so\nwe've talked mostly about science and\nepidemiology thus far\nthis is where we turn to spirituality\nso in the realm of spirituality we've\nhad people\nwho have consistently told us\nacross cultures and across time\nhow to be mentally healthy\nand they never talked about mental\nillness\nthey talked about things like\ncontentment\npeace\nhappiness\nthey didn't talk about an absence of\nemotional fluctuation they didn't talk\nabout never feeling afraid never feeling\nangry never feeling sad\nwhat they talked about is contentment\nversus suffering\nso i think that karmic religions\nthis is probably i'm probably biased but\ni think this is where we get most of\nthis stuff societally nowadays i'm not\nsaying that other people didn't voice\nthe same thing from judeo-christian\ntraditions but i think these these\nbeliefs have been sort of best developed\nor most popularized for whatever reason\nby sort of the karmic traditions\nso this is where like the people who\nessentially meditated\nright these are the yogis of ancient\nindia and then buddhism in east asia and\nstuff like that would the\nand then we've got like you know the zen\nschools and stuff like that and what\nthey essentially discovered\nwas how to be mentally healthy which has\nsort of nothing to do with mental\nillness\nhow to find peace and contentment\nand the formula that they posited is you\nknow developing some degree of\ndetachment vairagya\nabout separating yourself from your act\nof the outcomes of your actions\nseparating yourself from your ego\nyou know they discovered a lot of\nprinciples\nwhich they said if you follow these\nprinciples and if you meditate and if\nyou do this stuff you will be content in\nlife\nand the interesting thing is that\nthey're not this has been independently\ndiscovered as well\nso i think the best example of this that\ni can think of is viktor frankl and man\nsearch for meaning\nso this is a jew who is in a\nconcentration camp\nand essentially discovered some degree\nof like detachment\nand found peace\ndespite being in very negative\ncircumstances\nyou could also say that this was\ndiscovered in some element by ancient\nstoic philosophers from greece\nright so that suggests that this pathway\nis true because it's been investigated\nand discovered by culturally isolated\ngroups of human beings\nand so when it comes to mental health\nand finding peace and contentment and\nhappiness\ni think this is the best answer it's\nthis path that these people were talking\nabout\nwhether you call it stoic philosophy\nwhether you call it man's search for\nmeaning and victor frankl or you call it\nyoga and meditation\nand so\nthe interesting thing there is that\npeople irrespective of what culture you\ngrow up in irrespective of whether you\nwere spanked or not spanked\nand this is the key thing\nis that spiritual tradition towards\nenlightenment\nis is not actually about external\ncircumstances the key thing there is the\npath to enlightenment is not about what\nhappens in the world\nit's about how we react to it and this\nis why it transcends\nculture and time\nbecause whether you were spanked or\nwhether you were yelled at or whether\nyou know you lost a parent from smallpox\nwhatever the circumstances are\nwhat leads to peace is how you react to\nthose circumstances\nand so that's why i think that the\nspiritual path offers so much in terms\nof mental health\nit's so useful because it's not just\nabout mental\nillness\nthat mental health and being mentally\nstrong and content is more than the\ntreatment of mental illness\nand i think the best explanation of this\nhas been the spiritual path\nand now we also have to a certain amount\na certain degree is going to be somewhat\nof a\noversimplification\noversimplification we have scientific\nevidence for this as well\nso we do know that there is like it's\nkind of interesting because there's one\nintervention\nthat has been shown to be essentially\nimprove symptoms of\nall mental illnesses\nmindfulness\nmindfulness improves things in\nschizophrenia it improves things in\nanxiety and improves things with\ndepression\nit improves things with adhd\nso that's kind of interesting right\nand i think it's because the people who\nsort of developed yoga and meditation\nunderstood the fundamentals of how the\nhuman mind works\nand how to transcend all of the patterns\nof mind so whatever illness you have\nwithin the mind if we can like transcend\nall of it\nif we can move away from ego move away\nfrom identity control our thoughts\nprocess our emotions it doesn't matter\nwhether the emotion is shame from\ndepression or fear from anxiety\nit doesn't matter whether it's\nattachment to a substance\nor attachment to a promotion\nor attachment to a particular car or ego\nor whatever transcending ego gets rid of\nall of that stuff\nso part of what i've learned as a\npsychiatrist is that these two things\nare independent\nin fact all three of these things are\nindependent mental illness is one thing\ncultural manifestations may vary but\nthat mental illness tends to be somewhat\nindependent of cultural manifestations\nright it's like conserved across\nhumanity that's number one that mental\nillness and morality need to be\nseparated\nand when i draw on my experience\ntraining to become a monk\nwhat i sort of learned which is kind of\ninteresting right because i went to\nmedical school is that\nthe development of mental health\nrequires more than the treatment of\nmental loss\nthat these two things can be pursued in\nparallel or even sequentially and i see\nthe best clinical outcomes\nwhen we walk both of those paths\nconcurrently\nso it's not just about giving up the\naddiction and conquering the addiction\nit's about having a conversation about\nwhat do you want from this life\nwhat would bring you peace contentment\nand happiness and how does alcohol\naffect that\nwell i want to like have a family and i\nwant to be peaceful at home i don't want\nto be like going through couples\ncounseling all the time i want my kids\nto be proud of me i don't want to be\nashamed about myself because i'm drunk\nat their birthday party and pass out\nokay so like if that's what you want to\nbe\ncontent and happy in life let's think\nabout how alcohol impacts that\nand then there's the treatment element\nright so we can prescribe things like\nlet's say disulfiram or\nyou know like whatever medications you\ncan go to alcoholics anonymous you can\ndo psychotherapy you can do cognitive\nbehavioral therapy you can do all these\nlike treatment interventions but at the\nend of the day there's a spiritual\nelement to overcoming addictions\nwhich is something that we've understood\nfor a long time which is why alcoholics\nanonymous and things like refuge\nrecovery are very spiritually\noriented interventions\nso i think this post is really\ninteresting because it talks about the\nconnection\nor intertwinedness between morality and\nmental illness\nand mental health and mental illness\nand cultural fluctuations\nbut the interesting thing is that as we\ndig into this stuff we can actually\nresolve all of that stuff\nwe have to understand that mental health\nand peace\ncomes not from necessarily what the\nworld does to us but how we react to it\nand so whatever a particular culture\nsays doesn't matter whatever happens to\nyou in a particular culture in a sense\nquote unquote doesn't matter\nbecause it's all about how you react to\nit the stoics believe this viktor frankl\nfigured this out and the yogis have been\nsaying it for 5 000 years and we also\nhave to be careful about morality and\nmental illness\nbecause increasingly we're getting those\ntwo things conflated that people who\ncommit bad things were mentally ill that\nmay be true\nbut let's not forget that just because\nyou're mentally ill you can be a good\nperson or a bad person or even then i\ndon't think that that's really fair you\ncan commit good actions or bad actions\nyou can commit moral actions or immoral\nactions\nand the vast majority of people who\nsuffer from mental illness do not do\nimmoral things or at the scale that\nwe're talking about\nso i don't think it's fair to blame\nimmoral actions on mental illness\ni think in fact\nwhat happens is once we start blaming\nour immorality on our mental illness\nour immoral behaviors skyrocket because\nwe stop accepting responsibility and\nonce we forego personal responsibility\nfor our behaviors and start blaming them\non mental illness then there's like no\ninternal check\nyou"
