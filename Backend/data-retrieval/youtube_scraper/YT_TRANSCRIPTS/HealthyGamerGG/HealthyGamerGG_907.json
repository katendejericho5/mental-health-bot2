    "transcript": "with these five habits i actually was\nable to make a substantial change in my\nlife with kind of like a minimal effort\ninvestment so one of the things that i\nwant to talk to you all about today are\nhabits so i'm gonna share with you all\nfive habits that i've kind of\nimplemented over the last couple of\nyears that have drastically altered my\nproductivity and my wellness and success\nand all that kind of stuff i think these\nhabits may apply to you this may be\nuseful for you if you're kind of like me\nand what i actually struggled with a lot\nwas building new habits so what i sort\nof found for myself is that first of all\ni thought hat building habits was\nimportant right so i recognized that\nevery day that i'm using like willpower\nto overcome particular shortcomings of\nmine like it was a slog the second thing\nis that i'm also someone who really\nreally struggles to build habits because\ni i struggle with consistency and things\nlike that it was just really hard you\nknow i try to exercise i try to eat\nhealthy i try to do all this stuff and\nit was just like hard for me and so the\nthe habits that i want to share with you\nall today are five things that i would\ncall easy with these five habits i\nactually was able to make a substantial\nchange in my life with kind of like a\nminimal effort investment so the first\nhabit that i want to share with you all\nis\nnot using technology for like 30 to 60\nminutes when you wake up in the morning\nso for the first half hour to hour of my\nday i do my level best to not use any\nkind of technology you know we've grown\nup in such a technological society where\nwe feel like we have to use technology\nor technology is always at our\nfingertips or there's like so much value\nfrom technology and i didn't really\nrealize how little value technology\noffers until like i started really\npaying attention to things like when i\nwould go to an ashram right so i'd go to\na monastery and i'd study yoga for a\nwhile right so i'm meditating and stuff\nlike that and there's very little\ntechnology footprint then and that's\nwhen i really realized oh i actually\nlike don't need technology now it's fine\nfor me to say okay so start off your day\nwithout using technology for 30 to 60\nminutes but the truth is that's\nhard why is it hard because technology\nis addictive so instead of trying to\nchange anything i just paid attention to\nwhat happened when i started using\ntechnology so when you wake up first in\nthe morn first thing in the morning\nyou're kind of sluggish you don't really\nfeel like working but you need to work\ntoday so what i sort of noticed was that\nthe first reason that i would use\ntechnology was not out of any\nrecreational stuff it was actually like\ndue to like legitimate reasons so the\nfirst thing that i would do is like\ncheck my email or look at my calendar\nand try to figure out okay what do i\nhave to do today and that sounds like\npretty productive right you have to\nfigure out okay during the day like do i\nneed do i have an hour to shower do i\nhave half an hour to shower like what do\ni need to do today but then what i sort\nof found is as i looked at my day when i\nfirst wake up in the morning how do you\nthink that makes me feel so when you\nwake up first thing in the morning and\nyou open up your calendar and you open\nup your email and there are all these\ntasks you have to do and like you've got\nall these meetings and oh yeah i have to\ndo this today and oh i have to do this\ntoday and i don't do this today and then\ni started to feel emotionally\noverwhelmed because i'm not actually\ndoing it right all i'm seeing is like\nthe gigantic mountain that i have to\nclimb and so then once i start to feel\nemotionally overwhelmed mentally i'm not\nin a frame of mind to work so what do i\nend up doing how do i manage those\nemotions i move over to a different app\nlet's open up reddit let's look at what\nhappened on a live stream fail and so\nthen what we do is we we shift from our\nkind of like work related legitimate\nreason to kind of an emotionally numbing\ndopaminergic kind of thing and then\nyou're stuck in that cycle and then i\nhave to start the day by digging in\nusing willpower to overcome that and\nlike drag myself to start working and\nwhat i actually found is that when i\navoid technology for the first 30 to 60\nminutes of the day you know i kind of do\nmy thing i take a shower i have a cup of\ntea i'll read something i'll chat i'll\ngo outside for a little bit then when i\nsit down to work i'm in a far better\nheadspace and my my willpower battery is\nstill fully charged because i haven't\nhad to overcome the addictive technology\nfirst thing in the morning habit number\ntwo as i started cutting back on\ncaffeine or even cutting it out entirely\nso i learned this lesson in a kind of\nbizarre way so a couple years ago i got\nfood poisoning and when i got food\npoisoning you know like i couldn't eat\nanything so i certainly wasn't having\nany caffeine and what i found is like\nthree or four days after when i started\nto feel a little bit better despite the\nfact that i had been sick i was really\nsurprised by how mentally alert i was in\nthe afternoons and evenings the more i\nkind of dug into it i realized this is\nthe effect of caffeine and there are a\ncouple of important things to understand\nabout caffeine the first is that\ncaffeine doesn't actually give us energy\nthe neurobiological mechanism of\ncaffeine is that it blocks adenosine\nreceptors and so adenosine so we have\nthe the fundamental energy molecule in\nour cells is something called atp when\nwe burn an atp we're sort of left with\nadenosine and the more adenosine we have\nthat sort of that's our brain signal\nthat okay like we're tired like we've\nburnt up a lot of energy and when i go\nto sleep i'm going to clear out all that\nadenosine i'm going to remake atp and so\nthe interesting thing about caffeine is\nthat it doesn't give you energy it numbs\nthe tiredness signal so this is really\nimportant because the more that you use\ncaffeine you're actually like building\nup more fatigue more fatigue more\nfatigue you're just numbing yourself to\nthat signal so it doesn't actually give\nyou energy all it does is create more\nfatigue down the road for a temporary\nboost right now so let's try to\nunderstand what happens when we use\ncaffeine and why it's so hard to give up\nit turns out that the way that our\nbrain's reinforcement mechanisms are\nwired make it very easy to get addicted\nto caffeine so there's a really simple\nprinciple when it comes to addictions\nthe more rapid the effect of the benefit\nthe more addictive it is so the faster\nthat the benefit hits the more likely we\nare to be addicted so when we use\ncaffeine what happens is we get this\nburst of focus and i've got a bunch of\nstuff to do today so i can't afford to\nbe sluggish so i'm gonna drink caffeine\nand for a couple of hours man i can do\nanything like i'm grinding i'm doing\nthis task i'm doing that task i'm on i'm\nstreaming i'm riding whatever it is and\nthen as time goes on and as the caffeine\nwears off we get sluggish and sluggish\nand sluggish and by the time that the\nevening rolls around we're really tired\nwe really can't do anything and the more\nthat we feel like oh my god i can't do\nanything the more dependent we become\nwith caffeine so if you look at like\nyour productivity over the course of a\nday let's say it's really stable when\nyou use caffeine what it basically does\nis shifts a period into high\nproductivity followed by a period of low\nproductivity so when i use caffeine i\nfeel that burst of energy and i'm like\nwow caffeine is really amazing and then\ni crash afterward and so the more that\nmy brain sort of learns okay like i need\ncaffeine i need caffeine i need caffeine\ni'm so productive with it the more we\nstart to use it and then we kind of fall\ninto this cycle that ends up actually\nlike negatively impacting us so in terms\nof how to cut back on caffeine so i\nthink the first thing is to recognize\nonce again use understanding right so\nactually pay attention to your\nproductivity over the course of a day\nand how you kind of feel another thing\nthat you can do in terms of getting off\nof caffeine is delaying when you start\nit okay this is really important because\na lot of times we're like zombies until\nwe have caffeine so i know it's kind of\nweird but just wait half an hour do\nother stuff take a shower like you can\nstill take a shower without caffeine\nit's like not that hard and then the\nlast thing that's really really\nimportant for coming off of caffeine i\nknow it's gonna sound kind of like a\nno-brainer but getting enough sleep\ncaffeine is way harder to get rid of\nwhen you are not sufficiently rested so\nwhen i get off of caffeine now what i'll\ntry to do is plan actually a nap during\nthe day so i recognize that i'm gonna\ncrash and i'm gonna just lay down for a\nlittle while oftentimes i won't sleep\ni'll just close my eyes but it really\nhelps and then you kind of acknowledge\nthat for a three or four day period like\nit's going to be a little bit tricky but\na big part is getting enough sleep at\nnight the next habit that i want to\nshare with you all that i think is\nactually really really has\nrevolutionized my life and is so easy is\npacing so what i do now several times\nthroughout the day is get up and walk\nback and forth and i will demonstrate\nfor those of you who don't know what\npacing is this is what it looks like\ni'll get up and i'll go like this\nand people are like\nwhat the hell how is that how does that\nhelp anything i pace\nhis revolutionized my life how the hell\ndoes that help anyone great question so\nlet's understand why we pace and what it\nreplaces so when i'm working sometimes i\nget tired of work and i get distracted\nand what do we do when we get tired of\nwork and we get distracted we usually do\nsomething with a technological device so\ni'm fatigued feel distracted and then\nwhat i'm gonna do is as i engage with\nsomething let's say i open up like\nreddit or twitter or whatever i get\nbombarded with information so the first\nthing is that all of these activities\nare designed to increase engagement\nright so like when you watch one youtube\nvideo it's not like that's the only\nvideo there's a bunch of suggestions the\nsuggestions on the right for the next\nvideo there are cards at the end of the\nvideo that directing you to additional\nvideos one distraction becomes a second\ndistraction third distraction fourth\ndistraction fifth of distraction so the\nprice of opening up some kind of\ntechnological thing is like a five\nminute distraction becomes an hour long\nthe second thing is that when we engage\nin those kinds of things it tends to\nramp up our mind more so as i open up\ntwitter and i see everything that is\nwrong with the world do you think that\nthat helps me get back to work and\ngenerally speaking if you pay attention\nto the cycle what happens is once you\nlike log on to twitter we get so\nfatigued from our distraction that we\neventually get bored of it and we go\nback to work but when you're going back\nto work you're kind of exhausted and\nlike mentally so how does pacing help\npacing helps in two ways the first is\nthat it allows me to take a break from\nwork without slipping into something\nthat's gonna cost me an hour the second\nthing that's really cool about pacing is\nthat it actually decompresses my mental\nstate so when i engage with something\nsome inflammatory content on the\ninternet it activates my emotions and\nmakes it like harder for me to focus\nwhereas when i pace like i just let my\nmind kind of wander and like it kind of\nthinks through stuff and i don't know\nhow to describe it but like basically\nlike when you use the internet you get\nramped up right when you pace like you\nkind of get like decompressed you kind\nof chill out you're thinking about this\nstuff thinking about that stuff you kind\nof just like\nand eventually you can sit down and work\nagain pacing is completely op you just\nget up step away from the computer\nget the blood flowing right so improve\nyour venous return by walking back and\nforth use your muscles a little bit\nrelieve some of that back pain from\nsitting and all that kind of good stuff\nso this kind of segues into the next\nthing that i really noticed\nwhich is the next habit that i built was\ngiving myself time to think this is kind\nof interesting because i think one of\nthe things that we've lost\nas humanity is time to think so like 10\n000 years ago we had a lot of time to\nthink even if i'm a farmer working in a\nfield like i may be doing some kind of\nmonotonous activity or if i'm milking a\ncow i still have time to think so i\nthink one of the things that we really\nlike lost sight of is that the human\nbrain evolved to have like this low kind\nof like mental activity processing kind\nof state and now what happens is we get\nramped up so much by everything going on\nso much stimuli that we actually don't\nhave time to like process any of that\nstuff why can it be hard to give\nyourself time to think because you're\nnot being productive oh my god so i\nthink if we kind of think a little bit\nabout optimal productivity we have to\nrecognize that societally our brains\ndon't have time to decompress anymore\nand so now what we're sort of seeing is\nintensive decompression people are going\non meditation retreats they're going to\nsay therapists they have to squeeze in\nall of their mental decompression into a\nhighly efficient little bundle and we\nsee the value of this if you all have\never heard of shower thoughts and look\nat what your mind is like in the shower\nso many good thoughts man feels so good\nit's like invigorating so give yourself\ntime to think it will transform your\nlife one thing that kind of came out\nwhen i started giving myself time to\nthink and this is the last habit\narguably the most important is i started\nturning some consumption into production\nso increasingly what we've become as\nhumans is consumers books audiobooks\nyoutube videos twitter social media\nvideo games so i i've even heard of like\nyou know people who play games like i\nused to do this too like i would play\nwow i would grind wow and listen to an\naudiobook at the same time so i could be\nproductive while i'm playing wow makes\nsense sort of right because if i have to\ngrind this stupid crap i might as well\nlike listen to a good book like listen\nto stephen hawking and learn something\nso like what the hell is going on here\nso we've become consumers we think that\nconsumption is like laudable right so if\ni read one book every day and i read 300\nbooks a week and i read this many many\nbooks and i listen to this podcast and\ndo this and do this like this is a badge\nof honor and what i realized i was just\nconsuming consuming consuming and that\nif i really want to be like be\nsuccessful\nwhat i need to do is not consume like\nsure reading can be helpful don't get me\nwrong what i mean is if i want to\ndeliver value to the world if i want to\noffer value as a human being that\ndoesn't come through consumption it\ncomes through production so i started\ncreating stuff so in my case i did a lot\nof writing now here's the problem with\nbecoming a producer so as you start\nproducing\nall kinds of problems arise\nand the number one problem that arises\nfrom being a producer\nis wanting to make a product we've\nassociated writing\nwith publishing so like there's no point\nin writing unless you become an author\nthere's no point in making music unless\nyou're going to become an artist so what\nwe've started to do is we've tangled\ntogether the creative process with the\ncreation once you tangle these two\nthings together it makes things so\ndifficult because if my goal is to write\na book then the second i start writing i\nget into problems with perfectionism is\nit good enough is it not good enough\nstrategically am i doing this do i need\nto find a publisher are people gonna\nlike it are they not gonna like it and\nthen you get into writer's block you get\nparalyzed it's not good enough i need to\nprepare more i need to go do this\nworkshop i need to learn more about this\nbecause the goal is to publish something\nthe goal is to be successful the habit\nthat i learned\nwas just to become a producer\ninstead of a consumer to date i've never\npublished a book have i written books\n100 haven't published one don't care but\nthe key thing is to stop being a passive\nconsumer and to recognize that once you\nengage in that productive process you\nwill like shed a lot of the problems\nthat we face right now you're just\ncreating stuff so shift from consumption\nto production why is that hard because\nwe assume production with the finished\nproduct we want to be successful there's\nno point in writing a book that no one\nelse will read i completely disagree i'm\nnot saying that you stop consumption i'd\nsay somewhere around 10 to 20 percent of\nyour consumption time should be turned\ninto production so\nif you're like me and you think habits\nare important but you struggle to\nactually implement them then i'd start\nwith these five habits number one avoid\ntechnology usage for the first 30 to 60\nminutes of the day number two cut back\non your caffeine it's a scam number\nthree pace literally just walk back and\nforth easiest thing in the world in the\nworld to do leading from pacing is to\ngive yourself time to think and as you\ngive yourself time to think\nput that thought into the world in some\nway start to become a producer instead\nof a consumer so those are the five\nhabits i'd recommend you all start with\nyou"
