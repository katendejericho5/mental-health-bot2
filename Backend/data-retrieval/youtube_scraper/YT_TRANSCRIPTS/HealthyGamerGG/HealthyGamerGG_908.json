    "transcript": "so what's going on here\nhow do we know\nwhat someone with depression is\nresponsible for and what they aren't\nresponsible for\nso am i the [ __ ] for telling my\nhusband i'm sick of his depression\nruining our lives i 26 f and my husband\n28 m have been together for eight years\nwe love each other deeply and i'm still\nmadly in love with him both of us have\nstruggled with depression our whole\nlives i would never judge him for\nsomething like that\nmy problem is this he does not in any\nway try to treat his depression so he\nkeeps going through a cycle of\nself-sabotage he cannot hold a job since\nthe beginning he's had a pattern of\ngetting a job doing extremely well for a\nwhile feeling good and happy then it\nalways falls apart\nhe calls out one time then it spirals\nsuddenly he's calling out or showing up\nlate three plus times a week then\nsometimes daily until his bosses have to\nlet him go\nevery time i go into a panic mode\nworking overtime at two to three jobs\nand taking out loans to keep us afloat\nwhile he drags his feet to find another\njob\nthen he finds one and the cycle starts\nall over he does great we catch up on\nbills i feel like i can breathe it all\nfalls apart again each time he gets\nfired i tell him that it's going to be\nokay and that i will support him the\nlast time he was jobless i was working\ntwo full-time jobs and had to sell my\ncar to pay rent in his car payment\ni was devastated but i never cried in\nfront of him that was\na year and a half ago then he got a\ngreat job he started kicking ass as\nusual and i loved it\na year and i felt a bit of relief i\nthought this one would stick and i could\nsee the light at the end of the tunnel\nthen three months ago the cycle started\nover he went from being a wonderful\nemployee to calling out twice a week\nshowing up late daily and barely\nshowering once every 10 days\none day he decided not to go into work\n20 minutes before he was supposed to be\nthere i got a horrible gut feeling and\npleaded with him to please not lose this\njob\nthat things were better but we were\nstill on shaky financial ground and that\ni needed help\nhe shrugged it off told me that his\nbosses loved him and would never fire\nhim and texted that he wouldn't be in\nsure enough he was fired i lost it i\nstarted sobbing and yelled that i could\ncount on one hand the number of days i\nhad had off in all our time together\nthat i couldn't believe he had done this\nagain he said that it was my own fault\nfor never taking days off and that my\ndepression isn't as bad as his so i\nwouldn't understand\ni told him that i couldn't take any days\noff because one of us has to make sure\nwe don't end up homeless\ni scream sobbed about the pressure i was\nunder to always be the stable one and to\nnever acknowledge my own struggles he\nsaid i was acting like his mental\nillness was his fault\ni said that the depression is not his\nfault but the fact that he doesn't treat\nslash manage it is\nthat i love him but i'm so sick of his\ndepression ruining our lives i said i\nhave nothing left to sell and there was\nno way i could get another loan so\nwithout his income we're going to lose\nour apartment\nhe told me that fo\nwhich i assume means screw off with with\nmy blaming verbal abuse and stormed out\nnow he won't answer my texts or calls i\nneed to know\nam i the [ __ ]\nso\nsometimes we look at posts like this on\nthe internet\nand when we look at posts like this on\nthe internet\nit's very easy\nto say oh my god\nyou're not an [ __ ] you should dump\nhim you should move on\nyou know like you're totally within your\nrights\nfor eight years\nyou've been supporting someone with\ndepression\nand then the challenge\nis that like when you're in a\nrelationship with someone with\ndepression like you don't\nwant to be mean right you don't you want\nto be compassionate\nyou want to have understanding that like\nthis isn't their fault like having the\ndepression isn't their fault\nand then like if you try to like point\nit out to them if you if you kind of\nlike\ntry to get your partner to take\naccountability for the depression\nit's verbal abuse\nit's like you don't understand how bad i\nhave it easy for you to say\nright so like it's kind of weird because\ndepression can almost become\nlike an invincibility potion\nagainst criticism from someone in your\nrelationship\nand if you break up with this person and\nyou move on right so like you're sharing\nyour side of things with the internet\nwhere who knows what the actual truth is\nright you're looking for like validation\nfrom a bunch of strangers\nand so you like it's your perspective on\nthings\nand then if you actually break up with\nthis person\nyou know they go to social media they\nthey share their side of things oh like\nmy partner like i've been struggling\nwith depression for a while and my\npartner dumped me because of my\ndepression\nbecause you want to be like you want to\nbe a good partner right it's like\nespecially if you're married it's\npresumably death till death do you part\nand you don't want to give up on your\npartner it's not their fault that\nthey're depressed\nand yet you're at the end of your road\nso what's going on here\nhow do we know what someone with\ndepression is responsible for and what\nthey aren't responsible for\nright like how do we know like when is\nit compassionate and when does it mean\nhow like how much patience should i have\nhow many second chances should i give\nthis person because the thing about\ndepression is like it gets in the way of\npeople taking care of themselves\nright so it's like how do i know if\nthey're not doing something is it like\nis it lazy or is it depression\nand the tricky thing is that if it's\ndepression are they ever lazy\nlike is it possible for someone to be\nboth depressed and lazy and how do you\ntell the difference\nso it's really challenging to be in a\nrelationship with depression with\nsomeone with depression and what i'd\nlove to do is lay out a couple of basic\nprinciples actually share with y'all\nsome potentially mind-blowing insights\nabout the correlation between lazy and\ndepression\nbecause one interesting that thing\nthat's happened\nis that as people become more aware of\nmental health issues mental illness\nissues we've actually as a society\nbecome more understanding\nand as we've become more understanding\nit's had some interesting effects and so\nwe're gonna look at some really\ninteresting research about laziness and\ndepression and then we're also going to\ntry to frame things for y'all in terms\nof like a couple of tips about how to\nhave conversations and how to think\nabout this if you're in this kind of\nrelationship\nso the first thing that we're going to\ntalk about\nis psychogenic seizures\nlet me see if i can\ntake a look at this\nso\nsometimes people have a diagnosis of\nsomething called epilepsy okay\nepilepsy is like a seizure disorder so\nyou have this abnormal electrical\nactivity in your brain\nand\num\nit basically causes a seizure\nso we also know that there's something\ncalled psychogenic non-epileptic\nseizures\nso what this means is like basically\nfake seizures it's someone who pretends\nto have a seizure oh my god i'm seizing\nand it's not a real epilepsy but like\nit looks like a seizure to some people\nthey kind of act like they have a\nseizure\nand so this paper is looking at the\nincidence which is how common\ndo how commonly do people get\npsychogenic non-epileptic seizures so\nthis paper looks at the incidence and\nit's three out of a hundred thousand\nso if i take a group of a hundred\nthousand people\nthree of them will develop psychogenic\nnon-epileptic seizures essentially what\nwe call kind of you can think about as\nfake seizures\nright\nbut\nthere's a really interesting finding\nso three out of a hundred thousand isn't\nvery much\nvery rare\nbut\n25 to 40 percent\nof people who have psychogenic seizures\nalso have real seizures\nwhich is kind of interesting right\nthat's bizarre three out of a hundred\nthousand in the regular population\nbut\nvery very high core comorbidity with\nreal seizures\nso what's going on here\none of the really interesting things is\nthat when someone has seizures\nthey subconsciously discover a couple of\nreally important things\nthey discover that if i have a seizure i\nget excused from stuff\noh i didn't do my project\nif i have a seizure i can get more time\ni don't feel like going to a party if i\nhave a seizure\nnot my fault i'm applying to college and\ni'm afraid that i'm not going to get\ninto a good college if my seizures get\nbad then i have an excuse\nwhy i did not get accepted to the best\ncollege in the country because my\nseizures got in the way\nso it's kind of like a devastating thing\nto think about right so like here i am\ni'm saying oh my god like oh\nis is what i'm saying cruel is it\nunusual this is a fact\nthat people who have real medical\nillnesses\nwill subconsciously learn how to use\nthose illnesses to meet certain\npsychological needs and get excused from\nresponsibilities now i'm not saying that\neveryone with seizures does this right\nso this is like somewhere between a\nfourth to half of people who have\npsychogenic seizures will also have real\nepilepsy\nand it turns out there's literature on\nthis so then the question is can that be\ntrue of depression can someone who has\nreal depression\nfake their depression\nto get excused from stuff\nlike paying bills and going to work\nand it turns out\nthat the answer is yes\nso this is an area of research which is\ngrowing but we actually don't have\nreally good numbers\nbut what we know is that sometimes\nwhoever people have real psychiatric\nillness will also fake\npsychiatric illness\nand it turns out that there are a couple\nof interesting hypotheses for this\nso\nthis is where i'm just going to read\nthis out a little bit okay malingering\nis an adaptive\nresponse this model proposes that\nmalingering represents an adaptation to\nhostile circumstances\naccording to this model there are two\nbroad dimensions of lingering\nmalingering cost benefit analysis and\nadversarial setting\nmalingers perceive the environment in\nadversarial or risky terms and\nmalingering is seen as a behavior which\nmaximizes the chance of success in such\na situation\nnow malingering is a slightly different\ndiagnosis for a couple of different\nreasons but\nthe key thing here is that we actually\nhave\nyou know some interesting papers\nabout how people when they're faced in\nadversarial situations i.e\nmy partner is yelling at me\nbecause i'm not doing what i'm supposed\nto be doing\nwhat's the cost benefit analysis how do\ni maximize the situation like how do i\ngo eight years in a marriage without\ntaking responsibility for my mental\nhealth\ni cite my depression\nso this is what's so like tricky about\nthis kind of thing because\nare they faking it\nwell the answer is possibly sometimes 20\nto 40 percent of people with psychogenic\nseizures also have real epilepsy i'm not\nsaying that everyone with depression\ndoes this kind of thing\nbut we do know that some people actually\ndo do it right and this is where as a\npsychiatrist it's a real struggle for me\ntoo\nlike how do i know when when a patient\njust doesn't show up for their\nappointment\nhow do i know whether it's\ndepression\nor like they're just feeling lazy that\nday and even the person we have to\nassume for we have to remember for a\nmoment that a lot of this is\nsubconscious so the person themselves\nmay not know\nso the tricky thing is that when you\nhave a diagnosis\nthat gives you excuses in life\nit's very very easy as a human being to\nstart\nleveraging that excuse\nand this is what's so frustrating about\nbeing in a relationship with a person\nlike this\nis that like you're trying to be\ncompassionate\nbut in the back of your mind you sense\nthe bs\nyou're like this isn't always depression\nthere is actually like more you can be\ndoing but you're not doing that\nand the problem is that if you hold\npeople responsible to that that's when\nthey come back with like oh you're\nverbally abusing me you don't understand\nhow bad my depression is etcetera\netcetera etcetera\nright they play their trump cards which\nis that like you are not sensitive to\npeople with mental illness\nit's devastating and what do you do in\nthat situation\nso let's try to understand how to\napproach this okay\nthe first is that i'm a big believer of\nthis statement that mental illness is\nnot your fault but it is your\nresponsibility\nso the way that i kind of think about\nthis in terms of whether i quote quote\nblame someone or not right so this is a\nvery individual approach but here's a\nkind of general rule of thumb is not how\nyou behave when you're depressed\nit's how you behave when you're not\ndepressed this is what i hold people\naccountable for\nright so if someone is depressed and\nthey miss an appointment that's okay\nbut if they're missing appointments like\nonce they start to get better\nthat's actually on them that's not an\nexcuse for depression\nso this is where a lot of people who\nstruggle with depression they'll have\nepisodes right they'll come in and out\nof it the real question is how seriously\ndo they take it when they're not\ndepressed\nso if i struggle if i've lost five jobs\nbecause of my depression\nand then i start to feel better\ni need to be in therapy\ni need to connect with a psychiatrist\neven if i'm feeling better because i\nneed to protect against the next episode\nand this is what's actually so\ndevastating is that a lot of people who\nare depressed\nor suffer from you know a depressive\ndisorder\nbasically have like the hope based\nstrategy so this is what i call\nthis the hope strategy\nwhich is when you ask them like okay\nlike\nwhat's gonna happen a year from now two\nyears from now three years from now like\nwhat's your strategy to deal with the\ndepression\nand what it comes down to is like\nbasically i hope it'll be okay\nlike we heard it from this person where\nlike the you know the\npartner expresses concern hey maybe your\nbosses are gonna fire you oh no they\nlove me i hope it'll be okay\ni'm not gonna do anything actively about\nit\ni'm just gonna hope for the best\nif you've lost five jobs well like i\njust hope it'll stick next time like\ni'll figure it out eventually\nright it's just like there's not a\nconcrete strategy it's just like hoping\nthat things go away and fix themselves\nand so if you're someone who's in a\nrelationship with someone who's\ndepressed or you yourself adopt this\nattitude which is by the way it's sort\nof not your fault right because when you\nstruggle with depression\nyou\nthe hope is what sustains you does that\nkind of make sense\nlike when you're struggling with\ndepression what you start to do is start\nto like develop this idea that okay like\ntomorrow a better tomorrow will come a\nbetter tomorrow will come a better\ntomorrow will come a better tomorrow\nwill come and that's what sustains you\nthrough the dark times and then the\nbetter tomorrow comes and that sort of\nbecomes the whole of your strategy\nso this too what we have to understand\nabout these adaptations right is we're\nnot trying to blame the person or even\nthe hope-based strategy there's a reason\nwhy people have those strategies\nand also just because they have a good\nreason for this adaptation does not mean\nthat it can't become maladaptive\nand this is what we tend to see in in\nrelationships like this\nso if you're in a relationship with\nsomeone like this you start to\ndo the heavy lifting\nas an adaptation\nto survive\nright oh my my partner lost their job\ni'm gonna work two times two full-time\njobs because i have to adapt to my\ncircumstances\nand over time that becomes a\nmaladaptation because the more lifting\nthat you do\nthe less lifting they have to do\nso then like\nwhen they start working again are you\nquitting your other job or do they just\nstart to rely on you more and more and\nmore like what's going on here\nright so you can do all of the right\nthings in the moment and still end up in\nthe wrong place\nand if you're having a trouble with with\nsomeone who's if you're dating someone\nwho's suffers from depression i think\nyou should absolutely be compassionate\nand you should absolutely be\nunderstanding i think you should\nabsolutely try to do the heavy lifting\nwhen their times are down\nand also\nthey should be responsible for what\ncomes tomorrow\nthey should do everything within their\npower whether they're feeling good or\nnot feeling good to prevent the next\ndepressive episode\nand so that's where the real emphasis is\nit's not like what you get do whatever\nyou need to to survive today but once\nthings start getting moving in the right\ndirection what amount of commitment is\nyour partner willing to make or if you\nare in that situation what amount of\ncommitment are you willing to make to\nnever put your partner in that situation\nagain\nthat's the key thing\nbecause hoping that you never get\ndepressed and oh this time it'll be\ndifferent like why\nwhat makes you think that and what you\nrealize is it's just a hope there's\nnothing it's not there's nothing to it\nso last thing that we're going to kind\nof do is talk a little bit about how to\nhave conversations with your partner who\nsuffers from depression\nso this is where i think there are a\ncouple of simple questions right which\nis like starting off with trying to\nunderstand what's your understanding of\ndepression\nand what you want to try to do is\ndevelop sort of like an expectation of\nwhat's going to happen and what we're\ngoing to do if particular things happen\nso we want to go through sort of like a\nset of contingencies\nso if you're feeling better when you're\nfeeling better like are you planning on\nengaging in treatment\nyes or no\nif yes why if no why help me understand\nwhat is the role of treatment in\ndepression\nand if you don't engage in treatment\nwhat do you think is going to happen\nand if that happens or if something else\nhappens then how are you going to adjust\nand if you don't engage in treatment\nwhat are you expecting from me\nwhat are you signing me up for if you\ndon't go to treatment and this is where\nthey may use the hope-based strategy i'm\nnot signing you up for anything because\ni'm going to conquer it this time it's\nnot going to happen again i would never\nput you through that\nwhat is your plan in terms of making\nsure that that happens willpower\ni'm just so sure\nright so you want to have these\nopen-ended conversations about\nexpectations what do they think is going\nto happen you're not going to tell them\nto do something or talk tell them to do\nsomething else right you can we'll get\nto that point in a second\nand that's when you start to establish\nyour boundaries\nright and you can say like i i see where\nyou're coming from but\nis someone in chat is athena almighty\nsaid this time\nwe've been through this rodeo before and\nyou haven't gotten treatment\ni can't continue to do this what are you\nexpecting me to do when you get\ndepressed again it's happened five times\nalready\nwhat are you expecting of me\nwhat does this mean for the number of\ndays off that i have\nover the next year\nwhat does this mean about our finances\nlike i'm trying to plan and build a life\nwith you and i need help answering these\nquestions because i can't answer them on\nmy own\nwhen you have conversations like this\npeople may feel attacked\nthey may feel like you're verbally\nabusing them which and if we look at\nthis post it sort of sounds like this\nperson was quite emotional right so\nthat's why like you need to emotionally\nprocess before you sit down and have\nthis conversation\nthe good news is that if you kind of\nkeep chill and you sort of process some\nof your emotions and you really approach\nit problem solving they may still play\ntheir adaptive defensive cards this\nconversation is making me depressed\nokay i understand that i'm sorry it's\nmaking you feel that way\ni still don't know how to plan a life\nwith you without having this\nconversation\nwhat would you recommend instead\nso you want to be solution focused\nnot blame focused\nit's like okay if this doesn't work for\nyou like how do we plan\nright and it's actually like really\ndevastating to have these conversations\nwith someone who's depressed\nbecause when you don't blame them\nand you're trying to move forward\nthey kind of don't have a safety blanket\nbecause if you get angry with them if\nyou start blaming them then they can\nplay all their defensive cards oh no you\ndon't understand how bad i have it oh no\nthat's fine you just tell me how bad you\nhave it like i'm not i'm not blaming you\nthat's why i'm trying to figure out like\nhow do i plan a future with someone who\nis this depressed and that's makes them\nfeel more depressed because it's like oh\nmy god this person like my partner can't\nlike i love them but they can't plan a\nfuture with me and that's where like\nokay so like if you feel that way like\nlet me know\ndoes that make sense\nthis is another thing we have to be\nreally careful about is that sometimes\ni'll see this people are talking about\nthis which is like\nhow do i keep my partner from not being\nsuicidal how do i share any kind of\nfeedback with them and them like\nbecoming suicidal so if you're in a\nrelationship with someone i want you all\nto understand something\nsuicidality do you influence it sure\nbut suicidality can sometimes be used as\na form of emotional manipulation\nright it's like a trump card to avoid\nparticular topics oh this is making me\nsuicidal i guess we can never talk about\nit again\nso that's where like sometimes\nespecially we'll see this sometimes in\nlike romantic relationships and stuff\nwhere people like threaten suicide like\nif you break up with me i'm gonna kill\nmyself and then what happens something\nvery subtle happens is that\nif you're in a relationship with someone\nwho uses\nsuicidal blackmail\nto keep you in the relationship you feel\nresponsible for their behavior\nyou become responsible for their\nbehavior they say hey the responsibility\nfor my mental health is now controlled\nby your actions\ni wipe myself of all responsibility for\nmy own mental health and it's now on you\ntake it\nand then what we do because we're\nterrified by suicide we're like okay\nokay i'll take it i'll protect you i'll\nnever break up with you i'll be here for\nyou always and then the other person\nsubconscious is like well [ __ ] this\nworks great\ni can't do the dishes today it'll make\nme suicidal\nand so it's tricky but i think that it's\nvery important to remember that\nsuicidality is really the responsibility\nof the person\nand also of their treatment team\nright if your partner is suicidal like\nthat's not something you can fix\nand even if you're a mental health\nprofessional like that's not something\nyou're supposed to fix\nit's conflict of interest\nbut this is what's so difficult about\nbeing with someone who sometimes\nstruggles with depression and if you're\nsomeone who struggles with depression\nyou see these kinds of patterns i get\nthat it's hard like i'm not in a sense\nblaming you for this but i think that\nyou have to accept some degree of\nresponsibility because if you're if you\nhave no degree of responsibility you\nhave no degree of power then you can't\nactually fix it\nand this is what's actually so\ndevastating about it\nis by absolving ourselves from of\nresponsibility we also remove the power\nfrom our own hands\nso even if i like queue up for a video\ngame and i say\ni can't do anything to win this game it\nall depends on my teammates i'm just\ngonna afk and hope that i win\nyou may win some you may lose some even\nif you exert no effort but by giving up\nyour own power in that situation you're\nactually like\nyou're absolving yourself of\nresponsibility and removing your own\npower\nand that's where i think in in this kind\nof relationship what the person needs to\ndo is start accepting responsibility for\ntheir mental illness\nit's not fair it's not my fault but it\nis my responsibility\nand practically what that oftentimes\nmeans is engaging in a very very strong\ntreatment plan\nnot only when you're depressed but also\nwhen you're feeling well\nbecause here's the thing when you're\nfeeling well for a while something\ntips you\noff right\nsomething like triggers the depression\nthere's some amount of emotional\nsuppression or work related stress or\nsomething else\neven physical illness\nthat will trigger the whole cycle again\nand so you need to be well ensconced in\ntreatment when those kinds of challenges\narise so that they don't knock you\ncompletely off your game\nso just to summarize it's really hard to\nbe in a relationship with someone who\nstruggles with mental illness\nthe tricky thing is that sometimes\npeople who struggle with mental illness\nwill also use it as an excuse\nto absolve themselves of responsibility\nand then the tricky thing is that we're\nstuck with this very very like\ncareful balance of how do i be a\nsupportive partner and not be mean and\nlack compassion for someone who\nstruggles with mental illness versus\nhow do i get this person to take\nresponsibility for their mental illness\nbecause i can't carry for both of us\ni've been carrying this relationship for\neight years\ni can't do it on my own anymore\nand then the really challenging thing is\nthat even if you try to talk to your\npartner about it\neven broaching the subject\ncan result in allegations of verbal\nabuse and a lack of support and it's not\nmy fault and you're blaming me and like\nall this kind of stuff and then you feel\nbad\nright because you feel guilty for\nthinking these things in the first place\nand then they say it to your face and\nthen you kind of feel hurt and then\nyou're never going to bring it up again\nand the cycle perpetuates\nso what do you do about this\nconversation conversation conversation\ntalk to them\ntry to get a shared\nforward thinking approach okay what are\nwe gonna do about this\nit's not your depression it's not my\ndepression it's our depression\nwhat what are my contributions and what\nare your contributions\ni need to understand what to expect from\nyou\ni need to figure out what to expect from\nmyself\nwhat amount of responsibility are you\ngoing to take and what amount of\nresponsibility am i going to take\nit's not about blame\nit's not about you're not taking enough\nor you're not doing enough that'll\ntrigger the defensive response\nright and the key thing to remember is\nthat if you're in a relationship with\nsomeone you love them i know the\ninternet is almost certainly going to\ntell everyone to dump this person but if\nyou're in love with someone then like\nyou need to help them build a\nrelationship that is worth being in\nthat's the goal right how do you make\nthis work because people in this\nsituation want to make it work the thing\nis you just can't make it work on your\nown you need their help\nand that involves a conversation\nso talk about expectations\ntalk about long-term plans talk about\nstrategies and contingencies like what\nare we gonna do if this happens we're\ngonna do if this happens what are we\ngonna do if this happens what can you\nexpect from me what can you not expect\nfrom me what can i expect from you what\ncan i not expect from you and if things\ndon't go as you hope\nwhat do you need to do to fix it\nand this is what's really important\nwhen they're well when you guys lay out\nthis plan if they make excuses\nthen you're in trouble\nif they don't hold themselves to the if\nif you don't hold them accountable and\nthey don't hold themselves accountable\nthen the relationship is going to be in\nreal trouble\nand that's something that you need\neverybody needs to be crystal clear\nabout\nso it's tough\nbut i think one of the most devastating\nthings that we can do in a relationship\nwith someone who struggles with mental\nillness\nis assume that they're incapable\nit's devastating\njust like this is what we're saying\nright we're saying all along that just\nbecause you're mentally ill or you have\na mental illness doesn't mean that\nyou're less of a human doesn't mean that\nyou can't be successful doesn't mean\nthat you can't have a fulfilling life\nthere's all this positivity towards\nmental illness what that also [ __ ]\nmeans is that all just because you have\na mental illness doesn't mean that you\ncan't accept responsibility that you\ncan't make change\nright if we're saying that mental\nillness does not make you a crippled\nperson\nand horribly disabled that also means\nthat you need to grow up and accept\nresponsibility\nis it challenging absolutely are we here\nto help absolutely\nbut it's going to require\nthe person who struggles with\ndepression's help too\nquestions\ngreat questions so i i love these so how\ndoes someone take responsibility on\nsomething like that like i said i think\nfor for people who struggle with\ndepression the real responsibility comes\nwhen you're well\nit's not about when you're sick it's\nabout when you're well\nwhat do you do when you're well do you\ncontinue therapy do you start building\nhealthy coping habits\nright because it's really hard to like\nstart meditating when you're struggling\nwith crippling depression\nbut are you going to learn how to\nmeditate while you're feeling well are\nyou going to continue to engage in\ntherapy and learn like stress coping\nskills are you going to work on your\ndeep set issues of shame and stuff like\nthat there's like kind of acute therapy\nright psychotherapy for depression when\npeople are like really really struggling\nand then like there's a second phase of\npsychotherapy for depression\nwhich is like digging in and getting to\nthe root of it there's like putting out\nfires and there's rebuilding\nso what taking responsibility is is\nrecognizing that when your town is\nburning down it's really hard to do\nrebuilding at the same time\nbut once the fires are out it's time to\nrebuild\nthat's where i really think that people\nneed to take more responsibility or the\nones who do well i should say are the\nones who take responsibility during the\ngood times\nso that's kind of where responsibility\nstarts\nand how do i know how much power and\ncontrol i actually have over my life so\nthis is really simple to understand\nit's simple i guess it's hard to\nunderstand\nthe power and control that you have is\nfundamentally only over one thing which\nis your actions\nyou can't control what happens you just\ncontrol what you do\nso in the case of this depression it's\nvery simple what i control is whether i\ngo to therapy or not\ni don't control whether therapy prevents\nme from becoming depressed again i don't\ncontrol whether i make a breakthrough in\ntherapy or not i don't control what i\ncontrol is whether i make an appointment\nwith a psychiatrist and whether i go i\ndon't control whether the medication\nthey prescribe works like a miracle or\ndoesn't work at all i can't control my\nown treatment resistance or my own\nbiology\nbut i can control whether i try or not\nand the trickiest thing about this is\nthat\nsince we're so outcome oriented\nour mind tricks us\ninto complacency\nour mind starts to tell us\nthis won't work\nso don't waste your time\nmedication won't help me\nit hasn't worked in the past there's no\npoint in seeing a doctor\ntherein\nlies the problem\nbecause sometimes what your mind does\nis keeps you from trying because it\ntells you of a particular outcome and\nthat's why what we try to do is\nencourage moving away from outcomes and\nfocusing on actions\nand it's hard like it's very hard\nbecause it's not the way that our brains\nare designed and even i struggle with it\nbut really all you control in life is\nyour actions\nnot what happens\nso if you're struggling with depression\nyou don't control whether you get\ndepressed or not all you control is do\nyou go to treatment do you take your\nmedication do you exercise do you eat\nhealthy do you you know shower every day\ndo you clean your room those are all the\nthings that you can only your actions\nand be careful about that little voice\nin your head that says\ndon't bother because it won't work\nbecause i don't know if you know this\nbut you certainly can't see the future\nand like if you're listening to that\nvoice how's it going for you\nis it working out when you listen to\nthat voice are you happy with your life\nwhen you listen to that voice because\nthe voice says don't bother\nsave yourself the hassle and the more\nyou listen to that voice what does your\nlife become\nlook at the outcomes of listening to\nthat voice it's trying to save you from\npain and creating a life of it\ngood question\nso someone saying\nis it true that smarter people are more\nprone to mental illness i don't think so\ni do find that\nsometimes\niq can make things harder in some ways\nlike it's not a straight advantage\ngenerally speaking it's an advantage but\nlike i've worked with people who have\nanxiety where\nthe number of calculations their brain\nis able to perform\nallows them to come up with more\ndoomsday scenarios\nwhich can be like devastating\nthis is a great question\nhow do you rationalize the bs happening\nin the world\nstart by understanding that\nthe bs happening in the world is a\njudgment that's created by your mind\nthe bs happening in the world is a\nrationalization that's already created\nby you\nright like so people talk about how the\nworld is going to hell\nlike oh my god everything is so bad and\nthere are a lot of things to be worried\nabout don't get me wrong\nthere's a lot of stuff that we need to\nbe careful about\nbut\nmost of the world is just proceeding\nlike it always has\nright like if i\ntransplanted a random consciousness into\nthis world\nfor an hour\nand just walked around outside\nit's not like everything is falling\napart\nso the first step in rationalizing\nwhat the bs happening in the world is to\nrecognize that the the bs is a judgment\nfrom here so start by actually looking\nat your own thought process and how you\nconclude what i don't even know what the\nbs is\nright\nwe have a\nis\nmathematical as oh sorry is cousin beer\nsaying there's a biased perception of\nreality all of us have a bias perception\nof reality so if you want to really\nunderstand what's going on and why bs is\nhappening you have to start with your\nown thought process\nin fact i think one of the biggest\nproblems\nis that a lot of the leadership in the\nworld today is not critical of their own\nthought process\nthey look at the world and they see all\nthis catastrophe happening and they\nstart making laws and policies and\nthings like that based on their\nperception of what's going on whereas\nthey're not critical about their own\nthought process\nas we start to enter echo chambers and\nstart stop listening to like contrary\nopinions\nthe world becomes a worse and worse\nplace and the more extreme i have to\nbecome to balance it\nso i mean i'm not saying everything is\ngreat right there are a lot of problems\nthat we do need to fix but a lot of\nstuff has gotten better\nlike it's pretty cool that i'm you know\ni'm on the internet and i'm talking to\npeople\nis it that thoughts are more important\nthan actions or actions are more\nimportant than thinking\nso thoughts and actions go hand in hand\nso if you want to control your actions\nyou can really start by controlling your\nthoughts this is what a big part of dr\nk's guide to adhd and doing stuff\nis about\nis the acknowledgement like let's start\nby like where does action come from\nright like ask yourself like how do you\nact\nwhether you play a video game today or\nyou work out today like where does that\naction come from\nall right so like\nso\nthis is what i love about yoga and this\nis what what i fell in love with when i\nwanted to become a monk\nbecause there's a group of people who\nwho like figured out some very\nfundamental stuff like how do human\nbeings act\nwhat is the relationship between thought\nand action\nit's not one-to-one\nright because i think about a lot of\nthings it's not like i do them\nand then also where do thoughts come\nfrom\nand we kind of know this sort of but we\nnever sit down and really internalize it\nright so we know that for example going\nto a bar every night\nversus going to an alcoholics anonymous\nmeeting every night in one of those\nsituations it's easier to drink and in\none of them it's harder to drink\nwe kind of know that but we don't take\nthat fundamental principle\nunderstand the underlying equation and\napply it to every other dimension of our\nlife"
