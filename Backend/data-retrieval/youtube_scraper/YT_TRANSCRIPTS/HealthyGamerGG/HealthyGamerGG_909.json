    "transcript": "it's about really understanding like\nwhat's the equation basically general\nconclusion having worked with over 400\ncontent creators now is that the best\nway to make content is to be like\nauthentic and energetic do you want me\nmute do you guys want to finish your\nconversation privately\ni mean i could go on stream it's cool\nokay it's on\nyeah i know it's fine\nokay awesome\nkeep going sorry\num oh i just wanted to thank you because\nwhile i was stupid kovid i was lurking\nin her stream and it really helped me\nlike\nfocus on not being sick\nwith the the cool asmr sounds and\nespecially the singing bulls that was my\nfavorite\nare you feeling better now\nuh a lot better today but i've had days\nlike you know two days ago where i felt\nlike absolute garbage because\ni don't know this covet was off and on i\nhaven't this is my first time having it\nand i got it from my parents of all\nplaces i didn't get it from like\nsomething cool\nso\noh i'm glad you're feeling better and i\nhope you don't end up with any like\nlong covered stuff or thank you yeah\ncool hi\nhow's everybody doing today\nbetter\nit sounds like\nmetric got covered\ni actually had covid when we did our our\nfirst session but i just\num doped myself up real good and\npretended like nothing was wrong ah\nso\na crucial skill for a content creator\npretending like nothing is wrong\noh yeah and just performing\nright so welcome everyone to week two i\ni think hopefully we'll have miss\nashrock's able to make it uh but if she\ncan't you know that's okay we're welcome\nwe're happy to have her whenever she's\nis going to be here\num so just to give you all a little bit\nof structure i don't know how many of\ny'all saw the recap that we that i kind\nof shared with you all a couple days ago\nso we'll be sort of sharing recaps with\ny'all um hopefully on a weekly basis\nthere may sometimes they may even be a\nlittle bit more substantive\nin terms of like worksheets and tools\nand things like that but we'll kind of\nget to that later like burnout\nassessments and stuff like that\nscientifically valid scales things like\nthat\nbut i thought i'd just uh first of all\nwelcome everyone back\ni think we can go ahead and do brief\nintroductions as well again this week so\nplease let everyone know where they can\nfind you\num you know what kind of work that you\ndo\nand then the other thing that i'd like\nto do is just kind of go over a format\nof what we do on a weekly basis so what\ni'll do is we'll start with check-ins\nthere may be announcements or things\nlike that at the very beginning as well\nand then probably what we'll do during\ncheck-ins i may frame them in a\nparticular way we won't do that today\nbecause we're going to do introductions\nbut and then afterward i'll put like a\nquestion to people\noftentimes relating to okay what did\ny'all take away from last week so what\ndid y'all remember for people who did\nhomework um you know what was that\nexperience like so we'll kind of check\nin about last week if people have\nthoughts reflections kind of recaps\num we'll sort of talk about that for a\nlittle bit and then we'll kind of open\nthings up based on\nwhat the check-in is like in people's\nresponses does that make sense\ni did share with you all the eight\ntopics that i've pre-prepared\nso if people want to steer in that\ndirection y'all can explicitly open that\ndoor you can say hey this really\nresonated with me\nbut based on my understanding\nyou know there were a couple of things\nthat kind of floated to the surface that\npeople felt pretty\nuh interested in talking about so we'll\nget to those in a second any questions\nabout that format\nokay so we're going to meet\nannouncements check-ins\nkind of recap\ntalk for a while i'll probably try to\nsummarize and maybe do a little bit of\nexplicit teaching towards the end\ndepending on how much time we have\nsometimes that's better in the middle\num and then that's kind of our format\nand then we'll kind of assign homework\nas necessary\nsound good\nokay sounds good so let's uh restart\nwith introductions so why don't y'all\ntell us a little bit about um you know\nwho you are where people can find you\nand also what you kind of took away from\nlast week's group\ni can start first if unless anyone has a\npreference\nyou're good\nawesome i'll start first uh hi everyone\ni'm michael i go by smirky here on\ntwitch and various other socials as my\ndoorbell just rain even though the door\nis unlocked um

perfect\nthat's better yeah thank you cool thank\nyou\num i'll go uh i'm metric seconds hi uh\nhe him um\ni\nused to grind darkest dungeon like crazy\nwould do deathless runs and challenges\nand all sorts of stuff\num\nand\nnow nowadays i sometimes i play for fun\nuh which is wild um\ni work on\nvariety but mostly super hard challenges\nwhen i can find them\nand\nyou can find me at twitch.tv metric\nseconds\nawesome\nnext\nhey everybody my name is kathy aka zerg\ngirl you can find me on twitch streaming\nuh mainly starcraft 2\nat\nz-e-r-g g-i-r-l\nbecause a lot of people like to ask how\nit's spelt\num and yeah i just mainly stream\nstarcraft 2 whether it be ladder matches\nuh playing co-op or team games with\nfriends\ni also work\nin corporate activision blizzard king\nawesome thanks kathy\nall right um\ni'm blast so uh what's up guys\nmy name is josh otherwise known as zelle\num i stream at twitch.tv cell uh i guess\nmost people have heard of me through\nthe talk show i used to do at riot games\ncalled allchat and then i moved into\ndoing stuff with uh offline tv\nuh and now i uh i'm a retired streamer\nstreaming mmo rpg of final fantasy 14\nmostly these days\num and i do anime content and i'm known\nalso for doing uh k-pop dance covers and\nstuff so\nuh anime video games k-pop uh\nall that jazz so awesome um that's me\nand uh i guess uh we were supposed to\ntalk a little bit about our like\ntakeaways from last session and just\nthat it's a great transition it's uh\nit's uh hard\nto be in a group setting we're talking\nabout kind of like our boundaries a\nlittle bit uh one of the notes that i\nwrote was just like you know talking\nabout um\nyou know ambiguity and i think it's one\nof those things that we do\num to be kind of conscious of others to\nnot like you know over detailed and over\ndump things onto people so we\nuh\nkind of go to being ambiguous as kind of\nlike protection from that so\num\nyeah so yeah that was uh one of the\ntakeaways\nawesome thanks sal so i think that's a\ngreat chance to transition so i'm kind\nof curious like\nwhat was last week like for y'all\nuh\nawkward\nairy\nit was i was terrified\ni i mean it melted up in my head for\nweeks so sorry\nokay\nso awesome i mean yeah\nruby i agree with you though i also\nenjoyed it like it was a hand the\nawkwardness and the enjoyment of it goes\nhand in hand i felt a lot better like\nabout 30 minutes in i think which i mean\ni've probably heard that before\nthat was it yeah\nsorry really sure what to expect going\nin um i didn't really feel awkward at\nall i know i was silent for most of it\nbut i think that's just me i like to\nkind of sit back and listen\nmore and then you know engage whenever\npeople want to talk about certain things\nor i feel like i have something to\ncontribute to a topic\nyeah and so remind me again who's\nresponsible for making sure that\neveryone is participating well enough\neverybody\nyes\nbut me the most right\nyou have a little bit more a little bit\nmore height\nbut yeah i'm gonna share that\nresponsibility with you all so i i\nappreciate kathy sort of also bringing\nup that you know acknowledging as the\nwhole group noticed and by the way y'all\ndid really well because sometimes it\nusually takes weeks for people to really\nlike notice that some people are more\nnaturally quiet it's not necessarily\nshyness or things like that and\nespecially in a group setting sometimes\npeople are really vibing right and\nthey're like saying things that feel\nreally important so we don't want to\ninterrupt that flow especially if we\ndon't have something to add which is\ntotally fine\nso other things that you all kind of\ntook away so it was kind of awkward\ndid y'all feel like you learned anything\nyeah ruby\num\ni got a really lovely long voice note\nand i was gonna tell metric before he\nwas suddenly wished us on to stream but\nit's probably a really good thing for\nstream um\ni got a really lovely long voice note\nfrom a good friend of mine who is also a\nstreamer i won't name them um\njust saying\nhow\nmuch they appreciated metric story\nabout\nstreaming and representation\nand\num\n[Music]\nyeah how much that meant to them and how\nimportant it was\nand so i took away from\nthat how\nyou don't realize\nyour story or your little\nthing that you think is unimportant\ncan really reach someone that you have\nno idea who is listening\nand\nmake them feel\nless alone or\nmake them feel more confident or\nyou know just change their day\nso yeah\nthat\nreally means a lot that um\nthat that probably made my week\nso\nthank you that's\nholy crap\nyeah yeah that's that's cool if you want\nto know who it was i can ask them if\nthey would like to talk if they ever\nwant to reach out i am i'm always\navailable i'll ask them\nthanks thank you\nokay so now we're gonna learn our skill\nfor the day and i forgot to mention that\nin the intro but one of the skills that\nwe're gonna focus on is noticing\nso we cultivate all kinds of actionable\nskills right so one of the things that\nso prior to\nbecoming a doctor and becoming a\nstreamer and all that stuff i spent a\nfew years studying to become a monk in\nindia\nand one of the things that they teach is\nthat awareness and noticing is actually\na skill and in the west we generally\nthink about skills as actions\nas opposed to things that involve our\nsensory organs\nwe sort of know this like somewhat right\nso even if you're playing video games\nfor example there's like certain sixth\nsenses or awareness that you develop i'm\nalways going to be looking at the\nmini-map\nwe know obviously that people in\nparticular fields are become good\nlisteners we also know that chefs for\nexample will refine their palette\nso i'm going to ask y'all what did y'all\nnotice\nabout ruby\ni would say\neven if she's soft-spoken\nshe's very deliberate\nthere's no\nwords there's no\nwasted time\nand\nshe's careful\num\nin what she says and how she says it\nso that\nit has its like maximum impact\nso\nwhereas like i could babble on and on\nand i'm doing it right now\nokay\nthere's like a lot of uh\nlike it's like a combination of uh\nlike cautiousness and intentionality\nthat kind of like blends well together\nwith how ruby communicates i think\nokay\nanyone noticing\noh i think he's very empathetic\num\ni feel like when you were introducing\nyourself last week you were talking a\nlot about\nemotions and you kind of understood that\nabout yourself\nand also like kind of bringing up your\nyour friend's story in relation to\nmetric\num i think that shows great empathy from\nyou\nand what did you\ngo ahead zell i guess we're talking\nbecause i felt like i was the last one\nout so i uh\ni just uh\nmy impression was just yeah kind of\nsimilar to dessert girl they're like\nempathetic and very open um like\nemotionally very warm\nand inviting to people you know kind of\nsharing your own story and experiences\nand i think you know again when uh dr k\nlast week asked a question or that you\nknow asked four questions like ruby was\nnot hesitant in you know opening up for\nyou know situations that i think a lot\nof people would find themselves\nuncomfortable and i think that's an\nadmirable trait so yeah\nso i guess everything that we noticed\nwas very complementary\nright\nwhat do y'all think about that\ni mean part of it i think is uh that's\nour courteousness as people right and i\nthink we\nwe don't want to\nattempt to offend each other you know uh\nespecially this early on so i think like\nyou know not saying that like i think\nbadly on anybody or i'm judgmental or\nanything but i think just in general\nthat's just how people trend in social\nsituations that you know are\nhaven't been defined yet like we haven't\nreally figured out our boundaries yet\nand so this is part of that like\nboundary setting i think\nyeah if she if she has bodies like cut\nup in her freezer we don't know so\nall right so this is what makes this fun\nso so\nexcellent excellent points by everybody\nright so obviously like\nwhen i'm saying oh like we all\ncomplimented her in the back of my mind\ni don't have some kind of criticism\nthat i'm\nasking for people to guess right there's\nbecause i i agree with ali all i mean i\nthink for the most part we're going to\nbe very very supportive\nand at the same time we also want to\nnotice\nwhat\nwe we're doing right and as zell said\nit's kind of like boundaries like when\nyou're like oh like let's all let's all\ntalk let's all take turns talking about\nzell and then everyone's gonna be like\noh zell is so great zell is this and\nzell is that which is awesome\nright so we want to be positive and also\nwe want to just be aware of what we're\ndoing that this is still the early stage\nand at some point if our real goal here\nis to help each other right if we want\nto be authentic and compassionate\nwe also may want to at some point\nchallenge people a little bit or notice\nthings like so the thing is you all all\nstarted staying stuff what i noticed was\nthat ruby was at the edge of tears\nand i don't know if y'all and and i\nthink people were interpreting that as\nempathy but like what i was struck by is\nshe's very thoughtful she's you know\nclear she's an awesome asmr streamer\nright because of her words and her her\ndeliberateness\nshe's very well spoken and now i i\nmentioned tears and and it's like did i\njust [Â __Â ] up i no i cried on screen\ntoday i'm um i'm having a really like\nit's something with my adhd like my\nemotional dysregulation sometimes i'm\njust super emotional and then other\ntimes i can just\ndeal with it\nand\nyeah like\ntoday i've just been like that\nyeah you didn't mess up anything it's\njust me\nyeah so so now\ni kind of feel like i messed up even\nmore\nbecause i commented on it and now she's\ntearful but this is exactly why we\nnotice\nbecause now what has ruby now shared\nwith us\nit's kind of like she's uh opened up i\nguess like\nlike she's being more vulnerable\nand i think that's very powerful you\nknow with like being open about\nher uh you know emotions and everything\nyeah\nand so how did we get there\nwhat happened cry that's how you got\nthere\nif i had said oh ruby is amazing and\nshe's wonderful i believe all those\nthings\nright so i i\nwhen we compliment people what happens\nwe feel\nso i i what i'm kind of noticing is that\nlike as we complement people there's\nsuch a positive energy\nright and it's like yeah like oh my god\nlike uh\nand then the interesting thing is that\nwhen people have tears\nso the way i interpreted that is like\nwow that must have been one hell of a\nvoice message\nand that like you know she was\nsummarizing it but i'm guessing that the\nthe voice message was really really\nheartfelt this person was really\nimpacted and and metric's story really\nresonated with someone and like ruby was\nwitness\nto that\nand also\nmaybe there's more to it\nmaybe we shouldn't assume that the tears\nare just\nempathy and joy and stuff like that\nright\nso this is where we're kind of combining\nnoticing and digging into ambiguity\nwe're not necessarily we're going to get\nto this in a second we're going to teach\ny'all how to talk but so now\npeople are kind of wondering okay ruby's\nsort of saying like she's having maybe\nnot the best week and like now what do\nwe do how do we respect the boundary of\nlike privacy\nversus\ntrying to be compassionate\nis that where people are like what do we\ndo with this now\nyes no\nwhat do people think\nam i making things really awkward too\nfast\ni mean i think part of it though was\nalso that ruby sort of mentioned that\nlike this is her you know condition and\nthis is like how she you know sometimes\nthings just happen and so she's kind of\nlike\nestablishing that like her tears aren't\nnecessarily the fault of what you had\nsaid and that like you know uh\nlike\nit puts the onus back on her i guess\nversus us in that like we she's\nreaffirming that\nwe are not hurting her in what we had\nsaid and i think that too is like\nanother boundary setting sort of thing\num\nso if anything i feel more like\nruby's saying\nno you're good keep going you know like\nlike this is this is our time to\ncontinue to you know talk about things\nand don't worry too much is kind of like\nhow i took it\nand what is ruby telling us now\nyeah i'm fine\ni'm absolutely fine i've just i've i've\nhad one of those days like\ni care about things a lot and i care\nabout people a lot\nand then it just takes\nsometimes if i'm caught on one of those\noff days where maybe i've been a little\nmore overwhelmed and\n[Music]\ni found like the day a little harder to\nget into i've actually had a really good\nday\nand like\nyeah it just takes one small thing so\nlike then i cried earlier on stream\nbecause someone said something\nand then i've gone and like\nworked out for an hour and then i've\ncome here\nand\nyou know i'm just tired now\ni think that's it\nit sounds like a really full day\nlike yeah physically taxing emotionally\ntaxing not necessarily in a bad way\nso now we've kind of got a fork in the\nroad we can talk a little bit about you\nknow uh homework and kind of what we\ndiscussed last week sort of formally\nopen up a topic of discussion\nor we can sort of focus a little bit on\nsome of the themes that ruby is bringing\nforward like\nhow do you as a content creator manage\ngood days versus bad days versus full\ndays\ntalking about taxing days\nwhat do you all want to do do you want\nto kind of talk a little bit about\nhomework and stuff or\nsort of focus on because we had proposed\na couple of topics for this week\num good days and bad days definitely\nwas like the theme of my last\nseven days\nuh because i mean there were some days\nwhere i just was not awake\nor i couldn't talk or\ncouldn't swallow you know food without\nutter pain i lost my sense of smell for\na while which was fun\num\nand\ni couldn't stream so that was also like\nreally frustrating um\nbecause\nbasically\nthis month for me between like seeing my\nparents for a week and then getting sick\nfrom them and then\njust being sick for the rest of the\nmonth this whole month has been a wash\num\nnot to say i'm not grateful for the\nstreams i've been able to do but like\nyou don't want to take that much time\noff\nif you're\nregularly creating content and\num\nlike even last night i tried two-point\ncampus for the first time and i broke\nthe game in two hours and\ni made the game give me infinite money\nwithout really trying and it wasn't fun\nanymore and\nlike i'm not bragging it's like i\nliterally was like how did they make\nthis game and not notice that i could\nbreak this like all i did was have the\ngame pay me\nto take loans and then pay other loans\nand then it's almost like real business\nbut\nthere's social commentary there\nsomewhere um\nbut\ni was so frustrated because i was really\nexcited for this game and then\nuh\ni i\ni guess like\ni had to sit back and think about like\nwhat is there to be grateful for\nin all of it and it was all the people\nwho still like\nwanted to hang out\ndespite that and wanted to see me\ndespite you know all the days that i\ntook off because\none of the things that like when you're\nsick or you can't stream or anything\nlike that or if something happens\ni think like every streamer is kind of\nfamiliar with being told take as much\ntime as you need\nbut like we don't get sick days we don't\nget uh\npto we don't get anything like that like\nthat's it's it's\nit's a really nice platitude\nbut and i know that like anyone who\ntells you that doesn't mean it\nsarcastically or or thoughtlessly or\nanything like that they mean it in the\nbest way possible\nbut\nwe we can't take\nas much time as we want to it's sort of\nlike\nyou know if you're sick\nat a normal job like people don't tell\nyou take as much time as you want to at\na certain point\nit doesn't work right so\num\ni\ni don't know like this this week was\nkind of just making me feel like well\ni have all these people who still stick\nby me no matter what um\nand\neven if i have a rough month like this\nlike\nthey've\ngiven me the confidence to know that\nlike i can bounce back though\ni kind of so kind of jumping off of what\nmetric was saying and relating it to\nactually our homework like i think\njust the general theme i think when it\ncomes to\ncontent creation is just every action\nhas a opportunity cost\num and that's how it relates to our\nhomework right is that like\nif we are being our authentic sells what\nis the cost of that if we are just\nfocused on our metrics what is the cost\nof that uh if we are focused on our\nhealth what is the cost of that you know\nin metrics case like uh if we take time\noff for ourselves for our mental health\nwhat is the cost like i think\nthe easy trap mentally when you're a\ncontent creator is like you're trying to\neke out uh and maximize each possible\nmoment like a couple of my friends would\nalways say uh as a content creator it's\nall about your abcs always be contenting\nand like you start to\nuh figure out like literally how to\nmaximize each and everything that you do\nit's like okay well i'm gonna make a\ntwitch stream and i'm gonna make a\nyoutube video out of it and i'm gonna\ntake the clips and put it on tiktok and\ninstagram i'm gonna take pictures you\nknow like everything you're trying to\nmaximize always and\nuh\nand like it goes in so many different\num\ndifferent ways too not just like in your\nuh just\nhow you make content it's like what\ncontent do you make uh and then yeah i\ndon't know so like to me actually like\nall these things sound related under the\nkind of umbrella of opportunity costs\nfor content creators um\nso personally speaking like i think i'd\nlike yeah i don't know that's that's how\ni see it\num can i speak um\nso\nyou're saying about that always\nbe content creating that made me laugh\num\nso last year when\ni got my adhd diagnosis i kind of like\nquit creating so much content\num\n[Music]\ni kind of just\ni needed a timeout after being diagnosed\num and twitch stream was my main focus\nlike\nyou can stop making\nyoutube videos\nyou can stop posting on instagram for a\nbit but if you stop streaming i think\nthat people notice like\nquicker and it will it falls down\nfaster you know\nthan other platforms um\nand\nso when i got diagnosed i kind of like\neverything really hit me because\ni'm very\nlike i don't know how to describe this\nbut i'm very adhd and everything i've\ndone in my life has been\nto not be\nadhd if you get what i mean like\neverything i've done in my life like\nmeditation\nand\neverything i've found to help myself has\nbeen\nto not\nact or\nlike to counterbalance\nmy adhd\num but the only thing that was like\nfeeding it was content creation\nlike there was this like it was like i\nwas on a hamster wheel\nlike if i could make a tick tock every\nday\nso this is what i was doing in a week i\nwas doing four twitch streams three tick\ntock streams\ntwo youtube videos a tick tock every day\nuploading on instagram like every day\nthen i started running another instagram\nand uploading reels on there every day\nand then thinking about what twitter\ncontent i can put out what clips i can\ntake from stream\nand\ni had that all like down\nto an r i would get up in the morning i\nwould edit i would record i would edit i\nwould stream\ni would post i would still be doing uh\ncommunity nights on my discord once a\nmonth\ni would be doing all of that and then i\ngot diagnosed and just kind of felt like\ni went like this\nand just let it all go just throw the\npapers everywhere\n[Laughter]\nyeah and\nit was kind of like a weird\nrelief um\nand\ni focused on stream and i focused on\nmyself even more i realized that\neverything i knew up until that point\nabout myself\ni kind of had to relearn in a way\nbecause now i knew why\nwhy i did that thing why i reacted like\nthat why i i kind of had to\nre-configure myself and\num i'm slowly getting back into it now\nlike but i don't want to be doing that\nagain that was like i was chasing some\nkind of hamster wheel that was burnout\nthat was like my eyes were always dry\nlike\ni\nwas in\nphysical pain every day because\ni just felt like i had to keep on going\nand\ni don't want that again but i also know\ni need to\ni say i need to i don't need to do\nanything\ni want to\ncreate good content\nthat comes from\nmy heart\nand a good place see look tears are\ncoming back again because i'm just\nhaving an emotional day and when i talk\nabout stuff like my\nwater just comes out my eyes so ignore\nit um\nso yeah i realized that\nby sharing and talking about i've told\nall of my community about this and i put\nposts out\nand\nthe outpouring of love i got back from\njust being\nhonest\nwas\nlarger than\nany response i've ever got from a video\nthat took me weeks and i stayed up till\nmidnight\nmaking\nand didn't get any sleep and then it\ndidn't do as well as i wanted it to do\nand\nlike i'm not saying it's for everyone to\njust\nput yourself out there\nand talk about how you're feeling\nand what's going on\num\nbut\nyeah the the reaction was good and\nit was scary\ni don't know what i was so scared about\num\nand\nyeah that's what i wanted to share\nso i don't want to dominate the\nconversation but it's fun and i also\ndon't want to come off the wrong way\nhere as well so two caveats right away\num but i i was sort of sort of in a very\nsimilar situation where i was\noverworking myself and you know the\nalways be contenting thing like you know\ni was uh and this also relates to zerg\ngirl too because i was working my\nfull-time job at riot games in between\nmeetings i'm checking offline tv stuff\nto figure out what we're gonna do and\nchecking editing i would go to the gym\nafter i was done working and then i\nwould go to my k-pop dance uh practice\nand i'd go home and stream for a couple\nhours and then i would stay up till 4am\nto edit my daily vlogs videos that i was\ndoing and then i would wake up at 9am to\nstart it all over again you know so like\ni and i did that uh and it eventually\ngot to a point where i was like i can't\ndo all these things so i ended up\nleaving riot and thinking that i would\ndo\nuh just all content creation\nand then covet happened and then i i got\nto that point where i was like\nscrew it i can't do this anymore and uh\nand i just completely like i lost\nit felt like my entire momentum that i\nhad built up with my productivity\nbecause i had it all down to a system\nand once i pulled a piece from that\nsystem to for me personally it all came\ndown crumbling i became like a just\ninstead of being a content creator who\nwas addicted to video games and stuff i\nwas just the guy who was addicted to\nvideo games and then\nso i stopped making content and all that\nand like\nthree years now you know it's been three\nwhole years since the start of kovid and\nlike my fallout there and i look back\nand not gonna lie like i kind of regret\nit like i kind of regret falling off the\nhorse because it's been so hard to go\nback onto them so this is yeah\ni'm just kind of sharing it just because\ni have such a i have a kind of a\ndifferent viewpoint and like i and this\nis like the\nit's like the fear of content creator\ngod kind of came back into me where i\nwas like damn if i if i lose momentum\nlike that like i could really lose\neverything and like i struggle with that\nnow which is that like i'm now kind of a\nhas been content creator and now how do\ni\nwork up to that point to where i was\nagain has been something that was like\nvery is is like very scary in the back\nof my mind and like again it's like that\ni think every content creator fears that\ngod of like what happens if you stop\ncreating and like what if you like stop\ndo you know like working at this so like\nanyways the fear of like the fear of\nirrelevancy almost yeah yeah it's like\nbecause like as a content creator you\nknow how lucky you are to have the\naudience that you have you know how hard\nit is and how difficult it was for and\nhow even though you worked hard how\nfortunate that we are in the position\nposition that we are and so there's just\na lot of fear and anxiety about losing\nthat right and so like for me it was\nreaffirming that so anyways yeah no no\nhe literally said it i was gonna say\ndid you really enjoy it or was it just\nthe anxiety that kept you going\nbecause for me it was fear and anxiety i\nwasn't doing something that i loved\nanymore\ni like\nand and\nwhen i threw it away\ni didn't throw it away\ni'm just changing my perspective\nyeah no i think that's totally valid um\ni think for me and this is this is my\nown demon right and that like i've\nalways been someone who pressures\nthemselves constantly to like push push\npush like um\nlike\nas like like as a kid like this is now\nwe're going to the life story of zell\nnow but uh like historically just like\ngrowing up like i was always just like\npushed to perform and i think that's\njust something that i've took with me\nand so like when i was super productive\nyes it was tiring but it was like i was\nalso putting out good work and i felt\nreally good about it and\nyou know\nthat was sustaining and so like\nyeah i don't know it's a different\nperspective right because i i think\nthere was part of it of this anxiety\nthat's probably part of what drives me\nas a person and to continue to perform\nis just like this like learned behavior\nthat i've took with me throughout my\nlife but at the same time\nthe the the results of that anxiety also\npushed me to do\nbetter as a content creator to create\nthings that i could be proud of because\ni think\npart in part with creation i think there\nis just has to be a little bit of\nanxiety about your creation because if\nyou don't have any anxiety about what\nyou're creating then\nlike how can you\nhow can you\nlike see the quality of your own work if\nif you don't actually assign any value\nto it so like that's that's just my\nperspective on that but that's that's\nwhere i'm coming interesting and i get i\nkind of get where you're coming from as\nwell because i come from a performing\narts background i was like a stage\nschool kid like\nroyal ballet\nand\nstuff when i was a kid and so i kind of\nget that pressure but\ni've kind of unwound that and\ndislike it but that's a whole therapy\nsession\nlet's pause for a second let's just kind\nof\nnotice what's happening here\nso a lot of people are sharing\ni think some themes are coming forward\ndefinitely a couple of teaching topics\nwe can touch on\nbut let's kind of i'm gonna point out\nthat we haven't heard as much from kathy\nor smirky today\nand that's okay not everyone has to\nparticipate the same amount and at the\nsame time i want to give them an\nopportunity because i'm wondering if\nespecially like i'm thinking a little\nbit about you know smirky being heavily\ninvested in a game that isn't quite as\npopular\num now i'm sort of also noticing that\nkathy may resonate a lot with working at\na gaming company and also trying to\nbalance that with being a content\ncreator\ni'm kind of curious do either you all\nwant to kind of chime in with with kind\nof your perspective or things that\nresonate with you or things you're\ncurious about\nuh i've wanted to chime in but i also\nwant to give people space to say what is\non their mind so i wasn't gonna like\ninterrupt no no no no no you don't have\nto be sorry it's totally fine you know i\nlove listening to\neverything and i'm just like digesting\neverything um and i i could relate in\nthe sense of like having like i just\ngraduated college and i was like busy\nwith school like throughout most of my\ncontent creation you know journey i've\nit's always been streaming and school\nand uh\ni would always have to like i was very\nheavily involved with like all these\norganizations i did you know the thing\nthat people tell you not to do is which\nis to like\nnot learn how to say no to things you\nalways say yes and you just like you add\none thing onto the plate then you add\nanother thing onto the plate and another\nthing and before i knew it i was like\nsuper busy and i couldn't really keep\nlike a consistent schedule or anything\nso it was a little uh difficult to kind\nof like\ndeal with that and i also kind of felt\nlike you know uh\nit was impacting like my system of what\ni had just like like i've i've always\nhad like doubts and thoughts in my mind\nlike wow like you know like yes we have\na great community and i feel like uh you\nknow there's this feeling that's like\nyou know it could be more i guess uh\num\nnot sustained but like it could be more\nbuilt together i guess like it could be\nmore intact but it feels a little like\nloose and it feels like i have to put in\nso much work just to like make sure that\nyou know i'm\nputting the pieces back together of this\npuzzle to make sure it's like a you know\nstrong tight-knit family almost i guess\nif that makes any sort of sense um\ni\nyeah so i can definitely uh\nrelate to that for sure and like\ndefinitely have gone through so many\nperiods of burnout as well um\nand just having to like i very recently\ni like would take several like weeks off\nof like streaming just for my own like\nmental health and you know making sure\nthat like uh i'm in a all right place\nand even nowadays i'm like being being\nconscious of like hey this is time that\ni need off but like making sure that i\nlike set aside a good amount of time\nthat's comfortable for me to like\ntake the time that i need away from\nstream and then also it's like well now\nyou're like doing all these other things\nlike emails or you're thinking about\nyour next video idea when you should\nprobably be like backing off just a\nlittle bit more and like actually taking\ntime for yourself taking care of\nyourself uh one of those things where\nit's like always preaching how like hey\nyou you should take care of yourself and\nthen like not following through on your\nown words\ni'm definitely someone who does that a\nlot\ni don't know those are some thoughts\nthat come out of my mind\nin the midst of listening to all of this\ngreat\nme personally i feel like i can't really\nrelate\nwhich is why i was not able to chime in\nwith any anecdotes or whatnot i really\nrespect your all of your work ethics i\nthink that's amazing\ni guess my approach towards\nstreaming was just like\nyou know\ni'm gonna bring up sales acronym abc but\nalways be chilling like you guys do a\nlot of work with editing your videos\num pushing out\nstuff on different platforms and whatnot\nthe way i approach\nmy own content creation streaming is\njust i'm just kind of\nladdering and presenting my authentic\nself\nuh so that's probably like to me i\nalways think like oh i'm kind of like\nlazy about this i'm not really\nyou know um\nmanufacturing something i guess so\nthat's how i kind of cope with not\nburning out and also working like you\nknow i make sure\ni eat healthy i get\ngood exercise make sure i have like a\ndecent social support system but um\nyeah that's why\ni couldn't really relate to that because\ni don't\ndo the i don't put out the amount of\nwork that you guys\nput\nand that's\ni think that's totally okay um because\nthere's this like i i don't know y'all\ncan correct me for mom but there i feel\nlike there's kind of like a standard or\nmisconception that like uh\nlike we always have to be working all\nthe time like content like yes content\ncreators do put in so much work into\ntheir craft um but that doesn't\nnecessarily encompass every single\ncontent creator um i certainly have had\nmoments where like yeah maybe i could be\ndoing a lot more but here i am just\nbeing complacent with like just\nstreaming every now and then and not\nreally doing anything else and just\nletting my youtube channel that i used\nto do stuff on just kind of sit there\nand not really making any progress with\nthat but honestly just you know being\nokay with that as well uh just like you\nknow what it's it's you know can't do\neverything at once you know\nhaving to make sure that um you know i\ndo what i can but if i can't do\nsomething that's that's totally okay too\num when it comes to work ethics like\nthere's an ideal me and the ideal me is\na shark\num\nlike uh\nto me like a typical shark is always\nswimming it's always going forward it's\nmoving on to the next meal\nand then like\nwhen i get bogged down which has been\nmore often than usual especially in the\nlast couple years of living like a\nhermit i feel like one of those crabs or\nwhatever that just hides under the sand\nand just waits for something to come\nalong and like\ni'm not\nthat's not my ideal me\num\nand i feel lazy or like\nlike like it might be rest or something\nthat i actually do need but i don't\nregard it as such and then i just feel\nreally guilty about that\num\nand\nit\ni i mean in the in the topic of like\nhas-been-ism if that's a thing if we can\nuse that word\nlike i feel like\ni fell off a while ago because it's not\njust like numbers or anything like that\nit's the amount of people who\nyou felt like were peers\nand then\nall of a sudden one day\nthey don't really\ntalk to you anymore\nand you're like what happened you know\nlike\ni guess\ni guess those numbers that i was putting\nout\num\nthey don't make me uh\nas attractive to hang out with anymore\nor something like\nand i always i always wonder about that\nbecause like there's this weird social\ncircle to\nsuccess on twitch\num or at least in content creation in\ngeneral where like\nyou know metric who and like that's the\nthing that's sitting in the back of my\nhead all the time is\nmetric who\num\nwhere like two years ago\ni i just thought like oh man i cannot\nwait like\nthey gonna know me\nand\ni mean i don't even know me anymore so\nso let's pause for a second\nwhat are we getting out of this\nwe're talking about our experiences\nyou know this is like\nruby's like yeah i like it's a it's a\nperspective shift\nhamster wheels\num what we kind of call it in our\ncontent creator coaching program is the\nfeeling that the sand and the hourglass\nis running out\nright while you're on top\nand we're talking about all of our\nexperiences\nwe have different experiences some\npeople feel this there's some stuff that\nwe're resonating on some stuff is a\nlittle bitter but like what's\nis this gonna help y'all\ni think it is for from my own\nperspective um and i mean maybe someone\nhas a different perspective you know and\nthat's totally cool i i think for i\nthink for me um\nuh like one thing that i really wanted\nto do more of is not simply just like oh\nhey let's work on this collaboration\nwith said other creator but like\nactually getting like sit down and like\nhear the stories and experiences from\nothers to open up dialogue and just kind\nof like\ni don't know just kind of like open up a\nbook and essentially like um\nindulge in like each other's experiences\nwhere you know then we start noticing\nmore like hey i resonate with this or i\nuh i feel you know you know i have\nfeedback on this or i don't know um it\nit it's definitely really great to just\nlike\num have these conversations because\nyou're like hey i'm not alone like this\nis you know these are struggles that\nother people are going through things\nlike that um and i see ruby has\nsomething they want to say so i'm not\npassing that's fine\nyeah okay okay i'm trying to restrict my\nhand i'm literally trying to put it down\ni'm done you go you got this\ni i feel like it relates to the homework\nabout authenticity and content creation\nand numbers and where does that balance\nlie\num zergo\nactually said the words\nthat she's not trying to\nmanufacture something\num\nand she's just chilling and just being\nherself which is like\nthe best\nbut it's also and i'm not criticizing\nyour words but it's\nwe all do it we're trying to we are\ntrying to manufacture something or it's\nthat feeling that we\nare trying to create something and what\nare we trying to create it for what's\nthe outcome are we feeding our own egos\nare we trying to fill\nour own like for me like i think part of\nit was realizing that i was just on this\ndopamine train\nand\nthe more work i put in the more results\ni saw back but were they really the\nresults\nthat actually truly\nresonated with me and what i wanted my\ncontent to be and the message that i\nwant to create or was i\nfollowing and focusing on\nwhat's trending what's gonna get clicks\nwhat's\nam i am i taking myself\nlike when you get on that hamster wheel\nyou don't have the time to breathe\nand focus on what\nactually you're creating\nyou're just putting it out there\nand does it have\nlike not everything has to be that deep\ni know okay ruby but for me\nwith the content i'm creating\nit does have to be a little bit deeper\nit does\nlike for me to feel fulfilled\num what makes me happy is genuinely\nmaking other people's\nlike feel happy\num\n[Music]\ni i like\npeople being happy i like you know\nand\nthat's what my aim of my content was but\nhad that shifted and was i just trying\nto make myself happy\nand it's finding that balance between\nlikes and knowing that those likes are\nhuman beings that chose to come and\nclick on your content and they resonated\nwith something i would much rather\nget like\n10\ndecent comments on a youtube video where\npeople want to share something because\nthat video\nconnected with them in a certain way\nthan\na hundred comments of people talking\nabout my appearance\nand my looks\num\n[Music]\nand i think that's\nwhere that perspective shift happened\nfor me\ni'm gonna chime in a little bit here but\nso kind of to go back to what dr k kind\nof asked like i think you guys are all\nawesome and i think these shared\nexperiences are really interesting and i\nwould love to like one-on-one talk with\nyou about my experiences and hear your\nguys stories and how we relate but as it\nrelates to like actionable things that i\ncould learn to take away like if\nif if the rest of these sessions were\nall of us just kind of sharing our\nexperiences and we we nodded each other\nand we go hmm okay yeah that is\ninteresting okay but that doesn't quite\nyou know some of it relates some of it\ndoesn't and then i would go home and\nthen i think about it and then i don't\nthink i would have changed as a person\nuh after these\nuh things as much like i would kind of\nunderstand that uh some of the things\ni'm going through are how other people\nbut like you know the step that i would\nwant to take to the next thing is like\nokay we have these shared experiences or\nsometimes we don't but like\nwhat is like the missing thing that\nhelps us because like from my\nperspective i don't even know like\nobviously this is this sounds like a\ndumb thing to say but like i don't know\nwhat helps me and i don't know if\ntalking\nabout our experiences just kind of\nblindly and shooting in the dark and\nhoping that someone relates is actually\na step in towards like helping me\nunderstand what i need to help myself\nyou know uh and\nbut that said like again like i was\nsaying before like i would love to talk\nto you guys about your experiences\nbecause i think it's fascinating i think\nit's interesting because we\nclearly have very different values in\nhow we look at things and i think that\nis\none it's valid that like you know for\nexample like maybe zerg girl doesn't\nfeel that uh this sands in the hourglass\nas much as like someone like i do uh and\ni think that's really interesting and i\nwould love to know more about that um\nbut yeah i don't i\ndon't know i just kind of rambled there\nyeah so i'm i'm glad you said that zell\nso i'm i appreciate everyone's\nexperiences so let's understand a little\nbit about what my goals are\nso i'm going to offer some direction to\nthe group y'all can actually veto it if\nyou want to okay\nso let's understand a little bit about\nscience\nof sharing and success\nso we know for example that if you take\na group of patients who struggle with\nchronic pain\nthat if you get them in a group and they\ntalk about their pain\nthat their pain generally feels better\nso there's like a quality of life\nimprovement\nsometimes you'll get some mild amount of\nfunctional improvement\nbut we also know that if you've got\npatients with chronic pain\nthere is a value to shared experience\nthere is a value to resonating with\npeople\nbut in our experience sharing experience\nis just the beginning\nand you can\nmanufacture or extract\nmore value\nout of these things if you take it a\ncouple of\nsteps forward\nnow i'm not saying that\nwe have to necessarily do that that's\nwhat i'm gonna try to do if y'all are\nokay with that\nbut essentially like so we share a bunch\nof these experiences and and then what\nso there's there's actually a value to\nthat so we know as human beings that\nsharing is sufficient for attaining some\namount of value what i've seen a lot and\nthis this sort of starts with my kind of\nexperience as a psychiatrist is that\nlike i would get patients come into my\noffice and we'd like talk about their\nfeelings and like oh you know like i got\ndumped by my my significant other and it\nhurts and it's like oh yeah that's bad\nlet's talk about it okay okay\nafter a while they feel better they\nstart dating again they get dumped again\nand they're like oh god it hurts it's\nthe second time it's happened oh yeah\ni'm so sorry for you that must hurt yeah\nit's so bad\nthey start dating again they get dumped\nagain it's like i don't know why this\nkeeps happening and it's like at some\npoint it's like well maybe we can\nactually answer that question\nit's not i'm starting to feel attacked\nthere i'm just saying\nwe'll get there metric\npace yourself buddy\num so so now what i i'd like to do is\njust sort of share what i'm kind of\nhearing from y'all so what the first\nthing is that each and every one of you\nhas adapted\nto this core problem\nof i'm going to call it the hamster\nwheel or i'm not going to y'all call it\nthe hamster wheel so here's the thing\nabout being a content creator so we're\ntalking about like you know wellness and\ntaking time off and things like that but\nthe undercurrent that people have sort\nof suggested is like you know ruby's\nlike i'm satisfied with 10 comments that\nare in the right direction rather than\n100 comments that are in the wrong\ndirection we can all resonate with that\nbut the question that i've got is can\nyou get a hundred comments in the right\ndirection\nwhy does it have to be\nten comments in the right direction or a\nhundred comments in the wrong direction\nright and like in terms of manufacturing\ncontent i love that word as well like\nbecause i think that there's a certain\ngrind to it right and we sort of have\nthis idea that the more that we grind\nthe more successful we are and here's\nmetric kind of saying like oh like\neveryone's like go take a day off metric\nlike it's okay you got coveted you don't\nhave to stream but then if you take a\nday off or you take two days off or\nthree days off or five days off or eight\ndays off or 14 days off or 17 days off\nat some point it becomes hard to come\nback from that\nso as a scientist i know this sounds\nkind of weird\nbut\nis there a certain amount of time off\nthat you can take as a content creator\nand the answer is yes\nthere actually is\nright so like we can actually study this\nand we can decide that okay taking a one\nweek break everyone is going to be back\nonce you start streaming again\nyou take a month-long break and like\nsome people may have sloughed off they\nmay have moved on to other things you\ntake a year-long break and depending on\nhow you come back everyone comes rushing\nback\nso how do we balance okay like you know\nruby like laid out and i think you did a\nfantastic job of laying it out and i\nthink everyone sort of struggled with\nthis it's like x number of twitch days\nyoutube videos editing tick tocks\ninstagram number one clips channel vods\nchannel you know like this kind of thing\nshorts this like\none month one night a month on discord\nit becomes an absolute grind\nand does do do each and every one of\nthose things actually correlate with\ngrowth as a content creator\nbecause i i think this is where where\nthings get kind of tricky because like\ny'all are content creators right and and\nwe've also got kathy's perspective which\nis completely valid and sometimes will\nactually help content creators get to\nthis point where they realize i love\ncreating content\nbut i don't want it to be my primary\nsource of income because the price that\ni pay\nto be able to pay my rent\nsucceed in content creation\nwhere i think unfortunately we live in a\nworld where if ruby did go in the other\ndirection she'd probably make more money\nright\nand that's the challenge as a content\ncreator you can jump on a trend\nbe on inauthentic with yourself\nand get that sweet sweet growth\nand so as a content creator how much do\nyou how do you decide what's right for\nyou how much do i be on the hamster\nwheel when am i allowed to take a break\nyou know is it okay to take pto\nor pay time i mean we don't get ptos\ncontent creators but you know is it okay\nto take time off\nand the other thing that i'd love to\nshare with y'all because i know it\nsounds kind of weird but we may think\nlike oh my god like these things don't\nhave real answers it's bs they do have\nreal answers there's actually data about\nthis stuff it's just we live in an\nindustry where we don't have those\nnumbers\nright people know that there's a certain\namount of ideal it's something we do\nwell in medicine we're like we're like\nreally clear like if i prescribe you a\nstatin drug i know what percentage of\ncholesterol what percentage of people\nwill get a certain benefit on their\ncholesterol number going down we're like\nreally good about data and in terms of\ncontent creation i think the problem is\nthat we don't tend to pool data right so\nlike twitch may know particular things\nyoutube may know particular things they\nmay push particular kinds of content etc\nbut as a content creator how do i decide\nwhat is like\nthe right level like how do i achieve\noptimal growth without sacrificing\nmyself\nand this is where you know i i've sort\nof seen both sides we're on the one side\nlike i'm all for wellness and you know\ni'm a yoga teacher and meditator and\nstuff and i'm all for reframing and like\nputting yourself first but a lot of the\nclients that i worked with are like\ni'm not willing to put myself first if\nit costs me my success\nthere's sometimes what i'm hearing from\nall of you and everyone is kind of\ndecided on their own kind of balance\nwhich is good\nis that there's like how much do you\nwant to pay\nto be successful\nand what i heard from ruby is she used\nto pay a lot and she decided it ain't\nworth it\nand it's my belief that actually\nwe don't have to pay as high of a cost\nas we think we do\nit's about really understanding like\nwhat's the equation\nbecause our\nbasically general conclusion having\nworked with over 400 content creators\nnow\nis that the best way to make content\nis to be like authentic and energetic\nthe problem is that and there's a\ncertain numbers game to it so there's\nlike a minimum amount of like numbers\ngame\nbut that there's diminishing returns\nwith like more stuff\nand then there's certain kinds of what i\nwould call like\npolluting fuel like i call it dirty fuel\nor dirty energy\nthat you can use to continue to excel\nso being driven by anxiety being driven\nby fear so we call this internally the\nsand and the hourglass is running out so\nwe work with a lot of content creators\nwho feel like you know sometimes they'll\nlike blow up\nright or they'll see like a thousand\nmore viewers or they you know they've\ndoubled their viewers and now they feel\nlike they have to ride the wave\nand then the thousand viewers becomes\neleven hundred and twelve hundred and\nthirteen hundred and fourteen hundred\nand fifteen hundred now they're riding\nthe wave for five months six months and\nthen like how do i stop like how do i\ntake a break like i can't take a break\ni'm so tired but things are popping off\nand like i don't know how to say no\nso as a content creator and what i'm\nhearing from zell is like\nyeah like all this uh you know all this\nlike put yourself first and take care of\nyourself and don't burn out is great and\nall\nbut\ni kind of regret it\ni kind of regret that i didn't continue\nto grind because now that i've fallen\noff\ni don't know how to get back or do i\nhave to grind\nor like what is the formula for success\nand so it's my belief that there there\nis actually a formula for success it's\nmy belief that we can learn particular\nskills which allow us to work\nbut not at the cost of ourselves\nthat we can manage our emotions in a\nparticular way that we can continue to\nmake content on a daily or weekly basis\nand we can even be exhausted by it but\nthat we're not fueled by the wrong\nthings\nbecause thankfully at this point we do\nhave a lot of science on what burns\npeople out\nnumber one cause of burnout\nis not the amount of work that you do\nnot the reward that you get but the\nrelationship between the two\nso when you work really hard and you\ndon't see a benefit it causes people to\nburn out\nthe challenge is when i work really hard\nand i'm not seeing a benefit what do i\ndo\nwhat do y'all think\nwork harder\nabsolutely\ndouble down\nright\nit almost becomes something like the\ngambler's fallacy where it's like i lost\nsome money like now i gotta get it back\nbecause as things start going i see\nzelfuriously taking notes this is the\npart that zell has been waiting for\n[Laughter]\ndon't worry bro you can by all means\ntake notes\num\nit just helps me\nthink i i was i was not trying to\nembarrass you i was trying to applaud\nyou and just appreciate that everyone in\nthis group is different which is exactly\nwhy we have you all here\nright\nso\nwhat we're going to try to do is first\nof all it's good to share all these\nexperiences it's good to have some of\nthese like you know different\ncomparisons and stuff like that that's\nall healthy and good\nand at the end of the day what i would\nlike to do is help y'all first of all be\nauthentic because i think what we're\nseeing on the internet\nis\nthings were getting really click-baity\nfor a while\nyeah and\nhow do y'all feel about clickbait\ni feel scammed\nwell said\nit's like on one hand i'm like happy\nthat it brings some kind of success to\nsomeone because i like seeing people\nsucceed\nand on the other hand you know i just\nthink to myself about like the\ni guess ingenuity or inauthenticity that\nis more than likely behind it\num and\ni wonder like\nif deep down that's like something that\nyou know said person is like truly\nsatisfied with or\ni don't know i i wonder these things so\nhere's the thing with clickbait it gives\nus dopamine but our higher order brain\nfunctions recognize we're being scammed\nand so there's a hunger this is what i'm\nnoticing\nso if you look at like content trends on\nthe internet they're kind of like\nswinging\nand i think people are really valuing\nauthenticity on the internet in a way\nthat they didn't used to\ncase in point like we opened up the\nsession and ruby was like i got this\nreally heartfelt message because the\ninternet is becoming a cheap place\nand there's a group of people and this\ngroup is growing and i think it's\nactually like the majority\nand yet we're still a little bit\naddicted to the dopaminergic cycle of\nclicking on things and stuff like that\nso it's not that clickbait isn't\neffective\nbut i think part of what makes people\nsuccessful on twitch is that creators\ntend to be like pretty authentic\nso this is not if you look at like\ncelebrities and like twitch streamers or\ncertain kinds of content creators\nthere's a certain like\nlevel of access and authenticity like\nthe fact that you know you do show up\nwhen you're post covid and you're not\nfeeling really well\nor you know i was talking with someone\nrecently about a particular streamer\nthat we're all three of us are content\ncreators in a particular realm and we're\ntalking about a particular streamer why\nthe streamer is so successful because\nthey're not the best skilled person at\nthe game\nbut they rage every now and then not too\nmuch\nbut they rage and what that does is\nresonates with the rage with everyone\nwho plays that game\nbecause we see in this streamer a piece\nof ourselves\nand like literally that's what the\nmessage that ruby got i heard metric\ntalk\nand i saw a piece of myself inside that\nperson and i never realized that like\ni wasn't alone in feeling this way and\nthis is how i felt\nand so this is where i i don't so i'm\nnot the most successful content creator\nby any means right so if you want to\nrise to the top you may not want to take\nmy advice\nbut what i what we have helped a lot of\ncontent creators do is become more\nsuccessful and do it in a healthy\nfashion\nand i think a big part of that is like\nunderstanding kind of who you are why\nyou're making content\nrecognizing that i hate to break it to\nyou all but if you really do want to\ngrow like consistent effort is a part of\nit\nyou can strike lightning once or twice\nand generally speaking\nyou know content creators will do that\nlike if you'll\nyou'll get something will happen you'll\nwind up on the top of lsf like whatever\nand you'll get an influx of people\nyou know\nbut there is a certain amount of\nconsistency and this is what you all\nhave all learned i think right like so\neven though ruby i think ruby's like a\ngood example i keep on bringing up ruby\nbecause she was so detailed with like\nhow she was doing stuff on a day-to-day\nbasis\nbut what amount of that is like\ndiminishing returns do you actually have\nto do it all\nbecause my goal here is to help you all\nbe\nbetter content creators more successful\ncontent creators and healthier\nand that's what we're really going to\nfocus on\nyes ruby\ncan i say that when i\nlet go of doing\nall of that stuff and just streamed\nit felt\nit took a few weeks but it felt like the\nbiggest exhale of my life\nand\num\nactually my stream got better\nabsolutely\ni was focusing on the right things\nabsolutely\nand so this is another i think that\nechoes kind of or lays into my next\npoint which is\nit's my belief that\nto be successful in content creation\nactually what you have to do is offer\nvalue\nit's not about click bait it's about\nvalue and and i think that that's where\nlike for whatever reason each and every\none of you has offered value at some\npoint and in some way and to try to\nreally understand what is the value that\nwe're offering\nand there are two words for this right\nso there's like the good word and lean\ninto that\nor\nthere's the corporate word maximize it\nboth are the same thing\nso i think each and every one of us has\na particular kind of like approach to\nthings in terms of are we thinking about\nit in terms of mathematics or kind of\nlike spirituality right there's kind of\nthis dichotomy between like numbers and\nmetrics and stuff but i think at the end\nof the day\nyou know my hope is that we do share\nthese experiences i think we're learning\na lot about what are the issues but i\nwant people to come away with like\nconcrete understanding of\nhow many days should i take off\ni want us to focus our direction on\nand now we'll get to another important\npoint like so sharing\nis a part of the value\nbut the real value that y'all are going\nto get is not by just hearing what other\npeople\nsay it's when other people start to ask\nyou\nquestions and bring out what you really\nneed to be motivated by\nso what i want to see is people asking\nruby what was that process actually like\nwe know that zell needs details\nright\nso like\nwhat was the falling apart like what did\nit feel like what did you do how did you\ndecide to do asmr instead of other stuff\nwhat is the relationship between being a\nsound therapist learning this kind of\nthing this kind of thing this kind of\nthing and your asmr\nright\nit's like asking all those questions and\ntrying to understand okay like what is\nthe formula here because if we put\ntogether all the pieces that everyone\nhas we'll get a formula\nnow this is going to have to be adapted\nto you so then it's we're also going to\nask questions like we're going to ask\nkathy like\nyou know what's it like are you pretty\nhappy with abc always be chilling and\nand you know how did you decide that you\ndidn't want to do more or do you want to\ndo more do you have regrets around that\ndid you know is there a part of you that\nis there something you had to grieve\nwhen you went through that process or\nare you kind of content with that or you\nlike you know\nwhat's going on there\nand in terms of like metric and zell\nlike zell like i'm getting the sense\nthat zell is hungry\ny'all feeling that\nzell are you hungry\ni did eat a little just a little bit so\nhe's still hungry\nhe wants more\nright so when zell responds with a joke\ni don't know if i hit a nerve or i\nmissed a nerve\nright so i don't know if i'm off base or\ntoo close to home\ni i don't think you're too close i think\nyou're straight on though i am i am a\nhungry person\nyeah right so\nso like like it's our job\nto not just talk about feelings\nbut if zell is hungry\nand he's tired i'm gonna say something\nkind of brutal\nright but these are the words that i've\nheard you'll use if he's tired of being\na has-been\nwe're not saying he is\nbut if that's how he feels\nor maybe he is\nand if he is like that's a\nresponsibility that we're gonna pick up\nwe're not gonna pretend\nwe're not gonna pretend if that's the\nway that he feels and he's unsatisfied\nwith where he is in life\nthis is where we have to decide as a\ngroup i mean i'm i'm putting that on you\nbut when i run a group like it's not\nabout\nhelping zell with his feelings\nit's about helping him do something that\nhe can be proud of\nit's not just like massaging his\nfeelings into the oblivion it's about\nlike okay so what's that plan gonna be\nright and for each and every one of you\nto think a little bit about okay what\nare your goals what are your challenges\nand we're going to\nhelp you with those things\ni do a good job at like identifying the\nthings i know i need to work on and it\nsits there in the back of my head and\nthen i don't make a plan to like\nactually do anything about it so okay\nwhat are we gonna do about that y'all\nwell i want actionable goals\num\nthat like\ni can like compare to last like the last\ntime i did it or the time before that\nand feel like i did it even better or at\nleast get some sort of practice out of\nit\num\ni mean you were like mentioning me\nalongside zelle i feel like\nlike there's this like\nmotivational speech that's circulating\naround tick tock and\nit's about balling your fists up and\ngetting into a fist fight to get what\nyou want and like\ni want to fight like i want to i want my\nstuff i want what's mine i don't want to\nbe denied anymore and i want to stop\ndenying myself\nso\nlike i feel like the biggest thing in\nthe way of getting what i want\nis me\nabsolutely me like every single day\nso\nokay\nhow do people feel our own worst i i'd\nsay we are our own worst critics\nmaybe not all of us\nbut it's not even all of them it's it's\nnot even i am generalizing yeah it's not\nit's not it's not just criticism it's\nlike criticism comes after the fact\nwhere i didn't do the thing that i\nwanted to do or i didn't do it well\nenough it's like\neven like getting in front of the\ngetting the motivation to just do the\nthing right like\nlike\ni'm gonna have x amount of things done\nby tomorrow and then i wake up and i'm\nlike oh my god it's\nthree in the morning where did the day\ngo like\nso i'm gonna check in with ruby and\nkathy because i'm getting\na certain energy from smirky merc metric\nand zell\ni just don't know if it just happens to\nbe a gender breakdown\nbut\nyou know so how do y'all feel about what\nmetric zell and smirky do you all feel\nlike that's kind of resonating with you\nare you hungry do you want to set goals\nfor yourself are you your own worst\nenemy\ni wouldn't be surprised if your\nexperience of where you are right now is\ndifferent\ni mean i feel like that\nyeah so let's talk about let's give ruby\nand kathy a chance to share where they\nare\nyeah i've felt like that and i know that\nfeeling but that just will lead me back\nto the hamster wheel\nexcellent okay so where are you right\nnow ruby\num i have a lot of goals and i know what\ni want to do and where i want to go\num part of it is\nuh confidence within myself to be able\nto fully realize my goals\nand i've also learned that\num\njust myself and\ni i feel like i'm constantly bringing up\nadhd but it's like my whole life i've\nrealized it affects everything\num\nyou know metric was like oh i wanted to\ndo this many things in a day i've\nstopped doing that to myself\nbecause\nit leads to feeling bad or feeling like\ni didn't\nget to the end of that day list that i\nwanted to get done\nso then i will stay up late and i will\npush myself too far\num\nlike i'm in a pretty good place\nphysically now but um\nat one point in my life i was diagnosed\nwith chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia\num which was\npart of my yoga journey to getting\nback moving again because they just kept\ntelling me to go for walks and i was\nlike you want me to go for a walk i'll\ngo do yoga um so\nyeah i\ni know that\nhaving too many things on my plate and\ngetting back into that place again is\ngonna take me into like\nyeah that i'm i'm hungry but not in the\nsame way i don't\ni have a i have a thing online and i\nplan everything out i'm working on and\nwhat i need to be working on\nand\ni kind of just i will get done when it\ngets done and if something's not\nresonating with me\nand like that doesn't mean like i'm a\nflaky hippie\nlike\ni'm getting stuff done\nbut if i put too much pressure on myself\nthat's when it all goes wrong and then\ni'm back in the machine again yep like\nso\nso this is where i think we're gonna\nso here's what i would like us to help\nruby with\nis\nand i think this is gonna apply to all\nof us right so how do we find the sweet\nspot of pressure\nso there's this term in science called\nuse stress so we hear about distress all\nthe time\nit turns out that if you don't put\nenough pressure on yourself or things\nare not challenging enough\nthen we wind up in boredom\nand if we push ourselves too hard we end\nup in distress\nbut if you look at optimal performance\nacross fields whether you're talking\nabout medicine or esports or like\nathletic performance there's a window of\nwhat we call eustress\nthat brings out the optimal performance\nso i want you all to think about you\nknow like people who are competing in\nthe grand finals of let's say\na video game tournament there's like a\nsweet spot of stress where if you want\nto play your best\nin that game there needs to be some\namount of pressure on you\nand what i'm hearing from ruby is that\nshe learned the hard way that she was\nputting way too much pressure on herself\nand now she's pulled back a lot has kind\nof checked in with who she is is\ncreating content from a healthier place\nand is doing better\nand at the same time we want to be\ncareful about you know is it possible\nfor her to put more healthy pressure on\nherself without winding up on the\nhamster wheel she may have actually\nalready found the balance we don't know\nbut that's definitely something we can\nkind of think about and talk about\nwhere are you with the stuff kathy oh\nsorry al go ahead\ni just had a question because like\nso from my perspective when i hear that\ni'm like i'm sure everyone has different\ntolerances to eustress and when it\nbecomes distress and then like\nis it symptomatically bad if you feel\nlike you need a lot of stress in order\nto feel like you're functioning at your\noptimal you know like\nbecause\nwhen i hear that i was like i think i'm\ngenerally somebody who just likes to be\nunder pressure\nbut is that also just symptomatic of\nsomething that's worse going on you know\nso that was kind of where my brain went\nthe short answer i'm going to say zell i\nknow it's going to be kind of weird is\nprobably\nso here's what we tend to do as human\nbeings since we don't we're not very\nreflective about stress and the\nrelationship with our motivation\nwhat we default to\nis excessive stress to motivate us\nso i'll give you all just a simple\nexample i don't know if you all have\never had to cram for a final exam\nright so most people cram for final\nexams and so what is the motivational\nenergy that we use to\nlike study it's like a\nexcessive stress\nso like a lot of us will naturally learn\nto put ourselves in excessively\nstressful situations\nin order to like\nprovide dirty motivation\nand then we become reliant on that\nbecause then i start to think to myself\nafter i procrastinate and i study for\nthe final and i do okay next semester i\ndo the same thing next semester i do the\nsame thing then i make a statement like\nzell made\nwhich is i need to be\nunhealthily stressed in order to be\nproductive\nso that may be a statement of truth\nin the past\nand i would hope that we can help you be\nmore productive with less stress\nand this is where thoughtfulness\nand kind of being a little bit careful\nabout understanding ourselves and how we\nact and how we function and stuff\nhopefully we can get there i feel pretty\nconfident about that\nso sharing experiences is fantastic\nbut we got to start thinking a little\nbit about what do we want to get out of\nthis and how can we frame that and sort\nof build\nalmost a plan for ourselves\nkathy we haven't given you a chance\nwhere are you with all this stuff\num in terms of the hunger you say i\nguess\nuh ambition i think i'm channeling that\nmore towards work\nbecause for work yeah i want to get\nthings done i'm very open to\nopportunities\nnetworking but i don't really feel the\nsame way about that for\num\nstreaming\nokay that makes sense\nyeah so yeah so my expectations i guess\nare a little different because i did a\nlot of soul searching before this i had\nto like write down a pros and cons list\nlike now what makes me happy like i\ndon't want to be someone who's like\nunhappy\nand\njust like\nsuper stressed out all the time\nand i realized like you know working\nmore behind the scenes in the gaming\nindustry is something that i\nfound more value in for myself\ni mean it might not ring true for other\npeople but you know you have different\nperspectives\n100 so i'm going to say a couple things\nthey may sound kind of weird\nso the first is that kathy if you've\ngone through this process\nlet's and you feel pretty good about\nwhere you are that's fantastic\nyou your role in this group at least at\nthe beginning\nmay be a little bit different\nbecause you've already gone through the\nprocess\nso we may want\ni would encourage you to share a little\nbit more about what has worked for you\nthe other thing to think about is that\nas we talk about this stuff\nyou may feel like a little bit of an\noutsider if you're already kind of\nfurther along which implies that\neveryone's on the same road so just let\nus know if you start to feel that way it\ndoesn't mean that you don't belong here\nor anything like that\nand then the last kind of thing that i\nkind of put to the group and also put to\nyou is that we're also here to help you\nwe're here to help you think about what\nyour goals are clarify what your goals\nare\num things like that and so it may\nrequire a little bit more work on all of\nour parts\nbecause if everyone's kind of vibing\naround this and you're like eh\ni'm kind of abc always be chilling\nand so it's going to require a little\nbit more work on everyone's part to\nfirst of all inquire in terms of like\nyou know what growth looks like for you\nover the course of the next eight weeks\num\nso you may have to volunteer more or\nshare more with if there's something\nthat you're kind of working on or\nthinking through\nand then we may have to like inquire\nmore\nthe last thing to kind of consider which\ni want to be very very careful about is\nthat if your ambition in the workplace\nis really where your your mind is\nthen we're more than happy to help you\nwith that the main concern that i have\nwith that is that you have a job\nin the gaming industry and i wouldn't\nwant anything about the way that you\nframe the situation or anything like\nthat to negatively impact your career\nwithin the gaming industry right so this\nis live streamed and if you're saying\nlike oh like\ni want to get promoted but my colleague\nis\nyou know\nshady like we don't want to get you in\ntrouble so we have to be very careful\naround that kind of boundary whereas\nlike i think with content creation and\nstuff it's like a little bit safer\num i just kind of want to acknowledge\nthat but we do do a lot of stuff we see\nthis i don't know if y'all are familiar\nbut we have a career coaching program\nwhich is actually doing really well it's\nsomething that where we recently\nlaunched and we manage a lot of\ncorporate climbing kind of issues in\nthere so that's definitely something we\ncan talk about and help you with but i\njust want to be a little bit cautious on\nyour behalf about whether that's\nactually safe to do here\nthoughts reflections\nyou okay with that\ni'm fine with that um if anything i\ncould also draw on past work experiences\ntoo um everything will be probably\nanonymous sure most likely yeah so so we\njust don't want to do anything that's\nactually gonna you know hurt your career\nin any way\nokay so\num\nlet's\ni'm gonna give y'all homework did you\nhow'd y'all feel about homework last\ntime was that okay\ndid it feel excessive to people do you\nall want more less structure\nit it didn't feel excessive to me okay\nyeah it was good so i'm gonna give you\nall some homework for this week so what\nabout you\nis holding you back\nand see writing this down please\nthey did it last time\nwe could we can uh send it on our group\ndm\nthank you\nso\nand then i i want to kind of give you\nall some some wiggle room there the\nother thing that you can sort of really\nthink about is\nwhen we talk about holding you back it\npresumes\nthat you want to\ngo somewhere\nright\nso like\npart of that discussion and this could\nbe just as good is is where do you want\nto go\nnow these are sort of purposely left to\nbe open-ended\nwe'll probably be a little bit more\nformal with how we come back so i\nunderstand we're probably taking next\nweek off is that correct everyone\nbecause i think a lot of people are\ngoing to packs\nthat's correct awesome so we're going to\ntake next week off so i'm giving you all\nsomething that's a little bit more\nsubstantive for those of you all that\nwant more guidelines\nwhat i would say is i'll type this out\nbut i would say like literally write up\none page on\neither or both of these topics\nso i think a solid like you know 300 to\n400 words\nwill probably be really really good you\ncan you know write it physically you\ndon't have to write if you don't want to\nyou can think about it or take notes but\nin my experience when you write things\nyou may think you know what the answer\nis at the beginning of the page but by\nthe end almost everyone uncovers\nsomething that they were not expecting\nwhat we'll also do next week is maybe\ndepending on how we'll check in\nand presuming that stuff hasn't happened\nthat we need to kind of address we'll\nstart to think a little bit about what\nwe want and what's holding us back and\nkind of dig into that in a more formal\nway\nokay\nquestions awesome\nokay\nclosing thoughts reflections do we\nunderstand what we're doing here how do\npeople feel about it\ni'm i'm enjoying these sessions a lot\nand\nlike i already like think about things\nlike my hamster wheel is always running\num\nbut um i guess it kind of in a good way\nexemplifies it it's making me critically\nthink about like\ncertain things that maybe i didn't think\nabout before\ngood\nyeah i've been having a great time so\ni'm i'm feeling less alone\num which\ni've kind of\nnot that like i i didn't have people to\ntalk to or anything like that or even\nother streamer friends to talk to but\nthis is a kind of a bit more intimate\nsetting\nthat\nit\nyeah it did kind of\ni don't i don't know what the words are\ni'm sorry but yeah\ncool um yeah i'm really enjoying it and\nappreciating it and um\nyeah i don't know if less alone is that\nwhen you said it i felt like\nthe same but i'm like i don't know if i\nfeel this alone i don't\ni don't really talk to anyone about\nstuff it's nice to talk to people that\ndo do other things to me because i don't\nreally have anyone who does what i do\nthat i actually want to listen\nbecause a lot of\nother streamers that i know\num\nlike kind of dismiss me\nit's maybe that's how i feel\nbut it's nice to feel listen to\nyeah it's good to like listen to other\nstories um and like\nyou know it's kind of like the\nintersection of all these different\npeople different backgrounds and it's\nlike\nyou know we can find some like really\ninteresting stuff to talk about and i\nthink that's really power\ncool\num yeah i've been enjoying these\nsessions as well\num and when i say that i do prioritize\nwork that doesn't mean like content\ncreation is just\nin the garbage bin for me like i am\ninterested on\nlike trying out new things like maybe i\nwill\nedit or manufacture things later on if i\nif i find like\nbecause like one of my biggest problems\nis i think i get very unmotivated\nsometimes or i'm like depressed here and\nthere which is kind of one of the\nreasons why i was\nreaching out for\nthose coaching sessions\num with your company so i i recognize\nthere's a lot of things i need to work\non cool and\nhave you all gotten uh mental health\nsupport information in terms of clinical\nstuff have you all received that yet\nokay so we'll get on that so i think\nwe're gonna send you all something\nshortly about um you know if you all are\nstruggling with things like depression\nor adhd or things like that we'll\ntry to help you all connect with people\nif y'all if that's something you're\ninterested in\nokay appreciate it absolutely thank you\nawesome so\num\nyou know thank you all very much for\ncoming i i know it's just week two\nuh so i think it's gonna be\nit tends to be a meandering kind of\nuh road that we walk i don't know if\nwe're gonna get to all eight of the\nteaching points but one thing that i'm\nsort of definitely think we need to\ntouch on i think point number eight is\nbeing in the business of friendship\num\ni think that's point number eight right\ni don't remember where it is but i think\nthis is this is definitely something\nthat\ni think we should talk about at some\npoint i think right now we're going to\nstill focus on ourselves a little bit\nbut i think relationships as metric was\nkind of pointing out like sometimes\npeople don't message you quite as much\nruby's sort of noticing that people will\nyou know not be kind of open welcoming\ndiscussing\nand so content creation is very\ninteresting because y'all are in the\nbusiness of friendship\nand so it's really interesting because\nlike you know when someone wants to\nreach out to collab\nyou know it's like who are like\nis this am i getting invited because\nthis person likes me or\nis it because of my viewer base or what\nand conversely we've also heard from\ncontent creators that i'm a small\ncontent creator i hung out with a large\ncontent creator i actually genuinely\nlike this person and i want to hang out\nwith them for personal reasons\nbut i'm terrified that if i ask them to\ndo something they will think\nthat i'm i'm clout chasing\nright so at some point we can definitely\ntalk a little bit about how to navigate\nyou know relationships in the content\ncreation world\num\nsomething we also have explored quite a\nbit\nso and if other topics kind of jump out\nto you and stuff like that please kind\nof you know let us know pitch them\nforward if you're feeling kind of left\nout or you're feeling like you're not\ngetting much from the group let the\ngroup know\nand i i know that we're still i'm i'm\nkind of maybe pushing\ni'll all ease up a little bit but at\nsome point we got to start challenging\neach other and and you know\nit can't just be all positive\nall the time\nprobably still two or three two weeks\nbefore we get there but and y'all are\nalso welcome to say hey i don't think\nthat we're doing a good job i feel like\nyou know y'all can criticize me too\nso\nthank you all very much for coming um\ni'm super optimistic uh really\nappreciate everyone's input and it's\nawesome to have people who share so much\nand are also so different\nso that i think is going to be really\nwhat makes this\nvery worthwhile for everyone involved\nthank you all very much\nthank you for having us thank you\neveryone thank you thank you chaos\nbye farewell\nyou"
