    "transcript": "they sort of can't swap tasks so once\nyou have one task on deck once you have\nlike one active task\nyou can't table it for other tasks and\ncome back to it later so today we're\ngonna be running we're going to be going\nthrough a couple of things we're going\nto be talking about we're going to be\nreacting to some adhd tick tocks so\ntalking a little bit about adhd and then\nwe're also going to be talking a little\nbit about\nwhy we sometimes just feel relief\ninstead of accomplishment when we do\nsomething\nright so sometimes we have this idea\nthat like when i accomplish something i\nshould feel accomplished\nbut sometimes when we accomplish things\nall we feel is relief like when you\nyou're you're panicking about the final\npanicking about the final exam and then\nyou take the final exam and you don't\nsay like yay i did it it's like oh my\ngod i'm thank god that's over\nand so it's really challenging because\nif you're living a life where all of\nyour actual accomplishments just feel\nlike\nrelief\ninstead of any kind of achievement it\ncan be really hard to kind of motivate\nyourself and so we're going to be\ntalking a little bit about that\nwe're also going to be talking a little\nbit about anger today so i think anger\nis one of the emotions that we haven't\ntouched on\ntoo much\num i think anger is a really really\ninteresting emotion we're gonna kind of\ndive into what makes anger kind of\nunique is an emotion and so\nhopefully that'll be helpful\nokay so let's dive in\nso\ni'm seeing that people are having\ndifferent kinds of responses to this\nright so this is kind of an interesting\nperspective on adhd\npeople kind of call this i think white\nnoise or even like warm brown noise is\none of the terms\num\nand so one of the things that is kind of\ninteresting is that when when people\nmake tick tocks like this they'll say\nthat this has been scientifically proven\nto be effective\nand for some people you know we're\nseeing a variety of different responses\nsome people are feeling very very\ndifferent some people are feeling not\ndifferent at all some people actually\nfeel like this is troublesome because it\nactually like triggers their tinnitus\nlike symptoms or reminds them of\ntinnitus or tinnitus\nand so i'd love to talk a little bit\nabout you know how scientifically valid\nthis is and actually what's going on\nbecause this is a really interesting\nprinciple of adhd\nso it turns out that this is actually\nhas some scientific validation so\nneuropsychological and\nneurophysiological effects from white\nnoise in children with and without adhd\nso this is a really interesting paper\nit's in the public domain you all can\naccess it yourselves\nbut\nit is interesting because people have\ndone studies on the effect of white\nnoise for people with adhd and what they\nsort of discovered is that sometimes\nwhite noise can help people with adhd\nand the reason for that is really\nfascinating\nso if you take\nsomeone with adhd what you find is that\ntheir adhd symptoms\nfluctuate with the environment\nand the more boring of an environment\nthe less stimulus you have in the\nenvironment the worse the adhd becomes\nso i'll give you all kind of a simple\nexample if i take a kid with adhd\nand i if i take two kids with adhd and i\nput one in a room with a chair and\nabsolutely nothing else\nand i take another kid and put them in a\nroom with a chair and some toys and some\nother things let's say it's like a\nseven-year-old kid we'll see that these\nkids behave very very differently\nand generally speaking the less stimulus\nso when we get into very very low\nstimulus environments those kids will be\nfidgety more they'll have difficulty\npaying attention and essentially there's\na theory that suggests that there's an\noptimal level of function for kids with\nadhd and they will\nstimulate or create different kinds of\nstimulus by moving around or making\nnoises or wandering around or exploring\nthings to try to get their threshold up\nto an optimal stimulus level\nand if you provide appropriate stimuli\nthen the adhd behaviors will actually go\ndown so the interesting thing about the\nwhite noise\nkind of perspective or warm brown noise\nor dark brown noise or whatever you call\nit is that there is some scientific\nevidence that\nsome amount of increased stimulus will\nactually help people with adhd focus\nmore because you're sort of getting out\nof that low stimulus period where the\nadhd is looking for something to kind of\njump into\nnow the interesting thing is that this\ncan be contrasted\nwith too much stimulus so we're going to\ntake a quick look at what that looks\nlike i'm starving let's go to the\nkitchen get some food\nin the kitchen\ni still didn't put away the rest of the\ngroceries okay let's get that done quick\ni'm serving bread let's grab the bread\nmaybe\ni forgot tortillas again i want a\nquesadilla yeah whatever i'll get them\nnext time\nit's just so boring what's next what's\nnext could make a smoothie smoothies are\nreally good is that bowl still sitting\nthere okay wonderful things that's been\nsitting there look at those so like\nnotice what's happening here is this\nperson moves around right they're\nincreasing the amount of stimulus that\nthey have access to\ntheir mind is moving towards different\nthings\nis the vase\nthey're kind of having trouble focusing\nright they're doing a little bit of this\nand a little bit of that\nsuch a gross feeling\nperfect how can she think of so many\ntrains of thought at once that's\nactually the challenge is that it's not\nreally so many trains of thought at once\nit's actually\n[Music]\ndon't forget the meeting i have that\nmeeting soon i should really go and get\nready for that so much work maybe it\ncomes from the latin word pilla\ni feel like i'm forgetting something\nflowers flowers i need to go and put the\nflowers right so i feel like i'm\nforgetting something so this is like\nanother good example\nof this stimulus balance\nso what i found working with people with\nadhd is that if you're under stimulated\nby your environment your mind will start\nto wander and you'll try to create\nself-stimulating kind of things you'll\nwiggle around you'll fidget you'll get\ndistracted stuff like that and so the\nthe research on things like white noise\nsuggests that what you can actually do\nis if you're under stimulated what\nthat's what you're going to do if you\nhave adhd or sometimes is that you'll\ncreate other stimuli for yourself to get\nto your optimal level\nthe interesting thing is that if you go\nabove the optimal level you have what we\nsee in this next tick tock\nwhich is an over stimulated environment\nwhere as you're getting okay i'm\nthinking about this grocery list i'm\nthinking about this you know set of\nflowers i got to do this i got to take\nmy pills i gotta unload my groceries\nand and so as you move around the\nenvironment you're getting bombarded\nwith lots of stimuli and as you get\nbombarded with lots of stimuli your adhd\nsymptoms can't really cope with that\nand you can't focus on one thing\nso if you want to sit down and do some\nwork what you actually find\nis that there's an optimal level of\nstimulus balance which most people with\nadhd will find so white noise is a\nreally good example of you know upping\nif you're on the low end cleaning up\nyour room and removing a lot of\ndistracting stimuli is a good example of\nwhat you can do if you're over\nstimulated and getting distracted\nbut the key thing here is that it\nappears that through research on like\nyou know on people with adhd and people\nwithout adhd what we find is there's an\noptimal level of stimulus which allows\nyou to focus best if you have adhd\nthe really tricky thing i saw there was\na question about social media and\ntechnology\nwhat's really devastating is that we're\nliving in a society now where technology\nis crippling people with adhd\nbecause what happens is is in the past\nlike let's say i'm trying to study and\ni'm in a library and so as i is as i'm\nunder stimulated i'll start to get\ndistracted and move around and things\nlike that the problem is with the easy\naccess of technology and with how\naddictive technology is to the adhd mind\nit's really easy to slip into that\nstimulus and get caught up in it for\nhours at a time\nso what's happening is as you try to\nfocus with adhd and you don't have\nenough stimulus you'll reach for your\nphone\nand then a 15 second distraction because\nof the way that things get populated and\nthere's this post and that post even as\nwe're looking at tick tock\ni want you all to notice what tick tock\nbombards me with right\nso like even as i look at this there's\njust not one thing there's some\nrecommended videos over here with\nscreenshots all right if i if i mouse\nover them there's like more stimulus\nand what i'm going to do is i'm going to\nlook at this i'm going to look at this\nlike i'm going to look at this stuff\nover here there's comments\nso what's happening right now is as my\nmind is seeking stimulus it finds a ton\nof it\nif i slip into technology usage and then\nthe problem becomes since these\nplatforms are so good at accommodating\nmy shifting attention they reward me for\nclicking on lots of different things\nright and then i've got the central\nvideo which then holds my attention for\na minute and i click on this thing and i\nclick on this thing and i click on this\nthing\nso what we're sort of seeing in society\nis that people with adhd are actually\nbeing like crippled their symptoms are\ngetting worse\nmore people are being diagnosed with it\nbecause technology sort of takes\nadvantage of this stimulus of this lack\nof stimulus balance\nso if you're someone who's kind of\nstruggling with this these are both very\ncommon experiences where some amount of\nincreased stimulus if it's kind of\nthoughtful and can't distract you can\nactually improve your focus and there's\nresearch that actually supports that and\nwe also see the opposite as well which\nis that if you're over stimulated and\nthere's too much sensory input that will\nactually worsen your symptoms so there's\neven research that shows that people\nwith adhd who operate or try to work in\nclean spaces are able to focus more and\nthere's a bunch of stuff on on we kind\nof cover this in more detail in dr k's\nguide but about top down versus bottom\nup kind of stimulus\nstuff and sort of attentional control\nand so\nboth of these things are are kind of\ntrue right where you're over stimulated\nit's going to distract you if you're\nunder stimulated you're going to create\ndistractions to get to your optimal\nstimulus balance so if you're in this\nkind of situation it's really important\nto think a little bit about okay what's\nmy optimal stimulus balance and what are\nthings that i can kind of do to increase\nit if i'm under stimulated\nbut also use things that are not going\nto lead to further distractions like\ntechnology\nwhat's the scientific evidence\nso there's a lot of scientific evidence\nit's two things that y'all can look at\none is um you know we said we took a\nlook at this paper which is pretty\npreliminary but there seems to be some\nevidence to support this\nso you all can look at the optimal\nstimulation theory and moderate brain\narousal model\nthose are\ntwo\nmodels that have been studied in adhd\nand for the other side i would look at\ntop-down versus bottom-up attentional\ncontrol studies\nso those are kind of the two things that\nwe've sort of explored scientifically\nwhich seem to have some support\nlet's keep going i thought you said you\nhad a busy day today yeah i'm in adhd\nparalysis what's that my brain\nphysically won't let me do anything what\ncaused it sometimes nothing causes it\nbut today it's because i have a package\nthat's coming at 8 pm you can't do\nanything before that package comes yeah\ni like to call it my waiting mode you're\nnot just being lazy no my brain's\ncurrently going like a thousand miles\nper hour telling me i should be doing\nthings but can't yeah i'm in so adhd\nparalysis is a really interesting\nphenomenon um it's something that hasn't\nbeen that well studied\nso like there are aspects of this that\nhave been well studied and aspects of\nthis that haven't been really that well\nstudied and what i tend to find is that\nwhen we look at things like adhd\nparalysis there's a lot of low quality\ninformation like opinions and and you\nknow the stick talk is actually pretty\ngood because i think it's representative\nof people's experiences\nbut for example a lot of people will\ncorrelate adhd paralysis with\nprocrastination\nright so they'll kind of say like oh i'm\nputting off tasks i can't focus on\nanything you know if you've got 10\nthings to do today\nand you're getting a package delivery at\n8pm i'm putting off those other things\nso that feels like procrastination so\nthis once again is my opinion i did some\nresearch into this phenomenon and really\ndidn't find great scientific studies\nabout this so i think what we're doing\nis we're sort of learning more about\nnovel features of adhd as people are\ngetting more diagnosed and it's becoming\nmore of an issue and especially adults\nwith adhd because this kind of like task\nparalysis if you look at the original\nresearch on adhd was done mostly in\nchildren\nright so adhd for a long time was\nspecifically kind of a childhood\ndiagnosis and as more and more adults\nare getting diagnosed with it we're sort\nof discovering different manifestations\nof it so what's going on with adhd\nparalysis\nso the first thing is in my experience\nas a clinician once again this is an\nopinion okay\nwhat we do sort of know is that this\nprobably has to do with an executive\nfunction deficit so what we know about\nadhd is that it's a neurodevelopmental\ndisorder and what that sort of means is\nthat the brains of people with adhd seem\nto develop in a different way\nand one of the ways in which they\ndevelop differently is in their frontal\nlobes so the frontal lobes are\nresponsible for something called\nexecutive function executive function is\nour ability to plan and execute tasks\nand people with adhd struggle with this\nso what's happening in in if we sort of\ntake a neurotypical person is if they've\ngot\nsomething to do at 8 pm what they can\nsort of do is like they can plan up to 8\npm so if i've got 10 things to do today\nand one of them is 8 pm my brain is good\nat automatically sequencing those tasks\nso i can do this at 10 am this at 1 pm\nthis at 5 pm and this at 8 pm and all of\nmy stuff will get done i'll sort of be\nor i'll be efficient you know i'll leave\nsix things for tomorrow but i can get\nthese four things done today\nwhat we tend to find in executive\ndysfunction is that this sequencing is\nkind of a problem and the simplest way\nthat i would describe it in terms of my\nclinical work with people\nis that they sort of can't swap tasks so\nonce you have one task on deck once you\nhave like one active task\nyou can't table it for other tasks and\ncome back to it later so in my\nexperience this is actually a sequencing\nproblem where once you've got something\nin your mind you can't set it down and\ndo other things\nand so what this ends up as is what\npeople call kind of colloquially adhd\nparalysis or task paralysis which is if\ni've got one thing at 3 pm i can't do\nanything else\nand you may think well that's that\nsounds you know like it\nyou know it sounds like a real problem\nand it sort of is in terms of function\nbut there may actually be a very good\nreason for that and that's where\nremember that if if we get distracted\nright so this is the challenge with adhd\nif we get distracted we may not remember\nthings we may not come back to things\nsince our brain can't sequence and kind\nof execute on tasks in in time what we\nsort of do is our brain sort of almost\nlearns that\nokay this is the task that i've got on\ndeck it's almost like your brain can't\nsave something and close a document and\nopen it up later that if you come back\nto a task that you left you know alone\nif you tried to close the document it\ndoesn't save any of the progress that\nyou made which is also another really\nreally common experience for people with\nadhd which is that they have difficulty\nwith task completion because any time\nthey get distracted when they go back to\nthe task they can't pick up where they\nleft off\nand so i want y'all to just think about\nthis for a second if your brain can't\npick up efficiently where you left off\nwhat is the adaptation going to actually\nbe\ndon't get distracted\ndon't lose sight of it you can't ever\nput it down we're operating with a word\ndocument or some kind of word processor\nthat can never save so what does that\nmean that means once the task comes on\ndeck\nwe have to hold on to it and we can't\nlet anything else get in the way\nso in my experience with working with\npeople with adhd this adhd paralysis\nactually has to do with an inability to\nsequence out and pick up tasks so that's\nwhere there are the good news is that\nthere's some organizational tools that\nyou can sort of do and you can use and\nthis is something that we i think this\ntic-tac represents well is that this\nperson is just using their mind or their\nbrain\nto do all the work\nright there's no and this is what we\nkind of see if you look at actually\ntreatment\nfor adhd adhd treatment is really\ninteresting because a lot of what if you\nlook at cognitive behavioral therapy for\nadhd a lot of it is not like talking\nabout your feelings or discussing your\ntraumas or things like that it's\nactually more education and teaching\npeople how to build like uh you know a\npriority list how to kind of get\norganized how to build like a task list\nhow to build a to-do list how to sort of\nmake sure that those to-do lists have\ntime anchors\nand things like that so you don't forget\nthings you don't you know you're not and\nyou don't end up with lateness\nand in our adhd guide which is coming\nout soon for example what we sort of\nfocus on is helping people build to-do\nlists that protect against two things\nforget forgetting tasks and being late\non tasks so any kind of organizational\nsystem that you have if you've got adhd\nshould protect against these two\noutcomes is being late and forgetting\nright so stuff should be on time and it\nshouldn't be forgotten\nso if you're struggling with adhd\nparalysis the first thing to kind of\nthink about is think a little bit\ncritically about whether this is the\nsame as procrastination because in my\nexperience procrastination is putting\noff a task purposefully because you're\navoiding something about the task either\nyou're perfectionistic or there's some\nkind of emotion associated with it\nwhereas adhd paralysis is actually a\nsequencing problem it's not that you're\nputting off\nthe other eight tasks because they're\nchallenging in some way it's that your\nbrain is stuck on one task and since\nthat's occupying so much of your ram you\ncan't shift to something else so those\nare actually two very different things\nand what i tend to find in people who\nassociate adhd with procrastination is\nthat they're trying to solve the wrong\nthing which is why their solutions don't\nwork and they continue\nbeing stuck in adhd paralysis does that\nmake sense\ndownload more ram\ngreat point\nso this\nyou all are joking when you say when i\nsee drop me stuff is saying download\nmore ram et cetera\nright so\ncasvot vax is saying download more ram\ny'all are right that that is a solution\nfor a while\nso this is also something to understand\nyou know what the download more ram is\nthe equivalent of in kids with adhd is a\nhigh iq so this is what happens with\nkids with adhd they start to struggle in\nadulthood especially the ones that are\nactually\nabove average intelligence because what\nthey do is they muscle their way\nthrough things using brute force extra\nresources\nso if imagine for example like i'm using\na word processor and i can't save my\ndocuments so what i'm going to do is put\nram into my computer so i can have more\ndocuments open at the same time\nright so you're like literally investing\nmore resources\nin a inefficient process which is\nexactly what happens with smart kids\nwith adhd\nthey just brute force use intelligence i\ncan't pay attention to class so what i\nhave to do is use cognitive reasoning\ninductive reasoning deductive reasoning\nto answer questions when the teacher\ncalls on me i want you all to really\nthink about this if you're a kid with\nadhd when the teacher calls on you and\nyou're not paying attention the\nmiraculous thing is that a lot of adhd\nkids know the right answer anyway\neven though they're not paying attention\nand how how do they know the right\nanswer because they look around they're\nlike oh crap the teacher called on me\nthey look around they look at what's on\nthe board oh we're doing math class i\nsee a problem on the board they're\nasking me a question let me figure out\nwhat the answer is this is the answer\nand you say it in five seconds and the\nteacher's like okay i guess you were\npaying attention no you weren't paying\nattention you were brute forcing things\nwith extra iq\nthis is actually what's really really\nsad about kids with adhd is that as they\ndownload more and more ram they fill up\nall of their you know motherboard slots\nwith ram to try to compensate for not\nbeing able to save documents\nthe problem is at some point your\nmotherboard fills up and as your\nmotherboard fills up and you can't brute\nforce it anymore you're stuck with all\nof this ram and the inability to save\ndocuments so this usually happens in\nadulthood for kids who are very very\nintelligent and have adhd and they hit a\nwall because suddenly you can't pack any\nmore ram\nright like you hit this really hard wall\nand that's what's actually really\ndevastating\nbecause this entire time sometimes\nthey'll even get iq tested right you'll\ntake this five-year-old kid\nwith like very high expectation parents\nand they'll get them iq tested at the\nage of five oh the child is gifted your\nchild has an iq of 140 a bunch of\nexpectation extra classes ap classes\ngifted and talented classes and the kid\nis struggling struggling struggling\nstruggling because they have no hard\ndrive they've got no hard drive\nand they're just packing in ram packing\nand ram packing and ram and so their\nlife becomes harder and harder and\nharder but actually because they're so\nexceptional they can manage it up until\na point\nbut at some point\nyou got to have a hard hard drive you\ngot to have disk space you can't store\neverything in ram\nand that's what they run into this it's\na hard stop for these people it's so\nchallenging\nmake sense\nlet's move on great but i i love i love\nthe memes comments you all don't realize\nlike how epic your comments actually are\ni got three looks\nand that's it\ncould i interest you\num oftentimes\nadhd will manifest in with different\nsymptoms right so people will say oh\ni've got three looks like i've got like\nover sharing talking too much and zoning\nout the interesting thing is that i\nthink all three of those are actually\nkind of the same thing\nso even when you're zoning out\nwhat's going on\nthere's a bunch of stuff going on in\nhere right so there's over sharing which\nis like talking too much\nright are you like you're talking too\nfast and people aren't really able to\npay attention but even when you're\nzoning out it's the same process it's\njust whether your mouth is opening and\nyou're emitting sound or not\nright but mentally the process is the\nsame it's just we've got two modes we've\ngot communication mode or we've got\nsilent mode but on the inside it's\nactually the same distractible\nhigh speed kind of thought process\ndoes that make sense\nis this also relatable to people without\nadhd or do i maybe so this is exactly\nwhy we stream this kind of stuff so\nremember these are tick tocks right\nthese are not diagnostic evaluations or\ndiagnostic criteria or things like this\nbut if this kind of stuff resonates with\nyou i think it's very reasonable to go\nget a clinical evaluation for something\nlike adhd so remember that adhd is a\nspectrum\nokay attention is a spectrum so there's\npeople who have very good attention\npeople have highly distractible\nattention if it's impairing your\nfunction then it's more likely to have\nit be a disorder right so that's\ngenerally speaking the line that we draw\nin psychiatry is does it impair your\nfunction or not\nbut the other thing the other reason\nthat we're doing this is because what\nwe're finding is that attention spans\nseem to be decreasing\nwe know that epidemiologically the\ndiagnosis of adhd seems to be on the\nrise but that begs a really interesting\nquestion\nare more people having adhd or are we\njust get getting better at diagnosing it\nis the amount of people who have adhd\nactually has been the same but we used\nto miss a bunch of people and now we're\njust catching them so we're the\ndiagnosis rate is increasing but it's a\nlittle bit fuzzy is it because we're is\nthere more awareness of it or is\nsomething happening in our society is\nsomething in the water is something\nhappening with technology that is making\nus more adhd and i suspect that the\nanswer is actually a combination of both\nthat if you look at things like\nthe\nuh what can i say like the progression\nof attention span on the internet it's\ngetting shorter\nright so there used to be blogs and\nthey've been replaced by tweets\nand now it's kind of funny funny because\nwe've gone so far on that side that now\nthat we have twit longers and on twitter\nwe'll have like these twitter threads\nright one out of nine two out of nine\nthree out of nine so you're kind of\nswinging back the other way\nif you look at things like you know\nyoutube videos used to be whole videos\nand then we had vines for a little while\nand then we had video essays and things\nlike that and now we're moving towards\nyoutube shorts twitch clips\ntick tocks you know things like that\nshorter form content shorter form\ncontent\nso\nprobably i suspect that it's actually\ndue to technology but i also think we're\ngetting better at diagnosing it so if\nthis stuff resonates with you i highly\nencourage you to you know go get\nevaluated because adhd here's the other\nthing clinical opinion here but in my\nexperience adhd is the most over\ndiagnosed\nand simultaneously\nthe most under diagnosed psychiatric\nillness\nwhat does that mean how can something be\nover diagnosed and under diagnosed\nit's because we miss adhd in a lot of\npeople it's under-diagnosed because we\nhave the smart kids\nwho compensate\nright so they have adhd but since they\ncompensate with iq we miss the diagnosis\nthe other reason that it's over\ndiagnosed is that there's studies that\nshow that for example\nthe more kids in a classroom the more\nlikely they are to get diagnosed with\nadhd\nso when you have other kinds of\nattentional problems when you've got you\nknow parents who for example don't teach\ntheir kids to sit down and study and\nthey go to school and like they don't\nhave enough individual support they'll\nget diagnosed with adhd started on\nmedication and sent out the door\nso we get a lot of misdiagnosis over\ndiagnosis and a lot of missed under\ndiagnosis\nso now i'm seeing i'm saying go get\nevaluated what i'm seeing is a lot of\npeople\nare getting\npushed around in terms of getting\ndiagnosis so uh you know one person is\nsaying\ni tried talking to my doctor but he\nrolled his eyes and referred me to\npsychiatry who said they were going to\ncall me back three months ago so i would\nfollow up right so i think this is\nwhat's really challenging is that\nthere's a\nthere's a lack of mental health\nresources and professionals based on the\nsize of mental health problems\nsomeone else is talking about um\nlike you know being in a queue in brazil\nfor getting a diagnosis\num you know things like that so just uh\nthis is unfortunate right is that like\nwhat's happened is for a long long time\nlike let's say a hundred years or so\nmedicine the field of medicine has\nheavily over i would say in an\nimbalanced way over-invested in physical\nmedicine\nso what what happened is we left kind of\npsychiatry and mental health by the\nwayside\nand so that's it's sort of okay in a\nsense because\nthere were bigger problems right so we\nwere focused on heart disease and cancer\nbut about 10 years ago actually mental\nhealth rose to the top\nin terms of highest amount of morbidity\nand mortality i think in the u.s and\nglobally as well\nso mental health actually causes more\ndamage to our society than cancer and\nheart disease which used to be number\none and number two\nso i think that we're really lagging\nbehind in terms of like getting\nresources and this is the real real\nchallenges when i say go see a therapist\nor go see a psychiatrist go get\nevaluated\nthe fact that there isn't enough supply\nunfortunately doesn't change the right\nanswer\nright this is what's really tricky about\nthe world today is like the right answer\nis to still if you've got an\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nyou probably need clinical help\nright like\nit's kind of like saying okay like if\ni've got a heart attack\nand the emergency room is full what do i\ndo then it's it's not like there's an\nall like you need to go to the emergency\nroom\nthis is a systemic problem it's a fault\nof society that these wait lists are so\nlong that so many countries have poor\nunderstanding about mental health\nthat we're under resourced to deal with\nmental health\nand like it sucks to be alive in this\nkind of world where you need services\nand they're not available\nright but the truth of the matter is\nthat like you still gotta get evaluated\nif you concerned you have adhd if it\ntakes three months if it takes three\nmonths\nthat's the kind of thing whereas as a\nclinician i can tell you it's gonna\ndrastically alter\ngetting mental health treatment early\ndrastically alters your course in life\nthree months may feel like a long time\nbut we know this in terms of for example\nearly interventions for schizophrenia\nor if you can catch it early you can\nactually substantially alter the course\nof this person's life you can help them\ngraduate from college\nand then a college degree allows you to\nget different jobs\ndifferent jobs allow you to form\ndifferent kinds of relationships allow\nyou to build a life that's worth living\nso early intervention is really\nimportant so i know it can take a long\ntime i'm sorry that y'all are in that\nsituation\ni wish i could do more right we're doing\nwhat we can in terms of aoe but go see a\nprofessional even if it takes a while\nand stay on top of it because this could\nbe really important what people think\nhyperfocus is hey man you want to waste\nsome time\nno not now i'm\nhyper focusing\nwow i gave up on that problem hours ago\nincredible hyper focus can seem like a\nsuperpower what hyperfocus actually\nfeels like\nhey buddy you've been at it for a while\n[Music]\njesus christ was that your stomach\nwhat\nthe eye of sauron dude when's the last\ntime you ate\ni don't know\ni'm almost done can you just go away\nokay\nhey just\neat this okay\nyeah dude that's devastating this is\nsomething that's going around nowadays\nis this concept of hyper focus\nso what people tend to find is that even\nif you have adhd you're able to enter\nperiods of intense focus on a particular\nthing\nnow some people\nsome studies have sort of hypothesized\nthat this is similar to the flow state i\nthink there's a lot of merit to those\nand i've worked with people who have\nadhd who have entered periods of\nhyperfocus that have been very very\nproductive\nthere are different perspectives though\nand one is we're going to talk about\nsomething called perseveration\nso perseveration is the inability to\nshift your attention so this is\nsomething that people sometimes forget\nabout adhd is that it's an attentional\ndisorder it's not necessarily an\ninattentional disorder okay so it's a\ntension deficit hyperactivity disorder\nor attention deficit disorder so there\nare two dimensions of attention one is\nthe ability to get distracted or not get\ndistracted right one is the ability to\nfocus on something and not lose sight of\nor not get distracted by something else\nthat's what we usually think about so if\nwe watch the earlier tick talk about the\ngirl kind of walking around and getting\ndistracted by a thousand things\nwe think about the inability to hold\nyour attention in a particular place is\nwhat adhd is\nthere's another side to that coin which\nis perseveration or hyper focus which i\nstill sort of think of as a problem and\nwe'll talk about that in a second which\nis the inability to let go of something\nbecause here's the real problem with\nhyper focus is that it's generally\nspeaking not controllable\nright\nthat's where what i tend to find in in\nwhen i work with people with adhd is\nthat\nthey're looking to harness that in a\nconsistent way right they're like oh if\ni can just hyper focus\nthen everything would be so awesome if i\ncould hyper focus every day everything\nwould be great i just need to figure out\nhow to hyper focus better hyper focus\nbetter hyper focus better\nbut the whole challenge of hyper focus\nif you have adhd is that you can't\ncontrol it\nright so you're like looking for this\nthing looking for this thing every once\nin a blue moon like it shows up and you\nhyper focus on your exam and you get a\nbunch of programming done and stuff like\nthat i've worked with like engineers and\nstuff at very prestigious firms\nlike developers\nright and they're like oh if i can\nharness it like sometimes i'll show up\nat 8pm and then i'll hyper focus through\nthe night and i'll get all of my coding\ndone for the whole week\nand they go around trying to chase these\nkinds of hyper focusing episodes\nso this is the kind of thing where i\nthink it's like it's kind of tricky\nbecause is this perseveration is it a\nsign of illness or is it like funk like\nuseful and that's where like i want you\nall to remember that there are features\nfor diagnosable psychiatric illnesses\nthat can actually be beneficial\nand generally speaking when we think\nabout diagnosable psychiatric illnesses\npart of the reason that they exist\nis because they are a hyperactivation of\na useful feature\nanother good example of this is\nsomething like hypomania\nso hypomania and bipolar disorder allows\npeople to be functional with like two to\nfour hours of sleep a night\nso what we tend to see is that people\nwho are like functional with two to four\nhours of sleep a night\ncan accomplish amazing things\nuntil the hypomania crashes into a\ndepressive episode and then for six\nmonths getting out of bed is a struggle\nso hyper focus can be useful\nsome people can sort of align it in kind\nof a productive way but generally\nspeaking what i tend to find is that if\nyou have a choice between\nyou know random periods of hyper focus\non random tasks too because you can't\nnecessarily hyper focus on what you need\nto hyper focus on in fact a huge problem\nwith adhd especially if you talk to\npeople like parents is like their kid\nwill perseverate with legos they need to\ndo their homework but they can sit and\nfocus on legos for eight hours at a time\nor they can play minecraft for 14 hours\nat a stretch without food or water or\nwhatever\nand so like if you could shift that to\nstudying imagine what you could\naccomplish and there are people who are\nable to sort of you know find some happy\nmedium there\nbut generally speaking i think this is a\nmore accurate representation of hyper\nfocus is if you look at you know these\ndifferent kinds of blogs and stuff like\nthat they'll talk about oh you know like\nharnessing hyper focus for your optimal\nproductivity and like accomplish like\nmake six thousand dollars an hour if you\njust like hyper focus properly\nright and take these new tropics and buy\nmy book\nby the way and use these supplements\nthat'll enhance your hyper focus with\nadhd\npay me money\nand the dream that you crave will become\ntrue\nyou can hyper focus whenever you want\nand there's a part of that that may be\nreal right there's a part of that about\ncultivating hyper focus cultivating the\nflow state which is probably somewhat\nsimilar\nbut we've got to be really careful\nbecause sometimes this can really cross\nover into perseveration and in my\nexperience hyper focus is more like\nwinning the lottery than it is about you\nknow having a salary\nit's like every now and then it really\nthe stars align and you can do a lot but\nit's just not a consistent there's just\na lack of consistency to it\nso this is what's super challenging\nabout it\nso\nyou know this is the kind of thing where\nwhen i work with people who struggle\nwith any kind of diagnosis there are\noftentimes certain parts that are\nadvantageous which i know sounds kind of\nweird\nand it's fine to try to cultivate those\nparts and and sort of emphasize those\nparts and things like that but this is\nalso the kind of thing where you got to\nbe a little bit careful i mean if you\ntry it for a while it's really not\nworking\nthen i'd recommend something else right\ninstead of trying to make the stars\nalign over and over and over again\nmaybe get some treatment maybe do\nsomething about it maybe alter you know\nyour focus on building your attention\nmeditate more build your executive\nfunction so that you can control your\nattention a little bit better so all the\nkind of treatments or other kinds of\nsupportive things that you can do can\nstill be helpful\nquestions\nginger tonic is saying not me hyper\nfocusing on the stream while i plan to\nclean my house absolutely right this is\nthe challenge\ni want to play games but got distracted\nby the stream\ni don't know if that's a win or a loss\nfor you\nso there are a lot of questions about\nthings like building executive function\nhow do i read books with adhd\nso\nlet me try to summarize this so there's\nlike\nthe key thing is that we break this down\nin a lot of complexity because this is a\ncomplex issue\nwe break this down this is why we built\na guide right so we made a guide that's\nlike 20 hours of stuff around adhd and\nhow to build executive function and all\nthis kind of stuff but i'll try to give\nyou all a summary\nso here's my general approach to working\nwith someone with adhd\nthere are some things that you can level\nup\nyour brain for\nand the key thing about adhd is you\ncan't just level up your brain\na big part of protecting against adhd\nis not just improving your executive\nfunction it's actually creating external\nsystems\nto accommodate for whatever weaknesses\nyou have in your brain\nit's an oversimplification but that's\ngenerally how i think about it\nand this is where like this is true for\ni think kind of anyone right this isn't\njust exclusive for adhd\nany kind of any human being has a unique\ncognitive fingerprint that has\nparticular strengths and particular\nweaknesses\nand this is where if you want to think\nabout how to be successful\nthat's where you've got to level up some\nof those weaknesses but a big part of it\nis actually accounting for some of those\nweaknesses in other ways\nright so let's say i'm running a company\nand i'm really really good at operations\nbut i'm not great at creative thinking\nso i can try to boost my creative\nthinking to a certain amount but there's\ngoing to be a certain point where like\nthe you know the most ideal solution is\nthat i partner with someone who's good\nat the creative thinking and then we\nwork together so it's using external\nthings in addition to leveling yourself\nup so just to give you all a simple\nexample of this like how we pair these\ntogether when i'm working with people\nwith adhd i'll teach them to meditate\nwhich is one of the simplest ways to\nboost executive function and that too i\npersonally believe this is less\nsigned or not scientifically supported\nright so the studies are on mindfulness\nand people garble all the different\ninterventions they don't like\njust call it all mindfulness but you can\ndo very different things one will be a\nmonth or a meditation one will be some\nyou know observing your breath whatever\nso in my experience particular\nmeditations are more effective\nfor attentional problems compared to\ndepression or anxiety or whatever\nso you can use meditation to boost your\nexecutive function but a key part of\nthat is also like getting organized\nlearning how to prioritize building a\nto-do list that protects you from\ngetting distracted\nright so it's like using notifications\nand calendars and things like that so\nyou don't have to level up your brain so\nmuch\nthat some of it you can actually like\ngear up on the outside right there's\nlike the stats that you level up and\nthen there's the gear that you equip\nand the damage that you do or you know\nthe power of your heels or things like\nthat all that stuff is a combination of\nstats plus gear and when it comes to\nfiguring out your adhd that's the\nattitude that i take that's the approach\nthat i take some stuff you've got to\nlevel up but some stuff you've got to\nexternally gear and it'll do the work\nfor you\nand the problem is that a lot of times\nwith people with adhd all they want to\ndo is level up they're running around\nlike deprived you know running around\nwith a loincloth with no weapons and\njust jacking up their strengths as much\nas they can so they can start you know\npunching people in a video game\nand it's like at some point you want to\nequip a weapon if you want to increase\nyour dps like you can jack up your stats\nas much as you want to it's just not\nthat\nnot going to be that efficient\nand when we see real progress and this\nis where if you look at the you know\nevidence-based psychotherapies that we\nhave for adhd a lot of is actually not\nabout leveling yourself up or doing any\nkind of internal work a lot of it is\nabout gearing up properly\nso someone else is asking what if i was\ntold i was i\nas a child i have adhd but i'm good at\ngetting things done remembering things\nstaying organized now was i misdiagnosed\ni can't say whether you're misdiagnosed\nor not because\ni don't know if you meet the diagnostic\ncriteria today and i don't know if you\nmet the diagnostic criteria before\nright there's a lot of stuff that goes\ninto the diagnosis of adhd what i can\nsay is a couple of interesting\nprinciples the first is remember i said\nthat adhd is one of the most over\ndiagnosed illnesses in my experience so\nit's possible you're misdiagnosed the\nother thing to remember is that adhd can\nuh\ngenerally speaking small percentage of\npeople we're talking 25 percent of\npeople or less\nwill grow out of adhd so remember that\nadhd is an executive function deficit\nand the executive function comes from\nthe frontal lobes and the frontal lobes\ndevelop until you're about 30 or 32.\nso we tend to find is that as people\ngrow up they can look like they have\nadhd before but as their frontal lobes\ndevelop they can essentially quote\nunquote grow out of it\nthe unfortunate thing is that as you\nreally look at good epidemiologic\nstudies on what percentage of people\ngrow out of it unfortunately it's the\nminority of people so were you\nmisdiagnosed i don't know\nyou could have been misdiagnosed you\ncould have been someone who\n[Music]\nwas appropriately diagnosed but grew out\nof it because your frontal lobes\ndeveloped or you could be someone who\nstill neurodevelopmentally has adhd but\nhas developed the appropriate\ncompensatory mechanisms you've geared up\nenough to where adhd doesn't affect you\nand that's what we see in treatment with\nadhd that when you do for example cbt\nwith adhd and you help people build\nthese you know organizational systems\nand stuff like that they no longer meet\ncriteria for the disease in terms of\nimpairment to function so it doesn't\ncure your adhd because it doesn't change\nyour brain but you you gear up enough to\nwhere like you can do dps fine\ngreat question\nyou"
