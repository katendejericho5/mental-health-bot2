    "transcript": "hey like we need to we need to go kill\nbaron or the dragon or whatever right\nlike we need to do this we need to do\nthis we need to do this whereas like\nbeing an effective communicator\nespecially in a moba i found it's way\nway better to ask questions instead of\ntelling people what to do hello\nhi hello friend how are you\ni'm i'm doing all right how are you i'm\ndoing well today\ncan you tell me what you go by\ni go by a boss okay\nwelcome a boss\nthis is kind of crazy yeah um\nyeah i've been watching your content for\na long time and it's helped a lot with\nlearning how to listen to people and how\nto talk to people and\nnotice my own emotions so it's kind of\ncrazy i'm i'm very i'm very happy that\nit's been helpful to you so how how are\nyour friendships how how's life going in\nin the world of your friends and things\nlike that\nso\nfor me uh i'm kind of keeping a lot of\nlong-distance friendships where we\nmostly talk on discord\nwe\nmy main group of friends we went to high\nschool together and then\nafter college we all moved to all kinds\nof different states\nand so\nto me this problem has\nshown itself more recently so i've been\ngoing through a breakup and that's been\na hard time\nand whenever i bring it up to them\nthey're very supportive of me\nwhich is great and reassuring for me\nbut\ni feel almost guilty bringing it up a\nlot because we don't have\na particularly formal or regular way for\ntalking through our emotions or talking\nthrough our days\nusually we get on discord play league\ntalk about league um\nor yu-gi-oh or whatever it is that we're\nplaying\nand so\ni\nthink i imagine that i wouldn't feel as\nguilty going to them with my\nif i'm going through a hard time like oh\ni'm thinking about her again\nif\nthey were also\nif we were all communally\ntalking about our feelings and how we're\nhow we're doing\num i'm assuming that this is largely\nlike a guy thing\nuh i imagine a lot of guys go through\nthis and a lot of guy friendships where\nyou don't really talk about\nhow you feel\nor tough times and things like that\nso i was wondering how to introduce more\nregular ways of talking\noutside of games\nabsolutely so so let me just make sure i\nunderstand your situation it's it's a\nit's a i'm really glad you're calling in\ntoday boss because i think that this is\nsomething that a lot of people do\nstruggle with\nso if i heard you correctly you had a\ngroup of irl friends in high school or\ncollege and after college i believe you\nwent your separate ways\nand you all have continued to stay in\ntouch over the internet and discord is\nthat correct\nand most of the time the nature of your\nsocial interaction is like gaming\nrelated so you all will hop on y'all\nwill play league yu-gi-oh whatever\nis that also correct\nyep and you're going through a breakup\nyou're kind of leaning on them for\nsupport it sounds like they're actually\nsupportive but i'm hearing that you feel\nguilty\nbecause it almost sounds kind of one way\nit's sort of like\nyou know when they are hanging out with\nyou they're not asking for your\nemotional support you're not supporting\nthem through a breakup you know they're\nkind of logging on to have fun\nand when you're kind of logging on and\nyou reach out for support like it's it's\nkind of one way in terms of how the\nsupport goes\nyeah i've been trying to\nkind of load balance as weird as that\nsounds you know one time i'll have i'll\ngo through a hard time i'll text one\nfriend and then i'll i'll keep a\nrotation of friends of you know four or\nfive people to talk to so that way it's\nnot\nlike an everyday thing or an every week\nthing\nfor the same person\nso what are you trying to accomplish by\nload balancing\nuh i'm trying to\nnot\nto not overbear one person\nwith\nall of my\nfor me i'm going through a sad time\nright so i don't want to have the same\nperson\nfeel like they have to support me\nokay and\ni feel like it would be easier for the\ngroup all together if it's multiple\npeople\nsupporting each other\nokay so\nall right so let's let's understand this\nproblem so\nyou feel guilty right\nyeah and the reason that you feel guilty\nis because there's one way of support\nlike one way it's a one-way road\nyeah and since it's one way what you're\nsort of doing is is you don't want too\nmuch traffic down that road so what\nyou're kind of doing is creating five\ndifferent one-way streets\nwith five different friends\nso that\nyou're kind of balancing the load of\nthem supporting you\nyes and then you're also kind of\nnoticing that maybe it's a masculine\nthing maybe it isn't but definitely in\nyour case and in your friend in your\nparticular group\nyou struggle to sort of understand how\nto like broach the topic of like how do\nwe talk more about things that are not\ngaming\nright exactly\nand so unrelated yeah it helped for me\nto turn on my camera just like eye\ncontact wise or\nuh it's your choice so i'm not gonna\nstream you um i turn on my camera on\ndiscord so that you don't see the stream\ndelay\nyeah i just it feels weird i i have a\npersonal hard time talking with people\nif like they don't have their cameras on\nyou're welcome to turn it on i can i can\nuh and then i'll i'll move things over i\njust don't want to leak you accidentally\nthat's all good okay so i just can't\nyeah so\noh man this is so much nicer\nright\nyeah we should think about next time you\nknow if people are comfortable showing\ntheir face then everyone can enjoy\nbecause you're it's a check\nseeing your face\nmakes me feel so much more connected to\nyou\nyeah it feels so much easier than just\ntalking to uh my discord avi is cloudy\nand smoke ball you know just a random\nyeah so\ni i want you to i want to ask you a boss\nwhat did you just do just now by sort of\nasking if you wanted me\nto if you if i wanted you to turn on\nyour camera what did you just do there\nit's great\num\ni wanted to make eye contact so i asked\nyou if that was cool with you\nokay\nthat's pretty cool\nright so i\nsomehow don't have a hard time asking\nstrangers for favors and questions yeah\ndo you have a hard time asking your\nfriends for favors\noh yeah\nhow do you understand that um\nso\nin in high school i noticed this a lot\nwhere uh i was in i started joining\ntheater things in high school and it's a\nlot harder\nto perform in front of friends than it\nis in front of strangers\num\nit's a lot harder to ask\nlike if a stranger sees me drop a book\nand they pick it up for me i'm like all\nright thanks move on\nbut if my friend does it\ni feel like oh my god i do this every\ntime\nuh\nor if i feel sad and i reach out to them\ni'm like oh man\ni'm being sad again um\ni feel like it's too much\ni'm noticing that you have a\na problem owing your friends things\nbalance with your friendship sounds very\nimportant to you\nyeah um i i view it more as me being\nguilty i feel guilty a lot\nwhat are you guilty of\noh so many things\num i'm guilty of\nnot doing a good job at work i'm guilty\nof not reaching out to friends first\na lot of times they'll reach out to me\ni'm guilty of\nasking people for things and then\nlike a lot of times i'll call people be\nlike\nhey\nuh do you remember that show you watched\ndo you recommend it\nokay cool bye and that's it\nso you're just you're getting something\nfrom them but you're not giving anything\nin return\nyeah that's the impression i i get um\nthey haven't\nsaid that to me but that is\ni don't know i'm trying not to do that\nanymore okay have you ever asked\nno uh i just recognized from one person\none friend has been like hey wait hold\non\nhow are you doing i haven't seen you in\nsix months what's going on\num\nand that's only happened once uh but\nyeah i feel guilty about a lot of things\ni see that\nso there's so let's let's kind of talk\nthrough this\nuh in a couple of different ways so the\nfirst is that it does seem like you're a\nlittle bit prone to feeling guilty\nand and i'm sort of noticing almost this\npattern where if you've got a\nrelationship\nthis didn't quite resonate with you but\nthis is sort of what i heard and i'm\nsure there's more nuance to it but that\nlike\nlike this one way traffic\nthing seems to bother you a lot so if\nyour friend like picks up a book for you\nin a sense it almost seems like i mean\neveryone drops books\nbut i imagine you would feel more\ncomfortable if if they helped you out\nwith something if you were able to help\nthem out with something\noh yeah oh yeah definitely and then also\nit's kind of like with this this whole\nthing about oh hey is that show good\nlike thanks a lot okay thanks bye\nyou know so you're getting something\nfrom them and you're not giving anything\nin return\nand so\ni think there are a couple of things\nthat we can sort of give you kind of\nvery concrete kind of\nsuggestions for you to sort of think\nabout and see what you feel comfortable\nwith about how to change the dynamic of\nyour friend group\nbut i think a lot of this comes down to\nsomething kind of simple which is that\ni'm noticing that a lot of\nyour guilt or a lot of your mistakes\nare\nactually not\nsignaled to you by your friends\nno they're actually like from here\nyes right what do you think about that\num\ni think it's\noverall a mechanism that serves me well\nto treat people well and to\num\ni think where i got it from was i had a\nfamily friend\nwho\nfor context i'm a muslim so he would say\nthat at the day of judgment\nyou know\ngod essentially presents you a book of\nall the things you've done and you have\nto review it\nand\nthe guy mentioned how people who\nkeep a journal of the things they've\ndone in this life even before the day of\njudgment\ntheir process is quicker\ni don't know why i thought it would be a\ngood idea to do but i started doing it\nmentally like this is how i did well\nthis is what i did could have done\nbetter\num\nyeah and so i i start keeping track of\nall the things i do and all the mistakes\ni make and all the things i need to\nimprove on\ndo you think you were doing that before\nyour friend shared that with you\ni might have but this was\nprobably eight years ago so\nit's hard for me to remember that okay\nso\num abbas i'm gonna share some thoughts\nwith you but let's start by kind of\norganizing so i think there's like two\nor three different layers to this\num yeah i i got off track my bad no no\nit's it's good i mean that's how humans\nwork right so human beings are complex\nand your answer or solution isn't going\nto be simple did you just make another\nmistake did we just add something to the\nbook\nyeah like even even with therapy i i go\nin and i plan out the story of like this\nis how my week went this is all the\nthings i want to cover\nand then my therapist is like let's talk\nabout that\nwhen i'm only five minutes into the\nstory and then i\ni leave the session thinking oh man i\nforgot all these things to talk about i\ndidn't do all this and\nyeah\nyeah so so you you perceived yourself as\nmaking a mistake now something has been\nwritten\nin the book of judgment\nthat yes oh abbas is supposed to talk\nabout his friendships and here he is\ntalking about his guilt and his\nspirituality in the way that his mind\nworks oh no\nyeah right so you do you think you made\na mistake there\num\ni didn't follow through with my\nintention so yeah yeah so look at my\nface\ndo i think you made a mistake\nno i don't think so but\nit weighs on me anyway weighs on you\nanyway what weighs on you\num\nthat i didn't follow through with my\nintent that i\ndeviated from the prompt\nokay\nso i personally found it useful that you\nshared that stuff\nwhat do you think about that\ni feel concerned\num\nbecause\nif i'm already deviating this far in\num\nthen\nif i keep talking i'll keep giving more\ncontext and then i'll deviate even\nfurther and then it's like\nhow do i explain 22 years of my thought\nprocesses uh how do i'm 20 22 years of\nmy thought processes\nin half an hour i can't and then it's\nlike\nah it becomes too much okay\nso\nyou believe you made a mistake\nyes\ni don't believe you made a mistake\nthat's nice\nright so we're agreeing to disagree\nthere\nyeah i see that\nso now now here's my concern\nis like you're talking about a\nrelationship right like a relationship\nwith your friends\nand right now\nso i'm let's say i try to reassure you\nand i say bro it's not it's really not a\nproblem i'll explain why in a second\nbut you have you you play wall right so\nlike\nyou have reassurance resistance\nso like as i try to reassure you like\nyou have you're resistant to that so 90\nof that reassurance you block\nyou know because you got you tank it up\nand what does that mean for you and your\nfriendships and your guilt\nuh i play league like it's a single\nplayer game and i\nthink it applies here as well beautiful\nhow\nuh i learned if i want to climb in\nleague i was watching ls who's a big\ncoach and he says\nit doesn't matter what the other team\nwith your your other teammates do\nyou can only fix what you've done\nand i think okay yeah\ni you know i didn't look at the mini map\nthat's on me my bad\nand so\neven though\nthere's a lot of information to take and\nthere's a lot of different routes and\neverybody's going to make mistakes it's\nmy fault\nand so even if my teammate carries\nif i had a bad game i had a bad game\neven if they brought it through and we\nstill won and we had fun whatever but i\nstill didn't look at the mini-map i\nstill didn't\ntrack everything i didn't\ndo everything i could\nyeah so\ni've heard this a lot so this is maybe a\nlittle sneak preview so i've been doing\na secret experiment outside of creating\ncontent\nand and i play more dota than league and\ni know this sounds kind of weird but\neveryone sort of says if you want to\nclimb in a multiplayer game just play it\nlike a single player game like you can't\nrely on your teammates you can't you\nknow it's just a single-player game\nthere just happen to be like bots street\npeople like bots and that's the best way\nto climb\nso i know this sounds kind of weird but\ni think that that's absolutely idiotic\nbecause\nit's a multiplayer game so i did this\nexperiment and hopefully we'll make a\nyoutube video about it at some work it's\na lot of work where i\nhave i had two accounts\nand i calibrated\nit so this is dota so i don't know if\nthis works out perfectly in league but i\ncalibrated on both accounts just me like\nplaying on both accounts simultaneously\nand the only difference is in one\naccount i\ncommunicated with my team\nand in the other account i just muted\neveryone and didn't talk at all\nand the mmr difference between the two i\ndon't know how this translates into\nleague maybe someone in chat can help us\nout\nis about a thousand mmr\nwhich is like pretty big like it's huge\nand i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike in a multiplayer game\nwhen you actually\ncommunicate effectively and i think the\nreason that people say don't communicate\nin multiplayer games is because we don't\nactually work on communication the way\nthat we do on like last hitting or\nrotating or clicking buttons or things\nlike that communication is a skill yeah\nabsolutely and the reason that people\nsay mute people is because we don't know\nhow to communicate with our team\neffectively\nyeah this is somewhat related but like\ni realize um\ni learned over the course of the last\nrelationship that\nyou know if i'm listening i can't do\nanything else i have to like\nfocus 100 and i've had to work on\ncommunication\nexactly like everything else where like\nyou taught in one of your videos if you\nwant to listen to somebody repeat back\nwhat they said and so that was something\ni had to build\nlike all the other skills yeah\nso so i think if we kind of come back to\nyour\nyour interpersonal relationships\ni'm noticing that like i mean you said\nit beautifully that you play it the same\nway you play league which is like like a\nsingle-player game like you don't so so\nhere's what we're gonna do so here's how\ni'm kind of understanding your situation\nso on the one level there's some stuff\nthat is actually a single-player kind of\nquest so your propensity towards guilt\nyour kind of spiritual perspective which\nkind of i can't tell if that\ni want to say you're sort of\nmisinterpreting something there in terms\nof the religion of islam but i'm not an\nexpert in islam and you're the muslim so\nlike if that's you know i'm not either\nso but you know something tells me that\nsometimes what happens is we have\nreligious or spiritual traditions that\nintersect with particular\nvulnerabilities in our psychology and\nthen what happens is\ninstead of like\nrecognizing this as a problem within me\nthat i'm prone to guilt\nand instead of like working on that in\nsort of a healthy way sometimes what\nhappens is religion will come in and say\nno no you're not prone to guilt that's\nnot a problem you should fix that's part\nof the religion you need to be guiltier\nand it'll kind of reinforce it and in my\nexperience like sometimes that can be\nunhealthy i'm not saying that religion\nis bad i think it's\nyou know there are vulnerabilities in\nour psychology that can be\nexacerbated by all kinds of external\ninfluences whether they be friends\nfamily religion\nphilosophy like you know people can sort\nof get into nihilism and and stuff like\nthat in a very unhealthy way\nso that's just kind of the the personal\npiece and then i want to talk a little\nbit about the interpersonal piece\nso very concretely if we kind of go back\nto the core issue it's that you just\nplay league with your friends and you're\nkind of leaning on them for emotional\nsupport so this is where i would really\nencourage like communication so i know\nit sounds kind of weird but i'd start\nwith a simple question like hey i've\nbeen going through a breakup recently i\nreally appreciate your support\nwhat's it like for you\nwhen i ask you know when we like talk\nabout this instead of talking about\nleague\nthat's scary\nwhat's scary about it\num\nit's\ntrying to tread ground\nin a totally like\nthe grass isn't cut it's all tall grass\ntrying to figure out\nhow to navigate a new avenue for the\nrelationships\nuh in my life and so that's\nscary because i don't know how\nreceptive they'll be to that maybe\nthey'll just want to play league maybe\nthey just you know they had a long day\nat work they talked about it with\nsomebody else\nand so they just want to chill yeah\nbut like yeah it\nit's unknown it's an unknown absolutely\nright and so you talked earlier about\nhow maybe this is a dynamic with men and\ni think that\ngenerally like culturally like we're not\nmy experience growing up as a man i\ncan't really say if it's exclusively for\nmen maybe women do this too maybe trans\npeople do it who knows right we can't\nreally comment on them but i know that\ngenerally speaking we just\nwe just play games and we don't really\ntalk about stuff much\nyou know yeah yeah i've had to bring\nemotion wheels with my friends\nof like yeah they say i'm feeling bad\nand i say okay what do you mean\npull up an emotion wheel please and\nwe'll go through it and they'll they'll\nsay oh i'm feeling guilty anxious\nyeah so i mean do you think\nyou're helping them in that moment\ni hope so that was one time success rate\nso far okay for one so so that's also\nthe kind of thing where i think you\nshould ask for feedback in that\nsituation be like hey was it kind of\nweird that i like brought up this\nemotion wheel\nor was it you know just like talk to\nthem because i think the issue here is\nthat you're not you're kind of operating\nalone and you're not getting any\nfeedback and you've got to be careful\nbecause there's that reassurance\nresistance where even if they say oh no\nit's totally fine a boss it doesn't\nbother me at all\nlike you've got to be a little bit\ncareful about your reaction to when you\nask a question you really have to listen\nand try to accept what they say whether\nit's good or bad\nand even if they say hey it's a pain in\nthe ass i just want to play league how\nwould that make you feel\ni get it\nright another time so that's like pretty\ncool because even if you're cutting the\ntall grass and there's a gigantic snake\nunderneath now you know what their\nboundary is and you're not going to\nburden them anymore\nso like communication is really\nimportant\nthe other thing that i'd recommend and\nthis is also this is going to be even\nscarier is that you actually tell your\nfriends like hey do you all have time\nfor like a call to talk about stuff that\nisn't league\ni think that'd be cool it's a lot easier\nto do that in person because you know\nyou wrap up youtube video or whatever\nand you just chill\num but online like so so i mean if\nyou've got a group chat or whatever like\ni would actually orchestrate that\nconversation and almost take something\nof a leadership role where i would share\nwith your friend group hey here's what\ni've here's been my experience i went\nthrough a breakup recently i've leaned\non you all for support\none thing that i noticed is that\nit feels kind of one way to me because i\ndon't know if it's just because you all\nhaven't gone through a breakup or you\nknow what's going on here but\ni\ni just wanted to let you know that i'm\nlike i've really appreciated\ny'all being there for me and it means a\nlot to me\nand\nmy door is always open if anyone needs\nsupport and also i'm kind of curious\nlike how do y'all feel about talking\nlike getting together and talking about\nstuff or like\nyou know that isn't league\nand just communicate with your team\nyou know you're not saying and this is\nwhat where people kind of screw up with\ncommunication is that oftentimes they\nthink that like communication means\ntelling your teammates what to do\nhey like we need to we need to go kill\nbaron or the dragon or whatever right\nlike we need to do this we need to do\nthis we need to do this whereas like\nbeing an effective communicator\nespecially in a moba i found it's way\nway better to ask questions instead of\ntelling people what to do\nso like you can ask people like hey do\nyou want me to ward on the top side of\nthe map or the bottom side of the map\nlike where do you want to play as a\ncarry\nyeah and then like the neat thing the\nreason that you gain 500 mmr from that\nmove is that if you ward somewhere and\nyour carry is playing on the opposite\nside and they get killed instead of\nraging at them if you ask them ahead of\ntime hey where do you want me to ward\nthey like subconsciously they're going\nto go play around your vision\noh yeah yeah cause you'll and then they\nwon't feed\nit's like bizarre\nbut if you tell him hey dumb ass go play\naround the vision you're on the wrong\nside of the map they're just gonna rage\nat you they're gonna in down mid\nyou like you get like so like this is\nwhere i know it sounds kind of weird but\nmaybe video games are a good analogy for\nreal life\nand what i would really encourage is\nthat you just have a conversation with\nyour friends and be like hey i really\nappreciate what you all have done i'm\nkind of curious like if anyone is like\nhave y'all gone through anything\nyou know that i can help you with you\ncan even like open the door in that\nsession or just kind of talk to them\nabout is this okay is this not okay and\nthe one thing you've got to be kind of\ncareful about is your reassurance\nresistance\nbecause this may be the kind of thing\nwhere if they say like oh no it's\ntotally fine or maybe they'll say\nsomething wild\nwhich is no like i actually like\nit's so nice to hear that you appreciate\nit it makes me feel like i did something\nuseful with my day\ninstead of just playing league to be\nable to help a friend of mine\nnow i don't know if they're going to be\nable to tap into that quite yet\ni\ni don't know about that one they're yeah\nwe're all still in the man that's crazy\nface so yeah so so so i i mean i think\nthe key thing though is that you know\nhave a conversation with them like you\ncan solicit feedback from both\nindividuals and even get together as a\ngroup because like this is what needs to\nhappen right someone needs to take the\nlead and change the dynamic of your\ncommunication and open the door for a\nconversation that is not just video\ngames\nhow does that sound to you\nuh it sounds\nlike it's\nexactly what i'm looking for\ni'm now i now need to think\nand reflect on how to do that more\npragmatically like\nonce we get in the call\ni imagine scheduling will be fine once\nwe get in the call how do we start\ntalking about our day\num\ni guess i just have to have questions\nlined up like\nhow's work been the past month\nyeah so so i'm gonna give you some\npragmatic tips this is great we're not\ngonna leave you hanging here a boss so i\nwould schedule a call right and i would\ntell people like hey i wanted to\nif i were in your shoes you don't have\nto duplicate this precisely\nbut i would say you know hey\num i was just hoping to hop on a call\nwith everybody for like maybe half an\nhour and i wanted to talk a little bit\nabout communication\na couple of things i noticed that most\nof the time when we talk we talk about\ngames\nas you all know i've been going through\na breakup recently and i found a lot of\nlike really awesome support from you all\nso first of all i wanted to thank\neveryone\nthe other question that i kind of had is\nthat as you all have been supporting me\ni sort of feel like that's a little bit\nlopsided\nand that\ni want to just tell people that i'm here\nto support y'all and i was just curious\nabout having a conversation about\nwhether we want to like intentionally\ntalk about things going on in our lives\nthat are not gaming\nthat's why i'd like to meet and to just\nbasically see it figure out\nif people are on board for this kind of\nthing are you interested\nyeah\nand then you can go to like i wouldn't\ncome in with like hey what's going on in\nyour life like hey like are you dating\nand like you know don't come in with a\nset of questions because you got to get\npeople on board they've got to like\nqueue up first right you got to accept\nthe party invite and then you have to\nsign up for the queue you don't want to\njust like\nqueue up and then like they're in a game\nand they're like hey we didn't sign up\nfor this does that make sense\nso i think frame setting here is very\nimportant\nyeah and i i liked\nhow you framed it as thank you for the\nsupport because\npersonally six months ago you know i\nwould have said sorry i'm such a\nuh sorry i've been so down or sorry i've\nbeen relying so heavily on y'all so\nyeah yeah what's the difference there\nbeautiful\nuh i got this from a day nine video\nwhere he he talked about showing\nflipping\napologies for appreciation so instead of\nsaying sorry i'm rambling thank you for\nlistening\nuh\nsorry i've been so sad thanks for your\npatience type of thing yeah absolutely\nyeah so that's going to help with your\nguilt right because it's like there's a\nlot of good subtlety there one is the\nacknowledgement that it's okay\nto be struggling\nand that that's not something you need\nto apologize for and then you can\nexpress gratitude\nso i think you can give that a shot\njust be mentally prepared that this is\noften like sometimes it's a lot for\npeople and they don't really know how to\nrespond so if it doesn't work out you\nknow come back to discord talk to us\ntalk to the community about it\nand or maybe post on subreddit or\nwhatever whether it goes well or doesn't\ngo well like you know give us an update\nbecause we'd love to hear and for other\npeople who are listening as well if you\nwant to like\ndeepen your relationship with your\nfriends this is kind of exactly how you\ndo it especially because there's a\nthere's like a i don't know how to say\nthis there's like a unwritten set of\nrules\nand no one knows how to like broach\nlike no one knows how to like enter the\nunexplored territory of like talking\nabout feelings we'll kind of get on you\nknow help each other out with\nhere and there and things like that but\nlike this is like you just have a\nconversation about it and ask people if\nyou're worried if you're feeling guilty\ndon't sit with that guilt on your own\nask people hey what's it like is it okay\nthat i do this like i'd love to help you\nout you know i'm always available to\ntalk\num i kind of feel like i owe you\nyou know and and\nyou know people will say oh like if they\nsay that like what what if you say that\na boss what are your friends going to\nsay\nuh\ni don't know\ni kind of just want to do this for me\nbecause\nlike for me\ni love uh our my friends get together we\nplay yu-gi-oh once a week i love that\nbut honestly my favorite parts are the\nhalf hour as we're building up and we\njust\ncatch up and we just talk like oh yeah i\nwent to this food place i saw this move\nlike that to me is my favorite part of\nthe night when we just talk to each\nother\num yeah and so i hope they're receptive\nto it and if they're not\ni don't know i there's like eight\nfriends in the group so chances are at\nleast some of them absolutely right\nabout that yeah so and in terms of the\nguilt and the spirituality and stuff\nlike that i think that's maybe a topic\nfor a different day does that sound okay\nthat's that's a different day for sure\nuh that's something i gotta talk with\nfor my with my parents and you know\nfiguring that out yeah\nawesome\nso um any kind of would you like to kind\nof summarize takeaways\nlike what's the situation that you're in\nand what do you think you should do\nabout it like what's it swallow so\n[Music]\nmy current situation i guess as a recap\nwould be\ni have a group of friends and we're long\ndistance so we don't see each other in\nperson very much when we talk online\nover discord it's usually\nabout games and through games\nexclusively and i want to try to bridge\nthe gap of having a more personal\ninterpersonal relationship\nand so to do that\nsome ways would be framing\nwhy i want to do it saying like i\nappreciate how you guys have been\nsupporting me in tough times\nand i either open the door or uh\nmy plan would be to schedule like hey\nsaturday night can we\nhang out and just talk\num\nand\nseeing how they respond to that and also\nat least for my personal situation\nif i feel guilt\nrecognizing why and asking the person\nmore directly\nand seeing how they\nhow they feel about it maybe they don't\nsee the same thing i do at all so\num\nwhat else\noh i think uh having face cams helps a\nlot it's a lot harder to keep track of\nconversations yeah absolutely\nso great tips so just to clarify a\ncouple things so i think asking your\nindividual friends\nhow they\nreceive and perceive you're leaning on\nthem for support like whether it's okay\nor it's too much or too little\nsignaling to them that your door is open\nif they ever need that\nright because sometimes it's like hard\nto because like i can imagine that\nthey're in a situation where they're\nfeeling guilty too\ni don't want to burden a boss with my\nproblems but you're you're totally fine\nwith it and so everyone's like i don't\nwant to burden my friend with my\nproblems i don't want to burn my friend\nwith my problems so y'all are just\nsitting there in a single like you're in\npart eq but everyone's playing a\nsingle-player game\nyeah right and then you don't\nyou know i'm not going to rotate to\ntheir lane they're not going to rotate\nto my lane and then y'all are just going\nto lose\nwhereas like we just need rotations both\nways and that's how you win a game right\nand so sort of signaling to people that\nyou appreciate what they've done for you\nhow is it for them and that you'd love\nto support them if they ever need it\nappreciate what they do see how it is\nfor them and\nsee what we can do to to build on that\nyeah 100 okay and then just watch out\nfor your\nreassurance resistance\ni\nwill work on that yeah another day just\nnotice it notice like oh like this\nperson is telling me something and i'm\nnot able to take it in that's where\nyou're going to start with that i\nthat's definitely a problem reassurance\nresistance yeah\nkeep these noted all right cool thank\nyou very much thank you very much abbas\ntake care\nyou too\nyou"
