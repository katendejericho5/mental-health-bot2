    "transcript": "what does that mean good enough that\ndoesn't make any sense what are you\ntalking about doesn't know the good\nenough version is the perfect version\nthe only version of me that's acceptable\nis perfection\nso 31m feeling ashamed for a lack of\nsuccess tldr what does great progress\nlook like for someone who suffers from\nshame what else can i do to further\nreduce or eliminate feelings of shame\ni 31 m understand my shame as something\ntied to my ideal self and where i would\nbe at my age\nearn x dollars as monthly recurring\nrevenue earn y dollars as a salary for\nmy job it's tied to some peculiar\nbehavior such as crumping crunching\nnumbers repeatedly on things relating to\nmoney such as investments monthly\nrecurring revenue cost of employees etc\nseemingly shy away from others i\nperceive as more successful or have\ntheir crap together better than i\ni've been practicing own breathing\nexercises and it seems to dissipate my\nemotional shame\nwhen i'm not at a place where i can ohm\nout loud i can mentally rehearse this\nmeditative practice has helped me feel\nbetter however i want to take things to\nthe next level\ndr k's videos on shame for those who\nmight need it\nuh why shame is the raid boss of\nemotions and how to overcome shame and\nfeeling like a failure i still feel like\ni still feel myself freezing up from\ntime to time i lost my job two months\nago and\ntwo key clients i've had what seems to\nbe depressive episodes about it and also\nsome issues with other matters i still\nhave clients i'm on ei i'm not sure what\nthat is employment insurance maybe\nthings are fine so far so maybe i'm not\nas bad as bad shame as i think i am my\ndefinition of success seems to be\nscrewing me up\nbesides practicing home exercises taking\nshowers grooming myself and clean my\nhome whenever these episodes or emotions\nhit hard has also helped\ntaking care of things i've been putting\noff in my personal life too i seem to\nneglect my personal life including taxes\nmy romantic relationship and taking\ncharge of my home what i want it to be\nwith my fiance\nwhat would progress look like for\nsomeone struggling with freezing up with\nshame\nwhere you as i would describe have\ngotten over the initial hump in handling\nthe shame to some degree plus want to\nreally silence the emotional shame from\nyourself to do an excellent job managing\nit which is the reasonable possibility\ni'll keep practicing what works for me\nand trying new things i'm just not sure\nwhat to expect over time and whether\nthere is something different i need to\ndo like forming an accountability group\nfor business owners\nany and all inputs greatly appreciated\nso here's the tricky thing about shame\nsometimes\nwe feel ashamed of ourselves\nand much like this person\nif we introspect and this person has\ndone a lot of good work\nwe sort of recognize that we have this\nidea of our ideal self\nright there's a version of me who would\nbe making this much money\nwould be doing particular things\nand i just don't live up to that\nstandard so i feel ashamed of myself\nand then i shy away from other people\nwho i think live up to that standard\nright because sometimes what we hate the\nmost\nis someone who succeeds at the things\nthat we want to do but aren't able to\nand so spending time with certain people\njust makes you feel more ashamed of\nyourself because you're trying to live\nup to the standard\nthe tricky thing here\nis that as we try to live up to the\nstandard\nwe actually will do a lot of work right\nso sometimes we start to make progress\non the shame we start meditating a lot\nwe start to you know because like here's\nthe ideal self here's me and i want to\ncatch up to that right so i need to\nstart doing better doing better doing\nbetter doing better doing better because\nthat's how you fix shame right the\nantidote to shame is achievement\nright\nif i made that much money i wouldn't\nfeel ashamed of myself anymore\nsomething subtle here something very\ntricky because we all think that the\nantidote to shame is achievement\nbecause i'm ashamed because i don't\nachieve so if i achieve i'll be totally\nfine\nbut if you'll pay attention to this post\nyou'll see a couple of interesting\nthings it seems like the person is\nengaged seems like they're a business\nowner\nseems like they lost a couple of clients\nbut they still have a couple of clients\nand if you also pay attention they also\ncrunch the numbers over and over and\nover again and i wouldn't be surprised\nif this person moves the goal posts\nright because sometimes when we're\nashamed of ourselves\nthere's this ideal self\nand no matter how we calculate we're\nnever we never live up to the ideal\nand so the really tricky thing about\nbeing ashamed of yourself is that you\nthink\nthat the way to solve it is by\nachievement\nbut the tricky thing is that achievement\nand will explain how actually reinforces\nthe shame\nso let's try to understand this\nokay\nthe first thing to uh kind of look at is\nthat shame operates in our\nself\nin different ways\nokay\nso this person does a good job of this\nwhere they sort of say that okay i\nmeditate and that dissipates my\nemotional shame\nso sometimes\nif we look at shame\nthere seem to be different levels of\nemotional of shame so one of the levels\nis emotional\nand what does that mean\nthat means that at times i experience an\nacute emotion\nright so i have particular thoughts in\nmy head my chest starts to constrict i\nhave a lump in my throat i feel like\nfleeing somewhere i hear that someone\nmore successful than me is going to be\nat this party and i feel embarrassed to\ngo and so i tighten up i freeze up and\nthere's like this very acute\nin the moment\nexperience of emotional shame\nnow\nand then this person has said okay so\ni've started meditating i do om chanting\nprops\nand that's helped with that\nbut it doesn't seem to fix the other\nstuff right so meditating it away like\nthe problem isn't fixed\nand that's a good point it's an\nexcellent observation and this is what i\nreally love about these posts in this\ncommunity is y'all are learning the\noriginal tricks\nand now what you're learning is that the\nproblem is more complex so it turns out\nthat shame is way more than an emotion\nso let's start to understand what are\nthe other components of it\nso there is identity\nokay so what does that mean so if we go\nback to the post\nideal self\nso\ni want you all to pay attention to this\nokay\nso let's take a look\nso here's my ideal self\nwhich earns x number of dollars per day\nand here's my current self\nthe gap between these two things is\nwhere the shame comes from let's say i'm\ncurrently earning eight dollars\nokay\ndo you all see that\nso as long as this ideal self exists the\nshame is a gap between where you are now\nand where you think you should be\nif these two things were the same\nthere would be no room for the shame\nwhich makes perfect sense\nbecause\nthat's why i think that achievement\nis the answer\nright because achievement is how i go\nfrom my current self to my ideal self\nthe tricky thing is that's not quite how\nit works\nthe tricky thing is that achievement\nactually reinforces the problem\nlet me explain to y'all why\nso the idea of an ideal self\nis not a real thing\nyou can't be perfect you're never going\nto be perfect\nright so even if you\nyou know if you're here let's say\nand this is what's so tricky about shame\noh\nit's not\nokay whatever\nbusted scuffed\nso\nwe have our current\nself we have the ideal self\nand this by the way is born of a hamkar\nfrom the sanskrit okay\nand achievement is what gets us from\nhere to here\nbut if you look at people who\nare ashamed of themselves there's\nsomething very very tricky going on in\nthis thought process\nwhich is that we tend to move the goal\nposts and what we're going to do is look\nat this person's thought process and\nthis is the third dimension that we're\ngoing to talk about\nhow the thoughts of shame exist okay so\nwe're going to look at these thoughts\nvery carefully\nso i'll tell you all why i think\nachieving the ideal is an impossibility\nfor this person\nso feeling ashamed for lack of success\nwhat does great progress look like\nsuddenly progress isn't enough\nright so this person has made progress\nthey started doing ohm chanting they're\ndealing with their emotional shame and\ndo they feel proud of themselves no no\nno\nthey need great progress\ndo you all see that\nit's subtle so here's what happened\nthere was a current self\nthey felt x amount of shame\nthey started meditating\nthey got better\nand did they feel proud of themselves\nthey say good job pat on the back\ni've taken one step forward towards\nconquering my shame\nno no no no\nso then the ideal self\ngets moved down here\nand now i have more stuff to do\nright\nthis was insufficient\nand we can see this in other places as\nwell crunching numbers repeatedly on\nthings like money relating to money\ninvestments\nso what i think is going on here is that\nif they make x number of dollars\nas we crunch the numbers because we feel\nashamed of ourself\nas we as this becomes x\nthis is going to become y\ny'all see that\nso the tricky thing about shame\nis that it's built on this idea of an\nideal self\nit's this idea that like there is this\nperfect version of you out there and you\nshould be ashamed until you reach that\npoint\nthe problem is that in that kind of\nsituation no amount of achievement is\never going to work\nbecause it's still you still have this\nidea of the ideal self which is going to\nbe moved around or you're going to keep\nmoving the goal goalposts right\nso the interesting thing is that what we\nknow about shame\nis not about achievement but actually\ngetting rid of this entirely\nthis is the next step it's not just an\nemotion\nit's about acknowledging that the shame\ncomes from a gap between where you\nbelieve you should be and where you are\nand that actually letting go of that\nideal self being able to say\noh like\nthere's actually like it's not it's not\nthe the antidote to shame is not\nachievement\nit's acknowledging and realizing and\nhaving compassion that there's no reason\nto be ashamed to begin with\nso i'll give y'all just a simple example\nof this you may sound like that's insane\nif you're ashamed of yourself what do\nyou mean achievement won't work\nthat's ridiculous like i need to achieve\nmore\nso i'll give you all a good example of\nthis\nsometimes kids\nwho are in abusive situations\nphysical abuse emotional abuse sexual\nabuse feel ashamed of themselves\nnow do you think that this is something\nthat they can achieve their way out of\nno it's absurd\nit's absolutely absurd\nwhen a child feels ashamed because\nthey're being abused the antidote is not\nthem doing a better job\nbut that's what they try to do right if\nyou all have worked with people or\nheaven forbid you've been through abuse\nyourself you know that even if one of\nyour parents is emotionally abusive you\ntry really really really hard to make\nthem happy and achieve be a good boy or\na good girl you know be the person that\nbe a good kid for your\nparents and there's no way that that's\ngoing to work\nthe solution to that in therapy\nis going to be in acknowledging that\nlike you don't need to achieve anything\nthat you're actually great the way that\nyou are and you have no reason to be\nashamed\ni mean there's good reasons why you feel\nthat way but like that that's actually\nnot a correct way of looking at your\nsituation\nand we sort of see this from a yogic\nperspective as well\nwhen we kind of look at this concept of\na hum god\nright this concept of a hum god is the i\nfeeling or the ego\nand the solution to that the way to get\nfree of your ego is not to satisfy\neverything that your ego wants\nso if i like if i want to be the richest\nperson on the planet or i want to be the\nsexiest person on the planet that one\nare already done\nright\nso i can attest to that\nthat doesn't satisfy you you need more\nright\nso that's not how it works\nlike achievement doesn't the ego is\nalways going to want more like you\nalways want another promotion there's\nalways going to be something going on\nthe ego loves to move goal posts\nso what we need to do is actually\nabandon that ideal self\nand that's where it's like i know it\nsounds kind of weird but like what does\nthat mean abandon the ideal self that\nmeans that\nexcept who you are right that's what\nthat when we talk about accepting it's\nlike okay so i didn't make that much\namount of money this is like where i can\nimprove because you can definitely\nimprove we're not saying stop improving\nbut there's a difference between taking\none step forward and one step towards an\nunreachable goal\nboth of them are one step but they feel\nvery different one of them is progress\nthe other one is completely insufficient\nyou all get that\nand so one is going to make you feel\nmore ashamed\nand one is going to make you feel proud\neven though the step is the same\nso did you clean more than tomorrow\ni mean than yesterday\nthat's something to be proud of whereas\nif i think oh my god i haven't cleaned\nanywhere near enough\ncleaning a little bit is not enough so\nyou beat yourself up and feel ashamed\nand then think about what you're doing\nprogress becomes something for you to be\nashamed of and then how are you ever\ngoing to get out of that situation\nwhen actual progress makes you feel\nashamed you're screwed\nyou'll get that so you have to let go of\nthat ideal self there is no ideal self\nthere's just you\nand once you realize that you'll realize\nsomething even is the beginning it's\nterrifying you're like what do you mean\nthere's just me\nwhat do you mean there's no perfect\nthere ain't no perfect version of you\nthere's just you\nyou know what's an even more terrifying\nthought\nthe version of you that there is is good\nenough\nwhat does that mean good enough that\ndoesn't make any sense what are you\ntalking about this is no the good enough\nversion is the perfect version\nthe only version of me that's acceptable\nis perfection\nand as long as you believe that\nhow is achievement ever going to fix it\njust think about it for a second\nthe only version of me that's good\nenough has to be perfect well you're\nlike kind of screwed there like that's\nan unwinnable game\nthat you're setting up for yourself so\nthis is a subtlety about shame is that\nwhat we automatically think\nis that the gap between the ideal self\nand the the current self\nif we achieve that gap if we bridge that\ngap that's how we're going to be\nsuccessful\nbut that isn't the case\nmake sense\nit's okay to have ideals it's okay to\nmove towards things but it starts with\nacceptance\nso the third dimension of shame that\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\nis the thoughts\nokay\nso the other thing that you can do is\ncatch the thoughts of shame\nso we shared one with you but we're\ngonna like look at them right\nso this i love this word\nsubtle oh you oh hold on i can't see\nthis\nso let's start by catching the thoughts\ncatch the thought of shame\nso you'll see that something about your\nthought process sets you up for failure\nand it's little words like this what\ndoes great progress look like\nhold on a second\nso\nwhat does great progress look like for\nsomeone who suffers from shame\nit's this concept of great progress\nright that's a thought that is born of\nthe shame because progress is no longer\nenough\nso we see this crunching numbers\nrepeatedly on things relating to money\ninvestments monthly recurring revenue\netc etc right so you're going to\nconstantly be changing the way that you\nlook at\nthings and\nyou know like\nit's subtle but there's there's little\nthings that are are kind of like\nbaked in throughout this kind of thing\nso for example you know they feel like\nthey're neglecting their personal life\nthey're neglecting their taxes their\nromantic relationship i'm not saying\nthat they couldn't be doing better but\nthey also have a fiance\nyou know they they run their own\nbusiness\nthey're\nmeditating every day\nright so there's a subtlety in the way\nthat your thoughts will actually\nconstruct\nways for you to fall short and that's\nwhat you need to be really careful about\nis that shame manifests in the standards\nthat you hold yourself up in it\nmanifests as your actual individual\nthoughts\nright\nand then the last thing that we're going\nto talk a little bit about\nis\nthis concept of a samskar\nor a shame complex\nso we talk about this concept of some\nscars and dr k's guide we have videos\nabout them etc so you all can check that\nstuff out but i think this is where\nyou know why does this ideal self stuff\nhappen in the in the beginning it starts\nfrom somewhere\nright somewhere along the way you\nlearned the lesson\nthat\nbeing you is not good enough\nfundamentally that's where all shame\ncomes from\nthis idea that being you is not good\nenough\nand so how do you\nfix that one way to fix it so you can\nwork on the emotions in the present you\ncan catch some of the thoughts you can\nwork on your sense of identity you can\ndo all those kinds of things the other\nthing is that honestly you can go to\ntherapy\nso a lot of like toxic shame work can be\ndone in therapy and what you're trying\nto do in therapy is is you're trying to\nsort of digest the shame complex where\ndid you discover that what you are isn't\ngood enough\nand so one of the key things about shame\nthat we kind of see here so this person\ndoes a great job\nof sharing that\nyou can be 31\nand ashamed of your lack of success\nand it turns out that when most people\nfeel ashamed what they try to do\nis achieve their way out of it\nright because if i'm ashamed of my\nachievements then if i achieve more i\nwon't be ashamed\nthe tricky thing is that despite\nprogress and achievement what we\noftentimes find is that the shame\nactually doesn't get better which is\nvery strange\nbecause we thought we could achieve our\nway out of it and why does that happen\nfor a couple of important reasons\nthe first is that we tend to move the\ngoal posts for ourselves and so that's\nanother thought that you can catch\nthe second is that the idea of the shame\nis born out of the ideal self\nright because shame is the gap between\nwhere you want to be and where you are\nand as long as this dichotomy exists the\nshame will live in the middle so even as\ni move forward\nright i'm going to move further and\nfurther away the ideal self grows and\nchanges\nso you can't have shame without the\nideal self\nand so that's the identity aspect of\nshame\nthere's an emotional aspect of shame\nwhich this person has done meditation\nand things like that\nand then you can actually catch\nthe manifestations\nof this shame complex in your mind with\nlittle things like great progress\nright so here's the key thing is ask\nyourself why the progress isn't enough\nand your mind will give you lots of\nanswers\nand then notice the answers\nand then start to notice will this part\nof my mind ever be satisfied if i did\nmore would it be satisfied if i cleaned\ntomorrow would it be satisfied if i\ncleaned the next day would it be\nsatisfied if i did my taxes would it be\nsatisfied\nno\nbecause all of those thoughts are born\nout of the shame complex\nand that chain shame complex or some\nscar is something that you can\neventually get to the root of so that's\nwhen you're working with someone usually\ni mean people do this in yoga ashrams as\nwell where they'll get to the root of\ntheir some scars but that's where i\nthink therapy is probably the best thing\nto get to the root of that shame complex\nnow a lot of this stuff coaching can\nhelp with i'd say especially you know if\nyou're like this person and you are\nconcerned that you could be suffering\nfrom depression or something like that\nabsolutely go see a licensed mental\nhealth professional but our coaches are\ntaught this model and the key thing that\nthey really focus on\nis not just digesting the shame it's\nabout helping you understand your\nthought process and not let shame get in\nthe way of your goals\nso for example like\nyou know\ni would expect coaches to help with\nsomething like this\nshying away from others i perceive as\nhaving they're crap together are better\nthan i am\nright so like they're they're behavioral\nthings that shame may be getting in the\nway of\nand so if your shame is getting in the\nway of stuff then like coaching is good\nnot a bad idea to get a mental health\nevaluation though if you're kind of in\nthis boat\nbecause sometimes shame can be a\nmanifestation of negative self-attitude\nthat is part of a mental health\ncondition that requires treatment\nokay\nokay\nso\nshadow 7578 is saying i know that the\nroot are my parents but what's next how\ndo you deal with the root\nso in my experience\nsometimes we think we know what the\nroute is\nbut\nwe may be surprised\nso i would say in fact the majority of\npeople that i've worked with and even\nthe majority of people in the coaching\nprogram our coaching clients\nhave discovered that the root that they\nthought it was is actually somewhat\ndifferent than what they conceptualized\nbecause it's it's not just your parents\nright it's it's the shame is not your\nparents it's which of your parents\nbeliefs did you internalize because you\nkeep it alive\nand understanding that is very important\nso the next step would be sort of not\njust the parents but\nwhat did you start to believe about\nyourself because of what your parents\nsaid\nor why did you start to believe it for\nyourself\ndoes that make sense\nyou"
