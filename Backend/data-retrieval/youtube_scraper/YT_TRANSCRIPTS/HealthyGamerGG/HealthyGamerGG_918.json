    "transcript": "so the more that we sort of create this\nidealized version of ourselves and the\nmore that we move towards it oh i'm not\ngonna make it i'm not gonna make it i'm\nnot gonna make it oh my god will i make\nit will i make it will i make it what if\ni don't live up to those expectations\nand i finally make it\nah\nthank god relief can someone explain\nthis\nmy toxic trait is that i don't feel any\nsense of accomplishment after achieving\nsomething just a mild sense of relief\nthat it's done\nso\nthis is something that is unfortunately\nvery very common\nwhere\nwe have things to do\nit's important to do those things\nand you could even argue that doing\nthose things is an achievement\nright so for example completing a class\nand passing your final exam is an\nachievement i should be proud of myself\nfor finishing the semester\nyay for me\nbut that's not how we feel\nright all we feel is relief there's not\nany sense of accomplishment or\nachievement\neven after we kind of\nhave worked really hard towards it\nso what we're going to do is explore a\nlittle bit we're going to explore kind\nof three hypotheses\nabout why this happens how we get into\nthis way\nand also a couple of things to do about\nit\nnow the first thing that i want to talk\nabout is we've got to be very careful\nabout this phrase right here toxic trait\nso often times when we struggle with\nsomething we will assume that this is\nnot something that is actionable\nlike a trait or an aspect of my\npersonality is not changeable or\nmalleable\nbut it turns out if we look into\nwhat is the differential diagnosis and i\ndon't mean really medically but i'm\nusing that term what are the different\nreasons\nwhy someone would work really hard\nachieve something and feel no sense of\nachievement\nwe'll discover why you may fall into\nthis and if we can discover why people\nfall into this we can actually start to\nchange it so let's talk a little bit\nabout it\nwhy does\nworking hard not give you anything\nexcept for a sense of relief why can't\nyou feel\nan achievement of any sort\nso the first thing that we're going to\ntalk about\nis being stressed\nokay\nso i want you all to imagine a scenario\nlet's say i've got a final exam coming\nup\nas i'm moving towards the final exam i\nfeel really really stressed out and i\nhave to do it\nand the stress actually motivates me to\nstudy\nright so this is a very common\nexperience where oh my god okay final\nexam is two weeks away and no big deal i\ndon't really feel a whole lot of stress\na week goes by start to feel a little\nstressed out it started studying again\noh my god it's gonna be too late i don't\nwanna cram i don't wanna i need to get\nan a\nmy gpa really needs an a\nthe stress starts creeping in\nand as the stress starts creeping in the\nunhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with\nstress start creeping in as i become\nanxious oh my god i'm feeling anxious\nwhat should i do let me watch something\non youtube\nand distract myself\neight days go by nine days go by now the\nexam is five days away oh my god the\nstress increases and now it's so\npowerful that it breaks through\nmy distractions and now i start cramming\nstress stress stress stress i'm studying\nstudying studying studying studying\ntoday cram cram cram cram cram\nfinish the exam\nhow are you gonna feel\nyay i'm so proud of myself for\nprocrastinating for nine days and then\ncramming and feeling stressed out and\nwaiting till the last minute and like\nyay i can be so proud of that no you\ncan't\nall you're gonna feel is relief\nthank god it's over\nso the first thing to understand\nis that if stress is what's motivating\nour action\nhow on earth are we supposed to feel a\nsense of accomplishment when it's done\nso think about the times in your life\nwhen you feel accomplished stress can\nhave something to do with it but it's\nusually like something that you set out\nto do\ndoes that make sense\nso the the first thing to understand is\nthat if you're motivated through stress\nand procrastination the natural thing is\nthat you're going to end up with a sense\nof relief instead of a sense of\naccomplishment\ndoes that makes like what are you\nexpecting\nso other people you may look around with\nother people who are like high-fiving\neach other because yeah like i crushed\nthe exam fantastic those people weren't\nsuper stressed before they started the\nexam\nso even though you studied hard and you\nshould feel proud of yourself the\nquestion is what was the driver of the\noriginal motivation\nright\nwhat is driving you to to complete the\ntask and your internal motivation is\ngoing to determine whether you end up\nfeeling relief or accomplished even if\nyour actions are the same it's not how\nmuch you study\nit's not how hard you study it's what's\nin here when you are studying are you\nputting it off\nthat's the first consideration okay\nnext thing to think a little bit about\nis\nsomething called the shame gap so we\ntalked about this recently\nbut this is essentially the the idea of\na should\nso in our mind\nwe have an idea of who we can be\nso there's all oak\nand then there's\ndr k oh my god\nand one of them is like a degenerate\nlazy person who struggles to accomplish\nthings on a daily basis and one of them\nis like oh my god\na brilliant person on the internet\nright that's idea it's not real i'm not\nsaying that i am brilliant at all i am\non the internet however\nbut i want you all to notice that we all\nconstruct\nideal versions of ourself and this is\nespecially true like i've seen this a\nlot in people who are you know like\nsouth asian east asian things like that\nor if you grow up with parents who have\na bunch of shoulds\nyou should do this you should do this\nyou should do this\nyou are so smart you should become\ndoctor\nyou will be very good doctor one day\nand so we have this sense of an ideal\nself and then there's the real us over\nhere\nand the difference between what we know\nwe can be or what we should be and what\nwe are is where shame lives\nthis is the shame gap between this and\nthis\nnow here's the tricky thing\nif this gap exists\nand this identity over here exists and\nbased on all the things that you should\ndo\nif you ever reach that\nare you going to feel accomplished\nprobably not\nyou think you are\nbut let's understand this carefully\nright because\nwho feels accomplished if my parents say\noh alok you're a doctor you should\nbecome doctor one day that's so good\nyou're going to be so smart and i become\na doctor one day who feels accomplished\ndo i feel accomplished no because it\nwasn't my goal to begin with who feels\naccomplished as my parents who bragged\nto everyone that i became a doctor\nyou'll get that it's not even my goal\nand it's like thank god my parents are\nleaving me alone thank god i didn't\ndisappoint them thank god i lived up to\nmy attentional potential\nand i became a doctor and i accomplished\nwhat i was supposed to do but it's never\nmy goal so i'm not going to feel any\nsense of accomplishment all i'm gonna\nfeel is relief\ni did what i was supposed to do\nand they're out there celebrating oh\nwe're going to throw you the biggest\nparty to celebrate and it's like\ni'm just glad i survived medical school\nright i don't even know if i want to be\ndoing this right now\nso the second reason that we\nfeel relief instead of accomplishment is\nbecause a lot of times when we're doing\nstuff they're not even our goals\nwe're just doing things that we should\ndo we don't actually care about it\nand if you're someone who falls into\nthis it's not like you never feel\naccomplished\nyou feel accomplished when things are\nactually important to you you just don't\nfeel accomplished when you do things\nthat you should be doing\nbecause it's someone else's goal they're\nthe ones that feel proud\nso in that shame gap in that idealized\nversion of yourself in living up to\nshould\nwe sort of fall into this trap of like\nopening ourselves up to relief is kind\nof the best you can feel\nand let's forget by the way\nthat oftentimes when we construct\nidealized versions of yourself this\nperson is perfect\nso even if you go all the way all you're\ndoing is living up to the expectation\nyou're not exceeding it it's nothing to\nbe proud of because you're just doing\nwhat's expected of you\noh i look you're so smart become doctor\nno it's like what's expected it's like\nthe minimum\ny'all get that\nso the more that we sort of create this\nidealized version of ourselves and the\nmore that we move towards it oh i'm not\ngonna make it i'm not gonna make it i'm\nnot gonna make it oh my god will i make\nit will i make it will i make it what if\ni don't live up to those expectations\nand i finally make it\nthank god relief\ni made it\ni wasn't sure i was going to\nso now you've accomplished something\nthat objectively is an accomplishment\nyour parents are telling everyone in the\nworld\nthey're so proud i'm so proud of you\nbeta\nright\nand like you're just like\nthank god\nsecond reason\nthird reason this is kind of interesting\nhas to do with imposter syndrome so this\nhappens to people who have imposter\nsyndrome\nso let's do a quick review of what\nimposter syndrome is\nso people have imposter syndrome feel\nlike they don't belong\nfeel like something funny has happened\nthe universe has\nthey got lucky and they wound up\nsomewhere where they really don't belong\nso i experienced this for a little bit\nwhen i started my internship at\nmassachusetts general hospital\nso mgh is one of the best hospitals in\nthe u.s et cetera harvard medical school\nteaching affiliate number one in u.s\nnews and world report every year or two\nyou know they like trade number one\nthrough four just like swap\nand so i showed up at mgh and i remember\nbeing an intern\nand like meeting my fellow interns and\nholy crap were they amazing\nlike i was just stunned by how capable\nthey are and they're like how did i end\nup here like this is weird\nlike i don't belong here\nright so this is what impos what happens\nwith imposter syndrome is that people\nfeel like they don't belong even though\nthey do\nso as we've studied imposter syndrome\nmore we've discovered a couple of really\nreally important things about the\ncognitive structure of people with\nimposter syndrome\nthere's one really important trait\nabout imposter syndrome\nis that when someone with imposter\nsyndrome achieves something\nthey attribute to that that success\nto things outside of them\nso if i wound up there it's because i\ngot lucky\nand when they look at other people's\nachievements they attribute other\npeople's achievements to their effort\nthis person is here because they worked\nreally hard and they're really smart but\ni'm here because i just got lucky\nand so if you actually take people with\nimposter syndrome and you ask them when\nthey win when they objectively win when\nthey get accepted or they do a good job\nat work or things like that and you ask\nthem how do you feel about yourself\nthey actually don't feel good\nthey think they just skirted by they\nthink another day has gone gone by and i\nwasn't found out all they feel is relief\nanytime there's an accomplishment\nbecause they don't actually think\nbecause remember they think they're an\nimposter so they don't think they're\ncapable of the accomplishment\ndoes that make sense\nit's their lack of confidence if i don't\nbelieve that i belong here and i'm an\nimposter and i succeed at something what\nis the reason for that success it's not\nbecause i actually did a good job it's\nbecause people haven't noticed yet that\ni don't belong\nso what we find in imposter syndrome\nis that they have difficulty taking\ncredit for their actions\nand so what happens is they get very\nvery stressed out anytime they\naccomplish something because they're\nlike oh my god like what do people\nfigure out what if my true colors show\nwhat if my brain stops working or my\nadhd takes control and then like\neverything comes crumbling down around\nme thank god everything didn't come\ncrumbling down around me relief\nso the key thing to understand about\nthis is it's not a trait\nthere are absolutely elements of your\ncognition and those elements of your\ncognition can be we've shared with all\nthree different things\nright the first is that if stress is\nyour primary motivator towards action\nyou're not going to feel achievement at\nthe end you're going to feel relief\nbecause the stressor is over\nright so if an exam is stressing you out\nif you take the exam away\nyou're gonna have stress relief\nwe don't say stress achievement we say\nstress relief it's like in the words we\nall understand these concepts\nit'd be such a load off my chest if i\ndidn't have to take final exam has been\ncancelled oh thank god\nall of your stress would go away so if\nstress is your motivator\nthen all you're signing up for is relief\nnot accomplishment\nsecond thing the shame gap in the\nidealized self in all of the shoulds\nif you're working towards a particular\ngoal or achievement for the sake of\nliving up to a should or other people's\nexpectations don't expect a whole lot of\nsense of accomplishment or achievement\nright because it's not actually your\ngoal you're just hoping you can live up\nto it\nyou're going to end up with relief\nand the third thing is that we see this\nkind of pattern in people who have\nimposter syndrome\nbecause they don't actually credit\nthemselves for their own actions\nthey attribute their successes to\nfactors outside of their control\noh the professor just likes me\nthey gave me a pass it's not that i\ndeserved an a\nright they don't\nyou don't give yourself credit\nand when you look at the accomplishments\nof other people you give them credit\nso what do we do about this\nthe first thing\nis that we have to start looking for for\nso for the first issue in terms of\nstress-based motivation\nas long as we're motivating ourselves\nout of stress\nthe most that we're gonna feel is relief\nso then you may say okay but then how do\ni motivate myself out of something\nbesides stress i know it's gonna sound\nkind of weird it's a bit simplistic\nthere's more you know depth into this so\nwe talk a lot about motivation and stuff\nin the upcoming guide so that we go into\nmore detail\nbut this is the kind of thing where like\nif you're stressed out about a test like\ntake a step back for a second all you're\nthinking about is oh my god i gotta pass\nthe test pass the test final exams\ncoming up final exam is coming up\nwhy the hell are you in the class to\nbegin with\nwhy the hell let's assume you're a\nuniversity student why'd you go to\ncollege to begin with why did you pick\nthis major why are you in this class\ntake a step back and start to think a\nlittle bit about the choices that you\nmade that got you here\nand what is the point of this\nright and this is a reframe that i try\nto do with medical students not so much\nanymore because i don't actively teach\nas much but\nyou know i used to do a ton which is\nlike helping them understand why the\nhell are you in medical school it's not\nto get an a no one cares whether you get\nan a\none day you could be riding an elevator\nwith a pregnant lady and the power could\ngo out there could be an earthquake you\nmay have to deliver a baby in an\nelevator like the movies\nat that point you don't get to say i'm\nsorry i gotta see an ob guy and i don't\nremember how to deliver babies you don't\nget to say that you're in medical school\nwho cares whether you get an a or c you\nbetter learn how to deliver a frigging\nbaby\nbecause one day you may need to\nso if you want to stop being motivated\nby stress start to take a step back do\nsome introspective work and ask why the\nhell am i here\nwhy am i taking philosophy 101 because\nit's a requirement for my degree i don't\neven care about philosophy\nbut this is an opportunity for me to\nlearn about all kinds of things that are\nnot my degree so this is the last chance\nthat i'm going to get formal education\nwhere someone is responsible for\nteaching me all this stuff\nand then when i'm 30 or 40 and i want to\nlike understand stoicism or people are\ntalking about this philosophy or you\nknow post-modernism stoicism all these\ndifferent nietzsche and like all these\ndifferent people like this is my chance\nto actually learn about that stuff\nand if you can create that frame shift\nyou will feel more accomplished at the\nend of it\nsecond thing\nabandon the ideal\nabandon the shoulds\nyou ain't living this life for the sake\nof other people and if you are that's\nwhy all you're gonna feel is relief\nwhy are you living this life\nso forget about the perfect self because\nthis is where you are\nand focus on taking this step this step\nthis step because here's the thing\nwhen this is what i want to be and this\nis where i am\nwhen i take one step forward\ni'm not there i'm not there i'm not\nthere even going halfway\nfeels like a failure\nif you go halfway you feel like a\nfailure\neven though you moved halfway whereas if\nyou're starting from here one step two\nstep three step four step this is a\nsuccess\nthis is a failure do you all get that\nmoving halfway to an ideal goal feels\nlike a failure\nmoving five steps forward from where you\nare feels like a success it's all about\nattitude\nit's all about the conception of should\nso let go of it all accept where you are\nthis is when people say like oh live in\nthe present this is what they're talking\nabout\nlast thing is if you fall into the\nimposter syndrome camp\nwhere you give other people credit for\ntheir actions but you make excuses for\nyour successes\nask yourself one simple question\nthis is gonna be the start of your\njourney\nwhy can't i give myself credit\nwhat feels so bad about saying hey i\nactually did a decent job or i am i do\nbelong here\nwhy can't you give yourself credit i\ncan't tell you just give yourself credit\nstart with that question\nand then what you can do is like on a\npiece of paper and there's studies that\nshow that this actually helps with\npeople with imposter syndrome\nwrite down the things so make two\ncolumns\nthings that you got lucky with and\nthings that you did and just fill out\nboth columns we're not saying that there\naren't things that you got lucky with\nbut there's something there that you\ncontributed\nright even if your teacher likes you you\nstill show showed up to class every day\nyou still studied for 15 hours for the\ntest things like that\nso start to like jot down and really\nthink about what were the contributions\nthat you did make\nwe're not saying that that's what's\nresponsible that's way too advanced you\ncan't do that no no no no but let's at\nleast acknowledge that you had some hand\nin this\nright and what gets in the way of taking\nthat credit\nacknowledge both we're not saying that\nyou aren't lucky you're lucky but it's\nnot like you were sitting on your ass\nthe whole time right you did something\nand at least be able to acknowledge that\nand as you do that more and more you'll\nstart to be able to take a little bit of\npride\nas you take pride you'll start to build\nconfidence as you start to build\nconfidence you will stop making excuses\nfor yourself for your successes actually\nthat's what's really weird right we\nalways think about making excuses for\nourselves in terms of bad behaviors what\nwe don't realize is that people with\nimposter syndrome make excuses for their\nsuccesses\nthey don't give themselves credit for\ntheir successes\nso it's kind of odd that sometimes we do\nfall into this situation where\nany time we accomplish some something\nwe don't feel a sense of accomplishment\nit's just relief\nnow you've got to be very careful\nbecause some people may naturally\nconclude this is a toxic trait of mine\nit is unchangeable\nit is a part of who i am no no\nthankfully that's not true there are a\nlot of different things that can\ncontribute to it\nthe first is stress-based motivation\njust leads to relief at the end so start\nto motivate yourself in different ways\nit's all introspective work the work is\ngoing to be the same the amount of\nstudying that you do is going to be the\nsame it's all about the attitude it's\nall about in here\nbecause whether you feel relief or\naccomplishment whether you've got an a\non the test and you feel relief for\naccomplishment\nthe feeling is in here the a's out there\nyou'll get that so it's all internal\nwork\nsecond thing is abandon the shoulds and\nthe ideals because as long as you're\ntrying is you're trying to live up to\nsomething you're never going to feel\naccomplished the most that you're going\nto do is live up to it\nright it's moving from negative 100 to\nzero\npride happens once you cross the zero\nmark\nand so we need to do is reset our scale\nand move zero down to negative one\nhundred and then every step forward\nbecomes a victory\nand that may sound like oh my god that\nsounds terrible like isn't that cheating\nno that's actually how it is\nif my goal is to lose 20 pounds and i\nlose 10 pounds that's progress that's\nsomething to be proud of i lost 10\npounds\nwe don't think about it that way once\nagain in here\nlast thing is imposter syndrome which\nunfortunately people with imposter\nsyndrome\ndon't give themselves credit for their\nsuccesses\nand so ask yourself why can't i give\nmyself credit for my effort\nthree approaches\nand three options for solutions\nhopefully it helps\nah beautiful makina is saying they're\nnot accomplishments because anyone can\ndo it\nyou're correct that's what your mind\ntells you\nso why is it that you cheer other people\nwho do what anyone can do\nall right there's a double standard\nthere\ngreat great point that's exactly what\nthe mind says\nright it's exactly what the mind says so\nwhen i say ask the question why can't\nyou give yourself oh because anyone can\ndo it\nso\ndoes that mean that it doesn't require\neffort\nright it's kind of interesting\nit comes from the imposter syndrome it\ncomes from the lack of confidence it\ntries to reinforce your lack of\nconfidence because if anyone can do it\nit's nothing to be proud of\nit's tricky very tricky\ni i don't blame the person for saying\nthat i think it's actually a beautiful\ncomment that illustrates exactly what\nthe mind does\nbeautifully\nput brilliant observation\nand\nhappens to be incomplete\nyou"
