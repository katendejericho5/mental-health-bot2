    "transcript": "oh you're going home for thanksgiving\nwhere do you live\ncan i come is it an open invitation\ndon't put it together like that chat\ndon't put it together like that does\nanyone else feel like a filler friend\nlike you just sit there never\ncontributing to the conversation and\nwhen you do no one notices\nyou don't really have a purpose or do\nanything and kind of just sit there\nexisting\nno one ever invites you\never or asks to do anything with you and\npeople even make group plans right in\nfront of you\nand neglect your presence it's not that\nanyone means for this to happen it just\nkind of does\nso this is\ntricky because sometimes\nwe're just kind of like a placeholder\nfriend\nfiller friend\nsometimes we exist within social\ncircumstances that we're not really like\na part of the group\nso we exist in the group or maybe with\nthe group\nbut we're not really a part of the group\nand the tricky thing about this like\nwhat makes this hard is that like\nyou know the group group isn't really\nincluding you\nso it's kind of like they're not being\nnice like they're not\nmaking an effort to include you or\nsometimes you feel ignored because\nsometimes you're not speaking at all and\nsometimes you say a little bit and your\nwords get ignored\nbut then the really tricky thing is like\nwhat do you do about it right because\nyou can't go to a group and say hey\ny'all aren't including me\nlike they're not gonna magically be your\nfriend if you're like hey you're leaving\nme out right like\nand then the other thing is that\nsometimes we're kind of aware that\nthere's it may not just be the group's\nfault\nthat sometimes it's like actually like\nthere's got to be something maybe that\nwe're doing we're kind of aware right\nmaybe we're a little bit socially\nanxious maybe we don't really\nparticipate in the conversation maybe\nwe're like really worried about what\nparticipation in the conversation will\nlook like\nso being a filler friend is tough\nbecause\nyou're not sure\nyou can't really hold the group\naccountable\nand it's not entirely your fault\nwhich then gets us into the problem of\nlike okay how do i fix it then because\nthis is a problem\nright i can't go up to people and say\nhey\nbe my friend\nstart including me\nbecause like that's not gonna work\nand then but you're not really sure like\nhow to fix it\nso we're going to go over a couple of\nthings that are a little bit tricky\nbecause i think largely in this\nsituation what i tend to find is that\nthere's a lot that you can do that\noftentimes we don't do so the first\nthing that we're going to try to\nunderstand is group dynamics\nso\ni'm going to ask you all a question\nlet's say there's a group of six people\nthat are talking about stuff\nand one of them is like hey do you all\nwant to go do something on friday we\nshould totally do that yeah i'm totally\ndown\nhow do you think what do you think is\nthe most important thing in a group of\nlike six people\nthat determines who gets invited or who\ncomes along\nso i would say this is where perceived\ninterest\nah so people are saying status\nbut it's perceived interest\nright so like just think about that for\na second\nthink about who you would invite\nwhen you're thinking about who to invite\nlike when do you invite people and when\ndo you not invite people\nright do you like look at oh this person\nhas the highest social status in the\ngroup so let me make sure to invite them\nthink about when you would invite people\nor you're like oh like that person's\nrich and this person is poor screw that\npoor guy i'm gonna invite the rich guy\nor girl\nright\neasiest to be around\npeople are saying that if some people\nare saying invite everyone\ni don't invite boring people\nso i think the most important thing for\ninvitations is perceived interest or\nmaybe it's not the most important thing\nfor invitations\nbut it is one of the things that i think\npeople who don't get invited to stuff\nconsider\nso the next thing that i want you all to\nthink about is when you don't get\ninvited to something\nhow would someone else in that group\nperceive your interest\nin doing the activity\nand what we tend to find if we want to\nbe a little bit\ncareful here\nlike you just sit there never\ncontributing to the conversation\nand when you do no one notices\nso someone is in the group and never\ncontributing to the conversation what do\nyou think that does for their perceived\ninterest\nor when they communicate they don't\nreally like\nthey contribute a little bit\nbut not\nmuch there may be situations where\npeople aren't inviting you because\nthey're toxic or they're not very\nfriendly or things like that but that's\nlike we can't really control that\nwhereas we've got to think about okay\nwhat can we control\nand what can we possibly do and i'd\nstart with this idea of perceived\ninterest\nand so you've got to think critically\nabout is the group that you're in\nwould they perceive that you're\ninterested in going along because if\nthere's like you know one person like if\nwe're all talking about going to an\nanime convention there's one person\nwho's sitting there and hasn't said a\nword\nwould i invite them to the end like they\nmust not be interested in anime so why\nwould i invite them to the convention\num you know it's kind of interesting\nso think a little bit about your\nperceived int their perception of your\ninterest in the activity\nand the next thing we're going to talk\nabout is participation\nso how do you make it so that they\nsee your interest you have to\nparticipate\nand that's where if you're not saying\nmuch\nyou're not participating much\nso how do you participate\nwhy don't you participate let's start\nwith the second one\nfirst thing is that we talk about like\noh like participate\nparticipation is tough okay let's be\nclear participation ain't easy\nit's like i'm not even that into anime\nbut i\nwatch a little bit of it and i just i'd\nlike to go and do it it sounds\ninteresting\nsometimes we don't participate because\nof how people will perceive us\nright if i participate and people don't\nlisten\nor if i participate and no one cares\nlike what if no one cares like what if\nthis what if this what if this so second\nthing that i want you to ask yourself\nis do you\nnot participate\nbecause of the what ifs\nif i say this what if they don't like it\nif i say this what if they don't invite\nme if i say this what if they don't\nthink i'm cool\nif you've got a case of the what ifs and\nit's paralyzing your participation\nthat's really tricky\nbecause as you don't participate they\ndon't perceive interest and you don't\nget invited\nso what do you do with that do you you\ncan go see a therapist and work on your\nsocial anxiety shirt\nbut there's actually like a couple of\nsimple techniques i'm going to teach\ny'all what i call a kind of a one-two\npunch of benign participation which gets\nme into all kinds of trouble so i use\nthis trick all the time i sort of do it\na little bit reflexively and then i wind\nup in conversations that i don't want to\nbe in\nlike i'll use this one-two punch almost\nreflexively when i'm sitting next to\nsomeone on an airplane the next thing i\nknow they're talking to me about their\nlife\nit's like well i just want to play\nnintendo switch so it works really well\nall right so the one two punch is that\nwhen someone says something\nyou make a comment\nand then you follow up with a question\nthe comment should be essentially\na reflection or a reaction to what the\nperson is saying\nfollowed by an inquiry about ambiguity\nokay\ni'll give you a simple example i love\nanime\nreflection or reaction anime is dope\nfollowed by inquiry that resolves\nambiguity\nwhich anime do you like\nokay i know it's complicated terms we're\ngoing to use them again\nso first is a reflection or a reaction\nand second is dig into ambiguity\nit's a response\nasking a question that\nis digging into the ambiguity so if\nsomeone says i like anime which anime\nlike what are they talking about are\nthey talking about current anime old\nanime are they talking about hentai are\nthey talking like what are they talking\nabout\nyou know\nlike who knows\nso that's where you want to start\nbecause if you just ask questions\nif you just ask questions it's going to\nfeel like people you're interrogating\npeople it's like what anime do you like\nwhy do you like that anime which what's\nyour favorite character what's your\nfavorite character's favorite hairstyle\ndid you notice that you know like which\nhairstyle do you like which clothing do\nyou like which accent do you like which\nvoice do you like\nright that's going to feel like\ninterrogation so we want to do is a\nreaction\nfollowed by digging into ambiguity\ni love anime anime is dope\nanime is great which ones are your\nfavorite\ngot it it's that simple\nyou just toss those suckers out like\ntime like couple times\nyou don't want to be like doing it all\nthe time so 15 to 20 percent of the time\nwhen someone if you're in a conversation\nof six people you just toss those out\nman i've got a test on friday\ni hate studying for tests\nwhat's your test in\nokay\nnow let's practice chat\ni'm going home for thanksgiving\nwhat's the reaction\nwhat do y'all think\nall right and some people are saying\nare you going to see family homes are\ndope\ni don't care i hate your home where are\nyou going\ncool looking forward to going home\nright\nwhat's a home what's thanksgiving\nwhere are you going back to\ni hate my family\ni love turkey\nall right that's good\ny'all are y'all i i think so the tricky\nthing is that's a hard one\nbecause you don't think it could be a\nmess or\nyou know and you can even say that you\ncould say like wow like is that is that\nsomething to be celebrated or is that\nsomething\nto be like anxiety provoking because\nsome sometimes the holidays are awesome\nfor me and sometimes they suck\nthat's the reaction\nright which one is it for you are you\nlooking forward to it\ngot it okay\num next thing\nhey did you hear about the volcano\nerupting\nwhat's the reaction they're asking a\nquestion\nfollowed okay so then what's\na perfect no what\nvolcano volcanoes are dope can i come\nright wow that's crazy wicked which\nvolcano\nno that's wild i didn't hear about that\nright\nthat's what she said don't use that's\nwhat she said\nvolcanoes are dope which volcano yeah so\ni guess this is turning into whatever\nthey say just say that that's dope and\nthen ask another question which works\nreally well\nlike i want you all to try this okay\njust see how far you can get in a\nconversation by saying that's dope and\nasking a question following it up\nare you going for a home for\nthanksgiving thanksgiving's dope\nare you going home for thanksgiving yeah\ni am i'm going to see my family families\nare\ndope is your family dope\nyeah my family's pretty great i have an\nawesome dog dogs are dope\nwhat kind of dog do you have\nsee how far you can get yeah and become\nan npc in a conversation i kid you all\nnot so seriously if you want to like\nlearn how to basically participate in\nconversation it's just the one two punch\nand here's the thing if you're like with\nfive people and you're doing it every\nfifth statement you're not gonna sound\nquite like an npc even though you are an\nnpc\nthen i'm going to give you all one last\ntip\nthis tip is transformational\nbut it's also terrifying\nare you ready for it\nif you are in a group and people are\nmaking plans about stuff\nand they don't seem to be including you\nyou can say hey that sounds awesome\nis it an open invitation\nis it cool if i come\nyou can just ask\nand pay attention to your reaction to\ndoing that\nright everyone's like oh my god and look\nwho's got a case of the what ifs we\ntalked about the what ifs look at it\nlook you've got a case of the what ifs\nthat's why you're the filler friend\nand if they say you can't come or it's\nnot an open invitation\nthen that's totally fine right you know\nthat these people are not interested in\nyou you're not stuck feeling like a\nfiller friend asked and answered\nright\nfun past 1989 saying i've never done\nthat\nis it okay is it an open invitation can\ni come along\nand people may think oh my god like\nwho's this weirdo\nwho's inviting himself he's not inviting\nhimself or she's not inviting herself\nshe's just asking could she come along\nopen invitation\nright and then here's the follow-up if\nthey say yeah sure you can come\ncool\nyou can also like you know double you\ncan kind of like double down you can say\nlike i don't know if you all are like\nfriends and stuff like if you guys\nreally\ni'm curious i'd love to learn more\nbut i don't want to be like a fifth\nwheel or anything like that if you guys\nhave like a thing going like i wouldn't\nwant to intrude but i'm really\ninterested\nyou can kind of like if you're concerned\nthat you may be pressing then like no no\nit's fine that you can come\nright and then you can say cool\nand so\nyou can be a little bit important you\ncan say like okay so like how are we\nfiguring you know what are you all doing\nwhen we're all going things like that\nand then when you go this is really\nreally important right because remember\nyou're quiet and you've got a case of\nthe what ifs\nyou start by saying hey thanks for\ninviting me or thanks for you know\nsetting this up i really appreciate it\nand then at the end of it you want to\nsay hey thanks i really had a good time\nperceived interest\nyou got to reinforce it\nbecause if you're the quiet type\nand you don't really say much when you\ngo you at least want to say hey thanks\nfor inviting me i really had a good time\ni'm on the quieter side i hope that's\nokay\nand then last tip you ready for it\nsmile\nhey i'm on the quieter side\nthanks for inviting me though i really\nhad a great time\nmay not seem like it\nlike like look look you'll see\nwe're teaching you how to be a a a\nbetter npc\nsmile\nperceived interest\nare you smiling\nsmiling is tough\nwhat makes you smile the most\nall right so you got to be a little bit\ncareful because we don't want to be\ncreepers\nright we don't want to be\noh you're going home for thanksgiving\nwhere do you live\ncan i come is it an open invitation\ndon't put it together like that chat\ndon't put it together like that\nthat's bad\nokay\nthat's bad\ndon't do that the principles are correct\nthough i recognize if stitched together\nin a particular way\nyou can make something that we're not\ntalking about making but i would say 90\nof the time this is totally fine\noh y'all are going paintballing i've\nnever been paintballing before i'm\nprobably gonna get owned but i'd love to\ntry it is it okay if i tag along\nright and then like you show up and then\nyou're gonna get owned and you'll be\nlike hey i kind of got owned\ni'd love to do it again i'm learning but\ncan we try to like balance the teams a\nlittle bit so i don't get owned so hard\nonce again smile\nright\nall right so does that make sense so a\ncommon problem people are feeler friends\nand i think the problem with being a\nfiller friend is that we don't really\nknow how to like break in\nand we don't really understand why we're\nnot getting invited\nand the key thing the most common reason\nthat people don't get invited that is\nactionable that we're kind of talking\nabout today it could be things like\nstatus and stuff like who knows\nbut in terms of what you can do at least\nmake sure that that you can do the\nthings that you're doing at the top of\nthe list is your perceived interest\nespecially when groups are forming it's\ndifferent if something is like already\nformed\nbut even then you can let people know\nexplicitly what your interest is\nso it's perceived interest how engaged\nare you how do you be engaged in the\nconversation be careful about the\nwhat-ifs oh no what if they think i'm\nstupid or what if they don't like anime\nor what if they think i'm a wee whatever\nthat's it so notice that and notice\nthat's why you're not participating\nand so very simple participation is the\none two punch\na reaction followed by a question\nthat is dope\nwhat do you what do you think is dope\nwhat if i don't know what to say that's\nwhat i'm saying is a code monkey is an\nexcellent question what if you don't\nknow what stats ones i'm laying it out\nlike what you say it's a reaction you\ncan react to anything\nlike did you see the you know oh we're\ntalking about the weather\nrained yesterday\nrain is dope\nyeah it was like it rained a lot it\nhasn't rained in a long\ntime know sometimes you i don't know if\nthere's a follow-up question there so\nthere's some kind of ambiguity you can\nkind of dig into that\nokay so this is a great question dr\nd-a-r-c-s-s darks is asking what if you\ndon't like small talk\nit's a good question\nso let's think through that what if i\ndon't like small talk first of all why\ndon't you like small talk\nso a lot of times the reason that people\ndon't like small talk is because they\ndon't know how to do it or they feel\nuncomfortable doing it\nright like a lot of times people that\nreason that people don't like stuff is\nbecause they don't know how to do it\nproperly\nso that's the first thing is are you\ngood at it secondly sometimes don't\npeople don't like small talk because it\nfeels shape fake feels shallow feels\nlike there isn't a deep connection and\nthat's where you've got to decide\nyou know\nwhether you want to play that game to\nget to the deeper stuff because most\nhuman beings\nhave a dialogue tree\nand you have to go through the upper\nlevels of the dialogue tree to get to\nthe deep levels of the dialogue tree\nright\nhave you been to the cloud district i've\nheard it's very nice\nright they don't just like you don't\nwalk up to people and they just like\ngive you a quest i mean sometimes they\ndo in games nowadays but that that's\njust kind of the way that the world\nworks it doesn't have to work that way\nand what i've also found is that you can\nalso get good at skipping past a lot of\nthe small talk because i don't know if\nyou start to have like a you know you\ncan get to like a conversation about\npeople's favorite animes and important\nthemes and animes you can do that in\nthree questions\nanime is dope what are some of your\nfavorites\noh you really like\nattack on titan\ni thought it was pretty epic\nit kind of terrifies me though\nwhat did you like about it\noh okay like you like to like\nthe stuff like i sometimes really wonder\nlike i really like how\nit has a very like mixed view of\nmorality right so like at the very\nbeginning there's like a good guy and\nthere's a bad guy and it makes me really\nwonder about you know who are the good\nguys and who are the bad guys and like\nyou know it makes me really wonder about\nthe world and then you can have a\nconversation about morality philosophy\nand attack on titan if you want to\nright like\nyou can get to deeper stuff pretty quick\nand then if you really don't like small\ntalk then the other question that i have\nfor you is okay so you don't like it\nbut\nare you willing to participate in it to\nform connections and relationships and\nget invitations and things like that\nbecause people will say i don't like i\ndon't like exercise well\nyou don't have to like it\nit's just what's important to you is\ntaking care of your body important to\nyou\nand you can do something that you don't\nlike\ndoes that make sense\ni i'm not it's a very common problem\nthat people don't like small talk people\nfeel like it's not genuine people sort\nof feel like it's shallow it's a waste\nof time\ni'm not disputing any of those things\nit's just most people\nrequire some amount of small talk\nright so just get good at it\nand you don't you'll be surprised at how\nlittle small talk you have to have i\nhate small talk\nwhich is why when i interact with people\ni try to advance the conversation to\nsomething that i can find interesting\nas quickly as possible\nright it's not and we've done that on\nstream like a thousand times\nright so like and what you'll find is\nthat other people are interested in not\nhaving small talk too\nyou just have to give them an opening\nand most people don't know how to\nadvance the conversation that's why you\nreally have to become a conversation\nexpert and advance the conversation\nso what if you don't relate to the\nconversation that is happening around\nyou great question\nso if you don't relate to the\nconversation that's happening around you\none of the best things that you can do\nis be curious\nso i have a group of friends who are all\nin the world of finance and i understand\nwhat the hell they're talking about\nso when i get bored of the con i'll let\nthem like trundle along for a little bit\n10 or 15 minutes of like me just not\nparticipating in the conversation i'll\nbe like\nyo can someone explain to me what on\nearth you y'all are talking about can\nyou tell me what\nan eye bond is can you tell me\nyou know what crypto is\ncan you tell me what tether is and if if\nyou if there's a group of people who are\ntalking about something that you are not\ninterested in\none of the best ways to participate in\nthe conversation because they're gonna\nlove this\nthey're gonna love explaining it to you\nbecause the only thing that people like\nmore than talking about a particular\nthing amongst themselves is explaining\nit to someone who's genuinely interested\nright like what on earth is an nft\nnft is a digital whatever whatever i\ndon't even know\nand then it's like wait so what do\npeople pay for it's the future\nthe future is dope\nwhat part of the future is it\nthey're like it's the whole future\ni don't understand i understand the\nwords coming out of your mouth but i\ndon't understand what you said can you\nexplain to me how nfts are the whole\nfuture and this is where things get fun\nfor you\nbecause this is where they start talking\nand they have no idea what their\ndocument oh okay\nbut seriously just ask people like\ni've never you know i don't know\nanything about this can you all fill me\nin like what does this mean what does\nthis mean what does this mean and most\npeople\ni mean just think about if someone if\nyou're passionate about something and\nsomeone comes as like genuinely curious\nabout it you're gonna be like\ni'm not gonna talk to you noob\nno like most people love talking about\nit\nwe did an interview recently where\nsomeone was\ntelling me about the nuances of of a\nbalance in a card game\nand it was like it was fascinating man\nit's like i don't know anything about\nthat i don't know if y'all caught that\ninterview\nbut you can just see how much people\nlove talking about stuff they're\ninterested it's cool to hear people talk\nabout things that they're passionate\nabout\nright it's cool\nlike i learned something\nyou"
