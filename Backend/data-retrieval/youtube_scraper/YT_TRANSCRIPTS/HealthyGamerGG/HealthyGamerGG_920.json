    "transcript": "in an effort to try to support these\nlonely men what we're actually doing is\nadopting views\nthat are very\njustifiably criticized\nbut in justifiably criticizing those\nparticular views we're actually\ninvalidating the core of the problem so\nthis article\nabout the rise of lonely single men was\nwritten by a psy d\nand talks about how dating opportunities\nfor heterosexual men are diminishing as\nrelationship standards rise\nmen represent approximately 62 percent\nof dating app users lowering their\nchances for matches men need to address\nskill deficits to meet healthier\nrelationship expectations\nso i've been linked this article by\nmultiple people which is part of why\nwe're addressing it\nand today what i'd love to do is is talk\na little bit about you know is there a\nrise of lonely single men\nif there is a rise\nwhy that's happening and what we\nunderstand about\nyou know where this is coming from i'd\nalso like to talk a little bit about\nwhat makes this\nwhat makes it hard for people to be\nempathic to single lonely men and i\nthink men have a hand in that so we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about why\nthis is such a hot topic so even already\ni want you all to pay attention to\nyourself\nand as i say i'm going to talk about\nthis\nnotice the emotional reaction that\nyou're having\nright so maybe you're sort of thinking\nlike oh this is fantastic that that dr k\nis talking about this this really needs\nto be addressed or maybe you're thinking\noh my god not another discussion about\nyou know toxic lonely single men and\nwe're going to be sort of exploring that\nsort of reaction and why that happens\nand both are completely valid\nperspectives we're also going to touch a\nlittle bit we've done this for a a\ncouple of times the sometimes very\nunsuccessfully\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\ngender dynamics\njust sort of in a general sense and this\nis something that i think has been a hot\nbutton issue for the internet\nand it's been a hot button issue for us\nbut what we're sort of noticing in our\ncommunity is that it's an ongoing\nconcern for so many people and i have\nfaith that if we kind of keep trying\nwe'll eventually sort of figure out\nhow to sort of deal with this kind of\nstuff in a healthier way\nthe other thing that we're going to\naddress today is sort of how to\ncritically read articles\nso we're going to not only be looking at\nthis article and sort of like tunneling\ndown a little bit about the editorial\nprocess and things like that because\nsometimes i don't know if you all are\nkind of aware of this but like you know\npsychology today and other publications\nare trying to get views right so they'll\nsort of pick\ntitles and things like that that that\nare kind of quite\ninflammatory and will create emotional\nreactions but we're going to tunnel down\nand look a little bit more critically at\nthe sources that are cited what the\nactual sources say and i encourage all\nof you\nto really be critical when you're\nreading articles so instead of sort of\nrejecting this article because it\ndoesn't agree with your world view or\nyou know gobbling it up without any sort\nof critical thought because it mirrors\nyour own experience what i think we\nreally need to do especially as articles\nare getting more and more clickbaity is\nto sort of think a little bit critically\nabout the points that they're making and\nwhat's supported by data and what isn't\ni want to check in with y'all for a\nsecond about first of all how do y'all\nfeel about this is this\nokay for us to talk about are these like\nacceptable goals is there is there's an\nacceptable sort of nuanced or critical\nway to look at this\nokay awesome so there's going to be a\ncouple dimensions we're not just going\nto be talking about this we're also\ngoing to be talking about gender\ndynamics and critically looking at\narticles okay so it's going to be like\nit's not just oh like it's so simple\nthis is what's going on men are screwed\nperiod end of the end of it no it's so\nmuch more nuanced than that okay\nso let's start with\na couple of acknowledgments just about\ngender in general okay\nso something that's going on right now\non the internet is that people will talk\nabout a specific gender related issue so\nfor example this article cites multiple\nthings that are specific to men so this\narticle will say things like oh it's\nmore challenging for men on dating apps\nbecause 62 percent of dating app users\nare men\nthere will also be they also cite other\nsources for example that say that 46 of\nmen will swipe right or or will like or\nyou know move forward with a particular\ndating profile whereas 14 of women will\nswipe right or like or whatever whatever\nthe equivalent is right so we can look\nat those statistics\nand what a lot of people will conclude\nis oh see things on dating apps are\nharder for men than they are for women\nnow this is a perspective that i think\nwe've got to be really really careful\nabout\nbecause remember that any time there's a\nparticular article\nthere may be particular dimensions that\nare more difficult for men but it\ndoesn't necessarily mean that online\ndating is easier for men as a whole than\nit is for women so for example there may\nbe some things which are in quote\nunquote women's favor or against men but\nthen there are other things that are\nlike in favor of men as opposed to women\nso for example\nintimate intrusions online studying the\nnormalization of abuse and dating apps\nor online inclusivity or sexual\nharassment conceptualizing women's\nexperiences in the digital age these are\nboth primary literature\nuh studies right so these are not like\neditorial articles these are\npeer-reviewed public published research\nmy point is that if we're going to wade\ninto gender dynamics we need to\nunderstand that just because a\nparticular thing is easier or harder for\na particular\ngender in a particular place\ndoes not mean that that gender has it\nharder globally or has it easier\nglobally do you all get that this is a\nhuge thing that you know you kind of\nlearn in medicine and just to give you\nall a very simple example\nso just because breast cancer is more\ncommon than testicular cancer\ndoesn't mean that it isn't hard for\npeople to get testicular cancer that it\nsucks if people get to testicular cancer\nor you know any of those other things\nwhen you are a practicing physician what\nyou start to learn is that there's sort\nof the global population stuff which may\nbe true so for example breast cancer may\nbe more common than testicular cancer\nbut at the end of the day\nthat doesn't change the experience of\nthe person in with testicular cancer and\njust because some of the statistics\ncited in this paper which will also\ninterpret right so that's really\nimportant may suggest that things are\nharder for men and i think that that's\nprobably to a certain degree true in\nthis particular dimension it in no way\ntranslates into invalidating like the\ndifficulty that women have on dating\napps and this is sort of what we're\nlearning as a society as a whole which\nis that men and women and non-binary\npeople are trans people\nby virtue of our genders we tend to\nexperience life in a more in a different\nway right and that just because a\nparticular gender has difficulty in a\nparticular realm does not mean that that\ngender has it easy in all kinds of\nrealms or that it's more beneficial on a\nwhole to be that gender now some people\nmay make those arguments and there may\nbe statistics to kind of back that up\nbut in my overwhelming experience as a\nclinician like\nthe key thing to remember is first of\nall\ndifferent genders have different\nexperiences of things in life\nand that each gender no matter whether\nyou're\na man a woman trans non-binary whatever\nis going to face unique challenges and\nour goal here is to understand the world\nunderstand ourselves and help people\nand as in part of that process what we\nhave to do is acknowledge the individual\nchallenges that a particular demographic\nmay face that in no way invalidates the\nexperience or should be compared to the\nexperience of other people i just don't\nthink that's useful right so if someone\nends up with testicular cancer you don't\nwant to say well screw you because\nway more people have breast cancer now\non the flip side there may be unequal\ntreatment which is sort of appropriate\nthere which is like okay so for example\nif breast cancer is way more common than\ntesticular cancer do we want to mandate\nmass i mean um not mastectomies um\nmammograms\nfor\nmastectomies would be terrible\nmandating mammograms for women over the\nage of 50 whereas we don't necessarily\nneed to take an you know an x-ray of\npeople's scrotums once they're over 50\nyears old so by virtue of the difference\nin size of a problem we may need to sort\nof individually create tailored\nsolutions which sort of makes sense\nmedically right so we sort of treat\ngenders somewhat differently and that's\nbased on data but at the end of the day\nwhat i would really hope happens from\nthis talk is anything that we're going\nto say about acknowledging men's\ndifficulties does not\nnecessarily relate to anything that is\nhappening with women's difficulties and\nthat actually by comparing those two\nthings i think we're actually doing a\ndisservice to everyone because just\nbecause there are more men on dating\napps\nthe challenges that women face on dating\napps is different right so there's a lot\nmore research that shows that women are\nmore likely to experience sexual\nharassment sexual assault than men on\nby virtue of online dating and things\nlike that so so each gender is going to\nhave its own individual problems\nand what we're trying to really do is\nunderstand what are the problems that\naffect this particular gender in this\nparticular moment and what can we do\nabout it and then we can also do that\nfor other genders and other situations\nand other demographics does that make\nsense\nare we okay with me continuing to talk\nabout this\nor is it not acceptable to talk about\nchallenges that men face in the dating\nrealm unless we are at the same time\ntalking about the challenges that women\nface or making it comparative in nature\nbecause here's the thing gender dynamics\nis not a competition\nright like things are hard for men and\nthings are hard for women some of the\nthings that are hard for men and women\nare actually the same but some of them\nshockingly are different\nand so if we really want to try to help\npeople we have to acknowledge what those\ndifferences are and address them\nindividually does that make sense\nit's not a competition\nall right\ndo you need our you're damn right i need\nyour permission\nso your people are asking do you need\nour permission yeah i i want it's not so\nmuch about permission as it is approval\nright so this is where like if y'all are\nnot comfortable with continuing this\nconversation if this is not a\nconversation that we should move forward\nin then we can stop\ngot it okay\nand by the way if people think that i'm\noverstepping or misplaying or anything\nlike that please let us know because all\nof that feedback has actually been\ninstrumental in getting us to this point\nand helping us gain this nuanced\nunderstanding\nokay\nlet's go so let's take a quick look\nat\nthe article\nso\nyounger and middle-aged men are the\nloneliest they've ever been in\ngenerations and it's probably going to\nget worse\nthis is not my typical rosy view of\nrelationships\nbut a reality nonetheless\nover the last 30 years men have become a\nlarger portion of that growing group of\nlong-term single people and while you\ndon't actually need to be in a\nrelationship to be happy men are\ntypically are happier and healthier when\npartnered\nhere are the three broad trends in the\nrelation\nrelationship landscape that suggests\nheterosexual men are in for a rough road\nahead dating apps whether you're just\nstarting to date or you're recently\ndivorced and dating again dating apps\nare a huge driver for new romantic\nconnections in the u.s\nthe only problem is that upwards of 62\npercent of users are men and many women\nare overwhelmed with how many up options\nand many women are overwhelmed with how\nmany options they have competition in\nonline dating is fierce and lucky in\nperson chance encounters with dreamy\npartners are rarer than ever\nso let's stop for a second\nand try to look at this a little bit\ncritically\nso the first thing to understand is that\nthis piece so let's let me ask you all a\nquestion is this piece\nfact\nor is it opinion\nwhat do you all think\nright so this\nthese statements\nright so so it's interesting so there's\na lot of there's a lot of confusion so\nsome people are saying fact and some\npeople are saying opinion so i think\nthis is a prime example of like what to\nbe careful of when you read an article\non something like psychology today i\nhave no doubt that greg matos psy d is a\nvery knowledgeable it looks like he's a\nlike specializes in relationship therapy\nso i have no doubt that he's very\nconfident\nbut a lot of this stuff is opinion so\nfor example\nthis is why it's important to read\nthings critically so 62\nof users or men so what is the source of\nthis\nit's an article from time magazine\nso according to a new study which then\ngoes to over here\nso the source is actually just another\nnews article i couldn't even get access\nto the primary study\nthe other interesting thing is that this\nsource is from 2015.\nso here we are\nin 2022\nciting a statistic that says that 62 of\nusers are men\nthat this statistic is seven years old\nso do you all think that's still valid\nright and like i can't even find the\nactual article like i can't find the\nactual source this comes from this is a\ntime magazine article this is not\npeer-reviewed research\nnow i'm not saying that the person's\npremise isn't correct and he does cite\nbetter research elsewhere my point is\nthat we just need to be critical of what\nwe\nread okay\nso\nand this is where competition and online\ndating is fierce and lucky in person\nchance encounters are rarer than ever\nmany women are overwhelmed with how many\noptions they have so this is the kind of\nstatement that i don't know if this is\ntrue\nright so they cite this statistic\nbut where are they getting this idea\nright so this is where like we've got to\nbe a little bit careful because\noftentimes what happens is when you have\nan article like this people will make\nstatements like this that are very\ntriggering\nso if you're a woman reading this and\nyou're like i'm not overwhelmed with how\nmany options i have that's not my\nproblem at all this person has no idea\nwhat they're talking about and if you're\na dude you're like yeah you're damn\nright like i can't get a single match\nand all these women on dating apps have\nlike thousands and thousands and\nthousands and thousands of matches and\nthey must be overwhelmed oh are you\nwhat's wrong like you're so overwhelmed\nwith the thousands of matches that\nyou're getting so these kinds of\nstatements\ncreate emotional reactions and what\nwe're seeing on the internet is that\nthese are the kinds of like statements\nthat people deeply resonate with or find\nquite inflammatory right\ni i don't think that this person is like\nin in the wrong for saying things like\nthis because we'll get to where they get\nthis in a second okay\nso but we just need to be critical about\nit right so this is this person's\nopinion the person is absolutely allowed\nto have an opinion and if that's this\nperson's experience that's actually\ntotally fair we just need to be critical\nwith how we're reading it with so many\noptions it's not surprising that women\nare increasingly selective i do a live\ntick tock show a better love project and\nspeak with hundreds of audience members\nevery week i hear recurring dating\nthemes themes from women between the\nages of 25 and 45. they prefer men who\nare emotionally available good\ncommunicators and share similar values\nso let's think about this for a second\nso i'm getting the sense that this\nperson's\nperspective on women\nis coming from a live tick tock show\nwhere they discuss things with audience\nmembers right so this once again it's\nuseful perspective to have right it's in\nfact the same perspective that we often\nuse which is that we like to talk to\npeople directly in our community and try\nto you know sort of get\nindividual perspectives anecdotal\nevidence\nthe difference is that we also i mean\nmaybe this person does too so who knows\nbut that's also why we have a robust\nresearch arm at healthy gamer right so\nwe have five or six irb approved studies\nthat we're running because we actually\ndon't know\nwhen we interview someone on stream or\ndo a call and show or respond to a post\nis this actually representative of the\ncommunity that's why you do research but\nthis is this person's perspective\ntotally fine so they're sort of pointing\nout that that what we sort of find is\nthat there are men who you know women\nwant men who are emotionally available\ngood communicators and share similar\nvalues\nand then the article goes on to say for\nmen this means a relationship skills gap\nif not addressed will likely lead to\nfewer dating opportunities less patience\nfor poor communication skills longer\nperiods of being single et cetera et\ncetera\nthe problem for men is that emotional\nconnection is the lifeblood\nof a long healthy term relationship they\nalso talk a little bit about uh\nyou know they're a little bit hopeful\nright so while there's no chance of\nstemming the rising tide of\nunintentional single men there is good\nnews\nalgorithms are becoming increasingly\nmore complex on dating apps and other\nonline platforms hinge apparently has a\nbeta trial that 90 of their users liked\ntheir first date\num how can men reap the benefit of the\nalgorithms level up your mental health\ngame that means getting into some\nindividual therapy to address your\nskills gap it means valuing your\ninternal world and respecting your ideas\nit means\nseeing intimacy romance emotional\nconnection is worthy of your time and\neffort\nultimately we have an opportunity to\nrevolutionize romantic relationships\num\nand establish healthy\nnorms starting with a first date it's\nlikely that some of these experience\nromances will be transformative in\nhealing disrupting generational trauma\nand establishing a fresh culture of\nadmiration validation sounds fantastic\nmen have a key role in this\ntransformation but only if they go all\nin\nit's going to take that kind of\ncommitment to themselves to their own\nmental health into the kind of love that\nthey want to generate in this world will\nwe step up\nnow this also i i think i take a slight\nissue with this last statement because\nthis implies that the challenges of the\nrise of single lonely men\nare predominantly\nsomething that they need to fix\nthe question is will we as men step up\nit doesn't actually address\nwhat's kind of interesting which we'll\nget to which is what\nthese papers actually say about why men\nare lonely\nright so these papers as we're going to\ntunnel down into\nthese papers don't actually say that\nemotional unavailability is responsible\nfor\nthe\nthe the lack of men in in their ability\nto date okay that there this person's\nown citations actually say different\nthings so let's take a quick look at\nwhat the papers so these are the papers\nthat this person cited okay let's look\nat what's going on\nso\nloneliness around the world age gender\nand cultural differences in loneliness\nthe bbc loneliness experiment provided a\nunique opportunity to examine the\ndifferences in the experiences of\nloneliness across cultures age and\ngender and interaction between these\nfactors blah blah findings show that\nloneliness increased with individualism\ndecreased with age and was greater in\nmen than women\nwe also found that age gender and\nculture interacted to predict loneliness\nalthough these those interactions do not\nqualify the main effects and simply\naccentuated them we found the most\nvulnerable\nto loneliness were younger men living in\nindividualistic cultures\nnow this is really important\nbecause what this paper essentially\nfinds\nis that young men living in\nindividualistic cultures so that's\nprimarily western cultures like the us\ncanada europe right that sort of\nemphasize an individual mentality\nover\nyou know the collective so for example\nmaybe parts of east asia south asia\nsoutheast asia maybe parts of africa for\nexample these communities are more like\nuh these cultures are more community\ndriven\nand so it turns out that you know when\nthis person says oh yeah like\nyounger middle-aged men are the\nloneliest they've ever been\ngenerationally this is correct\nbut we gotta tunnel down a little bit\nfurther\nso as we go down\nand we look at it let's see what the\nauthors of the paper actually say\nthe finding that loneliness was higher\nand individualistic compared to\ncollectivist culture should be\ninterpreted with caution\nthe vast majority of participants\nresided in individually\nlisted countries especially the uk\num\nthat does not explain why the effect was\nstronger for men and younger people\nokay\nwe propose that there is something about\nindividual in that enhances loneliness\nparticularly if other risk factors are\npresent so that's kind of interesting\nwe found that loneliness was higher\namong men than women which is contrary\nto the findings from the ons 2018 survey\noh interesting so it seems like in\nprevious research this has not been\nfound to be the case\num so\nthat might mean that men need particular\nconditions to speak about loneliness etc\netc you all can read this paper if you\nwant to it's in the public domain\nso here's another thing to mention\nas already indicated uh it must also be\nkept in mind that we used a large\nnon-representative sample of\nparticipants who volunteered to speak\nabout their feelings of loneliness\nfinally it is important to acknowledge\nthat the effects we found were very\nsmall although consistent across all\ndimensions\nwe take this to mean that those effects\nare real and loneliness is a fairly\nuniversal experience across demographic\ncategories\ndata also provided by a large sample of\nindividuals found different ages and\nfrom a large number of different\ncountries\nthus providing statistical power\nthe key thing here is that if we\nactually look at the effect sizes of\ngender\nand i'm a little bit rusty on statistics\nbut i think this is a relatively small\neffect size right so we're talking about\nuh seven percent to\nten\ni guess\n0.07\nnegative 0.07 to 0.1 is a relatively\nsmall effect size so while this paper\nsays it is true that young men from\nindividual cultures are the most lonely\ngroup\nthat we've been able to find\nthat number they're not so much more\nlonely than other people\nright they are lonelier but not by a\nwhole lot\nand that's where we've got to be really\ncareful because when someone pairs\nthis kind of statistic right and now we\nstart to see something that's kind of\ninteresting because like\nthis person just uses the word\nloneliness he doesn't say lonely\nby a very small margin\nand then when we see 62 percent of users\nare men\nbased on research from 2015 we start to\nconstruct this idea that lonely like\nthere's an epidemic of large\nof lonely single men now i do think that\nthis is true but i don't think that the\ngender dynamic is as disparate as people\nthink it is and that's what the research\nwould say the other really really\ndevastating thing about this that that i\nwas really kind of hesitant on\nis this person talks about fixing a\nskill deficit which we're going to talk\nto you all today a little bit about how\nto do that because even though i\ndisagree with some of the statistics i\nthink the point that the person says is\nvery good which is that generally\nspeaking women you know may be looking\nfor emotionally available good\ncommunicators and that probably\ncorrelates with health health and\nhappiness in relationships so we're\ngoing to teach y'all a little bit later\nabout how to be emotionally available\nwhat does that actually mean right\nbecause everyone's like oh like i'm\nlooking for someone who's emotionally\navailable and if you're like if you're\nlistening to that it's like okay how do\ni do that we're going to teach y'all\nthis is what's kind of interesting so\nthe this person also\ncites this article\nwhich is from the pew research center\nokay so pew research center is a pretty\nlegitimate research organization but\nonce again not necessarily peer-reviewed\nscientific\npublication\nbut the interesting thing is that as you\ntunnel down into what the the pew\nresearch center shows\nit doesn't talk about\nyou know men being single because of\nemotional unavailability\nwhat it actually talks about is kind of\ninteresting\nso let me try to find this the growing\ngap in economic success between\npartnered and unpartnered adults may\nhave consequences for single men who\nwould eventually like to find a partner\nin a 2017 pew research center survey 71\nof adults said being able to support a\nfamily financially is very important for\na man\nto be a good spouse or partner\nsimilar shares of men and women said\nthis right so 71 of both men and women\nor 71 of men and women\nbelieve or 71 of adults in an equal\nshare of men and women believe that it's\nimportant for a man to be able to\nfinancially support a family in contrast\n32 percent of adults and just 25 percent\nof men said this is a very important for\na woman to be a good spouse or partner\nso if you really look at\nwhat\nmen and women value in terms of being\npartnered\nthis is a staggering difference between\nthe genders right a 32 versus 71 percent\ndifference\nin terms of how important is being able\nto financially support a family in terms\nof like for a man versus a woman\nso what we start to see is like a lot of\ninteresting things right so if you look\nat\nuh\nunpartnered versus partnered adults\nright so unpartnered adults are\n29 of them have completed a bachelor's\ndegree whereas 41 of partnered adults\nhave a bachelor's degree we start to see\na difference between our employed\num 75 versus 82 percent\nright 35 000 median income versus 49 000\nmedian income that's pretty wild we're\ntalking about a 40\nincrease in income that results in being\npartnered\nuh there's also interesting things like\nliving at home right so\num\nthe the percentage of partnered people\nwho live at home so if you're in a\nrelationship two percent of people live\nat home whereas if you're not in a\nrelationship 28 of people are living at\nhome\nso as this\ntable kind of goes down what we start to\nsee is that\nmen who are unpartnered\n73 of them are employed whereas 91\npercent of them who have partner of\nemployed uh partnered men are employed\nwhereas if you look at the gap for women\n74 versus 77\nthis implies that employment is a far\ngreater aspect for men in relationships\nthan women\nright now now i'm not saying that this\nis universally true we're just looking\nat statistics critically because the\nreally interesting thing here is that\nthis paper that this person\ncites over here to support his argument\nthat men are lonely\ndoesn't actually have anything to do\nwith emotional availability\nright\nthis you know like\na percentage of people that are\nfinancially vulnerable men the partnered\nmen 13 percent for as unpartnered men 36\nwhereas women tends to be like pretty\neven\nokay\nso the point here is that as we're\nlooking at this\nwe have to be kind of critical because\nwhat the data actually suggests is that\nif you look at men versus women and\npeople who are partnered and unpartnered\naccording to this one pew research\nsurvey right\nwhat it seems to imply is that economic\nstability in terms of a man for a man\nleads to a far greater impact on their\nrelationship success than a woman\nnow if you're a woman who's out there in\nthe audience and you're saying\nif you take issue with that like that's\ntotally fine you're allowed to take\nissue with it\nyou're allowed to be critical of it i'm\nnot saying that this is truth this is\njust one pew research survey which sort\nof demonstrates this the reason that\nwe're bringing it up\nis because if you're reading an article\nlike this and it says be more\nemotionally available we've got to be\nkind of careful about where that\ndirection is coming from so i do think\nit's very important for men to become\nmore emotionally available like i think\nthat's like really really important\nwe're going to talk about that in a\nsecond\nbut let's just be a little bit clear\nabout you know is there a rise of lonely\nsingle men\nsure\nbut\nit's not\nlike\nyou know it's not as catastro i mean\nit's not as imbalanced according to the\nsources we looked at today that we're\nlooking at a relatively small effect\nsize and for men as compared to women we\nalso are living in a society where i\nthink part of the reason that men really\nstruggle to find relationships is\nbecause as we've started to see an\nimprovement in equality in the workplace\nwe have not seen\na similar cultural shift\nright so for example\nthere's still like a lot of you know\nlack of equality in the workplace like\n17 to 21 of people who graduate with\nengineering degrees are women right so\nit's still like an 80 dominated field\nbut we're seeing some progress in some\nareas so now for example 52 to 55\npercent of medical students are women as\nopposed to men\nright so we're seeing evening out in\nsome fields a lack of evening out in\nother fields i've seen tons and tons of\nstories about misogyny in like video\ngame development and things like that so\ni'm not saying that everything is\nhunky-dory for women in the workplace\nbut what we are seeing is that it\nappears that both men and women\nare\nlikely to judge a man more harshly for a\nlack of employment than a woman\nright so that's what the research sort\nof suggests\nnow\nlet's take a moment to like understand\nwhy this narrative that single lonely\nmen gets attacked\nso i think sometimes what happens is\nwhen people are lonely\nthey start to become a little bit toxic\nright so there's a community of men\nwho's sort of like super into the toxic\nmasculinity\nis quite misogynistic\nand so what we tend to see is that\nyou're lonely you sort of there's all of\nthese like men out there that are sort\nof engaged in this kind of like toxic\nmasculinity approach or mice let's\nforget about toxic masculine let's just\ncall it misogyny and then what tends to\nhappen what i've observed is that\nas people respond to the misogyny\nright both men and women who are like\nhey stop being an [ __ ] what it\nactually does is as you attack the\nmisogyny what you're sort of doing is\nthat you're you're kind of disregarding\nthe loneliness at the root which sort of\nmakes sense right so if i'm lonely and i\nstart to become an [ __ ] and people\nlike don't like that i'm being an\n[ __ ] and criticize me for being an\n[ __ ] et cetera et cetera et cetera\nthat sort of makes sense and what it\nactually does is\nbypasses the fact that i'm lonely to\nbegin with so it's almost like what\nwhat's happening is we're getting an\ninvalidation of lonely men because\nas lonely men gravitate towards\npolarizing figures that are misogynistic\nand remember this is the internet so the\nmore inflammatory your perspective the\nmore likely it's it's to be upvoted\nso there's like this rise of misogyny\nthere's a devaluation of the misogyny\nand in the devaluation of the misogyny\nwhat you're having with it is a\ndevaluation of the underlying loneliness\nright does that make sense\nbecause it's hard to say when someone is\nbeing like cruel and and sexist that oh\nyeah like you're suffering too like your\nyour your underlying points are valid\nbecause all we do is respond to that\ntoxicity at the top\nand so this is something that's i think\nreally really devastating because what's\nhappening is that in an effort to try to\nsupport these lonely men what we're\nactually doing is adopting views\nthat are very\njustifiably criticized\nbut in justifiably criticizing those\nparticular views we're actually\ninvalidating the core of the problem\nand this is what's so hard about it is\nif i'm a lonely single man and there's a\ncrowd of people who are invalidating a\nselect group of misogynistic people\nwho are like you know promoting\nconnection in their own way right or\ngetting laid or whatever\nright like what we're sort of doing is\nwe're losing sight of the fact that the\npeople that resonate with those\ncommunities are lonely to begin with and\nthat that's a real problem\ndo you all get that like it's nuanced\nlike the complaints i think are valid\nit's the adaptation to the complaint\nwhich is also justifiably criticized but\nbut the root of the loneliness is\nabsolutely there and i do think that\nthis is a real problem right so this is\nnot like a just because research\nsuggests that\nyou know the discrepancy between men and\nwomen is not that big that's irrelevant\nlike it's not a competition right if\nthey're me lonely men and lonely women\nwe should address both of those things\nand saying that oh it's not like men are\nmuch more lonely than women doesn't\nactually help because there's still a\ngigantic pile of lonely men you can't\ninvalidate just because i've got\ntesticular cancer and someone else has\nbreast cancer doesn't mean oh you've got\ntesticular cancer this person has breast\ncancer so screw everybody\nno both of these people need help\nright like loneliness is a problem for\neach gender and the reasons for the\nloneliness can be specific and gender\nspecific\nand there are for example like\ndifferential experiences with dating\napps and even though the the time\narticle said in 2015\nyou know it's dated but they cited that\n14 percent of women swipe right versus\n46 percent of men swipe right\nright and if that's true that's a\nstaggering difference in terms of dating\nbehavior and will probably be affecting\nmen and women differently now why do\nwomen\nswipe right on 14 of time who knows\nmaybe does it have to do with employment\ndoes that have to do with media and\nincome does it have to do with emotional\navailability like who knows\nand just because\nwomen are more like or more selective on\ndating apps than men doesn't mean that\nwomen have it easy on dating apps y'all\nget that like you can have an advantage\nas a gender but that doesn't mean that\nlike on the blanket that everything is\neasy for you\nbecause\nmost of the time when i hear about\ncomplaints around dick pics\ninappropriate sexual behavior things\nlike that\nright it's like the women who are\ncomplaining\nso it's not like they have it easy and\nthis is what we've got to be really\ncareful about is if we want to try to\nhelp people we can't invalidate\nsomeone's perspective just because we're\nsuffering it's not a competition and\nit's not like the amount of help\nto go around is limited\nwhat limits it is our own perspective\nwhat limits the amount of help is like\nthe compassion that we give or don't\ngive when someone else says i'm\nstruggling\nnow let's talk for a second about\nso just to kind of summarize you know i\nthink this is a good article\ni think it's an opinion and it's\nimportant to remember that this is\nopinion\nif you find it inflammatory or if you\nfind it validating both are reasonable\nperspectives as we tunnel down into the\nresearch i think the story that they\nsort of end up telling is very different\nfrom what the research actually suggests\nthat's important to remember\nis there a rise of single lonely men yes\nis the most vulnerable population\nfor loneliness in today's world\nyoung men from individual cultures that\nis also a factual statement\nturns out that the size is not that big\nthe discrepancy is actually not that big\nbut\nthe reasons for the partner versus\nunpartnered right the reasons to be in a\nrelationship do seem to be heavily\ninfluenced by gender\nso i think we live in a world where\ndespite\nan improvement in equality between men\nand women there is a lag of social\nacceptance for employment and financial\nrelated issues for men now this is where\nlike you know the a lot of the the\npro-men kind of people will talk about\noh like all you got to do is make money\nand grind and all this kind of stuff and\nthat's all women care about i think\nthat's a simplistic view right i don't\nthink that that's the case\nand and anyone who kind of says oh oh if\nyou want to attract a man all you need\nto do is this if you want to attract a\nwoman all you need to do is this has no\nidea that like i don't know if you'll\nget this but men and women are human\nbeings\nthat have individual preferences\nand some women don't care about how much\ntheir partner makes and some women do\nsome men do care about how much their\npartner makes and some men don't i know\nit's shocking\nbut the behaviors of a gender cannot be\nreduced to a gender and there's\nindividual variation\nlike i know this is kind of weird as\nwell but\nthere are actually some men who don't\neven want to sleep with women can you\nall believe that and there are some\nwomen who are actually not interested in\ndating a man no matter how much money\nthey have\nright like there are individual\nvariances amongst people and so we've\ngot to remember that\nnow let's move on to one last thing from\nthe article i know it's it's bizarre\nit's bizarre\nyou know wait till some of those you\nknow\nsome of the\nthe pickup artist crew figures that out\nthey're gonna be shocked\nall right\nso\nlet's talk about emotional availability\nfor a second\nso like if you're in this situation and\ni think the article is decent right so\nit's psychology today so you know it's\ngoing to be an opinion piece that's\nwritten by someone who's got a bunch of\nexperience cites a couple of statistics\nand then sort of concludes that men need\nto rise up and step up to the challenge\nof emotional availability i don't quite\nagree with that because i think a lot of\nthis is societal right so i think that\nas you look if 71 of people think that\nmen need to have you know be able to\nfinancially support a job versus 32\npercent of women i mean financially\nsupport a family versus 32 percent of\nwomen believe that you know a woman\nshould financially support a family and\nthe economy is getting worse we're\ngetting you know wage stagnation we're\nsort of seeing more inflation\nmore people are living at home and\nthings like that those economic forces i\nthink are adversely affecting men more\nso than women in terms of a dating world\nokay\nthat too if you disagree with you're\nmore than welcome to disagree with it i\nhaven't done a thorough like literature\nsearch on it i'm just using the sources\nthat were cited in the article to come\nto that conclusion and hopefully i think\nthat's a pretty fair conclusion right so\naccording to pew research we see\ndifferent things in men and women in\nterms of income and stuff\nso as like financially the world gets\nharder it's affecting men\ndisproportionately to women\nso\nin terms of dating\nnow once again that doesn't mean that\nthings are easy for women in this\ncurrent world because there are going to\nbe other things that are going on today\nfor example the ease of which you can\nget doxxed and get stalked and things\nlike that that i think are\ndisproportionately affecting women\nright so society is changing and each\ngender is getting screwed in different\nways\nand trying to like compete about it is\nlike not worth our time\nso what does it mean to be emotionally\navailable\nso this is where we we've been trying to\nfigure out\nwhat is the mechanism through which\ncoaching works\nso we tend to see is that when people\ncome into coaching they form better\nrelationships they actually do better\nprofessionally\num you know they they start to form\nhealthier boundaries and things like\nthat so like they form better\nrelationships with family members they\neven will start to date form better\nrelationships with things like roommates\nand romantic partners and stuff like\nthat your mileage may vary but we've\nseen this general trend\nso we were trying to figure out okay how\ndoes this happen and what we sort of\nsettled on was this concept of emotional\nquotient or eq\nso when we talk about emotional\navailability i think a really good way\nto think about this is is having a low\neq versus a high eq and the components\nof eq are things like awareness of what\nyou are feeling\nanother thing is the ability to\nself-regulate what you are feeling\na third thing is being able to\ncommunicate what you are feeling\na fourth thing is to be able to set\naside what you are feeling in an effort\nin in the ability to be empathic to\nsomeone else\nand the fifth thing is an understanding\nof how your emotions\ninfluence your behaviors\nokay\nso i'm going to share a story with y'all\nso\na couple years ago i had a client who\nwas sort of in this situation where they\nhad this surprise set up for valentine's\nday for their significant other they\nwere going to take them to a particular\nlike cool place in town they'd made\nreservations and stuff like that\nright so and it turns out that a couple\nweeks before because it was like the hot\nyou know happened in a new place so a\ncouple weeks before turns out that their\nsignificant other is\nout with their friends\nand they spontaneously decide to go to\nthat same location\nso\nin in the client's mind like they had\nsort of set everything up to have this\nlike magical valentine's\nday experience\nand their partner goes and like goes\nthere and checks it out kind of on their\nown with other friends they're also like\nso there's a\nclient is male their significant other\nis female\nand so they're also like men in the\ngroup and things like that so this is\nthe kind of situation where this person\nhas invested a lot of time and energy to\ncreate a wonderful surprise\nfor their partner and their partner goes\nand ruins it\nokay\nruins it\nby going on their own\nand now this person really struggles\nbecause like did their partner actually\ndo anything wrong no not at all like\nthey were out with their friends they\ndecided to go hit up that place and it's\nlike the other thing is like it's a\nsurprise\nright like so it's not like the partner\nknew like if they had told them hey by\nthe way i made reservations i think it's\ngoing to be like awesome i want to like\ncelebrate this like new opening with you\non valentine's day it's not like they\ncommunicated they're trying to make it a\nsurprise\nand so\nthis person felt really resentful right\nlike oh my god like you took this like\nor this beautiful night is now ruined\nbut you can't really criticize the\npartner for it\nbecause the partner really didn't know\nright like so she wasn't really doing\nanything wrong\nand it's still ruined so what do you do\nin that situation\nso you can't criticize them because you\nknow they didn't do anything wrong so\nbut that feeling of resentment and stuff\nlike that starts to come out in a lot of\npassive aggressive behavior\ndid you have fun\nyeah it was great are you upset about\nsomething no i'm not upset\nforget it\nwe don't need to hang out this weekend i\ni gotta i gotta study\ni've got a final coming up\nwhy don't you make other plans for\nvalentine's day\nand then like the esso is like wait\nwhat's going like i'm confused or did i\ndo something wrong no you didn't do\nanything wrong\nright\nso what does this mean\nlet's look at it awareness of the\nemotion\ndoes this person have awareness of\nemotion no\nsort of right\nthey understand that they feel resentful\nkind of can they communicate it\nlike they don't really even know what to\ncommunicate\nbecause\nit feels so stupid to them\nso they're not able to regulate that\nemotion because it's like i you ruined\nit even though i can't fault you for it\nbut you still ruined it\nright and so like because you know the\ncriticism isn't fair\nand so that you're unable to\nself-regulate you're not really aware of\nwhat you're feeling you certainly can't\ncommunicate it right because you don't\nknow what you're feeling and it feels so\npetty\nit feels so damn petty\nand then what happens is you're not\naware of how your emotions shape your\nbehavior\nso you know you're angry with them but\nyou can't be kind of like mature about\nit right so like you start playing this\npassive-aggressive kind of game\nand then your partner is really confused\nabout it\nyou can't really communicate with them\nso this is an example of what being\nemotionally unavailable means\nso another good example of this that\nsometimes is is more common in men than\nwomen is um\nproblem solving versus listening\nso often times these are like\ngeneral kind of accepted things i\nactually haven't seen a bunch of great\nresearch especially recently about this\nstuff so i think some of this stuff may\nbe dated\nbut\nyou know there's this impression that\nmen are more problem-solving and women\nare more like supportive when dealing\nwith problems okay so like and i don't\ncare if men are more this way or women\nor more that way it doesn't really\nmatter what matters is that for you to\nunderstand that if you're in a\nrelationship what does it mean to be\nemotionally available it's to ask\nyourself when your partner comes to you\nwith a problem\nsomething that is not going well in\ntheir life\nfor you to stop for a second and think\nabout what is this person looking for\nare they looking for help in solutions\nor are they looking to vent\nand oftentimes a big mistake that a lot\nof people will make\nis that they'll try to provide solutions\nwhen someone really just wants to vent\nright it's like you know oh man like my\nplace is such a mess\nyou know it's like there's like i don't\neven know where to start and it's like\nokay here let's get a piece of paper i\nset an alarm for sunday at 9 00 a.m and\nlet's make a list of things for you to\nclean clean this first take out the\ntrash sort through your mail do this do\nthis do this do this and like the person\nknows how to do that they're just\nyou know\nit's like wow yeah that sucks\nyou ever get to the point where in\ncleaning where you're like i don't need\nto clean yet i don't need to clean yet i\ndon't need to clean yet and then\nsuddenly\nthere's too much to clean\nright those responses\nare very different\ny'all get that\nso\ni do think emotional availability is\nimportant is it arguably more important\nfor men sure\nso there's older research that suggests\nthat you know men are raised in a\nparticular way that they learn to manage\ntheir emotions differently\nare women looking for emotionally\navailable men i\ni assume so i think that\nmen are also looking for emotionally\navailable women\nand what are we basing that on we're\nbasing that on what people say\nwhen they call in to a tick-tock show\nabout dating\nright but\nthis is the other thing sometimes we'll\npeople will say things when they call\ninto shows that are actually different\nfrom what they're at what they're\nactually looking for\nso when it comes to for example like\ndating research it seems like what you\nknow what leads to more success is a\nbetter median income a college degree\nbeing able to live and support a fine\nyou know family and things like that\nso at the end of the day though you know\ni think that becoming more emotionally\navailable is like really fantastic for\nmen women and everyone involved like eq\nimprovement is good for all human beings\ndo men need some more improvement on\nthat maybe need some instruction on that\nmore so than women maybe\nso that's why what we're sort of talking\nabout is okay what is emotional\navailability it comes down to a couple\nof things\nfirst is awareness of your emotions\nsecond thing is the ability to regulate\nyour emotions the ability to communicate\nyour emotions the ability to set aside\nyour emotions for the sake of empathy\nright and try to understand the other\nperson's perspective or feel what the\nother person is feeling\nand the last is to be aware of how your\nemotions influence your behavior\ndoes that make sense\nso hopefully\nthis was an acceptable foray into the\nrise of lonely young men\ndo i think it's a problem yeah do i\nthink that men\nyoung men from individualistic cultures\nare the most at risk group for\nloneliness sure\nand it turns out that we've got to be a\nlittle bit careful because i don't think\nthey're lonely just because they don't\nknow how to be emotionally available\ni think if you look at the research\nthere's a lot of\nvery real demographic and worldly\nfactors that are contributing to this\nincluding what people are looking for in\nterms of a mate\nand also how the world makes it hard to\nbe those things\nbecause of very real economic forces\nand does emotional availability play\ninto it absolutely but i think we've got\nto be very very careful\nabout assuming that the responsibility\nlies solely with men\nright so anytime we're looking at gender\ndynamics we want to be careful about you\nknow whatever the gender is and whatever\nwe're talking about if we're talking\nabout equal representation at the\nc-suite level\nis this a societal problem or is this\nsomething that women need to step up\nright i don't think it's fair to say\nthat women need to step up in general i\ndon't think it's fair to say that a\nwhole demographic needs to step up\nbecause i think generally speaking\npeople try pretty hard\nright i don't think that like telling a\ngender or a race to step up like is fair\nlike indian people need to step up white\npeople need to step up black people need\nto step up i don't i don't think that\nthat's fair at all\nso do men have some responsibility in it\na hundred percent do they have a lot of\nresponsibility in it a hundred percent\nso should you become more emotionally\navailable absolutely should you boost\nyour eq absolutely will it improve your\ndating life in your professional life\nabsolutely\nand at the same time we need to\nacknowledge that this is not all on the\nshoulders of the individual\nright as human beings you can't blame an\nindividual for a systemic issue and the\ntruth of the matter is when it comes to\nsomething as complex as dating i don't\nthink it's an individual issue or a\nsystemic issue and it's just as\ndevastating\nfor men or women or whoever else to say\noh this is a society thing\nthere's nothing i can do let me throw\nout my hands oh it's like i'm screwed by\nsociety screwed by society and absolve\nyourself of all responsibility and not\ntry to actually improve yourself\nthe truth of the matter is that it's\nsomewhere in between\nright so this is what we learned from\nlike tons of research in the field of\nmedicine\nthings are multi-factorial\nbringing your cholesterol down is that\nbecause your doctor isn't good enough or\nbecause you're not exercising\nthe answer is it's a little bit of both\nright\nthere's shared responsibility and what\ni'm seeing more and more in gender\ndynamics and especially with things like\ndating and and stuff like that is that\nthere's no shared responsibility\neveryone's always trying to punt the\nresponsibility to everyone else so men\nare trying to punt the responsibility to\nsociety and society is trying to punt\nthe responsibility to men it's all your\nfault you need to grow up you need to\nstep up\nand on the flip side there are people on\nthe other extreme it's like oh like\nthere's nothing i can do\nand i think that's exactly why the\nproblem persists do you all get that\nlike that's\nin situations where people share\nresponsibility and like\nwe as a society say we need to do more\nto support men and as men say hey we\nneed to do more to grow as individuals\nthat's when the problem is going to get\nfixed\nbut right now all that's doing is we're\npassing the buck back and forth\nand that's why the problem is getting\nworse\nchat wants to know how to boost eq\ni wish it were so easy\nso let me kind of\ncounter that question so how do you\nboost iq\nright so it's like\nthe interesting thing about human stuff\nhuman behavior human attributes is the\nmore global the attribute the harder it\nis to operationalize how to improvement\nright so how do you become more\ncompassionate\nit's challenging\nso that's why we started by breaking\nthings down into the five components of\neq\nright so do you are you aware of what\nyou're feeling can you regulate what\nyou're feeling\ndo you\n[Music]\ncan you communicate what you're feeling\ncan you set aside what you're feeling\nare you aware of how your emotions\ninfluence your behaviors those are the\nfive big domains of eq\nso we do believe that coaching will help\nwith something like that i imagine\ntherapy will help with something like\nthat although interestingly enough the\neq research is predominantly not from\nthe field of psychotherapy or medicine\na lot of the eq research actually comes\nfrom the field of like business\nand like management and things like that\nso that's it's really interesting\num but i think like that's where those\nare the five steps um what do you have\nto say about eq not really being real as\nfar as it not being a scientific term\nbut one coined by a journalist who wrote\na book in the late 90s early 2000s i\nthink it's a valid perspective\nso that's where as you look at the how\nthe research has progressed\npeople took the term eq and they tried\nto figure out okay is this a real thing\nthat maps onto something that is\nscientific and measurable\nand in that research which once again\nremember comes out of management and\nstuff so that stuff is like a little bit\ndifferent\nright so it's what we've actually found\nis that there are domains of eq which\nare scientifically valid so awareness of\nemotions\nis absolutely a scientifically real\nthing\nthe ability to regulate your emotions is\nabsolutely a real scientific thing\nthe ability to be empathic is absolutely\na real scientific thing so i think the\ncool thing about eq research is that it\nmay have been coined by a journalist in\nthe business types right and i already\nsaid that most of it actually doesn't\ncome from science it comes from the\nbusiness world and then what's happened\nover the last 20 years is that\nscientists as more and more people have\nbeen looking at it they've been trying\nto figure out okay what part of eq is\nactually real and not real and that's\nwhy when we talk about eq and emotional\navailability what we try to do is\nshare with you all the scientifically\nvalid versions of eq which are the sub\ndomains\nit's a it's a good\ndoes that sort of make sense so like a\njournalist may have stumbled upon it and\nthen people thought oh this is kind of\ninteresting and they started doing\nmanagement trainings and things like\nthat and it seemed to help and then\nresearchers got curious and they're like\nwait a minute but what is this\nis it real and then they tunnel down\ninto it and this these are the\ndiscoveries that they made that i\npersonally think are valid which is why\nwe share it this way\nyou"
