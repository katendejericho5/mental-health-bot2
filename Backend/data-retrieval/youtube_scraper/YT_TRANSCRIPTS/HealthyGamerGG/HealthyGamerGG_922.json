    "transcript": "it's hard to be in this situation\nbecause\neveryone is out there telling you what\nthe answer is but you can't seem to do\nit you get so frustrated with yourself\nthat you're looking for some\nout-of-the-box creative solution because\nthe strategy you've been using hasn't\nbeen working analysis paralysis of my\nown feelings and being tired of\nembracing my emotions\nokay\nlet's take a look\ni don't know if this is the right timing\nto ask on mental health it's literally\n4am on the east coast\nuh but here we go long post imagine that\nyou have analysis paralysis there are\nnumerous web articles that talk about\nthis and the answers are similar don't\nsweat over things\nlearn to overcome perfectionism realize\nthat failure at some point is inevitable\npractice self-compassion focus on\ndealing with your anxiety\nphysiologically aim for good enough\ninstead of very good yada yada\naccept good enough is the exception\nwhile underperforming is the norm and i\ndon't even know well\nwell how to be good enough and it's on a\nperhaps a very basic executive function\ndoing a task and stay relatively focused\nwhile not having a major emotional\nrestraint from it\nwhile i'm getting better at the doing a\ntask and stay relatively focused one not\nhaving a major emotional restraint like\ndistress anxiety demotivation craving\ndistraction remains very hard for me\nthe point of the confusion is there are\nso many emotional reasons to make me\navoid work one day it could be anxiety\nnext day it could be demotivation and\nthe next day it could be my cravings to\ninternet and overeating that make me\nbrowse the net for hours and so on\nand i've i've made and tried so many\nstrategies and meta strategies\nstrategies on strategies\non this but nothing seems to work well\ni even avoid listing my best strategies\nnow because i hate that any discussion\nof this topic might get laser focused to\nthose strategies only\ni'm done with critically analyzing my\nways i need out-of-the-box creative\nperspectives and reframings\nthis has been hindering my productivity\nforever any perspectives\ntldr i have a frequent analysis\nparalysis but instead of perfect versus\ngood enough it's good enough as the jack\npart jackpot and underperforming is the\nnorm\nall right\nso let's look at this\nsometimes we're on the struggle bus\nwe recognize that we've got a problem\nwe recognize that we it's hard for us to\nconsistently do work that's the core of\nthe issue\nand even in some ways we can train a\npart of it right i can train my my mind\nto stay on task for some amount of time\nbut then what happens\nis emotions get in the way\nand what i notice is on a day-to-day\nbasis i have different kinds of\nemotional crap going on one day i feel\nanxious one day i feel distressed one\nday i feel despair one day i i'm beating\nmyself up because i wasted yesterday\nand over time i feel more frustrated\nwith myself\nthis is a problem that needs to be fixed\nif it's a problem that needs to be fixed\nthere are solutions\nthere are multiple articles on the web\ntalking about analysis paralysis\nand they give us all kinds of answers\nand solutions\nof overcome perfectionism\nfocus on good enough\nright instead of very good\nacknowledge that failure is a part of\nthe learning process a lot of stuff that\nwe say right\nall those answers are out there\nand we read those answers and we know\nthose answers and we try to apply those\nanswers and we run into this emotional\nproblem\nand so over time we try strategy after\nstrategy after strategy after strategy\nand none of them seem to be working or\nthey work hit or miss not consistently\nand so now what i need is a different\nkind of strategy a meta strategy a\ncreative strategy an out-of-the-box\nstrategy i need some kind of inspiration\nthat'll fix this problem\nwhy does this happen to us why do we get\nstuck\nin analysis paralysis\nand looking for solutions why do why is\nit that there are solutions out there\nand they don't seem to work\nright if i could just do them because\nit's the right answer it's like stop\nbeing so perfectionistic okay\npractice self-compassion okay\nlike the answers are out there and\npeople say they work there's scientific\nstudies about them dr k talks about them\nmy friends talk about them they share\nthis with me i see it on my feed this is\nthe answer\nit's the answer\nwhy doesn't it work\nokay it's because of these emotions\nbut i'm tired of embracing my emotions\ni've been doing it for a while people\nhave been saying okay if you're stuck in\nanalysis paralysis embrace your emotions\nbut that doesn't i'm tired of doing that\ni want an answer i want a solution\nreally hard right\nit's hard to be in this situation\nbecause\neveryone is out there telling you what\nthe answer is but you can't seem to do\nit\nand like you get so frustrated with\nyourself that you're looking for some\nout of the box creative solution because\nthe strategy you've been using hasn't\nbeen working\nso let's try to understand what your\nstrategy is and why it doesn't work\nor has limited success let's say\nso the first thing\nso when we engage in analysis paralysis\nthe first thing that we've got to\nunderstand\nis the difference between cognition\nand\nemotional strategies\nso a cognitive strategy tends to be\nsolution focused\nproblem focused\nand i know it sounds kind of weird but\ni think sometimes\na cognitive strategy can masquerade as\nan emotional one\nokay\nso what does that mean so when people\nsay okay embrace your emotions what\npeople who are very very like kind of\nmetacognitive and hyper cognitive will\ndo\nvery common for gifted kids by the way\nis they'll actually use like a cognitive\napproach to emotions so they won't\nactually feel they'll analyze emotions\nso it's not actually embracing emotion\nit's analysis of emotion so let me give\nyou all an example\nso if we go back to this post\nright so\nlook at what this what they're doing\nnot having a major\nmajor a major emotional restraint\ndistress anxiety demotivation craving\ndistraction remains hard for me\nand they kind of say one day it could be\nanxiety next day it could be\ndemotivation next day it's cravings\nit could be my cravings to the internet\nand overeating\nso this is what's going on\nthey're analyzing what they experience\noh today this is\nanxiety today this is distraction\ntoday this is despair\ntoday this is frustration\nthis is actually a cognitive analysis\nof emotion\nand then what do you do when when you're\noperating in this kind of realm what you\nalso do is find solutions so what do\nthey do they're like oh okay so like\ni'm you know i have trouble i\nprocrastinate let's say\nso i'm going to read about\nprocrastination on the internet they\ncome up with solutions\nright so overcome perfectionism\nlearn to accept\nthat failure is a part of the process\nright\ndon't sweat\ndon't sweat it believe in yourself\nself-compassion\nthey're all these answers out there\nbut this too is cognitive\n100\nthis is all cognitive none of this is\nemotional work\nso there's another interesting example\nof this there are two kinds of empathy\nthere's cognitive empathy and there's\nemotional empathy\nand then you may ask yourself but wait a\nsecond isn't empathy empathic by nature\nno\nso this is what's really interesting if\nyou look at some studies what they show\nis that people who struggle to be\nempathic will essentially use cognitive\nreasoning\nas a substitute for empathy\nso like for example if i go to a funeral\nand everyone else is crying\nbut i don't feel sad\nwhat i'm going to do is cognitively\nfigure out okay how should i act\nempathic in this situation\nokay let me sniff an onion so i start\ntearing up and i'm gonna give people\nhugs and i'm gonna say consoling words\nit's a cognitive approach it's almost\nlike we're a robot pretending to be\nhuman when we use cognitive empathy\nright you all see that so this happens\nwhen we have an over alliance of\ncognitive\nstrength in our mind\nwith essentially like an iq eq imbalance\nso generally speaking we have iq which\nis our reasoning ability we have eq\nwhich is our awareness of emotions and\nthings like that\nand for some people what happens\nespecially if you've got high iq\nis that we start using this more so we\nlevel it up\nand since we get by with using iq for\nall kinds of things\nour eq\nstarts to kind of get rusty\nand then over time we'll develop this\nbalance where we become overly\nintellectual and if we become overly\nintellectual and not in touch with our\nemotions\nwe wind up with analysis paralysis\nbecause what we're trying to do is fix\nan emotion with a cognitive process\nwhich fundamentally\ncan work but it's it's hard and there\nare things that are missing\nso for example if you look at like\ncognitive restructuring cognitive\nbehavioral therapy things like that even\nthe yogic perspective of digestion of\nsome scars you can use cognition as a as\na method of processing some emotions but\ngenerally speaking we tend to be missing\na couple of things here so that's what\nwe're going to teach you so if you're\nstuck in analysis paralysis what do you\ndo because it's kind of weird because\neven this person now is saying\ni'm done with critically analyzing my\nways i guess i need an out of the box\ncreative perspective or reframing that's\nactually another cognitive solution do\nyou guys see this this is logical\nthis is not emotional\nall of their solutions are logical in\nnature they're all cognitive in nature\nthis is why they continue to fail\nbecause what someone does is they\nlogically say okay i i tried critically\nanalyzing let me try uncritically\nanalyzing let me try creative\ninspiration it's a logical thought\nprocess they're like a scientist who's\ntrying to figure something out you guys\nget this\ndo you all see that\nit's the same thing\nit's looking for a logical solution\nright they're trying to solve a problem\nthey're looking for a\nsolution you all get that\nso if you're looking for a solution\nthat is not embracing your emotions\nembracing your emotions is not about\nfixing them\nit's about embracing them\nit's about accepting them\nit's not about changing them\ndo you all get that\nso here's the thing\nif i accept something i accept it\nright take it as is\nand so as long as you're operating to\ntry to fix something or solution focused\nyou're not actually accepting it\nnow you can change after acceptance\nwhich we'll kind of talk about and this\nis what's so confusing for a lot of\npeople who are stuck in analysis\nparalysis because they're like wait a\nminute if i just accept it and i don't\ntry to fix it does that just mean i'm\ndoomed to suffer for eternity am i just\nsupposed to accept\nthat\ni'm procrastinating and undisciplined\nthat doesn't work for me that is not an\nacceptable solution because that means\ni'm going to continue procrastinating\nthat's the problem i'm trying to fix\nso they reject acceptance\nright because it's not acceptable\nto accept your procrastinating\nit seems so counter-intuitive\nthey're like are you just if i accept\nthat i'm procrastinating i just accept\nit if i don't try to fix it that means\ni'm going to be procrastinating the rest\nof my life that's what i want to fix\nthat's not acceptable to me\nso they start by rejecting acceptance\nso let's try to understand how to deal\nwith that because it's tough\nlet's start with this\nwhere do these states come from\nokay let's try to understand this\nwhen i feel an emotion\nthis emotion manifests in all kinds of\ncognitive ways so let me give you all an\nexample\nlet's say i have a three-year-old kid\nwho's afraid of the dark\nif that kid is afraid of the dark what\nare they gonna say\nthey're gonna say\ni'm afraid of monsters\nthey're going to say i'm going to have a\nnightmare\nthey're going to say all kinds of things\ni'm feeling sick\nto try to meet this emotional need\nso when we have an emotional\nwhen we have a powerful emotion that is\nsubsurface it manifests as all kinds of\ndifferent cognitive ways\nthese\nare probably have a shared root\nright so if you think about distraction\nfor example and this person definitely\nhas this kind of thing too or not\ndefinitely i mean we don't really know\nbut\nso when we find ourselves using coping\nbehaviors like craving the internet and\ncraving\novereating\nthese coping behaviors are a sign of a\nsubsurface emotion because why do we\novereat to make ourselves feel better\nthat satisfaction in our brain from\neating like calorie dense food\nactually like overcomes some negative\nemotion right that's why people develop\neating disorders sometimes\nsometimes the pathophysiology of it\nright why do we turn to the internet\nbecause we're feeling bad on the inside\nthe tricky thing is that when we\ncognitively analyze what we feel in this\nmoment we can apply a label and then go\nlooking for a solution\nbut all of these have a common root in\nan emotion\nbecause when we see this negative\nemotion we also use coping mechanisms\nso we have evidence here that there's a\ncore emotion\nthat is creating all these different\nmanifestations and it's just like this\nright it's just like the three-year-old\nwhere they're gonna come up with all\nkinds of reasons but i can check under\nthe bed and say there's no monsters\nthere\nand then the kid is going to turn to\nthis one and i'm going to sort of deal\nwith this and then the kid is going to\nturn to this one i'm going to deal with\nthis and the kid is going to turn with\nthis come to this one\ndoes that make sense it's like playing\nwhack-a-mole\nso another sign of subsurface emotion\nis that you're playing whack-a-mole with\nsurface emotions\nso you feel anxiety one day fear the\nnext day despair sadness they're all\nkind of popping up all the time all the\ntime all the time all the time\nand so you try to fix each of these\nthings with a different solution i'm\ngonna do research and i'm gonna do this\nthing then i'm gonna do this thing then\ni'm gonna do this thing then i'm gonna\ndo this thing\nand yet the problem persists why is that\nit's because you're not attacking the\nroot\nso how do we\ndecrease this\nbecause if we decrease the emotion\nthese things will reduce\nbecause this is the fuel\nfor this\nyou all get that\nhow do we\nreduce the energy of an emotion you\ndon't fix it\nyou can't fix an emotion\nright so if we look at something like\nwe teach our coaches a technique called\nreflective listening\nand the cool thing about reflective\nlistening is that it decompresses\nemotional energy\nthis is something that also therapists\nare very good at right so a therapist\nwhen you come in and you talk to a\ntherapist and you say i'm going through\na divorce\na good therapist won't\ncoerce your partner into staying with\nyou\nright therapists don't actually fix\nthings on the outside what they help you\ndo is decompress the emotions that you\ndeal with\nand as you decompress those emotions the\nbehaviors that arise out of those\nemotions the thoughts that arise out of\nthose emotions\nare the things that actually start to\nreduce\nso when i'm toxic to the people in my\nlife because i feel unloved\nas i'm able to voice that to a therapist\nand be honest with that emotion\nthat kind of goes down\nthe energy of the emotion goes down and\nthe toxic behavior reduces as well\nthat's how therapy works sometimes\nright therapy is complex and lots of\ndifferent ways to do it\nbut the key thing here is that you've\ngot to reduce the emotional energy\nand this person is doing a good job\nbecause they're trying to diagnose it\nright they're trying to figure out okay\nwhat do i feel what do i feel what do i\nfeel\nthe problem is that once they feel\nsomething the first thing that they try\nto do is fix it\nso instead what i would recommend is if\nyou're someone who is able to diagnose\nyour emotions cognitively then goes to\nsolutions on the internet tries to\nimplement those solutions with varied\nsuccess because there is value to that\nright what i recommend that you do\ninstead is ask yourself where is this\ncoming from\nokay i feel anxious today i feel\ndistractible what am i trying to\ndistract myself from\nwhat am i worried about\nanother question you can ask yourself\nthis is a tricky one\nif i get caught up in this anxiety\nwhat can i avoid thinking about\nbecause sometimes even negative emotions\ncan be\ndefensive mechanisms\nand then as you find that emotion\nrecognize because here's the tricky\nthing when we experience a negative\nemotion this is why it's so easy to\nreject and so hard to accept because we\ndon't want to feel that way\nwe want the feeling to go away we want\nto fix it so we never have to feel that\nway again\nthat is rejection of an emotion it is\nnot acceptance of an emotion\nand this is what's so cognitively\ndifficult about this because you may say\nto yourself wait but if i accept it and\ni don't try to fix it does that mean\nthat i'm doomed to experience this for\nthe rest of my life\nand that's where the big irony comes in\nbecause in accepting emotion is truly\nhow you get free of it and by trying to\nget rid of it\nyou fall into an analysis paralysis trap\nwhere it's haunting you all the time and\nmanifesting in a thousand different ways\nso the bizarre thing\nis actually yes\nyou have to accept that you may feel\nthis way for the rest of your life\nhow does that make you feel\nbecause the other thread that's running\nthrough this i don't know if you'll get\nthis\nthe other thread that's running through\nthis\ncould be wrong here right because i've\nnever talked to this person\nis a lot of frustration\nwith the self\ndo you all get that\ni've tried so many things so many things\nso many things so many things nothing's\nworking nothing's working nothing's\nworking nothing's working\nand so in the back of your mind\nwhen everyone has answers for what to do\nand they don't work\nwhat does that say about you\nworks for everyone else\ni've done the research\nsomething's busted\ndeep down core something is busted and\nwhen it's busted down there it manifests\nas all kinds of things\nbecause if i'm busted\nof course i'm going to be anxious about\nthe future because i don't have faith in\nmyself i don't have confidence in myself\nof course i'm going to have despair of\ncourse i'm going to distract myself\nthrough overeating because i'm busted\nand the next day that i wake up i spent\nall day binge eating yesterday and not\ngetting any work done what does that\nreinforce\nself-critical\nfrustration i'm busted\ni can't stop i'm out of control\nyou start to believe these things about\nyourself they become a really deep core\nof who you are and they manifest in all\nkinds of different ways\nso if you're in the analysis paralysis\ntrap\nstart by recognizing first of all\nwhether you're over emphasizing\ncognitive approaches\nand even then it may feel like you're\ndoing emotional work or not feel it's\ngonna you're gonna think you're doing\nemotional work but you're not actually\ndoing emotional work you're doing\ncognitive work you're analyzing things\nlike emotions\nand then as you come up with solutions\nthat's not what emotional work is\nemotions emotional work is not about\nsolutions\nit's about digesting and processing\nemotion and that's where just talking\nabout it is enough\nright we have decades of research on\ntherapy where the majority of what you\ndo is talk about it\nand that decompresses the emotion\nright there are other factors that can\ndecompress it as well\nso if you're kind of in this situation\nstart by recognizing you may not really\nbe doing emotional work at all and that\naccepting emotions is a huge part of it\nuncovering them is a huge part of it and\nyou can use some of these techniques\nlike asking yourself you know what am i\nanxious about what am i despairing about\nhow do i feel about myself\nhow does today make me feel about myself\nwhere is this anxiety coming from and in\ndoing that kind of work you can get to\nthe emotion\nand once you get to the emotion\nhopefully you can sit with it and not\ntry to fix it\nso be it\nand this is where the cognitive part of\nyou is going to rebel\nit's going to say but oh my god\nwhat about\ni can't sit with this it's too painful\nlet's fix it instead\nthat's so much better because hey if we\ncan figure out the solution to this\nthink about this we never have to feel\nthis way again if we can become master\nmeditators\nand meditate away all of our negative\nemotions then we will have emotion\nresistance at 100\nand we never have to feel pain again\nlet me learn how to be the best\nmeditator on the planet\nand in doing so you will become the\nworst meditator on the planet\nbecause meditation isn't about\naccomplishing something\neveryone does it to accomplish something\nincluding a lot of the original\nmeditators who are doing it to\naccomplish enlightenment\nnow we use it to accomplish reductions\nin our anxiety scales in a clinical\nsetting\nlet it be\nand notice the cognitive part of your\nmind as it rebels oh no no we can't let\nit be this means that my future is\ndoomed no\nit's not\nthat's the scary thing\nis that you can't\nlet it possibly be doomed gotta control\nit gotta fix it y'all get that\nyou can't actually let it be that\nterrifies you and as\nthat terrifies you you try to fix it and\nas you try to fix it you give in to the\nterror the terror starts to control you\nand then the whole cycle repeats\nso now we're going to practice a\nmeditation\nthat's related to this\nvery simple meditation\nso the next time\nyou're feeling\nnot great about something\nso i'll give you all kind of a more\nspecific\nidea\nthe next time\nyour mind is convincing you\nto not do something\nand don't go to the grocery store today\nah\ndon't work today\ncancel on your friends don't go to the\nparty\nsit\nback straight next straight eyes closed\nfirst start by noticing the rationale\nbecause any time your mind tries to\nconvince you to do something\nit gives you a rationale\ndon't go to the party because what if\nyou don't have fun\nit'll be a waste of a night\nso start by noticing the rationale\nand now set that aside and move a little\nbit deeper\nimagine that the rationale is up here in\nyour head\nand we don't really feel emotions in our\nhead\nas we start to move a little bit deeper\nlower\nmove to our neck\nstart to ask yourself\nwhat is the emotional consequence\nthat i would avoid\nby avoiding this task what am i trying\nto avoid here\nand if you're having trouble answering\nthat\nthere's a simple technique so just eyes\nclosed\nimagine going\ntell yourself okay i'm going to get up\nand i'm going to go\nand notice that there's going to be a\nreaction within you there's going to be\na rebellion a sudden rebellion a panic\nalmost within you no no don't go\nnotice what that is\nyou may feel it in your throat you may\nfeel it in your chest you may feel it in\nyour stomach\nnotice the emotion underneath the\nrationale\nand acknowledge that this part of your\nmind that you're trying to overcome\nis actually looking out for you\nas you feel that emotion maybe a\ntightness in the chest recognize that\nthe thoughts in your head are trying to\nprotect you from feeling that way\nand here you are beating up the thoughts\nin your head\nfrustrated with yourself when it's just\ndoing its job\nnotice the interplay between thoughts\nand feelings\nand now move closer towards the feeling\nset the thoughts aside\nand notice the fear\nnotice the worry\nthe desire not to be hurt\nand now let that emotion wash through\nyou\nit starts at the top of your head like\nthoughts\ncondenses down to physical sensations\nand imagine it\nentering from the top and\nwashing through you\nalmost like rain\nthat starts at the top of your head\nand then makes its way down\nand drips off\ndon't try to fix it\ndon't try to resist it\njust let it be\nand notice that the pain may well up\nthe emotion may increase\nand have compassion for yourself\nfor suffering in this\nway it must hurt to feel this\nit must hurt\nto have your life controlled by this\nacknowledge how hard it is for you\nthis feeling that you're feeling right\nnow\nlife is not easy\nand now take a deep breath in through\nyour nose\nslowly breathe out\nwith each breath\nimagine shaking off the rest of that\nrain\ntilt your head up slightly\nas if looking up towards the sky\njust very slight\nkeep your neck mostly straight\ndeep breath in\nexpand the chest\nthe deep breath raise your arms\nalmost into a t pose expand the chest\nstretch\nas you exhale\nbring your arm bring your arms up above\nyou have them touch fully extended above\nyour head\nbreathe in\nand then as you exhale let them rest\ncome down slowly slowly slowly\nmove back into a sitting position\nneck straight back straight arms\nstraight or arms relaxed\nnow notice the vigor that you feel the\nawakening\nsee the strength that you have within\nyou\nand now return to your task\nand ask yourself\ncan i do this today\nam i strong enough to do this today\nam i strong enough to do something right\nnow\nand you may notice that it feels\noverwhelming\nand if so let it be\nwe can try later\nimagine yourself like a child who's\nabout to go perform on stage\nand if the child isn't ready we don't\nwant to shove them out on stage\nforce them to perform\nshould they perform 100\nwill they perform 100\ndoesn't have to be today\nand at the same time\nnotice that you can do it today\nwith a little bit of love\na little bit of a push a little bit of\nencouragement that's what you need to do\nit today\nnot beating yourself up and being\nfrustrated and feeling broken\nencouragement\nwhat can you do today\nplace\na little bit of faith in yourself\nbecause you can't just have faith in\nyourself it has to be put there\nnotice the strength and energy the\nvitality of your body in this moment\nand put a little faith in yourself\nthat you can do something today however\nsmall it is\nand maybe you can do the task that you\noriginally set out to\ntry\ngive it a shot\ngo get em\nwith a final breath deep breath in and\nas you exhale\nslowly come back\nopen your eyes\nyou"
