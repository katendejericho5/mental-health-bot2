    "transcript": "i'm addicted to this thing but the\nalternative is cutting it out completely\nand then like i'm gonna be bored you're\nasking me to be bored instead of having\nfun i don't like being bored internet\naddiction is really hindering my life as\nmuch as i try to delude myself into\nthinking the contrary there is no doubt\nthat i have a bit of an internet an\naddiction to the internet whenever i try\nto complete important tasks in my life\nsuch as studying homework or working out\ni i'm easily distracted by youtube\nvideos listening and listening to music\neven going as far as mindlessly\nscrolling the garbage content on\nsnapchat\nit feels however that even though i'm\naware of this problem i don't know how\nor i'm not willing to fix it\ni guess willpower isn't enough but i\nshouldn't have to be completely\ni shouldn't have to completely cut out\naccess to my favorite apps or videos\neven in doing so like joining the study\nchannel here i get distracted and\nexplore the rest of the server looking\ninto every text channel this issue of\ntechnology addiction has been afflict\naffecting my ability to enjoy life\ni don't have real hobbies other than\nwatching videos or tv\ni never have the patience to read or\nlearn an instrument or be active the act\nof working out is such a large and time\nconsuming task to me because the whole\ntime i'm distractedly watching videos\nit takes up my whole day and then it's\nmy free time\nso\nthis is kind of an interesting conundrum\nthat many people fall into\nwe're addicted to technology\nwe're addicted to the internet\nand if we want to approach this and\nunderstand this i think there are a lot\nof really really great\nkey\ninsights in this post\nthat we're going to touch on one at a\ntime\nokay\nso let's take a look\nso\nthe first thing that this person said\nwhich i want to focus on\nis\nthat they're easily distracted\nso we're going to talk about how that\nhappens and why that happens\nthe next thing\nis i said something beautiful\nam not\nwilling\nor\nam unable\nto quit\nokay\nso this is really important\nnext thing they say this is really great\ni shouldn't\nhave to\ncut out\nmy favorite apps\nso i want you all to understand this for\na moment\nis really important\nwe shouldn't have to cut it out\nthere has to be a way\nfor me to enjoy the internet without\nbeing addicted to the internet there's\ngot to be a middle ground\nit's unfair\ni shouldn't have to cut it out\nwhy is life like this\nwhy can't i enjoy youtube and be\nmotivated to do things\nyou all get that\nand then the last thing\nis i never have patience to do stuff\nso\nlet's unpack this okay so internet\naddiction and technology addiction is\nbecoming more and more common\nand as we struggle with it we realize\nhey this is a problem this is a problem\ni get so easily distracted\ni get sucked into stuff for hours at a\ntime\nand i don't know what's wrong with me i\ndon't know if it's like there's a part\nof me that doesn't want to give it up\nor am i unable to give it up i can't\ntell is this like an addiction or is\nthis like unwillingness\nand by the way it's not fair that i\nshould have to give it up\nright i shouldn't have to like be free\nfrom youtube for the rest of my life\nlike that doesn't sound fair\nand i'm noticing that i don't have the\npatience to do stuff\nso we're going to talk for a second\nabout addiction\nso the basic problem with addiction\nis when you're addicted to something\ngiving up the addiction means giving up\nfun\nmeans making your life just less\nenjoyable than it could be\nthis is something i've seen in any kind\nof addiction so let's take alcohol\naddiction for example\ni can go to parties and be sober\ni can go to a nice meal and not have a\nglass of wine\nbut\nif i have a nice glass of wine if i'm\nrelaxing on the beach with a cocktail it\njust enhances my enjoyment right it just\nmakes life more full more complete\nif i go to a barbecue not being able to\nhave a beer like yeah i can still have\nfun and socialize and eat something but\nlike having a couple of cold beers like\nor going in the pool and like having a\ncold beer like it just enhances my life\nand so the struggle against addiction\nthis is actually what makes it so\ndevastating\nis that when you have someone who's\naddicted to something and you ask them\nto give it up\nwhat they're doing is is lowering the\ncap of happiness on life from 100\nto like 75\n80\nand that's what makes it so tricky\nbecause it's like\ni could just make this experience better\nif i\nif i engaged in this thing that i'm\naddicted to there's got to be some way\nthat like i can\nnot have a problem with alcohol and\nstill gain all of the maximal enjoyment\nfrom some of these experiences with\nalcohol like having a nice glass of wine\nor having a cocktail on the beach\nthere's got to be some way and so when\nwe're addicted to the internet we do the\nsame thing\nthere's got to be some way for\nmoderation right\ni i don't need to cut out snapchat and\nyoutube entirely like that just that\nsounds like what am i gonna do like i'm\ngonna be bored all the time\ni'm addicted to this thing but the\nalternative is cutting it out completely\nand then like i'm gonna be bored you're\nasking me to be bored instead of having\nfun i don't like being bored i hate\nbeing bored it's the worst thing in the\nworld\nso it feels like i shouldn't have to cut\nit out there's got to be some middle\nground there's got to be something i can\ndo right abstinence only doesn't work\nespecially when it's internet addiction\nwhat are you telling me i'm never\nsupposed to check my email again\nso this is the challenge of being\naddicted to the internet\nbecause you don't want to cut it out or\nmaybe you can't cut it out\nand it's like using discord is like a\nhuge part of my social life it's become\nso ingrained with our whole life that we\ncan't cut it out or we feel like we\ncan't cut it out\nso let's try to understand step by step\nwhat's going on because this person has\ndone a fantastic job whoops this person\nhas done a fantastic job of of isolating\na couple of key aspects of internet\naddiction so let's start with number one\neasily distracted\nso technology is making us more\ndistractible 100\nbut what we're gonna tunnel down on is\nwhy it's hard to be productive\nwhen you are addicted to technology\nso i'm going to give you all this this\nexample\nso back in the day when i was trying to\nstudy at the library let's say 50 years\nago\ndid people get distracted\na hundred percent\nlike even in my day when i was in\ncollege like in 2001\ni would get distracted at the library\nthe challenge is that when i get\ndistracted\nwhat do i lose\nso when i get distracted i'm trying to\nstudy and my mind wanders and i lose\nabout 60 to 120 seconds\nmy mind starts to wander i start\ntwiddling with my pen i make a doodle on\nthe side of the page\nand then eventually like since i'm\nsitting in the library right and i'm on\nlike the fourth floor\nmy mind wanders back\nso it is normal for the mind to\nfluctuate\nthis is completely normal\nright so here's studying\nhere's studying\nand there are fluctuations\ncompletely normal\nnow how has technology changed this\nit's because now when i get distracted\nthe ease\nof slipping into something that deviates\nmy mind is way greater so now when i get\ndistracted and i open up let's say\nyoutube\ni go down here\nright so this is the initial distraction\nand then youtube suggests more things to\nme more things to me more things to me\nthat are very dopaminergic and engaging\nand so now a 60-second distraction\nbecause how hard is it\nto alt-tab over or open youtube or click\non another channel\nit and this is the thing technology is\ndesigned to make it so easy for us to\nslip in\nshortcuts shortcuts shortcuts\nauto login i now have like a fingerprint\naccessor for my phone so now if i i want\nyou all to think about this when people\nadded like biometric readings or\nfingerprint access for to bypass the\nsecurity and phones what did that do\nit cut down the time it's required to\nopen up an app\ndo you all get that\nso every year that goes by it used to\ntake me 10 seconds to put in my security\ncode\nnow it takes zero\nso what that means is that every second\nof distraction\nright from 0 to 60\nevery second i have a chance to go back\nto studying\nyou all get that\ni have a chance to get my mind in order\nbut now what's happening with technology\nit's becoming so sophisticated and so\nquick it's so easy to access things\nnow\nand once we slip into it\nwe get taken advantage of by the app so\nnow youtube is recommending things to us\nright and remember that apps are even\ndoing things like they're paying\nattention to how far down you scroll\nbefore you click on something so if i\nscroll\nlet's say there's\nfive things i can click on\nand\neach of these opportunities there's a\nchance i can go back to studying\nand i click on this one\nso what does the app learn next time\naround this one is going to be on top\nreduces my chance\nto be able to study\nyou all get that\nso we've always been easily distractible\nthe challenge is that the price\nthe cost we pay for being distracted is\nway worse now than it used to be because\nback in the day if i got distracted like\nif i want to like do something fun and\nnot be bored i gotta pack up all my\nstuff unplug my laptop put all my books\naway\nclose up my water bottle\nput my backpack on climb down four\nflights of steps step outside\nwalk to my dorm room to be able to queue\nfor a game of warcraft 3. it's a 20\nminute endeavor\nnow if i'm\nstudying at home\nand i can double click an icon and i\nfind a cue instantly\nway harder\ndoes that make sense\nthe price of distraction is way higher\nthan it used to be\nsecond thing to understand\nam\nnot\nwilling\nor unable\nto quit\nso\nwe could talk a little bit about\ndopamine here i think that's important\nbut i want i want you all to think about\nthis for a second okay so i recognize\nthere's going to be a little bit of\nirony here\nso\nwhat would your life be like what would\nyou really be giving up if you never\nwatched twitch\nor youtube again\nwhat would life be like what would\nactually happen\nthink about it for a second what would\nyou lose what would you gain\nright and i recognize that this is kind\nof weird right because we use these\nplatforms\nso the irony of like click bait is that\nlike even when we're making youtube\nvideos\nwe are trying to make compelling\nthumbnails\nbecause we've got an option right we can\ndeliver boring ass content with dry\nthumbnails we can dr kay can be like\nokay today we're going to talk about\ninternet addiction internet addiction\nhas a couple of key pieces it has\ndistractibility it has this it has that\nand people feel like they're unable or\nunwilling to to quit\nand\nfor our thumbnail we're gonna have a\nwhite background with black letters that\njust say internet addiction\nand we're gonna do monotone and we're\nnot going to play the click bait game\nand we're going to you know not use\nthese tactics\nand then that way no one will ever\nwatch the video we'll get like 117 views\nover the course of 10 years because\nit'll be buried by the algorithm\nbut we're going to stay pure right in\nfact actually what we're going to do\njust to stay pure and academic right\nbecause we don't want to use these\nthings\nwe're going to\ngrab\nthe massachusetts general handbook on\npsychiatry and we're going to teach you\nall today about neuroimaging and\npsychiatry\nin general neuroimaging is used as an\naid in the differential diagnosis of\nneuropsychiatric conditions\nrarely does it\nrarely does neuroimaging alone establish\nthe diagnosis\nlook at this\nso we gotta play the game\nright to try to help y'all\nwe gotta play too\nso this is what i want y'all to do ask\nyourself this question\nif you never watched youtube\nagain what would that be like and this\nis what this is the tricky thing i don't\neven care about the question\nif you guys really want to control this\nbehavior i don't care about the question\ni don't care about the answer what i\ncare about is the response\nin your body when i ask it\nwhat would it be like to never watch\nyoutube again and watch what happens in\nyour mind\nintellectually you'd say oh yeah that'd\nbe great i'd be free\nbut instinctively there's gonna be like\nthis ah no\ndon't take it away from me\nyou all see that\nlook at that\nso people in chat are saying pain panic\ntorture\nfomo\ndespair\nenvy hope all kinds of mixed up mixed up\nmixed up feelings\nam i not willing or unable to quit it's\na little bit of\nboth because you don't want to give it\nup\nwhat does that mean like this person\nwatches youtube videos while they're\nworking out am i supposed to just be\nbored while i'm working out heaven\nforbid\ndr k\nwe're trying not to use profanity but i\nthink this is an okay area\ndr k what am i supposed to do when i\ntake a\nwhat\nwhat am i supposed to do\nam i just supposed to sit there\nand just poop\nlike an animal\nis that what you expect from me\ni can't do that we can't give it up\nso pay attention to your reaction\nbecause that's what's driving the\naddiction\nyou all get that\nnext thing\ni shouldn't have to quit\ni want you all to tap into the\nmoralistic outrage of this statement\ni shouldn't have to give up my favorite\napps\nshouldn't according to who\nwhat are we talking about is this like\nthe 11th commandment\nif you live a good and holy life thou\nshalt not give up your favorite apps\nlike who determines this crap\ni shouldn't need to give up this\nhappiness\nthis joy this dopamine\nfrom this app\nit's not fair\nso what is this like is this like i want\nyou to really like tunnel down if you\nfeel this way\nis this like moralistic outrage do you\nfeel taken advantage of like where is\nthis thought coming from because there's\na lot of energy behind it\nso\nthis too is a huge statement that i hear\na lot of addicts make\nnot a huge\ni'm not a huge fan of the phrase addict\nbecause it defines a person with an\nillness\nright so in medicine we have a couple of\ndifferent ways of saying things a person\nwith schizophrenia versus schizophrenic\nperson with diabetes versus diabetic\nso when we like personify an illness\ninto a person you'll notice we we do\nthis for some illnesses and not others\nso we'll do it for addicts but we won't\ndo it for people with cancer\nthere's no noun that describes someone\nwho's cancerous\nright you all get that there's a word\nlike leper\nwhich we define someone by an illness\nbut there's no word for person with\ncancer at least that i'm\nfamiliar with\nmaybe i'm wrong\nright cancerous is an adjective that's\nmy point\nso\nshouldn't have to quit\nis sometimes the last bastion of an\naddiction\nbecause it's sort of like the addiction\nwill take a moralistic outrage and say\nthis is unfair to me screw it i'm not\ngonna play this game so be careful about\nthat\nright shouldn't have to quit okay it\nsays who\nwhat's wrong with quitting what's wrong\nwith giving up what do you what what\ndoes it cost you\nand now we get to number four\nwhich is never have patience\nnow this is where the neuroscience\nreally comes in if you all want to learn\na lot about this we do a bunch of stuff\naround neuroscience and motivation in\nour current in the upcoming guide but\nlet's talk about this\nthis is where we have the dreaded\ndopamine reward\nso this is what happens in your brain\nso when we look at technology\ntechnology activates parts of our brain\nit's how it works\njust activates parts of our brain that's\nwhy we like it\nnow these parts of our brain are\ndesigned to be activated right so if you\nlook at like the dopamine reward\ncircuitry\nlike when i do a good job and my boss\nsays great job\nthat's supposed to activate my dopamine\nreward circuitry i don't know if it\nactivates dopamine really but\nlet's just stick with the analogy\nthe problem with technology is that it's\njust activates that circuitry\njust in a way easier way\nright\nso this is why technology is so\naddictive it's because it's a shortcut\nto activating our brain with a very very\nlow barrier\nof investment\nso i want you all to think about\nso i enjoy white water rafting from time\nto time\nsometimes when you go white water\nrafting like you feel the sense of\ntriumph especially if you're about to\ncapsize\nand it's like you're rowing with all\nyour might your adrenaline is pumping\nyou don't capsize you're through the\nrapid and you're like\ncheering and it's like it feels amazing\nand alive\nand you can get that feeling from a\nvideo game\nit's not quite the same but it's\nreally close right so video games don't\nperfectly mimic life but they activate a\nlot of like if you're down right and\nthere's one minute left on the clock and\nyou kind of ride it you push it back and\nyou win in a last-minute victory\nlike i've seen these matches from places\nlike cs go and stuff like that where\nthere's like one dude left against four\npeople and he's out of ammo and all he's\ngot or she's got is a knife\nand they go knifing one person down the\nnext person down next person down and\nthen they're triumphant they've won this\ngrand finals with like a knife victory\nit's like oh my god it's so amazing and\neveryone's cheering and stuff like that\ni don't know if you guys have ever you\nknow been megan in league of legends or\ndota or whatever like mega creeped\nand then you're you know all of your\ninhibitors are destroyed and then like\nyou you make a comeback and you destroy\ntheir whatever whatever the throne is\nand all\nright like\nget\nand so technology gives us all this\nstuff just easier\nbecause it's such a pain in the ass to\ngo white water after you got to travel\nsomewhere\nyou got to pay something\nyou got a suit up you got to wake up\nearly in the morning\nit just costs so much\nhigher so why is it so easy\nto never have patience for the rest of\nthe world when you're addicted to the\ninternet it's because the internet gives\nit to you\nfaster\neasier\nnot quite as good but\nit's like the fast food for life is what\nthe internet is it's a fast food highly\nprocessed\neasily available it's good it's like the\nmcnugget\nof living life\nyou can go and have a romantic\nrelationship yourself\nor\nyou can have\nthe easier processed version of that by\nwatching a relationship show\nand oh my god isn't that so much better\nyou get all the joy\nof drama without being involved\noh my god\nso you never have the patience for life\nif you're addicted to the internet 100\nit's because your brain is like okay\nwe've got two options\nwe can just use the internet or we can\ngo out and be bored for a long time like\ni can socialize with humans but what if\ni don't enjoy that\nthen what am i gonna do i'm gonna be at\nthe party i'm gonna be scrolling on my\nphone\nthis is the other thing we take the\ninternet with us wherever we go\nit's with us always\nlike a safety blanket\nlike a stuffed animal\nalways there with that hidden dopamine\nwhenever you need it you're riding in\nthe elevator oh you poor thing\nyou're in the elevator for 45 seconds\ni got you take a bump yo pull out your\nphone\nnow with face id you don't even have to\nput in your passcode\nit's going to be so efficient it's not\ngoing to a 45 second elevator ride means\n44 seconds of opening stuff up\nat the urinal\non the potty\ni don't know if you guys have seen this\nbut\neven on dates\ni'm on a date someone goes and uses the\nbathroom out comes the phone\nso then people say okay i have no\npatience for anything of course not\nhow would you ever gain patience how\nwould you ever learn patience when\ninstant gratification\nis\nliterally a second away\nthis is what technology does to us\nif we're not careful\nso i believe that technology is\nadvancing at a rate that 30 40 50 years\nfrom now we're going to look back on\ntechnology advancement kind of like the\nway that we do for something like\nnicotine\nwhere we like didn't realize what it was\ndoing to us and we kind of like expanded\nit so much it infiltrated every aspect\nof our life\nand it got out of control now i don't\nthink technology is evil\nso i think that it's very useful\nmaybe in that way nicotine isn't really\na great example\nmaybe something like you know combustion\nis a better example where like we used\nit because it was awesome\nand helped us do so many things but came\nat a very very high price\nso if you're addicted to the internet\nit's hard\nwhat do you do about it\nfour things to keep in mind\nso the experience of people who are\naddicted on to the internet\nfirst of all find that they're very very\neasily distracted\nright and if you're easily distracted\nit's not so much that you're easier to\ndistract than you used to be although\nthat may be true as well we're not going\nto go into that\nbut the key thing is that the price of\ndistraction is now way higher than it\never used to be\nso 50 years ago when you're studying at\nthe library you get distracted you have\nnothing to do\nand eventually your mind goes back to\nstudying whereas now if you get\ndistracted it's so easy to open\nsomething up and then go down the rabbit\nhole for four hours and doomscroll\nthe distraction is actually the same the\ndifference is what happens after you get\ndistracted\nsecond thing to consider is that\noftentimes we're not willing or\nunable to quit is it an addiction can i\nnot control it in my brain or do i not\nwant to give it up\nand if you really want to get to the\nsource of that what you should do is\nask this question\nwhat would it be mean if i uninstalled\nthis app or youtube or whatever\nuninstalled this video game\nand like your mind may come up with all\nkinds of cognitive answers but that's\nnot actually what we want to focus on we\nwant to focus on the emotions\nif i tell you no more youtube ever\nwhat does it do to you how does your\nmind\nno\nthat's the source of the addiction\nyou all feel that like that's where the\naddiction comes from it's like\nyou know\nit's like a geothermal vent\nthat is venting out something deep down\nwithin you\nand you gotta go find it\nthing that sometimes happens is when\nwe're addicted to something\nwe get really upset because we shouldn't\nhave to give it up\ni don't want to give it up there must be\nmoderation there must be honesty that it\nprobably is in terms of internet usage\nhonestly\nso i'm not against moderation in fact\nthat's why we're a healthy gamer instead\nof no more gaming\nright we're about developing healthy\nhabits around technology which i think\nis an increasingly important skill\nbecause i don't think we can go back to\nbeing amish i don't think that's going\nto work\nmaybe i'm wrong by all means prove me\nwrong\nbut\nwe got to learn healthy technology\nhabits\nand a big part of that\nis we got to be careful because\nsomething that the addiction will use\nis telling us that moderation is\npossible\nhaving us hunt for moderation hunt for\nmoderation hunt for moderation and when\nwe hunt for moderation the addiction\ngets\nsatisfied so is it possible to use\ntechnology in a healthy way 100\nbut for you in this moment maybe not\nso take those worst defenders and\nhonestly uninstall them\nsee what happens\nlast thing to consider\nis that as we use more and more\ntechnology we don't have patience for\nirl and that actually causes even a\nworse problem because now what's\nhappening is\nirl stuff is getting harder and\ntechnology stuff is getting easier so we\nget shifted more and more towards\ntechnology and more and more towards\nthings like internet addiction\nand as our social skills get rusty\nas we you know don't quite take care of\nourselves as much because we're in the\ncompute in front of a computer screen\nall day long\nas our laundry doesn't get done and\nthings like that gets harder and harder\nto engage in the real world\nand so we don't have patience to do\nthings in the real world that's because\ntechnology like hits those centers of\nour brain\nthat\nnormally real life hits it hits it just\nso much easier\ndirtier though it's like a\nincomplete combustion it's like a dirty\npollutant\nsource of energy like it it gets us that\ndopamine hit but not in a healthy and\nnourishing way\nit feels really good in the moment when\nyou make a big comeback in a video game\nbut six years later you don't feel\nconfident in yourself as a human being\nbecause of that victory\nright that's the problem\nwith technology\nis that it activates just enough of our\nbrain\nto out compete real life\nwithout actually giving giving us the\nadvantages of real life and the more we\ngo down that the the less patience we\nhave for the real world\nvery challenging\nfortunately very common\nso if you all want more information on\nthis stuff especially things like\nbuilding technology habits and stuff\nlike that we've got a whole lecture\nabout the process of how to do that\nworksheets and things like that coming\nout in our guide i strongly also\nrecommend you check out some of our\nother things like we did dopamine detox\ntogether as\non discord a couple months ago\nso\nby all means like ask these questions\nexplore this stuff it's also not a bad\nidea if you really feel like you're\naddicted to get evaluated by an actual\nclinician\nyou know this is going to be one of\nthose places where can a coach help you\nbuild healthy technology habits\nundoubtedly\nbut if you're really feeling like your\nyour function is impaired like you're\nfailing out of class\nyou're not able to go to work things\nlike that if you're seeing a real\nfunctional impairment really you should\ngo see a therapist\nmake sense\nit's tough\nyou"
