    "transcript": "the the first step to kind of getting to\nthis point with your partner is kind of\nhaving like honestly a little more of a\nmeta conversation about it\nwhere you're not even really gonna talk\nabout the kids issue you're gonna talk\nabout hey what's the like meta when we\ntalk about kids hey uh what brings you\ninto coaching\num let me remember for a second\ni lost my job during the pandemic\num\nyou know\ni\nuh i'm engaged to be married\num\nand\ni'm not i'm not so sure about that\nanymore\num i can go into more detail if you want\ni think i just i just don't know\nyou know it felt like my life was going\npretty well but like now\ni was doing all the things that i'm\nsupposed to do but like now i'm just\nnot really sure about stuff\num\nand and so i've seen a lot of stuff uh\nyou know a lot of the the\nvideos on youtube and stuff like i found\nyou know the program through youtube\num\na lot of that stuff i think really\nhelped me and i kind of need help i saw\na therapist\num\nthey\ndiagnosed me with something and i got\nstarted on medication\nand i think that the medication is like\nhelping some but it's not like\ni don't know it's just not doing you\nknow it doesn't it doesn't change the\nworld\nright so it's like helping me cope some\nand things like that but like at the end\nof the day\nyou know\nour i don't know\ni i like i i recently we we bought a\nhouse my fiance and i\nand like we're in a part of the world\nwhere actually like the climate seems to\nbe changing quite a bit\nso our power bills are very very high\nthis year um i'm not sure if i actually\nlike want to live here but like we've\nwe've moved here now\num i'm not really sure like once again\nlike\ni was looking for you know things in my\nindustry but i'm not really kind of sure\nbecause i lost this job and people say\nit's kind of pandemic related but i\nhaven't really been able to find a new\none yet and like should i move should i\nnot move like i just don't know\nyou know i'm kind of like scared\nabout like\ni feel like i used to know\nlike things were kind of laid out right\nlike you do a and then you do b and then\nyou do c\nbut now i'm just not sure like i don't\nknow what the right answer is\nit sounds like there's kind of a lot of\nthings that\ngot tossed up in the air all at once\nyeah it certainly feels that way it just\nit's like one thing after another after\nanother felt like you know a house of\ncards coming tumbling down\nyeah\nuh before we get into any of this the\nfirst thing i actually want to say is\nlike\nthat's a lot man\nyeah absolutely\nyou doing okay\ni mean honestly not really\nright\ni mean\nyeah i mean would i be here if i was\ndoing okay\ni don't make assumptions but\nso\nyou say you're not doing okay\nwhat does that feel like to you\nnot good\nis there anything in particular that\ncomes up any emotions any feelings any\nideas\ni mean it's just like not knowing what's\ncoming next\nit's kind of that uncertainty factor\nyeah like i don't know if like did i\nmake a mistake buying this house\nam i in the wrong relationship like i'm\nkind of questioning that like should i\nmove to like stay in this industry or\nshould i try to make a career change is\nthis kind of thing where it's like okay\nnow that the pandemic is kind of\nwrapping up like i'll be able to find a\njob again like i just don't know\nyou know i i don't know what the right\nanswer is\nsure\nso\ni don't honestly i don't know that there\nis a right answer\nwith with all of these things in life\nlike we we make choices\nbut like no one can predict the future\nno one really knows what's going to\nhappen so you kind of just you do what\nyou can i was kind of hoping you could\ntell me the right answer oh i promise\ni'll never lie to you\nuh\nokay one thing one thing i do want to do\nis um\nreflect some of this back\nbecause\ni just wanted to give you the rundown of\nof all the things you just kind of\nrattled off\nso you said\nyou lost your job\nyou're engaged but part of that's\nfeeling really uncertain now\nyou saw a therapist and got diagnosed\nwith a thing\nbought a house and now you're not sure\nyou want to live there\nand\nclimate change is changing a lot of\nstuff about where you are\nand you're also a little bit unsure\nabout your career and prospects moving\nforward there\nyeah i mean when you say that back to me\nit it seems like i'm kind of [ __ ]\ni wouldn't say you're [ __ ] i'd say\nthat's a lot\nand one of the difficult things about\nwhen stuff like this happens in life is\nwe feel like we have to solve all these\nproblems right now today\nand\nthe legitimate answer is you can't you\ncan't solve it all at once\nthere's actually this great clip um i\nshare with a lot of my clients and\nout of out of game this is where i would\nnormally share a clip\nuh from dr k's stream where he talks\nabout this idea of don't go past three\nright you focus on one thing at a time\nand if you can fix that that's great or\nyou can focus on two or you can focus on\nthree but you can't go past three\nthere's too many things you don't have\nenough energy to actually handle all of\nthem\nand if we think about like you have\na mana pool or motivation or energy or\nhowever we want to like relate this\nthing\nif you can divide it between two or\nthree things you got a lot more resource\nto work with\nif you're dividing it between six or\nseven different things and all of them\nare uncertain\nit's gonna feel really overwhelming man\nyeah okay okay\nso let's assume we you shared that clip\nyeah um you you explain it beautifully\nby the way thank you before we go back\ninto character okay so you've shared the\nclip and okay so yeah i i don't know i\nmean it definitely does feel\noverwhelming like where do you think i\nshould start\nso\ni can't tell you where to start\ni think\nwhatever of these topics the ones that\nyou've mentioned the ones that i've\nrelayed back to you stands out to you as\nthe most important\nwhat resonates with you the most is a\ngreat place to just start thinking\nnot even taking actions yet just\nthinking\nwell i mean the thing that's like\nweighing me down the most is like do i\nactually get married or not\nbecause like that wedding is coming up\nit's\nfour months away\nso we're gonna get married around\nthanksgiving\nand\ni'm having second thoughts\nare your second thoughts specific to\nsomething or just kind of\ngeneralized\nwell i mean i i'm absolutely\nin a lot of ways i know that this is the\nperson for me like there's not anything\nin a sense wrong in our relationship but\num we had talked about having kids and i\nused to be on board with having kids\nbut honestly with everything that's\ngoing on like i i don't feel comfortable\nbringing children like into this world\nand so\ni know my partner really wants kids\num\ni want them to i just kind of feel like\nit's irresponsible and it's caused like\nwe've been kind of like\ni guess talking about it\nis what we call it but really it's an\nargument we've been arguing about it\nbecause my partner is trying to convince\nme that we should have kids and i just\ndon't think that's a good idea\nand so they're they're also sort of\nsaying like okay even if you don't want\nto do it now like we're not you know we\nweren't talking about having it having\nthem soon anyway but like they're\nyou know they're sort of saying like\nokay it's like if now isn't the right\ntime like that's okay like we can do it\nlater\nwhereas like i don't think they get it\nthat i'm not sure if i ever want to have\nkids\nand so\nwhat's sort of happening is they're kind\nof saying like it's okay it's okay like\nyou'll come around you'll come around\nbut like i i don't think they're really\ngetting it that\ni'm not sure that this is ever a good\nidea\nthis is a new feeling for you\nkinda yeah i mean because we talked\nabout it before you know but like now\nthat that things are kind of becoming\na little bit more real and it's like\nyou know like financially like we're not\nin the best place my partner's\nthankfully has had their job for a while\nlike you know they're stable and stuff\nlike that\num\nyou know i've been kind of struggling\nthere\nand like i know things will turn around\nbut you know\nthey just\nyou know but what if they don't\nscary question\nyeah\nyeah i i don't know i don't know what to\ndo you know what if they don't like\nwhat what am i supposed to do like\nyou know should i move should i not move\nlike\nyou know i i don't i don't know i don't\nknow what the right answer is\nso again um\ni'm not sure that there is a right\nanswer and i'm not gonna tell you like\ni'm never gonna get to the point where i\ntell you like oh you you need to split\nfrom your partner or you definitely need\nto marry your partner like we don't give\nadvice like that here\nwhat we can do is we can talk it out and\nmore explore\nlike where you are with it\nand what you would or wouldn't be\ncomfortable moving forward with\nyeah\ni was gonna say so in this case it\nsounds like there's a lot of those\nwhat-ifs not even specific to the\npartner i mean obviously that is that is\na big one what if partner what if about\nkids\nbut it kind of sounds like everything in\nyour life was like very recently called\ninto question\nyeah i mean i feel like honestly like i\nfeel like my life is kind of falling\napart\nand it used to be so together and like i\ndon't know what happened but just one\nthing after the next after the next\nafter the next\nit's really hard man\nthat's right\nall the chat\ni shouldn't look at it either but it's\njust too good\nall right so yeah that sounds really\nreally hard\nyeah so i mean what is that something\nyou can help me with\nyeah i think we can definitely help with\nthat\nso\nthe what-ifs are really really difficult\nbecause\nwhen we get into that kind of mindset\nour brain's natural mechanism is to look\nfor threats\nright it's kind of where like our lizard\nmonkey brain takes over and it's like\nwhat's going to hurt me\na way i usually describe this to people\nis like our brains are designed to look\nfor what's not there it's not designed\nto look for what we have\nif you have all the food in the world\nyour brain doesn't think about food your\nbrain thinks where's the fresh water\nright that's that's how we're designed\nso\nnow we have to kind of figure out\nwith within what's going on with you\nyou're looking around and you're seeing\nall of these potential threats\nand\nthere are things that are in your life\nthat are not too bad but there are also\nthings that are potential threats in the\nfuture and it's really hard to look at\nanything else when you see those things\nthat could potentially hurt you\nwell i mean\nyeah i mean like but i mean the threats\nare real right like climate change is\nreal\nyeah\nyou know\nlike\nyou know i've been collecting\nunemployment for like eight months\nso i i'm kind of confused like\nare you are you saying that i shouldn't\nbe worried about that or\nin this case it's not that\nlike you shouldn't be worried about it\nit's more of a question of\nlike what's the problem\nright now that you can actually interact\nwith\nwell i mean right now the problem i need\nto interact with i need to figure out if\ni'm going to call off this wedding or\nnot\nyeah\nso climate change exists climate change\nis real climate change is not a thing\nthat you can solve or interact with\ntoday\nso it's not that i'm saying like don't\nlike think about it or don't worry about\nit but if we're going to like look at\nthings to focus on and work on\nwe want to deal with what's here and now\nwhich in this case is your relationship\nand your partner your wedding is all\nthose ideas\ni mean not technically kids but the\ndecision about whether or not you want\nto have kids\nbut climate change is much more of a\ndistant issue that you can worry about\neventually or you can like\ngo and be an advocate for if that's\nsomething you're really passionate about\nbut how do i how do i decide whether\nlike\ni should delay the wedding or like how\ndo i what do i do about that\nsure\nso i think with things like this\ncommunication is going to be a huge deal\nand what sounds like is happening\nbetween you and your partner obviously\ni've never been there i've never seen\nthe two of you talk to each other but\nwhat sounds like it's happening is\nyou're kind of on opposite sides of this\nissue\nyeah and then when you meet to talk\nabout it you don't really talk about\nwhere the other person is you just talk\nabout where you are\ni don't quite follow you can you explain\nthat a little bit sure so when you get\nto this conversation with your partner\nyou're in the place of\ni'm not sure i want to bring kids in\nthis world i don't know about this all\nthose kinds of things and your partner's\nin the position of oh you're going to\ncome around you still want kids it's\nfine\nwell yeah i mean kind of\nso\na lot of times what's missing in\nconversations like this is curiosity\nso being curious about the other person\nand having the other person being\ncurious about you\nis what's going to help that\nconversation move forward instead of\nturning into an argument\nbut i can't make her curious\nno you can't\nso you can talk up to your partner about\nhey when we have these conversations\nit's really hard for me because\nof whatever the thing that happens is\nthat sounds good but i'm not quite sure\nhow to do that\nokay\ncan you can you tell me what you mean by\nthat a little bit sure so\nthe the first step to kind of getting to\nthis point with your partner is kind of\nhaving like honestly a little more of a\nmeta conversation about it\nwhere you're not even really going to\ntalk about the kids issue you're going\nto talk about hey what's the like meta\nwhen we talk about kids\nright this is the pattern i've seen\nwhere like we don't really talk about it\nit actually turns into an argument\nand then\ni don't want to assume things about you\nbecause we just met but\nsaying something like hey when you tell\nme\nthat oh i will want kids in the future\nor whatever that might make me feel bad\nor invalidated or upset or ignored or\nwhatever the thing is right so it's up\nto you to decide and kind of think about\nhow you feel when your partner says\nthose things\nbut\nbefore you have the conversation about\nkids you want to kind of have the meta\nconversation about how are we\ncommunicating\nokay\nso kind of just point out to her that\nyou know we're not communicating\nwell\nyeah\nand and maybe try to figure out like can\nyou help me like\nalmost with some like how do you how do\nyou say that i mean when you're\nexplaining it to me it makes sense\nbut i feel like if i try to say that\nlike\nshe's gonna feel like\ni'm accusing her of not being a good\ncommunicator\num\nyou know like sometimes i feel like that\ncould kind of spiral out of control\npretty easily\nlike\nso do you want to practice by talking to\nme like i'm her\ni mean i don't even know what to say\nthat sounds like a good idea but like i\ni wouldn't even know what where to start\nokay\nso you can start with saying hey i want\nto have a conversation about like our\ncommunication or or whatever the\nway you want to phrase it is\nand just seeing what the response is\nthere\nokay\nokay so do you want to try that one on\nor do you want me to keep going uh yeah\nlet's try that so like hey i i want to\nhave a conversation about how we're\ncommunicating\nokay yeah we can talk after dinner\nbut then what do i say okay so after\ndinner comes around\nand so you wanted to talk about our\ncommunication like\nwhat's going on\ni feel like we're not\nseeing eye to eye about\nthis whole kids issue\nyeah i mean\nwe were in the same place and now we're\nnot but you'll come around\nwell i mean but i i don't\ni don't know that i want to come around\nokay so this i'm we're going to back out\nof the the meta conversation\nso when the conversation goes this way\nyou really want to state hey this is\nwhat i want to talk about today not the\nkid thing\noh i see what you mean\nright so don't say you're gonna have to\nsteer the ship a little okay\nokay so like don't focus on the\ncommunication not get into the kid thing\nexactly\nlet's pause\nsure okay fantastic job\nuh sidekick how was that for you\nit was good i\nhonestly i really wanted to get into\nsome other stuff but then we kind of\njust like headed down the partner path\nand like that's where we are what did\nyou want to get into\nso i really wanted to get more into like\nthe the overall like hey your life is in\nupheaval so you're gonna question\neverything idea\nokay\num which might be related to the kids\nthing it might not obviously i don't\nknow the client well enough yet\num and then the other thing especially\nwith things like um\nmental health's obviously a big one\nwhere\nif i'm being honest with myself i\nintentionally avoided talking about\ncontrol because we kind of did it with\nthe last yeah good role play i'm glad um\nbut like control is a big part of this\ntoo\nand understanding like\nwhen that sense of control gets like\nthrown off especially when it's like hey\nyou have control of nothing in life not\nyour marriage not your house not the\nclimate not even your mental health\nit's a lot man so like i really would\nhave loved to go into control again\num\nshocking\nsidekick are you saying that\nsometimes there are common themes\nbetween clients\nextremely common so like should\nstatements or circles of control or\nwhichever other iteration i get into\ni've probably given to 80 of my clients\num cool so what was that have you worked\nwith clients like this before whose life\nfeels like they're kind of you know it's\nkind of falling apart\nyeah um\nand usually it kind of goes like this\nactually where\nwe'll start with one small thing that\nthey're willing to like start taking\nactions on again\nand we kind of use that as an example\nlike it doesn't actually matter if that\nconversation goes well or not if they\nhave it with their spouse or not what\nmatters is we start talking about\nwhat actions can't you take that's and\nagain it's more of a reframing getting\nthat focus back on like what can you do\nas opposed to hey everything sucks and\nyou can't do anything about it that's\nthat's beautifully said so i just want\nto highlight this so for people who are\nlistening we have this really\ninteresting pattern in coaching where\nclients will come in and they'll be like\ni'm stuck i'm stuck i'm stuck and then\nsuddenly like week six rolls around week\nseven rolls around and they start doing\nstuff\nand\nwhat tends to happen is i think kind of\nlike sidekick is doing\nyou know if you listen to this client\nthey're kind of coming in and saying i\ndon't know what to do because things are\nso uncertain so by focusing on one thing\nand almost like directing their\nattention to something very very minut\nokay let's go into the specifics of\nhaving a conversation and then let's say\ni do that role play\ni mean let's say we role play the\nconversation i go and i have the\nconversation\nthe subtle thing that you're actually\ndoing there which i think is really\nimportant is that\neven if the conversation goes well or\ndoesn't go well what you've actually\nshowed me and demonstrated\nis that i can still do something about\nit\nso like it almost shifts the attention\nfrom okay i've got these 15 different\nthings that i don't even know where to\nstart i don't know what the right answer\nis and you did this really really well\nwhere you didn't like\ntell me like okay if you say this thing\nit'll fix everything\nand yeah right but you still got me\nthinking about okay like i'm actually\ngonna do this tonight\nwith my partner and we're gonna have a\nconversation about it and so even though\ni may think in that moment that okay\nthis may not work it's not about it not\nworking it's about getting the client to\nstart acting\nand if the client keeps acting keeps\ntrying keeps having those conversations\nlike suddenly they've had one\nconversation that'll turn into two\nconversations i'm sure you'll do that\naround work related stuff you'll do that\naround climate-related stuff whatever\nright and so it's it's about getting the\nclient to start moving forward maybe\nhaving a conversation with their\nprovider about you know if they're\nunsatisfied with treatment\none thing one of the things\ni talk about uh with almost all my\nclients in like session one or two when\nwe start doing goals\nis\ni'm always going to ask you how it went\nand i don't care if it failed miserably\nor if you totally forgot or if you\nthought about it and then didn't want to\ndo it i'm always going to ask you how it\nwent and that's not coming from a place\nof judgment\nit's because like if you got it done\ngreat let's talk about it if it failed\nmiserably great let's talk about it if\nit didn't happen great let's talk about\nwhat got in the way\nso one always gives you a place to go\nand and yeah so tell me a little bit\nabout\nthe advantage of\na great because that's kind of foreign\nright like even if it went miserable\nlike your aunt your response as a coach\nis the same great what you do afterward\nis different\nso what does that do for the client when\nif they succeeded great if they didn't\ndo it at all great and if they failed\nmiserably great what does that do for\nyour clients\nso i think what it does is it removes a\nlot of that expectation right kind of\ngoing back to what we talked about with\nthe first client where there's like oh\nwe're gonna make a goal and if you don't\ndo it you're a bad client\nright or if you don't do it then it\nmeans you're not actually trying on your\nmental health and now you're like\nashamed of yourself or think like why am\ni even coming to coaching or\nit leads to a lot of negative places so\none of the things i try to do is like be\nthat positive non-judgmental force in\ntheir life\nlike hey it doesn't matter if you show\nup like\nfive minutes late and you're super\nhectic and you're very apologetic like\nit's okay i'm not judging you\nif you show up and you're like hey i\ndidn't do the goal i totally forgot\nabout it it just slid my mind i'm not\ngonna be like damn this dude doesn't\nactually care about coaching i'm gonna\nbe like okay cool like do you want to\ntry that goal again this week or do you\nwant to move on to something else\nall right we'll ask about like well what\ngot in the way did you get super busy\nbut like you still want to do this goal\nor are you just not feeling this goal\nand like let's talk about how we can do\nit differently\nyou"
