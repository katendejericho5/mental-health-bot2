    "transcript": "so i i like this because you know i\nthink this client really exemplifies\nlike what we see what we try to\naccomplish how we help and also that\nsometimes we can't do it all and you\nneed to see a therapist sometimes the\nmost efficient way to get help uh to to\nimprove is actually to just get help and\ni just wanted to share with you all i\nknow there's been a lot of negative\nvideo on the subreddit recently i mean i\nthink it's good i think it's healthy\nbut\num just wanted to share this with you\nall so coaching changed my life\nhey all i see a lot of people venting in\na lot of posts which is fine and i get\nit and at one point i did the same but\nthen anxiety got the better of me and i\ndeleted it however i wanted to give a\nshout out to the healthy gamer coaching\nprogram and hopefully you guys a bit of\nhope for the future\na bit about me i was a multi-college\ndropout desperately trying to find\nsolutions\nfor what seemed to be a never-ending\ncycle of mental problems\nlike many of you i started watching dr k\nvideos and a lot of the problems he\ndiscussed really resonated with me and\nby watching the online coaching videos\nit made me feel better that other people\nshared my problems\ni figured heck if i could pay for weed\nmonthly then i could pay for the\ncoaching program i was too scared to\ncommit myself to an expensive therapist\nbecause a was unsure if they would be a\ngood fit and b i knew i had a lot of\ntalking to do\nso i signed up for the coaching program\nand lo and behold i did it bi-weekly for\nabout a year i did it for so long i\nparticipated in in one of their\nlong-term coaching client surveys i can\ngive you a brief idea of what it\nentailed for me\nlet me preface it by saying it is\ndefinitely not therapy what it was for\nme was a safe and unbiased place i could\njust [ __ ] vent for 50 minutes\nwhether it was old problems or new i\ncould vent about life and the questions\nmy coach asked helped me dig deeper\nabout life and myself\nthis eventually after one year led me to\nrealize i needed actual professional\ntherapy\ni started professional therapy and\ninitially went two weeks and now i go\nabout every eight this all happened in a\nlittle under two years\ntldr i went from being addicted to video\ngames from from 8 to 18 years old lost\nin a spiral of substance abuse weed nick\naddie and could not find myself and was\nbeginning to isolate from friends now i\nmove states and am dealing with and\nprocessing my emotions more clearly no\nlonger i'm addicted to weed nick or\nadderall i dropped all other medications\nas well and i'm only on lexapro i'm\ngetting social life back and regularly\nhang out with groups of friends now i\nalso now regularly attend school and\nwork a full-time job which i was doing\nneither of these things a year ago\njust wanted to quickly write this up was\nmeaning\nto after coaching ended don't really\nfollow the community but still see some\nposts\nshout out to dr k shout out to healthy\ngamer and as much as i wish i could name\ngive a name i figure it's best not to\nshout out to my coach that dealt me with\nrantings during all those sessions\nthere is hope y'all will be there is\nhope you all will be okay much love\ni wanted to share that because i think\nthe person really grasps a lot of what\npeople don't understand\nabout coaching the first thing is that\nit's not therapy and this person is like\nit helped me a lot by the way it's not\ntherapy\nwe also\nwant to put together a study about\nwhat percentage of coaching clients wind\nup in therapy so actually one of the\noutcomes that we really look at or not\nlook at but we want to look at is\nhelping people get into mental health\ntreatment because there's sometimes\nbarriers and stigma and things like that\nso coaching and therapy are like two\ndifferent things and i think this person\nis a prime example of\nyou know\nhow to do both\nthat there are some things that you\nactually need a therapist for but some\nof these things like\nbuilding good habits getting back into\nschool\ngetting a job socializing\nright and this person says they were\nventing but i think they were doing a\nlot more than that right i'm pretty sure\nif we ask this person's coach\nthey would say that they're doing a lot\nmore than venting they're really\nstarting to understand what holds them\nback\nwhat is it within me that perpetuates\nthe cycle\nthat's how we figure out how to break\nout of it\nso i love this post because it touched\non a lot of different things you know so\npeople do have\na lot of concerns about the cost of\ntherapy because therapy is expensive and\npart of what we try to do is make our\ncoaching affordable\npart of the other reason is because\nsometimes people\nyou know will complain about the price\nbut they'll like this person\nwill buy weed every week\nright some people really can't afford it\nbut i think a lot of people is we've\nseen this as well\na lot of people can't afford it they\njust choose not to\nso i i like this because you know i\nthink this client really exemplifies\nlike what we see what we try to\naccomplish how we help and also that\nsometimes we can't do it all and you\nneed to see a therapist\nand it's okay to need both\nfor what it's worth i think this\nperson's\nuh progress is probably\nin the minority like i don't know many\npeople who have\ndone as much as this person does after\nlike you know a year of coaching and\ntherapy like that's a lot they really\nput their life together which is exactly\nwhy we're here this is why we started\nthe program it's to do this and also\nyour mileage may vary i think this\nperson has really put i mean this is\nwhere it's important to understand that\nif you come into coaching\nit's not going to fix you\nit's going to help you fix yourself\nand i think what this person is leaving\nout is all the work they put in\nbecause if you just come to coaching and\nyou're like\ncoach me to success and sobriety\ngo\ni don't want to give up weed i don't\nwant to do this i don't want to do this\ni'm not going to move i'm not going to\ndo anything\nfix me\nthat doesn't work\nthe key thing though is that a lot of us\nhave struggles\nand we don't know how to start we don't\nknow how to untangle things we don't\nknow how to get unstuck\nand coaching can help with that\nso if you all want to if you sign up for\ncoaching and you want to end up like\nthis person let me make it very clear\nthat if you want to end up like this\nperson you're going to have to put in\nthe work will the coach help you 100\nbut they can't do this for you they can\nhelp you do it for yourself\nand by the way one of the primary goals\nof our coaching program is for people to\nno longer need it\nit's to end it equip you with the skills\nhelp you put together your life and it's\nreally about self understanding and\ndeveloping your own skill set it's not\nabout\ndeveloping dependency\nsometimes though it takes a while right\nit could take a year\nfor those of you all but i just want you\nto think about that because like there\nare people in our community out there\nthat are going to be smoking weed all\nthe time multiple time college dropout\nno job no friends like struggling and\nthey think like oh my god\ni can never put my life together this\nperson did it in about two years\nsounds about right if you all have heard\nme talk about this before you know i'll\nsay like 6 to 18 months to really get\nstarted you're going to start to see\nprogress in two to three months\nlike all of our outcome studies what we\npresented at the american psychiatric\nassociation for example i think was an 8\nor 12 week outcome study so we started\nto see some changes but it really takes\ni mean putting together your life takes\nyears\nyou can get started and make good\nprogress and start it starts to get a\nlot easier and feels a lot better pretty\nquickly\nyou"
