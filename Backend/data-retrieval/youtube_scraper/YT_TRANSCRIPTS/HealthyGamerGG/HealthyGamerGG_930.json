    "transcript": "if you look at victims of trauma they\nhave self-image issues this is conserved\nwithin Humanity that if you take a child\nand you're emotionally abusive to them\nfor years and years and years they will\nadapt to that way of thinking and one of\nthe survival mechanisms that they adopt\nis actually that they start to think\nlowly of themselves if I don't deserve\nlove in the first place\nit doesn't hurt to not get love so what\nwe've learned at HG is missing one huge\ncomponent\nsince the start of HD we've steered\nclear of assertiveness and dominance\nI know this is a touchy subject but I\nhonestly believe it must be addressed\nand more importantly taught\nDr K has taught us about the ahamgar the\nego and how to notice when it activates\nthe important takeaway here is that you\nshould be in control of your ego and not\nthe other way around but I also see a\nhuge issue here\nI believe that in our community\nincluding me the majority of people have\nself-image issues\nso in any scenario of conflict of\ninterest our intellect is going to\nrationalize that we should go we should\nplace our needs in second place so we\ncan deal with our ego responses\nI don't know exactly what that means but\nthis will lead to overly agreeableness\nwhich is going to create a lot of\nproblems in interpersonal relationships\nbecause your bad self-image is going to\nmake it impossible to make a strong case\nfor yourself and stand your ground as\nyou covertly feel that you don't deserve\nit slash have any chance\nthus thus far\nDr K has talked about the parent-child\nrelationship and also the worker\nworkspace relationship but what about\nthe relationship between you and your\npeers especially in group settings\nI see a huge lack of Education here\nalso I believe that noticing your ego\nand controlling it is important yet\nlearning how to build a healthy ego\nfirst should be the first goal\nanalogous to this is the relationship\nbetween worldly and spiritual success I\nthink Dr K has talked about this in one\nof his streams where he explained that\ntrying for Spiritual success can be\nescapism when you're basically fleeing\nfrom worldly successes\nin the same way I believe that\ncontrolling the ego while you've never\nhad a good healthy and strong ego that\nis not keeping you down is escapism\nI would really love to hear Dr K's\nopinion on this and maybe he has some\ngood advice on how to be more assertive\nand dominant as a tool to manage your\nway through life\ncontrolling the ego is all well but you\nwill face moments in your life where you\nhave to make a stand for yourself\notherwise you will turn into a pushover\num\nokay just my quick thoughts I think\nthere's more to say to this but you get\nthe point I hope\nso I think this is a a really important\npost for a couple of reasons\nthe first is that it's pointing out a\npotential deficiency in what we've\ncovered so far so I think that's really\nimportant\nthe second is that\nand we don't really ever talk about how\nto build a healthy ego\nwe sort of do but I'm realizing now\nthere have been absolutely deficiencies\nin what I've taught the other thing\nthat's really important here is that\nthis person seems to have done a lot of\ntheir homework has been a part of the\ncommunity for a long time has understood\na lot of these issues\nso this person is kind of saying is that\nokay noticing and controlling the ego so\nif I have an identity\nthat has a low self-image and if I think\nof myself as a bad person\ncontrolling myself image of being bad is\na piece of the puzzle absolutely\nbut we haven't really talked about how\ndo I build a healthy ego to begin with\nright\nlike it's one thing to be able to\ncontrol a negative self-image but the\nCrux of what I'm hearing this person say\nis how do we create a healthy ego\nso today what we're going to talk about\nis how to make a healthy ego\nso let's start\nby understanding\nwhat is the point of ego because\noftentimes when we talk about ego we\ntalk about it in a negative light right\nso like oh your ego you have all these\nnegative self-image issues and the ego\nis bad and we need to get control of our\nego\nso the first thing to understand is that\nthe ego is neither good nor bad it is a\ntool of the Mind\nso the three major pillars of Mind are\ngoing to be emotions\nare Manas\nor ego or the sense of self or identity\nand our buddhi or our intellect\nthese three things relate to each other\nokay they interact with each other\nnow the thing is are any of these things\ngood or bad like neither what makes them\ngood or bad is depending on how out of\ncontrol they are\nso let's take emotions for example are\nemotions good or are they bad well it\ndepends\nso if my emotions rule my life\nthen that's a problem\nright if I can't control my emotions\nfeeling emotions isn't necessarily bad\nfeeling them too intensely being\ncontrolled by them\nlike if I'm so anxious\nthat I can't go to a party and then I\nlet that anxiety control my life then\nthat's a problem\ne goes the same way\nso the reason that we sort of focus a\nlot on ego is because when the ego gets\nout of our control it starts controlling\nus and controlling our life and as the\nperson sort of mentioned a lot of people\nin our community may have self-image\nissues self-esteem issues ETC right this\nisn't because we're a weak Community or\nanything like that that's because\nthe way that technology is especially\nshaping us right so we're like sort of\ndoing a lot of ego inflating stuff\nlike on social media I get likes I get I\ndon't get as many likes as this person\nso the more that we compare ourselves to\nother people\nthe worse our ego gets\nso we sort of talk about controlling the\nego because for a lot of people it\ncauses problems\nand the third part of our mind is the\nintellect which that too if it gets out\nof control will be really problematic\nfor us\nso uh not really a direct example but an\ninteresting example is we'll have people\nwho are hyper intellectual\nand their mind is so logical but then\nthey still like run into trouble\nbecause the truth is you can logically\ncome up with something but it's not\ngoing to change your behavior right I\nlogically know I should never eat\nanother hot dog for the rest of my life\neasy\nI should eat broccoli and cabbage every\nday I should have brown rice instead of\nwhite rice I should never eat another\ncookie never have another soda never\ndrink alcohol never smoke a cigarette\nnever use marijuana I know exactly what\nI should do I should exercise every day\nI should uninstall all the video games\noff my phone I should I mean sorry on my\ncomputer I should uninstall all the\nsocial media off of you know I know what\nI should do logically it's easy\nI figured everything out because I'm so\nsmart\nbut that doesn't fix our life\nso the key thing to understand about all\nthe parts of the Mind\nis that they're good they're healthy\nthey're there for a reason they're also\nconserved across every human human mind\nright so like there's a reason that\nwe've evolved to have these so let's\nstart by understanding what's the point\nof ego\nwhy do we even have this thing if it's\nout of whack so much\nso ego is essentially a tool of\nefficiency\nso in order to navigate the world\nour mind needs an ego\nso I'll give you all just a simple\nexample\nso when I go\neat at a restaurant let's say with a\ngroup of my work colleagues\nwhere do I sit\nwho orders\nwho pays the bill\nall of that has to do based on ego or\nidentity who's the Boss\nright so like because there's a social\nhierarchy amongst human beings which we\nhave social hierarchies right we know\nthis\nthe way that we navigate social\nhierarchies is via ego so where do I fit\ninto the pecking order\nthat's all like that's what ego allows\nus to do imagine how how on Earth are we\nsupposed to do stuff if we don't have\nany sense of identity or social\nhierarchy\nlike if if I'm you know married to\nsomeone\nthat's a part of my identity\nand that helps me navigate a lot of\ndifferent things\nlike what's okay for me to do and what's\nnot okay for me to do what's okay for my\npartner to do and what's not okay for my\npartner to do\nso Identity or ego helps us navigate\nsocial relationships\nwhich is a big part of why comparison is\na huge part of ego so I can't compare\nmyself to other people unless I have an\nidentity does that make sense\nI can't be taller\nor shorter than someone else unless I\nhave a height and assigning a height to\nmy identity\nis what allows me to make the comparison\nthe converse is also true where the more\ncomparisons I make the more my ego gets\nout of control or grows\nor strengthens let's say not necessarily\nin a healthy way\ndoes that make sense\nso for example in medical school or in\nresidency like when I'm an attending\nphysician so I used to be a medical\nstudent\nabove the medical student is an intern\nabove the intern is the resident above\nthe resident is the fellow and above the\nfellow is the attending\nand I've basically been through most of\nthose didn't do Fellowship\nright so there's like a hierarchy and\nwho's in charge who's responsible when\nsomeone speaks does everyone else quiet\ndown\nand then things get confusing in the\nhospital setting because there's also\nthe nursing staff\nand other auxiliary staff\nso then there's like the nurse who's\ntaking care of the patient\nand then there's the charge nurse who\nthe nurse reports to\nand then there's the med tech the\nmedical Tech who's kind of like reports\nto the nurse\nbut then like things get sticky if you\nall have been in a hospital situation\nwhen it's like\nand the doctor's kind of at the top of\nthe team right but then like what's the\nrelationship between resident and charge\nnurse a resident and nurse or fellow and\ncharge nurse that's when things get\nsuper confusing\nwhat's the relationship between medical\nstudent and med tech\ncan the medical student give the med\ntech orders can the Medtech give medical\nstudents orders\nso the reason like the way that we\nnavigate all these complex relationships\nare ego\nand in a medical setting\nimproper ego is a hundred percent gonna\ncause all kinds of problems in that\nhospital setting and boy have I seen it\nit's incredibly common because people\ndon't know how to manage their egos in\nhospital\nand it's not just like doctors that\ndon't know how to manage their egos or\nnurses that don't know how to manage it\nanyone can have an ego medical student\ncan absolutely have an ego even though\nthey're at the absolute bottom of the\ntotem pole\nso we'll use phrases like needs to learn\nin their place\nand this is where like even as an\nattending\nit's important for me to check my ego\nand listen to the medical student\nbecause here's the really important\nthing that you understand isn't\nattending once you hopefully get this\nwho actually knows the patient the best\nas an attending I'm responsible for 30\npatients\nI've got two residents on my team\noh one resident let's say one resident\non my team and two interns on my team\nresident is also sort of responsible for\nall 30 personally manages 10 and each of\nthe interns get 10 each medical student\nresponsible for three\nnursing staff each nurse has let's say\nsix patients\nwho knows the patient the best on the\nteam\nthe nurse\nsometimes the medical student\nso I would be an idiot\nif when a nurse comes to me and says hey\nI think you should consider doing this\nwith a patient if I don't listen to them\nI don't necessarily have to do it right\nso I I have more training right so they\ncan say hey I really think you should\nconsider this for this patient there may\nbe other reasons to not do that thing\nbut if I let my ego get in the way like\nit's I should acknowledge that I have\nmore training I may have more experience\nand ultimately it's my responsibility\nright so I'm the one who's going to get\nsued\nif something goes bad\nbut it would be like absolutely idiotic\nfor me to like not listen to what the\nnurse says\nand even in the case of medical students\nit's like okay if you like because the\nmedical student is going to supposed to\nread and sometimes you have good medical\nstudents who read all kinds of stuff\nabout their patients\nso why do we have ego to navigate these\nsocial relationships is a big part of it\nfiguring out things like pecking order\nand hierarchy and stuff like that\nthere's more to Ego but that's just the\nsimplest example of why we have it\nso then the question becomes okay how do\nwe build a healthy one\nso the first thing that I kind of want\nto point out\nis that the function of the ego\nis to protect the mind\nso generally speaking the ego activates\nwhen we are in a negative emotional\nstate\nso it tries to protect us our mind is\nlike oh my God we're feeling bad\nand the ego is like let me help you with\nthat I will help us feel better\nby putting other people down or pumping\nmyself up because that's what the ego\ndoes usually we'll get to a couple of\nnuances\nso this person was mean to us let's talk\ncrap about their behind their back and\ntell everyone how they're such a mean\nperson and the more that we throw shade\non that person\nthe less it hurts us that this person\nsaid something mean about us\nby devaluing our critic\nwe can feel better about ourselves\nright so you can there are different\nways you can devalue the criticism\nthat's different\nfrom devaluing the critic\nthat's what the Mind does or it tells us\noh like they're not all that like so the\nclassic example is\nperson a asks person B out person B says\nno person a feels rejected and starts\nsaying stuff like oh\nI wasn't that into them\nI dodged a bullet they start telling\nthemselves all kinds of things to help\nthem feel better Eve to get rid of the\nrejection right because the more you\nconvince yourself that you dodged a\nbullet the less it hurts to then you're\nnot rejected right you dodged it was a\nwin actually they turned you down wow\nlook at how lucky I was\ncopium\nwell said\nso the ego is the master of copia\nthe interesting thing is that even low\nself-image is a strong ego it's a big\nego and you may say wait wait how does\nthat work I thought ego was like\ndevaluing other people so remember the\ngoal of the ego is to protect you from\nnegative emotions\nso how does having a low self-image\nprotect you from negative emotions\ndon't bother applying for the promotion\nbecause you're not going to get it\nboom safe\nno rejection you can't be passed over if\nyou don't apply\ndon't ask that person out there's no way\nthey'll say yes\nthere's no way they'd go out with you no\nrejection\neasy\nso this is the most devastating thing\nand we understand this right so like if\nyou look at victims of trauma they have\nself-image issues\nthis is conserved within Humanity\nthat if you take a child and you're\nemotionally abusive to them for years\nand years and years they will adapt to\nthat way of thinking and one of the\nsurvival mechanisms that they adapt\nadopt\nis actually that they start to think\nlowly of themselves\nbecause\nif I don't deserve love in the first\nplace\nit doesn't hurt to not get love\nit's such a devastating\nbut effective way to protect yourself\nfrom being unloved\nit's like the last ditch effort\nbecause if I deserve love and I'm abused\nby my parent it hurts so much if I\ndeserve something else but if I didn't\ndeserve it in the first place like\nthat's easier to manage there's the pain\nof the actual abuse but it's not like I\ndeserved it anyway\nin fact it's just\nit's just it's the way the world is\nsupposed to work so I can even get some\ndegree of Peace over that\nand what you see with people who have\nself-image issues is if they people\nstart treating them well they get very\nconfused\nbecause their identity is like wait I\ndon't deserve this positive treatment\nI'm confused\nwhere's the trick\nwhen is it going to stop\nwhat are you what's your game here\nwhat's your angle you're treating me\nwell like what are you what are you\ntrying to get\nit's all based on what you deserve the\nidentity of Who You Are\nand so we can have big egos that are in\na positive direction as well where we\nsort of get more traditional narcissism\nwhich by the way Recent research has\nbasically shown is also tied to\ninsecurity which we've kind of known for\na while right\nso at the end of the day there's always\ninsecurity at the bottom of ego\nso this is where you start to get\narrogant\nif you've got a big ego I know the best\nand then if I'm the smartest person in\nthe room and I know best what happens\nwhen someone else on my team if I'm the\nattending and I'm the boss and my\nresident comes in with a research paper\nthat\nhas demonstrates that the plan that I\nhave for the patient isn't the best plan\nfor the patient and actually there's a\nnew study that shows that we should do\nsomething else instead and I'm an\negotistical attending how do I respond\nto that\nI know best\nwho is this pipsqueak bringing this\nrandom paper\ndoes this idiot understand that one\npaper does not make clinical care\nthat's sort of true\nright you can't necessarily base\nclinical care based on a single paper\nit's not that simple\nbut my ego can't handle that someone\nelse knows more than I do so I shut them\ndown and then that hurts the patient\nbecause we should consider it right\nso this is big ego in small League I\nmean sorry sort of a negative\nself-imaging ego and a positive\nself-image ego but if the ego is Big\nthat's still going to be a problem in\neither way\nyou can be arrogant or insecure same\nproblem it's Allah at least according to\nthe Eastern perspective and I think the\nmore that we learn in the west the\ncloser we're getting to the Eastern\nperspective by the way\nand the other thing that's kind of\ninteresting about Eastern versus Western\npsychology is the third wave of\npsychotherapy so the first wave of\npsychotherapy was like psychoanalysis\nand psychodynamics second way was\ncognitive behavioral therapy which was\nmuch more behavioristic much more\nmanualized protocolized scientific\nthe third wave of psychotherapy is like\nPsychotherapy plus mindfulness\nand what we've discovered as a field is\nwhen we start incorporating these\nEastern ideas of the Mind into our\ntreatment protocols things actually work\nreally well\nso I think Western psychology is quickly\nlearning the value of Eastern psychology\nthe interesting thing is that they don't\neven think about it that way they just\nthink about it as mindfulness there's a\nton that's still left to learn\nso if you want to build a healthy ego\nthere are five things that you can do\nthe first is to recognize that\ncomparison feeds the ego\nso the more you compare\nthe less healthy your ego will become\nand this is important to understand\nthinking of myself as better than other\npeople or worse than other people is\nboth of those are going to lead to\nunhealthy ego\nright because one's going to make me\narrogant we don't want to be arrogant\none is going to make me have low\nself-esteem I don't want to have low\nself-esteem\nso try to limit your comparison as much\nas possible\nand this is where the person who wrote\nthis post I think missed one really\ncrucial thing\nwhich it I mean the reason I missed it\nis because I've never articulated it\nthis way so they don't actually miss it\nit's my fault\nbut\nthe key thing is that\nwhen we talk about noticing and\ncontrolling is important yet learning\nhow to build a healthy ego should be the\nfirst goal the way that you build a\nhealthy ego is by noticing the ego\nthis is actually one of the key\ncomponents\nnoticing the ego is actually a key step\nto building a healthy ego\nand how does that work\nit's because as you notice\noh look I'm comparing myself to this\nperson again\nActually I don't even know why it's fair\nI'm comparing myself to\nlet's say artesi in terms of DOTA skill\nprofessional player for those of you\ndon't play donut\nI'm comparing myself to doublelift\nright so I'm comparing myself to xqc\nor I'm comparing myself to whoever\nany kind of comparison is going to\nresult in the growing your ego so\nnoticing that comparison and recognizing\noh by the way all these people are just\ndifferent from me I have a completely\ndifferent set of background I have a\ncompletely different upbringing I have a\ncompletely different set of advantages\nand disadvantages I mean they are them\nthey can still be better at DOTA than I\nam but has nothing to do with me as an\nidentity\nlike doesn't make me a bad human being\nright so noticing is a key part but you\nwant to try to reduce comparison as much\nas possible\nso comparison is key and noticing is key\nthat's actually how you build a healthy\nego is to recognize the actions of the\nego\noh so I'm not speaking up here because\nI'm afraid of looking stupid\nso even though I have something to share\nand I have an important contribution to\nmake my ego is preventing me from\nspeaking that degree of noticing will\nbuild a healthy ego because the ego\nweakens a little bit every time you do\nthat\nthird thing is spend time in nature\nso if we say\nthat comparison feeds ego\nin terms of negative image or positive\nimage both of them are unhealthy\nthe best way to avoid comparison is to\ngo out in nature\nbecause there's nothing to compare\nyourself to\nand your mind May linger with\ncomparative thoughts right you'll have\nEchoes from past things oh I'm out here\njust taking a hike and all my friends\nare doing this it's a comparative\nthought\nbut that thought was born yesterday it\ndidn't come from your nature experience\nso the more time that you spend with\nnature you may sort of notice that\nthere's residual comparison energy but\nthe more time you spend in nature like\nyou're just not thinking about other\npeople\nbecause there's nothing to compare\nyourself to\nand so this is why people I could go\ncamping and stuff they love it it feels\nso good to unplug\nother advantage of going in nature is\nthat there's a natural reduction in\ntechnology usage\nand Technology usage is very\npro-comparative especially social media\nso literally spend time in nature the\nmore the better\ngo for a walk every day\nthat feels amazing if you can\nif you want to go hiking for a couple of\nhours on the weekend like do that if you\ncan afford to go camping for a week or\ntwo and it's like safe and fun and stuff\nlike that do that\ngo sit at the edge of a lake\ntake a row boat out go fishing whatever\nspend time with nature the other\ninteresting thing is that when you spend\ntime with nature\nyou also spend time with yourself\nand this is huge\nbecause growing a healthy ego involves\nspending time with yourself\nbecause when you spend time with other\npeople even if they're very\ncomplementary\nthey're stroking your ego all the time\nyou're going to grow an unhealthy ego\na healthy ego is spending time with\nyourself\ngetting to know who you are just being\nwith yourself it's great\nthe next thing that you need to learn if\nyou want to grow a healthy ego\nis remember the ego is a protective\nmechanism it activates primarily to\nprotect us from negative emotions\nso learning to tolerate\nand not be afraid of negative emotions\nwill naturally reduce the ego\nwill naturally build healthy self-image\nand when I say reduce the ego the larger\nyour ego is the more solidified your\nself-images\nand the healthier self-image is like\nmore of a neutral self-image and we'll\nshare a meditation with you all in a\nsecond about that\nso it's kind of like a smaller ego is a\nhealthier ego\nin a sense\nso as you tolerate your negative\nemotions as you no longer need to avoid\nyour negative emotions\nthen the ego will get healthier\nso just to use our our let's say like\nour answering a question example teacher\nasks a question and I know the answer\nbut I don't want to look dumb\nit is the avoidance\nof feeling dumb or being embarrassed\nthat causes me to stay quiet\nbut if I acknowledge that okay I may\nanswer wrong I could feel embarrassed\nand that's okay\nI can actually handle a little bit of\nembarrassment like I don't need to shape\nmy life to avoid embarrassment at every\nturn\nwe're not saying we're going to go out\nthere and do the most embarrassing\nthings all the time but like in this\nindividual instance like it's just a\nlittle bit of embarrassment the teacher\nwill correct me and then like tomorrow\nlike\nthe embarrassment will be gone\nanything is that the more we avoid\nnegative emotions the more egotistical\nwe become and the more restrictive our\nlife becomes the classic example of this\nis the 180 IQ quantum physics amateur on\nthe internet\nright they're so smart they have such a\nbig ego they know everything else and by\nthe way yeah no I just sit at home and I\nread Quantum Mechanics for fun\nI don't actually do anything with it\nand then if you talk to that person if\nyou work with that person because I\nworked with that person a lot for those\npeople what you tend to find is a very\nvery low tolerance\nfor negative emotion\nbecause why are those people sitting at\nhome studying quantum mechanics instead\nof working you know at jet propulsion\nLaboratories or in a Quantum Computing\nplace\nit's because the gap between being at\nhome and actually like doing substantive\nwork in quantum mechanics involves a lot\nof exposures to negative emotion\nincluding going to class where people\nmay know more than you including going\nto class where people may be smarter\nthan you and I don't like the way that\nthat feels\nincluding being afraid that you may not\nactually be able to get an A in quantum\nmechanics if it's real quantum mechanics\nthere are all kinds of negative emotions\nand what we tend to see is that\nintolerance of negative emotion is\ncorrelated with an unhealthy ego\nso learn to tolerate your negative\nemotions expose yourself a little bit\nmore to negative emotions and your ego\nwill get healthier\nand the last thing to do\nis meditate\nso we'll share a technique with you all\nin a second\nbut before we do that we're just going\nto recap\nor actually we can meditate now\nso I'm going to teach y'all a meditation\ntechnique\nto try to discover the self outside of\nego\nbecause a big part one of the key things\nso this is what meditation does it helps\nyou realize\nthat you are not your ego\nin most of life we go through assuming\nthat our identity is us\nbut even in our language we sort of know\nit isn't\nmy identity\nidentity is owned by you in that\nsentence\nmy self-image\nwho's the owner there\nright\nso how do you understand that because\nonce you understand and you're grounded\nin the true self\nthrough meditation then ego becomes much\neasier to deal with\nso how do we do that so we're going to\ngo through this okay so I want you to\nsit up straight\nand what we're going to do is so sit up\nstraight\nclose your eyes\nlet's start with a couple of deep\nbreaths\nso we're going to start this meditation\nI want you to keep your eyes closed I'm\ngoing to just guide your attention to a\ncouple of things\nand we're going to start\nby focusing on permanence and\nimpermanence\nso we're actually going to start with\nthe outside world\nso I want you to notice\nwhat is permanent or impermanent in the\noutside world\nlet's think about whether the sun is\noutside\nis it daytime or is it night time\nthe weather\nnow we're going to kind of shrink a\nlittle bit\neven as you notice Sensations\nso the sound of my voice\nhow permanent is it\nand I want you to notice\nall of the sounds around you\nand appreciate their impermanence\nI want you to consider the objects\naround you\nchair that you're sitting on\nthe objects in your room\na plant\nhow permanent are those objects\nso objects tend to be more permanent\neven then there are qualities of objects\nthat can be changeable\nso a chair can be disassembled\na plant can grow\na chair can also be moved\nso even the physical world is fluctuant\nthings can be arranged rearranged moved\naround\nthey're not fixed forever in that way\nand even the Sun\nthe sun permanent\nwill it exist for all time\nhas it existed for all time\nand now I want you to withdraw further\ninto yourself\nand look inside you and try to see what\nis permanent\nyou may be feeling particular physical\nSensations\nlike hunger or thirst\nor an itch\nif you feel an itch\nor like your posture is a little bit\nuncomfortable is that feeling permanent\nis hunger permanent\nthirst\nand what about emotions\ndoes happiness last for a lifetime\ndoes Fear last for a lifetime\nand now I want you to notice your\nthoughts\nappreciate for a moment how much your\nlife\nis dictated\nby your thoughts\nwhat are all the things that you do in a\nday because you think of doing them\nI want this I don't want that\nwhat will this person think\nif I do this this will happen I better\nnot do that\nor I absolutely have to do this\nfor this to happen\nand now notice the quality of your\nthoughts\nnotice how they pop into existence and\nfizzle out\nand now I want you to notice your breath\nis your breath constant\neven it fluctuates\nthere is an inhalation\nand exhalation\nit can be Rapid or slow\nor slower\nand now what I want you to settle down\ninto\nis the part of you that has been doing\nthis practice\nthe part of you that has been doing the\nnoticing\nand see that no matter what you observe\nthere is a part of you that is constant\nthe emotion May fluctuate\nbut who is the one who is observing the\nemotion\nis it that person emotional\nAs You observe the breathing\nwho is doing the breathing and who is\nnoticing the breathing\nand notice that you can get caught up in\nyour thoughts\nor\nnotice that you're in a wrong headspace\nso there are times where we fuse with\nour thoughts\nand times which we are aware of them\nand now what I want you to do is sit in\nthat noticing capacity\nwill sit for about 30 seconds\nyou can go into the breath if you want\nto\nthe breath is more on the constant side\nand now I'll leave you with some final\nreflections\nthe first thing to consider\nI'll give you some hypotheses\nso as you practice this do this practice\nfor about seven days every day for a few\nminutes\nI want you to try to figure out\nwhich of these signals\ndo you respond to\nto make the best and worst parts of your\nlife\nso when you're thinking about the worst\ndecisions you make let's say are the\nworst things that you do or the worst\nsituations in your life\nwhat within you dictates you winding up\nin that situation\nand when you make the better decisions\nin your life\nwhere do those decisions come from\nand so look at your life\nin which part of you\ndictates what happens in your life\nand what the effect is when you listen\nto that part of you\nit's a simple way to put it put it is\nwhen you act due to your emotions what\nimpact does that have in your life\nwhen you act due to your thoughts what\nimpact does that have in your life\nwhen you act from the breath\nand you may be asking yourself how does\none act from the breath that's a very\ngood question\nso\nwe can figure that out\nthe next time you want to do something\nthat is good or difficult\nground yourself in the breath as you do\nit and see what happens\nand now go ahead and come on back\nso this is a very useful meditation\nfor understanding what is the ego and\nwhat is the self\nand if we're talking about how to build\na healthy ego one of the simplest ways\nto build a healthy ego is just in\nrecognizing what the limits of ego are\nbecause the most unhealthy egos\nare the ones that think that the ego is\nthe entirety of life\nand the more that your life is\nencompassed by ego controlled by ego the\nworse your life is going to be\nyou may be successful but you'll be\nmiserable\nyou may use all kinds of copium\nand egotistical rationalizations but at\nits core you will be unhappy\nand any observant human will be able to\ntell this about you\nthe only ones who won't notice this\nare the ones who themselves are unhappy\nand look up to you\nbecause they think that getting what you\nhave will make them unhappy"
