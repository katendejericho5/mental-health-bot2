    "transcript": "usually what happens with this kind of\nsituation is we use pressure we use\nshame all these other things as negative\nmotivation in our lives\nand the reason we use negative\nmotivation is because it works because\nit's easy so i'm going to go ahead and\nmove to the interview screen so they'll\nbe able to see you so everyone say hello\nto sidekick\ni don't have chat open that's fine it\nwill not be good for my focus yeah good\nit's not good for my focus as well so um\nsidekick your understanding is that uh\num\nso we're going to be doing let's try to\nget through like three\nokay\nso we're gonna do three role plays um\nthe scenarios that we're gonna\n[Music]\nactually you know if you don't know what\nthe scenarios are we're not going to\ntell you which ones we picked okay okay\nso let's go ahead and start\nokay\ni'm going to skip all the normal intro\nstuff for time's sake sounds good\nyeah\nuh so what brings you into healthy gamer\num so i've been watching uh streams and\nyoutube for a little while and i'm just\nkind of stuck\num and i learned so much from that i\ndecided i'd kind of give coaching a shot\nokay what uh what do you mean you feel\nstuck\nwell like i know there's a lot of stuff\nthat i should be doing\num and i just can't\ndo it like\ni think i'm i'm low i've also seen a lot\nof stuff on like five factor personality\num i've watched a lot of jordan peterson\nstuff uh i think i'm i'm kind of low on\nthe conscientiousness\nand so like i just can't put my mind to\nthings\nso you're stuck in the sense of like\nit's hard for you to focus on stuff\nuh yeah i mean i can focus on some\nthings but i really like struggle in\nother areas i'd say it's like more of\nlike a motivational thing like if i get\ninterested in something i can focus\nreally really well the problem is that i\nknow that there's stuff that i should do\nthat i'm just not motivated\nokay\nby the way if you ever see me looking\nthis way that's where i take notes okay\nso\nwhat kind of notes are you taking\njust talking points things that i might\nwant to keep in mind or come back to it\nhelps me to look for patterns and stuff\nthat we talk about and then if i see a\npattern i can mention it to you and then\nyou can tell me if that pattern's real\nor not wow that's actually really\ninteresting\nyeah\nso um you said you watched dr k you said\nyou watched jordan peterson um\nwhat kind of like patterns what stuff\nresonates with you when you watch that\nkind of content\nwell i mean i i think that like like i\nsaid i i\nyou know so i know i'm capable of a lot\ni just can't really bring myself to do\nit and what i really liked about that\nstuff is like i've\nalways been really\ni feel like there's been a lot of\njudgment\nfrom\nmy parents from even my friends and\nstuff and like\neven kind of from myself\nand what i kind of realized is that i\njust kept beating myself up for like not\nbeing able to do stuff\nand\nthat was actually kind of working it's\nkind of weird like sometimes you know\nwhen i get really frustrated with myself\ni'll get this burst of motivation or\nlike you know two days before the test\ni'll finally like crack and i'll start\nstudying really really really hard\num but then\neven afterward i just feel\ni don't know like i\ni know if i had started a few days\nearlier like i just know i could do\nbetter\nokay\nit sounds like when you get stuck it's\nlike there's this barrier in your way\nand then you have to build up enough\nlike pressure to break it or overcome it\nyeah i mean the way that i've understood\nit is that since i have low\nconscientiousness like there's something\nabout\nyou know something builds up and\nsometimes like i can motivate myself\nbut i think the problem is that you know\ni've got this like\nyou know as kind of born with this low\nconscientiousness\nokay\ncan you define what you mean by that for\nme\nwell like there are two kinds of people\nright so there's people who are like\nintrinsically motivated and when they\nput their mind to something they can do\nit\nand then like people with low\nconscientiousness aren't like that\nso i don't know if you're kind of\nfamiliar with this area of research but\nthere are five dimensions of personality\nand one of the dimensions is\nconscientiousness and it's it's kind of\nlike a scientific fact that they're like\ntwo groups of people there's like\ndisciplined people and there's lazy\npeople\nokay\nand from the way you're describing it it\nsounds like that's like a fixed quality\nwell i mean yeah i mean it's like it's\nscientific\nokay\nhave you ever uh studied anything about\nfixed or growth mindsets\nno\ni mean i know mindset is important\nsure\num\nso\nuh\njust just so you're aware i have my\nbackgrounds as a teacher i taught for\nabout eight years interesting the way i\nrun coaching sessions a lot of times i\nend up teaching people things and then\nwe kind of wrap that back around into\nwhatever they want to talk about\nso one of the things i'd like to teach\nyou today is about growth versus fixed\nmindsets if you're okay with that yeah i\nmean if you think it'll be helpful\nyeah\nso the idea of growth versus fixed\nmindset is understanding like growth as\nin the capability of becoming something\ndifferent of growing of changing\nfixed being more static isolated this\njust is the way it is kind of thing\nokay what happens with a growth mindset\nis you're able to kind of take criticism\nand use that as motivation to change\nsomething\nwhat happens with fixed mindsets is when\nthat criticism comes in you view it as a\nstatic fact that you're not good enough\nand from what i'm hearing from a lot of\nthe things you're saying it sounds very\nmuch like you're in that fixed mindset\nplace\ndoes that sound true to you well i mean\nsort of but like isn't it i mean\nall this research about\nconscientiousness is kind of true right\nlike\nit's true in the sense that like\npersonality theory is like really a\nsociological study\nso it's more about trends than about\nhard facts\nokay i'm sorry i didn't quite follow\nthat can you explain that a little bit\nyeah so\nfor example\nthey might say something like oh like\nthe average person has this much of a\nconscientiousness score\nbut there's so many other variables that\nplay into that and how that person would\nact on any individual day based on their\nown past experiences\nso a lot of times those things break\ninto like 70 30 categories and you might\nbe in the 70 or you might be in the 30\nbut it doesn't mean like you're hard\ncommitted to that thing so if 70 of\npeople who do this thing are\nconscientious you might be in the 30\nwhere you're still conscientious but you\ndon't do that thing\noh that's kind of interesting so i guess\nwhat you're saying is that\na lot of this personality stuff is like\npopulation\nbased kind of\nyeah yeah it's more like kind of\nwidespread statistics okay as opposed to\napplying directly to one individual and\nand you were saying that you think i\nhave like a fixed mindset\nyeah so\nthe idea of a fixed mindset is is very\nstatic right so for example what you're\nsaying is like there's two kinds of\npeople there's people who are born with\nthis intrinsic motivation and people who\naren't\nand you feel like you're in that knot\ncategory\nyeah and the real question is like\nbetween\ngrowth is do you feel you can change\nthat\nwell that's interesting because i you\nknow my\nmy first thought is like\nhold on a second i i gotta like pro like\nthis is interesting\nbecause i mean i was about to say i\nthink you're debating me a little bit\nbecause like if i were to say i can't\nchange\nthen you're going to say well that's the\nfixed mindset\nsure\nand\nand it's interesting i mean i guess\nbecause you're also calling it a mindset\nright which means like logically it\nshould be like changeable\nyeah\nbut there could be like\ndifferent things in the way of that\nhappening easier or not\nyeah i mean i guess i can change i mean\nthat's why i'm here because i i think\nthat like i've seen people change\num you know i've seen a lot of people in\nthis community change and talk about how\nmuch they've changed so i'm kind of like\nopen to that\nis is that something that you can you\nhelp me\nlike adopt a growth mindset\nyeah we can totally do that\ncool\nso\nuh basically the way this starts and\nlike i understand the feeling of being\ndebated in that and that kind of\nsituation\ncoaching works like a choose your own\nadventure\nso it there's not like a right answer to\nany of my questions\nwe're gonna talk about whatever's in the\nway for any of these things so if we're\ntalking about a fixed versus growth\nmindset and you ended up in the fixed\nside that's fine we would just start\nthere\nwe would start on whatever page that is\nand then move on down the choose your\nadventure path\nand then the same thing here where you\nsay i do want to change i do think it's\npossible well great now we're now we're\ngoing to start there we're going to\nstart with what do you want to change\nso what do you want to change\ni i want to be able to like motivate\nmyself better\nlike i want to be able to do the things\nthat\ni know i should do\nso it's the i think second or third time\nyou've used the idea of should\nwhere does that come from for you\nlike why should you do that\ni mean because like look i'm 23.\num i graduated\na little over a year ago\ni still don't have a job\nright like i mean i should i should be\nmoving out of my parents place i should\nbe financially independent\nlike\ni don't know i kind of feel like that's\ni mean isn't that just what we're suppo\nlike we're all supposed to do something\nyou know like\nit's kind of\nyou know it's kind of weird to be like\nwhere i like\nisn't where i'm supposed to be\nyeah\nbut\nfor you like where are those shits\ncoming from\nlike who told you that that's a rule\nabout life\ni i don't really know i've never really\nthought about that i mean i just you\nknow it's just\ni mean like so first thing is like you\nknow my parents are every month or not\neven every month i mean it used to be\nevery day like they'd ask me like hey\nhow's the job search going how's the job\nsearch going i don't think they get\nthat it's hard like kovit has screwed\nthe economy like\nyou know there's some jobs out there but\nthey pay so low that it's not it's gonna\njust destroy my mental\nand like not even gonna help me move\ntowards my goals\num you know the jobs that i want like\ni'm kind of a long shot\nfor um\nyou know part of the issue is that my\nmajor i was really excited about one\nthing but like i think i want to kind of\nlike make a career shift\nand and so there's just a lot of stuff\nthat like\nyou know\nit just sometimes feels impossible and\nlike my parents are kind of like\nconstantly reminding me you know\nlike when is this happening when is this\nhappening when is this happening and\nthen they're also saying stuff like you\nknow you know you can stay as long as\nyou want to but like\nyou know but\nyou know yep always there yeah\nyeah\nso you know\nsometimes it's it's it's hard\nno for sure\nall of that sounds like honestly just a\nlot of pressure yeah i mean it's you\nknow i and and this is the kind of thing\nwhere like it it actually really does\nfeel that way i mean i i feel like i'm\nunder so much pressure\nand\ni know that other people like you know\nwhen you feel pressure it's like you can\nyou know that pressure moves you\nand even for me it's move me like it's\nlike when the you know my my\ncalculus finals is coming up in like\nthree days like that moves me some\nthings change though where like the\npressure doesn't seem to be working\nanymore\nsure\nyeah so it sounds like that pressure\nused to be your main motivator\nand now it's kind of stalled out yeah\nthat's a great way to put it actually\nand so like now i don't know what to do\nbecause like my engine's stalling\nwhat if you didn't have to do all these\nthings\ni mean i i guess that'd be great\nright i could do what i want\nwhat do you want\ndamn\num\nnot to be like this anymore\nyou know i i have passions um i've i've\ninterests i have hobbies\nbut like i can't\nyou know even when i like think about\ndoing those things like\nthere's just so much more important\nstuff to do\num i wish i didn't you know i wish i had\nlike won the lottery i wish i was like\nborn rich i wish i could like actually\ndo what i want to in life\nas opposed to like needing to do all\nthese things but i just i don't know how\nto get started\nso\nit sounds like all of these things like\nthat create this pressure from from you\nfrom your family from your friends from\nsociety\nit's created so much pressure that now\nyou can't move\nand there are things that you want to do\nthere are things that you want to get\nout there and be a part of and progress\nin life and\nall of that but you're paralyzed\nyeah i mean is that something you yeah i\nmean\ni never really thought about it that way\nbut\nyou know\nyou're kind of almost making it sound\nlike it's not my fault\ndo you feel like it is your fault\nwell i mean yeah i mean like it's i'm\nthe one responsible right like i'm the\none who wakes up in the morning and like\nyou know plays games until 1pm and then\nlike tries to apply for a couple of jobs\nand then like plays games until midnight\nso i mean clearly it's my fault right\nlike who else's fault is it gonna be\nthat's a lot to put on yourself\ni mean but isn't it true\nto put all the pressures of society and\nlike it's your fault\nare you saying it's society's fault\ni'm actually a big fan of saying it's no\none's fault\nhow\nhow does that work\nwell\nessentially when we talk about fault\nwe're talking about blame\nand blame doesn't help us\nblame lets us discharge anger or\nfrustration or hurt\nit doesn't actually help us move forward\nso whose fault something is doesn't\nactually help you deal with the fact\nthat that's still a problem in your life\nwow i've never really thought about it\nthat way\nteach me more\nyeah yeah\nthis is my favorite part of coaching\nso um\nlet's go back to the pressure idea\nwe've talked about all this pressure it\nall exists all this stuff\num\ni'm gonna kind of throw some\ngeneralities out there please correct me\nif any of these don't apply to you\nbut usually what happens with this kind\nof situation is we use pressure we use\nshame all these other things as negative\nmotivation in our lives\nand the reason we use negative\nmotivation is because it works because\nit's easy right it's like getting fast\nfood on the way home like it works and\nit's easy we all know it's unhealthy but\nwe do it anyway\nright so we use this negative motivation\nas a way to get ourselves to do things\nwhether it's study for a test apply for\na job talk to a girl doesn't matter any\nof the things right\nso when we use that negative motivation\nthe actual problem with it the reason we\ncall it negative motivation is that it\nbuilds up these negative emotions within\nus\nand then we build up tolerance or\navoidance to those emotions\nas humans our natural instinct is to\navoid things that are uncomfortable\nso i don't want to go near my shame\nshame feels bad i'm going to go over\nhere instead i'm going to go play a game\ni'm going to go see a movie i'm going to\ndo whatever else right\nand so as you build up this tolerance to\nyour pressure your negative motivation\nyou need more and more pressure or\nnegative motivation to overcome it\nhuh interesting\nso by now i feel like it's you\nyeah i mean it feels like\nevery time\ni have to\nthat's so interesting like every time i\nfeel like it takes more\nto get me to motivate myself\nlike true\nyou know because like\nthe urgency has to be like bigger and\nbigger and bigger and at some point it\nalmost feels like too overwhelming\nand then like i just don't know how to\nstart\nyeah i think\nif i was going to take a guess here\npart of the reason you don't know how to\nstart is because all of that pressure\nturns into expectation for how the thing\nis gonna end\nbefore you've even taken step one\nokay\ni'm i'm kind of confused what what do\nyou mean by that\nwhat do you have all this pressure on\nyourself about finding a job being\nindependent moving out all these other\nthings\nwhat happens is those turn into\nexpectations\nyou expect yourself to do it you think\nyour parents expect you to do it whether\nthat's overtly displayed or kind of\npassively displayed or whatever it might\nbe\nand then now we're looking at the result\nof you getting a job and moving out as a\nyou must do that it's an expectation\nbut isn't that i mean how else am i\nsupposed to know what to do like\nso it's not that you can't move that\ndirection\nit's again that\nif that is what you're evaluating\nyourself on is have i already moved out\nhave i already gotten a job i've already\ndone all those things\nwell right now you haven't\nso right now it's going to go back to\nthat negative emotion it's going to go\nback to shame it's going to go back to\npressure\nso how do i\nchange that\nwe have to flip it\nso that you're working on where you are\nnow not working on where you want to be\nthat sounds great\nyeah how do i flip it way better\nso\nthe\nthe first step for this is like it's a\nreally simple trick and people this is\nanother debated thing people never\nbelieve me when i tell them it's this\neasy\nyou have to be already good enough\nwell the example i always use for this\nis like job interviews\nright so in a job interview people\noftentimes view that as\ni'm going to the job interview so they\ncan tell me if i'm good enough for that\njob or not\nand that's actually the wrong way to\nlook at it because you're letting that\nperson and the result of that interview\njudge you\nbut wait when you go in sorry go ahead\nbut like\ni mean isn't that exactly the point of a\njob interview to see if you're good\nenough for the job\nhow does that how does that work bro\nthe job interview is the opportunity\nfor the interviewer to see that you are\ngood enough\nyou're already good enough\nthey might see it and they might not\nthis is where we get back to mindset\nit's your mindset going into the\ninterview are you good enough or are you\ngoing to let that person tell you\nwhether or not you're good enough\nbut like how do i know if i'm good\nenough\nthat's where we start working\nbecause\nthis is some crazy stuff man we're gonna\nloop it all in trust me\nso you said you know you're capable but\nyou can't do it\nright you said there's a lot of judgment\ni see what you're doing you're looking\nat the notes\ni said i just write over there yeah\nso\nand then the whole two kinds of people\nthink the people who get it done and the\npeople who don't right again that's\nresults based\nright so when you're looking at yourself\nbecause these things don't exist yet\nthey can one day\nwe're gonna talk about yet another\ncoaching session\nbut because they don't exist yet\nyou're judging yourself as not good\nenough before you even get there\nwait i'm i'm kind of so so it's i if\nare you kind of saying but like isn't\nwhether you're good enough isn't that\nwhat determines whether you get there\nno you're good enough whether you get\nthere or not\nthat's fair enough right now here today\nhow can you say that you just met me\nsure\nbut i already know that you're good\nenough\nyou don't know anything about me\ndo i need to know more\nwell i mean like don't you like i'm so\nconfused like what do you mean i'm\ngood enough\nso this is kind of the issue with\njudgment is that a lot of times we use\nit as results based\nthe reason why it's easy for me to say\nyou're good enough today\nis because i'm not going to use any\njudgment when i make that\ndecision but isn't that what good enough\nmeans isn't it good enough judgment\ngood enough is judgment when you kind of\nlet the results impact whether or not\nyou feel good enough\nso you're saying it's like about how i\nfeel about myself\nyep\njust like the growth versus fixed\nmindset\ni'm confused so so are you saying that\nwhether i'm good enough doesn't have to\ndo with whether i get the job or not\ncorrect\nokay let's pause for a second\nfantastic job sidekick how did it feel\nfor you\ngood\nuh\nstill a little a little nervous but i'm\nokay\num\nso a couple of things i just want to\npoint out so i i've never i don't i\ndon't know if i've ever seen you coach\nbefore\nuh not since training okay so first of\nall i really um\nwant to just like i i didn't i mean i\nknow you're good\nright so we get feedback\num i hear about some of the clients that\nyou work with in case review and and\nthings like that so i i know how\nthoughtful you are\num i also understand you run office\nhours or case review or or something at\ntimes right i did it for one of the new\ncohorts okay i run the social sandbox\nthing in the main discord okay so you've\nyou've stepped into a teaching role um\nin a couple places which we totally you\nknow understand i mean i know i get\nbecause we have we know you're good\num uh but uh what i really want to say\nis i i really appreciate and just for\npeople who are watching\nuh how much you actually teach\nso a couple of things for people to\nunderstand not every coach teaches as\nmuch as sidekick does and that's\nactually okay\nso part of what we really appreciate is\nthat each coach has particular strengths\nand weaknesses\nbut um i think that you do a really good\njob of like introducing some of these\nconcepts\nand i don't know that as the client i\nfully understood what you were saying\nbecause the concepts are just so foreign\nto the way that i've been thinking my\nentire life\nright sure so some of some of the things\nyou did a really good job of i felt\nmyself\nbreaking apart in terms of like my\nbeliefs about the world\ni didn't find myself believing what you\nwere saying yet it was more confusing\nthan anything else\nbut i i think actually what you did very\nfast which is actually very very good is\nthat a lot of times\nwhat holds people back and and hopefully\npeople who are understanding i know you\nunderstand this so i'm sort of more\nsaying this to chat and stuff is that\nit's our conceptions of ourself right\nit's the idea that when i go into the\njob interview i'm trying to prove\nsomething\ninstead of believing hey like i actually\nbring something to the table i bring\nreal value to this company i can help\nout a lot and if they don't want to see\nthat or if it's not what they're looking\nfor that has nothing to do with my\nintrinsic value\nright if i'm sitting there in the job\ninterview there's something that they've\nalready seen that makes them want to\ncall me in for the interview\nso\nyou did a really good job of sort of\nattacking this idea of results equals\nbeing valuable\nand and the the interesting thing about\nthe motivation and you didn't you know\nget there you got really really fast\nreally far and i know you know this but\ni probably went a little too quick with\nsome of those things because i'm trying\nto cover it a lot faster than i wouldn't\nnormally yeah yeah so so i i think that\nwas a bit fast but i think it's it's\nit's great and i think your strength as\na teacher really kind of shines through\num but i think the key thing that i\nreally want to commend you in is about\n20 or 30 minutes\ni came into this interview expecting\nbeing skeptical myself\ni came into this interview\num\nthinking that this wouldn't help me\ni'm gonna try it because i'm desperate\nbut deep in my heart i was like resist\nlike i didn't\nyou know i wasn't like okay let's go\nlike it was all like a veneer and so the\none thing that you really did very very\ngood and i think very quickly is confuse\nthe hell out of me\nand and it's my favorite thing to do\nyeah so so it's it's like you know if we\nwant to rebuild the right kind of\nmindset the first thing that we have to\ndo is pull apart all the puzzle pieces\nbecause then we can start the process of\nlike putting them back together in a\nhealthier way\nand and so the you know couple things i\nwant to say you you did a good job of\nhelping me understand that hold on a\nsecond maybe some of my assumptions are\nnot\nas held in stone as i thought you did a\ngood job of moving me from kind of\npre-contemplative too contemplative\nso\ni came in knowing all the answers\nbut knowing all the answers led me to\nthe wrong conclusion so the first thing\nthat you've got to do in coaching which\nonce again you did a really good job of\nis helping people introducing doubt into\ntheir world view because if i'm like a\ndoomer or like i think that nothing's\never going to work for me like you can't\nlet people continue thinking that way\nand the way that you do that is by\nactually introducing doubt introducing\nnew concepts getting people to do it i\nthink you did a really good job of\nactually um\nfirst of all you know you take good\nnotes you use your notes really well you\ndid a really good job of when you were\nexplaining certain things\ntossing in personal experiences that\nkind of emotionally hit home\nso you talked about parents you talked\nabout pressure you offered empathy which\nis not something that i get at all and\nthat too is very perplexing\nit's like what do you mean it's not my\nfault like what on earth like the whole\nworld is telling me i'm at fault i wake\nup every single day and i tell myself\nit's not my fault\nthe concept that actually\nmy position in life has more to do than\nmy actions and i i'm i know where you're\ngoing to go with this because over time\nultimately what you know what you want\nto do is\nhelp people understand there is a\ncontribution that you make\nbut\nthere are things that you don't control\nas well and the problem is when clients\nstart to\nassume responsibility for the whole\nworld\nthat they can't change that that's when\nthey really start to feel devastated\nso a fantastic job any thoughts\nyour end was i hard on you i was afraid\noh no i think i think it was good um\nif anything i think there was like uh\nmaybe this is just me um i felt like\nthere were almost too many directions\nfor me to go in as a coach like i have\nlike\na lot of things that i was like\nokay i know like in in a few sessions\nwe're gonna get into this and in a few\nsessions we're gonna get into control\nand then we're gonna talk about like\nshould statements and like all these\nother things like i can see like down\nthe line that's where i would go with\nthis client\nyeah so can you explain to us what were\nthe directions you saw and what you\nthink the value in some of those\ndirections are just toss out a couple\nyeah um so should statements is a big\none i talk to a lot of people about this\num\ni'm not gonna go into the whole whole\nspiel i would do in coaching but um the\nbasics behind should statements is\nthey're actually just not true\nthey're ways we feel about something but\nlike when we say like oh people like\nshould do this thing or they i should\nhave done that thing\nthat's not a fact about the world but we\ntreat it like it is and then when we see\nthe real world and that thing is not\ntrue then it's really really hard for us\nto cope with that\ni should have a job and i don't right\nand then that brings up tons of shame\nand other negative emotions all that\nkind of stuff\num so really helping clients identify\nshould statements and start to tweak\nthem\nso we i call it um changing a two\nstatement fact right so instead of i\nshould have a job say like i want to\nhave a job and i don't and that's hard\nbecause that's actually true\nright you don't have a job and it is\nhard\num\nbut that i should have a job part isn't\ntrue that's like societal pressure\ninternal pressure wherever it might come\nfrom for that person\num the other thing that i uh\nnoted was uh control and understanding\nlike this this is like uh we kind of\ntouched on a little bit when we were\ntalking about results based ideas\nright and in fact we don't control\nresults of basically anything we control\nour actions so you can't control what\nhappens you can control what you do\nabout it\nand so in this case with this client we\nwould have gone into like\nwith goal setting it's not get a job by\nx date it's apply for this many jobs\nthis week\nbecause that's something you can control\nthat's an action and and steve do you\nfind i know this is gonna like please be\nhonest do you find that that works with\npeople\nyes\ntell me a little bit about that\num\ni feel like there's so much that we do\nas a society\nthat puts these pressures these\nexpectations on people and then nobody\never tells them that\nit's actually okay it's fine it doesn't\nmatter if what you want to do is like\nyou want to do art and you're just going\nto work at mcdonald's and then like have\na studio somewhere and do art that's\nfine\nlike it doesn't matter what all these\nthings come from but like nobody's ever\nbeen told that now he's ever been told\nthat that's acceptable\nand so they put all this pressure on\nthemselves either internally or it was\nput on them by their parents or other\nthings in life\nand again all of those things usually\ncome from results-based ideas so uh\nsteve if i can you know and and by all\nmeans protect your clients privacy so\nsure um\nbut can so i'm gonna ask you for a\nquestion if you feel like you can answer\ntry to make it a little bit chimerical\nhave we talked about this before\ni'm not sure what the question is so\nyeah basically i'm i'm kind of curious\nlike what have you actually seen your\nclients accomplish in terms of i mean\nare do people have\nyou know are they working at mcdonald's\nand doing studios and you're welcome to\nchange a couple of the details to\nprotect privacy that's what yeah um\nso i've seen clients who thought they\nwould never move out from their parents\nhouse move out i've seen clients who um\nlike thought they couldn't graduate\nand like get their stuff together and\ngraduate or also i think\nto me some of the more like moving ones\nare\nthe ones who realize like i don't even\nwant to graduate\nlike college was never a thing i wanted\nto do in the first place i'm actually\ncool just like going and having a job\nand like living my life\nand that's personally the things that i\nfind most like inspiring i guess is\nwhen we can ask those questions and\npeople will realize like this isn't\nsomething i want to do\nwhy am i even doing it i'm doing it\nbecause i was forced to i'm doing it\nbecause my parents told me i had to or\nwhatever other\nthing in life\nand so\num\nyeah those are kind of the most\nthe most ones that stick out in my brain\ni would say there's also\ni've had clients who had um\nmore severe emotional stuff\nand\njust telling them that that stuff's real\nand it's okay to pursue therapy for it\nbecause so many people in life think\nlike oh i've been through this but other\npeople have been through worse things\nright and just just being that person\nwho tells them no that's real like and\nit's okay for you to go to therapy\nlike wow\nit's really impactful for people cool\nman i'm i'm so honored to have you doing\nthis work and helping our community and\nstuff like that i'm just thrilled to\nhave the opportunity man i love it here\nyeah and we love having you\nyou"
