    "transcript": "the last thing is spend more time with\nyourself and spend less time with the\nway with the person that you pretend to\nbe\nthat's a healthy way to build your\nidentity\ndoes depression cause pessimistic\nthoughts\nor do pessimistic thoughts cause\ndepression\nthis sounds a bit like the chicken or\nthe egg i'm trying to figure out\nbut i want to hear what you have to say\nthe answer might be obvious\nsomeone who knows more about it\nor both scenarios may exist i don't know\ni'm thinking of someone that doesn't\nhave any serious trauma but still\ndevelop something that causes that\nperson to be sad\nthis is a great question\ni love this question because this is the\nkind of thing that i think we should\nteach everybody\nit's not about clinical stuff it's not\nabout diagnosis or treatment or things\nlike that\nbut what is the fundamental relationship\nbetween having\nthoughts\nand whether they cause depression so\ndoes thinking pessimistically make me\ndepressed\nor\nare my pessimistic thoughts a source of\nthe depression\nbecause if we're struggling with feeling\nsad\nit's like really important to understand\nright\nbecause like if you're feeling sad is\nthis something that is a distortion of\nmy mind that is being created out of my\ndepression\nbecause if that's the case that means\nthat i don't trust my sad thoughts\nor do my sad thoughts come first\nand if they come first do they trigger\nmy depression\nso it's not that i shouldn't trust my\nthought it's that there may be something\nthat i need to do to prevent\nmy pessimistic thoughts from making me\ndepressed\nbecause the tricky thing is that like\nyou don't know what to believe right\nlike\nare the thoughts real and then like i'm\njust not handling them properly which is\nwhy i'm getting depressed or the\nthoughts of creation of this cognitive\ndistortion\nbecause it leads to like two very\ndifferent things like do i need to be\nmanaging my thoughts better like do i\nneed to fix the way that i deal with my\nthoughts so that they don't make me\ndepressed or are they coming from such a\ntoxic place that i need to like learn\nhow to step away from the whole thing\nentirely\nso it's a great question\nand it's confusing for people because we\ndon't you know we don't really explain\nthe stuff\nso let's understand a couple of things\nokay\nthere's a lot of detail about some of\nthe stuff we're going to talk about\ntoday in dr k's guided depression but\nwe're going to go over a couple of core\nthings\nso this is what we know clinically\nsometimes we have circumstances\ncircumstances make us feel sad\nwe have bad thoughts\npessimistic\nand then what can happen is we can\nfeel depressed so let's just call this a\ndepressive episode\nso we're talking about clinically here\nokay so an episode of major depressive\ndisorder this isn't feeling depressed\nnow how do we know that this is a\ndepressive episode how do we know that\nthis is a clinical thing as opposed to\nan appropriate response\nto our circumstances\nwell there's something really\ninteresting about depressive episodes\nif circumstances\nimprove\nor even resolve\nif these are the cause of the sad\nthoughts what this means is that\nsad thoughts\nshould go away\nso what we tend to find in\na depressive episode is that even if\ncircumstances resolve\nand what was making you sad in the first\nplace does not make you sad anymore\nthe depressive thoughts\nremain\nnow this isn't for all people\nbut we do know that circumstances can\ntrigger depressive episodes\nso psychosocial stressors setbacks in\nlife sources of stress things like that\ncan trigger a depressive episode\nbut the interesting thing about the\ndepressive episode is once you get to\nthis point it has a life of its own\nand even if the circumstances resolve\nthe sadness remains or the impairment\nand function remains\nokay this is the case of a clinical\ndepression\nnow\nonce again an oversimplification but\nthis is one of the hallmarks of it right\nso like how do you know if someone is\nclinically depressed one of the key\nthings that i look for as a clinician\nis seeing\nare they distressed despite their\ncircumstances or are they\ndepressed because of their circumstances\nand when i see depression despite your\ncircumstances i.e you're in a good\nrelationship your job is going well etc\netc etc it's more likely to be a\nclinical illness\nnow let's dive in a little bit further\nso\nlet's try to understand if the\ncircumstances are fixed\nwhy does this continue\nand this is where we can expand a little\nbit beyond the cope of clinical\ndepression\nwe can still lean on it we're going to\ntake some important learnings away from\nit but we're going to start to\nunderstand a little bit more in general\nabout how the mind works\nso our mind has a very very important\npart or our brain has something called\nthe default\nmode\nnetwork\nalso a whole video about this in doctor\ncase guide\nthe default mode network is what allows\nus to self\nreflect\nthink\nabout\nourselves\nand essentially form\nan identity\nso i'll tell you all why this is really\nimportant\nso let's say i go fruit picking\nand i climb up into a tree and i fall\nand i hurt myself\nand then let's say i go fruit picking\nagain and i climb and i fall and i hurt\nmyself\nand then i'm walking let's say i'm\ntrying to get into a boat\nand i fall and i hurt myself and i fall\nunder the water\nat some point there are all of these\nindividual experiences\nwhich my mind will then reflect on\nand will come to a meta-level conclusion\ni'm clumsy\nonce i have this sense of identity\nfrom these different experiences\nthis then informs the way that i move\nforward so if someone asks me hey all\noak do you want to come help me replace\nshingles on the roof\ni've never replaced shingles on the roof\ni don't really know like i've never had\na negative experience with that but once\nthe default mode network tells me that\ni'm clumsy i can use that simplification\nof identity\nto\ninform what i should do and what i\nshouldn't do\nso i'm going to say no because i'm\nclumsy\ndo you all see that\nso developing an identity that is a\nsimplified version of yourself\nmakes it easy on the mind because you\ndon't\nit like it's a heuristic it aids in\nprocessing information and making\ndecisions\nso this is what happens i'm not talking\nabout clinical depression but now we're\ngoing to talk just about generally when\npeople feel sad and they feel quote\nunquote depressed whether it's clinical\nor non-clinical\nso similar thing happens\nso i've got a particular thought\nthat's negative let's say sad thought\nfearful thought\nbad outcome\nand then what happens is i form\nan identity\nand in clinical depression what we call\nthis is negative self-attitude so it's\njust some kind of attitude towards the\nself that's negative in nature\nso either i'm hopeless or i think i'm\nincompetent or like i'm not good at\nsomething or other people are better\nthan me or something whatever\nso we form some kind of negative\nidentity\nnow here's what people\nneed to understand about identity\nso once we have and now we're going to\nlean on yoga a little bit so once we\nhave an identity\nor\nego\nahamkar\nwhat this actually does\nis creates a filter\nfor experiences\nso let's say that i think i'm clumsy\nif someone i'm walking down the street\nsomeone trips and falls\nand they\ndrop their child\nand i catch their child\nright\nso i have a very positive experience\nwhere clearly i'm not clumsy i'm like\nreflexive i'm like i caught something i\nsaved someone's you know i helped this\nkid not fall over\ncaught them like this is a good thing\nthat runs contrary to my identity the\ntricky thing about an identity is that\nthat bounces off\nso i don't start thinking oh like look\nat me i'm actually quite dexterous i'm\nstill clumsy but if i trip and fall\nthat sinks right in\nand i let that thought into my mind\nso once we have an identity and this is\nwhy in cognitive behavioral therapy what\nwe'll do is we'll deal with cognitive\ndistortions and biases and what we begin\nto see in cognitive behavioral therapy\nis that like this process is very active\nwhere some thoughts are being bounced\nout depending on what i believe and some\nthoughts are being let in\ndoes that make sense\nnow this is really really tricky\nbecause what our mind is actually doing\nis discarding a lot of stuff\nso i'm going to give you all a good\nexample of this\nso there was recently a study on\nimposter syndrome\nand one of the things that's really\ninteresting about imposter syndrome\nis that when you have imposter syndrome\nyou reject certain kinds of feedback\nwhich reinforces your imposter syndrome\nso specifically what happens in imposter\nsyndrome is that\nwhen you accomplish something\nwhen you have an accomplishment\nand someone says\ngood job you reject it\nbut anytime there's a criticism you'll\nlet it in\nsame person\nwe've even done research into what is\nthe nature of this rejection\nand what we tend to find in people who\nhave imposter syndrome is that they\nattribute\nother\npeople's\nsuccesses\nto\ntheir\neffort\nbut your successes\nare due\nto things like luck\nyou your mind manipulates the\ninformation differently\nso if like your boss says hey great job\nto you for doing such an awesome job\nthis week\nwith\nhandling that difficult client\nyou're like oh i just got lucky\nor like the client actually wasn't that\nbad or like it turned out that\neverything was okay and like\nyou basically knock away the praise\nand if your boss says the same thing to\nsomeone else the next week they're like\nhey great job handling that really tough\nclient the way that your mind handles\nthat if you have impostor syndrome is\nyou're like wow that person is like\nreally great at handling\nlike you know difficult customers\nand if you get negative feedback back\nthat's gonna you know you're gonna let\nthat in and sorry this this is not right\nthis identity\nthe negative feedback you're gonna let\nin\nand so then what that does is now we've\nchanged\nwhat influences our identity because\nwe're rejecting some things\nright\nand so our identity will be more and\nmore reinforced\nnegative identity\nthe other thing to keep in mind\nis that our identity both influences the\nthoughts that come into or\ncome into our head and also produces\nthoughts\nit creates thoughts\nthese thoughts and experiences can then\ngo back\nand create additional filters\nso does your do your thoughts make you\ndepressed or does your depression make\nyour thoughts it turns out that we're\ntalking kind of non-clinically here for\na second the answer is a little bit of\nboth\nso what we also know is the quickest\ntreatment for clinical depression at\nleast that actually maybe ect qualifies\ntoo\nso the top treatments for for depression\nin terms of speed not efficacy\nis actually ketamine\nand what people the interesting thing\nabout the initial studies on ketamine is\nthat they show that if you start like\nantidepressant medication it'll take a\ncouple weeks for it to work\nbut people will notice\nlike hours after ketamine some people\nthere's more research that needs to be\ndone\ni suspect that it's not quite as great\nas some of the initial studies show but\nthat people sometimes experience relief\nof depression within hours of a ketamine\ntreatment\nand guess what ketamine does\nshuts off the default mode network\nit's a dissociative agent right so\nketamine was originally used as\nanesthesia\nso that people could tolerate procedures\nbecause it\nunplugs you from yourself\nwe also have some theories that things\nlike meditation and psychedelics and\nsome of these novel treatments for\ndepression\nwill also\nwork on our sense of identity\nso like\nyou know help us feel connected to the\nrest of the world so like my small\nidentity doesn't feel\nyou know i'm me and i don't feel\nconnected to anyone else and like some\nof these uh psychedelic agents appear to\naffect through that mechanism i'm not\nrecommending the use of psychedelics\nfor the record\nright this is just the research that's\nbeing done we need to learn more about\nit\nbut it comes down to this identity\nmeditation also appears to work by\nreducing the activity of the default\nmode network\nso do your thoughts create your\ndepression or do your depression create\nyour thoughts it turns out the answer is\na little bit emote both i think the key\nthing\nis that they're mediated through the\nsense of identity at least in depression\nat least with the way we're simplifying\nit right now there's more to it right\nwe're not talking about serotonin or\nother networks or other aspects of\ndepression physiologic aspects of\ndepression\ninflammatory aspects of depression etc\nso\na couple of things to keep in mind if\nthis feels like it applies to you i\ndon't know that this is really this\nperson was asking for what do i do about\nit but i'm just going to share with you\nall some thoughts about how to make this\napplicable\nso the first thing is if you're in this\nsituation\nto think a little bit about your\nidentity\nand where it comes from\nso we tend to find when we do this is\nthat our our identity often times is\npieced together from traumatic\nexperiences\nthat have unprocessed emotions and lead\nto erroneous conclusions about ourselves\nso i'll give you all just an example\nfrom my own life so when i was young\ni uh when i started school i was about\none year younger than most of my\nclassmates\nand so what i found was that i sucked at\nbasketball\ni sucked at baseball\ni sucked at football\nso i concluded\ni'm\nnot\nathletic\nnow it turns out that the reason that\nprobably the biggest reason that i\nsucked at all three of these things is\nbecause i was a five-year-old competing\nagainst six-year-olds\nor i was a four-year-old competing\nagainst five-year-olds\nthe thing is this sense of identity\nstuck with me\nand these experiences aren't wrong it's\njust these experiences every time i got\npicked last for the basketball team it\nemotionally hurt\ni hated pe i knew i was gonna get picked\nlast all the time\nsince i was nervous and getting picked\nlast\ni like would screw up sometimes right\nbecause i don't know how to play and the\nkids would make fun of me that would\nhurt too\nsometimes that even resulted in bullying\ni was like four or five at the time so i\nhad no idea how to process emotions so\nit just developed into an\nidentity so as i\nwanted to develop confidence in myself\nand as i'm sure you all can understand\nthat even today i sort of still\nexperience this from time to time where\nthis will create thoughts in my head\nso people will ask me hey look do you\nwant to go do this and i'll say no\nbecause i'm not athletic\nso how do you deal with that you start\nby sort of\nworking on this by understanding where\ndoes it come from\nwhere did i start to believe this about\nmyself\nthe second thing to do\nand then as you ask that hopefully you\ncan reinterpret it right and develop\nlike a better understanding that\nresolves this emotional hurt and starts\nto change your identity\nsecond thing is really important\ntake a look at your filter\nwhat\ndo you\nreject\nsubtle sometimes it's like i'd almost\nsay it's almost impossible to figure out\non your own that's not true but\nit's just so much more effective it's\nhard to see your own cognitive biases\nthis is another reason why it's good to\nwork with someone right so when i work\nwith my clients i'm able to spot their\ncognitive biases way faster than they\nare\nand if you all have watched like call-in\nstreams or interviews that you do you\nwill notice the cognitive bias you don't\neven have to be\ntrained\nyou will notice the cognitive bias in\nsomeone way before they do\nso it's hard to do\nbut really pay attention to your filter\nand what do you reject and what do you\naccept\nand then ask yourself\nif i filter these\nwhat\nimpact\ndoes this filter oh my god this is so\nterrible\nhave\non my identity\nbecause here's the thing\nif you have imposter syndrome and you're\nrejecting\nyour own successes and appreciating\nother people's and letting the criticism\nin\nholy crap\nno wonder you feel like an imposter\nbecause all the evidence\nthat you're not an imposter that you're\nactually a decent person\nhas been ruled inadmissible\nso you're not going to let it in\nonce you have awareness of that so this\nis actually there's research on this\nthat if you have someone who's got\nimposter syndrome what you can actually\ndo is have them reframe\nfrom this to this\nand have them notice hey anytime you you\nget praise pay attention\nand notice does your mind say oh this is\njust because i got lucky\nnotice you rejecting it\nand then ask yourself why do i think\nthat i got lucky but i'm willing to\nattribute no actually like\nand there's even like an exercise that\nyou can do as an imposter where you can\nlike sit down and like ask yourself when\nyou get a good achievement at work\nask yourself like really think through\nokay what are the things that i did do\nto deserve this i'm not saying at the\nend of the day that i deserved it or\ndidn't get lucky but what was my\ncontribution\nright you can well i showed up every day\ni i did actually work really hard it was\nvery challenging like i asked for advice\nthese are the things that i did do\nand when you do that kind of cognitive\nreframe it starts to melt away at the\nimposter syndrome\nanother thing to consider since we are\ntalking about a depression is getting a\nclinical evaluation\nright so like you can do all this kind\nof stuff but like\nremember we sort of started talking\nabout this so we're kind of like some of\nthis stuff could be like a clinical\nillness and some of this is just the way\nthat our mind works\nhow do you know which is what the\nnatural question is and that's where\nlike you don't know right so they're\ntrained professionals who know how to\ntell the difference and you should go\nsee one\nthe last thing to consider\nis unplugging from your identity\nright so we know that for example\nketamine i'm not suggesting use ketamine\nthat should be used in a you know\nlicensed prescribed way\nbut essentially what we know is that if\nyou're stuck in this thought loop where\nyou have a particular identity that's\ncreating thoughts\nwhat we know is from various kinds of\nresearch you can do things like meditate\nor even some pharmacologic agents that\nare prescribed that can help you unplug\nfrom your identity\nlast thing that we already touched on a\nlittle bit today is that another way\nfrom unplugging your from your identity\nis actually spending time with yourself\nwith nature and away from other people\nbecause remember a lot of your identity\nis what you project\nright especially for something like\nimposter syndrome\nbecause who you are and who other people\nthink you are is like two different\nthings and so to spend time with\nyourself sometimes literally what you\nhave to do is spend time away from other\npeople\nand like i don't know how to say this\nbut like\ni don't know that if you're a castaway\non a desert island and you're living by\nyourself for 20 years i don't i don't\nthink it's possible to have imposter\nsyndrome\nthere's no other people\nto judge you\nso you can't be an imposter\nright maybe i'm wrong maybe there's some\ncastaway it tells me oh yeah i actually\nhad the worst apostles syndrome of my my\nlife\nwhat we tend to find is that spending\ntime with nature like literally just\ngoing for a walk or hiking or camping\nlike helps with unplugging from this\nidentity that we construct\nand keep in mind that this identity we\nconstruct is getting worse through\nthings like social media\nbecause now like\ndoes a lot of reddit karma make me a\ngood person\ndo a lot of likes\non my tweet make me a good person\nwe're starting to equate\nsocial media approval\nwith intrinsic value of a human being\nand so unplugging from that is really\nreally important so spend time with\nyourself\nlike you know\ncaution with socials\nso it's a good question\nwhat comes first\nthe sad thoughts or the depression\na really fundamental question\nright\nis it my negative thoughts that are\nmaking me depressed\nor\nis my depression making the negative\nthoughts\nit may seem like a little bit of a\nchicken or the egg but it's actually\nreally important because how do we d how\nwe deal with it is very different so\nit's important\nbecause if my negative thoughts are\nmaking me depressed i need to be a\nlittle bit more careful about not\nletting them get out of control\nor i need to address them\nbut if my thoughts\nare from a state of mind that is\ndistorted cognitively\nthen like i don't need to treat them\nthat seriously right because it's all\ncognitive distortion anyway\nso in order to understand that chances\nare there's a little bit of both right\nbut as we get into the nuance of it and\nas we get into detail we start to see\nthat\nactually we do have some answers so in\nthe case of a clinical depression\noriginally it can be triggered\nby a thought that's appropriate to your\ncircumstances but once it gets triggered\nit has a life of its own\nand can persist even when the\ncircumstance that originally made you\ndepressed is completely gone\nin a more general sense if we understand\nhow the mind works we've got to be super\ncareful\nbecause when we have sad thoughts\nsometimes they can form into an or we\nhave negative experiences and sad\nthoughts they can form into an identity\ni will be alone forever\ni will never find love\ni'm not athletic\nand the tricky thing is once we develop\nthat identity the identity comes with a\nfilter\nthe problem with the filter is that as\nwe start filtering\nthoughts that are contrary to our\nidentity that's when we really get into\ntrouble\nbecause it turns out that you are\nlovable you just reject that thought and\nyou let the thoughts that reinforce the\nidea that you're unlovable\ndo i say lovable or unlevel\nyou reject the thoughts that you reject\nthe evidence that you are lovable in\nfavor of the evidence that you are not\nlovable\nand once that happens it just reinforces\nthe identity strengthens the filter etc\netc\nit's a good question\nand hopefully today we've dived into a\nlittle bit about how that works and to\ngive you all some tools to play with\nthe end of the day you want to be a\nlittle bit careful about how your\nidentity formed in the first place and\nbe a little bit critical of that\nsecond thing that you need to do is\nunderstand how your filter works\nwhat's the information that you reject\nand what's the information that you let\nin\nyou can start to do some kind of\ncognitive reframes things like that if\nwe're really talking about issues of\ndepression another thing that you should\nreally do is get a clinical evaluation\nright because is this like more of the\nyogic like this is how my mind works or\ndo i actually have depression like\nthat's something for a clinician to\ndetermine\nthe last thing is spend more time with\nyourself and spend less time with the\nway with the person that you pretend to\nbe\nthat's a healthy way to build your\nidentity\nyou"
