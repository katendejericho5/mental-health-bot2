    "transcript": "it's sort of like you can't learn the\nright\nway to feel because\nno matter what happens you're being\ngiven the same feedback so your your\nmind has not learned how to sort of\ndifferentiate between like pride and\nshame yeah the topic is really just uh\nwhat i want to improve on what do i want\nto approve on welcome friend\nthank you and what do you go by\nuh i go by\njosh\nunderscore ow on discord but i mainly\njust go by josh okay\nso josh what do you want to improve on\nwell i want to improve on feeling proud\nof myself\nbecause\nwhenever i work hard and do everything i\ncan to work towards something and\nsucceed i just i don't feel proud of\nmyself\nor my accomplishments or the effort that\ni even put in to getting the end result\nand so i thought that i thought that\nmaybe i would someday just like wake up\nand\nfeel happy and just ecstatic incredible\nabout\nknowing that i put in so much work and\neffort to accomplish something that\nmattered but\nit just doesn't end up that way whether\ni succeed or fail and it just kind of\nfeels empty\nwow that sounds tough dude so let me\njust make sure i'm hearing you correctly\nso it sounds like you do put in effort\nyou work hard\nand you don't always succeed but\nsometimes you succeed\nyeah\nand you're trying to figure out um\nand so help me understand what how do\nyou feel about yourself when you do\nsucceed\nwell\nwell i guess uh\ni don't know maybe\nwhenever i succeed because\ni like i actually managed to go out for\nruns and exercises sometimes and even do\nmy homework\nbecause i'm in college and all that but\neven when i succeed and do all that i\nguess i just kind of feel\nmaybe maybe it's more so content\ni'm just like okay well i guess i got\nthat done that that's good now i just\ndon't have to like stress about the rest\nof my day knowing that i did something i\nguess that was productive i don't really\nfeel ecstatic about it i see just kind\nof so what i'm hearing is that you you\nkind of feel real maybe relieved like\nyou don't have to worry about that\nanymore but you don't feel any sense of\npride\nyeah\ndo you think what you've accomplished is\nnoteworthy\ni think\ni think it's it has been noteworthy yeah\nbecause\ni mean it's like\ni\nlike i'm i'm regularly working out\nright and i even go out for runs often\nand\nand that just has actually been\nkind of enjoyable to do just the process\nand\nit feels like\ni don't know i feel less stressed out\nduring my days\nas a result and then i'm able to have\nbetter control over doing the things\nthat i know it need to do but it just\nkind of\num\ni don't know it just doesn't feel like a\nbig giant hallmark like i sometimes wish\nit would\nas in oh yeah now i'm moving forward in\nmy life now i'm doing it i'm on the\ngrind it just doesn't\nfeel\nmaybe euphoric or as\nor as amazing as i thought it'd be\nyeah so i'm i'm almost hearing that when\nyou i i okay let me make a couple of\nassumptions here josh and you let me\nknow if these are accurate so the first\nis that\nprior to working out consistently\nconsistently you sort of had this idea\nthat if you started working out\nconsistently you would like\nfeel really good about yourself you're\nlike yeah i'm doing it\nyeah\nand now that you're doing it you don't\nreally feel the pride that you were\nexpecting\nno no do you feel proud about anything\nthat's i've been i've been thinking\nabout that question a little bit but\ni wonder if i ever felt any sort of\npride\nin my life at all i mean\ni don't know if it's anything like pride\nbut when it any whenever that comes to\nmind all i can think about or the times\nwhere i was\npart of something that\ni had to do with a whole group of people\nthat i had to get to know like there was\na time when i was in baseball and i was\nin junior leagues for that and i just\nfelt\nso i guess i felt so alive whenever i\nwas just\nwith my teammates and i got to bond with\nthem and practice with them and do\nscrimmages and\nthat just felt really\nit just felt really invigorating\nlike that was just a\npart of my life that i've been missing\nall along was like camaraderie\nbut i guess i felt pride\nmaybe i did feel pride more so\njust in what\ni was able to accomplish um\nin terms of what my team accomplished\nbut not me\nbecause it wasn't about me i just felt\npride i guess maybe towards my team\nand the things that we were able to do\nand how far we were able to go\nthings like that okay so i'm i'm hearing\nthat the only thing that you were able\nto take pride in was something that was\na team effort\nand even when you talk about\nthe team effort you almost\npurposely exclude yourself as a\ncontributor\nyeah and\nand the only time that i ever considered\nbeing a big part of that whole process\nwas when they directly actually\nbecause we had a championship game like\nat the very end of our\nof our league and we ended up losing it\nlike horrifically we just got absolutely\ndestroyed but then we had a party or get\ntogether afterwards to celebrate how far\nwe came and\nthey gave me a whole trophy for\nfor just um for how much i meant to them\nhow much i'm into the team and it's\ncalled the heart award right it's like a\nwhole acronym about like having heart\nendurance\nattitude respect and team and i just and\nthey gave it to me last out of everyone\nelse's trophies and i remember that\nbecause i was like man i i feel so\nappreciated you know because they\nbecause\nmy efforts my attitude actually meant\nsomething\nyou know and it\nmade a positive impact in their lives\nand they they really that was\nthe heart and soul of the team\nand knowing that like i never felt that\nway during the season but it was only at\nthat moment\nafterwards when they gave me that word\nthat i just\ni felt like\ni was just\nreally really happy i was just\nit just felt amazing\nwow\nhow are you feeling sharing this story\ni mean i'm just recalling like that\nmoment i mean i just feel\ni don't know i just feel like it just\nfeels like bliss\nor happiness because then it just calls\nback to all the\nall the highs and lows that we've been\nthrough together and the things that\nwe've done and just what we said and did\nand just what we went through\nand just how that all culminated into\nthat moment where i got that trophy it\nfelt like\nit was worth it it felt like that i\nthat it was deserved or earned and\nthat just\nfelt like that was the proper ending to\nan amazing story\ni guess\nsounds boss dude\nsounds good absolute boss\nso let me ask you something when um josh\ncan you tell me a little bit about\nyour\nupbringing yeah of course\nso\ngenerally\nthe way i understand it now is i\nwas kind of brought up\nas a\nand treated as sort of a special or\ngifted kid\nright so it was i just grew up with me\nmy mom\nmy biological parents foursome and then\nand one older brother\nand\ni\ni've always just been\nkind of a\nlike an introverted kind of shy but kind\nof kind kid you know and then i grew up\nas the years went on\nmy parents and teachers and other older\nadults or peers of mine would be like\nman josh you're just such a such a kind\nand smart kid like you're gonna be able\nto do great things man and then\nand then that just kept going on and on\nfor years\nuntil especially i got in like junior\nhigh or high school\nwhen\nit felt like\nit was more of an insidious thing\nto me because\ni felt like\nmy parents and\nall the other peers and adults that\naround me telling me these great things\nit just felt like\ni had to be\nthe chosen one right i felt like i was\nlike anakin skywalker okay and i had to\nbe the one to be able to save the world\nand bring balance\nand just do all these great things\nbecause i was just so great unlike\nanyone else like the avatar\nand i just\nit felt\nlike i had\nto just be that guy and whenever\ni faced struggles and was human and\nfailed and fell fly on my face it just\nthose times just absolutely decimated me\nmentally because i felt like i had to\nkeep\ni had to keep people um to believe keep\npeople believing that i was the guy that\ni was the chosen one and then\nwhen i wasn't i i failed then i was just\nwho was i at that point i'm just some\nloser\ngoing through high school don't know\nwhat they're doing with their life\nokay so and then it just it sounds like\nyou've been carrying around a lot of\nexpectation\nyeah\nnow so when you did well\nwhat did your\nmom parents say teachers say like let's\nsay like you're eight years old and you\nget an a on a test\nhow do they respond\ni mean\npretty much\nthe same way they're like oh wow josh\nlike you made an a on the test like\nman you're so freaking good at like math\nor whatever like you're just\nlike i'm so proud of you\ni love you man and i'm like\nthanks\nand i guess\nhow would you feel\ni would just be like oh\num\nyeah i i guess i got 100 on it like i\nguess it's something\nyeah\nwhatever\nokay so\nokay\num can i think for a second josh\nyeah good\ndo you know how to feel pride\ni'm\npretty sure i don't\nhow do you understand\nthat\nprobably because i know i\nnever had an experience where i\npersonally within my being feel and\nrecognize\nwhat\npride is even like especially myself i\njust it's just kind of like a foreign\nentity to me i guess yeah so let's let's\ntry to understand this okay\nso here's so let's start with this idea\nof being gifted\nso what i'm kind of noticing is that\nlike let's say getting a hundred on a\ntest is something that many people would\nbe proud of\nwhereas what i'm noticing is that like\nbecause you were kind of gifted\nthere was an expectation that you would\ndo well\nso even if you get 100 on the test\nthat's not something to be proud of\nthat's like baseline\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nso it's like it kind of like is tricky\nbecause if we expect you to get a\nhundred\nthe most you can do is meet expectations\nsometimes you're going to fall short of\nexpectations but you can't really exceed\nexpectations\nand when we really think about like what\nare we proud of we're not proud of doing\naverage we're proud of doing exceptional\nbut if your expectations are so high how\ncan you ever be exceptional\nyeah does that can i i would like to add\ni would like to add something um tidbit\nthat i think is really important as well\nyou know mine\nwhenever\nthat complex became more of a thing\nwhenever i was growing up in high school\nand junior high like even when i would\nfail like my parents especially would be\nlike well yeah no worries man like\nyou fail you you can try again and you\ncan do better and even whenever they\ngave me that kind of feedback it just\nkind of\nwas too late and it's cemented in my\nmind where i thought to myself i put it\non myself where i was like no i need to\nbe better like i need to be\na chosen gifted one right even if\neveryone else says so i don't i don't\nthink so how did you feel like how did\nyou feel when they said that\ni\ni don't know i just\nmaybe it depended on the situation but\neither i was\nkind of like yeah i guess i failed it's\nwhatever or i was just absolutely\ndevastated and i beat myself up and when\nyour power said it's okay you can try\nagain later how did that make you feel\njust made me\nfeel like an absolute\nlike a failure\nlike i just so it's kind of interesting\nbecause because your parents are saying\nthings that should be encouraging but\nwhat effect does it have on you\nnot a positive one\nyeah like how do you understand that\nlike so okay your kid does poorly right\nso you're a parent and you say it's okay\nyou can try again\nhow do you understand like how does that\nmake a child feel worse\nyou know\nthat's a good question i i'm not really\nsure i even have the answer to that is\nthat how you felt\nwell yeah it was\nokay\nyeah so i think it's kind of weird so\njosh i think there's\ni think we can sort of sort this out\nfirst of all\num sorry i i don't mean to laugh because\nyour situation is serious but\ni i think that there's like a couple of\ninteresting things going on\nand i think a lot of it has to do with\nexpectation\nso oftentimes as gifted kids when you\ngrow up like you're given all these\nexpectations right and you internalize\nthese expectations like i'm supposed to\ndo really well\nand it's kind of weird but oddly enough\nyour parents were dismissive of your\nshame\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\ndoes that feel accurate to you\num\ni think so\nyeah because they never really yeah\nright so so i know it sounds kind of\nweird because when we think about\nparents we think about like oh like this\nisn't dismissing shame a bad thing\ni mean i mean isn't it a good thing like\ndon't we like not want like if our kid\ndoes poorly like don't i want to\nencourage him and like help him not feel\nshame anymore so the interesting thing\nthere is i i'm sort of noticing that\nlike in your upbringing you were kind of\nlike not allowed the range of success\nright so even when you failed they sort\nof dismissed that\nand then like even when you succeeded\nthat was sort of expected so i'm sort of\nnoticing that i almost think about shame\nand pride as two sides of the same coin\nlike in order to be ashamed of something\nlike you know you can be proud of the\nsame things that you could be ashamed of\nif you did well like you can maybe be\nproud of that if you did poorly like you\ncan feel ashamed of that does that make\nsense\nyeah they're like kind of like the same\nlike on the same spectrum but just at\nopposite ends of the spectrum like shame\nand pride with me\nso the really interesting thing here is\nthat i i think it's it's kind of\ninteresting that they dismissed your\nshame\nand they they tried to like\nhelp you feel better about yourself but\nsomewhere along the way i think they\njust sort of like\nstarted communicating on a level that\nyou were just not on\nlike i don't mean that they were above\nyou or below you i just mean that y'all\nwere like operating on different\nwavelengths in terms of like achievement\nand lack of achievement\ndoes that make\nsense\nyeah\nand i imagine it's actually quite\nconfusing for a child to grow up in that\nsituation\nso like let me just put it to you this\nway like if i do poorly on a test and my\nparents are like\nit's okay there's no problem with that\nyou should do you'll be fine because\nyou're so smart\nit's kind of weird because what they're\ntelling me doesn't actually mirror like\nreality right like if i did poorly like\nthey're not saying hey you did poorly\nyou know you should really like think\nabout trying better next time or like\nlet's think about what you could have\ndone better does that make sense like\nthey're not saying that\nthey're sort of like\nlike even when you do poorly they're not\nlike validating the fact that you did\npoorly\nis that fair\nyeah i mean it's just kind of swept to\nthe wayside exactly right\nand then even in in periods of time when\nyou could be\nwhen you should be proud proud right and\nyour parents are like they're giving you\npositive feedback\nbut like the thing is you have high\nexpectations on yourself and also\nthe feedback they give you when you're\ndoing well and the feedback they give\nyou when you're doing poorly actually\nseems kind of the same\ndoes that make sense\nyeah pretty much\nright and and so like i i don't know if\nthis is kind of if if i'm making sense\nhere but it's sort of weird because like\nas a child if they're saying oh you're\nso smart everything will be fine when\nyou do well and oh you're so smart\neverything will be fine when you do\npoorly it's like how does that child\nlearn\nwhat to be proud of and what to be\nashamed of\ndoes that make sense\nyeah it's just just confusing you get\nthe same thing either way exactly\nright it's confusing like you like\nyou're getting the same thing everywhere\nand so what i think may have actually\nhappened is like i don't know that you\nwere like\nyou know how to feel proud i mean you do\nwhen we'll get there in a second but the\nfirst thing that i want to share with\nyou is i i don't think that this is like\nit's sort of like you can't learn the\nright way to feel because\nno matter what happens you're being\ngiven the same feedback so your your\nmind has not learned how to sort of\ndifferentiate between like pride and\nshame does that i mean i i i hear that\nyou know how to feel shame and you know\nhow to feel pride so like but is this\nsort of resonating with you or you think\ni'm kind of like in the wrong ballpark\ni\ni think that's actually pretty accurate\nso what i'm sort of hearing from you is\nthat like you don't\nknow how to feel pride and i know it\nsounds kind of weird because normally\nwe're actually like taught how to feel\npride and the key thing about how to\nfeel proud\nis like even if i'm going to kind of\ngive you an example which is like let's\nsay that\ni'm an overly optimistic protective\nparent like i'm a helicopter parent who\nthinks that my child is is jesus christ\nreincarnated plus with the the\nspirituality of jesus jesus christ with\nthe mind of stephen hawking and the\nphysical form of let's say michael\nphelps okay if you know who those people\nare right so it's like i have the uber\nchild the most amazing child in the\nworld and i am constantly telling that\nchild you're amazing you're amazing\nyou're perfect you're perfect you're\namazing everyone you're just the best\nthing ever\nhow\nhow do you think that child feels about\nthemselves\ni mean\nthey'd be like\nuh yeah that's just my bottom line like\nyeah that's yeah\ni guess i'm just amazing\nright so like like they're gonna grow up\nsort of feeling amazing about themselves\nbut if you really like think about those\nkids\nthey actually have like very they're\nlike very insecure\nright i don't know if you've known kids\nlike this but like kids who are grown up\ngrow up in a situation where their\nparents are like overly overly overly\nsupportive they're like very easily\nthreatened and like become insecure very\neasily oftentimes they'll grow up as\nbullies\ni don't know if you've had like any is\nit does this kind of make it have you\nknown people like that maybe you are\nsomeone like that\nbut\nand it's sort of like the just providing\noverwhelming positive feedback without\nany kind of like negative correction\ndoes not raise like a healthy amount of\npride and self-confidence in a child it\nraises things like arrogance\nand underneath the arrogance is\ninsecurity\nlike my point here is that\nwhen children aren't given both sides of\nthe coin and i think that's what sort of\nhappened with you\nyou sort of like i don't get the sense\nthat you even know what to be proud of\nbecause you have like such high\nexpectations of yourself and like people\nhaven't oddly enough even validated when\nyou did poorly\nand this sort of results in\nsomething that's kind of interesting\nwhich is\nwhy do you think you felt so much pride\nby getting the heart trophy\nbecause\nwhenever\ni was with that team and it was it's a\nwhole sport where you have to rely on\nyour teammates you can't just do\neverything yourself\nand then whenever an outside party like\nthat people you get to know and trust\njust\nopenly\njust\naccept you for who you are and then\nreward you for that then it just\nit just felt amazing because i was\naccepted\nand they know that i failed as well\nbecause we all did\nlike we were all there together\nand no matter what like we still stuck\ntogether as a team and that couldn't be\nsaid i even remember that can be said\nfor most teams that were in that same\nleague at the time\nlike even my best friend's like mom\nwho was uh my best friend was also in\nbaseball at the time doing the same\nthing like even his team apparently\ndidn't have that kind of like bond or\nsynergy\nyeah that my team had so i think there\nare a couple of other important elements\nthere right so one is as you mentioned\nthe acceptance the acceptance despite\nthe failure\nso this is kind of interesting because\nit let that kind of sidesteps\nexpectation\ndoes that make sense like because your\nmind has come to accept\ni mean expect particular things\nand so when you get praised for\nsomething and the other thing is like\nyou haven't been praised your entire\nlife for being the heart and soul of\nother people you've been praised for\nbeing gifted\nand so like what is it like to get\npraise in an area where you didn't think\nthat's something you were capable of\ndoes that make sense nope\nyeah\nso because i what i'm noticing is that\nwhat really feels very like what you\ntake can take pride in is actually\nthings that were free from your\nexpectations\nit's when other human beings saw value\nin you\nin a way that you did not expect value\nfrom yourself\nno\ndefinitely\nso do you have any thoughts about how to\napproach this\nyou know\nand i have to preface i really do love\nhealthy gamer and\nand i've watched so many other vods and\nstreams it's a wonderful place\nbut\nwhat would come to mind for me\ni don't know is just somehow free myself\nfrom that from those kinds of\nexpectations but\ni don't really\nknow how to apply something like that\nto my situation it just makes perfect\nsense i think it's challenging i think\nyou've got the right answer but and\nwe're going to help you with the how\nokay\nso the first thing is that\nas you mentioned so i think a lot of\nthis has to do with expectations\nbecause the problem is the expectations\nyou put on yourself\nmake it so that you've got two options\nyou can you know where perfection is the\nbare minimum\nright which is like how can you ever\nfeel proud if you're if perfection gets\nyou sort of a bare minimum pat on the\nback\nand then you can also fall short\nso there are a couple of different\nthings i think what we can try to do is\nrectify a lot of like what you've missed\nout on so interestingly enough the first\nthing that we could try to do\nis have a place that validates your\nshame\ni know it sounds kind of weird\nright\nso like practically talking to finding\nsome kind of friend or i don't know if\nyou're in mental health treatment or\nyou're working with a coach or whatever\nbut like i think i know it sounds kind\nof weird but like i think one thing\nthat's missing here\nis that if we kind of assume that this\nis like\nyour brain doesn't really know\nwhat pride feels like i think a\nkey part of that is in\nhelping validate actually when you do\npoorly\nthe interesting thing is that when we\nvalidate okay josh you didn't do a great\njob here\nand you really could do better and i\nwant you to work like extra hard if\nyou're willing to and then like give it\nanother shot\nif someone said that to you and you\nactually gave it another shot and you\nsucceeded how do you think you would\nfeel about yourself\ni i think i may actually\nfeel more proud of myself 100\nright\nand why is that\nbecause they knew\nwhat i went through and failures that i\nhad to experience in order to eventually\ntry again and then succeed absolutely\nright because then your effort means\nsomething\nlike before when they're like oh you'll\nget it like no big deal\noh it's fine you got this\neasy\neasy clap\nand then it's like\neven if you work your ass off it's like\nthey expected it to be easy for you\nso there's no acknowledgement of your\neffort\nand so like if there's no\nacknowledgement of your effort if no one\nelse recognizes the effort that you're\nputting in\nyou're putting in all this effort and\neveryone else is like by the way this\nshould be easy bro because you're so\ngifted then when you succeed it's like\nwhat am i supposed to it took it was so\nhard for me to accomplish what everyone\nelse is saying is easy how on earth am i\nsupposed to take pride in this\ntell me\ni can't\nabsolutely\nyou work out every day\nor you work out a lot consistently you\nsaid\nyou go running\nis this an achievement\nthis is kind of like\nlike that cool is it hard for you to do\nthat\nwell\nyeah just force myself to get out and do\nsomething instead of like playing games\nor whatever like\nit's not an easy thing to do\nokay\nso like that's what i want you to focus\non right so i know it sounds kind of\nweird but validate you can start by\nvalidating how hard some of these things\nare for you\nyou can validate how a year ago or two\nyears ago like\nyou know you weren't doing this every\nday\nso that's number one\nsecond thing\nis if you want to let go of expectations\ni think especially if you can do this in\nthe community\ni think you've got to open yourself up\nto feedback in dimensions that you're\nnot gifted\nnow this can be a little bit tricky but\nlike i don't know like i think heart and\nsoul is beautiful because it's like the\nkind of thing that you didn't expect\nfrom yourself right so one thing is you\ncan let go of your expectations we'll\nget to that in a second or what you can\ndo is start operating in in your area in\nareas where your expectations don't\napply\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nso like that's a little bit tricky like\nwhat is that and that's where i'd say\nlike if you've been if you're viewing\nyourself as a gifted kid then i would i\nreally do stuff that's like a little bit\nmore like volunteer oriented or\ncharitable\nbecause i think those are the kinds of\nplaces where i'm not hearing that\nsomeone said that you know you you are\nan amazing human being all the time and\nall this kind of stuff so i'd say that\nlike you don't have to let go of your\nexpectations you can just operate in\nplaces outside of them and we already\nhave evidence of that right so we know\nthat when there's a community endeavor\nwhere people can value\nyou\nlike\nin a way that you don't necessarily\nvalue yourself that's what's going to\nmake you feel proud\ndoes that make sense\nyeah because they're not they wouldn't\nbe expecting that from me or and more\nimportantly you're not expecting it from\nyou\nyeah right that too so so like\noperate in places that are free from\nexpectations so i'd say very very\nconcretely\nif it's community oriented i think\nthat's ideal if you're it sounds like\nyou're in college so like i think if you\nwant to do some volunteer work or\nsomething like that like go work at a\nhomeless shelter go work at an animal\nshelter like go and do something where\nyou're just trying to make the world a\nbetter place\nlike you're just gonna go and try to\nlike help people that you care about\nand i think that would actually\nhopefully help but that's kind of tricky\nbecause you have to like don't go in\nwith too much expectation does that make\nsense\nyeah so you gotta you gotta be a little\nbit careful and then the last thing in\nterms of letting go of expectation i\nthink that's where you really have to\nlike probably do some more deeper work\nso i'd say like start with number one\nand number two which is pretty easy\nwhich is like first of all\nhave people validate your struggles or\neven your shame right so that's going to\nbe really really important and then the\ncool thing is if they can validate your\nstruggles and your shame like\nthen you can feel proud\nlike it's kind of weird\nsecond thing is do some community or\ncommunities and have groups of people\nand then also something that like you're\nnot\nexpecting a lot from yourself\nso i would not suggest that you go and\nmaybe you can maybe something like if\nyou're like a math tutor\nbut like you know try to steer clear of\nlike intellectual activities where just\nask yourself if i did a good job at this\nwould that be the bare minimum like is\nthat what i expect or or could i\nactually take pride in this kind of just\nask yourself right like do i view myself\nas gifted in this way and if the answer\nis no then you should move towards that\nactivity\nthe tricky thing here that you've got to\nwatch out for is that oftentimes gifted\nkids\navoid the things that they're not gifted\nin\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\ncan you explain it a little bit or how\nyou understand it\nwell\nyeah because if i like on some\nconsciousness or unconscious level just\nunderstand that i look at something and\nthink oh man i'm really going to suck at\nthat like i don't want to\ndo that because\ni'm going to suck at it and\ni don't want to be viewed as\nor view myself as being a loser in that\nperson i feel bad perfect right so\nthat's where i think the antidote there\nis that you know the reason that you're\nvolunteering let's say\nis not you don't really care about i\nmean you will care there's a part of\nyour mind your ego will care about how\nyou're perceived but you're gonna go\nthere to like try to make another human\nbeing's life a little bit better for\nlike one day at a time\ndoes that kind of make sense so i want\nyou to kind of let go of yourself a\nlittle bit and like go and do something\nthat you can take pride in but you're\nreally there to help someone else it's\nnot really about your self-image so\nthat's going to be like one tip that you\ncan sort of use to try to do things\noutside of your comfort zone\nand then the last thing is letting go of\nexpectations which is where i i think\nlike i mentioned you need to do a little\nbit of deeper work where you've really\ngot to start to ask yourself\nyou know like when did i start to view\nmyself as gifted what impact has it had\non me\num\nyou know potentially even have a\nconversation with your parents about\nyou know how like actually you've\nstruggled a fair amount and like it's\nbeen hard for you to hear that\neverything is gonna be okay\nbecause\nsometimes things actually weren't okay\nright and like what i'm really hearing\nfrom you is that\nlots of people told you that things were\ngonna be okay when actually you were\nstruggling\nand that sounds incredibly isolating to\nme that sounds to me like you really\nwere not seen at all\nand in fact what was happening is people\nwere\nconjuring an image of what they thought\nyou to be instead of actually seeing who\nyou are\nhow does that sit with you yeah\ni\ni think that makes\nyeah i think that makes perfect sense\nyeah and so so the the way to let go of\nexpectations is to really sit with\nyou know josh what is the image of you\nand who are you\nand if you're open we can give that a\nstab now but you know i'm not expecting\na whole lot\nbecause it's a it's a complicated\nquestion usually this is the kind of\nquestion that i would ask after someone\nhad done weeks or months of work\num but do you want to try answering that\nnow or you want to just sort of\nwork on that kind of on your own\noh i'm absolutely down to it now so let\nme ask you what is the image of josh\nwell\ni guess josh is just uh\njust some dude\nthat's out there\nsomehow trying to make or that wants to\nsomehow try and make the world a better\nplace i guess\nis that the image that other people see\nnope\nwhat do other people see\ni guess they're more like\noh yeah it's just just some other dude\nnamed josh like i guess he's\nhe seems like he he might know what he's\ndoing he seems like a pretty uh\ninsightful or\nsmart guy\nyeah okay so when when they look at you\nthey see someone who's insightful\ncapable\nyeah\ndoes this joshua they see a great this\nis hopefully a good example\nwhen they see josh working out\nconsistently\ndo they think that josh struggles to\nwork out or do they think he's highly\nmotivated\nwell i they would probably think that\ni'm just disciplined and i'm just\nit's easy right so\nthe image of josh is insightful capable\ndisciplined gifted\nand what is it like to actually be josh\nit's like oh man i really want to play\noverwatch\nbut man i got homework to do with that\nlet's do it like 12. all right i guess\ni'll go and do problems with something\ngosh josh are you smiling right now\nyeah because that's actually my\nsituation right now\nand how does it got work to do and i'm\nactually gonna do it how does it feel to\nbe that person\nit just feels\nkind of funny to\nthink that i'm like a\nlike a balloon like a bumbling buffoon\njust being like oh i've stopped it\ngotta get there okay let's get into the\nwork you know i'm just fumbling around\nso i get to where i need to go\nyeah\nright\nand so let me ask you\nwho deserves to take more pride\nthe bumbling balloon who like\nstruggles with themselves and eventually\nfloats in the right direction\nright bounces themselves towards working\nout and doing homework and stuff like\nthat or someone who's like oh josh\nthis new fragrance by josh makes you\ninsightful capable disciplined\nyeah no definitely the balloon guy\nbecause he's just trolling you know like\nhe don't care\nso i i i mean hopefully that helps you\nsome but i i think that just like sit\nwith those two images\nand and recognize that like\nactually you may not be as gifted as you\nthink you are\nand bizarrely that may mean that you can\ntake pride in what you've accomplished\nbecause the truth of the matter is that\nyour life like even though you have\ncertain advantages and we're not saying\nthat you don't have advantages\nthere are like genuine things that you\nstruggle with right and consistently\nworking out\nmeans fighting\na thousand small battles with yourself\nand winning at those small battles but\nman like each inch of territory that you\ngain when fighting against yourself like\neach each inch\nyou've paid for with sweat and blood in\ntears\nand overwatch rating\nwhat do you\nthink\nyeah i think that it's like\nnot only do i work out like i even\nlike practice like\nsome yoga in the morning like i get up\nat 4 00 4 30 i\ngo to sleep at like 6 seven\nwake up and then immediately after i do\nthat i meditate and then study\nmy class you know so i can get ahead and\nknow what i'm doing\neven then like sometimes just doesn't\nthose accomplishments don't really\ncompound\nhow do you feel about waking up at 4 30\nin the morning how does it actually ask\nthis how does it feel to wake up at 4 30\nin the morning do yoga start studying\nwell\nit\nit kind of sucks yeah yeah\ntell me about it\nlike i just want to sleep and i look at\nmy my clock on my phone like oh it's 4\n32 all right i guess i'll get out of bed\nso i was i'm not gonna get through or\nwhatever i'm like okay let's do it yeah\ndude it sounds good reluctant\nit sounds like you're trying to force\nyourself into building a better life for\nyourself\nyeah\ndefinitely because\nbecause like before um it is this is a\nlittle personal but it's not too graphic\nor anything like\nmy my grandpa\nrecently unfortunately passed away\nright and\nthen\nwhenever i went to his funeral and i\nmourned for him like everyone else may\nhave just been feeling just sadness and\ngrief and all that like i felt like a\ngrief of a sort of sense of and we're\nchristian um we're\nour fan was like a cr like christian\nprimarily and all that and i was like\nthinking to myself please god just let\nme\nbe a stronger person you know let me be\nmore capable so i can actually make the\nworld a better place and not\nlet all these efforts that my grandpa or\nanyone else went through go to waste\nmake it worth it\nyeah so i think it's\ncan be healthy to ask for strength\nand also i i would encourage you to\nrecognize josh that you you've probably\nbeen given that which you've asked for\nand the only thing that really gets in\nthe way of seeing it is your own ego\nyeah probably\nso just spend some time with who the\nreal josh is\nversus the image of josh\nand hopefully as you kind of navigate\nthat maybe if you're a little bit lucky\nyou can start to feel a little bit of\npride in waking up at 4 30 every day\nyou know being grateful to yourself for\nworking this hard\nright even if pride isn't really there\nyet\nmaybe you can try start with some\ngratitude right so like at least like\nhopefully your grades are getting better\nand you're starting to get in shape and\nthings like that and you can be grateful\nto yourself for\nputting in the effort\nyeah\n100\ni totally want to do that\nwell good luck to you josh any questions\nor last thoughts before we wrap up\num\nwell\non an un on a completely unrelated note\num i recently watched uh one of the\nvideos um that was posted on the youtube\nchannel and it was about\nuh\nhow change occurs and that was just\nreally insightful and i\nwant to keep applying that to the rest\nof my life too so i can\nfigure out how to learn and do all that\nand just improve and it's just just been\nreally helpful\ncan you give us a tl dr on the video i'm\ni'm not actually\noh oh yeah no no 100 so basically what\nit's about\nis like\nyou read a reddit post which was a gift\nof like uh\nbasically this person saying oh yeah\nwell i know darn well that i should be\nmaking change while they're watching\nyour videos but they're not able to and\nthey still don't do anything about it\nand then you're like yeah well you\ntechnically don't really need to do\nanything about it right\nyou really just do the work in your head\nand\nand i thought that was weird at first\nwhen i heard that and then i kept\nwatching them and it was just really\ninsightful because then it\nbecause then those suggestions you gave\nin that video about\nuh sitting on what you learned and\nreflecting on it i actually did that\nwhen i walked into my backyard like\nright after i finished the video\nit made me think about\nhow i wanted to\nwhen i played overwatch um a few years\nago and i climbed to like the\nelo or one of the top elos in the game\nthat's exactly what i did in order to\nget better at the game\nyeah like i watched mods i studied pro\nplayers\nand what they did and compared that to\nwhat i was doing\nand\ni just\ni just got better at it and i improved\non what i needed\nto get better at even though i suck\nabsolutely yes thanks for jogging my\nmemory yeah so it's it's surprising how\num\npeople don't realize that most of change\nis like internal\nand we also don't really unders we don't\nreally acknowledge that\nunless we like inten we can\nintentionally facilitate the process of\nchange which i think is also the same as\nlearning\nright so if we kind of think about like\nif i'm stuck in the same pattern over\nand over and over again i'll even use\nthe phrase oh like why do i never learn\nand and there are actually some\ninteresting things you can do to\nfacilitate learning one is one of which\nis reflection so thanks for sharing it\ni'm glad that the video was able to help\nyou\ngood luck to you josh yeah\nyeah thank you\nkeep doing what you're doing i love it\nthanks man it's an amazing place\nthanks for contributing\nmy pleasure\nall right so let's just take a quick\nmoment to recap because i think there's\na lot of stuff about\njosh's situation that is actually quite\napplicable\nso sometimes we have difficulty taking\npride\nin stuff\nwhich\nis kind of weird because we just sort of\nassume that everyone knows how to take\npride in stuff right like it's an\nemotion so shouldn't everyone be capable\nof feeling pride the interesting thing\nis that some of us actually grow up in a\nsituation where based on\nhow certain behaviors are reinforced\nwhat kind of feedback we get it's\nactually like very hard to take pride in\nyour accomplishments\nand so there are a couple of key things\nthat we we can see from this situation\nthe first is sort of growing up as a\ngifted kid\nbecause if you grow up as a gifted kid\neven if you excel\nthat is actually the bare minimum of\nwhat is expected of you\nright so it's kind of interesting\nbecause if we think about like\nperformance like if i perform at this\nlevel\nor if this is the performance that's\nexpected of me and then i perform up\nhere instead\nthis is the window that i can take pride\nin right because like this is what i was\nexpected to do and i actually ended up\nway over here so i should be proud of\nlike over performing\nthe interesting thing so if we kind of\nthink about it if expectations are at\nthe ceiling right if we're gifted and\nwe're so intelligent and like oh like\ngetting an a is so easy for us\nthen actually what happens is it's very\nhard for us to feel pride because\nexpectations are so high the best we can\ndo is meet the minimum expectation\nthe interesting thing is that the the\nthe other side of the coin is also\npresent where oftentimes gifted kids not\njust gifted kids but especially gifted\nkids\neven when they do poorly they're not the\nshame they feel the negativity they feel\nis oftentimes swept under the rug\nand so like instead of your parents\ntelling you oh that was really hard for\nyou you know like oh like it sounded\nlike that you know you really struggled\nthere sometimes what will happen is\nparents don't want to be negative\ntowards their kids so they'll try to be\nreassuring\nso that when i'm reassuring i'll say\nthings like oh like you'll be fine next\ntime don't worry about it you got to be\ni'm sure you're going to get an a it's\nno big deal you're smart you're smart\nyou'll figure it out\nthe interesting thing about that kind of\nreassurance is that it's actually\ninvalidating\nbecause at that in that moment when the\nkid really really struggled to study and\nwound up with a b or maybe they did\nstudy and they studied very hard and\nthey still got to be\ninstead of acknowledging that struggle\nwhat we do is we kind of sweep it away\nright oh it'll everything will be fine\nand interestingly enough by invalidating\nthe struggles that gifted kids actually\nface\nwe don't give\nthem an opportunity to like improve and\ntriumph\nbecause even if they struggled and got a\nb and i say oh it's totally fine you'll\nget an a it's not a big deal and then if\nthey study twice as hard and they get an\na\nis it a big deal have you progressed\nhave you done a better job are you is\nthis something to be proud of oh no no\nno this is just the expectations\nso interestingly enough\nthe inability for some or some people's\nlack of experiencing kind of like\nvalidation when they struggle also makes\nit hard for them to feel pride\nbecause if i say to you oh that was\nactually really hard\nyou know i know you struggled a lot i\nreally hope you can you can try again\nand like i'm gonna try to help you and i\nknow it's gonna be tough but i believe\nthat you can do it\nand when we acknowledge the struggle and\nthen when they improve things actually\nchange right because then i can take\npride in it\nbut by sweeping the difficulties that\nsome people face under the rug like we\nactually\ndon't we sort of take away their ability\nto like grow and triumph and take pride\nin that and so oddly enough\nsometimes we don't really know how to\nfeel pride\nand the last thing to consider when it\ncomes to not knowing how to feel pride\nis if this stuff has happened to you\nthink about the expectations you place\non yourself\nbecause if you're if you internalize\nthose expectations then even doing a\ngood job is not pride worthy\ndoing a good job is the minimum the only\nthing that you can take pro pride in is\nif you did exceptionally exceptionally\nexceptionally exceptionally well right\nbecause that's what you expect from\nyourself you expect your from yourself\nthe absolute best\nit's a very very\nrelatable very very common issue\nsurprisingly\nand like more and more people experience\nthis but then we we sort of like don't\neven recognize for a moment that pride\nis something that we learn how to feel\nin our upbringing based on certain\nexperiences that we have and if you\nhaven't had those experiences if your\ndifficulties were swept away if your\nexpectations were really really high\nsometimes we end up with young adults or\nadults who actually like kind of don't\nknow how to feel pride\neven when they do a good job\nyou"
