    "transcript": "the mind tells you not today not today\nnot now not now\nwe'll do it tomorrow hear all the\nthousand reasons you're not ready yet\nyou could fail it may not be good enough\ndr k what do you do on days when you\ncannot seem to focus on the things that\nyou need to do when do you just consider\nthe day a write-off\nwhy does this\nhappen seemingly with no explanation\nhey all i love to\ni have to write this article for a\nwebsite and cannot for the life of me\nseem to focus today\nall i have to do is edit it and change a\nfew minor things but no matter how many\ntimes i sit down to do it i just can't\nfocus\ni've done a number of things in an\nattempt to take my mind off it\nchanged my surroundings sat in different\nplaces ran some errands cleaned the\nbathroom did the dishes mopped the floor\nwent for a walk now it's late afternoon\nand i'm once again trying again\nbut still with no luck\nlook this person is unlucky\nright so i'm wondering at what point do\nyou consider the day a write-off how do\nyou stop from judging yourself harshly\nfor not working on whatever you needed\nto even though you gave it an honest try\nwhy are some days like this\nit's a great post fantastic post\nso sometimes\nyou got to get some work done\ni really got to get this work done\nand you try to get the work done and you\njust can't seem to focus on it\nyou sit down to do the work the work\nneeds to be done\nand your mind is like yeah\nsorry bro i'm not just gonna do it today\nor sorry girl not gonna do it today i\njust can't focus\nso then you're like well crap okay i\njust can't focus today\nso do i do i take an l do i just say to\nmyself okay this day like is lost like\ni'm screwed okay i'm just not it's just\nit just ain't happening today because my\nmind ain't gonna do it\nright it's kind of weird\nthen the other problem is that like you\nreally got to do the work and you know\nthat you sometimes can do the work like\nsometimes when you sit down\nyour mind is willing to do the work\nbut on today is an unlucky day\nbecause that's what happens right it's\nrng\nit's like some days the mind is like\nyeah okay i'll do it other days it's\nlike no matter what you can do\nor whatever you need to do your mind is\nlike yeah i just ain't gonna happen\ntoday\nand so the other thing that happens is\nlike on those kinds of days it's like\nokay like i don't waste the day\nso what am i gonna do\ni'm going to be productive today\neven if i can't do it i'm going to try\nto change i'm going to run some errands\ni'm going to clean the bathroom do the\ndishes i'm off the floor went for a walk\nright\ni'm going to do all the right things\nnow it's late afternoon\ni'm trying again no luck\nbecause that's what's supposed to work\nright i'm supposed to help the i mean\nif i clean things for a little bit then\nmy mind will focus\nit's really confusing\nbecause our mind\ndoesn't do what we want it to do\nand then comes this whole thing about\nlike do i accept that\ntoday is a loss\nbecause then it's like you get in this\nreally tricky sort of situation where\nit's like\ndo you beat yourself up for not being\nable to focus or do you go down this new\nage like positive emotion like\nacceptance like oh\ni'm sorry bro you couldn't just work\ntoday you did your best but you did it\nyou did the best it just didn't work out\nyou're unlucky it's not your fault don't\nworry about it love yourself accept\nyourself don't beat yourself up because\nyou couldn't write the article that you\nneed to write\nit's like wait a second do i just accept\nthis do i do i keep trying do i beat\nmyself up do i\naccept do i you know do i\nis it toxic if i like beat myself up and\nlike give myself a swift kick in the\nbutt and make myself sit down and buckle\ndown and work\nor do i accept that this is an l today\nand i'm not gonna do anything and do i\npractice self-love and self-compassion\nand then tomorrow like what if it\ndoesn't happen again and do i self-love\nmore do i need more of a hug like how\nmuch self-love and cleaning and other\nkinds of distracting crap that is\nproductive right because we don't want\nto waste the day because if we waste the\nday then we'll beat ourselves up and\nwe'll feel guilty we don't want to do\nthat\nso like what do you do like if you sit\ndown and your mind doesn't want to do\nwhat you tell it to do like what do you\ndo do you self-love do you\nhope for better luck tomorrow because\nthat's what we end up doing right\nwe just\ntry again tomorrow and hope that things\nwork out\nso we're going to talk about this and\ni'm going to teach y'all what to do with\nyour mind\nbecause the thing is\nthe mind doesn't want to do the work\nand when your mind doesn't want to do\nthe work\nwhat do you do about that\nso let's understand a couple of basic\nthings\nlet's talk about human performance for a\nmoment\nso you've written an article before\nyou know how to write the article\nand yet your individual performance at\nwriting the article is highly variable\nso we have this assumption that\nperformance\ncorrelates with like knowledge or\nexpertise\nso this is a conversation that i have\nwith people that i work with in finance\nso a couple years ago i was working for\na distressed investing private equity\nfund\nso this was a group of people who\nessentially take failing companies\nand try to figure out okay which of\nthese failing companies are actually\nlike have the potential to be very\nsuccessful\nif we change management or if we do\nthings like that and which of these\ncompanies are actually crap\nright so they're basically like the\ndumpster divers of finance where\nsometimes there's like really good stuff\nin there that due to market forces or\nmismanagement or whatever like\nis crap\nand it's really interesting right\nbecause what these people are\nessentially doing is investing in failed\nbusinesses\nso the dumpster divers of finance in a\ngood way\nand the cool thing is that like on a\ngiven day like if they make the right\nchoice they can make a ton of money\nbecause there's actually like a really\ngood company out there that just\ngot unlucky\nbut they really could provide a lot of\nvalue and things like that and if you\nmake the right choice it's like you make\na ton of money so they were doing really\nwell\nactually\nand so as we were talking about it's\nlike how do you know\nwhich ones to invest in\nso that you can talk about\nanalytics and number crunching and all\nthis kind of stuff and like you they use\nall those kinds of tools but at the end\nof the day\nit's kind of rng i mean it's not truly\nrng but there's some things just a line\nwithin you and what i really found when\ni was working with these people is that\nthey sort of like it was like highly\nvariable depending on how their brain is\nworking that day\nso if their brain was working really\nreally well they would be able to see\nthe pattern\nright they were able to see the forest\ninstead of the trees because the\nanalytics are all the trees\nyou can crunch the numbers i do my\ndiligence for all 10 of these companies\nbut then something about my brain and\npattern recognition just clicks and i'm\nable to see it\nso the issue became about\nnot being more experienced or being more\nknowledgeable\nbut understanding how to achieve a\ncertain state of mind and controlling\nthe mind to get it to do what you want\nit to do\nthe other place that we see this is in\nesports\nand not even esports just playing video\ngames\nso theoretically when i work with an\nesports professional\nevery game they play\nthey have more knowledge than the game\nbefore\ntheoretically every game they play they\nshould be getting better\nright because you've played one\nadditional game\nbut we tend to find is that performance\nis wildly variable\nso what determines\nwhether you're going to play well that\nday or whether you're going to play\npoorly that day you don't have to be a\nprofessional you can play dota league of\nlegends cs go valor like whatever you\nwant fortnite pub g\nvampire survivors whatever you want\nand what you'll tend to find is that\ntheoretically you should be getting\nbetter every day but what we tend to see\nis people are hard stuck at their rank\nfor like a decade\nand on some days they play well and on\nsome days they play poorly the problem\nis that they\ndon't know how to cultivate the right\nkind of day\nthey don't know how to cultivate the\nright kind of mind\nso we're going to talk about is how to\ntrain your mind to focus\nwe're going to go to the heart of it the\ncrux of it so we have a whole guide\nabout adhd and how to do stuff\nwhere we talk about all these different\ncomplex factors we talk about\nenvironment we talk about the\nneuroscientific effects\nof cleaning your bathroom\nwe talk about things like prioritization\nand organization and we talk about all\nsorts of like how your mind works how to\ncontrol distractibility in the mind we\ncover a bunch of different stuff in the\nin the guide and all that stuff is\nuseful\nbut what we're going to tunnel down into\ntoday right because we don't have time\nto do 20 hours of teaching today\nthere's a lot of good stuff in there but\nwe're going to focus on the crux up\nso let's start with a little bit of\nneuroscience\nso i have my mind\nmind\ndoesn't\nwant\nto\nfocus\nand then there's this other part of your\nmind\ni need\nto focus\nand there are times where like you kind\nof\nyou know\nthat your mind is not doing what it's\nsupposed to so the first thing to kind\nof acknowledge is that they're like\ndifferent parts of you\nso you know that you need to focus but\nyour mind is like i don't want to\nso we're going to sort of say that\nthere's a self this is actually a part\nof the mind too but i'm going to put it\nin the self column for now so the first\nthing to understand is that like\nyou can direct your mind but sometimes\nthe mind doesn't comply\nnow from a neuroscience perspective\nthe ability for this\nto win\ninvolves\nessentially frontal lobes\nso frontal lobes are responsible for the\nthings like impulse control\nthey're also responsible for things like\ndelayed gratification\nthey're also responsible for things like\ndirecting our attention\nokay so we want to basically strengthen\nthe frontal lobes\nbut what i want you all to just notice\nis that there are different parts of\nyour mind that are kind of conflicting\nand how do we make one win and the other\nlose because right now what's happening\nis this part of the mind is winning\nright now the way that the equation is\nis like this\nright\nso let's try to understand\nwhat our options are\nso i've got work to do\noption number one\nversus\nand if i try to work i'm gonna be it's\nhard to focus\nif i don't work i'm going to be bored\nmine doesn't like being bored\nso\ni still want to be productive\nso even if i can't work let me be\nproductive\nwith like cleaning\nright because then the day isn't a whole\nloss\nthat's good right\nand then some of us\nmaybe this doesn't apply to you but i\nknow it certainly applies to me\nwe'll do something that's dopaminergic\nso we'll do something like a video game\nso which of these\ndoes our mind hate the most\nwhich one does it want to avoid at all\ncosts\nabsolutely right\nso if we're going to rank these\nwhat does it want to do the most\nwants to do this first\nthis second\nthis third\nand this fourth\nthe problem is that your mind\nknows\nthat you will you can't tolerate this\nso your mind is playing a waiting game\nwith you\nwhere all i have to do\nis like i know that this person isn't\ngoing to accept boredom\nso instead what the person is going to\ndo\nis they're going to move towards\nproductivity\nright even if they stop me from doing\nthe dopaminergic crap for a little while\nit's just the waiting game\ni know i'm gonna win this so like here's\nthe options if i force this person to be\nbored\nif i don't focus on the work\nand i let the mind be\ndistracted they're going to become bored\nand once they become bored\nthey can't tolerate being bored all i\nhave to do is distract them from the\nwork they're going to become bored\nthen they're going to be like oh my god\ni'm wasting time they're going to be\nproductive for a while they'll work for\ntwo to four hours right because we've\ngot errands and stuff and then what are\nthey gonna do\nthen it's the afternoon oh no the day's\na loss\noh\ni'm trying again no luck okay well might\nas well just play video games and might\nas well just like take the day off\nso your mind is playing a game of\nchicken with you\nand\nit's secret weapon is that it knows that\nboredom will control you and the more\nthat you use your cell phone\nthe more that you take a dump and\nbrowser at it at the same time the more\ndopaminergic stuff that you do the more\nintolerant\nto boredom you become\nright because when i grew up we used to\nstill get bored we used to do this thing\ni don't know if you guys have ever done\nthis before called playing outside\nand people may ask me they're like what\ndid you play outside\nwe didn't play something we just played\noutside every day after school between\nlike three and six o'clock\nwe would just go\nand play things\nsometimes it would involve balls and\nbats and basketballs but sometimes it\ndidn't\nwe personally played this game called\nmulti-type\nwe made up our own game called\nmulti-type and we would play multi-type\nand it was like relatively fun but the\nrules were kind of rigged\nright\nso this is the key thing if you want\nyour mind to focus on a particular day\nthere's one simple thing that you can do\nunderstand this\nbut understand that all of the mind's\npower over you revolves around boredom\nso when my dad was in medical school\nhe had a rule for himself\nthat if he didn't feel like studying\nand he taught me this rule by the way\nif he didn't feel like studying he\nwouldn't study\nhe was allowed to sleep as much as he\nwanted to\nhe was allowed to sit there and do\nnothing as much as he wanted to\nbut those were his only two options\nbesides studying\nthat's it nothing else\nthis was off the table\nthis was off the table\nhe's got two choices\nwork\nboredom or in his case\nsleep\nthat's it\nif your mind doesn't want to work that's\nokay we don't need to work if you can't\nfocus no big deal we're just going to\nsit here and do nothing for the next\neight hours\nand whenever you're ready\nto work we can do that but if you don't\nwant to work no big deal\nwe can take a nap if you're feeling\ntired or you're tired let's go lay down\nit works incredibly well\nincredibly well i did it myself\ni didn't feel like working i wake up in\nthe morning\nmake myself some breakfast it's time to\nwork i don't feel like working okay you\ncan go lay down\nwhat but what am i supposed to do when i\nlike you can sleep if you're tired like\nif you're tired like obviously you need\nenergy\nthen when i'm done sleeping i get up i\nsit down at my desk and i stare at the\nfriggin page\nand if i don't want to stare at the page\ni don't have to stare at the page i can\nclose it\nand i'm just going to sit there\nthat's it\neventually what'll happen is your mind\nwill\nfocus on work\nas long as the mind knows that there's\nno alternative\nbecause here's the thing\nyou can actually tolerate boredom better\nthan your mind can\nyour mind is going to be completely sol\nif it's bored it's the one that's\nsuffering not you and that's where we go\nback to the sense of self\nthe self can tolerate boredom fine like\nwhat is meditation it's sitting there\ndoing nothing with a no mind state\nlike isn't that boring no like it's\nactually wonderful we love that if you\nreally sit down and do it\nso if you want to learn how to focus\nwhat you've got to do is like practice\nfocusing\nand the way that you practice focusing\nis you keep doing it until your mind\nstarts listening\nand if you get bored you get bored we're\nnot gonna come up with fake stuff to do\nwe're not gonna come up with\ndopaminergic stuff to do and you may say\nbut what what about the stuff that i do\nneed to run errands\nso this is where it's really important\nare you deciding to be productive\nbecause you feel bored and you don't\nwant to waste the day or did you set out\nwith a schedule\nto do this stuff on this day\nright there's a big difference\nis your productivity an antidote to\nboredom or is it stuff that you actually\nneed to get done someone earlier was\nasking what about doing things like\nworking out so i have to like cook i'm\ngoing to shower i'm going to exercise so\nthat's fine like i can even run errands\nfor an hour too but that's going to not\nbe an antidote to boredom this is really\nimportant to understand\nbecause the moment i make it an antidote\nto boredom what i'm actually doing is\ngiving in to my mind\ni'm not actually controlling it it's\ncontrolling me it's just tricking me\nwith a more\nit's just sweetening the poison\nright there's like\nit's just like poison without the guilt\nbut it's still giving into the\ndistraction of the mind\nso what should you do if your mind\ndoesn't listen to you you're gonna sit\nthere and you're gonna\nbe bored until it's ready to work and\nwhen it's ready to work we can work and\nthen something magical will happen\nonce your mind understands that you're\nnot screwing around and it will you will\nliterally have it sit there for 12 hours\nand do absolutely nothing\nit'll start working\nit'll start working\nyou will have taught it how to do what\nyou tell it to do\nyou'll sit down and you'll say we're\ngoing to read this thing\nnow there's also like a couple of other\nlike tips here about intentionality so\nif you're struggling to do your work\nyou know i would sit with the self\nwe'll talk about this kind of like this\nis almost like a meditation of sorts\nright\nso i want you to start by noticing your\nmind i don't feel like working\nand then what i want you to do is sit\ndown and and prepare yourself for work\nand see what i don't feel\nreally is\nis this a feeling\nor is what's happening i i'm looking at\nthe page\nbut my thoughts are wandering\nand then like this is going to create\nanother feeling\nlike frustration i'm wasting my time\nwhatever\nand then what's gonna happen is as we're\nfeeling frustrated and wasting our time\nlet me go clean\nand as i go clean what am i actually\ngiving into\nwho's in control here\nmy frustration\ni cannot tolerate frustration\nand as i can't tolerate frustration i\nlose control of my life because think\nabout that\ntwo people one can tolerate frustration\none can't who's screwed in life and\nwho's going to do well it ain't\ndifficult\nso sit there and look at yourself close\nyour eyes the next time you need to work\nand look at what does i don't feel like\nworking actually mean\nand then what i want you to do as the\nself\nlet's say you have to write a paper\ncan i write\na single sentence\nwell i don't know which sentence to\nwrite that's what the mind rebels with\nso notice that as well you want to\nnotice all these thoughts as they come\nup\ni don't know\nwhat to write\nokay\nwhat do you need to learn\nso that you can write the first sentence\nhow do we get to the first sentence\nwhat's getting in the way of the first\nsentence\nright is it research is it just putting\nsomething out there is it\nsomething like what like\nwhat is it that's getting in the way\nnow here you have to be a little bit\ncareful because if you're not\ncareful\nyou'll end up somewhere over here\nbecause they'll be like oh we need to do\nmore research we need to do more\nresearch we need to do more research we\nneed to do more research\nbecause oftentimes i don't know what to\nwrite\nis actually i'm not confident\nand then you're looking for some kind of\nresearch research research\nso that you start to feel confident and\nthen you know what to write sometimes\nwhat you have to do as the self is tell\nit well too bad i understand that you're\nnot confident we're going to write\nanyway we're just going to write\nsomething crappy but you're going to sit\nthere until you start writing put words\non a page\nand if it's wrong we can fix it later\nbecause here's the thing that i want you\nall to understand is you do this process\nas you sit and really pay attention to\nyour mind what you'll notice is that\nyour mind is incredibly slippery\nand it'll come up\nwith whatever excuse it can\nto keep you from doing what it doesn't\nwant to do\nand your mind knows it's a waiting game\nbecause if it can stall if it can stall\nif it can stall you'll become frustrated\nyou'll give up on the day you'll be able\nto take a loss you'll practice some\nself-forgiveness oh no it's okay it's\nokay baby it's okay beta\noh it's okay you tried so hard today\nyou tried for four hours to write so now\nthat you tried so hard and you failed\nnow we can go play league of legends for\nthe next 10 hours\nit'll come up with all kinds of things\noh we need to we're not ready to start\nwe need to do more research\njust notice\nwhat what you need to do in this like\nthis like a meditation technique as you\nsit and you close your eyes\nnotice how\nit will twist and turn and give you as\nmuch\nstuff as it can\nbut there's always going to be one\nconclusion\ndon't write\nall roads lead to one place\ndon't write\nand once you see that\nyou'll begin to realize it's all bs\nit's all bs\nand then you sit down\nand you start writing\nif your brain is like i'm not ready yet\nokay then we're going to sit here until\nyou are\nwe're not going to be but we'll like\nwe're going to waste the whole day\nlet's do it\nthis needs to get done\nno but we can be so much more productive\nif we do this other stuff\nthat actually doesn't fix the problem\nthis article needs to be written\nso you have to be able to like the whole\npoint is that the mind tricks you\nlike people will waste their entire\nlives\nbecause of the trickery of the mind the\nmind tells you not today not today not\nnow not now\nwe'll do it tomorrow here all the\nthousand reasons you're not ready yet\nyou could fail it may not be good enough\nnot today not today day goes by i've\nbeen there i literally saw it happen in\nmy life year after year it started\naround that age i was 15\nstraight up almost failed out of college\nwas on academic probation my freshman\nyear and still my mind was like not\ntoday not today year went by a second\nyear went by a third year went by it\ncould play this game all day long\nand why because it knew that it was in a\ngame of chicken with me\nand i would give in\nbecause i was not willing to waste a\nwhole day and in that i almost wasted my\nentire life\nif i'm not going to get any work done i\nmight as well have fun\ni was not willing to waste a day\nand when you're willing to waste a day\nthen your mind will start to listen\nyou're like we're gonna sit here until\nwe do it\nbut what about this\nthat's okay\nyou're gonna waste the day okay\ni'll waste as many days as i need to to\nget this done\nand once your mind understands that it's\ngoing to get in the line\ndoes that make sense\nholding yourself hostage you're not\nholding yourself hostage good point in\nits you're holding your mind hostage\nhere's the tricky thing\nin your mind there's a set of bars\nthere's a cell\none of y'all is on the inside one of\ny'all is on the outside the self is on\nthe inside or the mind is on the inside\nyou get to decide\nright now it's holding you hostage\nyoshio is asking a good question why do\nyou consider the mind and the self two\ndifferent entities because of experience\nso if you close your eyes\nyou will be able to observe the actions\nof the mind\nso do i consider myself different from\nmy hand\nis this hand me well sort of\ni'm me even if something happened to my\nhand let's say there was a terrible\naccident and i lost my hand that would\nbe awful but i wouldn't stop being me\nthe mind is a part\nof your being but it's just a part\nand as we start to like peel back the\nlayers of the self what we end up with\nis like there's like a pure self in\nthere\nthat is actually not the mind at all\nand once you meditate you'll be able to\nrealize this\nbecause once you experience existence\nwithout mental activity\nthen you'll understand what the self\ntruly is\nis the self your consciousness basically\nyes\nthat's one way to put it\nis the mind a separate con conception of\nthe brain no well\na separate conception of the brain the\nmind is not the brain\nright so the brain is a physical organ\nthe mind is not a physical organ\nso adhd is not real no adhd is\ndefinitely real\nwhy would you conclude that adhd is not\nreal from this\nwe're not saying the mind is false we're\njust saying it's not the self we're not\nsaying that your brain is incre doesn't\nexist\nninja first class is asking if you lost\nyour brain are you you that's a\nfantastic question\ni don't know the answer\nright so that's\nit i still think you will be you\nso this is where i haven't had let me\nthink about this\nyeah i i think you would still be you\nwithout your brain\nthere are absolutely severe brain\ninjuries where people will change\npersonalities drastically so we're not\nsaying that the mind is completely\nindependent of the brain but they are\ndifferent\nright so we know for example that like\njust like in in what we just explained\ntoday we talked about the correlation\nthe neuroscientific correlation between\nsome of these mental functions and\ndirecting the mind versus the self and\nthe frontal lobes we can even map some\nof those mental functions to particular\nparts of the brain\nnow a biological reductionist\nwill posit that all of the mind is a\nmanifestation of the brain\ni think that that's sort of true but\nalso incomplete\nbecause i think that\nin the way that there's like matter and\nenergy right the experience of\nconsciousness\nis different from physical form\nso like the experience of taste or\npleasure may be mapped onto the brain\nbut there's a difference between a\nphysical object and an experience\nfrom like what's it called a\ni'm not good at philosophy but\na\nquali\nthere's like some\nthere's some philosophical term for this\nqualia\nright so the qualia of substance and the\nqualia of experience to me feel\nfundamentally different so i agree with\nthat philosophical branch and that too\nis based on kind of experience there's\nlike a different stuff\nto like\nyou know touching something and like\nexperiencing something\nanyway\ngreat great conversation i mean like\nsome of the stuff gets into like the\nfill philosophy spirituality call it\nwhatever you want to at the end of the\nday though\nwhat we're talking about is how to get\nyour mind to focus\nand if you guys want a lot of different\nmethods there are all kinds of stuff\nthat does help so cleaning your room for\nexample does help because of top-down\nand bottom-up processing in the brain\nthere's a bunch of different stuff if\nyou guys are interested in that that's\nthe guide that we're working on so we're\nreally struggling for a while to figure\nout okay what should we do next and what\ni realized is what our community needs\nmore than anything else is like how do\nyou do stuff\nlike how do i do stuff\nit's such a simple question but it's\nsomething that we struggle with so much\nso we made dr k's guide to adhd and\ndoing stuff\nit's like how does stuff get done like\nwhat are the different components\nneuroscience psychology spirituality\nthat involve doing stuff\nso today we sort of got a\na how can i say this a slice of the\nprocess of doing stuff on a very\nfundamental level\nof like\nhow does the mind work and like why does\nit trick you and like what is what\ntechniques does it use to trick you but\nthere's a lot of other stuff too there\nis neuroscience there's even clinical\nmedicine right when it relates to adhd\nand then there's sort of like this yogic\nperspective on like how do you control\nyour attention\nwhy did we combine adhd with doing stuff\nbecause ultimately doing stuff is about\ncontrolling your attention\nso when i sit down and i try to study\nand i can't what does that technically\nmean\nwhen i can't study what that means is\nthat i\nmy attention is not going where i tell\nit to go\ni sit down and i try to study and my\nattention goes elsewhere\ni can't stop playing video games let's\nthink about that why can't you stop\nplaying video games because my attention\nis constantly on them i think about them\nand the only time i feel at peace is\nwhen my attention is stuck in the video\ngame\nso it all comes down to attention\nand this is where people will say weak\nwillpower willpower is a piece of it but\ni think willpower is actually a\nit's an unsophisticated term\nso this is something that we go into so\nthere's all kinds of neuroscientific\ncalculations that are going on\nthat when those calculations are not\nproceeding properly it looks like quote\nunquote weak willpower\nthe interesting thing is that you can\nactually manipulate those calculations\nto\ncreate more motivation which looks like\nwillpower but the interesting thing is\nit's not it's not that the person has\nincreased their willpower they've\nactually increased their motivation\nand remember when you're motivated you\ndon't need willpower\nwillpower is what you use to overcome\nmotivation\nand so you may be asking what do you\nmean there's some calculations i'll give\nyou just a really simple thing\nso we have this video on something\ncalled the action success\ncalculation where your brain\nconstantly and there's studies on this\nso there's something we understand very\nwell\nconstantly decides what to do and it\nintegrates all kinds of information\none of the key parts of that action\nsuccess calculation one of the key parts\nof figuring out whether to motivate you\nor not is actually the success\nlikelihood of a task\nso if i think i can succeed at something\ni'm going to be more motivated to do it\nif i don't think i can succeed i'm going\nto be less motivated\nwho here\nthinks it would be cool\nto\nown a yacht\nwho here is motivated to build a yacht\nwell why don't if you want a yacht why\ndon't you build one because i don't\nthink i would be successful right\nthere's like zero motivation for\nbuilding yachts even though we all want\nyachts\nso that's like an extreme example that's\nso extreme that it almost doesn't make\nsense\nbut basically like even if you look at\nlike studies of people who will ask\nother people out what you tend to find\nis that you're more likely to ask\nsomeone out if you think they're within\nyour league\nwhat does that mean that means that the\naction success calculation is telling\nyou hey go ahead and ask this person out\nbecause we have a decent chance of being\nsuccessful\nnow how do you manipulate\nthat calculation to create motivation\nvery simple\nself-worth\nis a huge part of that calculation\nso this is why we see this in coaching\nwhere people will come into coaching and\nthey'll say i'm not motivated\nand what we'll do is we'll work on their\nahamkar their ego their sense of self\nwe'll work on their confidence\nand then seven weeks later they're doing\nstuff\nthey're like yeah i did it\nand then the coach is actually really\nconfused they're like\nthey don't say to their client but then\nthey'll come into case review and\nthey'll talk to me about it they'll be\nlike i'm really confused i thought this\nperson this person we've been talking\nabout this for seven weeks they haven't\ndone anything for seven weeks and then\nsuddenly they wake up one day and\nthey're like doing stuff\nand it all goes down to these different\nkinds of like neuroscientific techniques\nso when someone becomes more confident\nin themselves it alters their perception\nof the chance of success as it alters\nyour perception of your chance of\nsuccess in our dating example this\nbecomes very simple if i have low\nself-worth\ni think i'm in a low league i'm in the\namateur league and once i work on my\nself-worth i realize oh i'm confident\ni'm actually like a valuable human being\nwho can offer something in a\nrelationship and then suddenly i'm able\nto actually ask out people that i'm\nattracted to\ninstead of asking out people that i\nthink i can end up with who are willing\nto accept me and it revolutionizes the\nway that you live your life\nand it all comes down to neuroscience\nthere are literally basic science\nstudies\non schizophrenia and motivation\nthat once you look at all of these like\nend psychological studies about dating\nand relationship recession and then you\ncombine them with like brain scans of\npeople with schizophrenia you can map\nout how the system works\nonce you map out everything from\nneuroscience to psychology\nyou also get an understanding of like\nhow the equation is written and once you\nunderstand how the equation is written\nthen you can start to alter certain\nvariables and then you can almost like\ncalculate motivation\nyou"
