    "transcript": "and so for those of y'all that are in\nour community and doing okay you've\nstill got a lot of work ahead of you i\ndon't mean that to\nthe thing is the work is fun it's\nfantastic it's so rewarding\nbut\nthere's a lot\nall right so is it okay to use\ntechnology in media as a safety net\ncoping mechanism\nhi dr k i was recently listening to your\ndiscussion about improving sleep and you\nmentioned that as we humans as humans we\ntend not to give ourselves enough time\nto mentally process our thoughts\nand that we usually will use\ndistractions such as gaming social media\ntwitch youtube to repress certain\nthoughts i'm someone who does this\nalmost all the time and i want to know\nhow i can break away from this mindset\nand allow myself to be able to sit with\nand process my thoughts\na bit of information about me i'm a 24\nyear old man currently living at home on\na small island in the uk after\ncompleting unity degree and working the\noffice for a year i now only work three\ndays a week for a couple hours doing\ntakeout deliveries with the rest of my\nweek being free time i've struggled a\nlot with anxiety in the past having had\nmultiple panic attacks with the last\ncouple of months developed into\ngeneralized anxiety disorder\nmy anxiety mainly revolves around\nthanatophobia and worrying about\ninevitable events in the future such as\nloss\ni find it difficult to stay within the\nmoment with my thoughts and not get\nscared especially when i'm by myself\nwithout distractions\ni've recently started cbt therapy and\nhave a good support network around with\nfamily and friends awesome i'm able to\ndo normal things such as eat properly go\nto the gym and socialize double awesome\ni also don't smoke or do drugs and i\nrarely drink triple awesome\nbecause but because of my anxiety i'm\nonly able to stay mentally strong in\nthese situations when i have some kind\nof distraction\nthis usually comes in the form of having\nmy phone close by and being able to\ncheck social media or watch twitch or\nyoutube videos or just distracting\nmyself\nby having a task to do\neven when trying to fall asleep i'm only\nable to fall asleep if i have a video or\nstream on in the background\ni've tried limiting screen time and\nmaking sure i spend a lot of time\noutdoors but even when the gym driving\nstores etc i feel like the need to\nlisten or watch videos and streams\ni'm planning to go to japan for a year\nin september on a working holiday and i\nhope this will help me as i will be a\nlot busier and be able to distract\nmyself more naturally\nbut i'm still worried about\nthat in my downtime i will feel scared\nand lonely\nif i'm not connected with other people\nin some kind of way the question i want\nto ask is is this a healthy way coping\nmechanism to deal with anxiety and what\nare some techniques alternatives that\nsomeone can use to be able to stay calm\nby themselves and be able to process\ntheir thoughts without worrying and the\nneed to feel connected to stay calm\num\nthank you if you're if you take your\ntime to read this i'm a longtime lurker\nand i listen to a lot of content on\nspotify while working\nand it has really helped me improve my\nview on certain aspects of\nlife okay\nso this is interesting because\nsometimes\nwe do a lot of stuff right\nwe go to therapy\nwe're careful about substances\nwe exercise we socialize we've got\nfriends and support groups\nbut we still kind of feel anxious\nwe still sort of struggle to get away\nfrom\ntechnology and we're not really sure\nright because like if my life ain't\nfalling apart\nis it okay to use technology\nand how do we know how much of it is\nokay\nbecause a lot of times when we talk\nabout things like technology and social\nmedia were like we got our pitchforks\nand we're like no bad stop playing video\ngames stop doing this stop it so bad and\ntoxic toxic toxic\nand then we also have this sort of idea\nof someone who's like addicted right\nit's like living at home doesn't leave\ntheir four walls and stuff like that\nright and sometimes we'll even talk to\nour community as if all of y'all are\nlike that but the truth of the matter is\nthat most people within the hg community\nare kind of like this person\nsome stuff they're doing really well\nsome stuff they're working on\nso how do you know\nif i'm not like a degenerate technology\nuser\nright\nlike how do i know what's a healthy way\nto manage my anxiety with technology\nand what's kind of like unhealthy\nso a couple of different principles that\nwe can sort of look at\nthe first thing that we've sort of\ntalked about in the past before is that\ngenerally speaking if it causes a\nproblem it is a problem so the first\nthreshold to understand so i'll get\nparents who will ask me okay how do i\nknow if my kid is addicted to video\ngames and my answer is pretty simple if\nyou look at all of the diagnostic\ncriteria for\ndisorders psychiatric diagnoses that\nrelate to addiction\nthe most common element is impairment of\nfunction\nso how do you know if you've got a\ndrinking problem well if it causes a\nproblem it is a problem\nso if your alcohol is affecting your\nphysical health if your alcohol is\naffecting your mental health if your\nalcohol is affecting your professional\nwork if it's affecting your academic\nwork if it's affecting your\nrelationships\ni.e if someone is threatening divorce\nbecause you drink\nthen it is a problem\nso that's when we sort of diagnose\nsomething as a disorder\nbut\nbeyond that there's a whole range of\nhealthy norms\nor unhealthy norms even\nand so what we started we what we really\nstart to got to do is understand\nhow do i know whether this technology is\na problem or not and more importantly\nthere are some things i've noticed in my\nlife around technology and like how do i\nstop doing those\nso what i'd love to do today is help you\nall navigate this question of even if\ni'm doing pretty okay\nand my life is not falling apart is it\nokay to use technology and like how do i\nstart to distance myself from it\nand in doing so what we're gonna do is\ngo through a couple of really really\nbasic\num\nprinciples of addiction\nthat even matter when people aren't\naddicted so this is some basic stuff\nabout the brain and how our brain sort\nof does behavioral reinforcement so that\nwe can understand how to change our\nbehavior if we want to spend a little\nbit less time with technology okay\nwhat we're going to start with\nis this\nokay\nso i'm able to do normal things such as\neat properly go to the gym and socialize\ni also don't smoke etc\nbut because of my anxiety i am only able\nto stay mentally strong in these\nsituations when i have some kind of\ndistraction\nso this is actually the wrong way to\nthink about it and we'll explain a\nlittle bit\nso what we're going to do by the way\nif you all want to learn about\nneurobiology of addiction\nnora\nvolkow is\nbrilliant\nthe best researcher that i have\nencountered in terms of the neurobiology\nof addiction\nand what we're going to do is look at a\ncouple of interesting principles here\nso\nlet me try to find this\nyeah okay\nduring the so there's a lot of stuff\nthat we sort of know about the\npreoccupation or anticipation stage and\nstuff that we know about cravings from\naddiction so we're going to talk about\nthis for a second\nso if so these are the three things that\nwe kind of need to focus on if you're\ntrying to\nfigure out first of all whether\ntechnology and social media use is a\nsafe\nthing to do or whether it's causing\nproblems\nand how to use it less\neven if you aren't necessarily addicted\nto it\nokay\nso the first thing is to understand the\nprocess of what it does for you\nso\nwhen i feel anxiety\nin a particular situation\nand i turn to a device\nwhat does that do to my anxiety\nin the moment and in the future let's\nstart by answering these two questions\nwhat does it do to my anxiety in the\nmoment\nnumbs it excellent\nwhat does it do to my anxiety in the\nfuture\nwhat do y'all think\ngets worse compounds\nat best it stays about the same\nso there's something important to\nunderstand here\nif you are in a social situation so now\ni'm going to ask y'all very good\ngood job so here's the more advanced\nquestion\nif i'm in a social\nsituation so what a lot of people will\ndo actually let me take a step back\nonce they realize this they're like oh\nso if i distract myself from my anxiety\nit's not actually going to get better\nokay\nso therefore what i need to do\nis stop distracting myself and muscle\nthrough the anxiety\nso if i go to a social situation and i\nresist the the impulse to use the phone\nand i resist the impulse to use the\nphone and i resist the impulse to use\nthe phone\nand my anxiety rises and rises and rises\nand then i crack\nand i use the phone what does that do to\nmy ability to resist the anxiety down\nthe road\ndid i level up some\nwhat do you all think\nso if i resist my phone for the first 15\nminutes\nand then i give in\nso some people are saying\nit weakens it some people are saying it\nimproves things some people are saying\nit's staying the same so this is where\nit gets a little complicated but let me\ngive you all another example\nso let's say that my my kid walks in and\nthe kid says daddy can i please have\nwatch something on can i have some\nscreen time\nand if i say no\nand then they start crying and then i\nsay no and then they throw a temper\ntantrum and i give in\nwhat does that do for their\nwhat kind of behavior does that shape\nfor them next time around\nwhat is the child more likely to do\nwhat have i reinforced i've reinforced\nthe tantrum so this is what's so\ndevastating for a lot of parents\nis their kid gets out of control\nand they give in and then they come to\nme and they're like the more i try to\nfix this problem the worse it gets\ni've tried everything and nothing works\nand they're getting worse and worse and\nworse\nit's because the more that you try to do\nthings the more that what you're\nreinforcing for your kid is the only way\ni'm going to get this is temper tantrum\nbecause we're trying this other bs stuff\nfor a little while that's not working\nthat's not and what is the one message\nthe kid gets every time you try\naromatherapy or listening to this kind\nof music or we're going to meditate or\nwe're going to do this\nall this crap doesn't seem to work but\nwhat is the one thing you're reinforcing\nthroughout all that which is temper\ntantrum gets you the game\nso interestingly enough\nresisting cravings\nand then giving in can sometimes teach\nour brain\nthat if i really want this thing i just\nneed to hit him with a level 10 craving\nlevel one craving won't do it level two\ncraving won't do it little three craving\none two i'm just gonna slam this person\nwith this craving that's so hard because\nthat's what gets it to me\nand we sort of see this in people who\nstruggle to be sober\nis that the cravings seem to be getting\nworse and worse and worse over time the\nmore that they fight them\nyou all get this\nso even when it comes to staying strong\nin a social situation the only way i can\nmanage my anxiety in a social situation\nthe only way i can stay strong\nwhich is the phrasing that this person\nused\ni'm only able to mentally stay strong in\nthese situations when i have some kind\nof distraction\nthis is not staying strong my friend\nis actually breeding weakness\ni i don't mean that i mean i realized\nthat was a mean thing to say but like\nreally\nwhat you're doing is you're reinforcing\nthe craving and the usage of the thing\nnow this isn't your fault\nit's how our brain is designed so you're\nnot doing anything wrong in a sense like\nyou can't be expected to to know\nright i'm sorry that came off as harsher\nbut that's the truth you're not actually\nmentally staying strong because you're\nusing the thing to keep you strong\nit's artificial\nright so this is like addiction craving\nbehavioral reinforcement super basic\nstuff\nif you give in to the phone the phone is\nwhat you will be giving into more and\nmore and more and more\nso the first thing is decide ahead of\ntime\neither give in to your phone right away\ndon't even try to resist it\nit's okay to sometimes resist it i mean\nsorry not even resist it at all just\ngive in to it completely oddly enough\nthat's the right way to\nset up healthy technology habits with\nkids\ndad can i please have the ipad\nabsolutely\njust take it\ndad can i have the\nipad no\nyou don't want to say no all the time\nbut if there's a no it's a no and it\nain't gonna become a yes no matter what\nhappens and since you can't fight all\nthe time it's actually healthier to say\nyes five times and no once\nas opposed to struggle to say no every\nsingle time and then cave into a yes\ndoes that make\nsense you'll get that\nyou can try to spend your energy\nand lose six battles\nor you can give up five of those battles\nand win one\ndo y'all get that\nso i can try to fight with my kid about\nthe screen and i can fight again and\nthen they'd throw a temper champion and\ngive in then i fight the next time they\nthey throw a temper tantrum and they\ngive it instead it's actually better to\nsay yeah you can go ahead and have it\nbut with the one time that i say no no\namount of temper tantrums is gonna work\nand i may not have the energy to do that\nevery single time that's the key thing\nthat's why i have to take a couple of\nl's to get a couple of w's\nwhen it comes to your social media usage\nin social situations or phone usage\nthat's where you've got to decide before\nyou walk in the door is today a day that\ni'm going to absolutely be off my phone\nor is it today going to be a day where\ni'm allowed to use my phone and you\ndecide ahead of time you don't have to\nbeat yourself up this is where there's a\nparty that'll say every time i'm going\nto never use my phone again\nand then you get into this situation\nwhere you're gonna lose all those\nbattles because you're devote you're\nspreading out your willpower amongst\neach of these things\nso you have to let yourself use the\nphone\nand\ndon't let yourself use the phone at\nparticular times just be very clear\nabout it ahead of time you can alter\nthat reinforcement circuitry in your\nmind\nso today is a day that i'm going to be\ntechnology free\nit's going to be tough\nthat's principle number one\nso don't give in to the craving\nthat's the worst thing the\nthing is you can satisfy it right away\nbefore even a craving even happens\nor resist the craving to the bitter end\nbut don't give in to a craving\nespecially as it ramps up\nokay that's issue number one\nissue number two\num\neven when i'm at in the gym stores\ndriving etc i feel the need to listen to\npodcasts or watch videos and streams\nso second thing that our good friend\nvolkow discovered\nis that there are six discrete\nneuroscientific deficits and people who\nhave addictions\none of those deficits\nis\na lack of awareness of your internal\nstate\nso here's how to understand this\nif you talk to people who relapse\nyou ask them how did you relapse and\nthey're like i don't know what happened\ni was doing great until\ni lost it\nso as people have studied the brains of\npeople who struggle with relapse what we\nsort of discover and you can do this\nlike when you do therapy with someone\nwhat you actually discover is\nyou weren't fine for the month\nbeforehand\nactually there was tiny insult after\ntiny insult after tiny stress after tiny\nstress after tiny stress and this thing\nhappened and this thing happened and\nthis thing happened and then your\nemotions got to be too much for you\nand then\nyou\nuse the only coping mechanism that you\ncould in that moment\nbut what there actually is is a\nblindness\nto your internal emotional state when\nyou struggle with addictions\nand so their experience of it is i was\ndoing fine and then it happened\nwhich is not oftentimes how it is\nit's actually there's a bunch of stuff\nthat's going on it's just it's all like\nbe under the surface\nand so i don't see it happening and so\nthis is really really important if you\never want to alter your behavior you\nhave to understand i still feel the need\nthen the question is what is the need\nso you have to tunnel down further into\nawareness of the self\nso if you want to overcome the behavior\nyou have to know okay what is this need\nwhat am i feeling in this moment why do\ni need to listen to a podcast\nright and here's like like why do i have\nto listen to a stream right now like\nwhat's going on what would happen if i\ndidn't do that how would i feel what\nwould i think\nand that's where you'll discover all\nkinds of things jumbled together\nso\nlet's just pick two\none thing you'll discover is that unless\nyour mind is distracted especially if\nyou have a diagnosed anxiety disorder\nthat the more you're distracted the less\nspace the anxiety has to come into your\nmind\nso if you lay a awake at night in bed\nwithout any kind of distraction all\nkinds of dark thoughts will come up\nthat's why when i was struggling with\naddiction\ni couldn't go to bed unless i passed out\nthe second i hit the pillow\nthe most painful part of my day was\ntrying to go to sleep\nbecause first of all i couldn't fall\nasleep and secondly\nthat experience of not being able to\nfall asleep was such\nmentally awful like it was like torture\nfor hours\nthe worst part of my day all of the ways\nthat i was screwing up my life came\nbubbling up\nand i had no no defense\nno distraction no shield\nso you may discover that all your\nanxious thoughts come up\nbut\nif you really pay attention you'll\ndiscover all kinds of other things\nlike\nlet's be productive\nlike oh like if i'm listening to a\npodcast while i'm falling asleep then i\nwill learn something and learning things\nis good and i will be making progress in\nlife and it won't be\nyou know i'll be using my time\nproductively because it's important for\nme to be productive\nand if i feel productive\nthen i won't feel so much like a failure\nand so let me go on doing this\nproductive productive productive stuff\nwhich by the way isn't\nmay not actually move your life forward\nso you're going to discover all kinds of\nother stuff in there\nthat's not just\ndistraction from anxiety\ni have to use my time wisely so that's\nsomething also that i went through i was\nlike listening to audio books about\ndevelopment all the time\nand then i was like wait why am i doing\nthis\nwhat what is this actually\ni'd become a self-help junkie\nyou all heard this term self-help junkie\nthey're still junkies\njust addicted to something else\nright so you may discover like some\namount of like oh i need to feel\nproductive\nbecause the more productive i feel i'll\nfeel better about myself i'm learning\nsomething i'm growing here in my garage\ni read 300 books a day or whatever\nright there's this idea that like if\nwe're productive\nlike\nhustle culture like i gotta be like\nyou know i saw some video where someone\nwas like cooking is the worst roi\ninvestment that you can have in your\nlife which is like i guess technically\ntrue\nyou know i wonder this is like i never\ncook at home it's like\nyou know the only thing that may be\nequally bad roi is pooping i guess\nso do you you outsource that too\nso there's this idea that like knowledge\nis like growth in some way and we sort\nof give in to some of these feelings\nthat are positive in nature right i want\nto feel good about myself\nthe key thing though is that you have to\nhave awareness as to what's driving the\nbehavior\nand as we develop this in a clinical\nsetting it helps people overcome\naddictions as we understand it about\nourselves we will understand where that\nneed comes from and we'll be able to\nhopefully address the need at its root\nand therefore get rid of the you know\nthe the leaves and the stem and the\nfruit\nyou know we'll get rid of that term that\nbehavior at the end of the road by sort\nof addressing the root need down below\nand at a minimum we'll raise awareness\nof it and awareness precedes control\nso that's something that's in ancient\nyoga we've understood for a while which\nall you have to do is ever go get dental\nwork and you'll understand that when\nyou're numb\nyou can't control anything\nno no no no no no\nright that's that's how because you\ncan't feel anything so you can't control\nanything\nif you're like me and you chain lose\ngames of dota it's probably because\nyou're not aware of what's happening\nand once i have awareness oh like maybe\nas a support i should actually buy\nsupport items\nmaybe keeping my carry alive who's got a\ndamage item is better than me having a\ndamage item\nso you have to be aware that's number\ntwo\nthere are actually neuroscientific\ndeficits in people in terms of awareness\nof internal emotional states when it\ncomes to addictions\nthird thing\nis\nbut i am still worried that in my\ndowntime i will feel scared and lonely\nthe way we lose control of our lives\nis by trying to protect ourselves or\navoid negative emotion\nthe quickest way to lose control of your\nlife is to try to craft a life with\nno negative emotion\nso when i start to live my life in a way\nto avoid anxiety avoid fear and avoid\nsadness what does that result in\nwhat does my life become\nhow do i stop feeling anxious\ndon't go to the party easy\nhow do i stop\nhow do i avoid sadness how can i never\nbe sad\nwell you can't ever be sad if you\nif getting dumped makes you sad the only\nway to never be sad is to never enter a\nrelationship\nso this is something that like we need\nto understand as a society\nwhat's happening in our society is we\nare valuing positive emotion over\nnegative emotion and what we try to do\nis cultivate positive emotion positive\nemotion positive emotion and try to get\nthe hell away from negative emotion\nnegative emotion negative motion first\nthing that does that is a drug of abuse\nwe're going to take that frown we're\ngoing to flip it upside down let's get\nus some artificial euphoria\nbut then what really starts to happen is\nwhen we\nare no longer able to\nexperience accept or even embrace\nnegative emotions\nit cuts off slices of our life\nthings become no longer possible\nbecause this person is doing actually\npretty well huge respect for them by the\nway\nthey're still going to japan\nand they recognize they're opening\nthemselves up to that experience whereas\nif\nthis negative emotion was stronger they\nwere giving into it more they wouldn't\neven go to japan in the first place\nbecause there are people out there i'm\nsure who are listening to this right now\nthat have things that they do they want\nto do but they don't do them because\nthey're afraid of what could happen\ni want to go to japan but i'll be lonely\nfor a year what if i don't meet anyone\nso i'm not going to go\nso if your life is moving in the wrong\ndirection\nthere's a really good chance that it's\nthrough the avoidance of negative\nemotion\nand building a life that you want to\ninvolves accepting and embracing that\nexperience\ni'm gonna tell y'all a story\nso the first night\ni was on call i'd finished medical\nschool i was a newly minted medical\ndoctor\ni started on something called night\nfloat\nso there are doctors that work at the\nhospital during the day and when the\ndoctors are done working because they're\nnot usually there 24 hours right they\nhave to go home and the second team of\ndoctors comes in and takes care of the\npatients overnight\nso usually most of the people are\nsleeping and they're all the medications\nand stuff all being changed so night\nfloat you know during the day you may\ncover like 12 or 15 patients at night\nyou'll cover like 60 because most of\nthem are kind of what we call tucked\naway\nsome things you have to they're like\nokay like this person had\nyou know an asthma attack at 7 pm so\nmake sure you check their you know o2\nyour their oxygen level at midnight so\nsome stuff that you have to do but\ngenerally speaking most people are like\ndoing okay\nso\ni got a page\npage said rapid response room whatever\nrapid response is something that's right\nbelow what a code is so code for those\nof you you know when you see a medical\nshow and they've got the paddles they're\nlike clear that's a code that's when\nsomeone's actively dying before that\nthere's this thing called a rapid\nresponse which is when someone's in\ndistress but it's not like an all hands\non back situation so rapid response got\ncalled\nin a particular room i go into the room\nsomeone is having a seizure this is my\nfirst day mind you as a medical doctor\nworking in a hospital where i am\nresponsible for this person so i get the\npage because the nurse is like paige the\ndoctor this patient is having a seizure\ni run into the room i remember was like\ntwo or three doors down from where i was\nso it was very easy i was there within\n15 seconds\na few seconds later\nso i asked the nurse i'm like okay who's\nthis patient what's going on with them\nthey started seizing about\nyou know 15 30 seconds ago like okay\ncool seizures started then okay like\nwhat's going on with their medical\nhistory\nso about 30 seconds later my senior\nresident comes in the second year\nresident this person has been a doctor\nfor\n366 days and i've been a doctor for one\nday he comes in he stands up so the\npatient is seizing i'm on one side he's\non the other side\nof the bed\nhe stands there with his arms crossed\nand so immediately like what do i do i\nwas like okay like thank god he's here\nand i start telling him this is the\npatient he started seizing at this point\npatients started seizing in there on\nthis medications there's like this and\nhe's like\nhe looks at me nods and he's like okay\nand i'm like\ndan\nwhat are we gonna do\npatient is ceasing what are we gonna do\nand he's like yeah\nlooks like the patient's seizing what\nshould you do\nhe's like i don't know\ngive him out of hand\nhe's like okay how do you want to get\nmad event i don't know iv the patient\nsees it you can't take a medication by\nmouth it's like okay so iv adivan how\nmuch do you want to give i'm like i\ndon't know like one milligram two\nmilligrams this like sounds good to me\nand i was like okay two two milligram iv\nout of an push now\nit's like sounds good\npatient gets the ativan seizure stops\ni'm terrified i'm like wait wait what's\ngoing on\nso at that moment in time i've got a\nchoice\ndo i want to come back tomorrow because\nthis is what i'm in for\ndan\nbrilliant doctor amazing teacher made me\npart of the person that i am today\nlet me swim in those\nterrifying waters first day\nhe knew what he was doing right so he's\nnot going to let me make a mistake but\nlike the instinct as a medical student\nis like oh the doctor's here\nright like let him like oh thank god the\nsenior is here like ah off my plate i\ndon't have to deal with it dan's like\nuh-uh\ndan seriously brilliant doctor\nfantastic person\nand so you've got a choice in life\nof like\nwhat you do the next day\nbecause i can never be in that situation\nagain\ni can do it\nright i convey hey you know what\nthis ain't for me\nshould have become a monk\nscrew this whole medical thing i'm gonna\ngo sit in the cave in the homeless and\nlike that's what i'm gonna do\ni don't ever have to be in this\nsituation again if i don't want to\nthe question is are you gonna let\nyour negative emotions shape your life\nbecause there are situations that you\ncan put yourself in in which you will\nfeel fear anxiety loneliness\nand you can put yourself not in those\nsituations\nin the moment that we start letting our\nnegative emotions control what we do\nand that's where when you're\nexperiencing the negative emotion in the\nmoment sometimes you can't control it\nwhich is okay the moment we let the\nanticipation\nof the negative emotion restrict what we\nput ourselves in\nthat's when you lose control of your\nlife\nso we started this talk\nabout what about a technology usage is\nokay\nright so may not even be an addiction\nwhich is totally fine because actually\nthe majority of people who struggle with\ntechnology right now i don't know if\nthey're clinically addicted or not like\nit doesn't seem like it right everyone's\nstruggling with this\nso how do you manage this the first\nis to understand cravings and behavioral\nreinforcement\nand that resisting the impulse for a\ntime and then giving in\nactually reinforces the strength of the\ncraving\njust like if a kid throws a temper\ntantrum and then i give them the ipad\nwhat the kid is going to learn over time\nis i need to throw a temper tantrum to\nget what i want and paradoxically i give\nhim the ipad to stop the temper tantrum\nand what i do is sign myself up for a\ntemper tantrum the next day\nso my at my ability to try to control\nthe craving actually exacerbates the\ncraving very important principle from\naddiction\nabsolutely applicable here\nso decide ahead of time like\ndo i get my crutch today or do i have to\nwalk by the myself is it a training\nwheels day or is it walking by myself\nwhen i go into the ocean am i going to\nhave floaties or am i going to go into\nthe ocean and need to swim on my own\nright because having swim floaties in\nthe ocean doesn't teach you how to swim\ndoes the opposite\nnow see there's a graduated level right\nyou don't want to jump straight into the\nocean without a floatie if you don't\nknow how to swim but\nit's an analogy\nso be careful what you're reinforcing in\nterms of craving cravings and giving\ninto those feelings\nsecond thing is awareness\nright so we know that people who\nstruggle with addictions and this may be\nthis may be by virtue of the fact that\noftentimes social media technology and\nthings like that suppress our emotional\ncircuits which is how they numb us out\nbut then what happens is we have these\nneeds and feelings and stuff like that\nwhen we give in to those but we don't\nreally understand what they are where\nthey come from\nbut if we really want to get rid of the\nbehavior we have to address the\nunderlying\nstuff we have to address the root of the\nproblem which is i just i feel like i\nneed to be on my phone right now\nokay\nwait what is that is that like hunger or\nthirst\nyou need to eat you need to drink water\nyou may need to use the restroom you may\nneed to sleep\nthere is not a need there's not a\nphysiologic need\nto browse twitter\nit's not a need\nthere may be some kind of emotional\ndrive right we could even call it a need\nyou can use that term so understand what\nthat is like what are we satisfying here\nwhat are we getting away from what are\nwe doing\nand especially for some of this like you\nknow\npodcasts the podcast junkie\nit may not be something as simple as\nokay i'm using this technology to\nsuppress my numbness\nit may be actually deeper than that that\nright now i'm not as successful as i\nwant to be\nand every time i listen to a podcast\nthere's a part of my mind that believes\nthat i'm moving in the right direction\nand it's really important for me at this\npoint in my life\nto feel like i'm moving in the right\ndirection\nstill\nwhether you you listen to the podcast or\nnot is actually separate from in this\npoint\nthis point is about wow it's like that's\na really important thing to understand\nabout yourself\nbecause then the the conversation then\nbecomes okay if if i really need to be\nmoving forward in life what can i\nseriously do because the other thing\nthat happens when we satisfy that need\nwith a podcast we don't satisfy it in\nother ways and then we stay stuck at\nhome listening to podcasts out all day\nwithout actually changing our lives\nwhat am i actually gonna do to fix that\nneed\nbecause podcasts ain't cutting it\nso there's all kinds of stuff that you\ncan discover once you look within\nthe last thing to consider\nis in general\nwhat is the relationship between you and\nnegative emotion\nis it something to be avoided at all\ncosts do you try to avoid it\nyou want to conquer it you want to make\nit go away\nbecause the truth of the matter like i\nhate to break this to y'all\nbut we have like there's like literally\na part of your brain\ncalled the amygdala\nand the primary function of the amygdala\nis to\nexperience negative emotion it's the\nsurvival center of our brain too\nthe primary function is to survive\nhelp you survive but the way that it\ndoes that it makes negative emotions in\nyour head\nlike our brain has dedicated machinery\nthat makes you feel anxious and scared\nwhy\nit's because it's a part of life it's\nactually advantageous otherwise it\nwouldn't be there\nso once you stop\navoiding situations that have negative\nemotion\nyou'll start to like really be in\ncontrol of your life\nwhy do you procrastinate\nso i was reading something that's kind\nof tragic about\nlooking at a bit uh crypto forum of\npeople who haven't told their spouses\nthat they've lost all of their\nsavings in crypto\nwhy do you think they don't tell them\nwhat are they afraid of\nright and what is that doing to their\nmarriage\none thing to lose all the money it's\nanother thing to not tell me\nso if you really want to be in control\nof your life stop\navoiding the negative emotion\ngo to japan there's a chance you could\nbe lonely it's not the end of the world\nbecause negative emotion too is\ntemporary\nbeautiful thing this is a revelation\nthat oftentimes we miss because we're so\nbusy avoiding it\nthat we never get to become familiar\nwith it\nthink about negative emotions it goes\naway too\nour amygdala is wired to turn off after\na while\nso if you're struggling with technology\naddiction i know it's kind of not even\naddiction if you're trying to figure out\nokay is this okay to use not use i\nrealize this conversation became a\nlittle bit bigger than that\nbut i think that\nthe better you are if you're not really\nstruggling with an addiction\nthe deeper you have to go in order to\nreally understand yourself and move\nforward that's what the path is\nright so if you have a clinical\ndiagnosis or if you're you're in the icu\nit's pretty simple what needs to be done\nbut the healthier you get\nthe more\nnuanced you have to become the more\nthoughtful you have to become the more\nyou have to understand yourself and like\nit it gets in a sense\nnot harder necessarily but like it the\nwork becomes deeper\nso someone has like a severe depression\nit's pretty simple like we need some\nkind of medication\nright and there's other stuff but that\nother stuff becomes more and more\nimportant the further you go\nthose of you all that are in our\ncommunity and doing okay\nyou've still got a lot of work ahead of\nyou i don't mean that to\nthing is the work is fun it's fantastic\nit's so rewarding\nbut\nthere's a lot\nso rzb125 is asking what about\nbeing addicted to people online i have a\nfriend who depends on a few micro\ncelebrities and dedicates all his free\ntime to them how can i help him\nso this is a story that we're hearing\nmore and more\nunfortunately that we have friends and\nsometimes even romantic partners that\nare very very\nobsessive\nhopefully i can use that word without it\nbeing\ninappropriate but\nobsessive i'm almost using it in the\nclinical sense where like obsessive\ncompulsive disorder is like\npersistent thoughts that won't go away\nso that's kind of what i mean by that\nanyway\nvery very preoccupied\nwith particular people\nthey're almost addicted\nto as you put a micro celebrity\num\nso what can you do\nso that's where the first thing to\nunderstand is that like\nyou can't cure someone of an addiction\nwithout their help\nso very practically what i would do is\nstart with open-ended non-judgmental\nquestions so if you all caught the\npre-contemplative talk earlier today\nthat's a good example so you start with\nlike challenging assumptions and asking\nquestions\nwhat do you think about how much\ntell me about these people like what do\nyou what do you think about them what do\nyou think about the amount of time that\nyou spend with them\nyou can also ask them lots of questions\nthat have nothing to do with them\nso\nhow are you doing nowadays\nhow do you feel on a day-to-day basis\neventually you can work your way up to\nlike what's the direction of your life\nand if they're unhappy with the\ndirection of your life the next question\nis\nwhat do you think is\nwhy is your life moving in the wrong\ndirection i mean you don't want to ask\nit like that that's going to be\njudgmental but\nwhat's getting in the way of\nyou building the life that you want\nhow can i help you build the life that\nyou want\nthose are the kinds of questions to ask\nnow\nthe tricky thing here is that in the\nback of your mind you may be thinking no\nno this is one problem it's the micro\ncelebrities whereas once again i think\nthis is the kind of thing where you can\nlook at the behavior but most generally\nspeaking you look at all addictions and\nthey share one thing in common which is\nthat they offer some kind of emotional\nrelief\nand that's where if you really want to\nconquer an addiction you have to deal\nwith the underlying root of the\nproblem you can do i mean that's\na piece of it\nso what does this person get\nwhen they spend time with these micro\ncelebrities\nas you put them\nwhat do they get how do they feel about\nthemselves what is that thing in them\nthat's hungry for this kind of\ninteraction\nand until you understand that and start\nto replace it in other ways like they're\ngonna stay stuck\nso it's not you can't just get sober you\nhave to have alternative coping\nmechanisms or go to do something like\ntherapy where you\ndeal with the underlying work that\ncauses you to reach for some kind of\nsubstance\ngood question but very challenging\nweird question but when things like\nmeditation also reduce anxiety why don't\nwe get addicted to them\nreally good question streamer loves me\num\nso it's because reductions of anxiety\nhappen in two ways\nthey can happen temporarily and they can\nhappen\nso you can deal with the symptom or you\ncan deal with the cause\nso one is that when we look at most\naddictive substances they don't deal\nwith the cause they don't deal with the\nroots of anxiety what they do is\nsymptomatic relief of anxiety\nso for example if you prescribe someone\na benzodiazepine class of medication\nlike xanax is a very good example that's\nnot going to cure anyone of an anxiety\ndisorder it'll help them manage the\nanxiety in the moment but it's not doing\nanything long term\nso\nsubstances or other kinds of things that\ndeal with short-term problems will\nactually reinforce that behavior right\nso if i make something numb but i don't\nactually fix it\nwhat i'm going to do is need to engage\nin the behavior over and over and over\nand over again because the problem's\nnever fixed the second the numbness\nwears off the anxiety comes right back\nand i need to re reach for the substance\nagain we explain this concept in a lot\nof detail and rebound anxiety in the\nanxiety module by the way\nthere's a whole video about it\nso how is meditation different\nso meditation is different in a couple\nof different ways\nactually before we go to meditation\nlet's look at psychotherapy\nso\nand the purpose of treating\npsychotherapy\nso psychotherapy one hour a week of\npsychotherapy doesn't\nfix someone's anxiety tomorrow when\nthey're feeling anxious\nso that's why like\nxanax if you pop his nx you're going to\nfeel a anxiety relief almost immediately\nwhereas psychotherapy we don't start to\nsee a clinical change for weeks\nso it's a completely different mechanism\nof action of reduction of anxiety\nso what you're dealing with is the root\nof the anxiety\nit's an oversimplification you can deal\nwith more than that but\nand so that's why we start to see you\nknow xanax will work in minutes\nwhereas\ntherapy will take weeks\nand then what happens is people don't\nget addicted to therapy i mean they can\nso if therapy starts to become a way\nwhere they like\noffload their emotions and they don't do\nany of the deeper work they'll be sort\nof kind of stuck in therapy and you'll\nsee that as well patients who come in\nand they basically emotionally offload\nbut then don't\nchange anything about their lives to\nprevent that emotion from building up\nagain\nright so i can come into a therapist\nappointment and i can offload some\nfrustration about my partner who doesn't\nlisten to me but unless i have a\nconversation with that partner and\nchange my relationship i'm going to be\ncoming in every single week and\noffloading the crap from my\ninterpersonal problems which can be a\ngood use of therapy by the way sometimes\nthat's just what people need\nbut then people don't get addicted to\ntherapy why not because\nonce you fix the problem you no longer\nneed to go the route is taken care of\nyou're no longer feeling nearly as\nanxious on a day-to-day basis and you\nstop coming\nso how does meditation work\ngenerally speaking meditation does both\nright so meditation is going to in the\nshort term depending on the kind of\ntechnique that you do will balance your\nphysiology and you can use it as a\ncoping mechanism even become quote\nunquote dependent on it\nwhich is what a coping mechanism is\nso people do in a sense get addicted to\nmeditation\nthe thing is there are also other\nprinciples that involved with addiction\nlike you know the euphoria and dopamine\nand stuff like that meditation doesn't\nreally cause that kind of stuff\nso it's not independently reinforcing\nthat way because remember drugs of abuse\ndon't just numb you they also\nartificially make you feel usually\neuphoric\nso meditation can manage that sort of as\na coping mechanism and as people\nmeditate and they start to have\nrealizations and things like that\nthey will start to\ndiscover the root of their anxiety\nand then as they do that they'll sort of\nlike the anxiety will get better\nyou know hopefully even like in\nsustained remission or permanently\ngreat question\nultimately has to do with reduction in\nanxiety is not\nhas multiple mechanisms\nyou"
