    "transcript": "and so this is where it's kind of\ninteresting because we have to sort of\nacknowledge that and at the same time\nrecognize what the impact of the\ninternet on our mind is is anyone else\nexperiencing anxiety because the state\nof because the state of the world right\nnow\ni've been getting these really anxious\nand bad feelings for seemingly no reason\nthese past few weeks\nmy chest is so tight and i can't seem to\nbreathe my colleague also had a panic\nattack last week on the same day that i\nhad mine i feel like the current con\nukraine conflict mixed with the roe v\nwade bill being overturned and the fact\nthat it feels like all the progress\nhumanity has made is being backpedaled\nin terms of human rights and fascism\nbeing on the rise i genuinely feel like\neverything is hopeless emotionally\nlogically i know we can overcome any\nhardship and that i'm lucky i'm not in\nthe ukraine or even the u.s for that\nmatter but this feeling of absolute\ndread just won't go away and i don't\nknow how to get rid of it no matter how\nmuch breath work or meditation that i do\nso this is an increasingly common\nexperience that we're having\nso the world appears to be changing\nright so like we like if you kind of\nlook at the book of revelation in the\nbible they talk about like all these\nsigns that the world is ending and i'm\nsure that this is in other religious\ntraditions as well but like we're\nchecking a lot of those boxes\nyou know there's like plagues and fires\nand floods in\nwar\nand and if i remember correctly the\nantichrist is someone who pretends to be\nreligious\nand everyone's gonna think that they're\nthe good person\nbut they're actually the antichrist so\nit's like sort of like a false prophet\ndon't quote me on that it's been a long\ntime since i studied the book of\nrevelation\nso it sometimes seems like you know the\nworld like\nis straight up ending and like things\nseem to be moving in the bat in a bad\ndirection for every step forward we take\nwe take one step back\nright there's war over here the economy\nis screwed\ninflation is an all-time high 52 percent\nof people who are living who are between\nthe ages of 18 and 29 now live with\ntheir parents and the number seems to be\ngoing up every year\nrent is\nhard to pay\nyou're like 30 years old and like at\nthis point you were supposed to no\nlonger have roommates\nright like\nand so everywhere you look it seems like\nsomething is really bad\nand things seem to be getting worse\nand then some of us are really awesome\nabout it because what we're actually\ndoing\nis like we're we've been told okay like\nbreath work meditate like meditate your\nproblems away\nright and there's definitely a role for\nmeditation\nbut no matter how much meditation you do\nit doesn't seem to be sufficient\nso if you're someone who's looking at\nthe world and it's not just that the\nworld is going to hell it's that you\nwere affected by this\nlike even if there are things happening\nin different countries or on different\ncontinents\nyou are experiencing a panic attack and\nso how the hell do you deal with this\nlike it's one thing to have a panic\nattack because your specific life is\nfalling apart\nit's another thing to have a panic\nattack because of crap that's happening\nhalf a world away\nand i'm meditating\nso it's like what what are you like how\ndo i what do you even do about this kind\nof situation it's like what how can you\nstop the world affecting you\nin in such a profound way\nnow there are going to be a lot of like\nsimple things that we're gonna talk\nabout so people may say just spend less\ntime on the internet\ni don't know if you'll know this but\nspending less time on the internet is\nreally hard\nand getting\nand it's getting\nharder every single year that goes by\nright and why is that why is spending\nless time on the internet being becoming\nharder well let's think about that the\nfirst thing is that the internet is like\nliterally infecting more and more things\nin your house so like i recently saw at\nsomeone's house a smart fridge\nso now not only can you hear about the\nwar in ukraine on your phone and on the\ncomputer\nand on your tablet and on the tv\nbut now every time you go get a midnight\nsnack\nthere's some bulletin about the war in\nukraine on your fridge\nnow it's even on the watches that we\nwear oh my god i have a smart watch so\nnow i can hear about the war of ukraine\nhere i can hear about climate change\nright here i can hear about roe v wade\nbeing overturned\nand you know soon if we don't have it\nalready we're gonna have smart showers\nright\nand so we're gonna have smart toilets\nand everywhere we go it's going to be\nlike there's going to be more access to\nthe internet more access to the internet\nnext thing that's going on\nis that the internet is getting like\nmore engaging and addictive because\npeople are figuring out okay if i\nincrease the volume\nof ads\npeople will pay attention more\nso like the internet is like invading\nour lives so we're letting it in half\nthe time and the rest of the time it's\nlike invading our lives\nand so this is where it's kind of\ninteresting because we have to sort of\nacknowledge that and at the same time\nrecognize what the impact of the\ninternet on our mind is\nso\nlet's just understand this kind of from\na physiologic sense okay to begin with\nso we have this system in our body\ncalled\nwe'll call it the stress system right so\nit's it's the\nhypothalamus pituitary adrenocortical\naxis so this is where we have this part\nof our brain called the hypothalamus\nthen the hypothalamus sends signals to\nthis part of our brain called the\npituitary gland and the pituitary gland\nsecretes a bunch of hormones\nand it\nsecretes a hormone called acth\nand acth travels to our adrenal glands\nand activates our stress system\nthe stress system was designed to be a\nshort-term system\nso it's like most of the days i'm like\nout\nyou know looking for like roots and\nberries\nand then occasionally i'll do a little\nbit of hunting if i see an animal trail\nand then sometimes i'll run across\nsomething like a cougar if i'm in the\nu.s for example so like a mountain lion\nokay\nand if i see that kind of thing i get\nmy stress system activates but generally\nspeaking the stress system gets\nactivated for brief periods of time\nand has a sustained effect\nso what we tend to see is that\nthe stress system\nokay so let's like understand this the\nstress system activates short term so in\nthe first five minutes\nwe get adrenaline\ni mean adrenaline takes seconds to\nrelease\nand then sort of like\nyou know 20 minutes plus we get cortisol\nand then cortisol kind of like activates\nfor about 24 hours\nokay so generally speaking the stress\nsystem\nactivates and lasts for about 24 hours\nand the goal of the stress system\nis to\nkeep us alive for 24 hours so what we're\ngoing to do is\nshort-term\nsurvival\nis greater than like long-term health\nit's like an all hands on deck kind of\nsituation so one thing for example that\nthe stress system does when cortisol\nactivates is it causes muscle breakdown\nfor energy\nfor immediate energy\nso let's just think about that for a\nsecond\nso like if i have a muscle that is a\ncertain size i'm gonna i'm gonna\nactually break down ten percent of that\nmuscle tissue\nso that the rest of my muscles have\nsufficient glucose and energy to be able\nto run for an hour if they need to\nso this stress system was sort of\ndesigned to be activated for brief\nperiods of time and then like sort of\nget deactivated\nnow what happens with\ntechnology is that our stress system is\nbeing constantly activated so technology\nwhat does the internet do okay there's\nthe war in ukraine and for days and days\nall we hear about is the war in ukraine\nwar and ukrainian war in ukraine and\nthen what happens is someone on on a\nnews desk someone somewhere realizes\nokay\nthe war in ukraine is no longer\nemotionally engaging\nwhat does emotionally engaging mean\nit means activates the stress system\nthose two go hand in hand so let's come\nup with a new thing to get everyone\nengaged in watching more so they come up\nwith something else and so roe v wade\nwas overturned recently so everyone's\ntalking about that everyone is stressed\nabout that\nthat's everyone's gonna be stressed\nabout this for a couple of days and then\nsomething else will come along that will\nbe emotionally engaging so not only is\ntechnology infecting all dimensions of\nyour life\nbut all of the news sources and outlets\nand social media websites and things\nlike that are all competing for your\nattention and they'll do whatever they\ncan to get you to click on their stuff\nso what this sort of means is that our\nstress system is being activated on\nmonday\non tuesday on wednesday on thursday on\nfriday etc\nand so if you have something like a\npanic attack\nwhat's going on there\nwell the first thing is if this if you\nhave a panic attack you have to be a\nlittle bit careful at assuming\nthat it's just because of everything\nthat's going on in the world you should\ndefinitely get a clinical evaluation\nbut when we're in this high stress state\none thing that we know about a panic\nattack is that panic attacks are not\ngenerally speaking mental\nso a panic attack is a physiologic\nresponse and one of the hallmarks of\npanic disorder is that oftentimes they\ndon't even have a trigger\nso if you really look at the the\ndiagnosis of panic disorder which is a\ndsm-5 diagnosis which clinicians will\nuse one of the key things about that\noftentimes really confuses people is\nwe'll see posts like this where someone\nis like i have a panic attack because of\nwhat's going on in the world and you've\ngot someone else who's got panic\ndisorder who like is walking their dog\nand is not stressed about anything and\nboom they have a panic attack\nso it's a physiologic thing\nand so as we activate our stress\nphysiology because of our technology\nexposure we sort of move ourselves in\nthe direction of something like a panic\nattack\nso what do you do about it\nso i'm going to start with the concept\nof diet so here are three things that\nyou can do\nif you\nfind that the world is despairing or the\nworld is like\ngoing to hell\nand you don't and it's affecting you\npersonally and you don't know what to do\nabout it okay\nand so the other thing that i just want\nto mention for a second is that\nso there's a great quote by\nkrishnamurthy i may get it a little bit\nwrong but he basically said\nbeing well adjusted to a sick society\ndoes not make you healthy\nand i think that that quote is so so\nrelevant today\nso what's happening is we're having to\nadapt\nto a society that is getting worse\nand as we adapt to a society that's\ngetting worse\nwe don't end up actually as healthy\nwe adapt to our circumstances but we\nsuffer because of it\nso here are a couple of things to really\nthink about in terms of\nhow to address this\nthe first is we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about diet\nokay\nso if i eat\nlike cheetos and pizza\nand\ndrink beer or soda all day long\nday after day week after week month\nafter month year after year\nwhat is going to happen to my body\nright so depending on what i put in\ni'm going to\nsee changes\nright so i'll basically like pollute my\nbody\nso what you'll see is all kinds of\nproblems like you'll see\nyou know decreased energy\nkind of sluggishness\ni remember this very well in my days of\nordering chinese takeout\nyou know just huge amounts of chinese\ntakeout so i could\nreduce the cost of the delivery fee\nand then sort of have all this food\npiled up so that i didn't have to leave\nmy room\nand i felt low energy sluggish\nfelt bad\nleaned on unhealthy coping mechanisms\nalso started to feel angry at like all\nkinds of things outside of my control\nright so this is what happens when you\nsort of pollute your body as your body\nstarts to like not necessarily\nmalfunction like it will eventually over\ntime if you do it over and over and over\nagain right you can cause damage to your\nbody but depending on the diet that you\nput in you're going to get a particular\nkind of\nimpact\nso what is our information diet\nwhat do we consume in terms of\ninformation\nso like these things are happening right\nit's not a question that these things\nare happening it's not a question hi\nyes\nokay where were we\nall right\nso what is the information diet that\nyou're consuming\nso like as we put certain things in our\nmind our mind will start to react\nemotionally as it reacts emotionally\nwe will start to activate our stress\nsystem as we activate our stress system\nwe will move in the direction of\nsomething like a panic attack\nokay\nso\nthis is where i want to share with you\nall something so this is like\nso you need to basically control\nthis system in a couple of different\nways so one is information\nleads to activation of the stress system\nwhich then\nresults in increased\nenergy\nright because you get ramped up does\nthat okay hold on let me\njust move this up\nokay this is going to result in\nincreased energy\nand when our mind has a bunch of energy\nwe result in increased anxiety\nso if you think about anxiety\nand this is all like if you all have\nwatched dr k's guide this will be old\nnews to you so if we think about anxiety\nanxiety is too much energy in the mind\ndoes that make sense it's like your\nthoughts are moving really really fast\nso fast thoughts\ncircular thoughts\nright it's like if you've got too much\nstuff in there and it can't get out\nnow there's another kind of problem\nwhich is that as we look at the world\nlike this\nwhat starts to happen is\nwe get\nthese are problems that feel unsolvable\nso the other challenge that we run into\nis when our mind comes up with a problem\nwhy do we have a brain that can\nunderstand problems to fix them\nso if we think about like even if if you\nlook at a primate right so like let's\nsay i'm a chimp\nchimps understand problems they're like\noh i'm hungry or it's raining or i'm\nthirsty and then they're able to like\naffect change to fix the problem that's\nthe whole reason that we have feelings\nlike hunger and thirst\nso the reason we have anxiety is to like\ntry to figure out okay what are we\nanxious about so that we can fix it\nnow the problem is that our brain\nevolved\nin a situation\nwhere there were not global problems\nso i even remember talking to my\ngrandmother who grew up in a village of\nlike 300 people in india\nand the outside world was like a myth to\nher no one ever left like no one had\never left on a country or been on an\nairplane i remember the one of the early\nnot the first time i went but i i had\nthis very vivid memory\nof some kid asking me in the village\nhe was like you came here on an airplane\nand he was fascinated and i was like\nyeah i came here on an airplane it's the\nonly way to get here\nand he was like\nan airplane goes really fast right and i\nwas like yeah it goes very fast he's\nlike how you know like\ngoes like hundreds of miles an hour or\nwhatever and he's like\nhow do you not fall out\ni was like what\nit's like how do you not fall out of the\nplane if it's going because this person\ngrew up in a village\nwhere\nthe mode of transportation is a cart\nand the idea of an enclosed\nlike thing\nthat you don't fall out of like he\nthought that that airplanes were just\nopen on the top and he just kind of sit\ndown like a cart\nit's a great question\nbut this is the kind of world that our\nbrain evolved in\nit didn't evolve for a world with global\nproblems\nwhich by the way are unsolvable\nright so if you're in the u.s and you're\nkind of thinking like okay roe v wade\ngot overturned like what can i do about\nit\nand then you kind of look at the world\nand you look at like how everything is\nlike you know popular vote stuff and\ngerrymandering and the political\nsituation in the us is like all going to\nhell\nand so what can you do about it nothing\nand so then that what that sort of does\nis generally speaking the purpose of\nanxiety is to take action to correct the\nproblem but this isn't an option\nso what we end up doing is just like\nbouncing back like\ninto more energy and more anxiety and\nthen as we can keep on consuming stuff\nfrom the internet\nthis kind of goes in and the good thing\nhere is that you can meditate here right\nso that's where meditation kind of comes\nin\nso how do we fix this problem\nthe first thing to understand is that\nthis whole cycle starts with this\nso what you need to do is go on an\ninformation diet\nnow this is really tricky because\nthe business model of the people who\nstress you out is to stress you out\nit's emotionally engaging stuff that\ncauses people to click on things right\nso we even recently had a interesting\nuh post where someone was like i don't\nlike y'all's youtube title titles\nbecause they're clickbait it's like yeah\nwe play that game too\nright so someone once told me it's a\nvery successful not one but several very\nsuccessful youtubers i asked them you\nknow help me understand like how i can\nhelp people through youtube and what one\nof them told me brilliant\nsaid you have to trick people into\nlearning\nyou can't tell them\nno one watches videos about\ni mean people do watch videos but like\nyou have to trick people into learning\nthat's how you if you want to help\npeople on youtube you can't tell them\nyou're going to try to help them you\nhave to trick them into it\num\nanyway so it was an interesting piece of\ninformation so this is where like\nlike literally the amount of time that\nyou spend in this kind of\ntoxic information environment is going\nto affect your mindset so we can also\nlook at this as in someone who\num\nyou know is in a toxic household so if\nyou're in a toxic household\nand you have like a parent who's like\nconstantly emotionally abusive the less\ntime you spend in that household the\nbetter you will feel about yourself and\nwhat we're essentially doing is letting\nthe toxicity in\nthrough all of our devices and so you\nresult in something weird right and this\nperson even understands this\nlogically i know we can overcome\nanything i'm not even in the ukraine or\nthe u.s this stuff doesn't even affect\nme\nbut i have this feeling of absolute\ndread\nright so we have these empathic parts of\nour brain which we relate to the\nsuffering of others and even though\nwe're not directly affected by them as\nlong as we're hearing about this stuff\nwe're going to be affected by it\nso this is something that i think is\nunder appreciated in terms of like\nmotivation and we actually dig into this\ni want to just show you all this so this\nis the new guide that we have coming out\nso for those of y'all that have seen\nthis before these are the old guides\ngreen blue and\norange so this is the motivation guide\nand one of the things that we really\nemphasize in terms of controlling the\nmind and understanding how to like have\na healthy mind let me try to find it\nnot this\nwait where\noh here we go it's over here\nso is an understanding of the indriyas\nor the sense organs\nso this is where your motivation is\ngoing to be heavily heavily heavily\naffected\nby your sense organs\nyour state of mind is going to be\nheavily heavily heavily affected by your\nsense organs\nso in the same way that like if you\nthink about you know going to therapy\nwhat happens in therapy you have a\ndifferent kind of sensory input\nif you think about\ngetting away from an abusive\nrelationship\nright if you're dating an abusive dude\nand you get out of that relationship\nwhat like you're changing your sensory\ninput\nbeing in a healthy relationship creates\na different kind of sensory input\nso a lot of the state of our mind like i\ndon't know how else to say this but if\nsomeone like you know someone you care\nabout tells you\nhey you're a terrible person\nwhat is that that's actually technically\nsensory input\nthat's what it is it's the impact\ninternally of the sensory input but\nliterally what it is is a sensory signal\nand so by cultivating the right kind of\nsensory input we can actually alter the\nshape of our mind\nso very practically what does this mean\nit's kind of simple but\nyou know limiting\ncontact\nto the internet\nso there's simple things that you can do\nso like let's look at a couple of and by\nthe way on the guide we also sort of\ntalk some about this right so we're\ngoing to go there's there's videos about\ntechnology habits and how to develop\nhealthy technology habits we're going to\ngive you all some of that information\nright here now okay\nso\nlimiting contact of the internet so the\nfirst kind of question is\nuh first thing that you can do is don't\ntake\nyour phone\nwith you\nin the house\nso what we'll oftentimes find is i'll\nsit down on the couch and i'll scroll\nthrough my phone and then i'll walk to\nthe kitchen i'll scroll through my phone\ni'll use the toilet and i'll scroll\nthrough my phone i'll wake up in the\nmorning and i'll scroll scroll through\nmy phone i'll get into bed at night and\ni'll scroll through my phone\nso the purpose of the portability of the\nphone is it's fine if you take it\noutside\nright that's great so that you have a\nway to call people or communicate or\nwhatever but don't carry it with you\nthroughout the house\none really really simple tip\nokay so it's fine to like if you want to\nread a news article and you sit down at\nyour desktop or your laptop or whatever\nand you're like okay like now i'm going\nto look at the news or now i'm going to\nbrowse reddit\nso in order to control it don't take\nyour devices with you so you have to\nactively stop the invasion of the\ninternet into your life\nso second thing is like design designate\ntime\nfor internet usage\nbecause what's happening is it's like\nit's all over the place right and it\ninfects every part like so it's\ni'm going to browse at it for an hour\nthat's okay like i'm just going to\ndesignate it so don't let the internet\ninvade the empty spaces of your life\nit's fine because we have to use the\ninternet right like that's there's no\nway to get around it\nbut be very careful about letting it\nfill in all of the emptiness and as the\ninternet fills in the empty spaces of\nyour life\nthis stress reaction will increase\nokay\nso the same way that we have to control\nour physical diet we need to absolutely\ncontrol our information diet\nsecond thing that we need to do\nis\nfocus on the stress system\nnow this person already meditates so\nthat's fantastic\nthere are some um\nuh\nyou know meditation techniques so one a\ngood example of this is nadi shudhi\npranayam or alternate nostril breathing\nwhich we've been teaching for a while\nit's really interesting because this has\na new name in scientific circles so i\nwouldn't be surprised if in the next\nyear or two you hear everything about\nthis thing called cardiac coherence\nbreathing it's alternate nostril\nbreathing\nso alternate nostril breathing is a\ngreat example\nthe cool thing about it is since we've\nsort of come up with a new name and and\nmedical science is culturally\nappropriated not ishidi pranayam what\nwe're actually seeing is a lot of\nstudies on it and the autonomic benefits\nof cardiac coherence breathing\nso autonomic is the system that we're\ntalking about it's the stress system so\nwe want techniques specifically that\naffect or are targeted towards our\nautonomic nervous system\nso this is where what we really want is\nbronium\nif you're talking about not just\nmindfulness\nand qigong are probably your two best\nbets for meditative techniques of which\nalternate nostril breathing is one\nbasically we want techniques that focus\non the length\nincreasing the length\nof exhalation\nand this is the common physiologic\nelement for reductions in in\nhyperactive reductions in\nhyperactivation of the autonomic nervous\nsystem\nso basically de-stresses you\nokay\nso you do want to meditate the problem\nis that you can only meditate so much\nand if your inputs are still super high\nlike it's not going to be enough\nthe third thing that we want to do\nis get this energy out\nbecause as long as the energy is\nbouncing around in our mind it it needs\nto be vented in some way so you can\nabsolutely do something like see a\ntherapist\nright so that's one way of getting out\nanxiety and things like that especially\nif you're having a panic attack you\nprobably want a clinical evaluation but\nthis is going to be kind of subtle\nbut what i want you to do is take\ninsufficient\naction\nreally important\nso remember that part of our anxiety\nsystem in the brain is i have anxiety\nand the purpose of anxiety is to prompt\naction\nthe prop prompting the action reduces\nthe energy\nthis is a high energy state\nright\nand so we sort of know that\nit reduces the energy\nand so what it does is it no longer\nloops out\nnow we also sort of understand this in a\ncouple of other ways because we know\nthat something like exercise\nimproves anxiety gets some of that\nenergy out but when you exercise you're\nnot fixing the problem does that make\nsense like if i'm anxious about\nsome problem in the world like climate\nchange\nand my anxiety is really bad and i'm on\nmedication i'm doing cbt and all this\nother good stuff exercise doesn't alter\nclimate change at all what it does is\ndecreases my energy\num this is an approximation right so\nthis i'm using the term energy here as a\nis an analog for all kinds of different\nphysiologic effects\nand what we know is that exercise will\nclinically reduce anxiety\nso what about this word insufficient\nso the problem is that if i'm anxious\nabout let's say climate change\nwhat makes it hard for me to take action\nit's not going to be enough\nwhat's the point\nso here we are when we're anxious and\nwhat is the thought in our head\nwhat's the point\nit won't be enough\nand it's this thought\nthis amount of thought of insufficiency\nif you want to look at politics\neveryone in the us especially has been\ncomplaining recently that our\npoliticians are really really old\nright\nthey're out of touch with the young\ngeneration young generation doesn't vote\nyou asks a young person why don't you\nvote\nit won't be enough it won't do any good\nso what do you expect\nso if you're anxious\nand you don't take action\nthat anxiety will continue to persist\nright so someone's in chat is saying i'm\n22 haven't voted once since i was 18 i\ndon't care too\nright that's your choice\nmy point is that anytime we look at a\nproblem\nand if we want to take an action that\nwould somehow help almost from this\nangle\nthe\nthe\nwhat keeps us from taking this action is\nthis thought it won't be enough\nso if i'm let's say if i want to get in\nshape and i feel physically unhealthy\nright\nand then like if i look at let's say\ntaking a walk why don't i do it because\nmy mind says to me it's not enough it's\nnot enough it's not enough therefore you\ndon't do it so the action doesn't get\ntaken so what i want you to focus on is\ninsufficient action\nif you want to transform your life the\nmost important thing you can do is start\ntaking insufficient actions\nokay\ntake insufficient actions\nso if you're worried about the climate\ngo and like plant a tree like you can\nplant a tree it's not hard to do you can\ngrow a see\nput a seed in a little thing and then go\nput it somewhere\nright you can pick up trash in a public\nplace\nclean up the environment a little bit\nand then you'll say to yourself oh but\nthat's not enough that's not enough\nthat's not enough\nbut once you start taking insufficient\nactions you'll be amazed at what it does\nfor you it works on this energy\nprinciple here\nright because now we're like sort of\nventing our mind we're physically active\nwe're getting out of the house there's\nall kinds of things that taking\ninsufficient action will recruit\nand then this is also where like over\ntime you'll start to learn a couple of\nalmost spiritual perspectives about like\neven if the world is going to hell i did\nmy part\nright\nyou can start to cultivate detachment\ni can't fix climate change but i did my\npart\nand this is the cool thing about the\ninternet this is what we discovered here\nat healthy gamer through aoe this\nconcept of aoe healing\nis that no snowflake thinks it's\nresponsible for the avalanche\nbecause it's true\nright\nso take some kind of action\nwhatever it is\nlike it's not important what you take\nbut just be careful about this\ninsufficient part it's okay to start\nwith insufficient actions\nand if you do three these three things\nif you control\nwhat is entering your mind through the\ncontrol of of sensory input\nand then the guide for example will\nteach you specific meditation techniques\nto\nto help you filter what comes into your\nmind\nif you decompress your stress through\nparticular meditation techniques like\nalternate nostril breathing and if you\nvent your high level of energy you'll\nsort of work on all three of these\ndimensions\nand hopefully\nit'll help you manage a world that\nappears to be going to hell\nquestions\nsomeone's asking does your anxiety help\nwith social anxiety i don't really get\nout much\nso the the anxiety guide\nis organized in basically two ways we\ntalk about some clinical stuff in which\nthere's a a particular sex section on or\nvideo on social anxiety but the bigger\npart of the anxiety guide is that it\nteaches you\nthe nature of anxiety in your mind in a\nnon-clinical way so we go over things\nlike generalized anxiety disorder\ntreatment perspectives and and stuff\nlike that diagnosis\nof clinical stuff but the whole point is\nthat it we teach all stuff like i mean i\nhave the video right here i mean i have\nthe thing so i can just show you\nso we'll also talk about things like you\nknow evidence-based herbs for anxiety\nand things like that but i think the\nmain thing that\ni like about it is that it teaches you\nlike you know basics of anxiety 101\nthings like the effect of physiology on\nanxiety so this isn't specific to social\nanxiety but it absolutely applies to\nsocial anxiety\nwe'll also teach you things like\nhow we respond to anxiety in ways that\nmake it worse\nand so like how we sort of like\npropagate anxiety by trying to control\nit and we'll actually talk about that\nwe're going to cover that today in a\npost\nso we don't\nthere oh when before i forget i mean\nthere is a segment on\nsocial anxiety disorder\nbut most of it is like the basics of\nlike how anxiety works in your mind\nokay\n[Laughter]\nso\num\nour terrible is asking any advice for\nhow to disconnect consciously for\ncontent creators whose job description\nis to be chronically online 100 so we\nhave a content creator program\nwhere we work\nwe have a coaching program for people\nwho are content creators\nand working with hundreds of content\ncreators now we've learned how hard it\nis\nto separate\nbecause it's your job to be online right\nso that's where there's like all kinds\nof like important tips if you are a\ncontent creator or being online as a\npart of your job\nso one thing is you have to be careful\nabout\nwhat's logged in where so there's even\nsimple tips like you know when i log\ninto my computer every day i use\nbasically the same login for\nif i'm playing dota or if i'm streaming\nor if i'm\nreviewing like data from a research\nstudy so i use the same login but the\nthe truth of the matter is that you can\nactually create different logins where\nlike twitter is not logged in\nright or like steam is not visible or\nhard to access\nright so there's all kinds of stuff that\nyou can do to like literally create\ndividing lines between work and like not\nwork\nthat's also where there are like other\ntips that we'll have which is that like\nso for example don't be don't log into\ntwitter on your phone\nso if if really the purpose of twitter\nis to\nis work related then it should be logged\nin on your desktop and you manage your\ntwitter as part of your job\nand but then you're like but if i'm not\nlogged into twitter on my phone then\ndot dot dot yeah absolutely so there\nwill be a price to pay\nif you are not logged into twitter on\nyour phone\nthe question is\nis the benefit worth the price that you\nhave to pay\nso sometimes that also means creating\nseparate twitter accounts right so\nseparate your personal twitter account\nfrom your work twitter account\num\nand i think it's like there's a lot of\nlike limit setting which becomes\nincreasingly more difficult if you're a\ncontent creator and there are all kinds\nof other problems as well like that\ncontent creators suffer from because\nthey don't have good boundaries in their\nlife by virtue of their job\nso another really classic example i know\nthis isn't what you asked but it's\nsomething that we see time and time\nagain and something that we've sort of\nlearned which is not stuff that they\nteach you in medical school by the way\nwhich is like collaborations versus\nfriendships so this is so hard for\ncontent creators because\nwhen someone is like hey do you want to\nhang out sometime\nis this a collab is this person talking\nto me because i have more followers than\nthey are or are they my friend\nso like this this like\nthe tension between personal\nrelationships and collaborations because\na lot of the collaboration success\ndepends on the quality of the personal\nrelationship\nit's like they don't get to have friends\nthat are separate from work\nwhich is not exclusively a problem for\ncontent creators right it's just\nexacerbated or amplified but there are a\nlot of people whose social circle and\nprofessional circle overlap\nthere are all kinds of challenges that\ncontent creators face which i think are\nactually relatively novel\nso some stuff that we sort of know if\nyou look at like celebrity psychology\nbut\ncontent creation is completely different\nbecause there's also all this stuff\naround metrics so another challenge that\ncontent creators face is\nhow do you know when enough is enough\nwhen are you done editing a youtube\nvideo\nwhen have you come up with the right\nthumbnail should i spend an hour coming\nup with a thumbnail two hours five hours\nten hours\nwhat's the right title for a youtube\nvideo should i spend an hour two hours\nfive hours ten hours\nright so the nice thing about many jobs\nis that there's like a start and a\nfinish like even as a clinician like i'm\na psychiatrist i have appointments i\nhave appointments scheduled from nine to\nfive pm and at five pm i finish my last\nappointment and i'm done\ni'm done for the day but as a content\ncreator\neven if you're doing something like you\nknow making music\nright like when is the song perfect\ncan i work on it more can it be better\nit's so challenging so many challenges\nthat a lot of content creators have\nit's been an absolute pleasure to work\nwith all these people and thankfully\nwe've been able to help them\nsubstantially\nbut it's it's really interesting how the\nmental health challenges that people\nface\nare evolving as our world evolves\num\nokay\ngreat question\nhow do we deal with the guilt of not\nbeing in touch with the news\ngreat question\nso what's wrong with not being in touch\nwith the news why is that a bad thing\nright so where does this idea\nthat it is your responsibility to read\nthe news or you know follow the news\nwhat\nwhat difference does it make\nwhat is so i remember having a\nconversation with a family member of\nmine\nwhere they were like you should read the\npaper every day and i was like why\nand they're like so that way you know\nwhat's going on in the world you can't\nbe a clueless noob and it's like\nwhat difference does it make if i know\nwhat's going on in the world or i don't\nknow what's going on in the world\nlike what difference does it make\nif i\nyou know there are times where it makes\na difference\nright so if like if for example like\nyou're trying to figure out who to vote\nfor then you may want to understand\nwhat's going on in terms of like foreign\npolicy and like whatnot i'm not saying\nthat collecting information is a bad\nthing\nthis is where basically there was\nsomething else that i'll tell you all\nwhich is that if something is so\nimportant\nand so huge you'll hear about it even if\nyou never watch the news\nor like consume the news in any way\nshape or form\nso i the the tricky thing is that that's\na logical perspective the question is\nwhy do you feel guilty\nthat's what's important to understand\nwhere does that guilt coming from am i\nbeing a and then like really like look\nat that critically\nis it appropriate to feel guilty\nwhere is this idea that i'm feeling\nbecause if you feel guilty you feel that\nway for a reason it's a valid feeling it\nmay not be correct but it's valid\nyou feel guilty because you were taught\nto feel guilty because somewhere along\nthe way a value system was injected into\nyou\nand you're not living up to that value\nsystem therefore you feel guilt\nso it's not inappropriate that you feel\nguilty because that's what you were\ntaught\nit doesn't make it correct though\nand this is the subtlety between a\nfeeling that's valid and a feeling\nthat's appropriate\nright so like when when someone gets me\na gift for example for my birthday\nand the value of the gift is a hundred\ndollars\nand if i grew up in a in a household\nwhere the value of gifts the price tag\non the gift\ncorrelates with the love that you feel\nand so i look at this hundred dollar\ngift and i think to myself this person\ngot my sibling a 200 gift\nscrew this\ni'm mad at this person for giving me\nsuch a crappy gift that feeling may be\nvalid\nbased on your internal construction\nthat's what you were taught\nmoney means caring money means love\nand it's not entirely appropriate and\nwhat we really have to do is be a little\nbit critical\nand exploratory with our value system\nwhen we feel a particular way\nand that's how you free yourself of the\nguilt\nit's not giving into the behavior it's\nunderstanding why you feel that way and\nthen deciding for yourself whether you\nare okay feeling that way in that\nsituation\nyou"
