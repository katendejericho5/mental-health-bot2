    "transcript": "this job sucks and then you go to the\nnext job and you're like that job sucks\nyou go to the next job and you're like\nthat job sucks you don't like it just\nall sucks so like what do you do in that\nsituation how to not be miserable at job\njust entering the workforce and all and\nit's hard not working these random odd\njobs i don't enjoy whatsoever the\ncurrent job i'm working at i absolutely\ndespise\ni know plenty of people there who make\nit worthwhile i always work my hardest\nto get done so at the end of the day i\nfeel like i have achieved something but\ni still can't help but feeling miserable\ndoes anyone have any tips on how to\ntolerate the job better\nso like i said a a minute ago originally\ni wasn't gonna pick this post because i\nthought that okay this is like so\ngeneral we don't know anything about\nwhere this person is working we don't\nreally know like you know what their\nwork situation is we don't know anything\nabout their colleagues we don't know\nanything about their upbringing we don't\nknow anything about anything\nthey're like i started working recently\ni don't enjoy it anyone have tips\nand so it occurred to me though that\nlike we actually don't need all of that\ninformation like if we get a general\nquestion we can actually\nanswer in a general way\nright so what i'd love to do today is\nactually share with you all some\ninformation like general information\nabout how to not be miserable at your\njob\nso everything that we're going to talk\nabout today is it may not apply to\neveryone right so the more you relate to\nthis maybe some stuff will will stick\nsome stuff which is actually okay\nbut it's kind of interesting because we\nas a society don't really teach people\nhow to enjoy their work\nwe don't teach people what is the nature\nof happiness we don't teach people what\nis the nature of enjoyment we don't\nteach people what is the nature of\ncontentment what is the nature of\nsuffering\nand the cool thing is that if we sort of\nlike i don't know if this makes sense\nbut\nwe always kind of assume that the\nsuffering is within the job\nright that like oh like you just keep on\nrandomly like moving jobs\nuntil you find the right one that you\nenjoy\nand once you find the right job\nthen you'll be happy\nthat's true to a certain extent but like\nwe don't really teach people okay how do\nyou go about finding the right job how\ndo you go about actually like enjoying\nyour job is there any component\nin the person job relationship that\nactually like where is it just the job\nor is there any part of that that comes\nfrom you\nand i think as we kind of tunnel down\ninto that we're gonna learn a little bit\nabout how to be not miserable at our job\nbecause it's tricky right so like this\nperson is entering the workforce and\nlike working these random odd jobs and\nyou could be in the same kind of\nsituation where it's like you don't have\na career yet but you're just like kind\nof randomly working jobs and you're kind\nof miserable\nand so what you do is you move from like\njob to job to job you're like this job\nsucks and then you go to the next job\nand you're like that job sucks you go to\nthe next job and you're like that job\nsucks and you go from sucky job to sucky\njob to sucky job\nand at the end of the day like\nyou don't like it just all sucks so like\nwhat do you do in that situation is this\nthe kind of thing where you have to\nbecome like an inner zen master and you\nhave to like learn how to tolerate your\njob is it like finding the right job is\nit like learning detachment like what\nwhat do we do here okay\nso\nthe other thing\nis in terms of the zen stuff\nwhat some people may think is that at\nsome point what i'm going to do\nis share with them some kind of like\nsecret detachment\ntechnique i'm going to be like oh like\nlearn to detach\nif you detach and you understand the\nnature of happiness right what i just\nsaid if you learn this secret technique\nthe secret jutsu\nthen you will enjoy the job\nand so the tricky thing also happens\nwhere\nif we sort of assume that right if i say\nokay there is a component that's you\nthen it kind of like\nit doubles your misery because you're\nlike oh like look at all these other\npeople able to enjoy jobs it's not the\njob it's me\ni'm the idiot that doesn't know how to\ndo the job i can't detach enough i don't\nknow how to how to squeeze water out of\na stone\nidiot me\nand so there's a part so there's a funny\nthing here where there is a personal\ncomponent but unless we're careful we'll\nslip into some amount of self-blame\nright and then like this is something\nthe boomer generation will sort of say\nthis they'll be like you know i don't\nknow why you're complaining back in my\nday we had to walk five miles in the\nsnow to take out the trash and this and\nthat and all this kind of stuff they're\nlike we don't know why you're\ncomplaining\nand so it's kind of tricky because this\nis like is this the problem in you or is\nthis the problem in the job\nand if you sort of adopt this idea that\nlike oh if i detach myself enough then\nlike oh i'll be fine then it's like a\npersonal deficiency and then you're like\noh like you know i guess i'm\nbad at this\nbut like what if the job is just bad\nright what if it isn't a personal\ndeficiency so navigating this kind of\nstuff and at the end of the day if the\nsituation is like i'm miserable at my\njob what do i do about it does anyone\nhave tips it turns out that we do have\ntips\nokay\nso\nfirst thing that we've got to understand\nis where misery comes from okay\nso\nif we understand like what the nature of\nmisery is and we understand what we will\nlike about our job what we won't like\nabout our job as we start to tunnel down\ninto the relationship between me and my\njob we'll start to really get a good\nsense of like how to be less miserable\nat the job\nso oftentimes what people will do is\nthey'll move from job to job to job and\nthey'll kind of like do it randomly\nright i don't like this job therefore\ni'm gonna just let me try something else\nelse like even if we look at this post\nfor a second what this person is saying\nis i absolutely despise\nthis job so they're gonna look for\nanything else\nthe problem is that when you jump to\nanything else your ship is sinking so\nwithout really thinking about it you\njust jump to the next sinking ship and\nthen that ship is is prone to sync as\nwell and then you're like man it's just\nsinking ships after sinking ships after\nsinking ships\nso this is where we've got to be a\nlittle bit careful about what is the\nnature of misery in our job what is it\nabout the job that all that will make it\nthat makes it miserable for us so we've\ngot to sort of understand that\nso let's start with a couple of thoughts\nthat people in miserable jobs have\nand also sort of how to counter those\nthoughts okay\nso\nwhat we're going to do with you all now\nis actually go through\nseven different kind of tips\nto\nhelp you\nkind of manage your uh a bad job okay\nso what we've got to do is understand\nwhat is the nature of misery and what\nmakes us miserable miserable in the job\nand if we understand what makes us\nmiserable we can sort of start to\nunderstand\nhow to move to the next job in a better\nway okay\nso the first thought that we tend to\nhave\nwhen we're miserable\nis it'll last forever\nso this is kind of interesting right so\ngenerally speaking when human beings are\nsuffering in some way there's an\nassumption that pain will last forever\nthis is absolutely a cognitive bias\nthere's all kinds of studies that have\nbeen done on this kind of principle that\nshows that\npain\ngives people a sense of infinite time so\nwhen we're struggling when we're feeling\nnauseous it feels like this is going to\nlast forever\nso this kind of has an interesting\neffect when you're in the in a job\nsituation because if you're miserable at\nyour job\nand then if it if you think it's going\nto last forever\nthat's going to just go ahead and\nreinforce the misery\nright\nwhereas what i would kind of say is that\nthe road to a good job is paved with\ncrappy jobs\nso the first thing to understand is that\neven if you have a bad job first of all\nit won't last forever\nand also\nif you pay attention properly\neach crappy job that you have will\nactually set you up for a better job\ndown the road okay\nso this is sort of like the price of\ntuition so it's okay to notice this\nthought to acknowledge this thought and\nto think okay this is gonna last forever\nand as we'll show you down the road like\nfirst of all just acknowledge that you\nfeel that way\nthat'll start to reduce the feeling a\nlittle bit and then start to also\nrecognize that this is sort of the price\nthat you pay for eventually finding a\ngood job because even if you are in a\njob that you don't enjoy at least you\nnow know some element of what you don't\nenjoy so the next time you find a job\nyou know specifically the kinds of\nthings not to look for to avoid actually\nright so there are particular things\nthat make you miserable\nso related to this\nwhen we're miserable we have a second\nkind of thought\nsecond thought that we have is there is\nno point to this\nso this is where we kind of think about\nthis idea of a dead end job\nso when we're miserable we don't see any\npoint to the work we're doing we're like\nwho on earth would value this on a\nresume i don't understand like you know\nhow this can help me in any way shape or\nform this too is\nmisery\ncreates this thought\nand then the more that we wallow in that\nthought the more misery it creates so\nwe've got to do is break both of these\ncycles to be less miserable at the job\nhow do we break these cycles we start by\nbecoming aware\nand then we start to hopefully like as\nyou become aware like take a step back\ndo some kind of meditation technique you\nknow like decompress that emotion\nand then what we want to do is start to\nlike like think critically about this so\ndon't think so black and white start to\nthink in shades of of gray and then\neventually as we think critically about\nit we can start to think constructively\nand we'll get to what that means down in\na minute\nbut when we sort of say there's no point\nwhat we're going to also recognize is\nthat this job is actually valuable\nexperience\nit's valuable experience for you because\nonce again we're going to teach you this\nin a second\nyou can use this job to sort of figure\nout okay what is it what is it that's\nactually making miserable and how do i\navoid this in the future because\noftentimes what happens is we as we just\nrandomly move from job to job we're not\nthinking a little we're not thinking\ncritically about what did i dislike in\nthis job that makes that i should be\ncareful about in the next job you also\nsee this in people who get into bad\nrelationships over and over and over\nagain they're like okay this\nrelationship sucks so let me just like\npeace out of this\nthey ghost but they don't even really\nthink at all about okay what made that\nrelationship bad what was my\ncontribution to that relationship and so\nwe tend to see in relationships as\npeople will get into the same cycles\nover and over and over again or it'll be\nsame relationships over and over again\nit'll become a cycle\nyou'll see this a lot with people who\nare codependent too\nright so like i'm i'm dependent you're\ndependent we're codependent together we\nend up breaking up after a miserable six\nyears and i\nfall right back into a codependent\nrelationship\nso you have to have awareness of the\ncycle in order to break it then start to\nthink critically about okay like is\nthere really no point to this like why\ndo i think there's no point to this what\ndo i do about it and then what we're\ngoing to try to figure out is how\nthey're actually there is a point to\nthis\nso this is valuable experience for a\ncouple of reasons you may say okay it's\nnot valuable experience like who cares\nthat i was packing boxes for like six\nmonths\nthis looks great on a resume because you\nshowed up every day for six months\nand like if you're interviewing with\nsomeone\nat a job and they're like okay what did\nyou do and you're like yeah i packed\nboxes for six months\nand they're like\noh that's interesting can you tell me\ndid you know why are you leaving and\nit's i found it boring they're like oh\nthat's you know that's a weird thing to\nsay during an interview and you're like\nyeah i know it's like i didn't find it\nvery intellectually engaging but you\nknow i told my boss that i would be\nthere on time so i showed up every day\nand even though i found it boring like i\nhad committed to do it so i did the best\njob that i could\ni you know i worked really hard my\nbosses were super happy with me i'm\nreally looking for something that\nwill reward my hard work and that i can\nfind like a little bit more\nintellectually challenging\ni'm a reliable person i'll do work if\nyou tell me to do something i'm gonna do\nit if i put my mind to it i'm gonna do a\ngood job that's what you can count on\nfrom me\neven saying something like that if\nyou've been doing media labor for six\nsix months like showing up every day and\ndoing something is actually like a very\nvery valuable skill\nright a lot of people like they don't\neven show up like showing up is half the\nbattle when it comes to a job\nso there is valuable experience there\nso\nthis idea that there's no point and that\nthis is a dead end job this is something\nthat we've seen a lot in our career\ncoaching program where like you know\npeople think they have dead end jobs but\neven if you've worked retail for like a\nyear or 18 months and there's no\nopportunity for growth the fact that\nyou've been a stable and consistent\nworker for 18 months is actually like a\npretty big win right you showed up if\nyou've been working in customer\nrelations you've been dealing with\nkaren's and like all this other kind of\nstuff right like you're dealing with all\nthese like different people you can say\nyeah i work well under pressure um you\nknow i i show up i've opened i've closed\ni've gained increased responsibility\nlike i'm reliable and i'm good at\ncustomer service especially because the\nplace that i worked our products really\nweren't great so people would complain a\nlot\nand so i was kind of like i had to\nmanage people as they were complaining\nabout stuff so even a dead-end job that\nyou don't think is valuable can actually\nbe like incredibly valuable as long as\nyou think critically and constructively\nabout it\nso third thing that we're going to talk\nabout\nso tips on misery\nso\nthis is just kind of a tip\nso it\nmay not get easier\nbut\nyou'll get better at it\nso if we remember this scenario this\nperson had recently entered the\nworkforce\nand this is something where human beings\nlike you know the first time that you\nlet's say shoot a basketball you may\nthink to yourself like oh my god like\ni'm never going to be able to do this\nany time you start something out\nyou think to yourself that you'll never\nbe able to adapt that it's way too hard\nand like you know you'll never you just\nthink to yourself i'll never be able to\ndo it\nhuman beings are remarkably adaptable\nright so i i it's interesting\ni learned this actually on my\nthree-month jail rotation where like\nthese people are in jail and and most\npeople when they come to jail think i\nwill never be able to survive jail i\nwon't be able to stay stuck within these\nfour walls for four years there's no way\nthere's no way but human beings are\nincredibly adaptable\nand even after a few a couple of months\nof despair and stuff like that like most\nprisoners just adjust\nbecause that's what human beings do\nright so like there's all kinds of\nadjustment i've worked with people who\nhave had you know physical injuries and\ndisabilities had things like legs\namputated and stuff like that and no one\nthinks that they're going to be able to\nadjust\nwhereas the truth of the matter is that\nhuman beings are incredibly incredibly\nadaptable so if you're entering the job\nworld and you're thinking to yourself\nthis is terrible this is terrible i hate\nit i hate it i hate it i'm not saying\nthat you should learn to love it what\ni'm saying is\nit's it's a little bit okay because you\nwill learn to adapt we're not saying\nthat you shouldn't strive for more we're\nnot saying that you shouldn't change\nyour job we're going to teach you all\nthat kind of stuff too\nbut have a little bit of faith in\nyourself in the sense that it may not\nnecessarily get easy the job may not\nchange but you will get better at it so\nhave faith in yourself it'll be okay\nall right\nnow we're going to get into a lot of the\ndetails so the next thing that we need\nto do is diagnose\nour misery\nso i don't mean like clinically we're\nusing that term to\nfind out where your misery comes from so\nwe're going to share with you all is a\nfew dimensions\nthat you can look at\nthat oftentimes contribute to misery\nwhich we take for granted the first is\ndo you work\nwith people\nor not\nokay\nso some people hate their job because\nthey have to work with particular\nco-workers some people hate their job\nbecause they're like sitting in a back\nroom and they're like packing boxes all\nday and there's not another soul in\nsight so this is really important like\nis part of your misery due to the kind\nof people that you work with or the fact\nthat there are people or aren't people\nbecause this is something huge that you\ncan sort of select the next job based on\nso if you're working in a back room and\nyou want some kind of like you know\nthe like environment like the office\nwhere there are people like inside jokes\nand you all like go to the break room\nand like hang out a little bit and like\nthe other kinds of like you know petty\noffice politics like if you want that\nkind of stuff then you know to look for\nthat next time around so the next time\nwhen you're looking for a job you're not\ngoing to take the first thing that comes\nalong because you need to leave your job\nyou can start to think a little bit\nabout okay do i want to work with people\nor not\nnext thing to kind of think a little bit\nabout is what is the boss like\nis the boss hands-on\nmost people may think oh my god hands-on\nboss that sounds terrible\nother people\nor is the boss like completely afk\nand what are you looking for are you\nlooking for a boss that's going to sort\nof serve as a little bit more like a\nmentor is going to help you when you're\ndown because i i've seen both of these\npeople may assume okay hands-on bosses\nand it's kind of interesting because\nwhat you resonate with is going to be\nwill will sort of tell you a lot so if\nthe idea of a hands-on boss is\nterrifying to you\nchances are you want more autonomy at\nwork\nokay so when you're looking for a job\nyou can even ask people like so what's\nyou know what is the can you tell me a\nlittle bit about what like what\nsupervision oversight and learning\nprocesses am i going to be acting\nsomewhat independently or you know do i\nwork with a team or like what's the kind\nof environment because even in in places\nlike corner quote debt and jobs these\ncan be very different\nso are you working the late shift are\nyou working the early shift or like you\nknow what's going on because those can\nbe they can be very very different\nso you in one the boss may be like boss\nmay work from nine to five but place is\nopen from like four to ten and so do you\nwant to overlap with the boss or not\noverlap with the boss you can sort of\nadjust some some of the things there and\nif your boss is super afk and if you\nknow what i'm talking about you know\nwhat i'm talking about these are places\nwhere like some people may be terrified\nby a hands-on boss but some people are\nterrified of an afk boss\nwhere it's like i kind of showed up so i\nwent to a conference recently a youth\nmental health summit in california\nand i was talking to someone who is a\npediatric\npediatric\nbehavioral specialist\ni think something like that\nso these people like worked for the\nstate of california and would do like\nbasically like do the social work\ninterventions\nand they were like completely on their\nown they go through a two-day training\nand then\nthey just get sent out into the field\nand they're like driving like like you\nshow up on day one of your job it's a\nmonday you sit in a classroom for eight\nhours you go home you show up on tuesday\nmorning you sit in a classroom for eight\nhours on day three they give you an\naddress and they tell you go here and\nhelp this person\nand you're kind of like left with no\noversight\nso what kind of oversight or boss\nrelationship that you do you wanna\nfine\nokay next thing because these are huge\nsources of misery\nthird\nyou know i guess this is subtopics\nthird thing that we're going to talk\nabout\nin terms of sources of misery\nis variety versus\nconsistency\nso what do you want from your job do you\nwant your job to be like different every\nday and this is where once again if\nyou're listening to this and you're like\nwho wouldn't want variety like of course\ni want variety like variety is the spice\nof life like\ni don't want to do the same crap over\nand over and over and over and over\nagain\nso people who dislike variety or want\nless variety they don't use the word\nvariety to describe their job the word\nthat they use is chaos\nbecause things are so disorganized\nthere's so much variety there's no\nconsistency people are showing up at\nrandom times people are leaving at\nrandom times stuff doesn't get done work\ndoesn't get a sign like it's it's\nnothing is organized at all\nright so people who like variety won't\nconsider that chaos but someone who\nlikes consistency likes routine look i'm\nhappy to work i just want to show up on\ntime i want to do my job i'm happy to do\na good job at my job i don't have to\nworry about i don't want to worry about\nall this other crap i don't need to\nworry about all this other crap you guys\nfocus on that crap i'm gonna i'm gonna\nbuild my widgets because that's what i\nenjoy doing\nso these are the kinds of dimensions\nthat you need to think about so like\nwhat is it that makes you miserable at\nyour job is it a particular co-worker is\nit that your job is too regimented is it\nthat your boss is afk is it that your\nboss is not afk is your boss\nmicromanaging and also is like remoting\ninto your computer and can control your\nmouse like a hacker\ndo you like to work with people or do\nyou like to not work with people and i\nmean these will make huge differences in\nterms of the misery of your job\nso if you're leaving then you need to\nthink about these dimensions ahead of\ntime instead of randomly going to\nanother job\nright oh i didn't like working at\nwendy's let me go try mcdonald's\nand then like you're at mcdonald's for a\nwhile and you're like okay this sucks\nmaybe i don't like fast food so you go\nwork at a clothing store but actually\nwhat you realize is like i don't like\nworking with people and and doing the\nsame crap over and over and over again\nokay so you have to think about what\nmakes you miserable at the job and as\nyou think about what makes you miserable\nat the job\nthink critically about it then you can\nstart to shape your future\nin a in a more positive way\nokay\nnow\nnext thing\ndiagnose\nyour pleasure\nso even if you have the worst job on the\nplanet\nthere's a decent chance\nthat there's something about your job\nthat you will like\nthere's something about your job that is\nactually okay\nmaybe if you've got the worst job on the\nplanet there's nothing who knows\nbut generally speaking\neven the worst job has some parts that\nare okay so there's a very simple\nexercise that you can do to sort of\nfigure out if i ask you this question\nand you're like you know what do you\nlike about your job and you're like\nabsolutely nothing i hate every single\naspect of it that by the way is this\nblack and white thinking\nright\nchances are\nthat's that's gonna really mess you up\nbecause if you can't even think\ncritically and nuanced about your job\nyou can't even navigate towards the\nthings that you actually enjoy in your\njob and if you're blind to what you\nenjoy in your job how on earth are you\ngoing to move in the right direction\ninto finding the right career for\nyourself or finding the right job for\nyourself and then what happens is you're\ngonna get stuck in this cycle\nso i understand that your initial\nreaction totally fine\ni don't like anything about my job\ntotally fine i'm so sorry to hear that\nlet me ask you something\nif i could remove 90 of your job\nwhat's the 10 that you would keep\nif i could get rid of 90 of what you do\nwhat's the 10 percent that you would\nchoose to do tell me why\ntell me a little bit about that\nwhat makes you enjoy that because\nchances are even the the worst job and\ni've had all kinds of jobs okay i my\nfirst job was serving ice cream\ni've built a photo bioreactor at a\nbiofuel startup\ni've\nyou know worked as a clinician obviously\nlike as a doctor\ni've done research at like three\ndifferent institutions\none in india two in the united states\ni've been a camp counselor like i've\ndone all kinds of crap you know i i'm\nnot saying i have the most diverse job\nexperience i've never been a web\ndeveloper or anything like that\nyou know but i i've worked a fair number\nof random jobs before i went to medical\nschool trying to figure out what to do\nwith myself\nand so in each of those jobs even making\nice cream there were certain things that\ni liked about it which we'll talk about\nin a second\nbut this is also really important to\nthink about okay what do you like about\nyour job even the 10 that you do like\nabout it and then that way you can sort\nof\nyou know look for that stuff going\nforward oh so what i really like about\nmy job is that there's like a you know a\ncouple hours during the day that like i\nget to kind of be by myself\nand even though i have to open i've\ngotta i can turn on my audiobook and i'm\nlistening to an audiobook where i'm like\nprepping all the food and and chopping\nand stuff like that and like that's\npretty that's actually my favorite part\nof the day okay so it sounds like you\nreally like some amount of time where\nthere's some amount of autonomy and you\nknow like simple labor that you can do\nand maybe if you could like listen to an\naudiobook like okay cool makes sense\nso you also want to diagnose what you\nenjoy about your job and then what you\ncan do is gravitate towards that in the\nnext job\nokay\nnext thing\nif you're miserable at your job super\npractical advice\njobs\nare not\nstatic\nhuge huge huge\nmis\nunderstanding about jobs so most people\nwhen we enter the workforce assume that\nthe job is what we do\nright so if you're like an 18 year old\nkid or 22 year old kid or whatever\nyou're at your first job especially\nbecause of the power dynamic and stuff\nyou don't think that there's anything\nabout your job that can be changed turns\nout\nmost jobs can be modified in some way\nshape or form so i'll give you all just\nthis example i was talking about doing\nice cream right so my first job was\nserving ice cream\nso i worked at this place called marble\nslab\nand so uh the owners it was a you know\nsmall town and so the owners like i was\nserving ice cream and the owners started\nme off in the afternoon shift because in\ntheir experience\nthe afternoon was the busiest\nand so you got the most tips in the\nafternoon so most young kids who are\nlooking to make money that's why you get\na job right\nthey wanted to work in the afternoon and\nthat that way you made the most tips and\nso if you're working one hour instead of\ngetting paid\ni think i got paid i want to say like\nmaybe\nuh\nmaybe five dollars an hour or something\nwhen i was working i don't remember\nexactly what minimum wage was it's\nminimum wage plus tips\nand so i started off working in the\nafternoon\nand it was like me and like one other\nperson we like split the tips and so i'd\nmake like a couple more bucks an hour\nyou know i'd make like eight bucks an\nhour instead of like 5 25 or or whatever\nand so they just sort of assume that\nthat's because that's what most of the\nyoung kids did it's busy\nowner would come in early in the morning\nthey would open up and then you know\nthey would kind of go home like around\nthe time that things got super busy\nand so\nthat's kind of what\nwas assumed and so i i kind of like i\ndidn't really like working during the\nbusy times i found that the actual money\nthat i got was not that much more people\nwere cheap tippers i didn't always get\neight bucks an hour sometimes it was\nlike you know 625 instead of five bucks\nan hour or something like that so the\ntips like i'd work for eight hours and\ni'd make like maybe like\nsomewhere between\nfive and ten extra dollars for eight\nhours of my time which i just didn't\nfeel like was a good use of my time\nso i asked the boss i was like okay so\nlike you know is there\nany way i could like open you know and\nthe boss is like sure i mean like you\nhave to learn some things and i like\nokay please god\nteach me something like let me at least\nlearn how to make ice cream like that's\npretty cool like let me learn how to\nmake ice cream yeah let me like i'd love\nto learn how to make ice cream i already\nknow how to make the waffle cones\nbecause we have to do that as we run out\ni'd love to tell around to make ice\ncream it turns out that if you work at\nan ice cream place making ice cream\nisn't that hard they've got a machine\nyou put in a bunch of cream\nyou add some flavor\nchop up some strawberries and toss it in\nthere turn the machine on and then empty\nthe machine into a thing and then stick\nit in a freezer\nand then you move it from one freezer to\nthe next freezer\nit's pretty cool like i made ice cream\nand so what i really loved is like\nopening actually the boss is like\nfantastic like okay so wait\nso now that this kid is opening\ni don't even have to come to work until\nlike noon boss loves that\nkid is gonna you have to accept\ndeliveries you've got to make the ice\ncream you got to open you've got to get\neverything ready you're gonna have to\nshow up two hours before we open up and\ni'm like great\nbecause then what happened is like i\nstarted getting really good at i was\nlike all right cool so like i'm showing\nup two hours before opening because i\nhave to do all this kind of stuff\nand like the boss would also do\nbookkeeping and stuff during that time\nright so i got super efficient at it\nwould start my making my ice cream would\naccept my deliveries or whatnot i'd pull\nout\na book\nand i'd read\nfor like half an hour here half an hour\nthere i'm getting paid for that like\nthat's great\ni'd make some waffle cones\nyou know\nand then like things would open up and\nthings were like pretty quiet like you\nknow the store would open up i'd show up\nat eight place would open at ten who\ngets ice cream at like 10 a.m on a\nweekday\nlike not that many people i get a\ncustomer like one customer every half\nhour\nso most of the time i'm just kind of\nlike sitting on my ass which is\nfantastic\nso this was way better and then things\nstart to get busy around i'd work from\nlike eight to three\nor eight to four so i'd be like super\nbusy for one hour between three and four\nmake a couple of tips and then at the\nend of the day you know i'd go home\nmy point here is that if you ask you can\nactually adjust some things of your job\ni'm not saying that you can necessarily\nadjust everything\nokay\nnot saying that you can dictate what you\nwant to do\nbut you can ask and you can actually\nchange a couple of dimensions of your\njob and you can make your experience way\nbetter\nso if there's a particular part of your\njob that you don't like i wouldn't frame\nit as hey can i not do this\nso generally speaking bosses don't like\nthat so a more practical tip here is to\nask you know talk to your bosses a\nlittle bit about hey like\ni'm interested in learning more stuff or\nwhat is the morning shift like or like\nyou know try to be doing some like be\nwanting to learn something as opposed to\navoiding something but the same\ndifference\nright so you can say oh i love to learn\nhow to make ice cream like that sounds\npretty cool can you tell me about\nopening the back of my eye i'm like i\ndon't like dealing with customers\nright so there are modifications you can\nmake\nif you ask and if you ask nicely\nvery important tip\nunder under\nappreciated for people who are starting\nout\nlast thing that i'm going to share with\ny'all\nis don't suffer alone\nso there's a lot of research that shows\nthat\nwhen we struggle with something\nand we share it with other people\nsharing our struggles actually helps us\nin terms of\nlike managing our emotions and having a\npositive outlook and things like that\nso good examples of this is something\nthat we've known for a long time so a\nlot of times so historically like in in\nthe history of humanity so a lot of\ntimes a lot of community came through\nthings like religious organizations\nright that's a place where people like\nfunerals and things like that like\nceremonies where people would pass away\nthere's something healing about\nsuffering with other people or\ncommiserating with other people who are\nsuffering so good examples of this are\nfunerals\nthat take something that's let's just\ncall it an objectively bad experience\nand soften the blow some\nother examples of this are\nthings like the you know the sober\ngroups so like alcoholics anonymous\nnarcotics anonymous refuge recovery\nthings like that for people who aren't\ninto the aaa kind of religiosity\nwe can sort of get together and we can\ntalk about things and we can share\nthings and we can sort of like we can\nfeel better right so it's a huge part\nobviously of things like aoe healing\nwhich is what we do so it's on this\nprinciple which is by the way very\nscientifically validated\nand there's a good example of this stuff\nlike irvine yolum talks about this in\nhis his books on group psychotherapy\nwhere he like unpacks\nwhat is it that's therapeutic about a\ngroup setting and it turns out that it's\nnot some kind of clinical protocol it's\nthe fact that when human beings get\ntogether and they share their suffering\nit sort of alleviates it right this is\nalso why we have a group coaching\nprogram by the way\nso that's like you know we've sort of\nalso figured out that like when you\ncreate a space where people can come and\nshare their troubles and you have a\ncoach who facilitates that instead of\nturning into a cesspool of negativity\nwhich is sometimes what happens on the\ninternet\nwhich is you'll have these communities\nthat are sort of help seeking\ncommunities that can kind of become\nthese toxic cesspools\nand so how do you share negativity but\nalso\nas a group work your self out of it\nand so one of the modifications we made\nin our group coaching program was that\nwe added a coach\nright so if you think about an aaa\nmeeting a lot of people there will have\nexperience but it's essentially there's\nthere's no one with formal\nteaching at all\nso it's just peers so there's also peer\nsupport mental health services which\nhave been studied and stuff like that\nso the key thing here is that don't\nsuffer alone\nright so\nthis person kind of mentioned that there\nare people at work\nand i know plenty of people there who\nmake it worthwhile so i think this is\nwhere when we kind of think about our\nwork situation this person is sort of\nworking alone do you all get that do you\nfeel that from this\nwhere they're sort of like working all\nby themselves\nand so this is where i'd say reach out\nto someone and kind of ask someone so if\nyou're starting a new job here's some\nlanguage right so this is the kind of\nstuff that a coach would would help you\ndo\nso because you're like okay how do i\nreach out to someone no one's taught me\nhow to reach out to someone do i turn to\nsomeone who\nmake it worthwhile and then like i\nabsolutely despise this like how do i\ntalk to someone who seems to be enjoying\nthis when i don't really enjoy it\nright do it\nhow do you say that how do you open up\nthat conversation\nso here's what i'd say i'd approach that\nperson and say hey\num you know it seems like you're really\nawesome at this job and\nyou also seem to really enjoy it i'm\njust curious is that the case do you\nreally like like it here\nthen first of all you can sort of you\nknow just ask them a question you can\nask them what was it like when you\nstarted\nyou know what was your what were your\nfirst couple of weeks like\nright so you can ask them kind of an\nopen-ended question to sort of gauge\ntheir sort of experience it's a way to\nconnect with someone at work and they'll\nsay oh yeah first couple weeks are\nalways rough right and you can say yeah\ni've i really feel in that you know it's\nit's a lot\nand then you can even ask hey he's like\ndo you have any tips for someone who's\njust starting out and they're like\nabsolutely here let me teach you a\ncouple things that will make things\neasier for you or they'll say yeah it's\nalways rough and then you'll kind of\nhave a laugh about it maybe the next day\nat work they're like hey hey kid how you\ndoing\nright so like you can start to form\nconnections\nand sometimes like we don't even know\nlike the language to open up that\nconversation because no one ever teaches\nus this\nand so this is where sometimes having a\nlittle bit of expertise can help right\nlike what do you say to someone at work\nbecause they don't teach us the stuff\nis that some people sort of like they\nkind of figure it out some people have\ngood modeling and things like that but\nthe key thing here is don't suffer alone\nso talk to other people at work\nand and you know this isn't about like\nyou know organizing and putting\neverything on strike and down with the\nbosses like i'm not talking i'm just\ntalking about just connect with another\nperson\ndon't suffer alone be like hey this is\nhard and i mean this is something that i\nunderstood really well in residency\nbecause residency is hard\nyou're working 80 hours a week\nyou're tired all the time you're not\ngetting paid very much\nyou know\nwe have a saying in in residency that\ncrap rolls downhill\nand so since you're at the bottom of the\ntotem pole is the intern you have to do\nall the skutt work\nso you've got to fill out all the\nprescriptions and you have to do all the\npaperwork and stuff like that you have\nto argue with the insurance company you\nhave to do all the the work\nthe bad work\nso the cool thing is that when i was in\nresidency most psychiatry residencies do\nthis we had a 90-minute session once a\nweek that was organized by our residency\nwhere we would all get together in a\nroom and we would sort of like\ncommiserate around what the experience\nof being residents in residency was like\nwhat do we like about it what do we not\nlike about it what's hard about it that\nwas also facilitated\nand we were a psychiatry residency so it\nwas facilitated by a psychiatrist\num\nand so like don't suffer alone\nso i know that oftentimes like you know\nyou'll be in this situation which is\nlike i'm miserable at my job\nhow do i not be miserable at my job\nand the first instinct may be oh just\nget a different job\nthe problem is that if you just jump to\na different job and you don't really\nunderstand why you're miserable in the\nfirst place\nyou may just jump to another miserable\njob and then it's miserable job after\nmiserable job after miserable job after\nmiserable job\nso if you're looking\nat okay how do i be less miserable there\nare actually a couple of general things\nthe first two things we're going to talk\nabout is two particular thoughts which\nare born of misery but also propagate\nmisery\nand as we we become aware of those\nthoughts as we think about them\ncritically as we sort of shape our\nthinking\nwe can start to be a little bit more\nconstructive even about our job\nexperience\nand if we have this thought there's no\npoint no actually there's there's some\nvaluable experience here there's there's\nactually a lot of like good stuff like\ni'm really glad i worked\nyou know serving ice cream\nso like that taught me a lot about what\nto appreciate\nabout my future jobs and what to look\nfor it also taught me that i like\nautonomy at work like i like to be sort\nof left alone and do my own thing i\ndon't want someone breathing over my my\nneck\nso another thing to keep in mind is that\nespecially if you're early on it may not\nget easy but you'll get better at it\nright so if we think about a classic rpg\nyou start off fighting level one mobs\nand then\ndoes the mob become a level zero mob and\nthen the future mobs become level\nnegative one\nlevel negative five\nlevel negative 50 no\nyou level up\nyou get better at it it doesn't\nnecessarily get easier even now i'm not\nsure that my life today is easier than\neven it was in residency there's a lot\nof stuff that made my life really easy\nin residency even though i was working a\nton\nso you'll get better at it so have some\nfaith in yourself\nnext thing is we talk about this sort of\num\nthinking critically what does that mean\nthat means diagnosing the source of your\nmisery in the source of your pleasure if\nthere's any at work\nand so the next time you look for a job\nstart to think a little bit about okay\nlike what do i want to move towards like\nwhat do i need to move into what do i\nwant to avoid for my next job and then\nwhat's going to happen is you don't like\njob number one\nbut then job number two you've got two\nchoices right you can get a circle or\nyou can get a square\nand you're like oh you know what i\ndefinitely don't want a circle okay let\nme try a square okay well now i've got\ntwo choices i've got circle over here i\ncould always go back to a circle i've\ngot a square over here or i can get a\ntriangle\nlet me try a triangle oh actually this\nis pretty good now i've got\nthis kind of triangle\nright an isosceles triangle or an\nequilateral triangle okay like let me\ntry the isosceles triangle\nright\nbut this doesn't happen if you're just\nmindlessly jumping from one job to\nanother\nso you have to think a little bit about\nokay what are the dimensions of this job\nthat make it miserable\nwhat are the dimensions of this job that\ni enjoy\nanother thing that they don't really\ntell you is that a lot of jobs are\nactually flexible\nif you ask politely and there's some\nflexibility your boss may actually\naccommodate you\nand so jobs are not necessarily static\nso you may be able to\nyou know swap work with someone you can\nsay hey i actually don't mind like\ncleaning\nbut i really don't like working with\ncustomers so how about i do all the you\nknow\ni do all the mopping and sweeping and\nyou man the front for a little bit\nand maybe if you don't like customers\nyou can do that\nthe last thing is that we know\nto not suffer alone\na ton of research that shows that\ncommiserating with our our with other\npeople\nis actually really really important in\nterms of like forming connections and\nin terms of reducing misery\nand this is something that we've seen\nwe've done it in psychiatry training\nwe know it works in group psychotherapy\nsettings we also do this in our group\ncoaching program right where we like\nshare\nproblems but a big part of our group\ncoaching program is we sort of recognize\nthat sharing problems is not enough\ni mean sometimes it's enough but we also\nhave it facilitated by a coach who sort\nof will also help you all facilitate\naccountability and things like that so\nwe have all that kind of stuff baked in\nthere because one of the things that i\nfound that was a little bit unfortunate\nabout\ngroup psychotherapy was that there\nreally oftentimes weren't goals\nright so if you like think about like a\ngroup psychotherapy that's oriented\ntowards ptsd i guess the goal is\nclinical improvement but\nyou know people wouldn't work on a\nweek-to-week basis about okay like if i\nhave ptsd how do i form a healthy\nrelationship going forward\nright so if i have body dysmorphia how\ndo i develop like a healthy exercise\nplan oftentimes that component of like\naccountability and progress was like\nmissing in psychotherapy\nbut this is something that's been very\nwell researched everything from funerals\nto even our aoe healing all this kind of\nstuff is really important so if you're\nat a job and you're miserable don't\nsuffer alone\nyou"
