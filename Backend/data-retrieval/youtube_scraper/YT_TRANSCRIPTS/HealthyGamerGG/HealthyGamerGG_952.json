    "transcript": "so this is important to understand why\ndo human beings experience negative\nemotions it's because they're actually\nvery powerful motivators they tend to be\nthe strongest and easiest motivators but\nthey're kind of like dirty motivators\nthey're like burning unclean fuel\ni keep rewarding my brain by daydreaming\nabout my end goal without actually\nworking towards it\ni have this issue where i keep relying\non external motivation as fuel to propel\nme forward fantasies of grandiosity\nwhere i'm infinitely better than the\nperson who rejected me romantically and\nmaking them realize what they lost\nor proving my worth to people who took\nme for granted\nrighteous justice\ni know this sounds like covert\nnarcissism\nnot so covert i might as well be one\nnon-diagnosed i wouldn't jump that far\nso we all have you know ego defense\nmechanisms so we all that's just a\nnormal part of the human mind\ni i think what's fundamentally flawed\nwithin my mind is the belief that no one\ncould ever love or appreciate me if i'm\nnot interesting enough the general\nadvice is to just focus on\nself-improvement and somehow that's\ngoing to meet all of my emotional needs\ni tried to set deadlines for my goals\nbut sadly now i feel only anxious\nbecause i'm not putting in the work and\nas a result i return to escapist\nbehavior which includes daydreaming\nat the end i find myself stuck in a loop\nwhere i have a goal in mind i work on my\ngoal for one day it starts to feel\noverwhelming because i'm super depressed\nand no one wants to give me attention\ni revert back to escapism and fantasize\nabout the life i i'll never have due to\nmy laziness then i resent myself for not\nputting in effort and compare myself to\nother people's achievement which acts\nlike a catalyst and motivates me for\nanother day or two\ni know dr k has talked about daydreaming\ni'm aware of it now but i have yet to\nfind a solution to my problem how do i\nstop worrying too much about how\nuninteresting i come across and just\nfocus on my hobbies that i once enjoyed\nregardless of the outcome\nso this is kind of a\nreally good post because this is a case\nof someone who's done some of the work\nright so most of us when we struggle\nwith a problem we're not starting from\nzero\nwe sort of recognize a couple of things\nwe recognize for example that\ndaydreaming is maladaptive\nwe recognize that\nthere are certain techniques we can use\nfor example like set goals for yourself\nand sort of focus on those goals\nwe also have learned as a community\nto introspect some right so\nthis person has also done some\nintrospective work and realized oh i\nhave this like fundamental flaw within\nmy mind that\nno one will appreciate me or love me\nunless i'm interested enough so we've\nstarted to do some work as a community\nwhich is awesome\nat the same time this can be like really\nchallenging because learning some of\nthese nuggets doesn't fix your problem\nright so like this is the basic problem\nwith like daydreaming which is that okay\ni feel bad about myself\ni daydream in some sort of grandiose way\nthat sort of makes me feel like\nrighteous and good right like it makes\nme feel like emotionally good the\nproblem is that like then i don't\nactually change my life because i'm\nstuck in this dream\nand then like time goes by and then a\nday has gone by and i haven't actually\nmoved forward and then i start beating\nmyself up\nright i start to feel resentful for\nmyself instead of actually doing\nanything about my problems i'm just\ndreaming about fixing my problems\nand sometimes that resentment\nsome kind of negative emotion can even\nspur some kind of action right so for a\nday or two\ni get so frustrated with myself that i\nchannel that frustration i use it as\nfuel to propel me forward for a day or\ntwo and i work\ni'm tired of this never again\nbut then that emotion fizzles\nand my motivation fizzles with it\nand then i feel bad about myself and\nthen i daydream and then the cycle\nrepeats\nso how do we break out of this\nokay like this is what we have to figure\nout\nso we're gonna do is is sort of give you\nall three very concrete steps\nabout how to break out of this cycle of\ndaydreaming setting a goal\nsort of moving towards the goal sort of\ngetting frustrated with yourself about\nmoving towards the goal not it not being\nenough\nscrapping the goal being resentful\nbeating yourself up like how do we break\nout of this cycle so we're going to\ntackle this in three different ways\nand the key thing is that the third\nthing that we're going to talk about i\nthink is something that's grossly\ngrossly misunderstood or missed so a lot\nof us have awareness that okay there's\nlike some kind of negative emotion here\ni need to deal with the negative emotion\ni've yet to find a solution how do i\nstop worrying about how to become\nuninteresting right so we'll sort of\nfigure out okay how do i stop worrying\nso much and how do i just act how do i\nfocus on my hobbies regardless of the\noutcome we know that we need to do those\nthings\nbut we don't really know how and it\nturns out that we tend to miss one\nreally really really crucial step of\nthis process\noftentimes okay so let's try to\nunderstand the cycle\nand the process that goes with it\nokay\nso\nfirst thing to consider\nlet's start by understanding\nkind of scientifically the cycle of the\ndaydream\nso i feel bad about myself i have\nnegative emotion\nand then i daydream\nand what happens to my emotional state\nafter i daydream\nit becomes positive emotion\nright\nbecause now it's like grandiose i feel\ngood about myself there i am kind of\nlike laying in bed at night\ngrinning to myself i'll show them one\nday you know all these people all\nrealize this\nokay\nso it's kind of interesting the first\nthing to understand is that daydreaming\nis actually like a coping mechanism it's\nan emotional coping mechanism\nso the tricky thing here is that when we\nwant to stop worrying too much\nour brain is like oh your goal is to\nstop worrying too much\nfantastic\ni have an awesome option for you so\nlet's say i have some kind of negative\nemotion and i'm unsatisfied with myself\nlet's say i'm unsatisfied with my\nphysical appearance\nokay so there's negative emotion here\ni've got two options i can do a lot of\nhard work\nokay\nand then\ni'm gonna add a caveat here and then\nmaybe at the end of the hard work i'll\nfeel good about myself\nokay or what i can do\nis daydream\nand then what i can do is feel good\nabout myself right now\nso our brain has a choice\nboth there are two roads to positive\nemotion\none is daydreaming and one is doing\nsomething about it right but which one's\neasier which one's more efficient\nit's like kind of think think about it\nthis way i mean like you know if you\nwant to get water you don't\nwalk a mile to your friend's house to\nget a glass of water you go to your\nkitchen or your sink or whatever and you\nget water from there\nyour brain automatically takes the\neasiest path\nnow there's another really important\npoint to consider here\nwhich is that there's an assumption that\nhard work will lead to\npositive emotion and progress and\nfeeling good about myself but if we\nactually look at this scenario\ni work on my goal for one day and it\nstarts to feel overwhelming\nokay interesting so when you work\ntowards your goal you feel overwhelmed i\nresent myself for not putting enough\neffort which acts like a\ncatalyst and motivates me for a day or\ntwo\nso now if we're actually like if we're\nscientific about it\nwhat does hard work actually do if i\nwork for one day\nif i do work for one day how do i feel\nat the end of it i feel overwhelmed\nthis is what we assume happens\nbut if we actually look at our\nexperience\nthese are the choices that we have\nand our brain is like you can work for a\nday get nothing accomplished feel\noverwhelmed and feel\nnegative emotion\nfeel resentment\nand then that in turn is going to go\nover here\nand reinforce this\nso which path do you think your brain is\ngoing to take\nit's going to take this path\neasy\nright\nbecause if we actually look if we use\nexperimental data instead of our mind\nwhat we'll observe\nis that even working towards our goals\ncan sometimes create negative emotion\nand then we get confused like oh my god\nwhy am i daydreaming all the time it's\nthis simple\nright just look at yourself and you'll\nfind this cycle\nso so a couple of other things about\ndaydreaming second thing to understand\nso here i am\nin the present\nand i'm feeling bad about myself\nand when i daydream\ni go to the future\nfuture time one year in the future\nand here i'm happy i am triumphant\nand i feel good about myself\nand so the interesting thing is when so\nthis person\ndid the right thing they're like okay so\nif i want to get from here to here what\ni have to do is set a goal so let me set\na goal\nright let me work towards my goals\nso i'm over here\nas i'm working towards my goals\nwhat tends to happen\nnow if my goal is based on a fantasy if\nit's based on the daydream\nthat goal is very very very far away\nand if the goal is very very very far\naway\none day\nof effort\nis just right here\nit doesn't substantially move me towards\nmy goal\nright so there's something else kind of\ninteresting happens we touched on this\nyesterday and we've talked about it\nbefore but\nif my goal is up here and i'm over here\nand this is how far i move\nthe gap is huge\nthere's very little positive\nreinforcement\nfor my brain\nright\nso this is why people say like you know\nhave goals that are kind of like\nbite-sized you want to sort of reduce\nthe size of your goals\nthey're they're this is really important\nto understand\nbecause if we're basing our goals based\non daydreams those are going to be\npretty unrealistic goals and are going\nto\nset us up\nfor a lack of positive reinforcement\neven when we make progress\nbecause like look at this for a second\ni work on my goal for a day and it\nstarts to feel overwhelming like what\nlike how are we gonna reinforce this\nkind of behavior\nlike how are we gonna work for two days\nif working on my goal for one day is\noverwhelming\nso what's kind of interesting is like\nsetting a goal that you can accomplish\nin one day\nthen there's no progress there's no need\nto be overwhelmed because you're done\nright\nthat's it\nso how do we tackle this problem now\nthat we've sort of figured out we have\ntwo basic problems the first is that\ndaydreaming\nis an emotional\ncoping mechanism\nand daydreaming also anchors us\nin the future\nso this is kind of interesting\nbut\nif we want to break out of this cycle\nonce we understand the pathophysiology\nof it if we understand what daydreaming\nis how it works our answer actually\nbecomes somewhat clear\nthe first\nis that this\nis the wrong goal\nbecause if your goal is to stop worrying\nthen\ndaydreaming is the answer\ninstead what we need to do number one\nis be able to tolerate negative emotion\nvery very important right so develop\nsome kind of alternate coping mechanism\nso instead of\ni don't know if this kind of makes sense\nbut like\nsometimes in life\nwe're buffeted by our negative emotions\nand our negative emotions control our\nbehaviors\nthey create avoidance\nwe don't want to feel those negative\nemotions so we start avoiding all kinds\nof things\nand so as long as we set our goal is\nstop worrying or no longer feel anxious\nor like the elimination of negative\nemotion we lose control of our lives\njust surrender control entirely to the\nnegative emotion because then what\nhappens is if that's the goal is no more\nnegative emotion the only things that\nyou can do are the things that move you\naway from negative emotion and this is\nhow you get stuck in the trap of\ndaydream\nso this is kind of interesting but it's\nsort of like\neven this person's like\nnegative emotions sometimes motivate\nthem in the right way so this is\nimportant to understand why do human\nbeings experience negative emotions it's\nbecause they're actually very powerful\nmotivators they tend to be the strongest\nand easiest motivators but they're kind\nof like dirty motivators\nthey're like burning unclean fuel\nokay\nso instead of trying to fix your\nnegative emotion sit with it right so\nwe've taught a lot of meditation like\nthat's a very good example of\nyou know tolerating negative emotion so\nwhen you feel some kind of negative\nemotion i'm not saying and this may you\nmay so if you're listening to this\nyou're like but like there's too much of\nit\nright but then how do i fix all my\nproblems these are all the things that\nyour mind will start like what do you\nmean tolerate negative emotion like\nthat's not gonna make my dreams come\ntrue like tolerate it until when when\ndoes it end what i'm just supposed to\nsit and wallow in my negative emotion\nforever\nno that's that's your mind\nnot knowing what's gonna happen when you\nlearn to tolerate negative emotion\nlike you just don't know how to do that\nright so it's so intolerable you start\ndaydreaming to get rid of it you start\nplaying video games to get rid of it you\nget eye to get rid of it\nso you don't know how to tolerate it\nbecause it's it feels so intolerable\nso that's where like you sit for like 15\n20 minutes you meditate for a little\nwhile and what you'll tend to find is\nthat the negative emotion will go away\nit may be triggered again\nby something else but just learning to\nbe non-reactive\nto your negative emotions for at least a\nbrief period of time for one hour a day\nfor two hours a day will be very very\nrevolutionary for your life\nthen you're like how does it fix my\nproblems well we've sort of explored how\nall of your problems start with this\nso if we sort of if this stops becoming\na problem\nright then like this\nbecomes easier\nif we kind of like\nget overwhelmed and we don't let that\nfeeling of overwhelmness stop us from\nacting then we can continue to act and\nit's get it's pretty cool\nokay\nso number one is like learn to tolerate\nyour negative emotions you can do that\nthrough meditation we'll give you a\ncouple of other tips here\nsecond thing that's very important to do\nis adopt a present focus\nso remember\ngoals\nare in the future\nand if i have a goal that i've set up\nfor myself that's a year from now or two\nyears from now\nif i've got let's say\n800 days\nto get in shape\nwhat difference does it make\nif i don't exercise today\nnot much\nright oh i've still got 799 days to get\nin shape\nhow long does it take to get in shape i\ndon't know maybe six months eight months\nso i mean i could go down to\n400 days without making a single step\ntowards my goal and i've still got\nplenty of time\nso goals are things of the future\ngenerally\nright\nand so what you really need to do is is\ndon't focus on\nthis step\nthis phase of your life focus on this\nphase of your life\nwhat can i do today\nand just focus on that\nand this is where you've got to be\ncareful because all kinds of negative\nemotions will come up if you start\nfocusing on the present\nyou'll be like it won't be enough\nbut what if\nall kinds of thoughts what's the point\nwhat's the point of practicing piano for\none day\nwhat's cool is playing piano and busting\nit out and impressing everyone you see\nhow your mind automatically goes to that\nfantasy because once you start living in\nthe present once you start moving into a\npresent focus you're depriving of your\nmind of the ability to daydream\nand then your mind gets terrified and\nit's gonna fight you and it's gonna make\nyou feel bad\nbecause if it makes you feel bad\nwhat does it get to do\nyou're taking away your mind's crack and\nit ain't gonna like it\nand it's gonna try to punish you for it\ncause that's where you're gonna breathe\nyou're gonna meditate you're gonna focus\non what you can do today\nand so that's sort of where like if you\nwanna learn how to focus on the present\nthe key thing to understand is that your\nmind is going to tell you all kinds of\nstuff like it's not enough\nbut that's okay it doesn't need to be\nenough i'm just going to focus on what\ni'm going to do today and like that's my\ngoal and i'm sticking to it if it's not\nenough that's okay and then your mind is\nlike no but it's not okay because i want\nall these things i want these people to\nlove me and i want all those things\nthat's where you pause for a moment you\ntalk to your mind and you kind of say\ni understand that you want those things\ni hope that we'll get them all that\nstuff is fine for the other 10 hours of\ntoday we can worry about that stuff but\nfor the next two hours\nfor this two hours we're not going to\nworry about that i'm going to exercise\nfor 45 minutes i'm going to read for 45\nminutes and i'm going to clean for 30\nminutes\nthe rest of the next 10 hours i can\nworry about how it's not going to be\nenough\ni can\npanic for 10 hours i don't need to panic\nfor 12 hours a day 10 hours a day is\nsufficient\nso adopt a present focus\nand in terms of goals just focus on\nthings that you can accomplish today and\nnot even today focus on things that you\ncan accomplish within 15 minutes in 30\nminutes i'm gonna do one pomodoro of\nstudying\nso be very very present focused\nso this is important\nbecause\ni don't know if like this kind of makes\nsense but i've worked with so\nback when i was doing primarily clinical\nwork i was mostly an addiction\npsychiatrist\nand so i'd have patients who would come\nin\nand people who wanted to get sober\ntwo kinds of people who want to get\nsober\npeople who want to be sober for a year\nand people who want to be sober for a\nday\nmy goal is to be one year clean\nand generally speaking what i found is\nthat people who focused on being sober\ntoday\nwere much more successful than people\nwho were trying to be sober for one year\nbecause you can't be sober for a year\nit's literally impossible there's\nnothing you can do\nto be sober for a year\nbeing sober for a year is an emergent\nproperty\nit is not something that is actually\ncreated it is something that is built up\nover time and that you can't actually do\nall you can do is be sober right now\nall you can do is not take that drink in\nthis moment that's really all you can do\nand in the next moment you cannot take\nthe next drink and in the next moment\nyou cannot take the next string but\nliterally the only thing that exists is\nthe present\nand so once people realize and then it's\nthe ones who are like okay yay i did it\ni'm sober for a year\ni accomplished my goal\nand what do you think happens over the\nnext month\nthey relapse\nbecause they did it right the battle is\nover we won\neasy\nwe're going to hang up our weapons we're\ngoing to chill we're going to take off\nour armor we succeeded\nwhereas the person who recognizes that\nthis is a battle that i'll have to fight\nevery single day\nis the one that actually wins\nso what is this this is a present focus\nand we need to adopt this especially for\nunhealthy coping mechanisms like\ndaydreaming\nnumber three\nso this is the thing that people miss\nso as we look at this\ndiagram\nwhat we see is that we're reinforcing\nall the wrong behavior\nthis positive emotion that we experience\nactually reinforces the daydreaming\nthe hard work that we actually do makes\nus feel overwhelmed and\ncreates sort of like a a punishment\nactually this is it's not negative\nreinforcement it's punishment\naccording to the terms of classical\nconditioning\nbecause if we work hard what do we do we\nfeel overwhelmed and if we daydream what\ndo we do we feel good\nso one of these leads to a punishment\nand one of them leads to a reinforcement\nso the other problem with this whole\ncycle\nis that we're reinforcing the wrong\nthings we have an altered reinforcement\nand let's go back to the case\nso\nat the end of the day\nstuck in a loop where i have a goal in\nmind\nwork on the goal for one day it starts\nto feel overwhelming\nright\nacts like a catalyst with which\nmotivates me for a day or two so all the\nwrong stuff is being reinforced here\nso there's one thing that we need to\nstart doing\nwhich is how to sort of\nbuild on our successes\nso all of these problems that people\nhave we always focus on fixing the\nnegative we want to take away the\nnegative we want to stop worrying how do\ni do this how do i do this we're always\nfocused on\navoiding the pain removing the negative\nand like\nfixing the problem\nwhat we don't ever do is positive\nreinforcement\nor\nreinforce\nthe positive\nso i'll give you just an example\nat the end of that one day of work that\nyou've done\nwhat do you do cognitively before you go\nto bed\ndo you feel good about yourself\ndo you even bother to reflect on the day\ncan you take a step back and say hey\ngood job\ni know it feels like i haven't gone far\nenough but at least today was a win\nmaybe i need to duplicate today but like\ni can actually like be proud of what i\naccomplished today\ndo you guys get any sense of any kind of\npositive reflection\nin any of this post\nall i see here is self-loathing\nright i think what's fundamentally\nflawed within my mind is the belief that\nno one could ever love or appreciate me\nbecause if i'm not interesting enough no\nwhat's flawed in your mind is that you\ndon't think you're interesting enough so\nthen what you have to do is come up with\nlike all these hobbies that you're good\nat to impress people because\nintrinsically you don't see the worth\nand you can see it like the way that\nthis person beats themselves up with\nevery sentence\ny'all see that\nand there's there's no positive\nreinforcement there's no appreciation\nwhich acts as a catalyst and motivates\nme for another day or two this is not a\nsuccess in this person's mind i work on\nmy goal for one day that's not a success\nthat's a failure\nand when progress becomes a failure in\nour mind that's when we're truly screwed\nso what we've got to do is spend some\ntime reflecting on the positive at least\nacknowledge our wins no matter how small\nthey will be\nbecause right now we're recording our\nwins in the l column\nwork for a day is that a win or a loss\nit's a loss because i only worked for\none day\ni got motivated i worked for one to two\ndays is that a win or a loss that's a\nloss because i only worked for one or\ntwo days well what would a win be well\nif i worked for 365 days in a row that\nwould be a win\nyou'll see this\nso this is something that people don't\ndo often enough\nit's completely absent\nhow do i stop daydreaming well there are\ndays that you stop daydreaming\nright there are days that one day that\nyou get something done\na couple of days that you feel motivated\nso you can acknowledge all that negative\nstuff but at least spend a few moments\nto reinforce the positive\nat the end of the day say hey i don't\nknow if this is going to be enough who\nknows what frame of mind i'll wake up in\ntomorrow\nbut at least today i can be proud of\nwhat i did\nand notice how your mind is like what on\nearth like we'll rebel against that\nthought\nno no no no no\nwhat do you mean how can you be proud of\nnot accomplishing anything\nyou didn't accomplish anything your goal\nisn't met you haven't achieved the\nfantasies that i've created for you\nand then this person wonders\nthat i once enjoyed regardless of the\noutcome that is how you do it regardless\nof the outcome\ndo you see that like literally you train\nyour mind your mind says that's not\nenough and you say okay who cares\ni don't care\ni did a good job today there's something\ni can be proud of today\nso whenever so this is key thing so\noftentimes we get stuck in this cycle of\nlike\nburst of motivation followed by like\nwhat period of wallowing in our despair\nand the problem is that even when we\nhave the burst of motivation we don't\nreinforce that in any way shape or form\nall we think about is how do i get rid\nof the despair how do i get rid of the\nspare how do i get rid of the spare\npart of getting rid of the despair is\nacknowledging when you do have some win\nno matter how small and say you know\nwhat good job bro\ngood job girl\nyou did it\nit's not enough that's okay\nit may not be enough but like at least\ntoday i can be proud of what i\naccomplish and then your mind is like\nbut you didn't accomplish anything\neven if i didn't accomplish anything i\nstill moved forward towards my goal i\ndid not spend the whole day daydreaming\nthat's a win i did not spend a whole day\nplaying a video game or binging\nstranger things on netflix or whatever\nthere's something i can be proud of\ntoday and watch your mind as it rebels\nagainst that thought\nand as you do this especially\nyour life will start to change\nbecause these kinds of things like this\nis built up in a moment\nlike it's like moments in\nyour mind of war\nsubtle subtle war where your mind tries\nto convince you and you have to start\nwinning those battles\nmoment by moment by moment my moment by\nmoment\nso it's a very common problem that\npeople will daydream\ntoo much\nand then you don't actually you think\nabout you build all these goals for\nyourself and you don't actually move\ntowards the goals\ninstead of what you do is you think\nabout the goals\nand then we get stuck in the cycle of\nlike\nyou know daydreaming about this goal not\nmoving towards the goal feeling\nresentful towards ourselves as we become\nresentful we'll get like this burst of\nangry motivation that wears off in a day\nor two and then we're kind of stuck back\ndown square one and then like the cycle\nrepeats\nso what do you do about this\nfirst thing is to understand the nature\nof daydreaming\nto understand that negative emotions\nare hard to tolerate\nand one way that we cope with them is we\ndaydream\nbecause when i'm feeling bad about\nmyself and i think about how awesome the\nfuture is going to be in my dreams i\nstart to feel good about myself\nyay\nsecond thing to understand about\ndaydreaming is that it takes us to the\nfuture right it's not that's the whole\npoint\nis we're not stuck in this horrible\npresent\nwhere we're not doing anything and not\naccomplish anything where people don't\nvalue us and things like that\nso like we love to be in the future\nbecause the present sucks and the future\nis a beautiful place that i can can\nconstruct with my mind and i can make it\nwhatever i want because it's a fantasy\nhow do you break out of this problem\nfirst thing is like stop running away\nfrom the negative\nlearn to tolerate your negative emotion\nwhat do you mean by tolerate it that\njust means don't give in to whatever the\ndefault action of your negative emotion\nis for some period of time\nhalf an hour an hour\nso i recently started doing this thing\njust\njust to practice what i preach and i've\nstopped taking my phone into the\nbathroom\nno more phones in the bathroom\nit's like oh my god what am i gonna do\nfor those five minutes that i'm using\nthe restroom or even 60 seconds that i'm\nusing the restroom\nwhat am i gonna do oh my god\nand you survive it it's like not that\nbad\nright\nthe other thing is when i take my phone\nin the bathroom i'm there for like 15\nminutes\ni don't need to be there for 15 minutes\nso learn to tolerate negative emotion\nsecond thing is start living in the\npresent\nfocus on the present focus on today\nthird thing this is the thing that\npeople miss the most\nis actually like acknowledge your\npositives at the end of the day\nreinforce that say hey like this is\nactually something like\ni may not have moved a significant\namount towards my goal because your mind\nis going to tell you all this kind of\ncrap but at least i did something\ni didn't waste the whole day daydreaming\nso if i've got a choice right this is\nwhat you tell your mind it's like i've\ngot a choice\ni can spend the day learning to practice\npiano and i may never learn how to play\nit it may never be enough or i can spend\nthe day daydreaming about practicing\npiano and becoming an awesome piano\nplayer which one do i want to pick i\nwant to pick actually spending a day\npracticing the piano\nand that's what i actually did today so\ni lived my life today aligned with the\nperson that i want to be\neven if it doesn't work at least i can\ntake pride in that\nsounds completely foreign\ngot to start practicing it\nyou"
