    "transcript": "so how do i get rid of the smell of\nfarts how do i stop smelling farts\ngetting out of the room helps a lot\nso i'm slowly believing\nthe blackpill stuff how do i not do that\nblack pill adherents believe that looks\nare genetically determined and that\nwomen choose sexual partners based\nsolely on physical features lookism\nso whether or not a person will be an\nincel is predetermined\nthere's this youtuber called\nwheatwaffles that's just talking about\nthis stuff about how looks matter the\nmost and it feels like it makes sense to\nme\nand he's not the only youtuber\nit's just making me down and a little\nresentful of living and kinda sad how\nattractive guys get more of a free pass\nand how ugly and average guys are seen\nas creepy\nit's a lot to digest really i have also\nseen videos of tinder experiments with\naverage and attractive guys which just\nprove the point further\nalso how women even ugly ones only want\nto date the top 10 percent chads of guys\nmy current source of interacting if you\ncan call it that with women is tinder\nwhich isn't really getting me any\nmatches i'm i'm a shot in failure at\nlife i don't even want relationships on\ntinder just friendships and that is\nstill asking for too much\nbut i'm not sure maybe i just want to\ncuddle with a female and hold hands but\nthat's relationship stuff i don't want\nsex because of asexuality\ni'm kind of looking for some counter\nevidence because i don't like thinking\nas a black pill but if that is\nreality then what am i supposed to do\nmaybe something about how looks don't\nmatter i don't know\nat this point i should get surgery to\nchange my height and facial structure or\nbetter learn how to be isolated from\nfemales and be alone with video games\ni'm also autistic so if looks don't\nmatter i feel like i'm doomed forever\nso this is kind of challenging because\nsometimes\nwe feel\nhopeless about something\nand what what's happened is on the\ninternet we have support communities\nright so i want you all to kind of think\nabout this from the top so if i'm\nhurting about something let's say i'm\nstarting to take the black pill\nand i feel those negative emotions\nwhat i'll do is gravitate towards a\ncommunity\nthat validates my experience\nand as i gravitate towards that\ncommunity i feel better\nbut then sometimes what can happen is\nthe community itself can become toxic so\nwe've seen this in our own community\nwhere sometimes if you go to our\nsubreddit it's a pretty hopeless place\nso we have a lot of people coming for\nhelp\nand we have a lot of people who are\ntrying to help them\nbut essentially if you like read even\nour subreddit which is supposed to be\nlike a mental health positive validating\naccepting place what it does is it like\nit draws in people who are like\nburnt out and frustrated and then they\nlean on each other with for support\nwhich is absolutely what communities are\nsupposed to do\nthe challenge is that if we're not\ncareful we see this a lot and there's\nactually data to support this which\nwe'll talk about a little bit\nis as this starts to happen in a\ncommunity it actually worsens our mental\nhealth and distorts reality even more we\nhave a common phrase for this now which\nis an echo chamber\nyou'll see this in political uh\ndiscussion like you know discussion\nplaces you'll see it on 4chan\nif you have a discussion about the\nquality of league of legends on a dota\nforum\nthere will be a very uniform how do i\nbelieve that league of legends is not\nworse than dota i hang out on a dota\nform or you go to league of legends\nforum and you talk about dota you're\ngoing to get the opposite result\neveryone there believes this too\nso if you want counter evidence let's\njust unpack this for a second the first\nis that none of this is actual evidence\nthese are youtube videos\nyoutube videos are not\nevidence that are just youtube\nvideos so if you want simple evidence\nthat this statement is not true\ni want you to just look go to a park\nwhere there are people who have kids or\ngo to a grocery store\nand look at\nhow attractive are the parents\nbecause if women are only willing to\ndate the top 10 percent of guys what you\nshould find is every\nmother\nhas a father who's like\nin the top 10 percent of handsomeness\nright\nlike\nthat's all you need to do\nis just go outside and look at who has\nkids so what you'll discover when you do\nthat is that this statement is patently\nfalse right if you want it's not even an\nexperiment it's like this experiments\nare like scientific studies that are\ncontrolled and have variables and\nblinding and randomization that's a\nstudy that's how you get data\nwe've also looked at a study recently on\nai that sort of determined what's the\nmost likely thing that leads to high\nquality in relationships and it's\nactually belief that your relationship\nis is good\nso success in relationship doesn't have\nanything to do with income or this or\nthat actually that's not true that's an\noverstatement\nbut it's not all this stuff that people\nthink it is and the question is why do\npeople think this stuff\npeople think this stuff because of\nthings like youtubers\nright so if i watch 10 videos from wheat\nwaffles\nand wheat waffles believe something i'm\ngonna start to think that this is real\nand then what i'm gonna do is join a\ncommunity of other black pillars because\nwho watches wheat waffles it's already\npeople who agree with them\nso human beings gravitate towards things\nthat they agree with\nand so then what you're going to have is\nthis community\nwhere everyone is saying the same thing\nand then you form an echo chamber so\nthis is not really evidence at all\ni've also seen videos of tinder\nexperiments what were the controls for\ntheir tinder experiments what was their\nsample size\nwhat was you know and then the other\nthing is that you're making a big\nassumption that success on tinder\ncorrelates with success in relationships\nwhere we've actually had recent posts\nwhere people even were like dr k misses\nthe point tinder is toxic and is\nterrible\ntinder is not necessarily about\nrelationships i think i mean i don't\nreally know but like tin tinder is not\nit's just one slice like i also want you\nto like look at people who are in\nrelationships and how many of them met\nat tinder on tinder\nfor thousands of years people have been\nforming relationships without tinder\nand even today it's unclear to me what\npercentage of people who are getting\nmarried today met on tinder\ni'm not saying tinder is bad\nlet's just be honest about what tinder\nactually accomplishes and what it\ndoesn't accomplish and whether it is a\ngood proxy\nfor\nrelationships or success in\nrelationships\nokay\nbut what i want to talk to you all about\ntoday is this person's actual question\nwhich is how do i not do that\nso let's understand the process\nof emotional processing\nokay\nbecause this is something that is under\nexplained\nso everyone talks about validation\nand emotions\nbut what we don't actually talk about is\nlike if you have negative emotions like\nhow are you supposed to deal with them\nlike what is the process of dealing with\nour negative emotions\nso the first thing to understand\nis\nhere's me\nand something happens\nlet's say i have some kind of experience\nand this leads to a negative emotion\nand then what happens is i go to a\ncommunity right so like oh like i i\nstart to believe these things i start to\nblackpill\nand so i'm going to engage in in the\nblack pill community\nand i feel hurt\nand so i go to the black pill community\nand here on the internet we see this in\nour community as well\nso there's a lot of people who will\nvalidate my emotional experience\nand so what happens is the negative\nemotion\ngets validated and vented out into the\ncommunity\nbut participation in the community if\nyou read black pill posts over and over\nand over and over and over again\nwhat's going to happen\ni'm gonna start to feel worse\nright so participation in the black pill\ncommunity is a source of both venting\nemotions\nand actually receiving negative emotions\nand if you look at mental health\ncommunities on the internet what we tend\nto find is that everyone there is\ntalking about acceptance and validation\nbut no one knows how to process\nso essentially what it becomes is like\nit's like a room full of people who are\nfarting\nand it's like i'm going to fart and it's\ngoing to get distributed throughout the\nroom so it's not like stuck within me\nbut then everyone else it's like it's\nlike a you know\npeople who struggle with farting\nconvention is what the internet becomes\nit's like hi my name is olik i struggle\nwith farting i fart\nand it's like oh yeah man that's tough\ntoo and then like that person farts\nand then like eventually like we're just\nin this room that becomes like full of\nfarts\nokay\nright because no one is teaching it like\nall i know is how to like fart it\nout of my butt i don't know how to open\nthe window so they don't teach us the\nrest\nyou all get that so it's like it's kind\nof bizarre because even the communities\nthat are trying to help hey we all\nstruggle with this part of problem of\nlike passing gas\nso like other people don't understand\nthis but like you understand this you're\nmy fart bro\nright or you're my fart girl and that\njust don't google that please god\nso so\nyou know so like we because we share\nthis problem there's like the people out\nthere who don't struggle with passing\ngas and then there's us and then we all\nget together\nand then like\nyou know like\nthat then we're like it it kind of helps\nbecause we understand each other but\nthen we also like get their negativity\ntoo\nand we've even had posts in our\ncommunity of like i just can't stay here\nanymore like this is too bad for my\nmental health\nso how do you deal with this\nokay so now we're going to talk a little\nbit about the steps of emotional\nprocessing okay\nso when i have these negative emotions\nso i participate in this community and\nas i get these negative emotions and i\nget this evidence\nright which by the way this isn't real\nevidence it's just sensory input\nit's like if i subscribe to a bunch of\nflat earther youtube channels it doesn't\nmean that the earth is flat i will think\nthat there's a bunch of evidence that\nthe the earth is flat but it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that the earth is flat\nyou'll get that\ni can subscribe to a bunch of youtube\nchannels about reincarnation\nand i can start to believe that oh look\nat all this evidence all these stories\nof reincarnation doesn't mean it's\nnecessarily true there's like science\nand experiments and evidence\nand then there's people talking on the\ninternet those are not the same thing\nokay doesn't mean that there isn't value\nto those things\nthere can be value to youtube hell we're\non youtube but just because something is\non youtube doesn't make it true shocking\ni know\nso then the question\nis and i really appreciate this person's\npost because it's like they're like how\ndo i stop this right how do i break the\ncycle because i think that's exactly the\nkind of courage and insight you need\nthis person is recognizing okay like\nwhat some they're seeking counter\nevidence they're stepping out of the\necho chamber and they're coming to our\ncommunity and saying like hey like help\nme step out of this echo chamber so it's\nawesome that they did that i think it's\na huge step forward\nso now what we're going to talk about is\nwhat do you do\nwhen you experience negative emotion\nso\nthis is what we do with it\nhere is my negative emotion tube so as i\nget all this negative emotion\nwhat happens is i take that negative\nemotion and then i pack it in here\nso i'll i'll usually distract from it\nright so i've got negative emotions\nventing out i've got negative emotions\ncoming in\nand then over time as i experience\nnegative emotions like\ni'm not really processing them right so\nwhat i'm going to do is distracting\nbehaviors like video games\nor even watching youtube\nright so there evidence that this stuff\nsuppresses our amygdala\nlimbic system there's all this\nnegativity in my mind and in order to\nfunction what do i need to do\ni need to pack it in\nokay as i pack in more and more negative\nemotion\nsomething interesting starts to happen\nkeeping it buried\nrequires more effort so the more full\nmy subconscious gets with negative\nemotion the more energy\nit takes\nto suppress it\nthis in turn\ndecreases our motivation\nand available energy\ndoes that make sense it's like a load on\nour mind\nokay\nand so like then we start to see\nsomething really interesting which is\nthat if you go to these communities that\nhave a lot of negative emotion in them\ntheir members have difficulty actually\ndoing stuff\nright no one's going out there and\nsaying like okay just talk to more\npeople like if tinder isn't working for\nyou like go do this stuff this is where\nthe concept of just\ncomes from\njust go do this why is just hard it's\nbecause we have so much energy\nspent\nsuppressing our negative emotions and\ndistracting ourselves\nthat like we don't have any bandwidth\nleft over for other things\nthe other problem with this\nis that the more full this is with\nnegative emotion\nthe more we have to go into distraction\nand interestingly enough the more likely\nthings are to overflow\nokay\nthe more likely things are to overflow\nwhat this essentially means is that it\ndoesn't take much\nto trigger\nour negative emotions\nso what this means is that people who\nare in this kind of cycle\nall it takes is a single conversation\nlet's say with a woman\nto like\ncreate an eruption of negativity\nand then that becomes a self-fulfilling\ncycle too because when this negativity\nerupts like you can't talk to the person\nanymore\nbecause they didn't respond to your text\nwithin five minutes and then like you\nfeel really hurt and all of this\nnegative emotion starts to well up okay\nso now what we sort of see is that it's\nvery easy to get triggered because\nthere's all this pent-up emotion\nand we keep on distracting from the\nemotion so it gets stored even more and\nthen the more that it gets stored in our\nsubconscious the more energy we have to\nspend like suppressing it\nright and that creates this current\nsituation\nand the more that we get triggered by\nour negative emotions what is our\nexperience there's me\ni'm\nwalking around and then suddenly\nthere's angry me\nand it doesn't take much to do this\nand then what happens is like i it this\nmakes it hard for me to re-engage with\nlife and then i become angrier and\nangrier and angrier\nright and then like it gets worse and\nworse and worse and then like we have an\nangry hopeless negative emotional black\npillar\nwho can't do anything in their life and\nis just in a state of doom and gloom\nbecause they're getting triggered so\neasily it doesn't take much for all that\nemotion to get like\noverwhelm you and the more that the over\nemotion overwhelms you the more you\nretreat into video games or distraction\nor whatever you spend time in that\ncommunity you vent that anger and every\nother person boy do you let what a\ngigantic fart rip\neveryone else in that room smells that\nand they're like oh that's terrible\nright\nand so you'll get these like rant posts\nin these communities and you'll get\npeople making youtube video after\nyoutube video after youtube video about\nhow terrible everything is\nand where is that coming from it's\nfundamentally coming from the fact that\nthis emotion is just\nbuilt up and has nowhere to go\nso\nhow do you stop\nso if we look at the\nprocess\nof emotional processing it involves\nthree steps\nappraisal\nof emotion\nokay\num\nsecond thing is\nlet me think about this\nthird thing was regulation what was\nnumber two\num i'm blanking for some reason\ni can't believe i'm working on this\nokay so it involves appraisal of emotion\num\nregulation of the emotion is number\nthree i'll it'll come back to me\ni blame the illness\nit's sort of not too relevant but we'll\nget to it in a second okay\nso\nfrom a and from a neuroscience\nperspective we've got like parts of our\nbrain that are aware of emotions\nand we have parts of our brain that\nmodulate emotions\noh here's what it is interpretation\nand regulation\nso we've got parts of our brain that\nmodulate our emotions\nand then we've got parts of our brain\nthat modify our emotions\nokay\nso the first thing that you've got to do\nin this process is become aware of the\nemotion\nso what are you feeling\nokay\nlike\nyou okay you feel angry and and stuff\nlike that and then we may once we feel\nangry sometimes what we'll do is we'll\nvent and that'll decrease our emotion so\nthat's one thing that you can do\nand when people offer validation that\ncan also decrease this emotional energy\nso that can both both of those can work\nbut then this is usually as far as\npeople go\nthis is where there's another really\nimportant step\nwhich is explore\nthe origin\nof emotion\nso when i get triggered by something\nwhen i watch a youtube video and the\nrage comes boiling up what i want y'all\nto remember here is that\neach segment of this rage that comes\nboiling up actually came from a\nparticular experience\nright so some of the rage came from this\nexperience some of the rage came from\nthis experience\neach of these\nexperiences causes a little bit of rage\nto come up\nand as we distract\ninstead of acknowledge and process\nthe rage just builds up\nand then what we do is it comes boiling\nup and then we suppress it again but\nit's there next time\nso what you tend to find is that people\ncan get triggered by the same stuff over\nand over and over again\nright like\nso it's like if you don't process you're\ngonna continue getting triggered\nso this is where like so this is where\nwe you know in our coaching program we\nteach our coaches about how to find the\norigin of a some scott\nso some scott is like bottled up\nemotional energy this is stuff that's\nthousands of years old we do this stuff\nin therapy as well but this is not this\nis just a fundamental of how the mind\nworks\nso some scott is a concept from like\nancient yogic psychology about this\nbasic idea that any time we experience\nemotions\nwhatever we don't process gets stored\nand then whatever gets stored can be\nrecalled\nand so if you ask someone out on a date\nand you're very very very anxious about\nthat what you'll recognize is some of\nthat anxiety is coming from that\nexperience\nbut some of that anxiety is left over\nfrom the last time you asked someone out\nor tried to ask someone out and some of\nthat is coming from the time before that\nand the time before that and there was a\ncri you had a crush on someone in the\nseventh grade\nand they ended up dating your best\nfriend\nand so like some of that leftover\nemotion projects onto this relationship\nand this is what we kind of call\nemotional baggage\nso we even know this right so we'll say\nlike oh why didn't that relationship\nwork out oh that person had too much\nbaggage they had too much relationship\npackage what does that mean it means\nleftover emotions that have not been\nprocessed and they project onto the\ncurrent relationship and make this\nrelationship more difficult than it\nobjectively is\nokay so explore the origin of the\nemotion\nstart to recognize in the moment that\nsome of what you're experiencing is\nactually not from this person\nthat you're not just angry with this\nperson this is anger that's left over\nfrom the past person\nand as you do that as you become aware\nof the origin of the emotion you'll\nstart to treat this person differently\nand then what you'll stop\ndo less of is sabotage this future\nrelationship\nokay\nnext thing that you've got to do this is\nreally important\nis as you gain awareness\nof the emotion\nthis emotion is going to push\nyour\nbehavior\nas you acknowledge and recognize the\nawareness of\nthe the origin of the emotion what you\nneed to do is intentionally\nalter\nyour behavior\nso i'll give you guys a simple example\nso there's all kinds of like stuff if\nyou guys have seen the nice guys\nsubreddit right someone like doesn't\nrespond to my text and i say hey i'm a\nnice guy\nthey don't respond for a day and then i\nstart calling them all kinds of nasty\nthings\nnice girls exist too it's not just\nyou know it's not a gender issue\nso what happens is in that moment\nthe nice guy\nthey give in to that emotion and they\nstart cussing out the person that\nthey're talking to which in turn ruins\nthe relationship it's not even a\nrelationship potentially\nand then that in turn is going to cause\nanother some scar\nwhich in turn is going to fill up our\nemotional bucket\neven more\nso what happens is nice guys become\nnicer and nicer and nicer with with each\ninteraction that they have\nwhich in turn actually means they become\nnastier and nasty or nastier\nso what you've really got to do is alter\nyour behavior in the moment\nand don't send that text message but in\norder to just don't send the text\nmessage it's not that simple right if i\nwas just don't send it no the way that\nyou overcome your impulses the way that\nyou manage that is actually by the\ndiscovery\nof\nthe\nexploration of emotion and the awareness\nof the emotion in the present\nbecause oftentimes when we give in to\nemotions we're not even aware that we're\nfeeling them\nokay\nthe last thing that you've got to do\nis re-integrate\nyour\nnegative experiences\ninto\nidentity\nso we had a lecture on post-traumatic\ngrowth\na couple months ago now\nand one of the key things about trauma\nso trauma is like a negative emotional\nexperience right\nthe interesting thing is that when you\nprocess trauma properly\npeople feel stronger than when they\nstarted\nand so a good example of this is the\nidea of a cancer survivor getting cancer\nsucks\nwhen you first get cancer you start to\nthink all these negative things why me\nlife is terrible\ni hate god i no longer believe in god i\nstarted believing in god and god is an\nass\nthere's so much stuff i want to do it's\nfilled with all these negative emotions\nand then some people\nwallow in that and they stay stuck\nother people will like integrate that\ninto themselves\nand they what they can actually do is\nokay if i've got five years left\ni'm gonna make the most of it\nso that when experiences affect us if\nwe're not careful they alter our\nidentity and then we can go through the\nprocess of reinterpreting that\nand reintegrating like that experience\ninto our identity in a healthy way\nand so this is this sort of involves\ncognitive reframing\nand this is where the identity of\nsomeone like a cancer survivor arrives\nright so i use that as an example\nbecause it's it's a good example of like\nsomething that happens very commonly\nwhere people will say like okay i'm a\ncancer survivor if i survived cancer i\ncan definitely handle this\nand then suddenly what that person like\neven though cancer is definitely not a\ngood thing\nthat person actually looks to the future\nlike more resilient and with like more\nhope and capability than if they had\nnever had cancer in the first place\nand this step we definitely\ndon't get into if you're in a black pill\ncommunity\nhow does this happen\nthis happens as a consequence of\nemotional work and self-reflection and\nlike talking about who you are and stuff\nlike that this is what coaches will\nsometimes help people do therapists can\nhelp people do this as well sometimes\nyou don't need either of those things\nit's just like you hike and you spend\ntime with yourself and long dark nights\nof the soul\nbut then you start to think about\nyourself differently\nright so instead of thinking about\nyourself as a black pillar or doomer you\nstart to think about yourself as i'm\nsomeone who has struggled in\nrelationships\nand as you start to alter your behaviors\nand you stop sabotaging your\nrelationships you are going to\nform relationships\nand as you form relationships\nyou're gonna start to change the way\nthat you think about yourself\nand then instead of someone who is\ndoomed to never have a relationship\nright which is sometimes what we see\nhere right like\num how attractive guys blah blah blah\nlike i\nand then like\ni'm a shut in failure at life like this\nhas got to change and as you start\naltering your behavior and as you start\nengaging in things in life\nyou'll start to realize\nbasically i mean this is i i see a lot\nof myself in this person\nso i was like you know 18 19 started to\nget into the pickup artist scene myself\ni had a friend who was super into it\nand i was like oh i need to like and\nthen the pickup artist evolved into red\npill and then evolved into black pill\nand in cells and stuff like that\nand so i started blaming other people\nfor my shortcomings\nand then as i started to make\nalterations in my life i\nreconceptualized that and now like the\nbiggest reconception is\ni understand this person to some extent\ntherefore i'm grateful for those\nexperiences because my hope is that i\ncan help them\ni'm an in-cell survivor\nin a sense\nbecause that then i discovered oh\nactually like all of those thoughts and\nfeelings are\nlike\ni completely understand where they come\nfrom i i\nexperience them as well\nand\nthey're not necessarily true and there's\na way to get out of it\nso if you want to learn how to like get\nout of the cycle what you've got to do\nis process your emotions\nthe thing is thus far the internet has\nfigured out how to validate emotions but\nhasn't figured out how to process them\nso what we end up with is these like\ncollections of people\nwho share the same problem\nvent their emotional energy\nit gets absorbed by everyone else in the\ncommunity as the rest of the community\nabsorbs that negative energy they in\nturn vent it themselves\nand then we're in a room full of people\nwho struggle with passing gas and fart\ntoo much\nand then that actually weighs us down\nand we get confused because we were told\nthat talking about it is supposed to\nhelp\nand i did talk about it why isn't it\nhelping\nand then the very community that is\nsupposed to support us\nactually makes us feel worse\nand that's because we're missing some\nkey steps in emotional processing the\nfirst is to be aware of the emotion\nthe second is to understand the origin\nof the emotion and recognize this cycle\nof every time i have a negative emotion\ndo i suppress it through something like\nvideo games do i give in to it by\nlashing out to people\nyou have to recognize okay what am i\nfeeling right now i'm feeling hurt and\nrejected i'm feeling unlovable that's\nwhy i'm calling someone the c word or\nthe b word or whatever\nthat's why i want to hurt this person\nback because this person hurt me you get\nslapped across the face what do you want\nto do you want to slap the other person\nbe aware of the emotion\nonce you become aware of the emotion and\nonce you recognize oh like some of this\nhurt is actually coming from all of my\nprevious rejections\nthe wild thing is they weren't even\nexplicit rejections\nas you start to go back and you explore\nthe origin of the sumscar and this is\nthe work that our coaches do\nyou start to reinterpret you start to\nrealize and you all will see me do this\nso like for example if you if you look\nat some of our interviews with incels\nright we'll like help them re-interpret\ntheir prior experiences\ninstead of interpreting it through an\nemotional lens they start to really\ninterpret it through a logical lens the\nproblem is that everyone who is\ncontrolled by their emotions thinks\nthey're thinking logically whereas the\ntruth of the matter is they're not\nthinking logically at all\nit's just hard for your mind to\nrecognize that\nthat's why it oftentimes requires help\nof an external person\nto help\ninterpret reinterpret that experience\nas you become aware of the origin of the\nemotion and you become aware oh my god\nthere's all of that emotion from all my\npast rejections coming up you can alter\nyour behavior\nas you alter your behavior and stop\nsabotaging your attempts at connection\nwith other human beings you'll start to\nform relationships\nas you start to form relationships you\ncan start to re-integrate your past\nexperiences into yourself\nin a healthy way\nand that's how you untake the black pill\ngotta process those emotions in a\nnutshell\nthe other thing to consider\nis\num\nthat\nspending time in that community\nso how do i get rid of the smell of\nfarts how do i stop smelling farts\ngetting out of the room helps a lot\nso even though it is emotionally\nvalidating to spend time in some of\nthese communities\nit doesn't actually help you in the long\nterm\nand even though it's nice to spread your\nfart around other people\nyou're smelling all of theirs and that\nmay not be a good idea\nokay\nthis is also a problem that sometimes we\nencounter in group coaching\nso we see this sometimes where group\ncoaching essentially turns into\nlike negative venting sessions without\nany sense of like progress or growth\nwhere people are just\nyou know like venting negativity and\nthen the air in there can get very\noppressive\nand hopefully uh you know our our\ncoaches are sort of\nhave some amount of skill in managing\nthis where i'm actually thinking about\nputting together a specific emotional\nprocessing curriculum for group\num\nbut it's like something that happens a\nlot where it can feel really oppressive\nand then it's the coach's job to help\nyou work through that stuff\nand like do those processing steps\nchallenge your viewpoint start to think\na little bit about like how to view your\nyour situation differently but sometimes\nit can get dark\nand it's it's a valid concern valid\ncomplaint absolutely\nand speaking of which so someone\nactually recently sent me\na list of\nconcerns that people have about group\ncoaching so i just wanted to talk about\nthose for a minute\nso here are some reasons that people\ndon't believe in group coaching\nthe first is i'm not going to get\npersonalized advice therefore it won't\nbe helpful and other people are going to\ngive me advice that doesn't work for me\nso the reason that group coaching is so\nhard to explain is because there's no\nadvice\nso people come into group coaching we\nsaw this a lot in our high performance\ngroup\nwhere\npeople came in and they were like\nsomeone was a ceo of a company and\nthey're like i was i this is not what i\nexpected i thought i was going to be\nwith other ceos and they were going to\ngive me tips\non work-life balance\nlike i'm not getting any tips\nso my first question to you is when\npeople give you advice how effective is\nit\nin changing your life\nit's not\npeople come they're looking for answers\nthe internet is full of answers\nand have we solved motivation in the\nhuman race\nso people come expecting an answer and\nthat's what's so confusing about it is\nwe don't give you one because it's our\nbelief\nthat giving answers doesn't actually\nhelp people what helps people is\nunderstanding why you can't take the\nadvice\nso group coaching is about understanding\nyourself\nnow this is where people say but like\nunderstanding myself like\nif if the goal is understanding me\nshouldn't i do personal coaching why\nshould i do group coaching i'm going to\nmake this very simple for y'all\nso if you're watching this and you're a\npart of our community\nhave you talked to dr k\nhave you benefited from anything that\nwe've ever done\nbut how is it possible for you to\nbenefit\nif you've never talked to dr k\nvery simple\nthis is where the aoe healing concept\ncomes in\nso here's\ndr k\nhere is the person that we interview\nperson with the with that we interview\nhas a problem\nwhen we talk to this person does this\nperson benefit\nyeah\nbut then here's all y'all\nthat are watching\ndo you benefit\nyes\nwhy\nyou're not the one who's interacting\nso this is really important to\nunderstand\nwhen you see your problem\nin someone else\nit becomes a lot clearer holy crap i'm\ndoing it because you're not subjectively\ncaught up in the emotion\nit's your problem but it's in someone\nelse so it's actually easier to\nunderstand if this principle were not\ntrue aoe healing and we would not be a\nthing\ndo you all get that\nso it's really interesting\nbecause what i want you all to do is\nthink about this for a second when i\nfinish interviewing someone on stream\nand i ask them what have you learned\ntoday\nthey're like i have no clue\nbut if i ask twitch chat\nwhat have you learned today you all have\nclear answers\nclear takeaways\nyou can see it clear as day\nyou're not caught up with all the crap\nthat they were going through\ndo you all get that\nit's like there's like each and every\none of you will take away something from\neach of these streams\nthis and it's because of this concept\nwhen you work one-on-one with someone\nthe subjectivity and the experience of\nemotion makes it hard for you to learn\nlessons\nthis is why group can be valuable\nbecause it it actually engages what a\nlot of people think is that personal\ncoaching is closer to what we do on\nstream i actually think ironically group\ncoaching is closer to what we do on\nstream because in terms of your\nperspective\nso if you get something out of watching\nstreams and out of watching videos why\nis that it's because you're the observer\nout here\nand you're learning over here\nit's kind of a bizarre concept that not\nmany people get\nokay next thing\ni will not have enough time to share my\nproblems and time will be split among\nthe group\nthat's a fair point so if you need\none-on-one time personal coaching is\nbetter\nno question\nbut i think that the whole point of\ngroup coaching is that your problems\nand someone else's problems are actually\nthe same friggin problem once again if\nthis if everyone needed individual help\nthis would not be a thing\naoe healing would not be a thing the\nwhole point the premise upon which our\ntwitch channel our youtube healthy gamer\nwas founded\nis that we share the same problems and\nif we come together and work on them\nlike we can actually solve them together\nwhat i saw the reason i literally the\nreason i started streaming and this\nwhole thing\nis because it occurred to me that\nworking one-on-one in my office\nwas not enough\nand that there's a certain scalability\nto this that is absolutely necessary\nright now\nand that same spirit is embedded into\nour group coaching program\nhere's the next one i will be required\nto solve other people's problems and i\ncan't solve my own problems how will i\nhelp others\nreally really valid concern i can't even\nhelp myself how the hell am i supposed\nto help someone else\nlet me ask you\nsomething is it easier to cook for\nyourself when you're sick or cook for\nsomeone else one of your friends when\nyou're sick\nwhat actually brings out\nwho can you work harder for can you work\nharder for yourself or work harder for a\nfriend\nso here's the wild thing\nit actually goes the other way around\nhelping others\ncan sometimes be the first step to\nhelping yourself\nwe see this a lot in the substance use\ncommunity\nthat like we're gonna come together and\nsupport each other and try to help each\nother stay sober\nand like that actually is how you figure\nit out when you talk to your friend\nlet's say i'm in a community of people\nwho are black pillars\nand i offer\nwords of hope and encouragement to a\nfriend like to one of my peers in group\nthat's where i learn how to say those\nthings and it's easier to see respect in\nother people and give respect in other\npeople how do you change that\nself-dialogue in your head you start by\nchanging the way that you talk to other\npeople because it's easier to talk to\nthem\nit's easier to look at someone else in\ngroup and say even though you screwed up\nyou still have value as a human being\nit's just a setback really hard to say\nthat to yourself\nso how do you learn how to say it to\nyourself you actually learn the words by\nsaying it to someone else\nthen what happens is group is you see\nthe intrinsic value in all seven people\nin the group\nbut you still don't see it in yourself\nand then they see it in you and you're\nstill confused and then one day\nhopefully your facilitator or someone\nelse in group is like hey what do y'all\nthink about that\nwho here thinks that they're the least\nhelpful person in group and everyone in\ngroup raises their hand\nand that's when it clicks\nholy crap how is that possible like\nwhat's going on here\nthe problem with personal coaching or\ntherapy\nis if your therapist is like you have\nvalue\nwhat do you say in response what does\nyour mind say\nyour mind is like\nyou're paid to say that\nso there's there's interesting study\nthe respect so if if you pull\nprogrammers\nokay developers\nwhose respect matters to you the most\nit's not your boss\nit's your peers\nthe respect of peers is the most\nimpactful thing for your sense of value\nand we know this we've discovered this\nthis is what all the research from the\nunited nations world health organization\nu.s surgeon general about peer support\nis all about\nit's like if one of you all talks to dr\nk\nand dr k is like you're a beautiful\nhuman being you have intrinsic value\nyou're like\nf you you're dr k of course you're gonna\nsay that you say that to everyone it\ndoesn't even mean anything\ncoming from you\ny'all get that\nbut when it comes from your peers it\nmeans something\nit's like if i'm playing a game of dota\nand i ask my mom mom do you think i'm\ngood at dota and my mom is like yes\nbetta you're so good at dota look at how\ntalented you are and smart you are\nyou're so good at dota beta your best\ndaughter player in the world\nbut when my friggin\npeers in the dota game were like damn\nson you were amazing at this game\ni once had someone tell me after a game\nof dota 2. i wonder if i can even find\nthe\nscreenshot don't know where screenshots\ngo i'll try to find it\ni used up all of my good teammate luck\nfor the year in this match\nbest piece of feedback i've ever gotten\nin dota game\nall of my like good teammate luck is\ngone because i queued with you\nthe respect of your peers matters so\nmuch more\ni'll try to find the quote\nokay\nnext problem that people have in group i\nwill feel lonely in the group because\nothers won't be able to understand what\ni'm going through\nif that were true once again this would\nnot be a thing\nthe whole point is that we feel isolated\nand when we give into that feeling no\none else will be able to understand what\ni do and we don't ever engage in a group\nwe never give ourselves the chance to\ndisprove that belief and we go on\nreinforcing the belief that i'm alone i\nam alone i am alone\nthe value in group comes from\ncoming into group believing you're alone\nand leaving realizing that you're not\nhow does one realize that they're not\nalone in this world\nit has to come from a group it has to\ncome from your peers even if you have\none-on-one sessions with dr k\nyou think one-on-one time with me is\ngoing to make you feel less alone like\ndr k is the one person in the world that\nunderstands me\nthat's because it's dr k but the rest of\nthe humans out there there's no way they\ncould understand me\nso how do you change this idea that i'm\nalone in this world it's got to be\nthrough some kind of group interaction\nwhen you share your problems that's why\nlike aoe healing is a thing because like\nevery person who comes on here thinks\nthat they're alone thinks that their\nproblems are unique and then everyone\nwatches and they're like you know what\nwe struggle with this too\ni won't be able to participate because i\nhave difficulty speaking and i'm shy\nthis is a great one this is probably my\nfavorite one\nyou know what that is correct\nif you are shy and you have difficulty\nspeaking up you are going to have\ntrouble in group\nwhich is exactly why we made it\nbecause let me give you the options\nthere's you who's shy and has difficulty\nspeaking there's the real world\nin which speaking up\nand looking like an idiot and sounding\nlike an idiot has real consequences\nyou can't afford to speak up at work and\nlook stupid in front of your boss\nbecause that can affect your pay\nyou can't afford to go to the birthday\nparty because if you look dumb at the\nbirthday party then like they're not\ngonna invite you next time\nthere are real consequences\nto being\nshy and speaking up in the real world\nif only there were a place\nwhere you could practice overcoming that\nemotion of shyness if there were only a\nspace that was non-judgmental that did\nnot affect your relationships did not\naffect who you play games with did not\naffect your income if there was only a\nsandbox\na practice mode\nfor overcoming understanding those\nfeelings\nthat would be cool\nso here's you\nhere's the real world here's group\nit's specifically a place where you're\ngonna feel shy\nand this is one of my favorite things in\ngroup\nso when we have a shy person in group\nwhat do i do i ask them\nwhat helps you speak\ndoes it help if people ask you questions\ndoes it help if other people\nwear the burden of communication\nor carry the burden of communication\nwith you yeah it helps but then it makes\nme feel bad\nso it's like okay who's gonna step in\nand ask this person questions to bring\nhim into the group one person is like\ni'm gonna step in\ncool so then they start asking them\nquestions\nand the shy person is speaking because\nif someone talks to them they'll talk\nback i mean they'll you know they'll\nrespond but then the person feels guilty\nand so we're like okay so now you feel\nguilty because the group\nis pulling you in how can we deal with\nthat feeling of guilt what can you do to\nmake things right i don't know maybe i\ncan ask other people questions fantastic\nis there someone else in the group who\nfeels shy\ngreat can you ask them a question and\nbring them in\neven though i'm nervous yeah because\nlike i want to do my part in group\nask him a question\nhave a conversation\nand then suddenly the shy person is\nengaging someone else\nright then you feel guilty for feeling\nguilty which is exactly why\nhelping other people in the group is so\ncrucial\nthe best antidote to feeling guilty\nfor being helped by another human being\nis to actually help another human being\nbecause then you can say to yourself\nyeah did i need help absolutely but i\nalso gave it\ni gave something back\nand then you start living in the world\nnot as an independent person who no\nlonger needs help\nbecause that's what keeps us stuck i\ndon't want anyone else's help\ni don't need anyone else's help i need\nto be independent you start to change\nthe way that you look in the world and\nsuddenly the world is about needing help\nreceiving help and giving help\nthat's how this works we're all going to\nhelp each other\nso it's interesting because the very\nthings that cause people to be afraid to\nsign up for group is exactly what group\nis designed to fix\nbut it's absolutely true i'm not saying\nthat talking in group is going to be\neasy\nit's going to be hard but where else are\nyou going to learn how to do it\nwhere else can you show up\nand like\nscrew up and be welcome next week\nthat's why we have group\ni'll i'll uh there will be a lot of time\nwasted because i have to listen to\nothers problems that i won't get\nanything from this also we've addressed\nthis is the idea of aoe healing the\nconcept that you can learn from someone\nelse's problems\nand also that you can help someone\nelse's problems and as you help someone\nelse get through it you will learn how\nto fix it yourself\ni'll feel worse because people will just\nbe complaining for 90 minutes that is\nabsolutely a possibility when this\nhappens in group and when group becomes\nessentially\nventing session after venting session\nafter venting session without processing\nwithout challenging without you know\nlearning\nand growing then group actually becomes\nmore toxic than it's worth\nit has absolutely happened it's a very\nreal fear and it's a very valid concern\nit doesn't happen often\nbut sometimes the group becomes so\noppressive and the facilitator actually\nlacks the skill to be able to steer it\nin the right direction\nit's a valid concern\nwe've had people drop out of group\nbecause this has happened\nwhat i can say confidently though is\nthat that is not the majority of group\nexperience and i'd say that probably\nhappens less than five to ten percent of\nthe time\nwe've had very few groups like literally\nfall apart because of the how oppressive\nthe atmosphere is\ni won't be able to find people who are\nsuccessful enough to be role models i\ncan learn from\nonce again you're not in group to learn\nfrom other people\nif you want to learn from someone else\nwatch stream if you want to learn from\nsomeone else go to a class\nif you want to learn from someone group\nis not right for you\nif you want to learn about yourself\ngroup is right for you\nif you want to see your problems\nexisting in other people\nand learn what they did to overcome\ntheir problems if you want to help\nsomeone else with your problem then come\nto group\nbut if you're look coming there for a\ncurriculum that's not the right place\nwe're actually still developing\nsomething like that but\nif you're looking to learn from someone\nelse sign up for a class don't sign up\nfor group coaching"
