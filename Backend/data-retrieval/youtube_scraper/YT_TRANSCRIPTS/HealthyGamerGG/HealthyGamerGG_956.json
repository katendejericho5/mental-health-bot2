    "transcript": "your mind especially when it's hopeless\nis not a very good predictor of the\nfuture\ndoes that make sense\nhello\nhi\nhow are you\num\num\nright now um\n[Music]\ni'm happy to be here um\nbut generally i've been feeling\nhopeless and lost oh my goodness\ncan you start by telling me how what\nwhat uh how you what you go by or how i\nshould refer to you\num leah is fine leah yeah so i'm so\nsorry to hear that leah that you've been\nfeeling hopeless and\ndid you say directionless\nyes yeah can you tell me a little bit\nabout that\num well i was doing well for a bit um\ni just and then i don't know like even\nlike monday i was like really\ndoing well and hopeful and then\njust it was like every day something\nterrible happened and\ni'm back at a place of hopelessness and\nlike i don't i can't see the future\nbasically\num\nthat sounds\nawful\nyeah\nwell can you help me understand a little\nbit when you were feeling hopeful on\nmonday how long had you been hopeful\nbecause you\noh my it was like building up and then\nwell actually um\ni think it was building up and it was\njust like a full day or two just like\nyou know things are gonna be really good\nactually and i was telling my friends\nlike\ni think things are going to get better\nfor all of us you know and then it\ndefinitely didn't like you know yeah can\nyou tell me can i ask you a couple\nquestions about that\nyeah\num so what so it sounds it sounds like\nyou had a string of bad stuff happen to\nyou\nyeah\ncan you share do you feel comfortable\nsharing like what happened\num i can try okay um\ni had people close to me experience like\nhuge loss\nokay and um and then my family as well i\ni experienced a huge loss in my family\nlike back in january and i hadn't really\ngone back more than a few times and i\nwent back\nthis past week um and to look through\nthe estate stuff oh my goodness\nyeah yeah and and then i had like you\nknow my very close friends lose people\nand i won't tell their you know yeah of\ncourse but it was like a big deal\nbut um\nyeah if i'm hearing yeah go ahead sorry\noh i was just gonna keep going yeah keep\ngoing oh my god there's more\num\ni experienced you know like\na rejection you know so uh\nthat was hard but it was like i was\nfeeling really positive about it but\nthen i think with all this other stuff i\nwas like oh i don't know if i can handle\nthis you know sure and in rejection in\nin sort of a\na personal way or professional way or\nwhat\num\none specifically was like romantic okay\nin other ways i'm also job hunting you\nknow so that's like the whole thing um\nbut it was like a very close friend of\nmine that i have feelings for but\num\nand i was like you know obviously\nusually i would be fine you know i think\nbut i think with everything else\nyeah it just became kind of unbearable\nand it was like everything in my every\nsection of my life felt\ntainted and just bad\nyeah i mean it sounds like you can't\ncatch a break in like any dimension it\nsounds like your friends are going\nthrough a lot your family is going\nthrough a lot you're going through a lot\nand and it also sounds like there's like\nactual literal like death\ninvolved yeah and then of course the\nnail on the head was like you know what\nfriday or whatever when the roe v wade\nstuff happened it was like\nwow i feel\ncompletely powerless like\nin anything you know because i\nam a woman in the us and\nthat's it's just you know\nit's\nterrifying\nyeah\nwhen you said\ni'm a woman in the u.s my instinctive\nresponse was my condolences\nwhich is such an absurd thing to say\nso i just laughed a little bit there i i\ndid sometimes i i laugh arguably\ninappropriately when people are\ndifferent it's okay i've been like\nlaughing this whole time like out of\nnervousness so like yeah\nso i mean lay it sounds like\ni mean\ncan i just think for a second because\nthat that's yeah\nso i you know my first thought is\nwhen people call in\npresumably i'm supposed to be able to\nhelp them in some way\nright like that's why people call in is\nthat yeah we're here to help\nthe first thing that i want to say is\nthat i i don't i don't know exactly what\nwe're gonna be able to do for you but i\ni oddly enough i'm not hopeless with you\nbut i i can\nabsolutely see how this is not something\nthat\num can be fixed with a bit of advice or\nsome kind of like\nyou know\nrevelation like sometimes when people\nstruggle in our community i think it's\nbecause\nthey're doing something wrong right so\neither we'll get a particular thought\nthat takes control of our mind\nor we'll have like a cognitive bias or\nyou know we're\nplaying spending too much time on the\ninternet or things like that whereas in\nyour situation i i genuinely feel like\ni mean this is you know a lot of this\nstuff is really has nothing to do with\nyour choices\nand and i could totally understand how\nit feels hopeless because it's not like\nyou're doing anything wrong\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nhow do you feel about that\nuh you know it's just that hopeless\nfeeling um\ni do want to say like\nyour work has helped me a lot um and i\njust appreciate that generally even if\nyou feel like you don't have like\nrevelation\nright now but like the past few months\nit's been very helpful can you help me\nunderstand that a little bit what's been\nhelpful\nyou did this interview i think with\ni can't find it i think it was with ms\nkif but it was like a meditation where\nlike he\nyou could feel your\nthough you higher than you\nlike pulling your thoughts back\nbasically i don't know this is sorry if\nthis is like completely irrelevant no\nbut it was like a huge thing for me\nbecause it helped me realize like\nsoul like there is a soul like i don't\nknow it was a huge spiritual thing for\nme and it's part of like what keeps me\ngoing right now\num leia i'd love to hear more about that\nare you comfortable talking about that\nfor a little bit\nyeah if it's okay we talk about\nspiritual stuff i don't\ni i might not assume it is but\nyeah um\ni mean because i i think in a situation\nlike this when we can't bring people\nback from the dead and we can't make\npeople fall in love with you\nyeah\num i i think i'd i'd love to hear a\nlittle bit about that practice and what\nyou sort of experienced and and what\nyou've learned from it\nyeah i mean i believe\ni don't fully know my beliefs are like\nwhat to label them or anything but i\nknow like i believe in\ni think i believe in souls and like\nreincarnation and stuff like that\nso i\nfind myself being like well\nif you do just quit now you're just\ngonna be\ngoing back into it like i don't know\nlike i might as well try to make the\nmost of this body in life and everything\num\ni don't know\nokay\nyeah so i actually lay i really\nappreciate your perspective because i\nthink sometimes\nwe start with beliefs you know we say\nlike this is what i believe\nbut what i really hear from you is that\nyou're\nfiguring it out\nlike kind of like one sort of painful\nstep at a time\nwhich which is exactly how kind of i\ni've in a sense quote-unquote figured it\nout for myself it was like it's really\nconfusing but i really found that\nmeditation helped me have a couple of\nfoundational experiences\nthat then helped me like organize my\nlife\nand if you're open to it i'd love to try\nto facilitate that process for you\nyeah\nso tell me a little bit about when you\ndid that practice what did you\nexperience\ni'm not sure how to describe it but it\nwas like\ni just remember feeling like completely\nshocked like i don't know just come not\nshocked but like\nit was just mind-blowing like that\nexperience it was like\ni just felt in touch with\nmyself on such a level i don't know yeah\nso so let me ask though that that's\ngreat so so i i think i understand what\nyou mean\nand i know it's kind of weird so like\nthere's there's the you right so the you\ninvolves like a body and a mind\nand\nhopelessness happens within the body and\nthe mind does that make sense\nyeah and what you experienced in that\nmoment of like\nknowing yourself was that within the\nmind or outside of the mind\nit felt outside well i guess like\nknowing that i was knowing my mind was\nin my not my mind but myself was in my\nmind but like\nthe actual event was past it you know\nyeah so so what i'm hearing is that you\nhad some kind of experience that was we\nuse the word sometimes transcendent\ndoes that make sense so it's kind of\nbeyond mind and then later your mind\nmade sense of it\nyeah yeah right so the way that you put\ntogether your beliefs beliefs happen\nwithin the mind but then\nyou know these experiences happen\noutside of it\nso yeah and this is where uh do you mind\nif i ask how old you are\ni'm 21 okay\nand\nthis is the kind of thing where like\nyou know i'd sort of say that you've had\na lot of bad stuff happen to you\num and it can be very common for your\nmind to feel hopeless\ndoes that make sense yeah\nbut i also think i know it's kind of\nweird but like i i think that uh\nyour mind especially when it's hopeless\nis not a very good predictor of the\nfuture\ndoes that make sense\nprobably true\nwhat do you think about that you're more\nthan welcome to disagree\num\ni mean it makes sense\nit's just like one of those places you\nknow where like\ni haven't talked to any of my friends\nabout it because i know like anything\nthey say is not going to touch it you\nknow what do you mean by that it is just\nlike if they're gonna try to say\npositive things and i just know i'm in a\nspace where like it's not gonna resonate\nyou know yeah even if like objectively i\ni can say that the hopelessness probably\nisn't definitive\nactually of like what's gonna happen i\ndon't know yep yeah so let's talk about\nthat for a second so\nobjectively\nit may not be accurate\nbut\nit feels overwhelming\nyeah right the the objectivity of the\nsituation doesn't friggin matter\nyeah\nwhat what's how do you understand that\ni don't know how to\nmake like\nmake myself\ncome back to the\nsurface i guess you know yeah so so that\nsounds sounds like you're drowning\ni feel like it yeah so i i\nyou know i think\nleia my heart goes out to you it\ngenuinely does\ni'm hopeful for you and i don't\nexpect you to be hopeful for yourself\num and i think that's okay what do you\nthink about that\nso how did you how did you come to start\nhoping for stuff on monday\ni just felt like\ni think i had\num\ni just felt like things were going to\nget better or like i saw\ngood things\ncould happen nothing specific just like\ni think\ngood things are going to happen from now\non you know\nsomething good will happen\nyeah you'll catch a break so things were\nlooking up\nyeah yeah and oddly enough that's\nprobably what made all these different\nchallenges so much worse\nprobably yeah right is that you you were\nfoolish enough to hope\nfor a few days\nand look at where it got you leia where\ndid it get you\nso this is what i'd say first thing leia\nis i'm i'm really really happy that you\nwere able to do\nsome meditation and you were able to\nhave this transcendent experience\num i would encourage you to continue\nmeditating are you able to do that do\nyou think\nactually yes\ni'm sorry do you say mentally yes\ntechnically yes that's just one of those\nthings where you got to like do it\nyeah so so that it's a really good point\nright so i think sometimes so this is\nthe tricky thing about meditation is\nthat\noftentimes we meditate for something\nthe problem is that if you're meditating\nfor something\nyou'll open it up to feelings of\nhopelessness i don't know if that sort\nof makes sense because if i'm meditating\nfor a purpose\nand then i start to believe that that\npurpose isn't possible\nthen the hopelessness will infect the\nmeditative practice\nlike having expectations\nyeah not not sorry expectations yeah but\nlike if i'm meditating let's say i'm\nmeditating to help with my adhd\nand then if i start meditating and my\nadhd doesn't get better what happens to\nmy motivation for meditating\nright it cripples\nabsolutely what a great word cripples\nright so i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut i think that like being able to\nmeditate in spite of not having any\nreason is going to be a really important\nstep forward for you\nbecause i i think the main thing here is\ngoing to be the more that you can ground\nyourself in that transcendent experience\nand it'll come again if you keep at it\nif it happened to you once like whatever\nhappened in your brain can absolutely\nhappen again\nand i think that that place will be a\nsource of strength for you\nso that place can sort of help you\nunderstand that like the hopelessness in\nyour mind is completely valid\nand also\nmay not be correct\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nthe other thing to consider is that\nyou know some of what you're feeling is\nprobably like honestly like a natural\nconsequence of what you've been through\nso as you take like emotional critical\nhit do you play games\nyeah so as you get emotionally\ncritically hit again and again and again\nyou're gonna be like you know your\nhealth bars flashing like your character\nhas like some debuffs and things like\nthat and that's like basically it sounds\nlike the state that you're in right now\nis that\nhow it feels\nyeah\n[Music]\nand so the the kind of weird thing is\nthe good news is that in a weird way i\nthink time is actually like on your side\nbecause i just don't think statistically\nthis kind of crap is going to keep\nhappening to you\ni feel like it has like my whole life\nbut i get what you mean yeah tell me\nabout that so maybe maybe i'm wrong\ni don't know i just feel like i've\nalways been going through\n[Music]\nlike traumatic events or\nlike obviously not like the worst tragic\ntraumatic events you could go through\nbut like you know still bad um\nso it just feels like i never catch a\nbreak you know or like i do for like\nthose two days and then it's like oh\nreality check\ni don't know yeah so that that's where\none of two possibilities is there one is\nthat\nyou're just genuinely screwed in terms\nof karma\nthe other thing to consider though is\nthat\nthe mind's ability to\nnotice the good and notice the bad can\nbe adjusted\nso sometimes like there are people who\nwill have like you know one good thing\nhappen and one bad thing happen\nit's kind of like if you think about\nlike get you know if i if i take a test\nand i answer 89 questions right and 11\nquestions wrong\nall everyone focuses on is the 11\nquestions i got wrong\ndoes that make sense\nyeah do you think you could be doing\nthat\nuh\ni mean there is joy in the little things\nyeah\nokay so i'm hearing i'm hearing no so so\nso that's what i'm hearing there leia is\nthere's joy in the little things but\nthere's crap in the big ones\ni know\nyeah that that sounds that sounds bad\ndude\nyeah i mean i'm just i just feel like\ni'm surviving and like i mean i have my\ncat and like that's like\nyeah so what i'm hearing is that\nyou've got consolation prizes but you\ndon't have like the real prizes\nnot yet\nhelp me understand the yet in that\nstatement\ni feel like i'm always thinking like\nyou know\nat some point there's gotta be\nyou\nknow\nit's got to get better at some point\nyeah something's got to give basically\nyeah i i for what it's worth i agree\nwith that i know it can be hard to\nhold on to that hope when you're kind of\ngetting fatty crit after fatty crit\nyeah right and left and i i really\napplaud essentially your resilience like\nbecause it's not easy to even hold on to\nthat much hope and it's it's actually\nokay to feel hopeless from time to time\nfrom what for what it's worth i i do\nthink that like karmically like you know\nyour life should get better at some\npoint\nyeah\nbut it sounds tough what do you do to\nsort of how do you manage these kinds of\nfeelings\num\n[Music]\nright now i'm isolating which is bad\nbut probably\num\n[Music]\nthis is like the\ni mean it's been a few days now i just\nhaven't talked to anyone about\nso talking to you is like oh\ni don't know\num\n[Music]\nother than that i'm how does it trying\nto do art but okay\nso i'm i'm hearing that all the stuff\nthat you should be doing right like oh\nlike oh leah you're feeling bad about\nyourself paint a picture and do some art\ntherapy meditate earlier do all of the\nthings and pull yourself out of the\ndarkness with all of your effort\nyeah exactly i'm eating and sleeping and\nyeah yeah i lay it's i don't know\nit's okay to get owned for a little\nwhile\nyou know for what it's worth i'm glad\nyou called in today how do you feel\nabout that\nyeah i am too\nit's just i didn't expect to be\nhere or talking to you and it's just\nlike\ni don't know i was like i was\nwanting someone to tell me\ngood things and\ni don't know it's just crazy\nwhat are you getting from this\nconversation\nam i telling you good things not i mean\nkind of\nyou're saying that you're hopeful and\nit is just crazy because i\nthe you know i've been listening to your\npodcast like\nevery day for like\na couple months or a few months so it's\njust surreal\nyou know\nyeah so i i don't know if like talking\nto me right now is like is good luck or\nbad luck like i don't know if this is\nlike positive karma in the sense that oh\nyou get to talk to dr k maybe this is a\nlucky break for you or it's like\nactually like bad rng because i can't\ntell you something to magically fix your\nlife\nso you got to talk to talk to dr k and\neven that didn't turn everything around\nlike which is it i don't i don't expect\nyou to turn everything around i don't i\ndon't mean lucky in like\na weird way just that\nsomeone who's helped me so much with\nlike feeling hope in the past and like\nyou're here now and\nit does make me feel like\nhopeful you know i don't know if this\nmakes sense or\ni you know i i don't quite get it but i\ndon't know that i need to i'm sorry\nno seriously i think the important thing\nis that you know so here's what i'm\nhere's what i'm hearing from you leia\nfirst of all like you've had\na a really crappy week basically\nwhere there's like national stuff that\nis is really really concerning for your\nfuture and the autonomy of your body\nthat's bad enough\nthere was a romantic rejection which is\nalso bad sounds like stuff on the job\nfront isn't going ideal and it sounds\nlike friends and family have recently\ndealt with death\nthat you kind of got like front and\ncenter\nright when you went home and so you're\nkind of getting like bodied on all sides\nand i think that like you know it's kind\nof interesting because\nfeeling hopeless in a situation like\nthis is actually like pretty normal\nyeah\nand and i i think you've sort of\nretreated into yourself and you're kind\nof like hibernating\nwhich is also okay\nand i'm really really glad that you\nprobably stepped out of your comfort\nzone a little bit and decided to come\nhere today\nand talk about it a little bit\nlike i i see you making taking steps\nforward\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nso\ni'm sorry i can't fix everything for you\ni i really wish i could i wish i could\ngive you a hug that would that's really\nwhat i think you need more than anything\nelse right now\num\nand also like there are things that i'm\ni'm really kind of\nhopeful about which is sort of weird\ni know that in terms of my spiritual\nunderstanding like\nsuffering was a huge huge part of\nforcing me to like look at my life and\nreally figure out what was important to\nme and like what i cared about\nas well as sort of understanding like\nhow to influence my mind and stuff like\nand i sort of see that in your path as\nwell that you sort of had this\nmeditative experience and now you're\ngoing through all of this crap and like\nit's hard for me to describe in any\nother way but\nwhat gives me hope is that people who\nhave transcendent transcend\ntranscendental experiences in meditation\nand then go through a bunch of crap are\nthe ones that actually do the best like\nthree to five years out\ninteresting i've seen that pattern time\nand time and time again\nand there's probably like some kind of\nbias there because you know i'm a\npsychiatrist so sometimes the people\nthat come to me are really in despair\nand then they sort of have this\ntranscendent\ntranscendent experience\nand then like\ni think now is the time\nleia where you've really got to figure\nout and you don't have to do this all at\nonce\nbut like what life is\nlike what does it mean to exist what\ndoes it mean like what part of you is\nreal what's your body what's your mind\nwhat's your soul\nand then hopefully through that process\nyou'll also begin to understand like the\ninfluence of karma karma on this cycle\nthat you're kind of going through and\nthings like that in terms of like these\nare all things that if you believe in\nthe theory of karma and reincarnation\nthis is sort of like\nyou're paying off all of your bad debts\nand this is what's really really\nchallenging for a lot of people is they\nthink that like you know paying off a\ndebt sucks definitely because you put in\ntime and effort and then you don't get\nanything for for it you know\nbut it doesn't continue forever what\ncontinues forever is if you continue\nmaking bad decisions\nright\nwhat do you think about\nall that random crap i just threw your\nway\nit i mean it makes me\nwonder you know cause\ni've thought a lot all right\ntried to think about like karma and like\nyou know are all these things\nbecause of\ni don't know just why you know good i i\nthink that's that's what i understand\nyeah so\noddly enough like that makes me hopeful\nfor you because like to be 21 and to ask\nwhy\nand here's the thing that i want you to\nreally think about like\nif you were if your life was like\ncompletely average you would not be\nasking why with the desperation that you\nare\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nif it doesn't let me know\noh it does i just yeah\nso so and this is what makes me hopeful\nis that that desperation is absolutely\nnecessary for true spiritual growth\nlike buddha had that desperation he was\nasking why his situation was a little\nbit luckier than yours in the sense that\nhe had everything and it sounds like in\nsome ways you've got nothing although i\nthink you've got\na lot actually so it sounds like you\nhave family you've got a cat you've got\nfriends who care about you you have us\nhere at the hg community right\nso yeah\num\nand and i think as you continue to ask\nthat why and then like the other thing i\ndo i'd say is like start taking care of\nyourself maybe a little bit better\nit's fine to have you know isolate for a\nlittle while but like i want you to\nreally think a little bit about\nconcretely like what you can manage\nin terms of like\nyou know taking a walk or meditating\nlike what do you think you can do\ndespite the fact that you're feeling\npretty down and hopeless\nis there something you think you can do\nlike in terms of taking care of yourself\nor supporting your body or mind a little\nbit better\num\ni don't know\ni feel like i'm doing\ntrying to i mean probably like talking\nto my friends\nokay would be\ngood\nor\num\nlike when i get a new job it'll be\neasier\nwhat makes it hard to do those things\nget a new job or talk to your friends\nwell the friends thing is like because\ni've been feeling this such intense\nheavy feeling i don't want them to feel\nresponsible for like um\nhow i feel or what i do you know i don't\nwant them to\nfeel like they have to fix things for me\nor anything\nokay\nbecause i know like i said i've i know\nlike\nit is at such a level that i know if\nthey try it's it's\ngonna just pull them into my\nhopelessness that i feel or like\nit sounds like you care about your\nfriends a lot and you're almost trying\nto protect them\nfrom you yeah yeah\nyeah what do you think about that yeah\ni don't know\nit's tough i know they're going through\nso much like and i feel like my\nfeeling this way is just gonna pull them\ndown you know\nwhat do you think they would say about\nthat\nthey would want me to talk to them but\ni just don't\nsee it being productive\nsometimes\nokay so as someone who's had a\ntranscendent\ntranscendent experience\nyou don't see it as being productive\nwhat is the you in that sentence\nthat's\nmy mind\nand how much can you trust your mind\nright now\nnot very much i guess\nwow\nso\ni'll give you one\ndo you want to explain the wow\nuh just like\nuh\nrealizing over and over like\noh i can't really trust\nmy\nthoughts at the moment\nyeah but it's interesting which is\npretty cool because your recognition\nthat you can't trust your thoughts is\nlike pretty neat right so you can sort\nof trust them\nyeah you just yeah right it's like no no\nyou can't trust your mind therefore you\ncan't trust the conclusion that you\ncan't trust your mind\nso yeah\nso this is the lay this is how\npurification of the mind works\nright so like a tiny part of your mind\njust got purified\nand and this is where like\nthis is where i kind of say that this\nyou know your life has given you good\nkarma and negative karma\nand it's your friend's karma to deal\nwith your crap\nand i want you to go into that\ninteraction so first of all i want you\nto reach out to your friends\nsecondly i want you to reach out to your\nfriends mentally prepared for what's\ngoing to happen\nyou're going to feel guilty\nagreed\nyeah\nthey're going to try to help you are\nthey going to problem solve validate or\nboth\nboth\nso when they problem solve what is your\nmind going to do to the problem solving\nresistant\nwhich is okay and when they validate\nwhat is your mind going to do\ni don't know i just feel like okay uh\nso your mind may resist that too\nyeah in a way right or just be\nindifferent to it kind of yeah so so let\nlet yourself be loved by your friends\nright and if you feel guilty because\nthey're helping you first of all they\nsigned up for that crap when they\ndecided to be your friend\nso that's part of their karma and also\nthis is the kind of thing where i want\nyou to accept their help and also pay it\nback\nyeah right so we've got two options to\nbe karmically neutral one is that they\ndon't help you and you don't help them\nor\nthey help you and you help them\nyeah and this is the kind of thing where\nwhat i see in society today is that like\nwe all need each other's help\nso are you getting help through this\nconversation\ni think so\nare you helping other people through\nthis conversation\npotentially\ni feel like there's a lot of\nhopelessness in the world right now and\npeople probably relate to that\ni think you're helping people a lot\nwhat do you think about that\nthat makes me want to like cry\nyeah i'm cheering up too\nwhat's going on\ni don't know\ncan i ask you a question sure\num spiritually\n[Laughter]\nthey're not bad tears i'm just surprised\noh my god\nokay go ahead are you okay dr candy you\nneed to talk\nyeah i know i'm talking about it i i can\nfeel my feelings\num you had a question\nyeah so like\nuh so the spiritual stuff i don't know\nwhere to go with it basically like\ni recognize\nlike\ni have a soul and that you know\nthere's probably all\ni mean karma and stuff but like i don't\nknow where to go with that it's a great\nquestion so um\nhere are a couple things that i'd\nrecommend the first is that you continue\npracticing\nso like ultimately\nlike the most important thing is going\nto be your experience because when you\nlike\nexperience things in meditation\nthat's like the core\nof the knowledge\nbut there's also another component which\nis i think what you're asking about\nwhich is like how do you make sense\nof what happens to you in meditation\nis that\nwhat you're kind of looking for\nyeah yeah so i'd say there are two\nthings you should do one is you should\ntry to find a sangha so a community of\nsome kind so see if like i you know i'm\nnot going to ask you where you live in\nthe united states um you know because\ndoxxing and all that but\nso like there's got to be some kind of\nlike meditation center community temple\nlike whatever in your area like even in\nthe most you know i'm from texas and\nlike\ntexas is not very in a sense pro\nmeditation but there there's a ton of\nmeditation stuff like all over the us\nnow\nso i i know it's going to feel kind of\nlike anxiety provoking but i would just\ngo to one of those places or call one of\nthose places and say hey i'm interested\nin learning more about meditation do you\nall have like lectures or like whatever\nso you can go to just any place and\nstart getting exposure\nand that's where basically your karma\nwill sort of like set you up for this\nkind of stuff where you may find\nyou know a couple places in your area\ntry a couple and just go there and just\nsee if you like the vibe\nyeah the other thing that you can do is\nis read so i think um you know like a\nlot of good meditation teachers that are\nintroductory like alan watts is really\ngood\num\nthere's also like uh you can sort of\nread like a commentary on patanjali's\nyoga sutras\nit's a little bit in a sense advanced\nbecause there's a lot of like esoteric\nconcepts in there\nbut i like um\nuh\nthe bhagavad gita by eknat\nis like a very very good\nintroductory concept\nintroductory book for western\npeople like who don't like sort of\ndidn't grow up with this culture\nthat's a real generally speaking\nregarded as a religious text from the\nhindu tradition so if that rubs you the\nwrong way you don't have to do that\num\ni don't know how to spell that that's\ntotally fine\ni think tech teller's gonna hook you up\nwith both of those okay thank you so\nmuch i'd start with you know a couple of\nbooks and then and then actually try to\ngo like hang out with people who\nmeditate\nand they probably will have like\nlectures and stuff\nthank you so much that's really helpful\nyou're
