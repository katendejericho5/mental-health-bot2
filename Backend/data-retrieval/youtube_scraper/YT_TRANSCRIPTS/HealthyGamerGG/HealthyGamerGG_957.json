    "transcript": "at first i thought that i would fall\nbehind on my work if i slowed down but i\nrealized that this quota was not\nsomething given to me it was something i\nwas giving myself\nwhat do you go by friend\nyeah my name's nick you can call me nick\nnick pleasure to meet you nick\nyeah you as well\nhow are you feeling today nick\ni'm feeling great uh my life kind of\nfeels like a a stream that's damn has\nbeen opened\nand still a few rocks left there but i'm\nflown in the right direction can you\ntell us about that\nyeah um i've been struggling a lot\nthroughout the past year or two\num a lot of mental health stuff in and\nout of therapy\nbut i'm starting to feel like my puzzle\npieces are coming together\nslowly\nyeah so i'd love to hear what what do\nyou think opened up the dam\num honestly a lot of introspection\ni\nkept thinking that problems were on the\noutside rather than being on the inside\ncan you give us an example of that\nyeah\ni\ni kept thinking that\nso i kept skipping between jobs because\ni would always get super burned out of\nthese jobs and i would always think oh\nthese jobs suck\nevery job i work sucks\ni'm never gonna find a job that i like\nbut i started to think maybe it's maybe\nit's me\nand and how did you\nhow did you start to think that\nwell if every job sucks\ni'm\nsort of the common denominator there\naren't i\nwell or all jobs suck\ntrue\nthat wouldn't be too fun but yeah it\ncould be an option and what did you\ndiscover through that process of\nintrospection what did you what did you\ndiscover about yourself that\nyou know what were you bringing with you\nto each of these jobs\ni was\nsort of\nit basically came down to the fact that\ni always rush myself\ncan you tell us about that\nyeah i\ni kept doing work at an absurd pace\nand\nit wasn't work burning me out i was\nburning myself out\nthat makes any sense yeah it makes a lot\nof sense usually i mean that's very\ncommon so do you have a sense of what it\nwas that was causing you to rush\nyourself\ni think it has to do with\nhow much\nthe cost of things keep increasing\nthe expectation that you've gotta you've\ngotta climb that ladder the second you\nhang on to it\nand\nyou've gotta be everyone's gotta be the\noffice star\nand if you're not then you're gonna get\npassed on\nyeah i mean so\nhow did you start to get because i\nyou know nick it it makes perfect sense\nwhen you say it but what i'm really\nstruggling to understand is that you\nknow noticing that or realizing that is\nsuch a big hard step for so many people\nhow did that happen for you\nwell\nso\ninterestingly enough um\nyou had introduced me to the idea of the\ndoshas\nand\nwhen i saw what a kapha was\ni realized\ni am rushing myself in ways that i don't\nthink i'm equipped for\nand if i sit back and slow it down a bit\ni can catch my pace a bit more\nso uh if i'm understanding you correctly\nyou've you're a kapha trying to live a\nbetha's life yes\nyeah that's and that's why yeah i've\nbeen you know and i had some issues with\ncoffee and stuff because i had to keep\nmyself going\nyeah yeah\nokay everything just made sense for me\nyeah yeah that dude that's classic man\nright it's so cla i'm so happy for you\noh my god\nyeah\num so how are you how are you doing with\nwork and stuff now\ni i've slowed down things i you know i\nget my tasks done slower but quality is\nincreased exponentially\nokay\nso uh yeah perfect so nick can you\nexplain to us\nwhat you want what kapha is and what\nresonated with you and how you decided\nto change it so let's start because like\npeople don't know what that is\nright um\nso from what i can recall off the top of\nmy head\nuh and you can correct me if i'm wrong\nhere kapha is the the earth water\ndosha yep and their style of motivation\nis sort of a slow roll\nwhere you're almost like a\na rock rolling down a hill and you have\nto gain your momentum over time\nyeah\nso just to give a little bit of context\nso generally speaking if we look at\nwestern science\nwestern science assumes all human beings\nare basically the same\nso if we think about even our model of\ndisease like so we'll think about\nyou know particular disease as being a\ndiscrete entity that exists outside of a\nperson or a\nprocess\nso we know for example that that's how\nwe sort of think about our model of\ndisease but we know that for example\nfrom five factor research that\npersonality is individual\nso we we've even sort of classified like\nindividuality in some ways\nso one of the things that's kind of\ninteresting is if we look at a lot of\npsychology we don't have psycho we have\npsychology of like personality\nbut we don't\nlook at personality is being a\nfundamental part of many of our\npsychological principles\nso for example we don't think about\ndepression\nas manifesting differently in people of\na particular personality type versus\nanother personality type\nactually our our disease model and our\npersonality model are completely\nseparate right no one says\nanyway so if that sort of makes sense\nand so one of the key things about the\nayurvedic system is that they don't\nseparate\ndisease from the person so there's no\nway to have a disease without some kind\nof person involved what that sort of\nresults in is that the idea of disease\nand health is much more of an individual\noriented process as opposed to like a\nclassification that applies to a\nthousand people\nso one of the key principles of ayurveda\nis that there are three basically\nforces within our body that they sort of\nuse\nelements to kind of describe\naspects of these essentially\npersonalities is what you can call them\nand the interesting thing about this\nstuff is that you know these are all\nsort of heuristics which means that\nthey're tools for understanding but\nthere isn't really a whole lot of\nscientific evidence that this is like\nactually exists so there's not like you\nknow you can't biopsy someone a kapha\nand find earth and water inside them\nthe key thing though is that what i've\nreally found is that so some of the\ntreatments of iron in iowa that have\nbeen sort of scientifically verified but\nthe core principles there's very very we\nused to say that there was very strong\ngenetic evidence actually based on\ncriticism from our community in a\nthorough literature review that evidence\nexists but it's actually very\npreliminary and the effect size is quite\nsmall\nso these are like preliminary datas that\nshow some indication that there's a\ngenetic component to this stuff but it's\nfar from conclusive\nthat being said what we tend to find is\nwhen we talk to people like nick that\nthere are a lot of people for whom this\nsystem of understanding can be\ntransformative in terms of like how to\nunderstand yourself\nand essentially what what we\ntalked about is that there are um you\nknow depending on what your primary\ndosha is you have a particular like\nmotivational style\nand so nick is a earth water type\nso much like an earth water pokemon he's\nkind of like tanky\nand he's resilient but it takes him some\ntime to get started and oftentimes if\nyou try to like push yourself too far\nyou can kind of burn yourself out\nand\ngenerally speaking most of our what we\nthink of as being successful is like the\nfire type which is like\ndriven ambitious like we think of\nambition as a flatly good thing we don't\nrealize that you don't have to be that\nambitious to be very successful\nprofessionally like it's not necessarily\nthat you need to be ambitious you could\njust care a lot about what you do that's\nnot necessarily ambition\nso a lot of these assumptions that we\nmake about what it takes to be\nprofessionally successful but the key\nthing about this ayurvedic motivational\nstyle perspective is that if you\nunderstand yourself you can start to\nadjust to your individual personality\nand then hopefully if you're like nick\nyou'll stop burning yourself out and\nstart to feel like happier at work\nwas that\ndid you do that make sense nick what do\nyou think yeah okay perfectly\nso\nyou said you started to slow down a\nlittle bit\nwere you afraid that\nthat wouldn't work\nyeah uh at first\nbecause that's a risk you know\ncan you tell us about\nthat experience of slowing down\nyeah i\ni have to constantly remind myself to\nnot rush myself because it's almost\nsecond nature\nto try to\nkeep up as it were\nand it's tough to struggle\nto slow down in a world that keeps\nwanting us to go faster and faster\nas things change\nuh\ndo you know as expectations increase it\nseems\nyeah so i i don't know how else to say\nthis than nick but like\ni mean like how do you do that because\naren't you like paranoid that if you\ndon't speed up you're gonna be left\nbehind\nwell\ni don't i don't really think that i can\nbe left behind necessarily\ni i just feel like\nat first i thought that i would fall\nbehind on my work if i slowed down but i\nrealized that this quota was not\nsomething given to me it was something i\nwas giving myself\nit might be a little different if you\nactually have a work quota yeah being\njoining i think it's interesting how\nmany\nhow much\npeople take on responsibilities at work\nthat are actually not assigned to them\nyeah\nthat's that's something i i learned i\nthat i was\nall this this big work that was getting\nthrown at me that was burning me out was\nwas me that was me doing that\nyeah so we see this a lot we recently\nlaunched a career coaching program\nand one of the key parts of our career\ncoaching program so a lot of people\nthink it's just like okay how do i get\npromoted but a big part of our program\nis that we\nfocus on like the individual\nso\nwhat are a lot of the\nexpectations that you're putting on\nyourself\nor how does your ego manifest at work in\nterms of signing up for things you know\nwanting credit feeling like other people\noutshine you and so if you feel like\nsomeone is outshining you at work you'll\nwork harder to get credit but there's a\ndifference between feeling like other\npeople outshine you and people actually\noutshining you\nand so there's that individual component\nthat i think a lot of people sort of\nlose\nin terms of like career advice\nwe sort of assume that\nwhat our mind produces in terms of\nassessing a work situation is accurate\nwhich is a huge problem\nyeah\nyeah my brain was not being accurate\nwith me that's for sure\nyeah so\nhow did you learn how to slow down\nwell i\nand this kind of came to me both through\nself-introspection and therapy\nbut\nrealizing that these quotas were on\nmyself\ni i had to take that leap where okay\nwell what if i what if i didn't move so\nquick\num what if instead of multitasking i\nfocused on one thing at a time\nand it it took a lot of it took some\ntime for me to accept that it was okay\nbut\nalso being open with your co-workers\nyour supervisor\nthat you work at a different pace\nwas something that i did with great\nsuccess\njust letting people know that hey i do\nreally good work but i have to take my\npace\nawesome so that that sounds like\nsomething that a lot of people would\nhave trouble doing is letting your\nsupervisor know\nhey i have\nyou know this is sort of how i work the\nbest and notifying people of that\nso it sounds like you're doing great\nnick\nyeah i i'd like to think so that's\nawesome dude thank you so much for\ncalling in and stuff anything that you\nwant to talk about in particular or any\nquestions you have\num\ni don't\ni guess just\nhow to be\na positive light with others that are\nhaving a good time without being\ni guess the word they use is toxic\npositivity\nhelp me understand because i yeah go\nahead\nyeah so i like to think of myself as a\npositive guy\nwhen i'm with people i'm all i'm\nalways the optimist\nbut\ni don't want to come off as undermining\ntheir issues\nbecause some people take\nthat positivity as saying that their\nconcerns aren't real\nor\nyou know it kind of when people say if i\nsay something positive and they're like\noh thanks but i'm cured\nyou cured my depression with your words\nand they kind of take it as an affront\nyeah and and what what kind of stuff\nwould you say\ni\ni kind of would just be there for them\nand say hey that that really sucks but\nyou know things can be temporary\nokay so i get as an example\nyeah so that may not be you know i\nrecognize that that was potentially an\nartificial example so let's i'm to give\nyou one very practical tip nick\nand then one more\nglobal tip which i think is more aligned\nwith where you are\nso the first is if i say yeah it sucks\nbut things are temporary what is the\nmeaning of the word but in that sentence\nuh\nlike\nit's kind of downplaying in a way yeah\nnick i i think you're a great guy but\nbut yeah\nbut i think you're not you know like\nyeah okay so the first is i'd eliminate\nbut from your vocabulary when you're\ntrying to be\nempathetic that's like it's like one of\nthe best tips i can give you so\nliterally when we train to become\ntherapists\nwe remove the word but from our\nvocabulary\nlike i almost never or i use it very\nintentionally\nokay so if you're trying to get someone\nto see the other side of a coin don't\nuse but use and\nand\nokay the other thing is that i think you\ntake it for granted how far you've come\nand to recognize that\na lot of people who are suffering are\nlike not where you are so kaphas tend to\nbe uh more imp like they tend to be very\nunderstanding and very resilient and so\ni think you've just got to realize that\nlike this is like\nyou know telling a 15 year old who's\nnever had a girlfriend that they're\ngonna be okay and their decent chance\nthat they're gonna get married and have\nkids and all that kind of stuff they're\ngonna get laid one day they're just not\nthey're not ready for it right they just\ndon't understand that\nlike they just can't understand that\nand so what i'd say in terms of the\npositivity is like\nlead by example instead of explanation\nyou know and and that's where like don't\ndon't try to create expectations for\nthem in the future where like\nthey'll come to you but i would i would\nalmost be like more\nstable as opposed to like\npulling them or pushing them in a\nparticular direction\nso just slow it down\nthe way that you have it work\nright you don't need to inject them with\nhope right this second\ni get you so j just let they'll come to\nyou and so so that you know like what'll\nhappen over time you were you're sort of\nsaying like how do i share my positivity\nwith others without it being toxic and\nthat's like the way is that that you\nif you want to be a positive person\nit's not something you do to other\npeople\nit's not like hey take my positivity hey\npositivity positivity positive that's\nwhen it becomes toxic\ninstead like if you want to be a light\nin people's life like you just\nyou just\nshine\nin your own way\nright and don't try to like point it\nit's don't be a spotlight\njust be a light bulb and let it be like\nrelatively diffuse and then they will\ncome to you they're probably sensing it\nto begin with which is why they maybe\ncome to you with their problems but then\njust like let them sit in your general\nvicinity and kind of just you know slow\nit down a little bit\nmoving too fast wanting to help yep yep\nright so i think you're you're trying to\nget you're trying to catch them up to\nwhat you've learned i have no doubt that\nyou believe like you you're able to see\nboth sides of the situation\nright but like that's hard for a lot of\npeople so like just slow it down which\nyou've already learned so lean into that\nyeah all right all right cool man\nall right take it easy take it easy\nbuddy you you too i'm really happy that\nyou're doing well and thank you so much\nfor sharing i think far too often this\ncommunity becomes i don't think we\nrealize because\nwe reach out to the people who sometimes\nneed help that\nyou know there are a lot of people in\nthis community who are actually doing\nreally really well and like benefit from\nwhat we do here and like they actually\njust do okay that's kind of like yeah\nyeah\nyou know yep so i'm i'm hoping to help\nsome gamers become healthy gamers that's\nawesome dude and i think you calling in\ntoday and just sharing your story and\nyour perspective is a fantastic example\nof just\nradiating whatever you are\nawesome\ntake care man\nyeah you as well\nyou"
