    "transcript": "this is a place where we want you to\nbuild a life that's worth living\nand then go live that life that's\nactually the mission of this community i\nwant to tell y'all something that's\nsuper cool that's going on\nso\num we recently started something called\nthe touch grass campaign on our discord\nchannel\nand like sometimes i've seen posts\nrecently or i see these posts a lot on\non the internet about like you know\npeople like upset me on the internet\nand so what people will sort of do is\nthey'll say like okay go touch bro\ngo touch grass right so like people on\nthe internet and the way that people\nrespond to each other on the internet is\nnot actually real life\nthat perspective i think is a little bit\nsimplistic because i think actually\nwhat's happening is the internet is\nbecoming real life\nso this is where for example if you look\nat dating like\ndating apps are actually replacing\nin-person interactions in the first\nstage of relationships\nso what we decided to do is some awesome\npeople on our discord and in our\ncommunity this is their brainchild\ndecided to put together a campaign in\nthe month of july to help our community\ngo out and do stuff\nso i can stream on twitch and i can we\ncan you can watch videos on youtube and\nall that good stuff and you can learn\nabout yourself but at the end of the day\nit's still you sitting in front of a\nscreen\neven in terms of that's part of the\nreason that we developed a coaching\nprogram is because like we wanted to\nhelp people actually work through their\nindividual problems and like figure out\nokay what's going on with your\nmotivation set goals for yourself hold\nyourself accountable figure out you know\nwhat is your ego what is your identity\nthat gets in the way of things like do\nall of that\nindividual kind of deep work so we\ndeveloped a coaching program\nthe thing is\nthose are like two ends of the spectrum\neven in terms of coaching there's a\nshortcoming right because at the end of\nthe day let's say you spend one hour a\nweek with your coach they're formulating\ngoals you're developing a game plan\nyou're sort of executing on some of that\nstuff\nbut like it's still one hour a week with\nyour coach\nthere are a lot of health benefits to\ndoing things like going out plant\naerosols can be good for feelings of\nanxiety you know vitamin d deficiency\ncan make you more vulnerable to covid\nand make you more vulnerable to\ndepression so at some point we got to\nget people to go out and do things and\nso that's what the touch grass campaign\nis about\nand so what i want to do for a few\nminutes is actually share with y'all\nsome of this stuff\nso this is our submissions channel\nfor the touch grass campaign\nand what we wanted to let me see yeah\nit's it's over here is like so the touch\ngrass campaign\ninvolves\num\nit's a essentially a photo challenge\nto get people going outside and\nbasically like the ranked number one on\nthe leaderboard at the end of the\ncontest gets a merch store gift card um\nfree access to dr k's guide i guess i'm\ngonna sign a secret item for them\nand um top five on the leaderboard get\nfree access as well the other thing is i\nthink a uh um\nour winner randomly picked at the end of\nthe contest also gets all of the above\nrewards so there's like number one on\nthe leaderboard and a random winner so\nif you just participate at all there's a\nchance you can win\na number one rule of the challenge is\npixie or it didn't happen um you don't\nhave to show your face right so we want\nto preserve anonymity please don't edit\npictures things like that but i just\nwant to show you all the submissions so\nthis is what i love about our community\ni wish this is some way i can\nzoom in\nhow do you zoom into discord\nokay\nso like someone cleaned their room like\nthis is fantastic\ni don't know exactly what this is a\npicture of i

challenge\nuh it's it's one of our so i think for\nsome reason like our discord has really\nbeen like our mods and team on discord\nhave really been doing an awesome job\nrecently\nand like this is\nso if we want to put together our lives\nwe've got to meet you where you're at\nand that's on the internet\nbut the goal of coming to this stream\nand like being a part of this community\nis to actually leave\nthat's the goal\nright and if there's one thing that\nseparates us from a cult\nit's that\nwe don't the goal is to actually leave\nand maybe that\nyou know this is what we want like we're\nhere to help you i i'm here to help you\nin whatever way that i can educate you i\nguess\nand then like at some point though you\nall have to go out and start\nliving your life right and we're not\nasking you to leave anytime soon\nso hang around for a little while maybe\npay it forward a little bit but this is\na place where we want you to build a\nlife that's worth living\nand then go live that life that's\nactually the mission of this community\nand when we started it we were like\ntrying to figure out like some kind of\nnew like cool name like oh my god like\nlet's come up with like neuro brain\nmind champ\nchamp\nneuro there's like there was like a set\nof prefixes and suffixes that we could\nuse when we were trying to figure out\nokay what are we going to be\nbut at the end of the day we're not sort\nof like an abstinence only sort of\nperspective right it's like technology\ncan be a healthy part of your life\nbut it should be a part of your life it\nshouldn't be all of your life and what\nwe love to do more than anything else\nis help you build a life that's worth\nliving\nand whether if you're at the point where\nyou\ncan't clean your room that's actually\ntotally fine if all you can do is listen\nto some guy talk on the internet if we\ncan sort of like if you're just watching\nyoutube videos or whatever just like\nsitting around like listening to stream\nhopefully we can influence you a little\nbit that way that's totally fine if\nyou're not ready to go out and do\nsomething don't go out and do something\nand at some point if you're ready to do\na little bit more join our discord\nif you're some at some point you're\nready to do a little bit more go out and\ntouch grass\ndo parts of this touch grass challenge\nwe're not going to get anything out of\nit there's something the only thing that\npeople are going to get out of it is\nwhat you put into it\nthis this touch grass challenge is a\nchance for you to go and look at the\nnight sky and get away from all of these\nscreens\nand just look up at the sky that human\nbeings have been looking up at that same\nsky for literally millions of years\nthere is a piece of history out there\nwho knows what else is out there\nright we have like\nlike these cool telescopes that are\ngetting us new pictures now and stuff\nlike that like who knows what's out\nthere\nbut you can look out there and you can\nwonder at that just the way that\neveryone else does and then what so and\nso tweeted and how someone responded and\nall that kind of stuff it all becomes\nless important when you're just like\nstargazing\nand what's happened is that our life has\nbeen dominated by like artificial stuff\nwe as a society have been\ntaught\nthat a lot of stuff is important that\nactually isn't important\nright so and so got banned from twitter\nthis thing happened on twitter like\nthat's not real life\nand so we try to teach that to you all\nthrough meditation right that's where\nyou can some connect with yourself a\nlittle bit we've got stuff like this on\ndiscord for those of you that are really\ninterested in in sort of developing like\na concrete plan and figuring out what\nyou are when you're really ready for a\nhigher level of self-work that's why we\nhave a coaching program\nright so we recognize that some people\nare just at the\nyou know i'm just like kind of like\ncurious about it\ni don't want to commit to anything i\ndon't want to do anything i just want to\nlearn which is totally fine\nsome of y'all are at the stage where\nlike okay i want to do a little bit more\nwhich is what discord is for and for\npeople who are interested in sort of\ngoing you know like really sort of\nfiguring out okay i need someone's help\nand i'm willing to put in time and\nenergy on a week to week basis to\nimprove our life that's what coaching is\nfor\nwe also have dabbling kind of stuff too\nso the social sandbox on our discord is\none of the best events that we've ever\nhad just super cool so this is like a\nplace that you can go that's run by an\nhg coach\ncompletely free by the way and just a\nchance for you all to learn about\ncommunication skills and practice\ncommunication skills\nso if you're just like struggling to be\na better communicator or you're shy or\nyou just need practice with strangers on\nthe internet before you go out in the\nreal world that's why we have programs\nlike that or workshops like that i guess\nis a better way to put it\nso we're doing what we can\nbut at the end of the day\nwe can only do so much and the most\nimportant person in this process is\nactually you\nso what are you going to do you're going\nto go out and touch grass you're going\nto meditate today\ngood luck\nyou"
