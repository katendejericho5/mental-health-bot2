    "transcript": "a lot of people misunderstand this\nbecause they think that fixing an\ninsecurity is the way to overcome it but\nfixing an insecurity is not overcoming\nit that is actually feeding into it so\nthe weirdest thing about overcoming\ninsecurities is that fixing insecurities\nis not overcoming them in fact it just\nreinforces it it just makes it go\ndormant so this is the difference\nbetween fearlessness and courage very\ndifferent things to be courageous is to\novercome your fear to have the fear and\nto overcome it to be Fearless is to\nremove the fear and then if it returns\nyou won't have courage right so I can do\nsomething like get drunk to overcome my\nfear get some good old social courage I\nmean liquid courage and social lubricant\nbefore I go ask someone out on a date\nthat doesn't getting drunk doesn't\novercome my insecurity it just makes it\ntemporarily disappear"
