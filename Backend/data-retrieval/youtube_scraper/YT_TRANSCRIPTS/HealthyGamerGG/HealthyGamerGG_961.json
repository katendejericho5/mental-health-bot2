    "transcript": "making this relationship work requires\ntwo people\nyou cannot fix this all on your own\nmy boyfriend's lost hope in life is\neither gaming or sleeping and refuses to\nget\ntherapy he isn't the man that i met and\ni'm at a loss\ni met my boyfriend a little over a year\nago we instantly clicked\nthis is a long distance relationship we\nmet over mutual friends and would spend\nhours together watching movies and tv\nshows playing cooperative and\ncompetitive games doing silly\npersonality tests essentially sharing\nour worlds with each other\ni loved getting to discover what he\nloved and he felt and believed he felt\nthe same about me\nhe was in university studying to be a\nsoftware engineer he was really\npassionate about his this career we'd\nspend a lot of calls sitting together as\nhe wrapped up assignments and then moved\non to spending hours upon hours talking\nand laughing together\na couple months into the relationship\nhis depression came back\nit affected the end of his semester i\nspent a lot of time with him offering\nsupport as best as i could\ni obviously was not trying to fix him or\nwhatever but just to be there and adapt\nour little routine and time together to\naccommodate his lower energy and\npreference for familiar and comfortable\nthings\nwe got to meet in september but when i\ngot back home everything got worse a\ncouple episodes were taken out on me in\noutbursts of anger and criticism but i\nunderstand that this isn't him it's the\ndepression affecting him\nbecause of the variant and travel\ndisruptions we were not able to see each\nother during his winter break\nthis caused an episode where he\nthreatened to take his own life calling\nme a coward for being too afraid to\ntravel with all the uncertainty swirling\naround\nour first flight got cancelled and it\nseemed like everything was getting worse\nand worse and i wanted to be safe\nin retrospect we would have been fine\nand i regret the decision i made we\ntalked it over it was forgiven\nhis mental health tanked and got even\nworse he'd take my need for reassurance\nout on me\nfeeling like it was undermining the\nunderstanding we had in our relationship\nit's a little hard to not need\nreassurance every so often when the\nperson you're with is quite cold and\njaded\nhe dropped out of university in february\nhe's he'd sit around playing games all\nday\nwe tried making plans for\nme to come over for his birthday but\ngetting three weeks off in the middle of\nmidterms in a place staffed by college\nstudents is rather difficult\nthings got postponed to april\nthen i caught coven man can't catch a\nbreak\nmy work workplace counted these as days\noff anyway so as you can imagine getting\nthose three weeks off has been\nincredibly difficult and mentally taxing\nhe's taken it out on me every time gets\nup yells shut gets upset yells shuts\ndown emotionally i understand that it\nfeels frustrating and that i'm not doing\nenough but it's also affecting me\nhe doesn't have a passport\nwe've been talking about him getting it\nsince november but he hasn't done it\nlack of motivation and debt he quit his\njob as well\nthree weeks ago we had a big fight\nregarding his overall mental state\naffecting me i workshopped and wrote a\nlarge google doc laying out the\nsituation since normal discussions have\nalways turned into big blowout fights\nand me seeming unreasonable so i thought\na concise text would work i thought it\ndid\ni asked him if he could try therapy\nagain he's been so adamantly against it\nbut i just want to him to give it one\nlast shot\nmaybe it's silly of me but he agreed he\nwas soft and sweet and something i\nhadn't seen in him in months i decided\nto put my faith in him again\nfast forward to the other night where i\nhave to beg him to call to get on a call\nwith me to have some one-on-one time we\nhadn't had that in days when he'd\npromised we'd work on that since it was\nso important before when i expressed\nthat hey i'd like to be able to watch\nthings or playing play games together\nlike we used to like you told me we\ncould do again he got upset\nin the escalating discussion i asked if\ntherapy was getting anywhere even just a\nfirst step he told me he didn't have the\nmotivation anymore that he didn't want\nto and he only agreed because he felt\nlike i was holding him hostage\nlike i'd leave him if he did if i didn't\nif he didn't i assume\ni understood then and there that maybe\neverything we spoke about he only told\nme what i wanted to hear so i wouldn't\nleave him the thought destroys me\nthe conversation ended with him telling\nme it is just very crushing and\nbelittling that it really feels like you\ndon't love me as is\nhow can i make him understand that i\ndon't love him any less but that it's\nincredibly difficult to be there to to\nalways keep trying but be met with a\njaded and emotionless person\ni want him to get better i miss\nhow things used to be so much and i\nstill get glimpses of that every now and\nthen when i and i really really love him\nbut also it's damaging me\nit's been a week he's gotten bad news\nrelated to a possible career path and\nhas been gaming non-stop\nhe's either been very sweet to me or\nvery upset because of his games i\nhaven't brought up therapy since i'm at\na loss tldr my boyfriend's depression\nhas turned him into another person and\nif he he feels it's inconsiderate to not\nlove him at his worst when it's\ndestroyed me to watch him fall back down\nto rock bottom i'm at a loss as to what\nto do\ni don't want to leave him but also it's\nbeen shown to me he'll say whatever just\nto make me stay not because he actually\nwants to change\nso this is super challenging\nsupporting a partner\nwho is depressed and spends all their\ntime playing video games and\nrefuses to go to therapy\ncan be absolutely devastating\nbecause you're kind of stuck between\nthis like rock in a hard place right so\non the one hand you're their partner\nso as their partner\nit's your job\nto support them be there for them\nencourage them also you try to be\nunderstanding right so like i understand\nthat my partner struggles with\ndepression so it's hard they don't feel\nmotivated they have low energy like they\nlash out at me sometimes but it's not\nthem it's the depression\nso you make allowances for the\ndepression because that's what you have\nto do that's what a supportive partner\ndoes\nbut then like it gets tricky right\nbecause then they start saying things\nlike but like this is a situation that\nis tricky because\nit's unclear whether the support will\nactually fix stuff\nso if your partner has depression there\nare some things that they need to be\ndoing\nright like they need to go see a\ntherapist they need to\nlike\nfigure out what's going on with school\nor like take time off or like whatever\nthey need to probably spend less time\nplaying video games because that's not\nhelping\nthe other really tricky thing here is\nbut if you try to push them to do that\nit's like how do you decide okay like if\nthey're depressed and they don't believe\nthat therapy works but they need to get\ntherapy like how much do you push them\nas a partner\nif you push them a lot does that just\nlike kind of backfire in your face and\nis that like does that make sense it's\nlike where is where is the under being\nan emotionally a supportive and\nunderstanding partner end\nand like pushing them to take\naccountability and responsibility like\nwhere is that fine line\nbecause if you push it too hard then\nwhat your partner says is like you don't\naccept me as i am you don't love me\nunconditionally\nand that's a blow and it's like okay so\ni guess if i want to love you\nunconditionally that means that i have\nto just let you ride this out and like i\ncan't do i can't criticize you\ni just have to take i can't even have\ndemands for my own emotional needs\nright because like i'm in this\nrelationship too and this is hard for me\ntoo and i want to spend time with you i\nlove you\nbut you can't tell them that because if\nyou tell them that then they feel\nguiltier it causes them to spiral more\ninto the depression and whenever you\npush them like if you really do push\nthem they'll tell you whatever you want\nto hear because they're afraid of you\nleaving\nthey're afraid of you leaving but\nthey're not gonna actually do anything\nto make it worth your while to stay\nyou'll get that\nso it's tough and then if you break up\nwith them then you're the [ __ ]\nwho like abandoned their partner when\nthey were depressed when everything in\nthis person's life is falling apart\nwhen all they needed was your love and\nyour support and your help you can't\nabandon them when they've dropped out of\ncollege gotten fired from their job or\nplaying video games already had a\nsuicidal attempt\nyou're the one thing they've got less\nleft\nin the one source of emotional support\nand they're sucking you dry\nso what do you do in this situation\nbecause if you're paying attention i\ndon't know if you all been looking at\nchat you could look at the comments i'm\nsure on youtube video if this gets\nuploaded but everyone's like dump him\nleave him dump him leave him\nman this guy like\ndoesn't deserve you\nthe internet\nloves to tell us to dump\npeople abandon people\nthey're not the ones who have to like\nsever the connection they're not the\nones who really really love the person\nso they can say leave them easy\nyou you deserve better you deserve\nbetter man like stop dating this man\nchild oh my god\ndump him move on man\nright so there's literally someone who\nsaid dump him who cares lol obviously\nthis person cares they're in love\nright like they're in love\nyou all know like if you're if you're\nthinking oh my god this person should\njust jump if you've been in love you\nunderstand like how hard it is to do\nthings the other thing is like you want\nto be it's not just you being in love\nyou want to be a good human being\ndo good human beings abandon people when\nthey're sick\nno\nwe don't do that we help people who are\nsick\nthe problem is that like helping like\nwent like i don't know how to help\nbecause i'm being emotionally supportive\nand things are getting worse\nso this is a really challenging\nsituation to be in\nand the uh most the most dangerous thing\nabout this is if you're in this\nsituation you're probably terrified\nbecause at the end of the day\nmaking this relationship work requires\ntwo people\nyou cannot fix this all on your own\nand you're trying to figure out okay\nwhat's the right thing for me to do\nbut it's gotta involve them at some\npoint\nso how do you tackle this situation the\nfirst is\nit's hard let's acknowledge that right\nit's hard on you it's hard on them it's\nhard on everyone that's what illness\ndoes\nit's not like some everything balances\nout in the end that's not how it is\nwhen someone like when you know if two\npeople are married and one of them gets\ncancer there's no you know like that\njust sucks for everyone\nit doesn't really matter who it sucks\nmore for it sucks for everyone involved\nit just negatively impacts the\nrelationship just makes everything\nharder\nso it's okay for it to be hard\nat the same time there are a couple\nthings you've got to understand and a\ncouple things that really need\nto be done\nthe first thing to understand is that\nyou cannot save this relationship on\nyour own\nyour partner needs to put in time and\neffort\nnow this is where like this is kind of\nlike a you're kind of stuck there\nbecause if you tell them\nthat you need to put in time and effort\nthey feel bad about themselves maybe\nthey get suicidal maybe they start\nsaying things that make you feel guilty\nlike you don't love me as i am\nright so they like respond in unhealthy\nways and if you tell them hey like i\nneed more from this relationship that\nmakes things worse for them so you kind\nof feel like you're stuck you can't tell\nthem what your needs are but you've got\nto and we'll share with you how so the\nfirst thing that we're going to kind of\nso now that we've acknowledged that next\nthing that we need to talk about is the\nrelationship of gaming and depression\nso we don't know if this person has a\nclinical depression or not whatever they\nneed to get evaluated for that\nbut in the treatment in psychiatric\ntreatment of addictions\nthere's a very important principle\ncalled dual diagnosis treatment\nso this is the kind of thing where the\nclassic example is alcohol\nwhen you have someone who has major\ndepressive disorder or bipolar disorder\nand they have an alcohol problem\nyou can't just fix one both of them need\nto be tackled at the same time because\nhere's what happens if i feel depressed\nand alcohol is my coping mechanism\ni use the alcohol to numb my feelings of\ndepression as i start to drink more it\ninterferes with my sleep reduces rem\nsleep as i start to sleep\nworse\nmy brain's ability to heal itself and\ncome out of the depression gets\nnegatively impacted in addition alcohol\nis literally a cns central nervous\nsystem depressant so alcohol makes our\nmood worse\nin addition to doing things like messing\nwith our our dietary intake and all that\nkind of stuff so we can't like we're not\neating the right kind of food maybe we\nhave a little bit of inflammation of the\npancreas from alcohol and all this kind\nof stuff happens and then our depression\ngets worse\nif you start drinking a lot there's also\nsomething called a substance induced\nmood disorder so that's where a lot of\nalcohol can actually trigger a\ndepressive episode\nso if i'm depressed\nand i don't focus on the sobriety i'm\ngoing to use the alcohol to numb the\ndepression and it'll actually make the\ndepression worse\nthe flip side is also true\nif i have if i know i'm an alcoholic but\ni have an undiagnosed major depressive\ndisorder\ni can control the drinking until the\ndepression comes\nand like i can manage the drinking if\ni'm in a stable mindset but if the\ndepression is untreated then i'm going\nto relapse on alcohol\nright i'm sober i'm working so hard\nworking so hard working so hard i start\nto have suicidal thoughts i start to\nhave negative thoughts i start to beat\nmyself up and like the depression takes\nover and causes me to relapse\nbecause in order to keep the alcohol\nunder control in order to stay sober i\nneed to have a healthy and strong mind\nso what have we learned in psychiatry\nyou've got to target both the same time\nyou can't fix half the problem because\nthey feed on each other\nand this is what i personally have seen\nwith video games as well\nso i start to feel depressed don't have\nany energy don't feel like doing\nanything so like what's the one thing\nthat's very easy for me to do gives me\nsome kind of stimulation and they hit a\ndopamine is play video games\nas i play video games for hours and\nhours and hours a day what does it do it\nruins my mood\nhelps me get through the hour but ruins\nthe day that's the problem with video\ngames\nso your your boyfriend plays video games\nto get through the hour get through the\nnext hour get through the next hour\nruins his day ruins your day and snaps\nat you because he's angry\nand then you're stuck once again because\nhow much of him snapping at me is him\nbeing inconsiderate\nhow much of it is his depression and how\nmuch of it is in the video games the\nbasic problem of dating someone who's\ndepressed\nis how much can i blame them for what's\ngoing on\nhow much responsibility am i allowed if\ni love someone who's depressed how much\naccountability do i put on their\nshoulders\nand that's the real bind because in our\nattempt to be supportive and be loving\nwe actually excuse all of their behavior\nand the moment we excuse all of their\nbehavior the relationship really starts\nbecoming doomed\nbecause you can't fix everything\neven if they're depressed that doesn't\nmean that they're incapable of stuff\nso what's the right balance\nso this is where what i would say is\nthere are two or three very concrete\nthings that you can do\nin order to like try to make this\nrelationship work\nthe first thing that you've got to do is\nmanage your own emotions\nthat doesn't mean you have to manage\nthem yourself\nbut you have to recognize that this\nrelationship is having a toll and cost\non you\nthose negative emotions are going to be\nhaving all kinds of un helpful effects\non your mindset your cognitive biases\nthings like that like so i think the\nreason that everyone's saying leave him\nis because\npeople who are in this situation are\nmisattributing something so i think that\nhe's responsible for more here than like\nyou're holding him accountable for\nright so like\ni mean\nthat's what i believe but we'll sort of\nget to how to have that conversation\nbut the first thing is that you've got\nto kind of take care of yourself and if\nyour partner isn't in a space\nto help you emotionally process i don't\nknow how else you do it but lean on\nfriends lean on family lean on other\nonline connections\nwork with a therapist yourself work with\na coach as long as there's not something\nclinical going on\nright\nand a coach can definitely help you with\nthis next part as well so you have to\ntry to manage your own emotions and like\ntake like self-care like meditate\nwhatever go for a run whatever you need\nto do start playing games with other\npeople whatever\nthen what happens is you need to have a\nconversation with him\nand this is a conversation where it's\ngoing to be painful\nbut it needs to be kind of like calm\nand\nand like you need to kind of be patient\nthis is why it's important for you to be\nemotionally in a good space so that you\ncan\nsay things in a way that are\ncompassionate but still accountable\nand this is what i have helped patients\ndo\nand this is also to a certain degree\nwhat we\ntry to have coaches help people do so\ncoaches can help you all\npractice communication and learn\ncommunication clarify your own thoughts\nand feelings so that you can communicate\neffectively\nso\ni think you have to have like a\nconversation with your boyfriend about\nlike\nwhat's happening in this relationship so\nwhat you want to do is i'm going to give\nyou some sample dialogue\nright so you want to start by asking\nlike you know how are you feeling\nnowadays\nlike can you tell me a little bit about\nwhat's hard in your life and like\nwhat are you afraid of\nso just ask open-ended questions that\nare non-accusatory so try to understand\nwhere their mindset is don't offer any\nof your own opinions is the first step\njust try to get a sense of where they\nare\nthen what you want to do so you've got\nto be careful because as you ask\nquestions\nthat get to the root of the problem\nthey're going to hurt\nit's going to be like a sore point where\nlike your boyfriend is not going to want\nto talk about it\nbecause the more that you ask him a\nquestion that he doesn't have a good\nanswer to it brings the shame to the\nsurface that's the shame that they try\nto drown out with the video games\nbut if it's left under the surface\ninfesters like it's not going to go away\nso this is where i'd start by asking\nlike you know a couple of questions\nabout\nso actually before you you can ask them\nwhat can i do to to support you like\nwhat what do i do that's helpful\nfor you\nokay so like here's how you feel okay i\nunderstand like this is hard for your\nenergy level sucks this is bad this is\nbad okay what can i do to help you\nand then comes the next question is like\nwhat can you do to help you this is what\ni'm going to do\nto support your health what are you\ngoing to do to support your health\nand this is where like\ngets tricky\nthis is where there are also other\nconversations about like where do you\nsee this going\nlike help me understand what to expect\nfrom this relationship\nand this is where you know like if he's\nlike afraid that you're gonna leave him\nand you can say like yeah i mean\nhonestly like\ni'm trying to figure out how to stay in\nthis relationship\nbut i need to know\nwhat to expect\nand i can understand if you don't know\nwhat to expect you have any idea like\nwhat's going to happen going forward\nlike what what does this mean does this\nmean that we're going to stay together\nfor 40 years and this is what our\nrelationship is going to be like or is\nthis going to get better at some point\nwhat can we do to help it get better\nwhat can i do to help it get better or\nwhat can you do to help it get better\nand this is where they he he's going to\nsay okay i'll go see a therapist\nyou don't want to take that bait\nso you'll notice this if you really pay\nattention to people who are frustrated\nthey'll do whatever they'll say whatever\nthey can to stop the conversation\npainful conversation stop it make it\nstop i'll say whatever i need to just\nmake it stop stop asking me about my\nfuture\nstop asking me about what do i what do i\nneed to do i'll just give you whatever\ni'll tell you whatever you want to hear\nand as soon as that happens you've got\nto take a step back a little bit because\nthis is where if you're emotional that's\nexactly what you want to hear oh thank\ngod\noh and you're going to just take that\nbait you're going to gobble it up\nconversation is over let's go play and\nthen he's going to be nice\nlet's go play video games let's do all\nthat stuff just like don't have\nconversation no no no i'm doing so much\nbetter let's go have fun we haven't had\nfun in such a long time by the way i\nlove you so much let's go play a game\nthis is going to be awesome let's go\nstop some noobs\nthat's where you're like hold on a\nsecond\ni'm glad that you said that you want to\ngo to therapy\ncan you help me understand a little bit\nabout how that decision is coming about\nand that's where you want to do\nsomething a little bit weird which is\nlike don't jump into that plan\nsay like okay like what do you think\nthat'll be sufficient\nand then they may say something like\nfrustrated like what do you want me to\nsay\nand that's the problem\nis because they think\nthat this conversation is about them\nsaying the right thing to make you happy\nthat's not what this conversation is\nabout it's not about appeasement it's\nabout actually fixing the [ __ ]\nrelationship\nwhat are we gonna do about this\nand at some point\nyou need to share with your partner\nthere's so much that you can do and you\nneed your\ntheir help\nyeah have fun right\ni don't drop many of those nowadays felt\nlike a right time though\nyou need their help too there's some\nthings that like you can't save this\nrelationship on your own and when you\nsay things like that it's going to be\ndevastating to them\nand that's the kind of thing where it's\nlike you know like how much do you\nmanage that like i'm not sure\nlike how do you manage that you've got\nto sort of go slow so hopefully you have\ntwo or three conversations\nand then the last thing to really\nconsider is that at some point you all\nneed to have a conversation about love\nand accountability\ndoes loving you unconditionally mean\nno responsibility or accountability\nwhen i ask you to do something\ndoes that mean that i don't accept you\nas who you are what does that mean to\nyou what is the relationship between\nlove and responsibility if you are in a\nsituation where someone is\nguilt-tripping you by saying you won't\naccept me as i am\nthe conversation you need to have with\nthat person is what is the relationship\nbetween loving and responsibility\nwhat is the relationship between\naccountability and love\nand you should genuinely ask that\nquestion don't go into that with the\nsort of idea of like\nit's like a debate where you're like\nyeah like\ni love you but you still got to be\naccountable you've genuinely gotta the\ntwo of y'all have to come to an\nunderstanding\nabout what the relationship between\nthese two things are\nis it possible for me to love you and\nnot want to be in this relationship\nis it possible for you to love me and\nnot want to be in this relationship\ndoes love\nexcuse certain behavior like if he snaps\nat you because he's playing video games\nand depressed is that okay because he\nloves you\nis that okay because you love him\nand so this is where if he feels unloved\nthat's where you can say no i love you\nit's just i think that there's a\ndifference between love and\naccountability it's because i love you\nthat i'm having this conversation it's\nbecause i love you that i'm trying to\nsave this relationship\nit's because i love you that i'm telling\nyou i don't know if i can fix this on my\nown\ni'm doing everything that i know how to\ndo and you seem to be moving in the\nwrong direction or we seem to be moving\nin the wrong direction and if there's\nsomething more i can do please let me\nknow but i need your help saving this\nrelationship and that's going to make\nhim feel super guilty and you can say i\ncan understand if that makes you feel\nguilty\ni'm not trying to make you feel worse\nit's like literally like i'm asking for\nyour help\nand that's the kind of thing where he's\nlike okay fine i'll go see a therapist\nit's like okay like what what do you\nthink that's going to do\nright so like that's like you all need\nto have conversations about this kind of\nstuff\nlike be clear\nthe problem is people don't teach us how\nto talk like this especially when it\ncomes to people who struggle with\ndepression\nand so there's like it's hard but\nthere's a way to be compassionate and\nloving\nand also say to your partner\njust because like love and compassion is\nnot gonna fix this problem\nit's gonna take more than love and\ncompassion if love could cure depression\nlike the world would be a completely\ndifferent place\nthe truth of the matter is that\ndepression\nhappens in here and someone else's love\nmay be a huge part of the formula but\nit's not the whole formula\nso what is he going to do\nwhat is he capable of doing\nfor what amount of time is he going to\nbe incapable\nright these are all questions that you\ncan ask\nand then at the end of the day like what\nhe may even try to do so just to walk\nyou all through a couple of things\ntechniques that use he may preemptively\nbreak up with you\nso he may say things like\nokay fine like i can't do it because he\nmay feel like he's not able to do it\nright and he's like okay fine if you\nwant to dump me like i'll i'll do us the\nfavor like whatever\nif you don't love me and then and\nthey'll like frame it in a weird like\ngaslighting sort of way if you don't\nlove me enough to make this relationship\nwork i'm just going to break up with you\nand then that's when like you your\nresponse to him has to be like very\nstable and has to be\ni are you getting the sense that i'm\ntrying to break up with you like where\ndo you get that because the reason i'm\nhaving this conversation is try to save\nthe relationship\nso\nif you're breaking up with me because\nyou think i'm trying to break up with\nyou\nthat's not a good reason\nif you want to break up with other\nreasons that's fine\nbut i want to be crystal clear that i'm\ntrying to make this relationship work i\nneed your help to do it\nand if that doesn't work for you that's\nfine i can't make you stay in the\nrelationship i really want you to but i\ncan't make you stay\ni'd love it if you'd reconsider\nand like think it through or at least\nlike talk to me about why you're doing\nthis\nright so it's kind of weird everyone's\ntelling him\neveryone is listening who's listening to\nthis like dump his ass\nwhereas if he tries to break up with you\ni would actually push back because if\nyou really love him that's what you\nshould do and just make sure that it's\nreally what he wants\nit's not denying the breakup it's just\nnot accepting it at face value unless\nit's an authentic desire to break up and\nthen if he continues to persist\nand like spirals downward and stuff like\nthat and then it's kind of like okay\nfine like if i mean if that's really\nwhat you want\ni can't say no it takes two to make a\nrelationship work and it's clear to me\nthat you're trying very hard to break up\nwith me so\ni guess that's goodbye\ni really hope you see a therapist\ndoes that make sense so hopefully that\nkind of language will equip you all a\nlittle bit\nand there are just a lot of like just to\nkind of summarize like this is the kind\nof thing that's tough because\nif you're supporting someone with\ndepression\na lot of concepts get tangled up\nlike\nwhen does support become enabling\nbehavior especially when it comes to\nthings like video games and alcohol\nwhen does love\nabsolve people of responsibility and\naccountability\nbecause you want to be a good partner\nright you don't want to abandon someone\nwhen they're depressed but in\ntrying to achieve that goal what you can\nactually do\nis like make things worse\nand what you've got to understand is\nthat you can be as loving and as\nsupportive as you want to\nbut in order to fix this relationship it\ntakes two\nand so at some point there needs to be\nsome kind of accountability\nand this is the last kind of tip that\ni'll give you this is a good case of\nsomeone who should probably stay in\ntherapy i don't really know actually but\nthere's some people that i know that so\nthere's some people who have this\npattern where\nthey fall apart get depressed go to\ntherapy get put back together and then\nthey feel better so they stop going to\ntherapy and the cycle repeats itself\nso some people who need to stay at least\nsomewhat connected to treatment\nfor a longer period of time\nand therapy in this kind of situation is\nnot just to get you out of this\ndepression it's to really help work at\nthe underlying issues that make you\nvulnerable to the depression in the\nfirst place\nthere's only so much that you can do and\nit takes two to save a relationship and\nit's really hard when depression makes\nit hard for the other person to\ncontribute\nso that's where like the key thing is to\nhave them take some kind of\nresponsibility it doesn't have to be a\nlot\nbut it needs to be like very clear\nand that could be simple things like\ncutting back on your gaming it could be\ngoing to see a therapist it could be\nlook what i need from you like is\nyou know one hour\nevery three days at a minimum\nor two hours i want to play games with\nyou like twice a week\nand if you're really so sick that you\ncan't do that that's okay but i don't i\nbelieve that you're not that sick\nskal and is this a good situation for\ncouples counseling or would you\nrecommend individual therapy instead i\ncan't really make a recommendation that\nspecific because\nthat requires a clinical evaluation\nespecially on the boyfriend\nright because if this if this really is\na bipolar disorder a major depressive\ndisorder or things like that that's\nwhere like individual treatment is\ndefinitely warranted\ncouples counseling on top i doubt will\nhurt in any way shape or form but the\nreal question is\nmy concern in a situation like this is\nthat until we have a real clinical\nevaluation we don't know that this is\nnecessarily a relationship problem this\ncould be an actual\ndiagnostic illness within one partner\nwhich needs to be treated\nyou"
