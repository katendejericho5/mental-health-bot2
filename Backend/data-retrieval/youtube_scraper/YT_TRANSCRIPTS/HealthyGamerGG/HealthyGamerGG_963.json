    "video_title": "The TRUTH behind Red Flags",
    "transcript": "the truth of the matter is that red\nflags are complicated and they can't be\nboiled down to these like simple things\nso the first thing to understand about\nred flags is that people think that\nthere are red flags right so there's\nthis assumption\nthat in a relationship\nthere is this thing called a red flag\nand what is the purpose of a red flag\nthe purpose of a red flag is to give you\na signal\nof something that's a problem in the\nrelationship so that you don't waste\nyour time so this is the red flag is\nbuilt\non the hypothesis the fundamental\nhypothesis\nthat a future problem in the\nrelationship can be predicted by a\nbehavior\nin the present\nokay that's the idea of a red flag\nthen what happens is when people sort of\ncome up with like\nthen people sort of like\nare like okay so these are red flags\nthese are warning signs\nof problems that presumably by the way\nare also unsolvable right that's the\nother assumption with a red flag is that\nit's unsolvable then what happens is we\nhave like people who come up with\narticles like this one\nyou know so okay\nseven red flags and dating you should\nwatch out for from like\npsyc2go.net\nright\nso it starts with a quote with aristotle\nand then they like start to learning how\nto recognize these signs early in a\nrelationship won't work out\nor that someone is just too incompatible\ncan save us a lot of pain and regret\ndown the road so this is there's a kind\nof presumption that red flags are\ndeterministic\nthat if there's a red flag it won't work\nout okay\nand then they sort of come up with\nthings like this they always agree with\nyou\nthey hide things from you they don't\nprioritize you they're dismissive of you\nthey easily get jealous they make you\nsecond-guess their feelings\nmake you second-guess their feelings or\nyour feelings i don't even know\nthey talk badly about their exes\nthese are red flags\nso like let's just think about what is\nthe logical argument that this this\narticle is making\nif you recognize these early signs won't\nwork out you should break up with them\nso\nlike what if this happens a single time\nlike if they make you second guess their\nfeelings once\ndoes that mean you should break up with\nthem\nif they talk badly about their exes that\nmeans you should break up with them\nif they easily get jealous you should\nbreak up with them\nthey don't prioritize you like what is\nit what exactly does that mean does that\nmean that if you text them and they\ndon't respond right away that they're\nnot prioritizing you how do you define\nprioritize\nhow they hide things from you what so\nwhat does that mean does that mean that\nif i wanna if if we're on our seventh\ndate and i wanna look through your phone\nand you say no\nand i want to see who you've been\nmessaging that means they're hiding\nthings from you and we should\nbreak up with them\nlike do you notice your partner avoids\ntalking about their feelings like oh so\nlike if they're avoiding talking about\ntheir feelings like that's a problem\nit's not like we should give them space\nto like have their feelings and come to\nterms so like if you've had if if my\npartner's been sexually assaulted and\nthey're not willing to talk about it and\nthey're avoiding talking about their\nfeelings i should break up with them\ndoesn't share too much about themselves\nso if i'm just like generally speaking a\nprivate person\nor do they keep you away from their\nfriends or family maybe their friend\ntheir family are toxic [ __ ]\nthey always agree with you how do you\ndefine always\ni want thai for dinner and\nand so you're okay with eating thai for\ndinner great\ni want to do this and you want to do\nthis great we both want to play video\ngames all day we want to veg out great\nbreak up break up break up\nso this is like i don't understand\nwhere these are coming from i don't even\nunderstand how to define this like how\ndo you know how to check this box\nhow do you know how to check this box\nthis is what happens so why do these\nthese articles get published\nbecause our experiences and dating\nresonate with some of these feelings\nright so like when you read this\nif you've been in a relationship with\nsomeone that doesn't prioritize you you\nread this and you're like damn straight\nthey didn't prioritize me i should have\nseen it earlier\nthese are emotionally engaging\nstatements that you can't base any kind\nof predictive model around\nlike do you all get that they're\ndismissive of you so what about okay so\nlike how do you know if they're\ndismissive of you or you just feel\ndismissed\ndoes that make sense if you feel\ndismissed does that mean they're\ndismissive of you is there any\ncontribution from you in any of these\nthings\nthey easily get jealous\nwell yeah like my my partner they get\njealous so easily i went to a party i\ngot hammered i slept in the same bed\nwith my ex i swear to god i only took\nall of my clothing off except for my\nunderpants\nthe penis stayed inside the shorts the\nwhole night\nthey get so jealous like what the f\nso there's like this is the basic\nproblem with red flags\nis that there is no appreciation\nof your behavior as a contribution to\nthese red flags\nthis assumes that a red flag is entirely\nwithin another person\ncan be seen\nflagged and then you kind of break up\nwith them\nso here are the problems with red flags\nokay\nthe first is that there is like no\nrelational component to a red flag so\nthis is something that we know through\nthe science of relationships\nis that a relationship\ni know it's gonna sound weird involves\ntwo people\ntwo people\nand that maybe their jealousy can be\ninfluenced by you\nright maybe the fact that they agree\nwith you very often or they don't talk\nabout their feelings much is because you\ndon't know how to validate feelings or\nyou problem solve all the time and\nyou're actually not a good listener\nall of these red flag kind of\nperceptions\nare based on like this idea that another\nperson and their behavior are like not\nrelated to you in any way shape or form\nthat's problem number one\nproblem number two is that red flags are\ndeterministic\nso this sort of assumes that like if\nsomeone does something like they talk\nbadly about their exes or they don't\ncommunicate with you right they're not\nhonest about their feelings\nthat that is something that cannot\nchange over time\nwhereas like i hate to break it to you\nbut like\nno one's perfect and the whole point of\na successful relationship is about\nfeedback and getting someone else to\nlike change to accommodate you to a\ncertain amount and you change to\naccommodate them to a certain amount you\nall get that like you can't but what\nwhat all these freaking articles about\nred flags are doing is they're creating\nthis idea in our mind that there's a\nperfectly formed human that exists out\nthere i just need to find it and if i\ncan find the perfectly formed human i\nwill be happy and if there's any kind of\nimperfection there's no sense of like\ngrowth or progress or change it's like\nyou gotta you gotta get a hundred\npercent out of the gate or you're gone\nand the more that we see these kinds of\nlike relationship red flag articles the\nmore it like reinforces these ideas of\nlike deterministic relationships\nokay so that that's like problem number\ntwo so problem number one is there's no\nlike contribution from you into anything\nthat goes on in the relationship right\nlike it's not it's not you it's like oh\nman\nthey get jealous so easily i keep on\ntexting my ex and they're sending me\ndick pics but\nthis part oh look like they like\npsych2go.net said that they get jealous\neasily so ephem\nthere's no individual contribution\nsecond thing is that red flags are\ndeterministic\nokay\nand then like the third thing that's a\nproblem with these red flags is that\nthey're not just they're just not based\nin science and they're not like\nmeasurable in any substantial way it's\nlike these summaries of crap that like\nresonates with you a little bit and like\nso you read it and it gets views but\nit's not like based in that you don't i\ndon't know how to measure it they they\nalways agree with you like what does\nthat even mean\nthey're like not measurable they're not\nscientific they're not like even based\nin science\nthese are the three problems\nso let's like take a look\nso then i was like okay so like if this\nis kind of bs\nyou know like is there actually science\nabout it it turns out that they're part\nof the reason that this is hard is\nbecause the science on it isn't actually\ngreat\nso\ni did something silly i typed red flag\nin relationship into pubmed\nand these are the results that i got red\nflag screening for low back pain nothing\nto see here move along a narrative\nreview\ncovet 19 and periodontitis the cytokine\nconnection\ndiagnosis of wild-type transfer\ntrans-theraten\namyloid cardiomyopathy in japan red flag\nsymptom of clusters and diagnostic\nalgorithm red flags to screen for\nmalignancy and fracture in patients with\nlow back pain systematic review oral\ncurcumin with paper with piperine is\nadjuvant therapy for treatment of coven\n19 an rct\nvaricocele red flag or red herring that\nsounds super interesting\nso i was like all right let's try to\ngoogle a google scholar\nso i tried like red flag and\nrelationship and google scholar here's\nthat that red flag or red herring\narticle pretty cool right back pain\nvaricocele is up again if you guys don't\nknow what varicocele is it's when you\nhave a fluid filled something in your\ntesticles\num is laughing at the expense of victims\nand offenders a red flag humor and\nsecondary traumatic stress seems like\nwe're getting a little bit closer to it\nright oh look this is interesting\nraising a red flag on dating violence\nevaluation of a low resource college\nbystander behavior intervention program\nis animal cruelty cruelty a red flag for\nfamily violence investigating\nco-occurring violence toward children\npartners and pets so okay like we're\ngetting a list so it does seem like and\nthen we even get this kind of stuff the\nrelationship between applicant\nexperience and hiring human capital\nversus flag predictions this is about\nmanagement right so like is an employer\nhow can you figure out what red flags\nare\nso like\nand it turns out that there is some\ninteresting information out there so\nthis is part of the i didn't read all\n200 of these pages so it's great so\nthank god that richard white dr white\nnever met the dude but absolute boss\nwrote a freaking dissertation\nabout red flags in relationships this\nwas sort of like the mother lode\nso thank god dr white published this\ncrap and it's like it's a dissertation\nwhich is really where you have to look\nfor this kind of information\nokay so it's really cool like like they\nreally dug into this in the pa the\ndissertation's fantastic\nand then like we can look at a couple of\nother things like from dating to mating\nto and relating predictors of initial\nand long-term outcomes of speed dating\ncool\ndating in the fast lane how\ncommunication predicts speed dating\nsuccess cool predictors of romantic role\nrelationship formation attachment style\nprior relationships and dating goals\ncool\nso there is some evidence out there\nwe know some stuff\nthe problem is that like\nit doesn't say anything like this\nright so like if we look at some of\nthese things the first thing is that\nyou know red flags in a relationship\nhave to do with things like attachment\nstyle so this is this fundamental idea\nthat like depending on what your\nattachment style is how you relate to\nother human beings\ncan\ndetermine what red flags are\nsomething really awesome that dr white\ndiscovered is that\nthere's like all kind let me go to let's\ngo to page i think it's\n52.\nso like\ndr white discovered all kinds of cool\nthings\num like for example that red flags are\ngender dependent and age-dependent so\nlike a red flag for a man is not\nnecessarily a red flag for a woman\nso the truth of the fat matter is that\nthere are some things that are\nconsidered red flags so for example\nanimal cruelty\ndr white determined that deviant\nbehavior is evidenced by things like\nsubstance use violence\nprior criminal history\ndepending on whether which gender you\nare\nhaving kids\ndiscover that there are things that are\nred flags but the problem is that when\nyou look at red flag research\nit's really complicated\nit's not like\nthis thing is a red flag so depending on\nyour gender so for example like\ngen men that are viewed as non-masculine\nwomen rate that as a red flag what does\nthat mean non-masculine\nthat means things like not having you\nknow not being financially independent\nliving at home whereas men will not view\nthat as often as a red flag for women so\nthey're like gender specific subjective\nthings the other problem with dr white's\nresearch by the way is it's all\nsubjective it's not it doesn't actually\nlook at what leads to a successful\nrelationship it's all about perceptions\nof red flags\nokay\nso like\nthe the truth of the matter is that red\nflags are complicated and they can't be\nboiled down to these like simple things\nthe other issue with red flags is that\ni've seen a lot of relationships that\nare very successful that include red\nflags so for example as an addiction\npsychiatrist i work with a lot of people\nwho have been addicted to heroin\nand like\ni think we can sort of say that a lot of\npeople will consider addiction to heroin\nas a red flag\ni've also done things like work with\npeople who are in jail\nand so i've like worked with like\npeople who are criminals\npeople who are felons have been\nconvicted of a felony and they actually\nwind up with like successful\nrelationships\nso even if you have a red flag it's not\ndeterministic\nso if you talk about your exes too much\nmaybe that's because you had like two\nreally bad traumatic exes and over time\na human being i know this is gonna sound\nkind of weird it's gonna sound kind of\nweird\nhuman beings can actually change\nlike\ni get that\npsych2gonot.net or whatever or like a\nlot of people who talk about red flags\nin relationship don't really acknowledge\nthis\nthat people can change\nit's like it's possible\nand so there are a lot of things that so\nfor example like when i started dating\nmy wife like i checked a bunch of red\nflags i was like\n25\nand like had no job\nand was like being financially supported\nby my parents\nand like on at noon on a work day i'd be\nsitting on my computer on the internet\nwhich i'm still doing by the way and now\nthat i think about it\nright and even playing games during the\nworkday\nall right so like this is the thing\nwhere like red flags sort of presume\nthat people don't change whereas they do\nso this is like the big problem with red\nflags so then like you know i'm sort of\nsitting here and i'm sort of tearing\napart this concept of a red flag and so\nwhat people i think are like then i was\nkind of thinking about this and i was\nlike well then what the hell do i say do\ni just say the concept is stupid and\nleave them there\nno actually so we're gonna tell you what\nto do about red flags\nbut there's a big thing that i realized\nworking clinically with people who\nstruggle in dating\nand sort of really struggle with like\nfinding successful relationships\nwho will do things like ignore red flags\nand what i'd love to do with y'all today\nis talk a little bit about\nwhy we fall victim to red flags\ninclude a little bit of that\nrelationship relational component\nand give you all some clues not in the\nother person but in yourself what can\nyou detect that can sabotage\nrelationships what makes you vulnerable\nto a red flag in the other person\nbecause there's a relational component\nokay\nso we're going to talk a little bit\nabout that\nso the first thing the first thing that\nleads to in my opinion so this is not\nlike based on research this is based on\nsort of like clinical work right so i've\nworked with a lot of people who've\nstruggled in relationships and things\nlike that\nso the first thing the first thing that\nleads to like lack of success in\nrelationships\nis when you try to fix\nsomething in your life\nthrough a relationship\nso if there's something that's deficient\nin you\nand you try to fix that through a\nrelationship that relationship is less\nlikely to succeed\nnumber one\nwhen you use a relationship to solve\nyour problems\nand what does that mean your problems\nany kind of problem so let's say that i\nlack confidence in myself and i have\ndifficulty loving myself\nif i'm using a romantic partner to fix\nthat self-love doomed to failure i mean\nit's not really doomed to failure\nbecause nothing is quite that\ndeterministic but in my experience it's\nlike you're starting off with a handicap\nif i'm using a romantic relationship as\na means of financial support\nindependence housing things like that\nmore doomed to failure right not a\nhundred percent doomed to failure and\ni'm not saying that romantic\nrelationships can't be like you know\nfinancial support and stuff can't be a\npart of those what i'm saying is if\nyou're using it as an antidote to that\nproblem\nif i'm homeless\nand the reason i enter into a\nrelationship is to like find a place to\nlive and i've seen all kinds of weird\ncrap happen which is like for example\nin the united states we have to pay for\nhealth insurance and so i've seen\ncouples get married so that one\nperson can provide someone else with\nhealth insurance\nand at the time it seems like a good\nreasonable financial thing but like now\nthe two y'all have been dating for six\nmonths and you've gotten married for the\nsake of getting health insurance and now\nthe two of you all are married\nand like that comes with other strings\nattached\nis there all kinds of things that we do\nin relationships\nto\nfix something within us\ni stay in a relationship here's another\ncardinal one\ni'm lonely\nand so i'm staying in a relationship to\ncombat loneliness because as long as i'm\nwith this person i won't feel that\ncrushing amount of loneliness\nbut then what happens is i become more\ndependent on this relationship from as\nan antidote to loneliness it doesn't\nbecome about the relationship anymore\nit's not about this thing where the two\nof us are building it together it\nbecomes about meeting my emotional need\nand this is how you get these people who\nare stuck in relationships\nbecause they can't they can't leave\nbecause they're afraid of what will\nhappen when they leave\ni have nowhere to live\ni'll be alone all the time\nwho's gonna love\nme\nright like\nwhen your relationship becomes the\nprimary source for meeting your personal\nneeds\nthat's when things become a problem\nand this is different from someone\nbuilding a relationship where like as\npart of the relationship you can\nabsolutely assign financial\nresponsibility to like one person\nright you can do that like that's okay\nlike you you all decide together\nso we're one unit and as one unit we're\nresponsible for all these different\nthings so the very classic example is\nlike child rearing versus like earning\nfinancial you know financial security so\nthese are two needs that we as a\nrelationship unit have\nour kids need to be taken care of and we\nneed money so how are we going to divide\nthis thing some couples choose that i'm\ngoing to focus entirely on child rearing\nyou're going to focus entirely on money\nother couples will choose we're going to\ndo half and half\nunfortunately some couples choose i'm\ngonna do both of them and you're gonna\ndo nothing\nright like that's sometimes what ends up\nhappening\nbut i'm not saying that a couple a\ncouple can't divide things\nin a particular fashion it's just you've\ngot to be super careful\nare you in this relationship to satisfy\na personal need\nor are you in this relationship for the\nsake of the relationship\nand this is because this is what causes\nyou to ignore the red flags right the\nother thing is that it's not like people\ndon't know what the red flags are right\nlike we know what like if you're with a\npartner who talks about their exes all\nthe time and hits animals\nlike you know that that's a bad idea\ncome on\nbut why do you ignore it because of this\nkind of stuff\nbecause you feel stuck in the\nrelationship because you this\nrelationship becomes you start to get a\nsecondary gain out of the relationship\nand then it no longer becomes about the\nrelationship\nso red flag number one within yourself\nis if you're trying to fix something in\nyou\nthrough the relationship\nand once again i'm not saying that the\nrelationship can't help you grow that's\nideally what it should do but that\ngrowth is still your responsibility it's\nnot like the relationship is an antidote\nto your personal growth it's not a\nreplacement for that or personal\ndeficiency\nnumber two\nyou find yourself\nmaking excuses for the other person this\nis the second relationship red flag that\nyou should look out for in yourself\nso i've seen this like time and time and\ntime again\nif you want to know like what really\nchallenges the relationship it's when\none partner makes excuses for the other\npartner\nso i'm a little bit biased here once\nagain because of the background of\nsubstance use right so like\none person has\na drinking problem and what does the\nother partner do makes excuses for them\noh it's not that bad\nso if you've like if you're in an\nabusive relationship oh it's like it's\nnot their fault i upset them\nright or like oh yeah they were like\nthey're really struggling like it was\nour anniversary and they spent all night\nplaying games with their friends the\nnight before\nand so they like missed it and like\nyou know they're depressed right now so\nyou know like i gotta cut him some slack\nand i want to be like a good boyfriend\nor girlfriend or so like you know\nif you find yourself making excuses for\nyour partner that is a red flag within\nyou right there's like the flip side of\nthat which is that your partner doesn't\ntake responsibility so we could make our\nown article that says hear red flags\nyour partner doesn't take responsibility\nthat too is like how do you measure that\nso this is what i'm talking about it's\nlike you can you have to be a little bit\ncareful about cognitive bias because\nwe're always prone to blame other people\nfor a particular problem in a\nrelationship and that's very emotionally\nvalidating which is why these articles\nare successful they're always talking\nabout what your partner is doing wrong\nright so we're going to sort of try to\nbalance that a little bit by sort of\nthinking a little bit about\nwhat you could be doing wrong how you\ncould be contributing to this equation\nbecause here's the other thing is that\nyou can't control your partner but you\ncan absolutely control you\nso if you find yourself making excuses\nfor your partner that's a red flag\nnow this doesn't mean that things are\ndeterministic i'm not saying you should\nbreak up with them that's probably where\nyou need to do some kind of work and\nhave some kind of conversation\noh yeah like you know our friends like\ninvited us over for dinner and i find\nmyself making excuses for you all the\ntime like what's going on here\ni'm covering for your ass\nand like i can't continue doing that or\ni don't want to continue doing that what\nare we gonna do about this\nred flag number two you make excuses for\nyour partner\nred flag number three\nthere are lopsided compromises so\ncompromise is a really really important\npart of every relationship because no\ntwo human beings are perfectly the same\nin terms of their capabilities no two\nhuman beings are perfectly the same in\nterms of their desires\nso when there's a capability gap and\nthere's a desire gap we're not saying\nquantifiably we're saying qualitatively\nright so i want to play video games\nthat's all i want to do you want to go\nhiking all the time that's all you want\nto do there's a gap between what you\nwant to do and what i want to do\nand so naturally the right move is like\nsome kind of compromise that's going to\nleave both of us\nnot perfectly happy\nit's the nature of a relationship\nwhat you're signing up for\nis\na life that you have to give [ __ ] crap\nup for and hopefully the advantage\noutweighs what you sacrifice\nthey're also lopsided capabilities\nthey're also lopsided capabilities\nso like i may be my earning potential\nmay be higher than yours\nyour\nability to\ncook may be better than mine\nand so sometimes there's like some\namount of compromise there too we're not\nsaying that one person has to do all the\ncooking and one person has to do all the\nworking like that just depends on the\nindividual relationship but generally\nspeaking there should be some kind of\ncompromise\na red flag in a relationship is when\nthere is a lopsided compromise\nwhen there is something that you are\naccommodating or they are accommodating\nbecause this could be like you could be\nboth sides of the table right so if i'm\nsitting at home if you're cooking\ncleaning taking care of the kids and\nworking\nand i'm sitting at home being depressed\ndrinking all day and playing video games\nthat's a lopsided compromise\nand we're not saying that one person is\nat fault there both people are at fault\nbecause one person is enabling the\nbehavior one person is doing the\nbehavior\nyou'll get that so the more lopsided\ncompromises you see\nthe more of a red flag it is\nand that's where like you've got to\nfigure out okay why are we making this\nlopsided compromise because the lopsided\ncompromise requires two people to make\nyou can't lopsided compromise yourself\nright like it requires your partner to\nlike hold the other side so if i never\ndo the dishes it sort of requires my\npartner to do more of the dishes or we\njust live in a messy place in which case\nit's no longer a lopsided compromise\nright\nso these are the three things that you\nshould look out for in terms of red\nflags it's not just about the other\nperson and they don't do this and they\ndon't do this and they don't do this\nthey don't do this\nif you are thinking that way that i need\nmy partner to do a b c d e f g h\nand this is deterministic in nature if\nthey have any of these red flags screw\nthem\nthat in and of itself is like a red flag\ninternally that's going to lead to you\nbeing less successful in relationships\npeople who are hypersensitive to red\nflags especially vague ass emotionally\nconceptualized non-scientific red flags\nare the ones who are staying alone\nlearning about red flags and like not\nable to\nform healthy relationships\nwho is reading the article about red\nflags is it the person who's in a\nhealthy relationship absolutely not\nit's the person who keeps on dating the\nwrong person\nand if you keep on dating the wrong\nperson\nmaybe like what's the common variable\nthere right like it's actually you\nso it turns out that a lot of the reason\nthat we keep on having problems with red\nflags is not in the other person\nit's actually because of your\nperceptions\nand the way that you approach the\nrelationship\nbecause if i need to date for the sake\nof like someone doing my laundry\ni'm going to compromise and ignore\ndifferent things that i probably\nshouldn't ignore\nso the the just to kind of try to\nbalance things a little bit\nthe three things that you should look\nout for if you're concerned about red\nflags like by all means like there\nthere's actually some evidence-based\nstuff that we looked at right so we'll\ngo into more detail at some point once\nwe do a more thorough literature search\nbecause interestingly enough reading 200\npages of papers is not sufficient that's\njust the start\nso there are some things like cruelty to\nanimals which are a red flag\nbut here are the things that you should\nwatch out for in yourself first of all\ndon't try to fix\nproblems in here through another person\nright if you have crushing loneliness on\nthe inside and you enter into a\nrelationship and you don't want to leave\nthe relationship because of the crushing\nloneliness in here you're going to\ncreate some weird kind of codependent\nunhealthy relationship\nyou'll also stay in relationships far\nlonger than you should\nbecause as red flags keep popping up the\nthought of being alone is so crushing\nthat you just tolerate that crap\nbecause a lot of us wonder why on earth\nis this person in this relationship\ndespite so many red flags\nit's because the relationship is meeting\nparticular needs that i have\nit's the price i pay to stay in the\nrelationship it's the benefit i get for\nstaying in the relationship\nsecond thing\nis if you find yourself making excuses\nfor the other person\nright representing the other person\nmaking excuses for them in the way they\ntreat you making excuses for them on\ntheir behalf with your family with your\nfriends with their family with their\nfriends\nthe more you find yourself making\nexcuses for someone like the more\nthere's rot on the inside of the\nrelationship\nnot saying it's not fixable\nbut you've got to start holding people\naccountable including yourself\nand like covering for your partner is a\ngreat way to enable bad behavior we're\nnot saying that it shouldn't be done\nsome of the time that's part of what a\nrelationship is\nis you cover for them and they cover for\nyou\nbut if those if you're doing like a lot\nof covering\nand like the covering isn't temporary in\nnature that's another big thing right\nbecause if if you're covering for them\nit's okay to do that for some amount of\ntime but at some point the other party\nneeds to start taking responsibility\nand sometimes when you cover for your\npartner one of two things will happen\neither they'll do it more\nor they'll realize that they shouldn't\nbe doing it and they'll do it less\nso which pattern are you in\nthird thing is lopsided compromises\nwhere generally speaking a relationship\ndoesn't have to be 50 50 in fact most of\nthe studies that i've read show that\nmost relationships have lopsided power\ndynamics which is actually okay\nnot everything in relationship has to be\n50 50. in fact the people who try to\nenforce 50 50 in relationship tend to be\nrelatively unhappy\nit's okay for a relationship to be 60\n40.\nno problem\nbut when you're making more and more\nlopsided compromising compromises that's\na red flag there's something going on\nhere that needs to be\naddressed so this is our initial take on\nred flags and in terms of like if you're\nstruggling to find success in\nrelationships\nwhat we really recommend is that\nby all means beware of what the other\nperson is doing but also look in\nyourself because these are the things\nthat you can change\nyou can stop making lopsided compromises\nyou can start making fair compromises\nyou can support another person but you\ndon't have to consistently make excuses\nfor them\nand we'll see this for years or decades\nright a lack of accountability on one\npartner's part and the other person just\nenables that behavior\nand the third thing is we oftentimes use\nrelationships to fix or\nalmost\nbypass fixing problems within ourself\nas long as i can find someone to\nfinancially provide for me i don't have\nto become independent myself\nas long as i can find someone to do my\nlaundry i don't have to do laundry\nmyself\nso those are the three things that y'all\nshould watch out for and i think if you\nstart to work on those things you will\nhave better success in relationships how\ndo you measure compromising 60 40 70 30\ngreat question pause on trails\nhere's the problem with measuring\ncompromise is that the unit of\nmeasurement is going to be biased\nso there's a very like classic sort of\nscenario about dishes in the sink\nso every dish in the sink that your\npartner cleans for you\nyou don't weigh that benefit as much as\nwhat you weigh when you do a dish for\nthem\nso there's a lopsided measurement\nand so that's where like i don't think\nthat enforce 5050 is good or even 60 40\nor 70 30.\nover time like i don't think the\nquantification of it really matters too\nmuch because there's just the instrument\nthat of your measurement is going to be\nprone to cognitive bias\nso i think i'm so this is where like you\nknow there was a\na priest\nwho once sort of gave some advice to a\ncouple that was getting married\nand they were saying that you know\nmarriage is a 60 40 kind of thing you\ngive 60 and you get 40\nand your partner gives 60 and gets 40.\nand that's what marriage feels like\ncan people with different world views\nlast long adriana's apples is asking\nasking 100 percent\nyou can have a very successful\nrelationship with people who have\ndifferent views the key though is\nreconciling those world views so you\nboth don't have to agree with things you\ncan have a successful relationship\nbetween someone who's religious and\nsomeone who's an atheist\nit just involves communication\nand this is part of the problem is that\nwe assume\nthat people with similar world views\nwill get along better\nand there may be some advantages to that\ndon't get me wrong\nbut we have christians divorcing\nchristians and we have atheists\ndivorcing atheists\nwe have hindus divorcing hindus and\nmuslims divorcing muslims\nwe also have muslims divorcing\nchristians christians divorcing atheists\nand muslims divorcing hindus\nwe're i'm not saying that there isn't\nthere may be like a greater amount of\ndivorce\nbetween particular groups that are\ndifferent\ni'm not saying that there's no impact on\nit i don't know the actual data\nbut\nwe sort of assume\neven the question of like can people\nwith different world views last long\npresumes a deterministic nature it\npresumes that there's no nothing you can\ndo\nso that's where like there are going to\nbe all kinds of different worldviews and\nsome of those may you may not be able to\nget a compromise on but some of them\nlike through communication you can sort\nof decide how you want to raise your\nkids so if i'm an atheist and you're a\nchristian like we can come to some\nconclusion\nabout how we how we're going to resolve\nthat\nso if as a christian you're like they've\ngot to go to church they've got to be\nbaptized everyone who's an atheist is\ngoing to hell\nlike that's going to be hard to resolve\nyou know like so that's where there's\nlike some amount of compromise\num duck duck ooh is there always red\nflags in a relationship and can you\ncompletely avoid them\ni don't think that that's a good\nstrategy so there aren't always red\nflags in relationship because earlier we\nwere talking about like how do you\nmeasure them who knows\nso this is what i'll say\nno one's\nperfect and the solution\nto people not being perfect is to not\ntry to find someone else who's more\nperfect\nthe solution is like\ninstead of like avoiding red flags which\ni'm not saying you shouldn't set limits\non who you're willing to date like\nespecially if we're talking about animal\ncruelty and things like that\nbut this is where just remember that the\nthis is the other assumption is that the\nthe solution to red flags is to avoid\nthem\nwhereas like there's another solution\nwhich is that you can work on them right\nyou can give someone an opportunity to\nlike grow and change you can say hey i\nknow you're addicted to heroin\ni can't be with someone who's long term\nlike that so like\ni really care about you i really love\nyou a lot but i need you to get sober\nfor this relationship to work like i\nneed to be with someone who's sober and\nif you're not ready to make that\ndecision right now that's okay\ni can't stay in a relationship like this\nat the same time like i want to give you\nthe opportunity to let you know how i\nfeel and then you decide\nand then the other person has to make a\nchoice right they can say oh you're\nasking me to change who i am this is my\nwhat i love it's how i relax i don't\nwant to change in which case y'all are\nnot willing to compromise and you part\nways or someone says yeah i know it's a\nproblem i've really been struggling with\nit for a long time\ni haven't been able to do it so far but\ni really want to will you please help me\nand that can result in a super happy\nhealthy long-term relationship\nso that's where like i don't think\nproblems in life necessarily need to be\navoided i'm not saying you should\npick them up at every opportunity\nbut problems can be fixed avoidance is\nnot the only answer would you provide\ncovering for your partner\nyeah so like simple provide an example\nof covering for your partner so simple\nexample is like\ni don't want to go to dinner with our\nneighbors tonight i just want to sit\nhome and sit at home and play dota\nso like that's okay i think if it\nhappens occasionally\nright so there are times that i know at\nleast in my relationship i cover for my\npartner and i appreciate doing it\nbecause i love her and i care about her\nso i really like you know like i'll take\none for the team it's like yeah like you\nrelax you have a good time\ni'm gonna go like i'm gonna take the\ncare of the kids i'm gonna like you\ndon't have to worry about anything for\nthe next 24 hours i'm gonna be like\nsuper dad i'm gonna go to the grocery\nstore i'm gonna do laundry i'm gonna\nwork\nand i'm gonna put our kids to bed and\ni'm gonna wake up with them and you can\njust take a day off\nthat's covering for your partner\nbut if i do that all day every day\nthat's\nunfair\nright so it's okay to cover your partner\ni actually really enjoy it from time to\ntime\nright like it's really cool to think\nthat oh like this crappy task needs to\nbe done i can spare this person that i\nlove from doing this task\nthat's awesome because i love her and i\ncare about her and i want her to be\nhappy in life and i can like make help\nher be happy at the cost of myself i'm\nactually okay with that\npresuming it doesn't happen all the time\nright and presuming that it's\nreciprocated in some way\nso i'll i'll be super dad one day and do\neverything\nand then\na week or two later i'll go and play d d\nand so i'll like leave at noon and i'll\ncome back after the kids are asleep\nso we watch out for each other it's\nabout reciprocation\nhow about other people instantly\nassuming something is a red flag about\nme\nthat's a great point defuser so that's\nwhere so if you are someone who is like\na felon or you use heroin or some other\nthing that other people think is a red\nflag you sort of can't control their\nimpressions right so if someone decides\ni'm not willing to date someone who's a\nfelon or someone who is unemployed at\nthe age of 25 or like whatever their red\nflags are this is my point is that\neveryone thinks about red flags and we\nhave a society that is like more and\nmore sensitive to this concept of red\nflag\nmy assertion is that the concept of a\nred flag and especially the way that we\nengage around it is fundamentally flawed\nright it's like this vague stuff that we\ncan't really measure that may not be\nbased in science i'm not saying that\nthey don't exist entirely\nbut the way in which we internalize\nthese red flags is based on like our own\nemotional experience\noh i had a partner who didn't prioritize\nme and it hurt\nso now i'm going to be hypersensitive to\npeople not prioritizing me\nand sometimes what that can mean is like\nif someone is busy and has other stuff\ngoing on and i'm feeling emotionally\nlike needy in that moment\nit's going to trigger all of this past\ntrauma around like people not\nprioritizing me\nand then what happens is like\ni project onto a situation a lot more\nseverity than is deserved\nand so like it's challenging but that's\nthat's what we're sort of trying to\ncombat so if people instantly assume a\nred flag about you that's where i would\ni would say you may be able to work on\nit some right\nso if for example the red flag is like\nyou're unemployed or if it's like\nyou use heroin or if it's whatever\nyou know if it's that you or a\nparticular race or ethnicity or whatever\nlike who knows\nyou can work on some of that stuff so\nyou can work on becoming more\nfinancially independent you can work on\nbecoming sober so you have to decide for\nyourself whether that red flag is fair\nor not and also like what you can do to\nchange it you are kept g is asking how\ndo you deal with a very dependent person\nwho's getting more and more dependent as\ntime goes by if i try to fix fights by\ntaking a small break and reflecting on\nthings and trying to make myself better\nit makes more issues because the person\ncan't take it being away yeah that's\nwhere like i think conversation is\nreally really important\nand sort of talking to someone who's\ngrowing more dependent so here's like\nthe cycle of dependency\nso you notice that the person you're\ndating is getting more dependent\nthat burdens you more\nand so you try to pull away\nand as you pull away and try to foster\ntheir independence they start to panic\ntheir\nemotional\nenergy increases\nas their emotional energy increases and\nramps up\nyou usually end up caving\nand as you cave it reinforces the\ndependency\nso then what happens is like you're kind\nof reinforcing that like\nif i start to pull away and i'm forcing\nyou to be independent what you're\ntraining your partner to do is to like\nramp things up emotionally\nmake you feel guilty\nand then what happens is the\nrelationship gets worse and worse and\nworse and worse because as they ramp up\nemotionally they they get the right\nbehavior from you they get the support\nthat they want which in turn like\nreinforces the dependence\nbecause if if i try to like push away\nor pull away and like try to make you\nindependent you start to fall out like\nyour partner starts to fall apart more\nmore and more and more and more i can't\ndo anything you see how much i'm\nsuffering and then you come rushing back\nbecause you feel guilty\nand what are you doing in that moment\nyou're actually reinforcing\nthat the more dependent they act they\nhave to like escalate their dependency\nto get you to stay\nand so like makes things worse and worse\nand worse and worse and worse\nso how do you deal with it\na couple of things the first thing is\nyou have a conversation about it\nhopefully non-judgmentally you can say\nhey here's what i'm noticing on our\nrelationship like what's going on what's\nyour experience of it when i start to\npull away and i don't like answer your\ntext for a day how does that make you\nfeel\nright so you have to like understand\ny'all both have to understand what the\ndynamic is then what you've got to do is\nask them like do you want to change this\nlike\nyes or no\nbecause like this is becoming difficult\nfor me\nand then what you sort of do is you\nstart to as you start to like set your\nboundaries you've got to keep them\nso that's where like as the emotional\ndependency kind of like escalates\nyou've got to be able to\nyou know\nhold fast and a big part of that is like\nhaving predictive conversations so\ntelling your partner hey like this feels\nlike i need some space but oftentimes\nwe're not concrete about what that is so\nit's really hard for partners to manage\nso if i say like i need some space\nbecause you're becoming too emotionally\nneedy the other person is like panics\nright because they don't know when\nthat's gonna end so oftentimes setting\nlimits around it is really important hey\ni'm gonna take a weekend to myself it\nhas a duration i need you to be able to\nhold hold it together for a weekend\nright so you like it's time limited\nthat's really really helpful for people\nwho are emotionally dependent\nand then come monday you you sit down\ntogether and you're like how was the\nweekend for you was it really really\nhard do you think you can handle that do\nyou think it should have been shorter do\nyou think it could be longer i'm trying\nto understand it was really helpful for\nme by the way this is what i felt like\nsome degree of relief i was able to\nrecharge my battery some i care about\nyou i love you i want to be able to\nsupport you but like i feel like i'm\nrunning on empty\ni don't think you're a bad person for\nthat i recognize that you have emotional\nneeds and we need to figure out some\nhealthy way of like working on this over\ntime\nbecause i am committed to this\nrelationship i want to stay committed to\nthis relationship but some of that\ninvolves like\nmanaging some of my emotional needs like\nis a tension with your emotional needs\nwhat are the other solutions that we\ncould think about there may be something\nlike therapy or something like that\ninvolved but i think a big part of it is\nthat we sort of reinforce the dependency\nwithout realizing it\nso if a kid wants to watch tv and i say\nno\nand they throw a temper tantrum\nand then i give them the tv to calm them\ndown what is that reinforcing\nthat's actually reinforcing temper\ntantrums get me the tv\nand so over time what i'm going to see\nis more temper tantrums not less even\nthough in the moment i'm trying to stop\nthe temper tension\ndoes that make sense so the same thing\ncan happen with emotional dependency\nso as they escalate and you feel guilty\nand you cave you're actually creating\nmore emotional dependency down the road\nso gunned down and saying what do you do\nif that escalation leads them to panic\nor anxiety attacks great question gunned\ndown so let's look at this question very\ncarefully\nwhat do you do\nif escalation leads them to panic or\nanxiety attacks\nso here's the question whose\nresponsibility\nis their panic attacks and their anxiety\nso in that question you will understand\nwhat the answer is\nbecause oftentimes what we do is we\naccept responsibility for someone else's\nmental health\nand the moment that you do that if\nyou're accepting responsibility for it\nthen it's your problem and you've got to\ncontrol it\nthe problem usually in emotionally\ndependent people is that\nthat dependency requires you to like\nlike agree to it\nright where like their anxiety is\nactually not i mean should you support\nthem 100 percent\nbut ultimately like their mental health\nis their responsibility\nor it should be more their\nresponsibility or it should be 50 50\nresponsibility\nright so i consider at least in terms of\nlike my relationships i consider myself\nsomewhat responsible for the mental\nhealth of the people around me i have a\nduty to try to support their mental\nhealth but i can't\ndo all of it right they have to accept\nresponsibility too and what happens in\ndependent relationships is that\nthe person who they're leaning on\naccepts eighty percent of the\nresponsibility ninety percent of their\nresponsibility\nif it leads them to anxiety attacks it\nleads them to anxiety attacks\nhow are they gonna manage that right\nthat's where the two y'all can come up\nwith a plan okay\nif you can't take a a week a weekend off\nif i can't take a weekend off and it\nleads you to anxiety and panic attacks\nover the next month you need to start\nseeing a therapist\nlet's do that\nand that's when if they don't do that\nover the next month that's when you have\nto have a conversation about like\ni'm willing to do my part but i need you\nto be willing to do yours\nand i don't know how this is gonna work\nif\nyou can't\nlike i can't carry this relationship by\nmyself\nand that sends them into a panic attack\nand that's where like i'm sorry and then\nyou've got to like pull away\nright\nso because in that situation what's\ngonna happen they're gonna have a panic\nattack you're gonna cave oh no no it's\nokay you see that it's tricky it's super\ntricky dr k oh this is great uhudan t is\nasking what can i do if i am the\ndependent part of the spectrum\nyou can start to accept more\nresponsibility\nyou can even sort of like recognize so i\nthink a big part of the big part that\npeople who are dependent miss out on is\nthe time limitation of the boundary\nso this is the kind of thing where it's\nlike you know even if you think about\nyou know a kid who's afraid of the\ndarkness\nas a parent i don't want to say hey you\nneed to learn to be okay with the\ndarkness and i just abandon them i tell\nthem hey\ni know you're scared of the darkness i\nhave to go to the bathroom so i will be\nback in 60 seconds and i know it's gonna\nbe a little bit scary but i'll be right\nback\nthey can handle that it's gonna be a\nlittle bit uncomfortable then it's like\ni have to go change out the laundry i'll\nbe back in two minutes they can handle\nthat\nand so as the dependent person what you\ncan actually do in that situation is\nlike if you feel yourself becoming too\ndependent you can have a conversation by\nthe way do you feel like i'm dependent\nwhat do you think i could do to change\nthat like what are some like what some\namount of independence that i can handle\nokay let's take a weekend where i'm not\ngonna call you i'm not gonna text you\nit's gonna be terrible for me please\ndon't call or text me like let's just\nspend one weekend see if i can handle it\non my own it's gonna be super hard\nand they're gonna say oh you don't have\nto do that no no i wanna do that for my\nindependence but please can we meet up\non sunday evening\nfor dinner\nso you could sort of like\nyou\nleave the mothership for a little while\nright\nand you handle it on your own and then\nyou come back to the mothership that's\nokay\nuh how can you know the right period of\nseparation like is it a weekend a week\nwith practice\nright so how do you know what's the\nright amount that a kid can like handle\ndarkness so you start super small and\nthen you ramp up\nwell these are such good questions so\ngaming comics is asking how do you\nignore thoughts of are they okay during\nthe break you don't ignore the thoughts\nyou acknowledge the thoughts\nright so you can acknowledge to yourself\nhey\nwow am i so worried about them so\nworried i want to check up on them i\nwant to check up on them i want to check\non up on them\ncan i find the trust and faith in them\nto not check up on them can i tolerate\nmy own anxiety\nthat's what that's the antidote\nit's not to ignore the thoughts that's\ngoing to have the opposite result if you\nignore the thoughts they're going to\ngrow and grow and grow and grow and\nthey're going to break through your\nattempts at ignorance\nso what you've got to do is acknowledge\nwow this is really hard can i survive\nanother 24 or 48 hours how am i going to\nsurvive another 24 or 48 hours let me\nwatch a movie let me go for a hike let\nme do this let me cook let me let me do\nlaundry i've got to occupy my mind\nand then like\nyou know you'll manage it\nthe tolerance of anxiety is a very very\nimportant skill to develop and it's\ntaller the same way that you\na child tolerates the anxiety being in\nthe darkness you have to tolerate your\nown anxiety\nyou"
