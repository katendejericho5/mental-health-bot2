    "transcript": "so it's almost like parasocial\nrelationships is like imitation cheese\nit kind of looks like cheese it kind of\nsmells like cheese it kind of tastes\nlike cheese but it isn't cheese\ni have a porn addiction and i've been\ndrowning myself in parasocial\nrelationships i did something very\ncreepy yesterday and i need advice\ni'm a 30 year old i watch porn and\nmasturbate to it almost every day and\nhave done this for most of my life\nespecially late teens onward i often\nthink about sex and fantasize that i'm\ninvolved in the act when i'm watching\nporn or maybe i'm thinking about doing\nit with someone else\ni never had a romantic relationship with\nany women\ni've really only had two dates which\nhappened in high school but nothing came\nof it i've had female friends in high\nschool but afterwards i made a couple of\nonline friends but didn't really keep\ncontact\ni often fantasize a lot about women i am\nvery attracted to and tend to develop a\ncrush on them\nwe start as friends and i find them\nattractive but once we interact more i\ntend to develop crushes on them and\nfantasize a lot about them\nalso i've stocked the social media pages\nof one of them i have confessed to two\nof these crush crushes and was ghosted\nor had contact broken from\nfast forward to now i gave up on\nrelationships and interacting with\npeople socially i've always had a\nparasocial i've always been a parasocial\nandy but in more recent years i've been\nwatching streams more now in a very\nparasocial manner especially\nwith a few specific female streamers\nyesterday one of the female streamers\nwas doing something irl on stream\nthat was unintentionally raunchy i\nrecorded that because i was too afraid i\nwas afraid they would delete the vaude\ni was aware of what i was doing and\ncould feel shame about it but ultimately\nwent through with it then i jerked off\nto it later while fantasizing having sex\nwith the streamer now because i had the\nfantasy in my mind there's this new love\nslash adoration for the streamer\num\nedit number one i guess people just want\nto downvote but not offer any helpful\nadvice sorry i thought this was a safe\nspace for aoe healing and working on\nself to be better people not a\ngatekeeping community that ignores\ncertain people with certain issues it's\nnice to see that this was crawd out uh\ncrossed out\nedit too i wasn't expecting this\nresponse this post initially was\ndownvoted to hell and had no responses\nso i thought i would get lost in the sea\nof posts thank you for all the helpful\nfeedback\n207\nnice job my dude nice job community\nso\nlet's talk about this\nso sometimes\nwe find ourselves in kind of a weird\nsituation\nwe know\nthat it's not good\nto\ndevelop parasocial relationships we have\nthis vague idea especially about\npornography like is it helpful or is it\nlike is it healthy or is it not healthy\nlike what's addiction what's not\naddiction like people masturbation is\nyou know a healthy part of human\nsexuality like we sort of like know\nthat some of this stuff is okay and some\nof this stuff isn't okay\nand we find ourselves sometimes being in\nthis situation where like\nokay like social relationships have been\nchallenging for me i went on a couple of\ndates back when i was 18 in high school\nand then like things didn't really go\nwell\nand then like i kind of got behind\nso like i got behind\nsome weird stuff started happening in my\nmind i recognize that i'm developing\nlike crushes on people way too quickly i\nrecognize that i'm fantasizing about\nthese people and sometimes i'll even\nlike try to talk to these people about\nit but i usually get ghosted and so then\nlike since i'm getting ghosted and\nclearly i'm not good at this whole\nrelationship and socializing thing\ni'm gonna just kind of give up on it\nright so i'm gonna give up on\nrelationships because clearly i'm not\ngood at it clearly it's not working out\nfor me people don't appreciate\nyou know what i say to them i'm getting\nburned by trying to connect with people\nso gg out\nthen what happens\nis\nwe kind of like fall into this like\nparasocial weird pornography kind of\nstuff\nand this is really tricky because\nwe tried right like this is it's really\nhard to be in this situation because you\nsort of know that like this is not\nhealthy\nbut you tried it the normal way and it\ndidn't work out and you tried it again\nand it didn't work out you tried it\nagain it didn't work out and you gave up\nfor a reason\nso you're kind of stuck in this\nparticular situation where like this\nkind of goes on for a while and you're\nsort of like okay with it but you're not\nreally okay with it and you start to\ndevelop and then like technology changes\nand like over the last 10 years\nbecause of twitch and parasocial\nrelationships and stuff like that you\ncan connect with people online in a way\nthat you haven't been able to before\nand then as you connect with these\npeople the fantasies start to grow the\ninteractions start to grow you start to\nget to know this person\nright\nand then like something weird happens\nwhere someone does something and you\nrecognize like you save a vaude and you\nyou know tug one out\nand then like you're like this has gone\ntoo far\nbut what do you do about it\nbecause at this point you missed the\nmilestones right like you dated people\nin high school and you're 30 now\nand you're like this is not okay but\nlike what do i do about it\nright because like\ni don't know how to start i don't know\nhow to stop it's like so confusing and\nthere's a ton of shame\nright like you can't talk to people\nabout this\nright like you feel ashamed of yourself\nyou feel pathetic like what like you\nknow sometimes you even try to reach out\nto people you'll confess your feelings\nfor them and it's like you're going to\nget ghosted and you're kind of like\nstuck between a rock and a hard place\nbecause you don't know you sort of\nrecognize that something about this is\nnot first of all fulfilling\nsomething about this is starting to feel\nunhealthy\nbut you don't know how to reach for\nhealth\nso what's going on here and what can we\ndo about it\nso let's start with almost like an\nevolutionary perspective okay so this is\nsort of like a synthesis of my learnings\ni don't know that this is like there's\nactually an explicit scientific paper\nabout evolutionary impacts and\nparasocial relationships with streamers\non twitch and pornography addiction i\ndon't think the research has gotten that\nfar so when we're entering into this\nrealm the first thing that you all have\nto understand is we don't have\nscientific studies about this the best\nthat we can do is read a bunch of\nscientific studies and then extrapolate\nbased on those to what's going on\nbecause the rate at which technology is\naffecting our mind and brain is way\nfaster than the rate at which science\ncan understand what it's doing to us\ncaveat\nat the same time i feel pretty good\nabout explaining what's going on here\nso here's the tricky thing about a lot\nof technology especially with some of\nthese things with parasocial\nrelationships and social media\nso why do we feel lonely\nloneliness why does the brain feel\nloneliness like why have we evolved to\nfeel loneliness why aren't we happy all\nthe time\nso for the survival\nof the species\nwe develop this feeling of loneliness so\nand that's what causes us to reach out\nto other people\nright that's what like when you feel\nlonely like generally speaking\nif you have healthy friendships and\nstuff like that if you feel lonely you\nreach out to a friend they they'll they\nreach out to you and loneliness is a\nsignal to connect to another human being\nthe same way that thirst is a signal to\nconnect to water hunger is a signal to\nconnect to food\nloneliness is a signal to connect with\nanother human being\nnow the problem\nis that we now have certain things that\nwill satisfy our hunger satisfy our\nthirst satisfy our loneliness without\nactually connecting to another human\nbeing this is exactly why these\nplatforms are successful\nso when you form a parasocial\nrelationship\nwhat happens is your ability to see this\nperson in their natural habitat\nsee their emotional expressions even\ninteract with them a little bit in chat\nallows certain parts of your brain to be\nsatisfied in terms of loneliness it\nchecks a couple of like evolutionary\nboxes\nso you feel connected to them right\nyou see them you can even have like\nsome kind of like even dopaminergic or\noxytocinal\nresponse where generally speaking when\nyou have an orgasm and you associate\nthat orgasm with another person\nwhat we tend to think of is we get a\nrelease of oxytocin and oxytocin\nforms neurochemically an emotional bond\nbetween two people\nwhat happens to oxytocin when you watch\na streamer and they do something that's\nkind of raunchy and you\nmasturbate\nwe don't know\nbut some kind of like that that\nneurochemistry is there those\nthat architecture of bond formation is\nthere and this is what happens in\nparasocial relationships is that if we\nif we look at like\nthe our brain and the way that our brain\nforms connections with other human\nbeings it checks like half the boxes\nso it's almost like parasocial\nrelationships is like imitation cheese\nit it kind of looks like cheese it kind\nof smells like cheese it kind of tastes\nlike cheese but it isn't cheese\nand so like but the thing about\nimitation cheese is that like you know\nit stays good for years it's cheap it's\neasy it's accessible\nand so a lot of times we'll start using\nimitation cheese instead of cheese\nbecause it's close enough and it's\neasier\nand it checks enough of the boxes\nand sometimes people even like imitation\ncheese more than the real thing they can\nactually conclude like they're like you\nknow what it's just not as melty as real\ncheese it doesn't go bad it's actually\neasier for me to just eat imitation\ncheese which is why we have imitation\ncheese\nbecause at the end of the day cheese in\na can that i can easily spread over\nnachos\ncheese whiz\nis like good enough\nright it's kind of like all this\nhydrogenated oil crap and like it tastes\nkind of fake and like all this kind of\nstuff but it's good enough it scratches\nthe itch\nand this is what parasocial\nrelationships do in our brain\nis they check enough of the boxes\nand this is why this is absolutely\ndevastating\nbecause the part of your brain\nthat wants you to foster a connection\nwith someone else\nnow has a way to feel satisfied without\na real connection\nand this is where people really get in\ntrouble\nbecause you're you can trick your brain\ninto thinking that something is water\neven though it's not real water and so\nas you drink this crap over and over and\nover again\nwhich\nsatisfies some of your brain circuitry\nwhich notices like\nyou know\nsolute concentration and all this kind\nof stuff so our brain for example\nreleases this hormone called vasopressin\nand what vasopressin does\nis puts water channels\ninto different parts of puts water\nchannels in the colon and things like\nthat\nactivates parts of our body that cause\nus to pull water back in\nand so that's like how this works\nand so we could sort of like trick our\nbrain and our body into feeling\nconnected without actually being\nconnected\nit's almost like imagine if you had\nfalse water\nthat made you sort of stop feeling\nthirsty but didn't actually hydrate you\nthis is what parasocial relationships\nare\nthey take the feeling of loneliness away\nwithout actually hydrating you\nthey make the thirst go away because\nwe're thirsty and it's interesting right\neven as a society we use the phrase\nthirsty what do you call someone who\ntakes a clip of a vod of something that\nfeels kind of raunchy and like\nyou know\ndoes his thing we call him thirsty\nso it sort of satisfies our thirst\nwithout actually hydrating us and then\nwe feel all of the effects of\ndehydration but now we don't even feel\nthirsty because we're drinking this\nimitation water\nand now you're in a lot of trouble\nbecause the very\nsignals that cause you to reach out to\nanother human being are being satisfied\nenough to not motivate you to connect to\npeople and this is the real problem with\nparasocial relationships and technology\nin general is that they give us easier\nalternatives to the real thing that's\nwhy they're successful\ni can feel triumph in a video game or i\ncan feel triumph in real life there's a\npart of my brain that doesn't know the\ndifference there's a part of my brain\nthat does\nour cerebral cortex the part that makes\nus human the part that allows us to\nanalyze things and really look at things\nobjectively recognizes that there's a\ndifference\nbetween\nwinning in a video game like saving a\nlife so i've done this i've saved a life\nand i've made a comeback in a game of\ndota\ni've literally done both of these things\nand i on the cortical level i understand\nthe difference one is like an actual\nhuman being\nand one is like it's just like\nnoobs on the internet it's all fake\nbut i can tell you the emotional\npart of my brain can't tell the\ndifference\nthe sense of triumph and satisfaction\nand relief that you get is it honestly\nit's like better in the game because\neven when i\nwhen i'm thinking about a particular\nperson\ni was doing chest compressions on\nwhen you save a life in real life you\ndon't even feel triumph all you feel is\nrelief\nlike thank god this person is alive\nmy god that was terrible\nit doesn't even like feel like all you\nfeel is thank god it's over and we did\nit\nyou're not queuing up immediately after\nit's not like you do chest compressions\non one person and then like 15 minutes\nlater like yeah let's go let's do it\nagain i remember in this case i was\nwearing gloves\ni started doing chest compressions on\nthe person\nso this is tricky they don't show this\non the tv shows so when you start\nsqueezing really hard on someone's chest\nsometimes what they start to do is vomit\nand this person started vomiting\nand i remember the vomit was somewhat\nprojectile\nand got into the gloves and i distinctly\nremembered it was almost a traumatic\nexperience i went into the bathroom\nafterward right got a change of scrubs\nand stuff like that and pulled off the\ngloves and there was like vomit on the\nbacks of my hands\nthis is what it feels like to save a\nlife\nyou're not queuing up for that crap\nimmediately afterward i guarantee you\nso the problem with technology and\nparasocial relationships\nis that they scratch that itch on the\nprimitive brain level\nthey make you feel connected you get the\nspurt of oxytocin you get the relief of\norgasm you get those neurochemical\neffects you watch this person day after\nday after day\nyou see them you get to know them\nbecause they're authentic empathically\nyou see this person's ups and downs and\nyou're there all the time watching\nwatching watching and because we have\nempathic brains when someone else smiles\nyou smile when someone else cries you\ncry and so you feel a connection to them\nbut the connection is never reciprocated\nit can never be reciprocated\nso while you feel connected to them\nthey're not connected to you\nand in the absence of actual sensory\nfeedback\nwhat does your mind do your imagination\ntakes over\nand as your imagination takes over the\nfantasies come in and this is also\nevolutionary think about this for a\nsecond when i first meet someone and i\nfall in love and i start to fantasize\nabout this person what does it cause me\nto do what behavior does it cause me to\ndo and two people are young and in love\nthey're fantasizing each other about\neach other all the time and those\nfantasies literally bring you closer\ntogether because i can't stop thinking\nabout this person if i can't stop\nthinking about the person i call them\nand then we hang out again and then the\nfantasies increase and increase and\nincrease and it's kind of interesting\nright\nso the fantasies in a relationship\nhappen at the beginning of the\nrelationship\nthey don't happen 15 years in you don't\nfantasize about your partner 15 years in\ni mean you do you fantasize whatever but\nmost of the fantasies happen early and\nthen as you get data as you get\ninteractions as you get experiences the\nimaginations and the fantasies start to\ndecline\nyou can think about this even in terms\nof a video game or a movie like before\nyou actually see it you can fantasize\nabout it you can imagine all the\npossibilities oh my god it's gonna be so\ngreat\nthis new movie is gonna be so awesome\ndune part two\nff7 remake oh yeah it's gonna be awesome\nit's gonna be awesome it's gonna be\nawesome you can imagine you can\nfantasize all kinds of things and the\nsecond that you actually have experience\nthe fantasies start to decrease and what\nis the purpose of the fantasy the\nfantasy is to drive you towards that\nperson\nso this is how we get into this place\nwhich is first of all\nthat millions or billions or trill i\ndon't even know when life began but\ntrillions of years of evolution caused\nthings to mate\nthis starts with things like f plasmids\nand bacteria\nright so this is when there's a f minus\nbacteria and there's an f plus bacteria\nthe f plus bacteria transmits its dna\nthe f plasmid to the new bacteria now\nwe're both f\nbacteria\nvery very old stuff from the beginning\nof life\nthe desire to connect\neven bacteria will move towards each\nother\nthey'll send chemical signals and\nthey'll connect and they'll transfer dna\nso this is like i don't even know how\nold that is this is like where\nloneliness comes from if a bacteria has\nany perception of consciousness\nthere's some primitive level of\nloneliness which we can observe this\nbacteria will move to each other and\nthey'll exchange dna\nso this primitive thing is designed to\nconnect you to another human being\nthat's why it exists\nnow the problem is that we've got\nimitation cheese\ninstead of actually connecting with a\nhuman being it's so much easier\nright because if you interact with\nsomeone what happens you get rejected or\nyou there's a possibility of rejection\nthere's depression there's anxiety but\nyou can connect to someone on the\ninternet\ndanger free\nour brain is made to be risk averse\nthat's why we're alive today\nbecause i'm sure at some point there was\nsome gene that caused\nhuman beings or monkeys or bacteria or\nfish\nto take really really high risks there's\nlike a fish that's like yeah let's go\njump out of the water let's see what\nhappens let's go\nthat fish didn't stay alive to procreate\nwe became risk-averse so when you put\nall these together there's the\nloneliness which is drawing you towards\nsomeone there's the risk aversiveness\npart of your brain that's sort of like\nokay if we can scratch that edge if we\ncan get a bottle of water from the sink\nwe don't want to walk through crocodile\ninfested waters or we don't want to\ndrink water from a lake that's filled\nwith crocodiles if i can get it safely\nat the sink\nand it scratches enough itches in our\nbrain to where like we sort of don't\nknow the difference\nor there's a part of us the primitive\npart of our brain the emotional part of\nour brain the empathic part of our brain\ndoesn't know the difference we feel\nconnected to them\nand then we start to fantasize and this\nrelationship grows in our mind and we\nget more and more sensory input we see\nmore and more of their vulnerability and\nwe end up getting stuck\nand then we end up doing something that\nwe're kind of ashamed of and we're like\nwait this is weird this is not working\nthat's how we get here\nso\nwhat do you do about it\nthe first thing to understand is that\nas long as your thirst is being\nsatisfied by an imitation the thirst is\nnot going to motivate you to actually\nform real connection\nso the first thing you've got to do is\nlimit your exposure to the streamers or\nthe people who have the parasocial\nrelationships you got to use your hunger\nfor you\nand this is where the more time you\nspend with them the more the fantasies\nare going to build in your head and the\nstronger your connection is going to be\nso i'm not saying you have to break up\nwith them right away you don't have to\nlike pull it off like a band-aid\nalthough you can absolutely do that\nbut this is where i just want you to\nunderstand that the more your sensory\norgans are populated\nby this person the more your thoughts\nwill be populated by it\nso if we go to the field of advertising\nthe more they spam ads if you see\nbillboards if you see twitch ads if you\nwalk down the street and you see a car\nif you see other people who have branded\nwhatever\nthe more you see it the more you're\ngoing to think about it the more it's\ngoing to shape your behavior\nthere's something advertising\nunderstands really well they understand\nhow to use our organs of perception to\nshape our thoughts and shape our\nbehavior\nso the more that you bombard your\nthoughts your sensory organs with this\nperson the stronger your thoughts are\ngoing to be the stronger your fantasies\nare going to be and the harder it's\ngoing to be for you to change your\nbehavior\nso you just honestly it starts with\nperception i'd say like the first thing\nyou should do is just cut back on the\nvolume of time you watch this person\nas you start to get other kinds of\nsensory input your mind will think about\nother things\nand we sort of know this right we know\nthat sometimes people need a change of\npace people need a change of scenery\nwhat does a change of scenery do it\nchanges your mind i need to get the hell\nout of these four walls\ngo for a walk and your mind changes\nthere are all kinds of pathophysiologic\nmechanisms for specifically walls and\nyou know horizons and plants and all\nthis kind of stuff but the key thing is\nthat your environment shapes your\nperceptions if you get out of a toxic\nhousehold into a healthy sort of\nsituation then your perceptions will\nchange your mood will change your\nactions will change\nif you start hanging out with a bunch of\npeople who get high and play dota like\nthat's what you're going to do too\nso controlling your perceptions is\nreally important\npeople don't think about perception as\nlinked to motivation they don't think\nabout perception as linked to behavior\nso in\ndr k's guide to adhd and doing stuff the\nmain meditative principle which we teach\npeople is indriyas and sensory\nperception\nwe think about organization we think\nabout prioritization we think about\ninspiration\nwhen it comes to motivation and doing\nthings we don't think about perception\nwe don't think about perception as\nsomething that shapes my behavior\nwe think about it as just informational\nand something that comes in\nso if you want a bunch of detail about\nliterally exercises to control your\nsensory organs and get off of this kind\nof crap that's what is in dr k's guide\nto doing stuff\nso first thing is reduce your sensory\ninput\nnext thing to understand is that as your\nsensory input reduces\nyour hunger will grow\nyour thirst will grow and this is gonna\nbe the really really hard part because\nas you get thirsty\nyour brain is gonna be like let me watch\nthe twitch stream because then you're\ngonna get satisfied\nyou're gonna get a drink by watching the\ntwitch streamer that is the struggle\nthat you have to fight in that moment\nwhen you are thirsty\nunderstand that your brain is going to\ngive you two options one is that i can\ntry to go and interact with another\nhuman being\nwhich is going to be filled with fear\nand anxiety and possibly bad\nconsequences because you've tried it\nbefore and hasn't worked out for you or\ni can log on to and watch my favorite\ntwitch streamer\nand that's going to be risk-free\nmaybe i'll even get\ni'll get to know them better like it's\ngonna it's gonna satisfy your thirst\none's easy\nand successful and one is painful and\ndifficult\nyou gotta choose the hard road\nyou gotta recognize recognize in your\nmoment in that moment what the feeling\nof that thirst is how much easier it\nwould be\nto do this kind of thing\nand so start to socialize you know start\nto get out there a little bit like i\ndon't know exactly what that you know\ndoes for you i don't know if you have\nwork kind of situations or what like\ni don't know exactly how you do that\njoin discord and\nyou know try stuff people talk about\nhobbies and all that kind of stuff\nso like that solution is sort of we're\nnot going to cover that right now\nbecause it's kind of varied and there's\na lot there the main thing that i want\nyou to understand is if you want to\novercome this problem it's that moment\nin time that you have to resist\nand look out for it and if you're if\nyou're ready for it and if you know it's\ncoming every hour that goes by\nthe thirst will grow\nand your mind will start thinking about\nit because that's what it does right\nlike so if i need to like you know once\nmy if you for example if there's a stray\ncat in the neighborhood and you start\nfeeding the cat the cat figures out okay\nwhere do i get my fix\nif you're addicted to something and\nthere's a dealer you know where to get\nyour fix and the more the cravings\nincrease the more you go to the dealer\nso the cravings for loneliness the\ncravings to get rid of the loneliness\nincrease the cravings for connection\nincrease you know where to get your fix\nand if you give in\nthen it's game over for that day\nso reduce your input and start to\nrecognize ride out that urge\nand the more that you're able to reduce\nyour sensory input and start to build\nother kinds of sensory\ninputs the more that you're able to at\nleast like leave the house and start\ninteracting with people it doesn't have\nto be his friends it can be something as\nsimple as like going to the grocery\nstore and asking the cashier how are you\ntoday\nand that's it\ni'm well how are you i'm doing pretty\ngood\nhave a nice day it can start something\nas simple as that\nother really simple things that you can\nstart with i know it's very paralyzing\nbut i love it\nis the nod\nso this is i i'm not quite sure so you\nknow growing up as a cisgendered man i\nhave a different experience from many\npeople but as a dude to a dude the nod\nworks really well i don't do it to women\nusually because i think that could be\nperceived as creepy but if there's a\ndude i'll like make eye contact i'll\njust nod to him and like keep walking\nbro nod\nso the thing about the bronaud is it's\nvery low commitment you'll feel a lot of\nanxiety\nand then like\nyou know like you just do it and you\nkind of move on\ni don't know so i guess i just have to\nask you know women in chat\nif a dude bro nods at you are you okay\nwith that or is that creepy\nright so like i think the bro nod is\nlike the most primal form of like\nplatonic connection\nso the uh some things what i will do\nwith all people is smile like if i make\neye contact with people i'll smile at\nthem\nright and then that's where also if i\nlike if i'm bro nodding i'll be a little\nbit careful about making it clear to\nthem that no further interaction is\nneeded\nso i'll practice i'll try i'll\nexperiment y'all can experiment too\nlet's see what happens\nah so so for for lord amir who's saying\nno female in chat that used to be true\nwhen we started streaming did you guys\nso this is interesting our gender\nbreakdown is changing we used to be like\n90 to 95 male 5 to 10 female we're\nactually like 30 to 40 women in our\naudience now\nthis is great\nokay bro nod\nto women creepy no so most people are\nsaying no\nokay so we'll let i'm going to try and\ni'll get back to y'all\nso i find that smiling is is totally\nfine like especially if you don't make\nany other gesture\nright\nlike if you don't walk over there if you\ndon't like\nyou know like none of that business then\nyou're fine\nyou know you don't you don't do that\nkind of crap you know\nyou know the head bobble\nthe legacy of my people\nfinger guns\nyou guys think that that's creepy for\nwomen like do it too dude that'll be\ngreat\n[Music]\nokay so there's a good question by saya\nchen\num what if you feel so behind that you\ndon't even feel any hunger for a certain\nlevel of human relationships anymore\ngreat question\nso\ni don't know if y'all have done this but\nif you've ever been hungry or thirsty or\nreally need to pee what happens to that\nsensation over time if it doesn't get\nsatisfied\nso if you look at the experience of\nhunger hunger signals increase increase\nincrease right so your ghrelin leptin\nimbalance so these are also hormonally\nmediated\nis in favor of hunger hunger hunger\nhunger you feel hungry hungry hungry\nhungry hungry you're really starving and\nthen if you don't get any food\nfeeling goes away\nright you acclimatize to it\nyou i need to pee i need to pee i need\nto pee there's no bathroom feeling goes\naway for a while if you're lucky then it\ncomes back goes away comes back\nso when we don't satisfy some of our\nurges our brain has a very simple body\nactually has a very simple normalization\nof the signal where it stops\nsending that signal to us\nso essentially what happens is we're so\nwe've been lonely for so long that we\nbecome numb to connections and we learn\nto survive without them\nit's sad\nnow there are some cases where we\nactually have like you know documented\ncases of something called schizoid\npersonality disorder which are people\nthat are wired in a particular way where\nthey don't actually seek connections\nso this is sort of like the platonic\nversion of someone who's asexual\nwhere they just don't\nthat is not just something that they're\ninterested in so that's possible\nso it's possible that that's not\nan adaptation or pathologic or anything\nlike that we sort of call it a pathology\nbut some people are just wired to be\nlike loners and they're actually okay\nwith that so that's a possibility\nbut generally speaking in my experience\nwhat happens is that you've been alone\nfor so long that you just numb yourself\nto it essentially and that's when like\nall kinds of interesting things happen\nright because if you're truly numb\nthen\ninteracting with people should be easy\nbecause you don't actually care\nso how do you know if you're different i\nmean how do you know which one which\ncamp you fall into generally speaking in\nmy experience people who are numb\nif interaction with human beings\nactually comes up and is a possibility\nit's not a neutral interaction it\nusually is like\ncomes with something like anxiety or\nsome kind of negative emotion or\navoidance\nso if you have numbness plus avoidance\nthen chances are you have loneliness\nthat's being numbed that you can't feel\nwhereas if you're truly more on the\nschizoid spectrum then like interacting\nwith other people is like completely\nneutral like you don't really mind you\ncan go to a party every single day and\nit's like whatever\nyou're not like\nyou don't respond to interactions with\nsomething like anxiety\ngreat question though\nyou"
