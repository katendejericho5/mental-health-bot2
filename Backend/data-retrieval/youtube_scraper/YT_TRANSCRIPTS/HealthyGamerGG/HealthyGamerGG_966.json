    "transcript": "so why is it hard to do it's because i\ndon't think for many people it clicks\nwhat the cost\nof sleeping poorly using drugs and\neating unhealthily is\nso do you have moments of your true\npotential i can only explain it as a\ntemporary and extremely inconsistent\nmoment where i'm operating completely\nnormal i can converse i have a high\nconfidence i'm witty i can think sharply\ni'm complete at complete ease and\neverything seems effortless and easy it\nmight happen one day every few weeks or\neven longer\nit's like the stars have aligned and\neverything is functioning as it should\ni see this state and it's both\nencouraging and extremely discouraging\nit's a tease it's like dangling a carrot\nin front of me this is what you could be\nlike but unfortunately you'll be\ndysfunctional again tomorrow\nthis is what makes the condition so\ntantalizing because i know what i'm\ncapable of but i cannot sustain the\nstate of mind for any amount of time and\nit's seemingly so completely random when\nit occurs\nthen i'll be back in my brain fog\nstuttering unable to articulate my\nthoughts unable to be present lost in my\nhead incapable of making decisions etc\nso\nthis is the kind of thing where\nit's really unfortunate\nbut sometimes we have moments\nof true potential\nright\nand it feels like we're we're trying to\nbottle lightning\nso it's like there's this flash and then\nsuddenly everything works the way it's\nsupposed to\nyou're talking to people the ideas are\ngoing you're productive you're focused\nyou're witty you're having a good time\nyou're feeling good right it's not just\nabout productivity it's also about mood\nthe problem is that it's like completely\nrng\nand we have no idea like what causes\nthis\nand this is actually what's so\ndevastating about it is that we know i\nlove the way that this person kind of\ndescribed it\nwe know it's possible\nall we have to do is like figure out how\nso this is the kind of thing where we\ncan't even give up on it right we can't\ngrieve it because it's not gone\nit's not like it's never happening again\nit's not like it happened just once it\nhappens consistently\nrandomly but consistently\nevery few weeks you get one day where\neverything is amazing\nand so then your mind is like\nif only i could do this\nthen my life could be like that like you\nknow it could be so amazing\nand then what happens is you know it's\nlike possible but you can't figure it\nout\nright and so then you get really really\nfrustrated with yourself because you're\nlike how do i do this how do i do this\nhow do i do this if only i could do it\nwhy can't i be like this all the time\nthese are the kinds of thoughts that\nyour mind has\nand then you're stuck because like you\nhave one of two options right either you\nstruggle to try to figure this out\nand if you can imagine what your life\nwould be like or\nyou accept that this is not something\nthat you can control and then all of\nthese things that you know you're\ncapable of you have to like let go\nsorry\nnot going to be productive not going to\nbe confident not going to be witty not\ngoing to be on point\nbut you don't want to give that up\nbecause you know it's possible\nso it's super challenging\nso what's going on here\nand what can we do about it\nso the first thing that i want to ask\ny'all is like what do you think\ncontributes to success\nactually let me rephrase what do you\nthink contributes to successful\nperformance\nso when people are are struggling in\nlife\nwhat are the features that they sort of\nthink about in terms of like whether\nthey're successful or not\nokay so like i'm seeing a lot of stuff\nabout you know diet and karma and focus\nand all this good stuff\nso generally speaking if we look at how\nhuman beings conceptualize success they\nthink of two things they think of traits\nand they think of experience\nso we'll hear this a lot in our in our\nlanguage right so people will say\nmotivation\ndiscipline\na person is motivated another person is\nlazy\none person is disciplined another person\nis undisciplined\nthese are all traits\nright so these are like even in the five\nfactor personality model we'll have\nthings like conscientiousness\nand so what this essentially means is\nthat the future is kind of deterministic\nif you were born with the laziness gene\nyou're screwed if you're born with the\nhard-working gene and the motivation\ngene you're in good shape\ni am confident or i am shy\nright these are traits\nso a trait is an inborn like kind of\ncapacity that's like sort of like fixed\nthe other thing that we assume is\nexperience\nso we assume that people who do things\nmore are going to be able to do them\nmore\nand be able to be more successful\nso\nwhen i would do any kind of performance\ncoaching work\nright so like i'll just use esports as\nan example but i do this for physicians\nas well\nattorneys investment bankers\nwhatever\nso\ni'll ask people and you we can have this\nconversation with you too so when you\nplay a video game\nthe more you play a video game do you\nget better at it\ninteresting question the automatic\nanswer may be yes obviously but\nthat may not be entirely true\nright so people are saying not always\nbecause like you can play a game for a\nthousand hours especially like pvp games\nand it's not like you're getting better\nevery single minute right you can stick\naround you can plateau at a particular\nrank or mmr\nso the other thing that's kind of weird\nis in theory every game you play you\nhave more experience you learn something\nfrom each game you play if you learn\nsomething from each game you play you\nshould your chances of winning the next\ngame should increase\nand when i talk to like pro esports\nplayers for example what i'll ask them\nis like what determines like whether\nyou're gonna win a game or lose a game\nand so they'll say things like oh it's\nlike my game knowledge how much i\npractice and stuff like that okay like\nokay fine so like\nbut then if if if game knowledge\ndetermines whether you win a game or\nlose a game what that should mean is\nthat my game knowledge is relatively\nfixed across 10 games right if i play\nlike if i'm a pro my game knowledge is\nfixed across those 10 games which means\nthat\neither my game knowledge is good enough\nand i should win all those 10 games or\nmy game knowledge is bad and i should\nlose all those 10 games his game\nknowledge is relatively static over the\ncourse of a 10 game stretch if you're a\nprofessional player you can also think\nabout this in medicine so if i'm a\ndoctor like\ni've been practicing for 20 years\nand like over a 10-day stretch it's not\nlike i forget a bunch of medicine and\nthat's why like patients do poorly or i\nremember a bunch of medicine that's why\npatients do well\nso an experience\nso this is where what most people miss\nis that a lot of your success or a lot\nof your ability to motivate or have your\nmind do what you want it to is not based\non trait or experience it's based on\nstate\nso states are temporary right it's a\nstate of mind a state of health\na state of illness\nso having the flu having influenza as a\nstate it's not a trait there's no\ninfluenza gene\nthis is like a temporary state\nand in our society we have a very very\nbig bias\ntowards focusing on traits instead of\nstates\nso basically when i work with someone\nwhat the what we focus on is who is the\nperson who sits down at the computer to\nplay the video game\nthis is really simple\nhow do you think a pro gamers\nperformances if they haven't slept for\n48 hours\nit's gonna suck\nright duh but wait a minute but like\nthey've played 10 they've played 20 000\nhours of the game before their game\nknowledge is still there that hasn't\ngone away it's not like they're live\ndementia\nthey're not more lazy less lazy there's\na lot of variability within our state\nand if you want to capture these kinds\nof moments and you have adhd\nthe way to capture them is by focusing\non state not trait\nbecause it's possible your brain is\ncapable of it if your brain wasn't\ncapable of it you would have never had\nhad it happen so this sort of feels like\nthe stars align\nnow here's the cool thing\nif you pay attention you can figure out\nwhat the stars are and even how to\narrange them and this is how you can get\nconsistent performance\nis by focusing on state so what we're\ngoing to do is take a look at\nseven or eight factors\nthat people tend to underemphasize when\nit comes to\ndetermining states\nokay\nso let's take a look at this\nso just a quick recap\nstate\nversus straight\nso these are things like personality\nfixed\ndeterministic\nwhy are you\nsuccessful i'm motivated\nwhy are you lazy i mean why are you\nunsuccessful because i'm lazy\nthese kinds of things even we can think\nabout motivation as a state as well but\noftentimes when you talk to people\nthey'll use motivated as a is a trait\nthis person is motivated\nright it's like oh like this person is\nmust be so motivated another good one is\nsmart\ntalented\nright this is like fix like smart is\nfixed\nit's not something that changes on an\nhourly basis\nso states are variable\nalterable\nand sort of like not deterministic right\nso it sort of like\nkind of varies that's the key thing\nbut they're both very very involved\nin terms of determining kind of\nwhat you accomplish\nso the flow state is a really good\nexample of like states of mind where\nwhere we have productivity so examples\nof state are the flow state we also have\nin meditation diana\nright we have different states of\nconsciousness\nwe can also call this in the zone\nso we know that this is these are\ntemporary the question is how do we\ncultivate them\nand answer there's a lot that we can do\nso the first thing that we can do to\ncultivate a particular state of mind is\ncontrol our thoughts\nso we're going to go into more detail\nwith some of these in less detail with\nothers so we just talked a little bit\nabout self-talk but you can actually\nchange your self-talk\nand this you can change through\nemotional processing\nso i'll give you guys just a quick\nexample\nso let's say i'm not motivated to date\nbut it's really hard for me to go on a\ndate and as i talk to someone so i've\ntalked to patients for example i'd be\nlike yeah it's really hard for me to go\non and i'll talk to them why okay what\nhappened\nwell i had this this one relationship\nthat lasted seven years\nand then the person kind of abandoned me\nand now like every time like and so i\nsort of feel they don't say it this way\nbut they end up feeling unlovable they\nend up fearing that the same thing will\nhappen to them again and so they don't\nwant to invest any amount of time in\ndating\nthey don't want to waste their time\nbecause they put seven years into this\nrelationship they didn't get it back\nand so now they're like scared to date\nbecause i don't have another seven years\nto waste\nand if i don't have seven years to waste\nand that's the predominant mind uh\nthought in my mind when i go on a date\nit's gonna like what like what does that\ncreate right it creates all kinds of\npressure on the other person it's a lack\nof confidence you're certainly not gonna\nhave fun\nright because you're like thinking about\ni can't afford to waste any time i can't\nafford to waste any time and you're\nsitting there you're supposed to be\ntrying to get to know someone like\nthat's not fun at all\nso this can sort of be somewhat of a\nself-controlling self-fulfilling\nprophecy so you have to learn how to\ncontrol your thoughts and a big part of\nthat is going to be emotional processing\nalso lots of detail into how to do that\nin dr k's guide to doing stuff\nsecond thing that we have to be really\ncareful about is our internal\nemotional state\nsort of related to number one but what i\nmean by this is like processing past\nemotions\nokay so this is like past emotions\nand what we sort of know if you look at\nstudies on people who have addictions\nwhat you discover is the part of their\nbrain that is aware\nof their internal emotional state\nis\nnot as robust as a healthy person\nso what does this mean if you ask people\nwho relapsed how did you relapse\neverything was going great and then i\ndon't know what happened\nthey'll say things like i don't know\nwhat happened\nif you actually tunnel down what you\ntend to find is that there's some kind\nof\nsubsurface powerful emotion that causes\nthem to reach for the numbing agent they\njust weren't aware of it so you have to\nbecome aware of your internal emotional\nstate how are you feeling in the moment\nnext thing that we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about this is really\ninteresting is we don't really think\nabout\nthe foods that we eat is psychoactive so\nwe know\nthat there are some things i can put\ninto my body like caffeine\nlet's say alcohol\nmarijuana\neven things like um you know people will\neven try stuff like theanine\nashwagandha\nthere's all kinds of stuff that we can\nuse kavakava\nthese are all herbs and stuff that are\npsychoactive affect the state of our\nmind\nbut we tend to think that these things\naffect our mind but we don't think about\nthings like sandwiches\nor tomatoes\nor rice\nor fried chicken\nas psychoactive substances\nbut it turns out that they are\ndiet in the treatment of adhd in\nchildren a systematic review of the\nliterature\na total of 52 studies were identified\nsome investigating whether adhd symptoms\ncan improve by avoiding certain food\nelements\n20 studies and whether some whether\ncertain foods may reduce adhd symptoms\nelimination diets and fish oil\nsupplementation seem to be promising\ndietary interventions for the reduction\nof adhd symptoms in children\ninteresting huh\nso let's understand this for a second\nwhat determines your motivation like\nwhich organ of the body determines\nmotivation and clarity of mind\nright\nchances are it's our brain\ni don't know if you guys know this\nbut the brain is a physiologic organ\nthat requires like physical substances\nso for example fish oil\nis high in omega-3\nand omega-3 is very very important for\nneuronal health\nso\nthere's a decent chance that if you have\ntrouble getting into the right state of\nmind\nthat your diet could be part of the\nproblem\nwhich we don't tend to think about and\nthis is why if you look at yogis so like\nyogis who want to meditate for 12 hours\na day\nthey're very controlling for their diet\ni've been on\ni mean not right now but in the past\ni've been on something called the satwik\ndiet\nand being on a scottish diet for 90 days\nis when you truly understand that's when\nyou begin\nto understand\nwhat meditation truly is\ni don't think you can even achieve\nsome of these higher states of\nconsciousness unless you're on a sativic\ndiet and that's why all the yogis eat\nthis way they're not eating that way for\ntheir figure and they're not eating\ntheir way out of financial reasons what\nthey've actually done is looked at all\nof the subtle effects of food on the\nmind and there's like a pro\nlike consciousness diet which they adopt\nsatvik\nokay\nwe're not going to go into that right\nnow but there are all kinds of food so\nthis is where like if you're struggling\nin terms of your motivation\nor this these clarity moments it's\nimportant what did you eat for the 24 to\n72 hours before you had that moment\nbecause chances are there's something in\nyour diet that helped a lot\nnext thing that we don't really consider\nin terms of states is low-grade\ninflammation\nthis is somewhat related to diet\nbut we also know that for example like\nwhen people have gluten sensitivity it\ncreates like a low-grade inflammation\nand then they have like trouble in their\nlike because their your brain is like\nmildly inflamed so if you think about\ngetting over a cold and how motivated\nand how energetic you are when you're\nlike a little bit sick\nand some of our diet is actually filled\nwith stuff that is kind of\npro-inflammatory\nand as there's all kinds of things like\nleaky gut hypothesis\nand we sort of know that like low-grade\ninflammation is going to be bad for\ncognitive function\nright i want you all to think about this\nthere are studies and these studies by\nthe way i've looked at a lot of them in\ndetail they're not very robust so the\ndata behind diet and adhd is actually\nnot that great\nby the way i mean there's like\nindications that it helps but i just\ndon't think that it's specific enough\nbut this is the kind of thing we're like\nwhat's the inflammatory state of your\nbody are you eating pro-inflammatory\nfoods are you getting like this is why\nlike if we look at scientific studies on\nhealth like what does it take you know\nfruits and vegetables\nand how much of this are you eating\nand if you're not eating enough of it\nchances are what you're going to do is\nyou're going to get constipated\nand as you get constipated i don't know\nif you'll know this but you start to get\nrotting material\nstuck\nin\nyour intestines\nand then this stuff causes inflammation\nhow do you feel\nafter you have a good poop\nright kind of weird we don't really\nthink about it very much\nso if you're like wondering how to\nbottle this lightning of these pro adhd\nlike these like high productivity states\nit involves touching on all of these\nthings\nnext thing that we don't really think\nabout\nis rest quality\nso how are you sleeping\nand this is where we don't really think\nabout a couple things so good example of\nthis\nso alcohol\nand marijuana\nboth reduce your rem sleep\nso this is the tricky thing about\nalcohol and to a lesser extent marijuana\nwe i know the science behind alcohol a\nlittle bit better\nalcohol helps people fall asleep but\nlowers the quality of their sleep\nso if you drink on a regular basis or\nyou smoke on a regular basis\nchances are the quality of sleep that\nyou're getting overnight is like not\ngood or it's worse\nso rem sleep generally composes of 18 to\n23\nof a night's sleep\nthe other thing about rem sleep is we're\nnot really sure what it does\nwe don't really know is even despite all\nof our advances it appears to be\nimportant but we're not quite sure how\nor why and we know that alcohol reduces\nyour rem sleep so you may still sleep\nfor eight or nine hours if you get drunk\nand you pass out\nyou're certainly it's very easy to fall\nasleep but then the quality of your\nsleep sucks\nso whatever your brain is trying to\naccomplish\nduring sleep where it goes through these\ndifferent stages and rem sleep and stuff\nlike that you're sabotaging it by using\nthese kinds of things\nso if your rest quality is not good your\nability to foster cultivate that magical\nstate of productivity is going to be\nhampered\nlast thing that we're going to talk\nabout\nis environment\nso this too we've got a lot we're going\nto cover it now but there's a lot more\ndetail about how to structure your\nenvironment in our upcoming guide\non dr k's guide to adhd and doing stuff\nbut let's go through a couple of basics\nokay so if you all want like worksheets\nand like implementation plans and stuff\nlike that that's all in the guide but\nwe're going to cover the basics right\nhere now\nso the first thing to understand is that\nthere are things called permissive\ninfluences\nso what's an example of a permissive\ninfluence a permissive influence is\nsomething that allows something else to\nhappen\nso for example in the female menstrual\ncycle\nwe have estrogen and progesterone\nso when my body secretes estrogen or\nwhen my ovaries secrete estrogen\nit creates progesterone receptors\nso estrogen goes\nin and creates\na progesterone receptor like this\nand now when i have progesterone\nwhich is a little cube it has something\nto go and activate\noh you guys can't see this\nokay\nso this is where like\nprogesterone doesn't work without\nestrogen\nand so this is where even if you look at\nthings like birth control for women it\ninvolves\nmessing with the balance of these\nhormones so that you essentially don't\nallow for a pro-gestational\ni.e pro-pregnancy state\nso what does this have to do with like\ncultivating these moments in adhd what\nare the permissive influences for those\nmoments\nwhen you hang out with a particular\ngroup of friends do they make you more\ninterested in working or less interested\nin working\nand this is where there's permissive\ninfluences for procrastination as well\nthere are permissive influences for bad\nstates of mind\nsometimes y'all may have had a on-again\noff-again relationship with someone\nwho's toxic that you just can't get away\nfrom\nwhen they enter your life boy is it a\nblast but boy does everything else in\nyour life start to go to hell\nso you can have people who are\npermissive influences for things like\nprocrastination and toxicity\nand you can have permissive influences\nfor things like focus\nambition\nand positivity\nso do you go to professional networking\nevents do you go to\nstartup meets i remember back when i was\nin boston there was this cool thing\ncalled venture cafe\nwhich was just an event a networking\nevent every week where there's like\nsomeone who comes and talks about\nstartups\nand you just go and you learn what\npeople\nare doing in the cambridge area which is\nlike near where mit is and stuff like\nthat\nharvard and mit are there\nso like you just go and like every week\nyou like if you just go and just talk to\npeople and you just like it gets you\nthinking gets the juices flowing\nright so for those of you that\nnoticed or touched a touch of grass\ninitiative so we've like got that going\non this is a great way to get out of\nyour house\nbecause if you're stuck within these\nfour walls what kinds of thoughts\ndo these four walls\nencourage\nwhen you're in these four walls what do\nyou feel like doing\nwhat do you end up doing what do you end\nup thinking about\nso if you want to capture\nthese motivational moments of brilliance\nwhat you've got to do is recognize first\nof all that it's not about traits it's\nnot about discipline it's not about\nintelligence it's not about talent it's\nabout states\nit's recognizing that this brain in\norder to create a certain state of focus\nmental focus\nis born of the mind and the mind is\nseated within the brain\nand we know this because if you eat\nparticular foods or ingest particular\nsubstances like alcohol it alters the\nfunction of your mind what organ system\nis alcohol\nfocus acting on it's focusing on the\nbrain\nso as we alter the physicality of our\nbrain we will create particular\nmental states\nso this is where a lot of that state\nwork is is done through things like diet\nsleep\nexercise vitamin d all that kind of\nstuff\nand there's more to it than that there's\ncultivating the right kinds of thoughts\nyou can certainly meditate\nthere's also cultivating the right kind\nof environment\nso if you're trying to capture those\nmoments\nit's not so much that you should not\nlook at what to do what you should do is\nlike look at that moment and try to look\nat the days before the weeks before what\nwas your emotional state\nwere you stressed out about something\nwere you feeling really good about stuff\nlike what hap what led up to that what\nwas going on within your body within\nyour gut within your brain and within\nyour mind\nthat fostered and allowed this fertile\nsoil for the state of consciousness to\narise\nand as you get into that then you will\nbe able to actually cultivate these\nstates consistently\nthis is the wild thing you can\nabsolutely do this\nand for those of you that are saying oh\ni just need to like sleep well and eat\nhealthy\nright that sounds hard so why is it hard\nto do it's because i don't think for\nmany people it clicks\nwhat the cost\nof sleeping poorly using drugs and\neating unhealthily is\nthey don't realize\nthat the cost is losing out on these\nmoments of brilliance\nwhat you're costing yourself is going\ninto super saiyan mode\nright we just don't appreciate the cost\nbecause it never clicks with us that\nthese two things are related\nand as we start to work on these\ninfluences you will find that this\neffort over time it takes time you're\ngoing to plant a seed you're going to\nplant another seed plant another seed\nit'll turn into a shrub and then\neventually it'll have flowers and then\neventually it'll bear fruit\nand once you sort of figure out what\nyour internal formula is in terms of\nlike productivity and focus like it'll\ntransform your life\nquestions\nthis is a good question\nwhat if sleep deprivation cause makes\nyou disinhibited enough to reach that\nstate isn't it a slippery slope great\nquestion\nsomeone else is asking sometimes i\nperform better when i'm fatigued\nso there's one really important\nexception\nto being well rested\nso when you're fatigued\nyour mind is a little bit exhausted and\nyour thoughts move slower\nwhen your thoughts move slower\nif\nwhat is destroying your focus is a\nhyperactive mind then you will be more\nfocused\nso if i if there's a good level of focus\nthis focus can be destroyed either by\nhaving a hyperactive mind or a\nhypoactive mind\nso for example if i feel overwhelmed and\ni can't focus because i have a thousand\ndifferent things going on\nand my mind is all over the place that's\na hyperactive mind\nso focus can be shattered by a\nhyperactive mind and sometimes fatigue\ncan be an antidote to that\nright because then like your mind is\nlike operating at 80\nand so 80\nof all of your stress actually puts you\nin a good good space\nbecause you're normally like your mind\nis operating at like 120\nso you need some kind of fatigue to kind\nof calm you down and chill you out this\nis also why some people will reach for\nsubstances to calm themselves down to\ntreat their anxiety right i use\nmarijuana for my anxiety for example\nbecause it slows their mind down so the\ngoal is slowing your mind down now you\ncan do that\nthrough a substance you can do it\nthrough a medication sometimes\nyou can do it through fatigue\nor you can do it through healthier\nmethods than all of those which is like\ntraining your mind to slow down\nprocessing thoughts learning how to\ncompartmentalize thoughts learning how\nto set things down in your mind there\nare all kinds of different things you\ncan do you can also train your your\nthoughts through your breathing\nso the speed of your thoughts correlates\nwith the speed of your exhalation\nspecifically\nso this is why for example when people\nare hyperventilating in a panic attack\nwe'll ask you to breathe in a paper bag\nwhy do we ask you to breathe in a paper\nbag we don't really do that as much\nanymore\nbut that's because like as you breathe\nin a\npaper bag the co2 level within the bag\nstarts to sort of increase so you have\nto take slower deeper breaths\nso what happens is we have this thing\ncalled physiologic dead space so i don't\nknow if this sort of makes sense but\neven when i fully exhale my lungs are\nnot completely empty\nright it's not like completely empty\nthere's air stuck in there that keeps my\nlungs open\nthen what happens is the air down here\nlet's say like if i have air down here\nin my lungs\nlike along the bottom\nall the oxygen has been removed from the\nthat air then when i exhale this air\ngoes out and ends up in my throat\nbecause even at the end of my exhalation\nthere's actually air in my throat\nand then when i breathe in again this\nair is the first air that goes down into\nmy lungs\nso we have this thing called physiologic\ndead space which is space where there's\nair that has no oxygen\nso if i'm taking shallow breaths the\ndead air is moving here here here here\nhere and i only get fresh air in this\npart whereas if i take a deep breath the\ndead air goes down here the air with\nthat oxygen goes down here and then i\nget all this with fresh air if that sort\nof makes sense\nso we want to encourage hypoventilation\nto calm down anxiety\nit's physiologic\nyogi's figured this out as well it's\npart of the reason that a lot of these\nbreathing practices involve slowing the\nbreath and thus controlling the mind\nso the key thing here is that your mind\ncan be controlled\nyou can foster a particular state of\nmind that's incredibly productive\nyou just have to know how to do it\nand this is the cool thing is that all\nof these decisions are not don't require\nlike willpower right it's not forcing\nyourself into the state of mind it's\nactually decisions that you make the day\nbefore in the day before in the day\nbefore\nit's going to bed a little bit earlier\nwaking up a little bit later potentially\nit's about processing your emotions a\nlittle bit better it's about having\nlet's say an apple before you have your\npepperoni pizza as opposed to just\nhaving pepperoni pizza all of these\nthings will will matter right so giving\nup pepperoni pizza is like hard from a\nwillpower standpoint but if you're\nstarving like kind of nudging yourself\ntowards eating an apple before you dive\ninto the pizza is way easier\npizza's right there i'm going to take\ntwo slices instead of three i'm just\ngonna have an apple first\nas you start to cultivate these sorts of\nchanges your mind will improve\nand when your mind improves you'll find\nyourself in these states more often\nso someone's asking does this mean i\nshould go for a crazy run in the morning\nto control adhd a bit that's where i\nwould say you should try it and see what\nhappens\nright\nyou should try it so that's where like\nyou're gonna figure out this is where\nthe right answer is not something that\ni'm gonna tell you because i don't know\nwhat your body is precisely i don't know\nwhat your brain is precisely i don't\nknow what your mind is precisely these\nare the major factors that people tend\nto miss\nthank you very much for the donations by\nthe way\nokay so i see other questions what if\nyour mind is hypoactive\nso that's where so our mind becomes sort\nof hypoactive especially through\ntechnology use it becomes kind of dulled\nright where then what happens is we need\nthe technology to like artificially ramp\nit up\nso an engaging\ntick tock or an adrenaline inducing\nvideo game takes a baseline hypoactive\nmind and amplifies it to a normal level\nwhich is why it's so damn addictive and\nthen once we stop playing the game\nwe go back to the hypoactive mind\nright and we don't like being in that\nstate so we need the adrenaline to like\nbuild up and the other problem is that\nas we get more and more adrenaline\nthrough the game we actually down\nregulate some of our receptors in our\nbrain not really adrenaline receptors\nthis is sort of a extrapolation here\nthen what happens is we sort of become\ndependent on it almost like caffeine\nso if your mind is hypoactive that's\nwhere we look at some of these\npermissive influences like what are you\neating\nwho are you spending time with who are\nthe people that stimulate your thoughts\nin the right direction\nthank you for the donation nicholas\nso g dom 2000 is saying i can confirm\nthat exercise and diet helped my with my\nadhd the worse i eat the worse my\nsymptoms tend to get\nright and then if you go into ayurveda\nso we don't really have great scientific\nevidence for this but if you go into\nayurveda they even say there are\nparticular foods that fruits and\nvegetables are not all the same\nthat particular fruits and particular\nvegetables will be good at cultivating\nparticular mental states now we have\nsome evidence of\nthis sort of right so ayurveda goes as\nfar as saying particular foods are good\nfor particular mental states but they\nstart by saying that that presumes that\nall of the foods are unique\nand generally speaking in western\nmedicine for a long time we've said five\nservings of fruits or vegetables doesn't\nreally matter what you eat whereas now\nwe know that there are some things like\ncruciferous vegetables that have\nparticular effects on your cytochrome\np450 enzymes we know that grapefruit can\ndo that as well and we'll actually like\ncause particular alterations\nso we now are starting to see that\nthere's a lot more specificity to fruit\nand vegetable than we originally\nrealized\neven if you look at some of these things\nlike the fodmap diets these are good\nexamples of like how particular food not\nall fruits and vegetables are made the\nsame and there's an intersectional\ncomponent between\nfoods that we eat as well as someone's\nindividual digestion\nthese are concepts that ar veda has been\nhypothesizing or proposing for thousands\nof years\nokay so fractal loop as a great question\ni've heard probiotics have positive\neffects on mental health due to gut\nhealth what do you think\nso\nvery good question we go into a lot of\ndetail in this and dr k's guide so you\nall can watch it there's a lot more\ndetail but we'll answer it here\nso\ngut bacteria\nhas\ndefinitely a strong impact\non your mental health\nso we know this because\nwe know this from a lot of different\nways so we know that gut bacteria can\nsometimes cause inflammation or re or be\nhealthy and have less inflammation\nso inflammation in the gut leads to\ninflammation in the brain inflammation\nin the brain tends to negatively impact\nthings like mood this we know\nsecond thing that we know certain kinds\nof gut bacteria are more symbiotic than\nothers\nso some get gut bacteria will make\nneurotransmitter precursors\nso they'll produce tryptophan so here's\nthe relationship you have with your gut\nbacteria you give it food\nit gives you\nit breaks down the food keeps some for\nitself and gives you what's left over\nand your brain takes tryptophan which is\nmade by some gut bacteria and turns it\ninto serotonin\nwhich by the way is what we supplement\nwhen people are depressed or have\nanxiety disorders\nokay so we know that gut creates\nneurotransmitter precursors\nnext thing that we know so those are\nlike basic science kind of things the\nquestion though is that do those\nactually lead to clinical benefits sure\nit causes inflammation we can measure\nthat sure they create neurotransmitters\nbut does it actually make a difference\nclinically the answer is yes\nwe've done studies on stool transplants\nwhich is exactly what it sounds like\nthey will take stool from one person or\nrat\nand implant it into another person or\nrat and they will see improvement in\nconditions like major depressive\ndisorder\nso it appear and stool by the way is 50\nbacteria\nokay\nso we've tested it seems to work take\nthe poop from a depressed rat stick it\ninto\noh sorry take the poop from a healthy\nrat stick it into a depressed rat and\nthe depressed rat gets better\nwe also know that there are particular\nstrains of bacteria that are more common\nin people who have bad anxiety there are\ntwo strains of bacteria that are tightly\nassociated with bad anxiety and there\nare two strains of bacteria that appear\nto be anti-anxiety or if you look\nwhat we mean by that is if you look at\npeople who have low anxiety scores and\nyou check their gut there are two\nbacteria that they have that people have\nhigh anxiety don't have in fact people\nhave high anxiety have these two\ndifferent kinds of bacteria\nthere seems to be a lot of\nconnections\nbetween gut bacteria\nand mental health\nthe question though\nwas probiotics\nand mental health now this is where the\nmarketing gets tricky\nso if you take a probiotic\nhow long are you supposed to take it\npeople usually say take it every day why\ndo you have to take probiotics every day\nthey're they have cfus\ncolony forming units they're living\nbacteria\nwhy do you have to take product\nprobiotics all day long\nthat's because probiotics may not affect\nit and the reason is because which\nbacteria grow in your gut\nthe ones that you feed\nso this is where like you know the\nhealth industry would love to say hey\nlook at all this research on mental\nhealth and gut bacteria take this pill\nevery day by the way you need to take it\nevery day in order to get this\nbeneficial bacteria\nbut what determines your gut bacteria is\nnot whether you take a probiotic every\nday\nit's what you feed your bacteria\nso if i eat a lot of like processed\nfoods with simple sugars they're going\nto be some bacteria in my gut\nthat\ndigest those preferentially\nright so i'm going to be feeding the\nbacteria that like processed foods and\nsimple sugars whereas if i eat like\noatmeal and broccoli all the time i'm\ngoing to be feeding the bacteria that\nbreak down complex fibers and like\ncall\ncellulose and some of these other things\nthat we can't digest\nso the key thing about maintaining\nproper gut bacteria is not taking\nprobiotics every day it's eating the\nright foods so if i take probiotics and\nthen i feed i can take i can add 50 000\nunits of whatever kind of bacteria you\nwant in a call in a probiotic pill\nbut 50 000 units is nothing we have 10\ntimes as many bacterial cells in our\nbody as we have human cells\nfor every one cell inside this that is\nhuman there are 10 cells that are\nbacterial\nso fifty thousand hundred thousand three\nhundred thousand cfus\nof like\nprobiotics is like nothing compared to\nwhat you've got in there\nso this is where what i tend to find is\nthat you can take probiotics but you've\ngot to eat the right foods too and what\nwe love to do in current developed\nsociety we love to take pills\nthat\nabsolve us of behaviors\ni don't want to eat broccoli just give\nme the freaking probiotic pill\nand there is a whole supplement industry\nthat loves that\nso what is the role of probiotics on\nmental health short answer is we don't\nknow\nright we i don't at least i haven't seen\noverwhelming or convincing evidence that\nprobiotics consistently help\nthere's some evidence that they help\nbecause you do need to populate with the\nright bacteria the key thing that people\nmiss is that once you populate with the\nright bacteria you need to support those\nbacteria with the right foods\nand as you support those bacteria with\nthe right foods then you'll start to see\npositive effects which is exactly how we\nget to this paper\nright so if we go back to this one\nelimination diets and fish oil\nsupplementation seem to improve symptoms\nof adhd\nso why is the elimination diet important\nprobably from the inflammatory\nstandpoint\nokay\nso people are asking what foods promote\ntryptophan and serotonergic precursors\nso this is where our science\nfalls short\nso it's my belief that the ayurvedic\ndiet\nthe mechanism of action of ayurvedic\ndiets is through gut bacteria that's my\nbelief we actually don't have a whole\nlot of strong science to support that\nand our western conception of diet is\nstill i think like very primitive\nso we still think predominantly in\nmacronutrients\nwe need 50 grams of protein but as one\ngram of protein the same as another gram\nprotein if i get a gram of protein from\na lentil is that the same as a chicken\nbreast if the chicken breast is organic\nand free range does that matter\nso we tend to think about macro\nnutrients we tend to\nsplit things up and we're like grams of\nfiber is what's important which is true\nbut we don't really have good evidence\non this this is something that i will\nsay is that\nwhen i work with patients\nright so i don't have data to support\nthis but anecdotally patients who adopt\nbetter diets\ncan come off of medication easier i've\nseen that very consistently in my\npractice\nnow what's going on there is it the gut\nbacteria who knows is just eating\nhealthy who knows\nit could be correlational as well that\npeople who are\nhealthier can eat healthier right\nbecause it's like harder to make\nyourself\nsalad than it is to like microwave\nsomething from the freezer\nso maybe there could be a correlational\nthing where it's not really causation it\ncould be correlation\nyeah so i think we have we've\npublished some of this stuff so i\ndefinitely know there's there's guide\nsupplements i mean uh\ndietary supplements with dr k's guide i\nimagine that some of those are floating\naround on the internet\nbut\num\nand you know a lot of different people\nwill talk about ayurvedic diet"
