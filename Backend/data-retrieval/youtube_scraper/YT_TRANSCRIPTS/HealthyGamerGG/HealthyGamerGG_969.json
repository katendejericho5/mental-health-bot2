    "transcript": "even if you believe that you deserve a\nrelationship do you believe that there\nare factors outside of your control that\nare preventing you from having that\nrelationship\nhas anyone actually found a girlfriend\nthere are many people in this community\nwho are unable to find a girlfriend and\ndr k addressed this subject quite often\nand gave his advices\nbut i wonder\nit's a good question right\nif anyone\nhere actually made it out of this\nsituation\nso let's understand this for a moment\nokay\nhas anyone here actually found a\ngirlfriend\nso this is what happens\ni'm looking for love\nand i show up on this place called the\ninternet\nand i'm like yo\npeople\nhow does one find love and a lot of\npeople give me answers there's no\nshortage of answers\nright i can go to youtube i can go to\nreddit i can go to advice forums\ni can\nprobably not linkedin but there are a\nlot of other places where people talk\nabout how to find relationships i watch\ni watch videos about alpha males i watch\nvideos about beta males i watch videos\nabout sigma males\ni watch videos from people who are in\ntouch with themselves emotionally\ni watch videos about growth and i watch\ndr k and then like everyone gives me\nanswers like look at all the answers\nthere are there's so many different\nanswers\nand then i go to places like\ni don't know let's take a look at\nthe dating advice subreddit\nright\nare my like 1.1 upvotes are my standards\ntoo high or does the dating pool just\nsuck\nwhere sex i've ever had but i like him\nno text back after a second date\nright so let's sort by top\na perfect girl canceled our date only 20\nminutes prior i was already the uber\nthis just happened to me five minutes\nago no text back after a second date you\nknow how how to attract people you're\nattracted to like do like what do you\nthink\nyou think this stuff\nworks\nso here's what's hard about this\nsituation if you're looking for a\nrelationship\nyou're like a motivated person right\nyou're like okay like this is important\nto me i'm gonna focus on it\nso you go and you collect information\nyou do research what do people tell you\nthey tell you work on yourself don't try\ntoo hard just be yourself be the best\nversion of yourself\nright they give you this kind of advice\nyou're like all right let's go so you\nwork on yourself\nbecause everyone's telling you don't try\nto like find a relationship you're going\nto appear desperate and just work on\nyourself in the relationship the\nrelationship will come all you have to\ndo is open yourself up to the universe\nand the relationship will come you focus\non yourself you cannot control the\nactions of others you can only control\nyourself so you must work on yourself\nand you do that\nfor six months or a year\nno relationship\nyou lose heart a little bit and you're\nlike all right\nso you're like you take a break for a\nlittle while because like you can't you\nknow how long can you do the sigma grind\nset\nand then like you know a couple months\ngo by you're feeling lonely again you\nlike turn back to the internet you're\nlike all right what do i do about this\nand everyone's like saying the same\nthing\nwork on yourself work on yourself work\non yourself you're like all right here\nwe go again\nwork on yourself\nso you work on yourself for a while\nand then like six months go by eight\nmonths go by one year goes by\nyou're working like you're making\nprogress\nright you're like more in shape\nyou got a promotion\nyou like went to therapy\nyou're doing everything right\nsecond year goes by and you're like\nstill scratching your head and you're\nlike went on a couple dates but as we\nsaw this person canceled 20 minutes\nbefore i showed up this person never\ntexted me back like this kind of crap\nhappens and then you're like kind of\nshrugging your shoulders and you're like\nwait a minute\ndoes this crap actually work so you you\ndig deep\nsix months a couple months along this go\nby and you're like ah like the only\nthing i can control is myself i cannot\ncontrol the actions of others let me\ncontrol myself i work on myself more\nwork work work work work\nso you work on yourself again like\nhere's the thing at some point there's\ngot to be a payoff\nand each time you go through this cycle\nand you feel\nlike okay i gotta work on myself\nbecause that's what people say is gonna\nwork right is working on myself you work\non yourself it doesn't work\nand then people like just work on\nyourself more bro i'm like all right\nokay fine so you dig deep again you use\na lot of willpower overcome it you're\nlike there's a little bit of despair\nright because you've been doing this now\nfor a couple years you've been working\non yourself but no one seems to care\nhow much progress you've made no one\ngives a [ __ ]\nand then like you dig deep and then you\ndo it again\nride this get back on the buck and\nbronco\nand then you ride it for a while it\ntosses you off and then you're like man\ni'm so tired of working on myself like\nwhen like when\nwhen\neveryone talks about how\nno one talks about when is there even a\nwin\nand then you start to doubt yourself and\nthen it's like it's sort of like\nyou don't know\nwhat what what's going on here\nlike how do you deal with this how do\nyou understand first of all\nwhy does everyone keep on saying\nwork on yourself\nand like why doesn't that seem to work\nor does it work or why do they think\nit's work why does it work for them but\nit doesn't work for you like what are\nyou missing\nso we've got to start this by\nunderstanding a little bit about how\nbelief structures form in a little bit\nabout how information is poorly\ndisseminated on the internet\nso the first thing to understand is that\nwe have these things that\naaron back sort of coined as core\nbeliefs\nthousands of years ago the yogis called\nthese samskars so let's like understand\nfirst of all like how we get into the\nsituation and what to do about it so the\nfirst thing to understand is that as we\nnavigate the world our brains try to\nmake sense of stuff\nthey our brain tries to come up with\nformulas that make it easy\nto navigate things because you can't\nyou have to like simplify crap\nso our brains look at lots of different\nexperiences and then they form\nconclusions\nthat make it easy\nlike i'm a good person\nor i'm not a good person right so if i\nget yelled at a lot when i'm a kid\nmy brain sort of figures out okay i'm\nnot a good person and then actually\nthat's adaptive\nbecause if i sort of start to realize\nlike so let's say that a\ntragic story let's say i'm a talented\nkid\nand i do really really well\nand my parents are actually jealous of\nme this actually happens by the way\nso as they become jealous of me what do\nthey do\nthey beat me down\nright they call me not a good kid\nand then what happens is i start to\ninternalize that belief i come to\nconclusions oh i did a good job mom and\ndad yelled i did a good job they yelled\ni did a good job they yelled ergo i'm a\nbad person\nnow what happens if i'm a bad person i\nstop doing a good job\nnow i conform to my parents expectations\nas i conform to my parents expectations\noddly enough it hurts less\nso now i've figured out the rules of the\ngame and how to play that game\nthis then becomes a core belief\nthen what happens is core beliefs spew\nthese things\nso this is what what uh aaron beck sort\nof laid out so core beliefs are like\nbeliefs about myself like i am unlovable\nor i will be alone forever\nthen what happens is these core beliefs\nform adaptations\nso we adapt to them we start to make\nassumptions we start to make rules for\nhow to live my life based on this core\nbelief\nand then those rules then will spawn\nsomething called automatic thoughts\nso this is where like if someone doesn't\ntext me back right away oh she doesn't\ncare\nor he doesn't care\nlike that thought is immediate\nit's severe and it's automatic\nso what the yogis basically said the\nsame thing what they said is that when\nyou have an emotional experience that is\nundigested the emotion sinks down and\ngoes dormant\nand then that emotion can get triggered\nand all of the thoughts that come with\nthat emotion will now be applied to your\ncurrent situation\nso if the last time that my my partner\nwas being shady and not returning my\ntexts they were\nhaving an affair\nthat's a lot of emotions to manage\nright i break up with them\nthat gets becomes baggage relationship\nbaggage right we even understand that\nnow like\nyogis were smart er jude aaron beck was\nsmart but like we don't have to be smart\neveryone understands that people have\nrelationship package what does that mean\nit's the emotions that you carry over\nthe patterns that you carry over the\nassumptions that you carry over from the\nlast relationship\nso as we carry over these assumptions of\noh like people are untrustworthy then if\nyour partner is like not available for a\nfew hours you have thoughts\nboom\nthis person is cheating\nwhere are those thoughts coming from\nthis person is giving you no reason to\ndistrust them\nthe distrust is actually coming from you\nright so that's what they sort of said\nin in that's what a samskaras is a very\nsimilar to a core belief\nso if you're entering the dating pool\nthe first thing you've got to understand\nis like what are your beliefs about this\ndo you believe that you can find someone\ndo you believe that you are lovable\ndo you believe that you are worthy of\nhaving like a good relationship do you\nbelieve you deserve a relationship\nthere may be other kinds of core beliefs\neven if you believe that you deserve a\nrelationship do you believe that there\nare factors outside of your control that\nare preventing you from having that\nrelationship\nright so this is some of the\nintermediate beliefs that that aaron\nbeck sort of talked about is sort of\nlike we'll see this where we can say\nlike oh because of things like concepts\nlike sexual marketplace value or\nwhatever like you know oh these are like\nadaptive beliefs that essentially\ncompensate for the idea that like i'm\nterrified of being alone\nso we come up with all these like rules\nand ideas\nnow the key thing to understand\nabout all these core beliefs in some\nscars is that we tend to think about\nthem as\ncoming from the inside and affecting the\noutward world right so if i get\ntriggered in a particular way i'll feel\nemotionally bad it'll generate thoughts\nin my head it'll generate behaviors\nso the directionality of core beliefs as\nmost people think about it is outward\nright so there's a belief that i hold it\nshapes my thoughts which in turn shapes\nmy emotions and shapes my behavior\nwhat people lose sight of\nis that core beliefs don't just shape\nyour thoughts they also shape your\nperceptions huge\nundervalued piece of information\nso if you believe you are unlovable what\nthat means is you will amplify\nparticular signals\nand you will reduce other signals\nso what happens is every time something\nhappens let's say that you have a 50 50\nand one person says oh yeah i'm really\ninterested in seeing you again and\nanother person doesn't answer your texts\nyour mind will actually hang on to one\nmore than the other\nso it shapes your perceptions\nand that's how you get\nto this\nhas anyone does it actually happen\nbecause what happens is all of the\npositive information tends to get\nfiltered out\nand the negative information get tends\nto get amplified\nnow the problem with this is like this\nhas been going on for thousands of years\nso what's changed now now what's changed\nis this\nso not only does my mind amplify\nnegative information and reduce positive\ninformation\nbut the internet itself amplifies\nnegative information and reduces\npositive information so i want you all\nto think about this\nif you look up information on\nrelationships on the internet\nit doesn't matter whether it's discord\nor reddit or youtube or whatever\nare people who are in healthy\nrelationships\nchain posting are there communities\nabout i have an awesome relationship\nthere's no community like that\nwhat happens if you just if you post\non dating advice\nhey i have an amazing relationship what\ndo you think is gonna happen you're\ngonna get down voted\nbragging\narrogant\nall the people on there resentful get\ndownvoted into oblivion\nright so the internet doesn't like are\nthere a thousand videos about how to\nfind relationships\nyes\nare there a thousand videos about hey my\nrelationship is awesome i'm grateful\nwho the hell would watch that what is\nthe point of watching that\nso not only do we have this cognitive\nbias but the other thing that happens\nis that the internet amplifies that\nso we amplify the negative\nwe reduce the positive and the internet\nlike just turn turns both of those dials\nlike way up\nand so then what we get is a perception\nwe get this question and what i love\nabout this community is like this person\nwas like critical enough\nto think\nabout this and be like actually hold on\na second because i want y'all to\nappreciate this for a second this person\nrecognized that they had a thought\ni'm not gonna find a girlfriend and this\ncrap doesn't work for people and then\nthey were critical of it\nby the way you guys want to see what the\nanswers are\nso what do you think do you think people\nactually find girlfriends\nwhat do y'all think chat\nhuh\ndo people find girlfriends yay or nay\nso rhinogator saying no\nimpossible no no no no let's see\nfirst answer yeah\ni met my girlfriend through mutual\nfriends when we first met i wasn't even\nlooking to date her just thought hey\nshe's cool we kept hanging out i really\nenjoyed our company then one night we\ngot drunk and hooked up and that was\nthat\nright\nlet's go down\nyes\nbut i think that finding a girlfriend\nboyfriend is unique quest for every\nplayer there's much more to that in the\nsimple yes or no answer\nmy consistent problem for roughly 10\nyears ago is my tendency withdraw\nfrankly in the last six or seven years\npassing fan she's focusing on myself\nbasically i'm a lot more social now i\nperform betterly i'm kind of a late\nbloomer\nso it seems like\nthis person is improving but hasn't\nfound it yet gaming wife here\nso this person's married\nyes dude of course\nit's not this impossible quest that some\npeople on this reddit think it is then\nthe question becomes why do people think\ni don't know this is great i don't know\ni'm 29 and i've never been anywhere near\nclose to having a girlfriend right so\nthis is where your automatic thought\nsays but i'm not like other people i am\nhopeless i'm convi at this point i'm\nconvinced here's the core belief\ni'm no good and no one will ever want me\nhey man i used to feel the same way and\ni'm engaged now\na good friend of mine was 30 when he\nfinally had a girlfriend and lost his\nvirginity a friend his acquaintance of\nmine was 31. there's nothing magical\nabout these ages\nwow\nright\nlike\nyou know like i know it's kind of weird\nbut\nthe problem is that\nso most of the people are saying yes\nthis stuff works\nhere's the big piece of information\nthat's missing\nno one tells you the timeline\neveryone tells you what to do no one\ntells you how long it'll take\nand that's what screws people\nbecause then what happens if you spend a\nyear working on yourself and you don't\nfind a girlfriend you're like\nscrew it\ni did what they said and it's not\nworking\nit's like when we plant a seed\nwe don't expect a fruit within a year\nright we have a good expectation of like\nall right i gotta plant this seed it's\ngotta shoot it's gotta become a shoot\nand it's become a tree then it's gonna\nhave flowers and a couple of years from\nnow it'll have fruit\nwe know what to expect\nit's like imagine if you went to college\nand and you were like oh like how do i\nfind a job go to college\nand no one told you how long college\ntakes\nlike imagine how\nidiotic college would seem you're like\ni've been here for a friggin year\nwhere's the job\nand so then you like quit for a little\nwhile and then you go back to college\nyou do your second year like where's the\njob\nyou go back\npeople like yeah just go to college go\nto college go to college that's how you\nget a job you go for a third you're like\nwhere's the job\nno one tells us in terms of this dating\nadvice crap how long it takes\nand so we have we have no idea what to\nexpect and that's like a crit like\nyou'll get this it's a critical piece of\ninformation\nhow long do i need to work on myself for\nthis crap to work\nno one talks about durations\nand why is that because it's\nindividualized\nsort of\nright but that's where we can actually\nlike go into data and we can understand\nokay how long does it take\nand it's like kind of luck\nand then it becomes super confusing\nbecause it's like okay what amount of\nthis do i need to improve in one amount\nof this is time because if someone says\nit takes five years\nand then i kind of like do stuff but i\ndon't try hard enough like\nin five years what if it doesn't work it\ngets super confusing\nso what do you if you're wondering if\nyou're out there and wondering okay all\nthis crap about finding a romantic\npartner does it actually work\nso here's the answer\nyes it works\nit just takes a really long time\nwe're talking three years four years\nfive years seven years\nso it's sort of like honestly it's like\nopening a loot box that's what dating is\nfinding a romantic partner is opening a\nloot box\ni don't know exactly what the odds are\nthere are certain things you can do to\nimprove the odds but at the end of the\nday the only guaranteed way to get the\nitem\nis to keep opening loot boxes\ni don't know what the odds are i wish i\ncould tell you\nbut in my experience if you've if you\nhave like no social skills whatsoever\nand you're like going nowhere in life\ngive it at least five years\nand for those of you who are saying i\ncan't do this for five years that sounds\ndepressing like i don't know what else\nto tell you\nfive years is not that long of a time\ngive yourself five years to grow into a\nhuman being that someone else would want\nto date work on your social skills get\nprofessionally independent\nget so get financially independent\nbecome professionally successful get\ninto shape physically take care of your\nmental like this stuff takes time\nthe other thing is i don't actually\nthink it's gonna take five years but\nhere's the magical thing when you set a\ntarget i'm sort of like debating y'all\nand also like d debating y'all in a\nmoment but if you give yourself five\nyears\nyou won't expect anything in two years\nand when you're expecting it is when\nit's when you're not expecting it is\nwhen it's the most likely to happen\nright the top post was like i wasn't\neven trying to date i just thought this\nperson was cool and we were hanging out\nand that was a lot of fun that is the\nmost successful\neven with the person that i married like\ni didn't even realize we were going on\ndates she was telling me yeah you took\nme out on a date i'm like no i didn't\nwhat are you talking about i was just\nshowing you around town you were like\nnew to town and i was like i'll just\nshow you around oh you like thai food\nlike i know a great place let's go\nso like absolutely focus on yourself\nabsolutely like give it time though\nwe're talking about two years three\nyears four years sometimes what it\nrequires is obliviousness on your part\nwhy does the obliviousness matter i know\nit sounds kind of weird but once you get\nout of your own head\nlike it's so much easier\nand that's that's the thing is like\nbecause when we think about it why is it\nso hard when we're in our own head to\ndate people\nit's like literally we are in our head\nso we're not attending to the other\nperson\nwe're not empathically connecting with\nthem\nwe're empathically connecting with our\nanxious self\nand so then i become anxious\ni start to worry about particular things\ni'm not really paying attention to her\ni'm kind of zoned out or i'm kind of\nstaring and distracted what\nand then like\nthe person i'm on a date with is kind of\nlike that's weird\nmakes them feel a little bit\nuncomfortable i see them\nbecoming a little bit uncomfortable the\nanxiety in my head\ngoes oh no now they're not having fun\ni'm not fun anymore oh crap now what do\ni do how do i get them to have fun\nhave fun have fun have fun figure out\nfigure out you can make enough fun you\ncan help me can i have fun and then they\nsee the desperation in your face and\nthey're like the [ __ ] is going on\nso get out of your head\nfocus on yourself put yourself out there\nright like that advice is all true\nlike there's a reason why we hear it\nover and over and over again\nbut give it time\nrecognize that for the first year second\nyear like when you're putting yourself\nout there you're not gonna get much what\nyou're really doing is like leveling up\nwe're\nnot zoning into the raid yet\nwe're just getting ready\nto zone in\nright that's that's really the solution\nand chances are it takes years i mean it\ntakes a lot of people like i don't know\nwhat the average age is for people to\nget married but i get the sense it's\ngetting older\nso i'd say like 26 27 is probably\naverage i would say 28 maybe and for\npeople saying but i'm 31. yeah 27 is\naverage\nthat means that there are a lot of\npeople getting married at 21 and there\nare a lot of people getting married at\n33.\n35 like there's a range\nso how long does it take years does it\nwork absolutely\njust keep at it\nand all along the way the last piece\nthat i'll uh of advice or guidance i'll\ngive you\nany amount of resentment that you have\nabout this whole process is a hundred\npercent justified and 100 needs to be\ndealt with\nif you're hopeless and resentful\ncompletely get you bro\nor girl\nor whatever you are in between totally\nfine\nbecause things for non-binary people are\nnot easier let me tell you what\ntotally fine to be resentful and you\nneed to manage that outside of the\ndating sphere right because we see this\nlike when that resentment enters\nwhen people don't text you back you're\nsabotaging yourself you're shooting\nyourself in the foot you're making it\neven harder then that becomes a\nself-fulfilling prophecy enhances the\ncore belief that people don't care about\nme\nwhen really what they're detecting from\nme is resentment and like what are they\nwhat are you expecting if you project\nresentment what do you think someone's\ngoing to fall in love with you because\nyou're a resentful person\nlike\nthat's going to be tricky\nso manage those emotions externally go\nsee a therapist work with someone like\nwork with a coach if you want to\ntalk to friends\nvent about it on discord\nyou know like you've got to manage that\nstuff\nand by the way this is like this is why\nso i know it sounds kind of weird i'm\ngoing to tell you all a story\nso when i was training to become a\npsychiatrist\ni they asked us a question\nsaid if a patient walks into your office\nand says can you help me find a\ngirlfriend\nwhat should your answer be\nand there were a lot of right answers\nbut there was just one wrong answer\nthe wrong answer\naccording to my teachers was yes\ni can help you do that\nthe right answers were i don't know what\ndo you think makes it hard for you to\nfind a girlfriend why is that important\nto you\nthat sounds like it's very important to\nyou do you feel lonely those were all\ncorrect answers\nthe one wrong answer\nright and that's what we trained to do\nas therapists the one wrong answer is\nyes\nbecause we are taught as therapists that\nan outcome for a patient is not our\nresponsibility\nsomething i lost a little bit of faith\nin therapy that day i think therapy's\nwonderful i love being a therapist\nbut i lost a little bit of faith in how\nhands-off the profession is\nnow there may be therapists out there\nthat disagree with that there may be\ntherapists out there that\nyou know\nconsider that to be an unfair attack on\nthe profession it's just my experience\ni think it's not uncommon by the way\nso i think oftentimes when people go to\ntherapy looking for guidance what they\nget is questions\nthat's why i started a coaching program\nbecause like\nat the end of the day like there are\npeople out there in our community who\nare like looking to find a girlfriend\nthere are people out there who are\nlooking to find a relationship boyfriend\nthere are people out there who are like\nhave a particular goal that they want to\nachieve\nand if we look at outcome measures for\ntherapy\nyou know being in a stable relationship\nis not something that we measure it's\nnot an outcome that we're trained\ntowards do we do stuff around couples\ntherapy 100\nbut it's couples therapy right it\npresumes like the starting point so if\nyou think about you know there's this\ndegree called the\nlmft\nlicensed marriage and family therapist\nthe presumption is that the marriage is\nalready there\nyou all get that couple's counseling it\npresumes that you're already a couple\nyou can get trained in that as a\ntherapist but what about getting into a\nrelationship in the first place\nwhere's the certification for that in\ntherapy\nand this is the difference couples\ncounseling is about\ntaking a marriage\nor a relationship that is having\nchallenges is busted in some way and\nbringing it back to health that's the\nmedical model\nthe coaching model is\nlet's help you achieve your goals\nlet's help you understand what are your\nsome scars\nthat's why we teach coaches about vedic\npsychology in this eastern perspective\nwhat are your some scars what are the\nemotions from the past that make you\nresentful so that you it's hard for you\nto date today\nlet's understand how you work and what\nyour goals are and once we understand\nthose two things we can figure out a\npath to help you achieve them\nthat's what coaching is about that's why\ni fell in love with it i went to my\nfirst coaching conference and i was like\nthis is actually amazing\nwhat i realized and this is where i got\nyou know one of my supervisors once told\nme yeah i see what you're doing is\nreally valuable to people but it's not\ntherapy\nand i got super confused by that and\nwhat i realized is what i do was heavily\ninformed by like my training as a monk\nwhich is helping people find happiness\nnot curing depression those are two\nseparate things\nand so if it comes to goal achievement\nand if it comes to understanding your\nresentment if it comes to a place where\nyou need to offload those emotions and\nhave a coach sort of be like yeah that\nreally sucks that this person doesn't\ntext you back i imagine you must feel\nreally resentful what are you gonna do\nabout it tomorrow\nlet's manage those emotions here and\nsend you back in\nwith a little bit of hope\nlike dismantle that sumscard a little\nbit let's process it here and then let's\nfigure out a plan for you to start\ndating again\nthat's why we started this coaching\nprogram because the truth of the matter\nis that it's not i mean for those of\ny'all that are interested in like\ntreatment right so if you've got\ni mean if you're in a relationship and\nyou need marriage counseling like don't\ncome to a coach like go to a lmft\nif you've got major depressive disorder\nor bipolar disorder go see a\npsychiatrist or a therapist\nyou know if you've got\nyou know really bad social anxiety or\ngeneralization anxiety disorder or panic\nattacks like go see a therapist\nbut if you're someone who's trying to\nfigure out how to navigate this world\nand no one taught you the rules\nand you need some amount of guidance and\nfacilitation\nand it's not that the coaches have all\nthe answers like so it's not what\nthey're really what they have is a\nmethodology to help you understand what\nare your values what are your\nmotivations what are your roadblocks\nwhat are your goals\nand like dismantling those roadblocks\nand starting to make forward progress\nthat's what coaching is about\nand there's a reason why for the first\ntime in 18 months we actually have\ncoaching spots\nand like we're we're\nyou know working with coaches as fast as\nwe can we're trying to like get them\nready to help you all as fast as we can\nprogram's been full for 18 months we\nfinally have about 100 spots\nthat's because we're just like\nwe in in 2022 in the last year\nwe've\ntaught\nas many coaches as we have in the 18\nmonths before that or more\nand like that's and the reason is\nbecause\nthis is what people need\nand this is what we presented at the\namerican psychiatric association\nis peer support services actually help\npeople\nthat you can actually improve depression\nand anxiety without treating depression\nand anxiety but wait does that make it a\nmedical treatment i don't know if you're\nobese and that's a medical diagnosis or\nyou have type 2 diabetes and that's a\nmedical diagnosis and you go to a\npersonal trainer and you start\nexercising and you lose weight and your\ninsulin resistance improves does that\nmean that a personal trainer is\npracticing medicine\nyou can get clinical improvements\nwithout clinical interventions\nand the way that our coaching program\nhelps people with their depression and\nanxiety is not by treating depression\nand anxiety it's by helping them find a\nromantic partner it's by helping them\nget a job it's by helping them set\nboundaries on other people\nhow do i set and enforce boundaries\nthose are the kinds of skills that we\nteach in our parent coaching program\nthat's what we do\nhow do you set effective boundaries on a\nkid who's addicted to video games kids\nare terrified\nthey're like oh my god dr k is going to\nquit my parents\nwith the ability to control me no it's\nnot really what we do we sort of what we\ndo but we explain to the parents is like\nif you want to set limits on video game\naddiction you can't have your kid\nworking against you\nthey've got to be on your team for y'all\nare fighting against an addiction\nthere's no way you can win against an\naddiction if the person who's addicted\nis not trying to win\nimpossible\nso our parent coaching program is about\nhelping parents understand their kids\nhow can you get them on your team and\nhow can both y'all work towards\nsomething together in terms of like\npersonal coaching it's like you know for\nmost of y'all\nit's about unders same thing it's like\nunderstanding yourself and even in that\nway it's like all the self-sabotage that\nyou do why the hell do you do that where\ndoes that come from instead of just\nassuming that you're incompetent or lazy\nwhy don't you try to understand it for\nonce\nwhy don't you try to like understand\nlike why you do this to yourself and\nwhat needs you meet by sabotaging\nyourself\nand it works\nright like that's the at end of the day\nlike it works so hopefully we'll have a\npublished study soon\nright so we're in the process of of\nsubmitting for publication so we've done\nour data analysis and things like that\nour outcomes are good like that's why we\ndo it\nit's not like oh dr k just had a great\nidea it must be successful that's not\nhow it works by the way we've revised\nour coach curriculum six times in two\nyears\nthat's why we succeed and there's\nanother thing that i'm really really\nhappy about which is something that i\nnoticed is missing from our profession\nso for those of you all that are\ntherapists hopefully this will make\nsense\nso if a patient doesn't show up\nlet's say you have an initial\nappointment with a patient\nand they don't show up or they they show\nup for the first appointment never come\nback\nwhy didn't they come\nback so as a profession\nif someone doesn't show up they don't\nshow up and there's no follow-up\nright so someone's saying so iconic\nwhale is saying\nadd\naaron bb2 is saying social anxiety why\ndid they not show up\nbecause it wasn't a one and i'm fixed\nthey just forgot they don't care they're\nall kind that's my point there's all\nkinds of reasons so here's the thing if\ni'm a therapist\nand someone doesn't show up how do i fix\nthat\nhow do i improve it\nright and one i see this post a lot on\nthe psychotherapy subreddit where people\nare like\noh i'm so frustrated because\nwe've been working on this thing for six\nmonths and this person came in and told\nme that their coach really helped them\nwith this\nand what do you think happens on the\npsychotherapy subreddit\npeople like oh no you should give\nyourself a pat on the back\nlike you've really been doing the work\nand like the client just doesn't\nunderstand it\nhold on a second\nso here's the biggest problem with with\nthe field of therapy right now not the\nbiggest problem one of the things that's\nreally missing in the field of therapy\nis we don't have good feedback\nand so we don't actually learn from our\nmistakes what happens is we get ghosted\nby patients\nand we don't understand what happens\nso part of the reason that our coaching\nprogram is successful part of the reason\nwe've had six curriculum changes over\nthe course of two years\nis because we collect feedback\nand y'all tell us\nthere's a post the other day on our\nsubreddit where someone was like\nmy coach doesn't know my name is this\nnormal and we're like no it's not please\ntell us what on earth is going on\nright there are avenues for feedback\nthere's like post session feedback we\nmeasure outcomes we know which coaches\nare good which coaches are doing poorly\nwe check in with them we also like\nwe'll do positive deviant studies\non our coaching program which is like\nreally cool\nno it's not fired right it's like\nunderstanding what's going on how did\nthis client get this impression do you\nactually know their name because it\ncould be the client right because\nsometimes people post stuff on the\ninternet and they're complaining about\nthings i don't know if you all have seen\nlike you know nasty yelp reviews where\nit's like these people never their\nservice is terrible\nthey wouldn't give me you know i was\nwaiting for an hour and then\ni didn't even i walked out after an hour\nand it's like yeah you showed up at 9 45\nthe kitchen closes at 9 30.\nand we told you that we have no food\nlike you're not going to eat here and\nthen you got upset and then you left\nright so it's like\nthat's where like this this process\nneeds to be investigated and that's what\ni'm really happy about is that when we\nactually collect feedback and we iterate\non it our coaching program improves\nso anyway if you all are interested in\nthis kind of stuff in terms of goal\nsetting motivation trying to understand\nlike what holds you back then by all\nmeans sign up because we've worked\nreally we've been trying really hard to\nkeep up with demand and and finally\nwe've got spots available so i know a\nlot of y'all have been waiting for a\nwhile so definitely sign up\nyou"
