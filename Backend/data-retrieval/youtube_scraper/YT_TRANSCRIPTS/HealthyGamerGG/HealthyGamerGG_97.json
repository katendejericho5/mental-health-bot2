do this\nokay so we got to do this hold on\nDiscord there we go okay so how you\ndoing man I'm doing good how are you\ndoing I'm doing good dude oh my God\nMarket Basket t-shirt yeah you know\nMarket Basket hell yeah dude I love\nMarket Basket I guess it's true you you\nwent to Harvard your east coast East\nCoast but Market Basket was also like in\nTexas like East Texas no wrong\nyeah we had a I hate to call you out\nyou're wrong it's not it yeah no 13\nthere's only 13 locations that spread\nacross the east coast in Market\nBasket hold on a second we can look this\nup I would love to know something you\ndon't know that would make me very happy\nokay Market Basket Jamie keep pull this\nup okay so what I want you to do is go\nto\nEast go to East\nuh go to East Texas okay wait wait I\nfound it I found it I found it Market\nBasket New England and then you know how\nWikipedia has that disambiguation thing\nat the top for Louisiana and Texas Chain\nsee Market Basket Louisiana and Texas\nthere we go totally separate\ncompanies but that's the same\nlogo it's similar you are not wrong they\nboth decided to use red font but they're\nnot the same they're not the same\nthey're not the same this is staggering\nbut they call themselves Market\nBasket uh yeah yeah they're both Market\nBasket uh but but the Texan one was\nfounded in 1962 and the uh New Hampshire\nstarted one was\n1917 wow that's fascinating I didn't\nrealize it was a different Market Basket\nGod I can teach you these things if we\ntalk you know so I I was I was thinking\nabout this actually recently so I'm I'm\nvery curious\nabout your ability to learn new\nthings and your so a lot of people when\nthey like try to learn new things they\nlack confidence in learning the new\nthings um so been there yeah I'm curious\nbecause it doesn't seem that way when\nbecause like like a big part of what you\ndo is like do new stuff like that's part\nof what you do like that's what make\nlike I I enjoy watching you because it's\nnot going to be the same game every\nsingle day it's going to be something\nnew something interesting something\nInnovative but the other interesting\nthing is you appear to not suck at all\nof those things so what I'm super appear\nto okay yeah yeah I'm not saying that\nyou you you don't suck you may suck sure\nso I'm super curious about your journey\nwe can talk about whatever you want to\nbut I I was personally curious about\nyour journey of being comfortable with\nthings that you suck at okay you know\nwho enlightened me on this subject who\nuh a one Gotham chess okay you know you\nknow Levy yeah I mean I I don't know him\nbut I'm familiar with Gotham chess I\nreally like his content before he was a\nvery uh successful I'll turn myself down\na bit before he was a very successful uh\nchess teacher or excuse me before he's a\nvery successful YouTuber he was a\nsuccessful chess teacher and uh one of\nthe things that he's told us is like hey\nwhen you teach a child how to play chess\nthere's so so much like better as\nLearners cuz they don't get embarrassed\nabout what they are learning they just\nlearn the thing and if they mess up they\ndon't care they'll just like throw ideas\nout but then when an adult attempts to\nlearn chess they get real like shameful\nand they're like I don't know this is\nlike a stupid idea but I feel like maybe\nyou should go D4 here and they're like\nthey don't want to fail uh and so I\nthink they throw out less ideas I do\nthis I'll give you an example which one\nthis shameful thing okay you\nfeel oh sometime like okay I I do uh\nJapanese lessons Okay because I'm doing\na motorcycle trip across Japan with uh\nwith Michael\nReeves uh and I want to like know\nJapanese because I'm going to be in\nmiddle of nowhere Japan with Michael\nReeves and he doesn't know Japanese that\nwell I don't know Japanese and uh and so\nthese Japanese lessons they've been\ngoing great but recently like I haven't\nbeen keeping up as much so my vocabs\nlike a little shoddy so I have open AI\nchat GPT on the side and if there's a\nword that I have to translate like a\nvocab board and I should know it because\nhe taught it to me before I type it\nin is that some way of learning though I\nthink so but I think ultimately like\nthere's a teacher right there who I\ncould just be like hey wait how do you\nsay hot again and he'd be like atui but\ninstead I'm throwing that in chat\nGPT and chat GPT tells me and how do you\nsay cold\nbuddy that's above my pay grade that is\nabove my pay grade I could not even wait\nactually I can tell you uh I think it is\nuh is it Sami do we get this\nright uh yes Samui uh is if I remember\ncorrectly it is amui yes did you ask\nchaty\nPT right then no I couldn't get there\nfast enough so I read chat nice that's\nsuper cool dude so so but but has\nsomething changed in terms of your\nshamefulness like do you feel cuz like\nyou seem like really good at trying new\nstuff so I'm curious so you said Gotham\nchess taught you this but like so that\nprinciple is one thing but then do\nyou how do you have you applied it\ndifferently\nnow I I mean I think I attempt to do\nthat right like I think I but is like a\nconstant battle because I can feel the\ndesire to like you know not want to\nadmit I don't know a bunch of and\nnot want to like start from ground zero\nand not want to be a dumb adult but like\nI am a dumb adult so like I feel like I\nit's like a like I fully know the lesson\nbut applying it is a little\nharder so I'm trying to apply it in most\ncases and like even this chat GPT\nexample I did it in one lesson and then\nI went on stream and I said I did it and\nthen I let everyone make fun of me and\nnow I probably won't do it next lesson\nuh I'll just talk to my teacher do you\ndo that a lot where you own up to or\npublicly acknowledge things that you\nfind internally\nshameful maybe not necessarily like\ninternally shameful but like things in\ngeneral oh hello gamer I'm in call right\nnow um yeah I think\nso I think so I think I think owning up\nmakes it feel uh better so and was that\nhave you always been able to do that\nI not I didn't used to no no I think my\nmom convinced me it was a better idea\nthan the alternative which is like not\nowning up to it uh and how did that\nconvincing go what convinced\nyou so I guess like okay here's the\nexample it was I I was late to art class\nin I want to say like High School uh uh\nand and I just like it was after lunch I\nwas around the locker rooms and\nthen I got late and then the the the\nteacher was like Hey you have to have\nyour parents signed that you were late\nto our class and then like I kind of\nblanked on it whatever I forged my\nmother's signature nice apparently not\nas good as I thought uh I wasn't you\nknow I wasn't I wasn't leard Caprio and\ncatch me if you can uh but uh what ended\nup happening is they found out like I\nsent it to the school and then they like\nI guess had a version of my mom's\nsignature and they went side by side and\nthey were like okay and then they called\nmy mom in and then they called me into\nthe principal's office while I was at\nschool I didn't know my mom was there\nand then they like made me own up anyway\nthe whole entire thing sucked ended up\ngetting like a Saturday detention for a\nfew hours uh but after that my mom was\nlike Hey if you just tell me like I will\nbe more understanding than like these\nrandom people and strangers and so you\nshould just like even if you forged it\njust be like hey I'm forging your\nsignature and then like at least I know\nand I was like okay I can do that yall\ndo\nthat yeah that's cool so it sounds like\nshe really had your back and yeah you\nknow I I always thought that the the\nbest way to bypass that scenario is to\nalways Forge your parent signature from\nday one right so that there's\nconsistency and you get better at it\nyeah and and then there's nothing to\ncompare to because because you're always\nforging their their signature well I did\ncontinue to do it I would just tell my\nmom after yeah that's and I got and I\ngot better I did like a practice session\nwith her yeah yeah I was like okay the\nP's okay that's\ninteresting yeah that's super cool yeah\nbecause I I I I think you know it's it's\ninteresting because multiple people have\ntold me that they appreciate your\nconfidence and so I was like multiply\ntold you about my confidence yes oh yes\nwow okay and and so it I was kind of\ncurious because like now I'm talking to\nyou and I'm like okay where does where\ndoes Ludwig's confidence come from and I\nwas curious what you had to say about\nthat but because I think we can all\nlearn something not to put you on the\nspot if you have nothing else to say\nthat's okay we just talk about whatever\nno I I we talked about this last time I\nthink confidence comes from I I\nbelieve I mean I think a lot of my\nconfidence comes\nfrom like my\nuh internal belief that\nlike everything will work out so it's\nlike you can kind of do everything\nblindly confidently and it's better to\ndo things maybe confidently in wrong\nbecause even if you do a wrong decision\nit'll work\nout and do you have a sense of and we\nmay have talked about this I may just\nhave forgotten where that sense that\nthings will work out like where where do\nyou get that have you always had\nthat uh well cuz like they have to cuz\nlike Al like it just always does cuz\nlike The World Keeps spinning you know\nlike what what do you what does not work\nout really really mean and it's like\nokay well it wasn't an ideal situation\nto be in it was it was like potentially\ndevastating financially emotionally\nmentally whatever but like Sun's going\nto go down Sun's going to come up you\nhave to live the next day and the next\nday and the next day and the next day\nand the next day and the next year so\nlike I think\neventually the results will work out\num and that's yeah I just believe that\nokay which is why I'm cool with like you\nknow the\nwhole like my job going to and then\nme like leaving and everything failing\ncuz it's like you know I'll figure\nsomething else out and that'll be fine\nand I can just enjoy that what do you\nmean your job going to and you\nleaving and you failing is that is that\nbefore you became a content creator are\nwe talking about did I miss something no\nthat's now that's now that's now but\nthat's why I feel did something\nhappen in my job yeah no no but like I\nit will go to\nokay one\nday I'm not going to be here at you know\n52 probably entertaining uh 18 to 24\nyear olds I don't think\nso and I don't think 50-year-olds are\ngoing to be watching uh YouTube live\nstreams I'm assuming yeah okay okay so\nyou're you're just assuming that things\nare going to fall apart at some point M\nand but but it also sounds like falling\napart doesn't really sound like falling\napart like things will end but there's\nlike a connotation with falling apart\nthat you don't really lean into too\nmuch yeah yeah I mean like I don't know\nhow it'll end it could end very\ngracefully and beautifully it it could\nalso be a you know\nmy one terabyte hard drive of me saying\nslurs that gets leaked whatever it is\nless gracefully but I think either\nresults it would work\nout and what do you mean by\nworkout what is your definition of\nworkout you know regroup myself and deal\nwith a new surrounding situation what's\nthat called that treadmill somebody\na treadmill hedonistic treadmill is that\nthe one that's one of the treadmills is\nthat a treadmill where you can adapt to\nwhere your life currently is uh no\nthat's a completely different\ntreadmill\ntreadmill I I I don't know which\ntreadmill you're talking about but the\nheatness of treadmill is like when you\nengage in a dopam energic activity the\njoy that you get is\ntemporary and you basically have to keep\nclimbing right so like one cookie will\nnot like make me happy for the rest of\nmy life I need to eat another cookie and\nanother cookie and another cookie does\nit work in\nReverse what uh first Define what you\nmean by reverse and now now get fun I\nlove talking to you man let's say like\nlet's say like okay so so you're saying\nwhen you get a huge dopamine rush you\ncatch up to it what if you have a huge\ndopamine fall like you had a big um\nbreakup or lost your job or something\nwhat do you think I think\nyeah how\nso uh I don't know how it works in the\ntreadmill analogy but I feel like you\nknow You' maybe like eat fall in\nyour face because it goes slow so fast\nbut then you'd have to get back up on\nthe treadmill and start walking again\nyeah so I I I think generally speaking\nthis is what's really crazy is that I\nthink the opposite is also true so if\nyou look at it historic I'm agreeing\nwith what you said yes so so if you look\nat it historically basically just about\nevery religious tradition Maybe like\nShinto doesn't apply but most of these\nlike religious or spiritual Traditions\nwill have\nasceticism or deprivation of positive\nthings as part yeah aestheticism like\nAesthetics nope aestheticism a c e t i m\nas c e\naism SI I SM so that is like an\naesthetic is like a monk like someone\nwho doesn't engage in worldly pleasures\nso\nthey'll uh unic is different but and\nactually Unix will sometimes engage in\nthere's actually a really interesting\ncorrelation between becoming a unic and\nengaging in more sensory Pleasures so\nwe're not quite sure about this but\nmaybe when you lose your gonads okay\nyour sensitivity so first of all you're\nlike more likely to get more obese and\nthen if you look at like fat cells fat\ncells are not just storage they're\nactually like hormonally active and can\ndo things like insulin resistance and\ncravings and so historically there are a\nlot of accounts of Unix being like very\nlike hedonistic but they just like when\na blind person hears\nbetter someone with no balls starts\nfeeling better I wouldn't quite say that\nthe mechanisms are the same but the\nanalogy is a very good one so yeah so\nit's like it's like there and that\nobesity makes you more sensitive to food\nMH and so Unix will sometimes just like\nbecome really really obese um but anyway\nit's fascinating but going back to what\nyou were saying earlier so like yeah I\nmean I think that if you look at it the\nbasic problem is that any time we engage\nin a dopam energic activity we develop\ntolerance to it this is why like you\nknow the first hour that you play a\nvideo game is more fun than like the\nfourth hour that you\nplay so the interesting thing is that\nthere's something weird with our brain\nwhere if we like work a full day and\nthen we play video games for 2 hours\nthat is more fun than playing video\ngames for like 8\nhours so depriving yourself of something\nand then engaging in it or limiting your\nexposure to\nsomething then enhances the thing later\nso this is where a lot of people get\ntripped up because we have a society\nthat tries to like give us a lot of\ninstant\ngratification and the more instant\ngratification we get the less we enjoy\nit and if you want to enjoy\nthings a limited amount of deprivation\nis actually like really really good can\nI offer a counter\nyeah a lot of people are bringing up\nthat this is similar to gooning what is\ngooning God I'm going to teach you so\nmuch today I'm going to teach you so\nmuch wisdom it is kind of like lay it on\nme brother Goonies in a way uh so like\ngooning do you know about the allegory\nof the cave no\nlike the shadows and all that\nno more wisdom so basically gooning is\nlike it's like you have a goon cave and\nyou're watching some you know what\nedging is yes it's like that it's like\nthat what do you I I like a little okay\nso here here's the statements that I\nheard do you know what gooning is do you\nknow the allegory of the cave do you\nknow edging and between cave and and\nedging there was Shadows so like these\nare the four words that are been\nassembled the only reason I brought up\nthe allegory of the cave is cuz you can\noften times have a goon cave it's the\nonly relation to the allegory of the\ncave has nothing else to do with that\nstory but uh so I I pivoted away from it\nbut but yeah gooning gooning is is a\nvery popular word right now but it is\nultimately edging but there's like goon\ncommunities online and people talk about\nwhat they what they goon to and how long\nthey've been\ngooning when you say goon to is gooning\nthe same thing as\nedging I think it's more communal than\nedging cuz edging I think ultimately you\nyou still bust a low just a huge giant\nfat one and then gooning I think is more\nlike you just you just be gooning for a\nlong time right you're just gooning what\nwhat does that mean you just stay\ngooning man you just stay gooning but\nbut when you say stay gooning I still\ndon't understand what the verb gooning\nmeans like you stay edging okay so you\nso this involves\nsexual stimulation without any kind of\nyes stay goon and never bust so what how\nis that a counterargument to what we're\nsaying what were we talking about right\nbefore it we were talking\nabout\nhow depriving yourself of some pleasure\nbefore engaging in the pleasure right\nright like eating let's say like we like\neat healthy all week and then we have\nlike pizza on the weekend that pizza\nwill be more satisfying than if you eat\npizza every day I imagine a goons maxer\nwould probably really enjoy like a\nsexual relationship with another\nperson yeah so how is that a\ncounterargument oh did I say\ncounterargument yeah I meant like uh\nplus argument plus okay I was like yeah\nI mean I I think if people are and\nthere's a lot of stuff with like um\ncelibacy or baharia and and all that\ngood stuff like there's a lot of stuff\naround sexual pleasure yeah go ahead I\nremember my counterargument okay Elden\nring\nokay that is not a game that I think\nwould be fun to limit yourself to like a\ncouple hours a week or a day or may a\nday maybe but you you like you kind of\nneed to dive into the universe you know\nwhat I mean uh well said so I think it's\na good counterargument but I think Elden\nring is actually a really good argument\nfor the argument too because I think\nElden ring is very good at denial of\nreward so Elden ring itself does the job\nyes you're actually so right yeah yeah\nyeah cuz you die you die yeah yeah yeah\nright yeah it does take it away my God\nyeah so so and and I I think Elden ring\nwhat's that's what makes a truly like\ngreat game is that it is immersive right\nso you lose yourself in it but the other\nthing to kind of think about is like\nlet's talk about playing Elden ring like\nso if you you know we waited a few years\nfor Elden ring and that's what made it\nso great so if we had Elden rings every\nsingle day would stop being\nfun yeah yeah I mean there there's a\nvideo series about that I forget who\ndoes it I think iron pineapple but he\nplays like so\nmany of those games like soulsborne\nknockoff games I think they they\ndefinitely look like they're getting not\nfun if you keep yeah just Trucking\nthrough them so I I think it's but I'm\nI'm all for immersion I think immersion\nhas a different quality like to get lost\nin something is very engrossing whether\nit's like what's the last thing you got\nlost in\num let me think what is the last thing I\ngot lost in so I really liked season one\nof Tokyo Vice oh wow I read that book\nThe Jake Adin book about the uh the\njournalists so I watched the I watched\nthe show so I heard it's a great show\ntoo yeah so so someone told me it was a\ngreat show um and and that was because I\nwas on uh I was withdrawing from Shogun\nwhich is also a great show yeah and was\nmy favorite book for many years um which\nalso was something that I got lost in\nthe first time I read it the second time\nI read it and the third time I read it\num so I think those are the two most\nrecent things I also picked up DOTA\nagain recently so it's easy to get kind\nof lost in\nthat do you feel good about that\ndecision mixed feelings so generally\nspeaking I allow myself like a serious\namount of Dodo once every 3 to four\nyears is what it comes down to I\nprobably play for about 20 to 50 hours a\nyear and then once the gooning gets too\nmuch right then every 3 to four years\nI'll like play like a 100 hours of DOTA\nokay I see I see so this is your in your\nDOTA on phase and you will\neventually you know Tire yourself out\nfrom it yeah or I'll just what what\nreally h i don't Tire myself out from it\nwhat I realize so I'm I'm actually doing\nthis internally right now I will stop\nplaying Dota or instead of playing DOTA\nI will write a chapter of my next book\nand I am actually doing huh you'll do\nwork I wouldn't even call it work so\nwhat I what I'm I know it's weird so\nwhat I'm actually doing is I'm I'm\nmeasuring internally what the cost of\none hour of video games\nthis is that healthy to do because I\nthink a lot of people do this is what\nhealthy to do to measure the cost of\nsomething when you could be more\nproductive with that time like if I play\na game of valerant it's about 45 minutes\nI could be more productive with that\ntime both career-wise but like\nrelationship wise so I think the\nattitude with which you do it is very\nimportant so a lot of people will beat\nthemselves up for wasting time mhm I if\nI play like three games of valerin and i\nd rank in those games I will wish I will\nwish the sweet release I will I don't\nwant to be around anymore because I'm so\nsad that I wasted those two and a half\nhours playing that dumb game\ninstead of hanging out with my beautiful\ngirlfriend or work doing work yeah so I\nthink that that's like that's a very\nshame inducing cycle that's why we keep\ndoing it right so if you look at video\ngames what happens is they punish us and\nthen in order to deal with that negative\nemotion we have to go back to the game\nbecause it's resses our negative\nemotional\ncircuitry so I do something slightly\ndifferent which is that I ask myself on\nthis given day would I rather like if I\ndon't play for this hour I'm not\ndepriving myself or playing for four\nhours or anything like that there's no\nbeating myself up at the end it's just\nlike on this day do I want to like do I\nwant to start playing this DOTA game\nright the second or can I wait one hour\nand then start playing and I'm just\ngoing to do that and I I'm literally\ntrying to measure\nhow many so what is the like how many\nhours of DOTA do I have to give up to\nwrite a\nbook and the crazy thing is I think you\ndon't have to give up many hours like I\nthink you're if you give up 10% of the\nhours like it's crazy how much time that\nis like it it's crazy how little how\nmuch you can accomplish in a very small\nvolume of time so we're not even talking\nabout quitting gaming or cutting back by\n50% we're talking like two or three\nhours a\nweek well okay did you ever play MMOs I\nused to what' you play I played a little\nI mean I played wow when I say a little\nbit of wow that's in relation to other\npeople so I had like one or two level 60\ncharacters I did maybe two or three\nraids like endgame raids I did some like\nMolton core some Blackwing lir\nand then like so like one of the raids\nand one of the expansions feel like it's\na good amount of time in yeah um so a\ncouple hundred hours I played RuneScape\nuhhuh probably similar time\ninvestment uh and one day I was like\ndude like I'm dog at soccer I'm not\non the starting roster my grades aren't\ngood and everything I'm grinding out in\nthis RuneScape game I could just grind\nout in real life and ultimately these\nRuneScape stats even if I get a skill\nCape will not you know further the the\nstats that I can get in real life and I\nstopped playing and I never played an\nMMO ever again that's why that's what\nultimately like so when I have my DOTA\nbinges at some point so here's the cycle\nof my like like game getting lost in the\ngaming it's like let's play something\nand then it's kind of fun and then you\nlose and then you're like I'm\ntired of losing like I can actually get\nbetter at this and I can win and then\nwhat starts happening is I I start\ndeveloping like deliberate practice to\nget\nbetter and uh and then I'll start\ngetting better and it's rewarding and\nthen one day I'll wake up and I'll like\nthink to myself well hold on a second if\nI'm going to spend like deliberate\npractice and focus on getting like\ngetting better at something mhm do I\nreally want to spend like 200 hours\nimproving at\nDota or would I rather and and this is\nthe thing I mean I I write about 600\nwords an hour the average non-fiction\nbook is about 80,000 words that's so\nmany words an hour 600 words an hour\nyeah it's that's 10 words a minute\nthat's a lot of\nwords I have a 200w essay due tomorrow\nI'm\nstressed 200w essays are very hard I'm\nsaying I think Mark Twain or one of\nthese other people said if I had you I'm\nsorry for writing you such a long letter\nif I had the time it would be shorter or\nsomething like that writing in a small\namount of time is harder vomiting onto a\npage like rants on the internet like\nthat's easy to do do you find your books\nto be vomit on the\npage no but they also have to books I've\nwritten one arguably two one of them has\nnever seen the light of day um really\nyeah why because it's bad okay so I I\nwrote a book about video game addiction\nbefore I started streaming m and I tried\nto get it published and what I realized\nis like people think like oh it's like a\nwaste of time if you write a book and\ndon't get it published I think one of\nthe best things you can do in life is\nwrite a book and never get it\npublished because what I realized yeah\nso the act of writing oh yeah so I what\nI realized is part of the reason like we\ngrew so fast on Twitch is because all of\nmy thoughts had been worked through so\nnow when I open my mouth it sounds like\nI'm super competent but the reason I'm\nsuper competent is because my brain has\nthought through this stuff and I've\nalready put it on\npaper I have two big questions for you\nyeah question one goes back to the\nprevious thing if you are correct and I\nam correct that we could accomplish\nthese IRL skills if we didn't play video\ngames should we just not play video\ngames or cut back\ndrastically should is dangerous\nword I would say what do you\nwant I want it\nall what is all I want I want to succeed\nin every aspect where I'm hoping to\nsucceed in which is with my job with my\nuh relationship with you know being a\ngood son with like I I want to dunk a\nbasketball why why do you want\nsuccess why do I want a Dun of\nbasketball why do you want\nsuccess I just want the best shot at\nsuccess I don't care if I make it or\nnot that's different from what you just\nsaid well I feel like are you talking\nabout like in career or relationship or\nwhat what are you talking you said\nshould we do something and I asked what\ndo you want and then you said I want\nsuccess in every dimension of my life\nand then and then I asked about success\nagain and you're like actually I don't\nneed success I just want the best shot\nat success I think we're getting I want\nto I want to like do my best job like I\ndon't want to be the\nproblem okay so you want to do your best\njob that's different from success it's\nin fact it's the exact opposite of\nsuccess but it correlates to success it\ndoes correlate with success but it is\nnot the same thing okay right\nso you\nknow I'm trying to think of a non-\nterrible analogy there there a lot of\nthings that are very tightly correlated\nthat are the opposite like vaginal\nintercourse vaginal intercourse involves\na penis in a vagina but but there's\npregnancy involved but just because but\npregnancy and penises are two different\nthings even though they're tightly\ncorrelated that that that's the analogy\nthat I see this is the difference\nbetween not writing a book and opening\nyour mouth and writing a book and\nopening your mouth so penises and\npregnancy are very tightly correlated\nthis is what I wanted to say very\ntightly correlated but are not the same\nthing they when I came on the show that\nhe would do this they warned me he would\nbring up sex they said don't go on Dr K\nshow he'll bring up vaginas he'll bring\nup penises they warned me man well if\nyou want me to bring up penises we can\nbring up penises cuz down in Market\nBasket down in Texas not your New\nEngland in New England Market Basket\ny'all have whatever y'all have but down\nin Texas P that's right the woke took\nthose penises we got no\npenises okay but going back to your\nactual so so I think this is important\nto understand right so should we quit\nplaying video games well like that\ndepends I I don't think it's about what\nshould happen because should is someone\nelse's value system mhm trying to live\nyour life based on like what you should\nbe doing because should doesn't come\nfrom\nyou doesn't it doesn't it come from like\nthe like the preppy like you know Brown\nnoosing part of me like the The Good The\nGood the goody two shoes part of me yeah\nbut what what how does the goody two\nshoes part of you know what to\ndo uh he's done his research I guess\nhe's like asked around exactly right so\nthat's ultimately coming from somewhere\noutside of you right so that's very\ndifferent from what you want but like\nthe seedier part of me that's like let\nme sit in a dungeon and play valerant\nuntil I hit Diamond also got that from\nother people cuz like where do you where\ndo you figure out what the hell valerant\nfrom you didn't come up with that on his\nown that's a good point right so\narguably that comes from outside of you\ntoo and I wouldn't disagree with that I\nthink that that is actually true I think\non a more practical level like that's at\na deeper layer of understanding that all\ndesires come from the outside which I\nwould agree with MH so if you look at it\nlike most of the desires that you have\nor all will come from your sensory\norgans and your sensory organs like if I\nsmell a hot dog cooking then it's like\noh I want a hot dog we have like\nadvertisements right and then we want to\nplay those things so where do adverti\nhow do advertisements enter us via our\nsensory organs mhm I would still say\nthat there are subtle differences that\nare pretty important though between like\nshoulds and want so I think you can have\nan external world and you can\nwant the external world to like you and\nthen you will do the things that you\nshould do but there's still a difference\nbetween doing what you should do and the\nwant of having people like you does that\nkind of make sense they're like very\nconnected but and so I think the big\nproblem though is that a lot of times\nwhat we want and what we should do\nconflict like playing video games versus\nsomething\nelse and so I don't think that we\nshould quit playing video games I don't\nI don't think that that's effective\nbecause I think generally speaking when\nyou try to live a life of what you\nshould do two things happen\nthe first thing that happens is that\ngenerally speaking when you gratify shs\nyou don't feel\ngood and the second thing is when you\ndon't gratify shs you feel\nguilty that's true you beat yourself up\nso it's kind of like a lose lose\nsituation like I've I've worked with\npeople who have literally lived their\nwhole lives doing what they should do I\nused to be one of them yeah\nabsolutely Al goby doctor like what my\ndad was like when I was nine years old\nmy dad was like one of y'all is going to\nbe a doctor and one of y'all is going to\nbe a lawyer my grandmother ever since I\nwas can remember she was like you're\ngoing to be a great doctor one day\nyou're going to be a great doctor one\nday mhm and then like it's not it just\ndoesn't even if you succeed you're going\nto be burnt out because there's no like\ninternal satisfaction there's just\nmaking other people happy you didn't\nlike feel really happy when you became\ndo I don't know how it works but like\nthey gave the doctor Laurel on you I did\nnot feel very happy when I graduated\nfrom medical school\nno it\nwas It was kind of surprising but yeah\nthat's not how I felt I felt really\nhappy the day that I got in that was\nmedical school yeah okay what what's the\ndifference um so I mean I had applied to\nmed school for like three years in a row\nand like not gotten in so i' just gotten\nrejection after rejection after\nrejection after rejection yeah you were\ndeprived I was deprived\nabsolutely but I was no deprivation when\nyou're on the course there's just work\nyep and then when I graduated um you\nknow like I I mean there was no question\nthat I was going to graduate like I knew\nI was going to graduate because I had\nfailed anything MH and then you know\nthere's this thing called match day\nwhich is like a big day when you find\nout where you're going to do your\nresidency so residency is really when\nyou learn how to practice medicine med\nschool is about exposure to different\nconcepts and then you really learn\ndoctoring in Resident\nI watch C Anatomy okay so um you know\nthe day that I for a lot of people it's\nlike it determines their fate it's like\nwhere are you going to end up are you\ngoing to become a surgeon are you not\ngoing to become a surgeon and for me it\nwas pretty you know it was good like a\nlot of people thought I would be very\nvery very happy and I was grateful I\nfelt gratitude more than anything else\num but I you know I I matched it a\nprogram that a lot of people are very\nvery very like happy and tears and\nthings like that but I for me it was\njust I wanted to do some work at life\nand thankfully like I ended up at a\nplace that they appreciated that and\nwanted to support the work that I was\ndoing and wanted to help me grow that's\nwhat was important to me\nmhm I have another question yeah but I\ndon't know if we should pause yes let me\nget some water and then I also have to\ndo a quick like sponsorship thing so can\nyou for a yes they have like a theme\nsong uh I don't know if they have a\ntheme song but I'm gonna do this real\nquick and grab some water thank you so\nmuch for reminding me um we're gonna do\nthis okay so today's stream y'all is uh\nsponsored by 988 which is a crisis\nhelpline so we're huge fans of 988 for a\ncouple of\nreasons um you know here at HG we have a\nlot of stuff that we try to help youall\nwith in terms of your mental health but\none of the things that we really can't\ndo is help youall through a crisis and\nthe cool thing is that um the United\nStates government has created this\ncrisis helpline that anyone can use 24\nhours a day 7 days a week um you have to\nbe in the United States or the\nsurrounding territories that's where\nit's available but it's a national\nnetwork that will connect you with a\ncounselor who you can just talk to about\nanything that's kind of going on in your\nlife um they can help you through any\nkind of Crisis and it's confidential\nsupport for anyone who's in distress so\nyou can call text chat at any time and\nwhat we're really excited about is that\nthis is a service that's available to\npeople you know if you're struggling in\nsome way with anxiety whatever like it\nkind of doesn't matter any kind of\nCrisis that you've got that is mental\nhealth related is something that they\ncan help you with so we're big fans of\nhelping people with their mental health\nand if youall need help definitely reach\nout to them\num yeah so a couple of other things uh\nyou know I kind of think about this as\nlike an IRL support so like we talk\nabout like in games right you've got\nlike Support classes and non Support\nclasses and things like that we try to\nsupport youall through some stuff but\nthere's like IRL support available as\nwell so definitely check that out um\nanyway we're going to hop back in with\nlwig\nso okay oh one thing uh that I also want\nto mention before we hop back in is so\nall of their crisis help workers are\ntrained so you you'll get connected to a\na trained crisis help worker or a\ncounselor who can help you if you're\nfeeling overwhelmed anxious or just need\nsomeone to talk to so thanks a lot to\n988 for sponsoring the\nstream okay sorry about that all right\nit it really is like something that I'm\na big fan of so we're we're super\ncareful about this stuff but I think\nit's like it's it's cool that there's a\nwhole separate line which is not 911 you\nknow that is like devoted to helping\npeople who are in crisis and Europe they\ncall like four oh do they yeah there\nthey don't got 911 they got random ass\nnumbers and 911 is not random ass\nnumbers no good question it's\nnot I mean maybe it's not I don't know\nmaybe there's some there's some reason\nbehind it did you forget to get water I\ndid forget I didn't get water but maybe\nI can get some water sh water dude you\nget it shipped in you got it like that\nuh we'll see if I can okay I'll just go\nget it myself once second I'm going to\nget some incense too and then we've got\nmore questions okay sure oh there we go\nlook at that shipped in thank you so\nmuch look at that was that a bait was\nthat was what a bait I'll get the water\nmyself no I think it's just that I just\ngot\nlucky so I I I mean I think we can I\nhave more to say about the should and\nthe want stuff but if you have another\nquestion I think let's go\nthere is it wise is what wise\nwhat you have to say I think so then\nlet's hear it okay so let's like take a\nstep back so should we want to stop\nshould we stop playing video games I I\ndon't think so I think what's far more\neffective right so if we live a life of\nshoulds it's like very like in like it\nleads to burnout I've seen people just\nget burnt out because you're like living\nto like live up to some ideal that\nyou've got and it's interesting because\nwhen we actually dig into your answers\nthere are two layers to your answers one\nof them is yeah I should do all this\nstuff I want to be successful but then\nthe further we dig in I think we really\ndetect your compass which is like the\nsuccess itself is not that important\nit's like that I strive to be successful\nand I agree that the two are correlated\nbut as your chat correctly predicted\npenises and pregnancies while correlated\nare not the same different different\nright so in fact very very different so\nI think the same is true so when we get\ncaught up in success I think that we do\nget a performance hit actually we don't\nperform our best so if you look at\nstudies of people in the Flow State\npeople in the flow state are not\nconcerned with success they are fully\ndevoted to the task at\nhand during the flow State's a very\ntemporary thing right for many people\nyes are are people unlocking Flow State\nfor like\ndays yes I was I was under the\nimpression it was\nlike you have like a tournament or like\nlike a like a match you know it's often\ntimes in sports where you enter the Flow\nState or like maybe writing or something\nand then you're going crazy but then\nlike you know it goes away when you\nsleep or something like it resets yeah\nso but but let's like think about that\nfor a second right so if it unlocks in\none way there must be some kind of\nbiological mechanism that unlocks the\nFlow\nState mhm and so then the question is\nwhat do we have to do to unlock it and\ncan you just consistently do that\ncan you unlock Flow State\nyeah do you do that when you're\nwriting when I'm\nlucky what do you want to Flow State\nwhat do you mean what do I want to Flow\nState I mean like you're not going to\nFlow State like going to the bathroom\nlike you're saying you can unlock it\nbiologically at certain places oh Flow\nState in the bathroom is awesome what\nwhat are you doing being more\nefficiently like you're just on the side\nof the bowl so it doesn't sash at all\nyou were you were just one like so the\nso here's the thing like if you really\npay attention using the bathroom is one\nof the most pleasurable experiences you\ncan have right so like and I'm serious\nso like you know when you're when you're\nonce again going to deprivation when\nyou're on a long you're going to be\ntaking a motorcycle ride through Japan\nyou're really going to need to pee yeah\nand then like eventually you'll stop and\nyou'll pee and it'll be like this\nheavenly\nexperience look I've had a few pees that\ndo send shivers down my SP spine right\nso so it's interesting because we think\nabout something so mundane as\nurination but if you really pay\nattention even urination can be ex you\ncan feel ecstasy in urination I mean\nlook that's not wrong I don't I don't I\nnever thought of it through Flow State I\nI enjoy going to the bathroom because I\nhave a bedet in warm water and it feels\nnice but so I think you're getting\ncloser to flow so so flow has a couple\nof characteristics okay so what are you\nso when let's talk let's first\nunderstand what flow is so you've had\nflow when you're playing video\ngames yeah sometimes I click heads and\nit feels and I'm just not and I'm just\nclicking heads okay so when you're I\ndon't know what that means once again I\ndon't know if that's your like inv\nvalerant like if I'm an opposing team\nfive ver five I click their head with my\ncursor and then they\nexplode I'm sure that there's a gooning\njoke somewhere in there but\nnone um so so if you kind of think about\nthat well like what what are what is the\nwhat is your mind doing during those\nmoments I think it's just\nlike 100% in the thing that I'm doing\nwhich is like what I'm supposed to do in\nthe game whatever the situation is so\nare you thinking about the future\nthinking about the\npast no right are you do you have a\nsense of\nego are you thinking about yourself how\nyou'll be perceived whether you're a\ngood person whether you're you're a bad\nperson no so these are the two things if\nyou look at your life most of the\nproblem in our life is that one of these\nfour thing three things is present we're\nthinking about the future we're thinking\nabout the past or we're thinking about\nourselves in some way so these\nthree I remember a time I've reached\nflate okay I was doing a Moto GP I think\nit's what it's called like super Moto\nokay uh it was like a training school\nand on a motorcycle and you go as fast\nas possible around a course and they\ntape up your mirrors and all this and\nyou you know you take these bends really\nfast you're going like 100 miles an hour\nscary\nso basically like after learning how to\ndo it like day two of doing it there was\nlike a few runs where I'm just like\ndoing what I'm supposed to do it felt\ngreat hold on a second because that's\nbeautiful right so you said after a few\ndays what was happening in your mind for\nthe first couple of\ndays m\nyou know comparisons to how I'm doing\nversus how other people are doing that's\nego or you know fear of like what if I\nfall like can I actually commit to this\nokay hold on a second so so what if I\nfall so is your mind in the past present\nor future in that moment future 100%\nMH\nuh you know I think those are the main\ntwo yeah so so I think that's that's\nlike spoton right so when we remove the\nthose two elements of mental functioning\nwe move closer to flow so the third\ndimension of flow that we haven't really\nso one is you have to be in the present\nyou can't be focused on the future or\nthe past second thing is that ego can't\nbe present so there's even this\nexperience of like losing yourself in\nthe thing okay um and and I still\nremember like I was working with a\nparticular Esports professional who they\nit's kind of a sad story but they were\nthey were ahead\num in a particular tournament and then\nthey they' not won a tournament at that\nat that point in their career um and so\nit was really interesting they were\nplaying really well because we had\nworked really hard on like don't think\nabout winning just play the game and\nthen like this Tipping Point happened\nwhere like they realized like oh\nlike I'm about to win my first\ntournament and then they started\nthrowing this happens all the time in\nSmash say more\nuh well in Smash there's like people who\nW won tournaments MH and there's not\nthat many people who have won major\ntournaments and when somebody is like up\non them you know like in a best of five\nthey're up two games and they should\nclose it out they start to think like oh\nmy God what if I beat this person you\nknow like what will that mean like this\nwill be my biggest win ever you know and\nthen maybe they lose game one they're\nlike oh my God what if I lose this what\nif I get reverse three OED and and then\nlike I feel like they try to reset by\ngame five then it's too late yeah well\nsaid right so it's all about what goes\non in your mind so when you're not\nthinking about winning or losing is when\nyou play your best game mhm so that\nthose are the two things the third thing\nthat Flo usually needs people will say\narousal so if a task is too easy then\nwe'll be bored if it's too hard we'll be\noverwhelmed so there's this state of\nsomething called use stress EU s r\nSS it's the opposite of dis so you know\nd means bad EU means good you so we need\na certain level of like\narousal like but really if you look at\nit so a lot of the flow researchers\nthink that okay so you need to be\nchallenged in some way but if you look\nat it the effect in your brain of\nchallenge is one pointedness of the\nmind so if we're overwhelmed then we're\nthinking about a lot of different things\nI can't win what if this happens what if\nthis happens what if this happens what\nif this happens if it's too easy then my\nmind is not focused on it that I'm kind\nof AFK I'm thinking about this thinking\nabout that so then we we're not going to\nachieve flow so you don't technically\nneed arousal so this is where flow gets\na little bit tricky with pissing because\nthere's usually not arousal with\nurination MH what there is but if you\ncan urinate in a one-pointed manner then\nyou'll attain some degree of flow or\neven ecstasy which is what we tend to\nfind when people are on long trips\nbecause for those few moments you're\nlike I need to pee I need to pee I need\nto pee and then when you start\npeeing your mind is like fully in that\nmoment and it feels amazing cuz you're\nonly peeing and you're doing nothing\nelse and you're doing nothing else\nthere's no ego you're not comparing\nyourself into the St the stall next door\nyou know you're not none of that there's\nnot what comes next what comes and then\nbefore that oh my God where's the next\nbathroom where's the next bathroom can I\nmake it can I make it can can I make it\nmy mind is stuck in the future and\nthere's lots of\nsuffering so flow state is is very\ndoable and it requires basically three\nthings mind in the present absence of\nego and\none-pointedness and one-pointedness is\nattached to also\narousal yes so arousal is an external\nway of inducing one-pointedness copy\nso you say you shouldn't Live Life by\nshs\nyes what should you live life\nby that's a great\nquestion let me think if I have an\nanswer um I guess my best answer would\nbe you should live a life by\nunderstanding so like the way you should\nlive life is by understanding it's like\nhow should you play a game like the most\nimportant thing to playing a game\ncorrectly is understanding the game then\nyou can do whatever you want to right\nlike once you understand the basics of\nlike how to head shot what the different\ncharacters are it's like when someone\nasks you like okay so i' I've maybe\nplayed valerant once which character\nshould I play in valerent\nlwig whoever you feel most comfortable\nwith okay right so I would say the same\nthing about life so then the question\nbecomes what are you comfortable with\nbut the main thing about valerant but\nthat's just when you that's just when\nyou\nlearn what do you\nmean like that's just when you're\nlearning right isn't it different when\nyou know how to\nplay you tell me so now if I were to ask\nyou let's say let's say that you do play\nvalerant right so how should you play\nvalerant how do you play\nvalerant dope\nlike play I play\nElectric\nokay right and so why do you play\nElectric\njust because like I I play Above like my\nskill level I think okay yeah so why is\nit that you play Electric above your\nskill level what is it about electric h\nI mean I think ultimately the things\nthat feel the coolest is when I flick\nand shoot somebody's\nhead so I try to do that but then also\nmy desire to win is\nParamount so I think there's a couple of\nreally important things here so I think\nyour decision to play electric doesn't\nhave to do with the game it has to do\nwith alignment with\nyourself so when you find something in\nthe game that aligns with something so\nyou're like a at what rank are you\nPlatinum too oh damn plat son nice I\nshould be Diamond I should be Diamond go\nahead so like here you are Platinum 2o\nright and that's because you\nyou're electric spammer so you're\nhonestly probably somewhere around what\nis it gold is below that no gold gold is\nyeah gold is below that probably I'm\nprobably Diamond but I am in plate yet\nokay okay right right so so I think that\nlife should be played the same way so\nshould it should be played in alignment\nwith yourself mhm so you can you if\nsomeone asks you okay you should play\nthis or you should play this character\nyou should play this character but the\nreal way to live life is primarily\nthrough understanding so once you\nunderstand what the game of life is what\nthe rules are how to cultivate a flow\nState how to be happy how to be\nsuccessful and then you play in harmony\nwith those principles then life will be\nlike fruitful and\neasy so I think that's I think\nunderstanding is like the main goal not\nlike adherence to a particular morality\nor Dogma or strategy just understand the\nGame of\nLife me and you have problems\nokay and maybe you don't have this\nproblem but I feel like you might okay\nyou said you know what was great was\nwriting a whole book and not releasing\nit and then streaming and then talking\nabout the stuff I thought\nout but now you're already\nstreaming and you don't\nget the time to write a whole book and\nthen come back with those\nthoughts and so aren't you ultimately\nthen just repeating regurgitating the\nsame thoughts that you've already said\nand like when can you come up with new\nideas to express them where do you get\nthe idea that I don't have time to uh\nwrite a new book and don't get new\nthoughts do you yeah hold on a\nsecond you got a new book coming\nyou in a damn\nBuck this guy is\ncrazy\nso guys today we're GNA talk\nabout um\ngooning\nuh basically\noh so I'm a sucker for p paper because I\nfind it otherwise there's too much eye\nstrain so here is my miscellaneous psych\nreading\nfolder so today I\nread this paper is called do females use\nindirect aggression is uh is an\nintersexual competition\nstrategy do they oh yeah it's F do the\nresearch on this is fascinating so um\nthis is a actually maybe I can screen\nshare this let me just screen share this\nhow are you going to screen share paper\nI I'm going to screen share the PDF that\nI printed which would have been way\nbetter but I mean there's this idea that\nI you know you don't read no I mean like\nI I write so much like I I've written\ntext wise I've written\nprobably 10 or 11 books in the last if\nyou just do look at word counts I've\nwritten 10 or 11 books in the last four\nyears so you're writing a bunch you're\nstill reading a bunch you're still\nlearning a bunch AB you're able to\nsay new stuff new\nideas so you don't have the same problem\nI do then what's your problem my problem\nis that I stream and streaming is kind\nof like condensing somebody's life\nexperiences and then them you know\nshowing off that through their\npersonality through some vehicle whether\nit's like a story of their life or like\nplaying a video game and showing off\nthat personality or\nwhatever uh but I feel like because I\nstream all the time I've run into to\nthis problem where like I shared the\nfirst 23 years of my life not streaming\nyou know which are very interesting\nyears in my you know and or at least I\nthink so uh and I don't have like\nanother 23 years I get to live that I\ncan now\nshare yeah no I I I think that's huge so\nso like I think that's a huge problem\nright so when you start streaming you\nhave a bank of stuff MH and you can dip\ninto your bank so the thing for me is\nthat what we found is that each video I\nmake gets harder and harder and harder\nbecause I started out with a large Bank\nof stuff so I started\nstreaming nine years after seeing my\nfirst\npatient and I started\nstreaming after seeing the majority of\npatients that I will ever see in my life\nlike I will I saw probably 80 to 90 in\nresidency is crazy especially the place\nthat I was at like it's like one of\nthese places that's called a rigorous\nprogram so what rigorous means is that\nyou're working a lot and you see like in\none day I'll see like 30\npatients and if you're like on call or\nsomething like that so you you just see\na lot of patients and then if you're a\npsychiatrist you'll see maybe 30\npatients a week but in like one day\nyou'll see like 30 patients so so I\nstarted off with a big bank and this is\nwhat's kind of confusing I think a lot\nof like viewers don't understand this is\nlike the longer you do content creator\nsure you get you get better at certain\nthings but then some things become\nincreasingly difficult so now for\nexample for like you know each uh\nlecture I prepare will take me six or\neight hours of effort so I'll read about\n100 to 200 pages of scientific\nliterature per lecture usually and\nbefore when you had the bank is it just\noff the Dome or off the Dome and I still\nincorporate a lot off the dome but it's\nlike I hadn't T you know and so now it's\nlike you I'm I'm learning super cool\nstuff like I learned some fascinating\nstuff so I'm I'm reading a lot about uh\nfemale sociopathy right now so I think\nwe don't really realize so there was a\nreally interesting study that came out\nso if you look at sociopathy or\nantisocial personality disorder men are\nabout two to three times as likely to be\ndiagnosed as sociopaths than women and\nso the question is like why is it that\nmen are actually more sociopathic than\nwomen it turns out that recent research\nsuggests that we have gender-based\nconstructs of mental illness\nso women are more likely to be diagnosed\nwith anxiety because our definition of\nanxiety was developed more by looking at\nwomen and anxiety manifests differently\nin men sociopathy manifests is physical\naggression in men but does not manifest\nhis physical aggression in women women\nuse something called indirect aggression\nway more than men relatively but even\nmore men will use indirect aggression\nthan women and it gets complicated but\nand so indirect aggression is like and\nthis was actually inspired by a woman in\nour community who posted about being a\nwoman being bullied by other women and I\nrealize like this is a huge problem and\nlike no one talks about woman-on-woman\nbullying doof and and women talk about\nit it happens a lot it happens so much\nright but we don't talk about it\npublicly because if you make a statement\nlike oh women are aggressive in these\nways the manosphere will eat that up and\nthey'll say oh women are all bad and all\nthis kind of stuff so I think that\nthere's a hesitance to talk about female\naggression and the real pity here is\nthat women are much more likely to be\nbullied by other women I also think\nwomen are good at it they are good at it\nso like you know you call them out on it\nlike they're kind of like Sly so it's\nlike no no no so so this I mean I can\nread you sentences from this this is\ncrazy like we can read sentences from\nthese papers where the way that they\npractice aggression is with like\nplausible deniability so they they don't\ndo anything overtly bad so the victim\ncannot say you are hurting me the victim\ncan never blame the like that that's\nlike their patter I mean there there's\nmeta anal meta analytic studies about\nthis stuff of like female patterns of\nbullying mhm and so a lot of it is\nindirect aggression a lot of it is\nthings like\nostracization so they're not going to\nsay anything they're not going to attack\nyou but they just will never invite you\nanywhere mhm often times they will um\nsay bad things behind your back right\nand so they'll like sort of like lower\nyour your status and things like that\nthere's a lot of other really\ninteresting stuff in the research like\npeople assume that pretty girls are\nbullies but there's a lot of research\nthat shows that being a pretty girl\nmakes you more likely to be a\nTarget um so both can be both Target and\nBully it's it can be both so some\nstudies show that actually like being an\nattractive woman\ncan make you a target of bullying which\nonce again we don't allow people to say\nright so if you're an attractive woman\nor a privileged woman or a privileged\nman we don't allow you to have negative\nexperiences because you're privileged in\nsome way which in and of itself\nis you know it's kind an interesting\nform of bullying that we do there's a\nlot of really\nfascinating research on this it's like\nit's and and I think the the reason I'm\ninto it is because there's a lot of\nwomen in our community I don't have a\nwhole lot of personal experience with it\nlike I've had patients who I see this a\nlot in my patients and\nfinance so it's a very hyper competitive\nenvironment people make sacrifices\npeople on each other a lot so I've\nhad patients who have gone through this\nand it can be like super nasty like\nreally bad and the worst thing about\nbeing the victim of a female bully\nespecially if you're a woman is that you\ncan't call them out on it like you can't\nsay\nlike what are you you're not attack like\nif you say like oh you're like not\ninviting me to things the person will\nyou know hit back and say like I\nforgot or they'll say like you're not\nobligated with an invite you're not\nentitled to an invite but it's\nabsolutely\naggression anyway I got off on a tangent\nwe can go off I think you know what I\nwas thinking for a second there what we\nhave the same\nroom we do it looks like you have\nsomething more on on here yeah I got a\nlittle more I got yeah a kitchen yeah\nbut like right here this shot we got the\nsame damn room going on yeah we got the\nshelves and the blue wall in the back\nyeah maybe do we both go to m Living\nSpaces I I like male living spaces look\nat us we're crazy but I I I mean\nthankfully our content person designed\nthis I I have no head for this kind of\nstuff but I also did not design this\nexcept for the Pokemon Snap machine that\nwas me\ngoing back to content creation though um\nyeah so I think it's super challenging\nbecause it's hard because you you work\nthrough your bank and then like as a\ncontent creator it's like hard to just\nlike keep making new stuff that's\nactually I think part part of what\npeople appreciate about you and like\nother other people have told me that you\nknow they're impressed with how good you\nare I can't say\nwhy tell me I want the ego hit I I\nbelieve that I can say myself okay I I'm\nimpressed with you I'll take it yeah I\nthink it's cool like you know you you\nwere telling me about the chess boxing\nthing mhm like that's super cool that\nwas cool you know so what's the solution\ndo I take a year\noff uh so content creators can't afford\nto take a year off we both know this I\ndon't even know if you can afford to\ntake a day off take days\noff okay I I don't but um so what but I\nI think you're doing something really\ngreat so I think like this I I think\nit's about creating new\nexperiences so I think this like\nmotorcycle journey in Japan sounds\nabsolutely fantastic that's going to add\nstuff to your bucket to share with the\nworld I think another awesome adaptation\num and I think you probably do this\nwhether intentionally or not is I think\nyou share or create experiences with\nyour\naudience so it's not that you have to\nhave a bank to access but hey we are\ngoing to do something together yeah that\nstill counts what do you mean well like\nit's still a new experience for the\naudience even if we're experiencing it\ntogether right so I think that's like so\nyou have a bank right and you've eaten\nthrough your bank so now where do the\nnew things come from so in my case I I\nhave an awesome we have an awesome\nresearch team and like the research team\nI'll be like hey I want to talk about\nthis I want to talk about this and\nthey'll go and find like a bunch of like\ncool papers like one is super cool like\nwe were learning about anger and\naggression I learned something really\nfascinating so if you're feeling angry\nmhm and you squeeze your right hand so\nyou know like when we feel angry we\nclench our fists like Arthur right and\nif we if you clench your right hand it\nactivates the part of your brain that\nleads to aggression and if you clench\nyour left hand it activates the part of\nyour brain that leads to restraint if\nyou're a lefty is it the\nsame\nprobably probably although there haven't\nbeen studied so the really thing is this\nis a causal study so they actually had\npeople do this and so like there's all\nkinds of like cool stuff about like\nrestraining yourself and we clench our\nfists we are both getting ready to fight\nand restraining ourselves but there's\nlike this most of these brain scan\nstudies are like correlational where we\ndon't really know what's going on but in\nthis one study they actually had people\ndo this where they like clench your left\nhand it'll like restrain your aggression\njust cool stuff that you can come up\nwith anyway um going back I slam desk\nhuh I slam desk with which\nhand right hand there you go son of a\nall right next time what you just do\nwhat did you just do right hand yeah you\ngot see see it's it's it doesn't feel\nthe same you you see that no it hurt way\nless I'm not as good at it right it's\nit's interesting so like left hand leads\nto and if you guys want a citation we\ncan pull it up at the end of the stream\nbut yeah clenching your fist ah\nI don't know if this kind of makes sense\nbut like even when I think about\nhypothetical aggression I use my left\nhand I'll get you Batman MH and when I\nthink about real aggression I use my\nright\nhand when I'm actually angry I do this\nmy hand's so weak I have a question for\nyou yeah you said you don't take a day\noff\nyeah you have a lot of\nresponsibility I think so I mean I think\nso I'm not saying that as a\nquestion I I have a lot how many how\nmany people are under healthy gamer is\nit known as a public uh probably around\n[Music]\n170 it's a lot of people\nyeah thankfully that's not my\nresponsibility but to a degree it is\nthough no no I mean I I think that's\nwhat's nice I I I think there's an\norganization that takes care of that so\nI have my job so if you exploded\ntomorrow like combusted it'd be very sad\nwould all 170 have their job for the\nnext five years I don't know if they uh\nI think there's a good chance yes okay\nwe're we're we're trying to set things\nup that way so healthy gamer is bigger\nthan Dr K and that's what we're like\nshooting for because it is it's not you\nknow it's like there's there's you know\n100,000 people on our\nDiscord like it's bigger than me MH so I\nthink it'll it'll exist if I disappear\nso you do have still a lot of\nresponsibility I think so do you have to\ndo that does it feel\nheavy not usually so it feels tiring it\ndoesn't feel heavy so when I say I\nhaven't had a day off in four years this\nis what what my experience of it has\nbeen I've gone I've taken days off but I\nimagine this makes sense to you it's\ninteresting someone actually posted\nrecently on our subreddit is Dr K\nstreaming too much um\nso the the reason I feel like I haven't\nhad a day off this is different in\nmedicine so like in medicine like when I\ngo on vacation I sign out my pager so\nall of the work gets done by someone\nelse mhm the thing about being a content\ncreator and this is true of some jobs as\nwell is there's no one else there to do\nyour work so when I go on\nvacation the YouTube uploads\ncontinue right so all the work that I\nhave to all of\nall of the work for those two weeks that\nI'm out on vacation has to be done ahead\nof time so I actually don't get excused\nfrom work I just double up on work and\nit's like the weeks that I'm building\nthat stuff I don't I don't stop making\ncontent for that week as well does that\nmake sense MH so this is something that\nwe see a lot with content creators is\nthat the content has to\ncontinue you say it gets\ntiring sometimes I feel tired yes\ndo you think it's\nsustainable yes do you want this\nresponsibility for oh what I want is\nrelevant\nwhy because I'm not here for me would\nyou say that to a\nwoman I wouldn't say it to any other\nhuman being on the planet\noh so this is a thing that you only\napply to yourself and no one else 100%\nwho am I to what someone else what\nstandard someone else should live their\nlife up to is that\nfair of course why is that fair isn't\nthat mean to yourself what do you mean\nwhy why does everyone else get to do\nwhat they want you can't tell anyone to\ndo what they want is it fair for me to\ntell you how you should live your life\nno but like ultimately if you were\nearlier said I should leave I should not\nlead My Life by shoulds but\nunderstanding yes but like I feel like\nif I feel like you would am I crazy I\nfeel like you would if someone was like\nHey I kind of want to become a\nmotorcycle professional I feel like\nyou'd be like yeah maybe become Mot\nprofessional go for\nit but you don't allow yourself to have\nwants why is that doesn't seem chill no\nno no no no hold on hold on hold on I\nallow myself to have wants but what I\nwant in my life is irrelevant compared\nto what I believe I'm on this Earth for\nthis is a consequence of understanding\nnot\nshould do you want this\nresponsibility not\nparticularly so\nH let me think on\nthat what do you\nwant I want uh I want\n[Music]\nto I want to be a clinician again a\nfull-time clinician I want to have an\noffice where an individual person comes\ninto my office and they sit down on my\ncouch for an hour and we work together\nand then about a year from now their\nlife is better and then about two or\nevery year or so they we like exchange\none email and they just tell me how well\nthey're doing and they send me a picture\nwith of their newborn baby that's what I\nwant that's one of the things I want\nsecond thing that I want is I want a\n DOTA patch to drop third thing\nthat I want is uh I want to pull my kids\nout of school and I want to educate them\nfull-time ideally while traveling\nthose are the three things I want to\ndevelop an educational curriculum for my\nchildren but you can't do that any of\nthose I can do most of those I can do\nall of those absolutely but sorry will\nyou do those no not anytime soon but can\nI I of course I can I can shut I can\nshutter this and and open up a private\npractice tomorrow very easy but you\nwon't because your responsibility yes\ndo\nyou only continue because you hold on to\nthe hope that you will be able to do it\nno no no there's no hope think about\nHope what do you mean by hope hope means\nI hope it'll happen I can do it tomorrow\nwell you said earlier you're not going\nto do it I'm not anytime soon yes not\nanytime soon do you know exactly when uh\nI will do it when I can't not do it\nanymore you will do it when you when the\ninstrument breaks that's when I'll\nstop and if it never breaks that's fine\nthat's fine and if your kids have grown\nup and then you couldn't you that will\ndisappear yes that third one yes but\nit's not like I neglect my children\nright so so I SP no no I I'm not saying\nthat as a defensive thing what I'm\nsaying is that I have a responsibility\nto my children there is an indul level\nof responsibility which is like I want\nto teach them you know like I want to\nfocus like I mean here I am reading 200\nPE pieces of uh pages of like scientific\nliterature every two weeks for the sake\nof making a a video for the internet I\nwould love to devote that energy to my\nkids mhm but I mean they get they get a\nlot of me they get a lot a lot more of\nme than any other human beings on the\nplanet which I think is fair\nenough um they get more of me than I got\nof my dad so I think like there's\nprogress there so that's sufficient\nmhm but I mean I I real so this is you\nknow this interesting so I'll maybe this\nwill clarify things so a couple years\nago I realized I was an\nentrepreneur and then the interesting\nthing I've worked with a lot of\nentrepreneurs one of my buddies from\nresidency is like running a billion\ndollar mental health startup and and so\nyou know I was talking to him the other\nday and and we were just kind of\nreflecting on where we\nare um and and it's interesting right\nbecause there's this idea that when you\nstart a company like there are certain\nthings that you do so you get acquired\nyou get this big payday we got our first\nbuyout offer at healthy gamer 3 months\nafter we started and and we've got we\nget offers for investment and stuff like\nthat all the time we haven't taken any\nexternal money because we don't want to\nbe beholden to investors maybe that'll\nchange one day if an investor really\ngives us the opportunity\nto really accomplish something\nmeaningful in the world like then that's\na different story that makes sense but I\nrealized recently like so I I I I've\nbeen going through something of a\nmidlife crisis which is very interesting\num and uh I realized recently like why\ndo I get so even if I had the\nopportunity to do I mean I have the\nopportunity to do the three things I\ncan't make DOTA patch drop but the other\ntwo things I can do yeah but why do I\nget what I want when so many other\npeople don't get what they\nwant so when I look at my life I wasn't\nborn with Cerebral py I was born to\nprivilege I had an amazing and I don't\nmean that in terms of like I should feel\nguilty or anything what I just mean is\nthat every one of us spawns into the\nworld with a certain set of stats a\ncertain spawn point a certain set of\nadvantages you know my I I don't know\nwho to thank for this but I certainly\ndidn't do anything to deserve it I spent\nseven years starting to become a monk\nand then I\nspent 10 years becoming a psychiatrist\nin learning neuroscience and what am I\nsupposed to do with that mhm like if I\njust have this if I set up shop and I\njust make a ton of money and just sit\naround on my like is it great sure like\nthat's how how a lot of people choose to\nlive their lives that's how they choose\nto live theirs but I mean what about\neverybody like what about all the\ndegenerate Gamers what about all the\npeople who don't have access to those\nthings yeah but like you can't fix\neveryone certainly not but trying to\ncast as wide of a net of people you\ncould help as possible cuz even in your\nother world it sounds like maybe you're\nnot helping as many people but you are\nhelping people to a more personal and\nhigher degree yes like I think you would\nimprove the lives of your patients\nindividually more than you do currently\nwith healthy gamer and how it works I\nthink that is a fair statement to make\nand I think if you choose to spend your\nlife as a clinician that's awesome I\nthink it's very Noble work and I\nwouldn't you know criticize anyone for\ntaking that path I think though that\nwhat the reason I started healthy gamer\nis because I I thought that what we're\ndoing in our offices as psychiatrists\nand therapists is insufficient it's not\nworking it helps those 30 people but\nthere's huge access to Mental Health\nCare problems across the\nglobe and so what about everyone else\nwho can't afford to be in my office I\nmean half of my patients were free\nand even then there's like a line out\nthe door and I was doing financially\nfine because I you know charged the\nother half quite a bit right and and so\nbut like it's just not enough like an\narmy of therapists is not going to be\nsufficient to fix what the problem that\nI see in the world because the problem I\nsee in the world is that we don't know\nhow to live\nlife there's this YouTube short I keep\ngetting it's this super old dude I think\nhe was a clinician or a\ndoctor M physician I don't know anyway\nhe always says that he cries at the end\nof the Winnie the Pooh book okay and he\nbasically talks about how he's like 80\nor something Allan watts is that\nright uh is that guy famous should I\nhave known who he is he is somewhat\nfamous but I think it's funny that's Al\nI I'd love to hear the end of the\nanecdote well ultimately he says he\nregrets the way he's LED his life cuz\nhe's worked too much and at the end of\nwinning the Pooh Christopher Robin has\nto leave to like go to school or\nsomething and he can't play with\neverybody in the 100 Acre Woods and he\nand then when he says you know hey it'll\nbe just a a boy playing with his bear\nhere in the 100 Acre Woods forever and\nthen he cries reading\nthat do you\nwish or do you think there might be a\nday where you feel like Alan Watts when\nyou're 85 and you've worked so hard oh I\nmean this isil I uh so if Alan Watts\nfelt that way at 85 not only do I I\ndidn't used to think this but hearing\nthis story I now 99% confident that I\nwill feel the same\nway isn't that\nbad in what\nway to regret the life you've LED or at\nleast wish you'd let it\ndifferently I don't think so so what\nwhat's what's the problem with regret\nwhat is\nRegret with the like when you wish you\ndid something different what's the\nproblem I know what it is what's the\nproblem with\nit because you could have done it\nbetter what is that well tell me what\nwhat is regret not how we Define it so\npretend I'm an alien and explain to me\nwhat regret is Regret okay regret would\nbe like Mr alien it' be like okay you\nyou\nhave you have a result of a world that\nyou were living in and you wish you\nchanged you wish you had a different\nresult and you know probably in that\nsituation what you could have done\ndifferently to achieve the different\nresult okay so a regret is a wish mhm\nthat is what it is right yes what is a\nwish like Genie Magic lamp like like\nyour like hoping something will happen\nOkay so it's a wish is an unfulfilled\ndesire okay right yeah sure so it's an\nwhat is Regret regret is an unfulfilled\ndesire that's it but okay but future\nregret if you're saying hey I'm going to\nfeel this\nregret just means it's action you could\ntake now to to then lead the life that\nyou wanted to lead\nso lwig how good of a strategy do you\nthink it is to live a life of avoiding\nregrets\nit's not great there we go it's not\ngreat so like this is where like so\nhere's the thing so when you ask me how\nshould we live our life through\nunderstanding so there's a huge\ndifference between having a life of\nregrets because you were ignorant of\nwhat the you were\ndoing and having your eyes wide open and\nmaking a decision that could go wrong\nso like here's I sound like a robot to\nyou right now no do I sound like a robot\nto you yeah a little\nbit do you want to change the\nserver is that possible yeah we can go\nwest\nright hold\non\nTexas uh you want to go us Central or us\nWest oh wait I think uh us Central\nGG Get\nWrecked okay I just lost\nlwig uh\nhello\nokay\n[Music]\num hey hello did we lose you no I'm here\nwait can you see my camera no I see your\nthere we go we're back boom is this\nbetter\nit's good okay so so like here like\nhere's the thing so I think it's kind of\nyou know there's this principle called\nthe precautionary principle MH which um\nI'm forgetting exactly what the precise\nterm is it it I learned about it in this\nMichael Kon book about climate change\nwhich is really interesting um but it's\nlike kind of this idea that like even\navoiding a bad consequence could create\na bad\nconsequence right so if I live a life\nthat's Raven huh that's So Raven it what\noh there's a show called That's So Raven\nwhere she has visions of the future of\nsomething bad happening and she tries to\navoid the bad thing happening and then\nit always happens because she tries to\navoid the bad thing happening there we\ngo right so so so like I mean here we\nhere we are saying okay let's avoid a\nlife of regret mhm but like how do I\nknow so let's say okay like so let's say\noh I I work so hard I never took a day\nof vacation when I'm 85 years old and\nAllan watts is filled with regret and I\ntoo will be filled with regret so what\nshould I do I should take more vacations\nmhm but then let's say that I take more\nvacations and then when I'm 85 years old\nI could regret something else mhm right\nso like you don't know what your future\nself is going to regret the best\nstrategy is to understand the nature of\nregret EX for me except that you are\ngoing to have some regrets in your life\nand I'm not saying I'm going to do this\nforever just like you you're I don't\nknow if you're going to be streaming at\nthe age of 52 to 52y olds I me who the\n knows mhm\nbut in this moment I'm going to keep\ngoing until the instrument breaks and\nwhen enough is enough then that then\nwe're done and will I look back at that\nmoment and will I say I worked too hard\nsure but even then what are we talking\nabout here what is the consequence of me\nworking too\nhard I made three separate three\nadditional let's say like so let's say I\nI I actually took a vacation so over a\ntwoe period we have let's say four\nuploads okay so let's say each upload\ntakes me about 6 to 8 hours so this is\nlike 32 hours of work okay so if I work\n32 hours less over a twoe period what is\nthe consequence to me I gain 32 hours\nwhat is the consequence to the rest of\nthe world I don't\nknow so what we tend to see with our\nvideos is\nthat you know we don't always make the\nmost successful videos on purpose so\nthere are a couple videos that we're\nsuper proud of one is um a video on why\npeople on the autism spectrum are more\nlikely to be\nnon-binary so like 1% of people in the\nworld are like on the autism spectrum\nmaybe 1 to 3% because it's growing 1% of\npeople in the world are non-binary so\nwe're talking about this is a video that\nis made for the you know\n0.001% or whatever right but like that's\none of the videos that I'm the happiest\nabout because no one is making videos\nfor them no one is explaining to them\nhey you're on the Spectrum here is the\nneuroscientific basis for why you don't\nhave a very well formed gender identity\nor your sense of gender identity is\ndifferent from other people's mhm right\nso like this is where like this has real\ncosts to people and you're right that\nwhen I work as a clinician I have a\nlarge impact on a small number of people\nand when we do this kind of stuff we\nhave like think about the conversation\nthat we're having there's I don't know\nhow many people are watching I don't\nlook at how many people watch but let's\nassume that if we're lucky 10,000 people\nwatch this mhm okay likely to be way\nmore than that probably at least 100,000\npeople and and so if if 10,000 people\nwatch this and they they're living a\nlife of avoidance of regret they don't\nknow what the flow state is they lack\nconfidence in themselves see imagine how\nmuch impact we could\nhave so what is 32 hours of my life\ncompared to all of\nthat dude even if you don't believe in\nGod or reincarnation or whatever even if\nwe take a hard physics approach d I'm\njust one collection of cells\nthat has neurons that has electrical\nimpulses that is going to exist for one\nflash of a second in the history of the\nuniverse what is the value of my\nhappiness very\nlittle in the grand scheme of\nthings you reaffirmed my\nfears good what are you afraid of I'm\ngoing to be tired for so long\ndo you consider yourself a provider uh\nlike what do you call yourself what do\nyou think you are you mean like\nprofessionally no because you have a lot\nof\nresponsibilities and you\nseem beholden to both the people that\nwork for you or like healthy gamer as a\nwhole but also the people of the\nworld what do you think hold on hold on\nso here we are talking all these big\nthings let's understand what the\nwe're actually talking about here I am\noh my God Dr K has such big\nresponsibilities across the world I'm\nworking right now you are working right\nnow we're working I'm not working we're\nnot working I'm not working I'm working\nI'm talking to my friend Dr K this is my\njob I'm sitting here in my mirror I'm\nnot saying you're not working I'm just\nsaying I I got water brought to me I'm\nhaving a conversation about things that\nI really enjoy this is my job what\nsacrifice is this mhm this is great I'm\nnot on the on hold with an\ninsurance company right\nnow right so just yes that's true Ju\nJust because just because we don't put\nourselves first doesn't mean that we\nhave to put ourselves last I've had this\nvision for a while yeah because I have a\ncompany yeah and there's a lot of people\nat the company yep and I think if I\nexploded tomorrow the company would go\naway yeah so I need to keep working okay\nand I thought in my mind like oh I'll\nwork for xong and then I'll be able to\ndo some stuff I want the similar list\nthat you have you know except DOTA patch\nis not in there m actually one mind's\nthe opposite says no DOTA patch for\nanother 10\nyears uh and and I'm like okay well when\ndo I get to do what I want to do and now\nI feel\nlike the answer might be maybe I never\ndo what I want to\ndo so I'm I'm glad to have reaffirmed\nyour fears but I don't think I I think\nthere's a couple of steps that you're\nadding to the equation this is where we\nneed to understand okay so when you do\nwhat you want to do what\nhappens uh happy happy happy happy what\nis the nature of that\nhappiness uh\ngood now see this is where ignorance\ncomes in I don't mean that as an insult\nI mean like we don't understand what\nhappiness is so talk to alien for a\nsecond what is\nhappiness uh like when you feel good you\nknow like what does that mean I'm alien\nexplain it to me I don't know to do you\ndo you have alien sex do you have an\nalien\nwife sure does your alien wife make you\nhappy like how do you feel when you see\nyour alien wife after a 3 week break\nokay so so we can learn so much right so\nwe can learn that deprivation leads to\nhappiness uhhuh we can leave that\ncertain learn that certain sensory\nthings lead to happiness yeah yeah yeah\nright so happiness is an internal\nreaction uhhuh so what destroys\nhappiness what destroys your do you like\nyour\njob yeah then why are you\nunhappy I'm not unhappy then what are\nyou not well because it's not what I\nwant to do what do you want to\ndo open a bakery\nokay so I think this is really good so\nlet's like understand a couple of things\nokay the first thing is that your sense\nof responsibility is what takes away\nyour\nhappiness it's a\nburden you feel responsible for other\nhuman beings you need to let that go mhm\nso like you learn this the hard way as a\ndoctor right because at the beginning\nwhen we're doctors we're responsible for\nsaving\nlives this is just Rich coming from you\nwhat you need to let that go yes yeah I\nneed to let go my my sense of\nresponsibility you're saying you you\nhave to be responsible to people who\nhave leprosy in uh Albania I know it\nsounds it sounds contradictory but it's\nnot so hear me out okay okay I'd love to\nhear this yeah no because imag think\nabout this for a second because if this\nhas been holding you back because you\nthink that these two things are\ncontradictory imagine if they're not if\nimagine if there's one okay so here's\nthe thing I can't control so this is\nwhat you learn as a doctor patient comes\nin I'm here to save their life can I\nsave their life\nlwig maybe maybe that's the right answer\nthat's the best answer I don't control\nlife or death I have a lot of tools at\nmy disposal oh my god let's put them on\na ventilator they're in the ventilator\nin the ICU and they have a pulmonary\nembolism that goes to their brain and\nthat a pulmonary embolism doesn't go to\nthe brain goes to their lungs and then\nthey die can't do anything about that\nright so in life we can only do what we\nwe can do we are only responsible for\nourselves can I save the internet what\nabsurdity is this who am I I'm a\nguy sitting in his office talking to a\ncomputer screen you could be in AI for\nall I know I could be in a mental\ninstitution for all I know maybe someone\nis humoring me what impact do I have on\nother people's life I can't take\nresponsibility for\nthat all I can take responsibility for\nis my own\nactions what absurdity is this I can I\ncan I save a single person I don't think\nI can save a single person that's\ncrazy do you realize I can work as hard\nand I tried buddy I tried bro I've tried\nto save people who are addicted I've\ntried to save people who have heart\ndisease I've tried to save people from\nneeding an their fourth amputation I've\ntried so hard to save people you know\nwhat I realize people are going to do\nwhat they're going to do I can only do\nwhat I can do then it doesn't make any\ndamn sense why you're going to keep\nworking in perpetuity until the wheels\nfall off trying to make videos for as\nmany you know groups as possible\nincluding non what of course it does\nbecause when we talk about you no no no\nno no no no no no no hold on you don't\nget to you don't get to run away from\nyour your words okay no I'm\nnot so you don't concern yourself with\nsuccess what do you concern yourself\nwith what do you mean so earlier we were\ntalking about success right and you said\nyeah I want to be successful in these\nthings and I said do you strive for\nSuccess you said no what do you what do\nyou do on a day-to-day basis l wig I\nwork is that successful what are you\nfocus on what I focus\non do you think about the\nsuccess no I focus on what I have to do\nthat's\nit that's it I focus on what I have to\ndo and is it going to work is it not\ngoing to work I don't know this is the\nFlow State we don't think about the\noutcome the responsibility is the\noutcome it's like I'm not responsible\nfor other people I'm just going to wake\nup I was given 17 years of training and\nunderstanding how a human being Works\nwhat am I going to do with that I'm\ngoing to try to help people with it is\nit going to work who the\nknows so we did something with our\ncontent so there's a lot of like trisms\nin content right if you make a video and\nit's successful make a second version\nyeah so what we found we we listened to\nall of the Common Sense they're like oh\npeople want to like people like this\ntopic so make a second video well we\nalways that the second video and the\nthird video that we made on a popular\ntopic just got worse Never As Good As\nthe original true so instead what we did\nis we're not going to repeat\nanything we're just no repeats I mean we\ndo some rep honestly no repeats we why\njust go back to the well okay but you\nhave an issue\nno the way YouTube works is like if\nsomebody watches a video then like five\nyears later your audience is going to be\ntotally different so why not just like\ngo back repeat some so well in some\nsense we do but what we figured out is\nthat tap into what was going on inside\nus when we made that first video what\nwere we leaning\ninto right so this is how we like and\nour YouTube channel has gotten way\nbetter right and I I I mean twitch\nperformance I'm sure has improved too\nand like this is where like and and the\nthing is like we're just going to focus\non like what people need that's our\nCompass not what has been successful\nit's what do people need today that's\nour compass\nmhm right so we made a really weird\nvideo about why therapy sucks for men\nand was one of our best performing\nvideos we've never talked about that\nbefore I'm a therapist MH and\nI'll be the first to say there are\nproblems with this field and then it\nalso in that video we don't say don't go\nto therapy we say if you're a man here's\nhow to use therapy correctly because\nwhat I hear time and time and time again\nis I went to therapy it didn't\nhelp and now like we're making this\nvideo on like female sociopathy why\nbecause someone posted and they're like\nI get bullied by girls and we see this a\nlot in our\ncommunity so there's this will take a\nbig step back okay I don't I mean in a\nsense I have some responsibility but I\ndon't feel responsible so if someone\ncomes to me tomorrow and says hey Dr K\nlike you've done a terrible job and no\none has been helped by you I'll be okay\nwith that will I try to do better\nabsolutely but I mean what what how can\nI regret what I've done I did the best\nthat I could maybe famous miss last\nwords one day I'll wake up and I'll say\noh this is so so stupid I was behaving\nso stupidly this whole time maybe but\nlike the most you can do is the the best\nyou can do is the most you can do that's\nit I don't have to feel responsible for\nother people so when you're saying okay\nlike if I blow up tomorrow will the\nthing continue and you asked me that\nquestion now we know where that question\ncomes from it comes from your own fear\nand we recognize that so we have a whole\nteam that is trying to figure out\nbecause healthy gamer is bigger than Dr\nK A lot of people may not realize that\nnow I believe that because I recognize\nI'm Expendable what you know mhm a plane\ncould crash tomorrow I could get hit by\nlightning I could have a stroke like all\nkinds of things all kinds of bad stuff\ncould\nhappen so you're going to go till the\nwheels fall off what does that look\nlike you keep saying go till it breaks\nwhat do it breaks it's a good question\nso so I think I'm actually ironically\nnot great at detecting when I'm not\ndoing well so I learned this kind of the\nway residency where where one day my\nprogram director pulled me aside and\nshe's like you're making mistakes you've\nbeen here for 3 and a half years you've\nnever made M like we make regular\nmistakes but you're like making dumb\nmistakes I've known you've been here for\nthree and a half years like what what is\ngoing on what like this is not you and\nthat's when I was like oh and then\nI told her something that I was going\nthrough in my personal life and and she\nand I was like oh like I'm human\ntoo wow I thought all my yoga training\nprotected me from that turned out I was\njust numbing and dissociating and doing\nall the other stuff that you know normal\npeople do when they ignore their\nproblems so I I mean right now I don't\nknow what that's going to look like like\nI mean there's a lot of work that we do\nright now I think at some point it'll\nfeel like too much like I asked for a\nday off a a\ncouple uh recently and I was kind of\nlike told no which is like fair enough\nright so like I I trust my team my team\ntrusts me my team is fantastic they care\nabout me a lot they support me a lot and\nso if they tell me like I can't take a\nday off I can't reschedule stream like I\ndon't ask again because I know they're\ndoing everything in their power to try\nto make my life as good as possible mhm\nand that's how it is right so like you\ndo the work that needs to be done so\nyou're telling me you basically work\nuntil somebody says hey man it's not\nworking with you anymore you're\nout because you can't judge your\nown success I I I don't follow the\nquestion I I don't well you keep saying\nI will do it till it breaks yeah but you\nalso then said you can't gauge when it's\nbroke I used to not be able to gauge oh\nokay right so so now one of two things\nwill happen either I still can't gauge\nright because I could be I think I've\ngrown in that capacity so I will take\nlike breaks but it's not it's not like\nmedicine where I like leave for two\nweeks all the work the work has to be\ndone so I already know that I mean I'm\ngoing to stream four times this week I'm\ngoing to take Friday night off I'm going\nto take Saturday night off and I'm going\nto work a full day Sunday I already know\nthat that's what most of my weeks are\nlike where taking a day off normally\nwhat I would do is there's four hours of\nwork that's allotted for Saturday four\nhours of work that's allotted for Sunday\nand I'm going to compile those into\nSunday because I can't I can't work for\nlike 16 days in a row I need some kind\nof break there's two kinds of breaks\nthere's like shifting work from one day\nand then there's being excused for work\nso when I say I've been and this is not\nthat uncommon by the way there are a lot\nof people who experience this where like\neven their days off are just shifting\nwork around and we don't acknowledge\nthis enough in society we call it a\nvacation but there are people who are\nresponsible for their duties before they\ngo on vacation and after they come\nback and there are people who are like\nif I if someone else does the work I'm\njust going to have to redo it when I\ncome back no that's why vacations suck\nright so so I I but I I think there's a\nthere's a lot here that's needs to be\nunderstood which is that so instead of\ngoing for this vacation and take a break\nfrom work and liking your work I think\nthat there's a real process of crafting\nyour daytoday experience to be somewhat\nenjoyable case in point today a DOTA\npatch is going to drop I had a\nconversation with my wife yesterday I've\ndone all of my work for tomorrow and I\ntold her hey can you watch the kids\ntoday this DOTA patch is going to drop\nI'm going to play a lot of DOTA right so\nI enjoy my life I have a lot to be\ngrateful for but this is where if we\nunderstand what is Regret regret is in\nthe mind what is tiredness do I have\nfatigue in my body then I'll rest mhm\nwhen the instrument breaks it breaks but\nI don't think I mean we'll see but I\nthink the whole point is to figure out\nhow to live your life sustainably\nmeditate for twice a day for 30 minutes\ngo to the gym three times a\nweek take care of\nyourself you know get drunk once every\nsix\nmonths have sex with your alien wife\nevery now and\nthen can't tell cutie about my alien\nright and then it's like it's little\nthings mhm like you\nknow like going out with your kids and\nand one of my kids was like hey can we\ndo something and I was like sure we can\ndo that we can actually cancel your\nclass this day and we can go and we're\ngoing to go have a a bubble te or\nsomething like that it's about like it's\nabout recognizing see this is the\nproblem with with life is we think in\nthe future Dimension so we think I'm\ngoing to delay my gratification I'm\ngoing to be happy tomorrow and then we\ngo on sacrificing today sacrificing\nsacrificing today\nthe only way to survive 4 years without\na vacation is to have your every day be\nsomewhat\nlivable you've come to this conclusion\npost midlife\ncrisis I assume it's it's crystallized I\nthink I'm still going through the\nmidlife\ncrisis you speak so confidently for a\nman going through midlife crisis yeah so\nthe midlife crisis has been quite fun so\nI what what happened with me is I real\nlike I started having all these weird\nthoughts and then I was like what is\ngoing on and I was like oh this is a\nmidlife crisis I recognize it now I\ndidn't realize what was happening I\nstarted like questioning like what the\n am I doing with my life and like\nyou know what's going on here right like\nwe've been building this thing it's been\ngrowing by 25% a year you know like\nwe're doing this and we're doing this\nand we're doing this and this\nopportunity comes and this opportunity\ncomes and like am I happy we wrote this\nbook am I going to write another book\nwhat what the what are we doing and\nI was like oh this is a midlife crisis I\nstarted to have some regrets I started\nto have new things I wanted to explore\nyou know and a midlife crisis in in your\nmind because you're speaking so\nconfidently I don't see any hints of it\nI only hear you speak about it is like\ndistracting wrong thoughts that are\ntrying to suck you away from what is no\nI wouldn't call them distracting or\nwrong so I think this is what's like\nsuper cool is like so I I think that\nthere is a biological mechanism for the\nmidlife crisis I don't have research to\nback this up the closest thing is\nprobably the the work of someone named\nEric Ericson so Eric Ericson I think was\na psychoanalyst or something I don't\nknow exactly what he was Swedish guy\nmaybe I don't\nknow are are you you\nSwedish yeah I don't know um we can see\nbut so Ericson kind of his approach to\npsychotherapy is that we basically have\ncertain conflicts at like certain phases\nof our life so when you're a teenager\nthere are certain kinds of mental things\nthat you have to do then you're a young\nadult and then like at some point in\nyour midlife crisis you like look back\nat your traj or actually like in old age\nyou look back and then you're like\neither filled with regret or can you\nmake peace with like the decisions you\nmade and stuff like that it's a really\nbrilliant approach to psychotherapy and\nso what I I thought is like I always\nthought that my yogic training made me\nimpervious to that stuff but it doesn't\nso the interesting thing is that that\nprocess goes on but I'm observing it\nfrom out here and being like oh this is\njust the midlife crisis this is a desire\nthis is some degree of regret like those\nare all just thoughts in the mind like\nthat's the big thing that I think people\ndon't get is what is Regret regret is a\nthought in the mind it is an unfulfilled\ndesire so you have a regret in your life\nwhen you're 85 when you're driving down\nthe road and you need to take a piss and\nyou go take a piss where is that regret\nyou're just a dude\npissing and the biggest thing that I've\nlearned is that your life is actually a\nstring of moments that are actually\nperfectly fine it is when they get\nstrung together and abstracted by your\nmind that we become\nunhappy so I was working with a guy who\nwas 28 and he said I don't know if I'm\ntoo old to go to college because in 4\nyears I'm going to be\n32 and when I'm\n32 I don't know if it's going to like\nyou know I'll be 32 and just starting\nout in my career and I was like four\nyears from now you're going to be 32 no\nmatter what you do the question is four\nyears from now do you want to have a\ndegree or do you not want to have a\ndegree M the time is going to\npass right time is always going to pass\nthere's always going to be unfulfilled\ndesires there are always going to be\nthings that you can't have I know that\nyou want it all I want it all too the\nonly differen is that I've come to\nrealize at least in this moment because\nI'm having a good day that you're not\ngoing to get it all what absurdity is\nthis so console yourself with what you\nhave learn to be happy with what you\nhave by all means strive for more by all\nmeans work hard try to get more I'm not\nsaying don't try to get more but don't\nlet your happiness be dependent on the\nmore this is the difficulty that a lot\nof people have you can strive for more\nyou can play to win but you don't need\nto tilt just because you\nlose\nokay still\ncontradictory no but I think my vision\nmight be\nwrong how\nso well\nso I have a company offbrand\nand I have a streaming\ncareer and basically my goal was to help\nlike as many people around\nme not like in a charity way but like\nget work and achieve the things that\nthey want to achieve and make cool stuff\ntogether which we've succeeded at doing\nand then like I built up a team and I\nwas like oh I got a big ass\nteam this only works if I keep doing\nthis forever but I can't do this forever\nfor reasons outside my\ncontrol and so I'm like okay well then I\nshould make sure this works without me\nwhich is my current Mission\ngood and then I was like okay when I\nwhen I've done\nthat maybe I can\njust\ndisappear and open up a bakery or\nsomething\nsounds like a great\nplan but I don't\nknow if that is a great plan because I\nthink\neven I think get\nany now I feel maybe okay I should\nkeep\nworking and then like make it more\nsuccessful and Ure success more so\npardon me for saying this you're making\none very simple\nmistake doesn't sound like me go ahead\nit doesn't sound like you that's why\nthat's why it's so hard to pick up\nbecause you don't do this yeah so you\nare assuming that the outside world is\ndeterministic for your internal state\nright say it again but for me so like\nyou're assuming that the decision you\nmake whether you grow the company or\nmake a bakery one of these two these two\nthings will solve your problem neither\nof those things will solve your problem\nhere's what's going to happen here's\nwhat's going to happen when you open the\nbakery let's say you achieve your\nmission which you're going to do by the\nway no doubt in my mind you're going to\nfind some way to have offbrand be\nsomewhat independent you're going to be\nlike I'm going to do I and I think\nyou'll do this you'll start a bakery\nbecause you know I have a feeling I know\nsome part of you and you'll start a\nbakery and then what's going to happen\nis you're going to carry your problem\nwith you the bakery isn't going to fix\nthe problem then the bakery is going to\nbe successful because you're good at\nthat kind of thing and you really like\nto bake so you're going to you're going\nto you're going to have a\nbakery and then what's going to happen\nis a year or two into the bakery you're\ngoing to have a second branch and then\nyou're going to have a third branch and\nthen you're going to feel like oh my God\nall these people are dependent on\nme oh\n and then I have to do it all over\nagain there you go\nso this is the the big thing that is so\nconfusing I see this all the time in\nrelationships I have a problem with this\nperson right this relationship isn't\nright for me you leave the relationship\nyou go find someone else and you find\nyourself back in square one the problem\nwith like relationship baggage is that\nyou carry it with you and relationships\naren't the only place that we have\nbaggage we have baggage from all the\nother dimensions of our life we have\nbaggage when we learn to play chess oh\nmy God I feel ashamed I don't want to\nlose that doesn't come from chess we\ncarried that with\nus so your problems are not created by\nthe outside world I mean this is\ncrazy they're created by what you carry\nin the way that you see\nit\nMH I had an idea to solve this actually\nokay it's called the Thousand Day Bakery\nokay it explodes after a thousand days\npeople have tried that solution popup\nstores temporary things I think\num I forget what the name of this\nYouTube channel was I think someone made\na YouTube channel that they just took\ndown after a year and it got like tons\nof views and things like that honest un\nyeah yeah that's right right and this by\nthe way is you just stumbled upon a very\nimportant Revelation from the Zen\ntradition so Zen Z in the Zen tradition\nwe have a couple of different things\nthat we do one is like\nuh sand Gardens and sand sculptures and\nalso mandelas they create something\nbeautiful for it to be\ndestroyed so you create something with\nlike a like grains of colored grains of\nrice you create some work of art and\nthen you abolish it how do you abolish\nit just get rid of it mix up mix it up\nbecause it's it's made by sometimes it's\nmade by grains of rice so you arrange\ngrains of rice until you have some\nbeautiful pattern and then\nyou go like a sand castle Yeah sand very\ngood\nmhm right you said that like I was a\n10-year-old it felt nice no no no I mean\nit's it's brilliant what's the joy in\nsand castles we've all figured this out\nwith something as simple as a sand\ncastle the joy is in the making not in\nthe having mhm see if you really think\nabout it the moment that you have a sand\ncastle all kinds of problems happen they\nhave to make sure it doesn't get messed\nup now you have to do this now you have\nto do this now you have to do this now\nyou have to do this a lot of upkeep a\nlot of upkeep got to hire people upkeep\nabsolutely keep those people this Castle\nis so great now we got to expand we got\nto build another one everyone's saying\ntake investors everyone's saying we're\ngoing to expand a different state we're\ngoing east coast now supposed to be big\non east\ncoast and then we're going to open up a\nbranch in the UAE and it's going to be\ngreat like it's you know this is a\nbeautiful thing like the joy is in the\nmaking if you can find the joy in the\nmaking if you can find the joy in the\nday to day because what else is there\ntechnically what else is there it is\njust one moment in time that's all there\nis one day at a time that's the only\nthing that\nexists the past doesn't exist it\nexisted the future doesn't exist it will\nexist but in that moment it's always the\npresent so if you can be happy in this\nmoment if you can learn how to live in\nthis moment then it's simple no\ncontradictions I do I have a resp\nresponsibility absolutely do I feel\nburdened by it no why not because what\narrogance is this what am I going to\nchange the world I'm I'm a\ncollection of\ncells am I going to try bur because you\nwake up and do it every day yeah sure I\nno I don't wake up and do it every day I\nwake up and I do it today on the days\nthat I can and on the days that I can't\nI\ndon't and if it ever came to a head\nwhere you couldn't do it anymore you\nwould just stop I haven't been able to\ndo it anymore and on that day I stopped\nand you know one of the most beautiful\nthings is something I learned over the\nlast year I'm so grateful for having my\nbattery recharged tomorrow one of the\nthings that has really helped me over\nthe last year and a half is knowing that\nwhen I wake up tomorrow I will have more\nenergy and so far that has been true so\nokay that's all I\nneeded I got\nit that's\ngood you know what ignore what they're\nsaying you're good at\nthis I'll just do it today and if you\ncan't do it today we see how you feel\ntomorrow see how I feel\ntomorrow the problem is it doesn't have\nto be permanent either way no I don't\nhave to permanently do it forever and if\nI don't feel good I don't have to\npermanently stop doing it forever what\ndon't worry about forever in even two\ndays in a row recently I took a whole\nweekend it was glorious you dirty dog\nit's great a whole week yeah uh like I\nwent in Friday afternoon and I I told my\nwife I was like Hey I've gotta like I've\ngot to do you know about eight hours of\nwork this weekend and it's very\nfrustrating for her because she knows I\nhave all these lofty goals and then she\ntries to support me and then I end up\nplaying do all day and she's like what\nthe I took the kids out the whole\nday and and you didn't do any work that\nwas me I did that I did that this past\nweekend two I was like I was like\ngirlfriend I have to do some work on\nshorts and then I like recorded a couple\nand then I was like I was like paralyzed\nI was like I can't do it anymore and\nthen I played a game of valerant and\nshe's like you're playing a game of\nvalerant I was like yeah I'm playing\nit's it's hard right I think thankfully\nshe's awesome and she understands this\nand now I've understood this and I I've\nI've now come to realize that instead of\nir reflexively going into I need to do a\nlot of work I just you know I'm like hey\nlike I it'd be good if I got some work\ndone over the course of this weekend I\nthink I'm going to give myself 24 hours\nand then on Sunday morning rolls around\nI'm like I'm going to take another day\nand then the beautiful thing I I I don't\nknow you're like this I I think the\nmajority of people in our community are\nlike this like you can get 20 hours of\nwork done in like 6 hours if you're just\nfocused and\nrested so I think a big part of a big\npart of this is\nlike not draining on the macro scale on\na day-to-day\nbasis right so really maintaining your\nWellness like is\ncritical yeah and it's it's not really a\nmarathon it's like okay like I just need\nto have enough energy tomorrow like I\nwant to take care of myself and set\nmyself up for\ntomorrow but anyway so it sounds like\nsomething clicked for you and that's so\nthis whole conversation by the way has\nbeen for that moment mhm it's all\nstumbling around and like what could we\nwhat regrets can we have could we have\ngotten there faster of course\nnot yeah I think well I think you have a\ncool brain and I think you're in a\nsomewhat similar spot different in many\nways but similar in some\nyou know we both Heal the World with our\nwords and and so I wanted to see what\nyou think about it because you've gone\nthrough a midlife crisis I don't think\nI'm\nthere I'm just young but but I do stress\nabout it constantly but it's not a\nburden because I can just do what I can\ndo today and that's enough and that's\ngood yeah and if tomorrow I'm tired\nthat's chill I can be tired and the last\nthing I'd encourage you to think about\nis when you say you stress about it\nevery day understand the nature of\nstress what is stress it is a thought in\nthe mind about a future\nprojection MH and at the end of the day\nwhether you're stressed about it or not\nstressed about it your actions today are\nthe same do you need to make some\nconsideration in the future sure but the\nStr you know and that's like I'm so\ngrateful for like these super long calls\nand challenging patience because that's\nwhen you learn like the right answer\nanswer is the right answer like it may\nnot work out but it's still the right\nanswer you know what kind of\nlike you ever play Majora's Mask yeah\nabsolutely love it favorites all the\ngame I feel like my burden is the moon\nbut I kept looking at the\nmoon but you don't beat the game by\nstaring at the Moon beautiful you beat\nthe game by well there's actually a\npretty long process you had to beat a\nfew temples but playing your first\nsecond and third day and then\njust it's brilliant lwig MH and I know\nyou were trying to be ious but I think\nwe both know you aren't when we both say\nwe're trying to use our words to heal\nthe world and I think that's great I\nthink Majora's Mask is the best analogy\nfor how you should live your life it\nnever connected for me it's just day one\ntwo and three over and over and over\nagain and the whole reason that people\nget burnt out is because they live day\none two and three in a shitty way hoping\nfor day 100 to be better and then they\ngo back and they live day 1 2 and 3\nsacrifice sacrifice sacrifice but it's\njust day 1 2 and 3 over and over and\nover again and the day 100 rolls around\nand suddenly the problems aren't solved\nit's still day 1 2 and three it's always\nday 1 2 and three you just reset you\nreset you reset so find that joy in Days\n1 2 and three do work that you find\ngratifying that can help you go to sleep\nat night and find some joy in Days 1 2\nand 3 and you'll get another day one two\nand three tomorrow and then life will\nfly by MH\nand then one day we can be on a beach\ntogether in Turks and Kinkos not one day\nwhen when yes not one day one day will\nnever come I'm asking you when when are\nwe going to do\nthat see what I mean don't think one day\nthat's a mistake that's not day one two\nand three when in day one day one two\nand three is all we've got day four day\nthat's that's that's the problem is\neveryone's like oh one day I'm going to\ndo no that start\ntoday all right I'll buy the trip now I\nmean we I don't know if you mean me and\nyou but would you buy a trip for 20 like\n50 I don't think you\ncan it's a good\npoint guess you can't guarantee the I\nthink like if you look at like so you're\ngoing on this motorcycle trip I think\nthat's beautiful and I think for people\nwho are watching by the way that doesn't\njust mean good stuff I mean I think it\nalso means work right so play one less\ngame of DOTA play one less game of valer\nlike for everyone who's listening to\nthis like we're not saying give it all\nup but just like do one hour of not what\nyou should do or do something that you\nwill be grateful for that will help you\nsleep there are four things there are\nfour things that scientifically lead to\nsustained happiness that are outside of\nthe the dopamine circuit I know I'm\npontificating but so we you know I was\ntelling you the problem with dopamine is\nthat we get diminished finishing returns\nlike so play your first eat your first\ncookie second cookie isn't as good third\ncookie isn't as good there are four\nthings that we can do that lead to\nsustained happiness and this is more\nrelated to our serotonergic Circuit of\nthe brain it's an\noversimplification but there's basically\ntwo kinds of Happiness there's honic\nhappiness which is dopam energic and\nthere's emonic happiness which is like\nserat energic it's like contentment in\nlife\nself-determination self-expression\nimportance and effort these are the four\nscien ific things that correlate with\npeople feeling happy content even if the\ncircumstances are bad so if you are in a\nhonic state if you get your dopamine\nthen you're happy if you don't get your\ndopamine then you're not happy you have\na diminishing return to happiness so\neven if you get your happiness today you\nwill be less happy an hour from now and\ntomorrow udonia comes from\nself-determination what I say\nself-determination importance effort\nelse and self there's two\nself somewhere yeah I forgot I can't\nbelieve oh yeah self-expression self-\nexpression right so like and that's\nthat's so as you as you do these four\nthings right so it's like when I when I\nwhen I take a break from DOTA for one\nhour to write one chapter of a book that\nis self-expression and\nself-determination I choose to do\nsomething and I'm going to express\nmyself in the world in some way and it\nfeels really good even though I'm having\nless dopamine\nit's like eeky guy\nyes it is I think eeky guy is very\nsimilar to\nthat I I got to see that Alan Watts\nthing by the way because I'm super\ncurious by the way Allan watts is a is a\nZen meditation teacher that's why it's\nreally who also died in the 70s so it's\nnot Alan Watts okay I'm realizing I just\nsaw the name Alan Watts in chat and read\nit as if it was Bible okay I mean it may\nhave been so so the other thing is that\nAlan Watts may have been detached from\nhis regret which I think is the real\ngoal M it's like it's okay to have\nregret like you're going to have regrets\nin life so don't stress about them it\nwas Gabor\nmate that makes a lot more\nsense does it who's\nthat Gabor mate is a brilliant\npsychiatrist M\nwho part of his Brilliance comes from\nhis own flaws so he has done so much he\nhas struggled immensely\nhimself um he is uh I have one of his\nbooks right here here uh here it\nis that's crazy you read his book and I\nwatched a Tik Tok of him talking about\nWinnie the\nPooh this is a great book if you guys\nare struggling with addiction it's\ncalled in the realm of hungry\nghosts um so he in in he talks about\naddiction and it's actually very very to\nwhat we just talked about because so in\nthe uh I think the I forget which\ncountry it's from maybe there's\nsomewhere in the Buddhist tradition they\nbelieve that between Earth and Hell\nthere's like this other plane called the\nrealm of hungry ghosts which is f filled\nwith souls\nwho no matter how much they eat they\nnever feel full so it's like these\nghosts that constantly feel hunger but\ntheir hunger can't be s satisfied and he\nuses it as as kind of an example of\naddiction because that's what addiction\nis it's like you're always wanting\nsomething it's also true of of dopamine\nlike no matter how many games of\nvalerant you play you're never going to\nbe satisfied no\nactually I honestly go I think if I hit\nDiamond I\nuninstall oh really yeah for how long\nthat's a good question because it\nwouldn't be\npermanent but I would get a good year\nand that's that's something how far are\nyou from\nDiamond\nclose like if I won six games in a row\nI'd hit\nit do you want to hit\nit yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay yeah\nDiamond's like I think the start of hey\nyou're pretty good oh really platinum's\nnot I think so what percentile is\nPlatinum Platinum has to be like top 25%\ntop 10% what maybe top 25 yeah maybe top\n20 it's not that good though go god tier\ngamer alert and top top 25 is you want\nto be like top\nfive because plats it's like you know\nyou can trip in a plat I don't know so\nso you know it's interesting because a\nlot of people will complain about the\ntop levels of matchmaking in so many\ngames so I realized recently I actually\ndon't want to climb because apparently\nlike I'm in the good\nZone yeah that's for sure I mean I think\nit's like games are more fun because if\nyou get better it's so easy to start\nwith\nthere's a line I think for valerant it's\na little because so like gold plats I\ndon't know it's tough ascendence\nsupposed to be horrible but there's so\nmany\nSmurfs there's I guess there's never a\nfun line is the reality you're always\ngoing to run into some\n yeah so I think it's about how\nyou play the\ngame right which is like once again the\nanalogy for\nlife it's always you about God mode May\nno what is that God mode May is the\nmonth where everything you think you can\nachieve you achieve\nis that so you set yourself up with like\na list of you know your the things that\nyou wanted to do I wanted to go to bed\non time I wanted to start reading I\nwanted to start riding a bike and you do\nit for just the month of\nMay and then if you succeed you can give\nyourself a little treat and if you fail\nyou have to punish\nyourself I sounds great I think we'll\nlook into that very seriously next year\nwe have similar stuff so we have a\ncommunity ch challenge where we're week\none is about goal setting and\naccountability week two is about\nrelationships week three is about\ncreativity and self-expression and week\nfour is about making the world a better\nplace and if enough community members\nparticipate then I will do a react\nstream to what is\nit who are those\num those dating dating coaches like cut\noh no no\nthe pickup\nartists I'm I'm going to do I'm going to\nreact to pickup artists oh like fresh\nand Fit I I don't know I don't know oh\nwow okay someone said that I should I\nshould go on fresh and fit recently I\nthink you I don't know if you should\nwell I guess you could it would make me\nwatch fresh and fit which makes me not\nyou to not it makes\nme it'd be good because it' make me want\nto watch it but then I think it'd be bad\nbecause then I'd watch fresh and fit\nand ultimately I think the world's\nprobably a better place the less people\nwho wash fresh and\nfit\nokay but I think if you want to do it do\nit I'm happy to just go about anyway I\nmean I usually when we go on things we\ndon't know much about them which is how\nwe try to approach it yeah so I I I try\nto go in blind and not\nform because like I think it's good yeah\nbut anyway we'll\nsee well I feel healed cool\nI feel good\ntoo I'm still my mind is still blown\nover the Market Basket thing man I feel\nlike there's been\nsome I can't believe it looks the\n it looks so similar I never had\nany idea the quality is quite different\nthough what's interesting is Market\nBasket went on strike the New England\none and then they uh\nunionized uh and then the Market Basket\nin Texas was incorporated as ay\nup so it's like they're very similar\nthey have the same logo they have the\nsame sort of corporate\nstructure same name I just realized that\nyours yours has the Bostonian marcket I\ndidn't even realize that at the very\nyeah yeah yeah that's why they they\ndon't say that like that in Texas it's a\nlittle different with the Texas shirt\nyeah that's great man all right well\ncool I'm glad you feel healed thank you\nso much for coming today um any last\nthoughts or questions before we wrap up\nH yeah can you give me something to\nwatch or read and then can I give you\nsomething to watch or read\nabsolutely what are you looking\nfor because you you I think you know me\na good bit I do do a book club yeah do\nyou want fiction or\nnon-fiction whatever you think uh I I\nwouldn't I I don't want to create\nbarriers I think I'm quite open-minded\nto enjoy it but I think if you had like\na based off how you know me like we've\nTed talked to quite a few times what you\nthink might resonate with me more is\nwhat I think I'd care about um have you\nread Count of Monte\nChristo no that's my recommendation\nCount of Monte chisto\nunbridged okay none of this a bridge\n wait wait wait now you're scaring\nme\n18844 oh it's Alexander\ndumbass uh how how long is this all\nright I'll read the count it's a I mean\nif you like fiction like I like I I I I\nread it once every like three or four\nyears I tear I tear through it yeah so I\nACH guy I realized this recently so I\ndid this interesting internal study\nabout my memory and what I realized is I\nread about one book a month on\naverage and um it takes me about 10\nyears to forget so my my enjoyment of a\nbook is back to like a first time read\nif I wait about 10 years which means or\nmaybe about eight years so I need 96\nbooks I need 961 out of 10 books and I'm\n done looking for books you just\nkeep read read yeah go through that\nbecause you know everyone was like what\nwhat movie would you love to watch if\nyou could for like rewatch it for the\nfirst time it's like if enough time\npasses you get to do that yeah right\nthat's the thing is you have to wait so\nfor me it's about 8 years so I need 9\nsix books if you watch it on an edible\nthe time\nhalves or read on an edible does that\nwork I'm not sure man I guess we have to\ntry it one day and find\nout okay all right what's your\nrecommendation what would you what\nmedium do you have a medium you\nprefer I like audio books for\nfiction Okay and\nlike real books for\nnon-fiction because I I like to make a\nlot of notes and stuff\nH just nothing pop psychology please\nhonestly I\nthink you would love well I guess maybe\nit ruins the show for you but I would I\nthink you'd love Tokyo Vice okay no I me\nI think that's okay I read Tokyo\nVice and I thought it was\ngreat uh but I I I know the show doesn't\ngo as uh deep in it yeah so I I I tend\nto\nlike I tend to like you know when\nthere's like a book and a show I tend to\nenjoy the book more than the show\nthere's a handful of shows that I think\nare the exception to that rule so I\nthink Shogun is a very good adaptation\nto the book I think Lord of the Rings\nmovies are very good adaptations I think\nthe Harry Potter movies are pretty good\nI think uh Song of Ice and\nFire is pretty good\nmhm um I've only seen all the shows of\nthe things you're listing yeah but do do\nyou find it additive like if you watch a\nshow do you like reading the book to be\nlike oh my gosh I like reading the book\nfirst and then watching the show because\nthere's a lot of context the one thing\nthat I don't like about watching shows\nis that\num what I really hate is something that\nmy brother brother taught me when you\nread a book without watching a show you\nhave a mental picture of what the\ncharacter looks like that picture gets\nannihilated once you watch the show it\ngets replaced by the actor so it's\ninteresting because in in shun and C of\nmonoc Christo these are a couple of\nexceptions because I read them for so\nmany years that my image of the person\ngot\ncrystallized so that's the only thing I\ndon't like it was frustrating to watch\nand it not be that person in your head\nwhat I it's like I lost that person\nbecause often times the actors are not\nactually accurate portraying\nof even if they do a great job of acting\nthey don't they don't actually\nlike like CU in books not everyone is\nattractive but in shows like everyone is\nattractive right so if you\nReRe Shogun would you now think of the\nactor Shogun is one of the exceptions\nbecause I read it for so many years\nbefore I watched the show so I probably\nread Shogun for the first time when I\nwas like a\nteenager okay so like 25 5 years ago\nit's from the 70s right I don't know\nwhen it's from but I mean claval was in\nhe was in a p camp in World War II which\nwas interesting because he actually like\nfell in love with Japanese culture even\nthough he was in like a Japanese p camp\noh he was in oh that's where he learned\nabout it is in a prison of War Camp yeah\nthat's where he learned about that's\ncrazy it's crazy that's crazy so it's\nit's you\nknow uh I don't know exactly how to make\nsense of that but it's it's\nfascinating but yeah um all right I will\nread Count of Monte chisto and I will\nread Tokyo\nVice thanks a lot man thank you Dr K\ntake care take care as well and anything\nyou've got going on that that you want\nto let people know about that we can\nkind of tune into um projects coming up\nanything\nuh okay no no are you going to is your\nis your\nJapan trip going to have like social\nposting and stuff or is it like more\nprivate I It Won't Be Live no part of it\nwill be live but I will record\nit uh and then maybe make I don't know\nif you ever if you know U McGregor he\ndid a trip with motorcycles with his\nbest friend uh called the long way\ndown uh it was documentary series he\nwent from like UK to South Africa then\nhe went from UK around across Europe\nRussia and then took a little fery\nacross the\nUS um and so that I watch that growing\nup and I was like oh man I'd love to do\nthat across Japan so really the goal is\nto do that you know make some some\ndocumentary from it but just mostly ride\nthat sounds great dude good luck with\nthat stay safe and and you know enjoy\nyourself they have great bakeries in\nJapan they do maybe I'll take a little\nnote long way for my thousand Day Bakery\nyou think the Thousand Day idea is good\nseems like a lot of work for a thousand\ndays actually I guess thousand days is\nis almost three years so I take that\nback so yeah maybe\nyeah call Major's mask bakery bakery\nhave a giant Moon above it that sounds\ngood get sued halfway through I'll work\nI'll work I'll work on I'll work on it\nall right man take care all right babe\ntalking to you buddy bye bye okay um\nthat that was a blast\nguys that was\ngreat\num\nokay so uh we're done for today I think\njust a quick kind of heads up I think\nwe've got a\num I think we're scheduled to stream\ntomorrow and Friday so stay tuned to our\nsocials for that um huge shout out to\n988 for sponsoring today's stream um\njust a reminder for those of you all\nthat aren't aware 988 is actually um uh\na new program or I don't know if it's\nnew but it's it's a program to help yall\nconnect\nto uh crisis counseling 24 hours a day\nseven days a week if you're in the\nUnited States or the five territories um\nso they can it's re it's confidential 24\nhours a day seven days a week it's free\nthey can Al also connect you with\nresources so definitely check that out\nif yall or a friend of yours is\nstruggling with their mental health um\num thank you all very much for coming\ntoday I really enjoyed talking to lwig\nhopefully you all learned something I\nknow a lot of our approach is kind of\nlike contradictory but I don't think\nit's really like that I think it's like\nonce you really understand the\nprinciples that play like it actually\njives pretty well and I'll be the first\nto say that I've been an idiot for vast\nswaths of my life and there's a very\ngood chance that you know a year from\nnow I'll wake up and I'll think oh my\nGod\nall this stuff in the way that I've been\nliving my life was wrong because I've\ndone that before I've lived my life in\ncatastrophically negative and incorrect\nways wow this hair is really getting out\nof control um and and that's just what\nlife is right so like you're going to\nmake mistakes and I'm I mean I'm 41 I'm\nnot\ndone right it's not like I've learned\neverything or all the answers like I'm\nsure that there's a ton of stuff that I\nhave left to learn but the main thing is\nlike you can't be paralyzed today just\nbecause you could be making a mistake\nright you've got to live the best that\nyou can today and then recognize that\nI'm probably making some mistakes that\nsome degree of mistakes are unavoidable\nand like try to live your day I I really\nlike this Major's Mas analogy of like\nthree-day\nsegments and instead of living for\ntomorrow or some magical retirement\nlater in life or something like that\nlive in like three-day segments where\nlike a three-day segment is like a\ncomplete package of progress\nof growth of independence of enjoyment\nof pleasure of\nrelaxation like I really like this 3-day\nsegment this 72-hour kind of\nconstruction so give that a shot report\nback and thank you all very much for\ncoming today thank you to lwig for\ncoming on and having as always a\nstimulating\nconversation and we'll see youall\ntomorrow take care everybody"
