    "transcript": "so we get a lot of flack because we'll\nmake adhd videos that are two hours long\nand people with adhd are like oh my god\ni have adhd how the hell am i supposed\nto get through that\nand so what we did instead is we made an\nadhd guide that's about 20 hours long\nand this is about 100 pages worth of\nscript\nand i hate to say it but like adhd just\nbecause you have adhd doesn't mean that\nfixing it can be reduced to 15 minutes\nthere are a thousand tick tocks out\nthere that say hahaha i have adhd or\nmemes that you can look at one image and\nyou're kind of like oh yeah that's me\nbut then what do you do about it because\nthe truth of the matter is overcoming\nadhd is friggin hard and it can't be\nreduced to like a 15 minute summary if\nit was then no one would have this\nproblem\nso as frustrating as it is if we really\nwant to try to help you we've got to go\ninto all of this crap and even if your\nattention span sucks we're going to do\nour best to make it entertaining and\nwe'll divide it into like 20 videos that\nyou can watch one at a time\nbut honestly like that's the best that i\ncould do like i can't i can't distill it\nto five minutes and then just be like ah\nadhd cured that doesn't work like that"
