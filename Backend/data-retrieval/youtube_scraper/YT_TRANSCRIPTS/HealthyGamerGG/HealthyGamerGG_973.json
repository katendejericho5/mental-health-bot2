    "transcript": "because if these are the best years of\nyour life and those years were bad for\nyou that's like that opportunity's gone\nthat ship has sailed\nscrew the idea that childhood is the\nbest part of your life first of all\nfirst off you're entitled to your happy\nchildhood memories this is more of a\nvent post\nevery time i hear about how much fun it\nis it was to play d as a kid\nthe intensity of finally finding the\ncourage to talk to their crush\nhearing them laugh as they remember that\nrelationship only lasted about a week or\nabout how bullying made them stronger\nhow they snuck out of the house as\nteenagers about how their interests and\ndreams for the future were in constant\nflux\nseeing them smile as they reminisce\nabout going to a party dancing their ass\noff and noticing that their girlfriend\nwas embarrassed\nevery time i hear about how people would\nwant to do it all again if they could\nall i think of is that i really wouldn't\nnot that i don't have good memories but\nmost of it really just sucked\nschool specifically it was an\nenvironment where you were either part\nof the class or completely excluded by\nit there was even bullying going on\nearly on\nthough perhaps not as you would normally\nenvision it it wasn't a small group of\npeople then that came later but the\nentire class that would hate on one\nindividual\nit was an environment that taught me to\nbe extremely conscious about what i said\nand did\nso as to not give people ammunition\nwhile simultaneously not making an\neffort to make friends because the less\ni could be part of that the better\nas people got older i started to believe\nthat i must somehow be fundamentally\nbroken for no one to like me\ni did somehow find friends occasionally\nthough but unfortunately i hadn't been\ntaught much about conflict resolution\ncombined with my new found belief that\nthere must be something wrong with me so\nno one must like like me every\ndisagreement felt as if they had finally\nseen through me resulting me in me\npulling back into myself\ni didn't realize that then that conflict\ndoesn't have to end with me apologizing\nprofusely ignoring my own feelings and\ntaking full responsibility or ghosting\nas they probably hate me now\nperhaps if my own feelings of\nnervousness fear and anger when i\nstarted school had not been dismissed as\nme being whiny i could have found\nsomeone to help me with my problems as i\ngrew older as it stood i was left to\ndraw my own conclusions\nso since i had clearly driven these\npeople away i should\ni should try to act less like me and\nmore like the people around me who have\nfriends\nexaggerate the things about me that are\nlikable suppress the ones that are not\nwhen i do find friends i should always\nbe talking about them helping them out\nwhen they need it while solving all of\nmy own problems by myself\nstrive for complete independence in all\nthings\nso friendships as a teenager were mostly\nsurface level and a lot of my life was\njust kind of dull again there were\nhighlights more than before and\nironically mostly when i let the mask\nslip was\nwas more authentic to myself\nbut a lot of teenage life just was\nreally boring and uneventful\nall that to say if it was possible i\nwould never go back in time just to live\nit all again perhaps to change things or\nto get more time to live and learn the\nlessons that people learned as kids and\nteenagers that i'm currently learning\nfor myself\nso childhood sometimes suck as can\nteenagers i hope that even if childhood\nmight be the best part of other people's\nlives it doesn't have to be the best\npart of mine\nso we have this idea\nthat childhood is supposed to be the\nbest part of our life\nbut for a lot of people for too many\npeople\nwe don't have warm glowing memories\nabout childhood the truth is childhood\nwas hard\nwe were sort of thrust into the world\nwithout adequate training\nor education we skipped past the\ntutorial\nand we just got bodied by life\nit wasn't a small group of bullies that\npicked on you it was the whole class\nbecause the class likes to make fun of\none kid and some of us are that one kid\nand then that shapes our perception of\nourselves\nwe start to learn how to survive\nwhere communication becomes giving up\nammunition\nso we withdraw into our self\nas we withdraw into our self we don't\ndevelop social skills we miss milestones\nand then what happens is we don't learn\nbasic things like conflict resolution\nand so there are opportunities for\nfriendship there are opportunities for\nconnection but since we miss these\nmilestones\nwe end up learning lessons like conflict\nhas to end with me apologizing profusely\nignoring your own feelings and taking\nfull responsibility\nand then what we end up doing is\ncultivating relationships where it's\nalways our fault and never theirs\nwe become doormats\nand then what we end up doing is since\nother people are right and i'm wrong\nyou discover that oh okay like there are\npeople out there who are narcissistic\nwho will be my friend if i if i let them\nyou know if i don't advocate for myself\nand i uh there you'll find a lot of\nfriends right so if i'm lonely and i\ndon't have friends\na really easy way to find something that\nlooks and feels like friendship\nbecause the truth be told you may not\neven know right\nis when you do things for other people\nwhen you help people out when you're\nalways the friend who will help them\nmove\nbut\nyou don't know how to ask for help\nyourself\nstriving for complete independence\nwithin yourself while fostering complete\ndependence for the people around you\nyou're the friend that's always there\nfor them even if they're never there for\nyou\nand you feel frustrated by that but that\ntoo is something that you don't know how\nto even ask for help sometimes right\nbecause a long time ago remember that\nlike\nopening up to people and being authentic\nis giving them ammunition\nso you learn to exaggerate the things\nabout you that are likable suppress the\nthings that are not and by the way a\nfriend who needs help is something that\nis not fun right\nif you're crying and upset about being\nlonely and stuff like that like that's\nnot a good look\nand so we sort of end up in this kind of\nsituation like as an adult sometimes\nwhere we're kind of looking back on our\nchildhood and actually saying to\nourselves\nyou know what\nchildhood for me sucked\nbut that's kind of tricky\nbecause there are a lot of other people\nout there who say childhood is the best\ntime of our life\noh my god it's the best years of your\nlife enjoy them\neveryone says that right\nso let's think about that for a second\nlet's try to understand what does that\nmean for you logically if your childhood\nwasn't good\nwhat it means is that you're screwed\nright so let's just think about this\nso if the childhood is the best years of\nyour life\nand then as you get older things get\nworse so like this is the best that life\nhas to offer it's your childhood right\nand then your\nyoung adulthood old age then you're sick\nand you get cancer and all that bad\nstuff this is the best part of life\nbut you start over here\nbecause your childhood wasn't good\nyour childhood sucked\nand so what that sort of means is as\ntime gets older like this is as high as\nyou can go because everyone says this is\nthe best and you missed out on that so\nit's almost as if you were\nnot given the opportunity for a complete\nand happy life\nbecause if these are the best years of\nyour life and those years were bad for\nyou that's like that opportunity's gone\nthat ship has sailed\nit's like starting a classroom starting\na class with the highest grade that you\ncan get as a b you missed out on the a\nthe a is like not even a possibility\nbecause everyone says that the a happens\nin childhood and since you didn't get\nthat since you missed out on the best\nopportunity that life has to offer you\nwill never have as good of a life as\neveryone else\nthis is what it means\nright because if childhood years are the\nbest years and you missed out on those\nyou've missed out on the best of life\nyou're going into the game having missed\nout on the best part\nit's devastating\nso like what do you do about that right\nit's kind of like\nthat sucks\nso there are a couple of really\nimportant things to understand\nthe first\nis what does best mean\nit's like what does that mean best\nso a lot of people appreciate childhood\nfirst of all\nbecause our brains\nlet's understand why people appreciate\nchildhood\nfirst is that our brains have bad\nmemories\nlike think about you know how much do\nyou remember about being eight\nhow much do you remember about being\nnine how much do you remember about\nbeing 12 or seven\nlike do you remember\nwhat it was like to be you two years ago\nversus 10 years ago versus 15 years ago\nso the first reason that we tend to come\nto the conclusion that childhood is the\nbest years of our lives is because our\nmemory sucks\nso we tend to romanticize things we tend\nto have powerful emotional experiences\nwhich define our childhood\nso this goes back to vedic psychology if\nyou all have seen you know our lecture\non this we've done\nstreams about it we've done youtube\nabout it it's in dr k's guide very\nsuccinctly so if you need like a\ncomprehensive resource that's the best\nplace to find it but you can find it on\nour youtube channel as well\nbut this is the kind of thing where like\nyou have that emotional impression which\ndoes not get digested so anytime you\nexperience an emotion\nthat emotion gets somewhat digested and\nthen whatever doesn't get digested gets\ndeposited\nand gets stored\nand what digests emotion generally\nspeaking the adult mind gets better at\ndigesting emotion so if you think about\nemotional processing a five-year-old\ndoesn't know how to emotionally process\na ten-year-old may know how to\nemotionally process a little bit better\na 20-year-old may know a little bit more\nemotional processing and by the time\nyou're 35 you're hopefully decent at it\nand that's why you can be a parent to\nsomeone else so you help them\nemotionally process\ntherapists will help you emotionally\nprocess\nright so you can help out\nbut here's the thing as a kid you can't\nreally emotionally process very well so\nwhat that means is that a lot of\nemotions get stored down\nand then they get recalled\nso you don't remember you just remember\nthis epic birthday party where\neverything was a blast but you don't\nremember these vague like emotional\nimpressions that are tied to like\nalmost pictures of memories they're not\na full memory where you remember what\nwas said and what was done and what\neveryone was wearing you just have these\nlike impressions right that's what\nmemory is like it's like this impression\nthat has a powerful and emotional\nexperience\nyou remember the first time that you had\na crush\nyou remember exactly what they looked\nlike but you don't remember what you had\nfor lunch that day or maybe you do maybe\nit's very vivid in one particular day\nso we tend to romanticize childhood\nand part of the reason we romanticize\nchildhood is if you had a good childhood\nthen there are all these positive\nemotional impressions and when you think\nabout this being the best time of your\nlife what you really remember is those\npositive emotional impressions because\nthat's what really all you can remember\nso childhood in that way isn't really\nthe best time of our life it's just we\nremember it in a particular way that\nmakes it appear the best because of the\nway that our memory works\nthere are other features about childhood\nthat make it\nbetter\nso one is that generally speaking we\ndon't have responsibilities\nright\nlike so like you're free and things are\nnew so like in ch as a child things are\nnovel you can enjoy things more you have\nless responsibility there's like less\nso as we talked about earlier over time\nwe form core beliefs we form ways of\nlooking at the world we can become\ncynical and doubtful and scared\nand so\nonce we start thinking that way life\nbecomes less fun\nso as a child like what's so awesome\nabout childhood we don't think we've got\na clean slate\nso experiences are like novel and\ninteresting and we're not quite as\ncynical any kid you meet at the\nplayground could be a friend they're not\njudging you for the way that you look\nso after you have lots of experiences\nand you start to learn these things\nabout yourself you start to form beliefs\nabout yourself you have an outlook on\nlife\nthat negatively impacts the way that you\nlive life\nchildren are also incredibly present\nright they don't really think too much\nabout the past and they don't really\nthink too much about the future\nso when we put these things together we\nput together like the way that your\nmemories are formed like how we\nromanticize our childhood\nwe put put together things like a\npresent focus novelty and a lack of like\ncynical outlook we can see why childhood\na lot of people say that childhood is\nthe best time of their life\nso if you had a crappy childhood does\nthat mean that you've basically missed\nthe boat on having a good life\nyour amount of happiness is going to be\ncapped at 80 because you missed that\nsweet sweet\nupper level happiness that high quality\ntop-notch happiness of childhood\nthat's how it can feel\nthankfully the answer is no\nthat's not the case at all\nso some of us\ni mean i didn't grow up this way but\nsome of y'all i suppose\nsome of us\nhave crappy childhoods\nwe have childhoods that are filled with\ntoxicity we have childhoods that are\nfilled with judgment we have childhoods\nthat are fill filled with being\nrudderless\nright like as we're navigating problems\nin childhood like if there aren't people\nthere to help us and support us we don't\nhave the capability to help ourselves as\nchildren\nso if you're in a bad environment like\nyou don't you just don't have the\ncapability to try to affect change in\nyour life and so all you do is you get\nscrewed you get body you get beat up you\nget pushed around you get knocked back\nand forth by life\nbecause you're a kid and you don't know\nwhat to do like you don't know how to\nlike stand up for yourself no one taught\nyou how to stand up for yourself and in\nthe worst case scenarios you started to\nbelieve that you didn't deserve to stand\nup for yourself\nand if that's your childhood\nwhat does that mean does that mean that\nyour life is just not going to be as fun\ni completely disagree so i think there\nare two kinds of childhood\none childhood is where you peak\nand the other childhood is where your\nyou trough\nso for some people childhood is the low\npoint in their life and life just gets\nbetter\nand for some people they feel like\nchildhood is the best part of their life\nand generally speaking goes downhill or\nthey feel that way\nbut that too is a cynical impression\nright so that's something they carry\nwith them so we'll get to that in a\nsecond\nso some people that i work with\nhave worked with that grew up in toxic\nhouseholds\nand what i've experienced with those\npeople is that\nchildhood it's it's\nonly\nuphill from childhood in terms of\nquality\nso this is where if you're growing up in\na toxic in a place where you had a toxic\nchildhood and you kind of feel like\nscrewed out of life\nthere's good news which is that it like\ngets better and time is on your side so\ni'll give you all just a simple example\nso i was working with someone who was\nnot heterosexual and grew up in a\nrelatively\ntoxic household where people were\nunaccepting of who they were\nand so the problem is that they grew up\nin a small community where they don't\ncontrol like where they go to school\nthey don't control who their parents are\nthey don't control like where they spend\ntheir time like they don't they don't\ncontrol anything in their life so they\njust get knocked around with life\nthe good news is that as they grew older\nthey get more power to shape their life\nif you've had a bad childhood chances\nare it's because you lacked\npower right like that's all kids lack\npower and the difference is that if you\nlack power and your surroundings are\npositive that doesn't matter\nbecause people are watching out for you\nbut if you lack power and no one is\nlooking out for you then you're in\ntrouble\nso the good news though is that every\nyear that goes by every year that this\nperson grows up they get a little bit\nmore power over their life\nthey go away to college\nthey have more\nlatitude\nparents aren't looking over their\nshoulder they can explore their identity\nthey can meet other people they can\nstart to shape who surrounds them\nthat's a huge part of a crappy childhood\nit's like you don't get to control who's\nat school like you have to go to school\nyou don't get to set limits on people\nyou can't limit contact with someone at\nschool\nyou just can't do that\nand so every year that goes by you can\nshape your life more in the positive\ndirection you can find a positive\nrelationship\nyou can work with professional\ncolleagues who respect you for who you\nare you can start to build a family of\nyour own\nand so if you've missed out on a happy\nchildhood it's gonna take work but you\ncan absolutely be happy and you can even\nbuild a life that is like phenomenal and\ni've seen this happen\ntime and time and time again\nso that's the first thing is like if\nyou've had a toxic childhood kind of\nsucks for you and every year that goes\nby you can exercise more and more power\nto become to build the life that you\nwant to the next thing to remember is as\nwe looked at and understood why\nchildhood is so special you can start to\ncultivate those things in your life\ntoday\nso you could start to be more present\nfocused and you will literally increase\nin happiness\nnumerous studies about this\nwhat is anxiety anxiety is worrying in\nthe future\nanxiety is future focused this isn't dr\nk's guide too\nlike you can't have anxiety about the\npast people may think they have anxiety\nabout us but it's technically impossible\nthere may have been an event in the past\nthat you're anxious about the\nconsequences of in the future but\nanxiety is future focused it's about\nthings that have not happened yet\nregret is of the past you can't regret\nanything in the present you can only\nregret in the past past actions\nso joy is found in the present\nthat's what kids kids don't have a\nconception they like their brains\nliterally cannot their frontal lobes are\nunderdeveloped so their ability to\nanticipate things in the future\nis like\nnot developed neuroscientifically which\nis why they live in the present\nso as we train ourselves to live more in\nthe present\nwe can\nreclaim some of the happiness of\nchildhood\nso there's all kinds of different stuff\nthat we can do to sort of become happier\nin the present and be more childlike\nanother thing that happens\nis novelty\nso this is something that adults do\nadults don't engage in new stuff anymore\nand so if you start engaging in new\nstuff you can capture a piece of that\nchildhood happiness\nyou know a good example of this is\nsomething like i don't know about\npeople's dietary restrictions and stuff\nlike that but like eat a strange food\nso i was probably in my 20s\nthe first time i tried an oyster\nnot a huge fan\nbut it was definitely an experience\nright like you can try new stuff but we\ndon't do that\nand and part of the reason we don't do\nthat is because\nmost of our experiences with new things\nare not things that we\nseek the things that happen to us when\nour kids when we're kids are like you\nknow our parents like here try this food\nall of the novelty in life we're trained\nas children that novelty is handed to us\non a silver platter\nliterally in the case of oysters\nright so like we\nyou can become more childlike you can\nget some of the joy of childhood but you\nhave to learn how to seek novelty\nthe third thing that you can do to\nbecome more childlike or be happy as an\nadult is be aware of your like cynicism\nin the way that you view life because as\nyou start to view life with more and\nmore expectations it tanks your\nhappiness and a big part of the\nhappiness of childhood is actually like\nbeing expectation free\nright so i like i had three months of\nsummer and like i didn't know what i was\ngonna do\nand i was actually like pretty bored but\nman it was a blast\nso be free of expectation\nand the more that you cultivate like\nsomebody like be careful about your\nattitudes like prune some parts of the\nattitudes that you have and as you start\nfocusing on your attitude and mindset\nlike life will become more fun\nso if you're someone who's sort of\nfallen into this idea like you hear this\nthing that okay childhood is the best\nyou know\nbeing a kid is the most fun you'll ever\nhave\nand everyone says it right a lot of\npeople say it\nthen you're kind of there scratching\nyour head and you're sort of thinking\nlike my childhood wasn't great does that\nmean that i'm basically screwed does\nthat mean that the capacity for\nhappiness in my life\nhas been like the the limit on that the\nceiling on that has been like\nbrought down because that's what it\nsounds like right because every everyone\nsays happiness is the best years of your\nlife and if i mean sorry childhood was\nthe best years of your life and if you\ndon't have a good childhood that means\nthat you're not gonna have a great\nlife and if that's the case then you're\nkind of like well does that mean i'm\nscrewed no actually no\nthere's a different kind of life where\nchildhood is actually the worst\nand every year that goes by as you\nbecome more empowered to craft the life\nthat you want to\ndo you want to go on vacation do you\nwant to stay up till 2 a.m do you want\nto stay up until 6 a.m do you want to\neat cookies for breakfast do you want to\nhave donuts for dinner you can do all\nthose things as an adult\nand then there are a couple of actual\nattributes of childhood that we need to\nkeep in mind\npresent focused is number one\nsecond thing is like how we're\ncynical how we start to form\nexpectations of the world and those\nexpectations take the glow in brightness\naway from the world\nand so as we start to dismantle those\nand really understand like how we\nbelieve what we believe we can become\nmore childlike\nso expectations\nand cynicism\ngot to do away with that be present\nfocused and seek novelty\nbecause the whole thing is that novelty\nis given to us right even if you think\nabout playing a new game\nsometimes we'll go hunting for a new\ngame but most of the new games we play\nabout are things that like get presented\nto us so we see advertisements for it or\nyou know\nthere's a pro\nsponsored stream somewhere or like\nwhatever right so we don't go seeking\nnew experiences\nbut if you seek new experiences live in\nthe present and let go of expectations\nlike\nthe you're going to have an amazing life\nand by the way being an adult is pretty\ngreat for a lot of reasons\nright like you get to eat what you want\nto when you want to\nyou're a little bit more responsible\nwhich is tricky but you know\nso if you've had a bad childhood it\ndoesn't mean that your capacity for\nhappiness in this world has been\nartificially limited don't worry you can\nabsolutely get there\nand it's absolutely worth it"
