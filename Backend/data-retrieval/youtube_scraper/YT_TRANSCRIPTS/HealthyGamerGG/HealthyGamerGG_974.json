    "transcript": "we'd like to think that we're rational\nhuman beings but the truth of the matter\nis that the most powerful moments in our\nlife in terms of when we learn lessons\nare emotional in nature mildly insellish\nrant i was recently told by a girl i was\nseeing that she wanted to be with\nsomeone she could be proud of someone\nwho is better than herself not me\naccording to her first of all ouch\nnot the first time this happens i am not\ntall or muscular i do not exude\nconfidence i do not behave in the most\nconventional manly way\nit's not who i am nor who i want to be\ni've cut ties with my family years ago\ni've struggled with anxiety my entire\nlife and also depression in recent years\nmy support network is incredibly small\nand i'm having to learn alone as an\nadult a lot of basic stuff most kids\nlearn from their parents self-love\nconfidence relationship skills\ndespite all that crap i am an engineer\nin one of the biggest tech companies in\nthe world i make 20 times my country's\naverage salary and am on my way to\nretire before 40. i taught myself\nenglish through games and music i lost\nover 50 pounds in the last year and am\nnow working to get a body i can be proud\nof i've been working on my mental health\nsince the beginning of the pandemic\nanxiety is no longer a struggle and\ndespite all this rant the world seems a\nlot easier to navigate nowadays thanks\nto dr k into therapy\ni don't have a lot of friends but i try\nmy best to be there for them and help\nthem whenever they need me they treasure\nme and i treasure them too\nthe girl i mentioned above seems to to\nbe slash have none of these things by\nthe way\ni'm writing this because i'm truly proud\nof the person i am and the things i've\naccomplished however it seems like most\npeople don't see me like that\nwhen it comes to people in relationships\nit feels as if hard work and consistency\ncan never beat natural selection\nnobody cares about all my progress no\namount of effort or good will seems to\nbe enough\nif a man is born five inches taller the\nworld treats him like gold if a man is\nself is taught self love and confidence\nfrom loving parents all doors seem to\nopen for him at the slightest touch\nmeanwhile i'm invisible i have to scream\njust so people know i'm here\nwhenever other people are involved\neverything is a lot harder everything i\nget has to be earned i try to think\npositively all the extra hard work will\nmake me stronger more resilient smarter\nall the tangible useful qualities i've\nbeen acquiring will outweigh the fact\nthat i'm five eight and a bit shy yet\ni'm still alone maybe i'm wrong so i'm\nstarting to think\nno amount of effort will be enough i'm\nstarting to think i'm doomed to run in\ncircles no one will ever see the\nawesomeness and the potential i see in\nmyself what's the point\nso i could use some external input\ninputs and new perspectives on this i'm\nrunning out of ideas patience and hope\nby the way this is not my usual mood i\nhad a bad week sorry if it sounds\narrogant envious entitled insellish hope\nit's okay to vent here thanks for\nreading\nso this is a fantastic post\num you know i definitely feel for the\nperson so like this is what's really\nunfortunate\nis everyone tells us if you want to be\nsuccessful in dating\ndon't focus on the person you're trying\nto hook up with focus on yourself right\nthe formula for success in dating is to\nwork on yourself\nget in shape like this person lost 50\npounds\nbecome professionally successful this\nperson makes 20 times the national\naverage in terms of salary\nand is on their way to retire by the age\nof 40.\nthey've taught themselves english\nthey've been working on their mental\nhealth they're doing everything right\nright so sometimes we get this like\nfeedback from people that oh if you want\nto be successful in dating\ndo these things and if you do these\nthings you will be successful\nbecause these are the things that you\ncan control\nthere's some stuff that you can't\ncontrol in life like your height\nor your ethnicity or the parents that\nyou're given but what you can control is\nthe effort that you put in whether you\nexercise or not whether you do go to\ntherapy whether you like you know watch\nour stuff or do coaching or whatever\nand so it's like incredibly frustrating\nwhen you do everything right\nand when you do everything right\nand\nthe person you're dating says she wants\nto be with someone that she can be proud\nof\nsomeone who is better than herself\nand that isn't you and breaks up with\nyou\nit's like what's the point\nright like you're doing everything right\nyou're trying to believe\nyou're trying to like really you're\nyou're doing what you're supposed to be\ndoing\nyou try to think positively all the\nextra work makes me stronger more\nresilient like all this kind of stuff\nright what doesn't kill you makes you\nstronger but when you look at the rest\nof the world you see like other people\njust have it easier than you do\nand it feels like as if hard work and\nconsistency is never going to beat not\nonly natural selection but inborn\nadvantages\nyou can be poor born poor and work your\nentire ass off like you can work two\njobs in 80 hours a week\nand\nyou'll never make as much as someone\nwho's like\nyou know heir to a fortune of a billion\ndollars\nand this is this is what the world looks\nlike to us sometimes\nso we're gonna dive into a little bit\nabout like\nhow to approach this kind of situation\nand what you can do about it\nso this is where there are a couple of\ndifferent things that we're going to\ntalk about\nthe first is\nthe expectation of fixing things before\nthe start of a relationship\nor like what people\nactually let me think about how to say\nthat again\nthe first thing that we're going to talk\nabout\nis actually emotional impact and how\nemotional impact affects our view of the\nworld okay this is also going to become\na little bit important when we talk\nabout meditation later\nthe second thing that we're going to do\nis try to understand what is the\nrelationship between\nworking on yourself and dating success\nand those are the two things that we're\ngoing to be focused on\nso the first is\nour mind forms conclusions so if we can\nlook at this person\nand i really appreciate this post for\nmany reasons\nso they're like\nthey they've done everything right\nthey're like an engineer they have a\nsuccessful career they're losing weight\nthey kind of don't see themselves as\nconfident\nand then they get dumped\nand they even kind of acknowledge that\nthis is not my usual mood i had a bad\nweek sorry if it sounds arrogant envious\nentitled enceladus hope it's okay to\nvent here it's a totally fine event here\nespecially in this kind of way because\nthis person is being a little bit\nreflective right it's not just about\nventing they're sort of pointing out\nlike what they've done you can sort of\nsee it in terms of the upvotes right\nyou know it's 93 up vote right so i\nthink people are totally fi fine with\nthis kind of thing because it's not just\ndoom or kind of mentality it's like this\nperson's actually making effort at\nunderstanding their beliefs and sort of\nsaying like i'm doing everything right\nand i'm still getting screwed\nso the first thing to understand is when\nyou feel emotionally upset\nwhat do y'all think that does to the\nconclusions that your mind forms\nright\nlike what does it do to them\nso when we feel upset\nit has a couple of interesting effects\non our mind's ability to learn so when\nwe form a conclusion\nwe're essentially learning\nso there's something really interesting\nwhich is if you look at the hippocampus\nwhich is the part of our brain that\nlearns\nit's very very tightly connected to the\nlimbic system and especially the\namygdala which is the part of our brain\nthat experiences emotion especially\nnegative emotion\nso learning is very very emotional in\nnature\nwe like we'd like to think that we're\nrational human beings and the biggest\ninfluence on our learning are actually\nour cerebral cortices the cortices are\nlike the outside of our brain which are\nsort of like where a lot of our human\nability to think comes from all animals\nhave and actually i don't know about all\nbut\nmammals certainly all of them have\namygdalas all of them have limbic\nsystems and all of them have hippocampi\nbut the cerebral cortices is really what\nsets us apart so we'd like to think that\na lot of our learning\ncomes from rational thought but the\ntruth of the matter is that the most\npowerful moments in our life in terms of\nwhen we learn lessons are emotional in\nnature\nthe challenge is that the lessons that\nwe learn may not entirely be correct so\ni want you all to think about you know\nlike moments in your life where you were\nlike\nswore something to yourself like never\nagain\nright like if there are moments in your\nlife where you sort of\nadopted a behavior or perspective\nthe more powerful that perspective is\nthe more emotional it is and if you kind\nof think about it like we understand\nthis even in terms of movies because in\nmovies like people don't\nyou know like when you see someone\nhaving a transformative experience where\nthey're like never again and they like\nlearn and change and transform their\nlives it's not an analytical experience\nthey're not going and sitting in a\nphilosophy classroom and then going and\ngoogling things and then reading\nwikipedia and then sitting there and\nlike reading books on nietzsche that's\nnot where we see human transformation\nhappen\nand we sort of resonate with this as\nhuman beings because human\ntransformation and learning things\nis something that's emotionally powerful\nit's like this moment where someone like\ngets bullied and they're like left\nbloody on the floors kids like laugh and\nwalk down and that's that's the moment\nright that's the moment when you soar\nnever again and then you see the\nprotagonists get up and they start\nexercising and they learn mixed martial\narts they do all this stuff and like\nthey transform their lives and get\nthings together and then you have your\nfinal climax and showdown it's all\nemotion\nnow the challenge\nso we learn easily from emotions the\nchallenge is that what we learn\nis tricky\nand the more emotional we are\nthe lessons that we learn sink in deeper\nbut they're actually less correct in a\nsense and this is the tricky thing about\nthese kinds of emotional situations so\npeople have this person is like it's\nreasonable what they're saying they're\nlike i did everything right i did my\nresearch i dug deep i worked hard got my\nass into therapy got my ass to lose 50\npounds\nbecame professionally successful worked\non myself worked i wasn't taught these\nthings like self-love i like didn't have\nparents who loved me so like i'm doing\nall this stuff and it's friggin\nexhausting\nand this is what happens to me\nhow can i not be screwed because i did\neverything that i was supposed to\nand i'm still not getting what i was\nexpecting\nso then what happens is your mind comes\nto the conclusion it's all about natural\nselection it's all about the luck of the\ndraw but if you think about it what's\nthe emotional energy behind that\nconclusion\nit's resentment it's dashed expectations\nit's hurt\nbecause if your your partner who you\ncare about tells you\nyou know like everything you're doing is\nnot good enough i need to be with\nsomeone who's better than you like what\ndoes it tell you about yourself what\ndoes it tell you about the value of all\nof the effort that you're putting in\nit tells you that the value isn't enough\nand then you learn that lesson that all\nthis crap is a waste of time\nbecause\nif it would have worked then i wouldn't\nhave gotten dumped\nright that's what that's the lesson that\nyour mind learns\nand so what do we do about this so like\nif you're sitting on the outside you can\nlook at this and you can clearly see\nthat adopting your girlfriend's value\nsystem who by the way does none of the\nthings that you do and has not\naccomplished nearly as much as you have\nher judgment is not actually like an\naccurate representation of most of life\nthe challenge is if you're in this\nperson's shoes like\nthat sort of doesn't matter right\nbecause at the end of the day you got\ndumped and it hurts\nlike so other people sort of telling you\nlike bro you're a catch\nlike she's crazy like don't worry about\nwhat she thinks there are going to be a\nlot of women out there who will be very\ninterested in like what you have to\noffer and would be very lucky to date\nsomeone who's focused on their physical\nhealth professionally successful and\nlike goes to therapy and like works on\nthemselves like that's awesome\nright like that's fantastic so people\nwill sort of say things like there's\nother fish in the sea don't let it get\nto you things like that but i want you\nall to acknowledge that the conclusions\nthat your mind comes to are going to be\nmore exacerbated the more hurt you feel\nbecause in this moment you feel like\nit's not doing anything\nand that's sort of true because it\ndidn't work quote unquote with her right\nbut there's still like value to what\nyou're doing which it's hard to believe\nbecause you feel resentment so what do\nyou do in this kind of situation\nthe first thing that you've got to do is\nas this person's already done and that's\nwhy i'm really like honestly proud of\nthis person because they recognize that\nthese thoughts are coming from a week\nwhere their mood has been very bad\nand we've got to be really really\ncareful about forming\npermanent conclusions\nfrom temporary moods\nright so there's a there's a book of\nrussian fairy tales that i i\nreally enjoyed growing up\nand i even now read them to my kids and\nthere's like one line in those those\nfairy tales that i think is really\ninteresting which is morning is wiser\nthan evening\nand i thought that that was like kind of\ninteresting i read it in the fairy tale\nand i sort of noticed that that was\nactually true that like when you wake up\nfirst thing like the world can be\nfalling apart the night before but when\nyou wake up the next day\num\nyou know like things have a different\nperspective like your perspective will\nchange over time especially as your like\namygdala starts to calm down as your\nlimbic system starts to come down you've\ngot to be extra careful if like you got\nbroken up with and they're texting you\nthe next day and you're thinking about\nit again and stuff like that but a clear\nhead forms the best conclusions\nso if your mind is kind of messed up\njust be careful about forming\nconclusions\nbased on a temporary emotion now what\nhappens for a lot of people is this\nexperience will happen again and again\nand again and then the emotion won't be\ntemporary you'll be in a relatively\npermanent state of doom and then you\nbecome a doomer or an incel you\nreinforce this kind of emotional\ninput\nthrough joining things like echo\nchambers right so you'll join some like\n4chan forum or something like that or\nsomething like in cell subreddit or\nwhatever and then like you'll get a lot\nof people who are like feeding you the\nsame emotion they're feeding you their\nanger and their resentment and now\nsuddenly like you're perceiving all this\nstuff\nand you found the one corner of the\ninternet where everyone has the same\nexperience you do and since everyone is\nhaving the same experience\nyou start to believe it's true\nas you start to believe it's true you\nstart to run into a lot of problems\nbecause now like you're you've sort of\nformed a fundamentally incorrect\nconclusion\nso the first thing is like process your\nemotions first of all it's okay that she\nbroke up with you like this is where\nyou've got to understand that when\npeople break up with you this is\nsomething that's so hard to understand\na lot of times the reason that people\nbreak up with you has nothing to do with\nyou and has everything to do with them\nand they'll even say the big irony here\nis that half the time when they say it's\nnot you it's me\nthat's the self-aware person\nwho actually it is you and it's not them\nbut the people who blame you for the\nbreakup are often the ones at fault\nthey're the ones who should be saying\nit's not you it's me\nright like that's the really bizarre\nthing is the less self-aware you are the\nmore you blame other people for your\nproblems\nand she's like you're not\ngood enough for me and it's like here\nyou are losing 50 pounds in a year which\nis amazing by the way working on\nyourself and you're not good enough for\nher that's totally fine\nlet her go find someone who's good\nenough for her i think it's gonna be\nhard to find someone as good as you are\nbut this is where it's so tricky because\nwhat we do is internalize the judgments\nof the people who break up with us\nwe internalize the judgments of the\npeople who reject us\nbut that's just their judgment coming\nfrom their flawed mind right if she's\nlooking for someone who's like so great\nlike why doesn't she get in shape why\ndoesn't she become more\nyou know professionally successful\nso this is what's really hard is when we\nfeel hurt and we get this kind of\nfeedback we don't think about it\ncritically\nright because the we got hurt it didn't\nwork period\nthat's our emotional circuitry active\nthat's that's why we don't think about\nit critically so here's the other thing\nto understand about the amygdala and the\ncerebral cortex\nwhen the amygdala is active it shuts off\nthe cerebral cortex when the cerebral\ncortex is active or the frontal lobes\nare active it does its best to shut down\nthe amygdala\nthese things have a mutually inhibitory\nfunction\nso when you get really really emotional\nyour emotional mind literally shuts down\nyour ability to like think critically\nand that's evolutionary by the way\nso as it turns out when you're in a\nsurvival situation you don't want to be\nthinking critically actually what you\nwant to be doing is acting very quickly\nand jumping to conclusions\nbecause the kinds of situations that\nthat these these brains evolved for were\nnot complex internet relationships\ninvolving making 20 times your salary\nand losing weight and all this kind of\ncrap our brain evolved for snap\ndecisions in emotional situations\nlike i see a tiger in the jungle do i\nattack it or do i run away\nlike there's no nuance there's no like\nwhat is the tie like is the tiger\nreincarnated from my dad\nis the tiger hungry is it friendly\nyou know what does it mean that there's\na tiger here should i kill it what is\nlike the morality of killing a tiger is\nit okay to kill it is it okay to wound\nit\nthat's not how we think when we see a\ntiger\nso there's even some something really\ninteresting that we know that adrenaline\ndoes something really interesting it\ntakes our peripheral vision so if you\ntake your hands and you wiggle them out\nhere you can actually see that right\nlike you can see like your peripheral\nvision is actually quite wide it's like\nalmost 180 degrees which is weird\nbecause we don't really think about\nbeing able to see out of the side of our\nhead you can do the wiggle you'll see it\nyou can even go further back and keep\ngoing further back until you don't see\nit i can see it kind of like right here\nokay\nthe other interesting thing is that\nthat's when adrenaline activates it\ntakes our peripheral vision and it\ncollapses it to a 30 degree cone\nso all you can see is what's in front of\nyou when you're emotionally activated\nand it also does the same thing\ncognitively\nso here's the full range of what i can\nconsider when i'm calm but when i become\nemotional the world becomes black and\nwhite\nand this is where like if you've ever\nhad a political discussion with someone\nyou disagree with you'll understand\nexactly what i mean they cannot see\nbeyond 30 degrees\nand neither can you\nboth of you thinks you have full\nperipheral vision but that's not the\ncase\nso when you're emotionally activated all\nthe conclusions that you're going to\ncome to or chances are they're going to\nbe flawed it doesn't mean that there\nisn't something to be learned there\nfrom this but chances are the takeaway\nmay not be what you initially come up\nwith\nright the takeaway may be something\nalong the lines of like it's okay for\nher to break up with you if she's\nlooking for more than what you are but\njust because she's looking for more does\nnot mean that you are not enough you may\nnot be enough for this one person but it\ndoesn't mean that you're not enough for\na thousand other people out there\nand i've talked to worked with and been\nfriends with\nyou know over a hundred women who what\nthey're looking for is exactly what this\nperson is describing\nwhich is like a man who's like somewhat\nemotionally available working on\nthemselves professionally successful and\nlike getting in shape\nright like that's what a lot of women\nare looking for\nwhich now comes to sort of like another\npiece that i want to talk about\nactually so let's just pause for a\nsecond so\nat the end of the day\nwe're told from a dating perspective\nthat\nwe should do particular things and then\nwe will be successful and it makes sense\nright because you can't sort of force\nsomeone else to like you the most you\ncan really do\nis\nwork on yourself and make yourself like\nmore attractive to like people that you\nwant to date\nso you can like\nbecome professionally successful you can\nget into shape more you can like learn\nhow to cook and things like that\nyou can work on your own self-confidence\nnegative self-talk like all these kinds\nof things\nand so the thing is like doing all that\ncrap takes a lot of energy and effort\nit's not easy to lose 50 pounds\nit's not easy to make so much money that\nyou're gonna you're on track to retire\nlike by the age of 40. it's not easy to\ndo that stuff\nand you do that stuff and you sweat and\nyou toil\nand you exert everything you've got\nand then your girlfriend dumps you\nand then you're like eff it\nright like there's just no way to win\nlike i was told\ni was told\ni was informed that if i do these things\ni will find love and i will be happy\nand then like when that doesn't happen\nyou feel really resentful and when you\nfeel resentful you've got to be really\ncareful about the conclusions that you\nform\nfor all the above mentioned stuff\nbecause our brain is forming conclusions\nthat wants to form conclusions that's\nexactly what our brain forms the most\npowerful conclusions is when we feel\nhurt and resentful the problem is that\nwe lose sight of things\nin those states\nand so this is the kind of thing where\nlike the most important thing is to like\nemotionally decompress\nacknowledge the resentment acknowledge\nhow bad it feels\nto actually be crushing it and for it to\nnot matter like does that make sense to\ny'all like how devastating that must be\nif you're doing everything right\nyou're crushing it on every objective\nmeasure\nor on a couple of really big ones and\nfor you to still get dumped makes it\nfeel like all of the effort that you're\ndoing is worthless\nand that's the really tricky thing\nbecause if in that moment you give up\nand you start letting yourself go\nthen you're actually screwing yourself\nright\nand so that's where like it's really\nreally important to first of all like\nforgive yourself\nsecondly like deal with that resentment\nthirdly understand that if someone\nbreaks up with you\nthey may perceive that as a shortcoming\nfrom you but like there's all kinds of\nstuff going on in their mind\nand you'll sort of know this like if you\nguys have had parents\nwho have very high expectations\nnothing you do is ever enough\nright\nit's like\nif you get an a they want an a plus\nif you got the silver medal at the\nolympics they want a gold\nand some people\nare looking for you to satisfy them\nand no amount of effort that you put in\nwill satisfy them but that's where we've\ngot to be really really careful because\nif you have those kinds of parents that\nkid grows up feeling like they're not\nenough\nbut by any objective measure they've got\na 4.0 gpa and they're like an olympic\nmedalist like what the hell like what\nmore do you want\nand so some people\nare\nnot content with a particular\nrelationship and what they do is they'll\npush that\nonto their partner that the reason this\nrelationship is not working is because\nof you\nand the less they take responsibility\nthe more they shove the responsibility\non your you the more doomed you the\nrelationship is because they're not\nwilling to accept responsibility they're\ngiving you the responsibility and your\ndumb ass is taking it so you all are\nkind of happy that way\nand then when you get broken up with you\nfeel bad and they're like yeah they just\nweren't good enough for me and even in\nthat there's like this like subconscious\ncontract between like who's responsible\nfor this relationship falling apart\nand she's blaming you and you're the one\nwho's accepting the blame and so they're\nlike okay like then what do i do and\nthen you become resentful\nand that's what's so challenging about\nthese kinds of situations is when you\nfeel hurt when you feel like you have an\ninsecure when you're insecure and you\nget dumped by someone despite doing such\na good job\nyour insecurity is so powerful that you\nnever stop to consider\nthis person doesn't know what they want\nin a relationship this relationship\nwould have worked better if they had\nactually taken some responsibility\nbut we don't think that way when our\nlimbic system is active because that's a\nnuanced perspective that comes from the\ncourtesies\nand so the most important thing in these\nkinds of situations is to first of all\nacknowledge that no relationship breakup\nis one person's fault like that's just\nnot possible or almost not possible i\nwould think\nmost of the time\nlike 95 of relationships\nif if a relationship falls apart it's\ncomposed of two people therefore two\npeople are responsible and the less that\nyour partner accepts responsibility for\nthe breakup of the relationship the less\nlikely they are to be correct and you've\ngot to be careful because if that feeds\ninto your insecurity because you are\nworking on yourself so hard because by\nthe way you're 50 pounds overweight or\n100 pounds overweight and you've lost 50\npounds so boom there's the insecurity\nfeeds into the whole thing activates the\namygdala in the limbic system you blame\nyourself you learn that the world is\nuntrustworthy and there's no chance\nyou've got you let yourself go because\nit's so easy to let yourself go because\nit doesn't matter at the end of the day\nso easy to give up\nand that's that's the real tragedy it's\nnot that you got dumped by someone who\ndoesn't understand the value of who\nthey're dating\nthe real tragedy is when\nthey don't understand the value of what\nthey're dating and you\nagree with them\nwhen you adopt their perspective\nbecause it feeds right into the\ninsecurity that already exists\nso if you're working on yourself\nand you get dumped because someone says\nyou're not good enough\nbe a little bit careful first of all let\nyourself be resentful\nacknowledge it work through it but be\ncareful about the conclusions that you\nform\nbecause at the end of the day if you're\nworking on yourself that really is the\nbest thing that you can do\nand be super careful about the success\nof a strategy based on a sample size of\none so that's like the other like really\nsimple thing right like\nyou can't base a strategy off of a\nsample size of one it's like that's just\nnot how things work like that you know\nso give yourself more opportunities give\nyourself more chances continue working\non yourself and eventually you'll run\nacross someone who like\nsees the value in who you are\nit's tough though it ain't easy\nquestions\nwhat is your opinion on you must truly\nlove yourself before you can truly love\nsomeone else completely disagree\nthat's kind of weird everyone says stuff\nlike this right because it's like a\nfeel-good thing like oh you must truly\nlove yourself before you can love\nsomeone else\nbro let me tell you what or girl it's so\nmuch easier to love another person than\nit is to love yourself\nright like let's be honest here\nright like\nlike we like to think that we can't love\nso no but like you can absolutely love\nsomeone before you love yourself\nloving yourself is not like it's like\nthe end of the road not the first thing\ni mean like you all tell me if i'm wrong\nbut like just think about your own life\nfor a second right\nhave you truly loved someone\nand do you truly love yourself i\nadventure that there's more of you\nthat can say yes i've truly loved\nanother human being and i've not loved\nmyself\nso much easier\nnow i think the real tricky thing is\nthat\nit's really hard to love yourself\nif you haven't been loved by another\nperson\nso oftentimes the way it's really\nunfortunate but the way that we learn to\nrespect ourselves is actually through\nthe respect of others and we see this a\nlot in terms of like\ntherapy and stuff\nwhere you go somewhere and you have low\nself-worth and your therapist treats you\nwith worth\nand like\nthat's confusing for you at the\nbeginning you're like wait what like why\nare you you're just treating me this way\nbecause you're my therapist right\nlike you don't actually believe that\nand then if you stick with it for a\nwhile you'll start to realize oh no they\nactually like do believe that and then\nyou're like oh maybe i am worth\nsomething\nso often times it starts from someone\nelse\nthis is one of the reasons in general so\nwhen we're talking about dating and\nstuff so one of the reasons i really\nreally like group coaching is because of\nthis principle\nso here are a couple of reasons why\nit's so hard to describe but group\ncoaching is awesome for a couple of\nthese reasons\nthe first is that in general in life we\ntend to learn from our mistakes\nthe challenge is that we don't learn\nperfectly so what that means\nis that we have to like make a mistake\nlike five six seven times before we\nlearn from it right\nthat's problem number one so groups\ncoaching fixes this because other people\nare making mistakes too\nand we can kind of like learn from their\nmistakes\nand you may say like but wait how does\nthat work it's because when someone\nauthentically shares an experience of\nthemselves\nand you're there like learning how to\nlisten to them properly and like ask\ninsightful questions when it's\nfacilitated by a coach who sort of like\nmoves the the conversation in the right\nway you actually learn from them\nand so even if you like watch our\nstreams or our youtube content and you\nfeel personally attacked or you're\nlearning a lesson from what we talk\nabout that has nothing to do with you\nyou can actually learn lessons from\nother people\nthat's the whole basis upon which aoe\nhealing is built\nit's that you don't have to screw up\neight times to learn eight lessons\nthe other big irony is as we've already\ndiscussed when you actually make a\nmistake you're so caught up in it so\nanyone who this dating post that we just\nlooked at this person gets dumped by his\ngirlfriend after he loses 50 pounds and\nhe's on track to retire at the age of\n40. and she says he's not good enough\nwhen you're in that space\nit's hard to see\nlike how that's crazy\nand how you're actually doing a\nfantastic job is actually on her\nthe cool thing is that when you learn\nfrom other people's mistakes you\nactually see it more clearly and then\nwhat happens is you say oh crap i do the\nsame thing\nit's so it's actually easier in a weird\nway to learn from someone else's\nmistakes because you are objective about\nit and they are subjective about it\nwhen you're emotionally all messed up\nyou don't actually like learn\nright because like the whole point of\nthis post that we just saw is when you\nget dumped after doing everything right\nyou actually come to the erroneous\nconclusion\nthat it doesn't matter\nbecause your mind is all screwed up\nso the cool thing about group coaching\nis when some when one person makes a\nmistake everyone learns from it and\nhopefully those people will share their\nperspectives and bring that person back\ninto alignment and then it's the next\nperson's turn to make a mistake and\nessentially what happens is you've got\neight people let's say hypothetically\nall get dumped over the course of six\nmonths\nand now you've learned how to handle\neight breakups because you see how each\nand every person handles the breakup you\nhelp them get through it and when you\nhelp them get through it you learn a\ndifferent way of talking to yourself\nhow do you learn different self-dialogue\nyou learn it by dialoguing with other\npeople\nand then when you get dumped and they\ntreat you with value and worth\nand remember they're not your therapist\nright so the other group members this is\nthe other key thing\nthe other group members are paying to be\nthere you're not paying them to be there\nand so getting the respect and worth\nwhen someone else tells you hey i think\nyou're worth it and i think someone\nwould\nwould be lucky to date you here are the\nreasons that i think you're a valuable\nhuman being here are all the ways that\nyou have helped me over the last three\nmonths\nwhen you hear that from one of your\npeers that's something that's incredibly\npowerful\nand personal coaching is is great don't\nget me wrong\nbut like there's this aspect of like\npeer support\nand the respect of your peers that is\nactually really really important\npeople have done studies on software\ndevelopers\nand what they discovered is the most\nimportant thing for a software\ndevelopment developer is actually not\nthe respect of your bosses it's the\nrespect of your peers\nso peer support can have awesome impacts\non self-worth so we tend to see is that\ngroup coaching\nworks really well for people who are\nlike students and people who are trying\nto navigate like common issues\nso that's where like it really thrives\nbecause everyone's struggling to date\nright like everyone's like trying to\nfigure out this online dating business\nand we'll go into that in a little bit\nmore detail but the whole point is that\nlike when you go through it and your\nmind is all messed up and people help\nyou work through it\nwhen they're helping you\nthat's when they themselves learn does\nthat like does that make sense like this\nis huge and irving yolum did a bunch of\nresearch on this and what he kind of\ndiscovered was really important that\nhelping someone else through a problem\nequips you to deal with it\nbecause you've walked them through like\nthe things that you say right like you\ngive them the dialogue and then some\npart of your brain knows\nwhat to say some part of your brain\nknows how to see value despite the\nperson beating themselves up and then\nwhen it happens in your own mind you\nhave some of that experience\nand so like this is why group coaching i\nthink is really powerful from an outcome\nperspective\nwhat we see is you know just for the\nsake of completeness we tend to see like\nstandard metrics improve faster in\npersonal coaching the thing is i think a\nlot of the stuff that improves in group\ncoaching we actually don't have good\nmetrics for\nso you'll get there sort of like in\nterms of reductions in depression\nanxiety life purpose all that kind of\nstuff but i think there's some of these\nother factors which we just don't have\ngood instruments for\nthat's the real value and that's why\nit's also confusing for people because\nthey're like why should i you know like\ni thought talking about my problems is\nsomething i do with an individual\nand that can be useful too don't get me\nwrong but it's like really for shared\nproblems so if you suffer from something\nthat\nsomeone else or like that's a common\nproblem\nthen like group is better because\ngroup will like\nhelp you\nhelp other people through it and when\nyou help other people through it you\nyourself are going to internalize it and\nthere's a lot of value to being able to\nbe objective and learning from a problem\nas opposed to being subjective\nyou"
