    "transcript": "there's a lot about the assumptions that\ndating apps have which have become so\ntrue and commonplace\nthat we've never really stopped to think\nabout whether these are like\nconceptualized the right way or not and\nso what that sort of gives us the idea\nof is like since i can put my profession\ninto my profile i can put my height into\nmy profile i can put all these kinds of\nthings into my profile we assume that\nthe features of the profile will\ndetermine dating success all these\npeople who are like doctors and still\nstruggling to date or people who think\nlike oh i'm a nice guy or like i do all\ni check all the boxes why am i still\nsingle it's because checking the boxes\nhas nothing to do with the actual\ninteraction you can look at like online\ndating and you can say like oh i'm under\nsix feet i'm i'm screwed and we'll form\nthese conclusions because\nthis is what the dating app is doing is\nthis shaping our perception that these\nare the things that matter\nso we're going to talk about dating apps\nfor a second\nokay and there's a lot about dating apps\nthat we sort of don't\nappreciate or recognize\nwhich is be like there's a lot about the\nassumptions that dating apps have which\nhave become so true and commonplace\nthat we've never really stopped to think\nabout whether these are like\nconceptualized the right way or not\nso let's start with a couple of things\nthe first is that dating apps\nask you for a profile\nright\nand you put things into your profile\nand so what that sort of gives us the\nidea of is like since i can put my\nprofession into my profile i can put my\nheight into my profile i can put all\nthese kinds of things into my profile\nwe assume\nthat the features of the profile will\ndetermine dating success\nbecause that's what i can put into the\nprofile\nthe biggest\nconfusing thing about dating gaps which\nis dating apps which is a little bit\nsubtle\nis that things that you can measure and\nstick on a profile may not correlate at\nall to dating success\ndo you all understand that when people\nwere developing dating apps\nthey didn't sit down and do a bunch of\nresearch what leads to the most\nsuccessful relationships\nwhat they'd ask themselves is\nwhat can we capture\nin a profile that leads to success\nbecause they're fundamentally bound by\nwhat the dating app can represent\nthey're fundamentally bound by a profile\nand this is why a lot of people get\nconfused about some of like you know\ndating stuff\nso people will sort of say like we we\njust had a post earlier where someone\nwas saying i'm professionally successful\ni'm getting in shape i'm doing all these\nthings and people don't seem to care\npeople don't seem to care all they care\nabout is height and weight and these\nkinds of things\nand i've i even had like so a body who\nwas in medical school with me\nand so like this person had had some\ndifficulty dating\nand so they when they went to medical\nschool they were like oh once i go to\nmed school like the ladies will be all\nover me\nbecause ladies love doctors right\neveryone's looking for a doctor once i\nbecome a doctor\nit's going to be easy\nyou know\ni'm gonna have more than i can handle\nit's gonna be great\nand then like finish med school became a\ndoctor started making some money and\nstill like struggles\nand so then a lot of people will be\nsuper confused because they're like i\ndon't understand like i'm a nice guy\ni'm professionally successful\ni treat people right like i do all of\nthese things\nlike they look at their life right\nbecause they've optimized what you can\nput into the app\ni work well\ni'm good at this i'm good at this like\nall this stuff is listed on there\ni put it all into the app i'm confused\nwhy don't why don't why isn't this\nworking out and then they become\nresentful\nso here's the key thing to understand\nabout relationships\nso everyone will say like relationships\nare all about communication the problem\nis like that's not something you can\nstick in a dating app\nso all these people who are like doctors\nand still struggling to date or people\nwho think like oh i'm a nice guy or like\ni do all i check all the boxes why am i\nstill single it's because checking the\nboxes has nothing to do with the actual\ninteraction\npeople who are successful in dating if\nyou're wondering how can a how can\nsomeone who's broke in a heroin addict\ncontinually find someone to date\nit's because they're good at like\ninterpersonal skills\nright so if you sort of say that okay\nprofessions don't correlate with success\nin dating and you're like ah you throw\nup your hands\nor if you say like money doesn't\ncorrelate with success in dating or you\nsometimes you think that money does\ncorrelate\nand you just think you don't make enough\nand everyone's looking for someone who\nmakes more than you\nbut like the fact remains that a lot of\npeople who are unsuccessful a lot of\npeople who are under six foot in fact\nthe majority of people who get married\nare under six feet\nthe hell is going on there\nright so you can sit like you can look\nat like online dating and you can say\nlike oh i'm under six feet i'm i'm\nscrewed\nyou know short kings it's hard being\nshort king\nand we'll form these conclusions because\nthis is what the dating app is doing\nit's just shaping our perception that\nthese are the things that matter\nbut you have people out there who have\nall these requirements on dating apps\nand they're still on dating apps because\nthey're still single because they have\nall these requirements and then we get\ninto the conversation about lowering\nyour standards and stuff like that we'll\ntalk about that in a second\nbut the key thing to understand is that\nif you're single\nthe single most important thing the\nsingle thing it's not profession\nit's not how tall you are how muscular\nyou are\nin fact there was recently a study that\ni cited and then people were wondering\nabout the citation and stuff i looked at\nit more closely so people looked at six\nsort of dimensions of like dating\nsuccess and basically like men\nprocreating and also engaging in\nrelationships and the effect sizes for\nthings that they looked like like jaw\nsize muscularity was positively\nassociated with all the associations\nwere tiny\nvery very small associations as you look\nat big big meta analyses\nso essentially like what we sort of know\nis that like people\nwho are\nunder six feet\nmake forty thousand dollars a year are\nstill successful at dating getting\nmarried and having kids\nso what's the deal\nand then we have people who are very\nresentful because like i'm a doctor\nwhere are all the women\nor i'm a doctor where all the men\nright like i thought i was told that\nthis is how you become successful at\ndating\nand the main thing is that everyone\nthinks that your success in dating has\neverything to do before the interaction\nthat's what everyone controls you'll get\nthat like so i need to go to the gym\nmore i need to get more professionally\nsuccessful i need to do all this stuff\nahead of time and then the interaction\narrives\nand what they're focusing on is like i\ndon't understand why people don't\nrespect the fact that i'm this rich or\nthis successful or like all this kind of\nstuff\nand what they end up doing is they don't\nfocus on the interaction itself\nright and this is how people who are\nlike on paper not good mates\nwill end up in relationships because\nthey're actually good at like the\ncommunication and the interaction\nand we've got this other group of people\nthat's like obsessed with all the stuff\nbefore the interaction\nright i'm gonna make more money i'm\ngoing to get more in shape i'm going to\ndo this i'm going to learn how to cook\neveryone says work on yourself so i'm\ngoing to work on myself i'm going to\nwork my on myself i'm going to work on\nmyself\nand you work on yourself up until the\ninteraction\nand then like you never practice the\ninteraction you never practice\ncommunication skills\nyou don't like practice like what it's\nlike to communicate and be with another\nperson\nright like i do you know how to flirt\nlike because that's pretty important in\ndating right there's a bunch of actual\nskills\nthat go into the relationship process\nwhich is exactly how people who like\naren't good on paper\nfind relationships because they're\nactually good at being in a relationship\nand that gets everyone to scratch their\nheads because then it's like okay how do\ni do that\nand that's where for a while you know\nthe pickup artist community was like\nhere's how you do that but i think a lot\nof their conceptions were like very\ntoxic in nature and were born of\nresentment right so what they like\nreally\ntaught people to do is objectify women\nbecause once you make them an object\nthen\nthey're able they're less able to hurt\nyou\nso like in order to get over your own\ninsecurity we're going to objectify the\nperson on the opposite side of the table\nand therefore like\nyou know they're like a bot treat them\nlike a bot like they're not a human\nbeing with thoughts and feelings and\nyou'll sort of hear this kind of\ndialogue right like you'll even it's not\njust the pickup artist community in\nterms of men and women you'll sort of\nsee this with women as well well they'll\nlike they'll come up with like you know\nthese terms like scrotes\nwhich are like dehumanizing terms for\nmen\nand the whole point is once you\ndehumanize someone then like their\njudgment matters less to you once their\njudgment matters less to you it's a\nlittle bit easier for you to interact\nwith them because then your insecurities\nare sort of not managed but sort of\nbypassed\nthe problem is you're creating a\nrelationship by dehumanizing the other\nperson\nand it lets you get over the initial\nhump but it dooms your relationship to\nfailure because now you're in a\nrelationship with someone who you've\ndehumanized\nso the only kind of person that's going\nto stay in that relationship is someone\nwho's very insecure themselves\nwhich is sort of what you see in these\nkind of dehumanizing dating communities\nis that the ones that end up in\nrelationships are the ones that end up\nwith doormats\nand what they also do is they'll like\nsort of like if you're not a doormat\nthey'll like\ncome up with all these kind of weird\nterminologies and justifications for why\nyou're low value whatever\nright this is where like we rank people\nand so they do all these kinds of\ndehumanizing things\nthe key thing though is that\nchecking boxes is important by all means\nbut if you're struggling in terms of\ndating like communication skills is\nreally what it comes down to\nit's about articulating what you want\ntrying to understand and making making\nan effort to understand what the other\nperson wants\nit's about articulating your boundaries\ngetting them to articulate theirs\nrespecting their boundaries having them\nrespect yours but also\nin sort of compromising certain\nboundaries which is like eye opening oh\nmy god i'm supposed to compromise a\nboundary that's insane it's my\nboundaries people should respect it i\nshould be able to eat cheetos and play\nworld of warcraft for 28 hours a day if\nthat's what i want to do\nthat's my boundary that's what i need\nhow dare other people\ncause me to respect like to alter my\nboundary\nwe're not saying be a doormat right\nwe're not saying like let people\nnecessarily disrespect them but\ngenerally speaking a big part of\nrelationships is compromise because each\nyear wants slightly different things or\nvery different things and so succeeding\nin the relationship is about talking\nabout compromise\nbut that's like that's not what we learn\nwe don't learn how to communicate with\npeople we don't learn how to flirt\nwe don't learn like you know how to have\na conversation around boundaries we\ndon't learn how to express discomfort\nwith someone we don't learn how to\nmanage resentment\nso a post that we looked at earlier\ntoday was all about\nyou know like this girlfriend dumping\nthis guy because he's like i need more\nthan you and that's like like the reason\nthat relationship was doomed to fail is\nbecause this\nfeeling\nstarted way before the person breaks up\nwith you but they were never able to\narticulate it so y'all were never able\nto work on it\nso it's like articulation communication\nlistening\nvoicing what you want\nbecause a lot of times it's really hard\nto voice the things that we feel\nembarrassed for\nthis is ultimately what leads to\nsuccessful relationships i've had\nthe privilege\nof looking into a lot of different\nsuccessful relationships and you may\nassume for a moment that oh you're a\npsychiatrist doesn't mean you just look\nat broken relationships no a lot of the\npeople that come into my office are not\ncoming for relationship problems they're\ncoming for other things\nright they have adhd\nand the only reason they survive is\nbecause they have a rock steady\nrelationship with someone who supports\nthem through and through\nso i've seen good relationships and i've\nseen people come in for like couples\ncounseling\nand what i tend to find time and time\nagain is what you'll hear from people\nis like communication is the foundation\nof a good relationship so the question\nis then people get confused because it's\nlike i'm a doctor i make 400k a year i\ndon't understand why i'm still single\nit's because you spend all your time\nassuming that checking a particular box\nwill make you successful in a\nrelationship\nand this is a this is a perception that\ndating apps reinforce\nso this is something that's really\nimportant to understand\nwe tend to act based on what we can\nmeasure\nbut it's not clear that what we measure\nactually correlates with success\ndo you all get that\nso that one of the most frustrating\nthings about science\nis that there are certain things that we\ncan measure\nand certain things that correlate with\nsuccess and those aren't actually the\nsame thing so i'm going to show you all\nsome research about this that just\nexemplifies this point\nso there's a lot of research about\nclient and therapist matching\nbecause we can measure certain things\nabout a client and we can measure\ncertain things about a therapist\nokay\nlike there are certain things we can\nlike we can measure demographics right\nwe can measure ethnicity\nwe can look at the ethnicity of the\nclient we can look at the ethnicity of\nthe therapist\nall right\nand so people have been trying to figure\nout how to match clients with therapists\nfor a long time\nlet's see if this pops up oh gg\nokay gg\npsychotherapy outcome is a function of\ntherapist patient matching on selected\nvariables so you can look at this for a\nlong time\nessentially what you discover is that\nit's really hard to predict so my\nsynthesis of the evidence\nis that you can measure particular\nthings about a client and you can\nmeasure particular things about a\ntherapist but matching based on those\nvariables really doesn't correlate\nsuccess\nso what even if you look at sort of\nthese meta-analyses\num\nthe purpose of this article is to\nexamine whether therapy process and\noutcome are influenced by client\ntherapist ethnicity language or gender\nmatch a review research in this area\ndoes not demonstrate support for a\nclient therapist match on any of these\nvariables\nright like what the\nokay\nso i like this\nthis thing says that there is\nso what this essentially says this this\narticle says that\nif you want to be a successful therapist\nit's not about match\nbeing a successful therapist is about\nadapting to the client's world view\nit's not about matching people we see\nsuccess when the therapist adapts to the\nclient\nthis paper i really love\nbecause this paper wants to say\nwe can match\nbut it bends over backwards in order to\nmake this argument\nokay i'm going to read this okay it's\ngoing to be a bit technical\num\nso unfortunately most of this research\nhas dealt with analog populations of\nclients and or therapists quasi therapy\nenvironments and criteria that are far\nremoved from those used to judge\nclinical settings\nas a result of such disparity among\nmethods and propulsions the results of\nthis research in this area are far from\nconsistent\ndo you guys understand what this is\nactually saying\nthis is saying we weren't able to find a\nclear effect\nand then they go on to say nonetheless\nif we ignore all the reasons why the\nresearch is bad and we can't really come\nto a conclusion if one considers the\nonly the most clinically relevant\nstudies\nsome tentative conclusions do emerge do\nyou understand what this paper is saying\nthis paper is like here's a body of\nevidence if we discard most of it and we\nchoose to have a selection bias\ntentative conclusions do emerge\nand then they go on to conclude namely\ndemographic similarity between client\nand therapist facilitates positive\nperceptions of the relationship so then\nthey form a conclusion they're like oh\nfacilitates positive perceptions\nenhances commitment to remaining in\ntherapy in treatment especially among\ndisadvantaged groups but\nthese this sentence right here these\ncouple sentences on the left basically\nare like this isn't even correct\ncherry picking at its finest well said\nas borealis\nso this is what's so confusing\nis that when we look at like and if we\nlook at the therapy relationship and we\ncan we can go on so this looks at other\nthis thing for example finds\nthis defensive style and internal\nexternal focus does\npredict outcomes\nuh matching patient reactants potential\nthe therapist directiveness does not\naffect outcomes it's just like another\npaper for the sake of completeness\nthe key takeaway here is that if we look\nat the client doctor client relationship\nor the like the therapist client\nrelationship\nit's a relationship that like\ncommunication and intimacy and alliance\nand like all this like interpersonal\nstuff really matters\nand people for a long time were like\nokay like if i'm an indian therapist i'm\ngonna do better with an indian client\nbecause i understand what it means to be\nindian if i'm a gay therapist i'll do\nbetter with a gay client because i\nunderstand what it means to be gay if\ni'm a man i'll do better at working with\nmen\nwe have all these assumptions\nabout boxes that we can check and how\nthey form relationships\nit turns out when you actually look at\nthe data\nit doesn't work like that\nand what really forms connections is not\nsomething that we know how to measure\nbut this is the main thing that dating\napps do not i think they understand it\nthey just don't tell anyone\nright because there's only certain\nthings that we can measure so we're\ngoing to let you fill out a profile but\nlike we know\non the back end if you look at the data\nwe know that like nothing that you're\nfilling out is actually going to\ncorrelate with relationship success\nbecause we can't actually measure the\nstuff we can't build a profile that will\nallow you to successfully match people\nwhich is staggering for people and now\nthen what happens is we start forming\nselections\nbased on what can be measured but\nremember what can be measured doesn't\nactually correlate with like\nrelationship success so now we start\nfiltering people based on things like\nreligion\nwe start filtering people based on\nheight we start filtering people based\non income or we start filtering people\nbased on political beliefs\nand because we're\nhow do we filter people we filter people\nbased on what the app lets us filter\npeople with\nand so essentially what we're doing is\nwe're making selections\nthat don't correlate with actual\nrelationship success\nand this is the fundamental problem with\nonline dating\nthe most fundamental problem is it gives\nus this idea that if i build a profile\npeople will be able to select and i will\nbe able to select based on other\npeople's profiles\nobviously\nthere's a key thing that's missing here\nwhich is that your selection may have\nnothing to do\nwith the actual likelihood that your\nrelationship succeeds\nand if we look at comparable\ni mean this is a stretch obviously so\nthe therapist client relationship is not\nexact is far from you know a romantic\nrelationship it should be anyway\nbut it's still like a deeply personal\nrelationship and we sort of know from\nrelationship matching metrics right\nbecause the other thing about the dating\napps is they're not going to publish\ntheir internal research\nso they can make all kinds of claims but\nyou're never going to get peer-reviewed\nstudies on these factors\nright and like why not it's because on\nthe back end the whole freaking thing\nmay be an absolute scam and if you\nactually give your data set to\nthird-party researchers to look at it\nthey'll say hey none of this crap\nactually works and then the dating app\nis like well then we don't have a\nservice that people are willing to\nif if people realize it doesn't work\nlike no one's gonna use our apps there's\nno way that they're going to do that\nthey're not going to publish their\noutcomes\nright what they're all going to say is\nwe have these proprietary metrics\nproprietary which is sort of fair and\ni'm sure that they're trying to figure\nit out i just don't know that like we\ncan capture this stuff in the way that\nyou know\nlike is actually useful to people and\nthen people get really frustrated with\nonline dating and they sort of think\nlike okay i'm screwing up or people are\nright like you think the world is\nterrible or like i'm incompetent or\nsomething you either blame the person on\nthe other end of the app or you blame\nyourself whereas the truth is the whole\nsystem is screwed up\nso actually i think a good example of\nsomeone who does this well ironically i\nmean take this with a grain of salt\nis i understand that grinder\nactually filters based on location\nand distance\nso like what they've actually done is\nrealized that the most important\nvariable is like the distance between\ntwo people\nright which is like sort of makes sense\nand this is this is where it's kind of\ninteresting because here's an\ninteresting statistic\ni don't know i may be a little bit rusty\non this but you know what drastically\nwhat variable of a relationship\ndrastically increases\nthe likelihood of divorce\ni want to say it includes includes the\nlikelihood of increases the likelihood\nof divorce by between 50 and 100\nguesses\nwhat do people think\nbanter addiction\nhaving kids\na commute longer than 45 minutes\ncan you believe that a commute\na friggin commute longer than 45 minutes\ndrastically increases the likelihood of\ndivorce\nbut like\nthe dating app doesn't have that as a\ncriteria this is actually what\ncorrelates with divorce\nis having a commute that's longer than\n45 minutes\nso we don't know what actually makes a\nsuccessful relationship\ni i mean we sort of do it's\ncommunication skills i think is the most\nimportant thing\nbut like this is the this is why dating\nis so screwed up because like it's it's\ngiving us all of these preferences\nthat don't correlate with the actual\nthing that we're using the dating app\nfor which is to find a relationship\nyou're looking for hookups and so that's\nalso where grinder may be a little bit\ndifferent like who knows\nright and so then we spend so much time\nand then like the other thing that\nhappens is like it reinforces all these\nnegative ideas oh yeah women like don't\ndate me because of my jawline or because\ni'm not a sigma alpha beta omnicron\nomni theta\ndelta beta\nmale\nbut like and people like form all these\nideas where it's like no it has nothing\nto do with your jawline it's just like\nyou don't know how to like communicate\nwith people\nright\nright\nand so like we formulate all these\ndifferent things but like the thing is\nlike all that crap the sigma male alpha\nmale beta male theta male fouda male\nomnicron\nright\nmorpheus male that's great\nmorbid mail\nmorbid mail should be like a competitor\nfor gmail\nevery time you open up an email it's\nmorbid time\nso here like okay so big takeaways\nfirst thing to understand is that\nif you think that you're dating success\nis determined by everything that happens\nbefore you meet the person\nchances are you're wrong\nso this is like my profession it's not\nthat it doesn't matter\nit's that like everyone's focusing on\neverything before you even meet the\nperson whereas if you really think about\na relationship relationship starts with\nlike meeting a person and communicating\nin interaction\nso everyone sort of assumes that okay\nlike if my jawline isn't good enough or\ni don't make enough money or i'm not six\nfeet tall or this kind of crap then like\ni'm doomed to be alone it's just not the\ncase because that's not like we have a\nlot of data that shows that people who\nare in your book get a lot of\nwomen and you don't because you're a\nnice guy\nand it's not about being a nice guy or\nbeing an it's about how you\ncommunicate and interact with an actual\nhuman being\nand you look at these these like dating\nprofiles and it hurts right because\nyou're not six feet tall\nand you see all these profiles out there\nthat are women looking for men who are\nsix feet tall\nor men who are looking for women who are\nlike five foot two and are like\ninstagram models or whatever\nand so both sides of the equation\nthere's a lot of judgment because these\nare the things that we can measure this\nis what we can build a profile based on\nand there's an assumption that selecting\nsomeone's pro based on profile things\nwill correlate with the likelihood of a\nsuccessful relationship\nthat fundamental\nassumption i do not know is correct\ni haven't seen data\nthat is overwhelmingly positive in that\nthat even selecting based on these\ncriteria leads to successful\nrelationship\nand even when i look at successful\nrelationships what i tend to find is\nthat there's like at least one red flag\nand the key thing about those\nrelationships is that despite the fact\nthat there's a red flag the people work\nthrough that red flag together\nand that's when the relationship becomes\nreally strong\nso for example i do a lot of addiction\nwork\nsometimes what that means is the people\nwho\nare married in my office or addicts\nor hopefully you're in recovery\nand what i tend to find is like yeah it\nsucks to be like addicted to heroin and\nit sucks to be married to someone who's\naddicted to heroin but both of y'all got\ntogether you decided that you loved each\nother enough and you were going to give\nthis a try both of you all set your egos\naside you set particular boundaries you\nkind of screwed up a little bit but you\ngave it an honest effort and then two\nyears later you've been sober for two\nyears and you decide to get married and\nlike that's a strong relationship\nif you think a little bit about that\nlike what how do you correlate that to a\ndating app\nby the way i'm an addict by the way i'm\nwilling to date addicts\nno like that's ridiculous\nright like you don't\nyou know\nso what actually leads to successful\nrelationships is not something that\ndating app profiles can necessarily\ncapture\nand then we got it all bent out of shape\nbecause we don't have a good enough\nprofile or there are people who are\nlooking for things in their profile it\ndoesn't friggin matter\nat the end of the day it's about how you\ncommunicate and interact with an\nindividual human being end of story\nand there's research to even suggest\nthat all this kind of demographic\nmatching at least in terms of client\ntherapist and you can make an argument\nthat that's not the case for\nromantic relationships but i think we're\nsort of seeing that people are willing\nto\nyou'll have people of mixed race couples\nyou'll have mixed religion couples\nyou'll have mixed diet couples and\nyou'll have people who are not those\nmixed things\nright you'll have ethnically homogeneous\ncouples you'll have religiously\nhomogeneous couples you'll have diet\nhomogeneous couples\nand so if we have both versions what\nthat sort of concludes\nis that there may not like that's not\nrestrictive like because we see both\nversions we'll see a mixed race couple\nand we'll see homogeneous race couple\nergo race may not be an important factor\nit's really just about how you\ncommunicate in either of those\nsituations\ndoes that make sense so if you're\nstruggling to date like don't get\nresentful just because you're less than\nsix feet i mean i understand it's okay\nto get resentful but like just because\nyou get resentful doesn't mean that\nthat's the reason that you're single and\nthere's a lot of stuff that you can\nstill work on and chances are\nif you're like resentful towards you\nknow the group of people that you're\ndating like focus on interpersonal\nskills\nwhat is it like to spend an hour with\nyou is it fun\nwhat is it like to spend an hour with\nthe other\nperson do you know how to do things like\nset and respect boundaries\ndo you know how to do things like listen\nand talk do you know how to do things\nlike be emotionally available\nbut also be able to turn off your\nemotional availability when the other\nperson like needs you to like\nself-compose\nbecause sometimes people are in\nrelationships and they're like\nemotionally available they wear their\nemotional emotions on their sleeve\nand they can never turn their emotions\noff\nso my emotions are out there all the\ntime gushing out and then it can be\noverwhelming for the other person so\nwhat you've got to do is be able to turn\non and off emotions\nright these are the core things that a\nrelationship is built around\ndo you have a big pp so this is another\ncommon thing so let's just understand\nthis quickly\nso it's my understanding that there are\npeople out there at pride month who are\nlesbians and they have very satisfying\nsex lives and it turns out that their\npps are incredibly small in fact\nnon-existent\nright so all these kinds of myths about\nstuff like penis size and stuff like\nthat like it's just not like people can\nhave healthy sexual relationships\nwithout penises\ni i don't know like\nit sounds absurd i'm not trying to be\nfunny honestly i'm not trying to be\nfunny here but do you all like get that\nlike that's possible\nand so in terms of a healthy\nrelationship it's about like\ncommunication and trying to figure out\nlike how you can provide for the other\nperson how the other person can provide\nfor you\ni'm not saying that people aren't\nallowed to have a preference if someone\ndoesn't want to spend time with you\nbecause of the size of your penis like\nthat's on them\nand this kind of sucks for you but at\nthe end of the day people have healthy\nsuccess\nhealthy sexual relationships without\npenises\nit's like literally a thing that people\ndo\nand if they can do it you can do it\nis there a good way to use a dating app\ngiven what you talked about absolutely\nso that's a great question doughboy\nso\nthe main thing to understand about\ndating apps is when you go in\nhaving the right expectation\nso there's still a tool that's how most\npeople still connect but it's like\nacknowledging that it's a little bit of\na crap shoot the other thing is that you\nshould be careful about filtering your\npreferences\nso if you have particular preferences\nlike\nthe actual interpersonal the spark the\nchemistry is not determined by both you\nall having the same religion\nright there are people who have the same\nreligion or set of values or vegan who\nwill get divorced like you'll see like\ndivorce in like\nyou know based on demographic criteria\nlike you'll see divorce on both sides\nright so you'll have like muslims who\nmarry muslims and they'll get divorced\nand you'll have muslims who marry hindus\nand they'll get divorced\nlike it happens you'll have hindus who\nmarry hindus and they'll get divorced so\nthat's where be like a little bit more\nopen so i think the first thing is to\nunderstand that if someone is perfect on\npaper they may not be perfect in real\nlife\nand if someone is imperfect on paper\nthey may be perfect in real life\nso that's i think the most important\nadjustment to take away is to expand\nyour dating pool and to give people an\nopportunity\nthat you would normally filter out\nso if you have like a height requirement\nlike\nloosen it\nif you have an educational requirement\nor a financial requirement loosen it\ngive people a chance and recognize that\nsuccessful relationships are not about\nfinding the perfect partner\nthey're about each of you becoming the\nperfect partner over time because you're\ncommitted to each other\nlike you're not like any kind of like\nthis is the key thing which is like\nsomehow like lost this is another\nbias that the dating apps reinforce\nwhich is like here is who you are\non a single piece of paper\nright like here is what you are take it\nor leave it\nwhen you when you started dating me i\nsaid very clearly in my profile that i\nwill never watch\nmorbius\nand you're asking me to watch it\nlike relationships are about growing and\nchanging together\nit's not about two finished products\nperfectly fitting together so just i\nwould say like loosen your\ncheckbox criteria some and give people a\nshot\nand recognize that if you find the\nperfect person on paper that may not\nactually correlate to relationship\nsuccess\nyou"
