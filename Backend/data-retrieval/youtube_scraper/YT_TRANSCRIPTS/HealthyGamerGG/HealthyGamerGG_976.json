    "transcript": "so we're going to do a\nletting go of anger meditation for lack\nof a better term maybe letting actually\nno it is a letting go of triumph\nmeditation okay\nso this is going to be kind of weird but\ni'll explain to y'all how this works so\nthis meditation first of all is somewhat\nadaptable\nbut what we're so a lot of\na lot of when we\nget into trouble\nwhat we're chasing is triumph\nright so if we look at like this passive\naggressive kind of stuff like what you\nwant to do is put them in their place\nright like even if you think about\ntoxicity in video games\nwhen you tell someone to 1v1 me mid what\nyou're looking for is triumph you're\nlooking to win\nthe problem is that oftentimes in\nseeking triumph is when we actually\ncause ourselves the biggest problems\nright when you attack someone else\nbecause you want to put them in their\nplace is when you end up getting\nthey activate their trap card and you're\nthe one who actually ends up looking\nlike the [ __ ] sometimes you'll tell\npeople to 1v1 mid you and they will\nabsolutely destroy you\nright because they are better and you're\nfrustrated you're toxic you're\nfrustrated by losing the game and then\nlike you want to put them in their place\nbut maybe the reason you're losing the\ngame is because they're better than you\nare\nand so oftentimes i think we we talk a\nlot about letting go of negative\nemotions but in my experience the desire\nfor triumph gets us into a lot of\ntrouble right i want to be number one\nit's all ego\nso what we're gonna do in this\nmeditation it's going to have basically\ntwo parts the first part is going to be\na visualization of sorts\nso i'll walk you all through evoking\nsomething that makes you feel triumphant\nand then we're going to let go of that\ntriumph we're going to sort of almost\ngrieve it\nex like let it go let detach from it and\njust\nlet it go so that we're not\ncontrolled by that desire anymore\nnow in the letting go part\nthis is where things get a little bit\npersonalized\nso for a lot of these meditations\nthere's an evoking of something and then\nthere's a transcendence of that thing\nand in that transcendence phase this is\nwhere your particular\ntemperament or cognitive style\ncomes in\nso when i teach meditation oftentimes\nwhat i'll do is i'll work with an\nindividual and so i'll figure out okay\nthis person likes sight-oriented\nmeditations\nthis person likes visualizations this\nperson likes breath this person likes\nsound or there'll be some kind of anchor\nthis person likes mantra they like\nchanting\num\nyou know so we're not going to know\nexactly what that is so we're going to\nuse\nbreath and then we're also going to do a\nmantra\nor\nyeah so\nbut this is where for that second phase\nyou can kind of adapt\nthe meditation to whichever\ntechnique you like so if you like\nbreathing you can do that if you like\nchanting a mantra you can chant your\nmantra in that kind of moment\nbut in that transcendent technique as we\nlet go we're going to use whatever\npractice\ncenters us very easily okay so i'll give\nyou all just like three examples so one\nwill be a breathing practice that will\nbe focused on the navel so we're kind of\ngonna kind of breathe in\nfeel that triumph that feeling of\ntriumph down there and let go of the\ntriumph through our exhalation the next\nthing that we're going to do is focus on\nthe third eye so for those of you all\nthat like third eye practices and\ninstead what we're going to do when we\ndo this third eye practice is that we're\ngoing to see the nature of triumph we're\ngoing to see our ego involved in this\nand we're going to just like mentally\nlet it go it's not breathing it out it's\nnot emotional it's going to be\ninsight-oriented we're going to\nunderstand the origin of triumph and\nthen the third thing that we're going to\ndo is chant a mantra so i'll share om\nwith you\nbut if y'all any of the mahavakyas or\nother general mantras will will work for\nthis kind of thing\nso you can use my but we're just going\nto do om right so in your your mind\nyou're going to\nchant om or you can chant it aloud and\nyou'll kind of let that triumph go okay\nso\nlet's begin\nso sit up straight\nclose your eyes\nokay\ni'm kind of confused why everyone is\ncommenting on my appearance today but i\nappreciate the confidence damn it\nokay\nso sit up straight close your eyes\ni'm going to start by taking a moment to\ncenter ourselves\nso when we center ourselves we can focus\non our breath\ni\nlike to lean into my proprioception\nwhich is our sense\nof\nour position in space\nso if i raise my arm i can tell my arm\nis up here\nif i lower my arm i can tell my arm is\ndown here\nso even with your eyes closed you can\nfeel your body\nyou can feel where you are in space\nso i'm going to tune into that\nyou can feel your weight\nkind of going into the ground\nlet your shoulders relax\nlet your breathing slow\ntake a moment to work out any kinks that\nyour body may have because we'll be\nstill for the next part\nand now what i want you to do\nis think about someone that pisses you\noff\nthink about a person\nor a situation\nor resentment\nsomewhere that you've been wronged\nwhere there was injustice in the world\nsomething that makes you want to\nmake a fist and shake it\nand pick one thing\nsomething that really frustrates you\nand notice the patterns\nof the memory or the situation\nappreciate\nthe aspects of it\nyou may even notice that it's kind of\nhard to evoke\nthe toxicity that you used to feel\nwhich is noteworthy\nbut do your best\nand now what i want you to do is imagine\na scenario\nin which you will feel triumph in that\nsituation\nso you'll give them a piece of your mind\nor you will 1v1 them in mid\nyou dumpster them you put them in their\nplace\nmaybe they're getting into shape to make\nyou look bad\nand you'll show them you're going to get\ninto more shape\nyou're going to get into the best shape\nand then then they'll see then they'll\nlearn\nso let those feelings come forth as well\nthe sensation of triumph of justice\nvisualize what it would look like your\nmoment of victory\nif it was memorialized in a painting\nand now what we're gonna do\nis take those feelings the feelings of\nresentment\nthe feelings of anger\nas well as the feelings of triumph\nand righteousness\nand we're gonna imagine that they're in\nour belly\nlike a knot of different feelings all\ntied together\nkind of red and black in color\nalmost like a tangled ball of yarn that\nis red and black\nbecause there is something ugly about\nthat victory\nwe're going to start by breathing into\nit\nand then breathe out\nand as you experience those emotions as\nyou continue breathing let each one of\nthem go\nso in the first scenario\ngo through it again\nbut pause this time when you feel an\nemotion and breathe into it\nand let that emotion go\nand then the next thing happened in your\nstory\nin that traumatic event\nand breathe into it\nand let that resentment go\nin that way as you breathe\ngo through your resentful scenario\nletting each negative emotion go one at\na time\nwe'll continue for about 30 seconds or\nso\nand now what we're going to do is think\nabout the triumphant scenario\nso imagine that you've let all of those\nred feelings out\nso all that remains now is a tangled\nball of black\nand go through this fantasy of your\ntriumph\nas you imagine\nyour victory\nover the undeserving\nnotice that tarry blackness inside you\nand with each of those emotions as well\nas you go through your orchestrate your\nvictory\npause\nand breathe out that triumph let it go\ngo through each emotion breathing into\nyour stomach\nand letting it go\nlet go of your victory\nand now what we'll do\nis if you've\nhad experience with any kind of agna\nchakra or third eye practices\nlike charging the laser beam or other\nkinds of things through dr k's guide\nwe're going to focus on the point of our\nthird eye\nand we're going to drive our attention\nto it it's the space between our\neyebrows right about right here\nand now we're going to just notice\nwhile concentrating on that point\nwhat the nature of these feelings are\nso you don't have to actively go through\nthe mental scenarios\nwe want to focus on that third eye\ncenter\nand just let your mind digest\ni actually don't need to be thinking\nmuch at all\nnotice the nature of these things\nsee your attachment\nsee the anger and resentment that you\nfeel\nwhich is born of entitlement\nof what you deserve\nand that the concept of deserving comes\nfrom the ego\nand look for ego in the triumph as well\nsee how triumph is nothing but ego\nand now notice how\nin this space\nof calm observation\nthese feelings mean almost nothing to\nyou\nthat as you center yourself\nin who you truly are\nin this vastness of experience\nin this observing self\nhow the ego matters less\nand let yourself\nlet it go\nlet yourself\nlet go of the anger the resentment\nof the triumph of the need for justice\nrealize that this whole process has\nalready deprived you\nof peace\nthen engaging in it further will only\ndeprive you of more peace\nso let it go\nand now you can either out loud or\nsilently in your head\nrepeat the mantra om\nor a mantra of your choice\ni'm sort of feeling om namaha shivai\nis the appropriate thing in this moment\nshe\nm\nand use the mantra to seal this\nmeditation experience\nall of the peace that you felt\nall of the learning that you have all of\nthe grounding that you've attained\nuse the mantra to seal it\nand plant it within you\nand you've let go of it now\nyou need no justice your ego\nhas been let go\nand sit with the peace within you\nand now with a deep breath in\nand out start to return to the world\nonce again tap into the proprioceptive\nsense\nthe space\nthe the feeling of your body in space\nand as you return to your body notice\nall the\nwiggling that you need to do\nmaybe your\nlegs have fallen asleep\nmaybe you're feeling thirsty\nnotice all the sensations which are\nreturning to you now\nas you breathe in and exhale\nprepare yourself to fully come back\nput your palms together in front of you\nin namaste position\ngive gratitude\nto yourself\nand to the universe for allowing you to\nlet go of this problem\nto let go of your triumph and your anger\nand to see that there are two sides of\nthe same coin\nand by chasing one\nwe give power to the other\nthat resentment fuels the triumph\nin chasing the triumph fuels the\nresentment\nand with one final inhalation as you\nexhale\nbow your head and slowly open your eyes\nso a\ncouple of things\nthe first is\nsometimes this happens\nso i tend to steer clear of\nthe mantras and the spiritual practices\nthat have more of a religious background\nbut even then i kind of dispute that\ncharacterization because i think a lot\nof what we\nunderstand is religion\neven the term religion is actually like\na western and almost judeo-christian\nconcept\nso\ni sort of reject the premise that some\nof what i teach is religious in nature\nalthough from an academic sense you can\nabsolutely make that argument i just\nthink that that's a mistake on the part\nof historical academia\nso today i offered om namahashiwai which\nis absolutely on the religious end of\nwhat we teach so i don't think it\ninvolves believing anything in anything\nso let me explain a little bit so\nshiva is viewed as the god of\ndestruction but that's not really what\nshiva is like if you actually ask\nscholars of this tradition of the yogic\ntradition shiva is simply the word for\nconsciousness\nand\nsometimes what happens is these concepts\nget\nembodied within a god\nbut that's not really what shiva means\nlike the actual sanskrit term of shiva\nmeans consciousness\nand so what you're sort of tapping into\nis like that sense of consciousness\nwhich is free of form and\nsubstance and desire and all that kind\nof stuff so if it bothers you that\nthat's religious in background by all\nmeans discard it\nand at the same time that's just what\nfelt authentic in the moment so i went\nwith it wasn't where i was planning on\ngoing\nbut\nthat's what happens\nand so as chinese cabbage farmers saying\nshiva represents a certain level of\nconsciousness well said\nand so what we're\nshooting for is that\nas we transcend the ego we move one step\ncloser to consciousness and by invoking\nshiva what we aim to do is like move one\nstep closer to\ntranscendent consciousness\nand uh\ntop key\n007 was saying very new experience thank\nyou so much you're very welcome welcome\nto the stream um and someone else was\nsaying\nuh i don't wanna so pepe gus was saying\ni don't wanna let it go i captured the\npart of me that wants to hold me back\ni locked it and now i have control over\nit i can't let it go if i do all i've\nbeen working now for for till now will\nbe for nothing\nso this is where i'd say\nif you're if you don't want to let it go\nand you're not ready to let it go then\ndon't let it go\nso\nholding on to our resentment and our\ntriumph\nis sometimes what we need\nso there's like you know if i have a\nfive-year-old kid\nwho loves their blankie\ndo they need the blankie no\ndoes the blankie do a whole lot for them\nnot really\nit's purely emotional it's purely an\nattachment\nright they don't need the blankie if\nthey lost the blankie they'd be fine\n20 years later they're going to be okay\nso oftentimes and at the same time if we\nyank the blanket away from them we tell\nthem you don't need this this is for\nkids\nthat in and of itself is going to be\ntraumatic\nand yet how many of you presumably\nadults have blankies\nright we let things go when we're ready\nto so if you're not ready then hang on\nto it\nif you're not ready to let it go don't\nlet it go then lean into the agna chakra\npart and try to understand it\nright what is this why am i not ready to\nlet it go\ncan you at least see that the resentment\nand the triumph go hand in hand you\ncan't have one without the other\nif you're afraid\nbecause you've built up an adaptation\nthat involves control instead of\nsurrender\nthat's fine run with it\nand just be aware\nthat at one point\nthe strategy that you've developed\nmay not work so great anymore\nand if you ever discover that that's the\ncase\nthen come back to this practice\nand it'll be here waiting for you\nand you may discover that you never get\nthere you may discover that there is\nnever is not\nright that you should never get there\nthat's terrible\nthat the presumptions that i'm making\nare a hundred percent wrong\nand even if you get there that's a\nwonderful place to be as long as you're\nsure in it that's fine\nwho said i was the arbiter of truth\nso if you're not ready to let it go\nhang on to it\njust accept and notice that you're not\nready to let it go\nright that's enough for today\nso\nalpha inhibitor 98 is is doing different\ntypes of meditation okay or should you\nstick to one type both\nso i think you should try lots of\ndifferent kinds of meditation until you\nfind one that resonates with you feels\neasy\nand or lets you like enter a meditative\nstate pretty easily\nthen you should practice that one\nright so once you find something it's\nlike\nyou know\nshould i eat the same food\nevery day or should i\neat different foods every day and it's\nlike well it's a combination of both\nright you try a lot of things until you\nfigure out what you like and then you\ncan start like you know you get\ngroceries to make your weekly or monthly\nregimen you make chili once a month\nyou know you do salad once a week like\nyou figure out what your rotation is and\nthen you craft your meditation practice\nthat way\nright and the whole point the challenge\nis that what a lot of people\nthis is the reason we teach meditation\nthe way that we do\nis a lot of people are taught so a lot\nof teachers of meditation are experts in\none tradition\nso if you think about like who teaches\nmeditation\nlike usually like monks and stuff right\nor you'll have some trained teacher like\na meditation center\nand usually what happens is you have to\nget like certified nowadays to teach\nmeditation i'm a level three meditation\ninstructor\nand so what they've done is they've like\nadvanced very high in this one tradition\nbut if we look at it historically there\nare like thousands of traditions of\nmeditation if not more\nand so why like\nwhy are there so many different\ntraditions of meditation because there\nare lots of different kinds of minds and\nthe reason that so many different kinds\nof meditation have flourished\nis because different minds require\ndifferent techniques just like there's\nlots of different foods\nthe challenge is that as a society we've\nstarted to believe in experts\noh this person is an expert and even the\nperson teaching you is like i am the\nexpert i know because i've done level\nthree i've done level three training\nyou do not realize how knowledgeable i\nam\ni'm level three meditation instructor\nbut they've only been taught usually one\ntradition\nso what they teach you is their\ntradition\nand then what happens is people say\nmeditation isn't for me\nor they think they're bad at it and then\nthe meditation teacher tells them\nconsistency is important practice is\nimportant you'll get it eventually\neveryone struggles with this it's a\nnormal part of the meditative process\nyou'll hear about persistence and\ndedication\nwhich is like sort of true\nbut maybe the reason that people\nstruggle with it and maybe the reason\nthat it happens to everyone is because\nyou're a bad teacher\nor your technique is bad did you ever\nconsider that did you ever consider that\nif your student is having a problem if\nthe student is struggling that's a fault\nof the teacher not a fault of the\nstudent\nbut this has been completely lost\nin meditation instruction this is the\nway to meditate you can go to wherever\nyou want to they'll teach you their\ntechnique they'll charge you zero\ndollars a hundred dollars a thousand\ndollars ten thousand dollars\nto meditate the best way\nand if it's not working for you try\nharder\nright\nso it's been my experience so part of\nthe reason that i didn't become a monk\nwas because i couldn't find i mean i\nfound one place where i tried and they\nsaid no\nbut or they said later\nbut as part of as a consequence of that\ni went and i explored lots of different\nkinds of meditation techniques i went to\ndifferent ashrams in india south korea\njapan\nand studied a lot of different\nmeditation what i sort of came to the\nconclusion was oh like there's like\ndifferent kinds of temperaments\ndifferent kinds of cognitive\nfingerprints\nno two minds are exactly the like alike\ntherefore the technique of meditation\nfor no two minds will be exactly the\nsame\nand so experiment until you find what\nworks for you\nright just like you find what food you\nlike that happens through\nexperimentation and meditation should be\nthe same way\nmeditation tearless so we already have\nsomething like a tier list i don't know\nabout tears because\nthat implies that one is better than the\nother\nbut we do have if you all are interested\nif you check out dr k's guide to\nmeditation there's a segment on like\nhistory of meditation and different\nkinds of meditation so we break apart\nlike how\nwhen i'm working with someone\nthere's a set of different things like\nrules that i'll use in terms of\nrecommending a meditation\nso for example is this someone who likes\nto focus their mind or is this some is\nthis someone who needs curiosity in\norder to get their mind to focus\nso this is where you know there are two\ndifferent techniques and one technique i\nwill give someone a particular mantra at\na chant and that works really well for\nthem\nin another technique i'll ask someone\ndecipher the sound of the ocean\nor decipher the sound of your breath\nspell it out for me what is the sound\nthat your breath makes\nand what gets them to sit every day and\nfocus on it for 20 minutes is if they're\ntrying to figure something out that's\nwhat they need to get their mind to sit\nstill\nso that's where really if you want to\nlike learn meditation like have a\ncustomized technique\nyou"
