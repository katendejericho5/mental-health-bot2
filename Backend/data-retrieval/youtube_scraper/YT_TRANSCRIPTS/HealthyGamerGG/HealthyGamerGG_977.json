    "transcript": "rebecca i don't know you can't you go to\ngermany i don't know\ni cannot leave for one second without\nyou you're my baby boy you're my one\nchild that's not what the inner critical\nparent says that's what\nthe parent actually says right we love\nyou so much and so then like it makes\nyou feel bad you feel guilty and then\nwhat happens is like something subtle\nhappens okay so stay with me i don't\nknow if i'm gonna be able to explain\nthis but as you feel guilty you get\nangry at them because you're like\nthey're not letting me live my life\nright because the advice is you only\nhave one life bro you got to live it but\ni want to go to germany like i'm\nstudying germany german like i want to\ngo to germany i don't want to go to ut\nuk i don't want a government job i don't\nwant those things and then if you get\nangry at them if you start to feel\nguilty if you start to push back look at\nhow ungrateful you are you piece of crap\nhow could you not make your parents\nhappy they're your only chance they've\nsacrificed so much what the hell is\nwrong with you you stupid kid that's\nwhere the fuel for the inner critical\nvoice comes in\n[Music]\nhow do i try transcend my critical inner\nparents\ni 20 m am an undergraduate student in a\nsouth asian nation i live at home with\nmy parents and travel to and from for\nuniversity\ncontext i am an only child my parents\nwere are overprotective and they expect\nme to be with them take care of them\nuntil death does us part\ni'm a so-called gifted child i hate to\nuse the word but it is relevant so i\nhave to use it\nso not only do they expect an impeccable\ncareer but also an impeccable social\nlife\ni.e marriage to a good household kid's\nyada yada yada i am basically my parents\nredemption arc for all the things they\ncouldn't do slash accomplish\nproblem i feel burdened by the weight of\nexpectations expectations that are not\nonly theirs but mine as well\nbecause i have been indoctrinated to\nexpect real high from myself\nthere are these inner parents in me that\nare very toxic and since i will be\nsaying staying home for almost another\nthree years until i finish my uni it\nseems very difficult to be healthy given\nmy constant exposure to them\na conflict of the acutest nature do i\nbecome the archetypal good boy\nor dare to do what i want to do and be\ncut off and completely alone\ni know the typical answer bro there's\none life bro yolo do what you want bro\nyada yada yada yada i love that\nthe problem is much deeper than that\nbecause my parents are literally inside\nme criticizing every wrong step i take\ncommenting on my every imperfection\ndownplaying my passion slash emotion\ni am basically in a psychological prison\nguarded by my parents\nanecdote the other day my father saw me\nlearning german and he asked me why\ni said i wanted to do go to germany for\ngraduate studies the next day he comes\nhome and during dinner goes on a lecture\nabout how germany doesn't have any scope\nfor what i am studying and that i must\ngo to the uk instead\nthen he said better stay in the country\nand take up a government job\nit's got good prestige and you will be\nwith us then my mother added emotionally\ni can't live without you for one second\ntherefore you must succeed in the place\nwhere we are planning\nto spend our old age\nwhat do i do\ni like to believe that the sheer\nacknowledgement of all this shows that\ni'm in the right path dr k's words\nhowever acknowledgement and awareness is\none thing which is very important but\npracticality is another thing\ni want to grow to become a healthy adult\nwho is not afraid to take a stand to\ntranscend the fem familial and societal\nnorms\nor dare to be in conflict with my\nparents if that's what is necessary\nbasically i do not want to be my\nparent's perfect slave forever\nit ain't easy being asian\nnow when i say something like that\na lot of people will say well it ain't\neasy being of my ethnicity and i don't\nmean to say that being asian is harder\nthan\nany other ethnicity\nbut these are things that i've struggled\nwith myself and like this is a common\nproblem right like culturally it's like\nit makes sense\num\nso let's try to understand this\nthe first thing\nis that oftentimes in particular\ncultures\nwe are as this person beautifully put it\nby the way the person has a\ntalent for words especially for what i\nassume is a second uh english is a\nsecond language right not primary\nenglish speaker but they're\nway of a way with words\nso that they are their parents\nredemption arc\nright so sometimes in life\nour parents\nplace so much on us\nthe only child\nso as they say so beautifully burdened\nby the weight of expectations not only\nyours like your own expectations are\nhard enough to carry\nbut like you're carrying these other two\npeople's expectations as well\nand it's not just expectations that\nyou're carrying right you're also their\ninsurance\nyour their method of exit\nyou're their path to comfort you're the\nsource of their needs not just financial\nneeds because they're planning on living\ntogether\nbut\ni can't live without you for one second\ntherefore you must succeed in the place\nwhere we are planning to spend our old\nage\nbecause they're all relying on you\nsolely for their emotional needs\nso\nyou're carrying all of this you're\ncarrying expectation you're carrying you\nknow all this kind of stuff and then you\ninternalize it\nand this may seem kind of interesting\nbecause the\nyou know i'm not hearing that\nthis person's parents are actually as\nabusive as the inner critical parents do\nyou all get that like so they have\ncritical inner parents which seem to be\na little bit different from the way that\ntheir parents actually treat them which\nis kind of confusing\nso what's going on there\nand ultimately like\nthis person ends up in this conflict\nwhere\nyou know like do i live my own life do i\nfollow the typical answer which is\nthere's one life bro live it for\nyourself\nand they can kind of say like okay like\nawareness and acknowledgement is\nimportant but like what do i actually do\nabout this right i can i can understand\nthis and this person's done a good job\nthey've given us context they've given\nus the problem they've sort of like\nshared an anecdote they've laid it out\nso well but like at the end of the day\nlike dr k is saying like awareness\nawareness awareness but like i still\nhave to live with these people i still\nhave to figure out like what am i going\nto do about this\nhow do i manage these expectations of\nbeing a gifted child of the pressure i\nput on myself of the responsibility i\nhave to take a care of them\nand that's another tricky thing right so\nlike what am i actually responsible for\nbecause what this person the\nresponsibility that they're being given\nmay be different from what they actually\nfeel\ni can't live without you for a second\nhis mother says\nso\ndoes that mean that this person is\nresponsible for being with their mom\nevery second\nis this person solely responsible for\ntheir mother's happiness and contentment\nthere's a lot going on here\nand how do we think through it\nso the first thing that we're going to\ntalk about\nare the inner critical parents\nso\nit may seem kind of weird but\nthe inner the voice of our parents that\nwe internalize\ncan be one of two things\nit can either be the actual voice of our\nparents so we sort of learn our\nself-dialogue from what we are\nexplicitly told\nwe're conditioned\nto say these things to ourself and then\nwe start saying them to ourselves\nbut usually when i think about inner\nself dialogue that comes directly from\nconditioning\nusually the source of the conditioning\nis a little bit more distant i don't\nknow if that makes sense but if i grow\nup in an abusive household let's say and\ni leave at the age of 21\nthe voice that i carry with me outside\nof that household\nis that old voice i carry it with me and\nit's sort of the same\nwhat can happen actually especially in\nthese kinds of households is when i'm\nactually still with the people\nthe inner critical voice is actually\nwhat your parents don't say\nit's what's left unsaid that you fill in\nthe gaps\ni know it sounds kind of weird\nright but your parents may not be quite\nas harsh with\nyou as you are with yourself\nso you sort of interpret and you kind of\nlead betw read between the lines and\nyour mom will never say\nyou're a terrible son for leaving me\nemotionally alone\nwhat she'll do is make these emotionally\nmanipulative statements\nthat then manifest within you is like an\ninternally harsh voice how dare you\nright they it's kind of like if you guys\nknow basketball it's sort of like the\nlayup where like everything gets set up\nby your parents and that final part of\nthe inner critical voice is actually the\npart that they don't say that you fill\nin the gaps you finish it off you cross\nthe t's and dot the eyes\ndo y'all get that\nso it's the stuff that your parents\ndon't actually say\nand that's why it's the nastiest stuff\nof all\nright\nand so it's kind of interesting because\nlike it's not actually what they've\nconditioned you in a weird way it's sort\nof what they've conditioned you think\nbut it's not direct so i think that this\nis where like sometimes the self\ndialogue that we have is like directly\nconditioned from what we are told\nin directly abusive situations\nbut what we tend to find is that in\nnon-directly abusive situations and in\nmanipulative situations the harshest\ncritic is actually your internal voice\nbecause your parents would never go\nquite that far or they do so rarely and\nthen you kind of fill in the gaps and\nyou kind of carry it with you\nnow this makes it very very difficult to\ndeal with because if someone says\nsomething to you\nthere's at least the possibility of some\nkind of response or conversation or no\nscrew you or let's talk about it let's\npatch things up\nthe reason that this kind of inner\ncritical voice is so devastating is\nbecause nothing is actually said like\nthis\nso there's no chance for like argument\nthere's no chance for apology there's no\nchance for a resolution\nso you're kind of stuck with this thing\nthat like feels impervious\nright because if your parents actually\nsaid this stuff to you\nthen it would be clear\nthat they're mistreating you\nit would be clear that it's abusive and\nif it's abusive then you can fight back\nyou can say screw you you're abusive i'm\ngonna go live my own life but they don't\nsay that\nwhat do they say instead\ni can't live for a second are beta i\ncannot live for one second without you\nhow are you arguing against what are you\nlike\nis that a\nis that\nabusive\narabica i don't know you can't you go to\ngermany i don't know\ni cannot leave for one second without\nyou you're my baby boy you are my one\nchild\ni've given my whole life for you\ni'm making chapatis until two in the\nmorning i'm making everything i love you\nso much you are so perfect you're so\nsmart and so beautiful and you're going\nto have kids one day and it's going to\nbe beautiful we all live together and\nwe'll be happy\nyou know i love you so much i cannot\nbear to be without you for one moment\nthat's not what the inner critical\nparent says that's what\nthe parent actually says right we love\nyou so much\nthey're looking out for you\nthey have the best of intentions\nand so then like\nit makes you feel bad right\nyou feel guilty\nbecause you're like my parents have\ngiven so much for me i'm their only hope\ni'm their redemption arc and then you\nfeel guilty\nand then what happens is like something\nsubtle happens okay so stay with me i\ndon't know if i'm gonna be able to\nexplain this but as you feel guilty you\nget angry at them\nbecause you're like they're not letting\nme live my life right because the advice\nis you only have one life bro you got to\nlive it but i want to go to germany like\ni'm studying germany german like i want\nto go to germany i don't want to go to\nut uk i don't want a government job i\ndon't want those things\nand they want those things for you\nand then if you get angry at them\nif you start to feel guilty if you start\nto push back\nthat's where the fuel for the inner\ncritical voice comes in\nlook at how ungrateful you are you piece\nof crap\nhow could you not make your parents\nhappy they're your only chance they\nsacrifice so much what the hell is wrong\nwith you you stupid kid\nhow dare you\nthe fuel for the inner critical voice\nand it's so much more harsh than your\nparents actually are\nyou all get that\nso often times\nour parents will\nposition us they'll manipulate us\nthey'll like scoot us right it's kind of\nlike you're playing a game of chess\nwhere like they put your king in check\nand then you have to move and they move\nit again check you move again check\ncheck and you're moving you're pushing\nyou into a corner pushing you in a\nquarter and you can't fight back against\nit because your king is threatened you\njust have to move it\nwe love you so much but\nwe love you\nyou're so smart\nall this positivity positivity\npositivity that's closing off your\nfuture\none door at a time\nand you feel yourself getting pushed\ninto the corner\nand then you get angry with them because\nlike what is this crap and then you beat\nyourself up because you're not allowed\nto be angry with them how dare you be\nangry what the hell is wrong with you\ninner critical voice spawns\nbecause the truth is you were raised\nprobably in a society where like there's\na different set of values so let's talk\nabout that for a second\nso here in the west we think that the\nindividual surpasses\nthe group\nindependence matters most\nfreedom choice other people don't get to\ntell me what to do\nright\nthat's what we believe\nit's your life you only get one you\nshould live it for your benefit\nthat's oftentimes what it is the\nindividual matters more than the group\nand that's where\nthis is kind of challenging because\nthere's sort of like a culture clash\nhere because in you know in in the\nyou know the culture that i grew up in i\ndon't to a certain degree like i'm\nalways hesitant to generalize because\nobviously there's a bunch of you can't\nsort of stereotype but at the same time\nthere are like shared cultural\nphenomenon which have been\nscientifically studied and validated and\nstuff like that\nright so perceptions of mental health\nperceptions of independence perceptions\nof values of community over independence\nbecause your parents are coming from a\ngeneration because for like the last\n500 years in india or\ni don't know if you're from india it\ncould be pakistan or any other south\nasian nation\nright bangladesh who knows sri lanka\nbut\nyou know for for these cultures like the\nfamily unit is paramount so you do what\nneeds to be done for the sake of the\nfamily\nand so it's like really challenging\nbecause like what are your parents gonna\ndo if you leave like\nthey don't know what to do they don't\nknow how to be independent like that's\njust not something that they've ever\nlearned\nso this is where i think the person\nmakes a good point that like awareness\nacknowledgement is great but like what\nwhat am i actually going to do with my\nparents like what am i going to do with\nthem if i leave like how are they going\nto like what are they going to do all\nday\nright and this is where i'd love to say\nlike it should start with a conversation\nbut i think that's gonna be hard\nbut it is it is very challenging like\nthe situation that you're in doesn't\nhave an easy answer\nbecause what's gonna happen is in order\nfor you to like\nlike you're gonna have to rip yourself\nto a certain degree from the family for\nyour own independence\nand that's going to be traumatic for\nthem\nand this is the kind of situation where\nthere isn't\nyou know i do think that there's like a\npeaceful resolution here but it isn't\npretty and it isn't easy\nso i think that this is where like this\nis the challenge of like south asian\nkids or east asian kids\nor you know even\nkids from mexico as i learned recently\nright these are not just these are these\nare sort of like asian stereotypes but\napply to people from nigeria and like\neven like\nseveral caucasian nations struggle with\nthis\nso if it applies to you fantastic i mean\nsucks for you but we're gonna try to\nhelp you\nright we're like how do you explain to\nyour parents like what's going on like\nhow do you understand this\nso the first is i think you should\nunderstand that you know they are\nplacing unrealistic expectations on you\nand i think having a conversation around\nthat\nis very important\nso it's kind of talking to them like\njust asking like open-ended questions\nabout you know\nso\ni'm i'm\ni'm thinking that you guys are assuming\nthat we're going to have a joint family\nand you may not even be able to say that\nlike they may like tear your head off\nright because i was lucky a lot enough\nat least to grow up in the u.s where\njoint like some people of my generation\nlive in joint families and like some\npeople don't\nso if the joint family thing is not\nreally doable you can sort of talk to\nthem a little bit about you know you you\ntalk about so i'd start with something\nsimple like prestige\nso when your dad says\nyou should get a good government job\nbecause it has good prestige\nand so you should ask them\nyou know\nwhat what is the value of prestige help\nme understand like why prestige is a\ngood thing\nyou know just like start to ask\nquestions\nand this is where like i think for a lot\nof people like asking questions is the\nbest way to sort of get them to question\ntheir beliefs\njust trying to understand so dad\nexplained to me like help me understand\nlike how\nyou know if i had\none job that paid twice as much and had\nless prestige and i had another job that\npaid you know half as much but had good\nprestige\nwhich one would you advise that i take\nthis is also good because what you\nshould do is like toss in money because\nchances are that's going to be an\nimportant variable as well\nright and just listen to your listen to\nwhat your dad has to say try to\nunderstand it try to learn it\nbecause they have a good perspective\nand if your mom says you know i don't\nknow what i would do without you and\nthat's where you can say like yeah it\nsounds like\nyou know you really want to be close to\nme i'm kind of curious because\nyou know i don't know i mean because\ngetting a job with good prestige like\ngetting a job like outside of this\ncountry like going to the uk\nyou may not be able to come with me\nright away\nthere may be time that i'm farther apart\nfrom you\nthat may be a reality so this is where i\nknow it's kind of sneaky but what i\nwould really recommend is like because\nthe end of the day like y'all may need\nsome practical advice right how to deal\nwith parents so what i would do is use\ntheir values\nagainst their values\nso point out to them that you may have\nto leave right so like there are the\nvalues like going to the uk ah\nokay he's going to uk\nhe's going to us to do masters\nvery nice\nright\nit's like use money use prestige use\nleaving your country\nuse it\nuse all of it put them all against each\nother and see what floats to the top\nso you can say yeah like what if i what\nif i do graduate school in the uk like\ndad is suggesting\nwhat are you gonna do\nlike we better start thinking about that\nright because i love you and i care\nabout you\nbut what are you saying\nand then you if you really want to you\ncan even go next level\nyou know like\ni don't actually recommend this but\nso many years ago i had a\na teacher\nwhen i was training in psychiatry\nwho gave me a really interesting piece\nof feedback and she said alok\nuse your power for good not evil\nand i kind of laughed but i realized\nthat it was actually very authentic\nfeedback because here's what the evil me\nwould do\noh mom i'll never leave you i don't need\nto go to the uk i don't even need to go\nto graduate school the most important\nthing is family\nand i'll just get a simple government\njob it may not make very much money i\nmay not be able to get a very\nprestigious marriage but i'll stay here\nwith you\nbecause that's the most important thing\nright\ni don't actually think you should do\nthat but if you want to play because\nlike that's the emotional manipulation\nlike\ni grew up in these households where this\nkind of crap happened\nbecause here's the thing like\nasian parents\nyou know what their trump card is\ntheir trump card you all want some you\ndon't want some knowledge here their\ntrump card is the crucifix card\nthey love the crucifix card\nthis is the oh i've sacrificed\neverything for you\nah i'm so i'm suffering so much\nall for your sake\noh my god the crucifix card\nmom i want to go to the uk and learn\nthings and go have an in i want to go\nhave fun\ncrucifix\nand then like the crucifix card fuels\nthe guilt it fuels the anger it fuels\nthe frustration with yourself\ni gave birth to you it was so painful\nthank you very much\nsure warlock\nso what you can do is you could play the\ncrucifix card no no no i would never\nleave the country\ni couldn't do that\nmartyr complex well said\nright so you can i mean i don't think\nyou should because i think that just\nlike\nlike if if you want to go toe-to-toe\nwith the crucifix card you got to be\ncareful because chances are they've been\nthey've been playing it longer than you\nhave and know how to use it better than\nyou do\ni don't think emotional manipulation it\ncan succeed\nbut i don't think it's healthy\ni don't think it leads you in the right\ndirection\nright so that's where like i would start\nby just having conversations with them\nand really ask them for all the values\nthat they kind of\nthis is kind of weird but like\nthe reason that it's really hard is\nbecause\nyou have a bunch of values they're\nimposing all the values on you and then\nyou feel like you have to live up to\nthese 16 different expectations which is\nimpossible to live up to\nright that's why it's so paralyzing\nbecause it's like i got to be\nprofessionally successful i got to get a\njob with prestige i gotta have a joint\nfamily i gotta be mama's boy for the\nrest of my life\nyou know\nlike at some point i wanna stop wearing\ndiapers but then what is my mom gonna do\nhow is she gonna feel like she's worth\nsomething in this world\nso instead of trying to live up to those\nthousand different expectations\nstart putting them against each other\nrespectfully with your parents\nwhat's more important\ni'm being pulled in a thousand different\ndirections\nwhich one should i pick\nand hopefully through that conversation\na couple of things will happen the first\nis that your parents will sort of\nrecognize that like\nyou can't do it all and then if they\nstop thinking that you can do it all\nthen hopefully you will start realizing\nthat you can't do it all or that you\nneed to do it all\nthere's a priority list the problem with\nexpectations from asian parents is that\nthey don't give you priorities\nthey just give you check boxes and it's\nall of the above\nright there's not like you don't get to\nnot do something for the sake of\nsomething else you don't get to\nyou don't get to choose between math and\npiano you got to do them both\nyou can choose between piano and violin\nbut\nyou don't get to choose between a 4.0\ngpa and other things like no it's like\nall of the above all of the above all\nthe time\nyou're our emotional support you're our\nfinancial support you're our hopes your\ndreams your redemption are your\ninsurance you're everything to us\nbecause we have\nsacrificed everything for you\nright and so\ni don't know that they can handle the\nquestions that really need to be asked\nlike\nyou know here's here's the wild thing\ndo you wish your life was different\nwhat did you have to sacrifice to get\nhere\nright like they're not going to be able\nto handle this kind of question it takes\nmany many years of therapy to get indian\nparents to get to this place\nbut there may have been some sacrifices\nfor the sake of your kids that weren't\nworth it\nthey're not going to be ready for that\nfor years\nright it's kind of tricky\nit's always worth it\nso i'd start with like priorities\nand then there's also some stuff about\nlike limit setting and things like that\nwhich i i don't think that it's going to\nbe easy for you to implement\nbut i would start with priorities i\nthink that's where like the real that's\nlike the best way to start conversations\nwith asian parents it's not nearly\nenough but sort of asking them okay\nwhat's more important\nwhen you say that going to germany like\ndoesn't have good options for my field\nwhere do you get that idea\nwell chances are they're going to say\nthat because someone in their social\ncircle believes that that's going to be\nthe answer i doubt they've actually done\nthe research\nwell so-and-so son went to uk and he\ndoes very good job now\nthat's why\nokay so what you're telling me is based\non the experience of one person you're\ntelling me that i should not go to\ngermany\ndon't argue with them just make sure you\nunderstand what they're saying no but\neveryone goes to uk uk you will be\nbetter it will be better\ni can tell you\nlots of good opportunity in uk\nhow much do you understand about the\nthe opportunity in germany\nthere's not much\nhow do you know that\nwell we don't know anyone who's gone to\ngermany oh i see\nso because we don't know anyone who's\ndone it that means that\nthere's nothing worth it worth it there\nright just clarify for them\nand then chances are what they'll do is\nthey'll try to like\ni don't know how to say this they'll try\nto squeeze out of it they're going to be\nslippery they're like okay fine you can\ngo to germany if you want\ni didn't say i mean i know i talked\nearly about wanting to go to germany i'm\nnot saying that i'm going to germany i'm\njust wondering how you understand\nwhat the opportunity in germany is\nno go fine you want to go go\ndo what you want\ni'm confused like you seem upset\ndid i\ndid i say something wrong\ni'm just trying to understand because\nyou seem very confident that i should go\nto uk and germany i'm just trying to\nunderstand how i'd like to learn from\nyou papa\nplay that i'd like to learn from you\ncard\nbecause sometimes if you ask questions\nthey don't have a leg to stand on\nthey're gonna get upset\nokay that's\nmore sith lord dr k version\nlike that's enough to get you started\ni think we should maybe we do dr k's\nguide to talking to asian parents\nbut like\nthey're gonna like respond emotionally\nright so you're gonna like calm down\nyou're not gonna take the bait you're\ngonna be like oh i was just trying to\nunderstand it seems like my questions\nare upsetting you\ni just wanted to learn\nwhy the uk was better than germany and\nwhat i'm hearing is that we know a lot\nof people who've gone to the uk and we\ndon't know many people who've gone to\ngermany\nthat's okay right doesn't mean that\nwe're not settling on uk we're not\nsettling on germany but you have sort of\nopened the door a little bit in the\nconversation there was kind of like this\nvery very like unfortunate concession of\nokay fine you go to germany\nwe're not going to take that bait\nbut we're glad it was offered even\nthough it's like a bitter it's like a\npoison pill\nit's like go ahead eat your piece of\ncake it's laced with cyanide\nso you don't want to take it right you\nwant to be respectful and be like oh no\nno that's fine\nyou know so like start conversations\ntalk about priorities\nask questions you're 20 years old\nyou know you're gonna like\nyou're gonna have a couple years before\nyou can cut the umbilical cord you don't\nneed to do it when you're 20. you've got\nthree years\nright you're still in university so\nstart the conversations today keep\nhaving them\nand over time hopefully what'll happen\nis they'll start to respect you they'll\nstart to respect your way of thinking\nand then you can start to ask them\nquestions\nright you can start to ask them\nquestions about\nlike what you should do\nand like frame them options or subtle\nthings that you can do and that's when\nyour mom will be so you can say like mom\ni'm thinking about you know applying to\ngraduate school in the uk\nbecause dad told me to\nand also in germany\nbut i'm trying to figure out like\nare you gonna be okay if i go study\nabroad\nhow are we gonna handle that like what\nare we gonna do about that\nand so you can approach things from a\nproblem-solving aspect\nwhere as long as you kind of like\nacknowledge their values you can still\nlike move the life in the way that you\nwant to and at some point you may\nactually have to like\nsay no to things\nbut i think that\nthat this is a couple of advantages\nabout asian culture which is that asian\nculture is conflict avoidant and face\nsaving\nso as long as you give people an out and\nyou give them like the opportunity to\nplay the crucifix card like you'll like\nyou can navigate it it's doable and what\ndo i mean by that oh mom it's gonna be\nso hard for you\nif i go to the uk\nyou know i i know you you've given your\nentire life and then like you're not\neven gonna be able to see me for like\nsix months at a stretch that's going to\nbe so difficult like how are you going\nto survive\nhere here's a crucifix card\ntake it take it play it oh beta is going\nto be so hard i know mom thank you so\nmuch for your sacrifice i love you so\nmuch\nyou guys got it does that make sense so\nit's doable\nnow\nthe biggest challenge which we've got to\nsay is that\ni'm having a conversation with a\nfictitious person\nright i'm having a i'm playing chess\nagainst myself\nso i can i can\ni can show you whatever brilliant\nmaneuvers i want to\nthe parents that you're talking to may\nnot be as compliant as the fictitious\nones i make up\nright and at the same time as scald\nglacier is saying it's so weird how\nasian parents act the same so i'm\ntelling you guys i think this can work\nlike it's doable you just gotta you\ngotta just like take it slow\nuse things like priorities if they wanna\nplay the crucifix card let them play it\ngive it to them let them play it for\nyour sake\nright and then you acknowledge their\nsacrifice and you express appreciation\nand then when you come from the uk or\ngermany or whatever you bring whatever\nprestige we\nwhatever plus 10 to prestige handbag you\nwant to\nbecause hopefully you're going to be in\na financial position where you can bring\nback gifts\nand not only because you're a smart\nperson what you're going to do is not\nonly bring back\ngifts for your parents you're going to\nbring back gifts for your parents\nfriends\nfor whom social status and prestige is\nvery important\nso that when you go to the uk\nlike your parents will be able to like\nshow off\nright and they're like oh like my\nbeautiful beta brought you he brought\nyour purse as well it's not as big as\nthe one he brought me but he brought you\nsomething it's better than your stupid\nkid is going to get you\nright so like you can\nyou can navigate it\nright you'll get me\nafrican parents a moment i complete like\nyeah so i've heard this from\nmy friends who are nigerian as well i\njust don't\nhave too many friends from too many\ndifferent parts of africa like nigeria\nand south africa are the two places but\nright and this is where like scaling is\nsaying like this is how you got to play\nthe game so here's the thing like i\nyou know i hate to say this but\nyou know like this person says\nlike acknowledgement and awareness is\none thing\nbut practicality is another\nokay\nand that's the truth of it\nand this is where like when we're\ntalking about social interactions like\nwe can teach all how to have a\nconversation but sometimes like you got\nto learn this stuff like this is the\nkind of crap that we teach to people who\nare executives at companies\nright there's like there's a lot of this\nlike stuff that you have to understand\nabout human behavior it's the way that\nit is\nand you could try to have super\nchallenging conversations you can go\nyolo you could say no this is my life\ni'm gonna do what i want to\nand you may feel fine doing that like a\nlot of people will cheer you on you live\nyour life forget about everyone else\nlike set your boundaries like enforce\nthem harshly and everyone else can go\n[ __ ] themselves\nthat's not how i don't think that that's\ni mean that can be healthy up to a point\nso you can set boundaries but you've got\nthese tools at your disposal as well\nso this is where like understand you\nknow your parents value system\nunderstand what matters to them\nunderstand how to have conversations\nwith them you don't want to be defiant\nyou don't want to be rebellious because\nthen they'll pull out the big guns and\nthey'll kind of like put you in your\nplace and the emotional blackmail will\ngo through the roof and you'll crumble\nand then you'll be like it'll be this\ntoxic resentful kind of relationship\nbut honestly there are ways to navigate\nthis where you are happy and they are\nhappy\nlike there are ways to do it\nnow it's all theoretical because i've\nnot never met your parents i've never\nmet you i have no idea like what what of\nthis stuff will actually work because i\ndon't know\nbut i do think that like considering\nthese things like it's not about you\nknow i can't tell you sitting here on\nthe internet what's going to work for\nyou\nbut what i can do is show you a couple\nof chess openings\nright and then you can take these chests\nand openings and you can decide okay\nlike which of these is going to work the\nbest for me\nthe least we can do is equip you with\nunderstanding of why your inner inner\ncritical voice is so bad\nand that if you want to deal with your\ninner critical voice which you need to\nlook at is your feelings of guilt and\nanger at yourself for not wanting to be\nwhat your parents want you to be\nyou may need to rewind and watch that\nsentence again or listen to that\nsentence\nright because it was quite a mouthful\nbut\nright because you feel guilty and angry\nbecause you don't want to be what they\nwant you to be\nand then you feel guilty for not wanting\nto be that because they've given up so\nmuch for you and then that emotion is\nthe fuel for the criticism\nbecause how dare you\nand so there's a whole internal\ncomponent which we can talk about but at\nthe end of the day your parents are\nhuman beings that you're gonna have to\nset limits with you're gonna have to\nhave conversations with\nso we'd like to at least get equip you\nwith a couple of openings\nand also i can guarantee you that the\nconversations are not gonna go the way\nthat they did here today with me talking\nto myself and my fictitious parent\nbut one thing that i can say is that\ni've worked with a lot of people\nfrom south asian east asian\nafrican\nless so latino but a couple households\npeople who have to set expectations with\ntheir family members\nand it does work\nlike you'll find a way\nright like keep at it don't give up hope\nbelieve in yourself\nquestions\nso most of a person says this feels too\nreal i know\nand what a perfect name samosa person\ngee i wonder where you're from\namir age 12 how are exp how are parents\nexpectations even justified considering\nyou didn't even ask to be born\nso i hate to say something that may seem\na little harsh but expectations don't\nhave to be justified\nthe truth is they place them on you\nyou've got to deal with them either way\nright like i have no idea what's\njustified or what isn't but what i can\ntell you is that people do all kinds of\ncrap that isn't justified you still live\nin the world where you have to deal with\nunjustified crap\nand it's incredibly frustrating when\npeople put you in places that are not\nfair\nlike that sucks\nand you still have to deal with it\nso i i'd like you know aside from some\namount of\nunderstandable resentment and\nfrustration\nthe justification they don't care\nabout the lack of justification right\nthey may have various justifications\nlike there are arguments to be made\nbut i don't find that those arguments\ntend to hold a whole lot of water\nright because you're always saying you\ndidn't even ask to be born well neither\ndid they\nthat's just the way of things\nso it's tough\nbut i don't know that the expectations\nare justified but they can still be\nplaced on you and you still have to deal\nwith them\ncubita goes to saying my parents are\ncuban and sacrificed their upper class\nlife\nupper class life to come here when i was\nyoung i was gifted a 4.0 student going\nto\njhu i've been learning these techniques\nfor the past few years and it's been\nrough it is rough right and that's where\nhopefully what you can do is\nacknowledge their sacrifice\nand at the same time recognize because\nthis is the really hard thing\ntheir sacrifice does not necessitate\nyour obedience but their sacrifice\nshould absolutely be\nhonored and you should express gratitude\nthat's what's so tricky here is that\nyour mom can sacrifice for you\nbut that doesn't necessarily mean that\nyou have to live life her way but you\nshould absolutely like credit her for\nthat right and even to a certain degree\nlike if she sacrificed a lot for you i\npersonally think that\nyou know my parents emotional needs are\nmy responsibility like i feel\nresponsible for that\nand so even if it causes me some amount\nof discomfort or unhappiness or whatever\nlike i try to take care of my parents\nbecause i know they take care of me and\nthat's what reciprocal relationship is\nlike\nthe problem\nis that when we have debt\nwhen we are indebted to our parents\nthere is an assumption that there's only\none way to pay back that debt\noh since i sacrificed so much for you\nwe're going to be joint family we're\ngoing to live with you it's going to be\ngreat we're going to do this this this\nthis we're going to map out your entire\nlife and we need you to live it and if\nyou don't live up to all of these 15\nthings that means you are not expressing\ngratitude i disagree with that that's\nwhere there's like option c there's like\nsome amount of compromise you can\nexpress gratitude that's where the bags\ncome in right you can do a lot for your\nparents expressing their gratitude not\nsetting firm boundaries with like not\nsay like harsh boundaries i should say\nit's okay to set for boundaries but like\nnot defaulting to boundary setting\nbecause there's an emotional component\nhere you can express love and affection\nfor your parents and you can you know\nand at the same time like tell them hey\nlike i'm not comfortable doing\neverything that you're asking me to\nand even at some point this is a late\nstage question they're not going to be\nable to handle this for the first couple\nof years but\nis it possible for\nyou know me to pay back that debt\nin a way that is not obedience\nis obedience the only way to pay back a\ndebt\nand that's where like if you can ever\nhave that conversation with your parents\nit could be very productive\nbecause that's the assumption is because\nwe did all this stuff for you you have\nto do all of this stuff stuff for us\nwhereas like there's there's like wiggle\nroom there right\nfluorescent pickle says you were talking\nlike i should care about their\nexpectations in the first place what\nstops me from just walking away from\nthem nothing\nso this is where you know i have a\npresumption that maintaining a\nrelationship is important to you\nso the advice that i'm kind of giving if\nadvice is what you call it it's like i'm\nnot hearing\nfrom the post\nyou know so even the poster sort of says\nso i'm kind of operating on these\nassumptions i know the typical answer is\nbro there's one life yolo do what you\nwant yada yada but you can even look at\nthe you know the the\nsarcastic tone of this\nwhat this tells me is that this is not\nan acceptable course of action for this\nperson at this at this time\nright this person isn't saying\num\ni do not want to be my parents perfect\nslave forever but they're not saying how\ndo i cut off all contact with parents\nthe presumption i'm getting from this\npost is that they want to maintain a\nrelationship\nso if you don't want to maintain a\nrelationship that's totally fine you can\njust walk away you don't have to\nf them in their\nexpectations but i think for a lot of\npeople out there they want to find a way\nto navigate the relationship without\ntorpedoing it\nand i'm all for firm boundary setting\nwe've even taught about how to set\nboundaries like it's very important to\ndo that but i also think that like if\nrelationships are important towards you\nthere are ways to navigate it it's not\nnuclear option is the only button\nif you want to walk away walk away by\nall means if that's emotionally the\nright thing for you like go for it\nbut if you don't want to walk away and\nyou want to figure out some way to\nmaintain some kind of relationship\nthat's an option too it just requires\nmore work\nyou"
