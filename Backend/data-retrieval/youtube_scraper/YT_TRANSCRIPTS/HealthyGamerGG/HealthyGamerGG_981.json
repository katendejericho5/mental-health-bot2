    "transcript": "the problem is that oftentimes in\nseeking triumph is when we actually\ncause ourselves the biggest problems\nright when you attack someone else\nbecause you want to put them in their\nplace is when you end up\ngetting\nthey activate their trap card and you're\nthe one who actually ends up looking\nlike the [ __ ] sometimes you'll tell\npeople to 1v1 mid you and they will\nabsolutely destroy you\nhas dr k ever made a video on passive\naggressive co-workers and man managers\ni don't know if anyone else feels this\nway but i would love to see a video with\ndr k explaining how people fall into\nthese traps of taking on passive\naggressive behavior once they get some\ntype of power in the work environment i\nthink a video in the format like how dr\nk did the psychology of a karen would\nbenefit employees with dealing with\nco-workers and managers that fall in\nthat category but also help employees up\nfor promotions not fall into the same\ntrap\nnot saying all managers but i'm sure we\nall have a story and could use some\nguidance on how how to navigate our\nemotions and feelings when dealing with\nthese people what do you all think\ni just really would like to understand\npassive aggressive more so i'm\ni'm not so reactive when interacting\nwith them\nthis is a fantastic\nrequest in a sense but let's talk a\nlittle bit about\npassive aggressive\nso\nthis is tricky because we you know we\nall experience passive aggressiveness\nbut once again like there aren't really\ngood resources at least that i've seen i\nmean i'm sure now that i think about it\ni'm sure they're out there but\nabout like what is passive\naggressiveness like where does it come\nfrom and how do you deal with it so this\nis just gonna be one take on it okay so\nwhat we're gonna start with is talking a\nlittle bit about where passive\naggressiveness comes from and the\ndifferent kinds of passive\naggressiveness\nthen once we understand\nwhat causes people to be\npassive-aggressive we can also learn a\ncouple of ways to deal with it now the\nbig challenge here is that most of my\nwork with passive aggressive behavior\ncomes from the people who are passive\naggressive\nright so if you think about like what i\nactually do i'll work with individuals\ni usually don't work with people who\ncomplain about third parties\nso the focus that i have is like okay\nlet's figure out your own passive\naggressive behavior and how to get rid\nof that\nbut we can sort of talk a little bit\nabout all of the above okay\nso\nlet's begin\nokay\nso how to deal with people who are\npassive aggressive\nwell\nmake sense good use of our time chat\nthey're so good at passive\naggressiveness i can't confront them ah\nyes we we will help you with that my\nfriend\ndon't worry\ndon't worry not all hope is lost\ncharming\nwe will not only give you some clues on\nhow to confront them\nwe will do more than that\nso first of all\nlet's try to understand a couple of\ndifferent\nperspectives on what it means to be\npassive aggressive and where that comes\nfrom\nso generally speaking when we think of\nwhen i think about the term passive\naggressive it's when someone sort of\nlike attacks you without attacking you\nright they don't say something explicit\nso there's a lot of like implicit\ncommunication\nthere's a lot of like\nnon-direct\nattacks and what makes passive\naggressive people so hard to deal with\nis like\nthey're doing crap to you but then like\nyou can't really like\ndo anything back because they're not\nreally attacking you\nright so it's almost one of these things\nwhere it's like what what a lot of\npassive aggressive people will do\nis they'll bait you into getting upset\nwith them and then it's all honestly\nwhat it reminds me of is i've been\nwatching some elden ring pvp videos and\nit's like it's like the the parry\nfollowed by like the critical hit or the\nthe repost\nright riposte however you pronounce it\nwhere it's like you know they kind of\ndebate you in attacking them and they're\nwaiting for it and the second that you\nattack them back\nthey play the victim they're like i\ndon't know what you're talking about why\nare you being so toxic to me and then\nthey like they like\nchunk away half your health or they one\nshot you so it's really really\nchallenging because you can't really\nrespond\nso\nhow do you deal with this so let's start\nwith understanding you know where\npassive aggressiveness comes from\nso we're going to offer a couple of\ndifferent theories here\nyou know this is just based on my\nperspective so the first is like kind of\na freudian theory so if we want to\nunderstand passive aggressiveness we can\nactually go back to freud and freud had\nsome good stuff\nso freud said that we have three parts\nof the mind the id\nthe ego and the superego\nand what he said is that the it is the\nart impulses\nright these are our are like natural\ndesires\nthese kind of base\nanimalistic\ndesires\nand then we have our superego which is\nlike our morality\nright this is our sense of like right\nand wrong\nit's like do i want to eat a\ncheeseburger hell yeah i want to eat a\ncheeseburger but i should eat this a\nsalad so the word should\ncomes from here the word want comes from\nhere and so often times in our life\nthere is a conflict between the shoulds\nand the wants enter the ego the mediator\nso the ego is what mediates conflicts\nbetween the id and the superego and the\nmedia the ego this i'm sure that i'm\ngetting some of this wrong because i'm\nnot an expert in freud but and then anna\nfreud i think freud's daughter came up\nwith a lot of these like defense\nmechanisms so this is where like the\ndefense mechanisms come in play\nand so what tends to happen is that\nwe'll have some kind of id feeling\nand then a defense will activate\nand it'll take that id feeling and it'll\nmove it into the subconscious\nand it'll kind of live over here and and\neven though this is kind of the\nconscious mind of what we're aware of\nso we're not going to attack anyone up\nhere no attack\nbut these like negative feelings will\nkind of boil to the surface\nand kind of create passive aggressive\nbehaviors\nso what i've often times found is that\nthe passive aggressiveness\ncomes from feelings that we don't want\nourselves to feel\nright so like if we're feeling\nembarrassed or ashamed of something\nbut like we're not willing to help\nourselves feel that we'll do some kind\nof like passive aggressive kind of thing\nso i'll give you all just a simple\nexample so let's say you know i'm dating\nsomeone\nand boy or girl doesn't matter there's a\nboys night out or there's a girls night\nout\nand\nin the girls night out of a boy's night\nout my partner asks me hey i want to go\non a boys night out or i want to go on a\ngirls night out do you have a problem\nwith that\nand then what i'm going to say is no no\ndo you should do whatever you want to do\nthey're like wait are you upset about\nthat do you want me to like not go no\nyou do whatever you think is right\nand then like it's kind of like this\nweird sort of situation where you're not\nexplicit about what your needs are\nright so you actually don't want them to\ngo maybe you're feeling insecure\nbut you're not letting yourself admit\nthe insecurity or acknowledge the\ninsecurity so it's floating around down\nhere and then you you get to this like\nyou do whatever you think is best\nand the person is explicitly asking you\nthey're like what should i do but i'm\nnot controlling\nso i can't tell my partner\nto not go\nbecause that makes me a bad boyfriend or\ngirlfriend like that's crazy like i'm\nnot jealous\ni'm not these things right so this is\nlike\nthis is a super ego thought\ni shouldn't be jealous i shouldn't be\ncontrolling so we do is we take that\ninsecurity and we shove it way down and\nthen it comes out with these kinds of\nlike no you do what you think is best\nand then they go out with their friends\nand then you give them the silent\ntreatment for a week\nand then it gets even worse because like\nyou know like and then they get\nfrustrated they're like if you told me\nthat you didn't want me to go you should\nhave just said so\nbut then you're like well that's stupid\nright because then i'm gonna be an idiot\nand so i'm acting like an idiot and then\nthat drives like you know the feelings\nof being an idiot\nget driven down here\nand then now we've got this thing and\nthen it just exacerbates the passive\naggressive behavior\nand it's just like a cycle\nokay this is one perspective so in this\nperspective what we really want if you\nwant to understand passive aggressive\nbehavior what we're going to do this\nwill become important later is recognize\nwhat could this person be feeling or\nwanting that they're not really letting\nthemselves feel or want or publicly own\nand that will give you insight into what\nwill trigger the passive aggressive\nbehavior\nbecause it's essentially passive\naggressive behavior is i'm not allowed\nto attack you but i really want to so\ni'm gonna do it anyway i'm just gonna do\nit passively that's one perspective\nokay\nso another perspective\ncomes from kind of relationship dynamics\nso sometimes there's this weird you know\npsychological stuff going on\nbut sometimes people are just\nconditioned\nto be passive aggressive\nso they'll grow up in in kind of\nsituations where like you know parents\nwill be emotionally manipulative\num\n[Music]\nand so their parents were passive\naggressive with them\nright where it's like oh no like you can\nit's your allowance you can spend it\nhowever you want to\nbut\nif you spend it in a way that i don't\napprove of i'm going to emotionally\npunish you\nin the future and furthermore i'm going\nto tell you it's for your own good\nso i gave you this money i didn't want\nyou to buy the video game you bought the\nvideo game and so now when you ask me if\nyou can go\nto your friend's house for the summer\ni'm not going to say\nno because you bought the video game\nwhat i'm going to say is the way you\nspent your money indicates to me that\nyou don't have the maturity to handle\nyourself and handle your finances so you\ncan't go spend the summer with your\nfriend\nwait but you told me to do whatever i\nwant to yeah i did and you did whatever\nyou want to but you're not indicating to\nme that you're mature enough\nso like parents will do this crap right\nwhere they're unhappy with your choices\nbut they won't say i'm unhappy with your\nchoices they'll twist it and turn it\ninto some kind of weird\npassive-aggressive bs\nand then what happens you grow up in\nthis environment you are conditioned\njust like you learn slang so i use the\nword y'all my kids probably use the word\ny'all\ni grew up in texas we use the word y'all\ni get conditioned to it in that same way\nfrom a relationship dynamic perspective\noftentimes people who engage in\npassive-aggressive behavior just\nunderstand that that's the way that\nstuff works\nright so you see this kind of stuff a\nlot in indian joint households\nbecause overt conflict is not tolerated\nso you also see all this like political\nbs\nin the household because you've got like\nthree generations of people living\ntogether you're living with your brother\nand his wife and their kids and there's\nall you guys don't make the same amount\nof money and there's all this kind of\nweird political bs where people will\nlike jockey for position\nso you'll sometimes also see this in the\nworkplace\nin indian joint households\ni imagine other joint households as well\nlike non-indian ones these are just the\nones that i have the most insight into\nfrom like friends and family and stuff\nright but like i've talked to people who\nare from southeast asia who go through\nthe same stuff\nso sometimes this is just the way of\nexerting\nlike influence on other people\nso a couple of things that will bring\nthis out\none is\nfeelings of territorial\nnature\num\npower dynamics\nfeeling threatened\nso at work\nif you outshine your colleagues on a\nproject\nthey may feel threatened\nbut this is also a key thing where\nthere's like there's no direct\nacceptable\nuh avenue\nto exercise\nfeelings\nso if i feel like you everyone says you\ndid a great job i feel jealous\nand there's no way for me to like i\ncan't fault you for doing a good job at\nthe company right even though it makes\nme feel bad makes me feel threatened\nmakes me feel less adequate\nbut i can't be like why did you do so\nwell this month in sales\nand so instead what i'll do is i'll say\nlike oh congratulations like\nyou must have worked really hard like\nthat's so good for you and inside i'm\nseething i start to feel territorial i\nstart to feel threatened by you and all\nthis passive aggressive crap is going to\ncome out because i'm not allowed to\nattack you\nright so the other thing about\nrelationship dynamics is what we see\nabout passive aggressive attacks is that\nit's a safe\nway to attack\nwithout retaliation\nso i'm going to start doing little\nthings like oh your clients called and i\ntake a message and then i never give you\nthe message\nright and i can just claim oh i forgot\nor i did tell you or i just pretend they\ndidn't call\nso you can kind of like claim ignorance\noh my bad\nright there's all kinds of like weird\nshady stuff that goes on and some people\njust manage relationships like this\nthird thing\nuh this one's gonna be tough okay so\nthird reason\nwhy people are passive aggressive with\nyou\nis because of misperception\nor\nyour\ncognitive bias\nso if you think people are being passive\naggressive with you at work\nnews flash maybe they're not actually\nbeing passive aggressive with you\nmaybe so let's think about this okay\nthis may sound kind of weird\nso\nhow would i know whether someone is\nbeing passive aggressive or whether\nthey're just not doing anything because\nthe whole point about passive aggressive\nis that it's no overt attack\nright they're not actually saying you're\na bad person or anything like that maybe\nthey did actually just forget to pass\nalong the message or even wilder maybe\nthey did pass along the message and you\nforgot\nso sometimes\nnot not kidding here is unfortunate but\nsometimes when i come in when i work\nwith people who say hey someone at work\nis super passive aggressive the more we\ntunnel down into it the more that we\ndiscover that the person actually isn't\npassive aggressive they're just not\nattacking you they're just doing things\nthat you perceive as a tax\nso i'll give you all kind of like a\nsimple example of this which is somewhat\nchimerical but you know i was once\nworking with someone\nwho told me that\nthey were getting married and this is\nsupposed to be their perfect day\nand they were like i can't believe my\nsister is making me look bad by losing\nall of this weight\nand i was like what\nthey're like yeah like my sister like\nyou know\nin high school\ni used to be thinner and she used to be\nlike kind of heavy set and then like\nover the last year and a half she's been\nlike\ntrying to like lose a bunch of weight\nand like making me look bad like in my\nwedding dress and i'm like what the\nwhat do you\nright but she won't ever say it she's\njust doing it to attack me\nlike that that's sort of the story that\ni got\nand and that doesn't it sort of doesn't\ncompute right but\nthis is where in the mind of this person\nand unfortunately not example all\nexamples are that extreme\nbut what we sometimes see is that when\nwe have insecurities\nand these insecurities feel\nattacked\nor threatened\nwhat will end up doing but they're not\nactually attacked right there's no the\nsister isn't showing up and saying\nyou're a fat ass that's not what the\nsister is saying the sister isn't really\ndoing anything to you\nbut the problem is that you feel\ninsecure you perceive it as an attack\nthere isn't some kind of overt behavior\nthere's no overt behavior\nand so then you conclude that this\nperson is behaving passive aggressively\nbut\nunfortunately if we want to be complete\nwhat we have to acknowledge is part of\nthe reason that people\nare acting passive-aggressive is\nactually because of your own\nmisperception and your own bias\nso sometimes the solution is not in the\nway that you deal with them but in the\nway that you explore yourself\nso how do you get kind of clued in into\nthis a couple of things is like\nwhen you feel like someone is being\npassive aggressive with you what is the\nstate of your internal security around\nit\nso if you feel insecure about something\nthere's a greater chance that this is at\nleast a piece of the puzzle\nwhereas if you feel very confident or\nsecure about something this is less\nlikely to be the case\nso if you feel attacked or threatened by\nwhat they're doing like oh this person\nis like you know you have to be a little\nbit careful there\nso sometimes the solution is actually\ndealing with yourself\nokay so just to recap when we're talking\nabout passive aggressive behavior we can\ntake kind of a freudian approach which\nis that\ni'm not allowed to act or feel the\nthings that i feel so i'm going to bury\nmy feelings in my subconscious\nand they're going to get kind of exerted\nthey're going to bubble to the surface\nin non-direct attacks\nand like\nthat's kind of where it comes from\nsecond thing is sometimes we're just\nconditioned to be passive aggressive\nthat's just how people play the game\nso you'll see this in certain kinds of\ncompanies you'll see it in politics\nyou'll see it in things like joint\nhouseholds and it's sort of just the way\nthat we jockey for power because like\nthere's no\nacceptable avenue for like exercising\nthat feeling either through discussion\nor direct attacks those aren't an option\nso all we're left with is like this\nweird passive aggressive bs\nas a technique it's a very safe way to\nattack without retaliation because you\ncan claim ignorance\nthese kinds of relationship dynamics i\nfind in the workplace are very very\nterritorial in nature and have to do\nwith power and feeling threatened\nso you'll see a huge escalation if\nyou're doing a good job at work and\nsomeone else feels threatened including\nyour boss\nright like if someone's feeling jealous\nor threatened this kind of crap will\ncrop up more\nso how to deal with it\nso this question was sort of related to\nwork so we're going to kind of focus on\nthat a little bit so the first thing to\nunderstand about passive aggressive\nbehavior is do you need a relationship\nwith this person or not\nso this is a very very important fork in\nthe road\nso if you need a relationship with this\nperson like and you want to cultivate a\npositive relationship with this person\nthen your approach is going to be very\ndifferent so let's say that the answer\nis yes\nso we'll use the example of like not a\nwork example but i think it's better\nillustrated by a personal example let's\nsay that your partner is being passive\naggressive\nso you don't want to just you know ditch\nhim and move on right like you have to\nwork through this so if you need to have\na relationship with them i i would start\nby talking with them\nand the key thing here is that if you\npoint out the passive aggressive\nbehavior\nif you say\nmom\nor dad you gave me the money you said i\ncould spend it however i want to\nbut because you're saying because of the\nway that i spent it i understand that\nyou have a rationale but you're saying\nthat because of the way that i spent it\nyou're not letting me go\nand what i'm also hearing is that if i\nhad spent it differently i could go\nis that correct\nand like the tricky thing there is that\nif you\nthe more you kind of you have to be\nsubtle with the way that you pointed out\nto them because if you point it out in a\njudgmental way\nremember the whole point of the\npassive-aggressive complex here\nis that\nyou're not allowing yourself to feel\nthese things\nso if you point out to them hey this is\nreally really inconsistent you're being\na passive aggressive [ __ ] what that's\ngoing to do is just reinforce like the\npassive aggressive cycle because you're\nlike showing it to them and like shoving\nit in their face hey what you're\nactually doing to me is due to\ninsecurity but they don't want to feel\ninsecure they're not letting themselves\nfeel insecure so what you may actually\nsee is an amplification of the defense\nmechanism and a worsening of the cycle\nokay so when you tell them you want to\nbe very non-judgmental about it\nand so i would just start by helping\nthem understand hey so i'm a little bit\nconfused like you know you said i should\ndo whatever i want to but you seem upset\nto me\nyou know are you upset did you wish i\ndid what i wanted to do and i really\nappreciate that you know you let me go\nout with my friends or that not even let\nme but i get to do what i want to\nat the same time i'm noticing that maybe\nyou feel a little bit disappointed in my\nchoice\nyou know do you wish i had chosen\ndifferently\nand you can use language like that like\nnot that\nyou were wrong but you know your partner\nis allowed to be disappointed in your\nchoices\nand then this is also where you can sort\nof use language like you know i'd love\nto\ni enjoyed myself i'm i'm glad i went out\nand at the same time i'm noticing that\nyou seem to be a little bit unhappy\nwhich is fine like i understand that you\nrespect my autonomy and the relationship\nand it's because you respect my autonomy\nin the relationship that you didn't put\nany limitations i really really\nappreciate that like i love that about\nyou\nand also like\ni wish i had known that this would have\nupset you because\ni appreciate my autonomy in the\nrelationship but i also care about your\nfeelings what can we do about that\nright so there's a way that you can talk\nthings through with them\nby being like non-judgmental kind of\nacknowledging what they're feeling\nacknowledging what you're feeling and\njust sort of ask them like how do we\nsolve this what do we do about this next\ntime\nwhat happens next time\nand by the way that\nyou know i use sample language but\noftentimes when i'm working with people\nlike clients or patients\nit takes some time and some work to get\nto that spiel\nright like how to acknowledge things and\nstuff like that what to acknowledge for\nthem\nso this is key so the first question is\ndo you need a relationship because then\nyou have to you have to like resolve\nthings with them now hopefully\nif you do need a relationship they care\nabout the relationship too so they'll\ninvest in having a conversation they'll\nbe able to tolerate having some of those\nnegative feelings whereas like if it's a\nco-worker who doesn't like you i don't\nknow that they're gonna invest that time\nin sort of fixing things\nokay\nso the other thing that you can do\nis appeal to a third party\nnow this is sort of like the least\ninterventional kind of thing because\nwe're not directly dealing with the\nperson because oftentimes what happens\nin if you are frustrated with a passive\naggressive dynamic chances are that the\nother person is more skilled\nat\nespionage in subtle warfare\ntheir special ops divisions are better\nthan your special ops divisions which is\nwhy you're kind of frustrated within in\nthe first place because oftentimes\npeople who are winning passive\naggressive conflicts don't complain\nabout them\nso i'm assuming for a moment that their\nspecial ops is better than your special\nops\nokay\nbut don't worry we'll teach you how to\nlevel up your special ops by the end\ndon't give up\nso if it's a work related scenario\nconsider talking to a boss or co-workers\nand what you want to do is\nyou know approach things in kind of uh\nlike i'm trying to figure out how to\nwork with this person way don't call\nthem out and don't attack them and say\nhey like this person is\nbeing a passive-aggressive dick to me\nyou know can you get them to stop what\nyou want to do is sort of like hey i'm\nnoticing that i'm having some friction\nwith this person have you ever seen that\nbefore or has this been a problem for\nyou is this like is it a me thing or is\nit like do other people struggle with\nthis\nokay so you want to sort of frame things\nonce again non-judgmentally\nyou want to frame things\num you know\ndon't attack them so you also want to\nframe things towards like especially if\nyou're talking with your boss like\ngoals of the company\nso if we're taking an example of let's\nsay that you're you did well in sales\nthis this month\nand this person is not delivering\nmessages that your clients are leaving\nat the office\nand so what you want to sort of say is\nlike hey i'm running into something\nweird\nkind of acknowledge\nyour own bias\nor shortcoming\nwhen you ask\nthis is really really important so you\nwant to say like hey i'm not sure if\nthis is like just me making a mistake or\nwhat but\ni'm getting like messages from several\nclients that some messages are not\ngetting through\nso when i'll talk to them they'll leave\nmessages at the office and they're kind\nof like not getting through\nand it after talking to my clients it\nseems like maybe this person is the one\ntaking the messages\num it may just be a coincidence maybe\nthey are passing them along and i'm not\nregistering them i'm not really sure\nso i don't know if this is a me thing\nbut i'm curious\nco-worker have you ever had any kind of\nweird problems with this person or is\nthis just on me\num\nand in the case of your boss you can\neven ask them like have you have you\nencountered any other stuff with this\nperson or and then you can sort of ask\nyour boss for help and you can sort of\nsay like you know non-judgmentally like\nmy goal is sales do you have any\nrecommendations on how i should navigate\nthe situation so you can ask for help\ninstead of blame\nnow there are a couple of important\ncaveats here the first is there are two\nkinds of bosses\nbosses who care and bosses who don't\ncare\nto be blunt\nand it's not quite that binary but\nsometimes it is so you all will kind of\nknow sometimes you'll be in a work\nsituation where your boss is just\nmentally checked out does not really\ncare about having people get along\nyou know they're just they're interested\nin certain outcomes or results and\nthey're like let the underlings figure\nthings out amongst themselves like i'm\nnot going to get into that crap you all\nsort it out yourself so if you have an\napathetic boss i would not go to the\nboss in this way but if you do have a\nboss who seems to care\nabout dynamics in the workplace\nand like seems to be like kind of a you\nknow nice person because they're those\ndo exist and they're not as rare as\npeople think they are\nyou know you can go to them and sort of\nhave this conversation you can also\napproach co-workers but this is where\nand this is where you'll kind of\ndiscover that oftentimes people who are\npassive-aggressive remember this is just\nthe way that they're conditioned so\nchances are it's not just you so like\npeople who behave in passive-aggressive\nmanners will do that with other people\nas well\nnow sometimes those people are very very\nsneaky\nand they're like the boss won't know how\npassive aggressive they are but\nco-workers will so if there's like a\npower dynamic oftentimes the power level\nlike the the tear above you will not be\naware of the bs that this person is\ndoing so boss may say no i've never had\nthat problem you can say okay thank you\nfor letting me know then i'll i'll kind\nof work on it myself\nokay so you can kind of appeal to a\nthird party and just kind of let them\nknow ask for help and the key thing here\nis that\neven if nothing explicit happens the\npower dynamic of the situation has\nchanged now you have allies\nright because if there are other people\nat work who feel frustrated by this\nthen like y'all are gonna sort of like\nyou know form an alliance of sorts by\ny'all will have kind of uh uh\nyou know a little bit of a um\ny'all will y'all will know something you\ncan maybe recruit other people and then\nyou can sort of even you've got kind of\nlike a team so now it's not like you\nagainst this person you guys can kind of\nlike you know\ny'all can outnumber them in a sense\nbecause a lot of times\npassive-aggressive people will thrive\noff of since they're not doing something\ndirect\nit's like hard to put together a pattern\nof their behavior okay\nso another thing that you can do\ngo aggressive aggressive\nso this is where you got to do a little\nbit more kind of diagnosis okay\nor reconnaissance maybe is a better way\nto put it\nsome people are passive aggressive\nbecause\nthey are conflict avoidant\nso maybe they're like you know these\nsubtle\nmasterminds of manipulation and stuff\nlike that\nbut i would say like 50 of the time or\nmore the reason that people are passive\naggressive is because\nthere's all this crap that they're\nburying right and they can't address it\ndirectly like it's psychologically\nuncomfortable for them to\nstate their insecurities\nto someone else at work\nor state their issues oftentimes people\nare very conflict avoidant and if you\nkind of think about it like you know a\nlot of people out there are conflict\navoidant and so how do you win in a\ncontest with them you engage in conflict\nis there a conflict avoidant you show\nthem that you're willing to throw down\nand if you kind of do that right\nthen chances are like there's a decent\nchance they'll just like back off\nbecause then they'll you'll terrify them\nnow is this nice not necessarily is it a\nlittle bit machiavellian possibly\nbut this is the kind of thing where like\nthis is the reality in some workplace\ni'm not saying that you should attack\nthem i'm not saying that you should do\nanything that's harmful to them but\naddress the conflict like\nyou can call them out or have a\nconversation with them\nand just sort of like bring it to the\nsurface because the way that these\npeople thrive is that they don't have\nany standing army but they've got a good\nspecial ops team so instead what you\nwant to do is change the dynamic of the\nconversation and actually like\nbring a conflict to the surface\nright so this is where even in something\nlike you know like a team meeting\nwhat you can do is just call out your\nexperience or call out the situation\nso you can kind of point out to them hey\nso i've got messages from four clients\nthat\nthey left messages for me and they're\nnot i just wanted to let everyone know a\ncouple of clients of mine have\num you know left messages that i didn't\nreceive i'm curious if anyone else is\nhaving this experience and this is where\nif you formed allies and they're doing\nthe same thing to other people in the\noffice someone else kind of mentions oh\nyeah like you know that's happening to\nme too\nand so that that's where like in the\nteam meeting you kind of mentioned\nyou're like oh you know like so i'm kind\nof curious does anyone know like what's\ngoing on here because i think we really\nneed to get these messages\nand then this is where you know like\nwhat'll happen is like maybe the person\nwill turn red and they'll you know\nnothing will will happen and that can be\nthe kind of end of it depending on what\nwhat research you've done and how much\nyou've set yourself up you can even kind\nof go for the throat you can say well i\nasked them you know who they're leaving\nmessages with and three or four of them\nseem to think that it's this co-worker\nhave you gotten any messages\nand then the person may say\nyes or no or like they're going to be\ncalled out like you're not necessarily\nattacking them you're just giving them\nan opportunity\nto share their perspective\num and then you know like you're kind of\njust showing them like hey i'm not gonna\nlet this crap continue right i'll call\nyou out on it they may defend themselves\nin some way we'll get to that in a\nsecond\nbut the the main thing is that if if\nthey're conflict avoidant you can sort\nof have\na conflict that is on the surface\nas opposed to subsurface you can call\nattention to their behavior and\nsometimes they'll like back off if you\ndo this kind of thing\nso there are a couple of very very\nimportant things here one is that you do\nso with a calm mind\nyou do so with a neutral tone\nyou don't actually attack them\nand we'll get to this in a second\nso what you want to do is like if you\nfeel emotionally upset by their behavior\nyou want to process that emotion outside\nof work\nso you want to come in calm cool and\ncollected\nand why is that it's because oftentimes\nthis\nstrategy when done incorrectly is\nexactly what they're looking for\nso a lot of people who are passive\naggressive\nwill try to debate you into attacking\nthem and then they will mop the floor\nwith you so this is classic like perry\nand to riposte critical hit\nright this is like this is what they're\ngoing to do so the tricky thing about\ngoing aggressive aggressive is that when\npeople are passive aggressive what\nhappens is they they frustrate you so\nmuch\nthey attack you so much they pew-pew you\nfrom on top of their walls impervious to\nattack and then you get upset with them\nyou get upset with them\nand then you attack\nthey claim ignorance\nyou've been parried\nand then you come out of the situation\nwith the power dynamic even worse\nbecause now they have they have\nexposed you as an idiot who has like all\nthese issues in their head but you're\nnot actually doing any anything like\nthat\nso you'll notice this especially with a\nmanipulative parents what essentially\nwhat they do is they debate you into an\nattack and then they play their trap\ncard which is the victim card\nno i didn't do anything\nwhy are you attacking me and your attack\nis overt and if your attack is overt and\ntheir attack is like covert\nthen it's like\nyou're the bad guy right\nand then you are the bad guy\nand then they've won\nthey debated you into attacking\nand so this is what a lot of\npassive-aggressive people do their whole\nlong-term strategy\nis to debate you into an overt attack\nwhich then they will mop the floor with\nyou with\nso what do you do about this this is\nwhere like this stuff becomes really\nreally important\nanything that you do with them needs to\nbe with a calm mind\nkind of factual\nyou don't want to directly attack them\nthis is where you can use a subtle\ntechnique of like making a statement\ninstead of an accusation\nor you can ask a question so you just\nwant to be like hey so my clients are\nsaying this period you're not saying\nthat they're actually withholding\nmessages or anything like that you're\nnot you're not saying that you're just\nsaying this is what my clients told me\nand it seems to be a pattern which is\nwhy i'm bringing it up\nit\nwhat you know what do you have to say\nlike i'm curious like\nis this my\nyou know when the first client said it i\nwas like okay clearly like this person\nyou know something must have just fallen\nthrough the cracks not a big deal\nsecond time the client sort of said it i\nwas like maybe the client is making a\nmistake but now i've had three or four\ndifferent clients who've all kind of\nsaid this and now i'm trying to figure\nout like what's going on so you want to\nattack without\nattacking\nright because then they can't play the\nvictim card the victim card like you\nwhat you're going to do is like get up\ninto their personal space\nbut you're not going to auto attack them\nbecause they're not going to be able to\nriposte because you don't want to parry\nso what you really have to do to do this\nsuccessfully is remove ego from the\nequation remove emotions from the\nequation\nyou don't want to seek justice if your\ngoal is to seek justice i think that's a\nlosing strategy\nyou don't want to blame them you just\nwant to point it out to them\nnon-judgmentally and depending on how\nbrutal you are you can sort of like\num\nyou know you can kind of debate them\ninto like more and more stuff if you\nwant to\nbut you can even do stuff like yeah so i\nyou know i was kind of confused because\nthey didn't know who they were leaving\nthe messages with or they said they were\nleaving the messages with you and i\ndidn't believe them\nso what i asked my four clients to do is\ni gave them the extensions of all four\nsales people in the office and i asked\nthem to call after hours and see whose\nvoice they were talking to and all four\nof them confirmed that they were leaving\nmessages with you\nand then you don't say anything else\nthen you just stay silent\nyou don't accuse them\nyou just say stay silent and they're not\ngoing to be able to tolerate the silence\nlike it's going to be so painful\nand you want to do it calm\nokay\ncool\ncollected\nand\nthat's how you deal with passive\naggressive people\nso to summarize\nunfortunately passive-aggressive people\nare very common\nsometimes and the reason for this is\nbecause psychologically the way that our\nmind works it's kind of like it's sort\nof how our mind works we have feelings\nthat we're not comfortable with\nand\nthen we stuff them down into the\nsubconscious mind and then they kind of\nbleed to the surface in ways that we're\nnot happy\nand we sort of result in this passive\naggressive behavior because we would\nnever attack anyone heaven forbid i\nwould ever do anything like that\nsometimes people are conditioned to be\npassive aggressive that's just the\nhouseholds that they grew up in that's\njust how they know how that's the meta\nthat they grew up in so that's the meta\nthat they know\nunfortunately we see these kinds of\nworkplace\nthese relationship dynamics a lot in\nworkplaces sometimes in complex family\nunits\nand\nyou know like part of the reason that\npeople do this is because like it's a\nsafe way to attack people it's a way to\nlobby for power lobby for position\noftentimes we'll see these kinds of\ndynamics arise a lot when people are\nterritorial or they feel threatened\nreally really common\nso\nthat you can use all of this information\nto kind of understand your situation\nright why is this person doing this like\nwhat could they be feeling like what\ncould i how could i manage it\nnow the last thing and this is what's\nreally tricky is sometimes when you\nthink someone is being passive\naggressive with you that's actually\ncoming from you it's not coming from\nthem they're not actually doing anything\nwhich is why it's passive aggression\nthey're not losing weight to make you\nfeel bad they're losing weight because\nthey were overweight their whole life\nand they've decided they want to stop\nbeing overweight\nor they're underweight and they've\ndecided they want to stop being skinny\nthey want to bulk up\nright male female underweight overweight\nall those things don't really matter\nthey're not doing it to offend you\nso this is the tricky thing is that a\nlot of times your cognitive bias or your\nmisperception will perceive other people\nas passive aggressive how do you know\nthat's where it comes down to your own\ninsecurities especially in the workplace\nand this is what i think is really\nvaluable about\nwhen like when we do coaching\nbecause in coaching\nhere's the thing everyone will give you\nthis\npeople will give you you can google how\ndo i deal with people with passive\ngrasping you'll get a bunch of\nstrategies\ni've literally never seen if you think\npeople are passive aggressive you should\ncheck yourself before you wreck yourself\nthat could be a cognitive bias on your\npart i've never read that externally\nthis is one of the key things that i\nthink we do which is why we get good\noutcomes is we focus on\nthe perceptual problems that people may\nhave\nokay\nnow how to deal with it the first\nquestion is do you need a relationship\nwith this person\nright is this someone like a partner is\nit someone that you want even in the\ncase of a co-worker if so trying to talk\nto them try to talk to them in a\nnon-judgmental way if you talk to them\nin a non-judgmental way what you may\ndiscover is oh my goodness\nthis is actually what's going on\nor you may just discover that there's a\nmiscommunication issue where you could\nbe doing something better they could be\ndoing something better\nbut approach them non-judgmentally\nnext thing you can do is appeal to a\nthird party talk to co-workers talk to\nyour boss once again you don't want to\nattack them you don't want to blame them\nright because that's going to activate\ntheir parry\nand counter-attack you so you don't want\nto do that you want to align things\ntowards goals of the company\nso i the reason i'm asking is because i\nwant you know this office to succeed and\nthese messages need to be getting\nthrough\nit's not about ego it's not about blame\nit's not about emotions it's like this\njust needs to happen\nokay\nso you don't want to activate their trap\ncard\nwell said super dark valid\nso sometimes as you do this if this is\nreally is the way they're conditioned\nwhat you'll discover from your\nco-workers is that like a lot of them\nwill\nhave the same experience and then you've\ngot allies\nso sometimes what you want to do is just\ngo aggressive so raise the conflict to\nthe surface so instead of having a\nsubsurface conflict just\nhave a conversation about it or\nacknowledge it in some public way\nremember what we don't want to do is we\ndon't want to get emotionally upset we\nwant to do it with a calm mind neutral\ntone\nso you can do it publicly if you want to\nbut it's not an attack you're just gonna\nyou know you're just gonna call out the\nbehavior and explore it in a group of\npeople if you want to and then chances\nare if they're conflict avoidant they're\ngonna like\nknow they're going to get really upset\nbut they hopefully will stop dealing\nmessing with you\nyou can even afterward be kind to them\nthat's actually really important\nso if they stop start giving you the\nmessages again you can say hey thank you\nso much for doing that i really\nappreciate it\nit's really helped me in my clients out\na lot\nyou know\ni brought you a muffin as a way of\nsaying thank you i remember you said\nthat you really like blueberry muffins\nso here you go\nright you can be kind\nnow the key thing to remember is that if\nyou go aggressive sometimes you are\nfalling into their debating strategy so\nthe the way that passive aggressive\npeople thrive\nis that they make you upset\nyou attack they play their trap card\nyou're the bad guy\nright and then like at the end of it\nthe power dynamic has worsened they have\nwon\nround one ko\nand now they have an advantage for round\ntwo there's a snowballing effect\nso don't play their game\nso approach with a calm mind be factual\ndon't really attack them you can use\nthings like silence let go of your ego\nlet go of your emotions\ntalk to your therapist about it talk to\nyour partner about it\nyou know process your emotions on the hg\ndiscord if you want to\ntalk to your coach whatever\nand then go in and then be calm cool and\ncollected\nbut that's what i got to say about\npassive aggressive\nokay\nit's not by any means a perfect\nrundown it is also not by any means a\ncompletely comprehensive rundown\nbut i would say that\nhaving worked with a lot of people who\nengage in passive aggressive behaviors\nand helping them no longer engage in\npassive aggressive behaviors which\nthere's a whole other segment that we\ncould do on\nbut the point here is that this person\nis saying someone else is being passive\naggressive with me how do i understand\nit how do i deal with it\nand the good news is there are a lot of\ndifferent ways that you can understand\nit and there's also almost like a\ndecision tree right is my boss\nlike is does my boss care or not care am\ni the only one who's experiencing it or\nnot experiencing it is this someone that\ni need a relationship with or i don't\nneed a relationship with\nand depending on all those different\nthings you can arrive at sort of a\nprecise solution that hopefully will\nwork for you\nthe one thing that's really really\nimportant is that you be aware of your\nown cognitive biases you process your\nown emotions you let ego out of the\nequation so that when you square up\nagainst them in some way whether it's a\nconversation and i don't know if you'll\nnotice this whether you're talking to\nyour wife or your husband or someone\nyour nemesis at work non-judgmentalness\nis at the top of the list\nbeing free of your egos at the top of\nthe list\nbeing calm cool and collected is at the\ntop of the list no matter what you do\nright so it's not just about owning\nsomeone else\nbut at times you have to\nyou know call people out on their\nbehavior\nand then give them like an avenue for\nescape right that's really important\nfrom sun tzu so that's where like you\nthat's why you say like hey this is\nhappening don't attack\nbut just say hey this is happening\nperiod\nand then when you do that people will be\nlike you have to give them a chance to\nmake excuses\nand then what you can decide at that\npoint is if you get you know if you give\nthem a chance to make an excuse and say\nokay cool so like it's totally fine i\nunderstand that you had a lot going on\num so i i'm guessing that this won't\ncontinue to happen\nright and they'll say yeah it won't\nhappen again you're like fantastic and\nthen you've established dominance thank\nyou so much\nthen you take that muffin for yourself\nthat's all ego\nright this isn't about putting people in\ntheir place\neven though you can want to do that it's\nreally about trying to deal with someone\nso remember\nthat if someone is behaving in a passive\naggressive manner with you like have\nsome compassion\nthey're not doing it because they're\nintrinsically an ass right they like\ndoing it because they have feelings they\nwere conditioned a particular way and\neven if they are being an ass you can be\na little bit forgiving doesn't mean you\nhave to tolerate their behavior you can\nput their behavior in check but you\ndon't have to hold harbor any malice ill\nwill or sense of vengeance\nideally at work you're meant to be on\nthe stream same team right yeah ideally\nbut oftentimes remember that even though\nyou're on the same team sometimes you're\ncompeting against your colleagues for\nthings like promotions\nand that's okay\nso i think it's really cool\nso i've had you know many situations in\nmy life where i'm competing against my\ncolleagues and that can be like really\nfine\nso like it doesn't have there has to be\nno ill will and that's where like\npracticing detachment and stuff so i\nremember there was a pretty prestigious\nposition which i applied to in residency\nand i didn't end up getting it which\nturned out to be great because instead i\nstarted healthy gamer\nlike\nyou know\nnot or started the work that would\neventually become a healthy gamer i\nshould say whereas if i had gotten that\nposition like i probably wouldn't be\nhere today\nbecause that would have launched me on\nthis academic track of academic success\nso that's the kind of thing where it's\nlike you know\ni applied for it i was like hey if i get\nthis position\nthis is what i would do with it this is\nwhat i want to do with it and someone\nelse got the position that's great they\ndid a fantastic job\ni went on and did something else\nso that's where like you can be you can\neven compete against your colleagues\nwithout any ill will and recognize that\nit's okay for one of y'all to win and\none of y'all to lose maybe the reason\nthat they won a new loss is because\nthey're actually better suited for the\nposition and i think they were better\nsuited for the position\nin retrospect i would have hated doing\nit\nright so that's okay\nsomeone's saying i think you made the\nbetter choice it wasn't my choice to\nmake but i was explicit with people i\nwas like hey if you if you pick me this\nis what i'm gonna do\nif this is not your top priority you\nguys have other priorities like you\nshould pick someone else\nyeah so a lot of people i would have\nhated this\nno seriously i would have hated it\nmaybe it's copium but i'm pretty sure\nit's not\nit's doing stuff like making call\nschedules okay which i i hate that stuff\nand now the more the more details i\nprovide the more defensive i become the\nthe deeper the inhalation of copium\nthe best scopium is true very true very\ntrue\nright so that's actually true so now i'm\ngonna have to reflect a little bit\nabout whether i'm just saying that to\nmyself\nokay um\nwe're past time but i think we should\nmeditate for a little bit are you all\nokay with that\nokay\nlet me think\nokay\nso we're going to do something\nlet me think about how to structure this\nmeditation so we're gonna do a\nletting go of anger meditation for lack\nof a better term maybe letting actually\nno it is a letting go of triumph\nmeditation okay\nso this is going to be kind of weird but\ni'll explain to y'all how this works so\nthis meditation first of all is somewhat\nadaptable\nbut what we're so a lot of\na lot of when we\nget into trouble\nwhat we're chasing is triumph\nright so if we look at like this passive\naggressive kind of stuff like what you\nwant to do is put them in their place\nright like even if you think about\ntoxicity in video games\nwhen you tell someone to 1v1 me mid what\nyou're looking for is triumph you're\nlooking to win\nthe problem is that oftentimes in\nseeking triumph is when we actually\ncause ourselves the biggest problems\nright when you attack someone else\nbecause you want to put them in their\nplace is when you end up\ngetting\nthey activate their trap card and you're\nthe one who actually ends up looking\nlike the [ __ ] sometimes you'll tell\npeople to 1v1 mid you and they will\nabsolutely destroy you\nright because they are better and you're\nfrustrated you're toxic you're\nfrustrated by losing the game and then\nlike you want to put them in their place\nbut maybe the reason you're losing the\ngame is because they're better than you\nare\nand so often times i think we we talk a\nlot about letting go of negative\nemotions but in my experience the desire\nfor triumph gets us into a lot of\ntrouble right i want to be number one\nit's all ego\nso what we're going to do in this\nmeditation it's going to have basically\ntwo parts the first part is going to be\na visualization of sorts\nso i'll walk you all through evoking\nsomething that makes you feel triumphant\nand then we're gonna let go of that\ntriumph we're gonna sort of almost\ngrieve it\nex like let it go let detach from it and\njust\nlet it go so that we're not controlled\nby that desire anymore\nnow in the letting go part\nthis is where things get a little bit\npersonalized\nso for a lot of these meditations\nthere's an evoking of something and then\nthere's a transcendence of that thing\nand in that transcendence phase this is\nwhere your particular\ntemperament\nor cognitive style\ncomes in\nso when i teach meditation oftentimes\nwhat i'll do is i'll work with an\nindividual and so i'll figure out okay\nthis person likes sight oriented\nmeditations\nthis person likes visualizations this\nperson likes breath this person likes\nsound or there'll be some kind of anchor\nthis person likes mantra they like\nchanting\num\nyou know so we're not going to know\nexactly what that is so we're going to\nuse\nbreath and then we're also going to do a\nmantra\nor\nyeah so uh but this is where for that\nsecond phase you can kind of adapt\nthe meditation to whichever\ntechnique you like so if you like\nbreathing you can do that if you like\nchanting a mantra you can chant your\nmantra in that kind of moment but in\nthat transcendent technique as we let go\nwe're going to use whatever practice\ncenters us very easily\nokay so i'll give you all just like\nthree examples so one will be a\nbreathing practice that will be focused\non the navel so we're kind of going to\nkind of breathe in feel that triumph\nthat feeling of triumph down there and\nlet go of the triumph through our\nexhalation the next thing that we're\ngoing to do is focus on the third eyes\nso for those of you all that like third\neye practices and instead what we're\ngoing to do when we do this third eye\npractice is that we're going to see the\nnature of triumph we're going to see our\nego involved in this and we're going to\njust like mentally let it go it's not\nbreathing it out it's not emotional it's\ngoing to be insight oriented we're going\nto understand the origin of triumph\nand then the third thing that we're\ngoing to do is chant a mantra so i'll\nshare om with you\nbut if y'all\nany of the mahavakyas or other general\nmantras will will work for this kind of\nthing so you can use my but we're just\ngoing to do ohm right so in your your\nmind you're going to\nchant om or you can chant it aloud and\nyou'll kind of let that triumph go okay\nso\nlet's begin\nso sit up straight\nclose your eyes\nokay\ni'm kind of confused why everyone is\ncommenting on my appearance today but i\nappreciate the confidence damn it\nokay\nso sit up straight close your eyes\ni'm going to start by taking a moment to\ncenter ourselves\nso when we center ourselves we can focus\non our breath\ni like to lean into my proprioception\nwhich is our sense\nof our position in space\nso if i raise my arm i can tell my arm\nis up here\nif i lower my arm i can tell my arm is\ndown here\nso even with your eyes closed you can\nfeel your body\nyou can feel where you are in space\nso i'm going to tune into that\nyou can feel your weight\nkind of going into the ground\nlet your shoulders relax\nlet your breathing slow\ntake a moment to work out any kinks that\nyour body may have because we'll be\nstill for the next part\nand now what i want you to do\nis think about someone that pisses you\noff\nthink about a person\na situation\nor a resentment\nsomewhere that you've been wronged\nwhere there was injustice in the world\nsomething that makes you want to\nmake a fist and shake it\nand pick one thing\nsomething that really frustrates you\nand notice the patterns\nof the memory or the situation\nappreciate\nthe aspects of it\nyou may even notice that it's kind of\nhard to evoke\nthe toxicity that you used to feel\nwhich is noteworthy\nbut do your best\nand now what i want you to do is imagine\na scenario\nin which you will feel triumph in that\nsituation\nso you'll give them a piece of your mind\nor you will 1v1 them in mid you dumpster\nthem you put them in their place\nmaybe they're getting into shape to make\nyou look bad\nand you'll show them you're going to get\ninto more shape\nyou're going to get into the best shape\nand then then they'll see then they'll\nlearn\nso let those feelings come forth as well\nthe sensation of triumph of justice\nvisualize what it would look like your\nmoment of victory\nif it was memorialized in a painting\nand now what we're going to do\nis take those feelings the feelings of\nresentment the feelings of anger\nas well as the feelings of triumph\nand righteousness\nand we're gonna imagine that they're in\nour belly\nlike a knot of different feelings all\ntied together\nkind of red and black in color\nalmost like a tangled ball of yarn that\nis red and black\nbecause there is something ugly about\nthat victory\nwe're going to start by breathing into\nit\nand then breathe out\nand as you experience those emotions as\nyou continue breathing let each one of\nthem go\nso in the first scenario\ngo through it again\nbut pause this time when you feel an\nemotion and breathe into it\nand let that emotion go\nand then the next thing happened\nin your story\nin that traumatic event\nand breathe into it\nand let that resentment go\nin that way as you breathe\ngo through your resentful scenario\nletting each negative emotion go one at\na time\nwe'll continue for about 30 seconds or\nso\nand now what we're going to do is think\nabout the triumphant\nscenario so imagine that you've let all\nof those red feelings out\nso all that remains now is a tangled\nball of black\nand go through this fantasy of your\ntriumph\nand as you imagine\nyour victory\nover the undeserving\nnotice that tarry blackness inside you\nand with each of those emotions as well\nas you go through your orchestrate your\nvictory\npause\nand breathe out that triumph let it go\ngo through each emotion breathing into\nyour stomach\nand letting it go\nlet go of your victory\nand now what we'll do\nis if you've\nhad experience with any kind of agna\nchakra or third eye practices\nlike charging the laser beam or other\nkinds of things through dr k's guide\nwe're going to focus on the point of our\nthird eye\nand we're going to drive our attention\nto it it's the space between our\neyebrows right about right here\nand now we're going to just notice\nwhile concentrating on that point\nwhat the nature of these feelings are\nso you don't have to actively go through\nthe mental scenarios\nwe want to focus on that third eye\ncenter\nand just let your mind digest\nactually don't need to be thinking much\nat all\nnotice the nature of these things\nsee your attachment\nsee the anger and resentment that you\nfeel\nwhich is born of entitlement of what you\ndeserve\nand that the concept of deserving comes\nfrom the ego\nand look for ego in the triumph as well\nsee how triumph is nothing but ego\nand now notice how\nin this space\nof calm observation\nthese feelings mean almost nothing to\nyou\nbut as you center yourself\nin who you truly are\nin this vastness of experience\nin this observing self\nhow the ego matters less\nand let yourself\nlet it go\nlet yourself\nlet go of the anger the resentment\nof the triumph of the need for justice\nrealize that this whole process has\nalready deprived you\nof peace\nthen engaging in it further will only\ndeprive you of more peace\nso let it go\nand now you can either out loud or\nsilently in your head\nrepeat the mantra om\nor a mantra of your choice\ni'm sort of feeling om namaha shivai\nis the appropriate thing in this moment\nand use the mantra to seal this\nmeditation experience\nall of the peace that you've felt\nall of the learning that you have all of\nthe grounding that you've attained\nuse the mantra to seal it\nand plant it within you\nand you've let go of it now\nyou need no justice your ego\nhas been let go\nand sit with the peace within you\nand now with a deep breath in\nand out\nstart to return to the world\nonce again tap into the proprioceptive\nsense\nthe space\nthe the feeling of your body in space\nand as you return to your body notice\nall the\nwiggling that you need to do\nmaybe your\nlegs have fallen asleep\nmaybe you're feeling thirsty\nnotice all the sensations which are\nreturning to you now\nas you breathe in and exhale\nprepare yourself to fully come back\nput your palms together in front of you\nin namaste position\ngive gratitude\nto yourself\ninto the universe for allowing you to\nlet go of this problem\nto let go of your triumph and your anger\nand to see that there are two sides of\nthe same coin\nand by chasing one\nwe give power to the other\nthat resentment fuels the triumph\nand chasing the triumph fuels the\nresentment\nand with one final inhalation as you\nexhale\nbow your head and slowly open your eyes\nso a\ncouple of things\nthe first is\nsometimes this happens\nso i tend to steer clear of\nthe mantras and the spiritual practices\nthat have more of a religious background\nbut even then i kind of dispute that\ncharacterization because i think a lot\nof what we\nunderstand is religion\neven the term religion is actually like\na western and almost judeo-christian\nconcept\nso\ni sort of reject to the premise that\nsome of what i teach is religious in\nnature although from an academic sense\nyou can absolutely make that argument i\njust think that that's a mistake on the\npart of historical academia\nso today i offered um\nwhich is absolutely on the religious end\nof what we teach so i don't think it\ninvolves believing anything in anything\nso let me explain a little bit so\nshiva is viewed as the god of\ndestruction but that's not really what\nshiva is like if you actually ask\nscholars of this tradition of the yogic\ntradition shiva is simply the word for\nconsciousness\nand\nsometimes what happens is these concepts\nget\nembodied within a god\nbut that's not really what shiva means\nlike the actual sanskrit term of shiva\nmeans consciousness\nand so what you're sort of tapping into\nis like that sense of consciousness\nwhich is free of form and\nsubstance and desire and all that kind\nof stuff so if it bothers you that\nthat's religious in background by all\nmeans discard it\nand at the same time that's just what\nfelt authentic in the moment so i went\nwith it wasn't where i was planning on\ngoing\nbut\nthat's what happens\num\nand so as chinese cabbage farmers saying\nshiva represents a certain level of\nconsciousness well said\nand so what we're\nshooting for is that\nas we transcend the ego we move one step\ncloser to consciousness and by invoking\nshiva what we aim to do is like move one\nstep closer to transcendent\nconsciousness\nand uh\ntop key\n007 was saying very new experience thank\nyou so much you're very welcome welcome\nto the stream\num and someone else was saying\nuh i don't wanna so pepe gus was saying\ni don't want to let it go i captured the\npart of me that wants to hold me back\ni locked it and now i have control over\nit i can't let it go if i do all i've\nbeen working now for for till now will\nbe for nothing\nso this is where i'd say\nif you're if you don't want to let it go\nand you're not ready to let it go then\ndon't let it go\nso\nholding on to our resentment and our\ntriumph\nis sometimes what we need\nso there's like you know\nif i have a five-year-old kid who loves\ntheir blankie\ndo they need the blankie no\ndoes the blankie do a whole lot for them\nnot really\nit's purely emotional it's purely an\nattachment\nright they don't need the blankie if\nthey lost the blanky they'd be fine\n20 years later they're going to be okay\nso oftentimes and at the same time if we\nyank the blanket away from them\nwe tell them you don't need this this is\nfor kids\nthat in and of itself is going to be\ntraumatic\nand yet how many of you presumably\nadults have blankies\nright we let things go when we're ready\nto so if you're not ready then hang on\nto it\nif you're not ready to let it go don't\nlet it go then lean into the agna chakra\npart and try to understand it\nright what is this why am i not ready to\nlet it go\ncan you at least see that the resentment\nand the triumph go hand in hand you\ncan't have one without the other\nif you're afraid\nbecause you've built up an adaptation\nthat involves control instead of\nsurrender\nthat's fine run with it\nand just be aware\nthat at one point\nthe strategy that you've developed\nmay not work so great anymore and if you\never discover that that's the case\nthen come back to this practice\nand it'll be here waiting for you\nand you may discover that you never get\nthere you may discover that there is\nnever is not\nright that you should never get there\nthat's terrible\nthat the presumptions that i'm making\nare a hundred percent wrong\nand even if you get there that's a\nwonderful place to be as long as you're\nsure in it that's fine\nwho said i was the arbiter of truth\nso if you're not ready to let it go\nhang on to it\njust accept and notice that you're not\nready to let it go\nright that's enough for today\nso\nalpha inhibitor 98 is is doing different\ntypes of meditation okay or should you\nstick to one type both\nso i think you should try lots of\ndifferent kinds of meditation until you\nfind one that resonates with you feels\neasy\nand or lets you like enter a meditative\nstate\npretty easily\nthen you should practice that one\nright so once you find something it's\nlike\nyou know\nshould i eat the same food\nevery day or should i\neat different foods every day and it's\nlike well it's a combination of both\nright you try a lot of things until you\nfigure out what you like and then you\ncan start like you know you get\ngroceries to make your weekly or monthly\nregimen you make chili once a month\nyou know you do salad once a week like\nyou figure out what your rotation is and\nthen you craft your meditation practice\nthat way\nright and the whole point the challenge\nis that what a lot of people\nthis is the reason we teach meditation\nthe way that we do\nis a lot of people are taught\nso a lot of teachers of meditation\nare experts in one tradition\nso if you think about like who teaches\nmeditation\nlike usually like monks and stuff right\nor you'll have some trained teacher like\na meditation center\nand usually what happens is you have to\nget like certified nowadays to teach\nmeditation i'm a level three meditation\ninstructor and so what they've done is\nthey've like advanced to very high in\nthis one tradition\nbut if we look at it historically there\nare like thousands of traditions of\nmeditation if not more\nand so why like\nwhy are there so many different\ntraditions of meditation because there\nare lots of different kinds of minds and\nthe reason that so many different kinds\nof meditation have flourished\nis because different minds require\ndifferent techniques just like there's\nlots of different foods\nthe challenge is that as a society\nwe've started to believe in experts\noh this person is an expert and even the\nperson teaching you is like i am the\nexpert i know because i've done level\nthree i've done level three training\nyou do not realize how knowledgeable i\nam\ni'm level 3 meditation instructor\nbut they've only been taught usually one\ntradition\nso what they teach you is their\ntradition\nand then what happens is people say\nmeditation isn't for me\nor they think they're bad at it and then\nthe meditation teacher tells them\nconsistency is important practice is\nimportant you'll get it eventually\neveryone struggles with this it's a\nnormal part of the meditative process\nyou'll hear about persistence and\ndedication\nwhich is like sort of true\nbut maybe the reason that people\nstruggle with it and maybe the reason\nthat it happens to everyone is because\nyou're a bad teacher\nor your technique is bad did you ever\nconsider that\ndid you ever consider that if your\nstudent is having a problem if the\nstudent is struggling that's a fault of\nthe teacher not a fault of the student\nbut this has been completely lost\nin meditation instruction\nthis is the way to meditate you can go\nto wherever you want to they'll teach\nyou their technique they'll charge you\nzero dollars a hundred dollars a\nthousand dollars ten thousand dollars\nto meditate the best way\nand if it's not working for you try\nharder\nright\nso it's been my experience so part of\nthe reason that i didn't become a monk\nwas because i couldn't find i mean i\nfound one place where i tried and they\nsaid no\nbut or they said later\nbut as part of as a consequence of that\ni went and i explored lots of different\nkinds of meditation techniques i went to\ndifferent ashrams in india south korea\njapan\nand studied a lot of different\nmeditation what i sort of came to the\nconclusion was oh like there's like\ndifferent kinds of temperaments\ndifferent kinds of cognitive\nfingerprints\nno two minds are exactly the light alike\ntherefore the technique of meditation\nfor no two minds will be exactly the\nsame\nand so experiment until you find what\nworks for you\nright just like you find what food you\nlike that happens through\nexperimentation and meditation should be\nthe same way\nmeditation tearless so we already have\nsomething like a tier list i don't know\nabout tears because\nthat implies that one is better than the\nother\nbut we do have if you all are interested\nif you check out dr k's guide to\nmeditation there's a segment on like\nhistory of meditation and different\nkinds of meditation so we break apart\nlike how\nwhen i'm working with someone there's a\nset of different things like rules that\ni'll use in terms of recommending a\nmeditation\nso for example is this someone who likes\nto focus their mind or is this some is\nthis someone who needs curiosity in\norder to get their mind to focus\nso this is where you know there are two\ndifferent techniques and one technique i\nwill give someone a particular mantra to\nchant and that works really well for\nthem\nin another technique i'll ask someone\ndecipher the sound of the ocean\nor decipher the sound of your breath\nspell it out for me what is the sound\nthat your breath makes\nand what gets them to sit every day and\nfocus on it for 20 minutes is if they're\ntrying to figure something out that's\nwhat they need to get their mind to sit\nstill\nso that's where really if you want to\nlike learn meditation like have a\ncustomized technique\nyeah so plat\nplat candidate is saying the kaish\ntheorem meditation was absolutely\namazing amazing even just to experience\nonce and not practice regularly\nbut i found it works great for me\npersonally yeah that's because and so\nthat's where like\ni love that technique and it's one of\nthe techniques that has\nhas truly taught me and i i think for\nthose of you people that it worked for\nyou\nyou understand now what meditation truly\nis\nbecause if you think about that\ntechnique what you're doing is sit still\nand be aware\nthat's what the technique is\nbut it's so much more than that\nright that technique teaches you\nthe nature of life and joy\nand\nrelief\nand suffering\nand for people who aren't there like\nyou're not gonna like sorry\nright but hopefully all we'll we'll\nteach it somehow more consistently but\nit's not for everyone not everyone has\nthat experience but for some people it\nawakens them holy crap this is what it\nmeans to be alive and that's the goal of\nmeditation but it's not going to work\nfor everyone right different things\nwork for different people\nand that's okay\nbut i'm glad it worked for you\nis that the sit still one absolutely\nand some people may be like\nwhat\nthat didn't happen for me\nyou"
