    "transcript": "and i want you to join me in this bliss\nget in my van and i'll drive you to a\nplace that has endless happiness\nget in my van and we'll go to a place i\ncan't do it straight face but you guys\nsee how how terrifying that is\nit's like i don't even need to mention\nthe van you know the van is coming it's\ncoming\nright you know something like something\nis weird here\nintroverted and being seen as creepy\nso i went on this date with this girl\na couple months ago and we went out to\neat and being introverted i'm not a real\nbig talker after the date she texted me\nand said she thought i was creepy\nbecause i didn't talk much\nyes that is literally what she said and\ndidn't want to go\non any more dates\nwhy do introverts get mislabeled as\ncreepy just for not talking a lot\nin honesty it kind of bothered me any\nthoughts\nso\none of the most challenging pieces of\nfeedback to get\nand we don't even think about it as\nfeedback is being called creepy\nright because here's the thing like if\nsomeone say if let's say you like this\nperson you go on a date and then they\ntell you like oh like you're creepy i\ndon't think i want to go out anymore\nlike what do you do about that right how\nis that actionable in any way shape or\nform\nand not only is it like how is it how do\nyou just like be less street uh creepy\nyou can't really do that\nand so not only is it like not\nactionable it's it's really confusing as\nto why some people get labeled as creepy\nis it because we're introverted like\nwhat does it mean to be creepy like how\ndo you even get labeled creepy like what\nare the features of creepiness\nand this is why it's so challenging is\nbecause like people will use this word a\nlot right often times in dating in\nrelationships but it's the kind of thing\nthat is devastating it's like a\ndevastating label to receive and\nabsolutely nothing you can do about it\nbecause even if you were to go and ask\nthis person i'm not sure that this\nperson would want to have a you know\nlong conversation with you about it\nafter one date but even if you did have\nsomeone who who let's say would sit down\nand talk with you about\nyou know what creepy is like what would\nthey even say if you ask someone if you\nfeel like someone else is creepy\nlike\nwhat would they say like how if you ask\nthem okay what is it that makes me\ncreepy it's going to be very hard for\npeople to even tell you what it is\nand so i thought in honor of friday the\n13th what we would do today is actually\ntalk a little bit about what it means to\nbe creepy\nand the interesting thing is that\nthankfully we have a very sophisticated\nlanguage in in psyche in psychiatry\num\nabout different kinds of\nnon-verbal sort of cues and other things\nthat i think we can actually\nunpack what creepiness is and the cool\nthing is as we unpack what creepiness\nactually is\nthen what we can do is also figure out\nsome way to actually address each of\nthose components\nokay so the first thing to understand\nabout being creepy\nis that it's kind of like a it's kind of\nlike just a feeling that you get right\nso like someone if you think about the\ntimes when you've been creeped out\neven if we were to ask you okay what is\nit that makes this creepy you may not\nreally be able to say so maybe there are\nsome things that you you may be able to\nsay because your mind is going to come\nup with answers but we don't really know\nthat those are the features of\ncreepiness so what we're going to first\ndo is understand okay like what are the\nfeatures of creepiness\nand if we can kind of break down what\nare the features of creepiness then\nwe'll get an avenue if you've been told\nthat you're creepy before or you have a\nfriend who's creepy and like doesn't\nreally\nis it is having trouble socializing\nthen you know like maybe you can give\nthem some feedback that's a little bit\nmore constructive like we can help\nourselves and potentially help other\npeople the other cool thing about it is\neven if there are people that we feel\nare creepy maybe we can give them some\nmore formative feedback to try to make\nthe world a better place\nand so the first thing that we're going\nto do is dive into like okay what does\nit mean to be creepy okay\nso what i want to point out to begin\nwith is just that creepiness is kind of\na\ncreepiness is kind of uh it's a gut\ncheck right so we have in our\nminds or brains\nokay i guess this is clipped off in the\ntop so maybe my face involves creepiness\nwhich we'll get to for a second\nwe have in our minds or our brains\nall this kind of like signal processing\nstuff that is going on and we're not\nreally aware of what the signal\nprocessing is\nbut there are certainly things that we\nknow like people who make movies for\nexample we know that there are certain\nthings that we can do\nto give the audience a sense that this\nperson is creepy and so i think the\njoker is a really good example of this\nbecause if you watch this movie like\nit's kind of creepy right the dude is\ncreepy but what aspects of it are creepy\nbecause some people like as we saw in\nour subreddit post they sort of say like\ni'm an introvert therefore i'm creepy no\nit's not like that\nintroversion if you really look at the\nthe original definition that carl jung i\nbelieve came up with\nit's not about being quiet or shy that's\nnot what introversion necessarily is\nit's about whether you get drained or\nenergized by interacting with other\npeople so after a long day of work this\nis the way that i kind of think about\nintroverts like if if you're exhausted\nat 6 00 p.m on a friday and it's been a\nrough week how do you\nspend the next four or five hours like\nrelaxing unwinding or having a good time\ndo you go out and socialize or do you\nsit at home and kind of like spend time\nwith yourself so when you're like\nregenerating your mana bar do you spend\nit with people or without people and\nthat's a good example i think that's the\nbest kind of\nuh description of introversion versus\nextroversion and a lot of this other\nstuff like shyness or like you know not\nbeing able to relate to people so that's\nall completely different\nokay so now if we look at the joker\nthe question sort of becomes okay what\nare the features that are involved that\nmake this creepy\nand so the cool thing is that we've done\nresearch on this kind of thing and what\npeople have discovered is this thing\ncalled the uncanny valley so if\nsomething like looks\nhuman-esque but doesn't look human\nenough\nwe kind of consider it creepy right so\nthis is where the brain sort of decides\nthat okay like this is not a human\ntherefore i have i'm not going to judge\nit in kind of uh\ni don't need to judge it at all like\nit's not human there's nothing i need to\nbe afraid of oh okay let me move my\ncamera actually\nmove it over here\nokay so i will just be part of\ni'll be part of part of the slides\nso dr k can be part of the uncanny\nvalley\nall right\nso if we kind of look at this um\nactually you know what would be better\nit's probably if we just did this how\nabout we do this\nokay\neasier\nso if we look at this concept of the\nuncanny valley what we see is that\nthere's this sort of like there's this\nratio between familiarity and similarity\nand\nthere's kind of this interesting place\nwhere we're like not too worried about\nthings\nif they don't look human\nand then if they look superhuman we're\nnot really worried about them either or\nlike just a regular human but then\nthere's this there's this sort of like\nlack of humanness that our brain assigns\na creepiness value to\nand the interesting thing is if you\ntunnel down into what are the features\nof the uncanny valley what do we see in\nthese things that like make us feel kind\nof disturbed there are actually discrete\nfeatures that will move us from here to\nhere and trigger this sort of idea that\nthings are creepy so if you look at this\nlike what about this picture makes it\ncreepy what about this makes it creepy\nall right what do y'all think\nright it's disturbing\nand so then there's also other things\nthat as we kind of look into creepiness\nand stuff like that what we'll kind of\nsee is like\nthis is just kind of frightening but\nthere are certain features that get kind\nof changed a little bit and like\nthat's what makes it creepy but the key\nthing here is that there are certain\nfeatures here\nwhich\nactually like make it creepy so let's\nkind of tunnel down into what is it that\nmakes all of these things creepy okay\nso the first aspect of creepiness is\nokay so we're going to talk about a\ncouple of different\nbefore we dive in\nso let's just kind of recap what we've\ndone so far so sometimes you'll see\nsomething right i'll be walking down the\nstreet and i'll i'll see something and\nthen i'll think that is creepy so what\nwhat that let's say i'm walking down the\nstreet and you see like someone who's\nhomeless\nand and this is where like homeless\npeople oftentimes evoke a creepiness or\nfear response from people walking down\nthe street and the question is like why\nis that right so even when i was in\ntraining\none of the the key things that one of my\nuh\nmentors or teachers once taught me is\nthat they were trying to tell me like\nokay if you're trying to figure out if\nsomeone is depressed or someone is\npsychotic there's a very simple what\nthey called a limbic test so it's kind\nof like trusting your brain instincts\nabout whether this person is depressed\nor whether they say they're psychotic\nand the test is\nif this person were sitting\non the subway and there was one seat\nopen on the subway and the seat was\nright next to this person would you sit\ndown next to them or not\nand if you would sit down next to them\nthey're depressed if you wouldn't sit\ndown next to them they're psychotic and\nit's kind of like it's not precisely\ntrue it's not you know a true\nscientifically validated test but it's a\nreally interesting perspective because\nthere are some things that our brain is\ninterpreting about other people there's\ncertain features which our brain is\nkeeping track of which make us like\nhesitate with some people and make us\nnot hesitate with other people\nso the other interesting thing is that\nwe we can lean on a couple of different\nareas of research so one is attachment\ntheory and some of those things in terms\nof child development\nand then we can also look at uh research\nand schizophrenia because oftentimes you\nknow we're talking about psychotic\ndisorders and and oftentimes what makes\npeople who are homeless like difficult\nlike frightens people kind of\ninstinctually there may be all kinds of\ndifferent\nbiases and things like that which i'm\nnot saying that those don't exist and\nthis is entirely explanatory for it but\nthere's like something about some kinds\nof people that set us off and the\ninteresting thing is that we know\nthrough neuroscience\nanalysis of people with schizophrenia\nwhat some of that stuff is because often\ntimes when people are actively psychotic\nthey creep other people out right and\nlike you look at someone you'll be like\nthat person is on something that person\nis high and you kind of like steer clear\nyou walk across the street so these are\nexperiences that we all have and the\ncool thing is we can do research to sort\nof understand what's going on\nokay so the first thing to understand\nabout creepiness\nis what we call fixed affect\nso fixed affect is so affect is the\ndisplay of emotion on your face\nso when we think about it like\nfluctuating affect in a normal kind of\nway like a certain amount of fluctuation\nin your facial expressions calms other\npeople down okay so like i'll give you\nguys a simple example we're gonna do it\nreal quick right so if i go like this\nright this is great now like think about\nhow do you feel if i'm doing something\nlike that right if i just start smiling\nlike hey how's everybody doing today\nthere's something about that that could\nbe\ncomforting or maybe you're smiling too\nyou're like what is this guy doing right\nand then\nif i stop\nfluctuating it\ni'm still smiling right and the second\nthat my affect changes now my affect has\nchanged\nlike and so all it takes is fluctuation\nof affect so as long as my facial\nexpression is changing and this is where\neven if you look at like if you if i\ndon't know if you all have had\nexperience with kids but the most\nterrifying thing for a child\nis\nwhen you have a neutral facial\nexpression that they can't get you to\nreact so if you like go to a child don't\ndo this to children but just as it to\nillustrate it\nlike go to a child and you have a\ncompletely neutral affect like it's not\neven about smiling it's about the fact\nthat the affect doesn't fluctuate right\nso i can just do this\nand that's creepy it's freaking creepy\nright you'll see that so there's not a\nfluctuation of affect and then if you do\nthat with a kid what the kid will do is\nthey'll like try to get you to respond\nso first they'll make a noise they'll\nlike start laughing they may like touch\nyour face they'll do something cute\nthey'll like show you something they're\nlike gonna try to get some kind of\nreaction\nand then like if that doesn't work\nthey're gonna start crying like anything\nto get you to react and so sometimes\npart of what we'll get to like why this\nis a problem for people but the first\nthing to understand about creepiness and\nwe can even look at things like we can\ngo back to our our you know\nuh\nkind of joker\ntaking a quick look at the joker\nokay\nand what we what we find is that like\nthis has\na certain amount of like if y'all have\nseen the joker you know that he kind of\nlike laughs inappropriately right so\nlike he he just smiles for way too long\nand that's partially potentially why\nclowns are creepy but what we see is a\nnon-fluctuating affect leads to people\nfeeling creepy\nokay\nnext thing to talk about\nnope oh noes\nmy notes went away\num\nokay\nso\nwe talked about kind of fixed affect the\nother thing that we can sort of touch on\nfor a second is flattened affect so we\nknow that this happens in people with\nschizophrenia where\ntheir affect gets blunted so the the\nrange of affect so if i go from this to\nthis\nto to this\nright there's a wide range whereas you\ncan have kind of flattened or\nconstricted affect you'll see this\nsometimes in late stage parkinson's as\nwell whereas like they just don't smile\nmuch\nthey don't get very sad so there's like\na like there's like a\nflattening of the affect so instead of\ngoing like this\nwhat i can do is i'll just do this\nright and one one has a wider range and\nis like more comfortable like it makes\npeople like if you laugh kind of fully\nright like a a full like a hearty laugh\nis something that makes people feel\ncomfortable whereas like if you just\nkind of like slyly smile all the time\nthat constriction of affect where you\ndon't display a whole lot of positive\nemotion and you don't display a whole\nlot of negative emotion it's not just\nthe fixedness of it it's the fact that\nthere isn't the range so both of those\nthings will lead to a sense of\ncreepiness\nokay\nso the next thing that's really really\nimportant is the lack of mirroring and\nthis is what especially causes kids to\nfreak out\nis that generally speaking when we like\ninteract with another human being we\nwant to like mirror the affect and you\ncan sort of feel this yourself right so\nyou're ready like i'm gonna go like this\nand as long as i have enough fluctuation\nand changes and like you know do like as\nlong as there's movement and\nfluctuatingness\nit's gonna cause you to respond but like\nthink about what you do\nwhen i go like this right what are you\ndoing you're smiling and you can't even\nhelp it like you're just you're at home\nyou're like watching like what is this\nguy doing i don't even know it's not\neven funny but what the hell is\nhappening i don't know it doesn't matter\nbut the point is your brain is\nresponding you can feel yourself respond\nand so that emotional mirroring is what\ncomforts people because if we were\nsitting across from each other and i\nwent like this and you started laughing\ntoo\nthen like we know we're kind of on the\nsame page right and this is where like\nemotional mirroring is very very\nimportant for helping people feel\ncomfortable it's very important for\npeople feeling understood\nso emotional mirroring is a huge\ncomponent of it and what i oftentimes\nfind in people who are get labeled as\ncreepy\nis that they're not very good at\nemotional mirroring and we'll get to why\nthat is in a second\nso like this is where where like you\nknow if someone else is feeling sad and\nand you're not like able to display\nsadness\nthen like that's gonna cause some\nproblems and they're like okay this\nperson just isn't on the same wavelength\nwith me\nand so if we think about these vague\nterms like okay this person is just not\non the same wavelength like what exactly\ndoes that mean it has to do with things\nlike emotional mirroring and if you're\nreally on the the not the same\nwavelength at all if that gets really\nreally bad then you end up being\nperceived as creepy because here i am\ncrying about something\nand this person is like\nyou know like that's kind of weird it's\nkind of creepy it like doesn't make me\nfeel comfortable\nso the next component that we're going\nto talk about is which is kind of\nrelated to that is discongruent affect\nso this is another thing that makes\npeople feel creepy which is that\nthere's a certain display of emotion\nwhich is appropriate\nand there are other displays of emotion\nthat are\nnot appropriate so if for example you'll\nsee this in the joker as well where like\nhe has this tick where he starts\nlaughing right so and it like creeps\npeople out because you shouldn't be\nlaughing in a situation like this and so\nwhen you display discongruent affect to\nwhat you're talking about we'll also see\nthis as a defense mechanism where\nsometimes you know we'll be talking\nabout really really sad and terrible\nthings and we'll like start laughing\nor people will crack a joke or like\nsomething will happen and there's like a\ndiscongruent affect\nthe other thing sometimes that we'll see\nis that if you know if i'm talking about\nyeah i just won the lottery and i'm the\nhappiest person alive\ni love life so much i love people\ni'm so happy i have everything in the\nworld to be thankful for\nand i want you to join me in this bliss\nget in my van and i'll drive you to a\nplace that has endless happiness\nget in my van and we'll go to a place\ni can't do it straight face but you guys\nsee how how terrifying that is\nit's like i don't even need to mention\nthe van you know the van is coming it's\ncoming\nright you know something like something\nis weird here like alarm bells so this\nis what i want y'all to tune into if you\nwant to understand creepiness why the\nhell is that so damn creepy if you're\nwatching that you're like oh\nright and even now if i do this\nthat's going to make you feel more\ncomfortable because that's emotionally\nmirroring\nwhat you were feeling which is like\nget get away from me i don't want to get\nin your van i don't want to go to your\nworld of bliss or whatever is like\nyou know\nso that's where like emotional\nthis discongruent affect is very\nimportant so if you're talking about\nthings that are a lot of fun and you\ndon't display a lot of emotion\nor you're talking about things that are\nterrible and you're laughing\nright like\nlike that's i'm not gonna do that\nbecause that will even bother me i mean\ni'm sure theoretically i could but like\nyou know you could talk about something\nreally really terrible happening and you\ncould be like smiling while you're\ntalking about it and then when you\ncombine it all that's how you get your\ntraditional crazy villain from a movie\nso if you go back and you watch movies\nwhere there are villains that are very\nvery creepy i'm thinking about like\nmovies like you know no country for old\nmen and like some of these other who's\nthat uh there are a couple actors that\nare really good at this and if you like\nreally look at what they do why they're\nso damn creepy is because they'll have\ndisc and grew in affect they'll do\nbrutal things to other people without\nyou know like displaying any kind of\nemotion and that sets us it like comes\nacross as creepy\nand so then like like this is where if\nwe think about creepiness it's all about\nthe display of the the emotion and if we\nthink about what's going on\non neurological level\nsomeone else's brain is factoring in all\nthese things and it's so fast right i\ncan just like go neutral\nand like it happens instantly it's like\nwhat the hell is\nwhat the hell is that and so when you're\nthinking about you know if someone calls\nyou creepy it's like the reason they\ncan't tell you what's wrong\nis because it's that circuit of the\nbrain that's active now i'm not saying\nthat you're behaving the way that i am i\ndon't think people are hopefully it's\nnot that bad because i'm really doing\ngigantic caricatures but there are\nfeatures of that that are going to\nbecome really important which we'll kind\nof get into soon\nokay\nso there's one more thing that makes\npeople hella creepy which is responding\nto internal stimuli\nso generally speaking once again are the\nempathic circuits of our brain are kind\nof like attuned\nto what's going on and generally\nspeaking\npeople respond to like certain signals\nin the environment right so if you're\nlike eating dinner\nand someone gets up\nand like gets down on one knee and pulls\nout a ring and is proposing to someone\neveryone in the environment is going to\nbe tuned to that person right and then\nlike everyone's kind of like tuning in\nto this external stimulus and we're all\nsort of responding together\nso when we sort of all respond like when\nwe have this kind of like crowd\nmentality of responding together we're\nlike that's very like emotionally\ncomforting even if you think about\nthings like peer pressure right let's\nall get out our pitchforks we all rile\neach other up and then like we're all on\nthe same like we're you know\nstamping our pitchforks and and we're\nlike ah\nyou know down with whatever\nlike so whatever is happening we're all\nkind of doing it together and we have\nthis kind of mob mentality\nso if you think about it the mob\nmentality whether it's good or bad or\nwhatever it's just how human beings work\nso when you are not in the same\nwavelength of as other people when\nyou're not responding to external\nstimuli and you're instead responding to\ninternal stimuli that's very creepy so\nin the case of something like a\npsychotic disorder or you know\nsubstances of abuse where people are\nlike hallucinating and stuff that creeps\npeople out why does it creep people out\nbecause this person is like responding\nto stimuli that you can't see\nso self-dialoguing is a really good\nexample of something that creeps people\nout so if someone is has auditory\nhallucinations and i'm talking to my\nhallucinations it creeps people out we\ncall that self-dialogue where it's like\ni'm not even talking like i'm talking to\ny'all there's no one in the room with me\nbut this is not creepy right because i'm\ntalking to you like there's this it's\nweird there's like no other human here\nbut this somehow is not creepy even\nthough i'm talking like i'm literally\ntalking in an empty room and i keep\ntalking in an empty room but i'm talking\nto you and you know that i'm talking to\nyou so it kind of feels normal whereas\nif i was you know if i was like at a\nfood court\nand y'all were sitting at a table nearby\nand i was just doing this with no camera\nor anything like that if i was just\ntalking sitting at a picnic table then\npeople would be like what the hell is\nwrong with this guy y'all get that\nso\nescamog is like there's no camera we\naren't real oh my god\nyou guys are real copium plunies oh my\ngod\ni'm wrecking myself\nbut y'all get what i'm saying like\nseriously like i know the memes and\nstuff aside okay hilarious\nno one's real this is all in doctor\nkay's head\nbut you get it like so there's this\nthing of responding to internal stimuli\nwhere like when you're talking in the\nworst scenarios this is auditory\nhallucinations and self-dialoguing which\nis when you're talking to yourself and\nit creeps people out\nso now the question is like\nokay so these are the features of\ncreepiness right there's a certain\namount and basically what it comes down\nto is this weird kind of empathic stuff\nabout facial expressions the the\nfluctuating ability of facial\nexpressions the\num you know the congruence of facial\nexpressions with what's going on around\nyou\nlike kind of like being on the same\nwavelength of someone else emotionally\nmirroring other people which when\nparents uh don't do that with their kids\ntheir kids get messed up in all kinds of\ndifferent ways\num you know that's all fixable don't\nworry about it if you wound up in that\nsituation so don't give up hope but we\nsort of know that like the lack of\nmirroring like you know fixed affects\num\nyou know like the the lack of\nfluctuation all this stuff comes across\nas creepy\nlast thing is responding to internal\nstimuli\nthere's one other thing that we will\ntalk about towards the end but um\noh should we talk about it now okay you\nknow we'll talk about the end remind me\nokay\nso\nthis is why it's so hard to deal with\nbecause first of all we don't really\nknow what we're doing right you're not\nreally paying attention to like okay how\nmuch am i fluctuating my face in a in a\n30 second period is my face fluctuating\na lot or is it fluctuating a little and\neven then like you guys may have noticed\nlike this\nis a little bit creepy it's not as fun\nas when i was doing it earlier and why\nis that it's because there's a certain\nrange of affect and since i'm\nexaggerating a bit too much it like\nfeels a little bit creepy right and even\nwhen i do this maybe you feel a little\nbit more comfortable because like now\ni'm mirroring what you're feeling\nokay so this is this is what's going on\nit's all the subconscious stuff and this\nis what's so frustrating about is you\ndon't know what you're doing like am i\nsmiling too much am i smiling for too\nlong am i smiling when i shouldn't be\nsmiling these are all the different\nfeatures of affect which make other\npeople feel creeped out if we don't do\nit kind of properly okay\nand so then the question is okay what do\nwe do about it so the first thing to\nunderstand is that if you try too hard\nall of this stuff is going to happen so\nthat's where people will say if you're\ngoing on a date just relax right like\ndon't worry about it get out of your\nhead and why is that really important\nlike sure that's good to do\nbut let's understand what does that have\nto do with creepiness if i'm in my own\nhead and i'm over analyzing okay like\nshould i have how often should i change\nthe fluctuation of my smile should i go\n20 smile should i go 30 percent smile\nshare i go 40 smile i've been at 40\nsmiley for way too long let me go back\ndown to 20\nif that's literally what's going on in\nyour head how empathically connected do\nyou think you are to the other person\nlike not at all right and so this is\nwhat we tend to find in people who get\ncalled creepy is a lot of them will have\nproblems like social anxiety and what\ndoes that literally mean how does that\nwork what that means is that when you\nsit with someone you're not actually\nattending to them you're in your own\nhead and you're thinking through a bunch\nof things they're telling a funny story\nand then you're like you're like busy\nlike thinking about what you just said\nand like how you don't want to stumble\nover your words and so you're not paying\nattention to the story and then they\nkind of like look at you because they're\nlike they just\nyou know got to the punch line of the\nstory and you're supposed to laugh and\nthen you didn't realize it and then like\nsome part of your brain is like oh\nthere's the punch line laugh and then\nyou're like\n[Laughter]\nthat's so funny and then the other\nperson is like\nthe [Â __Â ] was that right\nand so then you become like if you try\nif you're socially anxious instead of\ninteracting with someone you you become\nlike an alien or a reptile in a human's\nbody trying to interact with them the\nright way and you get so caught up in\nyour head that you start forcing okay\nthis is what i'm supposed to smile like\ni'm supposed to smile when i first meet\nsomeone so you meet someone at the very\nbeginning you're like smile\nexecute smile.exe\nhello\ni'm so happy to be here right now it's\nnice to meet you and then the other\nperson's like what the\nright and they think you're a little bit\ncreepy\nso in terms of responding to internal\nstimuli i don't think most of us are\npsychotic but even if we come across as\ncreepy the reason for that is because\nwe're literally stuck in our own head\nand so the facial expressions that we're\ndisplaying are going to be based on this\nright so even if like\nyou're on a date\nand the other person is having a good\ntime if you think you screwed up and you\nshould have ordered something else or\nyou should have let them order first or\nyou interrupted them and then you're in\nyour own head suddenly you're responding\nto internal stimuli and they're like\nenjoying the atmosphere and some live\nmusic just came on something like that\nand they're like so they turn to it but\nyou're thinking about what you just said\nand you're like and then you're not\nattending to the external world you're\nresponding to internal stimuli it comes\nacross as creepy\nright so the second thing about affect\nso this is where oftentimes people who\nare creepy will get stuck in some kind\nof negative affect\nor they'll get they'll try too hard and\nget stuck in like some kind of positive\naffect\nwhere you're trying too hard to have a\ngood time and even when i say the phrase\ntrying too hard it's like what is that\nhow do you define that\nbut you all kind of know right like you\nknow when someone is trying too hard and\nwhat does that mean trying too hard how\ndo you know when someone's trying too\nhard it's because they tend to\nexaggerate affect\nthat becomes kind of non-genuine and\nthey'll like amplify it artificially so\nyou're not feeling it internally so what\nyou do is like you ramp everything up\nbut then it it's not congruent it\ndoesn't mirror what the other person is\nfeeling oh my god that's so hilarious oh\nmy god that's the funniest thing i've\never heard in my entire life and you're\nthe funniest person ever and i'm having\nsuch a good time at this date and i\nwould love to do it again\nright so there's like that's a little\nbit creepy like not quite as bad maybe\nbut you'll see that it's sort of like\nthis amplified affect and why do you\namplify affect because you yourself\ndon't feel comfortable so then we have\nthis kind of phrase of like fake it till\nyou make it which i think is a terrible\nidea\nokay\nso\nif you\nare struggling with being creepy\nrecognize that a lot of this stuff is\nactually changeable like you can act on\nit okay you could there are things that\nyou can do so here are a couple of tips\nso remember the goal here is to be\nrelaxed\nthe goal here is to have a fluid\nand mirroring affect that is generally\nspeaking full range right so we want it\nto be fluid fluctuating right so we're\ngonna sometimes we're gonna have fun and\nsometimes we're gonna be like oh my god\nso serious oh\nso serious and then it's like oh wow\nthat's crazy right so we want a range of\naffect\nwe want to be able to pace the other\nperson\nand uh range pace\nfluctuating\nfull range and mirroring right so we\nwant to pace the other person we want to\ngo high when they go high we want to go\nlow when they go low\nand we want you know to be able to move\nso we don't want to just stay in one\nplace for a long period of time okay\nso then the question is okay like how do\ni do that because if i'm trying too hard\nif if in my mind it's like the other\nperson is smiling i should smile\nthe other person is stop smiling stop\nsmiling\nterminate smile.exe execute smile.exe\nexecute smile.exe at 50\nif you go down that route you're going\nto be responding to internal stimuli and\nyou're not going to actually be\nattending to them you're going to feel\nlike some kind of reptile in a human's\nbody and they're going to creep them out\nso what do you do\na couple of things\none is\nthink of a positive memory so if you\nwant to force yourself to smile and you\nwant it to be an authentic smile so\nthere are two kinds of smiles there's\nthis kind of smile\nwhich is creepy right because you the\nsmile doesn't reach my eyes is what\npeople say and then there's like this\nkind of smile which is like a little bit\nbetter right yeah it's a little bit\nbetter so there's kind of a full face\nsmile and the way that you do those two\nthings if i tell myself to smile\nwhat you're actually gonna do is you're\ngonna just\ndo this which is kind of creepy right\ndoesn't touch your eyes whereas if i\nthink about like you know\nhow much my kids love pokemon it's gonna\nmake me feel like more emotionally\nconnected and i'm going to smile more\nnaturally\nso one thing you can do is just think of\na positive memory like i know it sounds\nkind of weird you don't want to do it\ntoo long otherwise you're going to slip\ninto the responding internal stimuli\nthing but as you're let's say you're\nabout to meet the person\nand you kind of like walk up to the\nrestaurant you see someone waiting\noutside and as you're walking up like\njust think about like\nman that you know it's\noverwatch two's player base has dropped\nby 99 god that's gotta suck for the\noverwatch devs\nright and you're just thinking about\nthat and as you walk up you're going to\nhave some kind of active fluctuation\nof of and generally speaking lulls\nright right\nright so it's got to be hard for them\nbut you're like wow that's a mess like\nnfts lol\nright so whatever it is just think about\nsomething it can be nice and short and\nit's going to like create sort of a\nnatural smile on your face because\nyou're thinking about it and then what's\ngoing to happen is you're going to be\nthinking right as you walk up and you\nsee them you're like hey\nhow are you and then you're that's going\nto change the affect is going to change\nyou're going to introduce yourself smile\nright and that's where hey my name is\nolive nice to meet you and they're going\nto see all of that and even in the five\nseconds of you thinking about something\nand attending to them introducing\nyourself and smiling there's going to be\nsome leftover like sort of fluidness\nfrom your memory which is going to like\nand\nyou've won at that point in the first\nfive seconds\nif you've like made a decent\nintroduction like you've won on the flip\nside for those of you that are paranoid\nif i screw up the first five seconds\ndoes it mean that i'm screwed for the\nrest of the date no not at all\nright but that's kind of a key tip to\nevoke some kind of internal emotion\ndon't dwell on the memory don't get lost\nin the memory but just kind of evoke\nthat emotion let it sort of relax you a\nlittle bit think a little bit positively\nand then go into the interaction\nthe next thing that you really need to\ndo is try to be with them okay and this\nmay sound i mean it's simpler\nto say than it is to do\nbut recognize that you're not there so\nthe people who get caught up in their\nown head right what they're trying to do\nis they're trying to do well on a date\nso there's like a certain outcome like i\nwant to be liked\nand if you're chasing that outcome\nyou're not going to be enjoying the date\ni want to be liked i want to be liked i\nwant to be liked i want to be liked\nthen you're not actually like enjoying\nthe other person's company you're just\ntrying to get them to like you which by\nthe way is creepy\nwe'll get to that in a second so this is\nwhere what i'd really encourage you all\nto do is just recognize that this is an\nopportunity\nfor you to get to know someone and see\nif this person is worth liking\nright so like this is an another human\nbeing that has a whole set of\nexperiences that could be good bad\ninteresting they could recommend books\nto you that you'll really enjoy they may\nplay games that you really enjoy they\nmay recommend movies they may recommend\nmusic you can learn about the world\nthrough this person's experience\nand if you go on a date i try to attend\nto them right it's not just necessarily\nin being polite and trying to be like\nthe nicest guy on the planet like i'm\ngoing to be such a nice guy like i'm\ngoing to make sure that they're they're\nthe best and happiest time ever that's\nbad too because then you're sort of\nforcing a particular kind of interaction\nwhere someone is like oh yeah you know\nthe food isn't\nmy my\nchicken could use some salt\nand then it's like okay like do you want\nme to get a waiter for you like\nno no no no no let me get something then\nyou're like i want you have the best\nexperience possible because you're\namazing and you deserve the best\nlike how do you know that you just met\nthe person you don't know what they\ndeserve they may not disturb the best\nthey may be awful people\nand so instead of trying to you know\nshoot for a particular thing or display\nyourself in a particular way just\ngenuinely attend to the person\nright this is an opportunity you have an\nhour you have two hours to get to know\nsomeone and you get to learn about the\nworld\nand it the\nmore you have that attitude instead of\nchasing a particular outcome\neither\nhonoring them with your presence\nor\ntrying to get them to like you like all\nof those things are outcome oriented and\nyou're not going to kind of enjoy\nyourself and you're kind of trying too\nhard as you try too hard all that stuff\nwe talked about about affect is gonna\nstart to come into play and then you\nwon't be able to like attend to what\nthey're saying you're not gonna be\nemotionally mirroring because they're\nactually okay with the chicken\nit's a little bit could use a little bit\nof salt but then when you call the\nwaiter over you're like we need a new\nchicken this is terrible i don't know\nhow you could serve this stuff\ndiscongruent affect\nbecause the person's fine with it\nthey're like whatever\ni can survive without you know without\nperfectly salted chicken\nand so this is a lot of stuff that\npeople do that they don't realize that\nthey're doing but it essentially boils\ndown to\nthese things okay\nso\nthe last thing that we're going to talk\nabout and this is very important for\ncreepiness so this is one thing that you\nreally have to be careful about so the\nother thing that makes people creepy is\nnot respecting boundaries okay so you\ncan do all the affect stuff but then the\nother thing you need to be really\ncareful about is if you are not\nrespecting people's boundaries they will\nthink you are creepy and you should not\ndo that\nso good examples of not respecting\nboundaries are\nyou know like repeated hammering text\nmessages\nexpecting responses in a brief period of\ntime like if you feel like how can i say\nthis this is\ndifficult but sometimes people who don't\nrespect boundaries have\nemotional needs that can only be met by\nthe other person\nso that you have to be very very careful\nabout if you are in a situation\nwhere your emotional needs and comfort\ndepend upon this person you can come\nacross as creepy\nso i'll give you all a couple of\nexamples so if i felt like\ni did poorly on the first date and i\nmessage you and i'm like hey sorry for\nscrewing up on the first date and they\nhad kind of a good time they're like oh\nno it was totally fine\nbut their response doesn't soothe me\nbecause i don't i think they're just\nbeing nice right so i feel like i\nscrewed up they're just being nice and\nthen i hammer at them again because what\ni really need from them is for them to\ntell me yeah you did screw up but it's\nokay like let's go out again i'll give\nyou another chance i'm looking for some\nkind of emotional like resolution from\nthem\nwhereas\nthey're not kind of on the same page but\ni'm kind of relying on them for\nemotional needs other examples so this\ncan also be sort of like what crosses\ninto the clingy territory right we go on\ntwo dates why aren't you messaging me\nback\nlike what's going on there like because\nyou feel lonely you feel like so like\nlook into yourself why do you need this\nperson to message you back after two\ndates\nright and then you get angry and then\nyou start you know calling them [Â __Â ]\nor [Â __Â ] or whatever\nbut like think about your own emotional\nneeds and how much you were relying on\nthis other person\nto soothe your emotional needs\nand oftentimes people who are creepy\ndon't really think about it that way\nthey don't think about what they're not\neven aware of like what kind of needs\nthey're\npursuing does that make sense\num yeah so loneliness is absolutely as\nis rubric group says loneliness is sad\nand can turn us ugly absolutely and the\nproblem is when you when it turns you\nsad\nand then you depend upon that other\nperson to resolve your sadness and by\nresolve i don't necessarily mean make\nyou feel happy sometimes what people are\nlooking for is like essentially abuse\nright they're like you you why aren't\nyou texting me back after two two dates\neither call me an [Â __Â ] and just be\nplaying with it or\nyou know give me another chance like\ndon't stop leading me on so we're\nlooking for some kind of resolution so\nbe very careful about your own emotional\nneeds and how much responsibility for\nsoothing those things or addressing\nthose things you put on the other person\nthat's going to lead to boundary\nproblems\nand the last thing is explicit\nboundaries so like there's a certain you\nknow standard of like what you're\nallowed to do in terms of physical\ncontact\nright so if you're on a first date with\nsomeone like don't\nyou know put your arm around them like\nin the first five seconds like right\ndon't put your arm around their waist\nyou know don't try to hold their hand\nlike right away right there's a certain\nkind of like\nboundary which is kind of like evolves\nover time and you have to kind of give\nit that time\nso there's also boundaries which i don't\nreally understand too well about you\nknow what's the frequency of text\nmessages and things like that\nyou know\ncalling people drunk is another example\nlike you know you got to be careful\nabout that sort of thing\num you know\nthere are all kinds of emotional\nboundaries physical boundaries\nyou know like\ni don't even know like interaction\nboundaries for lack of a better term and\nif you violate those kinds of boundaries\nand don't really respect them from\nanother person like that's going to make\nyou come across as creepy so those are\nexplicit behaviors that have nothing to\ndo with what's going on over here it's\nall about how you treat and behave with\nanother person\nso just to kind of summarize\nthe challenge with being called creepy\nor telling someone that they're creepy\nis that that's not we don't really know\nwhat that means right so people will\nlabel you with it\nand\nthat's really challenging because like\nyou don't know what you're doing wrong\nif someone calls you creepy like what do\nyou do about that how do you get\nuncreepy well the truth of the matter is\nthat you you can't actually do something\nabout it and that's in order to\nunderstand what to do about it we have\nto understand what creepiness actually\nis and it turns out there's very very\nsophisticated and nuanced circuitry\nwithin our brains\nthat tells us when something is\ncomfortable and safe and when something\nis creepy and dangerous and a lot of\nthat circuitry has to do with things\nlike affect affect is the display of\nemotion and what we tend to find is that\nsafe affect is affect that is fluctuant\nfull range\nand appropriate and mirroring so it's\nlike you know there's there's a full\nrange of affect it changes a lot\nit is tuned into what's going on\nand it matches what the other person is\ndoing so as long as you kind of like\nwork on your affect in that way like\nyou'll come across as less creepy\noftentimes you'll find things like\nmovies and video games and stuff like\nthat will tap into these features when\nthey try to create someone who's creepy\nor scary or a villain and people will\nsay oh my god this person is such a good\nactor and sure they're good actors but\nwhat are they actually doing if you\nanalyze what is it that they're doing\nthat makes them creepy it's what they do\nwith their affect\nright so this is why you'll sometimes\neven have like breaking bad i think is a\ngood example of this where you'll have\nlike protagonists who are villains\nbut they're likable\nand what makes them likeable like you\ncan have like people who do bad things\nthat are likable what makes them likable\nit's that affective\nuh you know fluctuation that makes them\nnot creepy like you like them\nright and it's kind of interesting if\nyou look kind of like watch movies and\nstuff look for these features then\nyou'll begin to see okay who's creepy\nand who is that creepy\ncouple of other things to remember about\nbeing creepy first is that responding to\ninternal stimuli tends to freak people\nout\nso this in the worst case scenarios we\nsee this with things like psychotic\ndisorders with auditory hallucinations\nand self-dialoguing which means talking\nto yourself which is really really\ncreepy\nbut unfortunately if we have anxiety if\nwe're overthinking things in our head\nwe're going to get some of that same\neffect right because i'm all up here and\ni'm not attending to what's going on\naround me i'm not paying attention to\nthe conversation i'm not emotionally\nmirroring\nthe last thing is boundaries so you got\nto respect people's boundaries so\nwhether those are emotional boundaries\nphysical boundaries you know interaction\nboundaries frequency of communication\nwhen you expect people to get back to\nyou\nyou know we're not saying that\nthat\npeople\nthe other party isn't at fault in some\nway here which we'll talk about is one\nfinal point but generally speaking you\nknow there's like don't text someone 15\ntimes after a first date within like 15\nminutes right give him a chance to\nrespond\nthe last thing to remember\nand this is unfortunate but sometimes\npeople will call you creepy just because\nthey feel uncomfortable and it may not\nbe that you're doing anything wrong\nso some people who have a low\ndiscomfort tolerance\nright so people who get triggered easily\nfor example or people who don't know how\nto\nyou know communicate effectively\nsometimes people get called creepy and\nthey actually aren't doing anything\nwrong and that's just coming from\nsort of the insecurity or discomfort of\nthe person that you're with and that has\nreally nothing to do with you and that's\nwhat makes it so difficult to sort of\ndeal with is because like sometimes\npeople are you know you're not really\ndoing anything wrong it's just people\nwill call you creepy because i think the\nother thing that people have learned\nover time\nis that creepiness is sort of like an\nimpervious\nattack\nlike if you call someone creepy like\nthey don't get a discourse about that\nright and if they push you about it what\nmakes me creepy what makes me creepy\nthen that just reinforces the fact that\nthey're creepy so in a sense it's almost\nlike a a trump card in some\nrelationships or especially in\nterminating relationships or setting\nboundaries where if you call someone\ncreepy like they don't have any kind of\nrecourse against that and it's a very\nvery\nsafe way where you can tell people oh\nyeah why didn't i why don't\ni block that person why he's a creep or\nshe's a creep she creeps me out and as a\nsociety what we've sort of done is we've\nsaid like if something creeps you out\nyou're allowed to just say that and then\nthere nothing else needs to be done so\nyou have to be a little bit careful\ncareful about being you know if you\nreceive the feedback that you're creepy\ni would be very very critical of\nyourself and really do like a process of\nunderstanding am i in my own head am i\nreally attending to the other person am\ni sitting with them am i like really\ntrying to learn about them and their\nlives and things like that am i sharing\na piece of who i am because sometimes\nwhat will happen is people will just\nfeel creeped out but that really has\nnothing to do with you that has to do\nwith their own some scars their own you\nknow cognitive schemas their own\ntriggers and things like that which is\nlike you can't really do anything about\nthat right so be a little bit careful\nabout that\nso that's what creepiness is turns out\nthat i think there's a lot of good\nneuroscientific basis for these kinds of\nthings this is really like wired into\nour core neuros like neurocircuitry the\nchallenge is that we don't really\nunderstand that so when we get\nthis kind of feedback we don't really\nknow what to do with it because no one\nexplains okay what is creepiness how can\nwe understand this the good news is that\nthrough things like film and television\nand other kinds of research on concepts\nlike the uncanny valley we can actually\nbreak apart what creepiness is and if\nyou get that kind of feedback what you\ncan do about it\nmake sense\ngood\nquestions\nyeah so your turn my turn is saying if\nit's many people who are always telling\nyou you're creepy rather than just one\nperson then that can help very good\npoint right so how do you know if the\ncreepiness is on your end or if it's the\nother person's like discomfort that\ndepends on the the consistency of the\nfeedback\nwhat if a narcissist doesn't give a f\nabout the fact that they're creepy\nso if people don't care that they're\ncreepy or they don't care about your\nopinion like that's fine so the\ninteresting thing is that narcissism and\ncreepy i think are not\nnecessarily correlated at all so we tend\nto toss around the term narcissism a lot\nbut generally speaking if you look at\npeople who are narcissistic they're very\nemotionally attuned which is how they\nget away with what they get away with\nright they're so good at mirroring\nemotion they're so good at provoking\nemotion and manipulating emotion they're\nactually very very adept i almost think\ni mean it's not really true but you have\nnarcissists who are absolutely creepy\nbut sometimes people with narcissism or\nespecially like cluster b personality\ndisorders their emotional empathy is\nlike through the roof like they're very\nvery like their emotional circuitry in\nsome ways is very very\ncompetent i don't know if that makes\nsense\num\nso asset army gaming is how can you tell\nwhat other person considers too much\ntexting there should be like a safe\nnumber in a certain amount of time right\nyeah i don't really know\nwhat do y'all think like what's what's\nthe acceptable because i i don't you\nknow i don't like meet\npeople on dating apps and stuff so i\ndon't know what the acceptable number is\ni don't know what the frequency of day\nof texting\nyou know\nyeah so jo so jk ray is saying ask them\nabout that i think that that's\na excellent point the one thing that\nyou've got to be kind of careful about\nis that asking too many things about\nboundaries and stuff early on can\nbe creepy right so if we go on one date\nand i'm like okay tell me what makes you\ncomfortable in terms of frequency of\ntexting and stuff like that tell me what\nmakes you comfortable with this with\nthat generally speaking i'm a big fan of\nasking just asking people\num\nyeah so mcthug fresh is saying just\ngotta match their behavior realize when\nyou're striking out i think some of it's\nlike kind of organic asking him about it\ni think is a very good idea\njust to give um\nyou all a sense of how to do that right\nso in kind of a safe way\nyou know if it's been\na day or like it let's say you send a\ntext\nand they don't respond i would say kind\nof like think about it like tennis where\nyou send something and then they send\nsomething back although i wouldn't\nadhere to that rule too carefully\nthis is where you know the second day or\nthird day if you text him again\num\nit's really tricky because you don't\nwant to say\nam i bothering you by texting you too\nmuch because that comes across as kind\nof like insecure and stuff like that\num\nyou know you just you also want to kind\nof acknowledge okay acceptable number of\ntexts per day after the first date so\npeople are saying like one to five\ni would have put a lot of difference\nbetween one and five even there but you\nknow you can text him like i'd say like\nonce or twice and then if a couple days\ngo by\ni'd say you can text them again\nand then like maybe with that second\ntext or\nwith the third time you text them maybe\nnot the third actual text\nbut you know the third time you text\nthem i would sort of\ncheck about their frequency of texting\nyo so texted you a couple times i don't\nknow if you're busy or whatever like\nthat's cool just curious i mean do you\nwant me to can like should i try again\nor are you just busy or like what's\ngoing on\ncool either way\ni know people get busy\ni'm i'm like you know i'm happy to hit\nyou up next week if things are\nbusy for you right now\nand then if you don't get an answer to\nthat then i would let it go\nright so you can sort of let people know\nso this is where um\njust to give you all an example so\nsometimes i'll have patients who are\nlate to appointments\nand generally speaking when i have\nappointments it's like you know i have a\n10 am appointment i have 11a appointment\n10 am shows up at 10 15 i'm not gonna go\nlate into my 11 am appointment news on\ntime so if they show up late you know we\nget less time\nso that happens a couple times i'll talk\nto them about it i'll just be like so\nhelp me understand so i've noticed\nyou've been late two or three times\nlike\nwhat like what should we do about that\nbecause\nyou know i think we're doing a lot of\ngood work\num i'd love to be able to work with you\nfor the full hour\nso is this the kind of thing like should\ni just mentally schedule like you know\n15 should i assume that you're going to\nbe 15 minutes late to every appointment\nbecause i can schedule that accordingly\nor you know are you going to show up on\ntime or like you know so sometimes what\ni would do is have\npatients who were sort of like late off\nand on i'd schedule them at 11 o'clock\nand then i'd have lunch from 12 to 1 and\ni'd sort of mentally account for okay\nchances are they're gonna be 15 minutes\nlate and then i can run into my lunch\ntime a little bit and get a little bit\nof work done at 11. so i can sort of\nmentally prepare for it but you just\nhave a conversation about it right what\nshould i expect from you\nand that's where that's a really good\nnon-judgmental way to do it right so\nyou're not saying i want you to do this\nyou need to text me back because if you\ndo that that's going to be creepy\nbut asking people like what are the\nexpectations here\nlike just tell me what the rules of the\ngame are i'm not saying that they need\nto be a particular way i'm not asking\nyou to change them i'm just trying to\nfigure out what are the rules of the\ngame\nwriggle chi is saying also try to let\nthem initiate text conversation once in\na while that that way you know if they\nare interested\nyeah\nhow could someone work on incongruent\naffect that's a really good question\nuh refund123\nso the first thing to understand about\nincongruent affect is that some of it is\nlike a healthy normal adaptation so even\nif you want you'll watch the\nyou know the interview with iron mouse i\nthink that's a good example of of sort\nof like incongruent affect which we see\na lot\nit's very normal for people to laugh\nwhen they're talking about\nlike terrible things happening to them\nright because that's it's a defense\nmechanism it's humor so sometimes\nincongruent affect is just a consequence\nof a defense mechanism\num and so if that's the case then like\nyou just need to be aware of that right\nand then like sort of ask yourself why\ncan't i sit with this emotion the way\nthat it is like what makes it really\nuncomfortable for me to\nyou know sit with this so also joking uh\nsometimes with my\nmale patients\nwe would sometimes talk about you know\nwhen we when we have some heavy\nemotional experience one of us would\ncrack a joke\nand sometimes they would be dick jokes\nand so instead of actually making the\ndick joke what we learned to do is is\nsay like okay now feels like one of\nthose moments where you know a dick\nchoke would really\ncut the tension and then we'd kind of\nlaugh about that and then we wouldn't\nneed to make the joke anymore because\nwe're acknowledging a little bit and\nthen we're going to stay in that kind of\nnegative space does that make sense\nokay\num\num\nokay\nyeah i guess\nas to be expected\nand people\ndid not ever did not really\nokay let's move on\ndr casey\nuh aria maki dr k speechless good job\ny'all yeah absolutely\ni was trying to decide so this is one of\nthose things where like\nso you know sometimes\ni'll like look at chat and it's like\nokay\nshould i address this or should i not\naddress this and this is one of those\nthings where it's like sometimes you\nknow like if you're playing a game of\nchess and you lose a piece\nyou just gotta understand that if you\ntry to keep fighting that battle you're\njust gonna lose more and more pieces\nright it's like sometimes you just gotta\ntake the l and move on\nbecause that's not a battle i'm gonna\nwin and then i was debating okay like\nwhat are the odds of like actually you\nknow but i think the truth of the matter\nis i think you all know you know i think\nthe community is actually\nhow can i say this you all pretend to be\nfar bigger degenerates than you actually\nare\nit's almost like\ninstinct to reflex at this point it's\nnot instinct it's reflex right it's\nconditioning it's like oh dr k said dick\njoke\nmust\nrespond with emote\nand\nyou all know what i mean i think you\nunderstood what i was trying to say\nand then if y'all wanna you know that's\nokay like that's just how it works okay\nso it's fine\nright that's our dick joke you all get\nthat\nit's like when i say something it's like\nthat's the way that you manage the\ntension if someone makes some great\ncomment cut cut the tension like a\ncircumcision like that's hilarious\nright\nbut that's that's just our dynamic so\nthis is where when we're talking about\nmirroring affect and stuff like that\nright\nso if doc regardless of the the context\nif dr k uses the word dick like we have\nto respond in a particular way and\nthat's that's our social contract\nwhich is fine so i was just like working\nthrough that in my head a little bit\nbut do we wanna do we wanna\nyou know\n[Music]\nright you guys saying i'll say can't\nargue with the contract you're right you\ncan't\nand even then i tried to go meadow with\nthe contract and you all handled it for\na little bit and then now it's like\nnope\nback to it\nyou"
