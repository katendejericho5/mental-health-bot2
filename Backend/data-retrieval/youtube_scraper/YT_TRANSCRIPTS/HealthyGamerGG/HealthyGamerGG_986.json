    "transcript": "is this an issue of this person being\nlike not trusting or is it an issue of\nthis the person that they're dating like\nnot being entirely honest or or whatever\nthere's this idea of or like it's not or\nit's a combination like if conflict\navoidance on on her part plus a lack of\ntrust on your part results in like a\nlack of communication which is like\nquite bad do you all get that in the\npast if your partner has tried to\ncommunicate with you\nand the part of you that feels difficult\nto trust comes out right and you start\ngetting paranoid you may not like lash\nout at them in sort of an aggressive way\nbut you may like start to be like super\npassive where were you what were you\ndoing\ni'm starting to think i don't respect\nmyself i have a fiance who recently went\non a vacation i found out later she was\ntalking to a co-worker the entire time\nshe was gone\nonce she got back she started hanging\nout with him for five to eight hours at\na time while lying to me about where she\nwas even one time overnight\ni have my own issues with trust and feel\nlike i spend too much time living in my\npartner's life so i found out about this\nthrough checking her location\ni confronted her with this and she said\nshe felt like she needed some space and\nalways felt watched around me i don't\ncompletely deny this because i feel like\ni have a really hard\ntime trusting and she is a compulsive\nliar due to her own childhood traumas\nshe said that she is not cheating but\ntalking to this person helps her have\nconversations to work out her past\ntraumas\nhe has had similar traumas he has\novercome and i and that i am emotionally\nuh\nclosed off not completely true\nwhere i'm starting to have issues is\nthat i do somewhat believe her that she\nis not cheating but let her know that i\nneed openness and honesty if this is\ngoing to work she quickly disrespected\nthis by lying about where she was two\ndays later to again talked with this guy\nfor five or so hours\ni don't know if i am the abuser or the\none getting abused is me checking in on\nwhere she's at and glancing over her\nshoulder when she's on the phone causing\nher to feel a lack of privacy the real\nissue or am i just getting my boundaries\nstream rolled by le and letting her lie\nto me by blaming myself for this\ni'm starting to get creeping doubts that\ni don't respect myself enough to enforce\nmy boundaries and enact consequences for\nwhen she crosses them like leaving the\nrelationship\nshe doesn't want to lie but has extreme\nconflict avoidance that makes telling\nthe truth extremely hard one of these\nthings she is trying to fix\na recurring thought that i have is that\nbecause i have these unhealthy trust\nissues that i deserve this or that even\nif i break this off it will just happen\nin to the next relationship\nreflecting these two past these past two\nweeks i believe my invasiveness\nuntrusting nature is what caused my\nrelationship previously to deteriorate\nand end\ndo i try to work this out with her how\ndo i enforce or communicate my needs of\nbeing open and honest to work on my own\nissues when being open and honest is one\nof her core issues\ni want to make it clear that i do not\ncon\nthat i do not condone my behavior even\nif she does lie i need to work on myself\nand to not immediately jump to\ninfidelity just because she is talking\nto someone of the opposite sex\nthis situation has just been a wake-up\ncall that these deep-rooted issues need\nto be addressed and worked on i think\nthis answered the question\nright this is fantastic so this is\ni mean the situation is unfortunate\nbut\nthe first thing that i want to point out\nis that relationship problems\nare not\nusually a me thing or a them thing\nso we have this kind of idea our mind\ntells us is me checking on her where sh\nwhere she's at and glancing over her\nshoulder when she's on the phone causing\nher to feel a lack of privacy or\nam i getting my bounty stream rolled and\nletting her lie by blaming blah blah\nblah right there's this idea of or\nthat is this an issue of\nthis person being like not trusting\nor is it an issue of this the person\nthat they're dating like not being\nentirely honest or or whatever\nlike that it's not or it's a combination\nso this is what i want y'all to\nunderstand so like a relationship\nis not something on you and something on\nher that's not that's not how it is it's\na combination of what each of you bring\nto the table\nso i bring a certain set of like\nthinking and conditions and reasoning\nand stuff like that\nand then my partner said brings a\nanother set of stuff up right\nso and then like these two things blend\ntogether and you create something new\nthat is like half from you and half from\nher\nnow this relationship to me the one\nthing that i can say is that i don't\nthink that this sounds\nlike a healthy\nrelationship moving in the right\ndirection\nnow some people may say oh just just\nbreak up with them\nother people may say\noh no like it's on you no i don't think\nit's either or\nso if you're in a relationship\nwhere\nyou know you don't trust your partner\nthat can create sort of a situation\nwhere if you don't trust them\nthey may paradoxically feel like they\nhave to keep things from you so if she\ntells you yeah i'm gonna go meet a\nco-worker of mine\nand then like\nthat sort of sets you off in some way\nyour partner may decide that the\nsimplest thing to do is just not tell\nyou because then she doesn't have to\ndeal with like\nyour reaction\nnow if you have conflict avoidance there\nlike if conflict avoidance on on her\npart plus a lack of trust on your part\nresults in like a lack of communication\nwhich is like quite bad do you all get\nthat so if i don't trust\nany lack of communication is gonna like\nany question mark in the relationship\ni'm gonna see the worst options\nso any uncertainty becomes a doomsday\nscenario for someone who has difficulty\ntrusting\non the flip side if someone's conflict\navoidant\nanything negative\nor positive there's all kinds of stuff\nthat's going to be more question marks\nbecause the conflict avoidant person\ndoes not want to have a conversation is\ntroubled by the conversation doesn't\nwant to get things out in the open it\ndoesn't even mean that there's anything\nto hide\nright it's not necessarily that they're\ndoing something wrong but conflict\navoidance leads to a lack of\ncommunication a lack of communication\nleads to question marks and if you have\ntrust issues question marks are going to\nget translated in your brain as\ninfidelity\nso this is like absolutely a scenario\nwhere these two things are like\ncombining in a terrible way\ndoes that make sense\nso what do you do about the situation\nthe first is that\ni commend this person for this level of\ninsight where they're like i think the\nlast reason my relationship deteriorated\nwas like a lack of trust\nand so in the past if your partner has\ntried to communicate with you\nand the part of you that feels\ndifficult to trust\ncomes out right and you start getting\nparanoid you may not like lash out at\nthem in sort of an aggressive way but\nyou may like start to be like super\npassive where were you what were you\ndoing\nand even though they say things like you\ndon't believe it and they see that you\ndon't believe it and they see that\nyou're upset and they're conflict\navoidant and they don't want to make you\nupset so they conclude like because even\nif they weren't doing anything wrong\nthey can't keep you from getting upset\nbecause you have trust issues does that\nmake sense\nbecause how are they supposed to\nreassure you if you don't have trust\nright\ndoes that make sense\nso if they can't reassure you\nthen\nthey start they stop talking to you and\nthen that exacerbates the problem\nso this is the kind of thing where\ni would say a couple things first\nis you should work on this trust issue\nyourself\nright this is something that you need to\nwork through if it's a pattern that\nextends beyond this relationship it's\nsomething you should work on yourself\nsecond thing is y'all should probably\nwork on this together as well\nin terms of like you know help me and\nwhat you've got to do is be super\nopen-minded so when you sit down with\nyour partner don't try to judge or\nconvince or even share your perspective\nat all just try to understand your\npartner's perspective\nokay\nand what you want to do is say things\nlike\nhelp me understand\nwhat makes it difficult for you to tell\nme when you're hanging out with this\nperson\nlike what am i doing like i'm i'm\ngenuinely trying to understand like can\nyou help help me understand what goes on\nin your head\nhelp me understand how you make the\ndecisions you make i'm not saying\nthey're wrong\ni just want to try to understand them so\nthat i can like make my peace with it\nright and listen to what they have to\nsay\nthe other thing is frankly some of this\nstuff is a little bit sus\nyou know i'm just going to toss that out\nthere like\nspending the night somewhere and sort of\nbeing a little suss about it like that's\nreally kind of weird\nso you know i think your paranoia is\nmaybe a little bit justified\nbut at the same time like\nthey're just warning signs here right\nlike that's what this is\nand so just because there's a warning\nsign doesn't mean that there's a problem\nyet\nbut this is the kind of thing where i\ndon't think this relationship is heading\nin the right direction so you need to\nwork on your stuff yourself you probably\nalso need to work on this with your\npartner\nbut it's not like an either or kind of\nsituation\nand that's where if you lay a boundary\nwith someone and you don't enforce it\nall you're really reinforcing is the\nconcept that your boundaries don't need\nto be respected\nso if i like tell someone i'm like if\nyou don't call me in the next hour i'm\nnever talking to you again and they call\ntwo hours later and i answer the phone\nwhat am i reinforcing for that person\nall i'm reinforcing is that you don't\nhave to respect my boundaries\nnow this is where you got to be a little\nbit careful because what this may mean\nis like i'ma teach these people to\nrespect my boundaries if you don't call\nme the next hour i'm never\ntalking to you again\nand since they called me two hours later\nlike i ain't answering the phone i'm\ngonna text them if you you didn't call\nme in the hour blocked which\nthe other part of this\nis you can't set stupid boundaries\nlike don't sign yourself up for a stupid\nboundary that you then have to reinforce\nyou guys get that so never set a\nboundary when you are emotionally upset\nlike never do that\nvoice your frustration but don't set a\nboundary boundaries should be set with a\nclear head with also an understanding of\nwhat is actually enforceable like what\nare you actually gonna do\ni'm never gonna talk to you again\nstupid you're not gonna do that\nso don't say that\nright and then what happens is like it\njust creates lots of frustration when\nyou set an unreasonable boundary on\nsomeone they don't respect it you don't\nrespect it and then like it just gets\nfrustrating\nfor everyone involved so think carefully\nabout which boundaries you're gonna set\nand chances are you're gonna set lighter\nboundaries than you think you deserve\nwhich is totally fine boundaries should\nbe set based on enforcement not what\nshould be\nthis is something we talk about a lot in\nparent coaching we spend 12 weeks\nteaching parents how to set proper\nboundaries on their kids\nand like it works really well once you\nthink a little bit parents are like no\nplaying games after 10 pm are you up\nafter 10 pm are you going to watch the\nkid and make sure they don't play games\nafter 10 pm\nno they're just supposed to listen\nwell they're not going to and all you're\ngoing to teach them is that they don't\nhave to respect what you say so don't\nset a boundary for no games after 10 pm\nbut then they're going to play games\nafter tempe yeah so you've got two\noptions either they can play games after\n10 pm and not respect what you say or\nthey can play games after 10 pm and you\ndon't set a boundary on them and shoot\nyourself in the foot that you're not\ngonna enforce anyway\nthey're going to play games after 10 pm\neither way\nit's just do you want them to respect\nwhat you say or not\nyou guys get that\nso don't set boundaries that you're not\nwilling to enforce\nso as for what to do in this situation i\nmean i think it's like\nit's challenging\nyou know because because even what's\nhappening is i'm seeing an emotional\nwedge being driven between these two\npeople and when you have an emotional\nwedge and you have someone who gets into\nthe habit of not telling you where they\nare lying about it or things like that\nand you have someone who's like\nhabitually paranoid\nthen you're gonna i mean that's where\nthis is where\naffairs and breakups come from\nright so like\nshe's got you\nwho's paranoid and looking over her\nshoulder all the time\nwho she can't emotionally connect with\nand then she's got this other guy\nwho's available and easy and fun to hang\nout with and that she emotionally\nconnects with and like where do you\nthink that's going\nright\nnow that may terrify you but like\nacknowledge where it's going so that you\ncan alter its course\nsticking your head in the sand and like\nignoring the problem is not going to\nhelp\nit's easy\nto do that it's easy to like\nbe afraid\nof what's gonna happen and say like oh\nlike but like don't you know you should\nwhen when you create a situation with\nyour partner where\nyou cause them a lot of headache and\nsomeone else doesn't that's like a\ndangerous situation to be in now we're\nnot saying that that entitles your\npartner to cheat on you hopefully what\nthey would do is break up with you first\nbut that's just kind of how it is right\nso like the relationships are about\npeople who support each other and care\nabout each other and enjoy each other's\ncompany and if that's no longer what the\nrelationship is like you don't\nnecessarily need to hold on to the\nrelationship the other thing to say is\nthat like i was saying this is a\ncombination of two things right so you\nmay just need to be with someone\nwho is\nmore open to communicating and is more\nable to reassure you and is like more\nlike able to do that emotionally now\nthat could be this person but then she's\ngot to grow into that\nso this is where like a lot of times\nwhat people will sort of assume is that\nyou should be with someone who dot dot\ndot but like\nthat doesn't mean that you have to break\nup with your current person and your\npartner deserves to be with someone\nwho's a little bit more trusting so you\ncan grow each person in a relationship\ncan grow into what the relationship\nneeds in fact that's how it works\nbecause if you're dating if you two you\nare dating you're both 18 you're going\nto be different people and have\ndifferent needs at 24 and they're going\nto be different people have different\nneeds at 30. they're going to be\ndifferent people and have different\nneeds at 36.\nso you always have to grow and change\ninto what the relationship needs\nand when you're sort of committed to the\nrelationship that's what that commitment\nmeans it means growing and changing into\nwhat the relationship needs\nyou"
