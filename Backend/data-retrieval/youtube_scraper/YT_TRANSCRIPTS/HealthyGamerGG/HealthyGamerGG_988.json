    "transcript": "if you look at some of these old dantrik\ntraditions and things like that they'll\nsay that anything that is kept within\nyou will grow in strength\nand anything that is ventilated out\nwill diminish\nthis is why mantras in certain esoteric\nmeditation techniques are kept secret\nbecause as long as you keep it in here\nit starts populating your mind does that\nmake sense\nis this normal happens to me almost\nevery night hey congrats on making it to\n35 years old you must be really tired\nyou asleep yet\nyeah almost asleep remember back when\nyou were in the third grade and no one\ngave you valentine's card during the\nclass valentine's day celebration no one\nliked you and jessica was just\npretending to be your friend out of pity\npeople still don't like you\noh my\ngoodness\nokay\nlet's talk about sleep\nlet's understand like why the hell the\nbrain does this\nokay\nso\nthere is so much that\nwe have forgotten about how our minds\nwork and how sleep works so we're just\ngoing to explain this very simply okay\nso\nour mind has thoughts\nand\nthoughts have a certain energy to them\nand our mind tends to do a couple of\ndifferent things with thoughts okay the\nfirst thing that it does is indulge the\nthought\nso if i think to myself like oh i want\npizza\nmy mind is like oh pizza like i'll get\nit with this and i'll get it with this\nand i'll be like oh it'll be great like\ni'm gonna eat this and i'm gonna\nmaybe have this and then i'll have a\ndrink with it and so one thought\npropagates other thoughts right it's\nalmost like thoughts breed\nsecond thing is sometimes when we have\nthoughts what we tend to do\nis distract ourselves\nso if we distract ourselves the the\nenergy of the thought goes dormant so we\ndon't resolve it\nwe'll start doing something else and\nthen that thought energy is like kind of\nthere and sort of goes dormant over time\nthe next thing to understand is that a\nlot of times our thought\nsince our mind is so occupied\nthere's no\nspace for the dormant thoughts to come\nup\nokay\nso what this sort of means is like if\ni'm watching if i'm playing video games\nall day\nmy mind really likes it in a sense\nbecause the mind gets occupied with lots\nof thoughts\nand then what happens is like all the\nthoughts that i shoved away because of\nthe video games are still there in some\nway\nand then when my mind creates\na time of silence or when my mind is\nempty and does not have any sensory\nstimulation because remember think a\nlittle bit about where where thoughts\noftentimes come from is like sensory\nstimulation so when i'm lost in a video\ngame like i'm getting a bunch of sensory\ninput\nit's harder to get lost in a video game\nthat i'm playing if i it's muted\nand it's harder even if the monitor is\noff right if i have no sensory input\nfrom the video game like i can still\ntechnically be playing but i'm just not\nyou know i'm not going to be thinking\nabout it does that make sense it's like\nsuch a simple experiment that you can do\nwhere cut away your sensory input from a\nvideo game and see what happens\nto the video game and how much you think\nabout it\nif i played league of legends but the\nonly time i played it i was muted and\nthe monitor was off how long do you\nthink i would play league of legends\nright does that make sense\nit's kind of weird\nso why does this happen when we sleep\nit's because sleep is the time that we\ndon't have any sensory input\nso we've got all this crap\nthat's left there\nthat starts to like fill this vacuum\nand our mind starts thinking about like\nrandom stuff that happened a long time\nago and then it interferes with our\nsleep\nbecause we want to go to sleep but like\nbut this is the problem is this the only\ndormant time our mind has gotten\nso now what i want you all to do is\nthink a little bit about the nature in\nwhich our our mind evolved\nso for millions of years what kind of\nsensory input did we get\nand how much empty mind time did we have\nso the reason that our mind does this is\nbecause it evolved in a society or\ncircumstance\nwhere there was plenty of time to like\nprocess or think through the things that\nwe experience on a day-to-day basis\nwe weren't uh sensorily bombarded all\nthe time and you even see this with like\npeople who will develop technology right\nlike they'll make the technology as\ninfectious as possible\nnotification\noh by the way did you see this thing\nand now like if you like so netflix used\nto show you stills right but now they\nshow you video\nso\nyou know like they're more and more\nengaging ads used to be like\npictures now they're video so more and\nmore sensory engagement\nright\nand that's pretty cool like when i log\non like i watch like some like 30\nseconds of a clip i'm like oh that's\nlike that looks like a good show\nthen it engages my mind\nso if you want to stop doing this kind\nof stuff where your mind like populates\nthings before you sleep the most\nimportant thing is to give your mind\nsome space to let its like let the pent\nup stuff out\nso this is why like going for a walk\nbefore bed can be very good but if you\ngo for a walk ideally don't listen to\nmusic and don't participate in\nconversation if you want to talk you can\nbecause then even then like if you have\nlike sort of a light conversation it's\nlike stuff is going to be coming out\nthere's also why you know people have\nvery profound shower thoughts right why\nis that same principle\nit's because your mind actually has\nspace to think\nand the one thing that we've deprived\nourselves of\nwe even pay people to take away from us\nis the space to think and as long as you\ndon't give yourself space to think\nanytime your mind finds space\nit will think at you\nit'll burst out\nand so even if you like we can\nunderstand this principle even in\ntherapy where like therapy is like\nliterally the place that you go\nthat creates a space for you to bring\nout stuff and like process it and then\nas you process it in the therapy room\nyou leave\nand then\nit's like kind of gone\nit's like cool how that works\nthere's even a spiritual element to this\nwhere\nif you look at some of these old tantric\ntraditions and things like that they'll\nsay that anything that is kept within\nyou will grow in strength and anything\nthat is ventilated out\nwill diminish\nthis is why mantras in certain esoteric\nmeditation techniques are kept secret\nbecause as long as you keep it in here\nit starts populating your mind does that\nmake sense\nbecause like the whole point is that\nlike you didn't process this thing that\nhappened when\nvicki didn't give you a valentine's day\ncard so it pops up a thought in your\nmind\nand so when we do techniques like\nmantras what we're actually doing is\ntrying to engage this exactly\nwhen you do a mantra properly\nwhat you're doing is this thought is the\nmantra instead of a negative thing\nand when you have a mantra instead of a\nnegative thing it actually like works\nfor you so then anytime you have a quiet\nmoment there's something like some\npositive mantra that comes out and like\ninstead of this it creates like a\npositive emotion that's kind of how\nmantra works\nand we also kind of know this because\npeople who vent\nwhat they do\nthat diminishes in energy right so if\nyou vent a trauma\nlike that hopefully diminishes the\nenergy of the trauma if you vent your\nbrand new business idea\nit diminishes the energy of the business\nidea and the business never comes to\nfruition\nand we know this\nso if you're someone who has random\nthoughts as you fall asleep give your\nmind some space\nbefore you go to sleep\nto vent whatever random crap you want\ndo that for half an hour 45 minutes and\nthen you'll be surprised it'll be easier\nto go to sleep\nthis is a good question how to differ\ndiffer between overthinking and\nmaladaptive daydreaming and healthy\nprocessing very good question\nso the main question here is\ndoes the thought\nlead to more thoughts or does it\ndiminish more thoughts\nso when you process something healthily\nyou kind of let it go\nright you kind of like let it pass\nthrough you and it's kind of like gone\nwhereas in the cases of maladaptive\ndaydreaming and overthinking if you go\nback to like the beginning of this\nquestion one thought propagates another\nthought\nwhen you daydream\neach thought creates an additional\nthought and creates an additional\nthought that's what happens in the\ndaydream\nright it's kind of starting with like a\nsingle like lego and then you're\nbuilding stuff with it and the more that\nyou build with it the bigger it gets and\nthe more it occupies your mind i'm gonna\nbuild a house oh i have a house now i\nneed a window now a window now i need\npeople i'm going to put people in there\noh now the people need a garage so i'm\ngoing to build a garage now the garage\nneeds a car so i'm going to have a car\nnow the car needs a place to go to so\ni'm going to make an airport now i have\nan airport i need an airplane that's\nmaladaptive daydreaming\none thing propagates another you can\ncreate an entire fictional universe in\nyour mind\nwhereas when you emotionally process\nyou feel kind of tired at the end of it\nand you're done\nenough\nand your mind moves on to other things\nso very important distinction\nso someone else is saying i usually read\nbefore bed is that a distraction usually\nyes\nnow there can be other benefits to\nreading before bed\nlike\nother kinds of things because it's like\nphysiologically it's a calming activity\nyou can engage your parasympathetic\nnervous system you're not looking at a\nscreen so if you're not looking at a\nscreen you're not inhibiting melatonin\nproduction so melatonin can start\nramping up while you're reading so a lot\nof good reasons to read before bed\nbut when you're reading you're not\nreally\ngiving space to your mind if that makes\nsense right you're still occupying it\nwith something\nokay\ndoes that make sense"
