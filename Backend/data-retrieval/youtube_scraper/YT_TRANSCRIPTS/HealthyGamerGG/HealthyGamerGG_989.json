    "transcript": "somewhere along the way\nyour mind has learned right because\nthat's what our mind does\nthat silence\nor a lack of overt\nexpression of anger\nmeans that someone is angry with you and\nthey're just not saying it as you\ntolerate an emotion it naturally\nextinguishes over time\nthe problem with emotions is when we\ngive in to them they grow\nbut when we just like sort of like\nrespond neutrally to an emotion it\nactually like extinguishes over time i\ndon't like the idea of somebody going\nabout their relationship kind of\nconstantly in fear of their partner\ngetting mad at them so i feel like\nhaving conversations around like how to\nhealthily\nexpress\nthat you're not happy about something\nthe other one is doing is a good idea\nhello\nhello\nhi um\nso\ni'll keep on assuming that my partner is\nupset with me whenever he he's like\nsai or if he's silent for a long time\num\nand i seem to be afraid\nof him getting mad at me\nso my question is how can i stop fearing\nthat i didn't i didn't hear the very\nfirst part of\nwhat you were saying can you can you say\nthat one more time\ni'm a bit\nquiet but\ni'll try to okay um\ni keep on assuming my partner is upset\nwith me\nwhenever he is say be silent for a long\ntime\nthey seem to be afraid of him getting\nmad at me how can i stop fearing that\ndoes your partner get mad at you\nwell\nno\ni just always kind of assume that he's\ngoing to get mad at me whenever he shows\nlike\nit's like this like sign of being upset\nwith something i assume it's like about\nme\nokay\nthanks for clarifying\ndo other people get mad at you\num\nnot really\nso\nhow do you so this is\nthis is an interesting way you want to\ntake a stab at this or\nno i just\nlove her\nso this is it's kind of interesting\nbecause\nlet me just think about\nso a lot of times people will ask\nquestions like how do i stop\nbeing afraid that my partner is mad at\nme\nso what a lot of people are looking for\nis a solution that removes the emotion\nfrom the equation\nright like i want to stop feeling this\nway whereas i think the real answer is\nnot to stop feeling that way because\nsomething is going on in your mind\nthere's some somewhere along the way\nyour mind has learned right because\nthat's what our mind does\nthat silence\nor a lack of overt\nexpression of anger\nmeans that someone is angry with you and\nthey're just not saying it\nand the problem with that is that if you\ncontinue to kind of be in your own head\nit can become a self-fulfilling prophecy\nlike if i say to kruthi like\nwhy are you mad at me\nyeah\nby the tenth time i'm gonna be like\nright so if she's like i'm not mad at\nyou no no no no i i know you're mad at\nme like why are you mad at me like what\ndid i do why won't you tell me\nright and then she yells i'm not mad so\nit sort of becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy so your mind sort of learns\nlike oh like they really were see i knew\nit i knew it all along they were\nactually mad at me\nso you've got to be a little bit careful\nthere so what i would actually recommend\ndoing is sharing with your partner\nwhat you're feeling in that moment\nand so this isn't where and then what\nyour partner is likely to do is to try\nto reassure you i'm not mad at you and\nthen you can share with them again that\nyou know when you say that to me for\nsome reason my mind isn't able to digest\nit and then oddly enough\nfor you and your partner for your\npartner not to reassure you like we\ndon't want to have your partner try to\nfix\nyou being afraid that they're mad with\nyou but that the two of you can just\nsort of sit with your fear and like just\ntolerate it because the problem is going\nto be that as you\nas you tolerate an emotion it naturally\nextinguishes over time\nthe problem with emotions is when we\ngive in to them they grow\nbut when we just like sort of like\nrespond neutrally to an emotion it\nactually like extinguishes over time\nso one way to kind of think about like\nthat's the principle behind exposure\ntherapy which is that we we literally\nexpose patients to\nwhat they're afraid of\nand then we just let the fear come up\nand then we just don't do anything with\nit and then the fear like kind of\nnaturally extinguishes so what i would\nrecommend is share with your partner\nwhat's going on in your head\nbut don't try to fall into the trap of\nreassurance\nbefore you do that can i ask you a few\nquestions\nyes how how long have you been together\num\na little bit more than a year more than\na year\ngo ahead logan\na long distance so\nwe have met like maybe\nthree times\nare you still long distance\nyes we're probably like\nuh not being long distance but for now\nwe're long distance but the few times we\nhave met\ni noticed that it's you know\nit's not only\nover online video calls that i feel that\nwhenever he makes uh\nenough\nangry look or something that i fear that\nhe's mad at me\nit's also\nthe same\nin real life so i notice it's not about\nlike the\nuh\nonline things can be you know confusing\nit's the same in real life too\nand okay so long-distance relationship\ndid you meet in person or you met online\nin person\nah okay um and how long did you know\neach other in person\nuh\nabout the whole view\nwith what in person\nokay and were the kind of size and looks\num at that\ndid that happen when you were first\ntogether\ni'm trying to understand if this is like\na new thing or if this has always been\nthere no\nwhen we first went together i\ndidn't notice that it was like\na bit later that it started coming when\nwe get to know each other more and stuff\ngot it\nanother question that i have is is it\nokay for your partner to be mad at you\ni guess not\ni guess i'm like really sensitive to\nlike\nbeing mad at me\nlike a few times you have been mad at me\nit has been\nreally like bad for me\nyeah so i think more long term so i\nthink there's like a short term like\ncommunication is key here and what is\ncommunication because everyone's like\ncommunication is really important but no\none ever tells you like what does that\nactually mean so i would share that you\nknow i\nfor some reason my mind is telling me\nthat you're upset with me right now and\nit's making me uncomfortable\nhave have\nwhen he\nwas\nis it mad at you or upset with you\nlike\nare these situations where\nhe feels like you've wronged him in some\nway and has been like angry with you\nor are these like more just general\nyeah no the first one okay so like set\nwith me okay and then it does not happen\na lot but you know it happens sometimes\nvery rarely\nokay and then when you\nwhen you guys make up do you\ntalk about how hey that was really hard\nfor me when you got that angry with me\num yeah\nyou talk about it\nand\nwhat what he says it's it's usually like\nyeah i know i probably shouldn't have\nlike\ngotten that\nmad at you like i probably shouldn't\nhave\nstarted\nwith the insults you know that was like\na step before i should have kept it like\nmoral\nokay objective you know okay but like\nyeah i feel like i understand a little\nbit more um and i definitely\nagree with what alex said\nbut i do think\nin addition to this\nyou can have some boundaries over what\nyou are willing and not willing\nto like\nengage with\nso\nyou can say like hey i really can't\nhandle it when you get angry with me\nlike this\nand that and if you are feeling this way\ni need some space i need some time i\nneed you to because you're a long\ndistance also that makes it hard so you\ncan be like can you write this down for\nme because it's hard for me to\nbe in a situation where\num\ni think you're going to explode at me or\nsomething i don't know the dynamic\nexactly but i i think\ni don't i don't like the idea of\nsomebody going about their relationship\nkind of constantly in fear of their\npartner getting mad at them so i feel\nlike having conversations around like\nhow to healthily\nexpress\nthat you're not happy about something\nthe other one is doing is a good idea\nlike i think it's\na good idea to have conversations around\nlike\nyou know i'm getting a little anxious\nthat you're getting upset with me\nbecause the last time we went through\nthis this was really hard for me so if\nyou are upset with me can you please\nlike fill in the blank can you please\nlet me know before it gets bad can you\nplease write it down for me so i can\nknow what's going on with you can you\nplease um\njust be straightforward that hey i'm\ndoing something that upsets you like\nwhatever that\nirrelevant situation is but i i think\ni'm\nnervous\nthat you would um\nkind of have that constant fear because\nlong-distance relationships are hard so\nsometimes i think\nlike if that is what is happening\nthen i feel like a conversation about\nhow to\ncommunicate discontent with each other\nis a good idea\nthere's a possibility um\nlike i know we were long distance for\nyears and sometimes like\nsometimes i feel like olive got the\nworst of me because that was the time\nwhere i was like i've had such a shitty\nday and here's all the bad stuff that's\nhappening and he was the person that i\nwould kind of like unload on\nand\ni think there's a way like\nif that could have easily been\ninterpreted as like god this girl does\nnot want to be with me like she's angry\nwith me because she like i'm the i'm\nconstantly hearing the complaints so\ni i guess\nif i had to like branch this out right\nlike he either is mad at you or he's not\nif he's not mad at you what is actually\ngoing on if he is mad at you\nhave some conversations around\nboundaries and what's going on in like\nhealthy expressions of\nanger and i also really like the idea of\nlike once you make up like what did we\nlearn\nuh i don't know\nlike when you make up do you feel like\noh this i've learned that he doesn't\nlike this or i've learned that when i do\nthis this is like something that he\ncan't\ndeal with\nyeah i guess you do like you you learn\num\nhow the person like felt when you did\nsomething\nyou cannot understand them better\nright do you feel like you could do what\nruthie is asking you to do\num\ncommunicating when i start to feel like\nhe's mad at me\ni'm sorry\nwhat\nlike communicating when i feel like he's\nmad do you think you could do that do\nyou think you could set boundaries on\nhim about\nhow insulting you is not okay\ni feel like he won't listen when he's\nangry\nwhat about when he's not angry\nhe's not angry yes\nokay so i think that's useful i think\nthe other thing to just remember or\nmaybe i can ask you is\nwhat kind of emotions\nshould you expect your partner to feel\nover the course of your relationship\nwhat do you mean by over the course of\nso like let's say you date this person\nfor another year\nwhich emotions do you think your partner\nwill feel over the course of that year\num\nall kinds of emotions like yeah\nright exactly\nso like\nin a weird way i know it's kind of weird\nbut like he's gonna get angry\nand that's okay it's like part of the\nprice you pay for being in a\nrelationship right because you're not\nthe perfect partner and he isn't the\nperfect partner but angry with her\nsure\nfor\nbut it sounds like she's\nshe doesn't see it coming like\nit's just kind of out of\nwell i mean i think there's a couple\nthings so you can absolutely do all the\ncommunication stuff but\nyou know what i'm really noticing is\nthat there's a part of you that feels\nlike anger in a relationship is\nunacceptable and should be avoided at\nall costs\nis that fair\nyeah\nso i think\nthat i think is you're setting an\nunrealistic expectation on yourself\nbecause\nit is a part of relationships\ndoes that make sense\nit may be terrifying\nwhat do you think about that\num\nyeah i think that you know that as\nyou're saying that he's gonna feel all\nkinds of emotions because he's human too\nand uh\ni can't expect him to not ever get angry\nbecause then he would be like a robot\nyou know\num\ni have to accept that he's going to be\nangry sometimes and be angry with me\nsometimes even but\nso i'm just a bit confused\nhow i can like\nassume somebody is mad to me is because\nthey like\nsigh\nand then even though i ask him like all\nthe time like are you mad at me when he\ndoes that\nand he says no\nhe's still like the next time he sigh i\nstill\nare like are you mad at me like even\nthough i constantly get told\npsy doesn't equal that somebody's mad at\nyou yeah so i think there's there's\nthat's where the communication piece\ncomes in so i think there's like two\nthings here just to kind of summarize\none is the communication piece\nthat when you're feeling like this\nperson is angry with you sometimes it\nsounds like that perception is actually\nincorrect\nthe challenge is that if we put\nourselves in his shoes\nhow is he if you\nif he sighs\nwhich humans do and you interpret that\nas anger like how can he kind of fix\nthat right because it's kind of hard\nbecause it's kind of like the example i\nshared with ruthie where it's like if\ni'm like hey are you mad at me\nand she says no and i'm like oh she's\njust saying that that's what my mind\nwill tell me right she's not really\ntelling me what's going on so you're\nsort of setting up a situation in which\nlike there's only one outcome because\nyou're not able to be reassured\nso communication there is really\nimportant but i think the other thing\nthat is more long-term is just your\nrelationship\nwith being in a unable to\ntolerate his anger so if he's insulting\nyou and stuff that's not acceptable so\nyou should set boundaries around that\nmaybe not while he's angry but after the\nfact you can say hey you know like\nthat's really not okay so completely\nagree with that but just for you to\nunderstand that first of all he's gonna\nget upset in relationships\nhe may get upset with you and this is\nthe wild thing\njust because he's upset with you doesn't\nmean that you did something wrong\nright because like sometimes we get mad\nat people in fact frequently we get mad\nat people especially those closest to us\nwhen we are upset with something else in\nour life right right so if i'm having\nproblems at work\nand i can't yell at my boss and i'm\ncarrying that anger around with me\nwhat am i going to do when i get home\ni'm going to lash out at my family\nmembers\nright so that's where like he may even\nget angry with you but somewhere along\nthe way you've got to do some like good\ndeep work\nand understand that\njust because he's mad at you doesn't\nactually mean that you're doing anything\nwrong\nbecause that's just the way that humans\nare he may not be able to separate his\nanger or frustration with other things\nfrom\nand make you know he may let it out on\nyou in some way which isn't good on his\npart i'm not saying that that's okay but\nit's we're human\nand for you to sort of understand that\nlike\nhe may sometimes get mad at you because\nthat's what happens in relationships\nsometimes it's unfortunate but we offer\nthe worst parts of ourselves\nto the people that we care about the\nmost and the people that we're closest\nto\nthoughts about that\ni think\nit sounds so good\num\nbut i remember you you also said\nsomething that caught my interest about\num\nlike\nnot trying to avoid\num the fear like\nnot trying to fix the fear but like\nsitting with the fear\nit cannot maybe the same thing as\ncommunicating i don't know but yes\nso i'll give you i'll give you an\nexample okay\nso i was once working with someone who\nhad been\nin a prior relationship where their\npartner was unfaithful with them\nso this person started to dis like they\nhad a lot of distrust because they had\nbeen betrayed\nand so later a couple years later they\nfound a new relationship\nended up getting pregnant\nand what they sort of noticed is as they\ngot more pregnant and as they started to\nfeel insecure about their body\nthey started to become really really\nparanoid that their partner would start\nbeing unfaithful with them completely\ndifferent person and the person had not\nreally given them any reason to\nyou know think that this person is going\nto be unfaithful you following me so far\nno\nand so then what would happen is the the\nperson would uh so the\nthe person i was working with the\npregnant woman\nwould\nbe afraid be paranoid okay like my\npartner's cheating on me so what she\nwould do is when he would take a shower\nat night she would start going through\nhis phone\nand just to make sure\nthat he wasn't doing anything bad right\nso then she did it once\nand she was like okay so it looks like i\nhave nothing to worry about\nand then\nafter she checked his phone once do you\nthink the fear went away\nno\nabsolutely not right so then she was\nlike okay i have nothing to worry about\nwent away for a couple of days and then\nit started creeping back in\nthe more her belly grew bigger the less\nattractive she felt the more the\nparanoia got worse and then she started\nchecking his phone more frequently\nand then it got to the point where she\nchecked his phone every night when he\nwent to take a shower and after she did\nthat for a week do you think she stopped\nno\nof course not right so the more that she\ngave into the fear\nthe like\nthe big the bigger it became\nand so eventually he caught her right\nand then like they went they both wound\nup in my office\nand so we sort of had a conversation\nabout it and then what we sort of came\nto the conclusion of because he felt\nlike it was a betrayal of trust he felt\nlike it was very very unfair for her to\nthink those thoughts about him\nbecause he had been nothing but faithful\nand he was like i've never done anything\nthat you know i've nev like it's not\nfair what you're doing\nlike i understand that you're afraid but\nit's not fair to me that you're\nviolating my privacy\nand so then what we kind of came to the\nconclusion and the person was like i\nactually don't mind that you're looking\nthrough my phone like i have nothing to\nhide but like the fact that you're kind\nof doing it behind my back and like i\nfeel kind of violated\nand so then what we sort of came to the\nconclusion of is when she's feeling that\nway she should communicate that to him\nand then something cool started to\nhappen so he she tells him hey like i'm\nfeeling kind of paranoid i'm feeling\nlike you know you're gonna find someone\nwho's prettier than me and someone who's\nnot pregnant and and things like that\nand and so he'd be like you know that's\nnot the case do you want to look through\nmy phone\nand then she'd he'd offer it right and\nthen she'd say like no no no it's okay\nand then like over time what happened is\nlike every time she sort of felt that\nway he was like you can look through my\nphone if you want to would that make you\nfeel better and she would say no\nand then over time she's like you know\ni'm kind of feeling like i want to look\nthrough your phone and then they just\nlike sit together they talk about it for\na few minutes and then they'd be fine\nso sort of like acknowledging the fear\nnoticing the fear but not giving into it\nkind of together\nseem to actually diminish it because\nthen she's not giving into it so the\nthoughts and emotions in our mind that\nwe give into\nare the ones that grow\ndoes that make sense in terms of how to\nsit with something\nyes\nit makes very much sense\nright\nand someone in chat is saying second\nphone confirmed\nand believe me that was a part of the\nconversation as well\nright and then eventually what you\nrealize is there's like\nif someone if your partner is paranoid\nthere's nothing you can do\nthere's some stuff you can do within\nreason\nbut there's no amount of objective truth\nthat you can give to the paranoid mind\nto convince it\ndoes that make sense like people can be\nso damn paranoid that second phones\nthird phones fourth phones fifth\nphones right like the like your mind can\nget\ntake control of you and so that's where\ni'm i'm sort of suggesting that you talk\nto your partner about\nhow you're feeling and then you'll learn\nhow to sit with it\num as opposed to\nyou know kind of giving into it\nor stopping feeling that way\nthat's mine okay\ndoes that answer does that help\nyes it helps very much thank you thank\nyou for calling in and good luck good\nluck i hope you all are able to\nbe long just i mean not be long distance\nanymore because that sucks it does\nthank you for having me\nbye\nyou"
