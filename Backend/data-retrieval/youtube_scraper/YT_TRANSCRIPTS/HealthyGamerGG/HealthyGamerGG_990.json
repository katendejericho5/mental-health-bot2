    "transcript": "people have figured out that more\nsensory input is like better at engaging\nhumans so if you look at like a like a\nsale sign if the sign is bigger if it's\nmore brightly colored it's more likely\nto engage you everyone is competing for\nyou to watch their pornography and so\nwhat they tend to do is like amp things\nup and as they amp things up this is the\nother thing that we're sort of seeing in\nin pornography usage especially with\nproblematic usage is that what used to\nsexually excite you like doesn't work\nanymore so your brain needs like harder\nand harder stuff to like get you excited\nso this is where like a lot of times if\nwe look at the way that people are\ninterpreting the data it's more subtle\nthan I think people give it credit for\nbecause everyone wants a simple answer\nand oftentimes we have preconceived\nnotions when we are looking at the data\nthank you\nso I like porn and masturbation and I'm\nokay with that am I addicted\nI see lately that the last two three\nyears porn and masturbation are mostly\nportrayed as something bad 10 to 15\nyears ago it was absolutely okay and\nthere was a huge amount of papers that\neveryone masturbates and it's healthy\nthough it's healthy enough I think\nI know that every Everything could be an\naddiction reading eating exercises how\nto tell an addiction from just Health a\nhealthy thing\nthe thing is though I really like sex\narousal and for me it's something purely\nhappy and positive I just love it and\nunironically plan to start writing\nerotic porn stories or fanfics usually\nporn is associated with something bad\nand low quality and I think it shouldn't\nwe should get rid of prejudices\nunhealthy ways of making pornography of\nmisogyny Etc but there's also good porn\ntext Art healthy porn isn't it we should\nmake it better healthier and more with\nmore quality in my opinion that that no\none listens Saxon porn when it's healthy\nit's about love and meditation about\nkindness and trust my question is am I\nright\ndoes my love to this\nuh does my love of this count as an\naddiction or not and if I don't have any\nproblems with this is that kind of okay\nthe most negative thing in all that\npeople usually hate porn and I'm sad\nwhen people hate such a good thing\nso\nfor a long time people have been\ndebating about whether porn and\nmasturbation are good or bad and even\nsex for that matter is it good or is it\nbad\nand so we'll talk a lot about\npornography addiction right so we'll say\nlike some people will say oh my God I\nwatch pornography too much I'm addicted\nsometimes we'll also hear from people\nlike significant others or parents right\nwhere the like the significant other was\nlike I don't like it when my SO watches\nporn my Esso is addicted to porn will\nget kind of complaints on that\nsometimes you know you'll have parents\nwho are concerned\nso how do you know if something is a\nproblem and if it isn't a problem so\nthat's kind of the first question here\nthe second thing is like what do we know\nabout pornography right or is there is\nthere actually like science or data\nbecause they're sort of saying you know\nthere were a huge amount of papers that\neveryone masturbates and it's healthy\nso what what does the science kind of\nsay now like what's the conclusion have\nwe kind of swung back towards addiction\nwas there sort of this like body\npositivity and acceptance movement\nwhere you know people were kind of\ntalking about pornography as an evil and\nthen a bunch of research came out saying\neveryone jerks off or masturbates\nand\num so like what's up with that so let's\ntalk about that for a second\nand so then you also have people you\nknow like this who are sort of saying\nthat pornography for me sex for me is\nlike about love it's about kindness It's\nabout trust we can Elevate pornography\nto an art form and it really can be\nartistic it can be something that's\namazing and and you know like\na human achievement that signals the\nprogress of cultural you know or\ncultural progression\nand\nour true artiste we can we can make\nfanfics that are not lulled at but are\nactually like amazing works of art\nso what's the deal like what do we\nactually know about this stuff\nso we're going to sort of go through a\nquick sort of history of pornography\njust based on my understanding of it and\nspecifically the relationship with\nresearch\nand then we're also going to look at\nstatistics today about you know what is\nlike what do people say like is\npornography like healthy or unhealthy\nwhat is the research show what does it\nnot show which is a big part of it\nso the first thing is let's talk a\nlittle bit about kind of the\nmoralization of sex I'm not an expert in\nthis right so like my background is in\nscience so\nfor a long time though we know that like\nsex became a dirty thing due to morality\nand religion for the most part I mean\nthere's going to be some amount of you\nknow that that's a over generalization\nso for example in the Hindu tradition\nyou have this thing called the Kamasutra\nso Sutra is like a religious text and\nGod means\nuh enjoyment I guess pleasure maybe\npleasure is the best word\nuh desire or pleasure or something like\nthat\nand so it's sort of something that's\nregarded as a religious text but it's\nlike a manual about how to have sex\nright that that's what the gamsutra is\nand so in many cultures like sex was\nokay celebrated Etc and then in in some\nof the more Christian Traditions it\nstarted to get like kind of\nfrowned upon\nso you'll even have some of these\nextreme things like I remember the\noriginal reason for long tablecloths I\ndon't know if this is actually true or\nnot or if it's apocryphal is that people\nwere afraid like some of the Quakers or\nsomeone I that may be a misattribution\nof I don't mean to offend a Quaker I\njust don't remember exactly who\ndeveloped long table cloths or the\nveracity of the story but what I\nremember reading somewhere\nI don't know if that makes it true was\nthat tablecloths were lengthened because\nthe table legs would arouse lust\nright so we can't see a table leg\nbecause that'll turn people on and lust\nis a bad thing it's one of the seven\ndeadly sins right\nso you know we started to get sort of\nlike moral\nlike negative moral associations with\nthings like lost and masturbation and\nsex and stuff like that and then it\nstarted becoming evil right and then\npeople started feeling really guilty\num I think we had a lot of problems with\nsuppressed sexuality\num and then papers started coming out\nright that like okay people actually\nstarted studying it so instead of taking\na moral perspective we started to take a\nscientific perspective is sex healthy or\nunhealthy is masturbation normal or not\nnormal is it you know okay or not okay\nand then we had a bunch of papers that\nsort of show that okay masturbation is\nlike very common\nit doesn't seem to kind of mess people\nup\nseems to be kind of okay\nand then is the pornography industry\nevolved right so it started out with\nlike photographs and magazines and then\nvideos\nand then we sort of like moved on to the\ninternet and now we've sort of seen like\nmuch like other things on the internet\npornography is getting more intense\nflashier more colorful more immersive\nintense sounds intense sights\nlike like the\nthe sensory experience of pornography is\njust getting enhanced right so if you\nlook at for example a black and white\ndrawing of someone who's naked versus a\nblack and white photograph we've become\na little bit more real and a little bit\nmore engaging and then we add color\npornography then we add sort of like\nlongitudinal pornography where you'll\nhave like not just one isolated picture\nbut a series of pictures\nand then we have video\nand we may have had Silent Video at some\npoint who knows black and white video at\nsome point and then we have sound right\nand now we've got like 4K and now we've\ngot like intense colors and now we've\ngot you know like surround sound and now\nwe have VR\nand so what's happening is like\npornography is getting more and more\nintensive it's getting more and more\nvibrant we're also getting to select a\nlot more so\npornography is becoming more and more\nspecialized and we're now also getting\nnot just like the purely sensory\ncomponent but we're starting to get\nemotional components to pornography as\nwell right so with the Advent of some\nplatforms where you can interact\nand commission particular kinds of\npornography and you can get a\npornographic someone who's creating\npornography to interact with you thank\nyou directly like you can form some kind\nof pseudo relationship or even real\nrelationship I don't know exactly what\nit is\nso now like it's getting more intense\nright\nand as it's getting more intense we've\nseen as this person kind of pointed out\na wave of Publications talking about\nlike problems with porn addiction so\npeople are struggling more\nerectile dysfunction and delayed\nejaculation or on the rise for people\nunder men under 40. so that's kind of\nlike a concerning phenomenon that we've\nobserved and we'll kind of get into that\nso generally speaking we think about\nerectile dysfunction as a problem that's\nassociated with age and other conditions\nlike hypertension or obesity or things\nlike that but what we're starting to see\nis that there's a higher or appears to\nbe a higher number of people who are\nlike 25 30 35 who have difficulty\nejaculating maintaining erections things\nlike that and so people have started to\nwonder and as people have sort of also\nsaid like I'm addicted to pornography\nit's negatively impacted relationships\nand stuff people have wondered okay is\npornography bad again are we putting it\ninto the\nare we putting it into that category\nokay\nso now like what do we understand about\nthis like where where what's the verdict\nis pornography something that's okay is\nmasturbation okay is it not okay\nand the short answer is much like\nanything else in reality that you want\nto look at scientifically it's not\nbinary right it's more complicated than\nthat so let's go go ahead and take a\nquick look at what the research shows\nthe first thing to understand is that\nlike people through surveys we know that\nabout 76 percent of men watch\npornography\nand about 41 41 to 46 percent of women\nwatch pornography and that was six years\nago\nso a lot of people may say like that\nnumber is entirely too low for both\ngenders so we know also that\num\nthat the rate of pornography consumption\nis increasing so I guess that those\nnumbers are even higher now uh we also\nknow that a lot of gender differences\nthat used to exist seem to be shrinking\nvery rapidly so gender disparities in\nterms of some of these phenomenon like\npornography use playing video games for\nexample\num seem to be like shrinking very\nrapidly\nalso some I'm noticing like there used\nto be like maybe a two to one ratio of\nwomen who experience anxiety due to uh\nepidemiologic data compared to men\nwhereas I personally think that that\nnumber seems to be shrinking as well so\nI think that we're seeing some trends of\nlike gender disparities I don't mean in\nterms of\ngender disparities is a bad thing I mean\nalmost gender disparities is a good\nthing like one gender was you know\nexperienced more of an addiction than\nthe other gender so what we're seeing is\nlike this stuff seems to be shrinking\nso pornography use for example like\nwomen or quote unquote catching up to\nMen I'm not saying that that's a good\nthing or a bad thing that's just seems\nto be the direction that the data is\ngoing\num so the first thing is so a lot of\npeople use it\nand then what are the concerns that\npeople have we have in terms of\npornography so when people say that\npornography is bad what are the concerns\nthat we have so the first is something\ncalled an addiction\nso how do you know if you have an\naddiction and in Psychiatry when we look\nat diagnostic criteria for addiction\nthere's one major criteria that spans\nall of the addictions which is\nimpairment of function\nso if your pornography use or\nmasturbation or sexual behavior is\ncausing problems in your life then it is\nmuch more likely to like cross over into\naddiction\nso if engaging in sexual behavior is\nnegatively impacting your marriage if\nengaging in sexual behavior is causing\nyou to get you know STIs sexually\ntransmitted infections\nif\num you know like masturbating prevents\nyou from going to work or you get in\ntrouble at work for masturbating like\nthose are the kinds of things that we\nreally kind of think of in terms of\naddiction so when someone is addicted to\nsomething they tend to have negative\nconsequences in their life but they're\nunable to stop and thus open themselves\nup to those negative consequences\nand so I know everyone's memeing about\nmasturbating at work that's not a joke\nand it's not a meme like that happens to\npeople who are truly addicted\nand for people who think like LOL I'm\naddicted to pornography like you got to\nunderstand there are people out there\nwho are truly addicted and fall into\nthat problem\nso another good example of this is\nsomething like you know driving Under\nthe Influence okay so like this is where\npeople who are addicted will drive under\nthe influence they'll get you know their\nlicense taken away and then they'll\nstill continue driving\nbecause they can't help themselves right\nso they're they're someone who's so\naddicted to the substance that in spite\nof the negative consequences of using\nthe substance they continue using it and\nit causes all kinds of problems so we'll\nsee that a lot in in more substance use\ndisorders where people will empty their\nbank accounts they'll get divorced\nthey'll lose their job and all kinds of\nthings but they continue using\nso if something isn't you know do you\nhave a pornography addiction or not does\nit impair your function is like a really\nreally important thing\nsecond thing is that oftentimes people\nwho are addicted to something can make\nattempts to cut back and fail to do so\nso the other thing about addiction is it\ntends to control you instead of you\ncontrolling it and if you all are\nconcerned about something like this this\nis absolutely where you should go see a\nmedical professional and try to figure\nout you know first of all do you have an\naddiction or not and secondly like how\nto get help for it because this is\nsomething that not everyone can overcome\non their own which is like perfectly\nfine that that's why we have addiction\nspecialists because we recognize that\nsome people need help\nokay so that's what an addiction is now\nthe other thing is that there are a\nnumber of different\nphenomenon that are arising\nthat appear to be problematic and are\ncorrelated with pornography use so\nthat's just a fancy stupid academic way\nof saying porn appears to be causing\nsome problems masturbation appears to be\ncausing some problems and so what are\nthe problems when we think about asking\nthe question is masturbation healthy or\nunhealthy let's step aside from\naddiction for a moment but what what is\nmasturbation and pornography doing to\nour society what are we seeing in terms\nof changes or trends\nso first thing that people talk a little\nbit about is\nerectile dysfunction and uh delayed\nejaculation or problems with ejaculation\nso that also tends to be first of all\nbiased towards men right so most of the\nresearch on pornography and sex\naddiction I think has been focused on\nmen\nso you'll have studies for example that\nare done out of urology clinics because\nerectile dysfunction is what people\npresent with\nso there that's kind of the first thing\nanother thing that people will talk a\nlittle bit about is that like our reward\ncircuitry is kind of getting all messed\nup\nso people will say I'm not able to be\naroused by sexual intercourse that may\nhave something to do with the inability\nto ejaculate or reach climax\nbecause something about the stimulation\nin the brain from pornography is like so\nmuch more vibrant in some ways than like\nreal life that like our receptors kind\nof get like out of whack so there's like\nsome concern that we're sort of shaping\nour brains and in kind of an unhealthy\nway\nthere's also some concerns about uh real\nlife sex becoming like boring or like\nnot engageable so this is something that\nconfuses a lot of people is we tend to\nromanticize or even like not even I feel\nlike some romanticize isn't really the\nright word we tend to imagine sex as\nsomething that's like very intense and\nexplosive and orgasmic right so if we\nwatch pornography and our brain develops\nan idea of what sex is supposed to be\nlike when we end up having sex like it\nturns out to be like somewhat\ndisappointing smelly like confusing and\nthen people start questioning their\nsexuality or they start wondering am I\nasexual like all kinds of like problems\narise and so we're sort of shaping our\nexpectations in sort of an unhealthy way\nthe third dimension that we're sort of\nthinking about in terms of what problems\npornography and masturbation can cause\nare relationship problems\nand so a lot of times what it'll create\nproblems in a relationship right so if\nyou're not able to achieve climax with a\npartner or if your partner feels kind of\nyou know unloved or you have\ndifficulties or has concerns about your\npornography use that can lead to\nproblems\nand so these are kind of the three\nthings that we're going to talk about\ntoday\nthe first thing that we're going to talk\na little bit about is sort of this like\ndelayed ejaculation erectile dysfunction\ndifficulty reaching climax\nso this is where we have to be kind of\ncareful with the research because a lot\nof the research is correlative so what\nthey say is they'll look at like people\nwho have erectile dysfunction\nor they'll look at people who are unable\nto like achieve climax in a sexual\nrelationship\nand they will\nask them how much pornography do you use\nand what they'll sort of find is this\nfinding that\npeople who watch more pornography or\nhave more difficulty achieving climax in\nsexual intercourse than people who don't\nnow this is where things get subtle but\nvery tricky because at this point people\noftentimes will conclude if you watch a\nbunch of porn it's going to make it hard\nfor you to have sex\nbut remember that cross-sectional\nstudies or correlations are not\ncausation so this is where the flip side\nof this could be if you have difficulty\nengaging in sex\nyou may reach more towards pornography\nright so it can go either way actually\nso like if my sexual relationship is\nunsatisfying what effect do you think\nthat will have on my pornography\nconsumption it'll probably increase\nright\nso this is where like a lot of times if\nwe look at the way that people are\ninterpreting the data\nit's more subtle than I think people\ngive it credit for because everyone\nwants a simple answer and oftentimes we\nhave preconceived notions when we are\nlooking at the data so this person is\ngoing to be pro-pornography so they may\nlook at the data in a particular way\nwhereas other people like if I'm in a\nrelationship and my partner watches a\nbunch of pornography and we have an\nunfulfilling sex life what do you think\nI'm going to do in terms of the\ninterpretation of that data I'm going to\nassume that the pornography is the\nproblem and is causing this issue in our\nrelationship versus we have an issue in\nour relationship and pornography is\nactually like it's not the problem it's\nthe antidote for that person right so\nthere do seem to be clear correlations\nbetween\nincreased pornography use\num\ndifficulty maintaining erections and\nerectile dysfunction and problems with\nejaculation and reaching climax so that\nis something that like I've worked with\npeople for and I do believe that\npornography has a causative effect there\nthat's personally the way I think the\nrelationship goes more likely\num and part of that is is just because\nof like physiologic conditioning so for\nexample the the actual physical\nexperience of if you're a man\nmasturbating with your hand or if you're\na woman like you know using a vibrator\nor direct clitoral stimulation versus\npenetrative sex is like quite different\nright so the actual physiologic\nstimulation is like very different there\nare different Sensations\nand so I think a large part of this is\nthat if you sort of almost entrain your\nbody to to become sexually climax in a\nparticular way and that kind of in\ntraining is going to happen through\npornography use and masturbation it's\ngoing to be difficult to transition over\nto sex it can be done for sure\num but it's the kind of thing that like\nthere may actually be a causative\ncomponent there I personally think there\nis because I think just based on my\nunderstanding of physiology I think it's\nexceedingly strange for men under the\nage of 40 to have erectile dysfunction\nthat's not an indictment it just means\nthat something serious is going on\nthat's creating this effect and that's\nwhat has to be deal dealt with so first\nthing is that there does appear to be a\ncorrelation between pornography and\nmasturbation usage and things like\nerectile dysfunction delayed gratif\ndelayed ejaculation and like inability\nto perform sexually\nsecond thing that we're going to talk\nabout is reward stimulation circuitry in\nthe brain\nso this is where\nyou know people have figured out\nthat more sensory input is like\nbetter at engaging humans\nso if you look at like a like a sale\nsign\nif the sign is bigger if it's more\nbrightly colored it's more likely to\nengage you so you'll kind of see this\nwith like advertisements and stuff like\nthat where like I don't know if you guys\nhave ever experienced this it's freaking\nannoying where like you know the volume\nof a TV show will be here and then the\nad will be like 30 percent louder and\nit's just really inconvenient but it it\nshocks you into paying attention\nso human beings have figured out how to\nengage the human brain and so if you\nlook at apps right apps are like\nbeautiful they're not like grayscale\nthey're they're like you know they have\nall these buttons and like little bits\nof motion and like you guys know like\nyou know even these things like Candy\nCrush and Jelly Splash and stuff like\nthat they're like jiggly you know what I\nmean they're like\nyou know it's kind of weird like so\npeople have figured out that if you add\nlike a little bit of jiggliness to an\napp it it increases the amount of like\nengagement you'll even see this with\nsort of like the the chibi kind of like\nartwork right there's something there's\nsomething like cute and engaging about\nround figures that are a little bit more\ncolorful and stuff like that right you\nguys get that\nso people have sort of figured out\nthat there's real life\nand our brains have learned to adapt to\nparticular kinds of things right so if\nyou look at like\nyou know bird mating and you look at\npeacocks so like peacocks will have this\nvery vibrant colorful thing which like\nengages male peacocks will like spread\ntheir feathers out and they'll dance and\nit's like it's like a show that's like\nvery bright and colorful and like\nsensorially engaging right and human\nbeings like peacocks too like why do we\nlike peacocks because they're bright and\ncolorful\nand so the brain likes that kind of\nstuff so I think what's happening in\npornography and you get other weird\nkinds of like\nFringe or Niche pornography that engages\nour brain in like more and more profound\nways that actually separates a little\nbit from reality\nright because even if you look at sex\nlike it's a little bit jiggly right\nthat's part of the enjoyment of it and\nso what people are I think what's going\non with pornography is we're seeing like\nmore and more like Niche pornography\nwe're seeing more sensory sensorially\nengaging pornography brighter sounds\nsharper resolution\nyou know like like more engagement more\npeople involved in the scene like\nthere's just there's just an evolution\npeople are sort of figuring out because\nremember that pornography is a\ncompetition for the producers right\neveryone is competing for you to watch\ntheir pornography and so what they tend\nto do is like amp things up\nand as they amp things up this is the\nother thing that we're sort of seeing in\nin pornography usage especially with\nproblematic usage is that what used to\nsexually excite you like doesn't work\nanymore so your brain needs like harder\nand harder stuff to like get you excited\nand so we're seeing like more Niche\npornography we're seeing more hardcore\npornography we're seeing stuff that's\nlike bizarrely addictive because it kind\nof tricks your brain into thinking\ncertain things it's hard to describe I'm\nnot going to go into detail but\num you know there's evolutions of\npornography so I do think that there's\nthere's definitely like a\nneuroscientific exploitive component\ngoing on with the evolution of\npornography which I don't think is Alfie\nso as we get more and more\nartificially stimulated through more\nvibrant pornography I think it makes it\nharder to engage in sexual relationships\nthat are more natural right\nand we sort of see this not just in\npornography we see it with like chicken\nnuggets right and tendies where it's\nlike what's happening is we're figuring\nout as a society how to optimize the\nexperience of like eating chicken and as\nwe batter it as we fry it as we do this\nas we do that it becomes more and more\ntasty so we figured out our natural\ntaste buds our natural like you know\ninsulin receptors and things like that\nwe figured out like how to capitalize on\nwhat our body likes and people will make\nspecific products for it that sort of\ntake advantage of those receptors and\nthen people will end up eating like 2\n000 calories in a meal because it tastes\nso damn good and then over time what\nthat ends up doing is being actually\nprobably bad for us right\nand so I think we're seeing a similar\nthing in pornography it's just something\nthat as we're figuring out what works on\nin the brain\npeople who produce things and are trying\nto sell you stuff will move in that\ndirection okay so we're seeing that\nnext thing is dissatisfaction with\nPartners so this is where the other\nchallenge that we tend to find is that a\nlot of times pornography and\nmasturbation will create interpersonal\ndifficulties so in some instances like\nwe've talked about it's difficult to\nhave sex with a partner because of all\nof the above stuff right so maybe\nbecause like your brain like you've been\nover shaped by pornographic interactions\nyour physiologic your physiology has\nbeen has been conditioned to climax in a\nparticular situation so you can't sort\nof do that with a partner that's\nactually increasingly common but there\nare all kinds of other things as well\nwhere remember the other thing that we\nsaid is that it's not necessarily one\ndirectional where maybe a\ndissatisfactory sex life leads to more\npornography consumption more\nmasturbation Etc right so that I think\nmakes perfect sense as well\nso this is where if you have a problem\nwith pornography in your relationship I\nthink the most important thing there is\nlike communication\nso that's where like communicating your\nthoughts where a lot of times what\npeople will do is they'll come to a\nconclusion and push for a behavioral\nchange so they'll say the reason we're\nnot having a good sex life or it really\nbothers me that you're you're watching\npornography I want you to stop so I'll\nsee this a lot I'm going to sort of\nassume a male I mean a female person\ncomplaining and a male person is the\npornography consumer here it doesn't\nnecessarily have to be that way but\nthat's more of clinically what I've seen\nwhere a lot of times issues of things\nlike self-esteem and personal like\nconcerns that someone may have about\ntheir own body image or their their\ncomfort in their body which make kind of\nmake sense right so if you're if you're\na normal human and your partner is\nwatching\npornography of artificial humans right\nwho have different kinds of cosmetic\nsurgery and makeup and all this other\nkinds of stuff like it can it can feel\nit can encourage insecurity right\nbecause it's like an artificially\nperfect person\nand the artificially perfect person by\nthe way\nyou know doesn't get older right because\nlike as pornographic actors and\nactresses generally speaking as they age\nnewer younger people come in and so like\nthe constant diet of pornography is\ngoing to be like consuming a particular\nage range and then you as a human being\ncan't compete with that because you\ncan't stay forever youthful so all kinds\nof like internal challenges in terms of\nrelationships self-esteem that\npornography can create you know is it a\ndissatisfying sex life that's leading to\npornography usage is it pornography\nthat's leading to a dissatisfied sex\nlife the short answer is that it's not a\none-size-fits-all kind of solution and a\nconversation is really really important\nright or multiple conversations sharing\nyour concerns trying to understand where\nyour partner is coming from trying to\nunderstand why they watch pornography\nwhat it does for them and trying to come\ntogether to sort of figure out like\nwhat's an acceptable Middle Ground\num generally speaking I'm not a huge fan\nof ultimatums but this is also where\nsometimes if you really have an\naddictive problem where someone you know\nis it's really negatively impacting your\nrelationship those consequences need to\nbe shared in a very severe way if there\nare severe problems\nso I think communication is a huge part\nin trying to figure out you know how to\nlike\nnavigate that so the good news is that\nI've had a lot of success helping\ncouples like arrive at some kind of\nhealthy medium and some of that if you\nguys have seen the video on death grip\nsyndrome like there are things like that\nwhere you can physiologically\nrecondition your body to enjoy sexual\nexperience more\num and that just involves you know\ncertain steps which we're not going to\ngo into now\nso those are all valid concerns\nso the the last thing that I want to\nshare with you all is so if we sort of\nask the question is pornography a\nproblem is masturbation a problem so\nI'll leave y'all with the simple\nstatistic okay which I think sort of\nsettles it not I mean doesn't settle it\nbut really helps me understand it or\norganize it in my mind which is that\nresearchers did a study where they asked\n820 men\num then once again this is on men right\nso that there's a huge bias there are\nlots of biases in the literature where\nwe just study men a lot more than women\nwith respect to this there's a lot of\nfurther research needed\nuh but people ask men like what\nyou know they just tried to figure out\nlike which Camp do these people fall\ninto so sure Dr K is saying it could be\na problem here it could be a problem\nhere it could be a problem here what are\nthe odds though and so what they found\nis that 76 of men are what they call\nrecreational pornography users\nso what that means is they watch\npornography they tend to enjoy\npornography it doesn't seem to be\nassociated with really many negative\nconsequences at all there's no erectile\ndysfunction there are really no\nrelationship problems or things like\nthat generally speaking for 76 percent\nof people it's fine\nso for 13 of people they are what they\ncall highly distressed but\nnon-compulsive pornography or\nmasturbation users so these are people\nwho may not have a pornography addiction\nper se so there isn't compulsive use\nbut there's like negative stuff going on\nin their lives potentially associated\nwith the pornography so they're not\naddicted to porn but they may have\nrelationship problems they may have a\nlot of like avoidance in life they may\nhave some amount of like delayed\nejaculation or things like that and\nabout 11 percent of people are poor\ncompulsive pornography users and so\nthat's kind of shocking right so like I\nthink that's a pretty high number so\nwhat we're sort of looking at is that 11\nof people may have been closer to like\naddicted to pornography which is a\nshockingly high number so just to give\nyou all it's 11.8 just to give you all\nsome context so alcohol addiction is\nprobably is generally speaking\nconsidered on the more prevalent side\nright so we have the most alcoholics and\nalcohol addiction is around six percent\nso this is also where what we're seeing\nis an alarming rate of technology\nrelated addictions so video game\naddiction is probably above 10 now in\nsome countries some studies show rates\nof 20 to 26 percent\nright so one out of four people could be\naddicted to like video games\num and so 11 of compulsive pornography\n11.8 almost 12 is incredibly High\nso when it kind of comes down to it\nif you were to ask the question\nstatistically is my masturbation in\npornography use a problem I'd say\nthere's a 75 chance that you're fine but\nthere's also a 25 chance that it is a\nproblem and if it is a problem for you I\nstrongly encourage you all to get help\nget support you know go get evaluated by\na professional\num and see if you kind of fall into that\ncategory because the good news is that\nthere's like stuff you can do about all\nof this right we've talked about some of\nthe stuff on stream so we're not going\nto go into it right here but there are\nways to retrain your physiology there\nare ways to kind of like rewire your\ndopaminergic circuits when it comes to\nthe consumption of pornography I think\nthe abstinence of particular kinds of\npornography can also be very very\nhelpful so if you're into some of like\nthe really hardcore stuff and like\nthat's just what triggers your brain\nright because that's what your brain\nneeds it develops a tolerance to a\nparticular stimulus\nand in order to like get equally excited\nyou need a higher dose of something so\nthis is how people overdose on drugs\nbecause it used to be that taking like\nyou know\na third of a gram of heroin was enough\nand then you need half a gram and then\nyou take a gram and then you take two\ngrams and then you take three grams\nbecause you need more and more of the\nstuff to get high and so we're seeing\nthe same thing with pornography so sort\nof like scaling back on some of that\nstuff can also be effective\nso at the end of the day is pornography\nor masturbation a good thing or a bad\nthing I'd say like it depends\nand chances are that the odds are in\nfavor of it not being that big of a deal\nand is probably like a healthy thing to\ndo for most people but what we are\nseeing is both an increase I would\nsuspect in pornography usage problematic\npornography usage 11.8 percent of\ncompulsive usage is very high 13 of\npeople getting some kind of negative\nconsequence is also High\nand that number seems to be growing as\ntechnology improves and is like\npornography producers are figuring out\nhow to like get you in more\nand the more we sort of go down that\nrabbit hole the harder it becomes for us\nto sort of engage in healthy\nrelationships\nto someone's asking every time I watch\nporn I feel emotionally numb disoriented\ntired and hopeless for a few hours\nwhich drives me more to it is this okay\nI don't know if y'all have seen our\nstreams with the pornography addicts but\nI think that a lot of the pornography\naddiction just like other addictions\nis used as a form of almost\nself-medication\nright so like what we find is that\npeople who will consume more pornography\nand masturbate more they almost use it\nas like an emotional relief\nbecause it does kind of numb you out\nwhat was the sample size of which study\nI've cited like 15 studies today if you\nguys want this is a okay review\num it's not the best review but\nthere there's a review that sort of goes\nthrough it historically I think some of\nthe conclusions in the review are a\nlittle bit not ideal and furthermore\nsome of the papers that they cite I\nthink draw some inappropriate\nconclusions\num but I think it's like a good kind of\nnarrative review\nyeah so do you think act would be a good\nbehavioral therapy for porn addiction\nabsolutely so act as a is a strong\nevidence-based treatment acceptance and\ncommitment therapy is strong\nevidence-based treatment especially for\naddictions\num so you can find the study with 820\nmen in it's one of the references for\nthe review that I linked\n860 whatever\ncan you teach a non-kundalini meditation\nfor porn addiction I'd have to think\nabout that\num\nyeah so there's a question what do you\nthink about watching it since a young\nage so this is kind of interesting so\nmen tend to have their first exposure to\npornography use around 13. uh women tend\nto have it around 16 so we know that\nwomen start consuming pornography on\naverage later than men do we also find\nso I highly highly recommend y'all check\nout the porn addiction interview on our\nYouTube channel\nbut what we tend to find is that the\nearlier the exposure to pornography the\nless the more likely you are to have\nproblems so for some of the the people\non that porn addiction stream for\nexample they started watching\npornography or were exposed to\npornography at like nine\nand so I think there's something to be\nsaid of early exposure creating more\nlikely uh a greater likelihood of\nforming an addiction which is not just\ntrue of pornography so we know that the\nearlier you start using a substance the\nmore likely you are to get addicted to\nit so if you start drinking at 13 or\nstart using marijuana at 13 you're more\nlikely to get addicted to marijuana or\nalcohol than if you start using it at\nlike 19."
