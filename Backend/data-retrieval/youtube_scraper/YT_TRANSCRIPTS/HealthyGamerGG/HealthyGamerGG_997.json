    "transcript": "so a lot of people who are struck stuck\nwith a lack of motivation one of the key\nthings that you need to do is just\nfirst define what going forward in life\nis right so what does that actually mean\nlike what are the tasks that you need to\naccomplish to quote unquote move forward\nbecause a lot of the reason that we stay\nstuck in life is because we set\nourselves up with a goal that's\nimpossible to achieve okay\nso yesterday\nyou know at 12 o'clock when we were\nconcerned that\nour guests today may not be able to make\nit we sent out a panic\ntweet\nand thankfully the internet responded so\nthank you internet otherwise we would\njust be i don't even know what we would\nbe doing today maybe playing some dota\nokay\nso let's start from the top this is like\nso good right so i lack any motivation\ngoing forward in life what can i do and\nthis is gonna be like a common theme\nthat we see here so let's just\nsee if there's is there more no\nwow is this the only one i could have\nsworn there was a ton of questions about\nmotivation\nokay\nwhat can i do\nso\num and i saw that there was a reply here\nwhere someone was talking about you know\ndon't rely on motivation\nbuild habits instead\nand that's that's a good thought\num\nhabit development i think is a very very\ngood way to get productive\nthe problem with developing habits is\nthat they require some amount of like\neffort to start right so this is like a\nreally really excellent point that you\nshould rely on habits instead of\nmotivation for productivity but the\nproblem with habits is that in order to\nform a habit you have to do something\nfor somewhere between two weeks and six\nmonths and if you look at research on\nhabit formation that's actually how long\nit can take so like\nthe earliest habits tend to form in a\nfew weeks and some some studies on habit\nformation show that it actually takes\nlike six months\nso the challenge here is that sure if we\ncan get to the point of habit that\noutweighs motivation but if you lack any\nfor uh motivation going forward in life\nlike what can you do\nand so i think this is where a lot of\ntimes\nyou know when we sort of lack any\nmotivation\nthere's this concept of going forward in\nmy life which i think you really have to\ndeconstruct so like when people say like\ni lack any motivation to go forward in\nmy life but i want you all to think us\nfor a second about the frontal lobes so\nour frontal lobes are the part of our\nbrain that plan and execute tasks so if\ni say like okay like i have to talk\nabout crypto today then my frontal lobes\nare like okay so let's think a little\nbit about okay what's the sequence when\nare we going to talk about crypto what\nare we going to say about crypto and\nthere's certain like there's certain\noperationalizing so breaking a task into\nits constituent pieces\nand then once we break that task into\nits constituent pieces we can sort of\nmove forward with it\nthe problem is that going forward in my\nlife is not a task that your\nbrain can accomplish\nright so it's like how do you how do you\nmeasure going forward in life how does\nyour brain know that you have moved\nforward in life\nand this is the important thing about\nthe brain is that the brain is a very\nvery efficient organ and it's not going\nto\nwaste energy okay so if you think about\nlike\nwhat does your brain get motivated to do\nit gets motivated to do things that it\nknows are possible\nokay so this is really really important\nto understand so if we think a little\nbit about you know if you're confident\nin yourself and and you believe that you\nbring value to the world it's easier to\nget motivated to like find a job or\nchange your job or things like that\nbecause our our brain sort of has this\nlike\nthere's this part of our brain that\nessentially determines the chances of\nsuccess before we engage in a behavior\nso this is why i don't know about y'all\nbut i haven't tried out for the olympic\nswimming team\neven though i think it would be kind of\ncool\ni don't know if you all have tried out\nfor the olympic swimming team but\nprobably the reason that you don't feel\nvery motivated to try out for the\nolympic swimming team is because you\ndon't your brain is like sort of like\ndon't bother it's not worth your time\nso one of the key things to understand\nabout motivation is we can't be\nmotivated towards things unless\nwe have a sense that we can accomplish\nthem and so the first thing that you\nreally need to do is like\nreframe this\nso what does it mean to go forward in\nyour life like what does that even mean\nhow do you know so if you wake up today\nand your brain is like you're like okay\nlike i need to go move forward in my\nlife and then your frontal lobes are\nlike what am i supposed to do with that\nlike what is that what does that mean\nlike how do i know if i move forward in\nmy life is it doing five push-ups today\nis it\ncleaning out my closet is it taking out\nthe trash is it applying for a job is it\nmake updating my my dating profiles\nonline like what does going forward in\nlife even mean\nand so what tends to happen is that a\nlot of times we have a sense\nthat we're stuck\nright we feel like we're behind we feel\nlike we're not moving anywhere but\nthat's an emotion or it's a it's like a\nglobal sort of like problem that we sort\nof feel and so if like if i'm stuck how\ndo i get unstuck well that's kind of\nweird because your brain doesn't know\nhow to operationalize and break apart a\nfeel like the\nfeeling right\nif that sort of makes sense so if i have\nthe emotion that i'm stuck in life and i\nsort of feel globally stuck and that\ncould be based on you know what i see on\nsocial media and like comparing myself\nto other people and all other kinds of\nlike ahamkar ego related things then my\nthen i sort of think naturally the\nantidote is to get unstuck but unstock\nis such a vague thing that like you\ncan't really your brain doesn't know how\nto execute on the task\nit's sort of like you know if you were\nto tell your brain\nyou know\nmake sure you plan for the alien\ninvasion\nand it's sort of like\nwhat how do you even do that right like\nwhat does that entail what are the\noutcomes what when is the invasion\nwell we don't know\nhow do you prepare for it i don't know\nand so like that that's where your brain\ncan't really capitalize it so a lot of\npeople who are struck stuck with a lack\nof motivation one of the key things that\nyou need to do is just\nfirst define what going forward in life\nis\nright so what does that actually mean\nlike what are the tasks that you need to\naccomplish to quote unquote move forward\nbecause a lot of the reason that we stay\nstuck in life is because we set\nourselves up with a goal that's\nimpossible to achieve like literally\nthink about this for a second\ngoing forward in my life\nwhat is the verb what is the action that\ni have to take to go forward in my life\nis it taking a step\nis it walking a mile is it moving in\nthis direction or that direction is it\nincreasing the amount of my in my bank\naccount is it stalking my fridge like\nit's not a thing you can't go forward in\nlife\nlike that's impossible so a lot of the\nreason that we lack motivation is\nbecause we set up goals for ourselves we\nset up you know\ndirections for ourselves which are\nimpossible to attain and then our brain\nhas trouble figuring out how i'm\nsupposed to do that\nright because you're like okay like i\ndon't and then what we that what we\ninterpret that as is lack of motivation\nso our brain is motivated to let's say\ngo to the bathroom when we you know when\nour bladder is full and why is it\nmotivated to do that it knows that it\ncan accomplish it right it knows where\nyou start it knows where you end it\nknows how to actually do it because the\nfirst thing that we've got to do if\nyou're lacking motivation is\ndefine what going forward in my life\nactually is the second thing that you\ncan do is understand why you need to go\nforward in life and i know that's kind\nof a weird question but\nwhere do you get the idea that you need\nto move forward and i'm not saying that\nyour life is necessarily perfect and so\nyou may say well duh\nlike clearly i need to move forward in\nlife but in what ways\nright like what makes you think you even\nneed to move forward well i'm living at\nhome with my parents okay so like\nso what well\nthat's not good\nokay so what's not good about it well\ni don't know like i'm not gonna be able\nto find a romantic partner if i'm living\nat home okay so it sounds like romantic\npartners are interesting to you\nlet's like think about that so you have\nto figure out where\nwhere it is that you feel stuck from\nbecause what you'll sort of discover is\nwhen you sort of notice why why you're\nstuck that's the process with which you\nbreak apart what going forward looks\nlike okay so like i'm interested in\nromantic partners i'm interested in\nfinancial independence\ni'm interested in everything getting in\nshape okay then let's like let's try to\nprioritize those things okay what do you\nwant to start with today what can you\naccomplish today well i can like you\nknow i can update my resume okay\nfantastic\nso by exploring why you feel stuck\nyou will naturally sort of start to\nfigure out what are the dimensions of\nyour life that you need to change and\nthen what you do is you tunnel down and\nyou focus on just one because the third\nthing which is really important is\nthere's a pitfall here which is as you\ndig into why you feel stuck\nyour brain is going to logically give\nyou lots of answers so if i ask anyone\nwhy do you feel stuck\ntheir brain will produce lots of answers\nbut that's an intellectual answer that\nis born from a feeling and i don't know\nif this is getting a little bit too\ncomplicated but oftentimes if i feel a\nparticular way my mind will be able to\njustify it however i want to so if you\ntalk to someone who feels like they're\ngoing to be doomed to be alone forever\nthey'll come up with a thousand\njustifications but interestingly enough\nif you actually do like psychotherapy\nwith these people or work with these\npeople what you'll discover is that the\nfeeling of alone came first there's\nusually some kind of traumatic event\nwhere they like you know they they had a\nbirthday party when they were eight\nyears old and they prepped everything\nfor it and then like no one showed up\nand that's where the feeling of being\nalone was born from and once that\nfeeling is born then your mind creates a\ncognitive bias you start to justify it\nright you start to look at all of these\nreasons why you believe this thing but\nthe truth is that that justification\ncomes after the fact\nso a simple way to understand this is if\nyou have if you're politically oriented\nin one particular way it's going to be\nvery easy for you to see the mental\ngymnastics of people who are oriented\nthe opposite way right we all go through\nthese mental gymnastics and how does\nthat work why does our mind do that\nthat's because the feeling actually\ncomes first the emotion comes first the\nemotion isn't born of logic right\nbut anytime you ask yourself why do i\nfeel this way the mind will generate a\nthousand different answers but those\nanswers come from the emotion they don't\nresult in the emotion\nso you have to be super careful when you\nask yourself why am i stuck\nif your mind comes up with a laundry\nlist of different things some of those\ncan be useful for operationalizing\nbut don't fall into the trap of just\nbecause\ni'm operationalizing\ndoesn't mean that the feeling is\nactually justified or because of all of\nthese things chances are if if you feel\nstuck that feeling has an emotional root\nand some kind of like experience so if\nyou're lacking motivation\nfirst thing to do is recognize that\ngoing forward in my life is not an\naction you can take like literally you\ncannot go forward in your life like\nthat's like physically impossible it's\nnot something you can do so you have to\nbetter define what your goals are\nbecause then your brain your frontal\nlobes can be like okay like now i\nunderstand okay put my book books on the\nbookshelf that's something that my brain\ncan actually like understand and develop\nsome degree of motivation towards the\nsecond thing to do is dig into the roots\nof why you feel stuck or why you feel\nlike you need to go forward in your life\nand once you dig into the roots of that\nand sort of emotionally process that\nunderstand that some you'll recognize\nthat that emotion is holding back your\nmotivation and if you can get to the\nbottom of that emotion your motivation\nwill naturally start to flourish\nthe third thing to keep in mind is\nthere's a particular pitfall here which\nis as you go down that path\nbe super careful for all of the\njustifications that your mind uses\nlike oh i'm stuck because a b c and d\nwhereas chances are those things are not\nthe cause of you being stuck those\nthings are the result of you feeling\nstuck plus the cognitive bias or\ncognitive filter that you apply from\nbeing stuck\nso hopefully that makes sense and if you\ngo through that process hopefully you\ncan start to develop some kind of\nmotivation and then\nas you start to develop some kind of\nmotivation lean into habit\nthoughts on the general impact\nokay\nquestions\nliterally picking a needle from a\nhaystack where the problem\nfound supposed to locate it yeah so\nthat's what it can feel like that's\nexactly so it's a great point so uh\nremix gen is saying a remix jen is\nsaying it's like trying to find a needle\nin a haystack in terms of the source of\nmy my\nyou know why i feel stuck and that's\nexactly what it feels like because your\nmind will generate a thousand reasons\nfor feeling a particular way but even if\nyou think about it we don't feel a\nparticular way because of a thousand\nthings right and just think about your\nlife for a second if you feel a\nparticular way chances are it's not like\nan amalgamation of a thousand\nexperiences chances are it's one\nexperience\nor a couple of experiences that you\nrepeat over and over and over again and\nso that's exactly right that's why what\nyou've got to do is like kind of go to\nthe source of the emotion right so\nthere's a interesting tip there which is\nask yourself how long you've been\nfeeling this way\nand\nwhen was the last time you didn't feel\nthis way and then what you want to look\nfor is a change\nso what changed so like if i started i\nfelt pretty good back when i was 16 or\n17 and now i'm 22. what changed between\nlike 16 17 and 18 or what changed\nbetween 16 and 17 and 18 and 19.\nand so that's how you could sort of find\nwhere that process is this we go into\nthis in a bunch of detail in dr k's\nguide if you look at the vedic\npsychology portion because this is like\na skill that you can learn\num in terms of finding the root of your\nkind of like cognitive biases\nokay\num so\nwe've got\nvitaboy who's saying if my issue is when\ni create goals i feel like they aren't\ngenuine like writing on paper what i\nwant to accomplish really hard to\nbelieve myself 100\nright so that's because your goals are\nbeing created from your intellect as\nopposed to\nlike they're like things that you should\ndo\nright so this is a challenge where if we\nlook at like what's the problem with\nlike how we generate goals\nso when i generate goals like let's just\nthink for a second about where do those\ngoals come from\ni sit down for a second like i grab a\npiece of paper and i start listing all\nthe things i should do\nwell just think about this for a second\nhow important is a should\nfor\ngenerating motivation how motivated are\nyou to do the things that you should do\nby nature the fact that it's something\nyou should do you're not intrinsically\nmotivated at all so if you want to\ngenerate goals what i'd recommend is\ninstead of asking writing down all the\nstuff you should be doing\ninstead ask yourself what do you care\nabout what do you actually value in this\nlife not what you should do what do you\ncare to do and this is where you've got\nto be kind of careful because you may\nfall into a pitfall well what i care to\ndo is play video games all day i don't\nthink so i don't think you wake up today\nand you you say to yourself\nwell for the next five years i'd love\nnothing more than to sit in my room and\nplay video games for 16 hours a day like\ni don't think that you actually care\nabout that i think that's what we do as\na default when we're looking at a list\nof all the stuff we should be doing it\nfeels overwhelming and we don't know\nwhat to do so we might as well play a\nvideo game\nthat's how you end up playing video\ngames for 16 hours a day for five years\nit's not because you wake up and you're\nlike man i really love this or if you do\nyou usually end up as a pro pro gamer\nlike you know an esports athlete like\nthat happens and usually that's where\nthose people end up so i'd be i'd start\nby really digging into like what you\ncare about\nand this is where like so part of what\nwe try to help our uh what we teach our\ncoaches is if you're trying to work with\nsomeone who who struggles with\nmotivation what you need to do is move\nfrom the should to the care\nlike what do you care about what do you\nvalue because that's what creates\nmotivation\nso someone's asking how do i keep\nconstantly motivated so this is\nimportant to understand about motivation\nyou don't want to keep constantly\nmotivated you have to understand that\nmotivation is going to fluctuate\ni don't know that you can say constantly\nmotivated but what you can do is create\na life in which two things happen\none is that you capitalize on motivation\nin a way that is not lost\nwhen it happens so you kind of strike\nwhile the iron is hot okay\nso that's where like you acknowledge\nthat motivation isn't going to be there\nall the time you're a human human beings\nfluctuate right they're not robots\nthey're not machines\nso the question is when you are\nmotivated how do you capitalize on it in\na way that you don't lose it so that's\nwhere\nyou know for example like if i'm writing\na book that's somewhat easy because i\ncan you know keep it and every time i\nfeel inspired i sit down to write there\nare other things that are a little bit\nharder like i feel motivated to study\ntoday i don't feel motivated to study\ntomorrow\nso like if you don't feel motivated\noften enough if you're studying like\nthat can be a real problem which is why\nwe come to number two\nso if if motivation if we acknowledge\nfor a moment that motivation is\nfluctuant\nthen the question becomes what dictates\nhow motivated you are\nand this is where people lose out i\nthink a lot on understanding motivation\nis that motivation is triggered by all\nkinds of different things and the more\nthat you shape your life\nto have\npro-motivational external sources\nthe better off you'll be\nso this is where like i don't feel like\nstudying today but if i get together\nwith five of my friends monday wednesday\nand thursday in the library\nfor three hours and i have a standing\nappointment even if i don't feel like\nstudying i will do some work\nso this is where i think a lot of people\nwho are struggling with motivation\nyou've got to do two things one is\ncapitalize when the motivation is there\nand second is figure out like how to\nblow\num you know\nincrease the oxygen and the embers to\nrekindle that flame\nso that's really what i would recommend\nso just capitalize on it in a way that's\nkind of like sustainable not sustainable\nbut preservable is a better term\nso a lot of times we'll get motivated\nbut the amount of work that we'll do\nis not conducive to being picked up\nlater\nso we'll like do something half finished\nwhereas like you know if you can\ncomplete a segment and then have the\nnext part ready for yourself it can\nreally help so you can't stay constantly\nmotivated you don't need to just\ncapitalize on it when it's there and\nthen figure out how to stoke it is the\nword i was looking for i think\nright how to evoke it and then set up\nthose kinds of exposures for yourself\nand then your motivation will go a lot\nlonger you'll get a lot more done\nyou"
