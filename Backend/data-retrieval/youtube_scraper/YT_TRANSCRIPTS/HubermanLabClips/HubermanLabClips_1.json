    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK,\nso I'm standing here\nwith Dr. Stuart\nMcGill, who's an expert\nin the back, back strengthening,\nand relief of back pain,\nand he's going to tell us\nabout the structure of the back\nin terms of where it\nderives its stability from,\nwhere pain can arise, and\nvarious routes by which\nto relieve that pain.\nSo why don't you explain to\nus what you're holding here?\nIt looks like an\nanatomical model\nof a piece of the spine,\nspinal cord, and pelvis.\nSTUART MCGILL: That's\njust about it, Professor.\nIf I was to align this on\nyourself, that's where it sits.\nSo there's your pelvic ring.\nThere's joints called\nthe sacroiliac joints\nfrom behind, where when a person\ndoes a split lunge, for example,\none side mutates forward,\nthe other side mutates back.\nAnd you can see the\nmicro movements that\noccur in the sacroiliac\nregion, which may be healthy,\nor they may cause pain.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So, those\nare fairly small movements.\nSo they look like they're\non the order of millimeters.\nIs that right?\nSTUART MCGILL: About\na half a millimeter.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK,\nso a tiny movement.\nSTUART MCGILL: They're micro\nmovements that, as I said,\ncould cause symptoms or\nthey indicate good health.\nThis creates a platform\nfor the lumbar spine.\nSo, as it's orientated this way,\nif you were to pick something\nup, the force is supported\ndown this middle of your body\nthrough the spine.\nSo it needs a platform\nto be supported by.\nSo you can imagine--\nI'll just place it on me-- if I\nwas going to stand on one leg.\nThe force is driven down\nthe center of my torso,\nbut then it has to shear\nacross to the support leg.\nThe tendency of the spine\nis to bend like that.\nSo now you see the importance of\nthe lateral muscles on this side\nto hold the pelvic platform\nup, and then the hip\nmuscles on this side--\ndo you see my hip is trying to\ncollapse because of gravity?\nSo there's a lot of moving\nparts in how all of this works.\nSo, as far as the\nspine goes itself,\nthe hips are ball\nand socket joints,\nbut the joints of the\nspine are actually\nwhat we would call an\nadaptable biologic fabric.\nSo just as my shirt\nhas fibers, these\nhave fibers of collagen,\nlayer upon layer,\nwhich allow movement to occur.\nBut they also apply\nor provide stiffness\nso that the spine is inherently\nstable for very small loads\nbecause it has disks.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So, we have\nthe vertebral segments and then\nthe disks in between them.\nAnd then what people see\nhere are the nerve roots\nemanating from the spinal cord.\nSTUART MCGILL: Right.\nThe spinal cord starts\nin the base of your skull\nand goes down the middle\nof the spine through\nwhat's called the magnum\nforamen, the big hole\ndown the middle.\nAnd at each level\nwhere there's a disk,\nthere's a pair of\nnerve roots that\ncome out laterally to serve\ndifferent parts of your body.\nSo, if this nerve\nwas compromised here,\nthat's the fourth root\non the left-hand side,\nthis goes around behind your\nhip joint, down your hamstring,\ndown your calf, and serves\nthe small four toes.\nSo if you had irritation by\nbending your spine a certain way\nand said, well, my little\ntoes just went numb,\nwe would know with\nsome precision\nthat that's the culprit\nwith that precision,\nthat nerve right there.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What are some\nof the sources of impingement\non that nerve?\nI could imagine the disk\nbulging at this location\nis one potential source.\nI could imagine\na shearing motion\nthat would put it\nin contact with some\nof the bony elements in here.\nWhat are some other sources\nof impingement in the nerve?\nSTUART MCGILL:\nExactly, those two.\nLet me demonstrate.\nAnd we're just\ngoing to a do-si-do\nthere with the two models.\nSo, this is a more\ndetailed anatomical model\nof just one segment.\nYou'll notice that the spinal\ncord traverses up and down,\nso as you look down, it\nmigrates the cord cranially.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So, it's\npulling the spinal cord up.\nAnd because it actually laces\nthrough these bony elements,\nthe spinal cord is\nliterally sliding up.\nSTUART MCGILL: It is.\nAnd if you were to kick\nforward with one leg\nthrough the hip with a straight\nknee, it would do the opposite;\nit would pull the cord that way.\nBut now look at the migration\nand the mechanics of the nerve\nroots.\nThis is sliding up and\ndown about 2 centimeters,\nor for my American\ncolleagues, just over, well,\ngetting close to an inch.\nSo it's quite a--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nquite a distance.\nSTUART MCGILL: It is.\nIt's quite a distance,\nquite a translation.\nYou can imagine\nnow, if something\nwas rubbing that nerve\nroot, it would irritate it\nwith the motion.\nSo your question was,\nwhat are the candidates?\nWell, when a person is younger,\nand if they get a disk bulge--\nwe're just going to\nshow a disk bulge here--\ninside the disk is a\nnucleus, which is gel.\nIt's a very thick gel.\nAnd when you squeeze the spine,\nor I bend and pick up an object,\nwe put compressive\nload onto the disk.\nAnd if we're stacked\nnice and tall,\nyou'll see the disk seize\nthe compression, as you\ncan imagine it\nwould, in a very sort\nof a shock-absorbing manner.\nBut now, I'm going to bend\nthe spine forward and squeeze.\nDo you see?\nThere was a delamination\nor a little bit\nof a damage and\ndelamination of the fibers\nthat we described earlier.\nThey separate as the\nperson bends forward,\nand then the squeezing pressure\ncreates a hydraulic effort\nthrough the delamination.\nAnd you see the disk\nbulge just starting\nto occur with the nuclear gel.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh yeah,\nit's squeezing out there.\nSTUART MCGILL: And then as the\nperson keeps moving in excess--\nnow, if you just\nmove-- we did a study\non belly dancers, who\nhave tremendous gyrations\nin their spine.\nThat didn't create delaminating\nstresses because there\nwas no large compressive load.\nSo motion for the\nspine without load\nis not particularly a bad thing.\nBut when you add\ncompressive load,\nnow you've pressurized\nthe nucleus,\nand it's pushing from\nbehind those fibers.\nSo now, you're bulging\nthem out a little bit.\nNow, you can start to\nsee how they'll separate.\nAnd if my thumb is the\ngel, it's seeking the crack\nto come through.\nAnd then that creates\nthe disk bulge,\nwhich is a\ncombination of motion,\nusually bending forward\nwith compression.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\non a previous episode\nthat I did about\nback strengthening,\nI mistakenly said that\nthe spinal cord threads\nthrough a compartment\nin the disk.\nIt does not.\nWe corrected that.\nI should say in the show note\ncaptions the spinal cord is\nposterior to the disk, correct?\nSTUART MCGILL: Correct\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And does\nnot course through it,\nbut is just adjacent to it.\nAnd the disk is, however,\nin a position to impinge\non these nerve roots if it gets\nextruded, and, in some cases,\nto push the nerve root against\nsome of the bony elements,\ncausing what we call pain.\nBut the pain doesn't necessarily\noccur at the level of the root.\nIt can occur at the\nlevel of innervation\nor further down\nthe neural pathway.\nSTUART MCGILL: The pain can go\nwherever the nerve root goes.\nExactly correct.\nSo now if we start to move the\nnerve, the central spinal cord,\nor at this level, it's\ncalled the cauda equina;\nit separates into\nseparate roots.\nBut nonetheless, do you\nsee how that root now\nmoves as a function of your hip\nmotion and your neck motion?\nSo now, you're\nfrictioning the nerve\npast the mechanical offense.\nSo it creates varying\ntypes of local pain\nand radiating pain as well.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So,\nif there is a disk\nbulge and it's impinging or\nsomehow otherwise causing pain\nby compressing one\nof these roots,\nirritating one of those\nroots, as it were,\nwhat can be done to return\nsome of that bulge back\ninto its proper location?\nSTUART MCGILL: Avoid\nbending the spine forward,\nwhich is the primary\ndriver of causing\nthat disk bulge to grow--\nnow, not of every disk bulge;\nit tends to work better\nin younger people.\nSo, I'm just going to slide\nmy hands down my thighs.\nBut notice I'm\nflexing at the hip.\nI'm not flexing\nthrough the spine.\nIf you can flex at the hip--\nand here might be a therapy.\nIf I just grab my\nknees hard, and then I\nshape the curvature of my\nspine, then I push my toes down,\nand I become a-- leaning\nforward over my ankles.\nAnd now I anti-shrug.\nDo you see what I did, Andrew?\nI carry more weight.\nI'm showing you my triceps.\nIf I organize that\nright, that can actually\nbe a disk-bulge-reducing\nprocedure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting,\nbecause when I had this L4 disk\nbulge, the suggestion to me was\nto do Cobra Pose, or something\nsimilar, to lie\ndown on the floor,\npoint my toes out so toes\nand tops of feet and legs\nare in contact with the\nground, and then to push up,\nand essentially\nto arch the spine,\nand then to repeat that 10 or\nso cobra push ups, as it were,\nand then to hold the final one\nfor maybe 30 to 60 seconds,\nand then to get up and\nreturn about my day,\nand to do that several times.\nAnd it worked fabulously well.\nSTUART MCGILL: That\nworks fabulously\nwell for certain\ntypes of disk bulges.\nWe did experiments on this.\nAnd if the disk's\noriginal height,\nor 70% of that height\nor more, is remaining,\nthat works very well.\nIf you flatten the disk\nso it's about 60% or less\nof it's retaining\nheight, that won't work.\nIn fact, that will\nprobably cause more pain.\nSo it's called the\nMcKenzie Prone Press Up\nor the Cobra Pose\ncan be very effective\nwith the rider of how much\ndisk height is remaining.\nBut another concern occurs.\nSome people think,\nwell, that was\nan effective therapy for that\ndisk bulge for two weeks.\nI'm going to do it every\nday for the next year.\nNow, we run into a problem.\nThe disk is now a\nlittle bit flatter.\nThese facet joints on the back\nare two articulating joints.\nThere's the motion\nthat they're undergoing\nduring the floppy push\nup, as it's called.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThe Cobra Push Up.\nSTUART MCGILL:\nThe Cobra Push Up.\nBecause the disk\nhas now lost height,\nyou've now biomechanically\ntransferred much higher load\nto those facet joints.\nAnd they become irritated.\nSo before, bending\nforward under load\ncaused your pain and\nthe disk bulge to grow.\nBut now bending back\ncauses pain from the facet\njoints, which is another\ndistinctive pain.\nWe can arch back, drop\none shoulder back.\nAnd oh, yeah.\nYou can feel that\nlocal ache there.\nSo those are a couple of\nissues to be aware of.\nWe did another experiment where\nwe mimicked the floppy push up\nversus simply holding\nit isometrically.\nAnd the isometric pose doesn't\ncause the movement irritation\nof the facet joints.\nIn terms of returning the disk\nbulge, it was just as effective.\nBut following the\nsame guideline,\nagain, 70% of the\noriginal disk height\nmust be remaining for\nthe isometric to work.\nSo, there's some\nguidelines for you\nto make that exercise\neven more effective.\nBut you asked what else could\nimpinge on a nerve root.\nOver time, as the\ndisk becomes damaged,\nYou now get more motion.\nAnd this is what we\ncall an unstable joint.\nThat causes more load\non the facet joint.\nSo let's do our\ndo-si-do one more time.\nAnd this model has been\nprepared that this disk,\nthe fourth lumbar 4, is damaged.\nL5 is normal.\nL3 is normal.\nThis is the joint that\nhas lost stiffness.\nNow, people hear\nthe word stiffness,\nand they think\nthat's a bad thing.\nBut a joint has to have a\ncertain amount of stiffness\nto provide support and\ndefine the range of motion.\nSo remember, this is\nthe damaged joint.\nI'm just going to apply\na general torque above.\nAnd do you see how the majority,\nthe overwhelming majority\nof the motion is occurring\nat the damaged joint,\nnot at the one above and\nnot at the one below.\nNow, let's turn around and\nlook at the facet joints.\nThey've been painted red.\nThose are the joints that are\nworking because of the disk\ndamage.\nSo when we turn a little\nbit, we get a little bit\nof shearing motion.\nIf we turn a lot that\njoint, that facet joint\non the compressive\nside is overloaded.\nAnd that causes the whole\nupper vertebra to slide across.\nOver time, that's going to\nencourage arthritic bone growth,\njust at that level.\nSo another mechanism for the\nimpingement on that nerve root\nis bone growth around the\nfacet joint, which will\nmake the hole even smaller.\nSo there's another\nsource of pain.\nThe moral of the story is keep\nyour disks as healthy as you\ncan, and you'll have a better--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Life.\nSTUART MCGILL: Well, that's--\nOK.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nSo, are there ever\ncases where one\nwould want to attempt\nto return the disk\nto its proper compartment,\nin other words,\nto reverse or reduce the\nbulging of a disk, where\nthe proper movement would be\nthe opposite of a Cobra Push Up,\nwhere it would actually\ninvolve abdominal work\nin order to try and\nwork back in the disk\nfrom the other\ndirection, so to speak?\nSTUART MCGILL: Yeah.\nIt depends, is the answer.\nThere's a real nuance\nto all of this.\nSo that's why we spend so\nmuch time on the assessment\nto define the precise\nnature of the disk bulge.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd I should just\nmention that in the episode\nthat we recorded with you, which\nwe provide a link to in\nthe show note captions,\nyou described some of\nthe assessment questions,\nself-assessment questions.\nWe talked about Back\nMechanic, your book,\nwhich fabulously describes some\nways to self-assess and remedy,\nas well as a link to\nsome of the clinicians\nthat you've trained in the\nprecise methods based on much\nof the work that you and\nothers have done to address\nthese problems specifically.\nI said long-winded, because as\nDr. Stuart McGill has pointed\nout many times, the sources of\nback pain are many and varied.\nAnd the relief for back pain\nis both highly individual\nand involves varied\ntechniques depending\non the nature of the injury\nor the nature of the pain.\nAnd there are a number\nof other factors--\npsychosocial, emotional, et\ncetera, that are also important.\nAnd Dr. Stuart\nMcGill describes all\nof those in the episode linked\nin the show note caption.\nSTUART MCGILL: Yeah,\nthere's a time for surgery\nand a very specific\ntype of surgery.\nThere's a time for a very\nspecific type of exercise,\nbe it mobility,\nstability, or whatever.\nThere's a time for\npretty much everything.\nThe key is to match it to the--\nI don't want to say injury,\nbut it could be an injury.\nIt could be a\nsensitivity, et cetera.\nBut anyway, going\nback to this idea\nof that is now called a clinical\ninstability, that you can see\nif you could arrest that\njoint and restore its motion,\nso when you twist, the whole\nunit doesn't see the shearing\njoints, you do that through\nabdominal contraction.\nSo if I cued you and said,\nAndrew, push my fingers out.\nYes.\nDon't push your belly\nforward, if you can.\nTry and flare your oblique\nmuscles out laterally.\nThat's the pattern.\nAnd that will then arrest\nthat micro-movement.\nAnd some people will say\nit takes their pain away.\nIs there ever a time\nto flex forward,\nto deal with the disk bulge?\nAnd the answer is, yes.\nThe type of disk bulge\nthat when you bend forward\nand the disk bulge is\non the back of the disk\nis typical of a weight\ntraining kind of injury.\nIf you had someone with\na very flexible spine,\nthey don't lift weights,\nbut they do lots of yoga--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Backbends.\nSTUART MCGILL: They've adapted\ntheir spine for mobility, not\nfor load bearing.\nSo the collagen and the ground\nmatrix between the fibers\nhave become very soft.\nSo, whereas someone who\nwas strength training, when\nthey squeeze and bend\nforward, the disk bulge\ncomes out posteriorly, someone\nwith very soft constituency\nto the disk, it\nbulges on the front.\nSo it's a different\ntype of bulge.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nSTUART MCGILL: So,\nit depends on how\nyou've adapted your spine as to\nwhether flexion will help you\nor extension.\nSo, again, knowing\nwith some precision\nthe mechanism of\nthe pain or disorder\nallows you to match\nthe intervention.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic.\nWell, this has been a\nwonderful description\nof spinal and pelvic\nanatomy disks,\nand a very dynamic structure,\nand yet a very stable structure\nin its best configuration.\nSTUART MCGILL: Right.\nWhat amazes my students is\nwhen I hand them a spine,\nand I get them to, with\nall their strength,\ntry and bend it and break it.\nThey can't.\nSo it's incredibly robust.\nBut the things that we do to\nourselves, creating long levers\nand doing what we do creates\ntremendous internal stress\nconcentrations beyond\nwhat you could ever\napply with your hands.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: All the more\nreason to do the McGill Big\n3 on a regular basis.\nThat was also described\nand demonstrated\nin some other videos that\nwe provide in the show note\ncaptions.\nAnd of course, please\nbe sure to check out\nthe full-length interview with\nDr. Stuart McGill, in which he\ndescribes in beautiful\nand immensely clear detail\nthe structure and function\nof the spine and back, how\nto strengthen your back,\nhow to get rid of back pain,\nand how to stave off back\npain, not just after an injury\nbut your entire life.\nAnd by the way, at this\nmoment, he is 67 years old.\nHe's in awesome shape\nand an inspiration to me.\nAnd anyone watching I'm\nsure is equally impressed.\nHe puts in the work\non a regular basis.\nAnd in that episode,\nhe also describes\nhis so-called biblical\nschedule, which\nis six days a week of fairly\nlimited in duration training\ngeared toward cardiovascular\nfitness, strength, and mobility.\nIt also includes a\nfull day of rest.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
