    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: I do have\na question about recovery,\nand it's one that I\nthink most people are\nfamiliar with themselves,\nwhich is soreness.\nWe think of it as\na muscle soreness,\nbut I was trained early on\nin my scientific career,\nto always question\nthe seemingly obvious.\nSo a couple of questions\nabout soreness.\nFirst of all, what does\nsoreness really reflect?\nIs it really muscle soreness?\nIt feels like it's\nin the muscles,\nbut what other organ systems\nand tissues and cell types\ndoes it involve?\nAnd then I'm\nparticularly interested\nin this concept\nor this experience\nthat many of us,\nincluding myself have had,\nwhich is delayed\nonset muscle soreness.\nWhy would it be that\nwhen we are less in shape\nor when we perform a movement\nthat is extremely novel to us,\nthe soreness seems to arrive\nafter a reasonable delay\nof maybe even a day?\nWe're fine the next day,\nbut then 48 hours later, we\nare exceedingly sore.\nAnd as we get more fit or more\nfamiliar with the movement,\nthe soreness seems\nto arrive earlier.\nSo I realize I just asked you\nabout three questions or more.\nFirst of all, what is muscle\nsoreness at a cellular level?\nWhich cells, which\norgan systems?\nAnd so forth.\nWhat does it mean\nif we are sore?\nIt's something I know we'll\nget into a little bit later.\nAnd then why the delayed\nonset muscle soreness?\nANDY GALPIN: It's\nactually one question.\nSo it's totally fine\nyou asked all three,\nbecause I'm going to actually\nanswer number three, which\nwill answer number two,\nwhich will actually\nanswer number one.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd love\nto tell you that I set it up\nthat way intentionally,\nbut I'm just\nhappy to hear that where I\nwas unable to be concise,\nyou are able to be concise.\nThank you.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, we are still\nlearning a lot about this area.\nIt's actually really difficult\nto perform these studies.\nAny time you ask a\nquestion about something\nlike pain or soreness,\nyou're immediately\ntalking about perception.\nAnd there is obviously a\nphysical component to that,\nand there's also perception.\nAnd so teasing those things out\nis extraordinarily challenging.\nThat said, there has been\na lot of work in this area.\nAnd in fact, probably you may\nhave a show already out on pain\nor maybe one's\ncoming down the road.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We did an\nepisode on pain a while ago,\nbut it's definitely time\nto revisit that literature.\nI also have some\namazing colleagues\nat Stanford who work on pain,\nboth from the cellular and\nmolecular side, but also\nfrom the psychological side.\nAbout how our understanding\nof pain, and what\nwe believe about pain shapes\nthe experience of pain and pain\nrelief.\nANDY GALPIN: Amazing, that\nstuff is incredibly important,\nand I'm glad we flagged that.\nAnd maybe we'll just\ncall that good for now,\nthen I could come back later\nfor another one of your shows.\nSo that being said, why does\nit happen 28 to 48 hours\nafter you exercised?\nWell, that actually\nshould give you some clues\ninto what's happening.\nSo the traditional dogma of\ndelayed onset muscle soreness,\nis what this is called, is that\nit is a result of \"micro-tears\"\nin the muscle.\nAnd so you can think, I\nchallenged the muscle.\nThere were some\nsmall tears in there,\nand I'm feeling the\nresults of that.\nWell, in fact, that certainly\ndoes happen and it can happen.\nThat is not what's explaining\nyour muscle soreness.\nAnd in fact, you can be\nquite sore from exercise,\nand have no measurable\namount of muscle damage.\nAnd so much like\nanything else when\nwe're in this idea of pain, it's\nnot a one to one explanation.\nThere are multiple\nfactors that are probably\ncausing your perception\nof pain, muscle damage\ncan be one of them.\nIt is not the only one.\nAnd it is probably\nin my opinion--\nthough this has yet to\nbe shown definitively,\n--probably not even the\nleading cause of it.\nAnd so what's\nactually happening?\nWell, the reason it's\ntaking you 24 to 48 hours,\nis you can actually\nfind various papers\nliterature reviews dating\nback in a number of years now,\nover a decade, that show\nthese wonderful curves\nof an inflammatory\nand immune response.\nAnd we don't need\nto necessarily go\nthrough the entire\nphysiology right now.\nBut effectively\nwhat's happening is,\nthose things have a little\nbit of a time delay.\nAnd so some of those\nsteps happen immediately,\nlike right when the\nexercise is there.\nAnd some of them are\ndelayed 6 to 24 to 48 hours.\nIf you know a little bit\nabout this physiology,\nit's you have a combination of\nneutrophils and macrophages,\nand a bunch of things happening.\nAnd this has a time sequence.\nSo what happens is, by the\ntime we get to this 28 to 48\nhour window, now the\nmuscle soreness kicks in.\nWhich wait a minute, if this\nwas a result of my muscles being\ntorn and that\nhappened immediately,\nwouldn't that pain\nstart immediately?\nWell, the answer is it would.\nAnd so that is your first\nclue that that's not\nresponsible for it.\nWhen we look at\nthat immune response\nand we see that is actually\npeak 24 to 48 hours later,\nand then that's the same\ntime the pain kicked in,\nthat's cluing you\ninto the problem.\nSo we have this immune response\nhappening and inflammation.\nThen all of a sudden, we start\ngetting fluid accumulation.\nAnd now there are what\nare called nociceptors,\nand well, obviously, you're\nvery familiar with these.\nAnd these are your\npain receptors.\nWhat's actually interesting\nis, we don't necessarily\nknow a lot of information\nabout how many\npain receptors are in muscle.\nThey're not really in the belly.\nIn fact, this is why I can\nperform my muscle biopsies\nand they don't really hurt.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You mean\nin the belly of the muscle.\nANDY GALPIN: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nANDY GALPIN: We do have\npressure sensors though.\nAnd so if you change the\nvolume of the tissue,\nyou will respond to\nthat very, very quickly.\nSo by enhancing swelling\nin the actual muscle,\nthat is immediately putting\npressure on those pressure\nreceptors, if you will.\nThat's the signal.\nSo what's probably\nhappening here--\nand I just hate to\ngive you another bone,\nbut a lot of delay on\nsome muscle soreness\nis probably just a\nneural feedback loop,\nrather than it is\nactual muscle damage.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nit makes a lot of sense.\nThere's a lot of interactions\nbetween the types of neurons\nthat control touch sensation,\nand pain sensation and itch\nsensation.\nIn fact, a lot of people\ncollapse itch and pain\ntogether.\nANDY GALPIN: Bingo.\nYeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's painful and it\nitches, is a familiar\nthing for people,\nmosquito bites and such.\nAnd of course, there's the\nclassic gait theory of pain.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah,\nthis is-- yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Which\npeople will be familiar with,\nand then I'll explain\nwhy I'm explaining this.\nWhich is if something\nhurts, you bonk your knee\nor you stub your toe, we\ntend to grab that body part\nand try and rub it.\nANDY GALPIN: Totally.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd that rubbing\nis not a coincidental thing.\nIt activates a set\nof touch sensors\nthat respond to\nbroad dull touch.\nAnd that actively inhibits\nthrough the release\nof an inhibitory\nneurotransmitter, the fibers\nthat control the pain signal.\nSo any time we rub-- like a\nCharley horse, our leg or we\nstub our toe and we wince, and\nthen we grab the toe and we\nlike squeezing it a little bit,\nthat's actually deactivating\nor partially inactivating\nthe pain mechanism.\nSo the idea that a swelling\nresponse would then\ntrigger a neural\nresponse, that then\nwould recruit the pain\nreceptor response.\nHere I'm using broad brush\nstrokes here to explain this,\nmakes very good sense\nto me now, and only\nnow that you've explained\nhow this process works.\nANDY GALPIN: I can actually\neven add more to that.\nSo if you remember how\nmuscles work, so we\nhave to have some sort of\nsignal from the nervous system,\nthat has to actually go in and\ntell the muscle to contract.\nWell, remember there\nare a few episodes ago,\nwe covered the physiology here,\nof what's called a motor unit.\nWell, what I didn't\nexplain to you,\nare called muscle spindles.\nAnd we have talked about\nproprioception in an episode\nbefore as well, but we never\ntied this picture together.\nSo let me walk you through\nthat really quickly,\nand that's going to tie\nthis loop into a nice bow.\nSo what happens\nis, this motor unit\nis coming in from what's\ncalled the alpha motor unit.\nAnd that's going to be\nintegrating your muscle fibers,\nand that's going to tell the\nmuscle fibers to contract.\nThose are typically spread\nout throughout all sides\nof the muscle.\nIn interior, exterior, all over.\nOn the outside though,\nthere is another type\nof muscle called\na muscle spindle.\nNow, these are\nnon-contractile, so they\ndon't have that\nactin and myosin,\nand they don't produce force.\nThey are responsive.\nThey are proprioceptive.\nSo what that means is,\nthey sense stretch.\nAnd this is why, for example, if\nyou were to stretch a hamstring\nor stretch any muscle\ngroup, it doesn't really\nmatter or muscle,\nits innate response\nis to fire back to\nclose that distance.\nAnd this is what\nkeeps you from say,\nif you're leaning\nto the right, you\ncan imagine-- the\nexample we give\nis, if you're\nstanding on one foot\nand you start\nswaying to the right.\nAll right, let's say you're\nstanding on your right foot--\nand this makes this\neasier for folks,\n--and you start\nswaying to the right,\nlike you're going to\nfall on your right ear\nor hit the ground.\nThe inside of your\nright calf muscle\nwill start being stretched.\nThe outside will start\nbeing compressed.\nSo the stretch on the inside\nof the right calf muscle\nwill sense that stretch, and\nit will respond by contracting.\nThat pulls you\nback to the middle\nand stops you from falling.\nThat's proprioception in\nmuscle spindles and stretch,\nand tell you to contract.\nThe way that they work is\nthrough gamma motor neurons,\nand so these are sensory things.\nSo what's happening\nis, unlike when\nyou tell your\nmuscle to contract,\nit goes alpha to\nthe muscle contract.\nThese muscle spindles\nwork such that it\nis, oh, I've been stretched.\nSend signal back to\nsome central point,\ntypically in the spinal\ncord and we don't actually\nwant to go all the\nway up to the brain.\nWe've got a time delay.\nThis is why these are\nsubconscious, autonomic,\nor just somatic.\nSo that gamma is going to go\nback to the central location,\nand then come back through\nthe alpha motor neurons\nand tell it to contract.\nSo you have this\nwonderful mechanism\nof sensing stretch, going back.\nWell, one theory\nthat's been put forward\nregarding muscle damage, is\nthat the pressure is actually\nbeing applied to those nerve\nendings of the muscle spindles.\nAnd that's actually responsible\nfor the pain signal that's\ngoing back, and coming\nup to your brain\nand you're registering\nthat that is pain,\nrather than it is actually\nin the contractile units, so\nthe muscle fibers.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a very\nintriguing idea, because it\nwould suggest that\nstretch muscles in order\nto alleviate soreness, might\nbe the exact incorrect thing\nto do Now, I'm not\nsaying that for certain.\nI'm just building off\nthe mechanistic logic\nthat we've laid out here.\nReally, that you've\nlaid out here.\nANDY GALPIN: There is the\nmore effective principle\nbased on exactly that,\nwhich is, this is generally\nwhy low level movement\nis effective at reducing\nacute soreness.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because\nthat's low level contraction\nof the muscles, anti-stretch.\nANDY GALPIN: And you're going\nto extract and get tissue out.\nAnd you will get fluid out.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.\nANDY GALPIN: You're literally\npumping it out of the cell.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes,\nand in our previous\nepisode where we were talking\nabout programming or--\nI keep using the we,\nbut let's be fair here,\nwhere you were educating us,\nincluding me and the audience\nabout different\nstructures for programming\nexercise for\nspecific adaptations,\net cetera of the month, week,\nyear, scales, et cetera.\nWe had a brief\ndiscussion about the fact\nthat if one trains legs very\nhard with resistance training,\nand some heavy squatting\nor deadlifting it\nand there's some soreness.\nThen oftentimes doing\nsome \"lighter cardio\"\nor some low impact work\nthe next day, or any number\nof different things\nthat involve not\nhigh intensity contractions\nof the muscles,\nbut that do require\ncontractions of the muscles,\nthat it can alleviate soreness\nmore quickly than if one\nwere to simply lie around and\nwatch Netflix or something.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah,\nthat's exactly right.\nTo just go back just\na little bit as well,\nif that's really the\ncase, the question\nis, where is this inflammatory\nsignal coming from?\nAnd while there's much\nto be learned there,\nthere is a little\nRight now that suggests\nit's potentially coming\nfrom free radicals released\nfrom the mitochondria.\nAgain, that may or may not\nhold up as more research comes.\nI'm not sure, but\nif you remember\nback to our conversation\non endurance,\nso we talked about\nthe electron transport\nchain and anaerobic metabolism.\nRegardless of\nwhether or not you're\ngetting energy from\nglycolysis or carbohydrates.\nRemember they have\nto be finished\nthrough aerobic metabolism.\nSo even if you're\nlifting weights\nand you're using\ncarbs for your fuel,\nyou have got to\nfinish that metabolism\nby running it into\nthe mitochondria\nand performing\noxidative metabolism.\nAs a result of that, that\nelectron transport chain runs.\nSo theoretically, if free\nradicals, which are hyper\nreactive oxygen species,\nbasically they're\noxygen molecules that are\nmissing an electrons, so\nthat they react to\na lot of things.\nThey're the opposite of\nantioxidants by the way,\nso it's oxygen molecules\nwith extra protons,\nso they can balance the charge.\nIf those leak out,\nthat in and of itself\nis going to be a massive\ninflammatory signal.\nAnd that's probably what signals\nthe cause of these neutrophils\nand macrophages, and kicks\noff this entire cascade.\nAgain, I believe we need\nmore research there.\nI need to look into it.\nMaybe it's more\ndefinitive than I know,\nbut that's probably\nwhat's happening,\npotentially what's\nhappening rather,\nthat causes that\ncascade in signal.\nAlso, what you have is\nthis combination of, well,\nif that's the case,\nwhy am I not getting\ntremendous amount\nof muscle damage\nwhen I do more aerobic\nbased exercise?\nWell, because you don't have\nthe mechanical tension pulling\non the fibers, that's\nactually causing damage\nto the cell wall.\nThat allows these free radicals\nto escape the mitochondria,\nand the cell wall.\nSo that's the best we can\npostulate at this moment,\nas to why those\nthings are happening.\nAnd then why again,\nlow level exercise\ntends to enhance even\nthings like percussion.\nSo using either instruments that\nput a low level of vibration\ninto your leg or\nlike nomadic boots,\nso you massage,\nall of these things\nare generally probably\nhelping because they're\nmoving that stuff out.\nEdema most specifically.\nSo pressure comes off\nof those nerve endings\nand the muscle\nspindles, and allows\nyou to stop receiving\nthat signal of pain\ndespite the fact that\nyou didn't actually\nregenerate tissue at all yet.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
