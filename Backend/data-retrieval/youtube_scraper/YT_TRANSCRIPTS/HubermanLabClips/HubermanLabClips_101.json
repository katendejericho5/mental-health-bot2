    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: So what\nare some other methods\nthat we can use to\nalleviate acute soreness?\nANDY GALPIN: Well,\nif we continue down\nthis same theme,\nwhich is saying, OK,\nwe'll use some sort of\npressure manipulation\nto enhance recovery.\nIf compression is\none strategy, you\ncan also use things like\ncompression boots or garments.\nAnd these are nomadic devices\nthat will pump air outside you,\nand compress back and forth.\nThere's any number of\ndevices that will do this.\nYou can also use\nthe physical hand.\nSo this would be\nmassage and body work.\nThey're all really\nworking as best,\nwe can tell, on the\nsame mechanisms.\nWhich are effectively moving\nfluid in and out of the tissue,\nas well as potentially\nenhancing blood flow, increasing\ncapitalization and which is\ngoing to only get nutrients\nin and waste\nSo you can pick and choose based\nupon your budget, preferences,\navailability, timing,\nthings like that.\nSo those are all\neffective strategies.\nOutside of that really is\nthe next largest category,\nwhich is now thermal.\nAnd so far in this discussion\nwe've mentioned cold water\nimmersion and I talked about\nin the hypertrophy section, how\nyou would not want\nto do immediately\npost-exercise, which\nwould be getting\ninto cold water or an\nice bath, if you're\ntrying to grow a muscle mass.\nHaving said that, there\nis good evidence showing\nthat cold water\nimmersion specifically,\nis effective at reducing\nmuscle soreness.\nSo it is a fair\nconsideration, and it's\na classic example\nof how there are\nno free passes in physiology.\nNothing is always\ngood or always bad.\nIt's always about what are\nyou willing to give up versus\nwhat you're willing to get.\nAnd in the case of\ncold water immersion,\nyou may be thinking,\nyeah, I might\nwant some of the\nhypertrophic adaptations,\nbut if you're in that\nphase of training\nwhere you're actually trying to\npush more towards optimization\nin that moment, rather\nthan long term adaptation,\nthen an ice bath might\nbe a great choice.\nIn addition, if you fall\ninto a scenario like Natasha\ndid and you realize like, I'm\njust so unbelievably sore.\nThis might cost\nme three or four,\nor five or six days\nof training, it\nmight be worth it for you\nto accelerate that recovery\nprocess by a couple\nof days, so that you\ndon't miss so much training.\nSo it's just an algorithm.\nIt's an equation.\nWhat am I looking for?\nAgain, if I'm in-season\nor trying to compete,\nor if I have just done way,\nway, way too much exercise\nand I'm really in\nsignificant pain,\nyou would probably be willing\nto give up some small percentage\nof eventual muscle growth\nafter a single session\nto get out of pain.\nSo all of the cold strategies,\ncold water immersion\nis clearly the best approach\nrather than cold air,\nor some other tactic.\nSo a cold shower is\nprobably not enough here.\nYou really do want to be\neither in moderately cold.\nThis is maybe 40\nto 50 degree water,\nfor probably North\nof 15 minutes or you\ncan be in sub-40 for as\nlittle as maybe five minutes\nto get some of the effect.\nThere's been a\nnumber of studies,\nso I'm summarizing a\nbunch of that into one\nrather than going through\nthem point by point.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The\nnumbers you just threw out,\nwhich I'm assuming\nare Fahrenheit,\nseem really cold to me.\nUncomfortably cold.\nANDY GALPIN: Absolutely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nI always recommend\nthat people ease into it\nas a protocol overall.\nThat they not immediately\ngo to 35 degree cold water,\nif they've never done it before.\nThat said, once people\nare comfortable,\nbeing uncomfortable-- because\nI always answered the question,\nhow cold should it be exactly?\nWould you agree that it should\nbe very, very cold so much\nso that you really,\nreally want to get out,\nbut that you're able\nto stay in safely,\nwhatever that value\nhappens to be.\nANDY GALPIN: Absolutely\nneed to be Having said that,\nhave actually in\nour expert retreats\nput dozens, if not hundreds,\nof people at this point\nimmediately into\nthe sub 35 degree\nwater their first time\never and done three minutes\nmultiple rounds in a session\nso they can handle it.\nBut you don't need to go\nthat crazy if you don't want.\nYou kind of have to play a game.\nDo you want to be really, really\ncold for a short amount of time\nor do you want to\nbe kind of cold\nfor a longer amount of time?\nReally the only\nmistake you could make\nis doing something like\n65 degree water, which\nfor the most people is\nnot very comfortable\nand doing five or 10 minutes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's just\nnot going to be effective.\nANDY GALPIN: It's probably\nnot going to be effective.\nSo if you're like, man\n35 is absolutely crazy\nand you want to\ndo 55 degree water\nand there's literature\nin that area.\nBut it's going to say you need\nto probably be there somewhere\nalmost really North of\n10 minutes and some of it\nwill actually show you need\nto be in there like well\nNorth of 20 to 30 minutes.\nSo for my money I would\nrather go really, really cold\nand get it done in five\nminutes, but personal preference\non this one.\nYou can also make it a little\nbit easier on yourself.\nThere is not nearly\nas much evidence\nbut there is some\non contrast stuff.\nSo this is when you go cold,\nhot and sort of back and forth.\nThere are no really good\nrules in terms of how much\nshould you go?\nHow many rounds?\nHow long and cold?\nHow long and hot?\nAgain, there have been\na couple of studies\nand obviously those\nstudies use numbers,\nbut that doesn't\nmean those have been\ntested to see what are optimal,\nwhich is a very big difference.\nSo you can really just\nplay that by feel.\nHot is good for recovery.\nYou just have to be\ncareful because you\nare going to put more\nblood flow in the area.\nAnd so you may walk\nout of there with\nsome additional\nacute swelling which\nis then going to put\ngreater pressure on there.\nSo you have to play with that.\nI personally really\nlike hot for recovery.\nI will feel maybe not\ngreat in that moment.\nBut the next day, I tend to\nfeel really, really good.\nIn addition, if I wake\nup the next morning\nand I'm really, really\nhurting and I'm super stiff\na hot bath will help\nthat quite a bit.\nSo you can play with\nsome of those protocols.\nAgain, you don't have to do ice.\nThere's obviously no\nrequirement to do so.\nIt is just an option\nif you're interested\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, the\nstudies of Dr. Susanna Sjoberg\nare not directly\naimed at alleviating\nsoreness or recovery.\nThey're more about increasing\nthermal capacity by storage\nof Brown adipose tissue not\nthe Blikre fat but the stuff\naround the clavicles and\naround the heart that\nhelp you generate body heat at\nrest and metabolism and so on.\nAnd the numbers there that\nshe's come up with again,\nhave not been tested against\nall the possible derivations.\nJust like with breathing,\nwe did five minute sessions\nbut who knows,\nmaybe a minute would\nhave been equally effective.\nThere are constraints on\nthese sorts of studies.\nBut the values\nthat she's come up\nwith which seem to be good\nthresholds for making sure\nthat an adaptation response\nis triggered by heat and cold\nis it ends up being\n57 minutes per week\ntotal of uncomfortable but\nsafe heat, in that case sauna.\nAnd that can be\nall in one session\nor breaking it up into\na couple of sessions\non the same day\nor different days.\nAnd then 11 minutes\nper week of cold either\nin one single session\nor multiple sessions.\nAgain, one could do more.\nOne could break that\nup over multiple days\nor do it all in one day\nor do it all in one--\nAn hour in the sauna and then\n11 minutes and the cold or vise\nversa, although that seems a\nlittle bit extreme, especially\nfor the uninitiated.\nBut those are the numbers\nthat have been studied.\nBut as you point\nout, there are not\na lot of really thorough\nstudies examining\ndifferent cold protocols\naccording to temperature\nby time requirement.\nSo there is a bit of\nsubjective feel required\nto establish a routine.\nANDY GALPIN: And\nI would actually\nsay this is another time\nto reemphasize something\nwe talked about at the beginning\nof our conversation, which\nis that pain itself is\nnot a defined outcome.\nIt's heavily influenced\nby your perception.\nAnd so if you don't feel\nlike they work for you,\nthey won't work.\nIf you feel like they\nwork fantastic, they do.\nSo it's a challenging field to\nget really objective data on.\nSo there's always going to be a\nlittle bit of subjective nature\nto some of these things.\nI can tell you anecdotally\nwe've used hot and cold contrast\nfor a long time with athletes.\nSome love it, some don't\ncare for it and everything\nin between.\nSo it's one of those things\nwhere I never mandated.\nOf course, I can't mandate\nanything for anyone\nI work with.\nBut I'm never like hey,\nare you interested?\nGreat.\nYou're struggling in this\narea, do you want to try this?\nYou did and you liked it, great.\nYou're struggling in this\narea and you tried it\nyou didn't love it.\nOK, fine.\nWe'll find other routes\nas we'll get into.\nThere's a lot of ways\nto enhance recovery.\nThis is only one\nand it hasn't even\nreally come down to stopping\nthe problem in the first place.\nWe're just treating symptoms,\nwhich is first line of defense\nbut you really need to\ngo back and figure out\nwhy it's happening to\nbegin with as a solution.\nThese are just different\nagain, acute symptom management\ntactics.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
