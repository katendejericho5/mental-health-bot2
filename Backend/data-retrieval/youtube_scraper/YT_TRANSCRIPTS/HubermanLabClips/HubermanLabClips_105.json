    "transcript": "ANDY GALPIN: If the answer is\nno, we're in a peaking phase,\nthen we're actually\ngoing to use what\nI call acute state shifters.\nSo this is a whole\nhost of little tricks\nthat I have that can\nchange HRV or any recovery\nmetric within seconds.\nAgain, these are\nnot chronic fixes.\nThis is just I'm\nhaving a bad day today.\nI feel like crap.\nCan I make myself\nfeel better right now?\nAnd so I kind of call\nthese parlor tricks a lot\nof the times.\nAnd there's a thousand of them.\nWe were certainly not\ngoing to go over them.\nBut I'll give you some examples.\nYou can pull out-- first of all\nphysical movement will do it.\nYou'd be stunned how\njust doing some yoga,\nmoving around, doing\nsome jumping jacks,\nstarting your workout\nI mean, you've\nprobably experienced this.\nIt's sort of cliche in\nour world at this point.\nBut if you ever do any serious\nlifting over a serious amount\nof time, there will be days\nwhen which you walk into the gym\nand you feel awful.\nAnd somehow that day you saved\na lifetime PR ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, that's a\nstrange phenomenon.\nI experienced that\nmore than a few times.\nThe inverse is rare however.\nYou feel great you have\nhave a horrible workout.\nIt happens, and it can\nhappen for any number\nof different reasons.\nBut yeah, I think\nthe former when\none isn't feeling very\ngood and then somehow it's\na terrific workout does set\na kind of a seed of doubt\nas to how good our subjective\nassessments really are,\nwhich I guess is\nwhy we were talking\nabout objective\nassessments like HRV.\nANDY GALPIN: And remember,\nif it's a single day here,\nyou can even do hard training.\nPeople sort of have this\nidea like well if you get up\nand your recovery score's\ndown, do a lighter day.\nI'm probably never\nmaking that choice\nto be honest not\nin this situation.\nRemember this is\none bad day and we\nare in a phase of even trying to\nimprove performance right now.\nLike we're probably\nstill training hard.\nYou will again, often\nsee I felt terrible\nwhen I trained super hard and it\ntotally changed my day around.\nThis all can happen.\nSo exercise is my\nfirst love here.\nAbsolutely breathing.\nAny sort of up\nregulation breathing.\nSo we talked a lot about\ndown regulation breathing.\nJust do the opposite.\nAnd so this is when\nhyperventilation strategies\ncan work.\nInstead of accentuating\nthe exhale,\nyou accentuate the Inhale\nor you restrict the exhale.\nThis is working on the\nexact opposite situation.\nYou can also play little-- this\nis where things like music,\nmotivational quotes.\nIf you're the type that\nfollows people on Instagram\nthat motivates you or can\nwork with these things.\nCoaching tactics.\nThese can be things like\nfinding out or talking\nabout that person's why.\nYou shared something\nthat a mantra\nyou use when you're training\nhard to keep you go better.\nI'm not going to ask\nyou to share that now,\nbut people have this sometimes.\nOr you may have this\nconversation with your athlete.\nWe call this finding\nout your why.\nSo finding out like why\nare you really here?\nWhat are we doing here?\nAnd a lot of times\nyou'll hear things like,\nit's because I grew up\npoor and I don't ever\nwant to be poor again.\nOK, great.\nThis is for my children, or\nlike any number of things.\nAnd you can pull that\nout on these days.\nYou need to be really careful.\nThis is why I call\nthese parlor tricks\nbecause when you play\nthat card too often\nit starts to lose effect.\nAnd you can only dig\nto a hole so often\nbefore it's sort of the--\nThe same thing is with music.\nIf every time you go\nto the weight room\nit's blasting death\nmetal at level 10.\nWell, eventually, it's\nno longer motivating.\nIt's no longer helpful.\nSo you want to deploy these\nthings strategically ANDREW\nHUBERMAN: Yeah, the\nphrase that comes to mind\nis signal the noise.\nThe nervous system,\nespecially the dopamine system\nand the adrenaline system,\nwhich are a part of this larger\nsystem called the\ncatecholamine system,\nso that has dopamine,\nepinephrine, norepinephrine.\nThe get up and go, focus\non external goals, movement\nassociated and on\nand on, that system\nresponds best to high\nsignal relative to noise.\nSo if you're as you point out\nlistening to music every time\ndrinking a ton of caffeine,\nenergy drinks preworkout\nnootropics and then\nstacking all those things,\nsometimes refer to this\nas dopamine stacking,\ninformally referred to\nas dopamine stacking,\nyou're doing all those things.\nAnd then first of\nall, then you're\nwondering why later\nthat afternoon\nor the next day you're feeling\nlike you're under a cloud.\nIt's obvious your\ncatecholamine system crashed.\nBut it's also that\nyou don't necessarily\nbecome dependent on it.\nIt's just that you start\nto wonder whether or not\nyou have the internal mechanisms\nand motivation to train\nwithout those things.\nAnd so one tends to\nuse them more and more\nand then they have a\ndiminishing effect over time.\nThe rule that I've been\nsort of applying has been I\nnever do two workouts\nin a row where\nI'm stacking in stimulants,\nloud music and any kind\nof high potency inspiration.\nHowever, every set in\nthe gym or when I run,\nI really try and be diligent\nabout form and attention\nto what I'm doing.\nThe one exception would be the\nlong duration endurance work.\nPart of the reason I do\nthat work is to let my mind\ngo into states of drifting.\nI'm not trying to think\nin complete sentences\nor even close to it.\nJust let my brain kind\nof idle at a low hum.\nAnd for that reason\ngenerally listen\nto something that's\nmore of a story\nor don't listen\nto anything at all\nand just let my\nthoughts spool through.\nAnyway, I don't want to\ntake us too far off track,\nbut I think this idea\nof signal to noise\nwill resonate with the\nengineers out there.\nBut since most people\nare likely not engineers.\nIt is the way that\nthe nervous system\nworks evidenced by the fact\nthat whatever area of your body\nright now is in contact with\na chair or any other surface\nthat it's been in contact with\nfor more than a few seconds,\nyou forget that it's\nin contact with it\nbecause there's low signal\nto noise at that point.\nANDY GALPIN: Similar note, you\nactually mentioned stimulants.\nBasically whether you're talking\ncaffeine or any other stimulant\nany other cortisol modulators or\nadaptogens, any of these things\nfall in the category.\nIf you're not using\nthem consistently\nand you're having a rough\nday and all of a sudden,\nyou throw down 200\nmilligrams of caffeine.\nIt's going to change real fast--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's strong\nperformance enhancing effect.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely.\nAnd for these reasons.\nSo we mentioned a couple\nof them, breath work, food,\nmore calories, just\neating some food.\nSometimes we'll give people\nlike what we call comfort foods.\nSo this is just like,\nhey you're from Georgia\nand we know you love grits\nso we're having grits\nfor breakfast Oh, great,\nlike just something to change\nyour mood, acute state\nshifters to alter it.\nThe other couple of\ntricks here are light.\nSo if we know that maybe say\nmultiple people are struggling\nthat day, maybe we'll put\non the lights extra bright.\nWe'll bring in some\nextra things and just\nget it more light in there.\nAnd that even counts actually\ngoing outside and seeing\nthe sun, but perhaps\nwe'll do that.\nAnd then other little\ntricks that I've\nlearned over the years\nis one particular thing\nI love is literally drawing\na line, a physical line\non the ground.\nAnd you look at\nthat line and you\nsay like I'm going\nto train today\nand I'm going to\naccomplish this effort.\nI'm not going to\nwalk past this line\nand into that training\nspace until I'm\nready to give that effort.\nAnd that may take a\nminute or 10 or whatever.\nBut the physical barrier\nis very important to saying\nlike I'm not just going\nto get through it.\nI'm going to actually perform\nthe way I want to perform\nor I'm not going to do it.\nAnd I'm not going to\ncross this line until I'm\nready to make that happen.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nreally like that tool.\nIt also brings to mind\nthe importance of,\nat least thinking about how your\nrelationship with your phone\nduring training can perhaps\nhelp but also impede workout,\nmotivation and performance.\nIn an earlier\nepisode you mentioned\nthat if people are\nusing their phone\nto play music during\ntheir workout,\nthat they establish the complete\nplaylist prior to initiating\nthe workout and then not\ndeviate from that playlist\nas opposed to changing\nit in the middle\nbecause there's just\ntoo much of an impulse\nto also check social\nmedia, check email, check\ntext messages.\nI mean, the way I think\nabout the phone actually\nis it's a bunch of\nlittle brain areas.\nIt's got a memory\nsystem for you.\nIt's got lookup tables\nfor-- lookup tables.\nIt's got websites to look\nthings up on the internet.\nIt's got photos.\nI mean, it is so rich\nwith sensory data\nand it's so closely linked to\nour own brain architecture.\nThe algorithms are\ndesigned for those\nto be that way, that I\nalways think about it\nas bringing in a\nsecond person with me,\nbut that person is my twin that\nhas severe attention issues.\nAnd for those that already\nhave attention issues,\njust think about this as a twin\nthat would then compound you\nby tapping on your shoulder,\ntalking to you all the time,\ninterrupting you.\nSomebody that you\nlike a lot, but that\nfrankly is a little bit\nirritating in that they're\ninterrupting your ability\nto really show up.\nAnd also your ability\nto show up for them.\nSo I started to think about the\nphone as an entire individual\nand that it represents me\nand certainly not the better\nversion of me.\nANDY GALPIN: Exactly.\nYou actually mentioned\nsomething else\nthat we'll use occasionally,\nwhat we call brain games\nor puzzles whether this\nis a crossword puzzle\nor something where you actually\nlose your thought of self\nfor a second, and your\nbrain gets engaged in a task\nthat you weren't regretting\nor even thinking about.\nThese can be stupid\nlittle games.\nIt could be little\nchallenges, especially\nif you're in like a\ngroup or a team setting.\nLike we're going to play\none round of dodgeball\nor we're going to play\none round of Thumb Wars.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nyou do encourage this?\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I see.\nANDY GALPIN: So you would\nplay like a thing instead\nof warming up.\nIt's like all right.\nGet in there.\nEveryone get going, get your\nfoam roller or your dime\nor whatever thing.\nThis is like, all\nright, everyone line up\nand we're going to play\nThumb Wars to see who wins.\nJust like whatever.\nAnd all of a sudden you\nsnapped into a new mental shift\nor literally\nplaying brain games,\nplaying Tetris on your\nphone, any of these things\ncan work in this acute setting.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
