    "transcript": "SARA GOTTFRIED: To me this\nproblem is not just menopause.\nWhat's more interesting is\nto talk about perimenopause.\nSo perimenopause is\nthe period of time\nbefore your final\nmenstrual cycle.\nAnd for most women,\ndepending on how attuned\nyou are to the symptoms,\nit can last for 10 years.\nSo I'm still in perimenopause.\nIt's been, like, 20\nyears because I've\nbeen tracking it so carefully.\nIt usually gets\nkicked off by having\nyour cycle get closer together.\nSo that can happen in\nyour 30s or your 40s.\nYou go from 28 days to 25\ndays, that sort of thing.\nYou may notice that\nyou start sleeping\nmore poorly because\nprogesterone is so important.\nYou talked about that with Kyle.\nMay notice it as more\nanxiety, difficulty sleeping,\nand that probably is related\nto the estrogen receptor.\nSo your alpha is--\nestrogen receptor alpha is\nanxio-- it increases anxiety.\nYour beta is associated\nwith an anxiolytic activity.\nAnd then there's a total of\nabout six estrogen receptors\nnow.\nThere's the G-protein-coupled\nestrogen receptors,\nand those are mixed\nanxiolytic/anxiogenic.\nSo there's this whole\nperiod of perimenopause.\nAnd what's most\nfascinating to me--\nand we've got to talk\nabout this either today\nor another time-- is that there\nis this massive, massive change\nthat happens in the female\nbrain that people are not\ntalking about enough.\nAnd so looking at the\nwork of Lisa Mosconi\nat Cornell, from\nstarting around age 40,\nthere is this massive change\nin cerebral metabolism.\nSo you can do FDG-PET scans.\nYou can look at glucose uptake.\nAnd there's about, on average,\na 20% decline from premenopause\nup to like age 35\nto perimenopause\nto post menopause.\nThe women who are having the\nmost symptoms in perimenopause,\nmenopause-- the hot\nflashes, the night,\nsweats the difficulty\nsleeping-- those\nare the ones who have\nthe most significant\ncerebral hypometabolism.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nit's almost like a--\nI don't want to scare\npeople with this language,\nbut it's a low-level--\nor let's call\nit pseudodementia of sorts.\nSARA GOTTFRIED: Yes, it\nseems to be a phenotype\nthat you can then map\nto Alzheimer's disease\nbecause that's Lisa\nMosconi's work.\nShe's looking at, OK,\nAlzheimer's disease\nis not a disease of old age.\nIt is a disease of middle age.\nWhat are some of the\nbiomarkers that we\ncan define that can tell\nyou what your risk is?\nI've got a mother\nand a grandmother\nwith Alzheimer's disease.\nYou can believe, I am\nall over this data.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And insulin\nresistance, insulin--\nSARA GOTTFRIED: Huge part of it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--insensitivity,\nas we talked about before, seems\nto be somewhere in there, which\nI think, first, when\nthat idea first surfaced,\na few people were like, really?\nBut then, of course, right?\nI mean, the brain is this\nincredibly metabolically\ndemanding organ.\nYou deprive neurons\nof fuel sources,\nor you make them less\nsensitive to fuel sources.\nThey start dying.\nThey suddenly start firing less.\nIt makes perfect sense.\nAnd I think now it's\nthanks to Lisa's work, work\nthat you've done and talked\nabout quite a lot in your books\nand elsewhere I think\nhas really highlighted\nfor people that metabolism\nand metabolomics is\ngoing to be as important\nas genes and genomics\nwhen it comes to--\nSARA GOTTFRIED: That's right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --dementia,\nperhaps especially in women.\nIs it safe to say that?\nSARA GOTTFRIED: I think\nso because we believe\nthat the system is\nregulated by estrogen. So\nthe decline in estrogen,\nstarting around age 40--\n43 is kind of the\naverage-- seems\nto be the driver behind\ncerebral hypometabolism.\nThe way I describe\nit to my patients\nis it's like slow brain energy.\nSo you walk into a room.\nYou can't remember why.\nLike, you just notice that\nyou can't manage all the tasks\nthe way that you once could.\nLike, things are\njust a little slower.\nAnd I say that to\nwomen, and they're\nlike, [GASPS] I have that.\nLike, help me.\nSo this is then\ncircling back to WHI,\nwhere women are scared to death\nof taking hormone therapy.\nAnd we've got all\nof these women that\nare marching toward\npotentially a greater\nrisk of Alzheimer's disease.\nAnd they have this opportunity\nin their 40s, in their 50s,\nto take hormone therapy,\nand they may not\nbe offered it because the\ntypical conventional approach,\nbased on WHI, is to say, unless\nyou're having hot flashes\nand night sweats\nthat are severe,\nI'm not going to give\nyou hormone therapy.\nAnd I just want\nto call that out.\nI would say, no, that is\nnot the way to approach it.\nFurther, the concept right\nnow in conventional medicine\nis that hot flashes\nand night sweats\nare these nuisance symptoms\nthat we will take care\nof temporarily, maybe with\na little bit of estrogen\nand progesterone,\nor a birth control\npill, because it's given a lot.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nOr that they pass.\nSARA GOTTFRIED:\nOr that you just--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Or\nthis idea-- like, yeah.\nSARA GOTTFRIED: --suck it up.\nSuck it up.\nDoesn't matter that you're\nnot sleeping anymore.\nTurn down the\ntemperature in your room.\nAnd that's not right because\nhot flashes and night\nsweats are a biomarker of\ncardiometabolic disease.\nThey are a biomarker\nof increased bone loss.\nThey are a biomarker of\nchanges in the brain.\nSo many of these symptoms\nthat occur in perimenopause\nare not driven by the ovaries.\nThey are driven by the brain.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
