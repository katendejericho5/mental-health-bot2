    "transcript": "NOAM SOBEL: As you may know, \nloss of the sense of smell\nis one of the, if not the earliest, sign\nof neurodegenerative disease.\nSo, for example, in Parkinson's disease\nthere's loss in the sense of smell\nprobably 10 years before\nany other symptom.\nPeople have failed to make\nthis a diagnostic tool\nbecause it's non-specific.\nSo it's not as if you could\ncome to your doctor and say,\n\"I'm losing my sense of smell,\"\nand they'll say, \"Oh,\nearly sign of Parkinson's,\"\nbecause you can have many reasons\nto lose your sense of smell and so on.\nOlfactory loss, again, is an early sign\nof neurodegeneration, and\nthere's at least one theory,\nparticularly about Alzheimer's disease,\nsuggesting that that\nAlzheimer's may be the result\nof a pathogen that enters the brain\nthrough the olfactory system.\nHow interesting.\nIt's not, of course, a mainstream\nor widely accepted theory of any type,\nbut it just highlights this notion\nthat the nose is a path to our brain."
