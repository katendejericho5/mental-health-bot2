    "transcript": "Maybe we could talk about\nbromocriptine a little bit,\nand I'm not encouraging people to run out\nand take bromocriptine.\nBromocriptine, as you mentioned,\nis a dopamine agonist,\nrelatively short-acting?\nYeah, four, five hours, six hours.\nSo, it kicks in about 90 minutes after-\nRight.\nANDREW: As I recall\nyou saying.\nRight.\nANDREW: I've never taken it.\nYeah.\nHow do people feel when\nthey're on bromocriptine?\nI mean, when I hear dopamine agonists,\nI mean, there are a lot of illicit drugs\nlike cocaine, methamphetamine,\nthat increase dopamine.\nBut then again, chocolate,\nsex and food increase dopamine.\nBut the kinetics, the\ntime course and the levels\nare different-\nRight.\nFor each of those things.\nDopamine, of course, being a currency\nof motivation and reward,\nnot directly related to any one compound.\nBut I would think that based\non the data you just described,\nand given the fact\nthat there are a number\nof people out there\nwith challenges in working memory,\nattention, task switching, et cetera,\nthat there would be a strong interest,\non the part of the pharmaceutical\ncompanies at least,\nand certainly the general public,\nin things like bromocriptine\nto increase dopamine,\nto increase working memory,\ngiven it is our superpower.\nYeah, I mean, one of the\nmost disappointing things\nto me in my career\nhas been that pharmaceutical companies\nhave not picked up on this idea\nthat we could improve cognition\nand very specifically\nimprove a kind of process\nwith very specific neuromodulators.\nThe discovery that depletion of dopamine\nand not other transmitters\nimpairs working memory\nwas made in 1979.\nWhen I heard Pat\nGoldman-Raki talk about this\nas a resident, I was just amazed\nthat there could be a single transmitter\ncan change a single behavior.\nI was seeing very complicated\nbehavioral deficits,\nand it just seemed impossible to me\nthat there could be such a tight link\nbetween a single neuromodulator\nand a single cognitive process,\nand just opened the door for me\nthat this really could be\na incredibly beneficial therapy\nfor anyone with executive function\nor frontal lobe function, so,\nbut unfortunately, there's never been\na pharmaceutical company\nthat's tried to develop a\ndrug for improving cognition,\nto this day.\nThat's crazy.\nAnd I mean, it's crazy\nfor several reasons.\nOne is that the data are clearly there.\nTwo, these drugs are already established.\nIt's not like they have to go\nthrough safety trials again.\nThat's already been done.\nBut mostly because regardless\nof whether one is a fan\nof the pharmaceutical industry\nor hates it, the pharmaceutical\nindustry in principle\ncan make a ton of money doing this.\nSo I would think that they'd\nbe heavily incentivized\nto do it.\nSo why have they turned\na blind eye on this?\nI'm not sure.\nI mean, when I realized that\nI could test these drugs\nin healthy individuals, that they were,\nif I gave 'em in low enough\ndoses, they were safe.\nAnd I had so much experience\nof 'em in patients\nthat I felt comfortable doing it.\nThen I started asking\npharmaceutical companies, you know,\n\"Do you want to get involved here?\"\nThis should be done. I\ncan't do this by myself.\nWe need to have real trials\nand real studies of how this will help.\nYou know, and just, it was, you know,\ntheir eyes would always cross\nand never got any sort of traction.\nIt always went back to\nsort of disease, you know.\nWhat disease are you curing?\nYou know, what's the market for it?\nIs it a Parkinson's disease thing?\nIs it an Alzheimer's disease thing?\nAnd this has been a general\nproblem with neurology.\nIt's very disease centric.\nIt's always focused on, you know,\nhow can we develop a\ntreatment for Alzheimer's\nor traumatic brain injury\nor stroke as opposed to\nhow can we develop a treatment\nfor working memory dysfunction,\nwhich is a problem across diseases.\nSo the answer to your earlier question is,\nthese drugs are very safe.\nWe give 'em in such low doses\nto help the individuals.\nThey don't even know.\nThey can't even tell the difference\nbetween the placebo and the drug.\nReally?\nThey don't even know which one they're on.\nSo they're not buzzing thinking like-\nNo.\nOh, this feels good.\nThey have no idea.\nAnd my working memory is better.\nThey have no idea.\nThey don't even know their\nworking memory is better\nuntil we show 'em that their\nworking memory is better, so-\nANDREW: Love it.\nYeah.\nSo they're truly blind to what's going on.\nBromocriptine is but one\nof the dopamine agonists,\ncan think of a few others.\nCabergoline, like other things like that.\nDo any of these dopamine agonists\nexert this impact on working memory?\nOr does it vary by drug\nbecause different dopamine agonists\nsort of hit different receptor pathways\nand things like that?\nYeah, no, it's not specifically the drug.\nI mean, the reason for bromocriptine\nis that it's the oldest\nand it's the one I was\nmost comfortable with.\nI had to be comfortable with it clinically\nbefore I'd give it to\nundergraduates at Penn or Berkeley.\nSo, there's nothing special.\nBut other agonists work similarly.\nThere's a drug that's\ndeveloped for Parkinsons,\nwhich is a COMT inhibitor,\nwhich actually inhibits\nthis enzyme that we're talking about,\nand that also will improve,\nwill have the same function.\nThere's been some work that norepinephrine\nalso seems to be helpful\nwith working memory.\nIt's maybe not as potent\nas the dopaminergic,\nand that's the point I want to make.\nAnother disappointing thing\nabout this whole field\nwith the pharmacology of cognition.\nYou know, I wrote a paper as a resident.\nYou know, sometimes you're tending to say,\n\"Hey, can you write this\nreview paper for us?\"\nAnd I wrote one as a resident called\n\"The Pharmacology Cognition,\"\nwhere I just looked at all\nthe animal literature on,\nyou know, giving\nneuromodulators, acetylcholine,\ndopamine, epinephrine,\nand there was a lot of animal\nliterature sort of supporting\nthat this would work in humans,\nbut what was more striking to me\nwas that it wasn't always just\na single neurotransmitter.\nThere were studies where\nyou'd give dopamine\nand it wouldn't do anything.\nYou give acetylcholine, and\nit wouldn't do anything.\nBut if you gave a low dose of both,\nit would be really effective.\nSo these, you know, these\nsystems don't act in isolation.\nSo, we need to also study sort\nof how the combinations work.\nAnd that's where another, you know,\nwhere the pharmaceutical companies have\nthe infrastructure to do\nthese kind of studies.\nIt's very hard to do in a single lab,\nto do multiple drugs\nat one time, you know,\nand then try and determine all\nthe different interactions.\nMaybe we could talk about\na couple of other drugs\nthat are legal and have FDA approval,\nare known to be safe in the right context,\nthat it seems would fit the bill here\nfor improving working memory.\nOne is Wellbutrin.\nBupropion? Bupropion?\nI can never pronounce that.\nAs far as I know, it's a epinephrine\nor norepinephrine agonist.\nYou just mentioned that\nincreasing epinephrine\nmay have a positive\nimpact in working memory\nand to some extent a dopamine agonist.\nIs there any evidence that Wellbutrin\ncan improve working memory?\nYeah, anything that boosts\nnorepinephrine can do it.\nThe one that we've used that's\nmost used is guanfacine,\nwhich is actually a blood\npressure medication.\nSo that's starting to gain some traction.\nIn fact, I think there\nwas a study with COVID,\nwith brain fog for COVID,\nshowing that improved symptoms with it.\nSo there's actually some trials now\nthat are looking at guanfacine.\nAnd so, I would say anything\nthat boosts norepinephrine\nwould be helpful.\nBut then again, I don't want to leave out\nthe other transmitters.\nSerotonin, you know, increasing serotonin,\nincreasing acetylcholine, boosts\nother cognitive processes.\nAnd then, you know, in a way,\nthey can help working memory.\nWe talked about working\nmemory being this foundation.\nWell, if you give vasyl choline\nand it kind of boosts memory, well,\nthat can indirectly help\nyour executive function.\nOr if you give a drug\nthat improves your focus,\nthen that can indirectly help,\nyou know, working memory.\nSo what I'm really pushing\nfor is not just a single,\nyou know, it's going to be one drug.\nIt's going to be a cocktail.\nAnd we have to not only figure\nout what the cocktail is,\nbut also figure out\nwho we're giving it to,\nyou know, link it to\nthe person's own makeup\nof their own neurochemistry.\nWhen we get to a point where we'll know\nwe can map out sort everyone's dopamine,\nnorepinephrine, serotonin levels,\nthen we'll make real\nprogress in helping them.\nBecause right now, I sort\nof say with my students,\nwhat we're doing is just\nlike cutting open the skull\nand just sort of pouring\nit onto the brain.\nIt's-\nYou're not actually doing that.\nWe're not actually doing it-\nANDREW: Right.\nBut it seems that way.\nThe precision is not there yet.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
