    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: There\nare now emerging methods\nthat people are using in order\nto separate out the sperm that\nwill indeed give rise\nto a male offspring\nversus a female offspring.\nNow, this, of course,\nis done in the context\nof in-vitro fertilization.\nWe haven't talked too much\nabout in-vitro fertilization.\nBut in-vitro\nfertilization involves,\nas the name suggests, taking\nan egg and taking a sperm,\npairing them in a dish.\nThis can be done a\nnumber of different ways.\nBut just to briefly\ndescribe the IVF procedure,\nIVF involves administering\nsupra-- meaning greater\nthan normal--\nsupraphysiological levels\nof follicle-stimulating\nhormone and luteinizing hormone\nduring the follicular\nphase of a woman's cycle.\nWhat that causes is the\nmaturation of not just one\negg that would be ovulated but\nmultiple follicles and eggs.\nAnd then ovulation\nitself is suppressed also\nthrough the administration\nof exogenous hormones.\nAnd then, under\nultrasound guidance,\nan OB/GYN goes in and collects\nthe mature eggs and follicles,\nputs them in a\ndish, and then sperm\nare delivered to that dish,\nand those could either\nbe sperm that were\nfrozen previously,\nor more typically or ideally,\nit would be live sperm collected\nthat day that are\nwashed through a very\nstraightforward procedure.\nAnd then those sperm\neither are allowed\nto compete for those eggs\nand fertilize those eggs\nand allow them to advance\nto very early embryo stage\nbefore those embryos are\nfrozen and eventually implanted\ninto a woman in order to have\nthem be carried to full term,\nideally.\nOr there's a procedure in which\nspecific sperm are selected\nbecause they have the\nbest morphology, motility,\nand so forth.\nAnd in a process\ncalled ICSI, I-C-S-I,\nin which the sperm themselves\nare literally forced\nto fertilize that\nparticular egg.\nNow, under those conditions,\ntypically a couple or a woman,\nif she's doing this on her\nown with a sperm donor,\nwill get multiple\nfertilized embryos\nthat are carried to\na multicellular stage\nso that it's clear that\nthey could grow into a child\nif they were implanted into\na viable host-- sometimes\nthe surrogate,\nsometimes the woman\nwho wants the child herself.\nAnd under those\nconditions, it is\npossible to look at\nthe genetic makeup,\nincluding the karyotype,\nof those early nascent\nembryos, in which case\npeople really can select\nthe sex of their offspring.\nThat is, they will have\nsome embryos that are\nXX, some embryos that are XY.\nIt's very likely,\nalso, that they\nwill have some embryos that have\nkaryotypes or genotypes which\nare not ideal in that\nthey would potentially\nlead to a miscarriage or\nsome other genetic defect.\nAnd so, typically,\npeople do not select\nto implant those embryos\nif they have the option\nto implant embryos that are\nof either XX or XY karyotype\nand the normal\nchromosomal arrangements\nfor obvious reasons.\nSo the whole point here is\nthat sex selection is possible,\nbut only using\nin-vitro fertilization.\nThe other thing that\nis becoming clear to us\nin more recent years is that\nsex selection is actually\npossible at the level\nof the sperm even prior\nto fertilization.\nThis is an emerging data\nset, and this is largely\nhappening in clinics outside\nof the United States.\nBut there are some clinics\nthat have figured out methods\nin which they can\ntake a sperm sample\nand they can spin that\nsperm sample in a centrifuge\nat a rate that separates\nout the sperm into what\nare called different fractions.\nSo for those of you who've\ndone a little bit of biology\nwith centrifuge, it's when\nyou spin any kind of substance\nthat includes multiple things\nin it of different weights.\nWhen you spin them, the\nthings of different weights\nsegregate out into\ndifferent fractions\nalong the depth of the tube.\nAnd then you can take out\none fraction or the next\nsimply with a little pipette.\nYou take out the top\nfraction, the middle fraction,\nand so forth.\nAnd what these clinics\nhave figured out\nis that if they spin the sperm\nsample at the correct spin rate\nthat the sperm\nthat will give rise\nto male offspring and the\nsperm that will give rise\nto female offspring segregate\nout into different fractions,\nallowing them to take each\nof those fractions separately\nand to apply them to eggs, if\nit's in-vitro fertilization,\nand give rise very reliably,\ncertainly much more\nthan chance, to either\nmale or female embryos.\nThey also, of course,\ncan choose to do\nthis outside the context\nof in-vitro fertilization.\nSo some people are now opting\nto have their sperm samples spun\nout in this way, separate\nout the sperm that give rise\nto male or female\noffspring, and then\nto only use the\nfraction that they\nare interested in--\nso if they want a boy,\nthey'll use one fraction.\nIf they want a girl, they'll\nuse different fraction--\nand then to use those fractions\nin the context of what's\ncalled IUI, or intrauterine\ninsemination, which\nis, as the name suggests, rather\nthan having the man deliver\nthe ejaculate with his penis\nand the sperm with his penis,\nthey have a device.\nThe devices are now\ncommercially sold.\nBelieve it or not, they're\nsold over-the-counter\nand on the internet, so people\nwill even do this at home.\nAnd so what they're doing\nis they'll take the sperm,\nand they'll do IUI in order\nto bias the probability\nthat they're going to get a\nmale or a female offspring.\nAgain, this is something\nthat's now emerging.\nIt's not commonplace.\nMost of the time, people simply\nroll the dice, as it were,\nby having either intercourse\nand just hoping for or not\ncaring if they get a male\nor a female offspring\nor, in the instance\nof IVF, selecting\nmale or female offspring,\nsometimes largely\non the basis of the\nchromosomal arrangements.\nSo of course, some\npeople might prefer\nto have one or the\nother biological sex\nas their offspring.\nBut of course, the healthy\nchromosomal arrangements\nare going to be paramount\nfor getting a healthy child.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nunhealthy chromosomal\narrangements or abnormal\nchromosomal arrangements\noften lead to miscarriage\nand/or birth defects.\nSo selecting for healthy\nchromosomal arrangements\nis always paramount,\nbut some people\nare selecting for\nbiological sex.\nAnd indeed, some couples\nwho can conceive naturally\nare opting for\nIUI in order to be\nable to select biological\nsex because of this ability\nto spin out the sperm samples\nto different fractions\nand select the male\nor female sperm.\nThat is, the sperm\nthat would give rise\nto a male or female offspring.\nSo this is a rapidly emerging\ntheme, believe it or not.\nWho knew?\nAnd of course, it has nothing to\ndo with Aristotle's assertions\nabout what people are\nthinking about at the point\nof ejaculation, nor\ndoes it have anything\nto do with body position at\nthe point of ejaculation.\nBut I do find it\nrather interesting\nthat, even in this\nday and age, people\nseem to be continually\npursuing new and different ways\nto understand why one\nsperm or another sperm\nhappens to fertilize the egg.\nAnd when that information\nis not available,\nbecause, frankly, it's\nnot available yet--\nwe don't know why\na sperm containing\na Y chromosome or a sperm\ncontaining an X chromosome\nis more likely to\nfertilize an egg.\nAnd there are some\nideas, for instance,\nthat older fathers tend to\nhave more daughters as opposed\nto sons.\nBut when you really look at\nthe data, it's pretty mixed.\nSo if you've heard\nthat before, it\nhas a particular nickname\nthat I'm not going\nto describe on the podcast.\nYou can look it up online.\nBut if any of you are aware\nof any other kind of ideals\nor lore, no matter how\nridiculous or crazy, please\nput them in the comment\nsection on YouTube.\nI'd be very curious\nto learn about those.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
