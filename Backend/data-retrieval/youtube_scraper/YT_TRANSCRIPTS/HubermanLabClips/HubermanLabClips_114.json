    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThere are now a lot\nof data supporting the idea\nthat acupuncture of all things,\ncan be very beneficial\nfor improving\nboth female and male\nfertility and should\na woman get pregnant\nfor improving\nthe quality of outcomes.\nThat is the\nlikelihood that there\nwill be a successful\npregnancy that\nis carried to term not premature\nand so on and so forth.\nNow for some of you out there\nyou might think, Oh, of course,\nacupuncture has been known to\nwork for thousands of years\nand therefore,\nit's not surprising\nthat it would assist with\nfertility and pregnancy.\nFor many of you\nout there, however,\nprobably thinking acupuncture\nthat seems like fringe science,\nbut what I can assure\nyou is that there are now\nquite a few clinical\ntrials funded\nby government agencies like\nthe National Institutes\nof Health, showing\nthat acupuncture\nis a very effective\ntreatment for a number\nof different things, including\nfertility and pregnancy.\nBut for hormone status,\nfor stress relief,\nbut even for chronic\nillnesses of different kinds,\nincluding autoimmune illnesses.\nSo this is no longer\nconsidered fringe science.\nIn fact, one of the\nbest laboratories\nin the world working on\nthis, is a laboratory\nout of Harvard Medical School\nrun by a guy named Qiufu Ma.\nQiufu's lab has really been\nexploring in a mechanistic way\nhow the different\nstimulation sites that are\nused in acupuncture.\nSo where the needles\nare inserted.\nTap into neural pathways,\nthat link the different organs\nof the body.\nSo for instance, they've\nfound that stimulation\nof a particular site\non the lower limb\ncan reduce inflammation\ndramatically\nthroughout the body, by\nway of neural pathways\nthat originate in the\nlower limb and extend\nto areas such as the\nkidney and the pancreas.\nSo all these quote ancient\nmaps of the human body\nas they relate to\nacupuncture, are now\nbeing parsed at the\nlevel of mechanism.\nWhich I think is\nwonderful because it\nnot only, is showing\nus that so much\nof what has been\npurported and reported\nin the landscape of\nacupuncture, actually\nhas an underlying\nmechanistic basis.\nAnd with additional mechanistic\nunderstanding of course,\nalways arrive new\nand better practices.\nThat's the idea to evolve\nthese fields of acupuncture,\nto evolve the fields of\nmechanistic understanding\nof our biology and health.\nAnd so the issue of\nwhether or not acupuncture\ncan assist in getting pregnant\nand in carrying a child to term\nand for that child\nto be healthy,\nare really starting to\nemerge in a major way.\nAnd rather than go into\nall those data in detail,\nwhat I can tell you is that\nthere are clinical trials\nand data supporting the fact\nthat female fertility itself\ncan be supported by acupuncture\nthrough several mechanisms.\nOne of which is the\nbalancing, and I\nrealize that's a\nsomewhat tricky term\nand I'll define it\nbetter in a moment.\nThe balancing of hormones across\nthe ovulatory menstrual cycle,\nincluding regulating\nlevels of FSH\nso that they're not\ntoo high nor too low\nand restricting the\nFSH to the follicular\nphase of the menstrual cycle,\nas well as using acupuncture\nto improve things\nlike blood flow\nand the health of\nthe ovary itself\nand other aspects of the\nfemale reproductive access.\nSo acupuncture can operate at\nthe chemical level impacting\nhormones.\nIt can act at the\nmechanical level impacting\nthe different tissues through\nwhich the egg has to pass,\nand so on and so forth.\nLikewise on the male\nside, acupuncture\nhas been shown to improve\nsemen volume, quality of sperm,\nsperm motility, et\ncetera, and in large part\nthrough changes in the\nneural pathways that\ninnervate the very tissues and\nvascular input to the scrotum\nand testicles because,\nas we learned earlier,\ntemperature regulation of\nthe scrotum and testicles\nis so vital for\ngetting healthy sperm\nand increasing sperm quality.\nIn addition, there are good\ndata to support the idea\nthat acupuncture can increase\nlevels of testosterone,\nfree testosterone, and\nthe sorts of hormones that\nare going to support healthy\nhormone production and sperm\nproduction in males.\nAnd this is distinct from\napplying testosterone\nfrom an exogenous source.\nso when we're talking about\nacupuncture and increasing\nlevels of testosterone, we're\ntalking about increasing levels\nof endogenous testosterone.\nSo those Leydig cells can\nsupport the Sertoli cells\nand the Sertoli cells can make\nthat androgen-binding protein\nand you get enhanced\nspermatogenesis.\nYou can find evidence for all\nof these different features\nboth changes to\nthe chemical milieu\nthat is the hormones and\nchanges to the mechanical milieu\nincluding, for instance\nimprovement of the pathways\nleading from the seminiferous\ntubules to the epididymis,\nto the vas deferens, basically\nclearing out the plumbing\nso that more quality\nejaculate can be delivered\nwhich of course, is\ngoing to increase\nthe probability\nof fertilization.\nSo when you hear\nthat acupuncture\ncan improve the\nlikelihood of pregnancy,\nthat's an accurate statement for\nwhich there are now increasing\namounts of mechanistic data.\nIf you want to learn more\nabout how acupuncture\ncan be used to contribute\nto improve fertilization\nand pregnancy,\nthere are a number\nof different excellent\nreviews on this.\nBoth as it relates to females\nand as it relates to males.\nOne of the best papers\nthat I happen to like\nis one that will\nprovide a link to\nin the references entitled\nacupuncture and herbal medicine\nfor female fertility an\noverview of systematic reviews.\nSo a review, of\nreview, of reviews\nthis was published\nrecently in 2021\nwill provide a link to that.\nAnd there's also going to\nbe a link to a review that\nrelates to acupuncture for\nmale fertility and hormone\naugmentation.\nI should just mention\nbriefly that if you're\ngoing to look at\nscientific papers,\none thing that you'll\nwant to consider\nis also looking at the\nreferences that they reference.\nAnd of course, papers tend to\nreference a ton of references\nin particular in reviews.\nSo what you want to do is\nlook for the references\nthat are showing up most\noften in the introduction.\nThose references\noften are going to be\nthe most prominent recent\nreviews or the most important\nfindings in recent years.\nThat's not always the case,\nbut that's often the case.\nIf you read the first couple\nof paragraphs of these papers\nand these are openly available\nas full text by the way online\nif you go to these\nlinks, you'll be\nable to access the best papers,\nthe most relevant papers\nin the context of\nacupuncture supporting\nfemale and acupuncture\nsupporting male fertility\nand hormone status.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
