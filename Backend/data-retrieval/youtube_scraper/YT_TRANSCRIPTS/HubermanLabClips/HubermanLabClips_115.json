    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: So any\ndiscussion about heat and sperm\nand how heat is\ndetrimental to sperm\nhas to raise this\nissue of whether or not\ncold is good for the testicle.\nWell, now there's a\nlot of data starting\nto come out about\nthe positive effects,\nthe positive biological effects\nof deliberate cold exposure\non different aspects\nof brain biology,\nsuch as the release of\ndopamine and norepinephrine,\nand on the biology of the body,\nto some extent, metabolism,\nbut more so the impact on\nbrown fat stores, which\nare good for us, so-called\nbrown fat thermogenesis.\nThere's a lot related to\ndeliberate cold exposure,\nand we've done entire episodes\non deliberate cold exposure.\nAgain, you can find\nthat at hubermanlab.com.\nWe did a guest episode with\nan expert on the use of cold\nfor health and performance,\nwith my colleague, Craig Heller,\nfrom Stanford\nDepartment of Biology.\nWe also have a toolkit on how to\napply deliberate cold exposure\nfor health, for both\nfemales and for males,\nfor sports performance,\ncognitive performance, mood,\nsleep, et cetera.\nYou can find all that, again,\nhubermanlab.com, totally zero\ncost.\nJust go into the Menu, go to\nNewsletter, and scroll down,\nand you'll find those.\nWhen thinking about\nsperm quality,\nwe want to remember that\nexcessive heat is bad.\nNow, does that mean that\ndeliberate cold is good?\nWell, it turns out that one\nof the major causes of lowered\nsperm count and overall\nreduced sperm quality that's\nquite common is the presence\nof what's called a varicocele.\nA varicocele, it's kind of like\nvaricose veins of the veins\nthat innervate the testicle.\nAnd what it\nessentially does is it\nmeans that blood will pool\nin the testicular region.\nIt can't circulate back to\nthe body quickly enough.\nAnd therefore, the temperature\nof that environment increases.\nThere are some other\nthings that varicoceles\ndo, which can be obstructive\nat the physical level,\nso they're not just\ntemperature related.\nIt's pretty clear that using\ndeliberate cold exposure\ncan be healthy for the\nsperm because of the ways\nnot that cold directly supports\ntestosterone or sperm quality,\nbut rather because\ncold reduces heat.\nSo you will find\navailable online.\nI think they're\nactually called--\nforgive me, but that's\nwhat they're called.\nI didn't name them.\nThey're called snowballs.\nThese are-- they're sort of\nlike gel pack cold briefs\nthat you can buy and men will\nwear for some period of time.\nI don't think you\nwear them all day.\nYou wear them for\nsome period of time.\nA lot of people are now using\ncold showers and ice baths\nand circulating cold baths\nor going into a cold ocean\nor lake for any number\nof different reasons\nI talked about earlier.\nI myself start every day\nwith either a 1 to 3 minute\ncold shower or a 1\nto 3 minute immersion\nup to my neck in a\ncold bath, cold water,\ncirculating water\nor a cold shower.\nI do that mainly for the\npsychological effects related\nto the long lasting increases\nin dopamine and epinephrine,\nbut there are\nother data starting\nto come out showing that,\nthat sort of approach\nor similar approaches can\nincrease testosterone levels\nand maybe even sperm\ncounts, can reduce cortisol\nlate in the evening if the\ncold exposure is done early\nin the day, so on and so forth.\nSo a lot of interesting\ndata coming out\nin really good journals that\nare peer reviewed and so on\nin humans.\nI should mention\nthose studies are\ndone in humans to\nsupport the use\nof deliberate cold exposure.\nBut again, if you're going to\nuse deliberate cold exposure\nto improve sperm\nquality, can it work?\nYes, indeed it can\nwork, either indirectly\nby increasing\ntestosterone or directly\nby improving sperm quality,\nbut both of those effects\nare likely to be\nindirect by virtue\nof reducing the\ntemperature of the testicle\noverall not because there's any\nsort of magic effect of cold\non the testicle.\nNow I have to imagine that a\nnumber of you, in particular,\nfemales listening\nto this, are going\nto say, is deliberate cold\nexposure, and for that matter,\nis deliberate heat exposure like\nsauna or a hot tub good or bad\nfor the ovary, for\neggs and for fertility?\nNow, there, there are fewer\ndata to look to, unfortunately.\nBut what we do know is that\ndeliberate cold exposure\ndone in the way that\nI just described--\n1 to 3 minutes a day.\nIdeally, early in the\nday through cold shower\nor immersion up to the neck.\nDoesn't have to be an ice bath.\nCould be cold\ncirculating water or even\nnon-circulating cold water.\nAnd people will\nsay, well, how cold?\nI should have\nmentioned that before.\nHow cold?\nThere is no way I can\ntell you exactly how\ncold the water should be\nbecause for some people\n60 degrees Fahrenheit\nwill be exceedingly cold.\nFor other people, 40 degrees is\ngoing to be more appropriate.\nHow cold should you make it?\nIf you're going to embrace\nthese practices, you want--\naccording to the literature,\nwhat you want to do\nis make it\nuncomfortably cold such\nthat you really want\nto get out, but safe.\nYou don't want to go into\n30 degree water immediately.\nYou can actually have a heart\nattack and die if you do that.\nSo you want to progress\ngradually into the cold.\nSo you don't want to shock\nyour system too much.\nAlthough, it is the\nadrenaline evoked by that ha,\nthat quickening or\nshortening or elimination\nof the breath for a\nshort period of time\nwhen you get into\nuncomfortably cold water that\ncorrelates with or is\nactually the reflection of,\nwould be more accurate\nto say, the release\nof adrenaline and then\ndopamine and so forth,\nwhich has been very\nwell documented.\nSo uncomfortably cold but safe\nto stay in, and I cannot tell\nyou an exact number that is\nuncomfortably cold but safe\nfor you.\nIt's going to differ\nperson by person.\nYou want to figure that out.\nJust like I can't tell you how\nmuch weight that you should\nsquat in order to achieve\nsome effective resistance\ntraining for the legs.\nIt's going to differ\ndepending on your strength\nand your prior\nexperience and so forth.\nSo ease into it, be safe.\nBut it does appear that\nboth for men-- for reasons\nI talked about a\nfew minutes ago--\nand for women, that deliberate\ncold exposure can be beneficial\nfor fertility and for\nhormone production\nbut in particular, for females,\nin terms of regulating cortisol\nand for hormone production.\nNow, you might say, OK,\ngetting into cold is stressful.\nHow can that be helpful\nfor regulating stress?\nWell, it turns out when\nyou get into the cold,\nyou get a big\nsurge in adrenaline\nand then dopamine, which\nis very long lasting\nprovided that's done in\nthe early part of the day.\nSo I would say not\ntoo close to sleep.\nThen what you do is you restrict\nyour maximum cortisol release\nto a period earlier in\nthe day that buffers--\nreduces that is the\nlikelihood that you\nwould have excessive\namounts of cortisol later\nin the day, which not\nonly can disrupt sleep\nbut is correlated with a number\nof other hormonal effects that\nare not good for\nus and therefore,\nnot good for fertility.\nSo here what I'm\ndescribing are positive\nyet indirect effects of\nthe cold on hormone levels\nboth in males and in females.\nSo for men, we talked about\nincreased testosterone,\nimproved sperm quality\nthat was indirect, right?\nYou're reducing the\ntemperature of the testicle\nbut it's not that cold\nitself is positively\nimpacting those things.\nDoes that make sense?\nHeat is bad.\nTherefore, reducing\ntemperature is good.\nLikewise with females.\nDeliberate cold exposure can be\ngood for the overall fertility\nprocess not because cold is good\nfor the ovary, or being cold\nis good for the ovary, or\nfor luteinizing hormone,\nor for follicle stimulating\nhormone or anything else\nlike that.\nBut rather that using deliberate\ncold exposure as a way\nto restrict stress\nin a deliberate\nway to a particular\ntime of day increases\nthe release of cortisol\nthen indirectly\nreduces the amount\nof cortisol that's\nreleased at other times\nalong the 24 hour cycle.\nOK.\nSo these are positive\nyet indirect effects.\nSo if you're a woman who really\nis interested in exploring\ndeliberate cold exposure or\nwho enjoys it or is already\ndoing it and you're\nwishing to conceive, great.\nExplore it, do it\nsafely, of course\nbut explore it and\ncontinue to do it.\nHowever, if you're somebody\nwho just hates the cold\nand doesn't want to\ngo anywhere near it,\nthere's no reason to\nthink that you absolutely\nneed it provided that\nyour stress, your sleep\nand other factors are all\nbeing carried out properly.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
