    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nNow, a topic that\nis sure to be a\nbit controversial--\nBut it really shouldn't be\nbecause the data, At least\nto me, are very clear--\nIs this issue of phone\nuse and sperm quality.\nNow, this can open up a\nwhole array of issues related\nTo things like EMFs,\nand you've got people\nOut there who have ideas about\n5G and all of this stuff.\nThat is not what this\ndiscussion is about.\nThe discussion I'm about to have\nwith you relates to the fact\nThat the electromagnetic fields\nand the heat-related effects\nOf smartphones can indeed\nhave a detrimental effect\nOn sperm quality and, yes,\nindeed, on testosterone levels\nAs well.\nI'm going to refer\nyou to a paper.\nWe will link it in the\nshow note captions.\nThe title of this paper is\n\"Effects of Mobile Phone\nUsage on Sperm Quality.\nNo time-dependent\nrelationship on usage.\nA systematic review and\nupdated meta-analysis.\"\nThis is the paper\nthat came out in 2021\nAnd talks about the fact that\nphones emit a radio Frequency\nelectromagnetic waves,\nwhich Are called RF, radio\nfrequency, EMWs,\nelectromagnetic waves,\nAt a low level between 80\nand 2,200 megahertz that\nCan be absorbed by the\nhuman body-- we know this.\nThis is not controversial-- and\nhave potential adverse effects\nOn brain, heart,\nendocrine system,\nAnd reproductive function.\nThat has been established.\nKeep in mind, there is\nbasically no controversy\nThat radio frequency waves and\nEMFs Can have a negative impact\non biological tissues.\nThe question is, how intense\nare those radiofrequency waves\nAnd EMFs, and how\ndetrimental are those\nOn those biological tissues?\nIt's a matter of degrees.\nBut there is very little\ncontroversy as to Whether\nor not they have an effect\non biological tissues.\nAnd I'm aware of absolutely\nzero data showing\nThat they can have a positive\neffect on biological tissues.\nSince what we're mainly talking\nabout now are smartphones,\nWe want to separate out the\nheat effects of smartphones\nFrom the EMFs\nrelated to the fact\nThat they are Wi-Fi\nsmartphones or they're\nUsing cellular\ntowers and Wi-Fi, one\nOr the other or a combination.\nSo there are a number of\ndifferent things in the phone\nThat could be detrimental.\nWe need to separate those out.\nWhy?\nWell, because you might have\nheard That carrying your phone\nin your pocket Can reduce your\ntestosterone levels and sperm\ncount.\nAnd guess what, that is true.\nThe data contained\nwithin this meta-analyses\nAnd other meta-analyses\nclearly point out That\nit can reduce sperm count\nand maybe testosterone levels\nSignificantly, but\ncertainly sperm count\nand motility Significantly.\nIt reduces sperm quality.\nSo should you avoid putting your\nphone in your pocket, certainly\nYour front pocket?\nI would suggest yes,\nif you are somebody\nWho is seeking to conceive.\nI'm not somebody who is going\nto stop using my smartphone.\nI don't expect anyone's going\nto stop using their smartphone.\nThe question is, should you\ncarry it in your front pocket\nIf you're a male?\nI think, to be on the\nsafe side, the answer\nIs probably avoid doing\nthat too much of the time.\nIdeally, don't do it at all.\nThen people will say, well,\nwhat if I turn off the Wi-Fi Or\nI turn off the cellular access?\nThen is it still a problem?\nWell, it's a problem due to\nthe heat-related effects.\nAnd then people say,\nwell, I don't actually\nFeel the heat of the phone.\nIt doesn't get that warm.\nBut the temperature effects\nof the phone, it turns out,\nAre enough, even under\nconditions in which people\nDon't report it to be\nuncomfortably warm, that it can\nChange the temperature\nmilieu of the testicle\nIn ways that can\ndiminish sperm quality.\nHow much and how that\nrelates to fertility\nAnd healthy\npregnancy, not clear,\nbut since we're Talking\nabout things to avoid,\nif your goal Is to have\na healthy fertilization\nand pregnancy, Well,\nthen, by all means, just\ndon't carry it In\nyour front pocket.\nThen people say, well,\nwhat about back pocket\nOr what about backpack?\nLook, it's very\nclear that avoiding\nBeing too close to the phone is\nprobably better for your sperm\nQuality than putting the phone\nvery close to your testicles\nOr anywhere else on your body.\nBut it's also the reality\nthat most people are going\nTo carry a phone nowadays.\nIt's just the reality.\nI think the current estimates--\nand it's discussed in this\nPaper-- that 90% of the human\npopulation has a smartphone--\n90%, which is incredible-- the\nadult population, of course.\nAlthough a lot of kids\nhave them, as well.\nSo this paper goes on to detail\na number of different studies\nAnd outcomes from studies.\nBut basically what they find--\nand here I'm paraphrasing--\nIs that the data indicate\nthat sperm quality declines\nWhen people start\nusing a mobile phone.\nSo from the point they\nstart using a mobile phone,\nRegardless of the usage\ntime-- this is important.\nIt used to be thought that\nit was four hours a day\nor more Of holding your\nphone or having that phone\nclose to your body Was going\nto diminish sperm quality.\nIt turns out that it's\nnot related to usage time.\nThat's even the\ntitle of the paper.\nIt's just the fact\nthat people are\nUsing mobile phones is reducing\nsperm count and quality.\nThat's the reality.\nIs it entirely responsible\nfor all the reductions\nin sperm Quality and\nmaybe even the reductions\nIn testosterone\nlevels that we're\nobserving from decade\nTo decade going forward?\nI doubt that's the case.\nIs it likely to be one\nof the major players?\nI've got my bet on the fact\nthat it is based on the data\nThat I've observed.\nAnd so if any of you\nwould like to peruse\nThe data in this meta-analysis,\nthey're quite good.\nThis study looked at 18 studies\nthat include 4,280 samples.\nThey were able to\nseparate out the radio\nFrequency versus\nthe heat effects,\nAnd they were able to eliminate\nthis time of usage variable,\nThat previously we thought\nif you were exposed\nTo a lot of cell\nphone contact, then\nIt was far worse than if you\nwere exposed to a little bit.\nTurns out, if you're\nexposed to any at all,\nYou're going to\ndiminish sperm quality.\nWhat does that mean?\nDoes that mean\nthat no matter what\nYou do, if you own a\nsmartphone, that you're going\nTo diminish sperm quality?\nI think the short answer is yes,\nbut that you can mitigate it.\nWhat might you do?\nWell, keeping your phone away\nfrom your groin or as far\nFrom your groin as\npossible if you're\nA male who's wishing to\nconceive and maybe even a male\nWho's wishing to maximize his\ntestosterone levels because it\nDoes appear that radiofrequency\nwaves and the heat\nFrom the phone--\nSo both of those factors,\nindependently and together,\nOf course--\nCan disrupt the Leydig\ncells of the testes\nAnd the production\nof testosterone,\nAnd intratesticular\ntestosterone is\nImportant for sperm production.\nThe exact biological variables\nleading to all of these changes\nIsn't exactly clear.\nBut if you're like\nme, you say, OK,\nProbably not a problem for most\nmales to carry their phone.\nBut probably best to not\ncarry it in the front pocket.\nMaybe even avoid carrying it\nin the back pocket as well.\nAgain, in the future, we\nwill have an episode All\nabout Bluetooth.\nWe'll talk about\nvarious aspects of EMFs.\nIt's a super\ninteresting data set.\nAnd it's a data set for which\nthere's a ton of controversy.\nIt's really\ninteresting, however,\nAnd there are more and more\nquality data coming out\nAll the time.\nAnd I think, going\nforward, we are\nGoing to see that, indeed,\nthere are some negative effects\nOf smartphones related to\nboth the radio frequency\nTransmission and the fact\nthat they generate heat.\nAnd in general, heat is not\ngood for biological tissues.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
