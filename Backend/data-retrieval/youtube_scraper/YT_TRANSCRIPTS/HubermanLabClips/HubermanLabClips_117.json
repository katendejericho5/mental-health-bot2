    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: I \nthink a lot of people\naren't aware of\njust how striking\nan effect these\ncertain behaviors\nthat you want to avoid can have\nin diminishing your fertility\nfor both males and females.\nSo let's talk about those.\nThe first one is smoking.\nAnd when we talk\nabout smoking here,\nwe're talking about\nsmoking nicotine\nand we're talking\nabout smoking cannabis.\nAnd indeed, there\nare strong data--\nand I will put a\nreference to one\nof the better larger\nanalyses of these data.\nThere are strong data\nshowing that cannabis\nreduces fertility.\nNow, I can already hear\nthe screams from the back,\nalthough they're probably\nfairly drawled out screams,\nfrom the back of people\nsaying they smoke cannabis\nand they had no\ntrouble conceiving.\nCertainly, there\nwill be exceptions.\nBut whether or not\nyou're male or female,\nsmoking cannabis is a\nbad idea if you want\nto conceive a healthy child.\nCan you still conceive a healthy\nchild while smoking cannabis?\nProbably certain people can.\nMany people will greatly\ndecrease the probability\nof a healthy fertilization and\npregnancy by smoking cannabis.\nThere are excellent\ndata to support that.\nAs well, nicotine,\nboth smoked or vaped,\nis going to disrupt the\nprocess of fertilization\nand can disrupt\npregnancy dramatically.\nSo just avoid it altogether.\nHow does this happen?\nWell, it turns out that smoking\nincreases what are called\nreactive oxygen species.\nThis greatly\ndisrupts the quality\nof the egg at the level of\nthe spindle and mitochondria\nand a number of other features.\nAnd in the sperm, turns out\nthat smoking doesn't necessarily\ndisrupt the sperm\ndirectly, although it\ncan cause DNA\nfragmentation, which\ncan cause all sorts\nof abnormalities,\ncan prevent fertilization,\ncan lead to birth defects\nin the offspring.\nBut more importantly,\nit increases\nwhat are called reactive oxygen\nspecies in the seminal fluid,\nin the semen that\ncontain the sperm,\nthis very, under\nnormal circumstances,\nunder healthy\ncircumstances, beautifully\norchestrated chemistry of\nfluid that allows the sperm\nto thrive in their\ntrajectory and attempt\nto fertilize the egg and\nlead to a healthy pregnancy.\nSo if you are a smoker\nand you want to conceive,\nthe best advice I can give\nyou is to quit smoking.\nAnd yes, that includes\ncannabis as well.\nNow, I am not somebody\nwho believes that cannabis\nacross the board is not useful.\nThere are medical applications\nand other applications.\nI talk about that in an\nepisode all about cannabis\nfor health and disease.\nAnd notice, health\nwas in there too.\nSo you cannabis smokers,\ndon't come after me with--\nI guess, whatever it\nis-- with bongs and pipes\nor whatever it is that\nyou want-- or with vapes.\nThe point is that,\nwhile it can be\nbeneficial for\ncertain populations,\nit's certainly bad for others.\nAnd if you're\ntrying to conceive,\nit is bad for fertility and\nfor a healthy pregnancy.\nNow, that's smoking--\nand vaping, by the way.\nVaping is included there.\nNow, the next category of\ndon'ts relates to alcohol.\nNow, everyone has heard that\ndrinking during pregnancy\nis a bad idea.\nYou may have heard\nand some people\nhave talked about\nthe fact that there\nare cultures in\nwhich they allow,\nif you will, or\neven condone, sadly,\none or two drinks\nwhile pregnant,\nprovided it's just champagne\nor something of that sort.\nThat is a terrible idea.\nI did an episode\nall about alcohol,\nboth its potential\nhealth effects,\nof which there turned\nout to be zero.\nAnd yes, that includes red wine.\nIt is far better to\nnot drink at all.\nAnd if you're going\nto drink, the limit--\nif you're a healthy\nadult who's not\ntrying to conceive,\nnot pregnant,\nand you don't have\nissues with alcoholism--\nis probably two\ndrinks per week total.\nThat's right, two\ndrinks per week total.\nAnd that's the level\nthat you really\nshould consider if you're a\ndrinker if you're somebody\nwho's trying to conceive.\nHowever, for a woman\nwho becomes pregnant,\nthe total number of drinks\nthat you should allow yourself\nper week while pregnant and\nbreastfeeding is indeed zero.\nThere is absolutely no evidence\nthat one can, quote, unquote,\n\"get away\" with drinking\nduring pregnancy.\nAnd people say, well, I had\na perfectly healthy child.\nBut, of course, you don't know\nwhat the health of that child\nwould have been had\nyou not drank at all.\nNow, I'm not here with any\ngenerally strong stance\nagainst alcohol.\nI myself am somebody who\nhas a drink every once\nin a while, although I\ndon't consider myself\nsomebody who has a strong\nproclivity for alcohol.\nAnd of course, at\nthis moment, I'm\nnot trying to conceive children\nand I'm certainly not pregnant.\nSo that's safe for me.\nBut frankly, I haven't had\na drink in a very long time.\nAnd so I don't miss it.\nAnd that's me.\nBut I do realize that a lot\nof people enjoy alcohol,\nand so it's that\ntwo drinks per week\nlimit that really\nsets the upper limit\nand threshold beyond which\nyou start running into issues\nwith cellular mutation.\nYou start running into issues\nof oxidative stress, greatly\nincrease cancer risk, in\nparticular breast cancer risk.\nAll of that's covered in the\nalcohol episode that we did.\nYou can find it\nat hubermanlab.com\nand timestamped if you want\nto navigate to specific topics\nand so forth, find out all\nabout the data supporting\nthe statements that I'm\nmaking, so on and so forth.\nNow, if you're\nsomebody who's seeking\nto conceive or you\nfall into this category\nthat some couples describe\nthemselves as we're not trying\nbut we're not not trying--\nmeaning they're not using birth\ncontrol, they're kind of letting\nchance run its course-- well,\nthen you should definitely\nbe aware of the data showing\nthat even just one bout,\none bout of so-called binge\ndrinking, which is five to six\ndrinks in a given night or half\nday, in a 12-hour period-- one\nbout of five to six drinks,\nif you're a woman\nor you're a man,\ngreatly increases\nboth the likelihood\nof mutations in the\nembryo that would\nresult from a fertilization\nand at the same time,\nfor reasons that should\nbe obvious to you\nbased on all the biology\nwe've talked about,\na greatly reduced\nprobability of fertilization.\nNow, that absolutely\ndoes not mean\nthat you should use the\ningestion of five or six drinks\nas a method of birth control.\nThat is not what\nI'm saying here.\nWhat I'm saying is that, if\nyou go out on a given night\nand you have five or six\ndrinks and you happen\nto become pregnant,\nthe probability\nthat that pregnancy will\nbe disrupted in some way\nis greatly increased.\nWhat the exact consequences\nare, no one can tell you.\nBut also, if you're somebody\nwho is interested in conceiving\na child, well,\nthen you absolutely\nshould abstain from ingesting\ndrinks more than one or two\nduring the time in which\nyou're trying to conceive,\nand ideally it would be zero.\nAnd you certainly would\nwant to avoid drinking\nmultiple drinks per night.\nAnd so this idea of going out\nand having three or four drinks\nor four or five\ndrinks in a given\nnight at a time in\nwhich you're also\ntrying to conceive children,\nthe biology tells us,\nthe epidemiology tells us that\nthis is just a terrible idea.\nIt's going to reduce the\nlikelihood of fertility\nand successful pregnancy.\nAnd if there is a\nsuccessful pregnancy,\nthe word \"success\" needs\nto be in quotes, right?\nI mean, I think every\nparent-- every species,\nfor that matter-- wants to\nincrease the probability\nof having healthy offspring.\nAnd so, to my mind anyway and to\nthe OB/GYNs and the urologists\nthat are focused on\nfertility that I spoke to,\neveryone will say,\ntry as hard as you\ncan to avoid these so-called\nbinge drinking episodes.\nAnd again, these\nepisodes are one night\nof consuming five to six drinks.\nNow, another important thing\nto remember in this context\nis that the negative effects\nof consuming five or six drinks\nin a given night extend\nover many weeks following\nthe ingestion of that alcohol.\nIf you're a male,\nwhat that means\nis that's going to impact\nthe quality of your sperm\nand greatly decrease\nthe likelihood\nof successful fertilization\nand/or healthy pregnancy\nover the period of that entire\nspermatogenesis window, which\nis, as we talked about before,\n60 to 90 days, 60 to generate\nthe sperm and then some\nadditional time for the sperm\nto be transported to the point\nwhere they could be ejaculated.\nIf you're a woman and you have\nfive or six drinks on a given\nnight, well, then you are going\nto disrupt the quality not\nof just the egg that\neventually ovulates\nbut indeed the entire\npool of follicles that\nleaves the ovarian\nvault in reserve\nand from which the one\negg will be selected.\nIn other words, you are reducing\nthe quality of all of the eggs\nthat you happen to\ndeploy that month.\nNow, some of you who were really\nfollowing the biology earlier\nmight say, well, what if\nI have those five or six\ndrinks during the time in which\nI'm menstruating, just in which\nthere's bleeding present?\nAnd therefore, I\nhaven't yet ovulated.\nAh!\nBut if you remember the\nbiology we talked about earlier\nspecifically, there is a\nsubset of follicles and eggs\nthat leave that ovarian reserve\nquite a bit before that one egg\nis selected for and ovulates.\nAnd of course, there are all\nthe different hormonal cascades\nand the general milieu\nof the ovary which\nare important and\nare being regulated\nby different hormones.\nAnd yes, indeed, the\nregulation of those hormones\nis strongly impacted by\nalcohol through a number\nof different pathways,\nthrough the regulation\nof the neurotransmitter GABA\nup in the brain-- it's actually\na lot of GABA and GABA\nreceptors in the hypothalamus,\nthe very region from which\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone,\nour old friend\nfrom a couple hours\nago in this discussion, going\nto disrupt GnRH secretion.\nYou can disrupt pituitary\nfunction with alcohol.\nAgain and again,\nwhat we're seeing\nis that consuming more than\none or two drinks per week\nof alcohol is really detrimental\nto the entire process\nof fertility and the entire\nprocess of healthy pregnancy.\nAnd that's true from both\nthe male side and the sperm,\nand it's true from the\nfemale side and the egg.\nSo my simple advice\non this is if you\nare wishing to have a healthy\nfertilization and pregnancy,\nthe best thing to do would\nbe avoid alcohol altogether\nand, if you are going to\ndrink, to really limit\nthat drinking to one or two\ndrinks per week maximum.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
