    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to this\n20-minute non-sleep deep rest\nprotocol.\nNon-sleep deep rest\nis a powerful tool\nthat can allow you to\ncontrol the relaxation\nstate of your nervous system\nand your overall state of mind.\nIt can restore mental\nand physical vigor,\nand it can be done any\ntime of day or night.\nIt can even partially offset\nthe negative consequences\nof getting too little sleep.\nNon-sleep deep rest takes\nadvantage of the fact\nthat specific forms\nof breathing place us\ninto a state of deep relaxation\nby slowing our heart rate down.\nIt also takes\nadvantage of the fact\nthat we can control\nour perception--\nthat is, which sensations\nwe are focused on.\nSensations are\nsimply the conversion\nof physical events in\nthe world into a language\nthat our body and\nbrain can understand.\nIt's a process by which\nthings like photons\nof light, mechanical\npressure on our skin,\nsound waves, and so\non, are converted\nto electrical and\nchemical signals\nin our neurons, or nerve cells.\nPerception is simply\nthe sensations\nthat we happen to be focused\non at a given moment.\nAnd perception is an incredible\naspect of our nervous system.\nWe can't directly control\nwhat sensations are around us\nand inside of us,\nthey are just there.\nBut we can control our\ntwo kinds of perceptions.\nOne kind of perception\nis called exteroception,\nand is when we pay attention\nto things around us\nbeyond the confines of our skin.\nThe other type of perception\nis called interoception,\nand it's when we pay\nattention to things\nat the level of the\nsurface of our skin\nand inward, inside our body.\nWith non-sleep deep rest, you\ncan shift your brain state\nfrom one of thinking, stress,\nplanning, from anticipation\nof any kind, positive\nor negative, to one\nof pure sensation\nand deep relaxation.\nIt's very simple to do.\nYou'll want to do this\nprotocol seated or lying down.\nSo if you're not already seated\nor lying down, please do so now.\nYou'll also want\nto close your eyes.\nSo if your eyes aren't already\nclosed, please close them now.\nThroughout this\nprotocol you'll want\nto breathe normally, unless\ninstructed to do otherwise.\nOne pattern of breathing\nyou'll be asked to do\nis to Inhale deeply,\nideally through your nose.\nBut if you can't do\nit through your nose,\ninhale through your mouth.\nTry that now.\nInhale deeply through your nose,\nand then exhale all of your air\nthrough your mouth.\nLet's do that again.\nInhale deeply through your\nnose and then exhale completely\nthrough your mouth.\nAnd as you exhale, exhale\nthrough thinly pursed lips\nas if through a small straw.\nLet's repeat that\ntwo more times.\nInhale deeply through\nyour nose, and then\nexhale completely through\nthinly pursed lips.\nOne more time.\nInhale deeply through\nyour nose, and then\nexhale completely\nthrough your mouth\nthrough thinly pursed lips.\nBreathing in that way,\nthat is, inhaling deeply\nthrough your nose and\nthen exhaling completely\nthrough the mouth through\nthinly pursed lips,\nis known to slow your\nheart rate down and relax\nyour nervous system.\nFeel free now to simply\nbreathe normally.\nNow, in your mind's\neye, imagine yourself\nstanding over yourself, looking\nat your body which is seated\nor lying down, and\nimagine holding\na flashlight or a spotlight\nand directing it at your feet.\nFocus your attention on whatever\nit is that your feet happen\nto be in contact with.\nIt could be socks, sandals,\nshoes, or merely the air.\nIt doesn't matter.\nFocus your attention\nspecifically\non the bottoms of\nyour feet, and try\nto perceive whatever\nit is they are sensing.\nThey could be tingling.\nThey could even be numb.\nIt doesn't matter.\nNow imagine expanding\nthat spotlight\nto include the tops of your\nfeet, your shins, your calves.\nExpanding that spotlight\nfurther to include\nyour thighs, your hamstrings,\nand up to your waist.\nNow, with your entire\nlower body illuminated\ninside the beam of light\nfrom that spotlight,\ninhale deeply through your\nnose or through your mouth.\nAnd then exhale completely\nthrough thinly pursed lips\nuntil your lungs are empty.\nRepeat that twice more, and\neach time as you exhale,\nimagine your lower body\nsinking down about a centimeter\ninto whatever surface you happen\nto be in contact with now.\nNow continue by\nbreathing normally.\nInhale deeply.\nAnd as you exhale,\nimagine your body\nsinking another centimeter\ninto the surface\nyou are lying or\nsitting down on.\nAs you inhale, remember to\nhave your belly expand ever so\nslightly.\nAnd as you exhale, your stomach\nwill fall ever so slightly.\nAs you breathe in\nthis manner, continue\nto imagine the spotlight\nilluminating your entire body.\nAs you Inhale, you can\nimagine that spotlight\ngetting slightly brighter.\nAnd as you exhale,\nimagine the spotlight\ngetting slightly dimmer.\nContinue to inhale and to\nexhale while imagining your body\nsinking down.\nNow pay attention to the\nmuscles of your face.\nAnd as you continue\nto breathe normally,\ntry to relax the\nmuscles of your face--\nat first only slightly.\nAnd then with each\nsubsequent breath,\nrelaxing the muscles of your\nforehead and face more and more.\nNow, regardless of the\nenvironment you're in,\ntry to listen to sounds\nwithin that environment.\nWhatever happens to be\nsurrounding you, try to hear it.\nPerhaps you can only hear the\nsound of your own breathing.\nPerhaps there are\nnoises in the room.\nRegardless of the sounds you\nhear, tried to focus on them.\nNow you will breathe in the\nsame manner you breathed before,\nwith a deep inhale through your\nnose until your lungs are full.\nAnd then a slow, complete exhale\nthrough slightly pursed lips.\nLet's repeat that again.\nInhale through your nose\nuntil your lungs are full.\nThen exhale slowly through your\nmouth with slightly pursed lips.\nNow, in your mind's eye, try\nto imagine your body again\nilluminated by a spotlight.\nImagine looking\ndown at yourself,\nand your entire body is\nilluminated by that spotlight.\nDim that spotlight in\nyour mind by about 50%.\nAnd as you do so, deliberately\nrelax the muscles of your legs.\nThen deliberately relax\nthe muscles of your hands,\nsensing your palms,\nwrists, and fingers.\nContinue to breathe normally.\nAnd in your mind's eye,\ndim the spotlight 50%\nfurther still so that the image\nof your body in your mind's eye\nis barely a silhouette.\nNow, in your mind's eye,\nmake the spotlight brighter.\nTry to see any portion of\nyour body in your mind's eye--\nyour hands, your arms,\nyour torso, your feet.\nNo matter if you see one or all\nof these parts, try to see them\nas if you are staring\ndown at yourself.\nNow move the spotlight\nto your abdomen\nand focus your\nattention on whatever\nit is your abdomen is sensing.\nAs you inhale, your stomach\nshould move out slightly.\nAnd as you exhale,\nit should sink down.\nExpand the spotlight to\ninclude your upper abdomen,\nyour chest, your neck.\nAnd now in your\nmind's eye, imagine\nthat spotlight is expanding\nto include your arms as well.\nContinue to breathe normally.\nNow focus your\nperception on whatever\nsurface your back happens\nto be in contact with--\na shirt, a chair, a sofa.\nWhatever surface it\nhappens to be contacting,\nfocus on that contact now.\nSimply bring your attention\nand your perception\nto those points of contact.\nAnd as you do so, inhale\ndeeply again through your nose\nor through your mouth.\nAnd then as you exhale, imagine\nyour back and your upper body\nsinking about a centimeter\ninto whatever surface\nthey happen to be\nin contact with.\nNow move the spotlight\nto include your face,\nthe top of your head, and\nthe back of your head.\nAnd as you continue\nto breathe normally,\nfocus your perception\non relaxing\nthe muscles of your face.\nAnd as you continue\nto breathe normally,\nsee if you can extend the\nduration of your exhales\never so slightly.\nAnd now in your mind's eye,\nexpand the spotlight downward\nto include your neck, your\nchest, your arms, your abdomen,\nyour waist, your legs,\nand down to your feet.\nImagine yourself looking down\nat your own body, illuminated\ninside of the spotlight.\nAnd in your mind's eye,\ndeliberately dim that spotlight.\nMake the illumination\nless intense.\nInhale deeply again through\nyour nose or through your mouth.\nAnd then exhale completely\nthrough thinly pursed lips.\nAnd as you do so,\nimagine your entire body\nsinking into the surface\nit's in contact with.\nNow, while continuing\nto breathe normally,\nmove your toes ever so slightly.\nYou'll notice that you are in\ncontrol of your nervous system.\nYou can direct your\nperceptions and your actions.\nIn doing so, you'll\nnotice that you\nare in control of\nyour nervous system,\nmeaning you direct your\nperceptions and your actions.\nMove your ankles and bend your\nknees just the slightest bit.\nYou can move your upper\nbody from side to side,\nyour head from side to side,\nor even nod just slightly.\nNow move your hands.\nLift your arms just a tiny\nbit, then set them down again.\nAnd now, whenever you are\nready, slowly open your eyes.\nAnd as you do so, you'll\nnotice that normally\nyour nervous system is bombarded\nwith sensory information, mostly\nvisual information,\nwhich you have\neliminated during this\nnon-sleep deep rest protocol.\nAs you have now\nexperienced, you are\nin control of your perceptions.\nControlling your perceptions is\nsimply directing your attention\nto specific sensations,\nand you control\nwhich sensations you\nperceive by directing\nyour attentional\nspotlight to whatever part\nor parts of your\nbody that you choose.\nThis reflects the remarkable\npower of the human brain.\nYou can direct your\nactions, your perceptions,\nand you can do so in order to\nbring about deep relaxation.\nYou can also do that to achieve\nheightened states of alertness\nor attention to any sensation\noutside of you, or within you.\nNon-sleep deep rest\nprotocols such as this one\ncan help you restore your sense\nof mental and physical vigor,\ncan partially offset the effects\nof not getting enough sleep,\nand can also help you get better\nat falling and staying asleep.\nIt can be done any\ntime of day or night\nwhen you feel you need a\nmental and/or physical reset.\nThank you for joining me\nfor this non-sleep deep rest\nprotocol brought to you\nby Huberman Lab and AG1."
