    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, let's\ntalk about hypertrophy.\nThe topic that\noccupies the minds\nof so many youth, young men,\nbut also a lot of women.\nI think one of the really\ninteresting progressions that's\ntaken place in the\nlast decade or so\nis that far more men and women\nare using resistance training\nin order to evoke hypertrophy,\ngrowth of muscles,\nfor aesthetic reasons and\nfor all sorts of reasons.\nWhat are the ways that people\ncan induce hypertrophy?\nANDY GALPIN: So not to correct\nyou or insult you, but probably\na better way to think about\nthat question is really,\nwhat stimuli do I need\nto give the muscle\nto induce hypertrophy?\nNow there are hormonal\nfactors that are important.\nThere are nutritional factors.\nBut just to stick with\nthe context of training.\nThis is really going to\nframe a lot of our answers.\nAnd as you'll see, it's\none of the reasons why\nI call hypertrophy training\nkind of idiot proof,\nin terms of programming.\nNow the work is hard,\ndifficult, and all that,\nbut the precision needed\nis a lot less than what\nwe saw in power and strength.\nAnd so if you know-- it's\nvery important that you do it\nin this style, with this intent,\nand within these parameters,\nand if you're outside\nthe parameters,\nit's not going to be it.\nHypertrophy has a\nvery broad range,\nin terms of your\nactual applications.\nAnd this is why\nyou have, and will\ncontinue to see, countless\nstyles of training\nthat all work.\nI mean, I know you were\nmentored earlier in life\nby one of my favorite people\nin this entire field, Mike\nMentzer.\nJust an absolute character.\nHis style was completely\ndifferent than what\nyou would see in\na classic textbook\nor any number of different\ninfluencers or coaches\nor individuals.\nAnd if you've ever thought\nto yourself like, why is it\nall these programs work?\nAnd people love\nto jump to things\nlike, well, it's the steroids.\nJust get that out of\nthe equation for now.\nIndependent of that, that's\nnot even part of the equation,\nyou're still going\nto see results.\nAnd the question is why?\nWell, that's because\nwhat's driving\nchanges in strength\nand power are\nthe adaptations of specificity.\nWhat's driving\nchanges in hypertrophy\nis much more well rounded.\nAnd so you have\noptions to get there.\nRemember, you're\ntraining a movement\nand now you're training a\nresponse and a muscle that\ncause the growth.\nThat's very, very different.\nSo if we look at\nthe classic dogma,\nwe have to basically\nchallenge the muscle\nto need to come back, in this\ncase, specifically bigger.\nAnd the nutrients need to be\nthere to support that growth.\nGet the nutrients\naside, perhaps we\ncan come in a few more\nminutes and talk about that.\nSo all we really have\nto do is, going back\nto our dogma of activation of\nsomething on the cell wall,\nwe've talked about this earlier.\nThat's got to induce\nthat signaling cascade.\nThat's got to be strong\nenough to cause the nucleus\nto react to it, to\ngo to the ribosomes,\nto initiate this entire\ncascade of protein synthesis.\nOK.\nSo that signal has to be\none of a couple of things.\nIt either has to be\nstrong enough one time,\nit has to be frequent\nenough, or it\nhas to be a combination\nof these things.\nAll right, so I can get\nthere with a lot of frequency\nand a moderate signal.\nI can get there with very low\nfrequency and a large signal,\nlike more akin to what you\ndo with Mike back in the day,\nI'm sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nstill train that way.\nANDY GALPIN: Still\ntraining that way.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Each muscle\ngroup mainly once a week,\ndirectly, and once\na week indirectly.\nANDY GALPIN: So all\nyou can-- all you\nhave to do there to\nnot fail is to make\nsure the training is hard\nenough, and it's going to work.\nIf you choose the\nfrequency path,\nthen you actually have\nto make sure you're not\ntraining too hard to\nwhere you can actually\nmaintain the frequency.\nThe only wrong combination here\nis infrequent and low intensity\nand low volume.\nThat's it.\nAs long as one of those\nthree variables is high,\nyou're going to get there.\nBecause the mechanisms\nthat are needed\nto activate that signaling\ncascade are wide ranging.\nAnd this is why when we even\nsee things like blood flow\nrestriction training, this\nis when you put like a cuff\non your arm or your leg\nand you block blood flow\nand you use no load or as low\nas, say, 30% of your maximum\nand, you take it\nto fatigue failure,\nthat actually is an equally\neffective way of inducing\nhypertrophy.\nDespite the fact\nthat you're using 3,\n4, 10, maybe at most, 20\nto 30% of your 100 max.\nWhy?\nBecause you went through the\nroute of metabolic disturbance.\nOther ways, say, a higher\nload, maybe as heavy as you can\nfor, say, eight\nrepetitions, is going\nto get through what's\ncalled mechanical tension.\nAnd so there's these\ndifferent paths\nthat we can get\nto the same spot.\nNow eventually, these things\nhave a saturation point.\nSo you don't need all\nthree of these mechanisms,\nthe third one, of course, being\nmuscle damage or breakdown.\nAnd I know we want to chat\na little bit about that,\nbut none of these three\nare absolutely required.\nYou can have multiple\nof them in a session.\nYou don't have to\nhave breakdown at all.\nThat is a complete--\nwell, really,\nit's a flat out lie that you\nhave to break a muscle down\nto cause it to grow.\nThat's just not needed at all.\nYou have to have one of\nthese three things though.\nAnd so again, this\nallows you a lot\nof flexibility, which is why\ncrafting your program which\nis best for you is\nactually fairly simple when\nit comes to hypertrophy.\nYou just have to make\nsure you do the work.\nAnd you want to make sure you\nhave a few standards in place\nwith the exercise choice\nand some other things\nthat we'll hit in just a second.\nBut that's really\nthe fundamental way\nof getting to it, making\nsure either that signal\nis loud enough or\nfrequent enough\nto give nuclei a\nconvincing enough reason\nto spend the resources.\nBecause you have to\nremember two things.\nIn order to grow\nnew skeletal muscle,\nyou need amino acids,\nwhich are your supply.\nAnd then you need,\nprimarily, carbohydrates\nas the energy source to\npower that synthesis process.\nIf you remember\nbasic chemistry, that\nsays if you're going\nto take two atoms\nand you're going to pull them\napart or put them together,\nright, that's going\nto take energy.\nTypically, and most of,\nactually, metabolism,\nwhen you split a\nbond, you're going\nto get-- it's called\nexergonic-- you're\ngoing to get energy from that.\nBut when you put them together,\nthat's going to take energy.\nThis is why we call that\nprotein synthesis, right?\nSo you have to\nconvince your nucleus\nthat, one, invest those\nresources in energy, primarily\ncarbohydrate.\nBut number two, and\nmore importantly,\ninvest that supply.\nThere is a ton of possible\nways to get energy,\nbut there's a very low amount\nof amino acids available.\nAnd you need them\nfor many more things\nthan just taking your biceps\nfrom 17 inches to 18 inches,\nright?\nIt's not going to\ndo that if you're\nin a position where,\nagain, you can't sustain\nimmune function, if red\nblood cell turnover needs\nto be higher, or any of\nthe other main-- like tons\nof things that you\nneed proteins for.\nSo you have to be able\nto say, are you sure?\nYou really want to\nspend these resources\nand build it into\nmuscle, because once\nwe do that it's very\ndifficult to go backwards,\nbreak them back down, and\nbring the amino acids back\ninto that availability\npool so we can use them\nfor either another function\nentirely or even another muscle\ngroup.\nThat's called protein\nredistribution,\nby the way, when\nyou say-- maybe you\ndon't do a lot of upper body\nwork and you're training\nand you're not eating enough\nprotein or a minimal amount\nand you're doing a lot\nof lifting in your legs,\nyou'll notice your\nlegs will get larger.\nBut that's, actually,\na lot of times\nyou're pulling the\nprotein from, say,\nyour upper body in this case\nand redistributing it back down\nto the quads.\nSo that's the way-- that's\nwhat you have to get to.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
