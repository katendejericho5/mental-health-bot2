    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd\nlike to talk a little bit\nabout nutrition\nand supplementation\nas it relates to hypertrophy.\nDr. Layne Norton, who's been\na guest on the Huberman Lab\npodcast, and we both know.\nThroughout a number of range\nrelated to protein intake\non the backdrop of how much\nprotein synthesis can occur\nby meal across the day, et\ncetera, a lot of research\ndone there and some important\nwork by him in particular.\nAnd then the value\nthat he threw out\nwas 1.6 grams per\nkilogram of body weight\nbeing the lower end\nof the range, up to,\nI believe it was\nas high as 2.4--\nmaybe even as high as 2.7--\ngrams of protein per kilogram\nof body weight per day.\nThat's a pretty\nbroad range, but it's\non the higher end of what\nI think most people think\nof in terms of protein intake.\nAnd then again, some\npeople might already\nbe right there, or maybe\neven above that value.\nNow, of course,\nthis all depends on\nwhether or not people are\nomnivore, vegan, meat-based, et\ncetera.\nWe won't even go there.\nBut assuming people are\ngetting enough protein per day,\nso somewhere in that range,\nand they are spreading out that\nprotein intake to accommodate\nthe fact that the body can only\nassimilate a certain amount of\nprotein in any given setting,\nwhat do you like to see\npeople ingest, at some point,\npost-hypertrophy-inducing\nworkout in order to get\nthe protein synthesis\nadvantage, if you will--\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --that is\nstimulated by that workout?\nEarlier you mentioned the\npost-training feeding window,\nthat in the 90's and\nprobably earlier,\npeople were talking about, oh,\nwithin the first 90 minutes you\nhave to get--\nANDY GALPIN: It was 30\nminutes for a while, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --X amount of--\nOh, wow.\nOh, was it?\n30 minutes of-- excuse\nme, a certain number\nof grams of carbohydrate\nand protein, et cetera.\nI think now the understanding\nis that window is much broader.\nAnd how broad, et cetera,\nis still a matter of debate.\nBut when somebody is training\nspecifically for hypertrophy,\nassuming they are\ngetting enough protein\nfrom quality sources\nin their other meals\nand assuming that their\noverall macronutrient\nintake and caloric\nintake is high enough--\nthat is they have enough\nof a caloric surplus\nthat they have the raw\nmaterials for hypertrophy--\nwhat do you like to\nsee people ingest,\nat some point,\npost-workout, in order\nto facilitate muscle protein\nsynthesis and recovery?\nAnd this could include\nnutrition and supplementation.\nOr if you want to divide\nthose answers out,\nfeel free to do so, of course.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nOK, great.\nSo ton of work came out\nof Don Lehman's lab--\nIt was actually Layne's\nmentor, as well as\nStu Phillips at McMaster.\nSo a ton of work there.\nAnd we can answer a\nnumber of things here.\nSo Layne's numbers\nthat he recommended,\nalso known as about\na gram of protein\nper pound of body weight.\nIt's a great start.\nNow once you slide below--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's\nper pound, right?\nANDY GALPIN: 1 gram per pound.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nRight, and earlier--\nANDY GALPIN: Which is also--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Just to\nmake sure, because we're\nchanging units here.\nIt was 1.6 grams per kilogram of\nbody weight, all the way up to,\nI think it was 2.4, but maybe\nas high as 2.7 grams of protein\nper kilogram of body weight.\nANDY GALPIN: So 2.2 in that\nunit would be the same thing.\nSo 2.2 grams per kilogram is\nthe same as 1 gram per pound.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nANDY GALPIN: So\ndepending on which--\nwhere you're listening at,\nto this at, one of those\nmay be easier than\nthe other for you.\nIf you start getting\nbelow that number now\nyou do start running\ninto questions\nof protein quality, protein\ntype, and protein timing.\nAnd this is one of the reasons\nwhy I actually fully agree\nwith Layne, is just get that\nnumber higher than you think,\nAnd then all those other\nvariables don't matter.\nIf that number is\nlow, then you need\nto start paying attention\nto a bunch of other stuff.\nYou've added now complexity\nto your program, things\nyou've got to pay attention to.\nJust stay high and\nit doesn't matter.\nAnd so you can just leave a lot\nof those things off the table.\nThat seems to be fairly\nclear in the work of some\nof those gentlemen\nI just mentioned.\nThat as long as you get to\nthat total number, the question\nabout timing and\ntypes and quality,\nit seems to matter a lot less.\nIn fact, Stu's recent work\nin non-animal based proteins\nreally showed that, to be\nfairly clear, that those\nare quite effective,\nassuming total protein intake\nis high enough.\nThe amount of leucine\nand other amino acids\nin those actual\nproteins matter less\nif the total threshold\nis just super high.\nSo just do that and you're fine.\nNow the other caveat\nwe have to say here\nis, timing of\nmacronutrients seems\nto be somewhat\nirrelevant for protein\nbut that is not the\ncase for carbohydrates.\nSo that timing does matter\nreplenishment of muscle\nglycogen is very specific.\nAnd you want to make sure\nthat is around a lot,\nif you're doing either\nmaintaining training quality\nor you're sliding into\nendurance type of work.\nAnd so nutrient timing does\nmatter with carbohydrates.\nMaybe less so with protein--\nand certainly less so\nwith protein, if the\ntotal protein ingestion\nis high enough.\nSo it depends on what\nwe're going after in terms\nof a training goal\nand where we want\nto get with all these things.\nIn general, the way that\nwe like to think about this\nis if you're doing a strength\ntype of work, where you're\ntruly targeting that,\nthen a one to one\npost-exercise protein\nto carbohydrate ratio\nis generally what we're\ngoing to go after.\nSo this would be something\nlike 35 grams of protein\nand 35 grams of carbohydrate.\nIt doesn't have to be post.\nIt can be pre, or my\nfavorite is actually mid.\nOr post.\nBut somewhere in that\nrange, especially\nif you're training in\nthe morning and you\nhave not consumed anything\nprior to your workout.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nthat's not necessarily\neating in the middle\nof the workout.\nThat's drinking calories.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah,\nit's going to be--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I,\nyes, to see someone\neating a sandwich in the gym.\nAlthough, I'm sure\nit's happened.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nSo one to one is that sort\nof standard number here.\nIf you're going\nto do sort of more\nof a really hard\nconditioning workout,\nthat number slides up\nto something like three\nor even four to\none, which would be\ncarbohydrate to protein ratio.\nSo if we want to stay\nat 35 grams of protein,\nwe're going to go maybe as\nhigh as like 100 or 140 grams\nof carbohydrate, depending\non what type of training\nwe're sort of doing.\nIf you're going to do a\nlittle bit of a combination,\nthen you-- like a\nlittle bit of strength,\na little bit of conditioning,\nand kind of a standard workout,\nwhich is probably something\nthat a lot of people will do,\nthen you maybe want to go to\nsomething like two to one.\nSo 35 grams of protein, 60,\n70 grams of carbohydrate.\nAnd those are kind of\njust like rough numbers\nthat you can go by.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And for\npure hypertrophy training,\nwould you like to\nsee people ingest\nsome carbohydrate post-training?\nANDY GALPIN: For pure\nhypertrophy training,\nI want to see that-- as\nmany of those nutrients\naround the training\nis generally possible.\nNow again, I may\nchange my mind when\nour fasting study comes out.\nBut as it stands now,\nthere is no advantage\nto not fueling\naround the training.\nAnd there are some known and\nsome other potential advantages\nto fueling.\nSo I just see no\nreason to not do it.\nIn fact, most people are\ngenerally going to do better.\nNow this is not science, this\nis just my coaching experience.\nAnd this is with our athletes\nand all of our non-athletes\nthat we've worked\nwith and do work with.\nThey're just going to be better\nspreading those meals out\ngenerally throughout the day.\nAnd they're going to be better\nif they have those nutrients\neither pre, mid, or post.\nAnd so they're going to get--\neven for hypertrophy-- they're\ngoing to get something\nlike that three to one\nratio of carbs of protein.\nPersonal preference.\nSome people don't like\nto eat before they train,\nsome people have to\neat before they train,\nsome people can't put in food in\ntheir belly immediately after.\nWork around that.\nYou can play based on\npersonal preference.\nBut we want that\nfeeling in there\nbecause we want to maximize\nthe potential growth.\nAnd we want to just get\na jumpstart on recovery\nbecause we're going to be\ntraining again pretty soon.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
