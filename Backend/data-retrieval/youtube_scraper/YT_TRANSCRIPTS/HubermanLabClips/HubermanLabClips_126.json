    "transcript": "Andrew Huberman: I was taught that\none should do higher\nrepetition movements with lighter\nweights in order to warm up.\nAnd then one of the things that did make\na big positive difference for me in terms\nof strength and hypertrophy training was\nto do a moderate repetition warm up\nwith a fairly lightweight but then\nto actually keep the number of warmup\nrepetitions fairly low and work\nprogressively toward\nthe first so called work set.\nWhen you say three to five,\nthat's three to five work sets, correct?\nAndy Galpin: Yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: Are you also going to tell\nme three to five warm ups?\nAndy Galpin: No.\nAndrew Huberman: Are you also going to tell me that it\nhas to be done between 3:00 and 5:00\np.m.?\nAndrew Huberman: So in terms of--\nAndy Galpin: Three to five friends.\nAndrew Huberman: In all seriousness, what does\na good warm up look like?\nAnd I realize this will vary depending\non how cool your training environment is,\ntime of day, et cetera, but as a kind\nof umbrella for a good warm up.\nAndy Galpin: Okay.\nAndrew Huberman: What should people do?\nAndy Galpin: The you've already sort of jumped the gun\nwith my answer. It is honestly\nvery dependent upon the person.\nSo some folks respond very\nwell to a minimum warmup.\nOthers I've had lots of actually\nprofessional fighters I've worked\nwith where I actually have a Major League\nBaseball player right now.\nHe's one of the best pitchers\nin the game, probably the best.\nAnd the longer we warm up,\nthe better his numbers get.\nWe actually did a vertical\njump test with him.\nHe's going to kill me\nbecause he got so mad.\nI wanted to see how long it sort of took\nhim to reach a peak vertical jump.\nAnd most times this takes people\nsomething like five to ten sort of reps.\nAnd I said, take it up all the way\nto a maximum vertical jump.\nAnd then we'll what I want you to do is\ncontinue to jumping until you have three\nconsecutive jumps or you're\ndown lower than 90%.\nAnd so what we're trying to look at is\nsort of when is he going to break?\nBecause in baseball he's going\nto throw like 100 pitches or so.\nAnd we're trying to figure out when is his\npeak velocity on his fastball going\nto drop and sort of base\nhis conditioning on that.\nIt's a different style of conditioning.\nIt's power endurance.\nIt's really what it is.\nHe called me in the middle of it\nand I'm like, oh, he's done whatever.\nAnd he's just like, no,\nhow many of these am I supposed to do?\nAnd I was like,\nwhat are you talking about?\nHe's like, I'm on rep 130 or something.\nAnd I was like, what?\nAnd I'm like, what rep did you peak on?\nHe peaked on rep 70, something like that.\n69, I think technically\nbecause he's goofy.\nSo he's a classic example I've\nworked with him for many, many years.\nWe have a ton of data on him,\na ton of biological data,\na ton of neurological stuff.\nLike all kinds of stuff.\nAnd it just the more he warms up,\nan absurd amount of warm up,\nthe better he gets.\nAnd the better he gets in power production\nand the better he gets\nin speed and velocity.\nSo his warm up prior to games,\nit's totally absurd.\nAnd just the more volume we throw\nat him, the better he does.\nI have other folks.\nYou get past like two or three reps\nand fatigue starts to set in,\nand now you're actually like\nreducing power production.\nSo there is a ton of variation\nthat goes into that.\nI can give you some guidelines, though.\nYou need to differentiate if you're\ntraining for speed,\npower strength, or hypertrophy.\nHere's why.\nIf we understand a little bit about what's\ncausing the adaptation, that's going\nto tell you what you need to do or avoid.\nFor example,\nvolume is the primary\ndriver in hypertrophy.\nIntensity is the primary driver\nin speed, power, and strength.\nAll right?\nSo what that means is you need to preserve\nintensity for the first three,\nyou need to preserve volume\nand the second one at most.\nSo if your warm up is so extensive\nin the hypertrophy training that it\ncompromises your training volume because\nof fatigue, even if it compromises\nthe last set of the last exercise,\nthen you're actually probably\nwalking yourself backwards\nby doing that extensive.\nYou'd have been better off starting your\nfirst working set slightly\nsuboptimal, right?\nCause you're just trying\nto accrue volume at that point.\nStrength and power is the opposite.\nUntil you're moving very,\nvery fast or powerfully,\nyou're not really causing the adaptation.\nSo there's no point of starting your\nworking set until you're\nreally basically at 100%.\nSo the warm up should be as long as it\ntakes you to get to where your\nmobility is in the right spot.\nLike your joints feel good,\nyou feel fresh, you feel activated,\nand you really feel peak power.\nAnything before that is a warmup set.\nIn the sport of Olympic weightlifting,\na lot of times the coaches\nwill measure barbell velocity.\nTravis Mash has done\na fantastic job with this.\nHe's got a lot of data on what's\ncalled velocity based training.\nBryan Mann at Missouri and Miami,\ntons of work here,\nand generally those communities are not\ngoing to count any repetition as a working\nset until you exceed 70%\nof your one rep max.\nWhere that's changed because of a lot\nof people doing the velocity based stuff\nis now they're basing that simply\non an achieved velocity.\nAnd so really the warmup is irrelevant.\nThey don't even it's sort of just like,\ndo whatever you want and we're going\nto measure the barbell until you\nactually hit an outcome.\nAnd now you're at what, a working set.\nSo different ways to think about it,\ndepending on what you're training for,\nthat will give you a little\nbit of a guideline.\nIf you're training for anything past\nhypertrophy, then really,\nespecially even hypertrophy it just comes\ndown to are you feeling ready to work?\nAre you cold?\nAre you moving to the correct positions?\nAnd if all those things are fine,\nI don't care if you start a little bit\nearly and save some gas at the end of it, especially if\nyou're a person like you who may be a bit\nmore inclined to fatigue quickly\nrelative to Trevor, who just has\nno response to fatigue whatsoever.\nAndrew Huberman: Is it useful to do more warm up\nat the beginning of a workout,\nsay before the first exercise?\nAnd then once one has achieved both local\nand systemic, warm up in air quotes,\nthen perhaps on the second or third\nexercise, fourth exercise, etc.\none or maybe even zero warm ups.\nAndy Galpin: Yeah, fair point.\nWe generally think about warm\nups in a couple of ways.\nThis is a really actually,\nthis is a very clever question.\nYou want to have some sort\nof general global warm up scheme.\nWe tend to prefer dynamic warm ups.\nSo this is whole body movements rather\nthan sitting and stretching,\nstatic stretching, things like that.\nAndrew Huberman: So something that\ninvolves momentum.\nAndy Galpin: Yeah, momentum or movement.\nRight.\nSo this is like\nthink about this in like old gym class.\nIt's like your high knees and your butt\nkickers and just different things like\nthat where you're moving in different\nplanes, you're moving joints\nthrough tons of range of motion.\nYou're getting a lot of movement there.\nSo you're getting the local warm up.\nYou're also getting the total\nsystemic activation.\nEverything else is going on there.\nSo that is what we consider\nto be a general warm up.\nFive minutes is a very sufficient number,\nperhaps ten if you're a slow goer,\nachy and some things like that.\nAnd you really got to get\nthe ankle warmed up.\nIf you're doing lower body stuff, really\nmake sure that that's moving correctly.\nThe hips and knees will follow.\nUpper body stuff, really get the shoulder\nblades and the neck,\nlike making sure you're going there\nand the elbows will follow after that.\nSo five to seven minutes of a general warm\nup a lot of times, like classic exercise\nscience, it will even just put you\non a bike cycling for five minutes.\nI don't like that, personally.\nDynamic movement is more preferred.\nIf you really just move for five\nto seven minutes, you'll be fine there.\nNow specificity within each movement.\nIt's very important that your first\nexercise of the day is generally\nthe thing you prioritize.\nThat's oftentimes the most important\nyou're going to do. Oftentimes is\nalso the most complex\nand the most moving parts.\nSo it tends to be multi joint.\nTherefore you need to have movement,\nprecision and skill dialed.\nYou don't typically start your\nworkouts off with the forearm curl.\nYou don't need a tremendous amount\nof warm up to get going on that.\nYou're going to start off with medicine\nball throws or a snatch\nor some agility work.\nYou need to have the whole system going\nbecause multiple joints are moving,\nposition matters, technique, there's just\na lot of skill requirement, et cetera.\nSo the individualized workout or\nthe specific workout for the specific\nmovement for that very first one,\nmy general rule of thumb is like whatever\nit takes to move perfect\nin that first exercise.\nPast that, you don't necessarily need\nto do individualized warm ups for your\nnext movements, unless it is a movement\nyou're trying to learn or just\neven get a little bit better at.\nDrop the load a little bit, work\non some accruing, some practice reps.\nFantastic.\nOr it's another dissimilar\ncomplex movement.\nSo let's say your first exercise was\na front squat and you got loaded\nfor that and now you're going to move\ninto a pull up, but your\nmechanics aren't the best there.\nAnd so you really need to change and do\nsome maybe more specific activation warm\nups for that or something else, or it's\nrunning or something totally different.\nSo, yeah, you don't need to rewarm up\nfor every single exercise as you go.\nGenerally, once you're good to go,\nthe same muscles that you're going to use\nin the next exercise are warm,\nsame joints, then you're good to go.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
