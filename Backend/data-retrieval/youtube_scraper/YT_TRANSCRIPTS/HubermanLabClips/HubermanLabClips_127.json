    "transcript": "let's talk about strength and\nhypertrophy\nif you would please remind us what\nstrength and hypertrophy are in terms of\nthe specific adaptation they represent\nwhat I mean by that is when somebody is\ntraining for strength what are they\nreally training for obviously it means\nthe ability to move more weight but I\nknow that it includes a number of other\nthings as well and when one is training\nfor hypertrophy for the growth of muscle\nfibers\nwhat does that represent because I think\nif people understand that they will far\nbetter understand the methods and\nprotocols that are going to be best for\nstrength and hypertrophy at its core\nyou've basically described it when we\ntalk about strength we're talking about\nan actual function so can you create\nmore Force across a muscle or muscle\ngroups or our total movement and when we\ntalk about hypertrophy now we're\nspecifically referring to just an\nincrease in size there's no actual\nmention of function so a muscle can grow\nlarger without actually technically\nbeing stronger for a number of reasons\nhowever there is a strong relationship\nbetween strength and hypertrophy so a\nlot of the times in the general public\nin the lay conversations we sort of lump\nthose two things in it's the same thing\nand so we have to recognize people who\nare new to training or people even are\nintermediately trained there is a huge\noverlap between strength and perjury\nonce you get past that though they\nbecome disentangled and a good example\nof it is this if you look at the\nstrongest people in the world this would\nbe be people who compete in the sport of\npowerlifting\nright that's a true test of maximal\nstrength so it is a deadlift a bench\npress and a back squat and you're going\nto do a one repetition Max on all three\nof those and so whoever wins is the\nperson who lifted the most amount of\nweight one time that's it it's not like\nWorld's Strongest Man where it is how\nmany reps can you do in a row or your\ntime right is a true maximal strength\ntest and you compare those to say\nbodybuilders now both of those\nindividuals are strong and both of those\nindividuals have a lot of muscle however\nit is extremely clear the power lifters\nwill be significantly stronger\nthan the bodybuilders on average right\nthere are individual exceptions but\nwe're just talking Collective averages\nand the bodybuilders will have more\nmuscle than the other ones in addition\nwhether you look at Olympic\nweightlifting or power lifting or\nworld's strongest man for that matter\nthere are weight classes and the reason\nis as you go up in weight classes you\nwill always see the world records go\nhigher and higher and higher right so\nyou can clearly get stronger without\nadding any muscle however there's a\npoint right where you simply have to add\nmore mass to get a higher number and\nthat's why we have weight classes in\nthose Sports and in Combat Sports and\nlots of other things so\nwe have there's a lot of confusion right\nbecause people think man either these\nare the same thing or if I want to get\nstronger I have to get bigger which is\nnot the case at all another misnomer\nhere is I can't get stronger\nunless I add muscle that's not true\neither right it's a similar idea\nso what what I'm saying is you have the\nability to do whatever you'd like if\nyou'd like to get stronger and add\nmuscle\ngreat if you add muscle you're probably\ngoing to bring some strength along for\nthe ride\nhowever if you want to get stronger and\nyou don't want to add muscle for any\nreason personal preference on Aesthetics\nwhether you're in a weight class and you\nsimply can't afford it it is quite easy\nto get stronger and not add much muscle\nmass either and so differentiating these\ntwo things is one of them is simply a\nmeasure of size and the other one is a\nmeasure of force and when we talk about\nstrength what we're really talking about\nare two unique components component one\nis what I call the physiology so what it\nwhat is the ability of the neuromuscular\nsystem what is the ability of the muscle\nfibers to contract and produce Force the\nother one is what we call mechanics and\nmechanics is simply things like it's\nminutia down to how long your femurs are\nrelative to your tibia or or other\nthings like this is biomechanics this is\nalso technique this is skill this is how\nsmooth you feel this is are you firing\nthe right muscle group in the right\nsequence and Order and all of these\nthings play into strength so somebody\nwho maybe has more Force capability in\ntheir muscle fibers but their technique\nin the movement is worse may lose in a\ncompetition or somebody again who's\num like if you go into the world of\nspeed and power especially you'll hear a\nlot of people talk about like the Rhythm\nand there's just a certain Rhythm that\nhas to happen if you want to jump as\nhigh as possible or run as fast as fast\nas possible but that's all mechanics at\nthis fundamental level so when we look\nat hypertrophy\nit's just still simply about how big the\nmuscle is\nso those are the really the the\nsimilarities and distinctions between\nstrength and hypertrophy\n[Music]"
