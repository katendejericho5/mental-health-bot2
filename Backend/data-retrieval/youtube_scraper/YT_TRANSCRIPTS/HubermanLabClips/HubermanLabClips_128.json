    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThe things that you\nare getting in touch with--\nwrestling, sleep and dreaming,\nthe ocean, there's a\npredictability of them\nbecause you can access\nthem in a predictable way,\nbut they seem to have a lot\nof unpredictability in them.\nThe ocean is completely\nunpredictable.\nRICK RUBIN: I also listen to a\nlot of music that I don't know.\nSo I listen to a lot of\nclassical music, and less so\nbut some jazz, and\na lot of old music\nthat I never heard before.\nAnd I like being\nsurprised by music.\nAnd sometimes it really\ncatches me off guard.\nI shazam a lot when I\nhear something I like.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Have\nyou ever encountered\nmusic that really\nworks well live\nbut just does not\nwork in a recording?\nOr that it's much better\nlive but the recording is\nsort of, meh.\nYou don't have to name names.\nRICK RUBIN: I don't think so.\nI feel like maybe there\nare some artists who\nare great live who've never\ncaptured it well on record.\nExample would probably\nbe the Grateful Dead\nis a good example\nof a band where\nI feel like their albums\nare not their strong point.\nBut if you hear live\nrecordings, they're\nreally interesting and really\ndifferent from each other.\nAnd that's part of what makes\nthe Grateful Dead interesting\nis their unpredictability.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I confess.\nI had a sister who listened\nto the Grateful Dead.\nAnd I got taken to a few\nshows when I was younger.\nAnd they would do that--\nwas it called space?\nIt was these drum\nsolos that would go on\nfor hours and hours.\nThis is like the antithesis\nof punk rock shows,\nwhere songs are like\n90 to 120 seconds.\nAnd I remember\nthinking, what is this?\nWhat is this?\nBut people I know, who\nlove the Grateful Dead,\nlove that uncertainty about\nwhere that drum thing--\nI think they do call it space.\nForgive me deadheads.\nI'm not enough of\none to get it right.\nRICK RUBIN: But they're\nlooking for something.\nAnd sometimes they find it.\nAnd if you're there\nwhen they find it,\nit feels exciting\nbecause it's not just--\nIt's not just\nfollowing a script.\nIt's like something\nis really happening.\nIt's a real moment.\nFor in the studio is\nto create real moments\nthat when you hear them,\nthey don't necessarily\nsound perfect.\nThey sound like something\nthat really happened.\nAnd in that moment,\nsomething happened.\nAnd it's a special moment.\nAnd you can feel that if\nthey were to play it again,\nit wouldn't be like that.\nThere's something really\nexciting about that.\nIt's really what-- it's\nhow jazz works as well.\nAnd I think some of-- bringing\nsome of that jazz mentality\ninto other types of music\nis really interesting,\nmakes for compelling things,\nbecause when you hear them,\nthere's a certain\namount of-- you really\nhave to pay attention to do it.\nWhen you're doing it, you're\nreally paying attention.\nIt's like, I don't really know.\nThere's no music.\nThere's no map to follow.\nAnd now we're working\ntogether to make something.\nDo I play or not play?\nWhen do I play?\nAnd you're really\npaying attention.\nAnd can I add or you go\nto start adding something.\nAnd someone else\nadded something.\nIt's like, oh, I can't do that.\nAnd it's like everyone's\njust in this thing,\nin this moment experiencing\nthis thing at once that you\ncan feel as a listener.\nAnd we get to hear their\nexcitement of finding it.\nAnd it's thrilling\nwhen it happens.\nSo I like that experience.\nI feel that's what\nthe Dead do live.\nThey'll play songs\nin different ways.\nAnd again, I don't know\nvery much about the Dead.\nIt's newer for me to\nlisten to the Dead.\nGrowing up, I never\nlisten to the Dead,\nbut probably because I\nheard songs on their albums\nand thought, this doesn't\nreally speak to me.\nBut I think that the\nalbums don't really reflect\nwhat's special about them.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think\na lot of their shows\nwere recorded or videotaped--\nRICK RUBIN: By fans\nwhich they supported.\nThey supported that everybody\ncome, everybody tape,\neverybody trade tapes.\nIt made sense for\nwho that band was.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: They redefined\nor they defined-- excuse me,\nthe notion of followers.\nI mean, people literally\ngave up their lives\nor spent much of their lives\nliterally driving from city\nto city to follow them.\nRICK RUBIN: Because it's not\nlike going from city to city\nto watch a movie over and\nover because it's not a movie.\nIt's different every night.\nIt's changing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's pretty\nincredible phenomenon.\nI don't know of anything else\nquite like it except cults.\nAnd those often don't end well.\nI think a guy that mixed\nthe punch for the Jonestown\nMassacre went to my high school.\nRICK RUBIN: Is that true?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think so.\nRICK RUBIN: That's amazing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nMy sister is really\ngood at all this '70s, '80s\ndark psychology trivia.\nShe's a very light person.\nRICK RUBIN: Did you read\nSeason of the Witch.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No.\nRICK RUBIN: It's about\nSan Francisco in the '60s.\nIt's great.\nYou'll love it.\nGreat book.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll\nhave to check it out.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
