    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: If, for instance,\nyou're somebody who\nfalls asleep just fine\nbut wakes up in the middle of\nthe night around 2:00 or 3:00\nAM or any time for that\nmatter and has trouble falling\nback asleep, there\nare two categories\nof supplements that you\nmight want to consider.\nThe first is\nmyoinositol, typically\ntaken as 900 milligrams\nof myoinositol.\nMyoinositol can help\nshorten the amount of time\nthat it takes to fall\nback asleep if you wake up\nin the middle of the\nnight. myoinositol\nhas other beneficial uses\nas well for mood, et cetera.\nIf you'd like to see many of\nthe different effects that\nhave been explored in\nthe scientific literature\nfrom myoinositol, you\ncan go to examine.com.\nIt's an excellent site\nnot just for inositol\nbut for all supplements\nfor that matter.\nTalks about the\nhuman effect matrix.\nThat is, the different effects\nof different supplement\ncompounds on different aspects\nof hormone, brain, and body\nhealth where the\nevidence is strong,\nwhere the evidence is weak, has\nlinks to studies, and so on.\nAgain, it's examine.com--\namazing website,\nwonderful website.\nIt's provided such\na rich resource\nfor me and for many,\nmany other people.\nOther people who wake up\nin the middle of the night\nwill wake up because their\ndreams are very intense or they\nwere having dreams\nthat were so vivid\nthat suddenly they were\njolted from their dreams.\nThose people would do well\nto avoid certain supplements.\nSo in a moment, I'll\ntalk about the value\nof a supplement called\ntheanine for falling asleep.\nBut theanine, which typically\nis taken in dosages anywhere\nfrom 100 milligrams\nto 400 milligrams\ndepending on body\nweight and experience\nand what you find to be most\neffective for you-- minimally\neffective for you.\nWell, theanine can be\ngreat for many people,\nbut for people who have\nexcessively vivid dreams--\nthose excessively vivid dreams\ncan lead to immediate waking\nand sometimes a\nlittle bit of anxiety\nupon waking in the\nmiddle of the night.\nSo some people who wake up\nin the middle of the night\nsort of jolted mentally and\nphysically out of sleep because\nof their intense\ndreams would do well\nto avoid theanine\nsupplementation.\nI've talked about\nthis a bit before,\nbut it's something that I\nthink a lot of nighttime middle\nof the night wakers\nmight be familiar with\nand would want to take\ninto consideration.\nNow, for those of you\nthat are not waking up\nin the middle of\nthe night are not\nhaving excessively vivid\ndreams but are having trouble\nfalling asleep, two\nsupplements, in particular,\nhave been shown to be effective\nfor shortening the transition\ntime to sleep and allowing\npeople to ease into sleep more\nreadily.\nAnd those are\nmagnesium threonate\nwhich is interchangeable\nwith magnesium bisglycinate.\nMagnesium bisglycinate\nand magnesium\nthreonate both have\ntransporter systems that\nallow them to readily cross\nthe blood brain barrier,\nand they lead to a mild\nform of drowsiness.\nMild in the sense that it's\nnot going to prevent you\nfrom operating a motor vehicle\nor kind of any conditions\nunder emergency that might arise\nin the middle of the night,\nor if they did arise here\nin the middle of night,\nyou'd still be able to function.\nSo it's not like a sleeping\npill, but people who take those\noften find that their transition\ntime into sleep is much faster\nand their sleep is\nalso much deeper.\nIncidentally, those\nsupplements are also\nthought to be useful\nfor cognitive support\nand neuroprotection.\nAlthough there's\nless data on that.\nSo that's for falling asleep.\nThat's one category\neither magnesium\nthreonate or\nbisglycinate would be\ninterchangeable for assisting\nthe transition time into sleep.\nAnd then the other\nsupplement is apigenin--\nA-P-I-G-E-N-I-N-- apigenin,\nwhich is the derivative\nof chamomile.\nI've talked about this in\nvarious podcasts before.\nAlso acts as a bit\nof a anxiety lowering\ncompound, which is essential\nprior to sleep for people\nto essentially turn\noff their thinking\nor to be able to reduce\nthe amount of ruminating\nand problem-solving\nand future anticipation\nthat they're doing, which is a\nrequirement for falling asleep.\nSo what's the rational\napproach to supplementing\nin a way that allows you\nto fall asleep more quickly\nand stay asleep?\nWell, would you immediately\ntake magnesium threonate\nand apigenin in together.\nWell, that depends.\nIf you have the budget\nand you just simply want\nto fall asleep quicker and you\ndon't care which of those two\ningredients is going to\nbe more effective for you,\nwell, then you could try one.\nFor instance, magnesium\nthreonate and try it\nfor perhaps a week and see\nhow that affects your latency\nto sleep time.\nThat is, how quickly\nyou fall asleep,\nor you could try up\napigenin in the first week\nor you could combine\nthem both or you\ncould try magnesium\nthreonate for a week then\nswitch to only\napigenin for a week\nand evaluate which one\nworks better for you.\nIf neither works for you,\nI do recommend trying\nthe combination together.\nAgain, this is just the\nway that any scientist\nwould design an experiment\nto try and understand\nwhich variables, that\nis, which ingredients are\nmost effective for the result\nthat you want as opposed\nto just lumping them\ntogether and taking them.\nThat said, a lot of people\nwant excellent sleep\nso badly that they\njust say, OK, I'm\njust going to take\nmagnesium threonate.\nI'm going to take apigenin and\nI'm going to take theanine.\nIf my dreams are\ntoo vivid or I'm\nwaking up in the\nmiddle of the night\nfrom excessively vivid dreams,\nI'll drop the theanine.\nAnd many people will\nactually derive great benefit\nfrom that approach.\nBut because today we're\ntalking about the most rational\ncost-effective and\nbiologically effective\napproach to supplementation.\nIf you're not sleeping as\nwell as you would like to\nor if you want to explore\nwhat sleeping even more deeply\nmight do for your\nmental health, physical\nhealth, and performance,\nwell, then it\nmakes sense to think about the\nvarious supplements for falling\nasleep versus remaining\nasleep, what to include,\nwhat not to include, and\nto do that systematically.\nAnd again, I think\none week's time\nof taking something\nprovided it doesn't\ninduce any negative effects.\nIf something induces\na negative effect,\nI recommend seizing\ntaking it immediately.\nBut if something does not\nproduce any negative effects,\nthen I think you want to try a\nsingle-ingredient formulation\nfor about a week while\nnot varying anything else,\nnot changing anything else\nin your overall protocols\nof nutrition or supplementation.\nI mean, it's impossible to\nclamp everything perfectly\nfrom week to week, but\ndon't change anything\nelse dramatically and just add\nthat supplement for a given\nweek see how it\nbenefits your sleep.\nMaybe add in a second supplement\nif you like or rather swap\nand try a different\nsupplement for a week\nand then see what works best\nand see if the combination works\neven better.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
