    "transcript": "Are there any sex differences,\nmale, female differences, in\nsort of these dopamine levels,\nworking memory, injuries, concussion,\nthings that would direct people\ntoward different routes of treatment,\ngiven that maybe there's more\nsusceptibility in one case,\nmaybe less susceptibility,\nmaybe certain neurotransmitters\nare more effective\nin improving symptoms in men versus women.\nDo you see that in the clinic?\nYeah, that's a great question.\nEmily Jacobs, who's a professor\nat UC Santa Barbara now in\nthe psychology department,\nwhen she was a graduate student in my lab,\nstudied the role of\nestrogen on working memory\nand dopaminergic function\nand what she brought to\nmy attention at the time\nand it was embarrassing\nthat I didn't know,\nwas the frontal lobes are\nfull of estrogen receptors.\nThere's probably more estrogen receptors\nin the frontal lobes than\nany other part of the brain.\nIn men and women.\nEstrogen boosts dopamine,\nso higher estrogen levels correlates\nwith increased dopamine levels\nand there was some anecdotal evidence\nthat in post-menopausal women\nwho were put on estrogen,\nthat their working memory improved\nand there was a kind of evolving link\nbetween estrogen and frontal lobe function\nand she did this amazing study\nwhere she studied healthy\nBerkeley undergraduates\nat two points in time\nduring their menstrual cycle\nwhen estrogen was at its\nlowest and at was highest\nand she also genotyped\nthem for this enzyme\nthat we're talking about to know\nif they were sort of lower or\nhigher on the dopamine level\nand then put them in the scanner\nand measured frontal lobe function\nand showed that frontal\nlobe function was modulated\nby where they were in\ntheir estrogen cycle.\nWhen they were low estrogen,\nthey were low dopamine,\nand if they were low estrogen\nand low dopamine to start,\nthey really had decreased\nfrontal lobe function\nand decreased working memory ability.\nSo, it fluctuated based\non this interaction\nbetween estrogen and dopamine,\nsuggesting that not only\ndopamine is important,\nbut hormones are clearly important\nand they work synergistically.\nSo, as we're developing this cocktail,\nwe certainly have to bring\nhormones into the equation\nand learn more about it.\nThere's just so little information\nabout hormones and cognition.\nYeah, one of the themes that's come out of\nsome of the episodes we've done with MDs\nwho specialize in endocrine health is that\nfor both men and for women,\noptimizing estrogen\nlevels is really important\nfor cognition and vascular function.\nI think people mistakenly hear,\n\"Okay, testosterone,\nmen, estrogen, women,\"\nobviously both hormones are\npresent in men and women.\nIn fact, I know that\ntestosterone levels in women\nare actually higher than\ntheir estrogen levels\nwhen you sort of use the\nsame units of measure,\nit just so happens that they still have\nlower testosterone on average\nthan the typical male.\nBut that men whose\nestrogen levels are too low\nsuffer cognitive defects\nand vascular defects.\nSo this idea that more testosterone,\nlower estrogen in men is the ideal.\nRight.\nAnd it just doesn't hold.\nRight.\nIt doesn't hold.\nUnless you want to be dumb\nand have a heart attack,\nit just doesn't hold.\nVery interesting.\nDo we know what estrogen's doing there?\nIt's specifically raising dopamine,\nwe don't have to get into\nthe synaptic biology.\nIt's so interesting.\nYeah, it's actually\nboosting dopamine activity.\nSo it's making more dopamine available.\nYeah, yeah, it's really a amazing\nand to think about it sort of fluctuating,\ncertainly during the menstrual cycle,\nwe can think about how much it fluctuates\nin a woman over 30 days,\nbut then you can think across individuals,\nyou can think about\nhow much it can account\nfor individual differences.\nSo not only sort of knowing\nyour dopamine level,\nbut you knowing estrogen\nand it's certainly really\ngoing to be important.\nInteresting.\n[upbeat music]"
