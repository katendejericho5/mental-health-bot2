    "transcript": "what is the balance for you in terms of\nstructure and lack of structure and I'm\nnot going to ask for your daily routine\nwe know that you get up early you train\nbut I do have some specific questions\nthat I think would be helpful in putting\nsome meat on the the kind of uh the\nNotions about you and again this isn't\nto pick into your life but more to to\ngrab well it's to pick into your life\nthe uh so a question I asked you in the\nlaw because it's one that you know\nhaving seen your content for a long time\nand really benefited from it I was\ncurious you get up early at about 4 30\nyou train every morning\nhow long do you train for and is there\nany Global structure to that and of\ncourse everyone needs different programs\nbut do you is it like weight training\none day cardio training the next day are\nyou combining them is it always an hour\nis it always half an hour I think people\nwould benefit from getting a little bit\nmore understanding of what that looks\nlike for you with the caveat that\neveryone has different needs levels of\nyou know background Etc but I'm\nintensely curious about this and I'm\ncertain I'm not the only one so do you\nwant to talk about weight lifting or\nrock and roll on the guitar uh I want to\ntalk about\num let's your let's talk about the most\nstructured first part of your day and\nthen let's talk about the least\nstructured part of your day at least the\npart that you can share with the with\nthe world\nyeah uh waking up early and I'm gonna\nwork out and depending on what's going\non that day if I have an early flight I\nmight work out for\neight minutes right I might go in and do\n2 000 meters on the rower get get a\nsweat going hard as I can and then I'm\ndone and because I gotta go catch a\nflight so that could be happening maybe\nI'm supposed to go surfing in the\nmorning I wake up the waves are terrible\nand so now I've got nothing to do I've\nplanned out you know to be surfing for\ntwo or three hours\nand now I'm not gonna go surfing so I'm\ngonna go I'm gonna go lift and I'm gonna\ngo play in the gym and do a bunch of\nstuff I'm gonna spend two or three hours\nin there\nI love doing that\nso the workout could be anywhere between\nwhat I just say eight minutes and three\nhours and it could be anything in\nbetween\nI I fully enjoy the the physical aspect\nof working out so if I have more time to\nspend in the gym I'll spend it\nI remember my dad saying at one point if\nI retired I wouldn't know what to do\nand I I was thinking myself are you\nserious right now you know if I didn't\nhave anything to do I'd spend six hours\na day in the gym I'd spend four hours\ndoing Jiu Jitsu like I could fill my day\nI could fill every day with just\nphysical activity things that I just\nlike doing uh but that's so wake up\nearly get a sweat going and do I lift\nyes do i do cardio yes do I run yes do i\nSprint yes do I lift heavy weights yes\ndo I swing kettlebells yes I I do\neverything and and anything and I enjoy\nall of it and I'm not really good at any\nof it you know I'm not I'm not really\ngood at any one aspect of physical\nactivity I I'm there's people that are\ninfinitely better at me in every aspect\nof and I'm not just talking about oh\nthis guy's a world-class level and\nthere's like a guy named Fred down at\nthe gym that can deadlift more than me\nthere was a guy when I was at Seal Team\ntoo there was a guy who was\nprobably five seven and he looked kind\nof chubby and he was older than me and\nhe could run faster than me and he could\nbench more than me those guys are out\nthere it was so bothersome yeah they're\nout there they they've got some engine\nin there related to something I mean I\ndo think there are genetic differences\nin terms of people's resilience and work\nout but even just grip strength is\nhighly um highly subjected like genetic\ninfluences maximum grip strength but of\ncourse there's a huge range in what\npeople can develop but I guarantee your\ngrip strength is is greater than mine\num people ask me this all the time who\nwould win an arm wrestling between you\nand Jacob my Jocko who went in Jocko you\nknow there's a lot of technique in arm\nwrestling uh I have to imagine they're\nputting their body behind it they're\nputting their their back like there is\nlegitimate technique in arm wrestling\nwhere for me yet yeah there's no like if\nwe could bring a female arm wrestler in\nhere that knows how to arm wrestle\nbecause I don't know how to arm wrestle\neither and she would be both of us\num because there's a lot of there's a\nlot more technique and arm wrestling\nthan you know\nthen most people recognize there's all\nthese little games that are going on\nthere's all this little arm position\nthat you get so just like everything\nelse it's technique there's a lot of\ntechnique in arm wrestling that's good\nto know I didn't know that about arm\nwrestling I think we all start off with\nsome genetic predispositions both good\nand bad for different things and then\nthere's as far as we know there's a huge\nrange based through neuroplasticity and\nmuscle adaptation Etc in what we can\nobtain so I never want genetic\npredisposition to serve as a barrier no\none knows also what the upper limits of\nany of these things are and some of the\nbest examples we know from Sport and\ncertainly from Academia are people who\nknew they were at a disadvantage and\njust worked 10 times harder than\neverybody else because they had an ax to\ngrind with their genetic disadvantage\nwhich is really cool at the face of it\nso you get you get the training and do\ntrack your training in in a detailed way\nare you keeping track of lifts and so I\nwrite down what I do and I'll write down\nI write down what I do every day and\nthat way I can go back and say you know\nwhat was I doing back then because I\nmight go through some phase where I'm\ntrying to do more pull-ups or I'm trying\nto deadlift more and I'm trying or\nwhatever the whatever the thing is I'll\ngo back into because I have a board of\ndead lifting after a while and let's\nface it if you just want to be a good\ndead lifter\nyou're not going to be that fast right\nyou're you're going to be slow on long\nruns so you don't want to go too deep\ninto deadlifting and you also don't want\nto be so good at long runs that you\ncan't deadlift you know a good amount of\nweight so I got to go through phases and\nI'll get into something for a while and\nI'll get into something else so I do log\ndown what I'm doing so I can look back\nand say oh dang you know I I'm not even\nclose to as strong as I used to be need\nto get back to that\nI'm fascinated by the concept of energy\nI think it's one of the most interesting\naspects in all of biology all of\npsychology and all of life and what when\nI say energy I mean\num the distinction between being back on\nyour heels flat-footed or forward Center\nof mass you know and I get the\nimpression and I think everyone gets the\nimpression you're somebody with a lot of\nenergy and I wonder whether or not you\nwake up with a lot of energy and you\nfeel like you have to burn it off with\nthis physical activity and and work and\nother demands in your life where do you\nfind that you wake up and your energy is\nkind of neutral and exercise and\nphysical activity gives you energy\nbecause I think this is one of the key\nthings out there I think that acts as a\nbarrier for people doing more with their\nbody because they maybe they don't want\nto Tire themselves out or maybe they\ndon't feel like they have enough energy\nto begin with\nit's also feeds into this idea that you\nknow some people just have a lot of\nenergy they're really physical and other\npeople aren't so on let's just say on\nmost days do you wake up feeling like\nyou want to burn off energy build energy\nwhat does exercise mean to you and then\nmaybe we could talk about some of the\nunderlying stuff going on there because\nI think we both might find it\ninteresting I would say it's both right\nthere's no way I could sit here and say\noh yeah every day that alarm clock goes\noff and I'm like oh yeah let's rock and\nroll not certainly that's not the case\nit's also certainly not the case that\nevery day I'm like oh God not again no\nuh I'd say most the time the alarm clock\ngoes off and I I don't think a bunch\nlike when my alarm clock goes off I\ndon't I don't think a bunch I don't\ndebate with myself I'm not negotiating I\njust the thing goes off and I'm doing\nwhat I'm supposed to do\nsort of robotic now I this this much I\ncan say when you go and work out you're\ngoing to feel better you will get energy\nfrom working out you that is that is a\nguarantee if you go work out you're\ngonna feel better if you go break a\nsweat you're going to feel better this\nyou're going to get more energy from it\nand look you gotta go really really hard\nto where now you feel more tired when\nyou're done and even that I mean you got\nto go psycho I'll do that occasionally\nbut I don't do that on a daily basis you\nknow at the end of the day if I wake up\nlift run Surf and then I do Jiu Jitsu in\nthe afternoon like at the end of that\nday I'm tired\nand I feel tired uh but normal day\nworking out just makes you feel better\nit definitely gives you it definitely\ngives me energy I should say because I\nguess I'm not everybody yeah it's I\nthink it's a very important point\nbecause one of the things that we are\nlearning from circadian biology you know\ntime of day effects and sunlight and all\nthat stuff that we talk about on our\npodcast that you've done intuitively\nright this is what we kind of arrived to\nit's kind of crazy last time we had a\nconversation is that so many of the\nthings that science is telling us to do\nand that we emphasize on the podcast\nthis podcast you've been doing or are\nbuilt into military schedules and one of\nthem is this notion of waking up early\nand getting physical early in the day\nand I suppose if we were to just throw\none blanket rule on the table\nto Encompass the broadest number of\nthemes it's that once every 24 hours\nwe each and all get a big increase in\nthis release of the hormone cortisol\nwhich everyone says oh cortisol it's\nterrible you know he's going to burn you\nout adrenal burnout all that stuff\nbut it's a non-negotiable peak\nand you want it to arrive early in the\nday and viewing sunlight physical\nactivity caffeine and in particular\nintense exercise\nall amplify that cortisol peak in fact I\nthink it's the numbers I'm seeing is\njust sunlight viewing gives you a 50\nincrease in that course I'll exercise on\ntop of that another 50 to 75 increase so\nthis huge release in this hormone that\neveryone thinks is terrible but actually\nsets this huge wave in motion for the\nrest of the day\nwhich gives you more energy higher\nlevels of immune function more Focus Etc\nand does indeed as you mentioned in your\nexample of your daily life sets a timer\nso that about 14 to 16 hours later\nyou're sleepy which is what you want 14\nto 68 hours later unless of course\nyou're running vampire shifts in the\nmilitary or you're on shift work but\nmost people aren't of course so I think\nthe idea that movement and exercise\ngives us energy I think is an important\nidea and it's something that I was\nfrankly I was hoping your answer would\nbe that as opposed to that you know you\nwake up every day and you just want to\njust attack the world because you have\nso much energy getting out of bed\nbecause frankly I never feel that way\nbut I always feel better after I train\nalways and of course there are times\nwhen I crash in the early afternoon if I\ntrain really really hard but usually\nthat's when I over caffeinate to an\noutrageous degree and then I don't\nnourish after or I over nourish so this\nis the other thing that eating the whole\nrest and digesting the digest word in\nthere is meant to for there for a reason\nwhich is that when we eat a really big\nmeal we actually need to slow down so I\nhate to get into daily schedules at the\nlevel of nitpicking and nutrition is\nabout the most controversial topic on\nthe internet\num but do you nourish after you train\nand if you do do you do it to the point\nwhere you're kind of like okay I'm\nmostly full or I'm full are you trying\nto like really nourish yourself or do\nyou find that eating slows you down I\nfind that eating slows me down and I\nwould say again this it's weird how some\nof this stuff is like the main reason I\ngot in the habit of waking up early and\nworking out is because if you do it\nbefore anyone else is awake then they\ncan't bother you and you can get stuff\ndone right you go to the Seal team and\nyou get there before anyone else is\nthere no one can say hey can you help us\nwith this hey no one sent you an email\nso you get you get that time you get it\ndone and and it's yours right I remember\nwhen you were on my podcast and I don't\nwear sunglasses when I run in the\nmorning because I sweat and it fills my\nsunglasses it's not because I wanna let\nlet the UV light into my eyes that's not\ncortisol right it's not for the cortisol\nI didn't know that it's cool that I know\nit now but I just did it because I don't\nlike to sweat in my sunglasses can't see\nso I just run without and put a hat on\nuh as far as eating I don't like to do\nPhysically Active things with food in my\nstomach\nthat's just the way it is yeah I mean\nand so I don't wanna and what really\nkeeps that in line for me is I'm doing\nJiu Jitsu in the afternoon and so if I'm\neating a big lunch by the time the\nafternoon rolls around I'm kind of uh I\ngot food in my gut and I just don't like\nthat feeling so no I don't eat a big\nmeal until I'm kind of done with the\nphysical stuff for the day which is\nusually at night six seven o'clock at\nnight which I guess there's some bad\nthings about that I eat too late well\nthe data say you know if you're yeah\nthis we could go down a rabbit hole with\nthis and then someone's gonna pull up\nsome little clinical study and then\nanother one that counters that I mean I\nthink the data essentially say that\nhaving a regular meal schedule that\nallows you to sleep well at night\nwhatever that means for you and that\nallows you to be active and focused when\nyou need to be active and focused that's\nthe ideal schedule\nforeign\n[Music]"
