    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: You might have heard\nthat carrying your phone in your pocket\ncan reduce your testosterone\nlevels and sperm count.\nAnd, guess what? That is true.\nThe data contained within\nthis meta-analysis,\nand other meta-analysis clearly point out,\nthat it can reduce sperm count,\nand maybe testosterone\nlevels significantly.\nBut certainly, sperm count\nand motility significantly.\nIt reduces sperm quality.\nSo, should you avoid putting\nyour phone in your pocket?\nCertainly, your front pocket,\nI would suggest, yes, right,\nif you are somebody who is\nseeking to conceive, right?\nAnd then people say,\nwell, I don't actually\nfeel the heat of the phone.\nIt doesn't get that warm.\nBut the temperature effects\nof the phone, it turns out,\nare enough, even under conditions\nin which people don't report\nit to be uncomfortably warm,\nthat it can change the\ntemperature milieu of the testicle\nin ways that can diminish sperm quality.\nHow much, and how that relates\nto fertility and healthy pregnancy?\nNot clear.\nBut, since we're talking about\nthings to avoid if your goal\nis to have a healthy\nfertilization in pregnancy,\nwell then, by all means,\njust don't carry it in your front pocket."
