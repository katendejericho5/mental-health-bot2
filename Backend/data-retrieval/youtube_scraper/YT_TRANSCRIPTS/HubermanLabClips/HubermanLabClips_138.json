    "transcript": "being attached to the Past might be the\nworst thing that one could do in terms\nof being able to make good decisions in\nthis context because if we have a kind\nof a Playbook of what's worked and what\nhasn't worked but you actually talk\nabout this there's a passage in the book\nyou know that um I'll just read it\num to be aware of the assumption that\nthe way you work is the best way simply\nbecause it's the way you've done it\nbefore\nI sat with this page for almost 10 full\nminutes which is not something I do very\noften\nmaybe you could elaborate on this a\nlittle bit I mean we want to have you\nknow mechanisms and routines we can\ntrust but\nthis is a I think an important warning\nyeah when when something works\nit's easy to be fooled into believing\nthat's the way to do it or that's the\nright way\nit's just a way and it's just a way that\nhappened to work that time\nand this plays into when\nyou get a\nadvice from people who have more\nexperience than you\nyou explain your situation\nthey tell you their advice\nthe advice that they're giving you is\nnot based on your life or your\nexperience it's based on their life and\ntheir experience\nand the stories that they're telling are\nbased on experiences they've had\nthat are that have very different data\npoints than yours\nso\nmaybe they're giving you good advice but\nmaybe they're giving you good advice for\nthem\nand not giving you good advice for you\nand it's it's easy when we\ntry something and have a result a\npositive result thinking\nthis is everybody can do this\nyou know the way I I was vegan for a\nlong time 22 years and then I started\neating um\nI started eating animal protein\nand then\neventually change my change my diet a\nfew times to the point where I lost a\nlot of weight\nthe way that I did it worked for me\nright before that happened\nI did\nuh something that\nI was told that everyone else who did\nwhat you did they all lost weight for\nwhatever reason I didn't\nso\nthe idea that we know what's right for\nsomeone else I I think it's hard enough\nto even figure out what's right for\nourselves\nand if we do somehow Crack the Code of\nwhat's right for us\nbe happy we have it and then still know\nI wonder if that's the only way maybe\nthere's an even better way that we're\nnot considering you know like uh\nnot to get comfortable with thinking we\nknow how it works\njust because we get the outcome we want\nI was raised in science with a principle\nit was literally dictated to me as a\nprinciple almost like a rule of religion\nwhich was that the brain is plastic it\ncan change and learn until you're about\n25 and then the critical periods end and\nthat's it\nand this was a rule essentially it was\ndictated a Nobel Prize which was very\ndeserved given to my scientific great\ngrandparents they deserve it\num\nbut I was told there was no changing of\nbrain structure function in any\nmeaningful way after age 25 or so\nturns out that's completely wrong\nsorry David and Torrington but they knew\nit was wrong wow that's interesting yeah\nit was actively suppressed because of\nthe competitive nature of prizes and\ndiscoveries of that time and a guy named\nMike murzanek and his student\num Greg reckenzone were showing that\nadult plasticity exists\nand only now is this really starting to\nemerge as a theme right just crazy like\nthere were so many reasons and the\ntextbook said it we were all told it and\nit changed our Behavior\nnow we know this to be completely false\nthere's plasticity throughout the\nlifespan there's limits to it here and\nthere but like it's just Far and Away a\ndifferent story so why would that be the\nonly time that ever happened right\nexactly and and but the field was run by\na very small cabal of people at that\ntime those fields are run by a very\nsmall cabal people who have an\ninvestment in things being the way they\nare now right because they're in charge\nright and one of the great things about\ngetting older is that\num well fortunately everyone eventually\nages and I hope that you know David\nunfortunately passed away he was lovely\ntornson's lovely he's still alive and\nthey would say I think Torrington would\nsay yeah we should have been a little\nmore open or kind in allowing these\nother ideas but I think that but just\nthink about all the years that were\nwasted\nwith this\nmisunderstanding absolutely absolutely\nand and it went beyond that and there\nwere BBC specials that helped propagate\nthis and you know one of the goals of\nthe podcast has been to try and shed\nshine light on ideas that it first\nseemed crazy like I know you and I are\nboth um semi-obsessed with the health\nbenefits of light and you hear about\nthis stuff like negative ions therapy\nsounds crazy right sounds like something\nyou would only hear about at esselland\nor in Big Sur turns out negative\nionization therapy for sleep and mood is\nbased on really amazing work out of\nColombia by a guy named Michael Turman\nthe Nobel Prize I think it was in 1916\nwas given for phototherapy for the\ntreatment of lupus\nlike this idea that certain wavelengths\nof light can help treat medical\nconditions is not a new idea but somehow\nwe see a red light we're not used to\nseeing red lights except in sunsets and\non stop lights and somehow it bothers\npeople or it makes them feel like well\nit undermines a\num a business model that doesn't take\nred light into consideration right until\nit does and then it was and then it's\nco-opted there and the place what I Look\nto is acupuncture you know for a lot of\nyears people said well acupuncture this\nis like no mechanism no mechanism no\nMexico there's a lab at Harvard a guy\nnamed chufuma who I know reasonably well\nwhose laboratory is dedicated to trying\nto figure out the biological mechanisms\nof acupuncture and they are discovering\nwhat everyone has known for thousands of\nyears which is that incredible effects\non anti-inflammation the gut microbiome\nso uh I have a friend who was having a\nterrible back problem\nand I suggested that he see an\nacupuncturist\nand he went to the acupuncturists that I\nsuggested and his back problem\ncompletely healed almost instantaneously\nand I asked him you know have you been\nkeeping up because he had another\nanother flare-up he's like no I I can't\ngo back there because acupuncture\ndoesn't work I said well\nit you saw it work for you it's like\nyeah but there's no science\noh he's got it there is now there's good\nscience and published in Premier\njournals it you know what's interesting\nis this is a little bit of science\neditorial but since we like to exchange\ninformation about health and things of\nthat sort the editorial staff of a\njournal dictates what gets published and\nwhat doesn't and the premier journals\nhave a an outsized effect on what the\nmedia covers and so the beautiful thing\nis the journal staff now is of the age\nthat they grew up hearing about\nacupuncture hypnosis has a powerful\nclinical effect if it's done right\num Yoga Nidra and similar practices and\nso the tides are changing but I\nsometimes like to take a step back and\nthink what are we confronted with now\nthat seems crazy that in 10 years the\nkids that will be the because to me\ntheir kids will be Journal editors like\noh yeah absolutely\num you know I'm making this up but\nputting tuning Forks against your head\nor something like that like sound sound\nwave therapy\num I think when one adopts a stance of\nlike\nwe we have to filter everything through\nthe limitations of our biology but also\nthrough the the socio sociology of a\nlike the way culture goes it becomes a\ndifferent story how do you deal with\nthat not just in terms of of Health but\nin terms of\num\nthinking about anything it sounds like\nyou don't spend a whole lot of time\nthinking about what people are going to\nthink is cool or not no you're here at\nheart yes yes you still are yeah I can't\nI can't I just know what I like and what\nI don't I know it works for me and what\ndoesn't\nyou know I try things and I'm constantly\nlooking for new better solutions to\nanything and wherever they come from\ndoesn't matter it could come from it\ncould come from Stanford or it could\ncome from the guy talking to himself on\nthe street if it works I'm good you know\nit doesn't really matter to me at all I\nI don't hold um\nI don't hold any of it tightly\n[Music]\nthank you"
