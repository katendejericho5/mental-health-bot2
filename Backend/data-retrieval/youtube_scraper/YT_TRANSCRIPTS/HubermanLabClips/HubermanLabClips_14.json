    "transcript": "As I understand Alzheimer's\nis a neurodegenerative disorder,\nimpacts the hippocampus\namong other structures.\nThere's been some debate in recent years\nas to whether or not the\nwhole amyloid hypothesis\nis real or not.\nThere's a bunch of, unfortunately,\nfalse data accusations\nand that whole thing.\nBut my understanding is\nthat if you look at a slice\nof human brain from a patient\nthat died with Alzheimer's,\nmaybe even from Alzheimer's,\nthat you see plaques and tangles,\nyou see these subcellular structures\nand buildup and that our basic\nunderstanding of Alzheimer's\nthat's in the textbook and\nthat most people have heard of\nis still correct.\nRight? Okay.\nYes.\nBecause I think a couple\nyears ago it was, you know,\nunfortunately the way social\nmedia sometimes can work\nis that, you know, the idea\nwas that it was all wrong.\nYou know, all wrong.\nAnd indeed, somebody fudged\ndata, they made up data.\nAnd that's terrible.\nBut Alzheimer's is a\nneurodegenerative disorder,\nincludes the hippocampus.\nPlaques and tangles are\npresent in the neurons.\nThose are not good for\nneurons as I understand.\nSo what's the controversy like,\nand why don't we have a\ntreatment for Alzheimer's yet?\nI feel like almost every\nother psychiatric disease,\nincluding Parkinson's,\nthere are certain things you can do\nto at least push the\nsystem in the right way.\nWhy is Alzheimer's and\nother dementia so tricky?\nYeah, I mean, it's very frustrating\nbecause the neurodegenerative\ndisorders, it's just,\nit's so many factors\nthat are probably\ninvolved in the pathology,\nthat there's not one single transmitter.\nThe Parkinson's disease,\nit's a decreased dopamine.\nAnd so one transmitter can\nmake a very big difference.\nEarly on in Alzheimer's, it was discovered\nthat there was low\nacetylcholine in the brains,\nand the only approved treatment\nfor Alzheimer's disease\nis a drug that boosts acetylcholine.\nWhat's the drug?\nIt's called donepezil.\nThere's a few of 'em.\nThey're anticholinesterase inhibitors\nthat boost acetylcholine.\nThey've been around for 20 years or more.\nAnd you know, the reality\nis when you give it\nto your patients, they don't\nsee much of a difference\nbecause it's not the primary deficit.\nSo the real problem has\nbeen trying to find out\nwhat is the primary mechanism\nthat's leading to this,\nthe wide range of cognitive\nbehavioral issues.\nAnd there doesn't seem\nto be at least one neurotransmitter\nthat can make the difference.\nAnd so now the push\nhas been, is there one,\nis there something else that we can do?\nCan we block amyloid?\nCan we block something in the pathology?\nAnd again, it just has\nnot been successful.\nIt's very frustrating\n'cause I think it was over\nprobably 35 years ago,\nI saw my first Alzheimer's patients\nand I don't believe I say that\nmuch different to them now,\nyou know, except that we have\na lot more things we can do\njust on the social side of things.\nBut unfortunately for drugs,\nwe don't have anything\nthat's been really transformative.\nBut again, that's, I think part of a,\nand being a neurologist,\nit sounds very depressing,\nbut I think part of what the family\nisn't always looking for a cure.\nOf course that's, they'd\nlike to have a cure,\nbut I think them\nunderstanding what's going on,\nwhat to expect, how to\nhandle the behaviors\nis what they're really after,\nat least until we find, you know, a cure.\nParkinson's you mentioned\nis a deficit in dopaminergic\nfunction due largely to degeneration\nof dopaminergic neurons.\nThere, there's some\neffective treatments, right?\nL-DOPA.\nDid you know there's this\nover the counter stuff\nthat's sold that a lot of people take\nwho don't have Parkinson's?\nI'm not suggesting they take it.\nCalled Mucuna pruriens.\nIt's the velvety bean.\nYeah, I've heard of it.\nIt's 99% l-DOPA.\nI've heard of it, yeah.\nIt's present in like some\nenergy drinks and supplements.\nI mean, people can go buy it.\nI'm not suggesting they do that.\nI actually tried it.\nBoy, you feel,\nbeing really dopamined out does not,\nto me doesn't feel that good.\nYeah, I felt kind of agitated.\nMy vision got a little, you know, twinkly,\nit did not feel like a high of any kind.\nAnd then I felt lousy for a\ncouple hours after it wore off.\nYeah, I don't think you can\nreally get in enough l-DOPA\nto get enough into your brain,\nthat happened early in\nneurology when it was discovered\nwe couldn't give our\npatients enough l-DOPA\nwithout them feeling bad\nbecause it's also\nmetabolized in the periphery.\nAnd so it wasn't until\nwe Sinemet came along,\nwhich has this decarboxylase inhibitor\nthat blocks sort of the\nbreakdown of dopamine\nthat we were able to sort of get\nenough dopamine into the brain.\nSo I'm not sure, so that's why I think\nit's not going to probably\nget the levels up high\nenough in the brain.\nSo Parkinson's patients are given l-DOPA\nor bromocriptine or drugs like that.\nGoing back to Alzheimer's for a moment.\nI mean, what do you tell somebody\nwho has early stage Alzheimer's?\nYou just say, \"Listen,\ntry and get good sleep.\nTry and keep people around\nyou, stay cognitively engaged.\nTry and keep those circuits going\nthrough behavioral\ninduced neuroplasticity.\"\nBut we're just going\nto watch the steepness\nof the decline.\nIs that really all we've got?\nAll we've got is such, yeah.\nIs to help them with everything\nthat comes up on a day-to-day basis.\nA lot of the problems, the\nmemory problems tend to be\nsomething that families\ncan help compensate for.\nBut you do get to a\npoint where you can't be\nwith someone for 24/7.\nIt's a real burnout for caregivers.\nA lot of the behaviors that come up,\npatients get kind of\ndelusions and agitated,\nand some of the medications that we use\nfor other conditions are\nhelpful for treating that.\nBut it's really just a\npurely symptomatic therapy.\nAnd the more socialization\nthat patients get,\nthey tend to do better.\nThere was a study back\nat Penn way back that\nif you showed patients some family movies\nor family albums,\nit was better than any\ndrug you could give them\nto sort of help their behavior.\nSo there's still those\nmemories that are in there\nand they were making\nsome type of contact that\nwas helping them emotionally\nthat you couldn't turn off with a drug.\nSo I think the more we\ndo things like that,\nthe more will be helpful for them,\nat least in a, you know, symptomatically.\nYeah, I've seen a number of videos\non social media of people\nwith Alzheimer's who\nlisten to a piece of music\nor people with Parkinson's\nthat hear a piece of music.\nAnd that seems to resurrect some, at least\ncontext appropriate emotional state\nwhere it kind of brings the\nperson to the surface again.\nYeah, it's a kind of a tragic situation\nfor Alzheimer's right now.\nIt seems like if ever\nthere was a call to arms\nfor the neurology community and biotech\nand behavioral tech\nwould be for Alzheimer's,\nfor the treatment of Alzheimer's.\nYeah, absolutely.\nI will never ask a guest to comment\non the good or bad behaviors\nof other people except my own.\nBut there's a Nobel Prize\nwinning neuroscientist\nand I visited him.\nHe's in a big east coast\nschool back in 2010.\nAnd during the course\nof our one hour meeting,\nhe consumed no fewer than\nfour pieces of Nicorette gum.\nAnd I said, \"I got to\nask, what's this about?\"\nBy the way, he's extremely sharp still.\nAnd he said, \"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.\nYou know, I used to be a smoker,\nbut smoking's really bad for you\n'cause you can get lung cancer,\ndipping's bad for you 'cause\nyou can get mouth cancer,\nbut nicotine,\" these are\nhis words by the way,\n\"is protective against\nParkinson's and Alzheimer's.\nAnd it keeps my brain sharp.\nSo I chew Nicorette all day long.\"\nAnd I thought, \"Okay, well he's\nnot,\" he is an MD actually.\nAnd I thought, \"Oh, that's interesting.\"\nAnd I did an episode of\nthis podcast on nicotine.\nIt, by the way, can raise blood pressure.\nIt's certainly smoking,\nvaping, dipping or snuffing.\nNot good, bad, don't do it.\nBut there is some interest\nin the use of nicotine\nas a cognitive enhancer.\nSo I'd love to know your thoughts on that\nand I'd love to know your\nthoughts on his statement about\nnicotine being a potential\nway to stave off Parkinson's\nand Alzheimer's,\nwith the caveat that he just\nkind of threw that out there\nand this guy's sort of known\nfor just kind of throwing stuff out there.\nEvery once in a while.\nI have a feeling you\nknow who this person is,\nbut in any event, what gives?\nYeah, well, I don't know\nanything about nicotine\nstaving off any\nneurodegenerative disorder,\nbut nicotine was used in a number\nof early Alzheimer's studies\njust because of its effect\non the cholinergic system.\nSo there is some truth to that.\nThe cholinergic system is, you know,\ndysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease,\nand boosting the cholinergic\nsystem probably is beneficial.\nI mean, the patients that we\ngive the anticholinesterase\ninhibitors, there are\nsome families that say,\n\"Yeah, he just, he's remembering more\nand he's just doing better.\"\nSo I've seen positive things to it.\nIt doesn't really slow\nthe course of the disease,\nthat's the problem.\nThe disease just carries\non even though we're\nsymptomatically improving the symptoms.\nBut again, I think it's going\nto take both acetylcholine\nand something else.\nI think we don't know,\nshould we give dopamine\nwith the nicotine or the acetylcholine?\nOr should we give norepinephrine,\nI think it's going to be\na cocktail, which again,\npharmaceutical companies, you know,\nhave not tried a cocktail\nof neuromodulators for\nAlzheimer's disease.\nThey've just tried acetylcholine.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
