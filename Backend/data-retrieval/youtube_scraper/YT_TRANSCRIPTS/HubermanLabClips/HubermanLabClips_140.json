    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: When something\nfeels creatively right,\nand you're sensing\nit, and you're there,\nlet's say in the\nstudio or maybe even\nyou're listening to something\nthat somebody sent you,\nhow do you translate that,\ngiven the absence of language?\nHow do you translate that into\na conversation with the artist?\nAnd again, this could be about\nwriting or comedy or science\nor podcasting, for that matter.\nHow do you say that,\nkeep going that way,\nwhen they might not even\nrecognize that they did it?\nAnd I'm guessing a lot\nof times, they don't.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nSometimes, they don't.\nIt depends.\nWhen we're in the--\nI'll try to be in\na setting where,\nas we're talking\nabout it, we can\nengage with it in that moment.\nSo it's not much good.\nLet's say I was producing\nyour new record,\nand you played me something, and\nI had some thoughts about it.\nIt wouldn't be so helpful for\nme to tell you what those were.\nIt'd be better for us to\nwait till we were in a place\nwhere we could try things\nand see where it goes.\nSo the first thing is I wouldn't\nrely on language to do it.\nIt would be more of making a\nsuggestion of something that's\nactionable.\nWe try it, and then\nwe have more data.\nAnd either we're moving\nin a good direction,\nor we're moving away from--\nwe're moving towards it or away\nfrom it, and we never know.\nAnd so it's always\nan experiment.\nAnd maybe a simple way to\ntalk about it would be like,\nif I gave you two\ndishes of food and asked\nyou to taste them and tell\nme which one you like better.\nUsually, it's pretty\nstraightforward,\nwhen you have two choices,\nwhich you like better,\nand I think most creativity\ncan be boiled down to that.\nThat's very different\nthan I wonder\nhow this is going to perform on\ncertain social media platforms?\nThat's different\nthan what is it--\nwhen I'm tasting these two\nthings, which is the one I\nwant to finish eating?\nAnd if I were to say,\nI like this one better,\nbut it needs a little salt, and\nthen put a little salt on it.\nIt's like, maybe I\nput too much salt,\nand you know when you taste it.\nIt's like it's that simple.\nBeing in tune enough\nwith ourselves\nto really know how we feel\nin the face of knowing\nthat other people might\nfeel very differently,\nwhich is part of the challenge.\nIt's like, if everyone\ntells you A, A, A, A, A, A,\nand you listen, and you're\nlike that's B, as an artist,\nit's important to be able\nto say, to me, it's B.\nAnd it's a disconnect,\nbecause so much of,\nwhen we go to school, it's to\nget us to follow the rules.\nAnd in art, it's different,\nbecause the rules are there\nas a scaffolding to be\nchipped away, as need be.\nSometimes, they're helpful.\nSometimes, they're not,\nand sometimes, we'll\neven impose our own rules\nto give something its shape.\nSo we can decide to make a--\nwe're going to make a painting,\nbut we're only going\nto use green and red\nare the only colors\nwe're allowed to use.\nWe decide that in\nadvance, and then how\ndo we solve the problem knowing\nall we have is green and red?\nIt can-- because\notherwise, if there's\nan infinite number of choices,\nanything can be anything.\nIt's like, sometimes more\nchoices is not better.\nSo limiting your palate\nto something manageable\nforces you to solve\nproblems in a different way.\nNow, in our digital\nage music-wise,\nyou can make anything digitally.\nThere's no-- there\nwas a time when,\nif you didn't have a\nguitar in the studio,\nyou couldn't record guitar.\nOr if you couldn't\nhire an orchestra,\nthere couldn't be orchestra\non your recording.\nNow, you can just call\nany of those things up.\nSo there's infinite choices,\nand infinite choices\ndon't necessarily lead to\nbetter compositions or better\nfinal works.\nUnderstanding how you feel\nin the face of other voices,\nwithout second\nguessing yourself,\nis probably the single\nmost important thing\nto practice as an artist.\nOr a skill set to develop as\nan artist is to I know how you\nfeel, and own your feelings.\nAnd the key to\nthat is not I know,\nso I know what's right for you.\nIt doesn't work that way.\nIt's just I know for me, and the\nreason I chose to be an artist\nis to demonstrate\nthis is how I see it.\nIf I'm undermining my taste\nfor some commercial idea,\nit defeats the whole\npurpose of doing this.\nThat's not what this\nprocess is about.\nThis process is I'm doing me,\nand I'm showing you who I am.\nAnd you can like it or\nnot, but either way, this\nis still how I see it.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
