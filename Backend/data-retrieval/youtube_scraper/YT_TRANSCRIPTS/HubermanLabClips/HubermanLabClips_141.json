    "transcript": "I was going to ask you\nwhether or not it's important\nto be happy in order to create\nbut certainly a lot of\npeople that were unhappy\nwere still able to create.\nBut the more I listen to you,\nit seems that it's really about\nan ability to pay attention.\nYes.\nSo if I'm unhappy or if I'm happy,\nmay not be as relevant as\nwhether or not I'm able\nto stay undistracted.\nYes, I would say being\nable to stay present\nin the work is probably the\nmost important part of it."
