    "transcript": "this may seem like a Divergence but\nI and many other people are very curious\nabout a recent decision that you made\nwhich was to close your account\non Twitter\num\nyou still have an Instagram account I\nnoticed but although I never I mean my\nteam manages that I've never I love\nfriendlier over at Instagram I've been\nthere a lot I've never even see it seen\nit so oh it's pretty good actually\nconsidering imagine what would happen if\nyou did yeah they're doing a good job\nwith it\num but your decision to close your\naccount on Twitter\num I think grabbed a lot of eyes and\nears and there's a lot of questions\nabout why it was a very large account\nyou know\num it correlated with a number of things\nthat for the outsider people might be\nwondering about\num you know new leadership uh new you\nknow people who had been booted off\nbrought back on or at least invited back\non right and so on uh you are certainly\nnot obligated to explain your behavior\nto me uh or anybody else for that matter\nbut I'm curious if you might share with\nus\num what the motivation was\num for taking the account down and and\nhow you feel in the absence of uh I mean\nyour thumbs presumably are are freed up\nto do other things yeah I was getting\nlike an arthritic right thumb I think\nand I think if you don't mind sharing I\nthink there's a there's a lot of\ncuriosity about you and your your\nroutines you've been very generous in\nsharing that your knowledge\num and but also kind of like what what\nmakes what makes you tick what motivates\num pretty big decisions like that it\nwasn't a major platform for for you\nright yeah yeah it was it was the only\nsocial media platform I've ever engaged\nI mean like you said we I have an\nInstagram I have a Facebook account but\nI never never used those as platforms\nright I'm not never on them I never\nthought I've never followed people and\nI've never and all the posting has just\ncome from it's just marketing you know\nfrom my team\num\nbut Twitter was me I mean you know for\nbetter or worse and um I began to feel\nmore and more for worse and it was um it\nwas interesting because it was very\nyou know I I've you know I've talked\nabout it a lot on my podcast about just\nmy my love-hate relationship with\nTwitter over the years many good things\ncame to me from Twitter and I was you\nknow I was following a lot of smart\npeople and it had become my\nnews feed and my first point of contact\nwith with information each day and I was\nreally attached to it just for that\nreason just as a consumer of of content\num\nand then it was also a place where I was\nI genuinely wanted to communicate with\npeople and react to things and and you\nknow you know I would see some article\nthat I thought was great I would signal\nboost it you know to my\nthe people following me on Twitter and\nthat was rewarding and I was I could\nliterally help people on Twitter like I\nmean there was a there were you know\nthere are people who I've raised lots of\nmoney for on Twitter just by you know\nsignal boosting their gofundme's and and\nuh so I was engaged in a way that seemed\nproductive\num\nbut I was always worried that it was\nproducing needless Conflict for me and\nwas was giving me a signal in my life\nthat I was being lured into responding\nto and taking seriously that was out of\nproportion to its its representation of\nany opinion or set of opinions that I\nshould be taking seriously\nso I was noticing that that um again\nthis evolved over years I mean this this\nlong before a long long\npredated recent changes to Twitter uh\nbut I was noticing that many of the\nworst things that had happened for me\nprofessionally were first born on\nTwitter I mean just like you know some\nsome conflict I got into with somebody\nor something that I felt like I needed\nto podcast about in response to on\nTwitter\num\nit's just so much of it it's either it's\nGenesis was Twitter or it's the the\nuh the further spin of it that became\ntruly unpleasant and dysfunctional\nhappened on Twitter like it was just\nTwitter was part of the story when it\nwas got really bad and I've I've had\nyou know vacations that have gone\nsideways just because I got on Twitter\nand said something and then I had to\nproduce a controversy that I had to\nrespond to and then I had to do a\npodcast about that and Bob and just and\nit was just okay this is a mess right\nand so at that point you know I you know\nhave\nfriends who you know also had big\nTwitter platforms who would who would\nsay you know why are you you know why\nare you responding to anything on\nTwitter just tweet and ghost you know\njust due to heaven like Joe Rogan set me\ndown and tried to get get you know give\nme a talking to I said Bill Moore\num\nand both of them engaged Twitter in that\nway I mean I think they basically never\nlook at their ad mentions they never see\nwhat's coming back at them they just you\nknow they use it effectively the way I\nuse or don't even use Instagram or\nFacebook I mean I don't even see what's\ngoing out there in in my name\num and so I I could essentially do that\nfor myself on Twitter presumably and I\ndid that for some periods of time but\nthen I would continually decide okay now\nit's all balanced again maybe I can just\ncommunicate here because it was very\ntempting for me to communicate with\npeople because I would see somebody\nyou know clearly misunderstanding\nsomething I had said on my podcast and I\nthink it's like why not clarify this\nmisunderstanding right and then and my\nefforts to do that almost invariably\nproduced\na um\nthis I mean sometimes it was a kind of a\nMeandering uh process of of Discovery\nbut often it was just kind of a stark\nconfrontation with what appeared to me\nto be just\nlunacy and malevolence on a scale that I\nnever encounter elsewhere in my life\nlike I've never meet these people in\nlife right and yet\nI was meeting these people by the tens\nof thousands on Twitter and so it was\nthe thing that began to worry me about\nit\nand again this I understand that people\nhave\nthe opposite experience depending on\nwhat you're putting out and what you're\nyou know the kinds of topics you're\ntouching you could have just nothing but\nlove coming back at you on Twitter right\nuh but\nbecause I'm very essentially in the\ncenter politically and because I'm you\nknow this is now on my podcast this is\nnot in the waking up app I'm often\ncriticizing the far left and criticizing\nthe far right\nI'm basically pissing off everyone some\nof the time right so and it's very\ndifferent if you're only criticizing the\nleft\nyou hate no doubt you get hate from the\nleft but you have all the people on the\nright who just reflexively and tribally\nare are expressing their solidarity for\nyou right and who are who are dunking on\nyour enemies for you and you know when\nwhen your enemies come out of the\nwoodwork and if you're only criticizing\nthe right I'm sure you get a lot of pain\nfrom the right but you've got the people\non the left who are tribally identified\nwith the left who are who are just going\nto reflexively defend you if you're in\nthe center\ncriticizing the left as hard as anyone\non the right ever criticized criticizes\nthe left and you're also criticizing the\nright as hard as anyone on the left\ncriticizes the right\nyou're getting hate from both sides all\nthe time and no one is reflected\nreflexively and tribally defending you\nbecause you pissed them off last time\nlike you might be getting hate from the\nleft now and the people on the right\nagree with you but they can't forget the\nthing you said about Trump on that\npodcast you know you know two podcasts\nago so they're not going to defend you\nand so what I well I basically created\nhell for myself on Twitter because it\nwas um\nI just you know it was just a theater of\nit was just pure cacophony most of the\ntime and\nwhat I was seeing was I mean like\nthere's no way there's this many\npsychopaths in the world but I was\nseeing Psychopaths everywhere I was\nseeing like the most malicious\ndishonesty and uh you know just goal\npost moving and hypocrisy and and I mean\nit was just I mean some of his trolling\nand some of it's real confusion and some\nof it is psychopathy but it's like it\nwas so dark\nthat um\nI worried that it was actually giving me\na a very negative and sticky\nview of\nHumanity that was\nI mean one it was you know I think it is\nan inaccurate\nbut two I I it was it was something I\nwas returning to so much because again I\nwas checking Twitter you know\nat least a dozen times a day and I'm\nsure there were some days where I\nchecked it 100 times a day I mean it was\nit was again it was my main source of\ninformation I was constantly reading\narticles and and then putting my own\nstuff out\num\nthat it became this kind of fun house\nmirror in which I was looking at the the\nmost grotesque side of of humanity and\nfeeling\nit you know implicated in in ways that\nwere important important because it was\njust it was reputationally important or\nseemed to be important\num I know a lot of these people it's not\nthese weren't just faceless trolls these\nare these are people with whom I have\nhad relationships and in some cases\nfriendships who because of what you know\nlargely Trump and covid did to our\npolitical landscape in the last you know\nhalf a dozen years\num\nwe're beginning to act in ways that that\nseemed you know starkly dishonest and\nand you know crazy making to me so I was\njust noticing that I was forming a view\nof people who I actually have had dinner\nwith\nthat was way more negative based on\ntheir Twitter Behavior than I think\nwould ever be justified by any way they\nwould behave in life with me you know I\nmean it's like never I was never going\nto have a face-to-face encounter with\nany of these people that was this\nmalicious and dishonest and gaslighting\nand weird right as as was what was\nhappening hourly on Twitter right and so\nI just began to become more sensitive to\nwhat this was you know just the residue\nof all this in my life and how and just\nhow often\nthe worst thing that the worst thing\nabout me in my relationship with the\npeople in my life you know they're just\ntalking to my wife or my kids was just\nthe fact that I had been on Twitter at\nsome point in the you know previously in\nthe previous hour and there was some\nresidue of that you know if you know in\nmy interaction with them you know I was\nlike what you know what are you stressed\nout about what are you annoyed about\nwhat are you pissed off about you know\nwhat can't you get out of your head\num what is the thing that you now feel\nlike you need to spend the next week of\nyour life focused on because it went so\nsideways for you all of that was Twitter\nyou know a little I mean literally a\nhundred percent of that was Twitter and\nand so\num I just at one point it was actually\non Thanksgiving day I just looked at\nthis I just just I mean there was very\nlittle thought went into it I mean\nliterally I mean I you know there was\nmore thought in involved than you you\nknow you know whether I wanted coffee\nwhen you asked me when I showed up here\nI mean it was just like at a certain\npoint I just I just saw it and I just I\njust ripped the Band-Aid off and and\nyeah so um and to answer your other\nquestion it's been almost wholly\npositive as you might expect given the\nthe Litany of of uh pain and discomfort\nI just ran through but\num\nI mean it's also it's it's it's\nsurprising to recognize how much of a\npresence it was in my life\ngiven the sense of what is now missing I\nmean it's like there there's it was\nthere's no question there was a there's\na kind of an addictive component to it\nand when you see I mean like when I look\nat what elon's doing on Twitter forget\nabout his ownership of it and I mean I'm\nnot you know I've got a lot to say about\nyou know the choices he's making uh for\nthe platform but just his personal use\nof it is just so obviously an expression\nof I mean I don't know if addiction is\nthe you know clinically appropriate\num term but\nyou know his dysfunctional attachment to\ntweet to using the platform forget it\nagain again forget about changing it and\nowning it but just hit the just the\ndegree to which it is pointlessly\ndisrupting the life of one of the most\nproductive people in any Generation\nUm\nUh I that was also instructive to me\nbecause I know Elon and I I just you\nknow um he's okay\nfrom my you know of kind of a friend's\neye view of the situation is so\nobviously not good for him that he's\nspending this much time on Twitter\num that uh I I just brought that back to\nme it's like well if it's not if this is\nwhat it's doing to Elon and he's got all\nthese other things he could be doing\nwith his attention\nhow much of my use of Twitter is\nactually you know a good idea and you\nknow optimized to my well-being and the\nwell-being of the people around me\num\nso anyway it was there was an addictive\ncomponent to it I think and so when that\ngot stripped off\nI you know I I do notice that there's I\nmean there's some there are times I pick\nup my phone\nand I realize this is like the old me\npicking up my phone for for a reason\nthat no longer exists because there's\nnot that much I you know I you know I\nhave a slack Channel with my team and\nI've got email obviously but\nit's like that is\nnot much of what I was doing with my\nphone really in the end and so like it's\njust my phone is much less of a presence\nin my life and and so it's it's almost\nwholly good but\num\nyeah it's you know there's I think there\nis some danger in\nor some some a possible danger in losing\ntouch with certain aspects of culture\nwhich again I'm not even sure I mean\nthere's this question of you know how\nmuch is Twitter real life and how much\nis it just a mass delusion I don't know\nbut insofar as it actually matters what\nhappens on Twitter\num or insofar as I was actually getting\na news diet which I'm not going to be\nable to recapitulate for myself or I'm\njust not in fact going to recapitulate\nfor myself even if I could\num\nif any of that matters I haven't\ndiscovered that yet but it's yeah I mean\nthere's it was taking up an immense\namount of bandwidth and it's it's\nimpressive I mean I I think I said I I\nyou know it's like I amputated a a\nphantom limb right like it was not a\nreal limb but it was it was a this\ncontinuous presence in my life that um\nthat uh it is it's weird it actually\nrelates to the concept of Self in in\nsurprising ways because I felt\nthere was a part of myself that existed\non Twitter\nand I you know I I just performed a\nsuicide of that self rather like that's\nthis is ending right now and you know\nthere's no residue there's nothing to go\nback and check there's just it's gone I\nand I didn't even I didn't go back and\nlook at my like what's interesting to\nconsider is that you know I've been on\nTwitter for 12 years\nI don't keep a journal I mean Twitter\nwhat in my timeline would have been a\nkind of Journal I could have gone back\nto a specific hour in a specific day and\nlooked at what I was paying attention to\nI mean that could have been an\ninteresting record of just who I've been\nfor a decade and I and probably a pretty\nhumbling record of who I've been for a\ndecade\num in terms of the kinds of things that\ncaptivated my attention but\nI didn't even you know I didn't even\nthink to go in the state you know\nnostalgically just look at any of that\nor see if any of it was worth saving or\narchiving or thinking I just just\ndelete you know and it was um\nuh and so my my actual sense of who I am\nand my engagement with with\nmy audience my you know the the world of\npeople who could potentially know me\nlike what does it mean to be to have a\nplatform you know where do I exist\ndigitally\nmy sense of of all of that got truncated\nin a in a way that um\nis much less noisy I mean it's amazing\nhow much\ncan't get [ __ ] up now in my life like\nit's like with Twitter\nalmost anything could happen right like\nlike the next tweet was always an\nopportunity to massively complicate my\nlife there is no analogous space for me\nnow and you know so what I'm going to\nsay on your podcast what I'm going to\nsay on my own podcast what I'm going to\nwrite next that's much more\num\nyou know uh deliberative and uh the\nopportunities to take my foot out of my\nmouth or to reconsider all you know\nwhether anything any of this is worth it\nis it worth is this the hill I really\nwant to die on now\num it's much more um can be much more\nconsidered and\nI mean I think all of that's to the good\num but even more important than that is\nthere's not\nI'm not getting this continuous signal\nthat is always inviting a response\nwhether on Twitter or on my own podcast\nor you know anywhere else\num\nand\nit's just much less noisy I mean life is\nmuch less noisy and and cluttered and\nthat's you know that that is it\ndefinitely feels better right just\nthat's 100 better\n[Music]"
