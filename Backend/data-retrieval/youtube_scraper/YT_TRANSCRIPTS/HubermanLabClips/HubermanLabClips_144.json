    "video_title": "The Utility of Psychedelics | Dr. Sam Harris & Dr. Andrew Huberman",
    "transcript": "could you tell us why psychedelics\ncan be useful and here I'll give the\ncaveats that maybe you'll feel obligated\nto give as well but this we're talking\nabout you safely and responsibly\nage-appropriate context appropriate\nideally with some clinical or other type\nof guidance legality issues obeyed Etc\nall that stated it was psychedelics to\nme are an experience of\naltered perception internal and external\nperception altered space-time\nrelationship somewhat dreamlike I think\nit was Alan Hobson at Harvard for a long\ntime talked about the relationship\nbetween psychedelic-like states and\ndreamlike States\num because of this Distortion of\nspace-time dimensionality and\nI haven't uh experimented with them much\num I've been part of a clinical trial\nthree doses of MDMA which certainly\naltered my the the quality of my\nconscious experience in ways that led to\na lot of lasting and at least for me\nvaluable learning yeah so what are your\nwhat are your thoughts about\npsychedelics in terms of how they\nintersect with the discussion that we've\nbeen having\nand um what utility do they play in\nrecognition of the self or in other\nsorts of brain changes\nwell so uh yeah okay let's just price in\nall those caveats that people can\nanticipate\num\nthese drugs are not without their risks\nand it's it's one problem is that we\nhave\nthis single term drugs or psychedelics\nwhich names many different types of\nsubstances and they're not all the same\nand they're not so like MDMA is not even\ntechnically a psychedelic I think it has\nan immense therapeutic value and it\nactually was my gateway drug to the this\nthis whole\narea of concern uh phetamine pathogen\nright it's a sort of an amphetamine and\na pathogen yeah yeah I mean it's often\ncalled pathogens yeah and a pathogens\nyeah not pathogen pathogen yeah and a\npathogen or an antactogen it's it's been\ncalled\num but it doesn't tend to change\nperception in the way that classic\npsychedelics do and it's it's also\nserotonergic but it's it's not\num\nuh it has to be in some part differently\nso than me even LSD and psilocybin which\nare much more similar in classic\npsychedelics both are also serotonergic\nbut they're not merely so and they're\nthey're also different\num and the and the higher dose you take\nof these drugs the more you at lower\ndoses everything can kind of seem the\nsame at higher doses they you know they\nthey begin to diverge\num\nand we can talk about the the uh\npharmacology if you wanted to but\num\nthe uh\nI would just say that for many of us I\nmean certainly for me psychedelics were\nindispensable in the beginning in\nproving to me that this was\nuh the the the the first person\ninterrogation of the Mind was worth\ndoing you know because I was somebody\nwho you know age\n17 or 18 before I had any real\nexperience with um\nwith MDMA or LSD or psilocybin\num if you had taught me how to meditate\nat that point I think I would have just\nbounced off the whole project I think my\nmind was I I was just I was so\num cerebral in my just my engagement\nwith anything I was so skeptical of\nany of the the spiritual the religious\nand spiritual Traditions that that have\ngiven us most of our meditation talk you\nknow\num\nthat I think I just would have\num I I know many of these people like I\nyou know I have I have tried to teach\nyou know Richard Dawkins to meditate and\nDaniel Dennett to meditative I've\nambushed them with meditation and very\nyou know both both in a group setting\nand one-on-one uh not not Dan but uh but\nRichard I I ambushed on my own podcast\nwith a guided meditation\nand\nhe just you know\nfrom his he you know he closes his eyes\nhe looks inside and there's nothing of\ninterest to see right like it's just\nit's like it's not he doesn't have the\nthe\num\nthe conceptual interest in him that\nwould that would cause him to to persist\nlong enough to find out that there's a\nthere there right now\nthis is not a problem with LSD or\npsilocyb under MDMA and I know that if I\ngave him 100 micrograms of LSD or five\ngrams of of mushrooms or you know 20 25\nmilligrams of psilocybin\num\nthat's probably not the analogous dosage\nto the five grams of mushrooms five\ngrams of mushrooms would be more than\nthat\num\nuh I forget what it is of uh of MDMA\nmaybe 120 milligrams I think the maps\ndoses uh which is the one that's under\nclinical trials is 125 milligrams with\nan option of a 75 milligram booster\nright right funny I will remember\nstrange the facts that come to hand\num but uh\nthere's no there's just no possibility\nthat nothing's going to happen right now\nsomething with with a psychedelic with\nMDMA most people tend to have certainly\nunder any kind of guidance tend to have\na very uh positive you know pro-social\nexperience\num\nbut you know with a psychedelic you\nmight have a a a\nsomewhat you know terrifying experience\nif you have quote a bad trip you know\nand I've certainly had those experiences\non on LSD and and to some degree in\npsilocybin\nbut\num\nthe prospect that nothing is going to\nhappen is just\nin you know a million you know nearly a\nmillion cases out of a million just not\nin the cards I mean just just\nneurophysiologically something's going\nto happen with the requisite dose of of\none of these drugs\nand if if that thing that happens is\nis psychologically at all normative and\nyou know Pleasant and interesting and\nvaluable which it is so much of the time\nand certainly under the appropriate you\nknow set and setting and and guidance\num it can be you know a lot of the time\nfor\nyou know virtually everybody again there\nare caveats if you if you're prone if\nyou think you have you know proclivity\nfor schizophrenia or you know bipolar\ndisorder\nthis is almost certainly not for you you\nknow and anyone doing a the the studies\nat like Johns Hopkins for for um\nthe therapeutic effects of of any of\nthese drugs they're they're ruling out\npeople with you know first degree\nrelatives with with any of these\nclinical conditions\num\nbut so for somebody like me at 18\nwho didn't know that this was an area of\nof not only interest but would it be\nthat you know the the center of gravity\nfor the rest of his life if only he\ncould pay attention clearly enough to\nsee that it could be right\num I was someone who very likely again I\ndon't know I don't have the counter\nfactual in hand I don't know what would\nhave happened if if someone had you know\nforced me to meditate for an hour at\nthat point but\nI know I wasn't interested in it until I\ntook MDMA\num\nI know I wasn't having these kinds of\nexperiences spontaneously that get that\nshowed me that there was an inner\nlandscape that was worth exploring\num I was a very hard-headed skeptic who\nwas very interested in lots of things\nbut there was no alternative to me just\nthinking more about those things right I\nmean the idea that there's some other\nway of grasping cognitively at the\ninteresting parts of the world\nBeyond thinking about the world right I\njust that just wouldn't have computed\nfor me at all right and if you had so I\njust I and I literally have I had no one\never gave me a book to read or an ever\nhad I don't if you the noun meditation\nvery likely meant absolutely nothing to\nme before before I uh took my first dose\nof in this case it was MDMA\num so what the drug experience did for\nme is it just proved yeah so the the\nlimit one of the limitations of a drug\nis that you know obviously no matter how\ngood the experience the drug wears off\nand then you're back to you know more in\nmore or less your usual form\nand now you have a memory of the\nexperience and it can be a fairly dim\nmemory I mean some of these experiences\nare so discontinuous with normal waking\nconsciousness\nthat it can be like trying to remember a\ndream you know that just disappeared it\ndegrades you know over the course of\nseconds and then it could have been the\nmost intense dream you've ever had and\nfor whatever reason you can barely get a\npurchase on you know what it was about\nand\num\nyou know there's some psychedelic\nexperiences that are analogous to that\nbut\nfor most people most of the time there's\na residue of this experience and with\nsomething like MDMA they can be quite\nquite Vivid\num\nwhere you recognize okay there there was\na way of being that is quite different\nthan what I'm tending to access by\ndefault and it is different in\nin\nways that are just uh\nyou know obviously better and and\npsychologically more healthy I mean it's\npossible to be healthy psychologically\nin a way that I I never imagined right\nand that then when you be then when you\nlink it up to the traditional literature\naround any of this stuff again so much\nof it is\nshot through with with Superstition and\nother worldliness of of religion and you\nknow as as you know and I think you're\nyou're listening listeners probably know\nI've spent a lot of time criticizing all\nthat but there is a baby in the bath\nwater to all of that right it's like\nit's it's not that\nsomebody like Jesus or the Buddha or any\nof the matriarchs and Patriarchs of the\nworld's religions it's not that they are\nwe're all conscious frauds or you know\ntemporal lobe epileptics or like there's\nthere's a there's a pathological lens\nthat you can put on top of all that but\nonce you have one of these experiences\non psychedelics or on a drug like MDMA\nyou know that there's a there there you\nknow that unconditional love is is a\npossibility right you know that that\nfeeling truly one with nature right I\nmean just so one with nature that you're\nyou could spend 10 hours in front of a\ntree and find that to be the most\nrewarding experience of your of your\nlife right that's a possible State of\nConsciousness now it may not be the\nState of Consciousness you want all the\ntime you know you don't want to be the\ncrazy guy by the tree you know who can't\nhave a conversation about anything else\nbut\nuh once you have one of these\nexperiences you recognize okay there's\nthere's some reason why I'm not having\nthe beatific Vision right now and I\ncan't even figure out how to aim my\nattention so as to have anything like it\nand that's a problem right because it's\nit's available right and it's it's the\nbest you know it is\namong the best things that has ever\nhappened to me right and now I'm just\nonly dimly remember what that was like\num so how do I get back there on some\nlevel and that's so that invites again a\nlogic of changes a logic of seeking\nchanges in the contents of consciousness\nwhich set someone up for this this um\nprotracted or seemingly protracted and\nand you know fairly frustrating search\nto you know game their nervous system so\nas to have those kinds of experiences\nmore and more\num and again it's not that that's in\nprinciple fruitless\nbut it is from the point of view of the\nkind of the core Insight of you know the\ncore wisdom of you know what I would\ntake from a tradition like Buddhism\nwhich is not you know it's not the only\ntradition that has given voice to this\nbut it I would argue has given it you\nvoice to it the most in the most\narticulate way\num\nagain leaving aside any of the\nSuperstition and and other worldliness\nand miracles that you know we don't have\nto talk about at the moment and you\ncertainly don't need to endorse in order\nto be interested in this stuff\num\nand so that's the the bifurcation\nbetween\nthe all of the utility of psychedelics\nand what I'm talking about under the\nrubric of meditation is at this point of\nokay once you realize there's a there\nthere what do you do and what's the\nlogic by which you're led to do it and\nit's possible like if if your only\nframework is\nthe good experiences the good feels you\nhad on on whatever drug it was\nand\na a further discussion of of like what\nthat path of changes you know can look\nlike\nand that can become in a religious\ncontext it can come in just a purely\npsychedelic context or you know some\ncombination of the two\num\nI think you can be misled\nto a you can just be you can be misled\nto just seek lots of peak experiences\nyou're just trying to string together a\nlot of peak experiences hoping they're\ngoing to change you every one of which\nby by definition is going to be\nimpermanent right I mean it's it's first\nit wasn't there then it's there and then\nit's no longer there and then you've got\na memory of it right the ques what I\nthink it's what everyone really wants\nwhether they know it or not and their\nright to want is a type of Freedom that\nis compatible with even ordinary States\nOf Consciousness which which can ride\nalong with them into extraordinary\nStates Of Consciousness I mean so what I\nhadn't done psychedelics for\n25 years because I mean again they were\nsuper useful for me in the beginning\nthen I discovered meditation on the\nbasis of of those experiences got really\ninto meditation and realized okay this\nis a much more\nthis really is the you know conceptually\nthis makes much more sense to me this is\ndelivering the goods you know in terms\nof my experience\num there's no need to keep having these\nyou know seeking these Peak experiences\nwith with drugs\nbut it had been you know 25 years since\nI had done that and there was this\nResurgence in research on psychedelics\nand I was being asked about psychedelics\nand I was talking about their utility\nfor me but again these were Distant\nMemories and so I and there was also one\ntype of psychedelic experience\nI was I was aware that I had never had I\nhad never done a high dose of mushrooms\nuh blindfolded you know like every every\nmushroom trip I'd ever had I'd been out\nin nature and interacting with you know\nyou know it was just been a very\ntransformed sensory experience of the\nworld and of other people\nbut I had never done it alone\nblindfolded just purely you know\ninwardly directed and at a high dosage\nI'd done high doses of LSD but um but\nnot mushrooms\num\nso I did that you know and it was very\nuseful and I I spoke about it on my\npodcast there's actually there's I think\nif you search Sam Harris mushroom trip\non YouTube you get the the 19 minute\nversion of that of my describing that\ntrip\nit was incredibly useful and but it was\nwhat was doubly useful was\nmy mindfulness training in the context\nof that explosion of synesthesia I mean\nit was it was such an overwhelmingly\nstrong experience\num\nand there were so many moments where\nit could have gone one way or the other\nbased on my\nsense of just okay\nI'm going to try to resist this you know\nit was like it was it was it was in\ntruth irresistible because it was just\nso much but\num\nthere were moments where I was aware of\nokay this is like letting go of self you\nknow in this context\nis\nis the thing that is going to you know\nturn to make the difference between\nheaven and hell here you know and\nbecause there's there are experiences\nthat are so extreme\nthat you can't even tell if it's Agony\nor ecstasy it's just it's just this\neverything is turned up to 11 right and\nit and the difference between the two is\nlike you know the Tipping Point it's\njust it's not it really is kind of a\nhigh wire act in some sense you know you\ncould just fall to one side or the other\nand\num yeah so what I think people want\nis um\nthey certainly want to be able to\nextract from the Psychedelic experience\nwisdom that is applicable to ordinary\nStates Of Consciousness it's like what\nis the thing you can realize\nin a moment of having a conversation\nwith your child\nthat isn't distracting you from that\nrelationship it's not a memory of when\nthe world dissolved or you know when you\nwere indistinguishable from the sky but\nit's just a way of a way of be having\nfree attention\nand unconditional love\nin this you know totally ordinary and\npotentially\nchaotic Human Experience you know which\ncan be psychologically fraught and you\ncan meet you know iterations of yourself\nthat you don't like that are that are\nnot equipping you to be the best\npossible person in that relationship and\nwhat we want to do is cut through all of\nthat and actually you know be in love\nwith our lives and with the people in\nour lives more and more of the time yeah\nand\num that's probably there's I'm not\nsaying that the psych you know that\nrepeated psychedelic Journeys aren't\ncan't be integral to that project\nbut but you know that it can't the\nproject can't be being high all the time\nright so whatever is extractable from\nthat the the the occasional you know\npsychedelic trip has got to be mappable\ninto ordinary awakened Consciousness and\nthe point of con the real point of\ncontact does kind of run through this\nyou know what I've been calling the\nillusion of the self and again it is\nthat part is discoverable without any\nchanges in Contents right so you don't\nhave to suddenly feel the energy of your\nbody be rush out and be continuous with\nthe you know the ocean of energy that is\nnot your body right like that's an\nexperience that's there to be had right\nthere's no doubt but\nthis the truth is I mean just looking at\nthis cup\nis just as formless and as mysterious as\nthat right when it's seen in the right\nway and that's and that's that's what\nyou know meditation encourages to you\nknow one to recognize\n[Music]"
