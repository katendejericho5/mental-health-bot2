    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: When people\ndrink, no matter who you are,\ninitially there's that shutting down\nof those prefrontal cortical circuits.\nThere's a gradual shutting down\nof the circuits that control memory,\nbut then people divide\ninto these two bins.\nAnd these two bins are the people who,\nafter more than a couple of drinks\nstart to feel sedated\nand the people who, after\nmore than a few drinks\ndo not start to feel sedated.\nNow, of course, there's\ngoing to be differences\ncreated by how quickly\npeople are drinking,\nwhether or not they're\ncombining different types\nof alcohol, the types\nof alcohol, et cetera.\nBut in general, that can\npredict whether or not\nyou're somebody who has a\npredisposition for alcoholism\nor not.\nOne also very interesting finding\nis that alcohol changes the relationship\nbetween what's called the hypothalamus\nand the pituitary gland and the adrenals.\nNow, the hypothalamus\nis a small collection\nof neurons about the\nsize of a large gumball.\nIt sits above the roof of your mouth\nand it houses neurons that are responsible\nfor some incredible\naspects of our behavior\nand our mindset.\nThings like rage, things like sex drive,\nthings like temperature regulation,\nvery primitive functions,\nincluding appetite,\nthirst, et cetera.\nAlcohol, because it can\ngo anywhere in the brain,\nremember, it's water and fat soluble,\nhas a effects on the hypothalamus.\nThe hypothalamus normally\nprovides very specific signals\nto what's called the pituitary gland.\nThis is a little gland\nthat actually sticks\nout of the brain, but\nit receives instructions\nfrom the hypothalamus.\nAnd then, the pituitary releases hormones\ninto the blood stream that go and talk\nto your adrenals.\nAnd your adrenal glands sit\nright above your kidneys\nin your lower back.\nAnd the adrenals release, as\nthe name suggests, adrenaline,\nalso called epinephrine,\nand also a molecule called cortisol,\nwhich is involved in the kind\nof longer term stress response\nand some healthy effects,\ntoo, on the immune system.\nOkay, so the hypothalamic\npituitary adrenal access,\n[LAUGHS] I know that's a mouthful,\nyou don't need to remember the names,\nbut the hypothalamic\npituitary adrenal access\nmaintains your physiological balance\nof what you perceive as stressful\nand what you don't perceive as stressful.\nPeople who drink regularly,\nso this, again, could be just\none or two drinks per night\nor it could be somebody\nthat drinks just on Fridays\nor just on Saturdays, or\nmaybe just on the weekend,\ntwo to four drinks, well,\nthose people experience changes\nin their hypothalamic\npituitary adrenal access\nthat result in more cortisol,\nmore of the so-called stress hormone\nbeing released at baseline,\nwhen they are not drinking.\nThis is really important.\nPeople who drink a bit,\nand when I say a bit, I\ndon't mean one or two sips\nor even a glass of wine\nevery once in a while.\nI mean, again, people that are maybe\nhaving one drink a night with dinner\nand maybe on the weekend, a few more.\nAgain, I offer a bunch\nof different patterns\nto explain how it could\nalso be two or three drinks\non Friday or six drinks only on Saturday.\nWell, all of those groups\nexperience increases\nin cortisol release from\ntheir adrenal glands\nwhen they are not drinking.\nAnd as a consequence,\nthey feel more stressed\nand more anxiety when\nthey aren't drinking.\nThis is a seldom talked\nabout effect of alcohol\nbecause so often, we hear\nabout the immediate effects\nof alcohol, all right?\nAnd we've been talking\nabout some of those effects,\neffects like reducing\nthe amount of stress.\nI mean, how many times\nhave we heard somebody say,\n\"Oh, I need a drink.\"\nAnd then, they have a drink\nand then they calm down.\nNow they can shake off the thoughts\nabout the day's work,\nthey can start to think about things\nin a maybe more grounded or rational way,\nor at least they believe that\nor they can somehow just relax themselves.\nWell, while that very well may be true,\nthat it can relax them,\nwhen they are not drinking,\nthat level of cortisol\nthat's released at baseline\nhas increased substantially.\nAgain, this relates to\na defined neural circuit\nbetween brain and body\nand it has to do with\nthe ratio of cortisol\nto some of the other hormones involved\nin the stress response.\nWe'll provide a reference to the study\nthat describes how all of this works\nfor those of you who really\nwant to delve into it,\nbut let's go back to this issue\nof those who are prone to alcoholism\nversus those who are not.\nRemember, there are people\nwho have genetic variants\nthat, meaning genes,\nthat they inherited from their parents,\nthat make it more likely that\nthey will become alcoholics,\nbut there are also people who drink often,\nwho start to experience\nthis increase in alertness\nthe longer they drink across the night.\nPart of that effect, we think,\nis because of changes\nin this hypothalamic\npituitary adrenal access.\nSo, alcohol is kind of a\ndouble hit in this sense.\nIt's causing changes\nin our brain circuitry\nand neurochemistry that,\nat the time in which we're\ninebriated, are detrimental.\nAnd it's causing changes\nin neural circuitry\nthat persist long past the time\nin which we're experience\nthe feeling of being tipsy\nor drunk.\nNow, again, I don't want\nto demonize alcohol.\nI'm not saying, oh, you know,\nif you have a glass of wine now and again\nor you drink a beer now and again\nor even have, you know, a\nmixed drink now and again\nor a shot that that's\nnecessarily terrible for you.\nI certainly do not want\nthat to be the message.\nWhat I'm saying is that if\npeople are ingesting alcohol\nchronically, even if it's not every night,\nthere are well-recognized changes\nin neural circuits.\nThere are well-recognized changes\nin neurochemistry within the brain,\nand there are well-recognized changes\nin the brain to body stress system\nthat generally point in three directions:\nIncreased stress when\npeople are not drinking,\ndiminished mood and feelings of wellbeing\nwhen people are not drinking,\nand, as you'll soon learn,\nchanges in the neural circuitry\nthat cause people to\nwant to drink even more\nin order to get just back to baseline,\nor the place that they were,\nin terms of their stress modulation\nand in terms of their feelings of mood\nbefore they ever started\ndrinking in the first place.\nSo again, I don't want\nto demonize alcohol,\nbut I do want to emphasize\nthat there are long-term plastic changes,\nmeaning changes in neural circuitry\nand hormone circuitry\nthat, across a period of several months\nand certainly across a period of years\nof the sorts of drinking\npatterns I described,\nwhich I think for most people\nare going to sound like\npretty typical, right?\nI mean, nothing that I described so far\nwas about drinking a case a night\nor about binging on alcohol\nin the way that we often\nhear about it in the news.\nThese are pretty common patterns\nof alcohol consumption.\nI mean, all you have to do is\nboard a transatlantic flight\nor actually go to an airport\non a Sunday afternoon\nin a sunny area of the US,\nand you know, people are having three,\nfour, five, six beers, et cetera.\nAgain, personal choice is personal choice.\nI'm not telling you what to do,\nbut it's very clear that those\nsorts of drinking patterns\nare changing neural circuitry\nand they're changing hormone circuitry,\nand I'd love to be able to tell you\nthat they're changing them for the better,\nbut they simply are not.\nThey're actually changing\nthem for the worse,\nand worse is defined as\nmaking people less resilient\nto stress, higher levels\nof baseline stress,\nand lower mood overall.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
