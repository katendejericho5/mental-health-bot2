    "transcript": "JOCKO WILLINK: Being able\nto take a step back, detach,\nand see the bigger picture to me\nis the true superpower of life.\nAnd it's a lot harder\nthan it sounds.\nAnd this goes back\nto when you start\ntalking about people that\nare going through struggles\nin life.\nAnd I've described this before\nas if I'm looking at you,\nand you're in a bad state.\nYou're depressed.\nYou're sad.\nYou're moping around.\nYou're not getting\nanything done.\nAnd I'm looking at\nyou from the outside,\nand I'm thinking for me,\nI see this storm cloud\naround your head.\nI see the storm cloud\naround your head.\nAnd you're in there, and\nall you see no matter what\ndirection you look is storm.\nAll you see is darkness.\nI'm outside and I'm looking,\noh, hey, man, this guy's\ngot a great education.\nHe's healthy.\nHe's got a good team around him.\nHe's got all these\nthings going for him.\nBut you in that state, you\nliterally cannot see anything\nbut the darkness of the storm.\nAnd that's what's so scary\nabout when people enter\nthat mode is you can look--\nI can look at it from\nthe outside and be like,\nAndrew, you've just got to\nmove like four feet forward,\nand you're going to\nbe through this thing.\nAnd yet you might hear me say\nthat, and you go, no, Jock.\nI'm looking ahead, there's\nnothing but darkness.\nSo helping people move\nforward, take action, and be\nable to get that\nperspective, detach,\nand get outside themselves,\nget outside their own heads.\nTim Ferriss said get\nout of your head.\nGet into your body.\nThat's one way to do it.\nTake action.\nGo do things.\nBut it's very scary.\nAnd I'm sure you've had\nthis experience where you're\ntalking to someone that\nyou know, and they're\nbogged down in\nwhatever problem it is,\nwhatever stress they're under.\nAnd you're looking\nat them going, hey,\nman, it's going to be OK.\nYou can clearly\nsee that whatever\nis bothering them and dragging\nthem, now, you can clearly see.\nA lot of times it's\na relationship.\nThe girl or the guy\nthey got dumped,\nand you go, hey, man, that\nperson was a disaster anyways.\nYou're better off without them.\nAnd they cannot compute that.\nThey are stuck there.\nOr maybe it's the school\nthat they didn't get into,\nor the job that they didn't get.\nAnd they get so\nwrapped up in that.\nThey can't get\nout of that storm.\nAnd it's such a helpless feeling\nto sit there and tell someone,\nhey you just move a\nlittle bit towards me,\nand you're going to\nget out of this storm.\nAnd it's so much\neasier said than done.\nAnd that's why trying\nto engage with people\nand trying to give people that\nsuper power of detachment where\nthey can take a\nstep back and say,\nyou know what,\nyou're right, man.\nThat girl she wasn't who\nI really thought she was.\nI should move on.\nYes.\nBut easier said than done.\nAnd that's one of the\nbiggest challenges\nI think that we have\nas friends and parents\nand teammates is helping\npeople learn to detach,\nlearn to see the bigger picture,\nlearn to see that the problem\nthat you have that your\nwhole world is actually\nnot that big of a deal.\nI've written a bunch\nof kids' books.\nAnd one of the\nthings that triggered\nme to write kids\nbooks is realizing\nthat-- one day my daughter\ncame home-- it's my oldest\ndaughter-- and she came home\nfrom school, and she says,\nI'm stupid.\nWhat do you mean you're stupid?\nI'm stupid.\nI'm dumb.\nWhy do you think that?\nYou know whatever grade\nit is when you're supposed\nto know your timetables?\nI don't know my timetables.\nI said, oh, well, how\nmuch have you studied?\nShe gave me the confused look.\nWhat do you mean studied?\nI said, have you studied\nyet have you made flashcards\nto learn them?\nAnd she didn't.\nShe hadn't.\nShe thought she\nshould just know them.\nFrom the teacher went\nover what they are,\nnow she should know them like\nsome other kids in the class\ndid.\nAnd so I'm sitting there\ngoing, oh, yeah, cool.\nWe'll make some flashcards.\nAnd she made flashcards.\nShe learned her timetables in\n45 minutes, and we were good.\nBut what struck me was to me,\nI was like, oh, no big deal.\nTo her, it was her whole life.\nAnd then I got to see\nthat with my other kids.\nSomebody said something to\nthem in the recess yard.\nAnd I'm like, oh,\nscrew that kid.\nThey don't know what--\ndon't worry about them.\nBut when you're-- that's\ntheir whole world and that\nunfortunately doesn't\nonly apply to kids.\nIt applies to adults as well.\nAnd they get this\nproblem in their world\nthat seems so insurmountable\nand so massive\nbecause that little ecosystem\nthat they're stuck in\nis their world.\nAnd they run into\nthis problem, and it's\ndisruptive in that\nworld, and they don't\nknow how to get out of it.\nI did a podcast talking\nabout these ecosystems\nthat people get into.\nAnd there's all\nthese ecosystems.\nYou're in an ecosystem.\nWe're both in a shared\necosystem of podcasting\nand we could be\nlike, oh, my gosh,\nLex just came out\nwith a new podcast,\nand it's been the\nbiggest success.\nAnd what can I do to\ncatch up with Lex?\nAnd all of a sudden, I\ncould get really bothered,\nyou could get really bothered,\nwe could be bothered by that.\nAnd think, man, I'm a failure.\nMeanwhile, there's people\nthat don't listen to podcasts.\nThere's people that don't\neven know what a podcast is.\nAnd yet it's our whole\nworld if we let it be.\nYou're in the academic world.\nHey, you go-- you're a\nprofessor at Stanford, which\nis a big deal in that world.\nI know people that\ndon't give a rat's ass.\nThey don't know\nwhere Stanford is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nget that all the time.\nJOCKO WILLINK: They don't\nknow where Stanford is.\nIt's no big deal.\nIn the SEAL Teams, same thing.\nSomebody has a problem\nin the SEAL Teams,\nand they think this is the\nwhole world, and I blew it.\nAnd now what are\nthey going to do?\nWhen you're facing a\nsignificant problem\nin life, a relationship,\na problem with a job,\nyou got to remember that\nyou're in one ecosystem,\nand if you step outside of that\necosystem, no one really cares.\nAnd you could go move into\na whole totally different\necosystem and find\nhappiness there.\nBut at least utilize that\nto get out of that storm\ncloud that you're\nin, and you're going\nto find that there's plenty of\nlight out there in the world.\nMove towards that and it's going\nto be a much better situation.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
