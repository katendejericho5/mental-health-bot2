    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: What are\nyour sources of motivation?\nAnd I'm going to guess that\nsome of them are internal.\nWe could point ahead or\nwe could point to heart.\nDoesn't really\nmatter, but like when\nyou think of sources\nof motivation,\ndo you have a palette of\nthem that you can dip into?\nDo you even feel the\nneed to dip into them,\nor is it really just\nall about action steps\nthroughout your day?\nOr if I can even venture\ninto somewhat harder stories\nthat I've heard\nyou talk about, do\nyou sometimes\nthink back, listen,\nI'm going to do this because\nthere are a bunch of guys that\nare dead now that\ncan't, and so I'm\ngoing to do it because I can.\nWhat are the paints on your\nmotivation pallet, if you will?\nJOCKO WILLINK:\nWell, you probably\nheard me say that\nmotivation isn't something\nthat I am going to count\non because it's just\nan emotion that's\ngoing to come and go,\nand it's just like\nfeeling happy.\nYou feel happy\nright now, maybe you\nwon't feel happy in 15 minutes.\nYou feel sad now, maybe you\nwon't feel sad in 15 minutes.\nYou feel motivated\nright now, you might not\nfeel motivated in 15 minutes.\nTherefore I can't rely on it.\nSo I'm not going to put any--\nI'm not going to put\nany money on just\nbeing motivated because it\ndoesn't really matter to me.\nSo the daily actions that I\ntake aren't from motivation,\nthey're just from discipline.\nLike I said earlier,\nI'm not going\nto get up and go through\nsome big debate about,\nwell, do I really\nfeel like doing this?\nNo, I don't feel like doing\nit, but doesn't matter,\nso I'm just going to go do it.\nNow if we start to look at a\nbroader movement through life\nand continuing to try and\nmove forward and move on,\nmy buddy Seth died, and he was\nthe Delta Platoon commander\nin Task Unit Bruiser.\nAnd he died in 2017, and it\nwas in a parachute accident.\nI mean, it's\ndefinitely unexpected,\nand also he'd already been\nthrough multiple deployments,\nwas with me in the\nBattle of Ramadi,\nhe then went back into\nSadr City and led a ton\nof very dangerous operations.\nAnd then he did\nother deployments,\nand was kind of done with his\ndeployments, kind of done.\nAnd now he's just talking about\nwhen he's going to retire,\nand he's a couple of years\naway from retirement,\nand I'm talking\nabout, hey, we're\ngoing to work together again.\nAnd it all seems like\nwe're on a pretty good path\nto just move forward.\nAnd then he ends up dying\nin a parachute accident.\nAnd he's a guy that was\nreally just kind of you're\nnot going to be able to replace.\nThere's a uniqueness to him that\nis you're not going to find,\nand I've got some\nstuff that he wrote.\nHe was an incredible writer,\nand I try and write something\nlike him, and we\ncan't do it because he\nhad a bigger vocabulary and a\nmore articulate way of writing.\nAnd so I can't write anything\nas well as he wrote it.\nHe was incredible at guitar, he\nplayed guitar, played ukulele\nlike sick, like an\nincredible at playing guitar,\nand he's a total\nknuckle dragger.\nLike a total meat\nhead knuckle dragger.\nHis nickname was\nUnfrozen Caveman\nbecause he just look\nlike a big caveman\nand yet he spoke French, and\ncould recite French poetry.\nAnd was really good\nat learning languages,\nand he was an artist,\nand he had-- do\nyou know what synesthesia is?\nDo you know that is?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: A\nmerging of the senses\nso people that can\nsee colors and--\nJOCKO WILLINK: So he\ndidn't know what it was--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nsorry, see colors.\nI hope most people can\nsee colors-- sorry,\nthat can hear colors and can\nassociate particular colors\nwith sound like particular\nkeys on the piano.\nIt's pretty rare.\nSome people think they have\nit, but true synesthesia\nare pretty rare, but they don't\nhave to fight for this trait.\nIt just kind of\nemerges for them.\nJOCKO WILLINK: He\ndidn't know it.\nBut one day he\nwas talking to me,\nand he was embarrassed\nto tell me.\nHe's like, what's weird is\nwhen I think of numbers,\nI have colors in my head.\nAnd I go, what do you mean?\nAnd he says, hollow was zero,\nand I remember seven is yellow.\nI don't remember any\nof them, but he just\nrattled off like 123456789.\nHe says, hollow, white, clear,\njust rattled off these colors.\nHe had that synesthesia,\nand it gave him\nsome kind of weird ability\nto memorize numbers.\nSo he'd be in a bar and talk\nto some girl and he'd say,\nwhat's your number?\nAnd he would just-- he\nwould know it for two years.\nHe would just know it.\nAnd that also made\nhim incredibly\ngood at playing guitar\nbecause now like the scale\nand the fretboard of a guitar,\nit's a mathematical thing\nthat he has all in this weird\ncoloration scenario going on.\nSo he's this guy and\na very emotional guy.\nA very emotional guy who would--\nI was talking earlier about\nbeing a balance for someone.\nI had to balance this dude out\non a daily basis sometimes.\nHe'd be so mad about something.\nOne day he'd be,\nI hate the Teams.\nI hate all these guys.\nAnd I'd say, yeah,\nI get it, man.\nAnd the next day, I'm never\ngetting out of the Teams.\nHe would oscillate that\nbad, and I would tell him,\nhey, bro, you're\noscillating again,\nand just would do anything.\nAnd he loved these guys and\nwould do anything for his guys.\nAnd so when he died, we're at\nhis-- it's not his funeral,\nit's before the funeral.\nIt's like the open casket\nthing, the wake thing,\nand myself, his brother,\nAlex, Leif Babin who\nI wrote Extreme Ownership\nwith and JP O'Donnell, who's\none of my brothers who works\nwith us at Arsenal on Front\nnow is with us in Ramadi\nand was very close to Seth,\nand everyone kind of\ncleared out for us.\nAnd we go in there, and\nI think JP gave him--\nJP had one of those Memorial\nbracelets with guys' names\non it that had died and\nJP gave that to him.\nAnd I think Leif gave him some\nsurf wax because also Seth\nwas a surfer, and I gave Seth\nhis black belt because he\nstarted training jiu-jitsu with\nme and he had his purple belt.\nHe had gotten his purple belt,\nI gave him his black belt\nand everyone was just quiet.\nAnd JP was telling the\nstory the other day\nand I just said, we\nwill not fail him,\nmeaning that him Mark,\nMikey, Chris, Seth,\nand countless other\nguys they're not here.\nThey don't have the opportunity\nto do the things we do.\nThey don't have the opportunity\nto get up in the morning.\nSo that's what it is man.  \nI won't fail those guys.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
