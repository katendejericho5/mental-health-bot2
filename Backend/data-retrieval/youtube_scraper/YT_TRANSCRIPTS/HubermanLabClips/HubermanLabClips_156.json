    "transcript": "and in terms of learning multiple\nlanguages during development my\nunderstanding is that if one wants to\nbecome bilingual or trilingual best to\nlearn those languages simultaneously\nduring development ideally before age 12\nif one hopes to not have an accent in\nspeaking them later is that correct\nearlier is better the more intense it is\nand the more immersive it is the longer\nyou know that you can be exposed to that\nis really important a lot of people can\nget exposed to early and basically lose\nit even though it's quote-unquote during\nthat sensitive period unless it's\nmaintained it can be very easily lost\nthen I think another aspect of it that's\nvery interesting is some of the social\nrequirements for it too it's pretty\nclear that you can only go so far\njust listening to these sounds from a\ntape recording or something like that\nthere's something extra about real human\ninteractions that activates the brain's\nsensitivity to different speech bounds\nallows us to become specialized for them\nfor a given language"
