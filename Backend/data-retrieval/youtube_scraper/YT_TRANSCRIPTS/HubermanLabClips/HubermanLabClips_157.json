    "transcript": "- For those of you that\nenjoy alcohol, I, again,\nI really, I like to say I feel\nguilty about telling you this\nbecause I know how much\nsome people enjoy a good\ndrink every once in a while,\nand I say a good drink,\nbecause some people do\nlike the taste of alcohol.\nI suppose I lucked out\nand that I don't really\nlike the taste of alcohol and\nthat just puts me to sleep.\nBut I know that people do enjoy it.\nAnd I do want to point out\nthat there is zero evidence\nthat provided somebody is of drinking age,\ncertainly not in the stage\nof brain development,\nthat having one drink or two\ndrinks every now and again,\nmeaning every three or\nfour weeks or once a month\nthat is not going to cause\nmajor health concerns\nor major health issues for most people.\nI suppose if you have zero\nor very little alcohol dehydrogenates\nit might make you feel sick,\nbut you're probably not the kind\nof person that's going\nto be drinking at all.\nSo again, if you enjoy alcoholic drinks,\nI'm not trying to take them\naway from you by any means,\nbut you should know what drinking does,\nif you're consuming it in this kind\nof typical chronic pattern\nas we can now refer to it,\nwhich is that one or two\na night or a few stacked\nup on Friday and maybe\nthree or four on Saturday.\nThis kind of pattern of\ndrinking, which is quite common,\nand one of the more serious\neffects that we should think\nabout is the impact on the\nso-called gut brain access\nor for sake of today's discussion,\nthe gut liver brain access.\nI don't think the gut\nliver brain access has ever\nbeen discussed on this\npodcast, maybe any podcast,\nalthough at the moment\nI say that I'm going to,\nthe gut liver brain access\npeople are going to come\nafter me with, I suppose,\ngut, liver and brains.\nIn any event, you have\na brain, you have a gut,\nthat gut runs from your throat\ndown to the end of your intestine.\nYour gut and your brain communicate\nby way of nerve cells, neurons,\nand nerve connections, the\nvagus nerve in particular.\nAnd by way of chemical signaling.\nYour gut also communicates\nby way of chemical signaling.\nAnd believe it or not, by\nway of neural signaling too,\nto your liver.\nAnd as we talked about earlier,\nthe liver is the first site\nin which alcohol is\nbroken down or metabolized\ninto its component parts.\nThe liver is also\ncommunicating with the brain,\nthrough chemical signaling\nand neural signaling.\nSo we have the gut liver brain access,\nand what you find is that people\nwho ingest alcohol at any amount\nare inducing a disruption in\nthe so-called gut microbiome,\nthe trillions of little\nmicrobacteria that take resident\nin your gut and that live\ninside you all the time\nand that help support your immune system\nand that literally signal\nby way of electrical signals\nand chemical signals to your\nbrain to increase the release\nof things like serotonin and dopamine\nand regulate your mood\ngenerally in positive ways.\nWell, alcohol really\ndisrupts those bacteria\nand this should come as no surprise.\nEarlier we talked about\nthis and it's well known,\nif you want to sterilize something,\nyou want to kill the bacteria,\nyou pour alcohol on it\nand I can remember scraping\nmy myself or cutting myself\nor I was always injuring\nmyself when I was a kid.\nAnd you know, the moment they take\nout the peroxide, you're\nlike, oh boy, here it comes.\nBut if there's no peroxide around\nand you've got a wound there\nand you need to clean it out, yeah,\nthey'll use alcohol, which I\ndo not recommend by the way\nand that's one of the harshest\nways to clean a wound.\nBut for centuries,\nthousands of years, really,\nalcohol has been used in order\nto clean things and kill bacteria.\nSo alcohol kills bacteria\nand it is indiscriminate\nwith respect to which bacteria it kills.\nSo when we ingest alcohol\nand it goes into our gut,\nit kills a lot of the\nhealthy gut microbiota.\nAt the same time, the metabolism\nof alcohol in the liver,\nwhich you now understand,\nthat pathway involving NAD\nacetaldehyde and acetate,\nthat pathway is pro-inflammatory.\nSo it's increasing the release\nof inflammatory cytokines\nthings like IL6, etcetera,\ntumor necrosis factor alpha.\nIf you'd like to learn more\nabout the immune system,\nwe did an episode all\nabout the immune system.\nYou can find it at hubermanlab.com.\nIt'll teach you all the\nbasics of what are cytokines\nwhat are mast cells, etcetera.\nIn any event, all these\nproinflammatory molecules,\nthose are being released.\nYou've now got disruption\nof the gut microbiota.\nAs a consequence, the lining\nof the gut is disrupted\nand you develop at least\ntransiently, leaky gut.\nThat is bacteria that exists in the gut,\nwhich are bad bacteria,\ncan now pass out of the\ngut into the bloodstream.\nSo you've got a two\nhit kind of model here.\nIn biology, we talk about two hit models\nthat is kind of a one\nplus one equals four.\nAnd it's generally when you hear two hit,\nit's not a good thing.\nSo you've got bad bacteria\nfrom partially broken down\nfood moving out of the gut,\nthe good bacteria in the\ngut have been killed.\nYou might say, why\ndoesn't the alcohol kill\nthe bad bacteria in the gut?\nWell, the bad bacteria that are\nfrom partially digested food\noftentimes escape the gut,\nbefore the alcohol can disrupt them.\nAnd so now you've got\nleaks in the gut wall.\nYou've got the release\nof this bad bacteria,\nyou've got inflammatory cytokines\nand other things being\nreleased from the liver\nand they are able to get into the brain\nthrough what's called a\nneuro immune signaling.\nAnd what's really bizarre in terms\nof the way that this\nmanifests in the brain,\nI mean it's not the\nway I would've done it,\nbut then again as I always say,\nI wasn't consulted at the design phase.\nAnd anyone who says they did,\nyou should be very skeptical of them.\nThe net effect of this\nis actually to disrupt\nthe neural circuits\nthat control regulation\nof alcohol intake.\nAnd the net effect of that is\nincreased alcohol consumption.\nSo this is just terrible, right?\nI mean, you take in something\nthat disrupts two systems\nthe gut microbiota, and it\ndisrupts it in two ways.\nIt's killing the good gut microbiota\nand it's allowing the bad bacteria to move\nfrom the gut into the bloodstream.\nYou've also got pro-inflammatory\ncytokines coming\nfrom the liver and\nthose converge or arrive\nin the brain and create a system\nin which the neural circuits\ncause more drinking.\nThat's a bad situation.\nAnd this is why people\nwho drink regularly,\neven if it's not a ton of alcohol, again,\nof the sorts of patterns of drinking\nI talked about before, and certainly,\nfor those that are chronic heavy drinkers,\nwhat you end up with is a situation\nin which you have inflammation\nin multiple places in the brain and body\nand the desire to drink\neven more and to further\nexacerbate that inflammation\nand the gut leakiness.\nSo this is basically a terrible scenario\nfor the gut liver brain access\nand it's especially prevalent\nin so-called alcohol use disorder.\nAgain, people that are ingesting somewhere\nbetween 12 and 24 drinks per week.\nFor those of you that are interested\nin learning more about\nthe gut liver brain access\nand in particular alcohol use disorder,\nI'll provide a link in\nthe show note captions.\nNow, there's a wonderful review\non this that details that,\nbut on the positive side,\nit points to the possibility\nthat at least some, again, at least some\nof the negative effects\nof alcohol consumption,\nwhether or not you're somebody\nwho's currently ingesting alcohol\nor who used to ingest alcohol\nand is trying to so-called\nrepair these systems\nof the brain and body,\nwhether or not replenishing\nthe gut microbiota\nis going to be beneficial.\nAnd we know that there are ways to do that\nand we know that there's\nat least some promise\nfor the ability for this\nsystem to repair itself.\nHow does one do that?\nWell, I've talked before\nabout this on the podcast,\nbut studies done by\ncolleagues of mine at Stanford\nJustin Sonnenburg, who's been\non this podcast as a guest,\nan amazing episode, all\nabout the gut microbiome\nand his collaborator, Chris\nGardner, also at Stanford School\nof Medicine have explored, not alcoholism,\nbut what are ways to\nimprove the gut microbiota,\nin particular, to reduce the production\nof inflammatory cytokines and to adjust\nwhat's called the inflammatone.\nYou've heard of the genome\nand the proteome, etcetera.\nWell, the inflammatone is the total array\nor at least the near total\narray of genes and proteins\nthat control inflammation.\nHow can you reduce inflammation\nand make that inflammatone healthier?\nWell, they've shown that\ntwo to four servings\nof fermented foods per day,\nand here I'm not referring\nto fermented alcohol,\nI'm talking about low\nsugar fermented food.\nSo things like kimchi, sauerkraut, natto,\nfor those of you that like Japanese food.\nThere are others,\nI know things like keifer,\nthings like yogurts,\nthat have a lot of active bacteria.\nAgain, low sugar varieties\nof all these things,\nthose are terrific at\nreducing inflammatory markers\nand at improving the gut microbiome.\nOne could imagine that\neither inoculating one's self\nfrom some of the effects of alcohol,\nalthough I'd prefer that\npeople just not drink\nalcohol chronically, frankly.\nOr if somebody's trying\nto repair their gut\nmicrobiome because they ingested\na lot of alcohol or because they had a lot\nof these inflammatory\ncytokines for many years\nor even a short period of time,\nregular ingestion of two to four servings\nof these fermented foods\ncan be quite beneficial.\nI want to make it clear\nthat has not been examined\nspecifically in the context\nof alcohol use disorder,\nbut because a huge component\nof the negative effects\nof alcohol use disorder are based\nin this gut liver brain access\nand disruption of the gut microbiome\nand the inflammatory cytokines,\nit stands to reason that\nthings that are well\nestablished to improve\ninflammation status,\nin other words,\nreduce inflammation such as\ningesting two to four servings\nof low sugar fermented foods per day,\nmakes sense in terms of trying to repair\nor replenish the system.\nOne could also imagine taking\nprobiotics or prebiotics.\nCertainly that would work as well,\nalthough I've sort of\nfavored the discussion\naround fermented foods\nand replenishment of the gut microbiome,\nmostly because there are more\nstudies that have examined\nthat in humans and because\nof the direct relationship\nthat's been established\nbetween doing that,\nand reducing negative markers\nwithin the inflammatone.\n[upbeat music]"
