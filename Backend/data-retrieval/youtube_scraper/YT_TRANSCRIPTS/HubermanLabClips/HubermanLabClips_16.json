    "transcript": "First of all, with your workload,\nsimulate something like a poll system,\ninstead of a push system.\nAnd what I mean by that is\nwhen you keep track of\nwhat you're working on,\nhave the top part of that list,\nwhich is I'm actively\nworking on these things,\nand keep that top part of your list\nto like two or three things.\nEverything else is in the\nbottom part of the list,\nit's to work on next, and\nit's in an ordered queue.\nAnd so when you finish something\nthat you're working on,\nyou pull something new to take its slot\nfrom the list below, right?\nSo, what I'm trying to do with that advice\nis reduce all this\nadministrative overhead.\nBecause now, even if\nlike you can't get away,\nyou have to say yes to these things\nbecause it's the way like\nyour organization works.\nThe stuff that's in the waiting\nto work on queue, you say,\n\"I don't have meetings about that,\nI don't do emails about that.\nI wait till I'm actively working on it,\nand I only actively work\non three things at a time!\"\nNow, I'm going to finish\nthose things really quickly\nbecause I don't have 15\nitems worth of meetings\nI'm going to every day.\nSo, things are going to pull\nup there pretty quickly.\nAnd so, the rate at which\nI'm accomplishing things will\nprobably be higher than it was before.\nBut I only work on three things actively.\nYou could even make this visible.\nIt's in a shared document if you want to,\nwhen someone asks you to do something new,\ntell them to put it on\nthe end of your queue.\nYou're like, \"Oh, okay.\"\nSo like, Andrew is not\nworking on this right now,\nhe's working on these three things.\nAnd there's seven things here,\nand I'm adding something number eight.\nSo, I know not to expect\nsomething for a while.\nIn fact, I can keep checking this list\nuntil I see Andrew's workin' on it,\nso I can see it's making progress.\nAnd then once I know he is workin' on it,\nI can start emailing him about it,\nand we can do just a normal\ntype of overhead you would have\nwith projects right?\nThat alone is going to\nhave a huge difference.\nLike now, the amount\nof distraction your day\nis going to plummet.\nBecause that's generated\nfrom overhead of things\nyou've agreed to do,\nand that's going to plummet that down.\nAll right, so that'd be number one.\nCould I just?\nThank you, could I just\nask a few questions\nabout that just to?\nYeah!\nClarify, so for,\nI'll use myself as an example selfishly,\nbut then of course, I don't know\nwhat everyone else out there is pursuing,\nbut so substitute the specifics\nI'm about to insert here\nfor whatever it is that you\ncare about in your life.\nSo, researching podcasts.\nSolo podcasts in particular for me\nis my major task in life these days.\nWith respect to work.\nSo, that would be top of the list.\nAnd then, there could be\ntwo other items on this\ntop of queue, would daily\nactivities like exercise,\nsocial time with loved ones, et cetera,\nwould that be included there?\nOr, we're talking specifically about work?\nYeah, let's just keep, just work.\nOkay, so it would be, podcast prep.\nCAL: So, you might have-\nPodcast prep. [laughing]\nYou might have the\nparticular topic, though?\nRight, right, okay, so pod, right,\nI'm working on an episode right now\nabout skin health.\nYou could\n[Andrew's voice drowns]\nhave two different episode\ntopics you're prepping-\nANDREW: Got it, yeah.\nThose could both be up there.\nYep, so it was skin\nhealth, allergies, episode,\nthese are two that I'm\nspending a lot of time on.\nMonths, in fact, yeah, okay.\nAnd then, your third might be something\nthat involves the media company,\nsomething around the business side of it.\nLike, okay, we're trying to\nfigure out a plan for whatever.\nRight, content for\na brand association-\nYou can do content strategy\nor something-\nOkay, got it.\nGreat!\nSo, those three would be top of the list,\nand every day until those\nare done, they could sit\ntop of the list.\nAnd then there are a number of items\nunderneath those that fall under whatever.\nYeah, and critically,\nwhen these other items come up, right?\nLike, oh, this is like\na topic, for example,\nI want to do a show on,\nyou have a place to put it!\nWhere it's not being forgotten!\nOr, here's a business idea.\nLike, we need to figure out,\nlike whatever, we want to add,\ndo something with our camera, configure.\nOkay, put it on the list,\nso it's not being forgotten.\nLike, it's on there, and\nyou can see where it is.\nNot only is it on there,\nbut like this could be\nshared among your team.\nSo, as people had extra information\nor things to add to one of these projects,\nthey can add it to it on the list!\nRight, so the information is aggregating.\nSo if you use a tool like Trello for this.\nTrello? Spelled?\nT-R-E-L-L-O.\nOkay, is it an app?\nIt's a web-based service,\nthe metaphor is just index cards in piles.\nGot it-\nRight?\nBut they're virtual.\nBut you can flip over\nthe index card digitally,\nattach files, write notes,\nand so I use Trello for\nmy own organization,\nwhat I'm workin' on.\nSo now, you have a place\nwhere you can gather like, oh,\nI just heard about something\nthat's relevant to this\nthing I need to work on.\nYou have a place to put it!\nLike, it goes onto the Trello card.\nOr, you could do this\nwith shared documents,\nit doesn't matter.\nYou're just like literally typing things\ninto a Google Doc,\nyou know-\nOr a whiteboard.\nOr a whiteboard, yeah.\nYeah, you could be,\nwe're keeping track of\nthese things, right?\nI'm going to do this, by the way.\nYeah, well, I mean I'm\na big believer in this,\nand then everyone can see\nwhat you're working on.\nAnd then, but the key thing is if it's not\nin your active list, you\ndon't have meetings about it.\nAnd you don't have emails about it, right?\nLike if people have ideas or things,\nthey just add it to the card.\nSo, when that gets up to the active list,\nwe can work on all the information there,\nwe haven't forgotten anything.\nAnd what two word language\ndo you use to describe this first point?\nThis method.\nI love this.\nI called it a poll-based.\npoll-based, right.\nCAL: Workflow management-\nWhat gets pulled up.\nYou pull into the, so\nyou're fixing in advance,\nhere's how much concentration\nI have to give on work.\nAnd you pull stuff into that.\nThe alternative is push-based,\nwhich is how most organizations run,\nwhich is when I want you to do something,\nI just push it onto you,\n[Andrew chuckling]\nand now you have to deal with it.\nGot it.\nI once heard email described\nas a public post to-do list.\nYeah.\nThat made me scared of email in a way\nthat nothing else had.\nIt's Newport's poll-based system,\nI called it that by the way.\nIs this is what in the?\nA lot of the advice in\none of the chapters of the\nnew book, is basically,\nhow do you get away\nwith implementing this?\nAnd when you have a boss.\nAnd there's like all sorts of different,\nso you're your own boss,\nso you can just say,\n\"This is what we're\ndoing, here's the board,\"\nbut there's a lot of like,\nsubtle ways you can do this.\nRight, so that's number one.\nThat's number one.\nCal Newport's poll-based system.\nI'm going to do this, and I'm\nactually going to report back\non this at some point.\nYou won't see the post on social media\n'cause you're not there, but others will.\nAll right, so that's one, all right.\nNumber two would be multi-scale planning.\nOkay.\nSo now, this is planning,\nyou're planning on three different scales.\nDaily, weekly, at least\nseasonally or quarterly,\nhowever you want to think about it.\nSo, you have a plan for like the semester,\nthe season, or the quarter.\nOr like, this is what I'm working on,\nthese are the big\nobjectives I want to hit,\nhere's the reminders to myself\nabout like what matters.\nLike remember, like I'm\noverhauling my workout routine,\nwe're trying to like do\nthis with the podcast.\nYou look at that scale\nof planning every week\nwhen you build your weekly plan.\nAnd the weekly plan,\nit gives freeform text.\nYou don't need anything,\nany special tools.\nYour weekly plan, you're\nlooking at the actual calendar.\nAlright, what for my bigger scale plan,\nmy seasonal quarterly\nplan, what am I trying\nto make sure I can make\nprogress on this week?\nAnd you confront the reality of your week,\nyou see where it's the empty space,\nwhere there's the busy space.\nYou also change what's\non your plate right here.\nIf I cancel this thing, that\nfrees up that whole morning,\nwhich means like, I could\nreally make progress on this,\nwhich I really want to make progress on,\nso great, I'm going to\ncancel that thing on Friday.\nSo, you're looking at the\nwhole week as one unit.\nThen, every day, you\nlook at your weekly plan.\nLike, okay, so I'm going to use this\nwhen I make my plan for the day,\nand when you do your daily\nplan, you do time blocking.\nNow, I'm giving a job to every minute\non my workday, not my day after work,\nbut every minute on my\nworkday, I'm time blocking.\nSo, I call it time blocking,\nas you're literally drawing\nblocks around the free time.\nOkay, this, I'm workin' on\nthis, I'm workin' on this.\nSo, you're making a plan for your day\nthat is informed by the weekly plan.\nSo, in multi-scale\nplanning, you have like,\nthe big picture things you\ncare about, trickle their way\nall the way down to, okay,\nwhat am I going to do\nduring this hour during the day?\nBut you don't have to grapple every,\nthis is what most people do.\nEvery time, I'm figuring\nout what to do next.\nI'm not grappling with all\nthese scales at the same time,\nwhat are my objectives?\nWhat's my big plan?\nWhat's goin' on this week?\nYou're dealing with each of these scales\nwhen the time is right.\nAnd so, when it finally gets\ndown to it's now three o'clock,\nyou're just doing what that block is.\nAnd you figured out\nthat block earlier today\nwhen you looked at your weekly plan,\nthat weekly plan reflected\nwhat was in your semester plan,\nwhich you figured out you\nspent a whole afternoon\nworking on at the\nbeginning of the semester!\nSo, multi-scale planning,\nit keeps you focused on what matters.\nIt prevents you from\nwandering through your day\nand how you disperse your energy.\nAnd it gives you control over\nyour time on different scales,\nfrom like canceling major\nongoing obligations,\nto just being more efficient about\nwhat you do during a given day.\nSo, I swear by multi-scale\nplanning, just to try to keep\nthis whole lumbering ship that\nis sort of like Cal Newport\naiming towards the right shores.\nLike keep correcting and\nkeeping it aimed back.\nI love this.\nThis is more or less what I\ndo with my physical workouts.\nEvery week, I know I'm going to get\nthree resistance training sessions.\nTwo or three cardiovascular\ntraining sessions.\nI know I'm going to train my legs once,\nit's either going to be\non, depending on travel,\nSunday, Monday or Tuesday.\nI'll train torso muscles\nin the middle of the week,\nI'll train sort of limb\naccessory muscles on a Saturday.\nLong run on Sunday or hike\non Sunday, or some other day,\nthere'll be some sort of hit workout\nin the middle of the week,\nand ideally, there's a jog in there too.\nAnd you can adjust it\na little bit based on\nthe reality of the week!\nYeah, I might double up for two days,\nthen take a day off.\nI have my ideal schedule, but sometimes,\nit gets compromised.\nAnd then, I do that for 16 week cycles,\nwhere I vary the kind of\nintensity load, et cetera.\nAnd I've done this for years,\nand it's just kind of works for me.\nYeah!\nNow with cognitive work,\nI don't tend to do this,\nit tends to be more deadline-based.\nBut I think that\nthe poll-based system\nis really going to help.\nIf I dovetail it with\nthis multi-scale planning.\nI love this.\nAnd you can see the deadlines\nnow, you see 'em coming.\nSo, that's part of what's nice\nabout multi-scale planning,\nis you know the deadline's coming up,\nand so when you're doing\nyour semester planning,\nyou start thinking like,\nokay, for the big deadlines,\nlike when I get to December, I need to be\nreally starting getting after this thing\nthat's going to be due.\nYeah, I've got a book due.\nYeah!\nSo, then you know, and so this\nreally helps me book writing.\nBecause now when I'm planning, it's like,\na year in advance, I know\nthis month, I need to get\nlike roughly the rough\ndraft of chapter two done.\nAnd then, that trickles down to my week,\nwhere I'm going to make sure\nI have enough time cleared,\nto like be on track for finishing it.\nAnd then, that trickles into my day.\nNow, I know to like block\nthose mornings to work on it,\nso it all works together.\nAn added bonus of the daily scale is,\nI would say communication\nshould get its own block.\nEmail, social media, whatever,\nthat's like you communicating\nwith the outside world, goes\ninto your time block plan.\nSo if your block doesn't\ninclude that, you don't do it.\nSo, it's like this block is writing,\nit's not email, it's not social media.\nSo, the rule is really simple!\nI'm not going to use\nemail or social media,\nbut I still need to do\nemail at some point,\nso I have to put a block in for it.\nAnd when I'm in my email\nblocks, I'm doing the email,\nif I need to go on social\nmedia to see what's goin' on\nwith like the latest episode or something,\nI got to give that time!\nAnd then, you can mono focus.\nBecause then, it's a psychological hack.\nBut basically, when you particularly,\nwhen you schedule communication\nand distraction, now the only thing\nyou have to muster willpower to do is obey\nthe single rule of I'm\nfollowing my blocks.\nIf you don't do that, if you're like,\nI just sometimes do\nemail and social media,\nand sometimes I don't.\nNow, what you have to\ndo is just constantly be\nhaving this debate, is now\nthe right time to do this?\nI know I'm going to do it at\nsome point today, why not now?\nWell, what about now?\nWhat about now?\nLike, you're just constantly\nasking yourself, right?\nThat's impossible, right?\nThat's going to drain you.\nBut if all you have to do instead is say,\nmy commitment today is\nto follow my blocks,\nand I get I really feel good when I do it,\nand like I check off a box if I do,\ngive yourself some feedback here,\nit's a much easier cognitive battle to win\nthan just trying to be\nreasonable about, well,\nlet me wait a little\nlonger to check my email.\nLike, you're going to lose that battle,\n8 times out of 10, which is like enough\nto really overcome it.\nSo, that's like a hidden\nbonus of time blocking,\nis now you can really get your arms around\nseparating different\ncognitively distinct activities.\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat
