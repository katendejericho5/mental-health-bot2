    "video_title": "Do Binaural Beats Increase Focus & Attention? | Dr. Andrew Huberman",
    "transcript": "- If right now,\nsomeone pulled a fire\nalarm in this building,\nor if we had a fire in this building,\nmy attention would drift.\nIt would not be on recording this podcast,\nit would be on something else.\nBut would I say that the fire\nalarm mediates attention?\nI mean, fire alarms are not\nreally involved in attention.\nNo, rather they modulate my attention.\nThe noise in the room\nmodulates my attention.\nThat's quite a bit different\nthan a tool that I'll provide later,\nand I'll just give you\na little hint of now,\nin fact, I'll give it to you now,\nwhich is that 40 Hz binaural\nbeats have been shown\nin a number of peer-reviewed studies\nto increase focus and concentration.\nAnd if you'd like to\naccess 40 Hz binaural beats\nin order to improve your\nfocus and concentration,\nyou can do that.\nYou can actually get it at zero cost.\nYou can go into the app store,\nfor instance, the Apple App Store.\nThis is also available for Android phone.\nThere's an app called,\nBrainWave, and you can go there,\nyou can dial in 40 Hz,\nand it'll play these binaural beats.\nIt's been shown in multiple\nquality peer-reviewed studies\nthat playing a pattern of\nsound waves to one ear,\ndo, do, do, do do, and the other ear,\nwhich is slightly offset in frequency,\nmeaning not quite the same frequencies,\nso more like do, do, do, do,\nthat that combination of frequencies\nplayed to the different ears,\nactually get integrated\nwithin deep brain centers\nand can increase focus and\nconcentration, in part,\nby increasing levels of\nthe neurochemical dopamine\nand acetylcholine,\nwhich we talked about a little bit earlier\nin this Arrow Model of Focus.\nSo we'll provide a link to that app.\nI don't have any relationship to that app,\nI should mention, but\nit's an excellent one.\nIt's one that I've used for many years.\nThere are also additional\nfunctions within the app\nsuch as for sleep and for other things.\nBut the 40 Hz, 4-0-H-Z\nis the way it reads out,\n40 Hz stimulation has been shown\nto improve focus and concentration.\nHere is my recommendation\nin the way that I use it.\nI would not use 40 Hz binaural beats\nevery time I'm doing a about of work.\nWhat I tend to do is use it\nfor about five minutes prior\nto that work and then turn\nit off and then do the work.\nAnd I'll talk about other\ntools to use during that work,\nwhether or not it's reading or math,\nor even just emailing or\nsomething where I require\na bunch of focus for a while.\nHowever, there are times in\nwhich I'm in an area or I'm\nin a state of mind where I'm\nfeeling very distractable\nand then I'll keep the\n40 Hz binaural beats on\nthe entire time I'm doing\nthat about of cognitive work.\nI'll also sometimes use the\n40 Hz binaural beats prior\nto a workout, in\nparticular weight workouts,\nwhere I really want to be able to focus\non and contract specific muscles.\nSo it's a very useful tool.\nAgain, supported by quality\npeer-reviewed science.\nZero cost available out there,\nnot just in the BrainWave\napp, but in multiple apps.\nI think many of you will benefit from it.\nSome of you might not\nexperience it immediately\nas a total dropping into a tunnel of focus\nin the same way that you might with say,\nthe sorts of neurochemicals\nthat we'll talk about later,\nlike alpha-GPC and some\nof these other things\nthat change neurochemicals directly.\nBut nonetheless 40 Hz binaural beats\nare a very powerful tool.\nAgain, zero cost\nnon-pharmacologic tool that tap\ninto your own endogenous,\nmeaning within you or exists within you,\nphysiology in order to\nincrease acetylcholine\nand some other neurochemicals.\nAnd they have been shown\nto work quite well.\nOkay, so assuming that\nyou are sleeping well,\n80% of the nights of your\nlife are at least working\non the various protocols\nand tools to sleep well\nand sufficiently long, 80%\nof the nights of your life.\nAnd you are interested\nin additional tools that are sound-based\nin order to improve your ability\nto concentrate and focus.\nThere are quality peer-reviewed\nstudies supporting the idea\nthat white noise or pink\nnoise and, believe it or not,\nthere is something called pink noise.\nIt has to do with the specific frequencies\nof sound that are in the noise.\nWell, white noise and\npink noise have been shown\nto not improve concentration per se,\nbut to improve people's\nability to transition\ninto concentrated states.\nSo I don't tend to use\nwhite noise and pink noise\nwhile I work, but I know a\nnumber of people that do.\nI know people that also use\nwhat's called brown noise.\nThe folks I know from the engineering\nand computer science side,\nget really into these\ndetails of white noise,\npink noise, brown noise.\nYou can find white noise,\npink noise, or brown noise,\nand listen to it through\nheadphones or in the room.\nThere is indeed some\ndata to support the fact\nthat white noise and to\nsome extent pink noise\nand brown noise can support the release\nof particular neurochemicals,\nbut more data showing\nthat they can amplify\nthe activity of neurons in the\nso-called prefrontal cortex,\nthis front area, sort of the\nbumper behind your forehead,\nthat is directly related\nto your ability to direct\nyour own focus and remain\nfocused on certain things.\nSo you have the option of\neither using binaural beats\nbefore, but not during your work.\nThat is 40 Hz binaural beats\nor 40 Hz binaural beats\nthroughout your attempt to focus.\nYou also have the option\nof not using binaural beats\nbut using white noise,\npink noise or brown noise.\nAgain, there are a lot of zero cost apps.\nYou can find also white noise,\npink noise and brown noise on YouTube.\nAgain, these are tools\nthat really have been shown\nover and over in humans\nto allow people to focus\nwith more depth and to\ndecrease the transition time\ninto focus.\nThis is a really key point.\nA lot of people are challenged\nwith getting into a mode of focus.\nNone of us, however,\nshould be expected to just\nsit down and drop directly\ninto a state of focus.\nI think that's completely an\nunfair request of ourselves.\nI mean, for instance,\nyou wouldn't expect yourself\nto go out on the track\nor go out for a run and not warm up.\nYou might jog for a few\nminutes or even walk\nbefore you would jog and then\njog before you would run,\nright? I would hope you would do that.\nAnd if you're doing resistance training,\nI doubt that you go over and\nload up the bar or the machine\nwith the maximum amount of\nweight that you can move\nand then just drop right into that.\nYou always do a warmup.\nAnd I think it's very important\nto understand mental work,\nfocus and concentration\nas requiring that warmup.\nWhat is that warmup?\nWell, you know what that warmup is,\nthat warmup is the ramping up\nor the increase of\nepinephrine, adrenaline,\nacetylcholine and dopamine, right?\nThe way that neurochemicals\nwork is we don't\njust get to flip switches in our brain\nbecause we decide to.\nThat's a fantasy,\nthat's sort of the the\nLimitless movie or, you know,\nmovies and ideas that suddenly, you know,\nyou're going to flip a switch on your arm\nand all of a sudden you're\ngoing to be in a laser focus.\nThat is just not the way that\nyour nervous system works.\nThere's a gradual dropping into any state,\nwhether or not that state is sleep, right?\nYou go from shallow sleep\nto deep sleep and then out eventually.\nFocus too,\nyou go from shallow focus\nto increasingly deep focus.\nThat is in our metaphor of the arrow.\nIt's very broad,\nit's pointed at a lot of things.\nAnd over time, as we drop into focus,\nthat arrow is narrowing and\nnarrowing and narrowing.\nIn fact, probably better\nto think about it narrowing\nand then sometimes oscillating\nand getting wider again.\nYou know, we might hear\nsomething down the hallway\nor more typically our phone\nwill buzz or we'll think,\n\"oh, I wonder what so and so is doing,\"\nor, \"I had to contact\nthem about something.\"\nYour focus is dynamic.\nIt is not what we call a step function.\nIt's not like you go\nfrom unfocused to focus\nand then you drop into your maximum focus.\nBy understanding that it's dynamic,\nby understanding that you are\ngoing to be continually going\nin and out of progressively,\nbut varying levels of focus,\nyou will greatly release\nthe pressure on yourself to\nfeel focused all the\ntime when you want to be.\nThis is very key,\npeople who are very good at focusing\nunderstand this and understand\nthat they can't expect themselves\nto just immediately focus\nand then snap into or out of focus.\nOkay, so be patient with\nyourself and also understand\nthat focus is an ability,\nthat you can improve your ability to focus\nby engaging the neural\ncircuits responsible\nfor focus repeatedly over\ntime through so-called\nneuroplasticity,\nthe ability of your nervous\nsystem to change in response\nto experience.\nAnd that has a couple\nof different components\nbut put very simply,\nwhat we repeat gets etched\ninto our nervous system\nand becomes easier over time.\nAnd the more emotionally\nimportant or vital something feels\nto us, the more likely it is\nto trigger neuroplasticity.\nWe're going to talk a little bit more\nabout how to increase neural\ncircuits for focus later.\nBut right now what you have\nin hand is the key importance of sleep.\nAnd I again, will direct\nyou to hubermanlab.com\nand the Neural Network\nNewsletter to really work\non optimizing your sleep.\nWe've also got two\nauditory sound-based tools\nfor improving focus.\nThere's 40 Hz binaural beats used\nbefore or during bouts of\nfocus and concentration.\nAnd if you don't like\nthose, or even if you do,\nyou might alternate them with\nor occasionally use\nwhite noise, pink noise,\nor brown noise also readily\navailable at zero cost.\n[electric guitar]"
