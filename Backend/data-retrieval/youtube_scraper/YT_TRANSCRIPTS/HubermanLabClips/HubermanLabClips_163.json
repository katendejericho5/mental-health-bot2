    "transcript": "- I know many people are\ncurious as to whether or not\ncaffeine can improve\nfocus and concentration.\nAnd indeed it can.\nThere is an immense amount\nof data supporting the idea\nthat caffeine, provided it's consumed\nin the appropriate dosages,\ncan improve mental performance\nand physical performance.\nAnd it largely does that\nthrough improvements\nin focus and concentration.\nThe dosage of caffeine of\ncourse is going to depend\non how caffeine-adapted you are,\nhow much caffeine tolerance you have.\nAnd that is going to vary tremendously\ndepending on whether or not\nyou ingest that caffeine\nwith or without food,\nas I mentioned earlier.\nBut there is a kind of general range\nin which we can talk about\ncaffeine as being useful\nfor focus and concentration.\nAnd the range is basically\nfrom 100 milligrams\nto 400 milligrams.\nI want to caution everybody out there.\nIf you're somebody who\nsuffers from anxiety\nor panic attacks and you're\nnot used to ingesting caffeine\nand you run out and ingest\n400 milligrams of caffeine\nin the form of espresso or yerba mate\nor an energy drink or in pill form,\nthat is going to be very\nuncomfortable for you.\nYou're going to be sweating profusely.\nYour heart rate is going to increase.\nYou're going to be quite panicked in fact\nor at least anxious.\nSo be cautious with your\nuse and adopting of caffeine\nif you're not already caffeine-adapted.\nBut most people do quite\nwell to ingest 100 to 200\nmilligrams of caffeine prior\nto doing some focused work.\nAnd again, I recommend\ndelaying your caffeine intake\nto 90 to 120 minutes after\nwaking unless you are using\nthat caffeine to really jolt\nyour system before a workout.\nCaffeine can of course be\ningested in various forms,\neven pill form, but most\npeople ingest it in the form\nof coffee or my particular favorite way\nto ingest caffeine is yerba mate.\nIt is important and I should note\nthat you should actively\navoid the smoked versions\nof yerba mate as they contain a lot\nof carcinogenic\ncancer-promoting compounds.\nThere's some great yerba\nmate brands out there.\nThe most cost effective way to consume it\nwould be to use the loose leaf tea\nand to pour water over that.\nThere's one particular brand that I like.\nI don't have any affiliation\nto them whatsoever\nbut I've been using it for years.\nIt's Anna Park. It's an\norganic brand that is sold.\nI buy mine on Amazon.\nYou can find it elsewhere\non the internet as well.\nAgain, I don't have any\naffiliation to them.\nIt's just very cost effective, very clean.\nIt doesn't have the smoked flavor,\nat least the one that I buy\nis not the smoked variety\nso none of the carcinogenic\ncompounds are in there,\nat least that I'm aware of.\nAnd I like the way it\ntastes and it provides\na very even lift and\nstimulant that I think\ncertainly works for me and\nthat a number of people I know\nthat I've suggested it to also enjoy.\nYerba mate or caffeine also\nhave other additional benefits.\nIn particular, the caffeine\nin yerba mate and coffee\nand other sources of caffeine are known\nto increase the density and\nefficacy, that is the number\nand the function of dopamine receptors.\nAnd this has been shown\nin humans several times.\nSo by ingesting caffeine pretty regularly,\nyou're actually increasing\nthe ability of dopamine\nto have this effect of\nincreasing motivation and drive.\nI tend to ingest caffeine\nonly early in the day.\nI tend to cut off my caffeine intake\nsomewhere around one or 2:00 PM to ensure\nthat I can get into a good night's sleep.\nBut I realize that there\nare people out there\nthat ingest caffeine\nas late as two or three\nin the afternoon and can still sleep fine.\nI will caution those of you that think\nthat you can drink caffeine in the evening\nor nighttime and still fall asleep.\nAll of the research points to\nthe fact that the architecture\nof your sleep and the depth\nof your sleep is disrupted.\nEven if you're able to\nfall and stay asleep,\nthe sleep you're getting\nis simply not as good\nas the sleep you would get\nif you were to shut off\nyour caffeine intake at least\neight hours before bedtime\nand ideally more like 10 or\neven 12 hours before bedtime.\nBut of course there are\npractical constraints as well.\nOkay, so caffeine is\nincreasing dopamine's function\nby changing the number and\nefficacy of dopamine receptors.\nBut of course it also\nincreases our wakefulness,\nour alertness, and that is largely through\nthe neurochemical systems\nrelated to adenosine,\nwhich is a molecule that\nbuilds up in our brain and body\nthe longer we are awake.\nIt's part of the sleepiness\nsystem, if you will,\nmakes us feel fatigued or tired.\nAnd caffeine also operates\non the epinephrine,\nthe adrenaline system.\nIn fact, if we ingest too much caffeine,\nwe'll sometimes get the jitters.\nThose jitters are really the\nsympathetic as it's called\nnervous system's bias toward movement.\nAnd our pupils will dilate.\nThey actually get broader.\nNow, somewhat paradoxically,\nwhen our pupils get bigger,\nthe pupils of our eyes that is,\nour visual world actually narrows.\nIt becomes more tunnel-like.\nA lot of people don't realize this.\nWhen our pupils are really\nsmall, that means we are relaxed.\nSo if you ever see someone\nreally tiny or, you know,\npin-sized pupils, they're very relaxed.\nIf their pupils are very\nbig, they're very dilated,\nwell then, they are very amped up.\nThey are very, very alert.\nCaffeine increases alertness\nby increasing epinephrine,\nadrenaline release, both in\nthe brain and within the body.\nAnd so that's another\nway that it facilitates\nfocus and concentration.\n[upbeat music]"
