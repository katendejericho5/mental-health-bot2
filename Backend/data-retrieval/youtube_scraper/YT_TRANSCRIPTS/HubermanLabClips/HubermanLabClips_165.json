    "transcript": "- The question I often get is how long\nshould I try to focus?\nWell, the research literature\npoint to the key importance\nof so-called ultradian cycles,\nyou've all probably heard\nof circadian cycles or circadian\nbiology, circa, the day.\nCircadian is about 24 hour cycle.\nWell, our brain and body operate\nwithin that day or within\neach and every day,\nI should say, with 90\nminute ultradian cycles.\nSo my suggestion would be\nanytime you're going to sit down\nand try and focus, you're going\nto try and do a focused about\nof physical exercise or skill\nlearning or musical learning\nor maybe you're even just\nhaving a conversation.\nMaybe you're a therapist\nor you're attending therapy or a class.\nHow long should it be?\nAnd the ideal duration\nis about 90 minutes.\nNot exactly 90 minutes,\nbut we can reliably\nsay 90 minutes or less.\nOkay, it doesn't have to\nbe the full 90 minutes\nbut trying to push\nyourself to be able to drop\ninto two hours of focus or three hours\nof focus while possible,\nis not really in line\nwith what we know about\nthe underlying biology.\nEverything from our sleep states\nor the different stages of sleep\nand our waking states is divided\ninto these 90 minute cycles\nor so called ultradian cycles.\nSo what I like to do is\nset a timer for 90 minutes.\nI acknowledge and accept the fact\nthat under most conditions,\nunless I'm really pressed\nfor a deadline and I'm optimally\ncaffeinated, et cetera,\nthe first five to 10 minutes\nof that 90 minutes are a transition time.\nIt's like the warm up for focus\nbut I do include it in that 90 minutes.\nAnd then I really try and drop\ninto doing focused mental\nwork or learning of some sort.\nAgain, this could be physical\nas well, motor skill learning,\nor think of running or\nlifting weights, et cetera,\nand really try and drop into\nthat across the full 90 minutes\nagain, accepting the fact,\nokay, it's not just an idea.\nThe fact that occasionally\nour focus will flicker.\nIt will jump out of focus.\nAnd then a big part of being able to focus\nis to go back to focusing.\nThe way I'd like you to\nconceptualize this perhaps\nis that arrowhead suddenly\ngetting very, very broad,\nthat you're focusing on many things\nor that arrow shifts to a\ndifferent location in the room.\nThe key is to be able to shift it back\nand to narrow it once again.\nAnd that's an active process, so much so\nthat it requires a lot\nof metabolic energy.\nYour brain is the chief\nconsumer of metabolic energy.\nThe calories that you consume\nis so-called basal metabolic rate.\nMost of that isn't related to movement\nor heartbeat or breathing,\nit's related to brain function.\nYour brain is a glutton with\nrespect to caloric need.\nSo understand that at\nthe end of 90 minutes\nor maybe even after 45 minutes,\nyou might feel rather\ntired or even exhausted.\nAnd it's very important\nthat after a about of focus\nthat you take at least 10\nminutes and ideally as long\nas 30 minutes and go through\nwhat I call deliberate defocus.\nYou really want to focus\non somewhat menial tasks\nor things that really don't require a ton\nof your concentration.\nThis is starting to become a little bit\nof a movement out there in\nthe kind of pop psychology\nand optimization world.\nThis idea of not looking at your phone\nas you walk down the hall to the bathroom,\ncertainly not looking at\nyour phone in the bathroom.\nAnd I should mention, by the way,\nthis is a particular annoyance of mine.\nHave you noticed that wait times\nfor restrooms and public places\nhas increased substantially\nin the last 10 years?\nThe reason for that is not digestive.\nIt's not the gut microbiome.\nI mean, it might be the gut microbiome,\nbut chances are it's because people\nare on their phones in the bathroom.\nSo you're doing yourself\nand everybody else a favor\nby staying off your phone in the restroom,\nstaying off your phone\nwhile walking down the hall,\ntry and give yourself some\ntime to deliberately decompress\nto let your mental states idle,\nto not be focused on any one thing.\nThat period of idling is essential\nfor your ability to focus,\nmuch in the same way that rest\nbetween sets of resistance training\nor rest between exercise\nis vital to being able\nto focus and perform\nduring the actual sets\nor during the actual bouts\nof running or cycling\nor whatever your particular\nform of exercise might be.\nSo deliberate decompression is key.\nAnd I know this is hard\nbecause we're all being drawn\nin by the incredible rich array\nof sensory information available\non our phones and other devices.\nBut I can't emphasize this enough.\nOur ability to focus is not\njust related to what happens\nduring the entry and movement\nthrough those focus bouts,\nbut after those focus bouts.\nWe really need to deliberately decompress.\nAnd of course the ultimate decompress,\nthe time in which we are not directing\nour thinking interaction is during sleep.\nAnd so it's no wonder, or I should say\nit holds together\nlogically, that that deep\nlong lasting duration of not controlling\nwhere our mind is at is in fact,\nthe ultimate form of restoration\neven if we have very intense dreams.\nSo take that period after each\n90 minute or less focus about.\nRemember those focus bouts don't\nhave to be full 90 minutes.\nLet's see you do 45 minutes of work.\nYou're just done with it, set it down,\nand go do something for maybe 5, 10,\nmaybe even 30 minutes that\nis functional for your day,\njust not just walking around in circles,\nor staring up the sky, although\nif you can do that, do that.\nBut most of us have other things to do\nbut do things that are rather automatic\nor reflexive for you and try\nnot to do any focused reading,\ntry not to bring your\nvision into a tight location\nsuch as your phone and trying\ndeliberately decompress\nbecause that will allow you to drop\ninto intense bouts of focus again\nrepeatedly and repeatedly\nthroughout the day.\n[rock 'n roll music]"
