    "video_title": "What Causes Stuttering & Treatment for Stutter | Dr. Erich Jarvis & Dr. Andrew Huberman",
    "transcript": "- What's being developed in\nterms of treatments for stutter?\n- Yeah, so we actually accidentally\ncame across stuttering in songbirds\nand we've published several papers on this\nto try to figure out the\nneurobiological basis.\nThe first study we had was a brain area\ncalled the basal ganglia,\nthe striatum part\nof the basal ganglia involved\nin coordinating movements,\nlearning how to make\nmovements, when it was damaged\nin a speech-like pathway in these birds.\nWhat we found is that\nthey started to stutter\nas the brain region recovered.\nAnd unlike humans, they actually recovered\nafter three or four months,\nand why is that the case?\nBecause bird brains\nundergo new neurogenesis\nin a way that human or\nmammal brains don't.\nAnd it was the new neurons\nthat were coming in\ninto the circuit, but not quite\nwith the right proper activity\nwas resulting in this\nstuttering in these birds.\nAnd after it was repaired,\nnot exactly the old song\ncame back after the repair,\nbut still it recovered a lot better.\nAnd it's now known, they\ncall this neurogenics\nstuttering in humans with\ndamage to the basal ganglia\nor some type of disruption\nto the basal ganglia\nat a young age, also causes\nstuttering in humans.\nAnd even those who are\nborn with stuttering,\nit's often the basal ganglia\nthat's disrupted than\nsome other brain circuit,\nand we think the speech\npart of the basal ganglia.\n- Can adults who maintain a stutter\nfrom childhood repair that stutter?\n- They can repair it with therapy,\nwith learning how to speak slower,\nlearning how to tap out a rhythm,\nso I said, and yeah, I'm\nnot a speech pathologist\nbut I started reading this literature\nand talking to others,\nthat you know, colleagues\nwho actually study stuttering.\nSo yes, there are ways to overcome\nthe stuttering through behavioral therapy.\nAnd I think all of the tools out there\nhave something to do with\nsensory motor integration,\ncontrolling what you\nhear with what you output\nin a thoughtful controlled way\nhelps reduce the stuttering.\n- There are a couple\nexamples from real life\nthat I want to touch on and\none is somewhat facetious,\nbut now I realize is a\nserious neurobiological issue.\nSerious meaning I think interesting,\nwhich is that every once in a while,\nI will have a conversation\nwith somebody who says\nthe last word of the\nsentence along with me.\nAnd it seems annoying in some instances,\nbut I'm guessing this\nis just a breakthrough\nof the motor pattern that\nthey're hearing what I'm saying\nvery well, so I'm going\nto interpret this kindly\nand think they're hearing what I'm saying.\nThey're literally\nhearing it in their mind,\nand they're getting that low\nlevel electrical activity\nto their throat, and\nthey're just joining me\nin the enunciation of what I'm saying,\nprobably without realizing it.\nCan we assume that that might be the case?\n- Well, I wouldn't be surprised\nso that the motor theory\nof speech perception where\nthis idea originally came,\nwhat you hear is going\nthrough your speech circuit\nand then also activating\nthose muscles slightly.\nSo yes, so one might argue,\nokay, is that speech circuit\nnow interpreting what\nthat person is speaking?\nNow you listening to me and\nis going to finish it off\nbecause it's already\ngoing through their brain\nand they can predict it,\nthat would be one theory.\nAnd I don't think the verdict\nout there is known, but that's one.\nThe other is synchronizing turn taking\nin the conversation where\nyou're acknowledging\nthat we understand each other\nby finishing off what I say.\nAnd it's almost like a\nsocial bonding kind of thing.\nThe other could be, I\nwant the person to shut up\nso I can speak as well and take that turn.\nAnd each pair of people have a\nrhythm to their conversation.\nAnd if you have somebody\nwho's over talkative\nversus under talkative or vice versa,\nthat rhythm can be lost\nin them finishing ideas\nand going back and forth.\nBut I think having something to do\nwith turn taking as well,\nmakes a lot of sense.\n- I have a colleague at Stanford who says\nthat \"Interruption is a sign of interest.\"\n[Erich laughing]\nI'm not sure that everyone agrees,\nI think it's highly contextual.\nBut there is this form of a verbal nod\nof saying hmm-mm, or things of that sort.\nAnd there are many of these.\nAnd I'm often told by my audience\nthat I interrupt my guests\nand things of that sort.\nOftentimes I'll just get caught\nin the natural flow of the conversation.\n- Well, I think we've had pretty good\nturn taking here, I hope.\n- So far so good.\n- I feel that way.\n- I'm glad you feel that way,\nbecause especially in the context\nof a discussion about\nlanguage seems important.\n[upbeat music]"
