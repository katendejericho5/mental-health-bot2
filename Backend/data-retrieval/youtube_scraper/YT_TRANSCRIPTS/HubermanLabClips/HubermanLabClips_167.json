    "transcript": "- How similar or different\nare the brain areas\ncontrolling speech and language\nin, say, a songbird and\na young human child.\n- Yeah, so going back to the 1950s,\nand even a little earlier,\nPeter Marler and others\nwho had got involved in\nneuroethology, the study of\nneurobiology of behavior\nin a natural way, right?\nThey start to find that behaviorally\nthere are these species of birds,\nlike song birds and parrots,\nand now we also know\nhummingbirds, just three of them,\nout of the 40 something bird groups\nout there on the planet, orders,\nthat they can imitate sounds like we do.\nAnd so that was a similarity.\nIn other words, they had\nthis kind of behavior\nthat's more similar to us\nthan chimpanzees have with us,\nor than chickens have with them, right?\nThey're closer relatives.\nAnd then they discovered\neven more similarities.\nThese critical periods\nthat if you remove a child,\nand this unfortunately\nhappens where a child is feral\nand is not raised with human\nand goes to their puberty phase of growth,\nit becomes hard for them to\nlearn a language as an adult.\nSo there's this critical\nperiod where you learn best.\nAnd even later on, when\nyou're in regular society,\nit's hard to learn.\nBirds undergo these same thing.\nAnd then it was discovered\nthat if they become deaf,\nwe humans become deaf, our\nspeech starts to deteriorate\nwithout any kind of therapy.\nIf a non-human primate, or let's\nsay a chicken becomes deaf,\ntheir vocalizations don't deteriorate.\nVery little at least.\nWell, this happens in\nthe vocal learning birds.\nSo there are all these\nbehavioral parallels\nthat came along with a package.\nAnd then people looked into the brain.\nFernando Nottebohm,\nmy former PhD advisor, and\nbegan to discover the area X.\nYou talked about, the robust nucleus\nof the arcopallium and these\nbrain pathways were not found\nin the species who couldn't imitate.\nSo there was a parallel here\nand then jumping many years\nlater, I started to dig\ndown into these brain circuits to discover\nthat these brain circuits\nhave parallel functions\nwith the brain circuits for\nhumans, even though they're\nby a different name, like brocas\nand laryngeal motor cortex.\nAnd most recently we discovered not only\nthe actual circuitry, the\nconnectivity are similar\nbut the underlying\ngenes that are expressed\nin these brain regions\nin a specialized way\ndifferent from the rest of\nthe brain are also similar\nbetween humans and songbirds and parrots.\nSo all the way down to the genes.\nAnd now we're finding\nthe specific mutations\nare also similar, not always\nidentical, but similar\nwhich indicates remarkable convergence\nfor a so-called complex\nbehavior in species separated\nby 300 million years\nfrom a common ancestor.\nAnd not only that, we are\ndiscovering that mutations\nin these genes that cause\nspeech deficits in humans\nlike in FOXP2\nif you put those same mutations\nor similar type of deficits\nin these vocal learning birds,\nyou get similar deficits.\nSo convergence of the\nbehavior is associated\nwith similar genetic\ndisorders of the behavior.\n- Incredible. I have to ask\ndo hummingbirds sing or do they hum?\n- Hummingbirds hum\nwith their wings and\nsing with their searings\n- In a coordinated way?\n- In a coordinated way.\nThere's some species of\nhummingbirds that actually\nwill - Doug Altshuler showed\nthis that will flap their wings\nand create a slapping\nsound with their wings.\nThat's in unison with their song\nand you would not know it, but it sounds\nlike a particular syllable\nin their songs, even\nthough it's their wings and\ntheir voice at the same time\n- Hummingbirds are clapping to their song\n- Clapping with their they're\nsnapping their wings together\nin unison with a song to make it like\nif I'm going ba da, da, da,\nba, da\nand I banged on the table,\nexcept they make it almost sound\nlike their voice with their wings.\n- Incredible\n- Yes.\n- And they got some of the smallest brain\n- I guess kids would\nsay mind blown, right?\n- Yes. Yes.\nIncredible.\n- Yes.\n- Incredible. I love hummingbirds.\nAnd I always feel like it's\nsuch a special thing to get\nin a moment to see one because\nthey move around so fast\nand they flit away so fast in\nthese ballistic trajectories\nthat when you get to see\none stationary for a moment\nor even just hovering there\nyou feel like you're extracting so much\nfrom their little microcosm of life.\nBut now I realize they're\nplaying music essentially.\n- Yeah, exactly. Right.\n- And what's amazing about hummingbirds\nand we're going to say\nvocal learning species\nin general is that for whatever reason\nthey seem to evolve\nmultiple complex traits.\nThis idea that the evolving\nlanguage spoken language\nin particular comes along\nwith a set of specializations.\n- Incredible.\n- When I was coming up in\nneuroscience, I learned\nthat I think it was the\nwork of Peter Marler,\nthat young birds learn, songbirds,\nlearn their tutor's song\nand learn it quite well, but\nthat they could learn the song\nof another tutor.\nIn other words, they could\nlearn a different - and\nfor the listeners, I'm\ndoing air quotes here, -\na different language, a\ndifferent bird song, different\nthan their own species\nsong, but never as well\nas they could learn their\nown natural genetically\nlinked song.\n- Yes.\n- Genetically linked,\nmeaning that they would be\nlike me being raised\nin a different culture.\nAnd that I would learn the other language,\nbut not as well as I would\nhave learned English.\nThis is the idea.\n- Yes.\n- Is that true?\n- That is true.\nYes. And that's what I\nlearned growing up as well\nand talked to Peter Marler\nhimself about before he passed.\nYeah. This\nhe used to call it the innate\npredisposition to learn.\nAll right, so\nwhich would be kind of the equivalent\nin the linguistic community\nof universal grammar.\nThere is something\ngenetically influencing our\nvocal communication on top\nof what we learn culturally.\nAnd so there's this balance\nbetween the genetic control of speech,\nor a song in these birds, and\nthe learned cultural control.\nSo yes, if you were to take,\nI mean, in this case\nwe actually tried this\nat Rockefeller later on,\ntake a Zebra finch and\nraise it with a canary.\nIt would sing a song that was sort of\nlike a hybrid in between.\nWe call it a \"can-inch\" and\nvice versa for the Canary\nbecause there's something different\nabout their vocal musculature\nor the circuitry in the brain.\nAnd with a Zebra finch, even\nwith a closely related species\nif you would take a Zebra\nfinch, a young animal and\nin one cage next to it, place\nits own species, adult male\nand in the other cage place\na Bengalese finch next to it.\nIt would preferably learn the song\nfrom the its own species neighbor.\nBut if you remove its neighbor\nit would learn that\nBengalese finch very well.\n- Fantastic.\n- So it has something to do\nwith also the social bonding\nwith your own species.\n- Incredible. That\nraises a question that I\nbased on something I\nalso heard, but I don't\nhave any scientific peer\nreviewed publication to point to\nwhich is this idea of pigeon,\nnot the bird, but this idea\nof when multiple cultures\nand languages converge\nin a given geographic\narea, that the children\nof all the different\nnative languages will come\nup with their own language.\nI think this was in island culture\nmaybe in Hawaii called pigeon,\nwhich is sort of a hybrid\nof the various languages\nthat their parents speak\nat home and that they themselves speak.\nAnd that somehow pigeon\nagain, not the bird,\nbut a language called pigeon. For reasons\nI don't know,\nharbors certain basic\nelements of all language.\nIs that true?\nIs that not true?\n- I haven't studied enough myself\nin terms of pigeon specifically, but\nin terms of cultural evolution\nof language and hybridization\nbetween different cultures and\nso forth, even amongst birds\nwith different dialects and\nyou bring them together.\nWhat is going on here\nis cultural evolution\nremarkably tracked genetic evolution.\nSo if you bring people\nfrom two separate populations\ntogether that have been\nin their separate\npopulations, evolutionarily\nat least, for hundreds of generations.\nSo someone speaking, Chinese,\nsomeone speaking English\nand that child then's learning\nfrom both of them, yes.\nThat child's going to be able\nto pick up and merge phonemes\nand words together in a way that an adult\nwouldn't because why they're\nexperiencing both languages\nat the same time during\ntheir critical period years\nin a way that adults would\nnot be able to experience.\nAnd so you get a hybrid\nand the lowest common\ndenominator is going\nto be what they share.\nAnd so the phonemes that they've retained\nin each of their\nlanguages is what's going to be\nI imagine used the most.\n[strumming guitar music]"
