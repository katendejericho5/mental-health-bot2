    "transcript": "- As we read,\nwe are generating very low levels\nof motor activity in our throat.\nThat is, we are speaking the\nwords that we are reading\nat a level below the perception of sound,\nor our own perception of those words.\nBut if one were to put an\namplifier or to measure\nthe firing of those\nmuscles in our vocal cords,\nwe'd find that as we're\nreading information,\nwe are actually speaking that information."
