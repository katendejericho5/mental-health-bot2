    "transcript": "- Hangover is a constellation\nof effects ranging\nfrom headache to nausea, to\nwhat sometimes called hangxiety\nwhich is anxiety that\nfollows a day of drinking.\nHangxiety, I think we can\nunderstand physiologically\nif we think about that process\nof alcohol intake increasing\nthe amount of cortisol\nand the ratio of cortisol to\nsome other stress hormones.\nThat well explains why some\npeople wake up the day after,\nor even the day, the day\nafter a night drinking\nand feel anxious and not well and stressed\nfor reasons they don't understand.\nSo, if you're somebody\nwho experiences hangxiety,\nthen again I refer you to\nthe master stress episode\nthat we put out some time\nago, and you can find\nthat at hubermanlab.com,\ntools to deal with hangxiety,\ntools to deal with stress\nranging again from behavioral\nto nutritional,\nsupplement-based, et cetera.\nThat of course is not\njustification for going out\nand drinking so much that you\nget hangxiety-induced hangover\nbut for those of you that are experiencing\npost-alcohol consumption\nhangxiety, as it were,\nthat could be a useful resource\nbecause I certainly don't\nwant anyone experiencing\nuncomfortable amounts of hangxiety.\nAnd there are great tools\nand resources for that.\nNow, the other aspects of\nhangover, such as the stomach ache\nor headache, or feelings\nof malaise or fogginess,\nthose could be related to a\nnumber of different things\nand probably are related to\na number of different things.\nFirst of all, the sleep that one gets\nafter even just one, yes,\neven just one glass of wine\nor a beer is not the\nsame sleep that you get\nwhen you don't have alcohol\ncirculating in your system.\nAnd not trying to be a downer here,\nbut this was discussed in the\nHuberman Lab Podcast episode\nwhere I had Dr. Matthew\nWalker from UC Berkeley on.\nAnd of course, Dr. Walker\nis a world expert in sleep.\nRuns one of the preeminent\nlaboratories studying sleep\nand its effects, wrote\nthe incredible book,\n\"Why We Sleep,\" and so on.\nDr. Walker told me, and it\ncertainly is supported by lots\nand lots of quality\npeer-reviewed studies in animals\nand in humans that when\nalcohol is present in the brain\nand bloodstream, that the architecture\nof sleep is disrupted, slow\nwave sleep, deep sleep,\nand rapid eye movement sleep,\nall of which are essential\nfor getting restorative night's\nsleep are all disrupted.\nSo for those of you that\nare drinking a glass\nor two of wine, or having\na hard liquor drink,\nor a beer in order to fall asleep,\nthe sleep you're getting is\nsimply not high quality sleep,\nor certainly not as high quality\nas the sleep you'd be getting\nif you did not have\nalcohol in your system.\nOf course, when we're\ntalking about hangover,\nwe're talking generally\nabout the consumption\nof more than just one or two drinks.\nOf course, for some people,\none or two drinks is probably\nsufficient to induce hangover\nbut for most people it's going\nto be having three or four,\nexceeding their typical\nlimit as it's called.\nAgain, not the legal limit,\nthat's a whole other business.\nBut when one ingests too\nmuch alcohol for them,\none of the reasons they feel\nterrible the next day is\nbecause their sleep\nisn't really good sleep.\nIn fact, it's not even sleep.\nIt's often considered pseudo\nsleep, or at least that's\nwhat it's called in\nthe sleep science field\nbecause people are in kind\nof a low level hypnotic\nkind of trance, is not real sleep.\nThere are multiple bouts of waking up.\nThey may not even realize\nthey're waking up multiple times.\nOkay, so there's the\nsleep-induced effects.\nThen there are the disrupted\ngut microbiome effects,\nsome of which we talked about earlier.\nSo now you understand the mechanism\nof alcohol destroying good,\nhealthy gut microbiota\nwhich then leads to leaky\ngut and things of that sort.\nBut one could imagine,\nagain, could imagine,\nand there is some evidence\nstarting to support this,\nthat again, ingesting\nlow sugar fermented foods\nor maybe in prebiotic or probiotic\nto support the gut microbiome\nmight assist in some\nof the gut-related malaise\nassociated with hangover.\nIn other words, get those\ngut microbiota healthy again\nas quickly as possible, or\nmaybe even before you drink,\nhave those gut microbiota healthy.\nI would hope that you would do that.\nI think everybody should\nbe doing something\nto support their gut microbiome,\nwhether or not it's the ingestion\nof low sugar fermented foods daily,\nor at least on a regular basis,\nor ingestion of probiotic or prebiotic.\nThe gut microbiome is so important\nfor so many different things.\nIn terms of hangover and head ache,\nwe know that that's caused\nby vasoconstriction,\nthe constriction of blood\nvessels that tends to occur\nas a rebound after a night of drinking.\nAlcohol can act as a vasodilator,\nit can dilate the blood vessels.\nPart of that is associated\nwith the increase in so-called\nparasympathetic tone.\nWe have an autonomic nervous system.\nIt's got a sympathetic component.\nThese are neurons that make us more alert.\nAnd if they're very active,\nthey make us very stressed.\nThere's also the parasympathetic aspect\nof the autonomic nervous system.\nThis is all just fancy geek speak\nfor the parts of your brain and body,\nthe nerve cells that\nmake you very relaxed.\nWhen you're very relaxed,\nthere tends to be vasodilation.\nIt allows for more movement of blood\nand other things through the bloodstream.\nAnd alcohol tends to\ninduce some vasodilation\nat least in some of the capillary beds.\nAnd then when the alcohol wears off,\nthere's a vasoconstriction and\npeople get brutal headaches.\nThat's why some people will take aspirin\nor Tylenol or Advil or things like that,\nthe sort of non-steroid\nanti-inflammatories.\nI should mention there's a lot\nof literature coming out that\nsome of these non-steroid,\nanti-inflammatory drugs are not good\nfor us for a number of different reasons.\nThe way they impact the liver,\nthe way they impact the immune system.\nAnd no surprise, the way they\nimpact the gut microbiome.\nSo I'm not one to tell you\nwhat medications to take\nor not take, but you certainly would want\nto do a a quick web search of effects\nof non-steroid,\nanti-inflammatories and aspirin\nbefore you start taking those,\nor stop taking those for that matter.\nGenerally they will alleviate headache,\nbut they can often have other\nissues including liver issues.\nAnd keep in mind the night after drinking\nyour liver is already taken a beating\nbecause of the need of the\nliver to convert alcohol\nfrom acetaldehyde into acetate\nwhich is now a pathway\nthat you well understand.\nSo, I'm not certain,\nand in fact, I believe\nit's not the greatest idea\nto burden your liver\nfurther through the use\nof things that are going to cause it\nto have to work harder\nand metabolize things\nif the goal is simply\nto alleviate a headache.\nThere's a lot of kind of lore,\nold school lore about how\nto relieve a hangover.\nWe already talked about how\neating food won't do that\nbut eating food will\nprevent the rapid absorption\nof even more alcohol into the bloodstream.\nThere's the lore that one should\nsimply ingest more alcohol.\nWhat terrible advice that is,\nthat's just going to delay\nan even worse hangover.\nHowever, I'd be remiss if I didn't say\nthat the reason that that myth came to be,\nor that I should say\nthat truth came to be,\nbecause indeed ingesting\nmore alcohol will alleviate a hangover\nbut then a worse hangover will show up.\nThe reason that came to\nbe is because ingesting\nmore alcohol will cause\nthose constricted vessels\nthat are giving the\nheadache to dilate again.\nBut of course, ingesting more alcohol\nto relieve a hangover\nis simply a bad idea.\nJust don't do it.\nI think this is called the\nhair of the dog approach.\nMaybe someone can put in the\nshow note captions on YouTube\nwhy it's called the hair of the dog.\nI can come up with a few ideas,\nbut they're not going\nto be very good ones.\nAnd some of them would probably\neven be outright ridiculous.\nSo, do not ingest more\nalcohol simply to try\nand recover from a hangover.\nI know many people have\ntried that one before,\nbut that's a terrible idea.\nNow, one thing that you'll\nalso hear out there is\nthat deliberate cold exposure,\nfor instance taking a cold\nshower, might relieve hangover.\nI find this one particularly interesting\nbecause we've done\nepisodes on the benefits\nof deliberate cold exposure.\nWe have an entire episode about that.\nYou can find it again, hubermanlab.com,\nthere are direct links to\nsome of the tools related\nto deliberate cold exposure.\nAnd we have an entire newsletter\non deliberate cold exposure protocols.\nYou can find on hubermanlab.com,\nour Neural Network Newsletter.\nSo those of you that are\ninterested in ice baths\nand cold showers and\nways to leverage those,\nyou can find that there.\nWhat you won't find there is a description\nof how to use deliberate cold exposure\nfor sake of treating hangover.\nBut here I went into the literature\nand I found something kind of interesting.\nThere is some evidence\nthat increasing levels\nof epinephrine in the\nbloodstream can actually help\nwith alcohol clearance.\nThat was very surprising to me.\nAnd I want to point\nout this is not a large\nand robust literature, but\nthere's some evidence pointing\nto the fact that when\nlevels of epinephrine,\nadrenaline are raised in\nthe brain and bloodstream,\nthat some of the components\nof alcohol metabolism can be accelerated.\nAnd some of the inebriating effects\nof alcohol can be reduced.\nSo maybe this old school lore\nof taking a cold shower\nactually has something to it.\nSo in thinking about the use\nof deliberate cold exposure\nin order to reduce the effects of hangover\nor to more rapidly clear alcohol\nfrom the brain and bloodstream.\nI want to be very clear and I\nwant to emphasize your safety.\nThe way to do that is to understand\nthat alcohol lowers core\nbody temperature, okay?\nIt can make people slightly hypothermic.\nIt's going to drop core body temperature.\nSo, if you were inebriated and you went\nand got into a body of water, right,\na pool or a lake or something,\nfirst of all, that's\nextremely dangerous to do\nwhile you're inebriated, right?\nPeople drown all the time.\nPeople drown, they die as a\nconsequence of doing that,\nso please don't do that.\nBut also, if it's very cold water,\nyour core body temperature is\ngoing to drop even further.\nNow, if you've heard the\nepisodes that I've done\non deliberate cold exposure previously,\nI've talked about how normally\nwhen people are not\ningesting alcohol they get\ninto an ice bath or a cold shower\nand their body temperature initially dips\nbut then it rebounds and increases.\nThat's a process that's going to occur\nwhen people do not have\nalcohol in their system.\nWhen you have alcohol in your system,\none of the reasons that\nyou become hypothermic is\nbecause there's a disruption\nin those hypothalamic brain areas,\nin particular the brain area called the\nmedial preoptic area that\nregulates core body temperature.\nSo it's not so much that\nalcohol makes you cold,\nit's that alcohol disrupts\nthe central command centers\nof the brain that control\ntemperature regulation.\nAnd that leads you to\nbe slightly hypothermic.\nSo if you then go get\ninto a very cold lake,\nor you get into even a cold\nshower, or an ice bath,\nthere's the possibility of you going very,\nvery far down the ladder into\nvery hypothermic territory.\nAnd that can be very dangerous.\nNow, in terms of dealing with hangover\nwhen the alcohol has been\nlargely cleared from your system.\nWell, that's where some of\nthis kind of old lore combines\nwith some of the modern science and says,\n\"Well, if you can spike\nadrenaline and certainly getting\ninto an ice bath or\ngetting into a cold shower,\nor any kind of cold body of water,\nprovided you can do that safely.\nThat will sharply\nincrease your adrenaline.\"\nAnd I should say your\ndopamine, that's been shown.\nAnd we've talked about this on the podcast\nbefore you get these\nlong extended increases,\nseveral hours of increases in dopamine\nfrom deliberate cold exposure.\nIt's well documented\nin humans, by the way.\nSo, one could imagine using\ndeliberate cold exposure\nas a way to accelerate the\nrecovery from hangover.\nProvided that's done safely,\nI think there's no reason\nto not explore that.\nAnd if you wonder what safely is\nand what temperatures to use,\nplease check out the episode\non deliberate cold exposure.\nCold showers therefore\nmight actually be one way\nto at least partially relieve hangover.\nCertainly the science from various places\nin the literature converged to say that,\nbut again, be careful.\nPlease, please, please\nbe careful not to get\ninto cold water when you are inebriated.\nIt's absolutely dangerous\nfor all the obvious reasons.\nAnd it's dangerous also for\nthe non-obvious reasons,\nnot the least of which\nis the dramatic decreases\nin core body temperature\nthat can make you dangerously hypothermic.\nNow, how would you go about\nusing deliberate cold exposure\nto accelerate recovery from hangover?\nWell, there, I would look to the kind\nof standard protocols of, you\nknow, one to three minutes,\nor maybe even six minutes\nif you can tolerate,\nor if you're really cold adapted,\nmaybe you do seven or 10\nminutes in a cold shower.\nAlthough, that could be a lot.\nMost people are going to\nexperience a sharp increase\nin epinephrine, in adrenaline,\nand a long lasting increase in dopamine\nfrom one to three minutes\nof deliberate cold exposure.\nIdeally done immersion up to the neck.\nAgain, do this safely,\nplease, please, please,\nor a cold shower where you're\ngetting under the shower\nas much as possible.\nHow cold?\nWell, that's going to\nvary person to person.\nI suggest making it as\ncold as is uncomfortable\nsuch that you really want to get out,\nbut then you know you can stay in safely\nwithout for instance giving\nyourself a heart attack.\nBecause if the water\nis really, really cold,\nof course you could give\nyourself a heart attack.\nMost showers won't go that cold.\nAlthough, probably some will.\nAgain, please use caution,\nspike your adrenaline,\nspike your dopamine with\ndeliberate cold exposure safely.\nOther components of hangover\nthat could be good targets for\ntrying to alleviate hangover.\nAnd here I hope you are\ngetting the picture,\nbecause it is accurate to say\nthat hangover is a\nmultifaceted phenomenon.\nIt's not like one\nmolecule and one receptor.\nIt's a bunch of things\nhappening in the brain and body.\nBut is the dehydration\nassociated with alcohol?\nAlcohol is a diuretic\nfor multiple reasons.\nIt causes people to excrete not only water\nbut also sodium.\nSodium is an electrolyte critical\nfor the function of neurons.\nSo making sure that you have\nenough sodium, potassium,\nand magnesium, so-called\nelectrolytes is going to\nbe important for proper brain function,\nbodily organ function.\nEven for people that have just had one\nor two drinks the night before,\nit's likely that your electrolyte balance\nand your fluid balance\nis going to be disrupted.\nThat's because alcohol\nalso disrupts the so-called\nvasopressin pathway.\nI talked a lot about vasopressin\nand the way that it interacts with\nand controls different\naspects of water retention\nand water release from the\nbody in the form of urine\nin the episode on salt.\nSo you, again, I'm\nreferring to hubermanlab.com\nas the site where you can find\nthat episode on salt balance\nand ways to restore electrolyte balance.\nHaving your electrolytes\nat the proper levels\nbefore you drink is ideal.\nSome people will say,\n\"For every glass of alcohol that you drink\nyou should drink one glass of water.\"\nI would say better would\nbe two glasses of water,\ngiven the dehydrating effects of alcohol.\nAnd even better would be\nwater with electrolytes.\nThat certainly would set you up\nfor a better day the next day.\nAnd if you don't manage to do that,\n'cause I suppose it's kind\nof geeky walking around\nwith electrolyte packets\nout at the bar or whatnot.\nAlthough, you know, geeky\nin my book is a good thing.\nThe next day you could take\nsome electrolytes upon waking,\nmaybe even some before you go to sleep\nat the night of drinking.\nSo, hangovers made worse\nby disturbed sleep,\nmade worse by disrupted gut microbiome,\nmade worse by disrupted electrolytes,\nmade worse by the depletion\nof epinephrine and dopamine.\nThat's why replenishing the\nmicrobiome with fermented foods,\nlow sugar fermented foods that is,\nthat's why using safe,\ndeliberate cold exposure\nfor spiking adrenaline and\nfor increasing dopamine.\nAnd that's why consuming electrolytes are\nall going to be beneficial.\n[upbeat music]"
