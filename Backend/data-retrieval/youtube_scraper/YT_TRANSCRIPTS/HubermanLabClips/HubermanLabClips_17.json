    "transcript": "So I wrote a book 10 years ago\nwhere I was trying to\nfigure out as part of it,\nhow do people get better at things?\nAnd so I spent time with a\nprofessional guitar player\nand said, \"I just wanted\nto see how he practiced.\"\nLike, what does this actually look like?\nAnd what I learned from them\nis like, what they do is,\nyeah, they have the\nmusic in front of them,\nbut for them it's all speed.\nSo they take a piece, like\nhe was working on licks for,\nhe was a new acoustic style player,\nand he had these kind of\nbluegrassy type licks,\nand he probably had it memorized,\nand he knew how fast he\ncould comfortably play it.\nFor them, it's all about adding 20%\nto what they're comfortably doing,\nand then that push past\nwhere they're comfortable.\nAnd the thing I remember\nwriting about him was,\nhe was concentrating so hard\nto try to hit this lick 20%\nfaster than he was used to,\nit is he'd forget to breathe.\nSo he'd be like going, going,\ngoing, and then just gasp!\nYou know, like, 'cause his body\nwould force him to breathe.\nSo, yeah, there it seemed to be\nall about deliberate practice.\nSo, like how do you...\nThey don't waste any time.\nProfessional musicians waste no time\ndoing things they're comfortable doing.\nEvery time they spend practicing,\nand this is also incredibly difficult,\nbut every time they spend practicing,\nit's almost entirely in a state of,\n\"I'm not comfortable with this,\nbut if I focus as hard as I can,\nmaybe I'm going to pull this off.\"\nLike I'll pull off the sonata\nat this new speed I'm trying to do.\nMaybe I'll pull it off.\nIt's like the maximal\ngrowth stimulating state.\nAnd so I wrote in this chapter,\n\"Why was he so much better at guitar\nthan I was at the same age?\"\n'Cause I played a lot of\nguitar when I was younger\nand was in rock bands, right?\nAnd this kid was young, right?\nBut really, really good.\nAnd I said, \"Okay, now I realize it.\"\nI can recognize me when I look back\nat my time playing guitar at his age.\nI played stuff I knew how to play.\nLike, that's what was fun.\nLike, yeah, I want to like jam\nalong with the songs I knew\nor, you know, rip some pentatonic scales,\nto like a Jimi Hendrix album.\nIt was fun. And he spent almost no time.\nThe pro spent no time having fun.\nPracticing was your brain had to be,\nyou know, uncomfortable.\nSo I've learned a lot from that, you know?\nThis actually led to a bit of\na battle, because my readers,\nthere was this battle that\nemerged where people were trying\nto combine Anders Erickson\nand deliberate practice\nwith Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and flow.\nAnd really, they were trying\nto make flow apply everywhere.\nLike, it's all about flow.\nDeliberate practice is\nflow, everything is flow.\nThe whole thing is to\nget into a state of flow.\nAnd I remember Anders talking\nabout this at some point\nand say like, \"No, no, no,\nlike the state of practice\nthat makes you better.\"\nIt's the opposite of flow, right?\nIn flow, you lose track of time.\nWhen you're practicing like\nthat professional guitar player,\nyou know every second that passes by\nbecause it's like incredibly difficult.\nLike, what you're doing,\nyour mind is rebelling.\nIt's not natural. You know, it's not fun.\nIt's not the skier going down the hill,\nand it's all instinct.\nIt's all you thinking about\nexactly what you're trying to do.\nAnd so, you know, I began\nto push this point out here.\nIt's like, it's not all about flow.\nLike actually getting better at things\nis really painful sometimes.\nDeliberate practice is\nnot the same as flow.\nAnd there was a lot of fights\nabout this for a while.\nI think there was a lot of flow advocates\nthat just wanted life\nto be flow all the time.\nBut I think Anders was right\nbecause I watched these\nprofessionals practice,\nlike that's what it is.\nIt's not fun.\nWell, everything we know\nabout neuroplasticity,\nwhich of course is the\nnervous system's ability\nto change in response to experience,\nsays that there needs\nto be some neurochemical\nor electrical condition that\nchanges in the nervous system\nin order to queue up plasticity.\nAnd to my knowledge, one\nof the most robust of those\nis the release of the\nso-called \"catecholamines:\"\ndopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine.\nDopamine, because it's\ninvolved in so many things,\ncan be a little bit of a distractor.\nSo let's just say\nepinephrine, norepinephrine,\nadrenaline, noradrenaline\ncreate in the body and mind,\nto some extent, a state of alertness,\nand often a state of agitation.\nBut if you think about it,\nin the absence of some\nneuromodulators like those\nthat change the conditions\nfor wiring of neurons,\nyou know, everyone loves \"Fire\ntogether, wire together,\"\na beautiful statement by\nCarla Shatz, not Donald Hebb\nDr. Carla Shatz said\nthat, not Donald Hebb,\nbut why would neurons need to change\ntheir patterns of connectivity\nif you can complete the operation?\nThe nervous system needs to,\nit doesn't feel discomfort,\nit creates discomfort, but\nthe nervous system needs a cue\nto like, \"Okay, this is\ndifferent, I'm failing.\"\nAnd it's the failures that\nactually trigger the plasticity,\nis the discomfort that cues\nthat conditions are different now.\nOtherwise, there's simply no reason\nto devote energetic resources\nto rewiring neurons.\nAnd I feel like we don't\nlearn this when we're kids.\nAnd I think as kids,\nwe can learn so much without\nthat feeling of agitation.\nWe get into these modes\nof looking for flow.\nAnd I have respect for\nthe research on flow\nand the people who are involved in it,\nbut I'd like to talk\nabout flow a little bit.\nThe only thing I really\nknow about flow for sure\nis that backwards, it spells wolf.\nSo, what of flow?\n[Cal chuckling]\nIt's such an attractive idea, right?\nIt's like \"Star Wars.\" It's\nlike you have the force.\n[Andrew imitating buzzing]\nAnd you're doing things without thinking,\nand awesome, but I can't\nflow myself through a paper\nand extract the critical data.\nI can't create a podcast in flow.\nBut when it's done, it feels great.\nEspecially if you nail the key metrics.\nSo, what do you think about flow?\nI'm not trying to beat up on it,\nI just want to understand how you place it\nin the framework of\nlearning and deep work,\nif it belongs there at all.\nIt doesn't have a big place in it,\nin the deep work framework.\nAnd this was what the\ncontroversy was for a while.\nAnd I knew Mihaly a little\nbit, like we corresponded some.\nAnd I knew Anders a little\nbit, like we corresponded some.\nSo I sort of felt like I was, you know,\nand both of them actually\ntragically have died\nin the last three or four years, I think.\nOh, that's very sad.\nYeah, I think both recently.\nFlow doesn't play a big role\nin the deep work framework, right?\nSo when I was trying to justify deep work,\nso like, why focusing without\ndistraction was important,\nI was drawing a lot more\nfor Anders' work, right?\nBecause why is focusing\nwithout distraction important?\nWell, you have to quiet\nthe neural circuitry\nso you can isolate the circuit\nthat's actually relevant\nto the thing that you're doing, right?\nYou're not going to\nget better at something\nif you have noisy circuitry.\nAnd that requires really\nintense concentration.\nSo it was one of the big\nadvantages of deep work,\nwas if you're used to\nthat cognitive state,\nyou're going to learn things faster.\nAnd I think it was all\nAnders to understand why.\nSo if you're not distracted,\nI'm really focusing hard\non what I'm doing trying\nto learn this new thing,\nyou're giving the right mental conditions,\nbut it's not a flow state.\nAnd I always used to say,\n\"Okay, when your deep work is not flow,\"\nbecause of this, like a lot of deep work\nis you're trying to do something\nthat is beyond your comfort zone.\nAnd that's going to be difficult.\nThat's a state of deliberate practice.\nAnd there's a famous paper about this\nwhere Anders actually explicitly says\ndeliberate practice and\nflow are very different.\nAnd I wrote an essay years ago called\n\"The Father of Deliberate\nPractice Disowns Flow.\"\nAnd again, people are really\nflow partisans out there.\nIt's interesting.\nI think people just like the\nidea 'cause it feels good,\nbut I mean, flow is the\nfeeling of performance,\nis the way I think about it.\nLike, it's really hard to\ntrain for certain sports,\nbut then when you're actually performing,\nyou're in the game, you can\nfall in the flow, right?\nBecause then everything is I'm doing...\nAnd it's really hard to train guitar.\nBut like, when you're performing\nin front of a big crowd,\nyou probably, maybe you fall in the flow,\nmaybe you don't, but you could, right?\nBut it's the performance state,\nnot the practicing getting better state.\nSo, you know, to me flow\nhas like very little role\nin how I think about what I do\nas a cognitive professional.\nIt's just not something\nthat comes up that often.\nI agree that we learn through focused work\nand that flow does manifest\nitself during performance.\nAnd sometimes so much so that\npeople exhibit virtuosity,\nso they're surprising themselves even.\nLike, \"What's in there?\"\nAnd that's kind of, I always think of,\nit's what is unskilled,\nskilled mastery virtuosity.\nVirtuosity seems to incorporate\nsome sort random elements\nof maybe even the performer\nhas not done that before\nand they surprise themselves,\nor something like that.\nYeah.\nWho knows?\nThese are words for something\nthat isn't easily quantified\nin the first place.\nThank you for tuning in\nto the Huberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat you just
