    "transcript": "- So now let's talk about\nwhat I'm calling critical period three\nof each 24-hour cycle.\nSo this would be the period\nof time of late evening,\nso it might be 6:00 PM for some,\ndepending on when you go to sleep,\nor 7:00 PM, extending into the hours\nin which you decide to get\ninto bed and go to sleep,\nand then throughout the night.\nThere are a number of things\nthat you're going to want to do,\nand there are a number of things\nthat you are going to want to avoid doing\nin order to optimize your sleep.\nFirst of all,\nyou're going to want to avoid\nbright artificial lights\nof any color.\nYes, of any color.\nWe haven't talked a lot\nabout blue blockers,\nyou know, lenses that\nblock blue wavelengths,\nor short wavelengths of light.\nI don't have anything\nagainst blue blockers.\nIn fact, many people\nfind that blue blockers\nprovide them some relief\nfrom headache and some eye strain,\nif they wear blue blockers\nthroughout the day\nand certainly at night,\nbut you don't need them.\nAnd even if you do wear them,\nyou will find that if\nlights are very bright,\ndoesn't matter if it's a blue light,\na yellow light or a red light,\nthose bright lights will\nwake up your brain and body.\nThey will activate the same mechanisms\nthat were activated early\nin the day by sunlight.\nHowever, and here's the\nreally diabolical twist.\nI mentioned this earlier,\nbut the diabolical twist\nin the way that your brain\nand body respond to light\nis that, early in the day,\nin the morning hours,\nyou need a lot of bright\nlight ideally from sunlight\nto be very alert and to wake up.\nBut in the evening hours\nand nighttime hours,\nit takes very little light,\nvery few photons\nin order to wake up your brain and body\nand to disrupt your circadian clock\nand disrupt your sleep.\nSo what that means is that\nonce the sun goes down,\nwhich, of course, is going\nto happen at different times\nof year and different places on earth,\nbut once the sun goes down,\nyou would be wise to\ntry and dim the lights\nin your indoor environment\nmost days, right?\nI realize some nights you're\ngoing to throw a party\nand have people over.\nYou might not want to dim the lights.\nSome nights you're going to go out,\nyou might view a lot of bright lights.\nBut most nights of your life,\nyou're going to want to dim the lights\nin your internal environment.\nAnd ideally the lights that you do use,\nyou would place low in\nthat physical environment.\nSo you would try and\nnot use overhead lights\nbut rather rely on desk lamps,\nor lights even placed low to the floor,\neven on the floor.\nIf you are going to use light at night,\nand most people do,\nI would encourage you to use\nas little artificial light\nas is required to carry out the activities\nyou need to require safely.\nThat could be studying,\nin which case you might\nneed a little bit more light\nin order to read or study.\nIf you're watching a television show,\nor you're watching\nsomething on your computer,\ndim that screen way, way down,\nas dim as possible,\nwhile still, of course,\nbeing able to view what you need to view.\nEven better...\nI should say, ideally,\nyou would use candlelight\nand/or moonlight.\nNow some nights the moon is really bright\nand you actually can use moonlight\nto go about your usual activities.\nMoonlight might seem very, very bright,\nbut actually moonlight is\nfairly low light intensity,\nand candlelight, which\ncan also seem very bright,\nactually is very low light intensity.\nIf you're sitting across a table\nwith some candlelight there,\nand it's a really bright candle,\nchances are it's only\nabout three to 10 lux,\nwhich is very, very little light energy\ncompared to, say, an artificial desk lamp\nor an overhead light,\nwhich is going to be\nin the area of anywhere\nfrom 100 to 1000 lux.\nSo candlelight is fine.\nOf course, be cautious with open flame,\nbut candlelight is fine,\nmoonlight is fine,\ndimming artificial lights is fine,\nprovided their dimmed way, way down.\nAnd again, try and avoid using\noverhead artificial lights.\nThe absolute worst lights\nare going to be overhead\nfluorescent lights of the sort\nthat you would have in the supermarket,\nor that you would see at a gas station,\nor something of that sort.\nAnd I confess there\nare times in which I'm,\nyou know, driving home,\nand it's late at night,\nand I want to be able to get to sleep,\nand I'll need to stop\nat the grocery store,\nor a gas station,\nor something like that.\nI've actually put on sunglasses at night\nin order to avoid getting\nthat bright light exposure\nat night, although that's\na little bit extreme.\nI have done that from time to time,\nbecause that bright light exposure\nwill absolutely quash,\nit will eliminate any melatonin\nthat happens to be circulating\nin your brain and body.\nNow, melatonin, a lot of people\nthink of as a supplement,\nbut melatonin is naturally released\nas the evening comes about,\nand into the nighttime hours.\nIt's a hormone that makes you feel sleepy\nand allows you to fall asleep.\nSo viewing bright light\nin the late evening hours\nand nighttime hours is really not good\nfor your sleep quality\nand your ability to fall and stay asleep.\nSo for most people,\na simple rule of thumb\nis going to be avoid\nbright artificial lights\nof all colors,\nand in particular, overhead\nbright artificial lights,\nbetween the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM.\nThat's right, between\n10:00 PM and 4:00 AM,\navoid those bright artificial lights\nas much as possible.\nUse only as much light\nas absolutely necessary\nin order to carry out the routines\nand activities you need\nto carry out safely.\nI should mention that the reason\noverhead lights are problematic\nis the same reason why sunlight\nis so great early in the day,\nwhich is that the cells,\nthat is the neurons,\nthat can wake up your brain\nand body through activation\nof the circadian clock,\nreside mainly in the bottom half\nor two-thirds of your neural retina,\nand the way the optics of your eyes work\nis that the cells on the\nbottom half of your eye\nview the upper visual field.\nSo this is a beautiful adaptive mechanism\nthat allows these cells\nto respond to overhead light from sunlight\nin the early part of the day\nand throughout the day.\nBut in the evening,\nif you have bright artificial lights on,\nand those bright artificial\nlights are overhead lights,\nit's going to more closely mimic\nwhat sunlight does in the evening time.\nAnd that turns out to be a bad thing\nif your goal is to eventually go to sleep.\nSo again, do like the Scandinavians do,\nuse lights that are set\nlow in the room at night.\nAnd if you really wanted to\noptimize your sleep-wake cycles,\nI suppose you could also do the\nopposite throughout the day.\nYou could really emphasize the use\nof bright artificial lights\nand sunlight that comes from above.\nAnd of course, sunlight\nalways comes from above.\nBut if you're working in a given,\nyou know, office environment,\nand, you know, it's 2:00 PM or 3:00 PM,\nand you want to be as awake as possible,\nreally crank up the overhead lights.\nAnd then in the evening,\nwhich is this critical period three\nthat we're referring to,\nreally try and dim those lights,\nor have them off,\nor just rely on candlelight or moonlight\nfrom the hours of about\n10:00 PM until 4:00 AM.\nOur good friend, Samer Hattar,\nwho's been on this podcast before,\nSamer is Director of\nthe Chronobiology Unit\nat the National Institute\nof Mental Health.\nWell, he's absolutely obsessive\nabout this light stuff\nand avoiding light at night.\nIn fact, he lives in what I sort of joke,\nit's like a cave at night\nfrom 9:00 PM until 5:00 AM,\nwhich is really his kind of sleep cycle,\nhe has his house so dark\nthat you'd be lucky to\nbe able to find a spoon\nin the kitchen.\nIn fact, you'd be lucky to find your way\ndown the hallway, if you're me.\nBut in any case, dim the lights.\nTurn them way, way down.\nIt will serve you well.\nIt will make it much easier for you\nto get sleepy and stay sleepy,\nand fall asleep,\nand stay asleep throughout the night.\n[upbeat music]"
