    "transcript": "- I wake up in the morning\nand I want to reach for my phone,\nbut I know that even\nif I were to crank up the brightness\non that phone screen,\nit's not bright enough\nto trigger that cortisol spike,\nand for me to be at my most alert\nand focused throughout the day\nand to optimize my sleep at night.\nSo what I do is I get out of bed\nand I go outside,\nand if it's a bright, clear day,\nand the sun is low in the sky,\nor the sun is starting to get overhead,\nwhat we call low solar angle,\nthen I know I'm getting\noutside at the right time.\nIf there's cloud cover\nand I can't see the sun,\nI also know I'm doing a good thing\nbecause it turns out\nespecially on cloudy days,\nyou want to get outside\nand get as much light energy\nor photons in your eyes.\nBut let's say it's a very clear day\nand I can see where the sun is,\nI do not need to stare\ndirectly into the sun.\nIf it's very low in the sky,\nI might do that\nbecause it's not going to be\nvery painful to my eyes.\nHowever, if the sun is\na little bit brighter\nand a little bit higher in the sky,\nsometimes it could be painful to look at.\nSo the way to get this sunlight viewing\nearly in the day\nis to look toward the sun.\nIf it's too bright to look at directly,\nwell then don't do that.\nYou just look toward it,\nbut not directly at it.\nIt's absolutely fine to blink.\nIn fact, I encourage you to blink\nwhenever you feel the impulse to blink.\nNever look at any light,\nsunlight or otherwise\nthat's so bright that\nit's painful to look at\n'cause you can damage your eyes.\nBut for this morning sunlight viewing,\nit's best to not wear sunglasses.\nThat's right, to not wear sunglasses\nat least for this\nmorning sunlight viewing.\nIt is absolutely fine\nto wear eyeglasses or contact lenses,\nso-called corrective lenses.\nIn fact, those will serve you well\nin this practice or this tool\nbecause they will focus the light\nonto your neural retina and onto those\nmelanopsin intrinsically\nphotosensitive ganglion cells.\nIf your eyeglasses or contact lenses\nhave UV protection, that's okay.\nThere's so many different\nwavelengths of light\ncoming from the sun\nand they are bright enough\nthat they will trigger the mechanisms\nthat you want triggered\nat this early time of day.\nSo try and get outside,\nideally within the first five minutes\nof waking or maybe it's 15 minutes,\nbut certainly within the\nfirst hour after waking.\nI want to share with you\nthree critical things\nabout this tool of\nmorning sunlight viewing.\nFirst of all, this is not\nsome woo biology thing.\nThis is grounded in the\ncore of our physiology.\nThere are literally hundreds,\nif not thousands of quality\npeer reviewed papers\nshowing that light\nviewing early in the day\nis the most powerful stimulus\nfor wakefulness throughout the day\nand it has a powerful, positive impact\non your ability to fall\nand stay asleep at night.\nSo this is really the\nfoundational power tool\nfor ensuring a great night's sleep\nand for feeling more awake during the day.\nSecond of all, if you wake up\nbefore the sun is out,\nyou can and probably should\nflip on artificial lights\nin your internal home environment\nor apartment or wherever\nyou happen to live,\nif your goal is to be awake, right?\nIf you wake up at four\nin the morning and you need to be awake,\nwell then turn on artificial lights.\nOnce the sun is out however,\nonce the sun has risen,\nthen you still want to get\noutside and view sunlight.\nSome of you will wake up\nbefore the sun comes out.\nAnd if you're asking whether or not\nturning on artificial lights\ncan replace sunlight at those hours,\nunfortunately the answer is no.\nUnless you have a very special light,\nwe'll talk about what kind of light,\nthe bright artificial lights\nin your home environment are not,\nI repeat, are not going\nto be sufficiently bright\nto turn on the cortisol mechanism\nand the other wake up mechanisms\nthat you need early in the day.\nThe diabolical twist however\nis that those lights in\nyour home or apartment,\nor even on your phone\nare bright enough to disrupt your sleep\nif you look at them too late at night\nor in the middle of the night.\nSo there's this asymmetry in our retinal,\nour eye biology and in our brain's biology\nwhereby early in the day,\nright around waking,\nyou need a lot of light,\na lot of photons,\na lot of light energy\nand artificial lights\ngenerally just won't accomplish\nwhat you need them to accomplish.\nBut at night, even a little bit\nof artificial light can really mess up\nyour so-called circadian,\nyour 24-hour clocks\nand all these mechanisms\nthat we're talking about.\nSo if you wake up before the sun is out\nand it's still dark,\nplease turn on as many\nbright artificial lights\nas you possibly can or need,\nbut then get outside\nonce the sun is out.\nOn cloudy days, you especially\nneed to get outside.\nI repeat, on cloudy days, overcast days,\nyou especially need to get\noutside and get sunlight.\nYou just need to get more of it.\nNow, how much light\nand how much light viewing do you need?\nThis is going to vary depending\non person and place,\nliterally where you live on earth,\nwhether or not there's\na lot of tree cover,\nwhether or not you're somebody\nwho has sensitive eyes\nor less sensitive eyes.\nIt's really impossible for me to give\nan absolute prescriptive,\nbut we can give some general guidelines.\nIn general, on a clear day,\nmeaning no cloud cover\nor minimal cloud cover,\nyou want to get this sunlight exposure\nto your eyes for about five minutes or so,\ncould be three minutes one day,\nit could be seven minutes the next day,\nabout five minutes.\nOn a day where there's cloud cover,\nso the sun is just\npeeking through the clouds\nor it's more dense cloud cover,\nyou want to get about 10 minutes\nof sunlight exposure to\nyour eyes early in the day.\nAnd on days that are\nreally densely overcast\nor maybe even are rainy,\nyou're going to want to get as much\nas 20 or 30 minutes of sunlight exposure.\nAnother key thing is,\ndo not forget about just don't try\nand get this sunlight exposure\nthrough a windshield of a car or a window,\nwhether or not it's tinted or otherwise.\nIt takes far too long.\nIt's simply not going to trigger\nthe relevant mechanisms,\nyou would be standing there all day\ntrying to get enough light\ninto your eyes from the morning sunlight.\nAnd by then, the sun\nwill have already moved\nfrom low solar angle to overhead\nand it simply won't work for all sorts\nof mechanisms related to\nyour circadian rhythm functions.\nSo just don't try and do it\nthrough a windshield,\nsunglasses or a window.\nIt's just not going to work.\nGet outside.\nIf the weather is really bad\nor for whatever reason, safety reasons,\nyou cannot get outside,\nwell then I suppose, try\nand get near a window.\nThat would be the last, last resort,\nbut you really want to get outside\nto get the sunlight exposure.\n[upbeat music]"
