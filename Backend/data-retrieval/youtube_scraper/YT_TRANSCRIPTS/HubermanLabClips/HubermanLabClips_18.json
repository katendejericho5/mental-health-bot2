    "transcript": "I have a shutdown ritual,\nwhich clearly demarcates the end of work\nand the start of the night after work.\nAnd the shutdown ritual,\nso it has to, you have to\nclose open loops, right?\nSo, you got to make sure this\nis like a review type period.\nLet me look back at my\ninbox and look at my plan.\nLet me look at my, you know,\nmy time block and my calendar.\nReally make sure there's nothing urgent\nthat needs to be dealt with that I didn't,\nand there's nothing that's just in my head\nthat I don't want to forget.\nIt's not written down somewhere.\nLike take care of all of that, right?\nSo, you review all these things,\nwhat am I going to do tomorrow?\nYou don't have to build your\nwhole plan for tomorrow,\nbut you have a sense for it.\nAnd then you need some sort\nof demonstrative thing you do\nto indicate that you\nfinished the routine, right?\nSo, my longtime newsletter readers know\nI used to actually have a phrase.\nI would say, \"Schedule\nshut down complete\",\nlike a crazy phrase, right?\nIt's not how normal people talk, right?\nNow, I have a planner that\nhas like a checkbox that says,\nshut down complete next to it.\nThe reason why that is\na demonstrative anchor\nis that you use this then for\ncognitive behavioral therapy,\n'cause at first people have a\nhard time shutting down work.\nI mean, I invented this,\n'cause I had a very\nhard time shutting down,\nworking on my dissertation.\nWhat if this proof doesn't\nwork and blah, blah, blah.\nSo, what you do is when you\nget a rumination post shutdown.\nHey, what about what's\ngoing on with our work?\nAre we doing the right thing?\nDo we forget this or that?\nInstead of engaging in the rumination.\nWell, it's like, no, I think we're okay.\nLet me think about my schedule tomorrow.\nWhat's my plan?\nYou instead can just say,\nI said that crazy phrase,\nor I checked that box.\nI wouldn't have said that phrase\nunless I had gone through everything\nand made sure that I had a good plan\nand nothing's being missed,\nand it was okay to shut down work.\nBecause of that, I'm not going\nto engage with you rumination.\nI said the weird thing, let's\nget back to what we're doing.\nThis is like cognitive behavioral therapy\nthat after a month or so,\nyou were really able to,\nactually effortlessly disengage from work\nand do everything, you know,\nall the other stuff that matters, right?\nWithout having the constant\nruminations about work,\nwhich gives your mind an actual break\nto, you know, do other things.\nSo, I mean, this is more mental\nhealth than productivity,\nbut for me it was critical.\nI mean, I can really remember\nwhen I came up with this,\nyou know, exactly where I was\nin my grad student career,\nand it was just too much,\ntoo many ideas and concerns\nthat were just roiling.\nAnd like, once I did this,\nyou know, it took a few weeks\nand then I could actually like shut down\nand go on and do other things.\nYeah, the paired associative\nnature of the brain\ncan make it really problematic,\nif you're thinking about\nwork at the dinner table.\nYou start to associate the\ndinner table with work.\nI mean, when Matt Walker came here\nto do this six-part series\nthat's soon to be released,\nand we were discussing insomnia, he said,\n\"You know, one of the\nmajor issues with insomnia\nis people who have trouble\nfalling asleep or staying asleep\nwill often stay in bed\nwhen they can't sleep.\nAnd then the bed becomes associated\nwith challenges with sleep.\"\nThat, you know, hence the recommendation\nthat virtually every sleep\ncoach and sleep scientists\nrecommends that people actually,\nif they can't sleep for 20\nminutes or so of effort,\nthen you get up and leave the bed\nand go someplace else until\nyou feel sleepy enough\nto go back and try or fall\nasleep on the couch elsewhere.\nI put that in\nas a note to you.\nAdd to the list, yeah.\nBut this seems incredibly important\nalso for enrichment of relationships\nwith spouses and children\nand people in your life.\nI mean, the problem is the first thing\nthat we ask people when they\nwalk in the door typically,\nwas how was work today?\nYeah.\nHow was work?\nWhat'd you do today?\nYeah.\nTell me about your school day.\nTell me about your work.\nMaybe we need to come up\nwith better questions.\nYeah, like here's something\ninteresting we could do.\nOr here's like something I\nread about unrelated to work.\nYeah. No, I think it\nmakes a huge difference.\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat you just viewed,\nplease check out the full-length\nepisode by clicking here."
