    "transcript": "- What's the link between\nvision and motivation\nand how can we leverage that\nin order to better reach our goals?\n- Totally.\nSo, you know, we started thinking\nabout what are the goals that\nare most important to people\nthat they struggle with the most.\nSo we asked hundreds, thousands of people\nwhat their new year's resolutions are.\nWe look to all the other polls\nthat do the same kind of work.\nAnd regardless of where\nyou look or who you ask\nor when you ask it\npeople's number one goal\nis something related to their health,\nto lose weight, to\nexercise more, to get out,\nget more steps for mental\nwellbeing, physical wellbeing.\nAnd that's like the number\none goal every January 1st.\nSo if we were able to accomplish that goal\nyou think it would drop a\nlittle bit in the rankings\nbut it doesn't because it's really hard.\nSo we thought, I wonder\nif there's a way for us\nto make some progress on\nthat on helping people\nto exercise better, more\noften, stick to it longer\nand make some progress there.\nWe know diets don't work.\nAnd why don't diets\nwork for the same reason\nthat that self-talk doesn't work\nis that we go in it full bore, hardcore\nand it requires a major\ncommitment and effort\nto a lifestyle change.\nSo again, we were looking for\nsomething that might be easier\nthan that, that could\nproduce big payoff, right?\nThat's the golden ticket.\nSomething that requires less\neffort for a bigger payoff.\nSo one of the first things that I did\nwas go over to Brooklyn, to\nthis old armory building,\nit used to be a military armory space.\n- Yeah I think I know that building.\nIt's a beautiful building now\nthat houses a lot of businesses, right.\nWith plants on the walls is that the one?\n- Yeah there's businesses.\nThere's a couple armories\nall around the boroughs here\naround New York City and the\none in Brooklyn in particular\nis now YMCA, so it's a family, YMCA\nthat's within this beautiful\nold red brick building\nthat used to be a military\nestablishment long, long ago.\nAnd what's really cool is\nthat one winter afternoon,\nsomebody had invited\nme a physical therapist\nsaid, hey, you should come out\nand check out what's happening here\nwith your interest in exercise\nand trying to find new ways\nof helping people, new\ntactics that they can add\nto their tool belt.\nI think you're going to\nfind some interesting people\nthat are working out there.\nSo, I showed up.\nI look around, there's\nfamilies, there's new moms\nthere's kids that are,\nmoms trying to get kids\nto burn off some winter\nenergy that they have.\nThere's people that look\nlike they're just there\nfor their, every couple of\ndays going out for a run.\nThere's some people that look\nlike they're training with a team.\nAnd that's who this physical\ntherapist introduced me to\nwas the coach of this team.\nThere's a bunch of people\nthat were sitting down on the ground.\nAnd I would be hard pressed to know\nwho's the high school\nstudent that's in this group.\nAnd then who, as it turns out\nare some of the fastest\nrunners in the world.\nLike one of the people that\nwas in the last Olympics\nbefore I showed up one the\ngold medal for the 400 meter\nand from the looks of them, I\nmean, of course their bodies\nare in better shape than mine,\nbut there's nothing so pretentious,\nof course, they're not\nwearing their medals.\nThere's nothing pretentious\nabout how they're walking around\nor anything like that.\nThat would lead me to know,\nlike this person's amazing.\nAnd they probably have some\ninsight that I don't have.\nSo once I got introduced to them\nI knew who are these people that were part\nof this pretty elite training team\nthat happened to work\nout at this family gym,\nI had the chance to talk with\nthem about what strategies\ndo you use?\nNow I am not an elite runner.\nAnd having recently had a baby\nI'm not really a runner right now at all.\nBut I thought when\nthese people are running\nI bet they are like hyper aware\nof everything that's going\non in their surroundings.\nWhere are they relative\nto the competition,\nwhat's happening in\ntheir peripheral vision?\nWhat's going on on the\nside, who's behind them.\nWho's in front of them.\nThey probably have this like master sense\nthis master visual plan\nat any point in time.\nAnd that's what probably makes them elite.\nSo when I started asking\nthem, is that the case?\nDo you really pay attention to\nwhat's in your surroundings?\nWhat's behind you, what's on the side.\nThey said, no, like all of them said no.\nAnd sometimes when I do\ndo that, it's a mistake.\nIt doesn't work for me.\nSo that was surprising.\nIt totally went against my intuition\nabout what they do that likely\ncontributes to their success.\nWhat they said instead was\nthat they are hyper focused.\nThey assume this narrowed\nfocus of attention\nalmost like a spotlight\nis shining on a target.\nNow, when they're running a short distance\nat target might literally\nbe the finish line\nthe line that they're trying to cross.\nIf it's a longer distance,\nthey set sub goals.\nLike the person, the shorts\non the person up ahead\nthat they're trying to beat\nor they choose some sort of\nstable landmark like a sign\nthat they would pass by.\nAnd a spotlight is shining just on that.\nOr they have blinders on\nthe sides of their face.\nThat's all they're paying attention to.\nIt's really narrowed scope of attention.\nAnd that was a strategy that\nall of these elite athletes\nsaid that they used.\nAnd those that were\nbetter rather than slower\nwere ones that used it more.\nAnd I thought, oh, that's\nsomething we can play with.\nThey are elite and they're accomplished\nbut that visual strategy\nisn't necessarily something\nthat you have to be in the\nperfect physical condition\nto be able to adopt.\nAnd so I wondered, can\nthat help the rest of us\nwho aren't competing for an Olympic gold\nand who have no chance of ever getting one\nbut who want to exercise better,\nhave a better time doing it\nand maintain a commitment\nto that exercise goal that they might have\nthat they might otherwise,\nby February or March\nbe giving up on if they had said it\nat the beginning of January.\nSo that's really where the work started\nwas what you might call like\nfocus groups or case studies\nof these incredible athletes.\nAnd then we did other\nstudies looking at people\nwho aren't Olympic athletes\nbut who are competitive\nand New York road runners, runners\nand how are they running in races?\nAnd what we found is that those\npeople who have better pace\nfaster pace, better time\nthey use that narrowed strategy more often\nthan this more expansive\nor open scope of attention.\nAnd there seemed to be a\ncorrelation between that,\nbetter performance among a wider swath\nof hundreds of runners who\nare doing it competitively,\nbut still could be like the person\nthat you're sitting next to\nin the office or yourself.\nAnd the more often that they did it,\nand the more consistently\nthey had adopted that,\nthat technique of the\nnarrowed focus of attention\nit seemed that they were\ndoing better in their runs.\nSo then we started thinking like, okay\nwhat about people who\naren't competitive runners?\nWhat about my mom, can she do that or me\nwhen I'm trying to get\nback on the bandwagon\nand exercise more?\nIs this a tactic we can teach people?\nThe answer is, yes.\nYou can tell people about\nwhat these Olympic athletes\nare doing.\nYou can tell them about what\nthe New York road runners,\nrunners are doing and just\nusing the same language\nthat I just use with you.\nImagine that there's a spotlight\nshining just on a target,\nchoose something up ahead,\nthe stop sign, two blocks\nup that you can just see\nand imagine that you have blinders on\nso that you're not really paying attention\nto the people that are\npassing by or the buildings\nor the garbage cans or the\ntrucks that are on the road,\ntune those out and focus in on that target\nuntil you hit it and\nthen choose another one,\nrecalibrate choose the next goal.\nAnd so we would test\nlike, can people do that?\nI mean, if you're listening right now\nyou probably are imagining\nthat experience too.\nAnd the answer is yes.\nLike I can imagine that I\nknow what those words mean,\nand I can do that.\nAnd our work found that\ntoo, if people can do that\nwe have them say out loud,\nwhat is it that's captured your attention.\nAnd of course, sometimes\nsomething in the periphery\nlike movement captures our\ngaze and we are pulled there\nfor an instant but then\nwe can refocus up again\nand adopt that narrowed attention.\nNow, one of the first studies that we did\nwas teach that strategy and\njuxtapose, or compare it\nagainst a group that we said,\njust look around naturally.\nYou know, you might see\nthat finish line up ahead\nand there's things on the periphery,\nwhatever your eyes want to do,\nwhatever you think is going to\nwork best, feel free to do that.\nAnd tell us what you're looking at.\nThen we gave them a finish line.\nWe created an exercise that's\nmoderately challenging,\nbut possible.\nWe put ankle weights on\nthat accounted for about 15%\nof their body weight, told\nthem to lift their knees up\nhigh stepping to a finish line.\nSo this would be\nchallenging for them to do.\nBut we said it's an indicator\nof overall health and fitness.\nSome of these people had\nnarrowed their focus of attention\nand some were just looking\nmore expansively or naturally.\nAnd what we found is that those people\nthat we trained just\neveryday normal people\ndoing this moderately challenging exercise\nthey were able to move 27% faster.\nThey could do the exercise more quickly\nand they set it hurt 17% less.\nThe exercise was exactly\nthe same for all the people,\nwe set the weight and we set the distance.\nIt was in our lab space.\nSo it was a constrained environment.\nEverybody was in the\nsame sort of circumstance\nbut yet their experience\nwas really different.\nWe helped them to move faster,\nburn calories at a higher rate,\nexercise more efficiently.\nThe amount of time they put in\nis going to produce a\nbetter physical outcome.\nAnd it also, it didn't hurt them.\nThey're saying it doesn't hurt as much.\nSo we were really excited about that,\nbecause it meant that this strategy\nwe could use it on people\nwho are not elite athletes.\nIt could be easily adopted\na quick training session,\ncan teach people to look at\nthe world in a different way.\nAgain, this narrowed\nattention was different\nthan whatever they do\nnaturally the comparison group\nbut it had a big outcome.\nIt had a big difference on the way\nthat they were engaged in the exercise.\nThat was like some of the\nfirst work that we did.\nAnd then since then we've done,\nI don't know dozens\nmore studies to look at\nwell, what happens with that?\nAnd what else can we do with\nplaying around with this?\n- Yeah those are impressive differences.\nAs a consequence of\nnarrowing visual attention.\nCouple questions about the actual practice\nof narrowing attention.\nIs there any indication\nof whether or not subjects\nare constantly updating\ntheir visual attention?\nSo for instance, if let's\nsay the goal line is in view\nliterally from the beginning.\nI could imagine just\nholding visual attention\non the goal line, but if it's a oval track\nor it's a trajectory along\na trail through a city\nhow often do you think they are updating\ntheir visual aperture and\nsetting a visual goal?\nAnd I could imagine that\nthere's some energetic expense\nto that.\nSo that meaning how,\nyou wouldn't want to do\nevery crack on the sidewalk\nunless those cracks on the\nsidewalk were very far apart.\nBecause I think at some point that itself\nwould be exhausting.\nSo is there an optimal strategy\nor a semi optimal strategy?\n- Yeah so, those Olympic athletes\nthat we started by interviewing\nthey tended to be sprinters.\nThey were more often sprinters\nshort distance sprinters.\nSo when they said like, yes, I narrow in\nmore than I assume an expansive focus\nthat's because they're not going that far.\nThey have to do it as\nfast as humanly possible\nbut they're not going that far.\nAnd so we started asking that question too\nabout like, well, wouldn't that be tiring?\nAnd the answer is yes.\nSo when we start to look at people\nwho aren't sprinters, who are accomplished\nbut who are more long distance runners,\nthat's what we find that\nthey do is that they,\nthey're using that narrowed\nattention strategy strategically\nand it increases in use.\nThey use it more often\nas the race progresses\nand they really start\nto do this major switch\nabout the halfway point of\nsay, like a 10 kilometer run.\nSo people who are seasoned runners\nthey really start making a switch\nwith what they're looking\nat about halfway through.\nAnd that's where they\nmore often more frequently\nand are more intentionally adopting\na narrowed focus of attention.\nWhen they're in the last\ncouple miles of a run\nwhen maybe their resources\nare starting to get more thin\nmaybe they're motivation\nis starting to fade.\nThat tipping point in the middle\nis with any kind of goal where\npeople struggle the most.\nAnd that's when they're like\ndoubling down on a strategy\nthat they know to be effective.\nSo at first longer distance runners\nare not using that narrowed strategy.\nThey're looking more expansively\nbecause I think that,\nwell, first of all distraction\nis a thing it's useful.\nNot necessarily that they're\ndistracting themselves\nbecause people are still\ntrying to hold pace\nand jostle among probably\na more concentrated group\nof runners but it is a\nstrategy that they use\nand then sort of wean off\nof as the race goes through.\nAnd it's particularly effective\nwhen we're looking for that\nlast push, the last push\nto get over the finish\nline when you might be\nliterally neck and neck with somebody\nthat you're trying to just beat out\nor when you're most tired.\nBut you know that last push,\nyou don't want to drop off.\nAnd you want to push through\nhard through that finish line.\nThat's when people are using it\nat its peak level of intensity.\n[upbeat music]"
