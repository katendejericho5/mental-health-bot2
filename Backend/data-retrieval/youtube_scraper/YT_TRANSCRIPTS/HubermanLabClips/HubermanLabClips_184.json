    "transcript": "- If the goal is to challenge muscles\nand one is dividing their body into,\nlet's say, a three- or\nfour-day-a-week split or so,\nor maybe up to six,\nhow do you know when a muscle is ready\nto be challenged again?\nI've heard, okay, every 48 hours is,\nprotein synthesis increases,\nand then we'll get into this,\nand then it drops off.\nBut frankly, if I train my legs hard,\nI can get stronger from\nworkout to workout,\nor at least better, in some way,\nworkout to workout, leg\nworkout to leg workout,\ntraining them once every\nfive to eight days.\nIf I train them more often, I get worse.\nSo whatever that 48-hour\nto 72-hour thing is,\nsomehow my legs don't obey that,\nbut, or maybe something\nelse is wrong with me,\nbut I'm sure there are many\nthings else wrong with me.\nBut how do you assess\nrecovery at the local level,\nmeaning at the level of the muscles,\nso we'll talk about soreness\nand getting better,\nstronger, more repetitions,\net cetera, and then at the systemic level,\nthe level of the nervous system,\nand I'd love for you to tell us\nabout the tool that,\nagain, I learned from you,\nwhich is actually using a physical scale,\nbecause it turns out, this is that,\nwill let you tell what the tool is,\nbut that tool is also actively being used\nfor assessing cognitive decline\nand cognitive maintenance\nand cognitive function\nin people with Alzheimer's and dementia.\n- Interesting.\nIt makes total sense, make total sense.\nI, all right, so\nregarding the first part of the question,\nhow do you, how would you kind of dictate\nwhen a muscle's recovered?\nSo I do think that what you're\nexperiencing is totally real,\nthat different muscles\nrecover at different rates,\nand I've always been so\nfascinated by this concept,\nI've talked about internally with my team,\nbut I feel like what we really need,\nthe Holy Grail to training, is going to be\nwhen we're able to crack the code,\non an individual basis,\nwhen a muscle is recovered,\nand that is going to dictate\nits training schedule.\nAnd the fact that you might have a bicep\nthat could be trained\nvia a pulling workout,\na regular bicep-dedicated workout,\nforget the split at the moment.\nYou might have a bicep\nthat's able to be trained\nthat can be trained again the next day,\nand then the next day, and then,\nmaybe you need a day off after that.\nAnd that can vary from\nperson to person, for sure,\nand it can vary from muscle to muscle\nin that person over the course\nof time, as you mentioned,\n'cause the systemic\nrecovery's going to impact\nall those muscles anyway.\nBut let's say you're\nsystemically recovering.\nEvery muscle, itself, is\ngoing to have a recovery rate,\nand I think what's fascinating is that,\nwhen you talked about, before,\nwe like to train this week,\nor we have a, like the way\nour mind looks at training,\nwell, if that was the\ncase with the biceps,\nthat bicep is a slave to the\nrest of your training split,\nwhere it's like, well, why does it have\nto be also at the end of every eighth day,\nor whatever, when it might respond better\nto something much more frequently?\nAnd your legs are also\nbeing thrown into that mix.\nThere's a Mike Mentzer concept,\nwhere he's training one set,\nand be done for 14 days.\nI mean there's such variability\nbetween muscle groups,\nand you're linking them all together.\nI think that coming back\nand using muscle soreness\nas a guideline for that is one of the\nonly tools we have, in\nterms of the local level.\nWe don't really have\nbeing able to measure,\nlet's say, CPK levels inside\nof a muscle would be amazing,\nat a local level, to see how recovered\nthat muscle is, but that\nbecomes fairly invasive,\nat least to my knowledge,\nit becomes fairly invasive.\nSo what are our tools?\nI mean I think that, at the basic level,\nthat's the one that most\npeople can relate to\nand easily identify, and then use that\nas a guideline, and if you're training\nwhen you're really sore, it's\nprobably not a great idea\nand it's probably a good indication\nthat that muscle's probably not recovered.\nBut at least hearing what you\nand I are saying here might be a comfort\nto the person to say, yeah, it is possible\nthat it's not recovered.\nJust because 48 hours\nis the recommendation,\nand just because research points\nto muscle protein synthesis\nneeding a re-stimulation,\nwell, maybe not.\nMaybe you're not necessarily there yet,\nand for that muscle, you're not there yet.\nSo it's all really interesting stuff.\nBut as far as the systemic recovery,\nI think there's a lot of ways.\nPeople have talked about\nresting heart rate measured\nin the morning, all different kinds of,\ncore temperature and things like that,\nthat might become altered\nin a state of non-recovery.\nBut grip strength is very, very much tied\nto performance and recovery,\nand when I was with the Mets,\nwe used to actually take\ngrip strength measurements\nas a baseline in spring\ntraining all the time.\nNow, obviously, as a baseball player,\nyou're gripping a bat,\nyou're a pitcher, you're gripping a ball.\nHaving good grip strength is important,\nand so if we've noticed that we had a\nvery weak grip, it's\njust a good focal point\nof a specialized training\ncomponent for their program.\n- But did you do this\nevery day with those guys?\n- No, we would do, in spring training,\nwe'd do sort of a baseline,\nentry-level measurement,\nand then we would measure\nit throughout the season,\nmaybe once every two weeks or three weeks,\nand the idea there was\nto manage the recover,\nor measure the recovery.\nBut I just gave it away.\nTo determine overall recovery,\nyour grip strength is\npretty highly correlated.\nSo we have found that,\nwith one of those scales,\nthose old-fashioned bathroom scales\nat Bed Bath & Beyond or whatever,\nyou can get, which, by the\nway, almost impossible.\nI believe Jesse and I were searching\nfor the last scale to put in that video,\nand we almost couldn't find one,\n'cause everything is digital\nand everything, you know.\nIt's like this, I'm looking\nat the old-fashioned dial controls.\n- It's like old Macintosh computers.\nThere's a huge market\nfor them, and old phones.\nKids, keep your phones now.\nIn 30 years the lame phone now\nwill be worth a lot of money.\n- Will be worth a lot.\nSo I wound up finding one,\nand it's a great tool for\njust squeezing the scale\nwith your hands and seeing\nwhat type of output you could get.\nAnd I think we all can relate to this,\nwhen you just visualize.\nImagine the last time you were sick,\nor just try this the next time\nyou wake up in the morning.\nWhen you first wake up in the morning,\nyou're still groggy, try\nto squeeze your hand.\nTry to make a fist as hard as you can.\nYou're going to sit\nthere, angry at your fist,\nbecause it won't contract\nas hard as you know it can.\nYou don't have the ability\nto just create the output,\nand that is because, in that state,\nyou're still sleepy.\nYou're still fatigued.\nYou're not even awake the\nwhole level at this point.\nWell, that is still an\nactual phenomena that happens,\nthat a lack of recovery\nor a lack of wakefulness,\nor whatever you want to say,\nis going to lead to a\ndecreased output there.\nSo when you start to measure\nthat on a daily basis,\nyou can get a pretty good\nsense of where you're at,\nand I think when people\nstart to see a drop-off\nof 10% or so, or even\ngreater, of their grip output,\nyou really should skip the gym that day,\nbecause I don't think there's much\nyou're going to do there that's\ngoing to be that beneficial,\neven if it is the day to train\nlegs, or whatever day it is.\n- I love this tool.\nIt's simple, it's low-cost,\nif you can find such a scale.\nI guess you could also find one of\nthose grippers that, and you could do\nthis in a very non-quantitative way,\nbut better would be a scale,\nwhere you could actually measure\nhow hard you can squeeze this thing\nat a given time of day.\nIt draws to mind just a\nlittle neuroscience factoid.\nIn the world of circadian neurobiology,\none of the consistent findings is that,\nin the middle of your nighttime,\nthey'll wake people up and\nthey'll say, do this test.\nIn the laboratory they\nuse a different apparatus,\nbut it's essentially the same thing,\nand in the middle of the night,\ngrip strength is very, very low,\nand at mid-morning, grip strength is high,\nand as the body temperature goes up\ninto the afternoon, grip\nstrength goes higher\nand higher and higher,\nand then it drops of.\nThere's a circadian rhythm\nin grip temperature.\nSo you probably want to do this\nat more or less the same time each day,\nif you're going to use it.\nBut I think it's brilliant\nin its simplicity\nand its directness to\nthese upper motor neurons,\n'cause that's really what it's assessing,\nyour ability, again,\nit's about the ability\nto contract the muscles hard.\nIf you can't do that,\nyou're not going to get\nan effective workout.\n- Yeah, and they also, I\nmean there certainly are\nmore sophisticated tools, too, as a PT,\nthat we have hand grip dynamometers,\nand we can measure one\nside at a time, too.\nI'm not really, I'm getting\na little bit blinded\nby the fact that both hands are squeezing\ninto that scale and I don't get, really,\na left/right comparison.\nBut even at that level, that could give\nyou a little bit more detail,\nbut that comes at a cost.\nThose are pretty expensive devices,\nbut if it's, listen,\nif you were an athlete,\nthe 200, 300 bucks it costs to have one\nof those would be well-worth\nthe added investment.\n- And I'm sure some of our\nlisteners will want one, too,\n'cause there are a lot\nof tech geeks out there.\nNot tech industry geeks, but\npeople who like tech gear.\nWhat's it called again?\n- It's a hand grip dynamometer.\n- Hand grip dynamometer.\n- [Jeff] Dynamometer.\nIt's a tough one.\n- Said by Jeff\nwith the great East Coast accent\nand by me, in a terrible,\nbotched it, West Coast version.\nThank you.\n[upbeat rock music]"
