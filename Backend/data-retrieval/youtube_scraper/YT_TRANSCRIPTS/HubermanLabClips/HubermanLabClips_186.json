    "video_title": "Are Mania & Bipolar Related to Creativity? | Dr. Andrew Huberman",
    "transcript": "- I'd like to just briefly touch upon\nthis idea that certain occupations\nare associated with a higher incidence\nof bipolar depression, and in fact,\nit's been explored, at\na research level really,\nthere are data pointing to the fact\nthat certain individuals\nof certain occupations\ntend to be more creative,\nand that creativity is associated with,\nagain, associated, this isn't causal,\nit's associated or correlated with,\nhigher levels or incidents\nof bipolar depression\nand maybe even other forms of depression.\nSo this is a study\nlooking at mood disorders\nin eminent individuals,\nso these are people that are\nnot just good at what they do,\nbut are exceptional at what they do.\nAnd explored the percentage\nof people in given professions\nwith either depression or mania,\nand this was actually a data set,\ngleaned from more than 1,000\n20th century Westerners,\nbased on their biographies\nthat were reviewed by other people.\nSo it's a bit of an indirect measurement,\nthis isn't, you know, psychiatrist data.\nThis is data, or I should say,\nthese are data that were\ncompiled from self reports\nor from reads of self reports,\nand they explored a number\nof different professions.\nSo for instance, they looked\nat people in the military,\nor people who were professional athletes,\nor natural scientists,\nor social scientists,\npeople who occupied\npositions in public office\nor were musical performers, artists,\nnonfiction writers, poetry, et cetera.\nThere are a lot of professions here.\nI will post this,\nor I'll post a link to it\nin the show note captions\nfor you to peruse,\nbut I'll just give you a sense\nof the extremes on this graph\nbecause they're very interesting.\nTurns out that, if you were\nto look at the profession,\nor I should say\namong the professions they\nlooked at in this study,\n'cause they didn't look\nat all professions,\nthose in the military\nand those who are professional athletes\nor had jobs in the social\nor natural sciences had the,\nof those, there was a\nlower percentage of those\nthat had depression or mania.\nIn some cases,\nlike those who were professional athletes,\ndidn't seem to have,\nthere was no incidence of\nmania at least in this dataset.\nWhereas, at the opposite\nextreme of the graph,\nthose that were poets, so\nthese are eminent individuals,\npeople that were exceptional poets,\nexceptional fiction writers,\nexceptional artists or nonfiction writers,\nwell, they are, especially for the poets,\nyou find that as many as 90%\nof these very successful poets\nhad either depression or mania\nAs high as 90%, that's incredible.\nContrast that with military,\nwhere it's as few as 10%,\nor professional athletes,\nwhere it's as few as 20%,\nand for the professional\nathletes, as I mentioned before,\nnone of them had mania.\nSo, does this mean that being a poet\nwill make you manic or depressed?\nWell, first of all, let's\nlook at the poetry category.\nIt turns out that 75%\nof these eminent poets,\nthese highly accomplished\npoets had major depression,\nwhereas, only about 20% of\nthose poets had manic episodes.\nOkay, so again,\nit's not that being a poet\nis going to give you mania.\nCertainly, we're not saying that.\nIt's not that being a poet is\ngoing to give you depression,\nbut it turns out,\nthat people with depression\nand people with depression and mania\nseem to gravitate towards poetry\nor at least are very successful at poetry.\nAgain, associative, correlative,\nno causal relationship here.\nBut it is really striking to see\nhow the creative occupations,\npoetry, fiction, art, nonfiction writing,\neven though nonfiction\nwriting is about nonfiction,\nit's still creative, music,\ncomposition, theater,\nmuch higher incidents\nof things like mania.\nAnd in fact, for the people\nin theater, the actors,\neven though the overall\noccurrence of depression and mania\nis lower than that in poets,\nthe fraction of those\nindividuals that have mania\nis exceedingly high.\nIt's about 30% of those that\nthey looked at who are actors\nhave manic episodes or\nhave full blown mania.\nSo I'm referring to these\ndata because first of all,\nI find them incredibly interesting.\nRight up until now,\nwe've been talking about bipolar disorder\nand other mood disorders for\ntheir maladaptive effects,\nand again, they're extremely maladaptive,\nmuch much higher incidence\nof suicide, et cetera,\nbut we'd be wrong to say\nthat certain aspects of manic episodes\ndon't lend themselves well to creativity\nor that certain aspects\nof major depression\ndon't lend themselves well to creativity\nor to the performing arts or to poetry.\nThat said, in no way, shape, or form,\ndo I believe that being\ndepressed is a good thing\nor that being manic is a good thing.\nAgain, we return to the\nbasic foundational criteria\nfor bipolar disorder and major depression,\nwhich is that the pressured\nspeech, the not sleeping,\nthe incredible increases in\nenergy and the flights of ideas\nare generally not going to lead,\nor I think it's fair to say,\nare not going to lead to good places,\nin fact, often lead to bad places.\nBut we would also be wrong,\nif we didn't consider the fact,\nthat there's a somewhat\ninextricable relationship\nbetween mania and creativity.\nAnd it could be that hypomania\nor brief periods of mania,\nmaybe even an hour a\nday or 30 minutes a day\nof composing or writing poetry,\nmaybe even some of the\nlows that we feel, right,\nsome of the sadness, some of the grief,\nsome of the nostalgia that we feel,\nprovided that it's not pathologic,\nthat it's not persistent\nfor the four or seven days\nthat are diagnostic of bipolar II\nand bipolar I disorder, respectively,\nwell, then we can start\nto view emotional states\nas something that can\nactually lend themselves\nto positive outcomes and\nmaybe even to creativity\nand to improved occupations.\nSo it's important that\nwe have a nuanced view\nof what sadness versus depression\nversus major depression are.\nIt's important that we distinguish\nbetween being erratic,\nbeing very energized,\nand full blown bipolar disorder,\nand I raise this for\nanother reason as well.\nNowadays, it's very common\nto hear people saying,\n\"Ugh, you know, that person is OCD.\"\nWell, on the episode about OCD\nthat I did a few weeks back\nthat you can find, if you\nlike, at hubermanlab.com.\nIn that episode,\nI pointed out that OCD,\nobsessive compulsive disorder,\nis very maladaptive, right.\nI think it's number seven, as I recall,\non the list of debilitating\ndiseases, all diseases,\nin terms of lost time at work,\nsuffering relationships, et cetera.\nSo, it's a really serious condition,\nand yet we often hear, \"Oh,\nthat person is obsessive.\"\nAnd as I pointed out,\nthere is obsessive compulsive\npersonality disorder,\nand then there is obsessive\ncompulsive tendencies,\nwhich actually benefit people.\nBut that is distinct from\nobsessive compulsive disorder,\nas a clinically diagnosed thing.\nSimilarly, we hear that, \"Oh,\nsomebody's being bipolar,\n\"you know, they're all over\nthe place, they're bipolar.\"\nWell, that's a very\nsubjective kind of label\nthat people give one another in passing.\nMore and more often I'm hearing this,\nand yet bipolar disorder,\nwhether or not it's BP I or BP II,\nare extremely maladaptive\nand extremely associated\nwith high suicide risk.\nSo, while I'm not here to police people,\nI'm not certainly not the word police\nor the nomenclature police,\nI do think that whether\nor not you refer to people\nas OCD or as bipolar, et\ncetera, that's up to you.\nAll right, it's not my place to say,\nbut I do think it's important\nthat all of us understand\nthat these psychiatric conditions\ncarry with them tremendous\nmaladaptive weight.\n[rock music]"
