    "video_title": "What's the History of Lithium? How Does It Treat Bipolar Disorder? | Dr. Andrew Huberman",
    "transcript": "- Discovery of lithium\nas a treatment for bipolar disorder\nis truly a miraculous story\nthat I think everyone should know.\nThe key player in this\nstory is a physician\nby the last name Cade.\nHe was an Australian physician.\nAnd Cade has a very interesting\nstory in his own right.\nCade was an Australian psychiatrist,\nor Australian psychiatrist,\nwho also was a soldier.\nAnd, during World War II,\nafter the fall of Singapore to Japan,\nhe became a prisoner of war.\nAnd he was a prisoner of\nwar from 1942 until 1945.\nSo he had some time for observation.\nAnd during his imprisonment,\nhe observed some of his fellow inmates\nas going through pretty wild vacillations\nin mood and energy.\nEssentially going from manic episodes\nto depressed episodes\nor from manic to normal episodes.\nAnd for one reason or\nanother, we don't know why,\nbecause I couldn't find any report\nas to why he hypothesized this,\nbut he hypothesized that\nthere was some buildup\nof some chemical in these people's brains\nthat then they would urinate out.\nAnd that urinating out of\nwhatever chemical was in there\nwould allow them to be\nmore relaxed and not manic.\nIn other words,\nCade hypothesized that there's\na buildup of a chemical\nin certain people's brains\nthat makes them manic.\nAnd they urinate that chemical out.\nSo eventually, he got out of this prison,\nas we mentioned, in 1945.\nAnd he started doing experiments\nin addition to seeing\npatients in his clinic.\nAnd what he did is he\nstarted to take urine\nfrom people who exhibited mania\nand urine from people who were not manic.\nAnd he took that urine\nand he would inject it\ninto guinea pigs as an experimental model.\nAnd his general observation\nwas that there was something in the urine\nthat was indeed making\nthe guinea pigs more manic\nif they were injected with urine\nfrom a manic patient, right?\nThe exact measures that he was taking\nin these guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.\nThis is at a time\nor an era in science\nwhen you could just sort of report things\na little bit more subjectively.\nAlthough there were still\nnumbers and statistics,\nit was a little bit more\nof like case studies and descriptions.\nBut it turns out that even though\nthat all seems a little bit loose,\nit led to some incredible\nand still important discoveries\nfor psychiatric health.\nSo what he figured out was that the urine\nfrom manic patients seemed\nto be more toxic for these guinea pigs.\nAnd he also knew that there\nare two toxic substances\nin urine.\nUrea and uric acid.\nSo he was able to separate\nthe urea and uric acid\nfrom people with mania and\npatients that did not have mania.\nAnd he figured out that the urea\nwas the same in both these\nmentally ill manic patients\nand the non-manic patients.\nSo it did not seem that urea\nwas the compound that was\ncreating these manic episodes\nor related to manic episodes\nor held the toxicity.\nSo instead, he focused on the uric acid.\nNow, in order to put the\nuric acid into solution\nso that he could inject\nit into these guinea pigs,\nhe had to try a number\nof different compounds\nin order to dilute it.\nIt just so happens that,\nand you chemists will\nbe familiar with this,\nbut there's certain things that just\ndon't go into solution easily.\nYou put the powder in a vial,\nyou add some water or a\nsaline or another solution.\nYou mix it up and the powder\nstays suspended in there.\nIt just doesn't,\nit doesn't actually ever\nbecome a clear liquid\nthat you can inject.\nSo in order to try injecting\ndifferent strengths\nof uric acid,\nhe ended up using lithium\nto assist in the dilution.\nAnd lithium worked.\nSo what he basically was doing,\nagain for you chemists,\nis he was taking uric acid.\nHe was adding lithium\nand making a solution of lithium urate.\nOkay?\nThis is a lot of details.\nBut this is important because\nwhat he eventually found is\nthat when he diluted the\nuric acid with lithium\nand created lithium urate,\nlithium urate could actually calm down\nthese guinea pigs that were injected\nwith the toxic urea.\nHe also found that lithium urate\nhad a generally calming\neffect on these guinea pigs.\nSo now we're really off\nin crazy territory, right?\nWe're talking about urine from patients\nthat's separating out urea and uric acid.\nWe're adding lithium to the uric acid.\nWe're injecting this into guinea pigs.\nThis is getting pretty\nwild and pretty weird.\nBut this is medicine.\nAnd, from time to time, this\nis medicine and science.\nCade was a good scientist\nin addition to being a good physician.\nAnd by good scientist,\nI mean that he did control experiments.\nHere he was injecting\nlithium urate into animals\nand seeing an effect.\nBut he knew that that solution\nof lithium urate contained\nnot just the uric acid,\nbut it also contained lithium.\nAnd so he quite appropriately asked\nmaybe the lithium alone is having\nthis calming effect on these guinea pigs.\nAnd, indeed, that was the case.\nWhen he did the proper control experiment\nand injected only lithium\nsolution into these guinea pigs,\nthey calmed down.\nFrom there, he, in sort\nof 1940s style medicine.\nThis would not happen now.\nHe very quickly moved\nfrom that animal model\ninto human patients\nand started injecting\nhuman patients with lithium\nor providing lithium\norally to those patients.\nAnd, lo and behold, found\nan absolutely profound\nand positive effect of lithium\nin reducing symptoms of mania.\nAnd, as all good physician scientists do,\nhe wrote up his results.\nAnd he wrote it up in a paper entitled,\n\"Lithium salts in the treatment\nof psychotic excitement.\"\nOkay, back then they didn't call it mania.\nThey called it psychotic excitement.\nThis is a paper that was\npublished September 3rd, 1949\nin the Medical Journal of Australia.\nWe will provide a link to this study\nas now a classic study in\nthe field of psychiatry.\nIt's a really wonderful paper to read.\nAnd actually I encourage people,\neven if you're not a\nscientist or a clinician,\nto just take a quick\nlook at the second page\nin this paper that we've\nmade available to you.\nWhere he describes each of\nthe various case studies\nor the individuals that he looked at.\nI'm not going to read these in detail now\n'cause it would take a\nlot of unnecessary time.\nBut things like,\n\"Case seven.\nMC, aged 40 years old.\nSuffering from recurrent mania.\nIn this episode, he'd been excited,\nrestless, and violent for over two months\nand was interfering so often\nthat he had to be confined\nto a single room during the day.\"\nRight? So this is very debilitating.\nWhat we now know to be bipolar depression.\n\"He commenced taking\nlithium citrate, 20 grains.\"\nThat's a measure of the amount of lithium.\n\"Three times a day.\nIn four days, he was distinctly quieter.\nAnd by February 13th, 1949,\nappeared practically normal.\nHe continued well.\nAnd on February 20th, 1949,\nthe dose of citrate was\nreduced to 10 grains,\net cetera, et cetera.\nHe left the hospital.\"\nThere are numerous descriptions\nof this sort within this paper,\nincluding some descriptions of patients\nthat did not see such success.\nAnd including some\ndescriptions of patients\nthat suffered from some\nnegative side effects.\nSo that's important to point out as well.\nBut it's an absolutely wonderful paper.\nAnd it's an absolutely wonderful voyage\ninto the history of psychiatry,\nright down to the discussion where,\nin just three short paragraphs,\nCade really lays out the case\nfor why lithium is such\na important discovery\nin the treatment of what,\nat that time, they were\ncalling psychotic excitement\nand what we now know to be\nmanic bipolar depression.\n[upbeat rock music]"
