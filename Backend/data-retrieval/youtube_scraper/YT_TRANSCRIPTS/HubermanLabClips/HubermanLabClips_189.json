    "transcript": "- The way that bipolar\ndisorder can present\ncan vary tremendously between individuals.\nOne person might go\nfrom very high highs that\nlast seven days or more\nto very low lows, bouts of\ndepression, major depression\nthat can last two weeks or more.\nOther people are rapid\ncycling by way of, you know,\nthree days manic, three days\nnormal, three days manic,\nand then dropping into\nthree days depression.\nSo you want to erase\nthat picture in your mind\nthat manic bipolar\ndisorder is this sine wave,\nthis cycling up and down\nbetween mania and depression.\nIt can take a lot of different forms.\nThis is a serious challenge\nfor the psychiatrist to diagnose\npeople because of that fact\nthat they're only getting\na snapshot of the person,\nunless they've known them for some time\nand working with them for some time.\nBut this is also especially\nimportant for those of you\nthat either have bipolar depression\nor suspect that you might,\nor that know someone\nwith bipolar depression\nor suspect somebody might\nhave bipolar depression,\nAKA bipolar disorder."
