    "transcript": "- Let me tell you about the gut-brain axis\nand our insatiable\nappetite for sugar and fat.\nInsatiable for sugar,\nunquenchable for fat.\nAnd this is a story about\nthe fundamental difference\nbetween liking and wanting.\nLiking sugar is the\nfunction of the taste system.\nAnd it's not really liking\nsugar, it's liking sweet.\nWanting sugar,\nour never ending appetite for sugar\nis the story of the gut-brain axis,\nliking versus wanting.\nAnd this is work of my own laboratory,\nthat began long ago when we\ndiscovered the sweet receptors.\nAnd you can now engineer mice\nthat lack these receptors.\nSo, in essence these animals\nwill be unable to taste sweet,\na life without sweetness, how horrible.\nAnd if you give a normal mouse,\na bottle containing sweet,\nand we're going to put either sugar\nor an artificial sweetener, all right?\nThey both are sweet, they have\nslightly different tastes,\nbut that's simply because\nartificial sweeteners\nhave some off tastes.\nBut as far as the sweet\nreceptor is concerned,\nthey both activate the same receptor,\ntrigger the same signal.\nAnd if you give an animal an option\nof a bottle containing sugar\nor a sweetener versus water,\nthis animal will drink 10 to one\nfrom the bottle containing sweet.\nThat's the taste system,\nanimal goes samples each one,\nleaks a couple of leaks and then says,\nthat's the one I want\nbecause it's appetitive\nand because I love it.\n- So it prefers sugar\nto artificial sweetener.\n- No, no, no, no, no, in this experiment,\nI'm going to put only sweet in one bottle,\nand it could be either sugar\nor artificial sweetener,\nit doesn't matter which one, okay?\nWe're going to do the next experiment\nwhere we separate those two,\nfor now it's sweet versus water.\n- [Andrew] Okay.\n- And sweet means sweet, not sugar,\nsweet means anything that\ntastes sweet, all right?\nAnd sugar is one example and\nSplenda is another example.\n- Aspartame, monkfruit,\nstevia, doesn't matter.\n- Yeah, I mean, there's some\nthat only humans can taste,\nmice cannot taste because the receptors\nbetween humans and mice are different.\nBut we have put the\nhuman receptor into mice,\nwe engineer mice, and\nwe completely humanize\nthis mouse's taste world, all right?\nBut for the purpose of this conversation,\nwe're only comparing sweet versus water.\nAn option, my goodness, they\nwill lick from the sweet side\n10 to one at least versus\nthe water, makes sense?\nAlright, now we're going to take the mice\nand we're going to genetically engineer it\nto remove the sweet receptors.\nSo this mice no longer\nhave in their oral cavity\nany sensors that can detect sweetness,\nbe that sugar molecule, be\nit an artificial sweetener,\nbe it anything else that tastes sweet.\nAnd if you give this mice an option\nbetween sweet versus\nwater, sugar versus water,\nartificial sweetener versus water,\nit will drink equally well from both\nbecause it cannot tell them apart,\nbecause it doesn't have\nthe receptors for sweet,\nso that sweet bottle tastes\njust like water, makes sense?\n- [Andrew] Makes sense.\n- Very good.\nNow we're going to do the\nexperiment with sugar,\nfrom now on let's focus on sugar.\nSo I'm going to give a mouse\nnow, sugar versus water.\nNormal mouse will drink from\nthe sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar,\nvery little from the water.\nKnockout the sweet\nreceptors, eliminate them,\nmouse can no longer tell them apart,\nand they will drink from both.\nBut if I keep the mouse in that\ncage for the next 48 hours,\nsomething extraordinary happens\nwhen I come 48 hours later\nand I see what the mouse is\nlicking or drinking from,\nthe mouse is drinking almost exclusively\nfrom the sugar bottle.\nHow could this be?\nIt cannot taste it,\nit doesn't have sweet receptors.\nDuring those 48 hours,\nthe mouse learned that there\nis something in that bottle\nthat makes me feel good,\nand that is the bottle I want to consume.\nNow, how does the mouse\nidentify that bottle?\nIt does so by using\nother sensory features,\nthe smell of the bottle,\nthe texture of the solution inside,\nsugar, the high concentrations\nis kind of goopy.\nThe side in which the\nbottle is in the cage,\nit doesn't matter what,\nbut the mouse realized\nthere is something there\nthat makes me feel good\nand that's what I want,\nand that is the fundamental basis\nof our unquenchable desire\nand our craving for sugar,\nand is mediated by the gut-brain axis.\nThe first clue is that it\ntakes a long time to develop,\nimmediately suggesting\na post-ingestive effect.\nSo we reason if this is true\nand it's the gut-brain axis\nthat's driving sugar preference,\nthen there should be a group\nof neurons in the brain\nthat are responding to\npost-ingestive sugar.\nAnd lo and behold, we\nidentify a group of neurons\nin the brain that does this,\nand these neurons receive their input\ndirectly from the gut-brain axis.\n- From other neurons.\n- You got it.\nAnd so what's happening is that\nsugar is recognized normally\nby the tongue, activates\nan appetitive response,\nnow you ingest it,\nand now it activates a\nselective group of cells\nin your intestines that now\nsend a signal to the brain\nvia the vagal ganglia that says,\nI got what I need.\nThe tongue doesn't know\nthat you got what you need,\nit only knows that you tasted it.\nThis knows that you got to the point\nthat it's going to be\nused, which is the gut.\nAnd now it sends the\nsignal to now reinforce\nthe consumption of this thing\nbecause this is the one that I needed,\nsugar, source of energy.\n- And are these neurons in the gut?\n- So, these are not neurons in the gut,\nso these are gut cells that\nrecognize the sugar molecules,\nsend the signal and\nthat signal is received\nby the vagal neuron directly.\n- Got it.\n- And they send a signal\nthrough the gut-brain axis\nto the cell bodies of these\nneurons in the vagal ganglia,\nand from there to the brain stem\nto now trigger the preference for sugar.\n- Two questions, one, you\nmentioned that these cells\nthat detect sugar within the gut\nare actually within the\nintestine, you didn't say stomach.\nWhich surprised me, I\nalways think gut as stomach.\n- No, no, they're intestine\nbecause that's where all\nthe absorption happens.\nSo you want the signal, you\nsee, you want the brain to know\nthat you had successful\ningestion and breakdown\nof whatever you consume into\nthe building blocks of life.\nAnd, you know, glucose, amino acids, fat,\nand so you want to make sure\nthat once they are in the form\nthat intestines can now absorb them,\nis where you get the signal back saying,\nthis is what I want, okay?\nNow, let me just take it one step further.\nAnd this now sugar molecules activates\nthis unique gut-brain circuit\nthat now drives the development\nof our preference for sugar.\nNow, a key element of this circuit\nis that the sensors in the\ngut that recognize the sugar\ndo not recognize artificial\nsweeteners at all.\n- Because their nutrient value\nis uncoupled from the taste.\n- Generically speaking one can make that,\nbut it's because it's a very\ndifferent type of receptor,\nturns out that it's not\nthe tongue receptors\nbeing used in the gut,\nit's a completely different molecule\nthat only recognizes the glucose molecule,\nnot artificial sweeteners.\nThis has a profound impact\non the effect of ultimately\nartificial sweeteners\nin curbing our appetite, our craving,\nour insatiable desire for sugar.\nSince they don't activate\nthe gut-brain axis,\nthey'll never satisfy the craving\nfor sugar like sugar does.\nAnd the reason I believe\nthat artificial sweeteners\nhave failed in the market\nto curve our appetite, our need,\nour desire for sugar\nis because they beautifully\nwork on the tongue,\nthe liking to recognize sweet\nversus non-sweet,\nbut they fail to activate\nthe key sensors in the gut\nthat now inform the brain,\nyou got sugar, no need to crave anymore.\n- So, the issue of wanting,\ncan we relate that\nto a particular set of\nneurochemicals upstream of,\nso glucose is activating\nthe cells in the gut,\nthrough the vagus that's communicated\nthrough presumably the nodose ganglion\nand up into the brain stem.\n- Very good, and from\nthere, where does it go?\n- Yeah, where is it going, what\nis the substrate of wanting?\nYou know, of course I think molecules,\nlike dopamine, craving,\nthere's a book even called \"The\nMolecule of More,\" etc, etc.\nDopamine is a very diabolical\nmolecule as you know\nbecause it evokes both\na sense of pleasure-ish,\nbut also a sense of\ndesiring more, of craving.\nSo, if I understand you correctly,\nartificial sweeteners are, and I agree,\nare failing as a means\nto satisfy sugar craving\nat the level of nutrient sensing,\nand yet if we trigger\nthis true sugar evoked\nwanting pathway too much,\nand we've all experienced\nthis, then we eat sugar\nand we find ourselves\nwanting more and more sugar.\nNow, that could also be\ninsulin dysregulation,\nbut can we uncouple those?\n- Yeah, I mean, look,\nwe have a mega problem\nwith over consumption of sugar and fat.\nWe're facing a unique\ntime in our evolution\nwhere diseases of malnutrition\nare due to overnutrition,\nI mean, how nuts is that?\nI mean, historically,\ndiseases of malnutrition\nhave always been linked to undernutrition.\nAnd so we need to come up with strategies\nthat can meaningfully change\nthe activation of these circuits\nthat control our wanting,\ncertainly in the populations at risk.\nAnd this gut-brain circuit\nthat ultimately,\nyou know, it's the lines of communication\nthat are informing the brain\nthe presence of intestinal\nsugar in this example,\nit's a very important target\nin the way we think about,\nis there a way that we can meaningfully\nmodulate these circuits?\nSo, I make your brain think\nthat you got satisfied with sugar\neven though I'm not giving you sugar.\n- So that immediately raises the question,\nare the receptors for glucose\nin these gut cells susceptible\nto other things that are healthier for us?\n- That's very good, excellent idea.\nAnd I think an important goal\nwill be to come up with a strategy\nand identify those very means\nthat allow us to modulate the circuits\nin a way that certainly for all of those\nwhere this is a big issue,\nit can really have a,\nyou know, dramatic impact\nin improving human health.\n[upbeat music]"
