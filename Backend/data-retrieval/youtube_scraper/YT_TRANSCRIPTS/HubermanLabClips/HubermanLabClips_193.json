    "transcript": "- [Andrew] Recently I had\nthe pleasure of hosting\nthe one and only Ido Portal,\non the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nIdo Portal is credited\nwith being the world expert\nin all things movement,\nand the person who coined\nthe term movement culture,\nwhich is the gathering in and\naround movement practices.\nIdo and his colleagues\nhave essentially combined\nall the different forms of\nmovement that exist out there,\nand expanded upon them, to\ncreate patterns of movement\nthat utilize all aspects\nof the nervous system,\nand that can be incorporated\nnot just into sport,\nand dance, et cetera,\nbut also into daily life.\nNeedless to say was a\nvery special experience\nfor me to get direct movement instruction\nfrom the luminary of movement Ido Portal.\nI became not hyper\nconscious of every movement,\nbut certainly far more\naware of my posture,\nand the various movements that I make,\nand has led me to start to\nincorporate some of those same\nmovement practices into my daily routine."
