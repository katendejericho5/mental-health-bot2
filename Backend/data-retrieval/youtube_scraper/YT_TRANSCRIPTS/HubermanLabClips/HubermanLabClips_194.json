    "transcript": "- [Andrew] Recently I had the pleasure\nof hosting the one and only Ido Portal\non the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nI know many people are\nfamiliar with Ido and his work,\nbut for those of you that might not be,\nIdo Portal is credited\nwith being the world expert\nin all things movement\nand the person who coined\nthe term Movement Culture,\nwhich is the gathering in\nand around movement practices\nthat span from sport to martial\narts, to dance, gymnastics.\nIdo and his colleagues\nhave essentially combined\nall the different forms of\nmovement that exist out there\nand expanded upon them to\ncreate patterns of movement\nthat utilize all aspects\nof the nervous system\nand that can be incorporated\nnot just into sport and dance, et cetera,\nbut also into daily life.\nHaving Ido on the podcast\noffered the unique opportunity\nto learn directly from him.\nAnd so rather than just sit\nin front of a couple of\nmicrophones, which we did,\nwe also spent many hours\ndoing movement practices,\nthe first of which actually\ninvolved no movement.\nIt began by lying on the floor.\nAnd Ido gave me and Odelia,\none of his colleagues,\ninstruction as to how to move\nout of a motionless state\nin very deliberate ways,\nas well as incorporating things\nlike facial and eye movements,\nwhich felt very unusual, I confess,\nbut quickly led to an expansion\ninto other forms of movement\nthat were dynamic and\ninvolved multiple people.\nYou could call this dance or\nyou could call this sport,\nbut really what it involved\nis setting a small number of\nground rules or constraints\nas to how one could or could not move,\ndictated to me by Ido.\nAnd that forced me to\nmove in very specific ways\nthat sometimes were very\nuncomfortable to me,\nnot painful, but uncomfortable\nmeaning that they didn't\nnecessarily bring me\nto a place of reflexive action.\nI had to think very hard.\nBut very soon,\nI noticed I was able to carry out\nthe movements constrained by\nthose rules in a reflexive way,\nwhich was very surprising\nand told me that the neural circuits\nfor those particular\nmovements had to have existed\nbefore that training with Ido,\nbecause there's simply no way\nthey could have wired up\nvery quickly in the moment.\nSo essentially what Ido was\ndoing was revealing to me\nor allowing me to reveal to myself\nthe different patterns of movement\nthat are contained in the\nlanguage of my nervous system\nbut that I was unaware of\nprior to the work with him.\nThen we moved on to some other\nsorts of dynamic movements\ninvolving high-level coordination\nof using feet and hands\nto stomp on tennis balls, bounce them up,\ngrab them with the hand\nthat was dictated in the moment by Ido.\nThat was challenging at\ntimes, to say the least.\nOther patterns of movement involved\nan extreme amount of balance.\nAgain, my balance not being terrible,\nbut certainly not being\nat a high-level skill\nand certainly not having done\nthese sorts of moving practices before,\nI struggled quite a lot,\nbut found that within\neach movement practice,\nat the point of struggle,\nthere was often a\nbreakthrough into getting it\nor suddenly feeling as if my body\ncould perform the movements,\nwhereas a few moments before, I couldn't.\nOne of the more challenging drills,\nI guess you would call it,\nor practices that Ido put me through\nwas one in which he would change the rules\nwithin the moments of movement.\nSo that one had to both be\npaying careful attention\nto the instruction and to\nthe movement, mid-movement,\nand change those movements,\nwhich as a neuroscientist I can tell you\nhas to involve a lot of what\nwe call top-down control,\nthat is, engagement of\nthe forebrain circuits\nfor anticipation and\nlearning and rule acquisition\nand to combine those\nwith reflexive action\nand deliberate action.\nAnd what I discovered was\nthat there were two things\nthat really helped with that.\nOne was to so-called clear the mind,\nbut, of course, nobody knows\nwhat clearing the mind is\nnor how to do it.\nWhat this involved for me\nwas making sure that I did\nnot generate any movements\nuntil the command was delivered\nand then taking a pause\nbefore generating the movement\nthat I was instructed to do,\nwhich at first felt slow and clunky,\nbut clearly led to faster,\nmore accurate execution\nof the instructed movement.\nAnd the second one was to\ntry and forget the rule\nas soon as I learned it,\nbecause indeed the rules\nwere changing very quickly.\nThere were many other\nteachings and learnings\nthroughout the day,\nthat is, Ido teaching and\nme attempting to learn.\nAnd by the end of the day,\nI confess I felt quite\ndifferently in my body.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nI became, not hyper-conscious\nof every movement,\nbut certainly far more aware\nof my posture and the various\nmovements that I make.\nAnd I have to say that has continued,\nnot just for several days or weeks,\nbut for several months\nafter that single day of\nmovement practice with Ido,\nwhich I find remarkable and encouraging\nand has led me to start to incorporate\nsome of those same movement\npractices into my daily routine.\nNeedless to say, it was\na very special experience\nfor me to get direct movement instruction\nfrom the luminary of movement, Ido Portal.\nAnd I also couldn't help\nmyself but to ask Ido\nto perform some movement practices for us,\nbecause he is so unbelievably skilled,\nand he most graciously did."
