    "transcript": "- If you are going to\ngo out in the morning,\nin the summer you're going\nto get a much bright.\nThat's why I don't like\nthe change in time.\nI know people think, oh,\nbecause you're biased you,\nbecause I think\n- Wait, wait, wait, wait, sorry.\nThe change time, are you\ntalking about daylight savings?\n- Daylight saving, it's such a bad idea.\nBecause it disrupts that\nrhythm, that you're having.\nCause I think your body\nif you keep that rhythm\nyou will see the whole seasonality.\nAnd I look at it from a different\naspect than other people.\nIt really, and people say I'm biased\nbecause I'm a morning person\nand it may be true, but there is situation\n- Secret conspiracy, but mourning people.\n- Yeah. But there is, if\nyou think about it, Andrew.\nThere is a situation where\nyou're getting light perfectly well\nand then all of a sudden\nthey delayed by one hour\nbecause, and then even\nthough it's the summer,\nyour body now if you're\nstill not adjusting,\nthink, oh wait, what happened?\nWhat kind of happened?\n- Well, I'm glad you're bringing this up\nbecause I always thought\nyou know, what's the big\ndeal? One hour. Right?\nOne hour shift, you spring fall back.\n- Its so hard to adjust to one hour.\n- But the, but this goes back\nto the beginning of our discussion.\nIt's not just one hour?\n- [Samer] Right.\n- Because it's one hour\nacross that one day.\n- [Samer] Right.\n- But there's this cumulative\neffect on the clock\nand these three elements of your\n- Yeah\n- Tripartite model.\n- Exactly.\nLike the homeostatic sleep\nand the light direct effects on mood.\n- And when it's so close\nit's sometimes hard to\nfigure out how to adjust it perfectly.\nBecause you know, we are\nalready sleep deprived\nin our society and then you shift it by,\nyou know, so it just, it all accumulates\nand it has no benefit.\n- Well, you work at a major\ngovernment organization\nNational Institute of Mental Health.\nWhy don't we campaign for\n- Honestly, I have no idea.\nI mean it makes no sense.\n- No, I'm saying why don't we go campaign\n- I Would love to.\nI mean, it makes no\nsense to have the summer\nlight goes up at 9:00 PM.\nThe light goes down in,\nwhere I live in Baltimore at 9:00 PM.\nAnd then, all of a sudden\nwhen you really want to\nsee the light longer in the\nday you now shift the other way\nand now it goes all of\na sudden at 6:00 PM.\nWhy do you do these drastic changes?\nWell, let it blend across\nthe whole season, you know.\nYes. Later, earlier at night,\nbut it's at least consistent.\nIt goes in a very consistent manner.\nI just don't understand why they do this.\nIt makes no sense.\n- Well, I think that the reason they do it\nis because they don't\nunderstand the biology.\n- Exactly.\n- Because one hour seems trivial\nunless you understand\nthe repercussions of that one hour shift.\nBecause, what's also clear now\nbased on what you're saying\nis that that one hour shift is taking you\nout of alignment with the\nnatural light dark cycle\nin exactly the wrong direction.\n- It's pushing people to get even later.\n- [Andrew] Yeah.\n- In the summer, when light is\ngoing to push you later anyway.\nIt doesn't make sense,\nyou put it beautifully.\nI just rambled and this is\n- No, no, no, you made it clear.\n- I Mean, it's like literally it made you\nit made people who are having problem,\nhaving an advanced sleep rhythm\nbecause they are delayed.\nNow you give them this hour to\nmake them even more delayed.\nYou push them even later\nin the day night cycle.\nIt just doesn't make sense, at all.\n- I think 2022 should be\nthe year that we abolish,\n- Oh man, that would save\nthe day for me, honestly.\n- Well, I said, well also\nif it has a positive effect\non the, what is essentially an epidemic\nof mental health issues\nand other issues related to\nimproper interactions with light\nthat I think is a well worthwhile cause,\n- Absolutely, absolutely.\n- And we can, so for once,\nwe're going to fight with some\nwith another\n- Common I would love,\n- a common battle, as\nopposed to with one another.\n- I mean the circadian people, honestly\nto give them credit have been trying\nfor years to abolish daylight saving.\n- Yeah. The problem is they\nall go to sleep at 9:00 PM\nand wake up at 4:00 AM\nso we never see them.\nNow, the circadian community\nhas done an amazing job\nof figuring out what we need.\n- [Samer] Right.\n- And then the challenge of course is\nmaking sure that people\nget what they need.\nAnd making sure that other societal level\nwe're not vaulting ourself into the wrong\n- And the biggest problem is\nthat the late waking people\nthey think that really,\nand I'm going to try to\nput it in a better way now.\nThey think, oh, because\nyou are a morning person,\nyou are want to see the sun early.\nSo you want me to suffer it dropping late.\nBut that's not the case.\nBecause what happens is\nwhen they shift it back\nafter the daylight saving,\nnow they're going to make\nyou suffer really badly\nbecause now it's going to be earlier.\n- Right. In the fall\n- In the fall when there's\nnothing enough light\nif they keep it the same way.\nSo try to convince them that\nactually this at the end,\ncause it more trouble\nwhen you need the light\nfor your late schedule in the\nfall when they shift it back,\nthen they say keep it\ndaylight saving all the time.\nAnd that has been proven that is very bad.\nLike people have done\nstudies that literally\ntwo areas close to each others\nand areas that were the\nwhole year on daylight saving\nhas much more problems even in\ncancer rates, in depression.\nSo you don't want to do that.\nSo that's what trying to convince people\nthat you need to prevent that switch\nand you don't need daylight saving at all.\nThat's where the problem happens.\n- Interesting. I had\nnot thought about that.\nBut yes you late risers that in the fall,\nwhen they, when the, you\nfall back as they say,\nspring forward, fall back\nyou dial back the clock,\nit's really compounding the problem\n- Exactly.\n- that already exists.\n- And it's really nice if you think,\nif you keep it consistent in the spring\nyou get the, you know,\nwhen you get the Equinox\nand then the days start going up\nand then even in the\nsummer start going down\nand then the fall you get the\nother Equinox and go back.\nSo it's very symmetrical, right?\nIt goes into short day,\nlonger longer longer\nthen short day again.\nBut now you're getting these bumps\nin both sides of the spring and fall.\nWhy would you do that?\nSomething that is beautifully symmetrical\nbeautifully smooth, you're\nputting bumps into it.\n- Well, and we not just\nbeautiful because it's there,\nbut it, but evolved.\nI mean, essentially this\nis the system we evolved\n- Not the seasonality, the most,\neven apart from the exact equator\nevery part on the earth has seasonality."
