    "video_title": "Does Marijuana Disrupt Your Sleep? | Matt Walker & Andrew Huberman",
    "transcript": "- Does marijuana disrupt sleep?\n- Yeah, it does,\nand there's a pretty\ngood amount of data on,\nso we can break cannabis down\ninto two of its key ingredients.\nWe've got THC, tetrahydrocannabinol,\nand we've got CBD, and\nCBD is sort of the less,\nwhat we think of as the\nnon-psychoactive components.\nIn other words, when you\ntake CBD, you don't get high.\nIf you take THC, you can get high.\nThe psychoactive part of the equation.\n- Are both considered sedatives,\nin the technical sense?\n- No, they're not.\nNeither of them have that class right now.\nTHC can, seems to speed up the time\nwith which you fall asleep, but again,\nif you look at the electrical\nbrainwave signature\nof your falling asleep\nwith and without that THC,\nit's not going to be an ideal fit.\nSo, you could argue it's non-natural,\nbut many people use THC for that fact,\nbecause they find it\ndifficult to fall asleep,\nand it can speed the onset of\nat least non-consciousness,\nI guess, is the best way of describing it.\nBut there are problems with\nTHC, and there are two-fold.\nThe first is that it, too,\nbut through different mechanisms,\nseems to block REM sleep,\nand that's why a lot of\npeople, when they're using,\nwill tell me, look, you know,\nI definitely, I was dreaming.\nI don't remember, you\nknow, many of my dreams.\nAnd then, when they stop using THC,\nthey'll say, I was having, you know,\njust crazy, crazy dreams,\nand the reason is because\nthere is a rebound mechanism.\nREM sleep is very clever,\nand alcohol is the same way in this sense.\nIt's the same homeostatic mechanism.\nSome people will tell me,\nlook, if I have a bit\nof a wild Friday night\nwith some alcohol, you know,\nmaybe I'll sleep late\ninto the next morning\nand I'll just have these\nreally intense dreams,\nand I thought I wasn't\nhaving any REM sleep.\nWell, the way it works is that\nit's during in the middle\nof the night, really,\nwhen alcohol blocks your REM sleep,\nand your brain is smart.\nIt understands how much REM\nsleep you should have had,\nhow much REM sleep you have not,\nbecause the alcohol\nhas been in the system,\nand finally, in those early morning hours,\nwhen you're getting through\nto sort of, you know,\nsix, seven, eight a.m.\n- REM like crazy.\n- All of a sudden, your\nbrain not only goes back\nto having the same amount\nof REM it would have had,\nit does that, plus it tries to get back\nall of the REM sleep that it's lost.\nDoes it get back all of the REM sleep?\nNo, it doesn't.\nIt never gets back all of\nthe REM sleep, but it tries.\nAnd so, you have these really\nintense periods of REM sleep.\nhence you have really\nintense, bizarre dreams.\nAnd that's what happens also with THC,\nyou build up this pressure for REM sleep,\nthis debt for REM sleep.\nWill you ever pay it back?\nDoesn't seem as though you get back\neverything that you lost, but\nwill you get back some of it?\nYes, the brain will start to devour more,\nbecause it's been starved\nof REM sleep for so long.\nBut one of the bigger problems with THC\nthat we worry about is\nwithdrawal dependency.\nSo, as you start to use THC for sleep,\nthere can be a dependency tolerance,\nso you start to need more to\nget the same sleep benefit,\nand when you stop using,\nyou usually get a very\nsevere rebound insomnia.\nAnd in fact, it's so potent,\nbut it's typically part of the\nclinical withdrawal profile\nfrom THC, from cannabis.\n- And there's anxiety withdrawal.\nYou know, I don't ask anybody\nto change their behavior.\nWe just, as you had said,\nwe try and inform people\nabout what the science says\nand let them make choices for themselves.\nPeople who are regular pot smokers,\nmany will insist they're not addicted,\nand maybe indeed they\ndon't actually follow\nthe profile of classical addiction.\nI don't know.\nI'm guessing some do some\ndon't, but if you ask them,\nwell, what if I took away all\nmarijuana consumption for,\nI don't know, two weeks?\nThat thought scares many of them,\nand many of them will\nexperience intense anxiety\nwithout marijuana, which speaks\nto perhaps not addiction,\nbut a certain kind of dependency.\nAnd again, you know, I\nknow many pot smokers,\nsome of whom have jobs that\nare quite high-performing\nand they manage.\n- Here in Berkeley, I\ndon't know any of those.\n- Yeah, no, none of those, right?\nWhat about CBD?\nI mean, we hear so much about CBD.\nI've been a little\nconcerned about the fact\nthat the analysis of a lot\nof CBD supplements out there\nhas confirmed that, much\nlike with melatonin,\nthe levels that are reported on the labels\nin no way, shape, or form match the levels\nthat are actually contained\nin the various supplements.\nSometimes the levels are much higher\nthan they're reported on the labels.\nOther times it's much lower.\nWhat does ingesting CBD do\nto the architecture and quality of sleep?\n- Right now, I don't\nthink we have enough data\nto make some kind of, you know,\nmeaningful sense out of it.\nI think the picture that\nis emerging, however,\nis probably the following:\nFirstly, CBD does not\nseem to be detrimental\nin the same ways that THC is,\nso we can start by saying,\ndoes it create, you\nknow, potential problems?\nNot of the nature, necessarily,\nthat we see with THC,\nbut the devil is a\nlittle bit in the details\nfrom the data that we do have,\nand it comes onto your\nvalid point of purity.\nAt low dose, CBD can seem\nto be wake-promoting,\nso in lower doses, let's say\nsort of five or 10 milligrams.\nI'm trying to remember some of the studies\noff the top of my head.\nThere, it actually may enhance wakefulness\nand cause problems with sleep.\nIt's only once you get\ninto the higher dose range\nthat there seem to have been some,\nyou know, increase, sorry,\nincreases in sleepiness or sort\nof sedation-like increases,\nand that's usually, I think,\nabove about 25 milligrams,\nas best I can recall from the data.\nAnd then, when we look in animal models,\nyou typically see the\nsame type of profile, too.\nSo, then, the question\nbecomes, and now again,\nyou just don't know\nabout, you know, purity.\nIt's very difficult, although I think,\nand again, I'm not a user,\nnot necessarily because I\nhave anything against it,\nit's just, that's not, you\nknow, necessarily my cup of tea.\nThere are some firms that are now doing\nthird party independent laboratory tests.\nI don't know how gamed that\nis, so I've got no sense of it.\n- I think some supplement\ncompanies are quite honest\nand accurate about the\namounts of various substances\nthat are in their\nproducts, and some are not.\nAnd I think there's just a huge range.\nI think the FDA is\nstarting to explore CBD.\nCertainly, I saw some grant announcements\nto explore the function of CBD.\nMost of the work on CBD is being\ndone by the general public,\ningesting it and seeing how they feel.\n- Right now, if we were to,\nand I'm not making a statement,\nI don't think anyone could\nmake the statement now,\nbut if it ends up being that CBD\nis potentially beneficial for sleep,\nhow can we reconcile that mechanistically?\nAnd I think there are, to me, at least,\nthere are at least three\ncandidate mechanisms\nthat I have been exploring\nand thinking about.\nThe first is that it's thermoregulatory,\nand what we've found in some\nanimal models is that CBD\nwill create a profile of hypothermia.\nIn other words, it cools the\ncore body temperature down,\nand that's something that\nwe know is good for sleep.\nThe second is that it's an anxiolytic,\nthat it can reduce anxiety,\nand that data is actually quite strong,\neven with some functional imaging work\nthat's been coming out recently,\nshowing that one epicenter of\nemotion called the amygdala\ndeep within the brain is\nquieting down with CBD.\nSo, I think that's at least a\nsecond non-mutually exclusive.\n- That's great,\nthat's interesting.\n- Possibility.\nI think the third is some\nrecent data that's come out\nthat was suggesting that CBD can alter\nthe signaling of adenosine.\nSo, it doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you produce more adenosine,\nbut what it can do is perhaps modulate\nthe sensitivity, perhaps, of the brain,\nso that the weight of that same adenosine\nis weightier in its brain signal,\nand therefore, it creates this\nstronger pressure for sleep.\nSo, I think these are\nall tentative mechanisms.\nI think any one of them is viable.\nI think all three are viable together,\nbut right now, I think,\ndoes that sort of help think through\nthe tapestry of THC and CBD?\n- Yeah, very much so.\nAnd actually, it's a perfect segue from,\nwe've talked about caffeine, alcohol,\nTHC, and CBD as sort of,\nwe framed them anyway,\nas things that, done in moderation\nat the appropriate times,\nare probably okay for most people.\nCertainly not for everybody.\nThere will be differences in sensitivity.\nBut that, done at the incorrect times,\nand certainly in the incorrect amounts,\nwill greatly disrupt this vital\nstage of life we call sleep.\n[upbeat rock music]"
