    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hey,\nBrian, great to see you.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Good\nto see you, Andrew.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Brian\nMackenzie, world expert\nin human performance,\nbreathwork, a.k.a. respiration,\nphysiology,\nand its application\nto things related\nto mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nSo if you're an athlete, a\nstudent, a parent, a teacher,\nor just somebody interested in\nthe use of respiration, a.k.a.\nbreathwork, in order to\nunderstand and regulate\nyour physiology and psychology,\nthe work that Brian does\nis absolutely first\nrate and important,\nI believe, to know about.\nWithout further ado, let's\ntalk about the carbon dioxide\ntolerance test, what it's\ngood for, and how to do it.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Yeah, well, the\ncarbon dioxide tolerance test\nwas something that we created--\nit's our own little HRV.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Heart\nRate Variability.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, heart\nrate variability screen\nwithout using the\ntechnology, be-- keeping us\nas the technology.\nSo ideally the setting is\nyou're either lying down\nor you're sitting up.\nIt's the same thing\nevery time you do it.\nYou don't need to do it\nevery single day, per se.\nBut when you first\nget started with this,\nthat is the best bet and doing\nit the same way each time.\nIf you don't, you're\ngoing to be changing\na number of the variables\nthat could be occurring,\nmuch like you would do with an\nHRV assessment in the morning.\nSo ideally you're sitting or\nrelaxed for a couple of minutes.\nYou're either lying down\nor seated first time\nyou're doing it.\nAnd then what we do\nafter a couple of minutes\nis you would take a full\nInhale through the nose\nand you're going to exhale\nas long and/or as slowly--\nredundant-- as possible\nthrough the nose only.\nThe reason we\ndon't use the mouth\nis because I can\npurse my lips and I\ncan control a lot\nof the variables\nthat we're looking at here.\nOne of those variables\nis a mechanical issue\nthat may be occurring\nwith, let's say,\nthe diaphragm and intercostals\non the eccentric control\nof that exhale and\nthe glottal control.\nThat goes out the door\nif I can purse my lips.\nSo people can actually extend\nthis or prolong it with a mouth\nexhale versus the nose inhale.\nBut you can get good at\nthis with the nose exhale\nand essentially\ndo the same thing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So let\nme make sure I understand.\nSo sit down, relax\nor lie down, relax--\nBRIAN MACKENZIE:\nA couple minutes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--then a big inhale--\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Full inhale.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --lungs\nfull, and then a slow,\ncontrolled exhale--\nwhat you're calling\nthe eccentric portion\nof the breath--\nthrough the nose.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE:\nThrough the nose.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because\ndoing it through the mouth,\nthere are just\ntoo many variables\nrelated to all the things you\nmentioned that can allow someone\nto adjust that duration.\nBut through the nose,\nit's more objective.\nIs that right?\nBRIAN MACKENZIE:\nCorrect, correct.\nAnd, obviously, you're going\nto have a timer with you.\nSo the moment that you hit the\ntop end of your inhale [INHALES]\nthe timer starts and\nyou begin to exhale.\nIf you're questioning\nthe exhale at all.\nThe easiest thing to do is\njust to cover your nostrils\nand you should feel a slight\npressure that's still occurring\ndue to the exhale happening.\nYou can cover the nostrils\nand there will be pressure.\nAnd you can just\nremove them once you\nhave the pressure-- once\nyou feel the pressure\nand continue to exhale.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nbefore we go any further,\nmaybe we just try\nthat first piece.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Go for it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: All right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So when it\nhits that five mark, I'll go.\n[INHALES SHARPLY]\n[EXHALES]\nAll right.\nAll right.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE:\nWhich is actually--\nI mean, your time is pretty\ngood considering the fact\nthat we're sitting here talking.\nYou didn't have time to relax.\nThat's not-- I\nwould not use this.\nEven though you did\nthat right here,\nthat wouldn't be an\naccurate assessment\nof what your morning, let's\ncall it readiness, would be.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So, ideally,\nI'd take that two minutes\nor so rest sitting\nor lying down.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nOK, then do that.\nThe duration there for me\nwas a little over 25 seconds\nor something on the exhale.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I noticed\nthat when I Inhale all the way,\nthe temptation is to hold\nmy breath before I start.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Yes, of course.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But you\nsaid you immediately want\nto reverse into the exhale.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Yeah, you\nwant to start into that exhale.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So at\na very coarse level,\nif somebody has a very\nshort exhale time,\nlet's say the total\nduration for them\nto get to lungs\nempty on that exhale\nis 10 seconds or less,\nversus 20 to 30 seconds,\nversus 60 to 90 seconds--\nwhat general sorts\nof information\nis that giving them about the\nstate of their physiology.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: That's\na really good question.\nBecause what we've\nbeen able to uncover--\nand this-- with the help of\nAndy Galpin and his lab--\nfor the lower\nscoring, that there\nis definitely a lean towards\nmore of a state anxiety.\nNow I say \"state\" for a\nvery important reason.\nThis is not a diagnosis.\nI am not diagnosing anxiety.\nThat is not what-- we're\ntalking on a scale of arousal,\nmy state is probably\na little more anxious,\nso I've probably been a\nlittle more revved up.\nYou just fit into that category.\nUnder 30 seconds is where we\nstart to fit into that category.\nBut that would make sense\nfor somebody who is more--\nhad no practice, no\ncalming down effects.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI've been drinking\na little bit of caffeine.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: You've been\ndrinking a little caffeine.\nWe're ramped up a bit.\nYou didn't have any--\nso having a lower score\nis going to just mean,\nI'm a little bit more ramped up,\nthings going on, sympathetically\nleaning.\nSo I've got more\nsympathetic tone going on.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Some\npeople will hear that\nand they'll think sympathy.\nWe're talking about--\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: No.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --the so-called\nsympathetic arm of the autonomic\nnervous system, which is\nnerd speak for the aspect\nof our nervous system that's\nassociated with alertness\nand arousal as opposed\nto parasympathetic,\nwhich is generally associated\nwith states of more calm--\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --sleep,\nthe so-called rest\nand digest system.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So when we say\nsympathetic-leaning for somebody\nwho has a carbon dioxide\ndiscard rate of 30 seconds\nor less it's that they're\nalert, they're awake.\nIt doesn't necessarily mean\nthey're having an anxiety\nor panic attack.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Correct.\nIf--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThey're just alert.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Yeah, I\nmean, if you're working out,\nyou're not going to\nexhale very long,\nyou've got a lot of buildup\nof a lot of things going\non, including your sympathetic\nnervous system and CO2 because\nof the energy demand\nof what's going on.\nSo, that said, when we--\nwith people who score under that\n30-second mark when applying\nthis assessment, we have them\nstart with more basic protocols.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: So this would\njust simply be more of an equal\nin and out, just working\nthat in and out based off\nof the scoring that\nwas going on with that.\nThen as we get up above\nseconds and move into the 30-\nto 45-second range, that gets\na little bit more difficult\nin ranging.\nSo what we use with\nrhythms starts to change,\nwe go to a more complex rhythm.\nUltimately, as we get\nup into the higher\nranges of the exhale\nassessment or the--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So 60\nseconds, 90 seconds--\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Yeah, yeah.\nGetting up above\nroughly 60, 70 seconds,\nyou're going to see\nyour apnea protocols.\nThese are things that are more\nadvanced protocols and, in fact,\nyou would get into more of\nthe breath hold work per se.\nLet's just say\nstatic apnea work.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So carbon\ndioxide blow off time,\nwhich means it takes X\nnumber of seconds to--\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --go to\ncompletely lungs' empty,\nthe way you described\nbefore, of 30 seconds or less\nis more sympathetic-leaning,\nmeaning more alert,\nmaybe a little bit anxious.\n35 to 45, maybe 60\nseconds, calmer.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Yep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n60 to 90 seconds--\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: You're in\nyour normal range around 45.\nThis is an absolutely\nnormal range with somebody\nwho hasn't tested, who's calm.\nThat is a very normal range.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So 45-second\ndiscard rate would be a good\n\"goal\" for people.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, got it.\nSo if we take a step back and\nwe just look at this test,\nwhat is it good for?\nWhen could one use it?\nI know it has multiple uses.\nIn other words, why\ndo this test in order\nto determine one's\nunderlying physiology?\nIs it, for instance,\npost-exercise\nas a way to determine whether\nor not you've calmed down\nand entered a recovery state.\nI know Dr. Andy Galpin\nis really big on this.\nHe talked about it on\nour podcast and elsewhere\nthat after a hard\nworkout, it's a great idea\nto do three to five minutes\nof downregulation breathing,\nexhale-- emphasize breathing\nor something to down regulate\nmeditation-- just\nsomething to calm down,\nenter the recovery phase.\nI suppose one could then do\nthe carbon dioxide tolerance\ntest at the end of that to\ndetermine whether or not\nthey are, in fact, calm.\nWould that be one potential use?\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Yeah, you\ncould implement it there.\nThe easier thing\nwould just knowing--\nyou're going to see a very--\nyou're going to see a\nmuch shorter assessment.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\npeople should be aware.\nWhat about on waking,\nwhen people wake up\nfirst thing in the morning?\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIs it a good idea\nto do it in bed in the morning?\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: I\nwouldn't say in bed.\nI would say give it 15 minutes,\nget out of bed, do a few things,\ngo to the restroom, get some\nwater in you, then go lie down,\ngo-- or go sit down, chill\nout for a couple of minutes,\nthen do it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: When else\nhave you applied this,\nlike when you teach\nit to athletes,\nmilitary, CEOs, high performers?\nIs it something to do\nbefore they go out on stage?\nSomething to do mid-competition?\nWhat are some\nother applications?\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: I usually--\nso what I do-- the\napplication I use it\nfor is to identify\nbreathing protocols where\nthat individual's at.\nOnce we get good at this,\nonce we have a rhythm\nand where I can see a baseline\nis, I stop doing it every day.\nWe then apply it maybe weekly\nor even monthly based on--\nI give them breathing\nprotocols based\non that assessment for\nthe general population,\nfor everybody.\nThere-- obviously,\nwe've got rhythms\nthat are associated with\nthat and a calculator\nthat people can input to\nactually get those rhythms\nand to apply those rhythms for\nroughly three to five minutes,\nwhatever.\nAfter their--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Hey, Dozer.\nBrian's dog, Dozer,\nhas got a giant--\nhe's got a giant head and he's\na beauty, goodness gracious.\nHe's got-- his head's as\neasily as big as Costello's.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE:\nOh, yeah, he's--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, so\nhe's a nasal breather.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Down.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: If you\nnotice, he's a calm dog.\nAt this point.\nIt's clear what the carbon\ndioxide tolerance test is\nand that the number that you\nget consistently over time,\nsay, in the morning and--\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: It's important.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds\nlike it's a good idea\nto do it in the evening too.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Let's\napply a scientific method\nto your own world here.\nAnd this is easy\nfor people to do\nbecause we've got all the\ninformation up that they can\nactually input and\ngo, oh, I've got\na different protocol in the\nevening than I do at night.\nOh, and I'm also very\ndifferent after training.\nSo just using this assessment\ngives you an actual time frame\nfor what's happening.\nAnd we've collected and\nhad enough information\nto understand where you\nwould fit inside of a sche--\nthe schema of, hey,\nwhether I'm up-- ramped up,\nsympathetic or I'm actually\nmore parasympathetic, charged--\nor downregulated, I should say.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I've\nfound the carbon dioxide\ntolerance test is just\nto be a great available,\nanytime measure\nof internal state.\nAnd by doing it in\nthe morning and now\nit sounds like I should\nalso do it in the evening.\nInteresting.\nIt's-- I mean only-- the whole\nthing only takes three minutes\ntotal.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd you can just\nnote the number in your\nmind, or write it down,\nput it in your phone.\nIt gives you this\nbaseline evaluation\nof how you're progressing\nthrough life in terms\nof managing your internal state.\nSo thank you for explaining\ncarbon dioxide tolerance test.\nBRIAN MACKENZIE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nGive it a try, folks.\nIt's very informative.\nIt takes only about\nthree minutes, zero cost,\nvery easy to do.\nYou'll get interesting\ninformation\nabout your particular\nphysiological state\nat that time.\nBut if you do it a few\ntimes consistently,\nyou'll get really\ninteresting information.\nAnd Brian McKenzie\nand colleagues\nhave developed a terrific\nzero-cost website.\nIt's shiftadapt.com/breathwork,\nwhere you can take your carbon\ndioxide tolerance time, you\nenter it into a table there,\nand it will give you really\nuseful information about certain\nbreathwork protocols and how\nto do them specifically--\nthe duration of inhales,\nbreath holds, and exhales.\nAgain, that's\ncompletely zero-cost,\nso a terrific resource.\nThank you, Brian, for\nproviding that resource\nshiftadapt.com/breathwork\nis where you can plug\nin your carbon dioxide tolerance\ntest results and apply those\nto improve any aspects of your\nmental health, physical health,\nor performance that\nyou're interested in."
