    "transcript": "- How does caffeine work\nto make us feel more alert?\nAnd does the timing in\nwhich we ingest caffeine\nplay an important role\nin whether or not it works\nfor us or against us?\nSo maybe we just start with,\nhow does caffeine work?\nWhy is it that when I\ndrink mate or coffee,\nwhich are my preferred\nsources of caffeine,\ndo I feel a mental and physical lift?\n- Yeah, so I'm going to suggest,\ncounter to what most people\nwould think, drink coffee.\n- Or mate, is mate okay also?\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n- Or whatever form you enjoy.\n- We'll come onto sort\nof why I suggest that,\nbut when it comes to coffee,\nI would say the dose and\nthe timing makes the poison.\nSo let's start with how caffeine works.\nCaffeine is in a class of drugs\nthat we call the psychoactive stimulants.\nSo it works through a\nvariety of mechanisms.\nOne is a dopamine mechanism,\ndopamine we often think\nof as a reward chemical.\nBut dopamine is also very much\nan alerting neurochemical as well.\nAnd caffeine has some role it seems,\nto play in increasing dopamine.\nBut its principal mode\nof action, we believe,\nin terms of making me more alert\nand keeping me awake throughout the day,\nis on the effects of adenosine.\nAnd to explain what adenosine is,\nfrom the moment that you\nand I woke up this morning,\nthis chemical adenosine has\nbeen building up in our brain.\nAnd the longer that we're awake,\nthe more of that adenosine accumulates.\n- Where is this adenosine coming from\nand where is it accumulating?\n- Yeah, so the adenosine\nhere that we're talking about\nthat is creating the sleep pressure\nis a central brain phenomenon.\nAnd it comes from the neurons\nthemselves combusting energy.\nAnd as they're combusting energy,\none of the offshoots of that\nis this chemical adenosine.\nAnd so, as we're awake throughout the day\nand our brain is\nmetabolically very active,\nit's accumulating and\nbuilding up this adenosine.\nNow, the more adenosine that we have,\nthe sleepier that we will feel.\nSo it really is like, a sleep\npressure is what we call it.\nNow, it's not a mechanical pressure,\ndon't worry, your head's\nnot going to explode,\nit's a chemical pressure.\nAnd it's this weight of sleepiness\nthat we feel gradually growing\nas we get into the evening.\n- May I just interrupt\nyou again to just ask,\ndo we know what the circuit\nmechanism is for that?\nI mean, not to go too\nfar down the rabbit hole,\nbut for the aficionados and for myself,\nwe have brain mechanisms\nlike locus coeruleus\nthat release things, our brain areas,\nlocus coeruleus just being\na brain area, of course,\nthat release things that\nproactively create wakefulness.\nSo are those neurons shutting\ndown as a consequence\nof having too much adenosine\nor are there areas of the brain\nthat promote sleepiness\nthat are becoming activated?\nBecause you can imagine both\nthings working in parallel,\none or the other would\naccomplish the same end point.\n- Yeah, and it's both.\nAnd so there are two main\nreceptors for adenosine,\nthe A1 receptor and the A2 receptor,\nand they have different modes\nof activating brain cells\nor inactivating or decreasing\nthe likelihood of firing.\nAnd adenosine works in\nthis beautiful, elegant way\nwhere it will inhibit and shut down\nthe wake promoting areas of the brain\nwhilst also increasing\nin dialing up the volume\non sleep activating,\nsleep promoting brain-\n- Biology's so beautiful.\n- Oh, it's fantastic.\n- It's always a push-pull.\nSo this is another example\nwhere as I am awake longer,\nadenosine is released in the brain\nand my wakefulness areas\nare being actively shut down\nby that adenosine and my\nsleepiness brain areas,\nso to speak, are being\npromoted to be more active,\nis that correct?\n- That's right, and it's a\nvery progressive process.\nIt's not like a step function where,\nand sometimes that happens occasionally,\nbut it's usually because you've\nbeen sort of driving through\nand as we'll come on to,\nhave caffeine in the system,\nand then all of a sudden\nyou just hit a wall\nand it just engulfs you\nand you go from a zero\nto a one of sleepiness within\na short period of time.\nCaffeine comes into play here\nbecause caffeine comes into your system\nand it latches onto those\nwelcome sites of adenosine,\nthe adenosine receptors.\nBut what it doesn't do is latch\nonto them and activate them\nbecause if it was doing\nthat, then it would,\nin lots of ways, it would dial\nup more sort of sleepiness.\nIt does the opposite.\nThe way that caffeine\nworks is that it comes in,\ncompetes with quite sharp\nelbows with adenosine,\ncompetitively forces them out of the way,\nhijacks that receptor by latching onto it,\nbut then just essentially blocks it.\nIt doesn't inactivate the receptor,\nit doesn't activate the receptor.\nIt functionally\ninactivates it in the sense\nthat it takes it out of\nthe game for adenosine.\nSo it's like someone coming into a room\nand you're just about\nto sit down on the chair\nand caffeine comes in and\njust pulls out the chair\nand you're like, well, now\nI've got nowhere to sit.\nAnd caffeine just keeps\npulling out the chairs\nfrom adenosine,\nand adenosine, even though\nit's at the same concentration\nin your brain, your brain doesn't know\nthat you've been awake\nfor 10 hours, 16 hours,\nat that point when you've\ndowned a cup of coffee,\nbecause all of that\nadenosine that's still there\ncan't communicate to the brain\nthat you've been awake for 16 hours.\n- But the adenosine is\nstill in brain circulation.\n- Correct.\n- So the real question is,\nwhat happens when caffeine is dislodged\nfrom the adenosine receptor?\n- Unfortunate things happen,\nand that's what we call\nthe caffeine crash,\nwhich is caffeine has a\nhalf-life and it's metabolized.\n- Do you recall what the half-life is?\n- Yeah, the half-life is somewhere between\nfive to six hours.\nAnd the quarter-life therefore\nis somewhere between 10 to 12 hours.\nIt's variable, different\npeople have different durations\nof its action.\nBut for the average\nadult, five to six hours.\nThat variation, we understand,\nit's down to a liver enzyme\nor a set of liver enzymes\nof the class that we call\nthe cytochrome P450 enzymes.\nAnd there are, I think,\nlast I delved into the data,\nwhich is pretty recently,\nthere are two gene variants\nthat will dictate the enzymatic speed\nwith which the liver breaks down caffeine.\nAnd that's why you can have some people\nwho are very sensitive to caffeine\nand other people who say, you know,\nit just doesn't affect me\nreally that much at all.\n- These are the people\nthat have a double espresso\nafter a 9:00 PM dinner\nand can sleep just fine.\n- Well, and we'll come on to-\n- Or at least, subjectively,\nthey think they're sleeping just fine.\n- Subjectively, yeah, and\nwe should speak about that,\nthat assumptive danger too.\nSo then the caffeine is in the system\nand after some time period,\nit will be inactive in the system.\nSo let's say that I've\nbeen awake for 12 hours now\nand it's 8:00 PM and\nI'm feeling a bit tired,\nbut I want to push through\nand I want to keep working\nfor another couple of hours.\nSo I have a cup of coffee.\nAll of a sudden, I was feeling tired,\nbut I don't feel like I've\nbeen awake for 12 hours anymore\nbecause with the caffeine in the system,\nmay be only half of that\nadenosine is being communicated\nthrough the receptor to my brain.\n100% of the adenosine is still there,\nonly half of it is allowed\nto communicate to my brain.\nSo now I think, oh, I haven't\nbeen awake for 12 hours,\nI've just being awake for\nsix hours, and feel great.\nThen, after a few hours\nand the caffeine is starting\nto come out of my system,\nnot only am I hit with the\nsame levels of adenosine\nthat I had before I'd\nhad the cup of coffee\nseveral hours ago,\nit's that, plus all of the\nadenosine that's been building up\nduring the time that the\ncaffeine has been in my system.\n- So it's sort of an\navalanche of adenosine.\n- It is a tsunami wave, yeah,\nand that's the caffeine crash.\n- And it's interesting\nbecause the caffeine crash\nat two o'clock in the afternoon\nwhen you have work to do\nis a terrible thing, but\nwhat about the person,\nmaybe this person is me in my 20s,\nwho says, I'm going to\ndrink caffeine all day long,\nand then I want the crash\nbecause at 9:00 or 10:00 PM,\nif I stop drinking caffeine\nat say, 6:00 PM, and I crash,\nthen I crash into a slumber,\na deep night of sleep.\nIs that sleep really as\ndeep as I think it is\nbecause given the half-life of caffeine\nthat you mentioned a few moments ago,\nI have to imagine that\nhaving some of that caffeine\ncirculating in my system might\ndisrupt the depth of sleep\nor somehow the architecture\nof sleep in a way,\nthat even if I get eight\nor who knows, even 10 hours of sleep,\nit might not be as restorative\nas I would like it to be.\n- Yeah, and that is the danger.\nJust sort of that, those\npeople that you described,\nwho say, and a lot of them\nwill speak with me too,\nsay, look, I can have\ntwo espressos with dinner\nand I fall asleep fine, and I stay asleep\nbecause usually those\nare the two phenotypes\nthat we typically see\nwith too much caffeine.\nI just can't fall asleep\nas easily as I want to,\nor I fall asleep, but I\njust can't stay asleep,\nand caffeine can do both of\nthose things quite potently.\n- How late in the day do you\nthink is, assuming somebody,\ntranslate this folks, if you\ngo to bed earlier or later,\nyou have to shift the hours accordingly.\nBut given somebody who\ntypically gets into bed\naround 10:00, 10:30, and falls\nasleep around 11:00, 11:30,\nwhen would you recommend\nthey halt caffeine intake?\nAnd these are not strict prescriptives,\nbut I think people do benefit from having\nsome fairly clear guidelines\nof what might work for them.\nWould you say cutoff caffeine\nby, what time of the day?\n- I would usually say\ntake your typical bedtime\nand count back sort of\nsomewhere between 10 to,\neight hours is probably\ngetting a little bit close,\nbut take back sort of 10\nhours or eight hours of time,\nthat's the time when\nyou should really stop\nusing caffeine is the suggestion.\nAnd the reason is because for those people\nwho even just keep drinking\nup until into the evening,\nyou're right that they\ncan fall asleep fine,\nmaybe they stay asleep,\nbut the depth of their deep\nsleep is not as deep anymore.\nAnd so there are two consequences.\nThe first is that for me,\nand it can be up to by 30%.\nAnd for me to drop your deep sleep by 30%,\nI'd have to age you by\nbetween 10 to 12 years,\nor you can just do it\nevery night to yourself\nwith a couple of espressos.\nThe second is that you then\nwake up the next morning\nand you think, well, I didn't\nhave problems falling asleep\nand I didn't have problems staying asleep,\nbut I don't feel particularly\nrestored by my sleep.\nSo now I'm reaching for\nthree or four cups of coffee\nthe next morning,\nrather than just two or\nthree cups of coffee,\nand so goes this dependency cycle\nthat you then need your uppers\nto wake you up in the morning.\nAnd then sometimes people will\nuse alcohol in the evening\nto bring them down because\nthey're overly caffeinated.\nAnd alcohol, and we can\nspeak about that too,\nalso has very deleterious\nimpacts on your sleep as well.\n[light guitar music]"
