    "transcript": "Tell me what you think of this,\nwhat I always call, protocol,\nif I want to learn something\nfrom a manuscript I\nread or a book chapter,\nI used to highlight things.\nAnd I had a very elaborate,\nextracted from my university days,\nsystem of stars and\nexclamation marks and underline\nthat mean a lot to me,\nthat, yes, bring me\nback to a given segment\nwithin the chapter.\nBut a few years ago,\nI was teaching a course\nin the biology department at Stanford,\nand for some reason,\nwe had them read a study\nabout information retention.\nAnd I learned from that study\nthat one of the best things we can do\nis read information, in whatever form,\na magazine, research\narticle, et cetera, a book,\nand then to take some time\naway from that material,\nmaybe walk,\nmaybe close one's eyes,\nmaybe leave them open, doesn't matter,\nand just try and remember\nspecific elements.\nHow much does one remember?\nThen go back to the\nmaterial and look at it.\nAnd I've just been positively astonished\nat how much more information I can learn\nwhen I'm not simply going\nthrough motor commands\nof just underlining things\nand highlighting them,\nbut stepping away and thinking,\n\"Okay, yeah, oh, I don't remember\nhow many subjects there were.\nI'll go back and check that,\nmaybe make a note.\nAnd okay, they did this,\nthen they did that, and then,\"\nand then it's crystallized.\nAnd as I say this, I realize,\nof course this should work,\n[laughing] this is the\nway that the brain learns.\nBut somehow, that's not the way\nwe are taught to learn.\nYeah, well, I'm smiling\nbecause when I was 22,\nI wrote this book\ncalled \"How to Become a\nStraight-A Student,\" right?\nAnd the whole premise of the book was,\n\"I'm going to talk to\nactual college students\nwho have straight A's\nand who don't seem\ncompletely ground out, right?\nLike, not burnt out.\nAnd I'm just going to\ninterview 'em, right?\"\nAnd the protocol was,\n\"How did you study for the\nlast test that you studied for?\nHow did you take notes for the last?\"\nSo I was just asking them\nto walk through their methodology.\nThe core idea of that book\nwas active recall.\nThat was the core idea,\nthat replicating ideas,\nwhat I used to say is,\n\"Replicating the information from scratch\nas if teaching a class without\nlooking at your notes.\"\nThat is the only way to learn.\nAnd the thing about it was,\nit's a trade off.\nit's efficient, doesn't take much time,\nbut it's incredibly\nmentally taxing, right?\nThis is why students often avoid it.\nIt is difficult to sit there\nand try to replicate and pull forth,\n\"Okay, what did I read here?\nHow did that work?\"\nIt's mentally very taxing,\nbut it's very time efficient, right?\nIf you're willing to\nessentially put up with that,\nwith that pain,\nyou learn very quickly.\nAnd not only do you learn very quickly,\nyou don't forget.\nIt's almost like you have a\npseudo-photographic memory\nwhen you study this way.\nYou sit down to do a test\nand you're replicating\nwhole lines [laughing]\nfrom what you studied,\nthe ideas sort of come out fully formed\nbecause it's such a fantastic\nway to actually learn.\nIt was my key, the whole premise\nthat got me writing that book\nis I went through this period\nas a college student\nwhere I came in freshman year,\nwas a fine student,\nnot a great student, but a fine student.\nI was rowing crew and I was\nsort of excited to do that.\nAnd then I developed a heart condition,\nand had to stop.\nCongenital wiring in the heart,\natrial flutter thing.\nIt meant I couldn't row crew anymore.\nSo a prolapse of some sort?\nIt was a circuitry issue\nthat would lead to a\nextremely rapid heartbeat.\nIt's like really rapid,\nlike tachycardia, right?\nYou get 200-250 beats a minute just,\nand it could be exercise induced, right?\nWhich is not optimal,\nyou could take beta blockers,\nwhich would moderate\nthe electrical timing,\nbut beta blockers reduce\nyour max heart rate.\nAnd if you're a athlete\nwhere the entire thing that matters\nis your max heart rate,\nso you're doing something\nlike a 2,000-meter rows,\nyour performance on beta\nblockers just goes down.\nIt makes no sense, it's like\nbeing a basketball player\nthat wears weighted shoes,\nit's too frustrating.\nRight, and it also makes you super mellow.\nI was a pretty mellow guy.\n[both laughing]\nBut I was a worst rower.\nSo I stopped that, and I was like,\n\"Okay, I want to get\nserious about my studies.\"\nI said, \"I can get\nserious about my studies\nand writing,\" right?\nThat's when I actually made the decisions\nthat I then stuck with for\nthe next 25 years after that.\nBut one of the things I did to\nget serious about my studies\nis I said, \"I'm going to\nsystematically experiment\nwith how to study for tests\nand how to write papers.\"\nAnd I would try this, \"How did it go?\"\ndeconstruct experiment.\nTry this, \"How'd it go?\"\ndeconstruct experiment.\nAnd active recall was the thing\nthat turned me all around.\nAnd so I went from a pretty good student\nto 4.0 every single quarter,\nSophomore year, junior year, senior year.\nI got one A minus\n[laughing] between my sophomore\nyear through my senior year.\nIt was like this\nmiraculous transformation.\nIt was active recall.\nI rebuilt all of my studying,\nso if it was for a humanities class,\nI had a whole way of taking notes\nthat was all built around\ndoing active recall.\nFor math classes,\nmy main study tool was\na stack of white paper.\n\"All right, do this proof,\"\nwhite piece of paper,\nand just, \"Can I do it from scratch?\"\nIf I could, I know that technique.\nIf I don't, \"All right,\nI'm going to come back\nand try it again later.\"`\nCompletely transformed.\nI did so well academically,\nthat's why I ended up writing that book\nthat basically spread that\nmessage to other people.\nSo I'm a huge advocate for active recall.\nIt's really hard,\nbut it is the way to learn new things.\nAnd as you pointed out,\nit is very time efficient.\nOh yeah.\nYeah.\nI mean, it was a problem,\nit was a social problem for me\nthat I would have to pretend\n[laughing] during finals period\nthat I was going to the library to study\nbecause I would be done studying.\nThis active recall, it's brutal,\nbut it's incredibly efficient.\nYou sit down there,\nI would have my cards\nand I would mark it,\n\"Okay, I struggled with this,\"\nI'd put it in this pile,\n\"I got it done,\" I'd put it in this pile.\nAnd so then you would just go back to the,\n\"I struggled with it,\" pile,\nand work on that.\nAnd then make a new, \"I\nstruggled with it,\" pile.\nAnd these would exponentially decay.\nAnd so in a few hours,\nyou could really master,\nwith a few other tricks that worked,\nyou could really master the\nmaterial pretty quickly.\nAnd then, what am I supposed to do?\nI didn't do all-nighters.\nIt wouldn't make any sense.\nActive recall is how you prepare,\nand it's going to take four hours\nand it's going to be tough,\nso do it in the morning\nwhen you have energy,\nand then you're done.\nI love it.\nI learned essentially all of neuroanatomy\nlooking down the microscope\nat tissue samples.\nAnd then I would try and take\nphotographs with my eyes,\nI do not have a photographic memory.\nBut then I would get home in the evening,\nlook through the neuroanatomy textbook,\nlie down,\nand try and fly through the\ndifferent circuits in my mind.\nAnd then if I arrived at\na structure in the brain\nthat I couldn't identify,\nI would then go check my notes\nand go back.\nAh, that's perfect.\nSo basically, I learned neuroanatomy,\nwhich I'm poor at a great\nmany things in life,\nbut neuroanatomy, I'm solid at,\nand then some, if I may say so.\nAnd it's because there's a mental map,\nand you can kind of move through it,\nfly through it dynamically.\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat you
