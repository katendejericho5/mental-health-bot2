    "transcript": "Recently, my podcast team was in Australia\nand my producer and close\nfriend here, Rob Mohr,\ninstructed all of us\nto get rid of social media on our phones,\nexcept one guy who would post\nour weekly episodes announcements.\nAnd it was pretty brutal at first.\nAnd then coming back to social media\nhas actually turned out\nto be more challenging.\nHuh.\nAnd you really experienced\nthe friction coming back the other way.\nAnd then one experiences\nthe lack of friction,\nand that's where it gets scary.\nIt's so interesting the way\nthat the brain can adapt,\nthe friction leaving something behind,\nthe friction coming back to it.\nAnd I think for people listening to this,\nI raise this because, I think, of course,\nmany people listening are, you know,\nhave work that they\nreally need to focus on.\nThey may be having\nissues with productivity\nand burnout, et cetera.\nI think a lot of people use\nthe phone and social media\nbecause it fills their life, you know?\nIt provides some enrichment\nand they aren't necessarily\ncommitted to specific projects.\nBut I guess through the lens of the,\nlet's just call it the\nCal Newportian lens,\none might argue that those\npeople almost certainly\nhave untapped creativity,\nuntapped resources within them\nthat they don't yet know about\nbecause they're essentially\nusing that energy elsewhere.\nYeah, I mean, I think for a lot of people,\nit's papering over the void, right?\nYou have this void in your life\nbecause there's unmet\npotential, unmet interest,\nliving in misalignment\nwith the things you care about, right?\nI mean, a lot of people,\nthis is the classic sort\nof catastrophe of life, right?\nSocial media, and before this,\nit was other things, right,\nthere was other intoxicants or\nother sorts of distractions.\nIt's a way for some\npeople of, essentially,\nputting a screen over\nthat like gaping void.\nAnd it like, just makes it bearable enough\nthat you can kind of go on with life.\nAnd so it is true, if you just\nrip it out, you see the void.\nAnd that's really difficult, right?\nI mean, 'cause I did this\nexperiment for one of my books.\nI ran an experiment with 1,600 people\nand they all turned off all\ntheir social media for 30 days.\n30 days.\n30 days, right?\nThese are young people, old people?\nA whole mix, a whole mix, right?\nSo not just university students.\nI recruited them from my\nnewsletter readership,\nso they weren't university students.\nAnd it wasn't formal\nresearch, it was, you know,\nI put out the call, right?\nSo this is not randomly sampled, right?\nBut I put out the call and I said,\n\"Here, I'm going to\nwalk you through this.\"\nAnd then I got a lot of information back.\nSo people reported back how it went.\nAnd this was like, the\nnumber one thing I heard was,\nit's really hard at first, right?\nAnd so, who are the people that succeeded\nfor 30 days versus those who didn't?\nThe ones who didn't succeed,\ntended to just try to white knuckle it,\njust be like, \"I don't like how\nmuch I'm using social media,\nI'm just going to stop because it's bad\nand I don't want to do a bad thing.\nI'm just going to like, you know,\nhold onto the table with white knuckles.\"\nThey wouldn't make it 30 days.\nThe people who did\nsucceed followed my advice\nto incredibly, aggressively\npursue alternatives\nin those 30 days.\nSo it's like, go learn new\nhobbies, join things right away,\nget like really structured about your day,\nget into exercise again,\nlearn how to knit again.\nA lot of people said,\n\"Oh, I forgot how fun libraries were.\nLike, you can go into\nthis building and like,\nall the books are free and\nyou could just grab whatever.\nAnd it's okay if you don't like the book\nbecause you didn't have to pay for it.\nI'm going out with friends again.\nOkay, every week I'm\ngoing to have, you know,\nwe're going to have\ndrinks with this person\nand every Thursday morning I'm\ngoing to go running with this person.\"\nThe people who aggressively tried\nto put in place a more\npositive alternative\nthrough self-reflection experimentation,\nthey lasted the 30 days and beyond, right?\nAnd so then I came to realize like, oh,\nI see what's happening here\nis you have these unmet needs.\nThese tools can give you sort of\na simulacrum of meeting them.\nI'm a social being, I need\nto be connected to people.\nWell, I'm texting and like\ndoing comments on social media,\nit sort of touches that a little bit,\njust enough that you don't\nfeel hopelessly lonely,\nbut it's not really fulfilling that.\nI have a need to, like,\nsee my intentions made manifest\nconcretely in the world,\nhumans want to do this.\nWell, I'm, you know, posting these things\nand people are responding,\nit's sort of this\nsimulacrum of real creation.\nSo it's like kind of\nsatisfying that just enough\nthat it's not just intolerable, right?\nAnd so what happens is if you remove that,\nyou have to actually fill\nthose things the right way.\nSo now I'm not socializing\non social media,\nbut I'm going out of my\nway to sacrifice time\nand attention on behalf of other people.\nI'm feeling the social\nvoid in the right way,\nnow I don't really feel\nlike I need to go back.\nI'm actually making my\nintentions manifest,\nI'm learning skills and building things.\nNow this sort of pseudo construction\nand collective attention\neconomy of social media,\nI'll post this and you'll\nlike it, I don't like this,\nI don't need that anymore\nto fill that void.\nSo it's like you have\nto fill the void first.\nSo, you know, five years\nago I wrote a book,\nit was about reforming\nthis part of your life.\nAnd a lot of the book had\nnothing to do with technology,\nbut about how to actually just\nrebuild parts of your life.\nAnd on my podcast, honestly, like one\nof the big topics we talk about,\nwhich is crazy that I'm a\ntechnologist and I write\nabout trying to find focus\nin a distracted world,\nis this thing we call the deep life,\nwhich is just straight up\nbuilding a meaningful life 101.\nAnd it's like crazy that my\npodcast is talking about it,\nbut on the other hand, it's not,\nbecause mine is the podcast people go to\nwhen they're fed up\nwith the digital world.\nAnd it turns out if you don't get\nthe analog world working right for you,\nyou need something to\navoid staring to that void,\nand the digital world\nwill do that well enough.\nIt's like just good enough\nto keep life tolerable.\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf
