    "transcript": "In terms of deep work and\ngetting a little bit back\nto kind of practical\nsteps towards deep work,\nYeah.\nI also have to ask you,\n'cause I didn't earlier,\nwhen you are on your laptop\nin your library with your\nfireplace and these books,\nit's a beautiful image actually\nthat you've drawn for us in our minds.\nIs the wifi connection to\nyour computer activated\nor are you offline?\nIt's connected because it\ndoesn't really matter to me,\nyou know, because what's\ndrawing my attention?\nI mean, the most\nimportant decision I think\nI made, technically speaking, to be\na cognitive worker is\nthe lack of social media.\nLike I think we underestimate\nthe degree to which\nour problem with digital distraction\nis not the internet, it's not our phones.\nIt is specific products and services\nthat are engineered at great\nexpense to pull you back to 'em\nWhen you take that away, the Internet's\nnot that interesting, like I don't have\na cycle of sites to go to, you know,\nI can check my email,\nbut I don't really know\nwhere else to go, I mean, I could go\nto the New York Times, I guess,\nbut then you've seen the articles, right?\nThey change it once a day,\nthere's just not much...\nI've set things up, so there's not much\nthat's that interesting to me.\nWe've all heard of FOMO,\nfear of missing out.\nI feel like there's the other thing\nwhich is fear of missing\nsomething bad, right?\nThere's sort of like an anxiety,\na more primitive anxiety within us\nthat if we are not engaged on social media\nor looking at our phone\noften or texting often,\nthat it's not that we'll miss the party,\nwe'll miss the emergency.\nYou don't seem to suffer from\nthose kind of everyday ills.\nYeah, I mean, it doesn't happen that much.\nI mean, I have a phone, you know,\nA standard...\nNo, I mean, I have my phone,\nI guess if I'm working away from it,\nyeah, I guess it's true,\nif there's an emergency.\nBut this was the case for\na very long time, right?\nWe didn't have smartphones 'til\nreally relatively recently.\nThis is, you know, 15 years ago.\nSo we were just used to\nthis until yesterday,\nessentially, that there's\njust periods of time\nwhere you're out of touch.\nLike you're at a restaurant with someone,\nyou're out of touch until\nyou get back to your office.\nLike we were okay, you\nknow, we weren't plagued\nby emergencies that that\nled to disastrous results\nbecause we couldn't hear\nabout it right then.\nYou go to the movies like,\nyou're out of touch, right?\nAnd it'd be a couple hours\n'til you were in touch again.\nAnd so, you know, it's not something\nthat's affected me as much.\nSo maybe I'm working\nwithout my phone nearby,\na lot of people have this response,\nthey begin sort of catastrophizing,\nlike, what if this\nhappens or this or that.\nAnd I'm thinking, you know, I survived,\nbefore that my parents\nsurvived without that,\nmy grandparents survived without that.\nI don't worry about it as much, you know.\nAnd some of this maybe is just,\nthis doesn't upset people\nas as much as it used to,\nthe fact I don't use a lot of\nthese apps or have my phone,\nbut it really does upset people, right?\nThere's, well, what about\nthis, what about that,\nwhat about this, and I\ndon't know how much of this\nis just maybe I'm oblivious\nand how much of this\nis people back sliding explanation\nfor why they do need their phone,\nwhy they do need to\nlook at it all the time.\nBut I get a lot of it.\nYeah, well maybe they're\nupset and you don't know\nbecause you're not looking at your phone.\nThat's right, hey, I'll tell you what,\nthat's a blessing not knowing\nhow upset people are at you.\nYeah, it's a blessing\nas a semi-public figure,\nI'll tell you that.\nOh yeah, I can comment\non that, but I won't.\nI am on social media and I do enjoy it.\nI sort of got started posting on Instagram\nand then expanded to other platforms,\nincluding the podcast,\nbut there's a threshold\nbeyond which it becomes counterproductive,\nfor sure.\nYeah.\nI think there's information there that...\nLike questions that people\nask are often informative.\nIt's sort of like ending a class\nand asking are there any questions?\nSometimes the comments\nthat people bring back\nare truly informative towards both\nwhere they might have\nsome misunderstanding,\nbut also sometimes some\nreally terrific ideas.\nYeah.\nSo there's that.\nBut I completely agree that\nthis is a very precarious space.\nAnd I'll just relay a quick anecdote.\nYears ago I gave a quick lecture down\nat Santa Clara University,\nsouth of Stanford,\nand I was talking about this issue,\nI recommended your book, and\na student came up afterwards\nand he said, \"You don't get it.\"\nAt that time, I was in my early 40s.\nHe said, \"You don't get it, you know,\n\"you grew up without social media...\"\nYeah.\n\"And the phone,\n\"and so you've adopted it into your life.\n\"But we grew up with\nit and when my phone,\"\nhe's speaking for himself\nin the first person.\n\"When my phone loses power,\n\"I feel a physical drain within my body.\n\"And when it comes back on, I\nfeel a lift within my body.\"\nSo I'd love your thoughts on whether\nor not you think the phone\nand, perhaps, social media as well are\nin some ways an extension of our brain,\nit's almost like another cortical area,\nthat contains all this information.\nIt's a version of us, this\ngets into notions of AI\nthat we can talk about as well.\nI know you're involved in\nAI and writing about AI.\nBut, you know, to me,\nwhen the phone is used\nin that way, it really is almost like\na piece of neural machinery of sorts.\nYeah, I mean, there's two\nways of looking at it.\nYeah so there is the sort of\ncyborg image, I suppose, right?\nLike you're extending,\nyou're plugging into\nthis neuro sphere like you have\nthis sort of digital network extension\nof information and what's going on.\nThere's also the much\nmore pessimistic view,\nwhich is, you know, that\nfeeling is the feeling\nof a moderate behavioral addiction, right?\nSo you'll hear the same\nthing from a gambler,\n\"When I'm away from being\nable to play, right,\n\"to make my bets or do whatever,\n\"like I feel not myself and then,\n\"when I'm around it and I can play\n\"and make some bets, play\nsome poker, whatever it is...\"\nThe feeling of the chips.\n\"I feel myself,\" that chips,\nright, like they would say.\nSo both of these things could be true.\nI think the moderate\nbehavioral addiction side\nis more true than a lot of\nus want to admit, actually.\nLike it does feel bad because\nmoderate behavioral addictions\nbuild these feedback response loops,\nand then you get the dopamine\nsystem going, anticipation,\nbecause what's on there is things\nthat have been engineered\nthat you're going to get\nthis sort of highly engaging stimuli.\nAnd then you see the deliverance\nof that stimuli, right?\nThis really nice piece of\nglass on a piece of metal.\nI'm going to press this sort of carefully,\nthis icon whose colors have been chosen\nbecause we know it's\ngoing to hit various parts\nof our neural alert systems\nto be as engaging as possible.\nAnd I'm going to see something in there\nthat's going to generate some\nsort of emotional response.\nSo of course, when you see\nthat thing sitting there,\nyou want to use it and when you can't,\nit's a stymied dopamine response.\nYou're like, \"This is not\ngood, I'm uncomfortable.\"\nAnd I think that's a\nbig part of it as well,\nbecause, you know, I've had\nthis argument with some people.\nAnd, by the way, I see both sides of this.\nLike there are great advantages\nto what people are doing with these tools.\nIt's just that it's all mixed up\nwith all these disadvantages\nand it becomes very difficult.\nIt's like the alcohol in the\nneighborhood bar's too potent,\nyou know, and people are\ngoing there to socialize\nand they're coming home at\nthree in the morning, you know,\npassing out, you know, it's\nlike the balance is off.\nNot that there's not something good there,\nbut the balance is off so it\nbecomes pretty difficult to navigate.\nSo I think some of that's what's going on,\nespecially with the younger generation\nthat was raised on it\nwhich is why, by the way,\nI think the cultural norms are\ngoing to change around this.\nI think we're going to think\nabout unrestricted internet usage,\nnot as something that\nwe just sort of bequeath\non youth as they become 10 years old,\nbut something that we're\nactually much more careful about.\nProbably something that's going to be\npost pubescence going to\nmake a lot more sense,\nonce you've had more brain development,\nonce you've had more social entrenchment,\nyou sort of understand\nyour identity, et cetera.\nBecause we recognize,\nyou know, the flip side\nof plugging this thing into your brain is,\nyeah, you have access to more information,\nbut it also pumps that into your brain.\nSo, I don't know, I lean a\nlittle bit heavier towards\nthe pessimistic read because\nI know too many people,\nbecause of my books, who've really reduced\nthe impact of these things in their lives.\nAnd on the far side of\nthat transformation,\nthey don't, typically, report\na great impoverishment in experience.\nThey don't report, I'm\nless mentally agile.\nThe information at my fingertips is less,\nI'm missing out on life, there's\ntypically this coming out\nof the fog on the other side of it\nwhere they're like, \"Oh, this is fine.\"\nSo, you know, I'm a little\nbit suspicious about\nexactly what this mechanism is.\nYeah, I think you're right about\nthe moderate behavioral addiction piece.\nYears ago when I was starting my lab,\nI had grants to write\nand I found the phone\nto be pretty intrusive for that process.\nSo I used to give the\nphone to somebody in my lab\nand announced to everyone\nin my lab that if I asked\nfor it back prior to 5:00 PM that day,\nI would give everyone in the\nlab, I think it was $100 bill,\nmy lab was pretty big at the time.\nYeah.\nI was a junior professor.\nThey did not do... Sorry,\nacademic institutions not\nto be named, pay us very much\ndespite what people might think.\nAnd it was difficult.\nSeveral times\nYeah.\nThroughout the day or more I was like,\n\"Ah, I really want to look at that thing.\"\nBut at the end of the day,\nI'll tell you that no one got\npaid, I got my phone back.\nBut it's wonderful the amount of work\nthat you can get done when\nthat thing is out of the room.\nI mean, it's my superpower, right?\nI don't work that hard in the sense\nthat I don't do long hours,\nlike I'm not constitutionally\nsuited for long hours.\nThis was never my thing,\nmy brain tires, right?\nI mean, I'm good for four,\nfour and a half good hours\na day of actually producing good stuff\nwith my brain, probably, max.\nBut, you know, I don't\nuse my phone that much.\nI don't use the internet that much,\nand I prioritize it, and\na lot just gets done.\nIt just sort of piles\nup over time, you know?\nAnd there's this sense of\nlike, you must be burning\nthe midnight oil and you have\nall these things going on.\nBut again, people I think underestimate,\nthey underestimate the impact of this.\nIt's not just the accumulation\nof time you spend looking on your phone,\nit's also this network\nswitching cost, right?\nBecause like the phone\nis very good at inducing\na network switch, and that's\na expensive, time consuming,\nenergy consuming, neuronal operation.\nTask switching?\nYeah.\nI'm going to switch my focus\nof attention from this to that.\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat you just viewed,\nplease check out the full\nlength episode by clicking here."
