    "transcript": "[no audio]\nDid you always know you\nwanted to be a neuroscientist\nfrom the time you started college?\nWhat was your trajectory?\nI should know this, but I...\n[E.J. chuckling]\nYou were an undergraduate at?\nAt Princeton.\nAt Princeton, that right,\nstudying?\nMath.\nMath.\nSo, you could've just done all your work\nwith a piece of paper and a pen,\nbut you had to try and\nengineer all these electrodes?\n[E.J. chuckling]\nOkay, that's a pen\nand paper, pen.\nI took a very random route.\nI studied math as an undergrad.\nI spent a few years running\naround, playing music,\nand traveling, and living a bohemian life.\nWell, tell me more about that.\nOh, I basically just told you\nall I'm going to tell. [laughs]\nFollowing The Grateful Dead?\nNo, not quite following them,\nbut that was an important\npart of the story,\nand inspired my music.\nWas that an important part\nof your personal development?\nYes.\nYeah?\nVery much so.\nFree expression, dance, music,\ncreative, exploratory music,\nall that kind of stuff.\nSuch a contrast to the\nE.J. that comes forward\nwhen we're talking about\nthe precision of neural\n[E.J. chuckling]\nstimulation in specific\nretinal cell types,\nbut I think it's useful\nfor people to hear,\nboth young and old, like,\nthat one's nervous system\ncan be partitioned into\nthese different abilities\nto, like, go and dance and travel,\nand you weren't doing anything\nacademic at that time?\nNo, for a few years, I wasn't doing that.\nProgramming computers to make a living,\nand then I started three\ndifferent PhD programs at Stanford\nbefore I settled.\nSimultaneously?\nNo, no, no.\nOh my goodness.\nIn sequence.\nI started in the math PhD program.\nI learned that was not really for me,\nand I started in a economics PhD program\nin the business school there,\nand I realized after less than\na year, that was not for me.\nI worked in a startup company for a while,\nI did a lot of stuff for a few years,\nand took some settling,\nbut then I decided to\ngo into neuroscience,\nand there were a couple formative things.\nOne is that I had gotten a\nreally formative experience\nas an undergraduate from a\nwonderful guy called Don Ready,\nwho taught an introductory\nneuroscience course,\nwho was really inspiring mentor.\nAnd when I was at Stanford,\nI met Brian Wandell,\nmy PhD advisor, and I was inspired by him.\nI thought, I didn't\nknow why he was studying\nwhat he was studying,\nbut I just knew I wanted\nto learn from this man,\nand I wanted to study with him.\nI just knew this was the\nperson who should be my mentor.\nBased on something about him?\nYes.\nCan I ask you\nabout these three PhD programs?\nBecause I think people here,\n[E.J. chuckling]\nyou know, or see what you're doing,\nand probably imagine a\nvery linear trajectory,\n[E.J. chuckling]\nbut now, I'm hearing you,\nlike, toured around playing music,\nthen you start a PhD program, nope,\nthen another one, nope, then another one.\nWithout getting into all the details,\nI mean, were there\nnights spent lying awake,\nthinking, like, \"What am I\ngoing to do with my life?\"\nOr did you have the sense that you knew\nyou wanted to do something important,\nyou just hadn't found\nthe right fit for you?\nLike, how much anxiety,\non a scale of one to 10,\n10 being total panic, did you experience\nat the apex of your anxiety\nin that kind of wandering?\nAm I allowed to go above 10,\nlike turning up the amp to 11?\nSure, I just think it's really important\nfor people to hear,\nYeah.\nWhether or not they want\nto be scientists or not,\nthis idea that people that\nare doing important things\nin the world, in my view, rarely, if ever,\nunderstood that that's the thing\nthat they were going to be doing.\nThere was some wandering about.\nThat sure seems like it, doesn't it?\nYeah, I experience the same\nwhen I talk to other people,\nand it seems like that,\nand for sure for me.\nIt just took a while of\ntrying different things\nto see, number one, what\nI was really good at,\nand where I felt I\ncould make a difference,\nand I realized I studied\nmath, and I was okay at math,\nbut I know, I have known mathematicians\nwho are really talented,\ngifted mathematicians,\nthe one who really make a difference.\nI wasn't going to be one of those people.\nLikewise, playing music.\nI don't have that intrinsic talent.\nIt's fun, I can play songs in\nfront of people, and do stuff,\nI like it, and stuff like that,\nbut I don't have that kind of talent.\nIn fact, I'll say something\nthat I say to friends sometimes,\nand you're a good friend of mine.\nIf I had the talent to\nget a few thousand people\non their feet dancing by playing music,\nI'd probably just do that.\nReally?\nAs long as we've been\nfriends, I knew none of this.\n[E.J. laughing]\nLike, none of this.\nMostly because I think\nwe always end up talking\nabout neuroscience,\nCHUCKLES: Right.\nOr other aspects of our life.\nYes.\nBut I didn't know,\nI mean, I know a great\nmany things about you,\nbut I had no idea.\n[E.J. chuckling]\nIt's so interesting.\nDo you still do dance?\nWe had Erich Jarvis on\nthe podcast, by the way,\nprofessor at Rockefeller,\nwho studies, at one point,\nwas studying speech in birds,\nas in song in birds,\nMm-hmm.\nAnd then he's done a great\nmany other things now,\nand genetics of\nvocalization, and, you know,\nhe actually danced with,\nor was about to dance\nwith the Alvin Ailey Dance Company,\nWow.\nSo, yeah, a really,\nreally talented dancer.\nAnd so, you know, dance seems to be\nlike a theme that comes up\namong the neuroscience guests\n[E.J. chuckling]\non this podcast, do you still dance?\nYeah, I love to dance,\nI'm a freeform dancer.\nI'm not a skilled dancer,\nbut I love music, I love dancing.\nI think it's part of the human spirit.\nI someday will understand the neuroscience\nbehind dancing, right?\nDancing's a universal human\nthing in all cultures.\nWhat is this dancing thing?\nWhy do we do this, and\nother creatures don't?\nWell, Jarvis thinks that perhaps it's one\nof the more early forms of language,\nand that song came before spoken language.\nIt's sort of interesting that birds\nthat can actually recreate human speech\noftentimes have the\nability to dance, as well.\nOh, wow.\nAnd so,\nthere's some commonality\nNow, I got to look to that.\nOf circuitry there.\n[E.J. chuckling]\nAnyway, we'll provide\na link to that episode.\nJarvis is a really interesting\nI would love to hear that.\nANDREW: Guy, yeah.\nI mean, but if I may, I just...\nI'd like to riff on\nthat in a different way.\nI did spend some time wandering\naround, as many people do,\nand I think particularly\nfor your young listeners\nand viewers, who don't know, wow,\nyou know, \"Could I ever be a scientist\nand develop new things, stuff like that?\"\nYes, you can, and if you're\nmessing around your life,\ntrying this, trying that,\ntrying the other thing,\ndefinitely stick with it.\nKeep looking for the\nthing that works for you.\nI really deeply believe that.\nYou got to play around, you got to find\nwhat it is that works for you.\nInterestingly enough, at\nleast it's interesting for me,\nI spent a lot of years studying the retina\nin a pure basic science, just\ncuriosity-driven research way,\nas you and I have both done in the past,\nand as it turned out,\nI learned all the stuff I\nneeded to know about the retina\nto develop a high fidelity,\nadaptive retinal implant\nof the type that I'm talking\nabout in that process.\nThe technology, the\nstimulation, recording,\nfiguring out the cell types,\nhow do you stimulate, all the stuff.\nI learned all that stuff,\nand I have come to a point in my life\nwhere I realize, wow, if\nsomebody's going to do\nwhat I think needs to be done,\nwhich is to take everything\nwe've learned about the retina,\nand instantiate that in smart technology\nthat can restore vision,\nand do all the things\nwe've been talking about,\nwho are the people in the world\nwho have the right\ntraining and background,\nand know-how to do that stuff?\nI'm one of them, I know that,\nand it's totally by chance\nthat I picked up and learned,\nor it seems by chance, that I picked up\nand learned the things that\nI need to know for this, so,\nbut I definitely have the\nright know-how to do this\nbased on all my training and\nthe research that I've done,\nand it feels accidental sometimes.\nI look back on my own history, I'm like,\n\"How did I get here,\nwhere this is obviously\nthe thing I need to do?\nWas this on purpose?\"\nIt didn't seem like it was on purpose,\nbut now, I got to do this,\nbecause I know what needs to be done,\nand it's something that needs to be done.\nSo, that's my mission for the, you know,\ncoming decade or so.\nWild.\n[E.J. chuckling]\nI mean, I knew you had\nthis engineer, mathy,\ngeeky neuroscience.\nI don't want to say geeky,\n'cause, well,\n[E.J. laughing]\n'cause it makes it sound like\nI'm not there in the same\nWe love geeks. [chuckles]\nRaft with you,\nbut I didn't know about\nthis more free-spirited,\nmove in all directions depending on what\none feels in the moment, dancing, E.J.\nIt's very cool.\nAre you still a absolute\nlevel 11 coffee snob?\nYes.\nOkay, yeah.\nI used to go to meetings,\nand E.J. would bring his own coffee maker\nand coffee to meetings.\n[E.J. laughs]\nWe're not talking about\nan espresso machine,\nwe're talking about, like, extreme levels\nof coffee snobbery.\nA press pot,\nthe correct ground coffee,\nThere you go, yeah.\nThe correct kind of\npress pot, yeah.\nGood, good, good.\n[E.J. exhaling]\nI expect nothing less.\n[E.J. laughing]\nProof that not all\ncircuits in the brain are\nneuroplastic, nor should they be.\nAnd that's right.\nBut to bridge off of that\nin a more serious way,\ndespite the free, you\nknow, free exploration\naspect to yourself,\nand that hopefully other\npeople don't suppress,\nit seems like you really are good\nat, like, knowing your taste,\nlike, it seems like the...\nI think it was the great Markus Meister,\na colleague of ours, who, you know,\nhas also worked on the\nneural retina extensively,\nof course, once said, you know,\nthat there's a coding system in the brain\nthat leads to either the perception,\nthe feeling of yum, yuck, or meh,\nand that so much of life is\nbeing able to register that\nin terms of who you interact with and how,\nand the the choices are\nproblems to work on.\nIt seems like you have a very keen sense\nof, like, yes, that, and\nyou move toward that.\nYou've always been very goal-directed\nsince the time I've known you, so,\nand you've picked such a huge problem,\nbut going about it in such a precise way,\nhence the analogy to the space mission.\nSo, like, when you experience that,\nmay I ask, does it come\nabout as like a thought?\nLike, \"Oh yeah, that has to be the thing?\"\nOr is it like a whole body sensation?\nWhat a great question,\nI love that question.\nI have two things to say that.\nThe first is that for\nme, it's all feeling.\nI don't make hardly any\ndecisions out of thoughts.\nI think, I process, I put\nit all into the hopper,\nand the hopper comes out,\nand spits out a feeling,\nand feeling's like, \"Yeah,\nthat's the thing to do.\"\n100%, and I know not everybody's like me.\nLots of people aren't like me,\nand particularly lots of\nscientists aren't like me,\nthat, you know,\nbut I definitely roll that way.\nThat is absolutely how I work.\nThere's something that's related to that,\nthat I think is, you\nknow, philosophically,\nand in terms of personal development\nand spiritual development stuff,\nI think is quite relevant,\nthat I think you'll relate to.\nMy favorite aphorism is \"Know thyself.\"\nThe Oracle.\nAnd I think, because if\nyou don't know yourself,\nyou can't do anything.\nYou don't even know where to go.\nYou can't even, you know, orient yourself\nat the next thing in your life,\nand I think it deserves\nto have two corollaries\nthat go with it, or addenda.\nKnow thyself, be thyself,\nwhich is not easy.\nIt's not easy to really\nbe yourself in this world.\nThey're all sorts of things telling us\nto be something other than what we are.\nAnd the third one is love thyself,\nand it's, you know,\nhaving gone through much\nexploration of yourself, and\nyour life, and your values,\nand me, too, and all the things\nwe've talked about over\ntime, that's not easy.\nSome of us are not necessarily\nprogrammed to love ourselves,\nand it's a skill,\nand I really try my best to\nbe with those three things\nall the time.\nKnow thyself, be thyself, love thyself.\nCould you elaborate a little bit more\non your process for the third?\nThis is a concept that has\nbeen very challenging for me,\nand I think for many other people,\nand it gets kind of opaque\nwhen it starts getting conflated\nwith, like, self-respect, et cetera.\nLike, loving thyself,\ndo you have practices?\nDo you meditate?\nDo you journal?\nDo you spend time trying to\ncultivate a love for self?\nYeah.\nYeah, I meditate in an informal way\nin the morning with my coffee.\nEvery morning, I make a\nfantastic cup of coffee,\n[Andrew laughing]\nand I sit with it\nI believe you.\nFor five or 10 minutes,\nand take in my world as\nit's coming toward me,\nand start, as I come into the day,\nand come into consciousness,\nI meditate like that.\nAnd I have a Ashtanga-related\nyoga practice.\nMany of your viewers and listeners\nwill know about Ashtanga yoga.\nIt's a very physical, spiritual,\ntraditional yoga practice\nthat has a deep meditative\nand breath-focused component.\nI know you've had lots of episodes\nand discussion about the breath,\nand the importance of that for awareness.\nYou know, at the end of\nmany western yoga practices,\nyou end with namaste, which\nis expressing your respect\nfor the connectedness of\nwhat is in front of you\nto the whole universe,\nand what's common to all\nof us and everything.\nAnd I usually practice yoga by myself,\nand when I say namaste at\nthe end of my yoga practice,\na part of that is to myself.\nEarlier, when I asked you about how\nyou guide your decisions,\nyou said, \"It's all feel,\"\nand you provided a beautiful description\nas to how and why that occurs for you,\nand your trust in that.\nI don't recall you saying\nwhether or not the feeling\nis in your head, or it's\na whole body feeling.\nDoes it have a particular signature to it\nthat you'd be willing to share?\nIs it excitement that makes\nyou want to get up and move,\nor is it a stillness?\nI think I ask, because we've been talking\nthroughout today's\nepisode about, you know,\nthe precision of neural coding,\nand the signals that are at\nthe level of individual cells,\nand yet when it comes to feeling,\nwe actually have a pretty crude map,\nand certainly a deficit in language\nto explain what this feeling thing is.\nAnd I know that people experience life\nand feelings differently,\nbut I think it's often insightful\nwhen somebody with your understanding\nof the nervous system and yourself\ncan share a bit, like,\nwhat does it feel like?\nI love that question,\nand it relates to something\nyou said to me years ago.\nWhat it feels like is ease.\nHmm.\nAnd I remember years\nago, when we were talking\nabout challenging things that each of us\nwas facing in our lives,\nyou said to me something like,\n\"I wish for you some\nease with all of this.\"\nIt was very moving, touching,\nas that's what a good friend does,\nis to give that to somebody,\nto who they love, and,\nit sticks with me probably 10 years later.\nSo,\nthe feeling I feel when I'm on the path\nthat makes sense for me is ease.\nThere's just nothing, it's\njust, okay, this is it.\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat you just viewed,\nplease check out the full\nlength episode by clicking here."
