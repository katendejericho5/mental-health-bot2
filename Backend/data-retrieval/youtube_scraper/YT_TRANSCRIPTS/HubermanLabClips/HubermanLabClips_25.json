    "transcript": "You don't drink alcohol, correct?\nCorrect.\nHave you ever had a sip of alcohol?\nI had, I drank alcohol once\nas part of a class experiment\nand had to mix all these\ndrinks and taste them\nand it was a terrible experience.\nBut it was a requirement\nin the class I was taking.\nWow. School was different back then.\nYeah.\nOr that school was different.\nI think school was different.\nWe used to prick our fingers\nand do our own blood\ntests in science class.\nI never did it 'cause I\nwas always needle phobic,\nbut that was definitely something\nthat was asked of us to do.\nYeah, you could never\nget away with that now\nin a high school classroom.\nThe reason I ask about\nalcohol is, first of all,\nI'm not the Anti-Alcohol Crusader,\neven though I did an episode about alcohol\nwhich discouraged many people\nfrom drinking more of it,\nbut I think for a lot of people,\nthe idea of smoking\ncannabis, drinking alcohol,\nfor them in their mind is synonymous\nwith the creative\nprocess, especially music\nfor a lot of reasons\nthat people can imagine.\nI think it's remarkable and impressive\nand worth spending a few moments\nwith you sharing with us,\nhow is it that you were\naround all of that?\nYou're clearly part of the crew,\nmeaning you're part of\nthe creative process.\nPresumably people offered you\nalcohol, drugs, et cetera,\nbut something in you seems\nresistant to any kind\nof peer pressure, and as an\nadult, that's impressive.\nBut to think, like,\nwhen I was 15, 16, sure.\nI sort of regret it, but yeah, I drank.\nI had my experiences and\nthen eventually stopped that.\nBut most people are not\ngood at not drinking\nif they don't want to drink ever\nor just once from a high school class.\nWhat was the internal\nnarrative in your mind\nwhen that stuff was around\nand what allowed you to just say,\n\"No, I belong here, but\nI'm not going to do that.\"\nIt just was never interesting to me\nand I think maybe it had to\ndo with being an only child.\nI'd never, being an only child,\nI think made me less\nresistant to peer pressure\nbecause I felt more\nconfident in who I was,\nwhatever that was, just\nfrom being with myself\nand not with other siblings.\nI'm guessing, I don't\nknow if that's right,\nbut that's my first inclination\nis to guess that would be the case.\nAlso, I've always known what I like\nand known what I don't like\nand know there are things I want to try.\nThere are things I don't want to try\nand I feel very good about not doing\nsomething I don't want to do.\nI feel great about it.\nHave you ever been curious\nabout psychedelics? Given that-\nI'm very curious.\nI've never done it, but I'm very curious\nand I've been curious for a long time.\nThere may be a time when I experiment.\nYeah, there are two\npsychedelics in particular\nthat I find really interesting.\nOne is macrodose\npsilocybin, which I've done\nas part of a clinical trial.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd my understanding is it reveals\nin a very intense and experiential way,\nsome component of the unconscious mind\nand it allows for plasticity\nand rewiring of the brain\nthat's permanent if you\ncome to some understanding\nthrough the so-called integration.\nIt's not without its risks.\nThe other one that's really interesting\nthat I've been hearing more\nabout and I have not tried\nand it carries some dangers, is ibogaine,\nwhich is 22 hours long and\npeople experience the world\nas normal with their eyes open,\nbut when they close their eyes, they get\na high resolution movie-like\nversion of prior experiences,\nbut they have agency within those movies,\nthey can reshape their reactions.\nThis is being used to\ntreat PTSD in veterans\nto great success.\nIt has some cardiac\nrisk associated with it,\nand it's not legal in the United States\nand it's not being explored\nin clinical trials yet,\nbut the state of Kentucky recently took,\nI think it's $40 million\nfrom the Oxycontin settlement\nand is putting it to ibogaine research.\nInteresting.\nYeah.\nSo those are the two that\nkind of spring to mind,\nkind of the classic\npsychedelic experience.\nI've also heard good things about MDMA,\nbut I've never done that.\nYeah, I have done MDMA, again,\nas part of a therapeutic trial.\nIt's a strong empathogen.\nThe danger with MDMA, I think,\nis that if you don't stay in the eye mask\nor if you're listening\nto music or something,\nyou can easily get anchored\nto some external cue\nand see a plant and be\nlike, \"I love plants\"\nand spend the whole four to six hours\nthinking about your love of\nplants, which might be valuable,\nbut I think the strong introspective work\nis best done with a therapist\nthere and you in the eye mask\nand occasionally leaving the eye mask\nand writing things down.\nSo the reason I put that detail in there\nis that the psychedelic\nexperience is very different\nwith eyes open versus in the eye mask\nwith a clinician there\nversus recreationally.\nAnd it's not just about\ndangers versus safety,\nit's also about, it's a big investment\nand what one stands to\nget out of it, I think,\ndepends on how much introspection\nyou're willing to do.\nWe won't be doing it this afternoon.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
