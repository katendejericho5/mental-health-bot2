    "transcript": "There were a lot of questions\nabout your daily routine.\nPeople love this.\nThe morning routine, the daily routine.\nAnd while I have to believe\nthat everybody's necessary routine\nis quite different from the next,\nif you wouldn't mind\njust giving us a sense\nof like the first couple\nhours of your day,\nwhat that typically looks like\nwhen you're like not traveling\nand you're settled into a place.\nIt's different depending\non the place that I'm in,\nbut typically it involves waking up,\ngoing out into the sun\nas naked as possible to start the day.\nI try to wake up slowly,\nand probably within an hour of that\nI'll leave the house\nand go for as long of a\nbeach walk as possible.\nOr if I'm in a place\nwhere there's a gym several days a week,\nI'll go to the gym instead.\nBut I'll do some activity,\nI would say about an hour after waking up.\nSometimes it's an hour and a half,\nsometimes it's less,\ndepending on the place I'm at.\nI also might do stretching\nbefore I go on the walk\nand do just several stretches\non yoga mats on the floor\nor with foam rollers or balls\nor some different things.\nI don't start my day until\nthose things are out of the way.\nI try to avoid any work related, anything.\nNow, that said, if a thought comes up\nthat I'm excited about, I'll note it.\nI won't avoid thoughts,\nbut I tend not to engage in any work\nuntil probably 11:00, 11:00\na.m. would be the soonest,\nand some days not until 1:00.\nAnd then I do focused work until maybe 6,\nand then I spend the rest of the night\ntrying to wind down out of work mode.\nSo 1:00 p.m. to 6:00\np.m. are really the peak\nquote unquote work hours.\nCould be 11 too.\nLike today, we started here at 11,\nand I felt like I'd be good by 11.\nAnd I already did my morning walk.\nI had the argument on the beach.\nI was in the sun, I was in the hot tub.\nI had a whole morning already.\nAnd then what does your\nevening wind down look like\nin terms of the space that\nyou're in or trying to create\nand your internal landscape?\nWell, it's only red light.\nFrom the time the sun sets,\nI'm wearing red glasses.\nI'm in a space with only red light.\nI am 99% of the time home with my family,\nand we talk.\nI might watch wrestling or a documentary\nwith red glasses on.\nWe eat dinner together,\nor we eat dinner in shifts\ndepending on how it's working.\nBut we're all together.\nAnd I find something to occupy my mind\nthat gets me out of the workday.\nThat said, sometimes the ideas still flow,\nand I'll note them.\nBut I avoid any kind of a work phone call\nor anything that's stimulating\nor that will get me thinking about it.\nI aim for sunset,\nand then I'm usually in bed...\nI'm usually in bed by 10\nand fall asleep within 15 minutes.\nYour relationship to light is fascinating.\nThe sunlight piece makes a lot of sense\nand will make sense to the\nlisteners of this podcast.\nWe haven't done too many episodes,\nbut we will do more\nthat covers the trying to\navoid bright light exposure\nin the evening.\nYou're wearing the red lens glasses now,\neven though it's the middle of the day.\nThat's because we've got\nthese bright lights around us, correct?\nAnd have you found\nthat limiting your bright\nartificial light exposure\nin the evening has benefited you,\nand in what ways?\nAbsolutely.\nAnd once you've done it,\nonce you've changed and avoid\nlike looking at screens,\nor my phone turns red at night.\nWhen I see someone else's phone\nif someone comes to visit\nand their phone lights up at night,\nit's blinding and it's so disturbing.\nAnd, for them, that's normal.\nThey're in this heightened,\nblown-out place all the time.\nI'm staying at neutral.\nI'm staying at the more natural,\nhow the world would be\nif man didn't create all\nof these loud things.\nLoud devices.\nI've switched my phone\nthanks to your input.\nAnd we will have released a clip on this\nby the time this episode airs\non the triple-click approach\nto the phone that you\ncan put in very easily\nto allow it to go from regular\nscreen to red screen at night\nso that you don't have to go\ninto the settings each time.\nYou just triple click.\nWe'll provide a link to that explanation.\nAnd Rick taught me that\nwhen I was over in Italy.\nEveryone in his home turned to me\nand said, \"Wait, your phone is so bright.\n\"You got to do the red light thing.\"\nI said, \"I don't know how.\"\nAnd you taught me that,\nso it's a very useful trick.\nHave you noticed a\ndifference since looking at?\nHuge positive difference.\nI sleep better.\nThere are great data now\n'cause of course I go\nthen and find the data.\nFor shift workers,\npeople that have to be\nup at night working,\nif they put them under red light,\nthe amount of cortisol at\nthat time is suppressed,\nwhich is great\nas compared to when they're\nunder bright, artificial lights\nwithout red lens glasses,\nor if they're in red lights,\nit's far more beneficial.\nLess cortisol.\nYou want cortisol high early in the day,\nviewing sunlight early in the day,\nincrease it by at least 50%,\nthen you want it to taper off.\nAnd on and on.\nI heard something recently,\nwhich is going to make a lot of sense.\nOne thing that's happened\nin the last 30 years,\nwhich may at least partially\nexplain the obesity crisis,\nis that calories which are depleted\nof nutrients, micronutrients\nare very cheap now.\nVery cheap to get calories,\nbut they aren't nutritious calories.\nIn addition, there's been a\nchange in lighting technology\nso that blue light photons are very cheap.\nLike when I was a kid,\nmy parents would say,\n\"Turn off the lights.\n\"It's costing us all this money.\"\nNow it's very cheap to keep\nthe lights on in a home.\nThe heat is a different\nstory, but with respect.\nSo we have a lot of cheap photons.\nSo I think of blue light as cheap photons.\nNot the good-for-you photons,\nnot nourishing photons.\nAnd consuming calories too often\nor at the wrong times of\nday, we know is bad for you.\nConsuming photons in the wrong form\nat the wrong time of day, bad for you.\nAnd I think those two things combined\nplus all the downstream negative cascades\ncan largely explain the obesity\nand in some sense mental health crisis.\nThere I editorialized again.\nI realized that we're\ntrying to shift the ratio\nto more Rick, less Andrew.\nHe can't help himself.\nHe can't help himself,\nand Rick indulges me.\nActually, there were a\nnumber of questions in here\nthat asked me, \"How has Rick helped you?\"\nAnd I'm refraining from answering those\n'cause people want your answers for them,\nbut I do all the things\nthat Rick's referring to.\nI'm not wearing red lens glasses now,\nbut I have changed a lot\nof my health practices\nand/or sought out science\nto test whether or not some of the things\nthat you've been doing\nfor a while make sense.\nAnd, indeed, in every\ncase they've made sense.\nI'm not just saying that\nbecause you're here,\nbut you and I do a lot of the same things.\nWe're interested.\nAnd if it didn't work,\nwe'd probably stop doing it eventually.\nIt's like we're testing things.\nRight.\nAnd I do believe that\nwhat starts out as crazy,\nlike Mike Mentzer stuff of\nlow volume weight training\nwith heavy weights,\nit works so much better\nthan the high volumes.\nAll that stuff is being shown to be true\nin these peer-reviewed trials.\nThat's the nature of science.\nScience often follows the\npractitioners by many decades.\nIt doesn't get there first\nbecause it's a slower,\nmore iterative process.\nBut some people need to\nsee those clinical trials\nto feel comfortable doing something.\nI think the creative process\nis uniquely separated\nfrom academic science\nand academic scholarship\nin a way that I think\nhas really benefited it.\nI mean, can you imagine if the Geto Boys\nhad to get a degree in music theory\nin order to do what they do?\nThey wouldn't be the Geto Boys.\nOr Slayer?\nThey would not be Slayer.\nOr Public Enemy.\nYes.\nOr Adele.\nYes.\nOr Eminem.\nYes.\nAlmost by virtue of the fact\nthat there is no degree for that per se,\nthat allowed them to do\nwhat they did, right?\nAbsolutely.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
