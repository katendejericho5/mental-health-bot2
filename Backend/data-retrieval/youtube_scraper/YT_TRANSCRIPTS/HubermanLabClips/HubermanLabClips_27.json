    "transcript": "You said you protect the inner landscape,\nbut certainly you're not averse\nto high-intensity stimulation.\nLike, last night we went to see AEW.\nAnd by the way, thank you for taking me,\nthat was such an incredible experience.\nIt was really fun.\nIt was really fun, it reminded\nme of early punk rock shows\nwhere like some of my first\npunk rock shows where I went\nand just was like, \"Oh\nmy gosh, this is exciting\nand scary and I love it.\"\nYeah.\nAnd it felt loving too.\nYes.\nWhich is also the community\nof punk rock that I observed\nand have been blessed to be a part of.\nIt's like there, yeah, there's aggression,\nbut there's also love\nand then there's romance,\nand then there's also betrayal\nand there's all the elements,\nbut there's still a sense of\nlike everyone wants to be here\nand there's a sense of\ngoodness behind it all.\nAbsolutely.\nEven though some of it\nwas bloody and violent.\nYes.\nSo, for you,\nwhat does wrestling allow you to feel\nin those high-intensity environments?\nIt completely relaxes me\nbecause there are no stakes.\nYou know, nobody,\neveryone's working together in the show\nto protect each other.\nNo one's trying to hurt anybody\nregardless of what the storyline is.\nMm-hmm.\nIt's like a ballet where\nthere's a fight in the ballet,\nthere's no actual aggression\nof people towards each other,\nit's just the opposite.\nBut you get to experience\nthis wildly dynamic,\nexciting, surreal theater piece\nwhere people are doing these gymnastic\nand acrobatic things that\nare truly death defying.\nAnd it's fun, and the\nstorylines absorb you\nin a way where you know,\nyou never know what's true and what's not.\nYou know, we know wrestling's fake,\nwe're told wrestling's fake,\nbut there's something legitimate about it\nthat seems, to me, more\nlegitimate than anything else.\nThe most legitimate\nbecause it's the closest to\nwhat the world's actually like.\nPeople don't always tell\nyou what they really think.\nAnd when someone tells you a story,\nit might not really be the true story.\nThey may even think,\nthey may think they're\ntelling you the real story\nand that might not be the real story.\nWe don't know, we know so little.\nYou know, we experience something\nand then we make up a story\nto understand it ourselves\nand then forevermore\nwhen we tell that story\nit was our version of an experience.\nBut we don't know that's what happened,\nthat was our take on it.\nWrestling is like, \"That's\nwhat the real world is like,\"\nbecause when you watch wrestling,\nyou never know what's true.\nThat's what if you watch the news\nlike you watch wrestling\nand you never know what's true,\nit's more, it would be more accurate.\nYou'd have a better sense of the world\nif you took it all in\nlike it was pro wrestling.\nI think we're in a place in human history\nwhere people are starting to\nfeel that way about the media.\nIt's also why wrestling's so popular.\nYou know, it's more popular\nthan it's ever been.\nYeah, that's interesting.\nThings like UFC,\nkind of gladiator-like octagon fights\nand wrestling are increasing in popularity\ndespite the fact that supposedly\nwe're evolving. [laughs]\nSo, I think it reflects something\nboth primitive and evolved\nabout the human brain.\nYes.\nRight, primitive\nin the sense that, yeah,\nthere's some violence,\nit's physical.\nThat's down in the\nhypothalamus as we'd say.\nYou know, it scratches that itch,\nbut they're actually\nprotecting each other.\nYou know, it scratches that\nitch of seeing the gladiators,\nbut it's like watching a movie,\nyou know, it's not, they're not really,\nit's they're not really\nhurting each other.\nThey get hurt,\nbut only because the things\nthey're doing are so crazy.\nI think in order to be able\nto thoroughly enjoy wrestling,\none has to be able to give\nup narrative distancing\njust a little bit.\nRight, narrative distancing\nis this sense that this is a story,\nit's a movie, it's not real,\nbut there were moments like yesterday,\nthe jump off the top rope onto the guy\nwho's splayed out on the ladder,\nthe ladder breaks, this\nwas right in front of us.\nIt couldn't have felt good.\nNo.\nHe walked away,\nhe seemed fine-ish.\nYeah.\nBut that and then there was a match\nbetween two women\nwhere a woman put a metal plate\ninto the bottoms of her suit\nand then ran and then\njumped onto the other woman\nand hit her with the metal plate.\nAnd then, the metal plate\nkind of slipped out,\nshe was walking around and\neveryone knew she had cheated\n'cause you're not supposed\nto use the metal plate.\nBut, so it was sort of exciting\n'cause she had done it,\nexciting 'cause she\nhad gotten away with it\nand then at the same time\nexciting and upsetting\nthat the referee saw it,\nbut then didn't call it,\nI mean, it's this is like Twitter, X.\nLike real life.\nThis is like Instagram,\nthis is like politics.\nYeah.\nThis is like, this is real life, right?\nYeah.\nLike seeing people\nget away with things is so frustrating\nif you feel they shouldn't have, yeah.\nThat's all part of it.\nYeah.\nIt's like\nit's a very accurate\nrepresentation of the world.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
