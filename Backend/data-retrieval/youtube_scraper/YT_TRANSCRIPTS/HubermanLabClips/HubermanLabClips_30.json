    "transcript": "So someday it's a book stirring in me,\nis the art of thinking and how\nto use that kind of process\nand go deeper into it.\nAnd I talked a lot about\nit in one of my podcasts,\nwhich might be the seed of a book,\nbut the difference between dead\nthinking and alive thinking,\nideas can be either alive\nor they can be dead.\nAnd an alive idea is something\nthat enters your brain\nfrom an external source,\na philosopher, an article,\nsomebody you admire,\nsomebody you hate, and then you absorb it\nand you think about it and you decide,\nI'm going to turn it around into this\nand I'm going to make it alive,\nand it's going to make it\nsomething that's part of me.\nAnother part of an alive\nidea is you have an idea\nthat comes to you about\na book or a project\nor something about the world, and you go,\nmaybe that's not actually true.\nMaybe the opposite is true.\nAnd you go through a process and you cycle\nthrough it on and on,\nand you reflect on it,\nand you refine this idea,\nand maybe it turns into its opposite.\nAnd through the process of\nreflecting and correcting\nand revising it, you turn\nit into something living\nsomething alive within you, right?\nAnd what prevents people from\ngoing through that process,\nwhich would be the subject of\nmy book, is basically anxiety.\nBecause I think how you handle\nanxiety is the most important\nkind of quality in life.\nIt'll determine whether\nyou will be successful,\nwhether you will find your career path,\nor whether you won't be able to,\nI don't know if you can\nfollow that idea at all,\nbut anxiety is a signal to you\nthat you don't understand something that,\nthat there's a problem out\nthere that you can't resolve.\nAnd so what happens to most\npeople if you're insecure,\nis you glom onto\nsomething instant and easy\nto get rid of your feeling of anxiety.\nI don't understand this problem.\nOh, it must be the answer\nbecause this person said that.\nAnd so you don't develop\nthe ability to think,\nyou don't develop the ability\nto go to the next level.\nBut if you take that anxiety and you go,\nalright, maybe a is an answer,\nand then you start going through A\nand then you go, no,\nmaybe A isn't the answer,\nmaybe B is the answer.\nYou're able to surmount\nyour anxiety and go past it,\nfurther and further and further.\nYou don't rush for the\nfirst available answer\nthat's out there.\nYou're able to go through a\nprocess of refining things.\nAnd so in your career, if\nyou're anxious for success,\nif you're anxious for money,\nyou're going to make the wrong choices.\nBut if you're able to\ndeal with that anxiety\nand say, maybe I have to think more deeply\nabout where I'm going.\nI have to come up with other alternatives,\nthen you're going to\nmake a much better choice\non and on and on.\nSo if you're a creative person,\nit's very, very challenging\nto have that blank piece\nof paper before you, that\nbook that you haven't written,\nthat film or whatever.\nYou're filled with a lot of anxiety\nand you have to deal with it.\nAnd if you're able to turn\nit into something creative\nand productive, then\ngreat things will happen.\nYou'll create a masterpiece.\nSo the ability to deal with anxiety\nand to not give into the\nmost instant gratification\nthat you can get is to\nme, a marker of somebody\nwho will be creative and\nwill invent something,\nas opposed to people who just\nrecycle old and dead ideas.\nAmen to that.\nI was once told that anxiety\nmakes children of us all\nand not in the positive\nsense of being childlike.\nIt regresses us to a mode\nwhere we feel a complete lack of control.\nAnd I completely agree that\nbeing able to manage anxiety\nand work, dance with it.\nSince we can't rid ourselves of it.\nNo.\nNor should we, right?\nBecause it's a signal as you point out,\nthat we don't understand something.\nThat there's something\nto get curious about.\nA process or something out there, or both.\nI think that really resonates.\nAnd I think a lot of people will benefit\nfrom hearing that because I\nthink we hear the word flow\nand we just all imagine, I even\ncatch myself imagining that,\nwhen Robert Greene sits down to write,\nit's like there's a blank sheet\nand then he just kind of meditates\nand then boom, out come these books.\nNo.\nBut,\nif I get realistic for a second,\nI'm sure that there's a lot\nof inner turmoil and anxiety.\nOh my God, you have no idea.\nSo my process is 95% pain\nand maybe two and a half percent ecstasy.\nAnd I don't know what the\nother two and a half percent\nwould be, but, so I write a story.\n'Cause all in my new\nbook, in most of my books,\nI always begin with the story\nfrom history, et cetera.\nAnd it is so bad.\nI can't believe how bad, how\nflat it is, how it sucks.\nI'm so embarrassed, I hate myself.\nThen I go and I go dig into it,\nand I start changing the words in it,\nI start making a little bit better.\nThe second version,\nit's kind of palatable,\nbut it still sucks.\nIf I let it out into the world,\nit'd be very embarrassing.\nIt's anxious, and my wife can tell you\nI'm a miserable being when that happens,\neverything looks black\nto me at that point,\nand I push through it.\nSo if I gave in to my anxiety,\nand this happens with a\nlot of books and writers,\nI would just put out that second version,\nwhich isn't very good.\nIt isn't very strong.\nIt isn't thought through,\nbecause my ideas, when I\nlook at them the first time,\nI go, that's not real.\nThat's not the actual thing\nthat's going on here, Robert.\nYou've missed the mark.\nYou want to hit what's\nactually real in that story.\nSo you have to go deeper and deeper\nand harder and harder and harder.\nSo I don't just give up\nand go, here's the chapter.\nI go, it's got to be better.\nIt's got to be better.\nUntil finally after two\nmonths of struggling,\nit seems like it's gone to the place\nthat I want it to be in.\nBut I use that anxiety to keep improving\nand making it better.\nAnd then when I reach\nthat point and the story\nis good enough and I\ncan let my wife read it,\nand then my editor, I feel great.\nI have that 2% moment of joy.\nBut it came through all of that anxiety.\nBut I can tell you the\nfeeling of fulfillment\nwhen I finish a chapter is pretty great,\nwhen I finish a book.\nIt's better than any kind\nof drug experience anyone could ever have.\nIt's such a wonderful\nfeeling of accomplishment\nand pushing past all the barriers.\nSo my process involves a lot\nof anxiety in dealing with,\nthat's why I'm talking about it\nand why I want to write a book about it.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
