    "transcript": "When I was in university,\nthere were many topics\nthat I was excited to learn about,\nsome more than others, of course.\nBut occasionally,\nI'd be in a class or I'd get an assignment\nthat frankly I had minimal interest in,\nnever zero, but minimal interest.\nAnd as a way of dealing with that,\nI embarked on a process of\nliterally lying to myself\nand just telling myself,\n\"Okay, I'm super\ninterested in reading this\nand I'm going to force myself\nto be interested in reading it.\"\nAnd lo and behold,\nI would start falling in\nlove with certain things.\nMaybe it was even the, you\nknow, the arrival of a word\nthat I didn't recognize.\nAnd then I would go look it up.\nAnd I knew I was studying\nfor the GRE at that time,\nso I had to file that away.\nI still have my notebooks\nof all the vocabulary words\nthat I learned in the course\nof my university courses\nthat frankly made the verbal\nportion of the GRE pretty easy.\nYou know, which, if you\never try and study for that\nat the end, it's pretty tough\nto commit all those new\nwords to memory and context.\nSo I could find little hooks\nand through those hooks\nI could kind of ratchet my\nway into a larger interest.\nAnd then, lo and behold,\nI'm really interested in\nGreek mythology, you know,\nor I actually liked that one at first,\nbut, I didn't have to trick myself,\nbut, you know, maybe we could\nspend a little bit of time\ntalking about what is\ntrue intrinsic motivation.\nIs it always reflexive?\nCan we make ourselves\nintrinsically motivated\nabout a given topic, or\nscenario, or a group of people?\nAnd then let's talk about\nhow intrinsic motivation\nlinks to performance,\n'cause there's a rich\nliterature on this, as I recall,\nand I remember, you know,\nthe Stanford study of rewarding kids\nfor things they were already\ninterested or motivated to do.\nMaybe we could touch on that a little bit\nand remind people who\nhaven't heard about it.\nBut I'm fascinated by this topic\nbecause I feel like so much\nof life is about doing things\nthat initially we don't\nfeel that excited to do.\nAnd yet succeeding in life,\nyou know, until you can afford\nto offload your administrative\nwork to somebody else,\nwhich [laughing]\nhopefully by now you have.\nFind a way to get it done.\nRight.\nThis is fundamental\nto being a functional\nhuman being, frankly.\nIt is.\nNot just successful in air\nquotes, but functional.\nWe got to do stuff that\nwe don't enjoy doing.\nYeah. So I think we can talk\nabout a couple different ways\nto nurture intrinsic motivation.\nWe can think about how the\ntask itself is designed,\nwe can think about reward systems,\nand then we can think about also\nthe things we say to ourselves and others,\nwhich I hope are not lies, but\nrather persuasive attempts.\nLet's start on that one actually.\nI don't know a lot of people\nwho are that good at\ndeliberate self-deception.\nWell, I like to think it was only\naround a particular set of\ngoal motivated pursuits,\nbut at that time, for\nme, also it was survival.\nAs I mentioned, I didn't\ndo well in high school.\nI really wanted to perform\nwell in university,\nbut I knew that working just for the grade\nwasn't going to carry me.\nYeah.\nIt was, it felt catabolic.\nAnd I don't know, maybe I, at that age,\nI was still in the window of\nheightened neuroplasticity.\nWe know it never closes,\nbut I think I also fell\nin love with the process\nof learning how to do\nwhat I just described.\nYeah.\nSo I think for most people,\nthe best method of self-persuasion\nis actually to convince somebody else.\nSo I'm thinking of Elliot\nAronson's classic research\non cognitive dissonance,\nwhere he would ask you\nto go and tell somebody\nelse a task you hated\nis really interesting.\nAnd if he paid you a lot to do\nit, you still hated the task\nbecause you had a justification.\nLike, I got 20 bucks to, you know,\nto kind of fib a little\nbit about this task.\nYou know, the task is bad,\nbut I did it for the payment.\nWhen he paid you $1 to\ngo and tell somebody\nthat you loved a task that you didn't,\nyou ended up liking it more.\nWow.\nAnd maybe I shouldn't be surprised,\nbut maybe you should tell me\nwhy I shouldn't be surprised.\nBecause I hope people got what\nyou just said very clearly.\nIf they didn't, if you\ndon't like doing something,\ngoing and reporting to somebody else,\nhow great that thing is,\nso lying about it to somebody else\nis one way to increase\nthe degree to which you like or enjoy\nthat behavior or topic.\nAnd if you're paid $20\nto go lie to somebody\nin the positive direction,\nso against your true belief,\nit's less effective in shifting\nyour underlying effect about\nthat thing, your emotions,\nthan if you're paid less.\nCorrect?\nYeah, exactly.\nNow, I think, obviously in the experiment,\nlying was an easy way to show the effect.\nBut in real life, I think the way\nthat you want to apply this is to say,\n\"All right, I've got to find\nsomething about this task\nthat's interesting to me.\"\nAnd then in the process of\nexplaining it to somebody else,\nI'm going to convince myself,\nbecause I'm hearing the argument\nfrom somebody I already like and trust.\n[Andrew laughs]\nAnd I've also chosen,\nI've chosen the reasons\nthat I find compelling\nas opposed to hearing\nsomebody else's reasons.\nAnd so I think this goes to the point\nthat you were making, which is,\nif you're trying to find a hook\nto make a topic intriguing,\nyou've got to figure out,\nokay, what is it that would\nmake this fascinating to me?\nAnd, you know, in a lot of\ncases, what you're looking for\nis a curiosity gap.\nI think social scientists\nlike to talk about curiosity\nas an itch that you have to scratch.\nSo there's something you want to know\nand you don't know it yet.\nSo I would say, I tell\nmy students often, like,\ntake your least favorite class\nand find a mystery or a puzzle,\nlike something that you just\ndo not know the answer to.\nLike, I actually, I've talked\nwith our kids about this.\nLike, what really happened to King Tut?\nDo you know? Can you get\nto the bottom of that?\nAnd all of a sudden\nthey're like, I wonder,\nI need to Google it,\nand then I need to see\nif Wikipedia has credible\ninformation on this.\nAnd the more you learn about that,\nthe more intriguing it becomes.\nAnd I think that's the\nbeginning of the process\nof finding intrinsic motivation.\nI see.\nSo inherent in your answer is the idea\nthat there's something wired\ninto our neural circuits,\nand therefore psychology,\nthat curiosity as a verb,\nthe act of being curious\nand seeking information\nwhere, well, and I should\nsay I define curiosity\nand I hopefully you'll disagree with me\nor agree, either way, it doesn't matter\nas long as we can get\na deeper understanding.\nI define curiosity as a\ndesire to find something out\nwhere you are not attached\nto a particular outcome.\nYes.\nIs that right?\nYeah, in psychology it's typically defined\nas just wanting to know.\nAnd that means you're\ndriven by the question,\nnot a particular answer,\nwhich is exactly what you're driving at.\nOkay, great.\nSo, and I think it was\nDorothy Parker that said,\n\"The cure for boredom is curiosity.\nThere is no cure for curiosity.\"\nAs there shouldn't be\na cure for curiosity,\nRight.\nSo, and by the way, folks,\nwe don't know what neural circuits\nsub-serve curiosity in the brain.\nIt's got to be a distributed network.\nThere's no brain area for curiosity,\nbut it's got to be linked up\nwith the reward systems of\ndopamine, et cetera, in some way.\nBecause when one discovers something new\nthat satisfies some curiosity, it's,\nclearly there's a internal reward there.\nOkay, let me back up.\nSo if your child or an\nadult is dreading working,\nexploring a topic,\nor going about an assignment of any kind,\nyou will give them a question\nthat they then need to resolve.\nWhat if the assignment\nis like rake the leaves\noff the front lawn?\nDo you say, you know, count the leaves,\nor, I mean, how does one get past\nthe sort of procrastination\nand generate some intrinsic\nmotivation for things\nthat one dreads where it's unlikely\nthat they're going to\ndiscover some knowledge\nthat's exceedingly useful for the future?\nYou always start with,\n\"Okay, what's the first\nexperiment I can run?\nFind the most interesting looking leaf\nor your favorite leaf?\nAnd then that lasts for about two minutes\nand you're like, \"Okay, now what?\nWe still have a lot of leaves there.\"\nRight.\nI think not all tasks can be made\nintrinsically motivating to everyone.\nAnd so when intrinsic\nmotivation is difficult to find,\nwhat you want to substitute\nwith is a sense of purpose.\nMaybe a better way to say that is\nwhen the process is\nnot interesting to you,\nyou need to find a meaningful outcome.\nSo there's some research on\nthe boring but important effect\nwhere kids who have a\npurpose for learning,\nthis goes through high school,\nand think, you know, this is\nnot just interesting to me,\nbut I'm going to be able\nto use this knowledge\nto help other people one day,\nthey're more persistent in their studying,\nthey end up getting better grades.\nAnd so I think, you know,\nintrinsic motivation\nis often driven by\ncuriosity about the how.\nA sense of purpose comes from\nreally thinking hard about the why.\nWhy does this matter?\nAnd so I'd say with the,\nyou know, the raking leaves,\nlet's try to connect that task\nto something that else\nthat you care about.\nAre you going to, you know,\npleasantly surprise your parents\nwhen they get home?\nAre you going to, you know,\nhave a place to play soccer\nthat you didn't before?\nAnd I think then the, you know,\nthe process of of getting to that,\nI guess what I would say is,\nif you're trying to motivate yourself,\nit's a little bit harder\nthan if you're trying to\nmotivate somebody else on this.\nIf I was going to motivate somebody else,\nI would take a page\nout of the motivational\ninterviewing playbook,\nwhere I would say, \"Okay, Andrew...\"\nActually, let's play\nthis out for a second.\nSo you're going to rake a pile of leaves.\nIt's a two-hour task.\nZero to 10, how excited\nare you about that?\nA three.\nThree? Really? I'm surprised.\nI thought you were going\nto say zero or one.\nWhy is it not lower?\nI like any sort of physical activity\nbecause it allows me to move\nand I just like moving my body.\nThere we go.\nOkay, so you just identified\na potential source of purpose\nfor that activity.\nAnd I don't have a vested interest\nin convincing you to do this task.\nI am genuinely curious about\nwhat would motivate you\nto want to do it.\nAnd as you start to articulate it,\nboom, self persuasion kicks in.\nLove it. I'm going to start\nusing these approaches.\nTry it at your own risk.\nI have a question about\nextrinsic motivation.\nSo if we grow up being\nincentivized by extrinsic things,\nyou know, you'll get your\nallowance if you blank.\nYou can spend the money that you make\nand, you know, on your paper route\ndoing the things you really want to do.\nIs there any value\nin those kinds of\nlearning based incentives\nfor kids and for adults?\nBecause, I mean, that's\nthe real world as well.\nI know plenty of people,\nI have family members\nthat only work for a paycheck\nand they're pretty okay\nbecause they like spending their paycheck.\nProbably more than I, you know,\nI'm not intrinsically attached to money.\nI mean, I certainly have needs in life,\nbut I don't enjoy spending money\nfor the sake of spending it\nor for gaining more possessions.\nBut I know people that do,\nand I certainly don't judge.\nAre they somehow existing\nin the diminished\nlandscape of happiness or,\nbecause they seem pretty happy to me.\nBut they seem to have also\nworked out this relationship.\nThey do certain things to\nget the extrinsic rewards\nand they really enjoy what they can do\nwith those extrinsic rewards.\nThere's a, so there's\na huge body of evidence\non what are the effects\nof extrinsic rewards\non motivation and performance.\nAnd I think the latest conclusions,\nif you look at the latest meta-analysis,\nso, you know, huge study of\nstudies trying to accumulate\nlike what's the average effect\nof adding a financial incentive to a task\nthat wasn't incentivized before\nor to a job where, you\nknow, you were paid salary\nand now we're going to give\nyou incentive compensation.\nThere is a boost.\nSo in general, people are more productive\nwhen they're incentivized\nfor their output.\nBut these incentives are better\nfor motivating quantity than quality.\nSo you see people get more done,\nbut they're not necessarily\nmore careful or more thorough.\nAre they less careful and less thorough?\nNo, actually they're still\npositive effects on average,\nthey're just weaker.\nAnd, of course, you\ncould then start to say,\n\"Well, how do I incentivize, you know,\nbeing fast and careful.\"\nBut I think where we do\nhave to be really cautious\nis there's an undermining\neffect of extrinsic rewards\non intrinsic motivation.\nAnd you were alluding to this earlier,\ndating back to the early seventies\nwhere we know that if we\ntake an interesting task\nand then we pay you for it,\nyou might conclude that you're\nonly doing it for the outcome\nand you lose interest in the task.\nSo the classic demonstration,\nMark Lepper and colleagues\nis, kids playing video games\nand they're playing them\nbecause they're fun.\nAnd then you start to add in an incentive\nand then when the incentive's taken away,\nthey don't want to play anymore\nbecause the meaning of\nthe task has changed.\nAnd now I'm doing it 'cause I\nwant to get something out of it,\nas opposed to, I love the process.\nI think that that phenomenon\ndoes not have to exist.\nSo we know, for example, at work,\nif managers, as long as\nthey give people autonomy,\nthey don't present the\nrewards in a controlling way.\nSo instead of saying, you know,\n\"Andrew, in order to earn this,\nyou need to do the following work.\"\nIf they say, \"Hey, look, you know,\nI'd really love it if you, you know,\nif you would deliver the following\nand in order to make\nthat worth your while,\nI'm offering this incentive.\"\nPeople react very differently\nwhen they have a sense\nof choice and control.\nSo I think that that's, I\nguess, the starting point\nin the presence of autonomy,\nI don't think there's a major\ndownside of extrinsic rewards.\nI think you also have to be careful that,\nyeah, I guess, that you're\nnot over justifying the task.\nIn other words, you're not,\nyou're not swamping people's\nintrinsic reason for doing it,\nbut you're adding a reason to try it.\nSo actually, if we go to a\ndifferent domain for a second.\nSo, look at kids who don't\nwant to eat their vegetables.\nExtrinsic incentives are very effective\nto get kids to try vegetables\nfor the first time.\nBut then the hope is that they\ndiscover a vegetable or two\nthat they don't mind,\nand then they find\nreasons to keep doing it.\nAnd I think that that's how I\nwant a lot of rewards to work.\nI don't think that rewards\nshould be carrots that we dangle\nto try to control people's behavior.\nI think they should be symbols\nof how much we appreciate and\nvalue a particular behavior.\nAnd if you frame them that way,\nit's a lot easier for people to say,\n\"Yeah, you know what, I'm,\nthat reward is something\nthat I really want,\nbut I'm not only doing\nthe task for that reward.\"\nYeah, that you basically\nanswered the question\nI was going to ask, which is,\nand you know, at risk\nof sounding new agey,\nbut we are sitting in California.\nI could imagine that\nwhen one is focused on\nthe extrinsic rewards,\nso a physical task or cognitive task\nfor an extrinsic reward,\nif I'm focusing on the extrinsic reward,\nI'm also, air quotes again, not present.\nRight? I'm thinking about the outcome.\nI'm not thinking about process.\nAnd I think there's,\nperhaps you can flesh out\nsome of what this is exactly,\nbut I think there's a\nfairly extensive data\nto support the idea\nthat when we are physically and\nmentally present to the task\nthat we're going to perform better.\nAnd presumably our intrinsic\nliking of that task,\nor performing that\ntask, increases as well.\nIs that true?\nYeah, I think so.\nI think, so if we want to\nbreak down the mechanisms\nfor why intrinsic motivation\nis useful for performance.\nOne you touched on earlier,\nit's focus of attention.\nYou're, it's much easier to find flow\nwhen you're intrinsically motivated.\nYou get into that state of deep absorption\nwhere time melts away.\nSo you mentioned, you know, sort of\neither speeding up or slowing\ndown your sense of time.\nYou forget where you are.\nSometimes you even lose\ntrack of your identity\nand you're just merged into the task.\nAnd so that concentration is helpful.\nThere's also a, a greater\npersistence effect\nthat when you enjoy what you're doing,\nyou're less likely to give\nup in the face of obstacles.\nYou're more likely to think about it\nwhen you're not doing the task\nand come up with great ideas.\nAnd so, you know, I think\nthere's a working harder,\nthere's a working longer,\nthere's a working smarter,\nand there's also a thinking\nmore clearly effect.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
