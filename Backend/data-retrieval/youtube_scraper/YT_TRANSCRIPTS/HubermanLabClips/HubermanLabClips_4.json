    "transcript": "I love Gabor Mate's definition of trauma.\n\"It's not what happens to you;\nit's what happens inside of you,\" right?\nSo, to me, there's an\ninherent relationality there\nwhere events that get processed,\nnot any event.\nEvents with high emotionality, let's say,\nthat get processed in aloneness\nbecome traumatic,\nand I think that's where it\ngets linked to responsibility.\nSo, this is actually what\nmy TED talk was about\nand why repair is so important.\nWho said this?\nRonald Fairbairn years ago,\nthat for kids,\nit is better to be a sinner\nin a world ruled by God\nthan to live in a world\nruled by the devil.\nI think it explains almost everything\nabout child development right there,\ngoing back to goodness also.\nYour parent just screamed at you,\nand by the way, your parent.\nI scream at my kids.\nEveryone's going to scream at their kids.\nIt's going to happen, okay?\nThat's just the event.\nThe event's not going to have the impact.\nWhat is happening for a kid?\nWell, we know kids are\noriented by attachment.\nThey literally need us to survive.\nLike, they could not survive on their own.\nAnd so what do you do\nwhen the person you're\ndependent on for safety\nbecomes the source of danger and threat?\nThat's very confusing for\na child in that moment.\nSo, they're super hyper aroused,\nthey're in this state\nof, you know, terror,\nand then usually after, in my house too,\nI just yell at my kid.\nThey're kind of alone in their room.\nI'm alone in the kitchen or wherever,\nmeanwhile spinning,\nlike, \"I'm such a bad parent.\"\nLike, I'm, you know,\nbut meanwhile, because I'm\nso lost in my own guilt,\nI might not be going to my kid,\nand so what happens for my kid\nif I don't repair after I scream at them\nor one of these events, right?\nWell, a kid cannot say to themselves,\n\"My parent just had a bad day.\"\nThen the badness is in my parent.\nMy leader.\nI'm young now, right?\nLike, I don't understand nuance.\nMy leader can't be bad,\nso I must take on the badness.\nAt least then I have control.\nSo kids, after they're kind of yelled at,\nin the absence of repair,\nthey really only have two options\nfor how to regulate and feel safe again.\nThey can self-blame. \"It's all my fault.\"\nWhich is why I feel like most adults,\nwhen they have a hard time,\nthey tell themselves,\nlike, \"It's my fault.\nI'm not good enough.\"\nIt's like the legacy of\nthat story from childhood.\nOr they use self-doubt.\n\"Maybe that didn't happen.\nMaybe I overreacted.\nMaybe I can't trust myself.\"\nAgain, it leads to adults\nwho basically say, like,\n\"Did I overreact, or let\nme call five friends.\nLet me see if they think\nwhat my boyfriend did\nwas a big deal,\"\n'cause they can't trust themselves.\nAnd so trauma, what I\nwant every parent to know\nis they'll say, \"I left my kid alone\nand I didn't pick them\nup at the soccer field.\nIs that going to traumatize them?\"\nAnd I'll say, \"Well,\nthat's just the event.\nLike, did you say to them,\n'Hey, that probably felt scary.\nWhat was that like?\nOh, you're right. Like, you were alone.'\"\nNow, all of a sudden, next\nto the event that was scary\nis my story and my connection.\nIt got processed in a safe connection.\nIt didn't get processed in aloneness,\nand that's a massive, massive difference.\nIn this scenario you are describing,\nthe parent who yelled goes to the child,\nhaving been that child,\nand perhaps also having been that parent,\nhow do we deal with the fact\nthat sometimes, you know,\nwe don't want to be around\nthe person that yelled at us.\nIt hurts to receive the care.\nOr there's a,\nthere's a, like, a textured landscape\nas opposed to a smooth landscape there.\nLike, like, \"Okay.\nNow you're ready for\neverything to be peaceful.\nI'm still with my feelings.\"\nI guess that's where the\n\"I believe you\" comes in,\nand that's where the sorting\nit through process begins.\nIs that right?\nWell, I think it's, like,\nwhat version of a parent comes back to me,\nthe first thing we have\nto do in a repair process\nis actually repair with\nourselves as a parent.\nReally.\nBecause if you haven't\nrepaired with yourself,\nwhich to me is kind of\nseparating your identity, again,\nfrom your behavior.\nLike, \"Okay, Becky.\" I'll\nuse myself as an example.\n\"I'm a good parent who\njust screamed at her son.\nLike, I did not mess up forever.\"\nAnd you see, when you try\nto repair with yourself,\nthose two things get collapsed.\nI'm like, \"I messed him\nup forever. I'm a monster.\nWait, like, I'm a good parent\nwho did something I'm not proud of.\"\nYou can't repair with someone\nuntil you've repaired with yourself.\nThey feel it from you.\nThey actually,\nit usually is, like, then\nyou're asking for them.\nI'll be like, \"It's okay, right?\nLike, you forgive me, right?\"\nThat's not a repair.\nThat's, like, using your child\nto try to do something we\njust have to do on our own\nor with other adults.\nBut if I've repaired with myself,\nI'm going to show up in a different way.\nMight have a feisty kid, I might, like,\n\"I don't care.\nIt's not better.\"\n\"That's okay.\"\nI'm not repairing to get\nsomething from my child.\nI'm repairing to give\nan experience to them.\nSo, we can also get creative.\nYou know, your kid is older,\nyou text them, you slip\na door under the note.\nYou say, \"Okay, I just have\nto say this one thing.\"\nTo me, this line really matters\nto, like, snatch that\nself-blame out of a kid's body\nis just, like, \"I'm sorry I yelled.\nIt's never your fault when I yell.\"\nAnd it's not, and people who argue,\nlike, our ability to regulate our emotions\npredated our child's existence.\nLike, that, you know?\nLike, they had something,\nthey did something,\nand we felt frustrated,\nbut that's very different\nthan yelling, right?\nAnd saying that to your\nkid is so important.\nMeanwhile, the next day, you might say,\n\"By the way, let's really figure out\nhow to get out the door\nin a smoother way.\"\nYou know, you could work on\nwhatever they need to work on.\nBut the reason I think most kids\nend up rejecting parents' apologies\nis it's not really repair.\nWe are asking our kid for\npermission to be okay again,\nor our repair sounds like,\n\"Hey, I'm sorry I yelled,\nbut you know, like, if you\njust got ready in time,\nthat wouldn't have happened,\"\nor we say, \"I'm sorry you felt that way.\nI'm sorry you felt that way.\"\nThose are not, like, none of\nthose are actually repairs,\nand if that's what a kid's been used to,\nthey're going to keep\na parent more at bay.\nSo, is it safe to say that\nwe can always come back\nto making the kid feel real and safe?\n\"I believe you\" is a great place to start,\nand the reason I keep coming\nback to these simple things\nis that,\nsimple but very, very potent, by the way,\nis that in the real world landscape\nof parenting, family, and life,\nthings are happening really fast,\nand it's very dynamic,\nand it's multifaceted.\nI mean, we haven't even talked yet about\nhow when there's two parents.\nLike, the one that didn't yell.\nWhen there's multiple siblings.\nI mean, there's, you know, human dynamics\nin a other other landscape is hard enough,\nand then when you start introducing\nthe real-world landscape,\nthings happen fast,\nso having something that people\ncan reach to really quickly,\nwhat I call in the landscape\nof stress modulation,\nwhich is something that\nI'm more familiar with\nfrom my lab's work,\nis, you know, real-time tools.\nYup.\nReal-time tools.\nLike, we're all at our best\nafter meditation, vacation, massage,\nand a good night's sleep,\nbut what about real-time tools\nwhen everything's hectic?\nSo, what does a really\ngood apology look like\nin the real world?\nYeah.\nBecause a really good apology\nin the ideal world of Instagram\nis,\n\"Yeah, I believe you.\nI'm so sorry,\"\nwith no buts, no this and that.\nBut a real apology sometimes\nis as you're boarding a plane\nor when there's a bunch of\nother things that are going on\nand you haven't even dealt with those yet,\nor when you're on your way to an event\nor you, okay, so you get it.\nWhat does a really good internal landscape\nfor apology look like?\nLike, how can we touch\ninto where we need to be?\nAnd then what are the words\nthat even if we have to try again later,\nand again and again\nlater with that person,\nin this case, kid, but\nperson more generally,\nwhat's the, like, go-to solid apology?\nRight.\nSo yeah, I think you are\nnever going to go wrong\nsaying, \"I believe you,\" to your kid.\nLike, obviously not if\nyou say it randomly,\nbut if they're really upset,\n\"You yelled at me,\"\n\"I believe you.\"\nLike, if that's all you can\nremember, you're crushing it.\nI think a realistic repair,\nyou have to do something for yourself,\nand, like, to me, it can\nbe a very simple mantra.\nLike, to me, \"I'm a good parent\nwho is having a hard time,\"\nis the one I use honestly.\nOver and over, just,\nand after I yell at my kid,\nbefore, I'll, like, go\nto the bathroom sometimes\nand I'll say that to myself.\n\"Becky, like, I'm a good\nparent having a hard time.\"\nAnd I'll kind of say it\nas many times as I need\nuntil I really do feel something, like,\nshift a little in my body.\nIt just,\n'cause again, I think that phrase\nseparates what I did from who I am, right?\nAnd then to me, a realistic apology,\nit could be super simple.\nIf you remember nothing\nelse, you could just be like,\n\"I'm sorry I yelled.\"\nThat's great.\nIf you want to, if you're\nlike, \"I'm feeling it, Becky.\nGive me that next step.\"\n\"I'm,\" you know, \"I'm sorry I yelled.\nJust like you, I'm working\non managing my emotions,\nand you know, next time,\neven when I'm frustrated, I'm\ngoing to try to stay calm.\"\nSomething about the next time.\nYou know, if you want to throw\nin that it's not your fault.\nKids, it seems an odd thing,\nbecause parents are like, \"Why?\nDo kids assume it's their fault?\"\nIt is their default position,\nand so it's never a bad thing to throw in,\nbut honestly, just simply,\n\"Hey, I'm sorry I yelled\"?\nThat actually gives them that realness,\nbecause without saying anything more,\nyou're saying that thing you\nthink happened did happen,\nso that's powerful.\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat you just viewed,\nplease check out the full-length\nepisode by clicking here."
