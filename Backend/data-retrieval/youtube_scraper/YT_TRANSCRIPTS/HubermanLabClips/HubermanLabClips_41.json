    "transcript": "Exercise snacks.\nAnd as the name suggests,\nthis is a fun one\nand was suggested by Dr. Andy Galpin\nas a way to either enhance\nor maintain your fitness\ndepending on how your core\nor foundational fitness program is going.\nSo when I say core, I don't mean your abs.\nI mean whether or not you're\ngetting your regular cardio\nand your regular resistance training.\nIf you were to add one\nor several of these\nexercise snacks per week,\nit can further improve\nthings like VO2 max,\nmuscular endurance, et cetera.\nI'll talk about the specific snacks\nthat you will be doing in a moment.\nHowever, as Dr. Andy\nGalpin also pointed out,\nthere are times in which we happen\nto not be following our\nfoundational fitness program,\neither because work\ndemands or family demands\nor we're traveling, we're\nsimply not keeping up\nwith our basic routine.\nAnd under those conditions,\nexercise snacks are a terrific\nway to maintain the fitness\nthat you've already built and developed,\nand you don't lose any ground in a week,\nsay, where you get particularly busy.\nNow, exercise snacks can take on a variety\nof different forms,\nbut for sake of simplicity and clarity,\ntoday, we're going to divide\nthem into two major categories.\nThe first category are exercise snacks\nthat are going to improve or maintain\nyour cardiovascular fitness.\nSo your ability to run or cycle or row,\nsome distance, say, you know,\n12 minutes or longer, okay?\nBut keep in mind these exercise\nsnacks are very, very brief.\nThey don't require that you do them\nfor 12 minutes or longer.\nWhat they're going to\ndo is either maintain\nor enhance the type of\nendurance that allows you\nto continue in an activity\nfor 12 minutes or longer.\nThe second category of exercise snack\nrelates to muscular endurance.\nMuscular endurance is a very\nimportant aspect of fitness,\nand even though some\npeople are already training\nfor muscular endurance,\nit's something that most people\nare not doing enough training for.\nMuscular endurance is your ability, say\nto maintain a wall sit\nor to maintain a plank,\nor to do the maximum number of pushups\nthat you can do in one session,\nthe sort of, you know, drop to the floor\nand gimme as many pushups as\nyou possibly can type of thing,\nor as many situps as\nyou can type of thing.\nMuscular endurance translates to a number\nof other aspects of fitness,\nand it's something that we\nshould all be working on.\nAnd again, many people\njust don't make space\nfor it in their regular routine.\nSo now we have these two\ncategories of exercise snacks.\nOne geared toward enhancing\nor maintaining your cardiovascular fitness\nas it translates to longer\nduration endurance activity.\nSo 12 minutes or longer.\nAnd then the other category\nis purely muscular endurance,\nwhich is essentially some\nabout of exercise that's going\nto be fairly brief anywhere\nfrom a minute to two minutes,\nbut certainly less than 12 minutes.\nOkay, so let me give you an\nexample of an exercise snack\nfor enhancing your long\nduration endurance.\n12 minutes or longer.\nAnd this is the sort of thing\nthat if you are going to\nincorporate into routine,\nand I highly recommend that you do,\ncan essentially be done\nanytime with no warmup.\nA good example of an exercise\nsnack of this type would be\nto suddenly stand up from your desk\nand to do a hundred jumping jacks.\nNow, depending on how fit you are\nand how fast you do those jumping jacks\nand how wide, and you know tall,\nyou do those jumping jacks,\nmeaning, you know, are you doing\nthese kind of little things\nwhere your hands don't actually meet\nand your hand like parting\nyour legs just a little bit.\nOr are you doing full jumping jacks,\nor really jumping and you know,\nsetting your feet out as wide\nas you comfortably and safely can,\nand then bringing your hands together.\nIt could take you anywhere\nfrom 30 seconds to 90 seconds, okay?\nSo in the case of jumping jacks,\nyou may end up doing this for 90 seconds,\nbut the point is to simply\ndo 100 jumping jacks,\nor if that takes too long,\nyou could even do just\n25 or 50 jumping jacks.\nThe point is that it's going\nto get you moving your muscles,\nit's going to get your\nheart rate up, okay?\nEven if you're very, very fit.\nIf you're doing these fast enough\nand you're doing them with proper form,\nit's going to get your heart\nrate up and then you're done.\nYou can sit back down to your desk\nor you can continue to\nwalk through the airport.\nYes, I've done these in the airport,\ntypically not while walking\ntoward my gate, but at the gate,\nbut occasionally I'm feeling lethargic\nor I haven't had the\nopportunity to train that day,\nand perhaps I won't get\nthe opportunity to train.\nSo I'll do something\nlike 100 jumping jacks\nwhile, you know, facing the window\nso it feels a little less awkward\nfacing people while you're doing them.\nAnd of course, you don't\nhave to do jumping jacks.\nAn equally effective\ntype of exercise snack is\nto find a stairwell\nand to simply go up that stairwell\nas fast as you safely can\nfor 20 to 30 seconds.\nSo perhaps just find the\nbottom of a stairwell\nand go up that stairwell\nas quickly as you can,\nand perhaps go down as quickly as you can\nand just keep doing that\nfor about 20 to 40 seconds,\nand then you're essentially done, okay?\nYou could also opt to pick some\ndistance away from your car\nin the parking lot,\nyou know, assuming you're not carrying\nany heavy bags or anything,\nand simply run to your car.\nSo 20 to 30 seconds of not\nnecessarily all out sprinting,\nyou don't want to injure yourself\nbecause again, this is\ndone without a warmup.\nThese exercise snacks are designed\nto be inserted into your day\nand into your week, essentially at random.\nYou could plan them if you want,\nbut anytime you feel inspired,\nor perhaps anytime you're feeling\nlike you don't want to do one,\nyou could simply do one\nof these exercise snacks\nand of course, doing jumping jacks\nor running to your car\nor taking the stairs\nvery quickly up and down\nor just up and then\nwalking down, for instance,\nand doing a few jumping jacks.\nThings of that sort\nof course can take on\na near infinite number\nof different variations.\nSo if you don't like any of the variations\nthat I just presented,\nyou can easily come up\nwith something else.\nAgain, the purpose of\nthese exercise snacks is\nto get your heart rate up.\nIt's of course to do this\nwhile not getting injured,\nand it is entirely compatible\nwith an existing exercise program.\nIt in no way is going to\nimpede your performance\nin strength or hypertrophy\nor other forms of long form endurance\nor high intensity interval training,\nquite to the contrary.\nEverything we know about\nthese exercise snacks is that\nthey enhance various\naspects of your physiology\nin ways that promote\nboth recovery performance\nin your other types of exercise\nand your other types\nof athletic endeavors.\nSo, no reason to think that\nthey are going to be\nproblematic for your training,\nbut of course, don't trip, don't fall.\nDon't undertake a movement that puts you\ninto a range of motion that has you\nhurting your back or your knee\nor any other part of your body.\nYou know, start off slowly\nand find something that\nreally works for you.\nSo these are very easy.\nThey take very little time.\nThey're fun to be honest,\nand as was discussed in the conversation\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin,\nthey're also very effective.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
