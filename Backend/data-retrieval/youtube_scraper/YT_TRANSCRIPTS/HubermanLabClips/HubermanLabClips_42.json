    "transcript": "Now the list of tools\nI'm about to describe is not exhaustive,\nmeaning it doesn't even\nbegin to come close\nto the total number of\ntools that one could glean\nfrom the discussion about\nnutrition and supplementation\nthat I had with Dr. Andy\nGalpin on this podcast.\nBut they are the major ones\nthat are definitely worth knowing.\nAnd those include supplementing\nwith omega-3 fatty acids.\nNow, omega-3 fatty acids are\nfound, of course, in foods,\nthings like fatty fish\nand krill of all things,\ncertain forms of algae, et cetera.\nBut most people do not get enough of\nso-called EPA form of omega-3s.\nAnd for that reason,\nI and many other people\nchoose to supplement\nwith a minimum of one gram per day,\nand in some cases as high\nas two grams per day,\nof omega-3s in supplement form.\nSo typically one would get\nto one to two grams of EPA\nby supplementing their nutrition,\ntheir diet that is,\nwith fish oil capsules or liquid fish oil.\nThere are many different sources of these\nthat was discussed in an episode\nthat I did with the Dr. Rhonda Patrick.\nI find that it's most cost efficient\nto get that one to two grams\nof EPAs from liquid fish oil.\nDespite what you might\nsee on the internet,\nI don't have any relationship whatsoever\nto a liquid fish oil company.\nYou just want to make sure that\nyou go with a reputable brand.\nI like the ones that\nare flavored with lemon\nso that it offsets the taste of fish oil.\nAnd I'll take a tablespoon\nor two of that per day.\nAnd if I'm traveling,\nand even if I'm not, I will\noften use fish oil capsules.\nAnd there are a variety\nof different sources of those as well.\nGetting sufficient amounts\nof omega-3 has been shown\nto be important for mood.\nOkay, so as a way to offset depression,\nbut also for enhancing overall mood.\nThat probably relates\nto the omega-3s effect\non neurotransmission,\nnot just for neuromodulators\nlike serotonin and dopamine,\nbut for all neurotransmission.\nAnd neurotransmission, of course,\nis essential for\nneuromuscular performance.\nAnd the omega-3s have been implicated\nin reducing the inflammation response,\ncardiovascular health, et cetera.\nI realize that there is\nsome debate about omega-3s,\nbut when I look at the bulk of literature\nabout the omega-3,\nit's very clear to me\nthat getting one to two grams\nof EPA form of omega-3 per day\nis the right thing for me to do.\nAnd many others find that as well.\nThe second tool to enhance your\nfitness under this category\nof nutrition and\nsupplementation is creatine.\nNow again, creatine is not\njust found in supplement form.\nIt's also found, of course, in foods,\nin particular red meat.\nHowever, the amount of red\nmeat that one would have to eat\nin order to get the amount of creatine,\nthat one would start to see\na real performance enhancing\neffect is just far too high.\nYou'd be ingesting far too much\nof other things in red meat\nthat you wouldn't want that much of.\nAnd for that reason,\nI and many other people\nwill take creatine daily.\nWe now know there's no need\nto so-called load creatine\nin the old days, as it were.\nSo old days, by the way,\nmeaning mid-'90s and 2000s.\nWe were all told that\nwe had to load creatine.\nWe had to take high dose\ncreatine for four or five days,\nand then you could back\noff to a maintenance dose.\nNow it's very clear you can\ntake a daily dose of creatine,\nand that it really doesn't matter\nwhen you take that creatine.\nYou could take it post-workout\nas many people do.\nYou could take it pre-workout.\nIt really doesn't seem to matter.\nI happen to take it post-workout\njust as a matter of habit.\nBut again, you could\ntake it any time of day.\nNow, the point I want to\nmake about creatine is\none that's a bit different\nthan the other discussions out there.\nI have no issue with the majority\nof what's discussed\nabout creatine out there.\nFor instance, that creatine monohydrate is\nthe most effective form.\nFortunately, creatine monohydrate is\nalso the least expensive form of creatine\nthat's sold out there.\nI see no evidence whatsoever\nthat the other forms of\ncreatine are superior\nto creatine monohydrate.\nBut what you'll usually hear is\nthat taking five grams of\ncreatine monohydrate per day\nis ideal for everybody.\nAnd that advice is\nsimply not well informed\nby the scientific literature.\nIf you are a larger person,\nso for instance, I weigh 100 kilograms.\nSo that's about 220 pounds.\nWell, it turns out,\nif you look at the literature on creatine\nand athletic performance,\nand if you look at the literature\non creatine and cognitive performance,\nbecause as some of you already know,\ncreatine is a fuel,\nor the phosphocreatine\nsystem is a fuel system\nfor the brain as well.\nAnd if you look at the\nstudies on creatine,\nthey almost always gauge\nthe amount of creatine\nto give an individual\nbased on their body weight.\nSo you don't have to get\nreally specific about this.\nBut if you weigh, say,\n185 pounds to 250 pounds,\nyou can get away with\nand probably should be\ntaking 10 grams or so\nof creatine per day, which is what I do.\nWhereas if you weigh less than that,\nfive grams or maybe even\nthree grams is sufficient.\nNow, I discussed this with Dr. Andy Galpin\nduring that series,\nand one of the things\nthat I've started to do\nsince the closure of that series is\nto take more creatine per day.\nSo now I'm taking 10,\nsometimes even as much as 15\ngrams per day of creatine.\nAgain, this is powdered\ncreatine monohydrate.\nMy stomach tolerates it very well.\nBut frankly, I don't\ntend to get stomach aches\nor gastric distress from\npretty much anything\nunless it's, you know, some\nform of food poisoning,\nwhich is exceedingly rare for me.\nSo some people out there find\nthat creatine really disrupts their gut\nand they need to take it with food,\nor they really need to slowly increase\nthe amount of creatine that\nthey're taking each day.\nI find that I can put 10, even\n15 grams of creatine into a,\nyou know, whey protein shake\nor into some water with a\nlittle bit of lemon juice\njust to make it taste\na little less chalky.\nYou drink that,\nand I don't have any\ngastric distress from that.\nSo you'll need to find what works for you.\nBut the point here is if\nyou're going to take creatine,\nyou don't just want to \"take creatine,\"\nyou know, one scoop per day.\nYou really want to adjust\nthe amount of creatine\nthat you're ingesting\naccording to your body weight.\nAnd I would give you a\nvery specific formula\nof x grams of creatine per\nkilogram or pound of body weight.\nBut believe it or not,\nno such specific recommendation\nhas ever been published\nin the scientific literature.\nAt least I couldn't find it\nin a way that's consistent\nwith all the other papers,\nmeaning you see a lot of variation.\nSo what I'm talking about here is\nif you weigh 185 pounds or so,\nokay, plus or minus 5 pounds,\nout to about 250 pounds,\n10 to 15 grams of creatine per day is\nprobably more appropriate\nfor you than is 5 grams,\nmeaning it's going to be more effective\nfor enhancing physical\nperformance and perhaps,\nagain, perhaps even cognitive\nperformance as well.\nAnd if you're somebody\nwho weighs, you know,\n180 pounds down to, say, 130 pounds,\n5 grams of creatine per\nday is probably sufficient.\nThe point here is if\nyou are taking creatine,\nagain, not everyone has to take creatine.\nThere's no law that says that\nyou have to take creatine.\nSome people don't like it.\nI know some people fear it's\ngoing to make their hair fall out.\nWe already talked about\nthat in previous episodes\nand the lack of data to support that idea.\nBut I realize some people\nsteer away from creatine\nfor whatever reason.\nBut if you decide that taking\ncreatine is right for you,\nadjust the total amount\nof creatine that you take\naccording to your body weight.\nThe next supplementation-based tool\nfor enhancing your\nfitness is rhodiola rosea.\nNow, this very esoteric\nsounding supplement is\none that I learned about\nboth from Dr. Layne Norton\nwhen he was a guest on this podcast,\nexpert in nutrition,\nand, frankly, training as it\nrelates to resistance training,\nand from Dr. Andy Galpin.\nRhodiola rosea is a supplement\nthat's gaining increasing attention\nbecause it is what's called\na cortisol modulator.\nIt does not necessarily suppress cortisol.\nIt does not increase cortisol.\nIt's a cortisol modulator.\nAnd frankly the mechanism\nby which rhodiola rosea\nmodulates cortisol is\nstill under investigation.\nI hope to do an episode\nabout it in the future,\nat least make it part of an episode\nbecause the hypothesized mechanism\nthat's starting to emerge\nis really interesting\nas it relates to neurons in the brain\nthat control the stress\nresponse and glands in the body\nlike the adrenals that\ncontrol the stress response\nand that secrete cortisol.\nRegardless, there's a\ngrowing body of research\nthat has explored rhodiola\nrosea supplementation,\nand one's subjective perception\nof fatigue or output during\nhigh-intensity training\nof various kinds,\nboth resistance training,\nas well as running and\nendurance type training.\nSo I started taking rhodiola\nrosea about six months ago\nin response to conversations that I had,\nagain, with Dr. Layne Norton\nand with Dr. Andy Galpin.\nAnd it's a supplement\nthat I take before\nhigh-intensity workouts.\nSo I don't take it before a run,\nbecause frankly my run's\neither very long and slow,\nor they're very brief,\nlike a high-intensity\ninterval training session,\nand I find those to be\npretty easy to recover from,\neven though they are very intense.\nI might take a rhodiola rosea supplement\nbefore doing a 30-minute\nhill run that's very intense.\nBut typically, I only take\nit about 10 to 15 minutes\nbefore any sort of high-intensity,\nresistance training session,\nin particular, my leg day,\nwhich falls on day two\nof my exercise protocol,\nor the torso day, or the\nsmall body parts day.\nAgain, here I'm referencing the way\nthat I train across the week,\nand you can find that training protocol\nas a downloadable,\ncompletely zero-cost PDF if you like.\nBut I realize other people are using\ndifferent body parts splits\nand different combinations\nof resistance training\nand endurance training.\nThe reason I mentioned rhodiola\nrosea in this episode is\nthat I realized that\nwhile some people might not\nyet be supplementing omega-3s,\nthey might not be supplementing creatine,\nthere are many of you who are\nalready doing those things\nand you're looking for additional\ntools to give you an edge.\nSo again, the rhodiola\nrosea would not fall\ninto the category of\nfoundational supplements.\nCertainly get your nutrition\nright, get your sleep right,\nget your sunlight, all\nthe basics first, please,\nbefore even thinking\nabout any supplements.\nHowever, once you get into\nthe category of supplements\nthat can enhance fitness,\nrhodiola rosea does seem\nto have some good research\nto support it in the context\nof lots of different forms\nof high-intensity exercise.\nNow, I can't tell you whether\nor not it's purely subjective\nor whether or not it's\nobjective and subjective,\nbut my experience has been that\nwhen I take rhodiola rosea,\nI definitely notice that\nI can exert myself harder\nwithout feeling like I'm bringing myself\nto the brink of fatigue\neither during the exertion or afterwards.\nIn other words,\nI feel like I can do more work\nwithout feeling so exhausted,\nand I feel\nas if I'm recovering from\nmy workouts more quickly,\nin particular across the\nday after my workouts.\nIn fact, if I had to cite one\nspecific subjective effect\nthat I've experienced\nfrom taking rhodiola rosea\nbefore very high-intensity workouts is\nthat prior to taking it,\nI would often find that\nthree or four hours\nafter the workout,\nhaving eaten a good meal,\ntaking a shower, et cetera,\nand I was tired.\nI have a real dip in energy.\nBut now I notice I have a lot\nof energy throughout the day,\neven after these very\nhigh-intensity sessions\nin the early part of the day.\nAnd frankly, I haven't\nchanged anything else\nabout my supplementation or my nutrition,\nat least nothing major.\nSo I personally am going to\ncontinue to take rhodiola rosea\nbefore these high-intensity workouts.\nSo for me, that's about two\nor three times per week.\nHowever, if I forgot\nto take rhodiola rosea\nbefore a workout,\nI have no reason to think\nthat that workout would go much worse.\nThis is a supplement that is designed\nto sort of give you an edge,\nto be able to exert\nmore focus and intensity\nduring your workouts,\nwith less perceived exertion,\nand to enhance your recovery.\nThe typical dosage of rhodiola rosea\nthat you'll find in most supplements is\n100 to 200 milligrams.\nAnd of course,\nanytime you're going to\ntake a new supplement,\nyou would be wise to figure\nout the lowest effective dose\nfrom that supplement.\nThat's just logic, right?\nWhy spend more money\ntaking more of something\nthat you don't need more of\nif you could get away\nwith taking less of it\nand it's just as effective,\nmaybe even more effective?\nSo I typically will take\n100 to 200 milligrams\nof rhodiola rosea about 10 to\n20 minutes before a workout.\nHowever, I've taken as\nlittle as 100 milligrams\non a consistent basis.\nAnd frankly, I don't really\nexperience much difference\nwhether I take 100 milligrams\nor I take 200 milligrams\nbefore a workout.\nSo lately I've just defaulted\nto taking 100 milligrams of rhodiola rosea\nbefore any high-intensity workout.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
