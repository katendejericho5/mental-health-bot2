    "transcript": "Now, some of you may already\nbe doing low repetition,\npure strength work, but I\nbelieve that most people don't.\nMost people who do resistance training\nare using either machines or free weights\nor some combination of those,\nor perhaps are using body weight.\nAnd they tend to focus\non repetition ranges\nfrom about five and usually\nmore like six repetitions\nout to about 10 and\nperhaps 15 repetitions.\nNow, of course, doing resistance training\nin repetition ranges of\nfive to 15 reps per set\nprovided it's done at\nsufficient intensity,\nso either to failure or close to failure,\nof course, in good form,\nis tremendously beneficial.\nIt can help build strength,\nit can enhance hypertrophy.\nThere is tremendous value\nto training in those repetition ranges.\nBut when I sat down with Dr. Andy Galpin\nto discuss resistance\ntraining specifically,\nhe made it very clear that\nat least for some portion\nof one's yearly training\ncycle, so perhaps eight weeks\nor 10 weeks, or in the case\nthat I adopted it, 12 weeks,\nthere is tremendous benefit\nto training in the three\nto five repetition range\nand maybe even lower.\nSo the second tool of\ntraining specifically\nfor strength in this three\nto five repetition range\nis something that I started\nto incorporate after I sat\ndown to record that series.\nAnd I'll just tell you a few\nof the benefits that I've experienced\nand then I'll tell you\nthe specific protocol\nthat makes it very easy to do this.\nThe most obvious benefit to me\nwas that I got much stronger\nand that that strength persisted\nsuch that when I went back\nto using higher repetition ranges,\nso typically I train\nwith weights or machines\nin the six to 10 repetition range,\nsometimes a little higher,\nsometimes a little lower,\nbut never before had I\nspecifically trained in the three\nto five repetition range exclusively\nfor a period of 10 to 12 weeks.\nAnd when I did that, I of\ncourse gained strength,\nbut that strength stayed with\nme such that when I returned\nto higher repetition ranges,\nI could use more weight in good form.\nAnd that, of course, enhanced strength\nand hypertrophy further.\nIn addition, there was\nanother effect that was,\nat least to me, very unexpected, which was\nthat my cardiovascular training\nimproved significantly.\nNow, why would this be?\nBecause typically a three\nto five repetition set\ndoes not elevate the\nheart rate for long enough\nthat you would consider it\ncardiovascular training.\nAnd of course, the rest periods\nbetween those sets is pretty long as well.\nSo even if heart rate goes\nup during those heavy sets,\nit's going to go down\nduring those long three\nto five minute rest\nperiods between those sets.\nBut what I noticed was\nthat my overall posture\nand my ability to maintain\ncardiovascular output\nwhile using good running form\nor good rowing form was\nalso vastly improved.\nAnd the logical interpretation\nof why that would be\nis simply that the muscles got stronger\nand those same muscles\nare being incorporated\ninto the cardiovascular,\nlet's call it endurance work\nthat I'm doing on other days.\nAnd therefore, I can carry out\nthose cardiovascular training sessions\nin better form for longer periods of time.\nI actually felt much stronger\nduring my cardiovascular training\nas I got much stronger moving\nthese heavier weight loads\nfor low repetition sets.\nAnd then the third specific\nbenefit that I noticed\nis that when training heavy for three\nto five repetitions per\nset, I didn't get sore.\nAnd this to me was an incredible benefit\nbecause typically when I\ntrain in the six repetition\nto 15 repetition range and\nI take those sets to failure\nor near failure, I do experience\nsome soreness the next day.\nOrdinarily that soreness isn't so intense\nthat it prevents me from doing any\nof the other sorts of workouts that I do.\nAnd for those of you that have visited\nthat Foundational Fitness Protocol,\nyou know that I hit each\nmajor and minor muscle group\nonce per week directly as well\nas once per week indirectly,\nthat's the overall\nstructure of that program,\nin order to allow sufficient recovery\nbetween those resistance training workouts\nto be able to make continual progress.\nNow, by training in this three\nto five repetition range that\nDr. Andy Galpin suggested,\nI was able to improve my strength,\nimprove my cardiovascular\noutput, reduce soreness,\nI also just felt better overall,\nI had a lot more energy\nafter those workouts\nthan I typically do\nafter my resistance training sessions\nwhen I use higher repetition ranges.\nThere are just a number\nof different things\nthat made me feel, wow, this\nis really a powerful protocol.\nAnd of course, moving heavier weights\nin the gym feels good too.\nIt feels good to get stronger.\nAt least there's a positive\nfeedback loop there for me,\nand I think for most people.\nAnd I should also mention\nthat for those of you\nthat are averse to doing\nheavier resistance training\nin the three to five repetition range\nbecause you fear that it will\nmake you too big or too bulky,\ntraining in the low repetition ranges\nis actually more geared\ntowards increasing strength\nand is shifting away somewhat\nfrom increasing hypertrophy\nor muscle size.\nSo that's a great benefit for those of you\nthat want to be strong and also want\nto maintain cardiovascular fitness,\nbut you don't want to add muscular size.\nAnd of course for all of you\nthat want to add muscular size,\nit's well established that\nincreasing your strength\nwill allow you then to return\nto patterns of hypertrophy training\nthat will allow you to\nuse heavier weights,\nand therefore induce greater hypertrophy.\nSo there are, oh, so many reasons\nto incorporate these\nstrength training protocols.\nSo the way that Dr. Andy\nGalpin suggested one do it\nand was the way that I did it\nis use this three by five protocol.\nThe three by five protocol\nis very straightforward.\nIt involves doing three to five\nexercises per workout, okay?\nSo if it's a workout for legs,\nit's three to five exercises.\nIf it's a workout for\nsome upper body muscle,\nit's three to five exercises.\nThree to five exercises for\nthree to five sets per exercise,\nthree to five repetitions per set,\nand three to five minutes\nof rest between each set.\nIn addition, he emphasized\nthat one can do those workouts\nthree to five times per week,\nalthough I'm going to put in asterisk next\nto that last statement because I found\nthat I couldn't do the\nthree by five protocol\nsay for legs specifically\nthree to five times per week.\nI realized that might be\npossible for some people,\nbut I'm somebody who, like\nmany of you out there,\neither doesn't have the time\nor doesn't have the recovery\ncapacity to train my legs three\nto five times per week,\neven though I acknowledge\nthat there are probably ways to do that\nthat would still allow me to\nrecover, it just simply starts\nto impede into other areas of training.\nIt starts to impede other areas\nof life like work and family\nand sleep and all the rest.\nSo what I did, and what\nI'm suggesting you try,\nis for any existing resistance\ntraining that you're doing\nto take a period of eight\nor 10 or ideally 12 weeks\nand do the vast majority,\nif not all of that resistance training,\nin the lower repetition range\nthat's designed specifically\nto induce strength adaptations\nand to not pay attention to whether\nor not you're hitting that\nsame muscle group three\nto five times per week.\nRather, if you train your\nlegs once or twice per week,\nto simply do all of the work for your legs\nin that three to five repetition range.\nIf you train an upper body\nmuscle or muscle groups,\nchest, shoulders, back once\nper week or twice per week,\nto just stay within that\nthree to five repetition range\nfor those work sets, right?\nWarmups can include a few more reps.\nAnd then to adhere to this,\nthree to five exercises,\nthree to five sets per exercise,\nthree to five repetitions per set,\nand three to five minutes between sets.\nNow, the one exception to\nthis that I incorporated\nwas that for very small muscle\ngroups, so for instance,\nthe rear deltoids or for\nneck work or for calf work,\nto not rely purely on\nthree to five repetitions,\nbut maybe to work in a\nrange of anywhere from five\nto eight repetitions, so\nstill fairly low repetitions\nbut not so low that it restricts you\nto three to five repetitions.\nThe reason for that is that I,\nand I think a lot of people\nout there, find it hard\nto fatigue those smaller\nmuscle groups adequately\nwith good form when restricting oneself\nto those low repetitions.\nHowever, for big compound\nmovements like presses and squats\nand deadlifts and glute ham raises\nand things of that sort,\nmaybe even leg extensions\nand leg curls, which are\nisolation exercises, of course,\nto really restrict oneself to those three\nto five repetition ranges\nthat take you to failure or near failure.\nI listed off the benefits of doing that\nthat I experienced, and I'm confident\nthat you will also\nexperience a lot of benefits.\nSo just to remind you what\nsome of those benefits are,\nyou get stronger, which feels great,\nthat occurs within your weight workouts,\nbut it also carries over\nto your endurance training sessions.\nI also noticed that when\nreturning to higher repetitions\nfor resistance training,\nso after 12 weeks,\nshifting away from three\nto five repetition ranges\nand going back to training\nin the six to 10 repetition ranges mainly,\noccasionally up to 12 or 15,\nbut really mainly restricting\nto six to 10 repetitions,\nthat you can move much\nheavier weights in good form\nand thereby induce more hypertrophy\nwhile still also continuing\nto gain some strength.\nAnd another benefit was,\nagain, reduce soreness compared\nto when training with\nhigher repetition ranges\nand more mental freshness,\nis I guess the only way to describe it,\nwhen training in those\nlower repetition ranges.\nI don't know about you, but when I finish\na really hard hour long\nresistance training session done\nin the sixth to 12 repetition\nrange, there's a certain type\nof mental fatigue that even\nif I eat properly afterwards,\neven if I hydrate properly,\nthat it tends to sap a bit\nof my mental energy later in the day.\nBut that the training at the three\nto five repetition range\ndid just the opposite.\nIt actually enhanced my\nfocus and my cognition,\nmy overall levels of physical energy,\nwhich is great because it allows you\nto do all the other things\nthat we're required to\ndo throughout the day.\nAnd by the way, it'll also allow you\nto get more of that Zone 2 Cardio.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
