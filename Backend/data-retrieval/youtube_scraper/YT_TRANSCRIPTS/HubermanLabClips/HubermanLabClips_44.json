    "transcript": "If you listen to the series\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin,\nyou may recall our discussion\nabout the Sugar Kane,\nwhich is so named after our friend\nand expert trainer, Kenny Kane\nand it is a very efficient,\nyet somewhat brutal way\nto increase your cardiovascular output.\nSo the Sugar Kane is the type of protocol\nthat you would incorporate\nonce in the period of a week,\nbut certainly not every week.\nIt's the kind of thing\nthat you might throw in\nonce every two weeks\nor once every four weeks as a replacement\nfor your other high\nintensity interval training.\nThe Sugar Kane involves\nselecting some form\nof exercise that you can do\nat high intensity safely,\nand of course it will\ndiffer between individuals.\nFor some of you, it will\nbe a stationary bike.\nFor others of you, it will be a road bike.\nFor others of you, it'll be running,\nand for others of you it will be rowing.\nThe exact form of\nexercise is not important.\nWhat is important is that\nyou can generate a lot\nof intensity, so you're going\nto be doing some sprint like work,\nalthough not all out sprints,\nexcept on the final round.\nI'll explain where all\nthis is going in a moment.\nBut again, you need to select a movement\nthat you can do without injuring yourself\nwhile still performing a\nmovement at high intensity.\nSo for me, that would be running.\nFor you, it might be something else.\nThe Sugar Kane is pretty\nstraightforward in structure.\nIt involves three rounds after\na brief warmup, of course.\nSo you're going to do three\nto five minutes of jogging\nor jumping jacks or\nskipping ropes, something\nto get your core body temperature\nup so that you're prepared\nto do the high intensity work.\nAnd then there are only three\nrounds of high intensity work\nand they go as the following.\nIn round one, you are\ngoing to take two minutes,\nso you'll need to set a\ntimer for two minutes,\nand you're going to go\nthe maximum distance\nthat you can in that two minutes.\nSo run the maximum distance\nthat you can for two minutes\nor cycle the maximum distance\nthat you can for two minutes\nor versa climber the maximum distance\nthat you can for two minutes.\nWhatever you select, you're\ngoing to do that as far\nand as fast as you can for\nthe duration of two minutes.\nSo depending on the movement\nand depending on your level of fitness,\nthat distance might be\n400 meters, 600 meters,\n800 meters, et cetera.\nWhatever distance you\ntravel in that two minutes,\nyou are going to mark that\ndistance down in your mind\nor in your phone or on a piece of paper.\nAnd then you're going to rest two minutes.\nSo two minutes of work,\nthen rest two minutes.\nThen in round two, you're\ngoing to go the same distance\nthat you did in round one,\nand you're going to take\nas much time as you need\nto do that distance as fast as you can.\nSo if you went 600 meters in\ntwo minutes for round one,\nin round two, you're\ngoing to go 600 meters\nand it's going to take you\nhowever long it takes you.\nChances are, if you really\ndid the best you could\nin round one, you were at maximum output\nfor the first two minutes,\nthat in round two it's going\nto take you longer than\ntwo minutes to travel\nthat equivalent distance.\nHowever, there is the possibility\nthat it will take you less time,\nbut for most people, it's\ngoing to take you more time.\nSo staying with this example\nof 600 meters in two minutes\non round one, in round two,\nyou're going to go 600 meters.\nLet's say it takes you two\nminutes and 30 seconds.\nYou then are going to mark down\nhow long round two took you.\nSo in this case, the example\nis two minutes and 30 seconds.\nThen you're going to\nrest another two minutes,\nand then in round three you're\ngoing to go all out again\nas fast and as safely as you\ncan for the same duration\nthat you did in round two.\nAnd your goal is to go at least as far\nas you went in round one.\nAnd if there's still time\nleft, you're going to continue\nto go all out again as\nfast as you safely can\nuntil the entire duration is completed.\nSo it's really just three\nrounds with two rest periods\nin between round one and round three.\nAnd then I highly recommend that\nafter round three that you do some sort\nof dedicated cool down.\nSo instead of just flopping\nonto the bench or the floor\nor the lawn, that you walk around slowly\nuntil you recover your breathing.\nThe reason I like the Sugar Kane as a tool\nthat one implements once\nevery say two to four weeks\nas a replacement\nfor one's typical high\nintensity interval training\nis several fold.\nFirst of all, if you\nprovide the right intensity\nin round one and round two\nand round three, it is sure\nto elevate your heart rate substantially.\nAnd in doing so, improve your\nVO2 max, which is correlated\nwith all sorts of\nimportant metrics related\nto healthspan, performance and lifespan.\nSecond of all, it gamifies\nthings a little bit.\nIt pits you against yourself in the sense\nthat if you go out at\nmaximum speed, again,\nperforming a movement\nthat you can safely perform\nat maximum speed in round one,\nwell then you have\nsomething to compete against\nin round two and round three.\nAnd that makes the high\nintensity interval training,\nfirst of all, very intense,\nbut also it makes it kind of fun in a way\nthat lets you forget just how\npainful the whole thing is.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
