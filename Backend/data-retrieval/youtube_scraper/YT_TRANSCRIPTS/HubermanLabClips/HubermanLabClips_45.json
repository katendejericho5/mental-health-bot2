    "video_title": "How & Why to Get Weekly \"Zone 2\" Cardio Workouts | Dr. Andrew Huberman",
    "transcript": "The scientific data tell us\nthat we should all be getting\nanywhere from 150 minutes to\n200 minutes per week minimum\nof zone two cardio; for sake\nof cardiovascular health,\ncerebrovascular health,\nand a number of other aspects of health\nthat are important\nessentially to everybody\nfor health span and lifespan.\nNow, many people, including myself,\nschedule zone two cardio into\ntheir weekly fitness regimen.\nSo for me, I have one day a week.\nFor me, it falls on a Sunday\nwhere I go out for a jog\nthat lasts anywhere from\n60 minutes to 90 minutes.\nIt's a slow jog,\nI can maintain nasal\nbreathing the entire time\nor have a conversation with somebody else\nor myself the entire time, if I like.\nOr sometimes it consists\nof a hike by myself\nor with other people.\nAnd sometimes those hikes\nextend anywhere from an hour\nto four hours, depending on\nthe circumstances, et cetera.\nI will mention that whenever possible,\nI try and do that once a\nweek, zone two cardio session\nout of doors because\nI like being in nature\nand I like getting sunlight,\nand I like getting fresh air.\nNow, during the discussion\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin,\nI explained how I get my zone two cardio,\nand I acknowledged that\nthat once a week session\ndoesn't always allow me\nto reach that 150 minute\nto 200 minute minimum threshold\nof zone two cardio per week.\nSometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.\nAnd his response to that\nwas very reassuring.\nWhat he said was,\n\"Look, if you want to\nschedule zone two cardio\n\"and head out for a long\nSunday jog or hike, terrific.\n\"If you want to schedule\nzone two cardio as two\n\"or more sessions on the\ntreadmill or on the bike, great.\"\nBut that he doesn't actually\nthink of zone two cardio\nas exercise at all.\nAnd to that, I gasped, and then\nI was a little bit deflated.\nI thought,\n\"Oh great, like I'm doing\nall this zone two cardio\n\"and you don't even\nconsider that exercise.\"\nAnd then when he said\nit was very reassuring,\nand I think it's going to be\nvery reassuring to all of you,\nhe said, \"First of all,\n\"zone two cardio is absolutely\ncritical to our health\n\"for a number of reasons\nthat I already mentioned.\n\"But in addition to that, zone\ntwo cardio does not impede\n\"and in fact, can enhance our\nother aspects of fitness.\"\nSo for example, our strength training,\nour hypertrophy training\nor any type of speed work\nor other types of cardiovascular\ntraining one might do.\nAnd that the best way\nto get zone two cardio\nis okay, if you want to schedule\nit, schedule it as a session\nbut that to simply increase\nthe amount of walking\nand in particular, walking at\na rapid pace that one does,\nand to increase the\ntotal amount of movement\nthat one's getting throughout the week.\nSo taking groceries in and\nout of the grocery store,\nrunning around with the kids,\ntaking a walk with a coworker\nwhile having a work discussion,\ntaking your calls for work\nwhile pacing in the\noffice or going outside.\nWhat he impressed on me\nis that zone two cardio\ncan be meshed throughout\nthe daily activities\nthat I and everybody else\ngenerally have to do.\nAnd this was of great relief to me\nbecause I, as many of you\nare, I'm extremely busy.\nI don't have time to schedule\nin more cardio per week\nor at least I don't see\nthe way I could do that\nwithout reducing the amount\nof sleep that I'm getting\nor without reducing the\namount of social connection\nthat I'm getting with family and friends,\nboth of which are extremely important\nto our mental health and physical health.\nSo the basic tool here is yes,\nget 200 minutes per week\nminimum of zone two cardio.\nAnd notice I said 200 minutes,\nnot 150 minutes to 200 minutes.\nI'm going to set the higher threshold\nof 200 minutes per week\nminimum of zone two cardio.\nBut that you don't need to schedule that\nas time on the treadmill.\nIf you want to, great, but\nwhat was communicated to me\nfrom Dr. Andy Galpin\nis that zone two cardio\nis immensely beneficial.\nIt's not going to impede,\nand in fact, it's going to\nimprove other aspects of fitness\nand that it does not have to impede\nand it in fact can improve\nother aspects of our daily life,\nlike our ability to engage socially,\nour ability to have a great output at work\nin whatever type of work you do.\nSo the message is very simple,\nget 200 minutes or more of\nzone two cardio per week.\nAnd the message is also\na very reassuring one,\nwhich is that, that zone two cardio\ncan be spread throughout\nyour daily activities.\nAnd that if you're doing enough of it,\nyou probably don't even have to count\nthe total amount of zone two\ncardio that you're getting.\nIf you simply make the effort\nto move around a lot more\nduring your daily activities\nand to mesh that zone two cardio\nwith your daily activities,\nyou're going to hit that threshold\nof 200 minutes per week minimum.\nNow that's a great message for me\nbecause I'm already doing\nthe three resistance\ntraining workouts per week.\nI'm doing what now I can just call\nthe two other cardiovascular\ntraining workouts per week\nbecause now I don't even\ncount that long Sunday jog\nor Sunday hike as exercise.\nI just consider that movement\nout of doors on the weekend.\nAnd in doing so,\nit's also allowed me to\nreally enjoy that a lot more.\nThere's something about\nconsidering something\na fitness training program that shifts it\nfrom just recreation and\nenjoying life to training.\nAnd I of course, love training.\nI love training in the gym and\nI love training out of doors.\nI love running, I love lifting weights.\nI love all sorts of physical training.\nI know many people do, I\nknow many people don't.\nBut if one looks at zone two cardio\nas just part of their daily life,\nyou're far more likely to\nget that zone two cardio in\nand all the benefits that come with it.\nAnd you're also opening up time for work,\nfor social engagements\nand pay attention to\nother aspects of fitness.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
