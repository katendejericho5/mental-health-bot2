    "transcript": "Baby comes out, do they\ncheck their eyes right away?\nYeah.\nAnd if so,\nhow often should they check?\nAnd what kind of information is there?\nYeah, that's a great question.\nIt's obviously something\nthat touches us all.\nSo the answer to that\nreally differs a little bit\nat the different stages of life.\nFirst of all, every baby gets an eye exam\nor should be getting an eye exam.\nAnd one of the main things\nthat you really just are screening\nfor right when that baby is\nborn, right in the nursery,\nright in those first few days,\nis to just look for a red reflex.\nYou know, when you take a\ncamera picture, a flash picture,\nand sometimes you get red eye,\nthat's actually the light\nfrom the flash, as you know,\nreflecting against the retina\nand coming back out of\nyour eye, it looks red.\nAnd a red reflex is actually\nvery normal. That's great.\nAnd if you have one of a\nnumber of diseases in the eye\nthat can present even in\nbabies, even in newborn babies,\nincluding most concerning,\nbut thankfully least\ncommon, retinoblastoma,\nwhich is the most common\npediatric eye cancer,\nwhich again, thankfully is quite rare,\nthose babies won't have\na red reflex in that eye.\nIt'll be kind of a whitish or gray reflex.\nAnd so even just that\nfirst little, you know,\ndoctor's taking the little pen light\nand even just flashing\nit in the baby's eyes.\nSo that's our first eye exam,\nand hopefully we've all had that\nand hopefully every baby being\nborn today is getting that,\ngetting that first eye exam\nis really just looking\nfor that red reflex.\nIt's not typical, as long\nas that's looking good,\nto worry about getting an eye exam.\nFrom there kind of through childhood,\nlike maybe early elementary school,\nunless your baby is presenting\nwith one of a number of features\nthat parents often pick up on.\nFor example, as the baby's aging\nthrough those first\ncouple of years, you know,\nthrough the first couple of years,\nbabies actually don't\nhave great visual acuity.\nAnd so as they're aging over\nthose first couple years,\nit's normal for them to\nhave roving eye movements,\nfor example, be searching\ntheir environment.\nBut over those first couple of years,\nif parents start noticing the\nbaby isn't making eye contact\nor looking where a sound is,\ncertainly if they have\nwhat's called nystagmus,\nlike these rapid flickering,\nalternating eye movements,\nanything like that, of course,\nyou're going to trigger an eye exam.\nBut otherwise, most babies,\nother than their pediatrician\ndoing that red reflex check\nwhen they're in for their\nregular well child checks,\nthat's really all that's\nneeded through that.\nWhen most kids get to\nelementary school age,\nthey'll often be, often\ndone at the schools\nan amblyopia screening exam.\nIf kids' eyes, either, if one\neye doesn't see that well,\nlike maybe you're very nearsighted\nor farsighted in one eye\nand pretty normal sighted in the other,\nor the two refractive errors\nare quite different from each other,\nthat can lead to a condition\nyou've talked about\non the podcast before called amblyopia,\nwhich is probably one of the more common\nor most common eye diseases of children.\nOr if the eyes aren't aligned,\nyou know, our eye muscles\nand the brain behind them\nare really responsible\nfor keeping the two eyes\nlooking straight ahead,\nand if that's not working properly\nand one eye is off kilter\nand therefore the image\nof what we're looking at is\nfalling on different spots\nof the retina, it's not\nsinking upright in the brain\nthat can lead to this disease\ncondition called amblyopia\nwhere that eye is no longer\ntalking to the brain properly.\nAnd there's a pretty easy screening exam\nthat can be done for strabismus,\nthe misalignment of the eyes\nthat kids will do in elementary school.\nThe other main presenting symptom\nif kids in elementary school\nis when they admit to their parents,\n\"I can't see the board,\" or\n\"I can't see the teacher up front,\"\nand then they might be quite nearsighted.\nAnd so that will also trigger an exam.\nAnd so those are usually\nthe parts for babies,\nfor toddlers, for children,\nschool aged children\nthat might reasonably trigger an exam.\nA couple of questions\nabout early eye exams,\nand we'll get onto eye\nexams in older individuals\nin a second, but I want to\ninterrupt you with this question.\nSo you mentioned that there can be\na misalignment of the eyes.\nI've seen many people's babies\nwhere there is one eyeball\nthat seems to be kind of drifting around\nand then it might correct,\nbut sometimes they'll have a,\nwe don't want to get technical\nhere for our listeners,\nwe'll keep it general,\nbut either convergent eyes\nor one eye converging\ncross eyes or wall eyed,\nyou know, again, using that\nnon-technical language here,\nand my understanding is that the brain\nis taking that information\nin and it's very plastic,\nit's changing in these\nearly stages of development,\nand that it's fairly critical\nto get that stuff corrected early on,\nbecause if you wait too long,\nthe brain can essentially become blind\nor rather the brain cannot learn\nto handle the proper alignment.\nSo in other words, if\na kid has crossed eyes,\nand they're not corrected until their 20s,\nit's possible that they will\nnever recover normal vision.\nWhereas if you align the eyes\nproperly early in development,\nthey can indeed recover vision.\nHow early can and should\none consider getting\nthose eye realignment done?\nYeah, yeah. Pretty much right on.\nWhat they'll do is if they\ndetect any eye misalignment,\nand sometimes parents are\ngood at noticing that.\nAnd sometimes you take a picture\nand one eye got the red eye\nreflex and the other one didn't.\nAnd sometimes people notice\nthat their kids' eyes\nare sort of turning in,\nit seems like too much,\nsometimes there's what's\ncalled pseudo strabismus,\nwhich is where actually,\ndepending on your anatomy,\nif you have a little extra skin\nsort of on the inside\ncorners of your eyes,\nit makes your eyes look turned in\nwhen actually they're straight.\nBut if your eyes are actually turned in\nor slightly less common in children,\nmore common in adults\nmisalignment turned out,\nit's really important\nto correct that early.\nAnd the reason is, as you were saying,\nthe brain starts ignoring it.\nIt fails to fully develop\nthe strong connections\nfor the data coming in\nfrom one of those two eyes\ninto the brain.\nAnd if you pass certain sort of thresholds\nduring development, during childhood,\nwithout correcting that connectivity,\ngetting those two eyes to\nwork together properly,\nyou can permanently lose that.\nAnd so we used to use very sort\nof, you know, gross numbers,\nlike it's fully correctable\nif you can intervene before age three,\nit's partly correctable if you\ncan intervene before age six,\nyou got a chance before age nine.\nBut it turns out in follow on studies\nthat even kids into their\nyoung teens have a shot\nat correcting that eye-brain connection,\nthat amblyopia, that loss of vision\nthat can occur during early development.\nSo even if you're only,\nunfortunately, detecting that\nlater on in childhood or\neven sort of the tween years\nor early teen years,\nit's still worth a try\nto really push to retrain the weaker eye\nand then also realign the muscles\nso that they can work together\nto keep the eyes focused.\nI'll tell you, it's interesting\nand there's a lot more to\nlearn about brain plasticity\nand probably a lot of\nreally cool new therapies\nyet to discover that could reopen\nwhat's called critical period plasticity,\nthis plasticity that we\nhave during development\nthat kind of goes away as we age,\nand that critical period\nplasticity, as you know,\nhas been the best studied\nactually in the visual system.\nAnd the idea that we could\nreopen that is really fantastic.\nBut for different parts of\nthat eye-brain connection,\nthere's different periods for\ncritical period plasticity.\nFor example, even if you\nget the amblyopic eye\nto see well again, and\nthen you realign the eyes\nand now they're working together,\na lot of kids will never\nrecover full depth perceptions,\nstereopsis the use of two eyes\nto see depth, for example.\nSo, why that part of the\nbrain doesn't correct as well\nas the visual acuity or central\nvision part of the brain,\nI'm not sure if we understand that yet.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
