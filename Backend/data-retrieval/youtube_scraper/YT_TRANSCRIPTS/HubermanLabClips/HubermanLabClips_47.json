    "transcript": "Is there any detriment to\nhaving a piece of glass\nor a piece of plastic on the\nfront of your eye all the time?\nAnd the reason I ask\nis not because I think\nwe should live necessarily\nexactly like our ancestors,\nbut it's a pretty bizarre adaptation\nto put a lens directly\nonto the front of the eye.\nYou have to imagine that the cells\nand tissues there are accustomed\nto getting a certain amount of oxygen.\nThey're accustomed to\ngetting a certain amount\nof interaction with the environment.\nAnd you also are now\nadding another surface\nthe way that the tears\nare going to interact\nwith the cornea of the\neye or probably change.\nAnd who knows, maybe it doesn't make\nany negative difference at all,\nbut putting a contact lens\non the front of the eye\nis about as close to putting\na device on your brain\nas I can think of, except for\nmaybe the cochlear implant.\nYeah, yeah.\nThat's a great question.\nNow, first of all, I want to distinguish,\nthere are a few really medical uses\nfor different kinds of contact lenses,\nlike scleral contact lenses for people\nwho have certain diseases.\nThere are other kinds.\nBut I think what we really\nwant to talk about right now\nis just kind of the run of the mill,\n\"I want to get my\nprescription taken care of,\nbut instead of wearing glasses,\nI'm going to wear contacts.\"\nContacts, even the newest\ngeneration contacts, yes.\nThey sort of change the tear dynamics\non the surface of your eye.\nThey decrease the oxygen,\ndiffusion that's just\nsort of out in the air\nonto the surface of our eye,\nonto the cells that are\non the surface of our eye.\nBut most of us, especially\nas we're younger,\nhave enough tear film reserve,\nenough oxygen reserve,\nthat we can easily\ntolerate these polymer gel\nsoft contact lenses and wear them happily.\nThe advantage of contact\nlenses over glasses,\npurely from the perspective\nof correcting your vision,\nis that there's different\nelements of the shape of your eye\nthat need to be corrected if\nyou need corrective lenses.\nAnd so for example, if\nyou're the basketball shape\nof your eye is a little too\nsteep or a little too shallow,\nthat's what the standard glasses correct.\nYou may have been told\nthat you have something\ncalled astigmatism.\nThat's where instead of having\na basketball shaped eye,\nyou have a slightly football shaped eye.\nIt's not round in the same\ndimensions on both axes.\nAnd again, glasses can correct that.\nBut then there's higher order aberrations,\nin our corneas in the clear\nwindow in the front of our eyes,\nor to some degree, in\nthe lens inside the eye\nthat are focusing the light,\nthat the glass's\nprescription can't correct.\nBut if you have a nice smooth contact lens\non the front, it can correct.\nSo a lot of people who\nwear glasses and contacts\nwill report that they have a\nmuch higher quality of vision\nwith their contact lens correction\nthan with their glasses correction.\nAnd again, in service of\nenjoying the best vision\nthat you can enjoy in your daily life,\nthat's an upside to seeing if\ncontacts could work for you.\nNow there's another element though,\nand that's like, \"Gosh, is\nthere a risk of contact lenses?\"\nAnd especially as we age, we\nhave less tear film reserves,\nso contacts may become\nless tolerable as we age.\nAnd the other thing is being\nreally good about the cleaning\nbecause the contacts can\ntrap bacteria or fungus,\nand if you get a corneal\ninfection from a contact lens,\nit actually can be quite\ndevastating to your cornea.\nEven if you successfully\ntreat the infection,\nyou can be left with\nsome corneal scarring.\nThankfully this happens very rarely.\nBut when it does happen,\nit can be quite difficult\non the person thereafter to sort of suffer\nthrough having maybe a\nscar from that infection\non the surface of their cornea\nthat leads to some blurring\nvision for example.\nSo we always recommend that if\nyou're going to wear contacts\nthat you be really attentive\nto whether you're tolerating them well.\nAnd then also to be really attentive\nto the recommended use and\ncleaning of the contact lenses.\nI actually recommend that even though\nthey're a little more expensive to afford,\nthat people should almost\nalways be just using the daily\ncontact lenses that they\ndon't have to clean or use\nfor two weeks or a four week period.\nSo these are disposable contact lenses-\nDaily disposable.\nAnd I hate to think of, I don't know,\nfilling our oceans or what have you\nwith more polymer plastic,\nbut at least the contact lenses are small.\nAnd it's much safer for your eye\nto use a daily disposable than to use\na two week or a four week\nand be responsible for the cleaning.\nThe other thing to be\nreally responsible about\nis sleeping in them overnight.\nBecause overnight, when\nyour eyelids are closed,\nof course now you're\ngetting even less oxygen\nto the surface of your eye.\nAnd actually most bacteria,\nespecially many of the\ninfectious bacteria to our bodies\nand to the surface of our eye,\nare actually bacteria that\ndon't really like oxygen.\nAnd so, we've got a low risk\nof getting bacterial infections\non the surface of our eye,\nbut if we use contacts too\nmuch, don't clean them,\nor sleep in them overnight\nwhen our eyelids are closed\nand now there's even less oxygen\nkind of helping keep the\nsurface more clean if you will.\nThat increases the risk a lot.\nSo being really good\nwith the recommended use\nand cleaning of the contact is critical.\nConsidering daily use contacts.\nYou don't have to, and look,\nmost contacts are going to be\nthe two week or four week kind\nwhere you put 'em in the cleaning solution\novernight each time,\ngive 'em a good rinse,\nand put 'em back in the next day.\nAnd again, most people,\n99.99 some percent of people\nare going to do just fine with that,\nfollow the instructions\nand never get into trouble.\nAs we age, they're going\nto become less tolerable.\nPeople are going to say,\n\"I used to wear my contacts\nfor 12 hours, now my eyes feel really dry\nafter six or eight or 10 hours.\"\nMaybe some years after that they say,\n\"Gosh, I could barely\nuse it for four hours.\nI only use 'em when I go\nout on a Saturday night.\"\nAnd that's okay.\nYou can back off as you need to back off.\nBut in the meantime, if it helps you,\nespecially in the younger decades,\nif it helps you really enjoy\nyour best vision, great.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
