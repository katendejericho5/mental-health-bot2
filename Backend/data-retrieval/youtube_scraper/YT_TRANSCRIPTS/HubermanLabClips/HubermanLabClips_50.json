    "transcript": "Well most people just look at me as\nthe guy that runs and\nyells as he's running.\nAnd that's, while I do that,\nyou know, to motivate people.\nBut people don't understand that\nmy day is broken up into segments.\nI work out, I eat, I sleep,\nI spend most of my time studying.\nSo like I'm in the medical world.\nI'm a, you know, paramedic in Canada,\nbut I spend a lot of\nmy time trying to nuke\nevery single thing about it.\nBecause I'm not trying\nto just be a paramedic,\nlearn about veins and arteries,\nand how the heart pumps\nand stuff like that.\nI'm trying to learn to the point\nwhere I can save someone's life.\nAnd even though paramedics are doing\nthat all over the world,\nI'm trying to be that paramedic\nthat can really dissect\nexactly what's going on,\nand figure out, you know,\nwhat medication goes where.\nJust trying to, you know,\njust trying to learn,\nyou know, the algorithm\nof what's going on, man.\nSo I spend a lot of time with it.\nI love the word algorithm.\n'Cause when I teach biology,\nor try and learn anything\nthat's related to biology,\nand especially the human body,\nRight.\nI need to know the nouns.\nYep.\nBut it's the verbs that matter.\nAnd that's really what\nyou're talking about.\nLike just saying, that sits there,\nthat brain part there,\nRight.\nDoesn't tell you how\nit all works together.\nNo.\nSo what is your process\nfor studying look like?\nLike if we dropped a,\na camera in the room,\nput a microphone into that,\ninto your inner dialogue,\nRight.\nGosh, wouldn't we all love that.\nBut if we dropped a microphone\ninto your inner dialogue,\nare you waking up looking\nat the books and going,\n\"Yeah, fresh day.\"\nRight.\nLet's learn.\nOr is some of the same resistance that\nyou've talked about coming\nup around physical work?\nIs that coming up from time to time?\nYou know what, I was nervous at first.\nI'm going to keep the mother...\nI'm going to keep it real.\nPlease.\nI'm going to keep it real.\nSo, I'm not a real smart guy.\nAnd what I mean by that\nis, I was born ADD, ADHD.\nMy brain cannot retain information.\nI'm not some genetic freak\nwhen it comes to running,\nwhen it comes to lifting weights.\nI am absolutely the bottom of the barrel.\nAnd people will never believe me.\nAnd they can just, you know, whatever.\nBelieve what you want to believe.\nSo when he asked me this question,\nabout what does studying look like for me.\nI have to go over the same page\nover, and over, and over, and over again,\nwhile Jennifer can look at that page,\nwhile she's, you know, quizzing me.\nShe'll learn it right then, as she's,\nshe's doesn't know anything about it.\nShe will quiz herself or quiz me,\nand learn it as she's quizzing me.\nIt's the most frustrating\nthing in the world\nhow my brain works.\nSo what I, so what I do is,\nI literally sit there\nwith a pen and paper,\nand I have my books.\nAnd I go through, and I have\nto write everything down\nevery single day.\nI will study the same page\nuntil it is photographic memory\nfrom writing the same thing down.\nAnd then from there,\nI'll go back through and relearn it again.\nSo, I'll learn the bulk of it,\nbut then I'll go through and learn\nthe small things within that.\nSo if it's the medication,\nI'll learn what the medication does.\nI'll first, I'll learn how\nto even say the medication.\n'Cause these medications aren't like,\nyou know, like albuterol.\nNo, it's very big words.\nSo I'll go through, learn\nhow to say the name,\nthen I'll go through,\nlearn what the dose is,\nthen I'll go through...\nAnd this is like every single day.\nSo not like, \"Oh, I got\nit. Let's just go through.\"\nNo, nothing is \"I got it.\"\nEvery single thing, that's,\nso I can't wait to get\nin this conversation.\n'Cause everything I do in life, it sucks.\nEverything I do in life, it sucks.\nThat's why when I was 300 pounds\nand 24 years old,\nit wasn't like I had some big epiphany of,\nlet's just go be a Navy seal,\nlet's lose some weight.\nNo, I knew my entire life\nwas going to be a struggle,\nwhich is why I just ignored it.\nAnd I said, I'm not\neven trying to jump off\ninto this shit, and learn how to read,\nhow to write, how to memorize,\nhow to become something I am not.\nBut through that process,\nsomething happened to me,\nand I realized, this is why\nI feel sorry for no one.\nIn this podcast, they're\ngoing to really not like me,\nbecause people are\ngoing to think that I am\nmaybe lying, or maybe\nfibbing, or exaggerating.\nNo, I am literally, I was\nthe lowest form on earth,\nno talent, no ability to learn,\nand I literally know what it is\nto be rock bottom and to build that up.\nSo that question about\nlearning, it's a pain in my ass.\nAnd I don't have to do it.\nIt's the thing about it, I'm 49 years old,\nand I'm a multimillionaire.\nI don't have to do anything.\nSo all I thought about\nwhen I was growing up is,\n\"Man, I can't wait to\none day get to the point\nwhere I no longer have to do this stuff.\"\nBut what happens is I got older,\nit became a way of living.\nSo how I do every day\nis how I do every day.\nIt's a, it's a discipline, it's a regimen,\nit's a, it's a, it was a choice I made.\nAnd the choice I made was,\nwhat are you willing to sacrifice,\nand what are you willing to give up\nto find every bit of who\nyou are as a human being?\nAnd I was willing to give\nup everything to do that.\nSo studying is no joke.\nI love that you're studying.\nI recall a few years ago I heard\nsome interview or podcast with you,\nand you just threw out like,\n\"I don't know what I'll do next.\nMaybe I'll be a scientist.\"\nAnd I, and I went, \"Yeah!\"\nI was like, 'cause I knew,\n'cause I know you a bit-\nRight.\nAnd I see your work out there.\nBut we had met before,\nthat if you decided that\nyou were going to do it.\nRight.\nAnd learning medicine,\nwhich is what you're doing,\nRight.\nlearning human physiology is so detailed.\nVery.\nAnd people out there\nhave to understand,\nwhen you look at a textbook and you see\nthe veins and the\ncapillaries, different colors,\nwhen the body's open,\nthey're not different colors.\nRight. Right. Right.\nYou know? They're not...\nSo, I mean, some things are\nhave different color contrast,\nbut it's not like it's all\nlabeled when you pop it open.\nExactly.\nAnd so,\nso the process of writing\nthings down by hand\nis important for you.\nDo you go, so you go back\nand read those notes?\nDo you think about that\nstuff on your runs too?\nOr are you segmenting your day?\nLike when you're done studying,\nare you heading out for a run,\nand thinking about other things?\nOr are you still rehearsing\nthe material in your head?\nSo when I write it down,\nI write it down, and I'm able to,\nI'm actually looking down\nat this table right now\n'cause I'm back to writing.\nSo I'm actually there right now\nas I'm speaking to you.\nI write it down in a way\nthat I'm memorizing page 69.\nSo, I'm writing it down.\nSo then writing it down in that page\nsync together in my brain.\nSo I'm looking at the book\nin my brain right now.\nSo like, that's just how it works for me.\nAnd I have to do it over and over again.\nSo that page is stuck in my mind.\nSo I'm literally flipping through pages,\nas I'm taking these tests,\nand I'm taking these national tests\nto become a paramedic,\nor become a advanced EMT or whatever.\nI'm literally, as I'm taking that test,\nI'm going through and I'm like,\nnow I'm flipping pages in my head\nof where that page was.\nAnd how I do that is\njust from how I write it,\nand how it's on the page.\nWhen I run, I can't recall any of it.\nHmm.\nI cannot,\nI cannot bring any of\nthat because I'm running.\nHow my mind is wired now is,\nthat everything I do is what I do.\nBecause the focus it takes for me to,\nlike right now, I'm running,\nI'm not like a great runner.\nI'm not like injury free.\nSo like my first 20 minutes\nof the run, I'm limping.\nI'm literally limping because\nI've had several knee surgeries,\nand my body was twisted,\nand so now it's untwisting.\nSo people look at me,\n\"Oh, it looks like he's limp,\nyou know, like limping when he runs.\"\nI am limping when I run.\nMy body's jacked up.\nSo I'm focusing on how to get\nthe best out of a broken body.\nSo everything I do,\nis a total focus on what I'm doing\nat that point in my life.\nSo it seems like you've\nreally trained away,\nor somehow gotten away from\nthe ADD that you mentioned.\nMm-hmm.\nBecause what you described\nis a deep trench.\nIt's like a v-shaped trench.\nRight.\nAnd I'm imagining like\nthere's a ball bearing,\nand it's like floop,\nand it can only go forward in that trench-\nRight.\nOr back,\nit goes forward.\nIt's not like sliding around\nat the like concave at the bottom.\nRight.\nLike a tension.\nSo it's like you've trained that up.\nIs there a similar feeling\nwhen you're in the full focus of running,\nversus full focus of studying?\nDoes it kind of feel like,\n\"Oh yeah, that's the same\ngroove but different thing?\"\nOr is it just completely different world?\nIt's a completely\ndifferent world complete.\nLike it is just, both of\n'em for me is suffering,\nbut it's suffering a whole different way.\nLike when I was going through school,\nI'll never forget, I think\nI was in third grade,\nand back then, you know,\nADD, ADHD wasn't like,\nyou know, here's this\nmedicine, or here's this thing.\nThey want to put you in a special school.\nMm-hmm.\nSo for me,\nI was so far behind in learning,\nthat their big thing was,\n\"Let's just put him in a special school\nbecause he'll never learn.\"\nAnd through that process of like,\n\"I don't want to be in a special school,\nI don't want to be\ntreated any differently.\"\nIt really, like, I never took medication.\nI've never taken medication for this.\nThat's why right now you see\nme looking right in your eyes.\nWhat the hell is, you know,\nis Truman saying right now?\nAnd that's why I don't feel bad for people\nwho have a ADHD, who have\nlearning disabilities.\nAnd some are impossible,\nbecause you just can't.\nBut a lot of them you can.\nAnd, but people don't want to\ngo through the process of focus,\nof teaching yourself how to truly focus.\nThis is where my message gets lost.\nIt gets lost 'cause I may say,\nyou know, MF or F, where you know,\nI may be, 'cause that's the\npassion that comes out of me.\n'Cause that's, it takes everything\nfor me to learn a sentence.\nSo when I speak about David Goggins,\nI can't speak about David Goggins\nin a way that's just calm and cool.\nBecause when I wake up,\nI know the journey that it takes\nfor me to find my greatness.\nAnd it's hard.\nEvery, nothing is easy.\nNothing just like, oh, I wake up,\nand I just do this or I do that,\nor it just, you know, I\nwatch people every day\ngo through life and it's so easy.\nFor me to be where I'm at today,\nit takes every bit of me.\nSo when I speak about it,\nand as I get going here,\nyou'll start seeing me,\nthe temple will rise, the\npassion will come out,\nbecause I'm back there.\nI'm doing what I do every\nday to become a human being.\nAnd so nothing is easy.\nLike running is running.\nIt sucks, but you have a choice to make.\nDo you want to sit down\nand go back to that guy you once were?\nNo. So this is what it takes.\nThis is what it, it takes that\nmisunderstanding of people.\nAnd they'll never get it\n'cause they were never David Goggins.\nSo that is what it takes\nfor me to do what I do.\nIt may take you something differently.\nSo for me, everything has\nto be in the studying,\neverything has to be into this,\neverything has to be in,\neverywhere I am has to be there.\nMe, focused where I am.\nThat's why you're my second podcast\nI've done since Rogan,\nsince the book came out.\nI don't have time for that shit.\nBecause if I want to be great,\nI'm not trying to maximize money,\nor maximize people knowing me.\nI do these things because\nmaybe someone out there\nwill understand me and get it,\nand say \"I can grow from this guy.\"\nAnd others just won't.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
