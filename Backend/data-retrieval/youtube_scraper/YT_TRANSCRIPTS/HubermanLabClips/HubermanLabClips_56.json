    "transcript": "Could you define 20/20 vision\nand a few of the variants\n[Jeff laughs]\nso that any person could understand it?\nSo we think of 20/20 as perfect vision,\nwhat does that mean?\nWhat would degraded vision look like,\nwhatever those numbers are,\nand then what would above normal,\nsupranormal vision look like?\nAnd is it true that fighter pilots\nhave supranormal vision?\nYeah, that's another\npopulation, like many athletes,\nof people who may have sort\nof better than normal vision.\n20/20, you know, we define\nalmost everything we do\nbased on, you know, kind of a average,\nnot sick, human being, adult,\nwhatever it is, right?\nAnd so 20/20 vision\nmeans that you can read\nthe smallest letters at 20 feet away\nthat the average healthy person\ncan read at 20 feet away.\nSo you can read at 20 what\nthey can read at 20, okay?\nNow, if you have worse than 20/20 vision,\nmaybe you have 20/25 vision,\n20/40 vision, maybe\nyou have 20/200 vision,\nwhich, on the eye chart at the office,\nis like the big E at the\nvery top is 20/200 vision,\nthat means you can read at 20 feet\nwhat a normal person could\nread at 200 feet, right?\nSo you've got pretty limited lower vision.\nWe can measure down to\nlike 20/400, 20/800.\nAt that point, we're getting into like,\n\"Gosh, can you count how\nmany fingers I'm holding up?\"\nYou know, that kind of thing.\nAnd then, ultimately, hand motion.\n\"Can you even tell if my hand is moving\nin this side of your vision\nor this side of your vision?\"\nAnd then, ultimately, after\nthat, light perception.\n\"Can you tell if the room\nlights are on or off?\"\nAnd that's kind of the edge\nof being actually fully blind.\nWe call legal blindness\nin the United States,\ntypically, 20/200 or worse.\nAnd is it true that there are people\nwho are legally blind\nthat are out there driving\nas we're having this conversation?\nI have to imagine that that\nis unfortunately the case.\nBut it shouldn't be, because those people\nobviously are really severely impaired\nand that's obviously quite dangerous.\nSo that's 20/20.\nNow, it gets worse at\n20/40, 20/80, 20/100.\nCan it get better? Yeah.\nIt turns out that people\ncan be sort of on the\nother end of that curve.\nAnd so we could have\nathletes and fighter pilots\nor people who have had LASIK surgery\nwho are 20/15, 20/10.\nIf you're 20/10, that means\nyou can see at 20 feet\nwhat the average person needs to be\nonly 10 feet away to see, right?\nAnd so you've got better\nthan normal vision.\nAnd people do get to that\nthrough a variety of ways\nand so it is possible to have\nbetter than 20/20 vision.\nDoes the degree of visual acuity,\n'cause that's really what\nwe're talking about here,\ndiffer dramatically between the two eyes?\nIn most healthy people, no.\nYou know, remember we\ntalked about you're born\nwith something like 20/200 vision.\nIt takes you a couple of years,\nand it can be a little bit asymmetric.\n20/200 vision.\nYeah, that reminds me, I've seen images\nof what babies can see.\nYou know, parents love\nlooking at their child\nand thinking that their child\nis looking right back at them.\nAnd indeed, often the child\nis looking right back at them.\nAnd your face to your child,\nsorry to break this to you folks,\nis incredibly blurry even\nat that close distance\nfor probably the first\nsix to eight months even\nbefore you come into sharp relief.\nThey're not seeing the\nfine details of your face,\nso smile big.\nLAUGHS: That's right, smile bright\nand keep those eyebrows dark.\nRight, and keep cooing at them\n'cause they can hear pretty well earlier.\nYeah, the optics of newborn babies\nare just dreadfully bad,\nbut they need visual stimulation\nNow, other species, you know, hawks,\nraptors, owls that hunt,\nthey can naturally have 20/10,\n20/8 vision right?\nSo much better vision.\nAnd that's just their normal vision,\nas best as has been measured.\nSo there's definitely the potential\nfor us to have better than 20/20 vision.\nNow, all of this we call visual acuity.\nAnd just to be clear for everyone,\nthat's the vision in the\nvery center of your vision.\nLike when you're reading or looking,\nthat's the very center of your vision.\nOur vision is actually described variably\nas a hill of vision.\nThe peak is in the center.\nThat's, let's say, 20/20\nin most people, right?\nBut it's normal to have that slope off.\nAt our visual acuity,\nyour ability to read the eye chart\non the edges of your vision,\nif you can read the big\nE that's pretty normal.\nLike you could be 20/200 out\non the edges of your vision\nand we would feel like,\n\"Yep, that's pretty normal.\"\nSo our highest acuity\nvision is in the center,\nand that's a big part of\nwhy we spend a lot of time\nusing those eye muscles\nto look around, right?\nWe got to get a little bit\nof a high acuity view of what's around us,\nfill in the gaps of what\nour brain is interpreting\nour peripheral world to look like.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
